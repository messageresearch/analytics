[28:15] i got confused and nobody told me
[28:25] church you know the enemy has been very
[28:30] tricky
[28:30] that's one thing we know about the devil
[28:32] there's one thing we know is like
[28:34] he will always you know catch you at
[28:36] your most vulnerable
[28:37] you know moment you know a couple of you
[28:40] know
[28:41] weeks back it's been a couple of weeks
[28:44] uh
[28:44] i'm that type of person i come home
[28:46] every day and i look at my life i take
[28:48] inventory of it and say okay
[28:50] you know if i'm about to go to sleep
[28:52] okay how did i do did i did i
[28:54] did i do as expected and you know
[28:56] oftentimes you know we humans
[28:58] are fall short in fact by the time i'm
[29:00] thinking five minutes
[29:02] into it i'm like oh god i'm done you
[29:04] know
[29:05] you know i just i think about i'll say
[29:07] oh and i'm that type of person i just
[29:09] beat myself a little bit to say
[29:11] you could have done better in fact that
[29:13] you could have just done better
[29:15] and you know at the point in time i
[29:16] found out it's not just me you know
[29:18] the devil will point that out to me so
[29:20] that i can see i see if i'm the one
[29:22] doing it
[29:23] you know you know most of the time i'll
[29:24] just completely failed
[29:26] uh and it would beat me down so much
[29:29] that it would be
[29:30] very heavy on me and i'll just be like
[29:33] oh god you just can you just help me
[29:35] you know i'll just think about maybe i
[29:37] say but at least there are some that are
[29:39] you say we should be perfect you know
[29:41] like you were perfect
[29:42] and why come i'm just you know this and
[29:44] this i can't
[29:45] one thing i don't do i don't like giving
[29:47] excuses i can't give excuse for this
[29:50] um and you know i was just thinking
[29:52] about it and
[29:53] you know it beat me down i just
[29:55] sometimes i just like i quit i just i
[29:57] just sit down in one corner i just quit
[29:59] and um things would just happen and it
[30:01] would just show me in fact the devil
[30:03] would make it so hard that
[30:04] sometimes i'll sit with my family and
[30:06] say i'm not a stopping seed am i you
[30:08] know they're like
[30:09] no we i'm you not they would tell me
[30:12] that
[30:13] okay i'll try to reinforce that in my
[30:15] brain like okay no i'm not
[30:17] and at a point in time you know i just
[30:20] sat down with them i was like okay
[30:22] i hope i'm not they were like oh no
[30:24] you're not and that's just the devil
[30:25] putting that in me
[30:27] uh but then you know i would look back
[30:28] at my life the lord would stop pointing
[30:30] things out to me and say
[30:32] you think you know you you're my own you
[30:34] know
[30:35] you're you belong to me so let me take
[30:38] you back
[30:38] now let me start taking you back and let
[30:40] me stop let you see what happens
[30:42] you know finding myself and the message
[30:44] yes i was born in it
[30:46] but staying with it staying in it
[30:49] believing that
[30:50] nothing else but just this just this way
[30:53] like if i can stick to it all my life
[30:56] that's what would get me true
[30:58] that's the only thing that i pray for
[30:59] every single day and so i'm
[31:02] asking please pray along with me i just
[31:04] want
[31:05] i just want to take myself completely
[31:06] out and see that it's just god
[31:09] doing everything in me and not myself i
[31:12] know i've derailed a little bit
[31:13] so i'm i'm supposed to sing a song
[31:18] yeah you know just like my mom will
[31:20] always she likes she loves this song
[31:22] it says something through the wall water
[31:24] or something through the flood
[31:26] some true the fire you know but all
[31:28] through the blood you know
[31:30] some true great sorrows but the end god
[31:32] gives a song
[31:34] and so uh when i talk thought about it
[31:38] you know uh the only song that came to
[31:39] my mind is where could i go
[31:41] um i'll go off keyboard
[31:46] part of me toss that
[31:50] leaving below in this whole sinful world
[31:56] hardly a comfort can afford
[32:01] [Music]
[32:03] striving alone
[32:06] to face temptation so
[32:10] where could i go but to the lord
[32:15] [Music]
[32:16] where could i go
[32:20] where could i go
[32:23] seeking a refuge for my soul
[32:30] needing a friend to help me

[32:50] we get a long and sweet accord
[32:56] but when my soul needs my life from
[33:01] above

[33:10] where could i go
[33:11] [Music]
[33:13] where could i go
[33:17] seeking a refuge for my soul
[33:21] [Music]
[33:23] needing a friend to help me

[42:06] but you know even to request for the
[42:08] the co-worker i believe her name was amy
[42:11] you know it's it's the the life that we
[42:14] live before
[42:14] people that they inquire of you because
[42:18] there's a hope
[42:19] that there's something crying out in

[42:36] we'll just trust the lord will lead us
[42:38] here if you have your bibles
[42:40] and you want to open it to the book of
[42:42] james
[42:44] just thinking about a little thought how
[42:46] the lord's been dealing with me
[42:49] we had a nice trip
[42:53] a week or two ago and
[42:56] you know there's there's a lot of things
[42:58] that you know
[43:00] i just speak personally there's a lot of
[43:02] things in life that
[43:03] i was unaware of or i'll say it like
[43:05] this i was ignorant of
[43:08] and um you know i i got um
[43:12] to take the family to going down to
[43:16] a few spots and and along the way we
[43:18] were going to go see
[43:19] in indiana the tabernacle and
[43:23] before we left my mom had mentioned
[43:24] something to me and i was
[43:26] i was kind of a little bit um
[43:30] curious why she waited you know 40
[43:32] something years to tell me
[43:33] a little glimpse of our family heritage
[43:36] and
[43:37] and uh you know
[43:40] she had mentioned and said you know i
[43:42] couldn't put a good spin on it so i just
[43:44] kept it from you
[43:45] and you know i kind of i kind of could
[43:47] respect that
[43:48] but you know there's things in our life
[43:51] that
[43:51] you know sin had sold us into slavery
[43:55] into bondage
[43:56] and and we were ignorant but then the
[43:58] gospel light came
[44:00] amen and the truth is what sets us free
[44:03] amen so i want the i want the whole
[44:06] truth
[44:06] i want all that god has for me amen
[44:11] amen just kind of breaking into a little
[44:14] relaxation here
[44:18] in james chapter 2 it's right after
[44:21] hebrews
[44:31] the scripture says there and
[44:34] let's start in verse 14 it says what
[44:36] doeth the prophet my brethren
[44:38] though a man say that he hath faith and
[44:41] have not works
[44:42] can faith save him if a brother or
[44:46] sister is naked and destitute of daily
[44:48] food
[44:49] and one of you said to him depart in
[44:51] peace and be
[44:53] warmed and filled notwithstanding ye
[44:56] give him
[44:56] not those things which are needful to
[44:59] the body
[45:00] what do it that profit even so faith
[45:05] if it hath not works is dead
[45:08] being alone yeah a man may say
[45:12] thou has faith and i have works show me
[45:15] thy faith without the works and i'll
[45:17] show you my faith by my works
[45:20] thou believers that there is one god
[45:23] thou believeth well
[45:24] the devil also believeth and tremble
[45:28] but will thou know o thou man
[45:31] that faith without works is dead
[45:35] was not abraham our father justified
[45:39] by works when he had offered isaac his
[45:42] son
[45:42] upon the altar see us thou
[45:46] how faith wrought with his works
[45:49] and by works was faith made perfect
[45:53] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[45:55] saith
[45:56] abraham believed god and it was imputed
[45:59] to him for righteousness
[46:01] and he was called the friend of god amen
[46:04] praise the lord you may have your seeds
[46:07] you know it's just
[46:08] us being the faith seed we heard it this
[46:10] morning so wonderful the supersede of
[46:13] god
[46:14] the faith seed rising up and you think
[46:16] about how that
[46:18] you know and then there's another
[46:20] scripture before
[46:22] kind of launch out here in uh
[46:24] revelations
[46:25] chapter 12. in verse 11
[46:29] it says and they overcame him by the
[46:32] blood of the lamb
[46:33] and by the word of their testimony and
[46:35] they loved not their lives
[46:38] unto the death amen
[46:42] you know it's one of those things that
[46:43] when you look into the scripture
[46:45] you know the scripture sometimes you
[46:47] feel condemned
[46:48] you feel convicted like i'm not there
[46:50] yet but praise the lord the word is
[46:52] preached to call us up higher amen
[46:54] there's something longing in the
[46:56] believer's heart for something more
[46:58] you know god has already revealed to us
[47:00] that he's real
[47:02] but now we want to come to a place where
[47:03] the faith that we have now
[47:05] can be operated amen there's there's
[47:07] something rising up in the church of god
[47:10] today
[47:11] and that's god's wondering working power
[47:13] amen it's the love of god
[47:15] to be shed abroad in our hearts amen
[47:19] i got to thinking you know this
[47:22] was a powerful testimony that he was
[47:26] called a friend of god
[47:28] amen and i got to thinking about that
[47:30] and
[47:31] and i thought you know what i wonder
[47:34] what
[47:35] that that title
[47:38] or that position as a friend of god
[47:41] would represent
[47:42] amen something we would aspire to be
[47:44] right
[47:48] so sometimes if you look back and you
[47:50] can see
[47:51] you know how this thing got
[47:54] crossed and how and how it was lost you
[47:57] know
[47:57] and so i look back into the scriptures
[48:00] in genesis
[48:02] you know it's it and this is what the
[48:04] inspiration from
[48:06] a message brother brandon preached
[48:08] called the fundamental foundation for
[48:10] faith
[48:11] amen because we can't do anything that
[48:13] pleases god except to be by faith
[48:15] amen so god has to have a personal
[48:18] encounter with you
[48:20] amen you got to cry out god i
[48:23] need you right amen so now this
[48:27] this the the fundamental foundation for
[48:30] faith he said this
[48:32] he said no matter what state a man is in
[48:35] he is yet a son of god no matter how
[48:38] sinful he is
[48:40] how far away he is he is a fallen son
[48:44] but yet he is a son god is his creator
[48:48] god is his maker amen
[48:51] god created the devil at his angels amen
[48:54] so god has brought he has bought him
[48:57] with a price
[48:59] amen didn't he buy us with a price you
[49:01] know this is the thing this is we want
[49:03] to be those
[49:04] living epistles right of all men we
[49:06] don't want to have our
[49:08] you know noses up in the air if it rains
[49:10] then we all drown
[49:11] you know we want to have that humble
[49:14] life
[49:14] and love of christ that as we walk with
[49:17] that blessed lord
[49:19] fill my way every day with love amen
[49:22] we don't want it just to be a song that
[49:24] we sing in church
[49:26] we want it to be something pulsating
[49:28] from our very fiber of our being
[49:30] something that's beyond this human
[49:32] reasoning and senses
[49:34] something that god pours into us that we
[49:36] can't help but contain is bursting out
[49:39] like a fire that's
[49:40] wanting to spread amen
[49:43] there's something in us that is crying
[49:46] out
[49:47] you know because the scripture says as
[49:49] you've been freely given
[49:52] freely give it's like an emptiness if
[49:54] you have all this that's been given you
[49:56] freely
[49:57] and you're just sitting there carrying
[49:59] it boy it becomes kind of heavy after a
[50:02] while you gotta start giving some away
[50:05] amen god he said no
[50:08] faith is a gift of god lest any man
[50:12] boast i mean what a blessed people we've
[50:14] got an abundance of faith
[50:16] amen some people may be rich in this
[50:20] world's goods
[50:22] but the scripture says friendship with
[50:24] the world
[50:25] is enmity with god amen and one day
[50:28] we were alienated from god in our minds
[50:30] by wicked works
[50:32] but god who's rich in mercy amen thank
[50:34] god for his wealth of mercy
[50:37] hallelujah you love the lord tonight
[50:41] amen
[50:45] god has bought him with a price he may
[50:48] never
[50:48] reconcile himself to that
[50:53] see god placed man on free moral agency
[50:57] and and you know we we've received
[51:01] we've received that reconciliation amen
[51:04] we've accepted it now some may be in
[51:06] here saying
[51:07] well i'm on the fence well i just want
[51:09] to say tonight that
[51:11] you know the fence is on the devil's
[51:13] ground so we need to get serious tonight
[51:16] and say you know what whatever god you
[51:19] have for me
[51:20] let me forget about anything that the
[51:22] devil's dangled in front of me
[51:24] amen there's nothing greater than life
[51:32] you know god is re restoring
[51:36] divine fellowship in satan's eden
[51:39] you know there was going to be an
[51:40] accomplishment that god was going to
[51:42] have
[51:42] in the face of his enemy amen he's got a
[51:46] table spread and he says now
[51:48] this is this is a you've come here to be
[51:51] tested
[51:52] amen this is a little bit away from my
[51:55] notes so
[51:58] you know the very things that we go
[52:00] through in life
[52:02] is is not necessarily to prove
[52:05] uh to the neighbor but it's to prove to
[52:08] satan
[52:10] you've got the goods it's christ in you
[52:14] and that encourages the believer's faith
[52:17] you know what
[52:18] now god is restoring
[52:22] the friendship it's divine fellowship
[52:25] amen
[52:26] god's speaking you know you praying in
[52:29] your heart
[52:30] god i need this job i need a good report
[52:34] from the doctor
[52:35] i've been praying about this and god
[52:37] speaks back by confirming his word
[52:39] isn't that wonderful that's the kind of
[52:42] fellowship they're being restored to
[52:44] he said ask anything in my name and i'll
[52:46] do it
[52:48] amen what a privileged people we are
[52:54] so he may never accept it it may never
[52:57] do him any good
[52:59] but yet he's a son and he's a or she's a
[53:02] daughter of god
[53:04] and what did god put man here for
[53:08] that's a good question what did god put
[53:11] man here for
[53:15] now when he made god when god made man
[53:17] in the beginning he made him
[53:19] superior to anything on the earth
[53:22] he gave him jurisdiction over everything
[53:25] on earth
[53:28] and and he was to control everything
[53:31] he was to control the animal life the
[53:33] the the fowler
[53:35] the foul life the sea life he was to
[53:37] control the wind the plant life he was
[53:39] to control
[53:40] everything amen isn't he knocking
[53:44] you know we heard it this morning that
[53:46] super church
[53:47] amen all that christ was he poured into
[53:50] the church
[53:52] amen and now we can come under that
[53:55] expectation
[53:57] that god's going to declare a people
[54:01] that he's redeemed and that he's not
[54:03] ashamed to be identified with them
[54:06] that's my people they have my life
[54:09] amen
[54:12] man was made a secondary god on earth
[54:16] he was given power to control all things
[54:19] all elements of the earth
[54:21] that was adam adam was given
[54:24] these great powers but when these powers
[54:26] were given
[54:29] but then the power that he was given
[54:33] to make himself there
[54:36] he fell you know what there's something
[54:39] to be said about
[54:41] when somebody's been given a gift and
[54:44] i remember i had aspired to be an
[54:46] athlete and
[54:47] there was a gift or a talent you would
[54:49] say and well i had these dreams in the
[54:51] world
[54:52] and you know what that's what happened
[54:54] you see
[54:55] when he was given something to make
[54:58] himself
[55:00] it's it's almost like it reminds me of
[55:03] the scripture in genesis
[55:05] i was going through a little personal
[55:07] study and if you
[55:08] suffer me i'll just kind of share some
[55:11] things that are
[55:13] personal and
[55:16] it was it was you know in the fall see
[55:19] because we want to see where
[55:20] what we fall from and so to know what
[55:23] we're being restored to
[55:25] amen amen and so now in the scripture
[55:28] in in genesis
[55:32] chapter 3 and verse 15.
[55:41] we'll just back up one verse there it
[55:43] says and the lord god had said to the
[55:45] serpent because thou has done this
[55:47] cursed thou art cursed above all the
[55:49] cattle and above all the beasts and upon
[55:51] thy belly thou shall go and dust thou
[55:54] shall eat all the diaries of thy life
[55:56] and i will put enmity between thee and
[55:58] the woman
[55:59] in between thy seed and her seed and it
[56:02] shall bruise
[56:03] thy head and thou shall bruise his heel
[56:06] and brother branham said to bruise the
[56:07] heel was to make an atonement
[56:09] so now you see that there was actually
[56:12] going to be
[56:12] a fulfillment amen and we heard about
[56:15] the sign
[56:17] the virgin shall conceive he says
[56:20] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[56:22] multiply thy sorrows in thy conception
[56:25] and sorrow thou bring forth children and
[56:28] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[56:32] and he shall rule over thee and i got to
[56:35] thinking about that and
[56:37] you know it's the desire to be something
[56:40] sometimes you know it's it was through
[56:42] the the desire
[56:44] of knowledge and and our pastor was kind
[56:46] of saying that how
[56:48] you know even like stories of
[56:51] uh people and politics and how
[56:54] these these things that they've done now
[56:56] it's like the devil's
[56:58] kind to is seduce us and say come i'll
[57:00] tell you this hidden knowledge
[57:02] about their life and then it's like an
[57:04] intoxication you start going down that
[57:07] road and then your mind starting to go
[57:08] into this carnal realm about mankind and
[57:11] how unclean and how
[57:12] filthy they are and then it gets start
[57:15] tampering your own atmosphere and you're
[57:17] just saying
[57:18] man mankind is terrible and you know
[57:20] what that might be the case but
[57:22] the blood of jesus can cleanse the
[57:24] violence of sinner
[57:26] amen and so we don't want to pollute our
[57:30] thinking
[57:31] with those things we don't want to have
[57:33] friendship with the world we don't even
[57:35] want to lend our ear to any of the
[57:36] devil's nonsense
[57:38] amen help me lord to be in divine
[57:41] fellowship
[57:50] he says and unto adam because thou has
[57:53] hearkened to the voice of thy wife
[57:55] that i have commanded thee not thou
[57:58] shall
[57:58] not eat of it curse it is the ground see
[58:01] he didn't curse enemies it cursed is the
[58:03] ground
[58:04] in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the
[58:06] days of thy life thorn also and thistles
[58:09] shall
[58:10] bring forth to thee and thou shall eat
[58:12] of the herb of the field
[58:14] amen and in the sweat of thy face shalt
[58:17] thou eat bread
[58:18] till thou return and to the ground
[58:22] from out of winds thou has taken for
[58:24] dust out heart and dust thou shall
[58:26] return
[58:27] amen they got to thinking about how that
[58:29] you know the sin
[58:30] curse caused the sorrow you know
[58:34] and and one of the aspects of the curse
[58:37] for the woman is that
[58:38] she wouldn't want to come under headship
[58:41] now when i'm speaking i'm speaking of
[58:42] the church
[58:43] amen so you know you see what the curse
[58:46] has done
[58:47] is now the woman wants to lead the woman
[58:49] you know that's just
[58:50] part of the curse amen and for the man
[58:53] now
[58:54] is thinking about how that you know
[58:58] the the ground was cursed
[59:01] and he said in sorrow thou shalt eat of
[59:03] it all the days of thy life
[59:06] and you know it's it's just um you know
[59:09] it's
[59:10] it's kind of like in romans
[59:13] um chapter 1 and verse 21.
[59:18] just flip over to it real quick
[59:25] romans chapter 1 and verse 21 excuse me
[59:31] he says because thou because that
[59:34] they knew god they glorified him
[59:38] not as god neither were they thankful
[59:42] but became vain in their imaginations
[59:46] and their foolish heart was darkened
[59:48] professing themselves to be wise
[59:51] they became fools you know isn't that
[59:54] something
[59:55] that you know that's that's kind of the
[59:58] thing that
[59:59] brother branham was saying in this quote
[1:00:01] he said now
[1:00:02] adam when when he had power that he had
[1:00:06] given
[1:00:06] to make himself something isn't that
[1:00:09] man's nature to try to make himself
[1:00:11] something that he's not
[1:00:13] amen we're called to be sons of god and
[1:00:15] god has a provided way that's the new
[1:00:17] birth amen
[1:00:18] we must repent that repentance is the
[1:00:21] grace of god to you
[1:00:22] if you know in your heart you're not
[1:00:24] doing right and god's convicted you
[1:00:25] that's the grace of god to you amen
[1:00:28] he said repent and be baptized in the
[1:00:30] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:32] amen and you shall receive the holy
[1:00:35] ghost which is the new birth
[1:00:36] amen do i have a witness tonight
[1:00:40] that god keeps his word amen
[1:00:44] god's still filling with the baptism of
[1:00:46] the holy ghost because people are still
[1:00:48] being obedient to the word
[1:00:59] a little bit further in romans there it
[1:01:01] says and they change
[1:01:02] the glory of the incorruptible god
[1:01:06] into the image made like unto
[1:01:08] corruptible men
[1:01:10] into birds into four beasts and creeping
[1:01:13] things
[1:01:14] wherefore als god also gave them up to
[1:01:16] uncleanness through the lust of their
[1:01:18] hearts to dishonor
[1:01:20] their own bodies in between themselves
[1:01:24] and they changed the truth of god into a
[1:01:26] lie and worshiped and
[1:01:28] served the creature more than the
[1:01:30] creator
[1:01:31] who is blessed forever amen
[1:01:35] you know you think about the
[1:01:39] world that we live in you know you go to
[1:01:42] genesis and that was the seed chapter
[1:01:44] and you can look at the world and the
[1:01:47] churches and
[1:01:48] things how they are worshiping i mean
[1:01:51] you got
[1:01:52] i'm driving down to pick up something
[1:01:54] for the job and i see this
[1:01:56] you know booth and they're all set up
[1:01:58] and it's the association that
[1:02:00] you know is the voice for dogs
[1:02:03] we're the voice for dogs or animals
[1:02:07] you know and i just you know what
[1:02:10] the scripture in genesis and then we see
[1:02:12] it in romans i mean
[1:02:14] they're they're making their self
[1:02:15] something they're the voice for
[1:02:18] animals you know hey
[1:02:23] the scripture being fulfilled who this
[1:02:25] is the truth
[1:02:26] they turn the truth into a lion they
[1:02:28] worship and serve
[1:02:30] they are serving the creature
[1:02:34] come on i'm just
[1:02:37] i stand back in fellowship i'm in divine
[1:02:40] fellowship with god
[1:02:41] i don't have to get caught up in in
[1:02:43] taking up
[1:02:44] causes of animals and different things
[1:02:47] yeah don't destroy
[1:02:48] the earth yeah let's have respect for
[1:02:50] the creation of god but what about the
[1:02:52] word of god let's worship the creator
[1:02:54] let's serve the creator he's worthy to
[1:02:57] be served
[1:02:58] he's worthy of honor
[1:03:03] for this cause god gave them up to
[1:03:07] vile affections i mean i've seen him
[1:03:10] hugging up against the
[1:03:14] okay
[1:03:16] and even their women did change their
[1:03:19] natural use
[1:03:21] that which is against nature
[1:03:28] in verse 20 says even as they did not
[1:03:31] like to retain god in their knowledge
[1:03:34] god gave them over to reprobate mind to
[1:03:36] do
[1:03:36] those things that are not convenient
[1:03:38] amen and we're seeing that you know
[1:03:40] there's there's
[1:03:41] you know in the world people are just
[1:03:43] they're doing everything they can
[1:03:45] to keep you from testifying of your god
[1:03:49] they're they're trying to keep you from
[1:03:52] telling somebody else what god did for
[1:03:55] you
[1:03:57] god healed you there was a sin sickness
[1:04:00] that was
[1:04:01] for sure of death amen
[1:04:04] and he they're just trying to keep us
[1:04:06] silent keep us in that
[1:04:09] in between stage like he was saying this
[1:04:11] morning a little bit of this
[1:04:13] a little bit of god a little bit of the
[1:04:16] world
[1:04:17] but praise god we're we're feeling that
[1:04:19] there's a divine
[1:04:20] fellowship being restored and the very
[1:04:23] life and power and fire of god is
[1:04:25] starting to move and rise up in us
[1:04:28] amen we can feel it surging in us now
[1:04:34] you know that kind of relationship makes
[1:04:37] one not ashamed
[1:04:39] amen that kind of restoration was like
[1:04:41] when they were standing there naked in
[1:04:43] the garden and they weren't ashamed
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:52] my
[1:05:07] but then the power was given to himself
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:10] he fell and adam adam could speak the
[1:05:13] wind and it would stop
[1:05:14] and then he could speak to the trees and
[1:05:16] they would obey he could speak to the
[1:05:18] wildlife and they'd obey
[1:05:20] he could speak to the waters ever what
[1:05:22] it was everything obeyed adam
[1:05:24] now that is the beginning of man
[1:05:28] that's what god gave him power over
[1:05:34] everything on the earth
[1:05:37] now through the fall he lost that power
[1:05:42] then he becomes unconscious of
[1:05:45] the fact after losing his relationship
[1:05:49] friendship and fellowship with the
[1:05:51] father
[1:05:52] then he lost that and all the his great
[1:05:56] channels
[1:05:57] became clogged up he couldn't get
[1:06:00] through
[1:06:01] now what adam was in god christ is
[1:06:05] has redeemed us back to that amen
[1:06:08] isn't that the good news amen
[1:06:12] we were sold into slavery of sin
[1:06:15] and there was one who loved us
[1:06:19] with an elective love that was able to
[1:06:22] spread his hands
[1:06:23] out and pay the price of redemption amen
[1:06:26] what a public testimony what a public
[1:06:29] witness
[1:06:30] he showed his love for us amen
[1:06:34] the scripture says no greater love
[1:06:37] that a man hath for his friends that he
[1:06:40] would lay
[1:06:41] down his life amen and that same god is
[1:06:45] in you
[1:06:46] amen and you have friends
[1:06:49] and what christ was to you well what
[1:06:52] about your friends
[1:06:54] amen that's the super church
[1:06:58] that's the manifestation of this hour
[1:07:01] the same
[1:07:01] god that was living in jesus christ
[1:07:05] lived in a sheep wave that expressed and
[1:07:08] this wasn't done in secret his
[1:07:10] ministry went around the world seven
[1:07:12] times
[1:07:13] amen we have the pillar of cloud over
[1:07:15] there witnessing
[1:07:17] who was that he said that was our lord
[1:07:20] up there
[1:07:22] amen amen he's come he has an open book
[1:07:26] and now we have the privilege of dining
[1:07:30] at the master's table what a privileged
[1:07:33] people we are
[1:07:34] amen and to think that we had become
[1:07:37] unconscious
[1:07:38] of the fact of what we lost
[1:07:42] i'm wondering if we still have some of
[1:07:44] that amnesia trying to
[1:07:46] invade us
[1:07:52] no praise god i'm going to stay with
[1:07:55] christ
[1:08:01] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:08:05] bring it back
[1:08:06] to its original again and adam never had
[1:08:10] to be sick he never had to die he'd
[1:08:12] never had to worry
[1:08:13] he never had a headache he never had a
[1:08:16] fever
[1:08:17] he just climbed up into father's arms
[1:08:20] and just like a child everything is his
[1:08:24] and whatever he asked why he just got
[1:08:27] it everything obeyed him because he was
[1:08:31] a child of god and the child
[1:08:34] was heir of all things amen
[1:08:38] what what a restoration amen
[1:08:41] think of it
[1:08:44] now when man fell he lost this
[1:08:48] and now what he lost in the fall christ
[1:08:51] has come
[1:08:52] as a redeemer did you ever stop
[1:08:56] to think what christ redeemed us for
[1:09:02] i think if we just went down the pews
[1:09:04] and everybody
[1:09:05] personalize this question what
[1:09:08] did christ redeem us
[1:09:11] for we've fellowshipped a little bit
[1:09:14] about what was lost
[1:09:15] amen and what christ did when he paid
[1:09:17] the price
[1:09:19] now he wanted to restore the divine
[1:09:21] friendship and fellowship of god
[1:09:23] there's a relationship that you had and
[1:09:27] now he's wanting to bring it to
[1:09:29] manifestation again
[1:09:32] the super race the super church they
[1:09:35] have
[1:09:35] thus saith the lord and you can move
[1:09:37] with confidence when you got thus saith
[1:09:39] the lord
[1:09:41] you can go to the pope you can go the
[1:09:43] president you can go to anybody
[1:09:46] you're not ashamed
[1:09:55] that was to give us eternal life
[1:10:00] amen i mean
[1:10:03] my my and the scripture says
[1:10:07] about faith you know we're saved
[1:10:11] by grace through faith you know i heard
[1:10:14] brother brown say in one place that the
[1:10:16] blood doesn't save you
[1:10:18] but it was making atonement it keeps you
[1:10:20] clean but by
[1:10:21] faith are you saved amen you can go
[1:10:25] along and you can tell somebody
[1:10:27] all day long that jesus christ died
[1:10:30] jesus christ died on the cross to save
[1:10:32] them
[1:10:32] and they can sympathize with it but
[1:10:34] until they actually
[1:10:36] possess the resurrection and possess
[1:10:39] the death that they could just look at
[1:10:42] it and they can say i believe
[1:10:45] but now if you really believe something
[1:10:49] you can't hold back you start confessing
[1:10:53] it
[1:10:54] you start telling some folks you start
[1:10:56] testifying
[1:10:58] god saved me what are you talking about
[1:11:01] yeah
[1:11:02] the scripture says that he died on the
[1:11:04] on the tree he was
[1:11:05] cursed for me
[1:11:08] uh he did that for you
[1:11:12] oh my now that
[1:11:15] that kind of faith puts a man in action
[1:11:17] there's something that can't hold back
[1:11:19] the love that he's received
[1:11:29] he gave us everlasting life he brought
[1:11:31] us back
[1:11:32] to the eternal fellowship in
[1:11:34] relationship to god
[1:11:36] to be his sons and daughters again
[1:11:39] to restore back all that adam and lost
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:42] isn't that what the ministry of malachi
[1:11:44] 4 came to turn our hearts back
[1:11:46] to bring restoration praise the
[1:11:50] lord for fulfillment
[1:11:56] we certainly appreciate being able to go
[1:11:58] the tabernacle and
[1:12:00] kind of walk some of the places that
[1:12:01] brother branham
[1:12:03] went to and i tell you there's just uh
[1:12:06] something that happens you know when you
[1:12:08] go through those things
[1:12:10] uh it just becomes more of a a reality
[1:12:13] in some ways you you you realize how
[1:12:16] much
[1:12:17] you're a part of god amen amen
[1:12:21] you know there's an eternal part of you
[1:12:23] that just resonates
[1:12:25] now when you hear in the tapes there's
[1:12:27] there's something else
[1:12:28] you realize i was there you know because
[1:12:31] like that's what he said about you
[1:12:33] and christ he said you know you had to
[1:12:35] pay for your sins but you were in christ
[1:12:37] when he was on the cross that's where
[1:12:39] you paid for your sin
[1:12:42] and god's not judging you he judged your
[1:12:44] sacrifice
[1:12:45] that's the perfection that he desires us
[1:12:47] to to walk in we're not looking at our
[1:12:50] carnal way and our
[1:12:51] flesh but we're saying oh god take this
[1:12:53] from me i'm
[1:12:54] identified with the bleeding bloody word
[1:12:57] of this
[1:12:58] hour it has redeemed me it's brought me
[1:13:01] into divine fellowship
[1:13:02] now i can hear from god myself i know
[1:13:05] the prophet heard from god i've heard
[1:13:07] thus saith the lord and my
[1:13:08] heart anchors in truth and now
[1:13:12] take you at your word i believe that by
[1:13:16] your stripes i'm healed
[1:13:18] amen isn't it wonderful when he comes by
[1:13:21] and he
[1:13:22] pulls on your heart and he gives that
[1:13:24] that 25 cents and you say
[1:13:26] by his stripes i'm healed and you know
[1:13:29] that you know
[1:13:31] praise the lord
[1:13:37] to be a son or daughter again to restore
[1:13:40] back all that adam had lost
[1:13:42] now the thing is since he has restored
[1:13:45] man back to this place
[1:13:47] man has fallen man
[1:13:51] in the fallen has lost his conscience of
[1:13:54] what
[1:13:55] father put him here on earth to do
[1:13:59] my you know it's like
[1:14:03] yeah we're you know we're marching
[1:14:06] you know we got the orders wait a minute
[1:14:09] did we leave
[1:14:10] did we leave without our orders or
[1:14:12] marching orders no
[1:14:14] says now man when he fell he lost his
[1:14:17] conscience of what father put him here
[1:14:19] on earth to do
[1:14:21] in other words all the plumbing all it
[1:14:24] was
[1:14:24] in our brain the outlet the faith was
[1:14:28] all clogged up with
[1:14:29] business affairs with home life with
[1:14:31] domestic things
[1:14:33] hello hello
[1:14:36] i just was testifying to my wife this
[1:14:38] week
[1:14:39] i'm like all of this stuff you know
[1:14:42] and brother branham says it just right
[1:14:44] here that's clogging the channel of
[1:14:47] faith amen
[1:14:51] and it becomes so clogged until god
[1:14:53] can't operate
[1:14:54] through those channels that he had made
[1:14:56] man for
[1:14:57] amen but i just i say it like this
[1:15:01] in my life i i really treasure
[1:15:04] like never before a friendship
[1:15:08] you know and i realize young people
[1:15:11] you know if you're praying about a
[1:15:13] relationship
[1:15:14] with a daughter of god whether she's
[1:15:18] received where she's been reconciled you
[1:15:21] know you shouldn't even
[1:15:23] i don't even think it's worthy of
[1:15:24] consideration until someone's filled
[1:15:26] with the spirit
[1:15:28] you know i just think that those things
[1:15:30] are something that need to be
[1:15:31] thought of through prayerfully in
[1:15:34] consideration of
[1:15:35] of different things family and
[1:15:38] you know whether they'll serve the lord
[1:15:40] with you with
[1:15:41] you know the ministry god's called you
[1:15:44] to and so
[1:15:45] i just think you know
[1:15:51] how i got here adam praise the lord
[1:15:55] you know there there is something very
[1:15:57] special about a friendship
[1:15:59] you know and as you go through you
[1:16:02] realize
[1:16:03] you know the friends are the ones that
[1:16:06] you're
[1:16:07] that that really know you you know you
[1:16:10] you can confide into a friend and you
[1:16:13] can take them to the side you have a
[1:16:14] confidence
[1:16:16] that if you're hurting you know they're
[1:16:18] not just going to broadcast it on social
[1:16:20] media and run you down to the ground
[1:16:23] you know you just have a confidence that
[1:16:25] you know i'm going to share
[1:16:26] my heart with you and you'll pray
[1:16:29] through with the victory for me
[1:16:30] and with me amen and to think about
[1:16:34] how that god you know he he laid his
[1:16:37] life down
[1:16:39] you know i thought i thought my god you
[1:16:42] did that for me
[1:16:43] and now you're saying you're restoring
[1:16:45] me to this kind of fellowship this kind
[1:16:46] of relationship this
[1:16:48] kind of friendship i want to look a
[1:16:49] little bit more into what a friend is
[1:16:52] amen and so i got to thinking about that
[1:16:55] and it brought me to a few scriptures
[1:16:57] and
[1:16:58] you know this great thing that
[1:17:02] we're called to being the face seat of
[1:17:03] abraham you know in him having the
[1:17:05] testimony
[1:17:08] that he was a friend of god amen so his
[1:17:12] faith wasn't just the lip service faith
[1:17:14] i mean it you talk about his testimony
[1:17:18] i mean you know there's that word test
[1:17:20] in the beginning of a testimony
[1:17:21] so you know that's the greatest thing
[1:17:23] for the believer is the test
[1:17:26] you know we want to stand the test amen
[1:17:29] it may seem like your whole world is
[1:17:31] falling and the world is falling apart
[1:17:34] i mean we see the signs i mean
[1:17:37] they're going and they're headed
[1:17:39] headlong to an economical council and
[1:17:42] we see all of what's happening they're
[1:17:44] all coming under that headship
[1:17:46] amen but there's another people that are
[1:17:49] coming under another headship
[1:17:51] amen that he's having the preeminence
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:16] you know there in genesis 18
[1:18:19] you know you look at
[1:18:22] at the life and testimony of
[1:18:26] abraham and he says in verse 16
[1:18:30] he said and the men rose up from thence
[1:18:32] and looked toward sodom
[1:18:35] and abraham went with them to bring
[1:18:38] them on the way and the lord said
[1:18:41] shall i hide from abraham the thing
[1:18:44] which i do seeing that abraham shall
[1:18:48] surely become a great
[1:18:49] and mighty nation and all the nations of
[1:18:52] the earth
[1:18:53] shall be blessed in him for if i
[1:18:56] for i know him well that's that's a
[1:18:59] relationship right there
[1:19:00] amen god knew you amen
[1:19:04] you were in your father amen
[1:19:16] and the nations of the earth shall be
[1:19:18] blessed in him
[1:19:20] for i knew him and i will reckon
[1:19:24] i will come that he will command his
[1:19:27] children
[1:19:28] and his household after him and they
[1:19:30] shall keep
[1:19:31] the way of the lord and do justice and
[1:19:34] judgment
[1:19:36] and the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:19:39] that's
[1:19:39] which he hath spoken amen isn't that
[1:19:42] wonderful
[1:19:43] that god has such a confidence in you
[1:19:46] that he would entrust to you
[1:19:49] his spirit and there there would be such
[1:19:52] a relationship
[1:19:53] of fellowship that you just said oh i
[1:19:55] wouldn't want to do
[1:19:56] anything that displeased the lord and
[1:19:59] that you would be like david and have a
[1:20:02] harder repentance that if you did
[1:20:04] slip you would quickly come and say god
[1:20:06] forgive me i didn't mean to do that
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:20] praise the lord what a testimony
[1:20:23] and you know i got to thinking too as
[1:20:28] you know just share a little bit of what
[1:20:32] something that happened you know because
[1:20:33] sometimes people are looking for faith
[1:20:35] and
[1:20:36] and manifestation when when it's already
[1:20:39] happened you know it's like
[1:20:40] they said shouldn't have lies at first
[1:20:42] come and restored all things and they
[1:20:44] said well
[1:20:45] he he has come and he will come you know
[1:20:48] and yet you know we want to look to the
[1:20:51] scriptures to know that
[1:20:53] you know there's been a fulfillment and
[1:20:56] if we turn to
[1:20:58] revelations chapter 12. i just thought
[1:21:02] this might encourage you along the way
[1:21:09] seeing how god you know because we can
[1:21:11] look back and see what god has done
[1:21:14] and now in looking back we won't say
[1:21:17] well we're waiting for that to be
[1:21:18] fulfilled
[1:21:20] because it's already happened amen some
[1:21:22] people get confused and
[1:21:24] you know it's teaching that actually
[1:21:27] positionally places us
[1:21:29] amen the scripture says in verse 1 he
[1:21:32] says and
[1:21:33] there appeared a great wonder in heaven
[1:21:36] a woman
[1:21:38] amen and we know what the a woman
[1:21:40] represents in the in the spiritual it
[1:21:42] represents a church
[1:21:43] amen and there appeared to wander in
[1:21:46] heaven
[1:21:47] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[1:21:50] moon
[1:21:50] under her feet now brother branham began
[1:21:53] to teach about how that
[1:21:55] you know the sun was the perfect and and
[1:21:58] the moon doesn't have any light source
[1:22:00] of itself it was actually reflecting the
[1:22:03] light
[1:22:03] in the absence of the sun amen while
[1:22:05] there was darkness
[1:22:07] the moon carried the light amen that's
[1:22:09] what the church has done
[1:22:11] in his absence is they reflect it's not
[1:22:14] our own
[1:22:14] life it's the very life of christ amen
[1:22:17] so
[1:22:18] when you see that this woman was clothed
[1:22:21] with the sun
[1:22:22] and the moon was under her feet brother
[1:22:25] branham was speaking about how the the
[1:22:27] law
[1:22:27] had become fading out and this
[1:22:30] dispensation was passing
[1:22:33] amen and this this time now
[1:22:37] if we continue on it says and upon the
[1:22:39] head
[1:22:40] a crown of 12 stars amen what what a
[1:22:43] picture you know the
[1:22:45] prophet preached a message called
[1:22:47] revelation a book of symbols thank god
[1:22:49] that we're in fellowship
[1:22:51] that we can receive revelation that we
[1:22:53] can look into the word of god and see
[1:22:55] oh the prophet said that the twelve
[1:22:58] stars was the twelve apostles amen that
[1:23:02] was the very foundation
[1:23:03] it was upon the 12 apostles and the
[1:23:06] chief cornerstone amen
[1:23:08] so we can see oh god when we look back
[1:23:10] we can see
[1:23:11] now that was the church the
[1:23:14] jewish orthodox church amen we can look
[1:23:17] back and see that that's exactly what
[1:23:20] god was doing at that time and now in
[1:23:23] verse two it says and she began
[1:23:26] she being with child cried and travailed
[1:23:29] in birth and
[1:23:30] pain to be delivered amen and
[1:23:34] brother branham was talking about this
[1:23:36] in other words it was the roman
[1:23:38] empire now hunkering her down amen you
[1:23:41] know sometimes history repeats itself
[1:23:43] ever so often amen
[1:23:45] you see that there's coming a
[1:23:46] persecution for your faith the faith
[1:23:49] of this hour people will look at you and
[1:23:52] the things that brother branham taught
[1:23:54] they will say
[1:23:55] you don't have no right to say that
[1:23:59] well actually i do it's thus saith the
[1:24:02] lord
[1:24:04] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:24:07] not
[1:24:07] one word will pass away
[1:24:11] amen we're being restored to a
[1:24:13] friendship and a fellowship with god
[1:24:15] this is supreme authority this is
[1:24:19] the super church amen with the super
[1:24:22] faith
[1:24:23] the supersede of abraham are you
[1:24:26] thinking about this
[1:24:27] in in verse 3 it says and he appeared
[1:24:29] another wonder in heaven
[1:24:30] and behold the great red dragon
[1:24:35] having seven heads and ten horns and
[1:24:37] seven crowns
[1:24:38] upon his heads and we know that the red
[1:24:42] dragon was wrong
[1:24:44] amen that was the govern who put
[1:24:47] jesus christ to death he was hung on a
[1:24:51] roman
[1:24:52] cross amen so as we look in the
[1:24:55] scripture we can see plainly now that
[1:24:58] this is being fulfilled in that
[1:25:00] dispensation and the tale
[1:25:02] drew the third part of the stars of
[1:25:05] heaven
[1:25:06] and did cast them to earth and the
[1:25:08] dragon stood there
[1:25:10] before the woman which was ready to be
[1:25:12] delivered
[1:25:13] for to devour her as soon as she was
[1:25:16] born
[1:25:17] and that word tell was not necessarily
[1:25:20] like a forked tail
[1:25:22] like brother branham was saying it was
[1:25:23] that lie that he told
[1:25:26] they said well we have caesar as our
[1:25:29] king and that man saying he's the king
[1:25:33] well that lie actually prepared them
[1:25:37] to reject the messiah my
[1:25:42] my when we look back we can see
[1:25:46] the tail of the serpent he's already
[1:25:49] weaving it
[1:25:50] before fulfillment he was already
[1:25:52] weaving it
[1:25:53] oh my and the third part of the stars of
[1:25:58] heaven
[1:26:00] it says in the very jews
[1:26:05] this is out of a message uh questions
[1:26:08] and answers
[1:26:10] law having a shadow preached in 1954
[1:26:14] on oh 5 16 he says this now
[1:26:17] the very jews by the roman empire
[1:26:20] crucified the lord jesus and over
[1:26:23] two-thirds of the jews denied
[1:26:25] jesus christ the stars which were in
[1:26:28] heaven
[1:26:29] which did he did and
[1:26:33] if you and he said and he cast them to
[1:26:36] earth and the dragon stood before the
[1:26:38] woman
[1:26:39] which was ready to be delivered to
[1:26:41] devour her children as soon
[1:26:43] as she was to be as soon as it was to be
[1:26:46] born
[1:26:47] now you say the dragon had something to
[1:26:50] do with the jews certainly
[1:26:52] this jesus says he is the king
[1:26:56] we have no king but caesar is that right
[1:26:59] you see how the devil preparing them
[1:27:01] jewish hearts back there to deny
[1:27:04] christ jesus christ when he come
[1:27:07] can you see the devil denying hearts
[1:27:10] today
[1:27:10] to deny the power of the holy ghost when
[1:27:13] he come
[1:27:14] amen can't you see that the pattern is
[1:27:16] being repeated
[1:27:19] there's no need for divine healing we
[1:27:22] have
[1:27:22] doctors you see the the power of the
[1:27:26] holy ghost
[1:27:28] in the believer who's in divine
[1:27:30] fellowship with god takes god at his
[1:27:32] word
[1:27:33] and he goes lays his hands on the sick
[1:27:36] amen he believes that
[1:27:39] by the preaching of the word there's the
[1:27:41] casting out of devils
[1:27:44] it's setting the captive free amen it's
[1:27:47] providing all that we have need of
[1:27:59] now just exactly the same yet honest and
[1:28:01] sincere
[1:28:02] but if you're deeply sincere and seek
[1:28:05] after god
[1:28:06] like some of them jews did you'll walk
[1:28:08] right out
[1:28:09] and receive him anyhow amen that's right
[1:28:14] they don't care what the church said
[1:28:18] but it cast two-thirds of them to the
[1:28:20] ground and the dragons stood before the
[1:28:21] woman to devour the child
[1:28:23] before it was born now what government
[1:28:27] what power what stood before the woman
[1:28:30] the jewish orthodox church to devour
[1:28:33] jesus christ when he was born
[1:28:35] so that was the red dragon that was
[1:28:38] rome amen
[1:28:43] amen praise the lord don't you see that
[1:28:45] the pattern
[1:28:48] you know it's it's that same red dragon
[1:28:52] now if you go i'm kind of jumping around
[1:28:55] here
[1:28:59] praise the lord
[1:29:07] let's continue on a little bit here he
[1:29:10] says and she brought forth
[1:29:12] a man-child who was to
[1:29:17] have who was to rule over the nations
[1:29:20] with a rod of iron and her children was
[1:29:22] caught up unto god
[1:29:24] into his throne you know and brother
[1:29:28] branham said this he says now they
[1:29:30] failed to see
[1:29:31] his first coming to the gentiles
[1:29:35] amen they saw they said wait a minute he
[1:29:38] was to rule with the rod of iron
[1:29:41] amen now we we realize that there's
[1:29:43] three comings of the lord
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:48] let's just read that out of here
[1:29:54] so this is out of a message called the
[1:29:56] deity of jesus christ
[1:29:58] it says jesus comes three times
[1:30:01] he come the first time to redeem his
[1:30:04] church
[1:30:05] he comes the second time to receive his
[1:30:07] church
[1:30:08] and then he comes the third time with
[1:30:10] his church
[1:30:12] everything in threes but all one in
[1:30:14] christ and remember the first time
[1:30:17] to redeem his church in the second time
[1:30:20] to receive his church and the third time
[1:30:24] with his church king and queen amen so
[1:30:27] you think about
[1:30:30] you know that the the like the
[1:30:34] he was saying now
[1:30:44] what did he redeem us for amen we asked
[1:30:47] a question earlier
[1:30:49] as to give you life amen so he redeemed
[1:30:52] you to give you life
[1:30:53] that was the very life that was in the
[1:30:55] beginning you see christ when he came
[1:30:57] and never lived the day for himself
[1:31:00] amen he lived it for others there's
[1:31:02] times where we feel a little bit heavy
[1:31:04] on our stupid on our shoulders
[1:31:05] i'm wondering if we're in divine
[1:31:07] fellowship with god
[1:31:10] amen it doesn't take much it just says
[1:31:12] lord i need divine fellowship
[1:31:15] there's been an atonement made that has
[1:31:17] broken
[1:31:18] the middle wall petition the veil was
[1:31:21] cut it was rent now i see
[1:31:23] jesus face to face amen the word has
[1:31:26] been revealed
[1:31:31] praise the lord
[1:31:36] you know i just i just feel to encourage
[1:31:38] each one of us you know
[1:31:40] a testimony you know is what god has
[1:31:42] done for us
[1:31:43] you know it's like i was saying with you
[1:31:45] know it takes faith
[1:31:47] in order to be saved god has to give you
[1:31:50] the revelation that he died and you're
[1:31:53] in fellowship with him now because of
[1:31:54] what he's done for you
[1:31:56] amen and so now it's i wanted to
[1:31:58] encourage
[1:31:59] what god has done to you by speaking to
[1:32:02] your heart
[1:32:03] now we're just become witnesses of his
[1:32:06] power to save to redeem
[1:32:08] to restore amen i was just testifying
[1:32:12] or or witnessing and hearing testimonies
[1:32:16] you know it's when when you're
[1:32:18] testifying your life's testifying
[1:32:21] that people begin to inquire i know that
[1:32:23] you're you're
[1:32:24] uh the fellowship that you have the
[1:32:26] church that you go to
[1:32:27] they believe in a god that has power
[1:32:29] that's not dead amen
[1:32:30] that's what's the drawing card is the
[1:32:32] fulfillment of christ in you
[1:32:34] that's the hope of glory amen when the
[1:32:37] the devil tries to dangle some kind of
[1:32:39] worldly carrot let's just shun that
[1:32:41] thing
[1:32:42] i don't need that my the value of having
[1:32:45] divine fellowship with god is so much
[1:32:47] greater than anything that the
[1:32:48] friendship of the world can offer
[1:33:00] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[1:33:03] where she had a place prepared
[1:33:06] of god that she should be fed her
[1:33:09] a thousand and two hundred three score
[1:33:12] amen and just thinking about how that
[1:33:15] that roman church you know brother
[1:33:18] branham said this he said now
[1:33:22] when he returns he shall rule
[1:33:25] all nations he will come
[1:33:29] and isn't a he isn't upon his throne now
[1:33:32] he is setting on god's throne he
[1:33:35] overcame
[1:33:37] he that overcomes shall sit with me in
[1:33:38] my throne
[1:33:41] as i have overcome and set on my
[1:33:43] father's throne
[1:33:45] america was established at plymouth rock
[1:33:48] for one purpose
[1:33:49] freedom of religion is that right and
[1:33:52] the bible said that
[1:33:53] she fled from the dragon
[1:33:57] and had a place prepared
[1:34:00] in what a wilderness
[1:34:05] what was america when she come here see
[1:34:10] where she was nourished for a limited
[1:34:13] time a time
[1:34:15] and a dividing of time just about 165 or
[1:34:20] 70 years where she had a place prepared
[1:34:24] and then the nation raised up and formed
[1:34:28] images of beast and spoke like the beast
[1:34:31] did
[1:34:31] at the confederation of organized church
[1:34:34] religion
[1:34:36] now the church is getting she
[1:34:39] can't have her freedom no more that's
[1:34:42] where the church is getting where she
[1:34:43] can't have
[1:34:44] freedom no more we had over a year of
[1:34:45] that right i mean
[1:34:48] i mean we just want to see where the
[1:34:51] you know what the enemy is trying to do
[1:34:53] again he's trying and he's
[1:34:56] he's done dupe the world
[1:34:59] but thank god the elect can't be
[1:35:01] deceived
[1:35:03] amen we got the ego anointing amen
[1:35:08] blessed are your eyes that see praise
[1:35:11] the lord
[1:35:22] praise the lord why don't we stand
[1:35:25] just feeling just kind of winded up here
[1:35:29] you know it's it's a it's a it's a thing
[1:35:31] to be in fellowship with god
[1:35:33] you know
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:36] i feel it's a late hour and the enemy is
[1:35:39] trying to make us luke warm and cold
[1:35:41] and to make our our our lives feel
[1:35:44] insignificant when it comes to the
[1:35:46] economy of god amen but your life
[1:35:49] matters
[1:35:50] amen it's the life of christ in you that
[1:35:52] makes your life valuable
[1:35:53] amen he paid the price he so loved you
[1:35:57] even if it was just you you still would
[1:35:59] have died i mean we have such a personal
[1:36:01] god and his friendship and fellowship
[1:36:04] he's calling out he's knocking
[1:36:07] is there something in the way of that
[1:36:09] friendship and fellowship tonight
[1:36:11] i just say as we bow our hearts and our
[1:36:14] heads together
[1:36:15] if if there's something in your heart
[1:36:17] that you feel is holding you back from
[1:36:19] divine fellowship
[1:36:21] you want to just lay it on the altar of
[1:36:23] god tonight and ask him oh god
[1:36:25] send the cleansing blood lord there's
[1:36:28] there's nothing more valuable than that
[1:36:31] divine fellowship
[1:36:33] that i can speak to you my heart's
[1:36:35] desire the needs that i have
[1:36:38] and you can speak back by confirming
[1:36:40] your word
[1:36:41] by manifesting by the power of the holy
[1:36:44] ghost
[1:36:45] amen i believe it pleases god that if
[1:36:48] there's something in our way
[1:36:50] that we repent it's the grace of god to
[1:36:53] us amen
[1:36:58] let's pray heavenly father lord god
[1:37:01] surely
