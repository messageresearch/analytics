Description:
Wednesday Evening Service: November 17, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

fellowship around the word of god coming out of great meetings fathers we just our hearts are thrilled and we're just asking you to stand in your word tonight and bless the people in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn over to the gospel of saint john the 14th chapter and the 19th and 20th verse and so it's going to be hard for me to match the meetings but the only match for the meetings is the word itself amen did you hear when the prophet of god said it just thrilled me he said the only thing that can draw the oil to the wick and make the light is the spirit himself amen so we're just going to fellowship we're going to kind of read some quotations out of the message sirs would we see jesus the one that was preached and let me see if i can get the date so the brothers can find it and um it's the one that's i believe is preached in phoenix uh yeah it's it knows the one that's preached in dallas texas 6 64 0304 dallas texas we'll read some statements and just have a wonderful time of fellowship and the lord will try to move right on this evening 14th chapter the 16th birth i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever so he's going to provide something that will give us comfort now i'm going to approach this just from a little different viewpoint of it just being a feeling or a sensation or an anointing okay that is all still true that you feel the presence but there's i want to talk about another aspect of that and what we're talking about is seeing jesus isn't that what kind of the consensus was after the meeting everybody wants to see the lord visibly in our midst or tangibly in our midst well how are we going to do that i think brother brown really shows that to us in this message he says so he's going to give us a comfort even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not so the world can't receive it because they can't see him they see it him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so if the world can't see it there is something that we're going to see okay so this is what he's saying as he unfolds the world can't see it they can't believe it but you will be able to see it by this comforter that i give you and what is the thing that we're supposed to do in this age what's one of the three things eyes have right that we might see gold tried and fire white raymond so so now we're we're just talking here about the eyes have something that god's going to give us in this age that allows us to see because that's what we're crying out for we want to see jesus we want to know god's in our midst we want to see him working well there's a way that that that it transpires and i i there's no way that uh in my infinite mind that i'll really be able to express it so if you let this comforter uh open it to you individually he says they don't know him but he shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you so this is part of the comfort i'm trying to break away from the idea that the comforter is a one-time anointing or an experience that you say i've got the holy ghost well that's good because you have the holy ghost you should be able to see him when he comes without this spirit you won't be able to see him when he comes and remember that was the reason we wanted our lamps trimmed because he said if you if you don't have your lamps trim when he's at hand you won't see him i'm sorry to keep you going i should just read it but it it excites me a little while yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you see me because i live we a lot of times we just jump over to the ye shall live also but you're not seeing them because you shall live also you're seeing him because he what he lives so he's got to have a way that he lets you see him because the world can't but you can so you've got something in you that allows you to see him that they can't see okay so that's beautiful and ye shall live also amen lord bless his word you may be seated so this is just to encourage our faith because without faith we know it's impossible to please god and god was saying when i come to earth will i find faith now we're not talking about power or demonstration maybe i could put it in this context for tonight's service when i come to earth will i find people that can see me and recognize me and see what i'm doing and have i sab if that's what he's saying will i be able to find people that are in tune with me because i am going to come to promise i'll not leave you comfortless i will come again to you that now he's saying when i make that coming will there be a people that sees it or and if they they see it they believe it now the world can't believe it they see it or they see something but because they don't know what it is they disbelieve it and the minute you disbelieve it then your eyes are darkened and so so we're we're talking about our meetings and what it generated in us well what it generated in us was an enthusiasm and an excitement that god is going to be moving in our midst and the things that we were praying for the things that we are asking for are are we're anticipating to see those things coming to pass that's good i hate to live with no hope or no expectation or with a blinders on that when god come in or mixed we wouldn't recognize them and so we understand and this is what we want to just read and fellowship together that we want to seek god we want to see god we want to see the lord jesus made tangible in our midst so if it's tangible enough that it becomes reality to us in other words we can see it we can touch it we can know it and yet it still remains untangible to somebody else so we have seers and unseers i guess i guess that's a word and unseer the word for that i think is blind right so we have those that spiritually have what eyesight and then we have those that are blind who in other words got to do something in their midst because they cannot look to the unseen now remember that we're talking about because we're talking about he said i'm going to go away and the world they won't see me but i'm going to come to you in an unseen form i'm going to come in an unseen form so i'm going to be there and it's not going to be seen with the natural eye it's only going to be seen with the eye of revelation so in other words it it's not going to be anything that's generated within the natural part of man but god's going to supply a spirit or like some of these glasses that they have in the world that you can't see it and then you put the glasses on and it does something with the colors and then you see it so he's going to give you i sav that's going to make you to be able to see what is unseen so that's what you look to you look for an unseen present presence something that's not in the realms of seed taste touch smell feel or emotion it takes a what a sixth sense and that sense comes from revelation okay now we so many times think that revelation is a conclusion that we've drawn from our thought process the scriptures fall in line and and you get it and all of a sudden you say okay that that really looks i see that well just because you see your own conclusion doesn't mean it's a revelation a revelation is given because it's something that you can't see or understand in the natural now that's god's gift to you that's how he's going to give you comfort not by a sensation not by a run or shout well i'm going to give to you something that's going to allow you to see me when i come now we saw that manifested didn't we he's here oh wonderful so let's just walk through it for maybe the next 30 minutes and just lift our faith up because that's what we want to do is we want to see jesus so we want to know what are we looking for or how does he and so he comes god does everything by promise right so peter said it's by these exceedingly great and precious promises that we become partakers of divine nature so the ability and the grace and the mercy and the eye salve and the comfort that god is going to give you is to be able to understand that's what seeing means understand the way he works and the way he reveals himself because it's not if i i just don't know how to say this so correctly but it's not us anticipating a certain end and then calling that him okay in other words he could be there doing something and it not be what you're expecting you understand so in this message i can't go through at all but in this message and he speaks it in in also in in 63 and different places he said the reason they missed jesus is it wasn't what they expected right they already had a preconceived idea of what he was going to do so because they they they had a preconceived idea of what he was going to do or how he was going to do it or how he was going to come they missed it but how did he come he came exactly according to what he promised god is only seen in his promises you're not going to find him outside of his what word because he's revealed in his word he's so in other words you could see an outcome and not see him now pretend i'm invisible how many can do that terrible that we're so bound by eyesight right all right i'm invisible and you don't see me right but this car guitar moves from here to here now you see that the guitar moved but we just don't want to see that the guitar moves our revelation that we're looking for is what moved it how did it move what caused this result that's what spiritual isaf is going to give us right so if if i so if i promised you i was going to move that guitar from there to there there would have to be a way that you could recognize that it moved from there to there so why did it move from there to there not because i carried it or you saw me carry it but because i promised it so you could say how did that guitar get from there to there god promised it so when i find it there i know i saw him because you can only see him in his promises all right so let's talk about some of the fathers of our faith noah noah didn't need to see rain to know that he had spoken to god you understand in other words god promised him it was going to rain he knew he spoke to god he didn't need to see rain to know that he spoke to god he didn't need that he knew he spoke to god he knew what that that conversation that he had with god was real so he knew that and i don't know what no one knew or how it was going to flood or it's going to rain or what his conception of rain was but when it rained noah saw god in the rain he saw the hand of god he saw god moving so it was a promise no one knew that he saw but when he saw the rain now god became tangible in the rain he could sit in the rain and say this is god i'm touching i'm feeling i'm seeing god because god revealed in his word why is that important to us because if we know the promises then that's where we look for him we look for him in his promises we look for him to become tangible in his word amen abraham didn't need to see a change in sarah to know he talked to god i i imagine he had all kinds of imaginations how it was going to come to pass in fact he even tried sarah's program right maybe this work and so in one sense we come up with ways for god to do things okay but this is our comfort a little while the world won't see me but you shall see me because i go to the father and he he will lead you and guide you into all righteousness you shall see me because i live in other words the comfort is that god is going to open the eyes and the heart of his elected to see him when he is manifesting himself in the fulfillment of the word that's my comfort in others i don't have to figure out how he's going to do it but he promised me that he would let me see him in the fulfillment of his promise to riot so mary didn't need to talk to be with a man she didn't need to have anything she she said i'm not having him in with any man she said that what shall be conceived in you shall be of the holy spirit she didn't need anything she said let it be done according to thy word so when it transpired in her she knew that she'd seen god god is going to take the imagination away from us when we know how to see him he he brings god interprets his word by what bringing it to pass that's how he interprets his word so that how he interprets a promise to you is by bringing it to pass and what he allows you to see is him bringing it to pass not according to your understanding or not according to your expectation what the promise is you shall see me because i live you'll see me because i keep my word you shall see me because i interpret my word and bring it to pass because you are my elected because you are my chosen because you have i sav because the comforter came to you and put a pair of spiritual glasses on you you shall see me when i'm there fulfilling the word think of that so we've got a promise so when we see these great and precious promises to coming to pass we can see god let's just read a few statements and and and because that's what we want to see he's seen in the fulfillment of what he promised right so you know what he promised when you when you ask for something and when it comes to pass you know it's him right you say oh this i i i read this promise and i believed it and i'm looking in expectation for this to come to pass you see we look for the specific manner but that's hid from the wise and prudent what's revealed is how he brings even what you asked for to pass according to his divine will he never just does it to do it prophet of god says god's got a purpose in everything he does he has a purpose in healing you just think of that it's not just a blanket god's a healer i get well you can get well and still miss god you want to know why what's what's coming to pass i want to see him i'm not looking for a a prescription promise or a letter promise i'm not looking for me to take an experience that i have and then go find a scripture or a saying to attach that feeling or experience to we're moving up these are sons and daughters of god now who are walking in the promises of god who only are looking for him in his word not looking for him in emotion not looking for him in experience they're looking to what did he say would transpire in my age he send me a comforter that's going to let me witness it so i'm not testing myself i don't create a test of my faith all right if i don't get healed by december 22nd no no no i got a promise god promised me that i would see it when it happened and no it's him did noah need reigns did abraham need to change in sarah did mary need any type of experience prophet of god said she believed the word of god without one single sensation or seeing any sign [Music] of it whatsoever she wasn't looking for a program she was looking for the comforter the spirit's promise to us that when he brings it to pass you would see it that's the comfort that we have that's the comfort he's not going to leave me out i call you friends because a friend knoweth what he does i didn't quote that scripture very well but that's the scripture that that we understand what he's saying you're going to see me when i come and fulfill my word amen sirs we would see jesus what did jesus point him to when he came and they asked him he pointed them to a promise that was going to be fulfilled and if they could see it that's where they would see him because he only shows himself in his promises we don't have to make the promise come to pass now i'm going to read a few things because a lot of people get confused about healing but this is what he says this is paragraph 11 on page two of sirs where we see jesus he says now healing is of god alone can can we find that and put it on the board um i don't know if the date helps you or or not but what happened okay we got crashed software it don't matter right you can go home and read it yourself and i'm not a very good reader but you read it yourself and now healing is of god alone god alone has purchased for us our healing now we don't know how but he purchased it now listen to our part it's up to us to do everything that we can in our life and in every way that god has given us for our healing people put themselves in a test if i take medicine i don't believe it if if i go get an operation he said do everything that you can okay why because when he comes you understand and performs it he promised you that you would see it that you would see it's him you do everything that you can to have a child you do everything that you can to get better you take everything that man has got to offer but when god comes and does the work according to his promise he promised that you would have something in you that could see it oh that's maturity you're not setting yourself up for failure you're not you're not saying if i had faith i wouldn't take this medicine because god healed me no when god heals you he promised you he'd let you know you don't need to see anything when you believe that god healed you i just don't want to miss it when he does it the way he does it amen am i making myself clear okay he said but it's god that heals if god calls you to go home tonight there isn't enough medicine in the world that will keep you here there is nothing going to keep you here and if he determines you to stay on earth no matter how many physicians say you're going tonight you're not going so it's just all up to god hallelujah so my quest isn't what god's gonna do or what's up to god or how that he's going to do it i just want to see him when he does it and how am i going to do that i can identify it by the word oh if we could get as simple brother abraham talks about why god wrote the bible just the way he wrote it just the way he said it so let's just go on god is life life eternal in the beginning was god he wasn't god at first he wasn't god at that time because god in the english word god means object to worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him he was the eternal just the eternal one there was no moon no stars no angels no nothing but in the beginning that we call god our father was attributes and in him was attributes to be father in him was attributes to be god in him was attributes to be son in him it was attributes to be savior in him it was attributes to be a healer and all these things that we see now is just displaying his attributes so what are we seeing we're seeing it come to pass the moon the stars in this is what god being father creator that attribute coming to pass so we see it as god because we have the promise and the comforter and the isab the world jesus is what science poor people they can't see god but god gave you a comfort that when you look at it you see god amen when they look at it they see some latin name and try to figure out how far away it is remember the little boy in the boat we're just going to go through this quickly all these are sermons within themselves now if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning had no end so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of god's thinking before there was anything but him okay so if that's all true and he knows what his thoughts were towards you he knows what your determined end is we're not worried about that you understand that's not what we're looking for we're looking to see him present tense in our midst fulfilling his promises and his word we're laying to rest our future because that way we're trying to see him in the future or we're trying to see him in the past but we're missing what he's doing what now i want to see him now so we know that he is in our midst fulfilling everything that he promised to do he's moving the guitar okay my prayer is and my promise is that the comforter will let me see that the guitar has been moved according to his word and i recognize it as god so if we're going to start looking for him where are we going to look for him in his word in his promised word we're not we're not creating a situation that he has to come according to your specifications and then call it god we don't have to do a thing amen he said pray for isaac that thou mayest see were we able to get something there okay now let's read paragraph 14. your form your shape and what you're in now your form your shape what you're in now is just a negative when you come up to around 20 22 years old you were a negative and death develops the picture to the positive oh man this is just a negative right a negative's like you know you have a telephone pole and the light shining on the pole and you've got the shadow he said the shadow's the negative the shadow tells you there's a telephone pole somewhere okay so he's saying that this is just a negative so this is telling us there's a body somewhere well what develops the negative is death we're not afraid of death all's death for us is is if we were to go that way is a promise being fulfilled oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory i have a crown laid up for me oh that's beautiful isn't it that's when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one all ready waiting so you see the things that were taking off the table to worry about to look for we know the rapture will come we know we'll be a part of it we know our names are written on the lamp book of life we're looking for his soon appearing but we want to see him tangible in our midst we want to see him fulfilling all the prophecies and signs that he's spoken about us and about what he promised that's the comforter promised us that we would see i will come again and you shall see me i will send you the comforter he will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and you shall see me that's all i'm looking for i'm looking for him to reveal himself performing his word in the hour i'm living just a few more statements and we'll close this evening this he says this just the display now it shows what's being done like god becoming god when he created angels so he's showing what's being done okay i i hope that i can only read it and hope that it comes to your heart he become son when he created jesus christ he becomes savior when jesus died he become healer when he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed see he you see what he's doing he's doing all these things he's fulfilling his word he said all these things are attributes of god just so that in the end the bible says jesus said you will know that i am in that i am in the father and the father in me and i in you and you and me that's god becoming tangible that's how you know he's tangible because you see him in what he promised now all of you are a strong enough message to believers to take this right to malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. revelations 10 7. thank you all right we've seen god fulfill his word that was god be tangible but along with that there's many other personal promises in your life where he becomes personal to you and you see him it's god becoming tangible your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow a negative of god and his wife the church see it's just god's attributes being displayed in shadows and types like the old testament in the new testament then in the end it all winds up god tangible god in christ tangible made flesh dwelt among us and in the great millennium to come god in the form of christ sits upon the throne of david and the church his bride husband and wife together why it's the most it's enough to set your heart of the believer on fire in these great hours that we're living in when all hope and nations and everything else is crumbling on us under us we got a kingdom that we are baptized into this kingdom so what do you have now can you imagine not seeing this world crumbling apart that all your hope is in buildback better or the great new deal or the great society many more things can we talk about that everybody's promising us it'll get better wait a minute it don't matter if it gets better because my comforter is going to let me see when he's here i will come again the comforter is going to let me see his appearing it's going to open my eyes that i see i see him i see it i see him in the failure of the world i see him i see his word i see him it doesn't matter what anybody promises we say this but let me see jesus how do i see him in the fulfilling of his word that's what i want to see let me see the promise and then let me see you fulfilling that promise that's what makes them tangible how many believe god's doing all kinds of things so that's why he counseled us by of me i sav that thou mayest what see pray for revelation pray for sight not for theology not for a greater vocabulary to express and understand the mysteries but to literally see him fulfilling his promise then you can say that is god that's him i've seen them tangibly the world don't see it they have nothing in them to see it with but you have something to see it with why because he gave you the eyes to see glory paragraph 20. now i'm sure to any believer it would be the most thrilling thing in his heart a confirmation of his faith that if he could actually see and know that he was standing in the presence of jesus christ right that's what thrills our heart that we're actually standing in the presence of jesus christ so he now we're looking to the unseen right i haven't lost my mind have i okay so if you see that guitar go from there to there you're standing in the presence of jesus christ if that was the promised word the world don't see it they don't feel it but how do you know it's him because he gave you something to see it with that's your comfort i see it i see him bringing it to pass i see the word i see malachi 4 5. you know why you see malachi 4 5 the comforter let you see it he promised that you would see him when he came and all the other scriptures luke 17 30 and those great scriptures they met i think it would be the most astonishing thing that any person any believer could think of is to know and no positive that keeps standing right in the presence of the lord jesus christ his solemn judge his redeemer and will be his judge at the end of judgment and let's just go turn if we can now in in closing over to paragraph 99 he says but notice he only comes to those who are looking for him he will only heal tonight those who are looking for him to heal he will only save those who are looking to be saved he's only looking he's only the only ones that are going to see him are those who are looking for the fulfillment of the promise they're not giving god a plan a fulfillment plan everybody wants to give you a retirement plan everybody wants to tell you how to invest your money everybody's got a program god's got one program that's his word now let me say this over and over again because i want you to know where your comfort is your comfort is that he promised to let you see it you're not going to miss it my sheep hear my voice another they will not follow all that the father hath given me will come that's what takes all the big eyes and the little yous out of it amen you're a part of what he's doing by him showing you that his words coming to pass don't you don't have to look for some kind of work to go do all you do is look for the promise when we pray for somebody we pray for somebody under one auspices only he said if we lay our hands on the sick they shall recover what do we do we lay our hands on the sith we don't give them a date we don't give them a method we don't give them the circumstance in which we can see and understand we know one thing and one thing only we fulfill the word when he brings that word to pass he's going to let us see it amen hallelujah and we're going to praise him for it satan is the author of confusion he keeps wanting to get us to have a part of it our only comfort is he said he would come to fulfill his word and he told me i would see it so i can what wait on him and rest let's just go and then read these last few paragraphs and it's beautiful and i hope this all lays it out paragraph 110 he's telling the story of the woman at the well so we know the message he's saying would you want to see jesus so now he's going to tell them this is promised in the last day the son of man so if you're going to see him you're going to see him fulfilling what he promised and the son of man ministry was promised for our day so they're sitting there we weren't there we some of us were born some of us weren't but it wasn't the promise that we would have to see him then the promise was we would see him where we are every word that pertains to you god is going to let you see so pick a promise your children god's going to let me see it come to pass when how i not my problem wasn't abraham's problem abraham didn't need to see and change in sarah to know that god spoke to him he built baby furniture he testified oh sarah how do you feel praise god i know god spoke to me i know he's going to let me see it when it comes to pass paragraph 110 he said you have said right you have had five and the one you're living with now is not yours now what is god doing he's letting her see the messiah that's that's all we want to do we want to see him that's our promise lord let me see you today however you're fulfilling your word not going to worry about tomorrow the evil of today is sufficient i want to see you i promise to see you now watch this woman notice and her in that condition i'm i'm staying too long too long her in that condition knowed more about the real bible the real bible the real bible is jesus bringing his promises to pass and his elect seeing it that's the real bible this book blinds people but his spirit right because i live you shall live also in other words what are you living in you're living in the present reality of seeing jesus fulfill his word and giving you eyes out no more about the real bible than a big bunch of preachers does today as soon as he sees she might have thought that it was just a man seeing her condition she wanted wanted to get smart with him or something and she said i have no husband he said that's also right you've had five and the one you're with now is not your husband quickly that predestinated seed laying in her heart caught fire hasn't your seat caught fire right now watch this story okay the predestinations caught fire she turned and said sir i perceive that thou art a prophet we ain't had one for 400 years you know we know oh dallas don't miss this we know we're looking for a messiah who is called the christ and when he comes this is what he is going to do this will be a sign jesus said i am he that speaks to you what did he do for that predestinated seed let them see who it was fulfilling his word sirs we would see jesus we can say that today sirs or everybody in here we are promised that we would see jesus sirs we would see jesus how about if i took the word wood and put the word will. sirs brethren elected predestinated we will see jesus tangible in our hour i am he that speak it with you upon that she dropped the water pot and into the city she went said come see a man who told me what i've done isn't this the very messiah and the bible said that they believed jesus because what the woman said now that's the way he identifies himself as being messiah not because of the way he dressed by his education by the fellowship card or by his honor among men god was in him manifesting the word that he promised you can't see him without a promise you can't look for him unless you believe the promise and if you believe the promise all you have to do is wait because he promised he would let you see it come to pass that is beautiful he promised he would let you see it come to pass abraham believed god and believed god was able to perform that which he promised mary believed god and believed god was able to perform that which he promised abraham i mean noah believed god and did everything according to his instructions because he knew god would let him see it come to pass that's our comfort don't judge yourself look he preached that you know look and see you've got a promise let's just close down he said in john 5 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are are that testify or tell you who i am okay the promises tells you who he is so that's how you know who he is same yesterday today and forever my brother my sister you're a lovely audience you could talk all night you see what jesus was then he was manifested he was god manifested in a man called jesus christ which is the son of god promising as it was in the days of noah every other sense said exactly so shall it be at the coming of the son of man he is the same yesterday today and forever old church don't is does that stare but believe on the lord jesus christ sirs we would see jesus if he's the same yesterday today and forever would you like to see him sir how would you look for him if he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll do the same no man could come up here he said now a man could come up here with nail scars in his hands blood and smoke and oil running out of them that wouldn't make it any hypocrite can do that certainly but what it is is the manifestation of this promised word that's what we want to see he was god anointed prophet he was he was the god prophet he was what all the prophets was it was in him plus the rest of what god was god was in christ reconciling himself to the world he was god emmanuel the fullness of the god made known to us in the person of his son jesus christ the second attribute of god the second attribute of god that's a statement so what was the first attribute of god god himself amen in the beginning was the word right and the word was with god and the word was god and the second attribute was that word being manifested the first attribute was all that god was the second attribute was the expression of all that god was that would be a wonderful sermon wouldn't it but i just believe it now notice he's alive today he is not dead he is alive he said a little while and the world cosmos the world order will see me it's double e see me no more yet ye shall see me for i is a personal pronoun i will be with you even in you till the end of the world and at the end of the world when these scriptures is to be fulfilled what are you going to do you're going to what see because the comforters is going to let you see he promised he would come and he promised you would see so a lot of times we always think that the holy spirit as some sort of sensation but many will come in that day and say lord lord didn't i do this and he said depart from you you were iniquity i never knew you and yet here's a little woman with the predestinated seed and she sees the fulfillment of the scriptures and that's what's accounted to her for righteousness abraham saw god and it was imputed to him for righteousness because all the way down it's he said i'll be with you even in you till the end of the world or at the end of the world when these scriptures is to be filled all the way down it's been god who we believe on in luther's age who god who shouted in wesley's age god who spoke in tongues in the pentecostal age he is coming right down before the promise some comes to prove his scriptures all scriptures has got to be fulfilled sirs we would see jesus sirs we will see him amen lord let me see give me i said let me don't doubt give me revelation i'm looking for you in the fulfillment of your word every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line god bless you let's stand together amen you don't need to clap i just read the book you know i i really i guess that's the prophet's reward right you say what the prophet said but it it's i appreciate it i i and i know you love me and i love you but we are following the fulfillment of what the messenger prophesied that's what we're seeing we're seeing the words that he spoke or the message that he spoke becoming tangible because god's letting us see it come to pass and he'll let us see the rapture come to pass it's our promise to see i i hope i made that clear with my inability but um so let's just bow our heads if you have something you'd like to ask them ask in faith believing say lord here's the promise that i'm looking for you to bring to pass i'm not going to give you a way to fulfill it i'm just trusting that when you fulfill it i will see it therefore i'm looking for it because you promised that i would see it you promised me that i would see the fulfillment of the promise in my day lord let that sink in somehow father so i'm looking to see you abraham i guess looked many years noah looked 40 years i don't know the time between mary and all that transpired but i know all these great believers they needed not one evidence to know that they talked to god and lord when i hear a promise i believe i've talked to you and you've talked to me now all i'm asking father is i'm looking for the fulfillment and you promised me i would see it and it wouldn't pass me by and i rest in that so if you have a desire in your heart with faith well you just say lord i believe that you're going to fulfill it and i'm looking to it and i believe that that's my comfort is that you said i would see it come to pass and i'm resting right there and that great simplicity in jesus wonderful name we pray amen oh amen let's sing it together open our lord [Music] oh [Music] and help us [Music] sing it again [Music] oh and help us [Music] oh [Music] do we want to see jesus to say that is [Music] oh i want what you

message across from to our path lord you've given us isab or even as brother david said it's not that our mental conception puts the scriptures together and we start to figure it out lord everything that we know and everything that we believe comes from you lord and we thank you for that we thank you for giving us a written word but allowing that written word to become life lord it's to the point where we can look at one another and see you working in flesh and lord that we can love one another greater because we know that it's you lord we know we have our faults and our failures but we look beyond the veil that each of us lord can play a part in this body lord we want to see you more and more in our lives lord that's why we pray that's why we have devotions that's why we come to church we don't do these things out of routine and ritual lord but i believe that the very act that each of us does this lord is that we can see you in a greater way lord we love you and we thank you for your many blessings lord we ask lord as we leave this church that your presence would go with us lord may people see you lord in our lives lord at school and at work at the grocery store wherever
