as like family just with a great love for him and he's just asking prayer uh because there's a great need that is Arisen they were uh diagnosed Karen was diagnosed with breast and lung cancer but he's professing that we serve a living God that can move on the scene and deliver her God knows those that care for his bride and he's testifying that they've been good to him and I know our Lord will be good to care and whether on this side or that side I believe there's a reward because if even if you give a cup of water there's a blessing in that we also just remember little Sadie as she's at home not feeling well so uh remember sad and then we're just uh I remember reading this email when it came out and I just rejoiced as if they can put up a a little picture here so um you can see I believe this will be a picture of Sophia um says thank you for your prayers uh sister magna's cousin's daughter Sophia she was told she had a tumor the size of an egg in her throat with one within one week of the prayer request it was reduced to a small cyst by the time she went in for surgery it was all gone hallelujah oh why don't you praise God he answers prayer the devil wants to try to say Well it it wasn't this it wasn't that it was my God because we serve a living God who still answers prayer and the scripture says the prayer of a righteous man availeth much so whatever you have need of oh leave it there before God in prayer and he'll move on the scene amen we'll just ask brother Andrew to come and just take the needs uh before the Lord and brothers if you can take up the ties and offerings I'm looking forward to what the lord has laid on Brother Paul's heart and just praying a blessing upon him and brother bil as he would interpret [Music] amen shall we pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus it's so good to be able to know you as our father and to know that you live in US Lord and you're still working on behalf of the requests that we have for loved ones and to see you move on this person that we were praying for and your hand of Mercy just show up on the scene and such a sovereign Divine Way it gives us joy in the midst of Trials and struggles Lord And We Worship You Lord For The Loving hand on upon her and Lord it gives us Faith again to ask tonight Lord that our little sad Lord is not feeling well and so we ask for the same God to be on the scene that those stripes that you bore would be her portion she would be begin to feel good even now Lord and Lord we know even as it was testified that no thing will go unrewarded if it's done for one of your children and this person that's struggling with cancer on the lungs and the breast father we know that it's no enemy for God and Lord we believe that when we place your word on our lips Lord as a body there's nothing can stand in the way not even cancer and so we stand in defiance of that enemy believing that you you've been merciful on our request and we pray you'll do it again father Lord it rejoices our heart to know that you can't fail father and even the other requests Lord You Know Each one and Lord our desire is oh God to see you again Lord on these requests that other testimonies can rise I just think even as I was testifying over the weekend and about you healing my back and then here comes a test and my back was hurting but father Lord here here again Lord your Everlasting promises are unfailing and here I stand oh God delivered and set free and I can stand here to testify once again that you're still alive and you still care for your children so father we we commit it all to you Lord and we pray that you'd bless this service and what we can give oh God for your king om we pray you'd Grant blessings upon it and Lord may it be used and multiplied for your kingdom and father as we prepare to receive your word tonight Lord let us open our heart Lord that you can deposit your faith and that we can shine forth the Living God lives in me others can come running to safety as we

bless brother David all the deacons and the administrators every member of this church give us your grace as we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we are still standing we'll take our Bible was in The Book of Mark Mark uh chapter 15 we'll read from verse 16 and a soldier led him away into the hall and and called uh called uh uh pror and and they gathered together the whole [Music] band clothe him with purple and plate a crown of tone and put it on his head put about his head [Music] me and begin to salute him hail King of the Jews and they smoted him on the head with the Reed and they spit on upon him and bowed their knees wor and when they had mocked him they took off uh the purple from him and they put his own clothes on him and let him out to crucify him and they compel a sim a Simon of uh seran who passed by coming out of the country the father of Alexander of Rus to Bear the his cross and they brought him unto the place gol which by being interpreted the place of of his [Music] call and they gave him to drink uh mingled with myrr but he received it not and when they had crucified him they parted the Garment and cast lot upon them what everyone should take it was the third hour when they crucify him and the subscription uh subscription on his accusation was written over the king of the Jews and with him they crucified two thieves the one on the right and one on the left on the other side the on the other of his left and the crucified and the the scripture was fulfilled which said and it was numbered among the transgressor we're going to go to verse 33 and when the sixth hour was come there was Darkness over the whole earth until the ninth [Music] hour and at the ninth hour Jesus cried cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli L which being interpreted my God my God why is thou forsaken me and some of them which stood by when they heard it they said they said behold is called Elias and and he ran and he filled the sponge with full of vinegar and put it on it on the re and give him to drink saying let alone let alone let us see uh whether Elias will come to take him down and Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and the veil of the temple was rented in Twain From the top to the bottom and when the Centurion which which stood over against him saw that he saw chist out and gave up the ghost He said truly this was a son of the Son of God lord Jesus we read your word come and interpret it for us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats I believe we could uh we are happy to be gathered in the house of God tonight we had a very blessed weekend uh God really blessed us through those [Music] Services I believe uh is helped each one of us to come closer to the Lord to be a little more [Music] sealed that we may wear the the of the robe that's been given tonight when Brother David asked me to uh uh preach the word tonight I was asking myself after such a weekend what am I going to say uh after this uh uh powerful preachers [Music] uh something came to my spirit I had receive a notification early Black Friday early Black Friday early Black Friday um I had received a notification on my phone about early Black Friday so I wanted to know what is Black Friday and as I was looking I saw an image I'm not sure if the brothers could put it up Black Friday Black Friday and we were talking about it in the back and I was looking statistic I started looking at the statistics Black Friday they saying that just just the weekend of Black Friday that Americans they spend about 67 uh billion dollars just for the weekend of Black Friday Friday and if you take from Black Friday until the New Year's 1.14 trillion they spend about 1.4 1.14 trillion dollars and as I was thinking about this a scripture came to my mind that we're going to read Isaiah 55 is I Isaiah 55 the Bible says everyone that thirsted come to the waters and he that had no money come buy and eat come buy yeah come buy wine and mil milk without money without price wherefore do you spend money on that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfi not thank you hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in my in fatness incline your ears and come unto come unto me here and your soul shall live I will make I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even even the sure mercies of David Black Friday Black Friday I I I was I was read reading and they said it's a it's a a a commercial uh uh time Thanksgiving it's the it's the Friday after Thanksgiving so so it's next week so people are are preparing themselves for Black Friday for Black Friday to go spend money to to spend on what to buy what I seen uh pictures of people standing before stores since 4:00 a.m. in the morning because they want to be the first to enter into the stores to buy what we saw the image that was being projected uh for the main part people people buy TVs the one that brother bam calls uh uh hell Vision so the Black Friday people are going to go spend a lot of money to go buy hell Vision to to learn how to look into hell to how to prepare themselves to go in hell and the the the businessmen they claiming that they've lowered the prices so the same person who bought the that that item on Black [Music] Friday he will see his neighbor with something better than what he bought he will become unsatisfied and go try to buy another we have a Friday too good Friday that the Bible calls Good Friday that's the title of my message tonight Good Friday Good Friday amen man the Bible says he's born in sin is shaped in iniquity since our father Adam and Eve they left the position of the word we are coming into the world in sin so Man by Nature had to be condemned but but God not wanting to condemn the world he decided himself to Veil himself in a a body of Flesh to come and pay the price of our condemnation to come and give us Liberty and when Jesus came he lived like a [Music] man and we read the the picture of the end of his life when we read the same story in the Book of Matthew 27 there's a lot more details it was Jesus who was was innocent he only did good him which it was because of me because of my condition because of your condition AC he accepted the the most shameful death said he died of of uh uh a broken heart that it wasn't even the the the Roman spear that killed him but it was ridicu they they they spit upon him they they they Place upon him a crown of torn he he bled they took his clothes off sometimes the images that they present of Christ on the [Music] cross they put him with a little clothes on says he didn't have clothes on they took everything in front of his own Creation in front of his mom in the flesh this young man of 33 3 years old CRF crucified naked because of me because of you uh that it was a very pathetic scene even the sun couldn't handle it the scripture says that the sun hid itself there was uh Darkness just right in the middle of the day Black Friday it was a Black Friday he was crucified on Friday it was dark that day because one man went to the Cross not to lower the price so that you may have a a part to play but so that he can pay the whole price so that you don't have to pay anything says that on that day at the C on that day at Calvary paragraph 41 it may seem a little it says it may seem like it would be a little out of season they preached this uh sermon on in September so it seems like it was to pre uh he he preached it earlier that he should have normally preached it uh uh uh in April as we do it tonight so it was out of season but our Good Friday is every day it's it's every day that we have a free access to the grace of God at every moment it says it would look like like uh it would look to be a little out of season uh this should be on on a good Friday Calvary should be remembered every day we've heard so much about it read so much about it preachers preached on it since the beginning of time singers have sang of it Through the Ages Prophet foretold of it and the prophets of these days they point back to when it did happen it's such an important day that's one of the most important days of all the days that God ever let drawn on Earth it's one it's it's one of the most important days and it's so important to the human race I think it's good for us to go back and examine see just what it means to us for I'm sure at the late hour that we are living in we are seeking every every important importance of God that we that we can know that we can know the day on the which we are living in it's a time that should call upon us to try to know more about the importance of God to come closer to God and all that we can find out we are here to learn of it to see what is for us and what God has done for us and see what he's promised to do for us and that's what we come to church for that's why the preacher preaches that's why he studies and medita in the scriptures and seeks the for inspiration it's because he is a public servant to God's people he's trying to find something that God would uh that God would have to say to his people something that would help them maybe it would be condemned them in their sins but it will help them to rise them up that they might forsake their sins and then raise up to to serve the Lord and ministers should seek these things and this day being so important [Music] one of the greatest days let us look at three different things uh that day meant to us we're going to come back to this we see that day was one of the most important days everyone that's running after Black Friday they can stay from uh uh 400 a.m. until in the afternoon standing in front of a store when the service at church takes three hours they get mad but over there he's going to spend money with the even the the the true understanding that even when they say they lower the price it's just a way to take your money but you are running for it you're going to look to buy but the tells us you that that that are thirsty come to the water come buying you come to buy but the Bible is saying that it's without money and without price and it's the most important thing in life what we're going to buy on Black Friday the young sisters can go buy things so they can make themselves pretty so they can attract more people to take him away from God they pay to go further from God but to come closer to God we have nothing to pay it's without money and without price because a man climbed the cross he took my place he took your place to give us the most satisfying thing people run away they run to this Black Friday because they're not satisfied there's the same thing that he bought that morning sometimes he gets home that evening he realizes oh there's one better than this with a price lower than this one so he wants to go and take it back why he's not satisfied but the price that Jesus Paid if we can only have access to that we'll have a satisfaction for the entire life Jesus climbed on the cross but R says that he he climbed on Calvary so he can resolve the sin question all right he went to the Cross so he can solve and and resolve this sin question it's to say that the sinner has the right to come back on the road and to to walk on a road that he's not going to be taken off again Isaiah was announcing the coming of the Lord uh verse four the Bible says say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with recompense he will come and save you himself then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the death shall shall be unstopped then the lame man leaps as as a as an heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall water break out and streams in the desert verse eight and an Highway shall be there and a way it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the way man the way man it says though the fool shall not Heir what they in the Bible says when Jesus will come that he will open he will inaugurate a new way the the unpure the unclean man cannot walk on that road but it's a road that the one that the the fool cannot go sideways what do that mean that everyone has access to this highway but when you get on that Highway when you go past the cross when you when you get access to what Jesus done at the cross that even if you were a fool that even if you were sinner even if you were the rank Sinners of the world Jesus had inaugurate this highway so that you will not air anymore that when you got on that Highway you become pure that's why there are no impure on this it doesn't mean it's people that never sin but it means that all those that get gain access to this highway they have accepted the price that was paid at Calvary they have accepted that the sin questions have been resolved and Jesus himself will place them on that way where they can never a again privil what a privilege without money without paying anything just to accept it says uh the same message that day on Calvary uh paragraph 44 it says one great important thing that Calvary means to us and the world is it settles the same question once and for all he settled the same question once for all he will never come back to the same question again the the a sinner can only accept the price that was paid there will not be a second price to be paid because the price was paid in totality it was settled once for all man was found guilty of sin and sin was a penalty that no man could pay the penalty was so great until there wasn't anyone that could pay the penalty I truly believe that God ordained it to be that way that the penalty will be so great that no man could pay it so he could do it himself so he could do it himself what father we have now the penalty the penalty of sin was death and we were all born in sin sh in iniquity came to the world speak life therefore there wasn't there wasn't none of us that was worthy and and or they could find one no one on Earth that was worthy you you don't have to say that I'm not worthy God is not asking for you to be worthy he is the one that's worthy and he paid the price so the question is settled once and for all so the sin will not longer held you captive so that the sin will not hold you no longer so you don't have to be Christian today and non-Christian tomorrow he paid the price Good Friday so when we get access to this Good Friday that we may possess all the good things that will satisfy us all the time what's what's in the world whatever we can possess that's in the world it's it's it's just vanity we can have it today and in a fraction of a second it's gone we're Los think about what's happening today in Gaza there were probably people that own buildings but today they are maybe in the refugee camp just looking for a piece of bread to eat because it's not satisfying but what what is satisfying the price that Jesus Paid tells a story I forgot in what [Music] message he said was soldiers that were going somewhere and when they were passing there was an island and there were women that were singing wonderful and and the songs were so enticing that every time that in for this soldiers to continue their Journey that they would Veer and go to that place and they will fall into the the Ambush and they will kill them and one day there was another Expedition and and the the the the captain of this troop and he asked the people with him I want you to bind me on the pole I want you to tie my mouth I want you to to to plug my ears I want you to plug my ears he him oh sorry to plug the ears of the soldiers he himself his ears were open but his mouth was closed and his hands were tied and as we were coming to this place he started hearing this enticing music and he started screaming at his soldiers let's go but no no none of them could hear him they went and passed that place and they came to the destination and when they got to where they were going as they were passing they they heard such a wonderful music it was so [Music] marvelous far better than the enticing music of the this women they finished their mission and on the way back they soldiers ask him do you want us to tell you again do you want us to to to to to mute your mouth he said no you don't have to do that he said what I heard over there is higher so high I against that one that the women are playing over there he says let's go I won't even need to hear that it's the same way with the Christian walk when we get access to the when we really meet Christ when the price of sin has been paid we don't care we we don't we're not fearing anymore of whatever it is because what we have tasted what we have bought without money without price is so high against what's been proposed to us with money says um still in that day on Calvary paragraph 61 the price that was paid and the bondage of Satan was broken God put back in the hands of man a way back to what he was looking for he had he he says he had to weep no more that it says hit when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary the backbone of sin of sickness and he brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sins forgiven hallelujah hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan back us off from God back us from God it says there's a highway made as we heard in Isaiah there's a telephone setting there there's a line to Glory bring every person in reach to that line in the Old Testament only the high priest had the the right to the access to the holy of holies there was a veil but we read that when when Christ screamed at the cross it said that the veil of the temple was rented into it means every man has access to the holy of Hol every man can access the holy it's no longer exclusive to the high for himself highway but a highway a telephone line that is tying us it says he says every man has access to this line if a man is full of of sin it connected him it connect it connected him in on the central he can be forgiven of that sin not only that but that sin is paid for you don't have to say I'm not worthy sure you are not you never could be but a worthy one took your place you are free you don't have to wonder anymore you don't have to be a pleasure seeking man out here on on the earth for there is a fountain filled with with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein where sin is plunged beneath the flood lose all the guilty stain you don't have to be lost in other word no one has the right to be lost because there's a highway or where even the fool he cannot air but the only condition is to accept the price that was paid and to become that because on this highway there's no more impure the Sinners washed you be you get on the highway you are no longer impure he says there's a there's a highway a way and it's called the way of Holiness the unclean pass not over don't pass over it for he comes through the Fountain through the fountain through the fountain first then he enters the highway he goes through the cross first then he comes and he gets on the highway where he can no longer a where Satan can no longer claim anything out of you where Satan can no longer hold you captive or anything that he would like he says he broke the power of Satan he opened the prison's door of Hell through every man that was shut up in this earth in in the prison fearing when he would die what death will be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors let every captive Go free you don't have to no you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin you don't have you have you don't have to no longer yield your member to sin drink drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it because you've got a hold of the line a Lifeline that's anchored in the Rock of Ages nothing can shake you from it no wind can shake you from it no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus Jesus says answer the sin question he he he fulfilled a double experation on the cross the salvation of our souls and the healing of our body because the Bible says it's by his stripes that we were healed so if sickness come today the good news is that our healing was already gotten before we can even become sin sick everything what God is asking of us is to remember the promise that oh I'm sick in my body today but I see here that the price was already paid that sickness can no longer hold me captive that that sickness can no longer resist and and sometimes it doesn't ask a lot of effort faith is simple uh the day the day before yesterday my wife came back and she said she was not feeling well uh she said she felt like heartbeat was really high fast I took a uh uh uh blood pressure uh uh instrument I measured it and it seems like her heart was beating a little fast uh 92 uh the normal one is between 80 uh uh 60 and 80 I finished to do that I said let's pray I said Lord Heal my wife I don't want this thing in the name of Jesus Christ amen I I took the the meter I I said let's try again we did again it went back down to 80 and she was happy just as simple we didn't scream it's a promise it's what God has given us we don't have to agitate ourselves to clean we don't have to to to beg Satan for it he has no right for you the price was already paid the Good Friday for us has taken care of everything we have nothing to pay we simply come to the store and we we claim what what belongs to us already and if we believe it God will give it to us says and uh in the message without price without money paragraph 39 he says and remember you've got to settle up to settle up with God someday for it and the wages of sin is death you don't make you don't make nothing here on Earth by it it's just a false Mirage drinking will only add Sorrows sin will only add death upon death your final check will be will be separ separation from God eternally and into the lake of fire and you cannot you cannot gain anything but lose paragraph 40 then God comes and asks the questions why do you spend your money for those things which satisfied not why do you do it what makes men want to do to do it they spend all that they spend all that they've got on all that they can earn to buy drink to buy drinking to or to close some women that they run with or some kind of worldly lustful Pleasures but it says but we are told in the Bible and our B to come to God to buy Eternal joy and eternal life without money without price those things cannot satisfy and the end of them is eternal death and he cost you all the money that you can Master up Master together to be a a big shot or an Entertainer or fun boy or whatever you might be or the popular girl or whatever it is it cost you all that you can get to to you all that you can get together to do that dress in the very highest highest of dressing and do the things that the world does only reaps a check of Eternal damnation paragraph 65 when God finds you in the ditch of sin and hear you calling on him he sends down a chain that was wrapped around Calvary when God finds you in the ditch of sin and he hears calling he sends down a chain that was that was wrapped around Calvary the love of God and he hooked into your heart and he puts the power of the Holy Spirit there to start pulling you pulling and it don't cost you nothing and yet we lay in the ditch because we can't pay it out of our pocket we Americans we think we can pay it out of our pockets but you can't it's without money it's without price you don't pay it at the church Jesus Paid it at Calvary but people are is ashamed they want it the way they want it in their way God has a way for you to go for you to receive it at sorry for you to receive it yes they got you it's free if you will take it usually when they pull you out of the ditch you are you are you are you are all scratched up you have to go to you go you have to go up to the hospital and before they start working on you before one thing is done they ask who's going to pay the bill if we are going to S up your wounds if we are going to pour oil and give shots and and and inoculate for the for the blood and and poison what kind of insurance do you have before they do one thing it's got to be money on the line but when our Lord put his chain of Love around our hearts and pull you out from the ditch of sin he heals every broken heart takes away all s all the sins and the he put up in the sea of forgiveness Remember to Remember against you no more come without money without price no matter how bad you are cut up how bad you are bruised how your family has done or what you've done there's no bill to it he heals the heart the heartaches takes away all your Sorrows he was wounded for our transgression bruise for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed it's all free as a musician can come my brother my sister Black Friday the Black Friday of this world it will cost you and it will take you away from God Fray but the Good Friday the price that was paid is free yes and it will give you Eternal Joy eternal life the best life that they could be the pleasures of this world they only last a while God is asking us why do we spend money on things that don't satisfy come come by without money without price he's only asking us to accept the the greatest price that was ever paid what we can put in our heads is to say oh it's the price that we have to pay to to suffer what Jesus suffered imagine if you were to to to go by the same way so you can pay for the price of your condemnation to pay for the price of our sins but someone came he said I'll do it for you P I'll pay the bill it's like someone was telling me he was at the hospital the the the bill was so high that he couldn't pay and one day he got a notification oh that someone paid this Bill how are you going to feel that's what Jesus did for us and brother Bram says that there at Calvary he settled the sin question he broke the the Satan's backbone that Satan does not have any power with him and he open the way so we can go back to him to bring us back to the to to the uh uh uh um de deity yes to bring us back to deity sometimes the environment of this world people that we come in contact with all of our human problems it it it causes us to forget that we are Divine that we are Sons and Daughters of God that we are Daughters of God that God is counting on us you know when the Bible says When God says that in this time that God will take up a bride that she will be without uh spot without wrinkle or any such thing in reality God is defying Satan but he's counting on you God is telling Satan that regardless of what you're going to do you can even bring her to be the rank sinner but I will take her and and bring her through the fountain and from the fountain I'll put her on the highway where you won't have access to her and she'll be pure and she'll be without spot without wrinkle or anything that we may only accept the price that was paid let's pray Lord our God we bless your Holy Name tonight when we consider this great price that was paid we consider all the spendings that we do in things that don't [Music] satisfy when you are inviting us to come buy from you without money without [Music] price we invite you [Music] Lord to forgive our shortcomings to forgive our iniquities as we are conscious tonight that the sin question was settled that you broke Satan's backb that you are bringing us back to yourself oh how we bless you tonight oh how we exalt you what a privilege we have to be your sons and your daughters to to remind Satan tonight he has no claim on us the price was paid [Music] Lord we simply bless your name we give ourselves back to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I love you I love he first Lov me and Pur Chas my [Music] Sal [Music] on oh and I love him I love him he first me and purchase my salvation [Applause] [Music] all why don't you just sing it again to him I love him [Music] oh love you I [Music] love me and puras my [Music] Sal he is all I need he I Jesus is [Music] all all Mighty all Mighty Jesus is all I need and I take him [Music] now whatever you have need of just take him now oh I take [Music] him for [Music] [Applause] all oh [Music] take him out for all that I as our pastor comes I will worship him oh and I will worship oh oh I will worship Him in SP and in [Music] truth [Music] I [Music] amen what a message you know that message should be on the lips of every believer that's what we're what we share I thought when Paul read the statement that people stay in the ditch because they can't pay for it boy What a Sad state but it's free it's without money it's without price and that's what our message is to the lost to the bruised to the wounded to the defeated hey you don't have to do nothing he did it all amen I hope that can set deep in our heart ask you to continue pray for me and and I got a prayer request I'd like you to take on your heart smile my sister's back in the hospital and she's a severe alcoholic and so she decides she doesn't want to live and then she drinks herself to a point where she's got alcohol poisoning so bad she's fixing to die and then she decides she doesn't want to die so she rushes back into the hospital and and it's just a terrible cycle of alcoholism that she's bound with drug abuse and other things but uh anyway she can't help herself the only help for her is is what Paul spoke of tonight and as you know uh being a sibling she probably won't hear it from us you know we're just who we are you know in the family but maybe God could send somebody by to her that could explain that there's been a price paid for her and that price has the power over alcoholism it has the power over depression it has that the power over a defeated life and that she might come to know that there's been a price paid would you keep that on your heart amen if if you would also if a few of your brothers have an opportunity in the next few days we need to run all the security cameras inside a church we could certainly use some help but let us just bow our heads for a moment now and I just like to ask you a question in your heart have you [Music] accepted everything that Jesus has purchased for you this evening are you still holding back on a few dark spots because you don't want to turn it all over to him tonight tonight but would you take a moment and say Lord I've tried to overcome I've tried to do this but I heard tonight that a chain that was wrapped around Calvary can come down and put its hooks in my heart and pull me from the darkness that [Music] surrounds me that maybe nobody else sees nobody else knows exists but Lord I know it's [Music] there and tonight I'm asking that you give me the grace to [Music] accept and that you would begin pulling me from this place to a higher place that I can rise from the shadows and the sin that so easily besets me and father that I can set my feet on that Highway and walk in the joy and the peace that is Christ [Music] Jesus father you see a hand hand if it's lifted you see a heart if it's raised and father we ask that you would grant that tonight father we're thankful for this wonderful message that brother Paul brought us father and Lord we're thankful for it we ask you to bless us now we pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's that song healing is here [Music] amen do you believe it's here yes it's here for you tonight amen maybe you can just enter in and
