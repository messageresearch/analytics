[24:04] [applause]
[24:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[24:37] &gt;&gt; before I sing. I'll just share a quick
[24:39] testimony.
[24:42] I'll just share a quick testimony.
[24:45] Um,
[24:47] you know, the Lord's just done something
[24:50] very wonderful for uh for me. It was on
[24:54] um Thursday.
[24:57] Um just a little just to go back a
[25:00] little bit. I've been lately just in
[25:02] between so many questions. Um and it's
[25:06] very insignificant to many people, but
[25:09] to me it's a little bit big. So I will
[25:11] share it anyway. I've been just in
[25:14] between like, you know, do I want to get
[25:16] a new car or do I want to get a old car
[25:18] or do I, you know, because I don't want
[25:20] to get in depth. And um, you know, I've
[25:24] been kind of just putting something on
[25:26] the side to see if I can acquire another
[25:28] one. And
[25:32] I've been praying in my heart, you know,
[25:34] if the burden, you know, as we're
[25:36] expecting with my wife, I've been
[25:37] praying. And I said, "Lord, I don't want
[25:38] to be foolish stewards of what you've
[25:40] given me. I don't want to just go ahead
[25:43] and splurge on things and then later on
[25:45] you start falling short." And this
[25:49] Thursday, I was driving with my wife to
[25:51] go visit a brother to help out a brother
[25:54] on something. And we were on the highway
[25:58] and the car just stopped. you know, I'm
[26:01] talking about all the engine sign and
[26:03] everything was just popping right in
[26:05] front of my eyes and I was like, Lord,
[26:08] is this it like for this car? Because I
[26:10] really love my car and it's beat up, but
[26:13] I love it. And you know, I pulled over
[26:15] on the side
[26:18] and you know, I did a little bit that I
[26:20] know about car. You know, I I took a
[26:22] walk across there was a gas station from
[26:25] the highway. I took a walk. I grabbed
[26:27] some coolant because I checked it was
[26:29] low. I added coolant and I tried to
[26:32] revive the car, you know. I checked the
[26:34] radiator. I check every I went through
[26:36] all the check box that I could
[26:39] and nothing seems to be wrong and I
[26:41] start the car. It started and it was
[26:44] shaking and the car wouldn't just move.
[26:47] You know, I put it to back to to to
[26:50] reverse to get out and go and the car
[26:54] just died.
[26:56] And if you know anything about car,
[26:58] every signal was leading to transmission
[27:00] issue. And when transmission is down,
[27:03] you just have a casket. Like literally,
[27:05] it's just garbage at that point. And me
[27:09] and my wife, we looked at each other. I
[27:11] said, but we are in the like we in the
[27:14] in the post of duty. We were going out
[27:16] to help out a brother. Like why would
[27:18] this happen? So we held hands in the
[27:21] car. She was like, "Do we call the Uber?
[27:23] Do you want to go home?" I was like,
[27:25] "No, we are going to go see somebody."
[27:28] And we just held hand in the car and
[27:31] then I said a word of prayer and then I
[27:33] said, "Lord,
[27:34] I have to go visit this brother
[27:37] and we are going to go from with this
[27:39] car. I need it for at least two more
[27:41] months just to be sure of what I want to
[27:44] get next." And just as soon as I
[27:48] finished praying,
[27:50] my wife was looking at me. So, do we
[27:52] call the Uber? I said, "We just prayed.
[27:54] So, I started the car. It was shaking
[27:58] very hard. And I put it on reverse and
[28:01] it didn't stop. And then just as I
[28:04] started going forward, we merge back in
[28:06] the highway. It stopped shaking,
[28:09] you know. Uh, and then she looked at me
[28:12] like, "Do you know what just happened?"
[28:14] I was like, "I knew God was a healer,
[28:16] but I didn't know he was a mechanic
[28:19] because, you know, he just does it all."
[28:22] And
[28:24] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[28:30] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Random says, "God is a
[28:33] supernatural God and his children's is
[28:36] just an attribute and it makes me glad
[28:39] to know that we have a God that's just a
[28:41] present help. When you call on him, he
[28:44] answers prayer." You know, I want to
[28:46] sing a song
[28:48] &gt;&gt; that says, "My heart is excited. I want
[28:51] to see Jesus.
[28:57] My heart is exciting,
[29:02] Lord. My heart is exciting.
[29:07] My heart is exciting.

[32:10] when I'm talking about the sheep who
[32:11] smells the the shepherd who smells like
[32:14] sheep, you know. You know, he's uh he's
[32:17] one that I've met a lot of pastors. I've
[32:20] met a lot of people, but I have never
[32:23] met one with such a humility with like
[32:25] brother David has. And he's never lifted
[32:28] up. He walks with everyone. and whatever
[32:31] your thinking is. You know, I've always
[32:33] been amazed that we our church is built
[32:36] with from people that come from
[32:38] different teaching, different
[32:40] background, and different everything,
[32:42] including even the very food we eat is
[32:45] very different.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; But yet, we are gathered here as one
[32:48] people. It takes someone who has
[32:51] leadership. It takes the Holy Spirit
[32:52] himself to come and put us together. and
[32:55] that we may put our doctrines aside and
[32:58] and that we may focus on one thing alone
[33:00] and that's the life of Christ living in
[33:03] a believer. So today I just want to ask
[33:05] if you take a little bit of time and
[33:08] just text him. I know he's out of town.
[33:10] We want to just text him and and let him
[33:12] know that we appreciate him that uh we
[33:16] certainly pray for him that God will
[33:18] bless him and be with him. I know he
[33:20] just preached this last service and so
[33:22] he's going to be back home soon. We just
[33:24] want to text him and uh thank the Lord
[33:26] for that. Amen. Also, I know brother
[33:29] Andrew is out ministering. We certainly
[33:31] want to remember him and pray that the
[33:33] Lord will bring him back safe home. Um
[33:36] brother Darian is home not feeling well.
[33:39] We want to keep him in prayer that the
[33:41] Lord will touch him and make him well.
[33:44] Uh also we're going to continue to pray
[33:45] for brother but brother uh Daniel Silas
[33:48] um um
[33:51] uh recovery is we know he had a big
[33:54] surgery. We just pray that the Lord will
[33:56] touch him and will heal him. Uh also
[33:59] sister Lovette was not feeling well. We
[34:01] want to remember her that the Lord will
[34:04] continue to touch her. We know that the
[34:06] enemy is always around, right, trying to
[34:08] fight and is there. But we know we have
[34:10] a God who's able, more than able to heal
[34:14] us in everything that we have need of.
[34:16] So if you have a need upon your heart,
[34:17] why don't you just lift your hand up to
[34:19] him? Amen. We invite the brothers that
[34:21] are taking the offerings for the matter
[34:23] of sake if you could just come and take
[34:25] this needs before the church.
[34:41] Let's just all bow our heads and our
[34:43] hearts.
[34:47] Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[34:50] Lord, we just come to you in humility,
[34:52] Lord,
[34:54] knowing you're the answer to it all.
[35:00] Lord, we lift our pastor up to you,
[35:02] Lord. God is
[35:05] over in Zambia. Just asking that you
[35:07] would
[35:10] pour out a blessing upon him, Lord, that
[35:12] he cannot contain.
[35:15] We just love and appreciate all that he
[35:17] does for us, Lord.
[35:21] Just ask that you would bless him, Lord.
[35:30] Lord, as the request was spoken, I
[35:34] thought how
[35:36] we're all homesick.
[35:39] But Lord, we have a precious brother
[35:40] who's at home sick. Just ask that you
[35:44] would
[35:46] restore him, Lord God.
[35:50] We love our brother and just [music]
[35:52] long to see him with us, Lord,
[35:54] worshiping and
[35:58] how he serves your people faithfully.
[36:01] Lord,
[36:06] just ask that you'd go to him now and
[36:07] touch him. Lord,
[36:10] I believe there was another one, a
[36:13] sister, Lord, that was sick. Maybe
[36:15] brother George's wife, I don't remember.
[36:19] Just ask Lord that you would
[36:22] make a house call Lord God.
[36:25] Lord that your power would be made known
[36:27] amongst us Lord.
[36:34] Lord that you'd strengthen us [music]
[36:40] Lord as we look out and see this dark
[36:42] world. We
[36:45] want to run to the light.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Lord. You are the light of the world.
[36:53] You're living in us. Lord, help us to be
[36:56] out amongst the world, shining forth
[36:58] your light. We just ask, Lord, that you
[37:01] would
[37:04] bless any other needs that were spoken,
[37:06] Lord.
[37:08] Lord, that you'd break forth your word.
[37:10] That we would
[37:14] leave here changed.
[37:18] For that's what your word is to do is to
[37:20] change us [music] into your image.
[37:24] We need to be washed by the water of
[37:26] your word.
[37:29] Lord, we know the characters of victory.
[37:32] We ask, Lord, that you'd have the
[37:33] preeminence. We love you and thank you
[37:35] for your mercy and your grace. Jesus
[37:37] name. Amen.
[37:41] And oh oh to Jesus
[37:48] I surrender
[37:51] [music] all

[45:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, in the good news of God.

[45:35] In all my life, you have been so [music]
[45:39] so [singing] good.
[45:43] With every
[45:46] [singing]
[45:47] [music]
[45:49] I will speak
[45:52] of the goodness
[45:54] of God. In all my [music] life,
[45:59] in all my [music] life, you [singing]
[46:01] have been faithful.
[46:04] Thank you, Lord. [music]
[46:07] In all [singing] my life, you have been
[46:10] so [music]
[46:11] so good.
[46:16] Every breath [music and singing]
[46:17] that I made
[46:21] will I will sing
[46:24] of the [music and singing] goodness
[46:26] of God.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for his goodness,
[46:30] &gt;&gt; his mercy, and his grace in your life? I
[46:33] say there's plenty more where that came
[46:35] from [clears throat] there. There's no
[46:37] exhausting his mercy and his grace. And
[46:40] aren't you just thankful when we make a
[46:41] mess of things and we try to figure
[46:44] things out on our own or uh try to go
[46:47] out there and make something of
[46:48] ourselves that we fall and realize that
[46:52] we were nothing when he found us and
[46:54] we're still completely depending upon
[46:56] him every step, every move of the way.
[46:59] We we're just thankful that he allows us
[47:01] as sons and daughters to okay, go ahead.
[47:04] But then his grace and his mercy, he'll
[47:06] pick you back up. And I tell you,
[47:07] there's power in repentance. There's
[47:09] power in confession. And I tell you, the
[47:12] the the the skies of heaven are open for
[47:14] the true believer. And I say that we can
[47:15] just move into those things if we just
[47:17] surrender and just allow him to have his
[47:20] his will and his way in our life. Amen.
[47:22] Let's just go before him. Lord Jesus, we
[47:24] love you. Lord, we're thankful that we
[47:26] would have an opportunity just to be in
[47:29] the house of God again and Lord to sing
[47:31] the songs of Zion and Lord just to pour
[47:33] our heart out to you and to tell you how
[47:35] much we love you and thank you Lord and
[47:38] that by divine promise Lord you would be
[47:40] in our midst Lord just moving amongst us
[47:42] Lord receiving the praise and adoration
[47:46] Lord and that you would draw nigh as we
[47:48] would draw nigh unto you and Lord we've
[47:50] come to this portion now in the service
[47:52] we're depending upon you Lord that you'd
[47:54] could come and take a vessel, Lord, and
[47:58] you would use it to speak your word to
[47:59] your people, Lord. You know where each
[48:01] one is living, where they're at in their
[48:03] life and their journey, what they have
[48:05] need of, Lord. And only you could know
[48:09] the thought and intent of the heart. And
[48:11] [music] your word can come in such a way
[48:13] that it would start to penetrate down
[48:15] into the the soul realm and the uh uh
[48:18] the places that they have need of and to
[48:20] open those doors that have been locked
[48:22] and closed. And maybe they've been
[48:24] afraid and fearful to make a surrender.
[48:27] But Lord, you know how to make the
[48:28] approach. You know how to come to the
[48:30] individual and speak to them in such a
[48:31] way, Lord, where they can start to uh
[48:34] listen to the very word and it would
[48:36] start to discern their thought and
[48:37] intent and and start to speak words of
[48:39] life and encouragement and bring them
[48:41] out of the shadows and out of the
[48:42] darkness. Lord, that your word could
[48:44] illuminate their heart and their life.
[48:46] And Lord, we're just looking that you
[48:47] would do that in a special way this
[48:49] morning, Lord. not something that a man
[48:51] can do but only you could do Lord and
[48:54] you're the same yesterday today and
[48:56] forever. So we just surrender ourselves
[48:58] to you Lord that you would just have the
[49:00] complete control in this service or we
[49:02] commit ourselves to you and ask this
[49:03] blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:05] Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:08] Well, if you have your Bibles, we'll
[49:10] read out of First Thessalonians. It's
[49:12] good to be with you. Um
[49:16] Brother Billy has little Evan confused.
[49:18] He's like, "Wait a second. My birthday's
[49:20] today. Well, because Evan and and and my
[49:24] dad share a birthday, which is tomorrow.
[49:27] Um, but uh I just if you send him a
[49:30] double text, Brother David won't mind.
[49:32] So, wish him happy birthday all today
[49:34] and wish him happy birthday all next
[49:36] week, he'll appreciate it. And while you
[49:39] do that, don't don't forget little Evan.
[49:41] You know, one time uh Evan looked over
[49:43] at Grandpa and he said, "I stole your
[49:46] birthday."
[49:48] Well, you know, if anybody could do
[49:49] that, that would be his grandson. Huh.
[49:51] Well, we're just thankful to be here uh
[49:54] wi with you back from a little extended
[49:56] vacation. Uh we just felt in our heart
[49:58] here about a month ago that uh we just
[50:01] wanted to take the family and uh just uh
[50:05] just go on maybe what we would call a
[50:07] little extended vacation. And we were in
[50:08] fellowship with brother Josh Bennett and
[50:10] their church there. and um you know so
[50:13] when you're when you're away for a
[50:15] little bit people start talking and and
[50:17] start asking questions and things but we
[50:20] had an extended vacation out there that
[50:21] was refreshing and we didn't want to lay
[50:23] out of church for for four or five
[50:25] weeks. So, uh, we we just went away and
[50:29] were in service there. And of course, we
[50:31] were happy to be in service for the Lord
[50:33] while we were there and in fellowship.
[50:34] But just wanted to to let you know that,
[50:37] uh, we're we're home and happy to be
[50:39] here and just looking for what the Lord
[50:41] would have for us. And, uh, it's just
[50:43] good to see each one of you.
[50:46] Amen. I hope it's I hope it's
[50:48] reciprocated, but,
[50:51] &gt;&gt; you know, but it's good. We love you. we
[50:52] appreciate you and hold you dear to our
[50:55] heart and uh we want the best for you
[50:58] and God gave us his best and we're just
[51:01] so thankful for that. So we'll just see
[51:03] how the Lord will lead in this this
[51:05] service here and uh just trust in his
[51:09] mercy. Reading out of 1 Thessalonians in
[51:11] chapter 4.
[51:16] I don't know if anybody is in a hurry.
[51:19] Um, but the the same doors you came in
[51:21] are still there.
[51:23] And so if if you have to get up or
[51:25] excuse yourself or something like that,
[51:27] we understand. Uh, but we just want to
[51:30] um we want to give the word preeminence.
[51:32] Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says, "For the Lord
[51:36] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[51:38] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[51:41] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[51:43] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[51:46] which are alive and remain shall be
[51:48] caught up together with them in the
[51:49] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[51:52] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[51:55] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[51:58] words. Amen. We pray a blessing on the
[52:00] word. You can have your seats. And also
[52:02] I just want to read a familiar scripture
[52:05] to us. If you'll turn in Revelations
[52:07] chapter 10
[52:09] and I'd like to read verse 7. I would
[52:13] believe that most of us would know this
[52:15] um by heart. And if you if you don't um
[52:20] stick around a little while and you
[52:22] will.
[52:23] Amen. Is everybody feeling good this
[52:26] morning?
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Even if you're not feeling good, you
[52:29] made it.
[52:31] You know, I I know the devil's pressing
[52:32] me in my body and and uh you know, felt
[52:35] like I got hit by a bus and and maybe
[52:38] maybe that could be upgraded to a Mac
[52:40] truck, but you know, I'm so glad we're
[52:42] not dependent on how we feel.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we make it to the house of
[52:46] God. And I I often, you know, I I the
[52:49] way I kind of grew up believing I say
[52:52] grew up from the age of 21 when I was
[52:53] born again. Um you know, I always
[52:56] thought if you were sick, the b best
[52:58] place to be was in the house of God.
[53:00] And I was pretty legalistic about that
[53:02] until I got married and had kids and
[53:04] found out mothers,
[53:06] they have a different way of um
[53:08] approaching things. And you have to
[53:10] realize you have to uh have wisdom and
[53:13] discernment. And and uh it's not always
[53:15] good to bring a a a house full of sick
[53:18] people to the house of God. But I say if
[53:21] it's by revelation, you come on and
[53:24] receive your your your healing. Um but
[53:28] uh but we've made it and I'm sure some
[53:29] of you weren't feeling good but you're
[53:31] here and I believe God has something
[53:33] special for you. Amen. Revelations 10
[53:36] and verse 7 it says but in the days of
[53:38] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[53:41] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[53:46] should be finished at heath declared to
[53:48] his servants the prophets. Brother
[53:50] Brandham would say in the lady of church
[53:52] age he says now the age in which we are
[53:54] living is going to be a very short one
[53:57] events are going to transpire very
[53:59] rapidly so the messenger to this lady
[54:02] age has to be here now though perhaps we
[54:06] don't know him as yet but there will
[54:08] surely have to be a time that he becomes
[54:11] known now I can prove that because we
[54:13] have scriptures that describes his
[54:15] ministry first of all the messenger is
[54:17] going to be a prophet he will have the
[54:19] office of a prophet. He will have the
[54:21] prophetic ministry. It will be based
[54:23] solidly on the word because when he
[54:25] prophesies or has a vision, it will
[54:28] always be word oriented and it will
[54:31] always
[54:32] &gt;&gt; come to pass. He will be vindicated as a
[54:36] prophet because of his accuracy. And I
[54:41] tell you, the the world and the
[54:42] militaries, they might have heat
[54:44] seeeking missiles and and they got
[54:46] infrared and and all this night vision.
[54:48] And I tell you that, but there's no
[54:50] greater accuracy than the word of the
[54:52] Lord. He He knows how to find you no
[54:55] matter where you're at and where you're
[54:57] hiding and and all of the unbelief and
[54:59] the sin that you're hiding under,
[55:01] circumstances and generational curses
[55:03] and sin. But God can just he can go and
[55:06] go through all of those things and find
[55:07] you. And and brother Brandon made the
[55:09] statement. He said, "Events are going to
[55:11] transpire
[55:13] very rapidly." And something on my heart
[55:15] that I'd like to speak to you maybe for
[55:17] a title this morning is a chain of
[55:19] events.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And we have a direction where we're
[55:22] going and I want to use a story uh out
[55:25] of 2 Kings chapter 7 uh to maybe just
[55:28] lay in a a a foundation or an example
[55:33] maybe would be a better word for um how
[55:36] how God has dealt with my heart in a a
[55:38] chain of events. And I don't know how
[55:41] far we'll be able to get um but by God's
[55:44] grace something will be said that'll be
[55:45] a help to you. So if we can just turn in
[55:47] our Bibles to Second Kings chapter 7.
[55:52] I like to hear the the pages turning. If
[55:55] you have your your Bibles uh the book of
[55:57] Kings is it's after Genesis. It's before
[56:00] Revelation
[56:02] if that helps.
[56:05] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[56:10] Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges. Am I
[56:12] getting close? I don't know.
[56:15] I might have skipped the chapter you
[56:17] were looking for. Second Kings 7 and
[56:20] verse one. Then Elisha
[56:23] said, "Hear ye the word of the Lord.
[56:24] Thus sayeth the Lord, tomorrow about
[56:26] this time shall a measure of fine flour
[56:28] be sold for a shekele, and two measures
[56:30] of barley for a shekele in the gate of
[56:32] Samaria."
[56:34] Then a Lord on whose hand the king
[56:36] leaned it answered the man of God and
[56:38] said, "Behold, if the Lord would make
[56:41] windows in heaven
[56:43] might this thing be." And he said,
[56:45] "Behold, thou shalt see it with thine
[56:47] eyes, but shall not eat thereof." And
[56:52] there were four lepers men, four lepous
[56:55] men at the entering in of the gate. And
[56:58] they said one to another, "Why sit we
[57:00] here until we die?" And just in um
[57:04] speaking about a chain of events, the
[57:07] definition Webster would give on this is
[57:08] it's a series of events so related to
[57:12] each other that each one initiates the
[57:14] next or a number of events triggered by
[57:18] the same initial event.
[57:21] So you just can kind of catch by the
[57:24] definition something when when something
[57:26] happens it's in such a way like a domino
[57:29] effect. you know, when when this
[57:30] happens, the next thing happens. And,
[57:32] you know, as I I thought on this thought
[57:34] here, I was uh uh preaching about it and
[57:36] it it, you know, I was reminded of a
[57:38] time I was living in Arizona. I I called
[57:40] it a shoe box on a dirt hill. You know,
[57:43] it was a a nice uh a trailer that I had
[57:46] and and um you know, I was on the phone
[57:49] with with my soon to be uh bride and and
[57:52] I was cooking at the same time. and and
[57:54] maybe that was the first uh step in the
[57:57] chain of disaster is that I was cooking.
[57:59] I don't know. But but as I was cooking,
[58:01] I was on the phone and something was uh
[58:03] getting more attention the other and and
[58:05] and there became a grease fire on the
[58:07] stove and and uh you know and then I I I
[58:10] tried to put uh baking soda on it, but
[58:12] it wasn't baking soda. It was baking
[58:14] powder and and and that doesn't put out
[58:16] a fire like baking soda will. And so now
[58:19] my fire is growing. And then I decided
[58:21] to get a towel and throw the towel on it
[58:22] and the towel wasn't uh uh thick enough.
[58:25] And so that was just adding to the flame
[58:26] and and so um I was just uh here this
[58:30] this fire is growing on the stove and I
[58:32] finally got the great idea that this
[58:34] fire doesn't belong in the house and I
[58:36] was able to grab the handle of that pan
[58:39] and I threw it out the back door. Well,
[58:41] throwing a a a grease fire out the back
[58:43] door in the high desert where there's no
[58:46] water and everything is dry and just
[58:48] like kindling. When that thing hit the
[58:50] ground, there was a whole field of
[58:52] tumble weed and it just went
[58:55] and my my wife, you know, is on the
[58:57] other line. Is everything okay? Yeah,
[58:58] everything's fine. Everything's
[58:59] everything's good. But it was a ch it
[59:01] was a chain of disaster. You know, one
[59:04] thing led to another and the next thing
[59:06] and before you know it, the whole
[59:07] backyard was on fire. And I'm I'm trying
[59:09] to I don't you know I'm trying to fill
[59:10] up a a trash can in the in the tub, the
[59:13] garden tub, and I'm I'm trying to throw
[59:15] water out the back door. You could just
[59:16] imagine what that looked like. I told
[59:18] you I was You talk about a city on a
[59:20] hill. Everybody around there was looking
[59:21] up. What's going on up there?
[59:24] But you know that was a that was uh some
[59:26] some uh a little uh chain reaction you
[59:29] know and as you think upon this thought
[59:31] here you know the wrong a decision
[59:35] can cause a chain reaction
[59:37] &gt;&gt; or or even neglect or or neglecting to
[59:40] do something [laughter] I can cause a
[59:43] chain reaction as would be another word
[59:46] for a chain of events which is it's a
[59:48] series of escalating negative
[59:50] consequences. If you're speaking about a
[59:52] a chain of disaster or or something,
[59:54] it's it's a series of escalating
[59:56] negative consequences creating a chain
[59:59] reaction of harmful events. Now, as we
[1:00:02] just move through some of these things,
[1:00:03] maybe you'll just allow the Lord to
[1:00:04] speak to you in your life and maybe to
[1:00:06] think about things. But as I was
[1:00:08] thinking about a chain of disaster and
[1:00:10] if you were to even research that of
[1:00:11] man-made disasters and chain of
[1:00:13] disasters, you know, some of the things
[1:00:15] that come up right right away is is
[1:00:17] there was a nuclear power plant in in uh
[1:00:20] I believe in Ukraine now um Chernobyl
[1:00:23] that um you know it it basically uh it
[1:00:26] blew up and it was something that they
[1:00:28] the scientists didn't think was actually
[1:00:30] possible what had happened. But as they
[1:00:33] did the research and they did the study
[1:00:35] and found out how could this have
[1:00:36] happened, it was really a chain reaction
[1:00:39] of events of of neglecting protocol and
[1:00:41] and having people maybe there that
[1:00:43] weren't experienced and they they were
[1:00:45] going to run a test and and and really
[1:00:47] what they were doing is they were
[1:00:48] bypassing all the protocols and
[1:00:50] everything. And what did it do? It
[1:00:51] caused a chain reaction to where uh uh
[1:00:54] where things just got so far down the
[1:00:56] line when they when they thought they
[1:00:58] could just shut everything down and and
[1:01:00] and and and and stop the reaction, it
[1:01:03] was too late and it actually just
[1:01:04] detonated and and just blew up and it
[1:01:06] was a major catastrophe. Another one
[1:01:09] that is listed is uh called Deep Water
[1:01:13] Horizon which was a oil drill rigging
[1:01:16] operation to where once again um they
[1:01:20] say that there was neglect and and uh
[1:01:22] there was maintenance and certain things
[1:01:24] they they hadn't done and it led to one
[1:01:26] of the the worst uh uh uh disasters oil
[1:01:29] disasters that the world has ever seen.
[1:01:31] And and you know when you look at these
[1:01:33] things you could see while running tests
[1:01:34] and lack of maintenance and not
[1:01:36] following protocol and flawed management
[1:01:38] and and and you know and and all of a
[1:01:40] sudden in these in these situations when
[1:01:42] they bypass one step they bypass
[1:01:44] another. You know you wonder how how are
[1:01:46] they coming to this place where they're
[1:01:47] they're they're just they're just
[1:01:49] sherking uh uh um things that protocols
[1:01:51] that have been put in place and and this
[1:01:53] is the order. This is the way to do it.
[1:01:55] But somehow they lose their sense of
[1:01:56] urgency. they they become lax and and
[1:01:59] the maintenance don't matter anymore.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you don't change the
[1:02:03] oil in your car, you might be okay for a
[1:02:05] little while.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Next time I'll do it. Next
[1:02:08] time I'll do it. Next time." Well, if
[1:02:10] you do that next time, the next time
[1:02:13] there won't be a next time.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; You'll find out one time the car is
[1:02:17] going to say, "Look, I quit." And then
[1:02:19] you're staring at the car and wondering
[1:02:20] why in the world is my car not working.
[1:02:22] is like, you know, I I've had this check
[1:02:24] engine light on for 6 months.
[1:02:30] I've been telling you to change or check
[1:02:32] the oil, and what do we do? We just
[1:02:34] well, we just neglect it. You just put
[1:02:36] it off. And and that's exactly how a
[1:02:39] chain of events or or chain disaster can
[1:02:42] happen. And and I was just listen
[1:02:44] thinking about that, you know, a sense
[1:02:45] of urgency or or getting complacent or
[1:02:48] getting getting latched. And and that's
[1:02:50] exactly what brother Brandon would
[1:02:51] describe the the Ephesian church age as
[1:02:53] as lacks and drifting. And you'd find
[1:02:55] that in Revelations 2:4. He said,
[1:02:57] "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:02:58] thee because thou has left thou thy
[1:03:01] first love." You know, if something was
[1:03:03] left, there was there was an
[1:03:04] abandonment. Something something that
[1:03:06] was in the first place, something that
[1:03:07] you gave honor to, something that you
[1:03:09] nurtured, something that you loved and
[1:03:11] and gave your attention to. Now,
[1:03:13] something is starting to take place to
[1:03:15] where it no longer has the preeminence.
[1:03:17] it no longer has the first place, but
[1:03:19] now all of a sudden you start bypassing
[1:03:21] or you start allowing other things to
[1:03:23] get your time and to get your attention
[1:03:24] and and you and you start to pour
[1:03:26] yourself and and I'll say it like this,
[1:03:28] but you you start to have a divided
[1:03:29] heart to where where you know you you've
[1:03:31] given so much of your heart to one
[1:03:33] thing, but now you start to give your
[1:03:34] heart to other things. And and I could
[1:03:36] say to have a divided heart is a
[1:03:37] dangerous place to be because that's
[1:03:39] exactly what happened to Samson. Samson
[1:03:41] had a divided heart. you know, he gave
[1:03:42] his he gave his uhh strength to God, but
[1:03:46] he gave his heart to Delilah. And so
[1:03:48] many times, if we're not careful, we
[1:03:49] give our strength and we give certain
[1:03:51] things unto God, but there's other areas
[1:03:53] of our heart and certain things in our
[1:03:54] life that we don't completely surrender
[1:03:56] to them. It's because maybe we have a
[1:03:58] divided heart or we might be like this
[1:04:00] uh uh battling this this uh a condition
[1:04:03] of the Ephesian age where where he says
[1:04:05] something, I have somewhat against it
[1:04:07] because thou has left thy first love.
[1:04:09] And the prophet would say this in the
[1:04:10] Ephesian church age. He said, "The
[1:04:12] fervent desire to please God,
[1:04:15] the passion to know his word, the cry
[1:04:18] for reaching out in the spirit,
[1:04:22] all begins to fade and instead of that
[1:04:24] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:04:28] God, it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:04:30] formal." That is what was happening back
[1:04:33] there to the Ephesians. They were
[1:04:36] getting a bit formal.
[1:04:38] Look at the complaint. They they left
[1:04:40] their first love. So something else is
[1:04:43] is creeping in. It's taking their time.
[1:04:46] It's taking their attention. And and
[1:04:48] their concern is is maybe not so much uh
[1:04:52] giving the word the first place. And a a
[1:04:54] and one decision
[1:04:57] leading to another decision.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; You you want to know how you get to a
[1:05:02] place where you don't come to church
[1:05:03] Sunday night?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You don't go once.
[1:05:10] Right?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I mean I if if you know how you form a
[1:05:14] habit, it's you keep repeating the
[1:05:16] process.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And some people are in a habit of not
[1:05:20] coming to church on Sunday night because
[1:05:22] they did it once. And whatever the
[1:05:25] excuse was not to do it once was good
[1:05:27] enough to do it again.
[1:05:30] You see, I remember um as a young
[1:05:33] Christian, you know, and uh God just
[1:05:35] made me a certain way. I can be a little
[1:05:37] bit more legalistic and in time and and
[1:05:40] and and uh and growth and maturity. I've
[1:05:43] I uh God's helped uh me to be more
[1:05:45] balanced. But with that in mind, I I
[1:05:47] still hold that very uh uh my
[1:05:50] convictions very uh very real and dear
[1:05:53] to my heart because I I know my nature
[1:05:55] and my character and the way I am. I if
[1:05:57] anybody knows me, I'm kind of an all or
[1:05:59] nothing kind of guy, you know? I I I
[1:06:00] like to pour my heart into it. So, if
[1:06:02] I'm going to miss church on Sunday
[1:06:04] night, I just might as well not ever go.
[1:06:08] And some of you have already arrived
[1:06:09] there,
[1:06:11] but but I would I was always cautious to
[1:06:13] know that I have a great enemy in my
[1:06:15] flesh. And so, I would never want to
[1:06:17] give it the reason in the first place.
[1:06:19] And I could remember, talk about being
[1:06:21] legalistic. I I I I remember I could
[1:06:23] count on one hand uh uh in the first
[1:06:25] maybe 10 years of serving the Lord that
[1:06:27] I had never walked out of a service. Um
[1:06:30] because I I I uh I believed uh we're in
[1:06:34] the presence of God and the word is
[1:06:36] going forth and and I believe that he's
[1:06:38] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:06:39] And and my if I wouldn't want to miss
[1:06:41] the last out of the World Series, why
[1:06:43] would I want to miss the very revealed
[1:06:45] preaching of the word uh coming right to
[1:06:48] us, you know, and and so that's just the
[1:06:50] way I am. I'm not trying to force myself
[1:06:52] on anybody, but but you know, then life
[1:06:54] happens and and uh you get married and
[1:06:56] you have kids and you got to take kids
[1:06:58] out and and you got to do certain things
[1:07:00] and you know, if you're not careful, you
[1:07:01] use your kids as an excuse to leave
[1:07:03] church.
[1:07:05] Well, that's all right. We're just
[1:07:08] talking about how we cool off and get
[1:07:09] laxed
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; and how we we don't give give the word
[1:07:13] the first place and Sunday nights is
[1:07:16] Wednesday nights and God and his word
[1:07:19] and praying and listening to the
[1:07:21] prophet. You know, they're
[1:07:26] good. I mean, you know, I like to come
[1:07:29] to church and hear the hear about the
[1:07:31] gospel, but I got a job, you know. I got
[1:07:34] a I got a car and a house I got to pay
[1:07:36] for. Subdivided heart. How do we get to
[1:07:40] these places? Look at how the prophet is
[1:07:42] showing what happened to that first
[1:07:43] church age of how one decision maybe is
[1:07:46] leading to another. But he says he he he
[1:07:49] know the complete surrender and
[1:07:52] dependence on God and his word is no
[1:07:54] longer the top priority.
[1:07:57] And then what the world offers and what
[1:07:58] the world thinks and we start to value
[1:08:01] uh uh uh its opinions and it starts to
[1:08:03] influence our decisions. And we could
[1:08:06] maybe take time. I know I'm moving
[1:08:08] slowly but uh we could take time and go
[1:08:11] into Israel and see how Israel did the
[1:08:13] same thing. They were led by a
[1:08:14] vindicated prophet, a pillar of fire by
[1:08:16] day, pillar of fire by night and a and
[1:08:19] they crossed over by a divine hand uh
[1:08:21] under the leadership of Joshua, a type
[1:08:23] of the Holy Ghost to possess the land.
[1:08:25] But you know what did they do? They
[1:08:26] started to get their eyes on the things
[1:08:27] of the world and they wanted a king and
[1:08:29] they wanted to be like the world and
[1:08:31] they started to make a decision and a
[1:08:33] choice that was rejecting God in his
[1:08:35] provided way.
[1:08:37] And so uh the brother Brandham would
[1:08:39] continue to say that that is the history
[1:08:41] of the church referring to to Israel. He
[1:08:44] says, 'When it thinks more of conforming
[1:08:46] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:08:49] God, it isn't long until you see them
[1:08:51] stop doing things they used to do
[1:08:56] and start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:08:58] initially.
[1:09:03] Now, some of of of of us um maybe have
[1:09:08] been believing the message longer than
[1:09:11] others,
[1:09:12] and I would encourage you young people
[1:09:16] to go to some of the elders
[1:09:19] and ask them, "What is Brother Brandham
[1:09:23] talking about?"
[1:09:27] Go ask and say, "Well, what what have
[1:09:31] you seen in our day? What do you mean
[1:09:33] that? Um, it's not long until you see
[1:09:36] them stop doing things they used to do
[1:09:38] and start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:09:40] initially. They change their manner of
[1:09:41] dress, their attitudes, and their
[1:09:44] behavior. They get latched. That is what
[1:09:46] Ephesus means. Relaxed and drifting.
[1:09:49] Now, I I could take some time on saying,
[1:09:52] you know what? It used to be wrong for a
[1:09:54] believer to,
[1:09:57] you know, it used to be wrong for a
[1:09:59] believer to wear high heels. It used to
[1:10:01] be wrong for a believer to wear a tight
[1:10:03] dress and form fitting clothes. It used
[1:10:05] to be wrong for for for a believer to
[1:10:08] watch uh entertainment and movies that
[1:10:10] are R-rated and have cursing and
[1:10:11] cursing. It used to be wrong to go to
[1:10:14] the movie theaters. It used to be wrong
[1:10:18] to not go to church on Sunday night. It
[1:10:20] used to be wrong not to be found in the
[1:10:21] house of God when the when the when the
[1:10:23] saints are gathered together.
[1:10:26] It used to be wrong for it. Used
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; we we've changed we've changed our
[1:10:31] attitude. We've changed our approach.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; But it used to be wrong for a sister not
[1:10:36] to cut her hair.
[1:10:38] And somehow they still cut their hair.
[1:10:42] Well, I don't do it. Somebody else do
[1:10:44] does it. It's contradictory to the word
[1:10:46] of God. And you don't even have a right
[1:10:48] to pray.
[1:10:50] That is the gospel truth.
[1:10:54] And so when our kids ask us, "Well, so
[1:10:56] and so cuts their hair." What what am I
[1:10:59] supposed to tell them? Sometimes I want
[1:11:01] to tell my kids to go ask you why you
[1:11:03] cut your hair.
[1:11:09] I know why you do it. Because the
[1:11:11] headship's wrong. Now, that ain't my
[1:11:14] words. I'm just I just say what a
[1:11:16] prophet taught me.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; But But what's changed,
[1:11:20] church? What's changed?
[1:11:23] What What has changed? When 20, 30 years
[1:11:25] ago, we used to not listen to certain
[1:11:27] music.
[1:11:29] We used to not dress a certain way.
[1:11:32] The sisters didn't want to wear form
[1:11:34] fitting clothes.
[1:11:36] But my I I go to places now and I go to
[1:11:38] camps and things like that and they
[1:11:40] don't even care as long as they can play
[1:11:43] sports in it.
[1:11:46] And and I tell you, you know, you you
[1:11:48] you you think you gota we we we ought to
[1:11:51] have some discernment
[1:11:53] and and and and there's some good things
[1:11:55] that have been made that that allow us
[1:11:57] and our sisters to be able to
[1:11:59] participate in activities that are good
[1:12:01] for them to be able to do and express
[1:12:03] themselves as kids. But but don't use
[1:12:06] that as a license to abandon our
[1:12:09] godliness a and and our desire to not
[1:12:12] conform to the world.
[1:12:16] Now, I'm sorry. I'm just following the
[1:12:18] leadership of the Lord and what's what a
[1:12:20] a vindicated prophet has taught me.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But how do we get to these places? It's
[1:12:26] a chain of events.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; It's one decision after another
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; and then things become acceptable.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we're so
[1:12:36] revelated,
[1:12:38] we're so made the rapture that none of
[1:12:41] this applies to us.
[1:12:44] If it applied to the first church age,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; oh, we could talk about the signs and
[1:12:49] the miracles and the works and the
[1:12:52] vindication of the spirit amongst them.
[1:12:54] And then we we hardly can identify any
[1:12:57] of that in our midst.
[1:13:01] Well, I I I know we're down home living,
[1:13:04] but I want to make a body change. I want
[1:13:05] to go in a rapture.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I want to check up.
[1:13:09] Oh, I want to see Lord.
[1:13:12] The Bible says the heart, I believe it
[1:13:14] says the heart is the most wicked,
[1:13:16] wicked thing there is.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It'll deceive you just like it deceives
[1:13:21] Samson. Samson was deceived.
[1:13:24] And some of us because we give our
[1:13:25] strength to God,
[1:13:28] we're deceived into thinking. But I I
[1:13:31] pray by the by bringing the word and
[1:13:33] maybe here in a little bit we can run a
[1:13:35] little bit faster. But I hope that's
[1:13:37] okay. Hey, you like the word of God,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; you know, I I would say that if you're a
[1:13:42] a um a son and daughter of God, you
[1:13:46] know, he loves you and he corrects those
[1:13:48] that he loves. So, Brother Brandham
[1:13:50] would go on to say that the cycle of
[1:13:52] revival and death has never failed. All
[1:13:54] you have to do is recall this last move
[1:13:56] of God in the spirit when men and women
[1:13:59] dressed like Christians, went to church,
[1:14:02] prayed all night, took to the street
[1:14:05] corners and weren't ashamed of the
[1:14:07] manifestations of the spirit. They left
[1:14:09] their old dead churches and worshiped in
[1:14:12] homes or old store buildings. They had
[1:14:14] reality. But it wasn't too long a time
[1:14:18] till they began to get enough money to
[1:14:20] build five new churches. They put a
[1:14:24] choir in instead of singing unto God for
[1:14:26] themselves. They put on gowns on the
[1:14:28] choir. They organized a movement and ran
[1:14:32] it by man. They soon began to read books
[1:14:34] they weren't fit to read. Well, we might
[1:14:36] as well throw in something beside books.
[1:14:39] We went to websites we shouldn't go to.
[1:14:43] Come on. I think are are we are we okay?
[1:14:45] Hey, are we mature enough to allow God
[1:14:47] to deal with our heart
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; that you can let the spirit spell it
[1:14:50] out? That we we don't have to walk down
[1:14:53] and a a and and and and you know, just
[1:14:56] broadcast a bunch of things. You know
[1:14:57] where you're living.
[1:15:00] You're a son and daughter of God. You
[1:15:02] You want to serve him. You want to be
[1:15:03] pleasing to him. You know, if if you're
[1:15:06] losing if if Satan's pulling on you
[1:15:08] where you're like, "May maybe I am
[1:15:09] losing my first love." Look, we're not
[1:15:11] talking about condemnation. We're
[1:15:13] talking about correction. We're talking
[1:15:15] about repentance because you are going
[1:15:17] to manifest the word. But we want to we
[1:15:19] want to be have some sobriety about us
[1:15:22] to look into our lives and to say if the
[1:15:24] Lord was to come today, where would he
[1:15:26] find me?
[1:15:28] So he says they soon began to read books
[1:15:31] they weren't fit to read. They let down
[1:15:33] the bars and the goats came in and took
[1:15:36] it over. The cry of joy was gone.
[1:15:42] We could spend some time there. The cry
[1:15:45] of joy was gone. The freedom of the
[1:15:49] spirit was gone.
[1:15:52] Oh, they kept on with a form, but the
[1:15:56] fire had died down and the blackness of
[1:15:58] ashes
[1:16:00] is about all
[1:16:02] that is left. He said the cycle of
[1:16:05] revival and death has never failed.
[1:16:09] So, as churches and individuals, they
[1:16:11] they begin to to cool off and they start
[1:16:14] to drift from the absolute. No more
[1:16:16] fire. No, no, no more no more passion to
[1:16:20] know his word. No more reaching out into
[1:16:23] the spirit.
[1:16:25] Ashamed of the manifestations.
[1:16:30] Am I talking to somebody?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Look, I I I don't know. I just know how
[1:16:35] a prophet taught it. There ain't very
[1:16:37] many going
[1:16:41] But I just want to be right
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and I want to go.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And if God has sent a message and a
[1:16:48] vindicated prophet to show the air of of
[1:16:51] the church ages and where each church
[1:16:53] got off and how he's calling us back uh
[1:16:55] uh to a total surrender and a total
[1:16:58] manifestation of the word, then I say,
[1:16:59] "Oh God, it behooves unto me to say,
[1:17:01] Lord, forgive me. I repent, Father. Uh
[1:17:04] make the correction in my life. I want
[1:17:07] to be right.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; No more fire. Having a form of
[1:17:13] godliness,
[1:17:15] but look at the condition that he's
[1:17:17] painting out of this age of how he said
[1:17:19] it's it's all died out. And a a and it's
[1:17:23] just blackness of ashes is about all
[1:17:25] that is left. And I was just thinking
[1:17:27] about that. It makes me think of the
[1:17:29] condition of Lady Oia. how how just
[1:17:32] gross darkness uh gross darkness upon
[1:17:34] the people and and how the revival fires
[1:17:37] were once burning around the country,
[1:17:39] but you would think that it's all just
[1:17:40] burnt down. It's it's just like a bunch
[1:17:42] of ashes and blackness now and chaos and
[1:17:45] and Lady Osia has just pressed its way
[1:17:48] into every front. But I want to say that
[1:17:51] out of the ashes,
[1:17:53] out of the darkness and out of the
[1:17:55] blackness, God has called a people to
[1:17:57] rise up out of the ashes that there
[1:17:59] would be a people. God always has a
[1:18:01] representative. Just as Elisha cried
[1:18:03] out, he said, "Oh, I'm the only one."
[1:18:05] God said, "No, you're not the only one.
[1:18:06] I have 7,000 reserved unto me that have
[1:18:08] not been." God has a remnant. God has a
[1:18:11] bride. And and I don't care how dark the
[1:18:13] pressure is and how bad it gets. And and
[1:18:15] everybody else lets down the standard.
[1:18:17] And everybody else has a form of
[1:18:18] godliness. And everybody else is just
[1:18:20] going to just going to get by the skin
[1:18:21] of their teeth. And they'll just go to
[1:18:23] church when they want to go to church.
[1:18:24] They they'll just listen to a tape when
[1:18:26] they want to listen to I want to be so
[1:18:27] sold out and died out to my will that
[1:18:30] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[1:18:31] come in and taken complete control of my
[1:18:34] life, of my mind, that it's no longer my
[1:18:36] will. It's no longer my my wants. It's
[1:18:38] no longer my desires. That I want to
[1:18:40] pray. I want to listen to the tapes. I
[1:18:42] want to listen to the Bible. I need more
[1:18:43] revelation. Lord, I want a greater
[1:18:45] revelation of Ephesians and First
[1:18:47] Corinthians and and Romans and the book
[1:18:48] of Revelations and Genesis. Oh, it's an
[1:18:50] everlasting fountain. Lord, I want to
[1:18:52] know more. We live in an age of
[1:18:54] information. We give so much of our time
[1:18:56] to to learning about stuff that don't
[1:18:58] even matter.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We've educated ourselves into fields of
[1:19:04] study that makes no difference.
[1:19:08] Countless hours of time
[1:19:13] in studying just because the information
[1:19:15] is available.
[1:19:18] When we have an open book,
[1:19:21] [snorts]
[1:19:22] am I am I speaking bride language?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; We have an open book.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; For for maybe somebody doesn't know when
[1:19:30] I say an open book, the truths of the
[1:19:32] Bible were hidden.
[1:19:35] Men probed in the book of Revelation.
[1:19:38] They probed at what the meaning of the
[1:19:40] scriptures were and they were they were
[1:19:42] lacking the revelation. But God has sent
[1:19:44] a vindicated prophet
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; to take what was once a closed book of
[1:19:49] redemption
[1:19:51] and to tear the seals off and reveal to
[1:19:53] you who you are and who he is and the
[1:19:56] hour that we're now living in.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And you cannot exhaust it.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; But I wonder how much time you've spent
[1:20:04] on the internet verse your Bible. I
[1:20:07] wonder how much time you've spent in
[1:20:08] school. Well, I don't want to use that
[1:20:10] because I maybe make some people, you
[1:20:12] know, you can go to school and you can
[1:20:14] study with the Holy Ghost and don't
[1:20:16] don't let the devil beat you up on that.
[1:20:18] We we live in a society where we got to
[1:20:20] plant our potatoes and we got to go to
[1:20:22] work. But I say while you're doing it,
[1:20:24] be attentive to the Holy Ghost
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; and ask the God to use it and look for
[1:20:28] parallels and types and things and and
[1:20:30] when it's man's ideas and say, "Man,
[1:20:31] that is contrary to the word of God."
[1:20:34] You know, allow that tutor to be there
[1:20:35] walking with you. But we we we we find
[1:20:38] out if we're not careful. We allow all
[1:20:40] these things. But I want to just say in
[1:20:42] the midst of all the blackness, in the
[1:20:43] midst of all the darkness, God is
[1:20:45] calling out a people. He's calling a
[1:20:47] bride. And the prophet of God would say
[1:20:48] it like this. But at the opening of the
[1:20:50] seven seals, Revelations 10, the full
[1:20:52] word is to be born into manifestation
[1:20:54] again and vindicated by the spirit of
[1:20:57] God in the full strength as it was when
[1:20:59] he was here on the earth. Manifested in
[1:21:02] the same way, doing the same things that
[1:21:04] it did when it was here on earth. Amen.
[1:21:07] The full maturity of the word being
[1:21:09] birthed in a people.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Not not just a knowledge, not just an
[1:21:16] education, but the full maturity of the
[1:21:19] word living in the bride by the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost. The literal life of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:24] Come on. That's what the token is. The
[1:21:26] literal life of Jesus Christ in you. In
[1:21:29] you. In you. Well, Jesus said you know
[1:21:31] them by their fruits. If you want to
[1:21:33] know if it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ living out through you, look at
[1:21:37] your fruits. Look at the things you do.
[1:21:39] Look at the things you give your time
[1:21:40] and your attention to. Look, we're not
[1:21:42] condemning you. We're encouraging you to
[1:21:44] walk into the inheritance that has been
[1:21:46] opened up to you by the revealing of the
[1:21:48] word.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we start to
[1:21:51] drift. We get laxed. We listen to things
[1:21:53] we shouldn't listen to. We we listen to
[1:21:55] music. We I mean, some of us it it I
[1:21:59] can't I can't believe it. I can't
[1:22:00] understand it. those things were my
[1:22:02] struggle. But we have we we have ones
[1:22:04] that that God has done a work in their
[1:22:05] life, but they're still listening to
[1:22:07] worldly music.
[1:22:09] We we have uh ones amongst us that that
[1:22:11] you you know there's there's things that
[1:22:13] you give your time and attention to that
[1:22:14] Jesus Christ would not give us time and
[1:22:16] attention to.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil uh uh lie to you
[1:22:20] and tell you that, well, I'll just be in
[1:22:22] this sticky nature and and I got to have
[1:22:25] fun somehow. I just I I want to tell
[1:22:27] you, oh, your entertainment should be
[1:22:29] the Holy Ghost. Your entertainment
[1:22:31] should be the word of God. Your
[1:22:32] entertainment should be crying out in
[1:22:34] the spirit. There ought to be a cry of
[1:22:35] joy in the believers of the hour, a cry
[1:22:38] of joy and a moving of the spirit in
[1:22:40] your life.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; But we've gotten latched.
[1:22:47] We have a form.
[1:22:52] But I say we can rise up out of the
[1:22:55] blackness and out of the chaos.
[1:22:58] We could rise up like Job from the ashes
[1:23:01] by revelation that
[1:23:03] yet in my flesh I'll see God.
[1:23:08] We could rise up and know that we are
[1:23:10] living in the hour of the full
[1:23:12] restoration of the word.
[1:23:16] Maybe just
[1:23:18] try to move from some things just to
[1:23:20] make pace.
[1:23:25] But just thinking I was listening to
[1:23:26] modern events made clear by prophecy and
[1:23:30] just something that's been on my heart,
[1:23:31] you know, and and here here we we we we
[1:23:35] want to it behooves us to recognize the
[1:23:38] the hour in the day that we are now
[1:23:41] living in. And brother Brandon would
[1:23:43] take his text uh how the disciples were
[1:23:46] they were they were walking with the
[1:23:47] Lord Jesus. And he he comes up to him
[1:23:49] and and and and and you know uh you know
[1:23:53] starts to talk to him and and you know
[1:23:55] why are you so sad? why are you so down?
[1:23:57] And they start to explain to him, well,
[1:23:59] you know, uh, with the Jesus Christ, the
[1:24:01] the Messiah, the one which was was to
[1:24:03] come and and now they've they've killed
[1:24:05] him and and he's gone and and we don't
[1:24:07] know what to do. And and and just to
[1:24:09] think now that they are walking with the
[1:24:11] resurrected word
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; and they're sad.
[1:24:21] I got to go back to church to go back to
[1:24:23] work tomorrow.
[1:24:25] I got to pay the bills.
[1:24:28] You know, the prophet's been gone for 60
[1:24:30] years and we're going to go in a rapture
[1:24:33] someday. I thought, you know, I thought
[1:24:35] I thought the squeeze would have done
[1:24:36] this or that and I'm just being squeezed
[1:24:38] and my head hurts. There's no big great
[1:24:41] manifestations. I'm It's just little old
[1:24:44] me.
[1:24:46] Oh, fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:24:50] all that the prophets have spoken.
[1:24:53] They they were walking in the greatest
[1:24:55] hour. They were walking in the greatest
[1:24:58] moment.
[1:24:59] The spoken word that had been made flesh
[1:25:02] had now fulfilled the the prophecies
[1:25:04] that had been spoken of him. He's now
[1:25:07] been resurrected and he's walking with
[1:25:09] them. And the disciples are there
[1:25:11] wondering and downtrodden because they
[1:25:13] don't recognize the hour in which they
[1:25:17] are living.
[1:25:20] And if you my I just say you would if
[1:25:22] you would go listen to events made clear
[1:25:24] by prophecy. Uh he's showing that the
[1:25:28] very words that have been spoken in the
[1:25:30] written word in the Bible prophesied in
[1:25:32] the day that we are now living have been
[1:25:35] fulfilled.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:25:40] And and just as uh just as the prophet
[1:25:43] fulfilled the scriptures it was
[1:25:46] prophecies confirmed. I want to tell you
[1:25:47] that you are also prophecy confirmed
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; because we can stand here now according
[1:25:54] to a vindicated prophet who has spoken
[1:25:56] about a many membered bride body that
[1:25:59] would live out the fullness of the word
[1:26:01] that has been spoken. Look, you're
[1:26:03] called to put demons under your feet.
[1:26:05] You're you're you're called to lay hands
[1:26:06] on the sick and they recover. You're
[1:26:08] called to know the mysteries. You're
[1:26:10] called to speak to the mountain. You're
[1:26:12] called to possess the land. You're
[1:26:13] called to an inheritance. And I say
[1:26:15] there ought to be a people. You are not
[1:26:17] downtrodded. You are not wondering. You
[1:26:19] are not guessing. You're not uh this
[1:26:21] God's not coming up to you and say, "Why
[1:26:23] are you so sad?" But there's a people
[1:26:25] that the cry of joy is in their hearts.
[1:26:28] They are on fire for the revelation of
[1:26:31] the hour. And there's no demon. There's
[1:26:33] no doubt. There ain't no preacher going
[1:26:35] to shut this son of God up because I
[1:26:37] know who I am. I got a revelation of the
[1:26:40] hour that I am now living in. I will put
[1:26:43] death under my feet. I will put every
[1:26:45] demon under my feet. There won't be no
[1:26:48] anxiety. There won't be no depression.
[1:26:50] There won't be no generational curses.
[1:26:52] There will be nothing to hold me down
[1:26:54] there. I'm telling you, I know who I am.
[1:26:57] And I know whom I am believed in. And I
[1:27:00] am persuaded. There ain't no height.
[1:27:02] There ain't no depth. There ain't no
[1:27:04] demon. There ain't no devil. There ain't
[1:27:06] no trial that's going to keep me out of
[1:27:08] my promised land. I will be like Caleb.
[1:27:10] Give me my mountain.
[1:27:14] I am a son of God. [screaming]
[1:27:16] I was birthed here and lad for a
[1:27:18] purpose.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; To take my inheritance.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I won't back up. I won't quit. And I
[1:27:25] won't sit down.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; I know who I am, and I know where I'm
[1:27:28] going.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't recognize
[1:27:39] the hour in which they were living.
[1:27:45] Scripture says in Galatians 6:7, "Be not
[1:27:47] deceived. God is not mocked. For
[1:27:49] whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he
[1:27:51] also reap. For he that sweth to his
[1:27:54] flesh shall also of the flesh reap
[1:27:55] corruption.
[1:28:01] But he that sweth to the spirit shall
[1:28:04] also of the spirit reap life
[1:28:08] everlasting."
[1:28:09] Oh, I want to just say the the words
[1:28:11] that have been spoken by Malachi 4:5 and
[1:28:15] Luke 17:3 is the spoken word being made
[1:28:17] flesh in you.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; You are the royal seed of the word.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And and what did God tell Abraham? He
[1:28:26] said,"Abraham, I I've given you a
[1:28:27] promise. Rise up and walk through the
[1:28:30] land."
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Abraham. Rise up and walk
[1:28:34] through the land. Look, if somebody
[1:28:36] could number the dust of the earth,
[1:28:37] that's what your seat will be. Look to
[1:28:39] the right. Look to the left. Look
[1:28:42] forward and back. I give it all to you.
[1:28:44] Rise up and walk through the land. I
[1:28:46] tell you, why are we sitting around? Why
[1:28:49] are we sitting idle? Why aren't we
[1:28:50] rising up? Why aren't we walking? Is it
[1:28:52] because we don't recognize the promise?
[1:28:56] Prophet of God said, he said, "Rise and
[1:28:59] walk through the land because you
[1:29:00] possess it all." He said, "As we become
[1:29:02] Christians and filled with the Holy
[1:29:03] Spirit, we're seeds of Abraham and heirs
[1:29:06] of every promise. So just walk through
[1:29:08] the land. Every bit of it is yours."
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; But so many times we look at the
[1:29:16] opposition.
[1:29:20] It's a I mean, this message is real.
[1:29:23] Glory to God. This message is real. But
[1:29:27] there's some giants in there.
[1:29:30] I mean, I I meant not me. I need a David
[1:29:33] or a Joshua.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; You are David or Joshua.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Those were all shadows and types.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I could preach there for a while.
[1:29:43] There's a quote where Brother Brandon
[1:29:44] says, "All of those were just shadows
[1:29:46] and types of what God was wanting to
[1:29:47] do." Look, just as Satan came into God's
[1:29:50] Eden
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and caused his family to fall, God has
[1:29:55] raised up his family and Satan's Eden is
[1:29:57] [screaming] causing them to be
[1:29:58] overcomers,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; causing them to overcome the God of this
[1:30:02] evil age, causing you to overcome your
[1:30:04] weaknesses, causing you to overcome your
[1:30:06] failures, causing you to go to the
[1:30:08] school and the highways and the
[1:30:10] workplaces and be an overcomer.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; God wants to use you.
[1:30:16] Wait, where's the cry of joy?
[1:30:20] See that Abraham and Jo I mean Joshua
[1:30:22] and Caleb, they had a cry of joy.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. It's a good
[1:30:28] land flowing with milk and honey. Let's
[1:30:31] go into it.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You would think
[1:30:36] the same God that brought him out of
[1:30:37] Egypt.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; What about the same God that's been
[1:30:40] keeping you? Come on, young people.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; The same God that's been keeping you.
[1:30:44] Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Young and old, like the same God that's
[1:30:46] been keeping you in the most wicked age.
[1:30:48] You're still here. You could have given
[1:30:49] up. You could have ran off. You could
[1:30:51] have ran off with that boy or that girl,
[1:30:52] but you didn't.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; When you might have wanted to, but
[1:30:55] something's been keeping you.
[1:30:56] Something's been watching out over your
[1:30:58] life because you're a seed of God.
[1:31:00] You're a gene seed thought of God. God
[1:31:02] had a thought of you, an expression of
[1:31:04] you, and he placed you in this hour,
[1:31:06] knowing what he put inside of you that
[1:31:08] when you would catch the revelation of
[1:31:10] who you are, you would defeat the very
[1:31:11] enemy that's trying to take you down.
[1:31:17] Now I just try to as we're move getting
[1:31:20] close out of time I want to move into
[1:31:22] maybe our thought here. So when Elisha
[1:31:25] in our text spoke thus sayith the Lord
[1:31:27] he said tomorrow about this time shall a
[1:31:29] measure of fine flour be sold for a
[1:31:31] shekele and two measures of barley for a
[1:31:33] shekele in the gate of Samaria. I just
[1:31:35] want to say that that was the power of
[1:31:37] prophecy.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. that there was nothing that could
[1:31:40] stop the power of prophecy that had been
[1:31:43] spoken. And I I don't have the time to
[1:31:45] lay this in there, but but you have a
[1:31:47] place and you have a position and you
[1:31:49] are part of that word that has been
[1:31:50] spoken.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; And and the devil tries to make you
[1:31:53] doubt that part. He he tries to to make
[1:31:55] you doubt your inheritance and your
[1:31:56] portion in the word and and he tries to
[1:31:59] strip you of the inheritance that God
[1:32:02] has given to you and tries to make your
[1:32:03] portion so small and so little. It's
[1:32:06] just to go to church here and there and
[1:32:08] it's it's just to listen here and there.
[1:32:09] But I want to tell you, you you have
[1:32:11] been called and and raised up to sit in
[1:32:13] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You
[1:32:16] have an inheritance that that cannot be
[1:32:18] exhausted.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Well, is that okay?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Or do we just, you know, is it is it too
[1:32:26] hard?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Let's just pack it in. You know, lady is
[1:32:29] too hard. It's too hard. You know,
[1:32:32] there's too much entertainment. There's
[1:32:33] too much music.
[1:32:35] too much on the cell phone. You know
[1:32:36] what? Maybe that's what we ought to do.
[1:32:38] We ought to compromise.
[1:32:40] I mean, you know, we believe the
[1:32:42] message. If after all, we're bride. You
[1:32:44] know, if we're bride, we're bride. I can
[1:32:46] change that. You know, after all, if my
[1:32:48] name was on the Lamb's book of life
[1:32:49] before the foundation of the world,
[1:32:51] there's nothing I could do to miss it
[1:32:52] anyway. So, you know, it's hard not to
[1:32:55] It's hard not to to look and to lust.
[1:32:58] It's it's, you know, I it's it's hard
[1:33:01] not to to watch entertainment. It's not
[1:33:04] It's hard not to get caught up in
[1:33:05] sports. It's It's hard not to allow the
[1:33:07] fashion. So, we'll just let's just find
[1:33:09] Let's just cross over a little bit.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Borderline believers.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Borderline believers. Some of us are
[1:33:18] just right on the border.
[1:33:21] You've had an experience. God's done
[1:33:22] something wonderful in your life. You
[1:33:24] believe God's had a pro God sent a
[1:33:26] prophet and you've crossed over, but
[1:33:27] we've stopped. We've we sat down.
[1:33:31] We we've manifested a portion of the
[1:33:33] word, but God want to wants to manifest
[1:33:35] the fullness of the word.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And we could take time to go into it,
[1:33:39] but we've seen what that looks like in a
[1:33:41] first one to maturity.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; But sometimes the giant in our land is
[1:33:45] what we think is impossible.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could never.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I I I could never. Brother Brandham
[1:33:52] could have never either.
[1:33:55] Do you realize, brother Brandham, it it
[1:33:58] was because of his part and his portion
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; that was in the mind of God before the
[1:34:04] foundation of the world that brought him
[1:34:05] into his position?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't something Brother Brandham
[1:34:09] decided to do.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; What happened at the age of seven? A
[1:34:15] whirlwind got caught up in a tree and
[1:34:17] said, "Don't defile [screaming]
[1:34:18] your body. Don't drink or smoke or do
[1:34:20] anything for I have a work for you to
[1:34:21] do.
[1:34:24] Did brother Brandham try to drink?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Did he try to smoke?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Did he try to commit suicide
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; twice?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And then we're over here. Well, I'm not
[1:34:40] the bride because I drink. I'm not the
[1:34:42] bride because I can't be the bride
[1:34:44] because I'm having thoughts of suicide.
[1:34:46] Let God minister to somebody's heart
[1:34:48] right now.
[1:34:50] If the prophet could can come into a
[1:34:52] place of such agony and discouragement,
[1:34:55] what about a people who's caught a
[1:34:57] vision of the greatest word that has
[1:34:59] ever been spoken and you know that I am
[1:35:01] the individual that spoke to walk into
[1:35:03] the fullness of that word, but then we
[1:35:05] got all these little things hanging on
[1:35:07] to us. generational curses and abuses
[1:35:10] and things we went through as a child
[1:35:11] where you were taken advantage of and
[1:35:13] spirits have followed you around with
[1:35:15] depression and doubt and things of agony
[1:35:18] and it makes you question your calling
[1:35:21] to where you just want to give up and
[1:35:23] quit. No different than the prophet of
[1:35:25] the age. But there was something
[1:35:27] following his life. No matter when he
[1:35:29] wanted to give up, no matter when he
[1:35:31] wanted to quit, there was a pillar of
[1:35:33] fire that was following him.
[1:35:35] And there's a pillar of fire following
[1:35:37] you
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; to bring you into every promise.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That ought to be a cry of joy. That
[1:35:45] ought to make somebody shout
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; to know I couldn't even mess it up. When
[1:35:49] I tried to give up, when I did this or
[1:35:52] that
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; see when Elisha had spoke, thus said the
[1:36:00] Lord, nothing could stop it. And brother
[1:36:02] Bannon said this just to lay this in
[1:36:04] there. He said, "As long as your seed
[1:36:06] inside growing, you have to produce just
[1:36:08] exactly what the seed said you would
[1:36:11] do."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's exactly it's his word.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; He keeps his word.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; He watches over it.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's watching over me.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I said he's watching over me. When I was
[1:36:30] out there in the world, he was watching
[1:36:33] over me. When I got in that car wreck,
[1:36:36] he was watching over me. When I was in
[1:36:38] that drug house, he was [screaming]
[1:36:40] watching over me. When I was in that
[1:36:42] jail cell, he was watching over me. When
[1:36:45] I made my worst decision of my life, he
[1:36:47] was watching over me.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. I say, do you know grace?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Grace who? The grace of God,
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; he's watching over you
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; because you are his word, his thought.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; He He's He's watching over you. You have
[1:37:18] to produce just exactly
[1:37:20] what the seed said you would.
[1:37:24] First Thessalonians says, "Faithful is
[1:37:25] he that calleth you, who also will do
[1:37:28] it."
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Does anybody feel the call of God in
[1:37:31] your life?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; It's his calling.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Is he calling you to live a higher
[1:37:38] calling?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Do Do you know when you do wrong and you
[1:37:42] listen to things and you do things and
[1:37:43] you wear things and you do all these
[1:37:44] things, you know you shouldn't do
[1:37:45] something inside of you say, "Well,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I I know I shouldn't."
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; He's calling to you.
[1:37:52] Satan wants to condemn you. Christ is
[1:37:54] calling you
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and he's telling you if I'm calling you,
[1:37:57] I will do it.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Well, you got to surrender to it. You
[1:38:00] got to let him do it. He's a gentleman.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I just, you know, we we'll try to
[1:38:05] be about 20 more minutes and find a
[1:38:08] place to close.
[1:38:12] But hold that in your in your in your
[1:38:14] thought. And I just maybe for a quick
[1:38:15] moment I want to help somebody because
[1:38:19] sometimes we allow our humanity to get
[1:38:22] in the way of walking into the promises
[1:38:25] of God.
[1:38:28] Is that okay?
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Is everybody still with me?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Do we need to take a recess?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes or all the time because this
[1:38:39] is our worst enemy. It's our humanity,
[1:38:43] right? just like those children of
[1:38:44] Israel. It's a it's a good land. It's a
[1:38:46] good word. I believe it, but but I can't
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; I can't possess it.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; I I'm not able. And and Brother Brandham
[1:38:54] said, "If you watch the natural birth,
[1:38:55] it's more of a mystery than the virgin
[1:38:57] birth.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; It's determined whether it's going to be
[1:39:00] a boy or a girl, redheaded, blackheaded,
[1:39:02] or what what it's determined by God.
[1:39:05] And and many times we we we allow our
[1:39:08] complexes and our and our our family
[1:39:10] tree and and the and the way things have
[1:39:13] come to to plague our minds with
[1:39:15] complexes.
[1:39:18] A and and our self-esteem can be just
[1:39:20] riddled and we feel like we're not
[1:39:22] pretty enough or or we don't look good
[1:39:24] enough and and I'm too short, I'm too
[1:39:26] skinny, I'm too big, I'm too wide and
[1:39:28] and all of these things. Satan will use
[1:39:31] those to plague your mind,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; causing complexes and fears
[1:39:37] when if you could accept
[1:39:41] by revelation,
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; you showed up just the way God wanted
[1:39:47] you to.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not faster. I can't jump high.
[1:39:56] I let God deal with somebody's heart
[1:39:58] because these are real problems that we
[1:40:00] battle.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And Satan plagues you in the natural in
[1:40:04] those realms of complexes and it
[1:40:05] actually keeps you from walking into the
[1:40:07] word that's been spoken over your life.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Help me preach.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; If I say something you believe, just say
[1:40:16] amen. It won't hurt you.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; You operate the gift.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; If you forgot that, that's what the
[1:40:22] prophet taught.
[1:40:24] So if you don't get nothing out of the
[1:40:25] service, it ain't my fault,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; But praise God, individuals can operate
[1:40:32] it and be blessed and people can go out,
[1:40:34] man, I didn't get nothing out of that
[1:40:35] preacher. Don't do nothing for me. And
[1:40:37] other people can, man,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; like God was discerning the thoughts and
[1:40:41] intents of my heart. I'm a new person.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; And and you're over there looking like
[1:40:45] really I didn't I don't The only thing I
[1:40:49] got out of that was he's a Mcgiri. It's
[1:40:52] all I could see in them.
[1:40:55] It happens. But let's move into the word
[1:40:58] and realize that these complexes and
[1:41:00] these things in our life and and and the
[1:41:02] way we look and the way that we were we
[1:41:04] were born with look generational curses
[1:41:07] and and people born into situations to
[1:41:09] where they were taken advantage of as as
[1:41:11] little kids. And a a a and and look, I'm
[1:41:15] not out of the message. I'm right there.
[1:41:17] Brother Brandham discerning the thoughts
[1:41:18] and intents of that girl that was
[1:41:19] battling fear and anxiety. And he traced
[1:41:21] it all the way back to a dog that was
[1:41:23] chasing her as a little girl.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And you don't think in the most wicked
[1:41:27] age that we've ever lived in in the
[1:41:28] things that our kids are exposed to.
[1:41:30] Look, it it don't have to be manifested
[1:41:32] in the flesh. Now, people are being
[1:41:34] exposed to things digitally that are
[1:41:35] having the same effects on them.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; And you don't understand why the fear.
[1:41:39] You don't understand why the anxiety
[1:41:41] because you've been digitally raped. And
[1:41:43] I I know that sounds harsh. And I know
[1:41:45] that sounds That sounds harsh, but if
[1:41:47] you look at the at the the symptoms and
[1:41:50] if you look at the behavior of somebody
[1:41:53] that has been physically taken advantage
[1:41:55] of, it manifest in somebody that has
[1:41:57] been digitally robbed of their purity.
[1:42:01] And that's why uh sisters in the message
[1:42:03] that that are battling pornography, it
[1:42:05] just ain't the brothers anymore. And
[1:42:06] they're battling thoughts of fear and
[1:42:09] depression and anxiety and
[1:42:11] self-worthlessness and they want to
[1:42:12] commit suicide. Why? because they've
[1:42:15] been exposed to something digitally
[1:42:17] that's robbed them of their virtue.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And now that spirit
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; follows them and they don't know why
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're exposed.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; You can't hold that daughter of God. You
[1:42:38] can't hold that son of God because the
[1:42:40] word has gone forth to discern the
[1:42:41] thought intent of the heart and you can
[1:42:43] be free in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:46] Free from the doubt. Free from the
[1:42:47] unbelief. Free from the anxiety. Free
[1:42:49] from the curse of your past because the
[1:42:51] blood of Jesus Christ has come to break
[1:42:53] the generational curses.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; But you see, it starts a chain reaction
[1:43:01] is what we're laboring at. How one
[1:43:03] little exposure, one little thing as a
[1:43:05] kid can cause a chain of reaction and
[1:43:07] form a thought, form a nervousness and
[1:43:10] situations and panic attacks where you
[1:43:13] can hardly breathe and you feel like
[1:43:15] your life is going to end. That's a
[1:43:18] spirit.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; But the word can catch it and discern it
[1:43:24] and expose it. And I want to tell you
[1:43:26] the word of God will be defeat the devil
[1:43:29] any place on any grounds on any time.
[1:43:33] Satan you are defeated.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Greatest battle ever fought. I was just
[1:43:43] thinking about this. The problem is a
[1:43:45] lot of times we stop and listen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Is everybody feeling okay?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Many times we stop and listen.
[1:43:55] We're we're going along and God's done a
[1:43:57] wonderful work in our life and and we're
[1:43:59] on fire for God and and we're walking
[1:44:01] we're walking down the road and and now
[1:44:04] we're doing good and all of a sudden.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I used to go there.
[1:44:09] Oh, that's where so and so. Yeah. You
[1:44:11] know what? I wonder what they're up to.
[1:44:14] Nowadays, it does. It's not the barroom.
[1:44:16] It's not the dance room. It's the
[1:44:18] internet.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; It's Instagram and Facebook. Look, Nelly
[1:44:22] Sanders. You know the story about Nelly
[1:44:23] Sanders? She had to physically stop and
[1:44:26] walk up to the place where she used to
[1:44:27] socialize.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; But now all you got to do is log on to
[1:44:32] whatever the new and improved thing is.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Tell a young person about Facebook,
[1:44:36] they're like, "Man, you're a dinosaur.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; What is it? What's the new platform?"
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok, Instagram, Snapchat. Is there
[1:44:48] Is there What's the new and upcoming
[1:44:50] one?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:44:54] Well, that that that took a name name
[1:44:56] change, right? All of those things. All
[1:44:59] you got to do, I wonder what so and so
[1:45:02] is up to now.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; You better watch out.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; You You might be in danger of losing
[1:45:09] your first love.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; How do men and women get into places
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; they never should have been because they
[1:45:16] get a little curious? Well, I wonder how
[1:45:18] so and so is doing. Watch out.
[1:45:25] And all of a sudden you're on Snapchat,
[1:45:27] Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Instagram,
[1:45:31] [laughter]
[1:45:34] and all of a sudden you got a divided
[1:45:36] heart.
[1:45:39] Oh, hey, I was wondering about you, too.
[1:45:42] You remember that time
[1:45:44] miss so and so in class and you fell
[1:45:46] over the chair?
[1:45:48] Hey, some of us are going to be over
[1:45:50] Starbucks.
[1:45:51] Yeah, maybe I'll witness to them.
[1:45:55] Exactly what Nelly Sanders did.
[1:45:58] Maybe I'll just witness. I'll just log
[1:46:02] in.
[1:46:04] It's just the
[1:46:06] 20, 10 year, whatever anniversary of my
[1:46:09] class.
[1:46:11] I'll just
[1:46:13] Well, I don't know where we're at, but
[1:46:14] we're here.
[1:46:16] And all of a sudden, before Nelly
[1:46:18] Sanders knew it,
[1:46:21] she was right back in there in the arms
[1:46:24] of another man.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Chain reaction.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Chain of events. Stop just to listen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I'll just testify. I'll just look. I'll
[1:46:35] just say hi. I'll just I'll just I'll
[1:46:38] just
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Some of us there's been a chain reaction
[1:46:44] that has started in your life from I'll
[1:46:46] just
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; and you're in bondage. She come uh
[1:46:53] running down to brother Brandham's
[1:46:54] house. I want to tell you at least she
[1:46:55] knew where to go.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. At least she
[1:47:02] knew where to run to. I want to tell
[1:47:04] you, if you ever get in trouble, if you
[1:47:07] ever find yourself out somewhere where
[1:47:09] you don't belong, I want to tell you
[1:47:11] there's a place you can run to, and it
[1:47:14] don't have to be a house down the
[1:47:15] street. You can run into the arms
[1:47:17] [screaming] of Almighty God. He'll wrap
[1:47:19] his arms around you. He'll tell you, "I
[1:47:21] forgive you."
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; She knew where to run to. She ran down
[1:47:29] to Brother Brandham's house and pounded
[1:47:30] on the door. And brother Brandon had
[1:47:32] taken in his friend Wayne who was a
[1:47:34] drunk. He was trying to get him to sew
[1:47:36] her up. And Nelly come banging on the
[1:47:38] book door. Brother Brandon, brother,
[1:47:39] brother. Brother, brother, I've done it.
[1:47:40] I blew it. I've gone too far. I've I I
[1:47:45] I've messed it all up. He said, "Nelly,
[1:47:46] calm down. What's wrong? What's wrong? I
[1:47:48] just stopped to listen. I just stopped
[1:47:50] to listen." And before you knew it,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; God's talking to somebody.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; If you're tired and falling asleep, just
[1:47:57] stand up.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You'll make everybody think you're into
[1:47:59] the service. Right?
[1:48:03] [clears throat]
[1:48:05] And he started praying for her. And
[1:48:07] brother Brenn said, "I don't know much
[1:48:08] about the Bible, but one thing I do
[1:48:10] know." And he started to cast that evil
[1:48:13] spirit out.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "You spirit, whatever
[1:48:18] you are, she didn't mean to do that.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; But you come out of her in the name of
[1:48:28] Jesus Christ. You can't hold her any
[1:48:31] longer. And I want to say the same
[1:48:33] message of the hour has come and said
[1:48:35] you were trapped into it. You didn't
[1:48:37] mean to do it in the first place. Satan,
[1:48:40] I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:48:42] Christ. Come out of her. She didn't mean
[1:48:44] to do it.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, I needed a message like that.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; And I needed a message when I got all
[1:48:52] messed up and I made a mess of things
[1:48:54] and I made a bad mistake. I know where
[1:48:56] to run into the arms of [screaming]
[1:48:58] Jehovah.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, some of us are just bound.
[1:49:07] Just bound.
[1:49:09] Just bound by circumstance. The cry of
[1:49:12] joy is gone.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; It's just gone.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; The cry for the manifestation of the
[1:49:21] move of the spirit, it's just gone.
[1:49:23] We're tired of fighting for it.
[1:49:26] We're tired of believing for it.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't wrong
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; because we start losing our first love
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; and we start to invest our time and our
[1:49:42] attention and our effort in other
[1:49:45] things.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm just saying what a prophet
[1:49:50] said.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; But you can be liberated. Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; You can be free.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; You can catch the revelation. I didn't
[1:50:01] mean to do it. I didn't mean to get to
[1:50:03] this place.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; That you can run to the message of the
[1:50:07] hour and you can be restored.
[1:50:10] Right on time.
[1:50:15] Maybe somebody here, you stopped for a
[1:50:16] moment and you wonder how you got here.
[1:50:20] I want to tell you there's another
[1:50:22] voice.
[1:50:24] There's a voice of prophecy. There's a
[1:50:26] prophetic word that has been spoken over
[1:50:29] your life. And I would just want to say
[1:50:31] as we're going to start moving towards a
[1:50:33] close that you are called to be that
[1:50:37] word
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; made flesh.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, shake yourself now. Hit your
[1:50:43] neighbor and say, "Wake up.
[1:50:46] Wake up."
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Now hit the other neighbor. Say, "Wake
[1:50:49] up.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Wake up."
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Shake yourself.
[1:50:53] It It's We're in extra innings,
[1:50:55] overtime. You don't want to miss a
[1:50:57] walk-off, do you?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:03] I say it's, you know, they they they Oh
[1:51:06] my I don't want to go there. But anyhow,
[1:51:08] I know where we're going.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody's awake now.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I like what Brother Zachary
[1:51:17] Wallace said one time. He said, uh, he
[1:51:20] said, "I figured if I put him to sleep,
[1:51:22] I'm responsible for waking him up."
[1:51:26] I was like, "I'm gonna borrow that one."
[1:51:28] So, if I wake you up, I apologize. I put
[1:51:30] you to sleep.
[1:51:32] But just just moving in this line of how
[1:51:36] remember, we're talking about a chain of
[1:51:37] events or a chain reaction about how one
[1:51:39] decision can lead to another and it can
[1:51:41] cause a chain reaction. And now we're
[1:51:43] looking at when when God spoke, when his
[1:51:45] word was spoke and it was prophesied, it
[1:51:48] was going to cause a trigger or or set
[1:51:50] something in motion that could not be
[1:51:53] stopped.
[1:51:54] And I could just read uh uh uh uh
[1:51:57] scriptures and and prophecies that have
[1:52:00] been spoken out over your life where
[1:52:02] where where in Romans it would say, if
[1:52:04] you've been predestinated, if you're
[1:52:06] predestinated, you're you're called you
[1:52:08] who who he's called. Come on. That's a
[1:52:10] prophetic word that has been spoken over
[1:52:12] your life that look, if he called you,
[1:52:14] he's going to justify you. If he's
[1:52:15] justified you, he's going to sanctify
[1:52:17] you. If he sanctified you, he's going to
[1:52:19] glorify you. And Paul goes on to say,
[1:52:21] look, if God before us, then who can be
[1:52:22] against us? Then I I like to say it like
[1:52:25] this. The devil, he ain't got enough. If
[1:52:27] God before us, devil, you ain't got
[1:52:30] enough to stop the spoken word of God
[1:52:33] from being manifested in my life because
[1:52:36] something has already been triggered.
[1:52:38] Something has already been spoken. It
[1:52:40] will move mountains. It will fill
[1:52:42] valleys. It will beat every demon. It
[1:52:44] will beat everything away to make sure
[1:52:46] that I can step into my inheritance of
[1:52:50] what has been spoken over my life. And I
[1:52:53] realize as a son, what I got to do is
[1:52:55] just come into a greater humility, a
[1:52:57] greater surrender. And the more that I
[1:52:59] can surrender, the more he'll fill my
[1:53:02] life, that I can walk into every divine
[1:53:04] promise of God.
[1:53:09] Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; So, here we are and finally to my sermon
[1:53:14] and we'll just ask God to help us here.
[1:53:17] Feel free if you need to excuse
[1:53:18] yourself.
[1:53:20] Second Kings 6:25. So, here we are into
[1:53:23] our text and we'll try to by the help of
[1:53:25] God if 10 15 minutes. We've been about
[1:53:29] an hour and seven minutes. Is that okay?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; It's 11:55. We'll try to we'll try to
[1:53:35] have you out of here soon. But just by
[1:53:38] the help of God here, I want to use this
[1:53:40] story because in 2 Kings 6:25, this is
[1:53:44] just uh um I believe a little before our
[1:53:47] text if if I remember, but he said
[1:53:49] because it's talking about this great
[1:53:50] famine that was in Samaria
[1:53:53] and Samaria had been besieged and then
[1:53:56] it says that a donkey's head was being
[1:53:59] sold for four score pieces of silver
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; and a fourth part of cab of doves dung
[1:54:04] for five pieces of silver.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:54:07] So I I just want you to maybe try to
[1:54:09] understand what's happening here in the
[1:54:11] king of Samaria. This is when the
[1:54:13] kingdom had been divided. You had the
[1:54:14] kingdom to the south which was Judah and
[1:54:16] you had the kingdom to the north which
[1:54:18] was called uh Israel. And Samaria was
[1:54:20] the capital of the the northern kingdom.
[1:54:23] And you go all the way back after
[1:54:25] Solomon, it was split uh in two and God
[1:54:28] reserved two tribes for for David's sake
[1:54:32] uh uh uh Judah and Benjamin. And then
[1:54:34] the other 10 were given uh to the
[1:54:36] northern portion of Israel. And that's
[1:54:38] where this we're finding this story is
[1:54:39] setting in Samaria. And now um um I'm
[1:54:43] forgetting uh that the the king now that
[1:54:45] has come um and surrounded and besieged
[1:54:49] uh um Samaria. And so what that means is
[1:54:52] the armies have come down and now it's
[1:54:54] during a famine and they've surrounded
[1:54:56] Samaria. So you can't come in or out. So
[1:54:58] what whatever rations or whatever food
[1:55:00] or whatever water that you had inside
[1:55:02] the walls is all you had. And now the
[1:55:05] famine and the time is getting so bad to
[1:55:07] where you for $2,000 you could buy the
[1:55:11] head of a donkey.
[1:55:14] Anybody want to go have lunch?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; I got the head of a donkey
[1:55:19] for $2,000.
[1:55:22] People were were starving.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Remember a donkey was an unclean animal.
[1:55:27] Some people wouldn't even eat that. But
[1:55:29] when but when your your kids rib cages
[1:55:31] start sinking in and you're eating rocks
[1:55:33] and you're eating grass, it's amazing
[1:55:35] what a starving man will do to where
[1:55:38] when you you keep following this this
[1:55:40] this story here. These people are are
[1:55:42] are starving. They're surrounded by the
[1:55:44] enemy. It's just there's there's no hope
[1:55:47] for them. I mean, you talk about a time
[1:55:49] of trouble.
[1:55:51] And I want to preach on that a little
[1:55:52] bit of time of trouble, but we ain't got
[1:55:54] time for it. You can make that parallel
[1:55:56] yourself. get into Psalms 27 and listen
[1:55:58] to the rapture. But it's in the time of
[1:56:00] trouble, right? So, here they are in a
[1:56:01] time of trouble. So much so,
[1:56:05] everybody still here?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; So much so that the people were boiling
[1:56:13] their own children and eating them.
[1:56:17] And it just came about that time here in
[1:56:19] our story where where this lady she
[1:56:22] comes she comes to the king and starts
[1:56:24] to tell him like uh oh king oh king and
[1:56:26] he finally listens I need your help and
[1:56:29] the king's like what I what am I going
[1:56:31] to help you out of am I going to help
[1:56:32] you out of the wine press? Am I going to
[1:56:34] help you out of the wheat gardeners? I
[1:56:37] he said if God don't help you no one can
[1:56:39] help you. And she said well I help me
[1:56:42] help me help me. He said stay on. And
[1:56:43] she said, "Look, me and this woman, we
[1:56:44] made an agreement that that yesterday we
[1:56:47] would eat my child and today we would
[1:56:49] eat hers
[1:56:51] and we boiled mine and did eat and today
[1:56:54] when we were supposed to boil hers and
[1:56:56] eat
[1:57:00] and the king ran his clothes and he
[1:57:03] actually got mad and upset at Elisha
[1:57:08] because now Elisha, he had the authority
[1:57:11] to call for rain. He he he he made an
[1:57:13] axe head float. He he he made a barrel
[1:57:16] not run dry. He he he did all these
[1:57:19] wonderful miracles and now the people of
[1:57:21] God are suffering and a a a and a and a
[1:57:24] famine's been called for. And so what he
[1:57:25] you know what he starts to do? He starts
[1:57:27] to get mad at God's prophet. Ain't that
[1:57:29] just like the people today when things
[1:57:32] don't go your way and when things aren't
[1:57:33] adding up the way they you just want to
[1:57:35] blame the message and you want to blame
[1:57:37] the word of God and say, "Well, maybe
[1:57:38] the message ain't everything that I
[1:57:40] thought it was. I didn't think I'd be c
[1:57:41] persecuted. I didn't think my family
[1:57:43] would walk away from me. I thought it
[1:57:45] would convert my husband. I thought it
[1:57:46] would convert this. I thought it would
[1:57:48] save my I thought it would do all this.
[1:57:49] And then in a time of trouble, when
[1:57:51] everything's heaping up against you, and
[1:57:53] you're you're so mad and angry that this
[1:57:55] healing didn't come and you lost that
[1:57:57] loved one, and if you're not careful,
[1:57:59] you'll take an attitude towards the word
[1:58:01] of God.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what this king did.
[1:58:06] He said, "Oh, more so be also to me if
[1:58:09] the head of Elisha, the son of Chafat,
[1:58:11] shall stand on him this day."
[1:58:14] Imagine the attitude he took towards the
[1:58:16] the the man of God. And if we're not
[1:58:19] careful in a time of trouble, we we
[1:58:21] start to take an attitude towards the
[1:58:23] word of God. But I want to remind you of
[1:58:25] what our text says. It says Elisha said,
[1:58:28] "Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus
[1:58:30] sayith the Lord tomorrow about this
[1:58:32] time." See, he sent a messenger that had
[1:58:34] come to tell or kill Elijah. And when
[1:58:36] and when that messenger from the king
[1:58:38] came, the word of the Lord was spoken.
[1:58:40] And he said, "Hear the word of the Lord.
[1:58:41] Thus sayith the Lord, tomorrow about
[1:58:42] this time shall a measure of fine flour
[1:58:44] be sold for a shekele and two measures
[1:58:46] of barley for a shekel in the gate of
[1:58:47] Samaria." Then a a Lord on whose hand
[1:58:50] the king lean answered the man of God
[1:58:52] and said, "Behold, if the Lord would
[1:58:55] make windows in heaven, might this thing
[1:58:58] be?"
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; He doubted.
[1:59:03] the word of the Lord. Oh, if these
[1:59:05] things would be us going a body change,
[1:59:07] me going a rapture, the rapture be on.
[1:59:11] If God would do this, you see what he's
[1:59:14] saying? He said, "Oh, if the windows
[1:59:16] would be made, if windows were made in
[1:59:18] heaven, how could this thing be?" And
[1:59:20] listen to what he said. Behold, thou
[1:59:21] shalt see it with thine eye, but shall
[1:59:24] not eat thereof. And I want to tell you,
[1:59:27] if we let this spirit of Nick Leighton
[1:59:30] or we let this spirit of losing thy
[1:59:32] first love, you'll have gone to the
[1:59:34] message church, you'll been in the
[1:59:36] message camps. You would heard a
[1:59:38] vindicated prophet. You'll hear about
[1:59:40] the rapture and all of these things that
[1:59:42] have been prophesied. In a moment, in a
[1:59:44] twinkling of an eye, you shall be
[1:59:46] changed. There will be people that will
[1:59:48] actually see it, but won't partake of
[1:59:50] it.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we get latched, if we just
[1:59:57] drift, if we just say, "Well, well,
[1:59:59] well, well, just a little bit this or
[2:00:01] that." Your unbelief can cause you to
[2:00:04] miss it.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hey, I know it's a paradox, but look,
[2:00:07] God, deal with your heart that way.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; So, just bringing this to a close
[2:00:12] quickly. We're talking about a chain of
[2:00:14] events.
[2:00:16] And that's where a lot of our problems
[2:00:17] are is from a series of events or
[2:00:19] decisions that we've made. Maybe you've
[2:00:21] stopped reading your Bible. Maybe you've
[2:00:22] stopped going to to church. Maybe maybe
[2:00:24] you stop listening to the tapes. One
[2:00:26] decision after another. But I just want
[2:00:29] to end on this note. If it can happen in
[2:00:31] the negative,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; what about in the positive?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Because my Bible tells me in 2 Kings
[2:00:40] 7:3, "And there were four lepous men at
[2:00:43] the entering of the gate, and they said
[2:00:45] one to another, why sit we here until we
[2:00:49] die?
[2:00:50] Why am I going to sit here in this
[2:00:53] church any longer and just service after
[2:00:58] service and die?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; I could preach a little bit about the
[2:01:06] valley of dry bones.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Where once there was life, there's no
[2:01:10] more life because it's just a a valley
[2:01:13] of dry bones. And then as the story goes
[2:01:16] on, they're all sitting rank and file
[2:01:18] with a blank stare. What? It's a
[2:01:20] congregation of the dead.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I've been there. I'm preaching.
[2:01:25] I'm preaching. I'm preaching. And some
[2:01:26] people are responding. But there's some
[2:01:28] people that sit in their pew and they're
[2:01:29] just dead with a blank stare on their
[2:01:31] face. They don't know what you're
[2:01:33] talking about. Just just come to church,
[2:01:35] go out of church, go to work, go to
[2:01:37] this, go to that. But I want to tell
[2:01:38] you, there gots to be a resurrection.
[2:01:41] There gots to be something that catches
[2:01:42] you. There got to be something that
[2:01:44] changes you. You ain't got to sit there
[2:01:46] till you die. I say there ought to be a
[2:01:47] revelation like those lepous men who
[2:01:49] were between two straits. It looked bad.
[2:01:52] It looked dark. But they said, "We're
[2:01:53] going to die anyways. Why sent you here
[2:01:56] until we die?"
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; And this is what I want to leave with
[2:02:00] you here.
[2:02:02] This the prophecy had been spoken, but
[2:02:05] little did these lepers know they were a
[2:02:07] link in prophecy.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they went down
[2:02:14] there and God honored that little speck
[2:02:16] of dingy faith and not only delivered
[2:02:18] them, but they delivered Israel.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the power of prophecy.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord about this time.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; They went down to the enemy's camp. And
[2:02:30] God, because he had spoken a word, had
[2:02:32] scattered the enemies. They were all
[2:02:34] gone. And I tell you what, they went
[2:02:35] down to the enemy's camp and they
[2:02:37] started getting marooting around in
[2:02:39] there and they found some gold. They
[2:02:41] found some silver. They found some joy.
[2:02:43] They found some peace and they started
[2:02:44] to heap it up and they started to stash
[2:02:46] it and they started to put it over here.
[2:02:48] They dug this hole. They dug that hole.
[2:02:50] They filled up everything they could
[2:02:51] fill up. And they realized there's so
[2:02:53] much more than I could ever contain.
[2:02:55] They said, "You know what? We don't do
[2:02:57] good. Why don't we share it with the
[2:02:59] house of God? let's go on down to Israel
[2:03:01] and let them know, hey, we came into the
[2:03:03] camp of the enemy. And there's spoils
[2:03:05] for everybody. And everybody was able to
[2:03:07] run into the the the the the camp of the
[2:03:10] army and take as much joy and take as
[2:03:12] much peace and take as much of
[2:03:14] everything that they had need of. And
[2:03:15] the prophet of God said, "We are not
[2:03:17] invited to the enemy's camp this
[2:03:18] morning, but we are invited into the
[2:03:21] father's house." And I want to tell you,
[2:03:22] our father owns a cattle on a thousand
[2:03:24] hills. There's love, there's joy,
[2:03:27] there's peace, there's deliverance,
[2:03:29] there's everything that you have need
[2:03:30] of.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; What about the day and hour that we're
[2:03:40] living in? Just a few more minutes. What
[2:03:44] about the day and hour that we are now
[2:03:45] living, church?
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; You are part of that word and you are a
[2:03:51] link
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; in the chain. of prophecy.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall descend from heaven
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; with a shout.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; It was a triggering event.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; It was a chain reaction. Zechariah 14:7,
[2:04:08] "But it shall be one day which it shall
[2:04:09] be known unto the Lord, not day nor
[2:04:11] night, but it shall come to pass that at
[2:04:13] the evening time it shall be light." The
[2:04:17] prophet said at the evening time events
[2:04:19] are made clear by the prophecy. What is
[2:04:22] taking place in the modern hour can
[2:04:24] easily be identified if you'll just
[2:04:26] believe the prophecy of the hour.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Not just a prophecy of 1960 or 1950, but
[2:04:34] there's a prophetic word for this hour
[2:04:36] that we are now living.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to a close.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine.
[2:04:45] Thy light has come.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. Croak
[2:04:50] darkness upon the land. But the glory of
[2:04:53] the Lord has risen upon you.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Look, a chain of disaster, a chain of
[2:04:58] destruction
[2:05:00] and judgment for the world for Lady
[2:05:03] Osia. But what about the pride?
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; The immune physicians would come. But
[2:05:10] that's not an excuse for for everybody
[2:05:12] to get up and go to the bathroom. So
[2:05:13] just hold on. I want to talk to some of
[2:05:16] you that want to go to the bathroom.
[2:05:19] Luke 17:29.
[2:05:22] But the same day that Lot went out of
[2:05:24] Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from
[2:05:26] heaven and destroyed them all.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Even thus shall it be in the day when
[2:05:31] the Son of Man is revealed. Matthew 25,
[2:05:34] I'm talking about a Lincoln prophecy.
[2:05:35] I'm talking about a prophetic word.
[2:05:36] Matthew 24:27 says, "For as the
[2:05:38] lightning cometh out of the east, and
[2:05:40] shineth even under the west, so shall
[2:05:42] also the coming of the Son of Man be.
[2:05:44] For wheresoever the carcass is, there
[2:05:47] will the eagles be gathered together.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to tell you the capstone is
[2:05:53] here. The mighty angel has descended.
[2:05:56] Revelations 10 1-7. The ancient of days,
[2:06:00] the wicked one, the judge, Christ has
[2:06:02] come down and he's standing present
[2:06:05] amongst us. [screaming] The Lord shall
[2:06:06] descend with a shout. It has triggered
[2:06:09] an event. It's triggered the rapture.
[2:06:12] And you are a link in prophecy. You are
[2:06:15] the link in the rapture.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Behold, I show you a
[2:06:22] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[2:06:25] shall all be changed."
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Look what what what's happening in your
[2:06:33] life, in your family. It might look like
[2:06:35] the odds are stacked against you.
[2:06:39] It might look like there's no way for me
[2:06:41] to fulfill the rapture. I wanted to sing
[2:06:43] that song uh speak to the mountain.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; There's no way I can possess the land.
[2:06:51] There's no way I can go into there's no
[2:06:53] way I can it's too dark.
[2:06:56] My my family situation it's it's
[2:06:59] [screaming] too bad.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I can't even see. I can't even see.
[2:07:03] Brother Matthew, I I I can't even make
[2:07:06] it. I feel like I can't even make it
[2:07:07] another 30 minutes.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't even see this far in
[2:07:11] front of me.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Don't fear, little sister.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; There's a man here who can turn on the
[2:07:18] light.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; And his name is Jesus.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to act out your part
[2:07:28] of the prophecy.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [snorts]
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; You know, you do all the planning and
[2:07:37] everything for for a play and and
[2:07:40] everybody studies and they all prepare
[2:07:42] and they make all the props and and they
[2:07:45] get everything in order and you've
[2:07:47] studied and you've studied over and over
[2:07:49] and to learn your part and and now it
[2:07:51] comes your time
[2:07:53] and now the stage is set and now it's
[2:07:56] your turn to walk in there
[2:07:59] [clears throat]
[2:08:00] and to play your part.
[2:08:03] and you go mind blank
[2:08:06] and everybody's staring at you
[2:08:09] and all the time and all the preparation
[2:08:12] and you feel I I've let everybody down.
[2:08:17] I had one simple phrase,
[2:08:23] behold the lamb of God who takes away
[2:08:25] the sin of the world. And I couldn't
[2:08:27] even get that right. But you know what?
[2:08:30] [snorts]
[2:08:31] The conductor's there. The playwriter's
[2:08:34] there. And he has the scripts and he's
[2:08:36] right there. Said, "It's okay. Go ahead.
[2:08:39] If you forgot your line, let me tell you
[2:08:42] again.
[2:08:44] It's the invisible union of the bride of
[2:08:46] Christ. Oh, that spiritual union of
[2:08:49] Christ in his church. Now when the flesh
[2:08:51] is becoming word and the word is
[2:08:54] becoming flesh manifested
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; vindicated.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; It it it's your time. It's your turn.
[2:09:09] Brother Brandon played his part. Me many
[2:09:12] of those brother Biscll and and they
[2:09:14] they ran their race. They fought a good
[2:09:15] fight. They've crossed over. Now,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; you're the link in prophecy.
[2:09:21] Brother Ber said, "You're part of the
[2:09:22] word cuz he was the word at the
[2:09:24] beginning.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; You're the word now."
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; I say, "Church, why sit? We here till we
[2:09:31] die."
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; We got a part to play.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; We got a rapture to go into.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I am not worried about Lady Osia. I am
[2:09:41] not worried about my job. I am not
[2:09:43] worried about my car. I am not worried
[2:09:45] about my bills. Sorry, bill collectors.
[2:09:47] You're on the spam call. I I'm not
[2:09:50] worried about that. My debt has already
[2:09:52] been paid. All of my sins have already
[2:09:55] been paid for. When Jesus Christ said,
[2:09:58] "It is finished." He washed me in the
[2:10:00] bleach blood, bloody word [screaming] of
[2:10:02] the lamb. And now I am free. I have been
[2:10:05] loosed. Now I can play my part. I don't
[2:10:08] have to worry about generational curses.
[2:10:10] I don't have to worry about my past. I
[2:10:12] don't want to have to worry about the
[2:10:13] things that I've done. But oh, there's
[2:10:15] been a bleeding bloody word that has
[2:10:17] come and said, "It's your turn. It's
[2:10:19] your time. I've washed you. I've
[2:10:21] cleansed you. I've set you apart. I've
[2:10:23] called you for this purpose. You are the
[2:10:25] link in the prophecy. You are the link
[2:10:28] in the rapture. It's time to play your
[2:10:30] part. It's time to cry it [screaming]
[2:10:32] out.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; It's time to speak to your mountain."
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I say it's time to get the
[2:10:38] cry of joy back in the believer's heart.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; I am the bride. [screaming]
[2:10:43] I am going in a rapture. I can do all
[2:10:47] things. I shall do the greater works.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you something. There
[2:10:57] were lepers one time said at the gate.
[2:10:59] They said, "Why do we sit here till we
[2:11:01] die?
[2:11:02] Let's do something about it.
[2:11:07] Make an effort.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Make an effort.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Make an effort.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Get up. [screaming]
[2:11:16] Make an effort. Get up. Make an effort.
[2:11:20] Get up. Make an effort. Get up. Make an
[2:11:24] effort. Get up. Make an effort. Get up.
[2:11:27] Make an effort. Get up. [screaming] Make
[2:11:29] an effort. Are you hearing the prophet?
[2:11:33] Make an effort. Get up. up. [screaming]
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; The doctor's done all they can do.
[2:11:39] Everybody's done all they can do. God's
[2:11:42] done all he can do. And the next thing
[2:11:44] is do is for you to act and let your
[2:11:48] faith go to work in God's word.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the condition,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; regardless of the opposition,
[2:11:57] you shall possess the gate
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; of your enemy.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; I say, rise up from the ashes. Come up
[2:12:05] higher. Move into the stature of a
[2:12:07] perfect man. Move into that perfect
[2:12:09] faith. Be therefore perfect, even as
[2:12:12] your heavenly father is perfect. Let
[2:12:14] this mind be in you that was also in
[2:12:16] Christ Jesus, who thought it not
[2:12:17] robbery, be equal with God.
[2:12:22] Why should I worry when giants come
[2:12:26] calling my name?
[2:12:32] Oh [singing]
[2:12:34] my God is big, bigger than the troubles.
[2:12:40] [music]
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:12:47] [music]
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; for power or riches or fame.
[2:12:59] My [music] God is so
[2:13:05] [music]
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; be shen
[2:13:15] I won't be moved.
[2:13:21] My God is faithful.
[2:13:26] [music]
[2:13:33] Speak to the mountain.
[2:13:39] Oh, it's time to move.
[2:13:45] Cuz my God [music] is bigger, better,
[2:13:50] stronger, and greater than you.
[2:13:57] Well, now my enemies scatter
[2:14:02] cuz they know the battle [music]
[2:14:04] is done.
[2:14:10] Oh, and my God is stronger. Oh, the
[2:14:14] victory is already won.
[2:14:19] [singing]
[2:14:20] [music]
[2:14:22] for he died for my ransom
[2:14:26] and he rose up on the third [music] day.
[2:14:34] Walk [singing]

[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [singing]
[2:14:45] So I won't be shen.
[2:14:52] I won't be moved.
[2:14:58] My God is faithful.
[2:15:03] Oh, his promises. [music]
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:15:15] Oh, it's time to move.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; My God is bigger,
[2:15:25] better,
[2:15:26] strong, [music and singing]
[2:15:28] and gater than you.
[2:15:33] Well, some glad morning. Well, when this
[2:15:37] life is over, well, I
[2:15:41] going to fly away. [singing]
[2:15:44] Well, now to a home on consolial shores.
[2:15:50] Well, I
[2:15:53] will fly. Oh, in the morning. Well, I
[2:15:58] will fly away. Oh glory

[2:16:34] shall never end. Hallelujah.

[2:18:20] Will I
[2:18:22] fly away? [music]
[2:18:25] Well, I won't die. Hallelujah.
[2:18:31] [music]
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know what else to say but
[2:18:43] hallelujah.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm going in
[2:18:46] a rapture.
[2:18:49] The mighty angel has already descended.
[2:18:52] The triggering events, the chain of
[2:18:54] reaction has already started.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Look, when the book was opened,
[2:18:59] he called my name.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; I heard from my theophony.
[2:19:05] I
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; I saw something soaring in the heavens.
[2:19:08] I said, "Mama, how do I get up there?
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Just jump.
[2:19:14] Just start. Amen.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Just get up. [screaming]
[2:19:18] I don't know how.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Just flap your wings.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Just try.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody going to try.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Just start flapping your wings.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; I am the bride.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, you you made a mistake. Try again.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going in a rapture.
[2:19:45] I can speak to the mountain.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; I'm in an invisible union with Christ
[2:19:50] the word. [screaming]
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; If you fall down,
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; get back up.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "If you can just
[2:19:58] get started,
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; he said it's your it's your attitude,
[2:20:01] your approach."
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you can have the right
[2:20:04] attitude and the right approach," he
[2:20:05] said, "If you can just get started,
[2:20:08] God will do the rest."
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I'm already started.
[2:20:14] I'm thinking of a rapture.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; I've already started. You know what that
[2:20:19] means? He's going to do the rest.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Gary, God is going to transform my body.
[2:20:25] [music]
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm thinking
[2:20:28] of a rapture.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I am thinking of a rapture in our
[2:20:35] blessed home. Oh, and the redeemed
[2:20:40] are gathering.
[2:20:42] Oh, and how we'll raise the heavenly
[2:20:45] anthem in the [music] city in the sky.
[2:20:48] Oh, when the redeemed
[2:20:51] are gathering in. Oh, hallelujah. When
[2:20:54] the redeemed
[2:20:56] [music]
[2:20:56] are gathering in,
[2:20:59] oh, wash like snow
[2:21:02] and free from all [music and singing]
[2:21:03] sin.
[2:21:05] And I will shout
[2:21:07] and I will sing [music] praise the Lord
[2:21:10] where every day
[2:21:13] are gathering.
[2:21:16] Oh, and there will be a great possession
[2:21:19] over on the streets of gold where three
[2:21:22] days
[2:21:24] are gathering.
[2:21:27] [music]
[2:21:29] Oh, singing for the city will be rolled.
[2:21:33] When we
[2:21:35] are gathering in, oh hallelujah. When we
[2:21:40] [music]
[2:21:41] are gathering in,
[2:21:44] oh wash like snow, [singing]
[2:21:46] every flow [music] sin.
[2:21:49] Well, I will shout
[2:21:52] and I will sing. Praise the Lord. And
[2:21:55] the redeemed [music]
[2:21:58] are gathering in.
[2:22:01] Saints will sing redemption story with
[2:22:04] their voices clear and strong. When the
[2:22:06] redeemed
[2:22:09] are gathering in
[2:22:12] the angels I will listen for they
[2:22:15] [music] cannot.
[2:22:17] Oh with.
[2:22:21] Oh hallelujah. Every day
[2:22:25] I gather in.
[2:22:28] Oh, wash like snow [music]
[2:22:31] and free from all [singing] sin.
[2:22:34] Well, I will shout
[2:22:36] and I will sing praise the Lord when
[2:22:44] [music]
[2:22:46] Hallelujah. Brother David, if you can
[2:22:48] come dismiss us in prayer.
[2:22:51] I don't know about you, but I'm not just
[2:22:53] thinking about a rapture.
[2:22:56] I'm living in rapture.
[2:22:59] Say, "Brother Matthew, what are you
[2:23:02] talking about?" Well,
[2:23:06] I've heard from my theophony,
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; and something has already been
[2:23:10] triggered. There's a chain of events
[2:23:11] that's already started in my soul,
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; and I'm already seated in heavenly
[2:23:16] places in Christ Jesus. And because he's
[2:23:19] given me an ear to hear, the word which
[2:23:22] I am hearing is becoming flesh in me.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; The word is becoming flesh and the flesh
[2:23:33] is becoming word.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; I say, aren't you thankful for that? God
[2:23:37] bless you.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; You know, I was just reading Matthew 22
[2:23:46] this morning. And there was a a an
[2:23:48] invitation that was sent out to come to
[2:23:52] a wedding supper.
[2:23:54] And there was many who had many excuses
[2:23:57] why they wouldn't come. But if they
[2:23:58] would have recognized the opportunity
[2:24:00] and what was set before them that day,
[2:24:03] they wouldn't have sat there and died,
[2:24:04] but they would have heeded the
[2:24:06] invitation.
[2:24:07] What a beautiful message we've heard
[2:24:09] this morning.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; It is a come and dying call. It's it's
[2:24:13] it is a chain of events.
[2:24:16] see your name written in that book of
[2:24:18] prophecy.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Recognize your day and the opportunity
[2:24:21] and say, "That's for me.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take that for me.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to want transformation in my
[2:24:28] life."
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Heavenly
[2:24:32] Father, thank you for a a message that
[2:24:34] would come and speak grace and liberty
[2:24:36] to your children. Lord, where we fallen,
[2:24:39] Father, your word and grace much more
[2:24:41] did abound. Lord, where the enemy would
[2:24:44] have come and tried to sow doubt and
[2:24:46] discouragement and failure, Father, a
[2:24:48] more sure word of prophecy has been
[2:24:50] spoken over us this morning, Lord,
[2:24:52] calling us your own, calling us bride,
[2:24:55] telling us where we're going, our
[2:24:57] destination, and all the things that are
[2:24:58] ours, Father. Lord, may we recognize
[2:25:01] your voice to us, Lord. Your love call
[2:25:03] to us, Lord, that you're my bride and
[2:25:06] your bone of my bone, your flesh of my
[2:25:08] flesh, Lord. And Lord, I'm going to rise
[2:25:10] and say, I'm not looking at the failure,
[2:25:12] Father. I'm not looking at the voice of
[2:25:13] the enemy. I'm not looking at this very
[2:25:15] flesh, Father, but I'm looking at the
[2:25:17] things you've spoken of me, Lord. I'm an
[2:25:19] overcomer, Lord. I'm victorious. I'm not
[2:25:22] going to sit in in lukewarmness. I'm not
[2:25:25] going to sit, Father, in complacency.
[2:25:27] I'm not going to sit and look at the
[2:25:28] failures of the past, Father. I'm not
[2:25:30] going to even look at the things I might
[2:25:32] have done this this very morning that
[2:25:34] testify differently than what your word
[2:25:36] speaks of me, Father, but I'm going to
[2:25:38] reflect you, Father, in the fullness of
[2:25:40] your word. I'm going to be your bride
[2:25:41] made manifest. I'm going to be your
[2:25:43] image, Lord. I'm going to be a voice of
[2:25:45] salvation to a dying world, Lord. I'm
[2:25:47] going to rise, oh God, and I'm going to
[2:25:49] give you the glory because you said,
[2:25:51] "Arise and shine, for thy light has
[2:25:53] come." Lord, I've seen your light and I
[2:25:55] must reflect it, Lord. I've got to
[2:25:57] declare you, Father. Lord, for you
[2:26:00] predestined me to me to do that. Lord,
[2:26:02] we want to thank you, Father, for this
[2:26:04] word. We ask that you be with brother
[2:26:06] Matthew that you would strengthen them,
[2:26:07] Lord. The labor of faith, Lord, to
[2:26:09] speak, Father, your word of life to your
[2:26:12] people, Lord. We're going to speak it.
[2:26:14] Though there would be no evidence that
[2:26:16] may testify to it, we're going to
[2:26:18] recognize on the absoluteness of your
[2:26:19] word that you've spoken it and it must
[2:26:22] come to pass. So, we're going to praise
[2:26:24] you, Father. We're going to praise you
[2:26:26] before there's maybe not even one speck
[2:26:28] of life showing. We know we've heard
[2:26:30] from the lifegiver, Father,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, and we're going to glorify you,
[2:26:34] Father. So now, as we go, be with each
[2:26:36] one. May your Holy Spirit just brood out
[2:26:37] after us, Father. Bring our pastor home
[2:26:40] safe to us. We commit it all to you in
[2:26:41] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; You are worthy [singing] of it all.
[2:26:50] Amen. You are dismissed.
[2:26:53] Oh, [singing] you are worthy of it all.
