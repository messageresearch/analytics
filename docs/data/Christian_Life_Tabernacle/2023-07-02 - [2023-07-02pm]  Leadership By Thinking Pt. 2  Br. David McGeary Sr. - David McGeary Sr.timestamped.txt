[27:00] this communion service tonight we thank
[27:03] you in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[27:07] let's read our scriptures again that we
[27:09] read this morning
[27:11] found there in the book of Ephesians
[27:24] and I just want to read this little
[27:27] scripture
[27:28] once again that it says
[27:34] in the 21st and 26th and 27th verse the
[27:38] fifth chapter of Ephesians
[27:40] says husband loves your wives even if
[27:43] Christ also loved the church and gave
[27:46] himself for it that he might sanctify it
[27:49] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[27:53] by the word that he might present it to
[27:57] himself a glorious church not having
[28:00] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[28:04] that it should be holy and without
[28:06] blemish father we ask you to bless your
[28:09] word to us in your precious name we pray
[28:12] amen God bless you may be seated tonight
[28:16] it certainly wonderful to see that a few
[28:21] people have a filter
[28:23] and so we certainly ask all those that
[28:26] didn't come back to the house of the
[28:29] Lord
[28:30] what thinking
[28:34] kept them out
[28:36] and and that's what we're talking about
[28:39] and when we talk about you having to
[28:42] having to address
[28:45] the thought process and at that and
[28:49] um
[28:50] a lot of times I don't think people even
[28:52] realize the thought process is taking
[28:55] place they don't it it it's so uh
[29:00] in our subconscious that it just happens
[29:05] with uh without an awareness and so can
[29:09] you imagine if your subconscious is is
[29:12] directing you and you're not even aware
[29:16] of it then how important would it be to
[29:19] get control of that to grasp and
[29:23] understand that there's something that's
[29:27] taking place in Me by Nature
[29:31] that the way that I'm built that I'm
[29:36] thinking these thoughts and and not ever
[29:39] uh really realizing if if you've ever
[29:43] had a problem with temper
[29:45] or anger or frustration uh anybody
[29:50] that's ever had I'm sure none of you
[29:52] have
[29:52] but you know
[29:55] I have had it I have a God's helping me
[29:59] but real bad you know and uh yeah it's a
[30:04] build up you know what I mean your mind
[30:07] gets to racing and you're You're
[30:10] Building all this frustration up and all
[30:12] these thoughts are feeling uh uh
[30:16] something that's that's
[30:19] transpiring in you and all of a sudden
[30:21] you have all these feelings and all
[30:23] these emotions they've risen to the
[30:25] surface and you're you're you're you're
[30:28] just gonna be blowing off steam you know
[30:32] what I mean and then you'll say
[30:33] something or do something and and you
[30:36] you don't even realize how did I get to
[30:38] this place
[30:40] you know how did I get here well you
[30:43] know it's it it's that that subconscious
[30:46] thoughts you know uh when my brother was
[30:51] uh my older brother when he
[30:55] finally
[30:57] in his life he was an alcoholic
[31:00] and and with alcoholics they they'd say
[31:04] that you'll you'll never start to change
[31:08] till you finally hit a a rock bottom
[31:13] place
[31:14] where you realize you can't go on other
[31:18] than that you'll always make an excuse
[31:20] you'll always have a reason you'll
[31:24] always think of of something uh to do
[31:29] and and I used to go to meetings with
[31:31] them to the AAA meetings with them and
[31:34] and you know I'm not against a a it's
[31:37] it's not a substitute for the Lord
[31:40] and and I I believe that's the greatest
[31:43] cure for alcoholism there is is is being
[31:47] born again but if it it's a whole
[31:51] process of them trying to learn to
[31:54] control the way they think because
[31:57] they're always looking for a reason to
[32:00] drink
[32:01] you know and so they develop methods of
[32:05] thinking
[32:07] that allow them to justify
[32:11] what they're doing regardless of the
[32:15] harm that it's causing them
[32:18] and we do that a lot with sin
[32:23] you know most sin is Justified because
[32:27] of the result that it provides us you
[32:33] know that's uh you know laziness is a
[32:37] sin
[32:38] you know the scripture says to do those
[32:42] then to know to do good and not to do it
[32:45] to them it is sin so there had to be a
[32:50] process by which that they reasoned and
[32:54] they thought and they they drew a
[32:58] conclusion that this is okay
[33:02] this is okay and like I said uh they
[33:06] people
[33:07] one of the things that
[33:11] they would talk about is that how that
[33:14] you can't let other people when other
[33:18] people disappoint you or let you down or
[33:22] discourage you that you can't use other
[33:25] people's failures as your excuse
[33:29] you know and so I thought that was
[33:32] pretty amazing because it brings us back
[33:36] to the fact that we have got to eat our
[33:40] bread with singleness of heart working
[33:44] out our own salvation with fear and
[33:47] trembling in other words if everybody's
[33:50] go walking off the cliff that doesn't
[33:53] mean that walking off the cliff is good
[33:56] and it doesn't mean the results of
[33:59] walking off a cliff are going to change
[34:02] because more people do it
[34:05] you know and and you know when we've
[34:09] always been in the church trying to
[34:12] fight the Modern Trend that was one of
[34:15] the things that was a great theme of the
[34:18] message of the hour that the prophet of
[34:21] God taught us he said you want to watch
[34:23] this modernism modern day religion
[34:26] modern Trends modern music modern
[34:29] approach to sin a new ethics code a new
[34:33] moral code and you know I I I sit here
[34:37] tonight and uh you know uh
[34:42] a man told me one time I said well why
[34:44] don't you guys have uh evening service
[34:48] but he said not very many people can get
[34:52] back to evening service
[34:55] and so you filter that
[34:59] okay but that's not what the word of God
[35:02] did the word of God says where if one or
[35:04] two
[35:05] can gather together
[35:07] he would be there
[35:09] so if only three of us wanted to be here
[35:12] then would it be worth having service
[35:16] you know now we could reason we got to
[35:18] run the bills we've got to run the air
[35:21] conditioner you know it it okay you
[35:24] don't have the seats aren't full the Imp
[35:27] the atmosphere feels you know kind of
[35:30] skimpy and it feels like it'd be better
[35:33] if it was more packed out I like that
[35:36] feeling better you know when there's
[35:38] just a few of us there and he preaches
[35:40] three kinds of Believers I know that I'm
[35:44] I you know I know I'm gonna I'm one of
[35:47] them you know what I mean and you can
[35:50] you can come up with a mass
[35:53] of of of
[35:55] ideas floating through your head and one
[35:59] of the things I really wanted to just
[36:01] talk a little bit about because even is
[36:03] that that you can't stop that from
[36:06] happening
[36:08] and I touched on it this morning that's
[36:11] the battle
[36:12] he's always pushing the reasoning in
[36:16] there he doesn't stop
[36:19] it's non-stop mind game
[36:24] mind battle it's non-stop it's non-stop
[36:28] he just never quits you know because
[36:30] okay have you ever woke up and oh I used
[36:34] to go through it every morning to go to
[36:36] work
[36:38] I used to filter every excuse that I
[36:42] could come up with not to get out of bed
[36:45] you know and and you just go through it
[36:48] you go through the mind that it might be
[36:51] for you guys you just love to pop up and
[36:52] go to work you know but I'll tell you I
[36:55] don't even the covers only feel good to
[36:58] me about you know seven o'clock in the
[37:01] morning
[37:02] and you know and that's when you get
[37:05] most of your sleep that's when you dream
[37:08] most of your dreams it is right at that
[37:12] time and you want to cling to that but
[37:14] something's got to push you
[37:16] to get out and then you go through the
[37:19] thought process but I I wish I had the
[37:22] ability to make you aware of the thought
[37:26] process and I think this is part of what
[37:29] the messengers trying to get to the
[37:31] church and was trying to get to the
[37:34] church is that this thoughts process is
[37:36] going on in these influences are coming
[37:39] to them and they've got to understand in
[37:42] order to climb into that Capstone they
[37:45] they're going to have to deal with it
[37:48] you just got to deal with it you're not
[37:51] free from dealing with it and and if if
[37:55] not you you'll end up creating your own
[37:59] uh your your whole own ideology
[38:04] you know and uh
[38:08] you know I I I just found out here the
[38:12] other day as many of you've known I
[38:15] didn't know if I shared this with the
[38:16] church or not but I will at this time
[38:19] while I was in California
[38:21] uh
[38:23] a
[38:24] a woman
[38:28] I guess a homeless person or a
[38:31] maybe she was homeless by choice she may
[38:35] have had a good family that uh
[38:38] uh may have got tired of the way that
[38:40] she was living but she decided to uh
[38:46] she was by a parked car and she decided
[38:50] to get down and crawl out in the road
[38:52] and lay down
[38:54] in the middle of the road right in front
[38:56] of my car and I ran over
[38:58] and uh and you know it was very
[39:02] traumatic experience for my family my
[39:05] granddaughter my mom and everything and
[39:09] it was pretty obvious to us that she was
[39:13] probably trying to commit to suicide
[39:17] and um and you know I mean I had things
[39:21] that I was supposed to do but it kind of
[39:23] rattled me because I wanted to have the
[39:25] right attitude towards it and the right
[39:27] thinking and and all those things and
[39:30] and have compassion for her and and
[39:34] everything well I just found out the
[39:36] other day that she's suing me
[39:40] and I just thought well
[39:42] what is she suing me for
[39:45] I mean I didn't complete the job that
[39:48] she wanted me to complete or or what you
[39:52] know what I mean but okay there's
[39:54] nothing in the world I could have done
[39:57] you understand if someone wants to lay
[39:59] down out in front of your car when
[40:01] you're driving by there's nothing you
[40:03] can do the street was dark you know it
[40:06] was a no situation was
[40:10] available to me
[40:13] to do anything other than what I've done
[40:16] but you've got an attorney now and
[40:19] they're going to sue and they're going
[40:21] to try to collect and you begin to sit
[40:23] back that you realize that the the
[40:26] society has developed a whole complete
[40:30] different way of thinking and the
[40:34] scripture says that if you no longer
[40:36] wish to retain God in your knowledge
[40:40] he gives you over to a reprobate mind
[40:44] and if you could ever get that across
[40:46] the young people and young teenagers
[40:49] when you start taking God out of your
[40:52] thinking that what there's there's only
[40:55] one other type of thinking that's
[40:58] available and that thinking is
[41:00] reprobated
[41:03] it's perverted
[41:05] because that's what sin is and that's
[41:08] what truth is Right a lie is it's truth
[41:12] perverted so you're going to get some
[41:14] form of perversion
[41:16] and when you build upon perversion
[41:19] perversion uh
[41:22] brings forth more perversion if it
[41:25] produces it it just keeps going and and
[41:29] it goes It goes uh it goes so far uh it
[41:34] gets so far out there the thinking does
[41:37] that it's it's lost all kinds of forms
[41:40] of Truth and then so you you've got to
[41:44] understand that there's a tide today
[41:46] there's a whole a whole thing a person
[41:50] they can they get themselves into a spot
[41:53] where they they think a certain thing
[41:56] about themselves or they they think a
[42:00] certain interpretation of the scriptures
[42:02] and and they they don't run it from
[42:05] Genesis to to Revelations they don't
[42:08] take all of it they just take a few
[42:11] parts of it and and they don't filter it
[42:14] then they're gonna build something on
[42:16] that and it's going to build into
[42:18] something
[42:21] and it's difficult
[42:24] it's difficult well he's not looking for
[42:28] he wants a bride that doesn't have any
[42:31] wrinkles
[42:33] or and he's not trying to tell us to get
[42:36] out ponds or you know Neutrogena that's
[42:40] not the kind of wrinkles he's worried
[42:41] about he'd rather see those kind of
[42:44] wrinkles
[42:45] you know wrinkles of experience wrinkles
[42:48] of prayer but it's it's these little
[42:51] bends these little
[42:54] tweaks in the word of God this little
[42:56] mixing with humanism that that he's
[42:59] trying to to to get out of the church
[43:02] and so now he's gathered a group of
[43:05] people together and he's going to supply
[43:09] them a filter
[43:12] now we know what a filter does how many
[43:15] halves of water filters
[43:17] a lot of your refrigerators come with
[43:19] water filters you can buy counter
[43:22] filters water filters water softeners
[43:25] water fills it's to change the taste of
[43:27] the water
[43:29] and how do they does a filter work it
[43:32] allows certain things through and
[43:35] certain things it keeps out so you by
[43:39] the by changing the filter
[43:43] you can change the outcome of what comes
[43:48] out on the other side
[43:50] that we we had a brother that uh
[43:55] uh in fact it's it's uh brother Mike
[43:58] Park's brother-in-law he worked for a
[44:00] gravel company and they could a company
[44:04] that made filters filter screens and by
[44:09] designing these screens they could crush
[44:12] Rock and and separate it into all kinds
[44:16] of different sizes and weights and
[44:19] everything just by how that it
[44:21] transferred through the filter so what's
[44:25] in important about the filter is the
[44:28] filter allows what comes through
[44:33] so you can't get the product
[44:37] until it goes through the filter
[44:41] if you understand I'm saying so the
[44:44] product is
[44:45] a a bride without spot or wrinkle that's
[44:50] the Prada but the only way that you can
[44:53] get the wrinkle out is to put it through
[44:56] the filter the only way you can get the
[44:59] blemish out is to put it to the filter
[45:01] you can't sit back and say oh I I
[45:05] believe I shouldn't have any blemishes
[45:09] that that's that's sitting back and
[45:14] looking with the pair of binoculars
[45:16] instead of looking at the mirror so the
[45:19] filter was given
[45:22] because everything has to go through it
[45:26] because everybody was dirty
[45:31] so you can't avoid going through the
[45:34] filter you've got to look at yourself
[45:37] and you've got to understand and you've
[45:40] got to look at the word of God and
[45:42] you've got to look at yourself and say
[45:45] in order to come up with the product
[45:48] that God wants or in order for me to get
[45:53] the the rapture
[45:58] which is the ultimate yes I don't want
[46:01] to be saved by fire
[46:03] in order to get the outcome
[46:07] I have got to go through this filter
[46:10] no I can't sit there and say that's
[46:13] god's filter that's God's word
[46:16] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[46:19] Hallelujah I'm so glad glory to God that
[46:23] I've got the filter Hallelujah and that
[46:26] the spirit of God moves on me praise a
[46:28] God and one day we're going to walk in
[46:31] the mighty faith of the revelation of
[46:33] the word of God do you hear me charge
[46:35] are you ready to march in the name of
[46:38] Jesus and overcome Satan Hallelujah do
[46:42] you feel it brother
[46:48] oh I found out a long time ago that
[46:50] ain't preaching
[46:52] if I believe that would preach and not
[46:54] have me an organ player that know how to
[46:55] make this place Rock
[47:00] that ain't it
[47:03] has never been it
[47:07] it's when you
[47:10] have to take what you believe
[47:13] what you've been taught What You've Been
[47:15] Told
[47:17] and you as an individual
[47:19] say I've got to take me through that
[47:22] filter
[47:24] to me
[47:26] because if I don't go through it
[47:30] there's no way I can be cleansed
[47:34] let me just read a few statements
[47:36] today and
[47:41] he said
[47:43] and if I've got one desire in my heart
[47:48] and I hope that everybody listening to
[47:51] me has the same thing
[47:54] God take me through your filter
[48:04] as David said try me and prove me
[48:09] and seek if there be any evil in me
[48:14] then take it out Lord
[48:17] see I want God's filter I don't care
[48:21] what the world does
[48:23] what the church has
[48:28] now that's a great statement
[48:30] I don't care what the church has
[48:34] I don't care whether it has a gymnasium
[48:38] I don't care whether it's got the best
[48:40] music
[48:41] I don't care whether it's got the most
[48:43] intellectual intelligent uh Ministry I
[48:48] don't care what the church has
[48:50] because it takes pressing it down to the
[48:56] election
[48:58] it's going to press it down to what's
[49:01] inside of you
[49:05] you know and and
[49:10] if you're different that difference is
[49:14] going to be pressed
[49:17] to the surface
[49:20] we used to do this little thing in in we
[49:24] would take a
[49:25] a
[49:26] few Marbles and we'd put them in a
[49:30] bottom of a a big jar and I don't know
[49:34] if we put like wheat or corn or
[49:37] something in the jar and we would say
[49:39] you notice these marbles are different
[49:41] and and you know this was motivational
[49:44] training and uh I've seen motivational
[49:48] training
[49:50] I used to teach it
[49:52] I had
[49:54] I had four or five people who were in
[49:57] the Baseball Hall of Fame
[50:01] making millions of dollars
[50:04] a year
[50:05] standing on a chair
[50:10] in a room of people screaming at the top
[50:14] of their lungs get rich get rich
[50:21] because they were stirred up
[50:24] they were motivated
[50:26] and I thought I'm sitting there hardly
[50:30] making a nickel these guys are
[50:32] multi-millionaires and I thought what
[50:34] are these guys they don't want to get
[50:36] rich what are what are they doing they
[50:38] love the hype
[50:42] they just feed on the motivation they're
[50:45] they're competitors they like the
[50:48] motivation they they they they love that
[50:51] feeling that that stuff you know and it
[50:54] can you know here's a guy that's known
[50:56] for one of the greatest curveballs ever
[50:59] thrown in baseball going good Rich get
[51:02] rich
[51:03] I'm thinking give me the curveball give
[51:06] me the curveball
[51:08] you know it so it dawned on me so these
[51:12] the it's the psychic it's the motivation
[51:14] it's the emotion it's the the being
[51:18] drummed up in everything
[51:20] but that so he doesn't care what it has
[51:27] never never thought it out
[51:32] they're not gonna go door to door and
[51:34] and and
[51:35] sell uh
[51:38] engine oil or or you know soap
[51:44] they would never do that but boy the
[51:47] hype
[51:48] they they fed on it so now he's pointing
[51:51] something out there he says I don't care
[51:52] what the church has
[51:55] I want
[51:56] to be a thinking man
[52:05] now
[52:07] ask yourself
[52:08] am I a thinking person
[52:13] and I realize I do a lot of things
[52:16] without thinking
[52:19] and have you ever heard the expression
[52:21] what were you thinking
[52:23] what in the world were you thinking
[52:26] what made you think
[52:29] you could do this
[52:31] you know maybe your parents have told
[52:33] that to you what makes you think you're
[52:36] not going to get caught what makes you
[52:38] think what what brought that on what
[52:41] what were you thinking
[52:43] and so he's saying here I want to be a a
[52:47] I want to be a thinking man
[52:50] to think who I'm going to be standing by
[52:55] one of these days for judgment
[53:01] so what we've got to understand that so
[53:06] it's like the word of the Lord is coming
[53:08] says okay Church
[53:10] you've matured enough you know the
[53:12] doctrine now it's time for you to become
[53:15] thinking people
[53:17] you can't go no longer
[53:19] just taking things
[53:21] as they happen or as they come
[53:25] you've got to take control a real Son of
[53:29] God takes control of every circumstance
[53:32] he walks in a world a Mystic to himself
[53:37] he takes control of every circumstance
[53:40] so it's no more whatever comes comes
[53:43] whatever goes goes I'll just deal with
[53:46] it I can just I don't like somebody I
[53:49] just don't like them I just think that
[53:51] way if if I want to cut somebody off or
[53:54] find her I don't want to listen to
[53:55] somebody I just shut them out all that
[53:59] stuff is is bye bye now
[54:02] okay you're you're no longer free
[54:06] thinkers
[54:10] you no longer have the right to think
[54:14] what you want
[54:17] you are now
[54:19] called to become prisoners
[54:22] and to to take the filter
[54:27] and the responsibility of the filter and
[54:32] we know this he said oh yes
[54:34] the word of God is a thinking man's
[54:37] filter
[54:38] anyone knows that that's what your soul
[54:42] is filtered through
[54:44] the word of God and it and it makes when
[54:49] you come through
[54:50] God when a thinking man comes through
[54:54] God's filter it gives him a holy man's
[54:58] taste that's right when you come through
[55:01] God's filter then your tasty is a holy
[55:05] man's taste it makes a righteous man's
[55:08] taste the slogan was certainly right and
[55:12] we know the slogan came when brother
[55:14] Brennan picked up that cigarette pack it
[55:17] it I think it said it said a thinking
[55:20] man's filter a smoking man's taste
[55:25] and he thought what a deception
[55:28] they can't filter out the cancer
[55:32] but they're trying to deceive the a
[55:35] person and just to throw it out to you
[55:39] is that they've just finally released a
[55:42] study that they've had for years and
[55:44] years and years about the negative
[55:47] effect of it's I want to say aspirin but
[55:51] it's it's it's that sweetener
[55:56] ask for Keen
[55:58] or whatever it's one of the most deadly
[56:01] things
[56:02] to sense corn syrup
[56:06] you all eat a lot of corns forever
[56:10] and we drink diet drinks
[56:12] and they they absolutely now realize
[56:16] that it's has a terrible effect on on
[56:19] development
[56:20] well who in the who's been telling us
[56:22] for a long time about hybrid fur Foods
[56:26] turning everybody into mush
[56:31] good you know what I mean I mean it's
[56:34] just it's just that real
[56:36] but so we he said we know that and it
[56:40] produces that Holy man's taste so when
[56:43] he saw that package at a thinking man's
[56:45] filter a holy man's taste and then the
[56:47] Lord started dealing with them that the
[56:49] church is not filtering and so this is
[56:51] what he says he says this is paragraph
[56:54] 87 notice
[56:56] but the woman who wants to have short
[56:59] hair
[57:00] and wear shorts
[57:03] or wear paint and things
[57:07] she can go right through
[57:10] Pentecostal filter just as easy as pie
[57:16] nothing about it right into death
[57:20] because she says well there's no harm in
[57:24] that if you love the world or the things
[57:27] of the world it's because the love of
[57:30] God is not even in you
[57:32] she said down through this Spirit now
[57:35] you've got to realize that that's
[57:38] that's her nature
[57:40] right so let me read this this quote
[57:43] first he says he says this is 74.
[57:48] notice now
[57:50] women they want to have bobbed hair
[57:54] okay and I would think that's natural
[57:58] because long hair is a lot of work it's
[58:00] hot you know your hair grows long so the
[58:04] easiest thing to do is just cut it off
[58:07] that's why a lot of older women they get
[58:10] to the place they don't want to worry
[58:12] about going to the having their hair
[58:13] done they're just a big truck so they
[58:15] just chop it off
[58:18] what difference does it make
[58:21] right God loves me
[58:26] it's kind of
[58:27] they want it
[58:29] she said and they want to have bobbed
[58:32] hair
[58:32] they want to wear shorts
[58:35] paint makeup
[58:36] right oh there's a little spot
[58:40] you know and then the pretty soon they
[58:42] got Foundation
[58:44] and then the foundation they got toned
[58:47] and after tone they got some Scara and
[58:52] then they put some
[58:53] lip stuff on you know what I mean and
[58:57] pretty soon you you say who's this
[59:02] you know you wonder what what you know
[59:05] you wonder if they ever peeled off that
[59:07] onion what they'd really look like
[59:10] you know I I I tell any man this is just
[59:14] straightforward Miracle advice before
[59:17] you marry a woman you see her fresh with
[59:20] her face fresh washed because what she's
[59:23] presenting you may not be real
[59:27] good I just thought I'd throw that in
[59:28] there for just a little bit of spiritual
[59:31] uh advice here this today you know what
[59:35] I mean because you know deception is an
[59:38] amazing thing
[59:40] it's like one of those paintings you
[59:42] know that's got the hidden picture
[59:45] you know if you don't look real close
[59:47] you might not get the real picture so
[59:50] you want to make sure you see what's
[59:52] really under there
[59:54] and so she wants Bob air they want to
[59:57] wear shorts
[59:58] paint makeup these little bikinis and
[1:00:02] things that they wear nowadays they want
[1:00:05] to do it and yet they want to go to
[1:00:08] church
[1:00:09] you see that anointing upon the spirit
[1:00:13] upon the soul
[1:00:17] that's that anointing is on them they
[1:00:20] want to go to church
[1:00:22] she she wants to be a Christian
[1:00:25] and also do those things
[1:00:29] and the pastor says it's okay
[1:00:33] then if he says it's okay
[1:00:36] you can be a member
[1:00:38] your name can be on my church book here
[1:00:42] it's okay then he's giving her his
[1:00:46] denominational filter to suit a worldly
[1:00:50] woman's taste
[1:00:54] so you can find a filter to match your
[1:00:57] taste
[1:00:59] okay so she loves the world she likes
[1:01:03] the taste of it
[1:01:05] so he's got a filter for her
[1:01:08] but she's a long way from being a
[1:01:13] thinking woman
[1:01:15] but there you are that's where I found
[1:01:19] this text
[1:01:20] no she isn't a thinking woman
[1:01:25] if she was a thinking
[1:01:27] she would know the church isn't going to
[1:01:31] judge her at the last day
[1:01:36] the church is judging her now
[1:01:39] by her membership
[1:01:42] her loyalty to the circles that she
[1:01:46] belongs to and to society
[1:01:49] they are judging her now by that
[1:01:55] that's scary
[1:01:58] I don't know if it's you but that's
[1:02:00] scary
[1:02:02] but if she was thinking but God is going
[1:02:04] to judge her at the last day so she
[1:02:08] isn't thinking he's going to judge her
[1:02:10] by her word
[1:02:12] but she thinks she's okay because her
[1:02:15] church is judging her now we're a member
[1:02:19] of this group we are loyal uh we're part
[1:02:23] of the programs we we we do all these uh
[1:02:27] things and so you're all being judged
[1:02:30] now but you're being judged by the
[1:02:32] people that don't matter
[1:02:37] I mean that's it's absolutely phenomenal
[1:02:40] really what he's bringing forth here out
[1:02:44] of the word of God he's saying he just
[1:02:46] comes right out and says that you're
[1:02:49] being judged now and according to them
[1:02:52] you're all okay but you're not thinking
[1:02:55] that's not the filter you've got to go
[1:02:58] through to get there the filter you've
[1:03:00] got to go through is that little gap
[1:03:02] between the Capstone because that
[1:03:06] Capstone is the tip of the rocket that's
[1:03:09] the pod that's what's going off that's
[1:03:12] the capsule
[1:03:16] that's the spaceship
[1:03:21] that's going out of here
[1:03:23] and that spirit that sits there is the
[1:03:26] word of God the filter that's only going
[1:03:30] to allow those who go through that
[1:03:32] filter into that pod into that Capsule
[1:03:35] that's going to launch in the rapture
[1:03:40] reality
[1:03:44] what it is
[1:03:45] you can't change it she's not a thinking
[1:03:48] she isn't thinking
[1:03:52] and then he says he's talking again he
[1:03:55] says notice but the woman who wants to
[1:03:57] have short hair and wear shorts and wear
[1:04:00] paint or anything she can go right
[1:04:03] through a Pentecostal filter just
[1:04:06] exactly as easy as pie nothing about it
[1:04:11] right into death
[1:04:12] because she says well there's no harm to
[1:04:16] that if you love the world or the things
[1:04:18] of the world it's because the love of
[1:04:20] God is not even in you now down through
[1:04:24] this Spirit then she can pull down into
[1:04:28] her soul things that isn't of God and
[1:04:32] against God's word
[1:04:35] if that's the taste in her soul
[1:04:41] so if the taste in your soul
[1:04:44] is for things of the world
[1:04:47] then you can pull things into your soul
[1:04:51] that isn't even of God you that through
[1:04:54] that spirit
[1:04:56] that anointing
[1:04:59] remember she wants to be a
[1:05:01] serve God
[1:05:04] that's an anointing and through that
[1:05:06] annoying and through that desire and
[1:05:09] through that idea of wanting to be good
[1:05:12] and wanting to serve God she can pull
[1:05:14] things down into her soul
[1:05:18] that is contrary to the word of God
[1:05:26] and feel religious
[1:05:29] now what a stark warning
[1:05:32] from the church age messenger and the
[1:05:35] prophet of this age to keep us from the
[1:05:39] greatest deception that there ever was
[1:05:44] is Satan appearing as an angel of Light
[1:05:48] that it would be so close in the last
[1:05:51] days it would deceive the very elect if
[1:05:55] possible
[1:05:56] it can actually pull things into their
[1:05:59] Spirit by the anointing
[1:06:03] that's contrary to the word
[1:06:08] yeah
[1:06:10] you've got to filter the anointing
[1:06:17] you do
[1:06:19] because there's only one thing that God
[1:06:22] recognizes
[1:06:23] is what he said
[1:06:26] every word of God is true
[1:06:30] every word of man
[1:06:32] is a lie
[1:06:35] and Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:06:38] my word will not
[1:06:41] pass away
[1:06:46] he says
[1:06:48] and it can come through he said and it
[1:06:51] can come through the taste
[1:06:53] it can come through the thinking
[1:06:56] through the reasoning there's no harm in
[1:07:00] it I have taste I have feelings I have a
[1:07:05] feeling that this is all right she can
[1:07:08] come right on down through that right
[1:07:11] into her soul if her soul is of that
[1:07:15] type it shows that she isn't drawing
[1:07:18] through God's filter
[1:07:23] very simple
[1:07:25] we know that God's word is the thinking
[1:07:29] man's filter
[1:07:32] and then we just want to I this one up
[1:07:35] close in this because I I just think
[1:07:38] that what that if we could get to the
[1:07:42] Great understanding that
[1:07:45] we have
[1:07:47] no choice
[1:07:51] we've been on the Journey of life
[1:07:54] we've come up through seven Church ages
[1:07:56] we've come up building through the
[1:07:59] statue of a perfect man we've worked to
[1:08:02] have Temperance and patience we've
[1:08:04] worked on all these virtues we've we've
[1:08:07] worked on on godliness and goodness
[1:08:09] we've worked on all these things through
[1:08:12] seven Church ages we've been working on
[1:08:15] our flesh we've been trying to become
[1:08:17] more christ-like we've been coming all
[1:08:20] this journey that we've taken as
[1:08:22] Christians to be real Christians and to
[1:08:25] keep the word of God and now we finally
[1:08:27] path finally leads us and it leads us to
[1:08:31] this one great thing before we can enter
[1:08:34] in to that place we need to be to leave
[1:08:38] and it's this filter
[1:08:42] because go read statue of perfect man go
[1:08:45] read what he talks about the Holy Spirit
[1:08:47] go read what he talks about the holy of
[1:08:50] holies he says the spirit is there to
[1:08:53] meet you
[1:08:55] to find out if there's anything there
[1:08:57] that can't enter in
[1:09:02] so what else if you enter in there and
[1:09:04] you've got something
[1:09:06] that ain't right what happens you get
[1:09:09] tossed out
[1:09:12] how many people in their Christian
[1:09:14] Journey have tried to enter into that
[1:09:17] Perfection and they keep getting tossed
[1:09:19] out and they don't know why
[1:09:22] they don't know why they find themselves
[1:09:24] back at the that same place because you
[1:09:27] can't bypass the filter you can't bypass
[1:09:31] the wedding gown you can't bypass being
[1:09:34] made and and brought into subjection to
[1:09:39] the word you can't bypass that step
[1:09:44] just like the people that stayed home
[1:09:47] tonight I hope you're listening but let
[1:09:50] me tell you streaming ain't gonna get
[1:09:52] you there
[1:09:54] now if you have to stream because of
[1:09:56] health or you have to stream because of
[1:09:58] finances that's one thing
[1:10:02] but if you're streaming for a substitute
[1:10:05] that doesn't filter through God's word
[1:10:08] God's word says forsake not the
[1:10:11] assembling of yourselves together
[1:10:14] streaming is a deception of the devil
[1:10:21] and I just might do away with it
[1:10:27] it's poisoned the church
[1:10:37] we might as well do away with local
[1:10:39] assemblies
[1:10:42] we are we ought to do away with the
[1:10:44] ministry of the pastor feeding the sheep
[1:10:47] that God's given them
[1:10:49] because now we've got a universal church
[1:10:53] one Holy Catholic Apostolic Universal
[1:10:57] message
[1:11:02] we do
[1:11:04] I'm sorry
[1:11:06] I'm not preaching against people
[1:11:09] it's just unbelief
[1:11:14] we don't filter it
[1:11:17] the scripture says
[1:11:19] that were a body
[1:11:21] fitted and joined together
[1:11:23] each one supplying the need of the other
[1:11:28] what's I I thought what Brother Gary
[1:11:30] share with me is beautiful he said what
[1:11:32] is foot washing it's where you bear the
[1:11:35] burden of the person's feet that you're
[1:11:37] watching you're humbling yourself you're
[1:11:40] exalting them you're lifting them up
[1:11:42] you're saying I'm here to serve you I'm
[1:11:44] here for you I'm here to wash your feet
[1:11:49] put that out the window the church
[1:11:51] hardly does it anymore
[1:11:55] see the the
[1:11:58] we think we're in better shape than we
[1:12:01] really are
[1:12:03] because we can't stand back and look at
[1:12:06] ourselves
[1:12:07] because the we've we've taken the word
[1:12:10] of God to be binoculars we're looking
[1:12:13] out to see what we can see in other
[1:12:15] words we take the word of God can we see
[1:12:17] a worldly can we see denominations can
[1:12:20] we see the political trend of the day
[1:12:23] can we see the days of Noah can you see
[1:12:26] this can you see that and in one sense
[1:12:29] it is a binocular but until it becomes a
[1:12:32] mirror it has no effect on you
[1:12:35] and you don't change
[1:12:41] and I don't want to be in the same
[1:12:43] spiritual mind actions
[1:12:48] and have no growth or no developer no
[1:12:51] increase in love and power after 50
[1:12:54] years of being a Christian I want to
[1:12:57] enter that Capstone and I've got to
[1:12:59] bring myself to the realization that I
[1:13:02] have got to go through that filter I
[1:13:05] have got to get my thinking and put it
[1:13:08] through that filter
[1:13:11] I don't have an option
[1:13:15] just because I say I'm elect just
[1:13:18] because I say I'm chosen just because
[1:13:20] I'm saying that well what have I been
[1:13:23] chosen to I've been chosen to be one of
[1:13:26] those that goes through the filter
[1:13:32] I want to be filtered
[1:13:34] try me prove me O Lord
[1:13:37] that's what he said
[1:13:40] he said
[1:13:44] he says what can I say
[1:13:47] you can't say that Bob haired woman
[1:13:52] for a woman
[1:13:54] is of god you can't say that Bob the
[1:13:57] hair woman for a woman is of God the
[1:13:59] Bible said it's not
[1:14:01] so it's the filter of the world
[1:14:04] and if you love the world one Speck of
[1:14:07] the world the love of God isn't even in
[1:14:10] you see what's that well what's drawing
[1:14:15] it is something down on the inside
[1:14:18] drawing the soul is drawing your
[1:14:22] resources through
[1:14:25] drawing the resources through the
[1:14:28] outside down through the spirit into the
[1:14:32] soul
[1:14:34] and if the soul loves the world it's
[1:14:37] dead
[1:14:38] I don't care how anointed
[1:14:40] it is out here and how righteous it is
[1:14:45] out here
[1:14:47] down here it's dead for he that loveth
[1:14:52] the world are the things of the world
[1:14:54] the love of God is not even in them no
[1:14:56] matter how religious
[1:15:03] it doesn't matter the drawing of it
[1:15:06] isn't it isn't good they draw all they
[1:15:09] draw all these things but they keep
[1:15:11] filtering out the word
[1:15:15] oh my
[1:15:17] God you know every he said each one of
[1:15:20] them has to go go through that great
[1:15:23] process he says look he says
[1:15:27] they like Esau outwardly okay Esau is
[1:15:32] religious on the outside
[1:15:35] and when it comes to religion it seemed
[1:15:38] to be more religious than Jacob was he
[1:15:41] seemed to be a better man than Jacob was
[1:15:44] but on the inside of him what
[1:15:48] he but on the inside of him what he was
[1:15:51] he was outwardly religious but his
[1:15:55] thinking was not
[1:15:57] filtered
[1:16:00] that's paragraph 116 but his thinking
[1:16:05] was not
[1:16:07] filtered
[1:16:10] so what do you think God's judging you
[1:16:12] by
[1:16:14] he's judging you by how you're filtering
[1:16:17] you're thinking
[1:16:21] this is a new Step Church
[1:16:25] you understand you know it's it's like
[1:16:29] okay you've been to class now it's time
[1:16:32] to put everything that you said be not
[1:16:35] hearers of a word but be doers of the
[1:16:38] word it is a brand new
[1:16:42] twist if I can say it that I don't have
[1:16:45] words to say what I want to say
[1:16:48] he says
[1:16:49] but his thinking was not filtered he
[1:16:53] didn't think right
[1:16:55] of the birthright
[1:17:00] he didn't think
[1:17:02] that God the birthright meant as much as
[1:17:07] God said it did
[1:17:10] he was
[1:17:12] there he was said I'm hungry what
[1:17:17] difference it makes about the old
[1:17:20] Birthright you can have it if you want
[1:17:23] it
[1:17:24] oh my
[1:17:27] I go to church I'm just as good as you
[1:17:30] are my denomination why it's one of the
[1:17:34] greatest in the world my mother belonged
[1:17:37] to it my father belonged to it all this
[1:17:40] that and the other my pastor was
[1:17:42] educated he's got so and so that puts
[1:17:46] him that much farther away from God it
[1:17:50] ain't a thinking man's filter
[1:17:54] and we could just go on but
[1:18:00] Esau failed
[1:18:02] to filter
[1:18:03] and so that's what our our our just our
[1:18:07] thought today that we want to finally
[1:18:09] bring it down you've got something in
[1:18:13] you that's drawing
[1:18:15] we've put a lot of emphasis on the seed
[1:18:20] haven't we
[1:18:22] and the word going to the seed
[1:18:25] but there's a lot of other things that
[1:18:27] mix in with it when it comes
[1:18:30] Satan appears as an angel of Light
[1:18:34] Satan is mixing his gospel
[1:18:37] he's always there to add a little
[1:18:41] something to put a little something in
[1:18:43] to to sneak in there and add to and take
[1:18:48] away
[1:18:50] so it behooves us now more than ever to
[1:18:55] recognize that I've got to stand up
[1:18:58] and with everything that's going on I've
[1:19:01] got to get steadfast in my heart
[1:19:04] the filter
[1:19:06] and may I just say in my own personal
[1:19:09] belief
[1:19:11] I believe that
[1:19:13] this is
[1:19:15] God's ultimate
[1:19:17] filter
[1:19:19] this filter worked in the days of Moses
[1:19:25] in the Old Testament
[1:19:27] when Jesus came it worked in the first
[1:19:30] church
[1:19:31] and it worked for Seven Ages
[1:19:35] but in this last stage
[1:19:38] there was another horse rider went out
[1:19:41] and he was a pale horse rider
[1:19:44] he was a mix of all the colors of all
[1:19:48] the deceptions of all the false
[1:19:51] doctrines he appears as an angel of
[1:19:54] Light
[1:19:54] he comes in the greatest deception that
[1:19:58] he's ever come
[1:20:02] we know that where histories are
[1:20:06] we know that Israel is in the Homeland
[1:20:08] we know we're in the days of Noah we
[1:20:11] know that we're in the Sodom condition
[1:20:14] all those things have come down and now
[1:20:17] there's a deception that's out there
[1:20:19] that's greater than there's ever been
[1:20:22] never there's been an age that men have
[1:20:25] made claims
[1:20:27] many men make claims to be Messengers
[1:20:30] Messengers to hear Messengers to their
[1:20:33] the eighth messenger the anointed one of
[1:20:36] Christ in the last day how many knows
[1:20:38] that that's promised in this day
[1:20:41] many will come
[1:20:43] many false anointed ones
[1:20:45] but God has given
[1:20:48] the filter
[1:20:50] to filter it all by
[1:20:55] he opened the seven seal filter
[1:21:00] to the church
[1:21:02] that now they can filter
[1:21:05] everything that said
[1:21:08] no matter how religious it is
[1:21:11] they can filter it
[1:21:13] through the word of God
[1:21:16] and you'll never get the result by
[1:21:21] bypassing the filter
[1:21:24] everything that's of God comes through
[1:21:28] the filter
[1:21:31] on this side
[1:21:34] he still loves you he still saves you
[1:21:37] but then when he takes you through the
[1:21:39] filter you're refined
[1:21:43] and he removes certain things from you
[1:21:46] and then you you're there for a while
[1:21:49] but then he brings you back and puts you
[1:21:52] through this filter and this filter and
[1:21:55] he's going to filter you right into the
[1:21:58] Capstone
[1:21:59] and one of these days the capstone's
[1:22:01] taken off excuse my analogy but it
[1:22:04] really makes me feel good because I so
[1:22:07] want to leave this world
[1:22:09] anyway God bless you we'll have
[1:22:12] communion a billy why don't you come and
[1:22:14] read the communion scriptures uh for us
[1:22:17] this evening and and
[1:22:21] I just hope that
[1:22:23] in my heart that you recognize the next
[1:22:28] time
[1:22:30] that you're pondering
[1:22:34] and thinking
[1:22:36] that you can actually stop yourself and
[1:22:39] say oh I'm thinking right now
[1:22:43] my mind's working
[1:22:45] you know like when you lay in bed and
[1:22:47] you try to go to sleep and your mind's
[1:22:49] working you say oh
[1:22:51] my mind's working in you're the day when
[1:22:55] you're living in your thing and that you
[1:22:58] catch the thoughts that are coming into
[1:23:00] you and you'll realize you know what
[1:23:03] there's a lot of things pressing in on
[1:23:05] me I better get my filter out and make
[1:23:08] sure none of that stuff gets into my
[1:23:11] heart and into my spirit and I think if
[1:23:15] I do that I'm going to find myself being
[1:23:17] a much more powerful Christian a much
[1:23:20] more word Christian and I'll have more
[1:23:23] of the nature
[1:23:25] of the Lord because let this mind be in
[1:23:28] you that was in Christ Jesus and I think
[1:23:31] that's all of our goal isn't it to be
[1:23:34] without spotter without wrinkle so God
[1:23:36] bless you I hope you enjoyed the word
[1:23:37] today I recommend that you listen and
[1:23:41] you study uh all of the message but
[1:23:44] maybe if you get a chance just take a
[1:23:46] look at think amen's Filter Hey Lord
[1:23:49] richly bless you
[1:23:53] hey man let's talk stand this
[1:23:56] brothers are bringing let's read in
[1:23:59] First Corinthians chapter 11 we'll start
[1:24:03] from the 23rd verse
[1:24:05] says for I have received of the Lord
[1:24:07] that which I have delivered unto you
[1:24:10] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:24:12] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:24:15] and when he had given thanks
[1:24:17] he breaks it and said take eat this is
[1:24:21] my body
[1:24:22] which is broken for you
[1:24:24] do do this
[1:24:26] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:24:30] same manner he also took the cup
[1:24:33] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:24:36] the New Testament in my blood
[1:24:39] do
[1:24:40] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:24:44] remembrance of me for as often as ye eat
[1:24:47] this bread and drink this cup
[1:24:50] ye do show the Lord's death till I till
[1:24:54] he comes
[1:24:56] wherefore whatsoever shall eat this
[1:24:59] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:25:01] unworldly shall be guilty of the body
[1:25:04] and the blood of the Lord but let every
[1:25:06] man examine himself
[1:25:08] and so let him eat of the bread and
[1:25:12] drink of this cup
[1:25:14] for he that eateth and drink it
[1:25:16] unworldly eat it and drink it damnation
[1:25:19] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:25:22] body
[1:25:23] for this cause many a weak and sickly
[1:25:25] among you and many sleep
[1:25:29] for if we will judge ourselves
[1:25:32] we shouldn't be we should not be judged
[1:25:35] but when we are judged
[1:25:38] we are chasing of the Lord
[1:25:41] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:25:45] world wherefore by Brethren when ye come
[1:25:48] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:25:52] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:25:54] home that ye come not together unto
[1:25:57] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:26:00] order when I come
[1:26:04] let's pray for the bread and then you
[1:26:06] may be seated
[1:26:12] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:26:15] have before us this bread
[1:26:18] that represents
[1:26:21] Lord your body
[1:26:23] which is the body word that the bride
[1:26:28] feeds on now in this day
[1:26:31] Lord It's the sacrifice broken
[1:26:36] that your spirit was sent forth on a
[1:26:40] many-membered body
[1:26:42] father and we remember the great price
[1:26:44] that you paid at Calvary
[1:26:47] that you could reveal the father to us
[1:26:52] and where we were with him in eternity
[1:26:55] father and and we're so grateful for
[1:26:58] that Lord we've been praying today and
[1:27:01] as we listened in and read from the
[1:27:05] message
[1:27:06] of a thinking man's filter
[1:27:09] Lord the prophet of the hour imploring
[1:27:12] us with all of his spirit and heart to
[1:27:17] make sure that we have this filter
[1:27:19] father even communion as it's presented
[1:27:23] in Corinthians it presented as a filter
[1:27:27] let every man examine himself
[1:27:30] then let him eat at that bread
[1:27:33] whatever you do don't eat unworthily
[1:27:36] father what a wonderful example of
[1:27:40] filtering our thoughts in our hearts
[1:27:44] before we partake father filtering is a
[1:27:48] part of the very process that you've
[1:27:51] developed that everything would come
[1:27:53] through your word for everything that
[1:27:56] came from your word
[1:27:58] to return back to the word has to go
[1:28:02] through the word we ask that this
[1:28:04] communion would be that for us this
[1:28:06] evening bless this bread father bless
[1:28:09] this wine which is the life father the
[1:28:12] stimulation of the spirit the great call
[1:28:15] of God that draws us through the filter
[1:28:17] the hunger that draws us to your word
[1:28:21] and through your word that the life that
[1:28:24] was in Christ may be the life that's in
