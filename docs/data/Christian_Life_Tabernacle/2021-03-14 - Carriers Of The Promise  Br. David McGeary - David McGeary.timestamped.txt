[19:10] hands in the name of jesus christ we
[19:12] pray
[19:13] amen
[19:15] [Music]
[19:22] amen want to welcome everyone in the
[19:25] house of god all our visitors
[19:27] amen i'm pretty sure we're feeling the
[19:29] effect of daylight saving
[19:31] it's never fun when you lose amen
[19:34] amen god bless you money fight for the
[19:36] mike for some reading this morning god
[19:38] bless you
[19:56] today
[20:00] you know it's always amazing to me when
[20:01] you read the scripture even though it
[20:03] was written thousands of years ago
[20:05] it still feels often very much like it's
[20:07] pulled out of today's headlines
[20:10] you know psalm 14 we'll be reading that
[20:14] this morning
[20:16] and it opens with this verse it says the
[20:19] fool
[20:20] hath said in his heart there is no god
[20:26] you know if you read psalm 14 and psalm
[20:28] 53 these chapters are virtually
[20:30] identical they're mirrors
[20:32] of each other and both of them begin
[20:34] with this same
[20:36] sobering statement
[20:40] you know i got to thinking about how
[20:41] significant that statement was but at
[20:43] the end of the day it sums up what a
[20:46] foolish person is it's someone
[20:49] that in their heart there is no god
[20:55] you know proverbs 23 7 says this for as
[20:58] he thinketh
[20:58] in his heart so is he
[21:03] you know in everything that these people
[21:05] do
[21:06] everything they say everything they
[21:09] think how they conduct themselves the
[21:11] decisions they make
[21:13] all arises out of the fact that in them
[21:16] there's a declaration that there's
[21:18] there's no absolute
[21:20] there's no divine plan you know
[21:23] everything is random nothing really
[21:26] matters there's no
[21:28] right or wrong you know they're
[21:30] basically free to chart their own course
[21:35] jesus said in matthew 12 for out of the
[21:37] abundance of the heart
[21:39] the mouth speaketh
[21:42] you know as we'll read in in psalm 14
[21:45] here
[21:45] there is an effect a result
[21:48] of that kind of a heart you know and
[21:51] where we're watching both in
[21:53] the psalm and in the society around us
[21:55] as an entire civilization
[21:58] built around the fact that there is no
[22:00] god
[22:01] in their heart you know and
[22:04] the fact is is that their heart is
[22:06] speaking the truth because if there is
[22:08] no god in their heart how
[22:09] can they witness anything different
[22:12] right
[22:14] you know sooner or later
[22:17] you know the heart of a fool will
[22:18] manifest itself
[22:20] in a walk of iniquity a walk of iniquity
[22:23] is doing your own thing walking
[22:25] according to your own heart just doing
[22:26] what feels is right
[22:30] proverbs 28 26 says this he that
[22:32] trusteth in his own heart is a fool
[22:36] proverbs 18 2 says a fool hath no
[22:40] delight in
[22:41] understanding but that his heart may
[22:42] discover itself
[22:44] how many times have you heard about
[22:46] people going to find themselves
[22:49] that's the journey of a fool that's
[22:50] right
[22:52] proverbs 16 25 says this there is a way
[22:55] which seemeth right unto a man
[22:58] but the end thereof is destruction is
[23:00] death
[23:02] you know so as we read psalm 14 it's
[23:04] hard to miss the fact that the entire
[23:06] chapter almost and in the entire society
[23:08] we live in
[23:10] is constructed of people fulfilling the
[23:13] scripture
[23:16] you know it makes an interesting
[23:17] statement about these people in verse 5
[23:20] it says there were they in great fear
[23:25] in psalm 53 its mirror scripture says
[23:28] there were they in great fear where no
[23:31] fear was
[23:33] you know so the result of this is not
[23:35] just
[23:36] a life of iniquity but an entire
[23:40] life an entire society an entire
[23:42] civilization
[23:43] of constant fear fear of harm
[23:46] fear of man fear of finance fear of
[23:49] safety and death and all these things
[23:54] you know it's a sad condition but buried
[23:57] in the scripture
[23:59] although the whole thing may talk about
[24:01] the heart of a fool and the effect
[24:02] thereof
[24:04] and the fact that there is no god there
[24:06] buried in the scripture is a little
[24:07] verse where there is god
[24:10] you know it's hidden away is this little
[24:12] verse one little statement where he may
[24:14] be found
[24:16] it says in verse 5 but god
[24:20] is in the generation of the righteous
[24:24] while he may not be found in the heart
[24:26] of the fool he can be found
[24:28] in the generation of the righteous you
[24:30] know that's an interesting statement the
[24:32] generation
[24:33] of the righteous and just every once in
[24:36] a while i'll just look up the word in
[24:37] webster's dictionary just to say
[24:39] just to see what it would say this is
[24:42] the very first
[24:43] definition of generation a body of
[24:46] living beings
[24:48] constituting a single step in the line
[24:51] of descent
[24:52] from an ancestor
[24:56] all i could say is amen when i read that
[25:00] you know hidden away in this chapter
[25:02] when everything seems to be built around
[25:04] foolishness there's just this little
[25:06] place
[25:07] where there's a generation of the
[25:08] righteous one
[25:11] a line that is a part of the lineage
[25:14] of their ancestor
[25:17] you know we certainly see foolish hearts
[25:19] on every side
[25:20] but i just wonder if there isn't those
[25:22] that are part of the generation of the
[25:24] righteous here
[25:25] this morning i think we can all testify
[25:27] the fact that once we were
[25:29] among those that had a foolish heart
[25:32] now can we be found part of the
[25:35] generation
[25:36] of the righteous a final witness a final
[25:39] testimony in this final age right
[25:42] so as we read psalm 14 this morning
[25:44] again it's just a really short chapter
[25:46] and while this civilization of
[25:48] foolishness around us may
[25:50] dominate the headlines you know i'm
[25:52] grateful that in
[25:54] verse 3 when it says when god looked
[25:55] down from heaven
[25:57] upon the children of men to see if there
[25:59] were any that did understand and seek
[26:01] god
[26:02] he found in verse 5 that god is in the
[26:04] generation of the righteous
[26:07] so let's just read that together psalm
[26:09] 14 is just really short
[26:11] starting in verse 1 it says the fool
[26:14] hath said in his heart
[26:16] there is no god they are corrupt they
[26:19] have done abominable works
[26:21] there is none that doeth good the lord
[26:24] looked down from heaven
[26:25] upon the children of men to see if there
[26:28] were any that did understand
[26:29] and seek god they are all gone aside
[26:33] they are all together become filthy
[26:35] there is none that doeth good no
[26:38] not one have all the workers of iniquity
[26:41] no knowledge
[26:42] who eat of my people as they eat bread
[26:45] and call not
[26:46] upon the lord there were they in great
[26:49] fear
[26:49] for god is in the generation of the
[26:52] righteous
[26:53] ye have shamed the council of the poor
[26:55] because the lord is his refuge
[26:58] oh that the salvation of israel will
[27:00] come out of zion
[27:02] when the lord bringeth back the
[27:03] captivity of his people
[27:05] jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be
[27:08] glad
[27:12] [Music]
[27:18] amen

[49:02] testimonies that have been given here
[49:03] lately
[49:06] brother mary's testimony on wednesday
[49:08] night which is phenomenal
[49:11] my brother kyle's testimony last sunday
[49:13] morning and then brother joel testimony
[49:16] sunday night for such faith builders to
[49:18] me because it just builds on
[49:19] what i'm about to tell you that god has
[49:22] done for me
[49:25] um over many years i've had
[49:28] issues with headaches and um i usually
[49:31] get them when i'm really overly tired or
[49:33] the weather changes
[49:34] and um considering migraines
[49:38] i guess and i've never really been to
[49:40] the doctor about them
[49:41] um and a week ago thursday i ended up
[49:45] getting one of those headaches in the
[49:46] afternoon and
[49:47] started taking medication and just laid
[49:50] down on the couch and
[49:51] took some more medicine later and it
[49:53] just wasn't going away and
[49:57] so i just started praying and of course
[49:59] it eated up later that evening and i was
[50:01] like okay you know
[50:02] thank you lord it's going away and
[50:05] um woke up friday morning
[50:08] and my head was hurting again just still
[50:10] lingering a little bit i said no i'm
[50:11] going to fight through this
[50:13] i've got some errands i got to do today
[50:14] and i've just got to get some things
[50:15] done so
[50:16] um i went on to the store and things and
[50:20] tim calls me while i'm at the store and
[50:21] asked me how i was feeling and i said
[50:22] well
[50:23] i thought i was going to be okay but i'm
[50:25] really not feeling well i didn't really
[50:27] i don't know if i was wearing a mask and
[50:28] i said i don't know if
[50:30] this was adding to it i said i can't
[50:32] breathe and i said my head's really
[50:33] starting to hurt so i think i'm just
[50:34] going to try to go home and try to eat a
[50:35] little something and go to bed lay down
[50:38] so um i went back home and i ate a
[50:41] little
[50:42] a little bit and i laid down the couch
[50:44] again and i fell asleep for a little
[50:45] while
[50:47] and i woke up and my head was hurting so
[50:49] bad
[50:50] so much pain and pressure on my right
[50:52] side then i could hardly even open my
[50:54] eyes and i said well i'm just going to
[50:55] get i'm just
[50:56] going to go to bed and um
[50:59] i was like you know well should i call
[51:01] tim or you know um
[51:03] i was really getting scared to my blood
[51:04] pressure my blood pressure was kind of
[51:06] up
[51:06] and um so i just got my phone and i laid
[51:09] down
[51:10] on the bed as i'll keep beside me
[51:11] because my brother joel said you know
[51:15] case i need to call 9-1-1 or something
[51:17] you know or call tim
[51:18] in the middle of all this but um i was
[51:21] like you know i think i'm just going to
[51:22] turn on the tape
[51:24] well i couldn't see well enough to pull
[51:26] up the table to pull up you know try to
[51:27] search for a tape or whatever so i just
[51:30] knew where the lifeline app is on my
[51:31] phone and i didn't i knew where it was
[51:33] so i clicked on it and i think voice
[51:35] radio it just plays continuous messages
[51:39] so i just pushed pushed it and um just
[51:42] laid down
[51:43] and it was at the end of the tape i
[51:45] think it was perseverant that that's
[51:47] what it said it was in the prayer line
[51:49] and um
[51:51] i finished that one off and it started
[51:52] the next tape and i heard brother
[51:54] branham say
[51:54] he started off just as numbers and then
[51:57] he goes in and he speaks a little bit
[51:59] and i fell asleep and um
[52:06] it was probably about an hour or so and
[52:09] i woke up to brother branham saying
[52:11] pretty forcefully
[52:13] speak to the rock it'll bring forth this
[52:15] water
[52:17] so i thought you know well i must be
[52:18] listening to speak to the rock
[52:20] um and my head was still really hurting
[52:23] um it was pounding and i was just like
[52:24] you know lord
[52:25] your prophet said speak to the rock and
[52:28] you're my rock and i need a healing
[52:29] touch from you and i'm
[52:32] i was kind of delirious and just kind of
[52:34] in and out of sleep and
[52:36] just i just continued to pray i could
[52:39] still hear brother
[52:40] ran him in the background by not really
[52:42] comprehending what he was saying
[52:44] but i heard him talking about the story
[52:46] of blonde bartimaeus
[52:47] and um
[52:51] sorry and um
[52:55] i was kind of fell back asleep for just
[52:57] a few minutes and my back up my head was
[52:59] just pounding and i could hear brother
[53:00] brandon was in the prayer line
[53:01] or he was praying and um
[53:05] i said lord please help me
[53:12] and i felt this strange feeling come
[53:15] over me
[53:16] and from the top of my head to my feet
[53:18] this tingling
[53:20] three times it happened and i wasn't
[53:23] sure what was happening it really kind
[53:24] of scared me
[53:25] because it was pretty overwhelming
[53:29] and so i just like there and i was kind
[53:31] of like i said kind of delirious
[53:32] type and here's still here brother
[53:34] branham and he was praying
[53:36] and then
[53:39] the tape ended and i woke up
[53:43] like wide awake my headache was gone
[53:47] and i was like and i stood up and i was
[53:49] just like
[53:50] okay did that just really just happen to
[53:53] me
[53:55] and i just got up into us just praying
[53:57] praising god for what he had done and
[53:59] tim called about
[54:00] about then and he asked checking on me
[54:02] and i said i told him i said i don't
[54:03] know what just happened
[54:06] and i just proceeded to tell him and
[54:11] he said well i don't know but on he said
[54:13] i do know that god's a healer
[54:16] and you know the next couple of days i
[54:18] was thinking okay well you know this is
[54:21] god just really touched me like that i
[54:22] really feel his presence that strong
[54:25] and the devil was just fighting me on it
[54:27] oh no you know it's just all in your
[54:28] mind
[54:29] you know you're just you know you tell
[54:30] somebody that they're gonna think you're
[54:32] crazy
[54:33] and um then come church sunday morning
[54:35] and brother kyle gave his testimony
[54:38] and tim just kind of looked over at me
[54:40] and i just kind of grinned and
[54:42] went on throughout the day and then come
[54:43] to church sunday night brother joel
[54:45] against his testimony
[54:46] and i was like you know what i really
[54:48] need to go back and listen to that
[54:49] message and really listen to what god
[54:51] said in it
[54:52] and uh so i pulled up on the table speak
[54:55] to the rock
[54:56] and there's three messages that came up
[54:59] and i was like okay
[55:00] well i remember brother brown started
[55:02] out with numbers and so i listened to
[55:03] the beginning of each one and um
[55:06] it was november 15th 1953 in owensboro
[55:09] kentucky
[55:11] and i just prayed i said god i need some
[55:13] confirmation
[55:14] because i'm listening to this so if
[55:17] you'll allow me i'm just going to read
[55:18] just a little bit of what came from that
[55:20] message and he's
[55:21] um brother brandon was reading from
[55:22] numbers chapter 20
[55:25] verse 7. and it said and lord spake unto
[55:28] moses saying take thy rock
[55:29] and gather thou the assembly together
[55:31] thou and aaron thy brother
[55:34] and speak to the rock before their eyes
[55:35] and it now i want you to notice
[55:38] it shall bring forth his his is a
[55:40] personal pronoun now now see
[55:43] it shall bring forth his water and thou
[55:45] shalt bring forth water before them and
[55:46] out of the rock
[55:48] and he went on and listened to the you
[55:50] know more the message and it came to the
[55:51] part where i woke up where he said speak
[55:53] to the rock he said
[55:54] it'll bring forth its water and they
[55:58] went everywhere and they couldn't find
[55:59] water nowhere god told them god speak to
[56:01] the rock go speak to the rock
[56:03] ridiculous the carnal mind would have
[56:05] said well that's the driest place in the
[56:07] desert
[56:09] the rock was the oldest driest looking
[56:11] place and yet
[56:13] where they sang through every old little
[56:15] old place where there ought to be water
[56:17] no water went to this oasis no water
[56:20] went down here where
[56:21] the spring was no water and then god
[56:23] tells them to do the ridiculous
[56:25] go speak to the driest thing there is an
[56:28] old rock setting up there on the hill go
[56:30] speak to that
[56:30] it'll bring forth water well where's the
[56:33] water at
[56:34] well if any water would be down here in
[56:36] the valley not up there on the hill
[56:38] not in that dry rock but that's where it
[56:40] is today
[56:41] when the god is done when the doctor has
[56:43] done everything he can do for you
[56:45] he's saying through every doctor's
[56:47] office every hospital yet god said speak
[56:49] to the rock
[56:52] and it goes on it's um
[56:56] it says that the doctor can't do
[56:57] anything for me how in the world is
[56:59] anything else going to do
[57:00] well just speak to the rock and find out
[57:03] moses went out there spoke to the rock
[57:05] and when he spoke to the rock the waters
[57:06] began to flow and people began to drink
[57:09] now are you on speaking terms with the
[57:10] rock today listen brother i believe it's
[57:13] time we spoke to the rock
[57:14] don't you believe so and then he goes on
[57:17] and talks about
[57:18] um why bartimaeus gives that little
[57:21] story and then it comes down to the part
[57:23] when he was praying and it's at the end
[57:25] of the message and he says
[57:27] strange as it seems with your head bowed
[57:30] the angel of the lord is here at the
[57:31] platform
[57:33] i know he wants to bless you strange how
[57:36] he jerked me out of that wasn't it
[57:37] i never had anything like this happen
[57:40] right here is that light standing right
[57:42] in the room
[57:42] right now god of heaven be merciful
[57:47] he says see hang over that little girl

[57:53] her with liver trouble

[1:11:42] amen god bless if you have your bibles
[1:11:45] let's turn over into saint luke
[1:11:49] this morning and the fourth chapter and
[1:11:53] i i really really appreciated that
[1:11:56] testimony this morning
[1:11:59] you know i was i don't have a video in
[1:12:02] my
[1:12:02] uh my room back there so that's why i
[1:12:06] keep having to step
[1:12:07] out every service because i i can't see
[1:12:10] back there at all but um
[1:12:13] and i don't hear very good anymore so
[1:12:16] but you know when she held those three
[1:12:20] fingers up
[1:12:23] i knew there was some significance did i
[1:12:25] didn't know what it was
[1:12:26] you know what i mean but it was like a
[1:12:28] big question mark
[1:12:30] you know why three why three and then
[1:12:33] when he said that spirit
[1:12:35] come down on those three people oh
[1:12:39] don't taste the same yesterday today
[1:12:42] amen you know if he could do that for
[1:12:44] our sister he can do that for you
[1:12:46] today you know and uh
[1:12:50] you know and and i just thought it was
[1:12:52] so beautiful because you don't think
[1:12:54] like those things will happen to you
[1:12:56] you believe they're for everybody else
[1:12:59] but they're not for
[1:13:00] everybody else they're for you every
[1:13:03] promise in the book is mine
[1:13:06] every chapter every verse and
[1:13:09] every line amen
[1:13:12] amen so i'm not going to be long this
[1:13:16] morning because you've all lost an
[1:13:18] hour of sleep i certainly did
[1:13:24] in fact i wake up almost the same time
[1:13:26] every sunday morning
[1:13:28] it's just i just do that it's just kind
[1:13:31] of been i guess
[1:13:32] so many years while i woke up at the
[1:13:34] same time i always woke up
[1:13:36] but the clock it left
[1:13:40] you know it ran it ran ahead so i'm
[1:13:43] still
[1:13:44] trying to catch up this morning but do
[1:13:46] you love him this morning
[1:13:50] if you just bear with me this morning as
[1:13:53] we just
[1:13:54] speak our heart to you i am leaving this
[1:13:58] wednesday to go see my mother
[1:14:01] i haven't been able to see her and and
[1:14:05] my my sister lives out there and
[1:14:09] my sister is kind of protective so she
[1:14:12] didn't want me to see my mother
[1:14:15] and so i've been really wanting to go
[1:14:17] out there and see her she's
[1:14:20] 98 years old this july she'll be 99
[1:14:25] she still cooks she still walks
[1:14:29] she doesn't hear as good as she used to
[1:14:31] but she can still carry on a
[1:14:33] conversation
[1:14:34] she she's really a marvelous
[1:14:38] uh person to be so full of joy
[1:14:43] and happy and still a tremendous
[1:14:46] wit and to carry on a great uh
[1:14:49] conversation and and so i'm really
[1:14:52] thrilled to go out and then i'm gonna
[1:14:54] try to get back out there for a 99th
[1:14:57] birthday
[1:14:58] if the lord will grant that so i'm
[1:15:00] excited about going to see her
[1:15:02] and of course we have wonderful brothers
[1:15:05] here that'll take care of the services
[1:15:07] for you but if god keeps us moving you
[1:15:10] know we need him
[1:15:13] amen we're not built on a man we're not
[1:15:15] built on a personality
[1:15:17] we're built on revelations because
[1:15:19] that's what the church is built on it's
[1:15:21] built on revelation and
[1:15:24] and that's what you you have is you have
[1:15:26] that great
[1:15:27] revelation in your heart let's read this
[1:15:30] scripture
[1:15:30] m and uh this message that we're
[1:15:34] speaking
[1:15:35] on is the message that follows birth
[1:15:38] pains
[1:15:39] so this is the next message brother
[1:15:42] branham preached after birth pains
[1:15:44] and we'll try see if lord will help us
[1:15:46] tied it together a little bit
[1:15:49] and he came to nazareth
[1:15:52] where he had been brought up and as
[1:15:55] his custom was he went into the
[1:15:59] synagogue
[1:16:00] on the sabbath day and stood up
[1:16:03] for to read and
[1:16:07] there was delivered unto him the book
[1:16:12] of the prophet isaiah
[1:16:15] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:16:19] the place
[1:16:20] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:16:23] lord
[1:16:24] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[1:16:29] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:16:33] he hath sent me to heal the
[1:16:35] brokenhearted
[1:16:38] to preach deliverance to the captive
[1:16:41] and recover this sight
[1:16:44] to the blind to set at liberty
[1:16:48] them that are bruised and to preach
[1:16:52] the acceptable year of the lord
[1:16:57] isn't that wonderful i mean
[1:17:02] what a what a wonderful and he closed
[1:17:06] the book
[1:17:07] and he gave it again to the minister
[1:17:10] and sat down and the eyes of
[1:17:14] all of them that were in this synagogue
[1:17:17] were fastened on him
[1:17:19] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:17:23] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:17:27] amen father bless your word in your
[1:17:29] precious name we pray
[1:17:31] amen god bless you may be seated this
[1:17:33] morning
[1:17:40] you know the background to this and
[1:17:44] i'm not going to preach to you this
[1:17:47] morning
[1:17:48] the message this day this scripture
[1:17:51] is fulfilled uh i really recommend
[1:17:56] to sit down and to listen to this
[1:18:00] but there was a little something that
[1:18:02] came out of it
[1:18:04] that struck my heart and if i could say
[1:18:07] that a message within a message
[1:18:11] uh one of those little things that the
[1:18:14] lord whispers to you
[1:18:16] and uh uh it he kind of
[1:18:19] hid in there maybe just for
[1:18:23] me personally but it's still one of
[1:18:27] those
[1:18:27] great little things if i could call it
[1:18:30] that
[1:18:31] an understanding and that's one thing
[1:18:34] that we always desire
[1:18:35] is to have our understanding enlightened
[1:18:40] uh the you know the scriptures
[1:18:43] isn't always did you hear it anybody can
[1:18:46] hear
[1:18:47] but did you understand it you know
[1:18:50] and uh you know the story behind this
[1:18:53] brother branham preached the message
[1:18:55] called birth pain
[1:18:57] and when he went to at the
[1:19:01] businessmen's meeting to preach that
[1:19:03] sunday afternoon
[1:19:06] he went to read a scripture and he had a
[1:19:09] brand new bible
[1:19:10] and the two pages in the bible stuck
[1:19:13] together
[1:19:14] so he would look at the 16th chapter and
[1:19:16] then when he turned it over
[1:19:18] he ended up in the 17th chapter
[1:19:21] and he didn't realize those
[1:19:24] books were stuck together those pages
[1:19:27] were stuck together
[1:19:29] well they had a visitor visiting him and
[1:19:32] he was the archbishop
[1:19:35] of a catholic priest he was the
[1:19:37] archbishop
[1:19:38] of one of the eastern groups of the
[1:19:42] church
[1:19:43] and he got up with all his robes on
[1:19:47] and everything and he walked over to
[1:19:49] brother branham and
[1:19:50] and and told him
[1:19:55] here read it from my book
[1:19:58] and and so brother brahm took his bible
[1:20:02] and he read the scripture about
[1:20:05] the church being in travail like a woman
[1:20:09] being in a travail you know a woman
[1:20:11] represents the church
[1:20:13] and how to be in trouble and he turned
[1:20:14] around and he thanked the brother
[1:20:17] and later on you know his wife
[1:20:20] was telling him how bad she felt how
[1:20:23] nervous she was because
[1:20:24] she gave him that bible for his birthday
[1:20:26] and
[1:20:27] and and so
[1:20:30] he was driving down the road and all of
[1:20:33] a sudden
[1:20:34] a voice spoke to him and said the priest
[1:20:37] handed him the book and and and
[1:20:41] then he realized how beautiful
[1:20:44] all that was transpiring he was
[1:20:47] preaching the birth of the church
[1:20:50] and that's what was taking place
[1:20:53] amen that the church was being
[1:20:57] birthed and it wasn't the church of ages
[1:21:00] gone by
[1:21:01] that were being birthed it's a church
[1:21:03] for this age
[1:21:05] that being that is coming to pass so
[1:21:08] you're
[1:21:08] we're not part of the church
[1:21:12] of uh the message of uh
[1:21:15] luther and that church we're a part of
[1:21:19] that church
[1:21:20] but that life has moved on
[1:21:23] and that life has moved on and we
[1:21:26] noticed
[1:21:27] that we read in the scriptures in in
[1:21:30] revelations
[1:21:31] chapter 13 that we saw that the beast
[1:21:34] was wounded but then he came back and he
[1:21:37] could begin to prevail
[1:21:38] and he began to conquer and denominate
[1:21:43] every time the spirit moved he came with
[1:21:46] his spirit
[1:21:48] and tried to conquer it and denominate
[1:21:51] it and bring it
[1:21:52] under his system and that's what satan
[1:21:55] always tries to do he's the prince of
[1:21:57] the air
[1:21:58] and he wants to try to bring everybody
[1:22:01] under his system he exalted himself
[1:22:05] above the angels and all the sons of god
[1:22:08] and he wanted to sit on the throne
[1:22:10] as god and so we actually know
[1:22:14] the purpose of the enemy
[1:22:17] the purpose of the enemy is to rule over
[1:22:20] you
[1:22:21] that's what he wants to do he'll use any
[1:22:24] means he can
[1:22:25] to rule you and control you he'll use
[1:22:28] the lust of the flesh
[1:22:30] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[1:22:32] he'll do whatever that
[1:22:34] he can do to be able to somehow
[1:22:37] take control of your life and if
[1:22:40] in in doing so without
[1:22:44] realizing it we become his servants
[1:22:47] and we labor under his rule
[1:22:50] to build his kingdom because i
[1:22:53] honestly think that guy is such a liar
[1:22:56] and satan is so deceived that you know
[1:23:00] the worst liar is someone that believes
[1:23:02] his own lie
[1:23:07] you know that's when you know you're
[1:23:08] hurting because when you believe
[1:23:11] your own lie you know so
[1:23:15] uh you know that's like looking in the
[1:23:16] mirror and saying man that's a good
[1:23:18] looking mirror
[1:23:20] you know you better pray through a
[1:23:23] little while
[1:23:26] but and so in in in
[1:23:29] in trying to just captivate and rule
[1:23:34] that every time god makes a move he
[1:23:37] cannot duplicate god
[1:23:40] he's not a creator god creates
[1:23:44] god created this bride church
[1:23:48] by his spoken word by the message that
[1:23:52] he
[1:23:53] sent and the word that he preached
[1:23:56] he created or brought into existence
[1:24:02] he said let there be and so
[1:24:05] as satan came up and so in conquered
[1:24:09] he once again was there in the
[1:24:12] pentecostal
[1:24:13] at the end of the pentecostal or church
[1:24:16] age he
[1:24:17] once again had captivated it he had
[1:24:19] turned them away
[1:24:21] from its purpose he had turned them away
[1:24:24] from their goal and and
[1:24:28] in in doing so uh
[1:24:31] the the messenger of the age
[1:24:35] was preaching out that that
[1:24:38] if there's got to be a birth there's got
[1:24:41] to be a church
[1:24:42] born and he expressed how that they've
[1:24:45] gone through all these pains
[1:24:47] and so we talked about it uh
[1:24:51] last week that we we we weren't
[1:24:54] preaching that maybe the gospel to the
[1:24:57] age
[1:24:58] or re preaching birth pains but
[1:25:01] what we spoke about was that that
[1:25:04] that's the way that it is he prophet of
[1:25:07] god says birth pains
[1:25:08] are to be so we each go through our
[1:25:12] our birth pains everything where there's
[1:25:15] a process
[1:25:16] that you have to go through you go
[1:25:18] through the mental battle you go through
[1:25:20] the physical battle
[1:25:22] you go to try to place it in your life
[1:25:24] you go through the struggle
[1:25:26] of trying to figure things out and all
[1:25:29] this
[1:25:29] is transpiring in you and many times you
[1:25:32] don't even realize where you are
[1:25:35] or what's going on and you don't you
[1:25:39] don't realize
[1:25:40] the the the struggle and that you're
[1:25:44] going through but
[1:25:45] that's part of the process because god's
[1:25:47] taking you
[1:25:48] to something and every time you come out
[1:25:51] of one environment
[1:25:52] into another environment there's a
[1:25:55] transition that takes place there's a
[1:25:57] birth pain that takes place
[1:25:59] as you grow up and and as as you
[1:26:03] are birthed yes and so
[1:26:06] in going into this uh um
[1:26:11] he was preaching out of the birth pains
[1:26:14] and he was
[1:26:15] beginning to speak that uh
[1:26:18] to the the the church
[1:26:22] and so the lord spoke to him and and
[1:26:25] gave this scripture to him
[1:26:26] this day this scripture was fulfilled
[1:26:29] and so brother van went back when he
[1:26:31] preached this message
[1:26:33] he preached uh about the
[1:26:36] hour that we live in so it's really a
[1:26:39] wonderful message it to me
[1:26:41] is one of the the best
[1:26:44] um places to get a
[1:26:47] real good revelation on the ministry of
[1:26:50] the son of man
[1:26:52] and and the messengers of oral roberts
[1:26:55] and billy graham and how that god went
[1:26:57] out to the church
[1:26:58] the different things that transpired in
[1:27:00] his ministry
[1:27:02] to bring it to pass but there's a little
[1:27:04] something different that came out of
[1:27:06] this message for me
[1:27:08] uh personally and i'd just like to share
[1:27:11] that
[1:27:12] with you because i know in my own
[1:27:14] personal life
[1:27:15] i'm going through a great
[1:27:18] uh uh birth pain
[1:27:22] of you know trying to come out of
[1:27:26] the way that i've lived my life for so
[1:27:28] long
[1:27:29] and trying to move into a different uh
[1:27:33] to just a different aspect and
[1:27:36] i don't know what it holds and and
[1:27:39] that's the hardest thing is we
[1:27:41] we like to step if we know where the
[1:27:44] step
[1:27:44] is you know what i mean and we like to
[1:27:48] step there
[1:27:49] if it's firm and it's solid
[1:27:52] but the step of faith
[1:27:56] is is the unknown
[1:27:59] step that's right you know i we used to
[1:28:02] tell a little story
[1:28:03] and you heard about it the man that fell
[1:28:06] off a cliff and
[1:28:07] he was holding on to a limb and
[1:28:10] and he kept yelling lord save me lord
[1:28:13] save me
[1:28:14] and the lord said i'll save you my son.
[1:28:20] and he said well lord save me lord save
[1:28:23] me
[1:28:23] and finally the lord said let go
[1:28:30] you know and it's it that's that
[1:28:33] birth pain and it we talked about that
[1:28:37] earlier in the service before that like
[1:28:39] we have catches we have
[1:28:42] things that we cling to and and
[1:28:45] we find we have those little safe spots
[1:28:48] that we cling to the
[1:28:50] understanding we cling to and we do that
[1:28:54] you know we cling to people sometimes
[1:28:57] and we
[1:28:57] we cling to little groups and the way
[1:29:00] that people are doing things we're not
[1:29:02] sure
[1:29:03] of the steps we take so we attach
[1:29:06] ourselves to the things that are
[1:29:08] around us and and we have little way
[1:29:11] places that we catch things but god
[1:29:14] really wants to birth a
[1:29:16] church into places that they've never
[1:29:19] walked
[1:29:19] before because he wants us to walk by
[1:29:23] faith
[1:29:23] he wants us to come up to a higher
[1:29:26] ground
[1:29:26] he wants the things that transpired with
[1:29:30] our sister and
[1:29:31] and listening to that tape going back
[1:29:33] and seeing the word of god
[1:29:35] and seeing that the very spirit that was
[1:29:37] working
[1:29:38] on that tape from that tape
[1:29:42] as she listened to it that spirit worked
[1:29:45] again
[1:29:47] i've experienced that a time or two in
[1:29:49] my life
[1:29:50] where the very thing that was wrong with
[1:29:52] me was the very thing that brother
[1:29:54] branham
[1:29:55] called out and it really
[1:29:58] made a great difference one of those
[1:30:01] experiences was the extreme
[1:30:03] extreme terrible stomach condition i had
[1:30:06] and on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:30:08] when brother bran was spoke
[1:30:10] at i i was made
[1:30:13] i was made whole and
[1:30:17] and so he's just living this morning i
[1:30:20] just
[1:30:20] and and that's our desire is that each
[1:30:23] of us
[1:30:24] can personally find that spot that we
[1:30:27] come in contact with that living god
[1:30:29] and know that he is real to us
[1:30:34] and so this little message that i want
[1:30:36] to share or
[1:30:38] a fellowship that i want to share with
[1:30:40] you before we baptize sister hannah this
[1:30:43] morning
[1:30:44] is is called carriers of the promise
[1:30:50] carriers of the promise and
[1:30:54] and it ties back to a little bit
[1:30:58] about birth pains but
[1:31:02] just to let it settle in our our thing
[1:31:05] so jesus is standing here he says
[1:31:08] we stand here tonight
[1:31:11] and say that jesus christ
[1:31:15] is the same yesterday today
[1:31:18] and forever and that is a
[1:31:22] wonderful statement that
[1:31:25] certainly that we make that he is the
[1:31:28] same
[1:31:29] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:34] and excuse me a moment
[1:31:38] and and so
[1:31:42] he makes that statement that he's the
[1:31:44] same yesterday
[1:31:46] and forever now when god
[1:31:50] god is the interpreter
[1:31:53] of his word
[1:31:57] that is how god god is the interpreter
[1:32:00] of his word
[1:32:02] is when he vindicates and proves it
[1:32:05] to be so right so god is the interpreter
[1:32:08] of the word
[1:32:10] when he vindicates it and proves it to
[1:32:13] be sold
[1:32:14] so he says
[1:32:18] that's his interpretation by making
[1:32:22] it come to pass there's where god's
[1:32:25] interpretation
[1:32:27] is when he makes his word
[1:32:30] come to pass he is interpreting
[1:32:34] it to you
[1:32:38] so when god makes his word come to pass
[1:32:41] that's the interpreter to you
[1:32:45] so you could hear many testimonies
[1:32:50] and those testimonies are god
[1:32:53] interpreting
[1:32:54] the word to them and bringing it to past
[1:32:58] but it comes back to that great spot
[1:33:01] in to where that were carriers
[1:33:04] of that word and so we stand here
[1:33:06] tonight and say that jesus christ
[1:33:09] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:13] now god is
[1:33:16] the interpreter of that right
[1:33:20] in other words god has got to interpret
[1:33:23] what does it mean that jesus christ is
[1:33:26] the same yesterday
[1:33:28] today and forever so let me just
[1:33:31] emphasize that point
[1:33:33] everything that spoken comes to pass
[1:33:37] by interpretation
[1:33:40] everything that's spoken god interprets
[1:33:44] by bringing it to pass therefore
[1:33:46] everything
[1:33:47] that's spoken must come to pass
[1:33:51] so yeah that's something that we can
[1:33:53] look for
[1:33:54] that we're anchored in that we can be
[1:33:57] sure of
[1:33:57] the things that god spoke will come to
[1:34:00] pass
[1:34:01] god does not speak philosophy
[1:34:07] he doesn't speak dogma
[1:34:10] he doesn't speak catechism when he
[1:34:14] speaks it comes to pass
[1:34:17] if he says let there be there will be
[1:34:21] he says let there be light though it
[1:34:23] took thousands of years whatever it took
[1:34:26] one day that light came to pass and we
[1:34:30] knew what the interpretation of let
[1:34:32] there be light
[1:34:33] because there was light and we could say
[1:34:37] this is light yes so we could stand back
[1:34:41] and say that
[1:34:43] scripture has come to pass
[1:34:48] and that is fulfilled
[1:34:51] so that that's how that we know it and
[1:34:54] and these are principles that we've got
[1:34:58] to anchor in our hearts
[1:35:00] if we're going to march forward and be
[1:35:02] that church that's prophesied
[1:35:05] if we're going to march forward and
[1:35:07] fulfill those things
[1:35:09] that are going to transpire in our day
[1:35:13] then we've got to understand the
[1:35:15] principles of battle
[1:35:17] right we've got to understand this is
[1:35:19] how the general works
[1:35:21] this is how this is his battle plan
[1:35:24] to this is this how the great the great
[1:35:27] warriors of the day the great things
[1:35:29] that george patton
[1:35:31] they said that the reason george patton
[1:35:33] was able to defeat rummel
[1:35:35] was because he read rumble's book
[1:35:39] he said i read your book i know that i
[1:35:42] know
[1:35:43] what you're going to do here he studied
[1:35:46] those great generals studied what the
[1:35:48] thinking was
[1:35:51] what the thinking was to behind
[1:35:54] the strategy and i don't like to use
[1:35:57] that word because god doesn't need a
[1:35:59] strategy
[1:36:00] but god's got a strategy we call that a
[1:36:04] plan god has a plan
[1:36:08] because that's what his desire is he's
[1:36:10] got a plan
[1:36:11] and the sooner that we understand his
[1:36:13] plan
[1:36:14] then the more comfortable that we can
[1:36:16] rest in it
[1:36:17] and then that's what god does he keeps
[1:36:20] bringing he
[1:36:21] interprets it by bringing it to pass so
[1:36:24] we if we know that then
[1:36:28] we don't try to create right
[1:36:31] anything in the meantime
[1:36:35] we actually see it transpire by
[1:36:38] revelation if then it becomes real to us
[1:36:42] so he said he's standing here at tonight
[1:36:45] and says that jesus christ is the same
[1:36:48] yesterday today and forever god is
[1:36:51] obligated
[1:36:52] to prove that to be
[1:36:55] so because it's
[1:36:59] his word amen he's obligated
[1:37:05] to bring it to pass he's obligated
[1:37:08] to interpret that to us
[1:37:13] now don't take that as a group don't
[1:37:16] take that as a doctrine
[1:37:18] if he spoke that to you i'm the same
[1:37:21] yesterday today and forever then he's
[1:37:25] obligated to you to interpret that
[1:37:29] to you and bring that to pass
[1:37:33] to you i can stand
[1:37:36] here today and say i want to know that
[1:37:39] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:37:42] and forever
[1:37:43] now sister saturn says spoke here today
[1:37:46] and
[1:37:47] they showed and spoke how that he's the
[1:37:49] same yesterday today and forever praise
[1:37:52] god
[1:37:53] she's had that experience
[1:37:57] but i want it
[1:38:02] okay we don't even want to even think
[1:38:04] that we want to use
[1:38:06] the word obligate but obligate just
[1:38:09] another word of faith
[1:38:12] that's good correct faith says i believe
[1:38:15] god's going to bring this to past
[1:38:17] i believe this is going to happen i
[1:38:20] believe that it's
[1:38:21] it's true and i'm looking for
[1:38:25] the interpretation
[1:38:29] i'm looking for it he's obligated
[1:38:32] okay and that's what he does he says
[1:38:36] because it's his word now
[1:38:40] what does it do it takes faith in
[1:38:42] believing it it
[1:38:44] takes faith in believing his word that
[1:38:46] it
[1:38:47] is the truth
[1:38:51] so just think really what faith is
[1:38:54] faith is just simply believing
[1:38:58] his word is the truth
[1:39:02] what he said is true i believe what he
[1:39:05] said is true
[1:39:06] i don't need an explanation i don't need
[1:39:09] to
[1:39:10] philosophical meaning behind it
[1:39:13] i don't need to know how it fits in the
[1:39:16] theology
[1:39:17] of our doctrine or our church i just
[1:39:20] need to know
[1:39:21] that god is going to take that word and
[1:39:24] interpret it to me personally by
[1:39:27] bringing it to pass
[1:39:29] and i'm looking for that because i
[1:39:31] believe it's
[1:39:32] true i'm looking for it
[1:39:36] because i believe it's true
[1:39:41] and so that what we're talking about
[1:39:44] carriers of the promise
[1:39:48] carriers of the promise people
[1:39:51] men that looked at it and believed it
[1:39:55] was true
[1:39:58] i think though one of the greatest
[1:40:00] examples that we go to
[1:40:02] is noah god
[1:40:05] told noah it was going to rain
[1:40:08] that there was going to be a flood
[1:40:12] and so this was spoken to noah so
[1:40:16] these great carriers of the promise
[1:40:20] is what god spoke of them
[1:40:23] and to them so god spoke it
[1:40:28] and now when god spoke it of them
[1:40:34] and to them they now became a
[1:40:37] carrier of the promise
[1:40:41] they were a carrier therefore they
[1:40:44] looked for it to come to pass
[1:40:49] because that that's what they did they
[1:40:51] had they believed
[1:40:53] it was true noah believed
[1:40:56] that it was going to rain and there was
[1:40:59] no scientific
[1:41:00] evidence it was going to rain there was
[1:41:03] no
[1:41:04] proof that it was going to rain there
[1:41:06] was no
[1:41:07] structure on the earth or no
[1:41:10] history that supported
[1:41:14] rain there was only one thing
[1:41:17] that supported rain is that god said so
[1:41:21] that it was his word and if god
[1:41:24] spoke it he's obligated
[1:41:28] to bring it to pass and he's obligated
[1:41:31] to
[1:41:32] know what the interpretation was so if i
[1:41:35] was in the days of noah can i believe i
[1:41:37] would be on the ark
[1:41:39] i might have been on the ark as a horse
[1:41:41] or something but i was gonna be there
[1:41:48] you know if noah came up and said it's
[1:41:51] going to rain
[1:41:52] what's what would be your first question
[1:41:55] what's rain yeah
[1:42:00] what you talking about right that's just
[1:42:03] like when you tell somebody
[1:42:05] what's the holy spirit
[1:42:10] that's what a lot of people should ask
[1:42:12] what's the holy ghost
[1:42:14] we'll get there gloria so what's rain
[1:42:18] so now you go so here's noah
[1:42:22] god spoke to noah now noah
[1:42:25] is a carrier of the promise
[1:42:29] amen he's got the promise
[1:42:33] he if i could say it this way he stuck
[1:42:36] with it
[1:42:38] amen and it stuck to him
[1:42:43] so he he's now a carrier of the promise
[1:42:47] he's got this
[1:42:48] in his heart he's got it in his soul
[1:42:52] he's got it in his being he hasn't seen
[1:42:55] it come to
[1:42:56] pass yet but he believes it's true
[1:42:59] so now he's a carrier of it
[1:43:03] he's carrying the load of it
[1:43:08] he's carrying the joy of it
[1:43:12] that he's becomes a carrier of the
[1:43:14] promise
[1:43:15] now the promise has rested in him
[1:43:18] and is set within his heart in seed form
[1:43:22] he's now a carrier of that promise he's
[1:43:25] a carrier of that word
[1:43:27] it's going to reign god's going to
[1:43:29] destroy this place
[1:43:32] that's right now this
[1:43:36] this is now beca becomes him
[1:43:40] because he's a carrier of
[1:43:44] that promise it it's sitting in his
[1:43:47] heart
[1:43:48] because he he believes it's true
[1:43:54] amen that that's what he believes he
[1:43:57] believes it's true
[1:43:59] so if he believes it's true he knows
[1:44:02] that god
[1:44:03] is obligated to bring it to path
[1:44:10] keep you can't have
[1:44:14] faith if you don't believe that god's
[1:44:16] obligated
[1:44:18] but you understand he had to carry that
[1:44:21] for
[1:44:21] a long time
[1:44:26] he had to carry that for for a very long
[1:44:29] time
[1:44:30] in his heart and you know can just think
[1:44:33] of that and may i say this
[1:44:35] the hour that we're living in this day
[1:44:37] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:44:39] to this day the evening lights have come
[1:44:43] and we failed to see it so we understand
[1:44:49] that we're carrying
[1:44:53] a promise yes sir
[1:44:56] it might seem to people
[1:44:59] that it's been a while come on preacher
[1:45:04] but not to god
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:08] because god if you go back to every
[1:45:11] place
[1:45:12] in the scripture every believer
[1:45:16] had a season of carrying the promise
[1:45:22] that was that's part of the obligation
[1:45:26] that's part of the birth experience
[1:45:30] that's part of what god looks for
[1:45:33] is carriers of the promise
[1:45:36] i'm carrying this promise i believe it's
[1:45:40] true i'm now a part of the plan of god
[1:45:43] the part of the plan of god was for his
[1:45:46] believers
[1:45:48] to carry the promise for a season
[1:45:55] it just it it it's beautiful
[1:45:58] because uh when you you go to see it so
[1:46:03] if you see that they're carriers they
[1:46:06] become
[1:46:06] carriers of the promise the product
[1:46:09] hasn't manifested yet
[1:46:13] the promise hasn't been interpreted yet
[1:46:17] but the first step in
[1:46:20] it coming to pass
[1:46:23] the first step in the transition of the
[1:46:27] interpretation
[1:46:28] there has to be a carrier of the promise
[1:46:32] to the fulfillment thereof
[1:46:35] somebody has to carry the promise to the
[1:46:38] fulfillment
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:43] like you have a potluck somebody's got
[1:46:47] to carry the food to the potluck
[1:46:49] before the potluck comes to pass
[1:46:54] you know what a potluck is right i know
[1:46:57] i say things and then people say what's
[1:46:59] a potluck
[1:47:00] a pot looked when you have a you can
[1:47:03] have a
[1:47:04] meal and everybody brings a dish
[1:47:08] and you just hope there's some lucky
[1:47:10] good tasting food
[1:47:11] in it so if that's why it got the
[1:47:14] terminology
[1:47:15] potluck you know and you hope that not
[1:47:17] everybody being
[1:47:19] bring beans and cornbread
[1:47:22] so if you understand somebody's got to
[1:47:24] carry the promise to its fulfillment
[1:47:29] that's the plan of god
[1:47:34] if i could say that that was the
[1:47:36] strategy
[1:47:37] of god to end
[1:47:41] it may be that way
[1:47:44] because that's the first thing that
[1:47:48] separates unbelief
[1:47:54] because their faith was only based
[1:47:57] on a man-made timetable
[1:48:02] it should come to pass by this day
[1:48:06] that's why men have always continually
[1:48:09] been trying to predict the time in the
[1:48:12] hour
[1:48:13] of this it'll be in this year it'll be
[1:48:15] on this date
[1:48:16] they'll go to this place they'll do this
[1:48:18] they'll get all these
[1:48:19] it you know okay and then on the other
[1:48:22] hand people are saying oh it's just
[1:48:24] another doomsday it's just another end
[1:48:26] of the world thing
[1:48:30] well the world today don't believe
[1:48:31] they're going to end
[1:48:35] they're jumping up and down because
[1:48:38] they think that future generations are
[1:48:41] going to go live on mars
[1:48:44] does anybody in here want to go live on
[1:48:46] mars
[1:48:48] no i'm looking for a new heaven and a
[1:48:51] new earth
[1:48:52] i'm looking for a great pyramid city i
[1:48:55] want to live in the city where the lamb
[1:48:57] is the light
[1:48:59] amen that's where i want to go that's
[1:49:01] what it's all about
[1:49:03] i believe it's true and i'm a carrier of
[1:49:07] the promise
[1:49:08] till it comes to pass
[1:49:15] we're carriers of the promise that's
[1:49:18] been the plan of god
[1:49:20] to be a carrier of the promise
[1:49:25] the holy ghost is the word
[1:49:29] of god in you
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:33] the holy ghost is
[1:49:37] what god has spoken
[1:49:40] of you and to you
[1:49:43] the word so
[1:49:46] in essence the word
[1:49:49] and the holy ghost are the same
[1:49:53] thing that's why satan wanted to bust
[1:49:56] them up into three parts
[1:49:58] the father the son the holy ghost why
[1:50:01] that'll confuse you to no end
[1:50:04] but when you know that jesus said i will
[1:50:06] not leave you
[1:50:08] nor first take you but i will come again
[1:50:12] i will send the comforter i the personal
[1:50:15] program is the same word
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:19] in you you know
[1:50:23] people misunderstand that you know
[1:50:27] the prophet of uh john the baptist
[1:50:31] he introduced jesus christ
[1:50:36] but he introduced the flesh
[1:50:40] you understand that's why he said behold
[1:50:44] the lamb of god
[1:50:47] that's what he introduced he introduced
[1:50:50] the word
[1:50:51] in flesh form
[1:50:54] because he was going to be a sacrifice
[1:50:57] for our sins
[1:50:58] the elijah in our day didn't introduce
[1:51:01] jesus christ in the flesh form
[1:51:03] he introduced them in the word form
[1:51:08] the same one that was here in the flesh
[1:51:11] is the same one that's here
[1:51:13] in his words or in his
[1:51:17] promises and if he
[1:51:20] promised you and he spoke to you and
[1:51:23] you're a carrier of that promise
[1:51:26] then you have the holy spirit the
[1:51:28] promise
[1:51:29] in you
[1:51:34] don't look at it from the standpoint of
[1:51:37] how moral you are
[1:51:39] because there's a lot of people who are
[1:51:41] more moral than you are
[1:51:43] and yet they'll believe that the pillar
[1:51:45] of fire
[1:51:46] and this vindicated messengers a bunch
[1:51:49] of nothing
[1:51:55] but it's a whole lot more i think than
[1:51:57] we realize
[1:52:00] it says the holy ghost is a word of god
[1:52:03] in you
[1:52:04] that identifies itself
[1:52:08] by accepting that word
[1:52:19] the spirit itself
[1:52:22] identifies itself in you by accepting
[1:52:26] the promise in other words you say i
[1:52:29] accept
[1:52:30] that i believe it's true now i am going
[1:52:33] to become
[1:52:34] a carrier of that
[1:52:38] not for a season we've had those that
[1:52:41] have ran out
[1:52:42] and have come to great fame anyway but
[1:52:45] they
[1:52:46] they didn't continue with us because
[1:52:48] they weren't
[1:52:50] of us
[1:52:54] they couldn't carry it to their reproach
[1:52:57] they couldn't carry it through the
[1:52:59] calendar as the years clipped off
[1:53:02] they couldn't carry it when they were
[1:53:04] questioned
[1:53:06] but if the spirit was there the spirit
[1:53:08] would identify itself in you
[1:53:11] by believing it that it's true
[1:53:19] they can look at you and say you're
[1:53:20] still sick yeah but i still am carrying
[1:53:22] the promise
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:30] i am not
[1:53:33] the producer i am the carrier
[1:53:41] a sheep doesn't produce wool he bears
[1:53:44] wool
[1:53:45] i just carry the promise well when's it
[1:53:48] come to pass i don't know
[1:53:50] i'm not called to bring it the path i'm
[1:53:53] called to carry it
[1:53:55] i'm a carrier of it
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:59] i'm packing the promise somebody's got a
[1:54:04] packet to its fulfillment
[1:54:06] somebody's got to carry it to the time
[1:54:08] to the hour that it comes to pass
[1:54:11] that's what i'm called to do i'm called
[1:54:13] to carry the promise
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:19] that's what noah did he carried the
[1:54:21] promise
[1:54:23] he did everything he was told to do and
[1:54:26] it still hadn't come to pass
[1:54:30] but one day
[1:54:34] he was in there and that door shut
[1:54:38] and he walked up there and sat on that
[1:54:41] top of that thing
[1:54:42] out there wherever he walked out the
[1:54:45] window and whatever
[1:54:46] how it was designed and then rain
[1:54:50] started coming
[1:54:51] he said oh this is rain
[1:54:55] god was obligated to show me rain
[1:54:58] i've carried the promise all these years
[1:55:02] and now today i can say this day
[1:55:06] this promise is fulfilled
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:12] i've carried it to its fulfillment thank
[1:55:15] you lord
[1:55:16] you've finally vindicated it you finally
[1:55:19] brought it to pass
[1:55:20] hallelujah this is rain this day
[1:55:26] amen this word
[1:55:29] this promise has been fulfilled
[1:55:33] in me
[1:55:38] moses the same thing
[1:55:43] carried the promise he said you bring
[1:55:46] these people back to the mountain
[1:55:49] i don't care what trouble he went
[1:55:51] through
[1:55:52] how much no pharaoh resisted him
[1:55:58] do you understand what what allowed him
[1:56:01] to go
[1:56:01] through the resistance was the fact
[1:56:05] that he was carrying a promise
[1:56:09] all pharaoh was trying to do was to
[1:56:12] separate him from what he was carrying
[1:56:17] i'll give you a way out you go over here
[1:56:20] in worship
[1:56:21] i'll give you a way out we'll do this
[1:56:24] we'll do that
[1:56:25] no he said no there's something that i'm
[1:56:28] carrying
[1:56:28] and the message that i'm carrying is let
[1:56:31] my people go
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:36] well let's cut a deal let me say this
[1:56:40] too many people
[1:56:42] and i don't want to say you or who
[1:56:46] but too many people got deals with the
[1:56:48] devil
[1:56:52] yes sir you don't got to make a deal
[1:56:55] with the devil
[1:56:59] you don't have to sit there and judge
[1:57:00] yourself you got to look at one thing
[1:57:03] inside of you the holy ghost is the word
[1:57:06] of god in you the holy ghost is the
[1:57:10] promise it that identifies
[1:57:13] itself by accepting
[1:57:16] that word it
[1:57:20] identifies itself by
[1:57:23] accepting the word and if i could say
[1:57:26] this way then that
[1:57:27] spirit becomes the carrier
[1:57:30] it's what's packing it in you it's the
[1:57:33] spirit of god
[1:57:34] in you what allows you to carry that
[1:57:38] word
[1:57:38] and carry that promise
[1:57:42] not sympathize with it
[1:57:46] but carry it not watch somebody else
[1:57:50] that's packing it
[1:57:51] and then say oh i agree with that
[1:57:53] brother
[1:57:54] what you're saying is true i agree with
[1:57:57] that i agree with that
[1:57:58] but i'll tell you it doesn't come
[1:58:00] personal until you are
[1:58:02] personally packing it and the holy
[1:58:04] spirit in you
[1:58:06] is identifying that you believe it's the
[1:58:09] truth
[1:58:10] and you're an expectation and
[1:58:12] anticipation
[1:58:13] and you are looking for the day of its
[1:58:16] interpretation
[1:58:18] because you know that god is obligated
[1:58:21] to you
[1:58:21] to bring it past to you personally
[1:58:25] to you
[1:58:30] moses the same way
[1:58:35] you look at joshua he was told
[1:58:40] that that walls of that city would come
[1:58:43] down and that they would possess
[1:58:47] the city and they would possess the land
[1:58:50] you know you can imagine i i've been to
[1:58:55] jericho there and to the river and
[1:58:57] wherever they come to
[1:58:58] pass and they say this is where this
[1:59:00] great city set and there's this great
[1:59:02] big line of mountains there that mossad
[1:59:04] and those places sit on
[1:59:06] and jericho sat right down there and you
[1:59:08] can look down the valley
[1:59:10] of that a long ways
[1:59:15] god told joshua that's coming down
[1:59:19] i don't care how many generals
[1:59:23] came to him and i'll guarantee you
[1:59:27] there was probably a hundred plans
[1:59:29] offered
[1:59:33] i'm sure one general says come let's use
[1:59:35] the cartel
[1:59:36] plan let's dig a tunnel
[1:59:40] underneath the wall you know i'm sure
[1:59:43] some guys said we could slingshot some
[1:59:45] guys over that
[1:59:46] and you know okay you look
[1:59:49] it seems ridiculous to you because you
[1:59:51] know the story
[1:59:54] but how would you like to just been in
[1:59:56] the spot of just being the carrier
[2:00:02] how would you like to been the guy that
[2:00:03] walked up there and said god spoke to me
[2:00:06] and told me this wall is coming down
[2:00:08] yeah how
[2:00:16] you better delete that off of youtube
[2:00:18] i'm sure
[2:00:19] i'll have a protest going
[2:00:24] how that wasn't
[2:00:28] in the plan
[2:00:32] i don't know how when
[2:00:36] i don't know when alls i know is when we
[2:00:39] go
[2:00:40] around that seven times and we blow the
[2:00:42] trumpets that
[2:00:43] that's coming down now
[2:00:46] i like the movie version of it
[2:00:51] you know but i don't know how many days
[2:00:53] it took
[2:00:54] that to come down it may have just
[2:00:58] started a little tremor you know what i
[2:01:02] mean
[2:01:02] but i know one thing i know god gave
[2:01:05] them a season to repent
[2:01:10] and he gives us a season to repent thank
[2:01:13] you
[2:01:13] lord and that's why when god tugs at
[2:01:16] your heart move quick
[2:01:20] don't wait accept it right then
[2:01:28] take it right then and start packing it
[2:01:31] start carrying it believe it's true
[2:01:37] and sure enough that's right
[2:01:40] around they went around they march
[2:01:43] i imagine about the third time around
[2:01:46] that big old city
[2:01:47] there's plenty of mumblers and grumblers
[2:01:49] saying this is ridiculous
[2:01:52] why don't we just
[2:01:56] go around it
[2:02:01] you know we go around a lot of things
[2:02:05] and they come back to bite us later
[2:02:09] if god wants you to confront something
[2:02:12] confront it
[2:02:16] you pack the promise of your deliverance
[2:02:19] right up into the face of that thing no
[2:02:22] matter how many times it badgers you
[2:02:25] how many times it gets you to fall how
[2:02:27] many times it stumbles you
[2:02:29] you say i'm packing the promise of my
[2:02:32] deliverance
[2:02:33] and one day this promise
[2:02:36] is going to be fulfilled in me because
[2:02:39] there's a spirit in me
[2:02:41] that identifies that's the truth and i'm
[2:02:44] holding on to that promise
[2:02:46] not by my flesh but by the spirit
[2:02:49] that's in me
[2:02:52] hallelujah
[2:02:53] [Applause]
[2:02:56] my flesh has failed me
[2:03:05] identifies that god's obligated
[2:03:09] as long as i pack that promise
[2:03:12] as long as i'm a carrier and i carry
[2:03:15] that promise to the
[2:03:17] hour and the day of its deliverance then
[2:03:20] i can say
[2:03:20] this day this promise is fulfilled in me
[2:03:30] john the baptist we could go on and on
[2:03:33] sure
[2:03:35] but every single one of them
[2:03:38] was a promise that had to be fulfilled
[2:03:44] that's the evidence of whether you
[2:03:46] believe or not
[2:03:49] if you're still packing it yes amen
[2:03:54] why would anybody want to lay down
[2:04:00] such a glorious promises
[2:04:06] because it's not meant to be fulfilled
[2:04:10] in their life
[2:04:13] but that's that's what a time-tested
[2:04:18] memorial is
[2:04:22] have you ever noticed nowadays
[2:04:25] that i get upset at my computer if it
[2:04:28] doesn't snap the answer right back
[2:04:32] and years ago i would run upstairs to
[2:04:35] encyclopedia and then i would call
[2:04:38] this person up and i'd call somebody up
[2:04:40] tell me about this
[2:04:42] and take me hours to research something
[2:04:45] right but now if it's not instant it's
[2:04:50] gone i'll just try something else
[2:04:56] i i don't like communicating with people
[2:04:59] through technology i'm kind of the guy
[2:05:02] likes to look you in the eye
[2:05:03] whether you're lying to me or not
[2:05:09] that's just the way i am i mean anybody
[2:05:12] can write lies
[2:05:14] i i you know i i had a prince call me
[2:05:17] from arabia the other day and and he's
[2:05:20] got
[2:05:20] millions of dollars in a trust fund he
[2:05:22] wants to get me some of it
[2:05:27] i just want to look that prince in the
[2:05:29] eye
[2:05:33] you know i mean
[2:05:37] you know i'd rather drive to a place to
[2:05:40] see if they
[2:05:41] have something then go online and
[2:05:45] see if it's in stock so everything's
[2:05:48] quick everything's instant
[2:05:50] everything's got to the place you
[2:05:52] understand satan
[2:05:53] is trying to create a society that
[2:05:56] nobody wants to carry
[2:05:58] anything you got a burden
[2:06:02] and your heart's heavy there might be a
[2:06:05] reason for your heart being heavy
[2:06:08] there might be a purpose that that you
[2:06:11] feel this weight
[2:06:12] that you feel this thing but people just
[2:06:14] want to run to a
[2:06:15] doctor and get a pill
[2:06:19] here take this and you won't have to
[2:06:21] carry anything
[2:06:24] that's what satan's saying that's right
[2:06:26] that's right take
[2:06:27] modern society take modern gospel
[2:06:32] you know let's just let down our
[2:06:33] barriers let's let's let down our bars
[2:06:36] let's let down our dress code let's let
[2:06:39] down our music code
[2:06:40] let me tell you something there's way
[2:06:42] too much rock and roll coming into
[2:06:44] church and you young musicians
[2:06:47] not magicians but musicians
[2:06:50] you might be magicians and putting out
[2:06:52] spirits that you don't know about but
[2:06:54] musicians you kind of watch the
[2:06:57] influence
[2:06:59] of of all this playing and
[2:07:02] and songs and where you're picking up
[2:07:05] your inspiration
[2:07:09] you know i sit back and i hear a song
[2:07:11] and i'm sitting back there wow
[2:07:14] didn't you know my mind's going back to
[2:07:18] some
[2:07:18] group that i heard in the 60s that
[2:07:21] played that tune
[2:07:23] just because you had the name jesus to
[2:07:26] it
[2:07:27] doesn't make it spiritual
[2:07:33] and let me tell you something just
[2:07:35] because you like the tune
[2:07:38] don't make it good satan is the author
[2:07:40] of beautiful music
[2:07:46] so there's so many things i call those
[2:07:49] catches
[2:07:50] remember what a one-man denomination is
[2:07:53] it's
[2:07:54] anybody that hews out their own place of
[2:07:57] the spirit
[2:08:00] and that what we've got to understand
[2:08:02] what we're called to do
[2:08:04] we're called to be carriers of the word
[2:08:07] of god
[2:08:09] not fulfillers
[2:08:12] but bringing it to its place that it's
[2:08:15] carried now let's
[2:08:16] look at what's spoken of us
[2:08:20] i i'm talking about other churches and
[2:08:23] other musicians
[2:08:30] don't want anybody mad at me
[2:08:36] this brother makes this statement
[2:08:39] and he's talking about we're talking
[2:08:41] about
[2:08:42] carriers of the promise do you
[2:08:44] understand that brother branham was a
[2:08:46] carrier of the promise
[2:08:48] yes right
[2:08:51] before it came to pass and before it
[2:08:54] identified itself
[2:08:56] he carried it he carried it when that
[2:08:58] angel appeared to him
[2:09:01] he carried it when that burning bush the
[2:09:04] pillar of fire came down in the burning
[2:09:06] bush that's really what that was
[2:09:08] it became a burning bush
[2:09:11] because it was exactly a type of an
[2:09:14] exodus
[2:09:16] yes
[2:09:18] so he meant that burning bush as john
[2:09:22] don't defile yourself in any way i have
[2:09:24] a work
[2:09:25] for you to do do you understand the
[2:09:28] minute that was spoken
[2:09:30] to him and of him
[2:09:33] he became a carrier
[2:09:37] wasn't fulfilled but he became a carrier
[2:09:42] so he he was living his life knowing
[2:09:45] that
[2:09:47] collecting bottles on the ohio river to
[2:09:50] give
[2:09:50] sell to his dad for bootleg all this
[2:09:53] time
[2:09:55] and all of them would say to him you
[2:09:58] come on bill have a drink be a man
[2:10:02] right but he's a carrier
[2:10:06] so he reaches out to get the bottle
[2:10:10] right but there's a spirit in him
[2:10:14] that's identifying itself
[2:10:18] that that word is true
[2:10:22] and all of a sudden he
[2:10:25] he breaks down balls and he don't know
[2:10:28] why
[2:10:32] he's out on a date i think brother
[2:10:34] branham uses the word date
[2:10:35] i'd like to know who the preachers were
[2:10:39] that got out here and preached
[2:10:42] against dating
[2:10:48] i don't know it's a
[2:10:52] it's a message dogma
[2:10:58] is all it is
[2:11:03] i'll save that for those who want to
[2:11:08] come
[2:11:11] just like all these guys who preach
[2:11:13] galleries are the word of god
[2:11:15] you want to give a dalerie that's fine
[2:11:18] but just make sure she loves you enough
[2:11:20] if you don't have one
[2:11:26] [Applause]
[2:11:28] i mean i'm saying it's time we move on
[2:11:35] but so you know we're
[2:11:39] we're we're looking so he has this
[2:11:42] burning bush
[2:11:43] experience and then he goes out and he
[2:11:45] wants to
[2:11:46] he and he's out on a date and and
[2:11:49] he says they're my sweetheart
[2:11:55] said bill this is a cigarette try one
[2:12:00] what did he say yeah i like to try one
[2:12:10] what was happening he was caring
[2:12:15] and the spirit was bringing it
[2:12:18] to pass
[2:12:22] all he was was a carrier
[2:12:26] so there's look at where we've moved up
[2:12:28] to
[2:12:30] now but in this day there is
[2:12:34] to come a super royal seed
[2:12:38] of abraham amen
[2:12:42] is anybody carrying that promise
[2:12:49] are you a carrier of that he said
[2:12:53] there's to be a
[2:12:54] super royal seed of abraham
[2:12:57] i looked in the mirror i don't see no
[2:13:00] super royal seed of abraham
[2:13:04] i see a man that's battling the flesh
[2:13:06] battling in the mind
[2:13:08] but i'm still a carrier of that promise
[2:13:13] amen yes sir i don't have to bring it to
[2:13:16] pass
[2:13:21] royal seed of abraham that's exactly
[2:13:25] what it be that's exactly
[2:13:31] what it would be or if you want to say
[2:13:34] will be that's exactly what it
[2:13:38] be would be a royal
[2:13:41] bride to the roiled
[2:13:45] promised son
[2:13:48] now that's the promise
[2:13:52] of our age you understand we're not
[2:13:56] called to pack pentecost
[2:13:59] we're not called to pack another promise
[2:14:02] of another age
[2:14:04] that's right he he gave a promise to you
[2:14:10] and something in you
[2:14:13] identified that promise to be true
[2:14:19] now now we become packers of that
[2:14:21] promise
[2:14:24] we carry that with us there's to be a
[2:14:27] royal seed of abraham
[2:14:29] there's to be a super church there's to
[2:14:32] be this great
[2:14:33] signs and wonders that follow this
[2:14:35] church we pack that
[2:14:37] to its fulfillment
[2:14:40] we're carriers
[2:14:43] we're carriers of that promise that's
[2:14:46] what that's what our existence is built
[2:14:48] on
[2:14:50] no matter how he tries to take it from
[2:14:52] us that's what proves we're the real
[2:14:54] children of god
[2:14:56] as i spoke last night it won't be a
[2:14:58] natural seed
[2:15:00] it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be
[2:15:03] a spiritual bride rise up
[2:15:07] which will be the royal seed
[2:15:10] of the royal faith of abraham's
[2:15:14] royal son
[2:15:18] she's to come on the scene
[2:15:22] in the last days and the time
[2:15:25] and the place is promised that's given
[2:15:29] to her
[2:15:33] when i believe now
[2:15:39] who gave the promise the lord jesus
[2:15:43] how did he deliver the promise through a
[2:15:46] god-inspired
[2:15:48] spirit-filled american deity filled
[2:15:52] messenger
[2:15:57] according to malachi 4 a
[2:16:00] scripture there is to rise a
[2:16:03] message that will shake the hearts
[2:16:07] of the people right back to the
[2:16:09] apostolic fathers again
[2:16:12] there is to rise one on the scene
[2:16:15] in the power of elijah
[2:16:19] that will rise on the scene a wilderness
[2:16:22] man
[2:16:23] that come out and will have a
[2:16:26] message that will run straight back to
[2:16:29] the word
[2:16:30] again that's the hour that we're living
[2:16:34] in
[2:16:34] this is what we're carrying amen
[2:16:39] praise the lord you understand it's got
[2:16:42] to be
[2:16:42] carried first
[2:16:46] he's got he gets the promise out now i
[2:16:49] gave all these men in the bible i could
[2:16:51] have went into great detail
[2:16:53] on all these different men in the bible
[2:16:55] but i think that you understand
[2:16:57] they all receive the promise and they
[2:16:59] carried it for years
[2:17:01] [Music]
[2:17:05] they were they had to be a carrier a
[2:17:08] proven
[2:17:09] carrier until that god
[2:17:12] could trust them amen
[2:17:16] that's good to prove them
[2:17:21] that they're true how do you believe it
[2:17:26] look at mary
[2:17:29] a virgin shall conceive look
[2:17:32] which she was asked to pack
[2:17:36] i don't know the days and the time
[2:17:39] and the month that went by you know
[2:17:42] the bible doesn't fill in
[2:17:46] all the years that it takes
[2:17:51] but there is a lot of time from the time
[2:17:53] that
[2:17:54] that angel spoke to brother branham when
[2:17:57] he packed that
[2:17:59] water to when it come to pass
[2:18:06] there's a lot of time to the ohio river
[2:18:11] there's a lot of story in between
[2:18:14] but no matter what the story was what
[2:18:17] they were carrying
[2:18:19] was held in them by the spirit of god
[2:18:23] amen
[2:18:24] wasn't held in by your mind it's held
[2:18:27] in you by the spirit that identifies
[2:18:31] itself by saying that's the word
[2:18:35] and so we're carrying that
[2:18:38] we've been carrying that we had to be
[2:18:41] carriers first
[2:18:45] it's got to be carried to the time it's
[2:18:48] fulfillment
[2:18:49] joshua carried that as i was with moses
[2:18:52] i'll be with you he carried that all
[2:18:55] those things through all those battles
[2:18:57] to that river to where they overcome to
[2:19:00] the departing of the inheritance
[2:19:03] joshua and caleb carried their
[2:19:06] inheritance the places that they were
[2:19:08] gonna live
[2:19:09] they carried it through all the testing
[2:19:11] through all the trial
[2:19:12] carrying the promise is part of the
[2:19:18] birth
[2:19:20] you don't got no mental reason to
[2:19:22] believe
[2:19:24] that's right because god don't ask you
[2:19:27] to believe
[2:19:27] anything you can conceive mentally
[2:19:31] wouldn't be faith
[2:19:39] we're just become great carriers
[2:19:44] we're packers abraham was
[2:19:47] waiting day by day
[2:19:51] for almost an impossible thing
[2:19:54] to happen
[2:19:59] sarah 90 in him a hundred
[2:20:03] according to the promise of god he was
[2:20:06] still waiting
[2:20:07] in the midst of all the criticism he was
[2:20:10] still
[2:20:11] waiting for that son
[2:20:16] what was he doing he was waiting because
[2:20:19] he was carrying
[2:20:22] if you get rid of the burden you get rid
[2:20:25] of the load
[2:20:26] you don't have to worry where it's
[2:20:27] taking you
[2:20:31] don't give up
[2:20:38] you know this old saying we had in our
[2:20:41] my coach in football he and even when
[2:20:44] the
[2:20:44] guys weren't physically capable
[2:20:48] of doing the assignment
[2:20:51] you know i i i think i've weighed a
[2:20:55] 155 pounds something in high school
[2:20:59] and we had an all-pro tackle
[2:21:02] on our high school team went on to be
[2:21:04] all pro and the coach would put me out
[2:21:06] there to block this guy
[2:21:12] his name was pete m's and and he'd come
[2:21:14] running across that line
[2:21:16] and he'd clean my cloth
[2:21:22] and coach would pick me up off the
[2:21:24] ground and say
[2:21:26] you're not a loser until you quit trying
[2:21:32] so i got my clock cleaned all season
[2:21:34] long
[2:21:37] but i wasn't a loser
[2:21:42] don't let satan unpack you
[2:21:46] that's right
[2:21:56] so is the true believer still
[2:21:59] waiting for the promise son
[2:22:02] let me read it in my context so is the
[2:22:05] true believer still
[2:22:07] carrying the promise
[2:22:12] son to return notice
[2:22:16] just before the son arrived there was a
[2:22:19] sign
[2:22:19] given him is not the sign
[2:22:23] of the coming son to be revealed
[2:22:26] to the royal seed of abraham that's
[2:22:30] carrying the promise for the royal son
[2:22:35] as brother abraham says it is not the
[2:22:38] sign of the coming sun to be revealed
[2:22:41] to the royal seed of abraham that's
[2:22:44] waiting
[2:22:45] for the royal son the same
[2:22:48] as it was to father abraham
[2:22:51] for a natural son that's right
[2:22:55] jesus said so there is
[2:22:58] in saint luke 17 30
[2:23:01] before this time come that the son of
[2:23:05] man
[2:23:06] would be revealed like he did
[2:23:09] in the days of sodom before the
[2:23:11] destruction
[2:23:12] of sodom we're looking for
[2:23:16] that sign now we've seen that sign
[2:23:22] you understand so when he's preaching
[2:23:24] this he's trying to point out to him
[2:23:26] that's why i'm not preaching this day
[2:23:28] this scripture is fulfilled
[2:23:30] because it has been fulfilled
[2:23:33] but in the fulfilling of it
[2:23:37] i'm going to read a statement that maybe
[2:23:39] you could help see
[2:23:40] what i'm trying to say in the
[2:23:42] fulfillment of that scripture
[2:23:45] and the fulfillment of that promise
[2:23:48] there is a promise that's given to the
[2:23:52] royal seed of abraham
[2:23:54] that they carry it till its fulfillment
[2:24:01] because everybody's that's ever been in
[2:24:04] the scripture
[2:24:06] had to carry the promise
[2:24:09] then we'll try to close with these
[2:24:12] few statements
[2:24:15] so abraham is carrying this promise
[2:24:19] of the son is that right
[2:24:23] for years then one day
[2:24:29] elohim walks into the camp
[2:24:34] he's been carrying the promise but
[2:24:38] now elohim
[2:24:41] has to come
[2:24:44] god in flesh really what
[2:24:47] he was he reached out there
[2:24:50] grabbed some ash cosmic ash blew himself
[2:24:54] a body
[2:24:55] something that abraham could see it sat
[2:24:58] there
[2:24:59] and he'd give abraham a sign so now
[2:25:02] this is what he said he said
[2:25:06] now he had never seen her he's talking
[2:25:09] about
[2:25:10] sarah behind him he said why did sarah
[2:25:14] your wife laugh
[2:25:15] abraham said she's in the he says
[2:25:17] where's
[2:25:19] abraham where's
[2:25:22] is your wife sarah abraham said she's in
[2:25:26] the tent behind you
[2:25:27] now he had never seen her how did he
[2:25:30] know that his name
[2:25:32] was abraham how did he know her name
[2:25:35] was sarah abraham where is your wife
[2:25:38] sarah
[2:25:39] she's in the tent behind you he said i
[2:25:43] personal program pronoun i am going
[2:25:46] to visit you according to the promise
[2:25:52] in other words i am going to visit
[2:25:56] what you are carrying
[2:26:00] so if you're carrying a promise
[2:26:04] if you're carrying a word he has a time
[2:26:09] of visitation for that word
[2:26:13] that's right our sister i i just think
[2:26:16] that's just beautiful
[2:26:18] it inspired me but she
[2:26:21] she had the headache and and and
[2:26:24] you know you don't i imagine sister mary
[2:26:28] by the time you got done diagnosing that
[2:26:31] you had a brain tumor
[2:26:35] you were in the early stages of
[2:26:36] alzheimer's
[2:26:38] you felt for sure you were suffering
[2:26:40] dementia
[2:26:42] you were losing it the word was
[2:26:46] delirious
[2:26:51] but she had a time of visitation
[2:26:59] and she had to pack
[2:27:02] carry that promise
[2:27:07] for a season until the time
[2:27:10] of visitation brother branham taught
[2:27:12] that
[2:27:13] over and over and over
[2:27:16] and over and over again
[2:27:20] don't quit
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:29] you don't have to go get another promise
[2:27:33] just carry the one you've got
[2:27:45] he said i personal program i'm going to
[2:27:49] visit you according to the promise
[2:27:52] your wife is going to have that
[2:27:55] baby you've trusted
[2:27:59] me
[2:28:02] in other words you carried this promise
[2:28:06] all this time
[2:28:09] just think of it a little lamborghini
[2:28:11] you just carry it
[2:28:13] you believe it you hold on to it
[2:28:17] amen
[2:28:20] you got a call in your life to preach
[2:28:22] you got to call in your life you want to
[2:28:24] do
[2:28:25] do the work of the lord you want to know
[2:28:27] what happens you start
[2:28:28] carrying that
[2:28:33] you carry the burden
[2:28:37] too many people just run out and do
[2:28:39] something
[2:28:40] [Music]
[2:28:42] and they think that satisfies it
[2:28:47] and then it goes away because they made
[2:28:50] their own man-made nomination
[2:28:54] on how to bring it to pass
[2:28:57] listen to what he says
[2:29:02] you trusted me now me
[2:29:06] now i'm going to make
[2:29:09] it come to
[2:29:12] pass now i am going
[2:29:16] to make it come to pass you trusted me
[2:29:20] you carried the promise through all
[2:29:22] kinds of criticism
[2:29:23] through all kinds of doubt through all
[2:29:25] kinds of hardship now
[2:29:27] i have come and i
[2:29:30] am going to make it come to pass
[2:29:34] your part is just to carry it to the
[2:29:37] time
[2:29:38] of fulfillment and then you can say
[2:29:41] this day this promise is fulfilled in me
[2:29:52] every time i take a pill every time i
[2:29:54] have to deal with a problem in my flesh
[2:29:59] my deliverance is coming
[2:30:09] there may be no evidence on the outside
[2:30:13] but there's a spirit on the inside
[2:30:19] that's carrying that promise
[2:30:23] that's holding on to that promise it
[2:30:26] won't let anybody take it from me
[2:30:30] it won't even let me take it from me
[2:30:38] oh i remember the time that
[2:30:42] me and leslie we were done
[2:30:47] we had been hurt so deep and so bad we
[2:30:50] just
[2:30:51] we just given it up
[2:30:56] and i was i had made plans and had it
[2:31:00] all set up
[2:31:02] i was gonna move to police
[2:31:05] my dad had a big generator thing going i
[2:31:07] was gonna go down there
[2:31:08] i was gonna take it over and i was gonna
[2:31:11] retire and i got up from the church and
[2:31:13] i think
[2:31:14] i said i just think i'll retire
[2:31:17] you know i can't do it
[2:31:22] and big daniel memphis came
[2:31:26] to me and said brother david don't
[2:31:28] retire
[2:31:30] please don't retire
[2:31:36] you know and
[2:31:41] that struck something on the side of me
[2:31:46] i wanted to be done with it
[2:31:52] and you know a lot of it's because
[2:31:53] nobody understands but you know he
[2:31:55] understands
[2:31:57] and and so you can't even get away from
[2:32:01] it
[2:32:02] he'll bring it to pass i've come
[2:32:05] to bring it to pass
[2:32:09] now if i could say this to you this
[2:32:11] morning
[2:32:12] in in closing that royal seed of abraham
[2:32:19] and hear that royal seed of abraham
[2:32:23] which come because of that
[2:32:27] identification of that man
[2:32:31] sitting there with abraham come
[2:32:34] to prove it was the same god
[2:32:40] promised in this day as it was in the
[2:32:43] days of sodom
[2:32:44] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[2:32:47] of man
[2:32:48] when he reveals himself as son of man
[2:32:52] this day this scripture is to be
[2:32:54] fulfilled
[2:32:56] now you understand abraham
[2:32:59] carried that promise
[2:33:02] but that promise came to pass
[2:33:06] because of the man that was sitting
[2:33:10] there
[2:33:10] with him
[2:33:14] do you understand because that man came
[2:33:18] in that ministry
[2:33:21] that's what proved to abraham that the
[2:33:25] time of his visitation was near
[2:33:28] and that the promise was going to come
[2:33:30] to pass
[2:33:31] i don't know how long it was until he
[2:33:33] had the baby from that time
[2:33:38] but because that ministry
[2:33:43] and that man sat in front of him
[2:33:47] and gave him the promise it was because
[2:33:50] of who was sitting there
[2:33:52] that brought it to pass
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:34:00] now we've seen he's who sat in front of
[2:34:02] us
[2:34:06] we've seen him turn his back to the
[2:34:08] audience
[2:34:10] we see him lay out the church ages he
[2:34:13] used charles larkin's historic
[2:34:15] but he placed every messenger he placed
[2:34:18] every spirit
[2:34:23] i never he filled in
[2:34:26] the blanks that's what he said he was to
[2:34:30] do
[2:34:30] was to fill in the blanks tie the loose
[2:34:33] ends
[2:34:34] and everybody gets all oh that was he
[2:34:36] took that loose end
[2:34:38] yeah that's what he took he took a loose
[2:34:41] end
[2:34:43] things that people said that were left
[2:34:46] out there left people hanging out there
[2:34:50] on the things he said had to take what
[2:34:53] they said
[2:34:54] run it back through the word tie the
[2:34:56] knot
[2:34:57] so you can move on else you'd be sitting
[2:35:01] in front of
[2:35:01] all kinds of half statements
[2:35:05] three-quarter truths truths misplaced
[2:35:10] trying to put the puzzle together
[2:35:12] [Music]
[2:35:14] did he quote other men sure because
[2:35:17] other men
[2:35:18] said things that need to be straightened
[2:35:21] up
[2:35:25] letter ram did not invent this message
[2:35:28] he did not make up this message he was a
[2:35:32] carrier
[2:35:38] he carried the message
[2:35:41] and when he carried the message he said
[2:35:43] you know i'm waiting for something
[2:35:47] you know i'm waiting for someone to come
[2:35:50] and make it happen you know i'm waiting
[2:35:53] for someone
[2:35:54] i carried the message father if i've
[2:35:56] done anything wrong if i said anything
[2:35:58] that's not true
[2:35:59] you forgive me but you told me i
[2:36:02] believed it
[2:36:03] i'm carrying it i'm standing here
[2:36:07] in washington d.c
[2:36:12] i believe richard nixon was at that
[2:36:14] meeting congress metro's that meeting
[2:36:17] many great politicians were thing at
[2:36:19] that meeting washington d.c
[2:36:22] and he said he's here
[2:36:27] he's here to bring to pass what i've
[2:36:30] been carrying
[2:36:32] the one that sat in front of abraham
[2:36:36] they made it happen is here to bring it
[2:36:39] to pass
[2:36:40] he's here and i say this when he said
[2:36:44] that
[2:36:44] in washington d.c it's still the
[2:36:47] washington dc
[2:36:48] today he said i take every spirit
[2:36:52] in this place in my control in the name
[2:36:55] of jesus christ
[2:36:57] and he still got the control of
[2:37:00] all the spirits that are coming out of
[2:37:02] there
[2:37:15] it's fulfilled
[2:37:22] abraham was a carrier and then he came
[2:37:26] to bring it
[2:37:27] pass and i could say this
[2:37:31] in closing the inspiration
[2:37:34] that struck me
[2:37:38] he says the same gospel
[2:37:41] the same power and the same son of man
[2:37:46] that was yesterday is today
[2:37:50] and will be forever
[2:37:54] the promise was given we've been
[2:37:57] carrying
[2:37:58] carrying it but the same son of man
[2:38:01] that sat in front of abraham
[2:38:05] and said i've come to carry it to pass
[2:38:07] is the same
[2:38:08] son of man that's here
[2:38:13] to bring to pass what you've been
[2:38:16] carrying
[2:38:23] the same son of man that was yesterday
[2:38:28] in washington dc in 1965
[2:38:32] in 1940
[2:38:36] back at the woman at the well back at
[2:38:38] abraham
[2:38:40] that same son of man
[2:38:44] is today and will be forever hebrews 13
[2:38:47] 8
[2:38:48] do you believe it
[2:38:51] are you carrying that yes then i
[2:38:55] ask you i cannot be
[2:38:58] him but he is here
[2:39:02] we are only a
[2:39:08] carrier
[2:39:11] so we're going to forward
[2:39:16] there's a church that's being birthed
[2:39:19] and god's given us little
[2:39:21] signs of it testimonies things
[2:39:24] there's things that you've got to
[2:39:26] realize that
[2:39:28] if you've been carrying a promise if
[2:39:30] you've been carrying a burden
[2:39:33] we know because of what has happened in
[2:39:36] our generation
[2:39:38] that the time of our visitation is near
[2:39:43] he will come to carry
[2:39:46] and bring to pass what you've been
[2:39:50] carrying
[2:39:52] now if you're not carrying a promise
[2:39:55] read the book because we are partakers
[2:40:00] of divine nature
[2:40:01] by these great and precious promises
[2:40:04] we are partakers of divine nature i
[2:40:07] think that's first peter 3 i'm not sure
[2:40:09] 4. chapter 1
[2:40:13] partakers of divine nature
[2:40:18] they carried what was spoken
[2:40:21] to them and of
[2:40:24] them what's spoken to you
[2:40:30] what was spoken of you if you're
[2:40:34] here this morning and you're even
[2:40:36] associated
[2:40:37] with the gospel at all you know that
[2:40:40] jesus christ preached a church
[2:40:44] that would be overcomers
[2:40:50] that would stop the satan at every one
[2:40:52] of his tricks
[2:40:54] that they'd be an invincible army that
[2:40:57] they'd be a shining light
[2:40:59] that they would be a bride a royal bride
[2:41:02] for the royal son
[2:41:06] that's what's spoken of them
[2:41:10] and what's been spoken to them i can
[2:41:12] only speak for me
[2:41:17] and i can only testify i'm not
[2:41:20] testifying of its fulfillment
[2:41:23] because i know there's still a lot to be
[2:41:25] fulfilled
[2:41:26] but i can testify that i'm carrying
[2:41:31] in me a promise of deliverance
[2:41:36] a promise of meeting a son a promise of
[2:41:40] a new city
[2:41:42] a promise of victory
[2:41:46] a promise to lay hands on the sick and
[2:41:49] they'll recover
[2:41:50] amen and i believe that can be fulfilled
[2:41:54] over and over again
[2:41:56] in our lives there's something
[2:41:59] inside of me that holds that promise
[2:42:03] and i'm going to carry that
[2:42:07] to its fulfillment
[2:42:11] do you believe that this morning
[2:42:15] i'll just ask brother billy to come and
[2:42:18] we'll worship
[2:42:19] a moment this morning and if anybody
[2:42:22] here would like to
[2:42:24] be prayed for maybe in your you've been
[2:42:28] have a burden or you have a desire
[2:42:33] but along with that burden you've got to
[2:42:37] attach a promise
[2:42:40] to that burden and you've got to carry
[2:42:43] that burden
[2:42:44] to its fulfillment noah had to do it
[2:42:49] moses had to do it john the baptist had
[2:42:52] to sit there and preach
[2:42:54] the coming of the lord there's one
[2:42:57] walking in your midst
[2:42:59] and one day here he come he said behold
[2:43:02] the lamb of god
[2:43:04] this day what i've preached and what
[2:43:07] i've carried
[2:43:08] has come to pass are you carrying
[2:43:11] something in your heart
[2:43:13] are you rebelling within yourself
[2:43:16] against yourself
[2:43:19] you know a lot of times people don't
[2:43:21] understand teenagers
[2:43:23] you know god starts dealing with the
[2:43:25] teenager when about 13 14 years old
[2:43:29] he starts convicting him and now the
[2:43:32] rebellion isn't because of rebellion
[2:43:34] against you as parents
[2:43:36] against you the rebellions against
[2:43:39] themselves
[2:43:41] and what god's dealing with them on the
[2:43:44] inside and it's against all the people
[2:43:46] and all the things everybody else is
[2:43:48] doing and
[2:43:49] and all the carrying on and and
[2:43:53] because they don't know
[2:43:56] that it's still going on with them
[2:44:01] they don't understand it that's why they
[2:44:03] form these little clicks and they do
[2:44:05] these little things together and
[2:44:07] you know they get not guess brother
[2:44:09] brown calls
[2:44:10] nickel pricks or something like that i
[2:44:12] don't know how he uses the word
[2:44:14] but it's because something's happening
[2:44:16] on the inside
[2:44:19] and you think that's going to go away
[2:44:22] you watch people that don't get
[2:44:24] converted and then all that rebellion
[2:44:26] they've had they sit behind a jail cell
[2:44:28] someday
[2:44:30] and they can't run from it anymore
[2:44:34] and then they have to come face to face
[2:44:37] and they'll find out it was there all
[2:44:39] the time
[2:44:40] you ever hear that zone he was there all
[2:44:42] the time
[2:44:44] amen he's there all the time
[2:44:49] if you're carrying it
[2:44:52] and you've been faithful in carrying it
[2:44:56] that same son of man is going to come by
[2:44:58] your house
[2:45:00] someday and he says i'm here
[2:45:04] [Music]
[2:45:07] i'm here to make it come to pass
[2:45:14] you you'll say lord i tried to make it
[2:45:16] come to pass
[2:45:19] no all i wanted you to do is carry it
[2:45:23] all i wanted you to trust me no matter
[2:45:26] how long it took
[2:45:28] how long you wanted the holy ghost

[2:45:33] how long you're discouraged at yourself
[2:45:35] that you failed
[2:45:38] over and over again and you kept getting
[2:45:41] up
[2:45:42] [Music]
[2:45:44] but just something in you just said i

[3:05:22] young sister in her heart and we're

[3:05:30] to move
[3:05:32] and if you give your heart to the lord
[3:05:35] early it saves
[3:05:36] you and god a lot of trouble hallelujah

[3:05:54] you can't avoid the mighty handle
[3:05:57] and i say thank you jesus amen
[3:06:02] let us read in the scriptures therefore
[3:06:04] let all the house of israel know
[3:06:06] assuredly that god hath made
[3:06:10] the same jesus ye
[3:06:13] have crucified both lord and christ
[3:06:17] and when when they heard this they were
[3:06:20] pricked in their heart
[3:06:21] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[3:06:24] apostles
[3:06:25] men and brethren what shall we do
[3:06:28] therefore peter said unto them repent
[3:06:32] and be baptized every one of you in the
[3:06:34] name of jesus christ for the remission
[3:06:36] of sins
[3:06:38] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[3:06:40] holy ghost for this promise is unto you
[3:06:44] and to your children and to all that are
[3:06:46] far off
[3:06:47] even as many as our lord our god shall
[3:06:50] call
[3:06:51] with many other words did they testify
[3:06:54] and exhort saying
[3:06:55] save yourself from this up towards
[3:06:57] generation
[3:07:00] amen you know what's up it's a humbling
[3:07:03] thing
[3:07:03] to be baptized it's something that
[3:07:07] when you get older it's harder and
[3:07:11] it's hard you have a tendency to resist
[3:07:14] but i'll tell you for every
[3:07:18] promised word the blessings that follow
[3:07:22] are worth all the birth pains
[3:07:26] and all the trouble and so i know that
[3:07:28] hannah put a lot of prayer into this
[3:07:31] she put a lot of thought in this she
[3:07:33] pondered it
[3:07:35] for a long time until she couldn't
[3:07:38] wait any longer and so we're here today
[3:07:41] to fulfill her heart's desire
[3:07:44] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[3:07:46] jesus christ
[3:07:49] sister hannah jesus
[3:07:54] spoke to his disciples and commissioned
[3:07:56] them to go into all the world
[3:07:58] and baptize them in one name the name of
[3:08:02] the father
[3:08:02] the son and the holy ghost and
[3:08:06] peter with the keys to the kingdom and a
[3:08:09] divine revelation of what that name was
[3:08:12] he baptized in the name of the lord
[3:08:14] jesus christ
[3:08:16] and today hannah we fulfill the word of
