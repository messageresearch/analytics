[2:28] everyone in the house of God and may be
[2:30] seated as you invite Brother David at
[2:32] this time
[2:42] amener good evening tonight I just um I
[2:46] felt to as we leave this Mark on our
[2:51] calendars and we we start to move
[2:54] forward into
[2:57] um uh 20 uh
[3:01] 25 uh we realize that the scripture
[3:04] tells us that we're living in perilous
[3:07] times and there's uh and the deception
[3:11] this is the greatest age of deceptions
[3:15] there ever been and also we realize that
[3:21] modernism is is begin to flood into the
[3:26] church and
[3:28] uh uh and the the standard of what
[3:34] Christianity was has become more obscure
[3:38] and more
[3:39] obscure and as the church becomes more
[3:43] modern and nowadays most uh church is
[3:48] almost a concert if uh if you would to
[3:52] go uh and be on the Internet or online
[3:56] or watch a a television program or
[3:58] something uh from one of the churches
[4:01] it's mostly about singing and and and
[4:05] then at the end of the singing the
[4:07] preacher come up and make a few comments
[4:09] or a few jokes and then it's back to the
[4:12] concert I like to play about 40 minutes
[4:16] this evening at right at the start of
[4:19] our service and then after we listen to
[4:21] this then we'll have song service
[4:25] testimony and everything but uh if I I
[4:29] would
[4:30] one of the
[4:32] subtitles to the the tape that we're
[4:35] going to listen to it is the deceived
[4:38] Church by the
[4:40] world and uh and then a subtitle which
[4:45] is uh kind of correlates with it is uh
[4:51] why the church has lost its power and
[4:55] how to get it back and so uh we're not
[4:58] going to start with all the scriptures
[5:01] and the introductory but we're just
[5:03] going to start where brother Brandon
[5:05] picks up his sermon and and a lot of
[5:08] what that
[5:09] we're wanting to do is to in our
[5:13] thinking and in our life reestablish the
[5:18] dedication and and reestablish the
[5:22] sincerity and reestablish and that's a
[5:25] lot of times what you do at this time of
[5:28] year you take the time to reestablish
[5:31] you know what I mean uh you know a lot
[5:33] of people go on their January diet you
[5:36] know what I mean or they they they do
[5:39] their their January at the health club
[5:41] or or whatever because they try to
[5:44] reestablish but they can't keep it going
[5:47] but I really think that you'll
[5:49] enjoy listening to this and uh I can
[5:54] just tell you it's straight it's
[5:57] straightforward it's uh it it's
[6:00] down to some of the very deepest ABCs
[6:04] that the prophet of God believed and
[6:07] it's a part of our foundation so what
[6:11] we're going to listen to is what this
[6:13] message was built on it was the heart
[6:17] and the mind and the dedication of a
[6:21] prophet towards the things of God so as
[6:24] we we'll just listen to this for 40
[6:27] minutes then brother Billy will lead us
[6:29] in songs and specials testimony then
[6:32] we'll have communion and probably be uh
[6:35] out by 12:30 1:00 so if you get real
[6:41] tired just go ahead and yawn and stretch
[6:44] but let's just enjoy the evening so I'd
[6:47] like to end this year and start this
[6:49] service with the voice of our messenger
[6:52] so God bless you as we listen to our
[6:55] prophet
[7:00] Samson great deal likeed the
[7:03] church started off
[7:06] right he started off in the right
[7:11] direction he started off and was called
[7:14] a mighty man of
[7:18] veiler he started out serving the lord
[7:22] in keeping his words and doing his
[7:27] Commandments and that was somewhat like
[7:30] the
[7:31] church it started off on as we would say
[7:35] as a world expression started on the
[7:38] right
[7:40] foot started to keep the Commandments of
[7:44] the Lord and as long as Samson followed
[7:48] the Lord the Lord you
[7:53] Samson for God can keep anyone and use
[7:58] anyone that will follow after
[8:03] him for it's God's
[8:07] business but when we turn to a side away
[8:11] from the things of God then God cannot
[8:14] use us any
[8:17] longer when we'll walk steadfastly after
[8:20] the Commandments of
[8:23] God when we'll stay in the pages of the
[8:26] Bible and worship by the written WR
[8:30] Word Worship Him in the spirit and in
[8:33] the truth of the word then God can use
[8:37] any
[8:38] individual but when they take a notion
[8:41] to turn aside after something else then
[8:44] God cannot use that person any
[8:49] longer so Samson makes a a a very
[8:55] outstanding representation of the Church
[8:58] of today day when the church started God
[9:02] could use the church for the church
[9:05] walked diligently after the Commandments
[9:09] of the
[9:10] Lord kept all of his judgments and his
[9:14] statutes and done all of his
[9:16] Commandments and God was with the
[9:21] church but it seems to be
[9:24] that there is such a weakening place
[9:28] amongst the church
[9:30] Church remember we are not on a
[9:35] picnic but we are in a
[9:41] battlefield many people just think that
[9:44] when they become a Christian that that's
[9:47] all they need to
[9:50] do that that settles it
[9:54] forever if they are a Christian then
[9:56] everything's going to come easy
[9:59] don't never get that in your
[10:02] hand for I become a Christian to
[10:07] fight fight the good fight of
[10:12] faith I become a Christian to get in the
[10:16] battle
[10:18] lines we are Christian
[10:24] Soldiers and we've got to be
[10:28] trained and brought
[10:30] up and know all the technques of the
[10:35] enemy to know how to fortified to know
[10:38] how to to fight the
[10:41] fight and we can only do that as a holy
[10:46] spirit will reveal it to
[10:49] us we cannot take what some other Nation
[10:52] tells us when we go to war some of their
[10:56] ideas but we got to take
[10:59] our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit
[11:03] would direct us and what ideas he would
[11:06] give us because he is the Commander in
[11:09] Chief of the army of the Christians
[11:12] prise
[11:15] God Samson did good he was a great
[11:21] man until he begin to begin to kind of
[11:27] we would call it SC wag
[11:30] around until he began to get off of his
[11:34] own
[11:37] territory and the church did run
[11:41] well and was all right until they begin
[11:44] to get off of their
[11:51] territory Samson begin to
[11:56] flirt and he was not flirting with
[11:59] Israel Li his girls he begin to Ft with
[12:04] aistin
[12:07] girls and that's somewhat similar to
[12:10] what the church
[12:15] did it never began to make love with its
[12:20] own it got off after
[12:23] unbelievers and begin to flirt with
[12:26] unbelievers
[12:33] that's where we made our great and one
[12:36] of the greatest
[12:40] mistakes as when the church begin to do
[12:44] things that wasn't right it begin to
[12:46] keep like Samson Bad
[12:53] Company Samson as long as he was in the
[12:56] company of the Lord's people he did all
[13:01] right but when he got to flirting with
[13:05] Bad
[13:06] Company then he got in
[13:10] trouble and that's the way it is with
[13:12] the
[13:13] church when the church followed
[13:16] reverently and daily after the leading
[13:19] of the Holy
[13:22] Spirit God blessed them and miracles and
[13:26] signs and wonders followed the the
[13:30] church but when he begin to keep Bad
[13:33] Company with the
[13:37] world one of the worst things that done
[13:40] and the first things that done it begin
[13:42] to
[13:44] organize breaking up
[13:46] Fellowship amongst other
[13:49] believers because it found out that
[13:52] nations were
[13:55] organized but this great gospel is is
[13:59] not dedicated to One Nation or one
[14:02] people it's dedicated to whosoever will
[14:06] let him come all nations kindreds
[14:10] tongues and
[14:12] people God never did intend for us to
[14:15] draw boundary
[14:19] lines but man wanted to be
[14:22] like they compare or to copy
[14:27] after go like the the world does say the
[14:31] things that they do make a
[14:34] success the way they were a
[14:37] success we cannot never be a success
[14:42] doing anything the world
[14:47] does we can only be a success as we
[14:50] follow after God's statutes and his way
[14:53] of doing
[14:56] things we can never be byass in after
[14:59] the
[15:01] world if the cigarette company has met
[15:05] their greatest success by
[15:10] television and the beer and the whiskey
[15:12] crowds has made their great success
[15:16] through the contribution of
[15:19] Television that's no sign that the
[15:22] church shall make his success by
[15:25] television the success of the church
[15:28] lies within the preaching of the Gospel
[15:30] of the power of God and the
[15:33] demonstration of the spirit praise God
[15:37] we cannot say because that television
[15:40] done such and such for the cigarette
[15:42] company and the and the other companies
[15:45] we do not have any Scripture to try to
[15:48] compare with them
[15:50] people and as long as we do we may draw
[15:54] great numbers of people but that's not
[15:56] what God ordained us to do amen
[16:01] we think because that we're all colors
[16:04] flying high great
[16:07] organizations causing great colorful
[16:10] things to take place that it's a success
[16:13] we are dying daily on our
[16:16] feet spiritually
[16:20] speaking if we stood 10 million strong
[16:23] this
[16:24] morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't with
[16:27] us we'd do well to stand tend strong
[16:30] with the holy spirit with
[16:33] usen we cannot compare with the world
[16:38] one of the first things was the church
[16:40] begin to organize
[16:42] themselves the first organization was
[16:45] the Catholic
[16:46] church and then come the Lutheran
[16:50] Church when they organized in the
[16:52] Catholic church to make it an
[16:54] organization one day there was a
[16:57] cry the Philistines is on the
[17:02] Samson and
[17:04] Samson broke the cords of the bounds of
[17:08] the Catholic church and Martin Luther
[17:11] came forth amen with the
[17:16] organizations then they bound the church
[17:20] with another card as Delia
[17:23] did and they begin instead of having God
[17:26] call man men who were called by the Holy
[17:31] Spirit maybe didn't know their
[17:34] ABCs but they know
[17:37] Christ amen then the church got
[17:41] stylished and fashioned after the
[17:43] political
[17:44] speakers and they had to give their
[17:47] preachers doctor's
[17:49] degree everybody had to be a doctor of
[17:53] divinity that was another card Divine
[17:56] the
[17:57] church man go off and study each
[18:01] Seminary tries to produce a better
[18:02] scholar so that their churches can brag
[18:05] our pastor is a doctor of
[18:10] divinity what did they do one try to
[18:13] have more knowledge than the
[18:16] other well that doesn't mean anything in
[18:18] the sight of God and there's no need for
[18:22] any man to try to take his worldly
[18:25] knowledge and ever please God with it
[18:27] it's an abomination in the sight of
[18:31] God you'll never please God with the
[18:35] worldly Ambitions and knowledge because
[18:37] it's imity to God says the
[18:40] scriptures he cannot do
[18:44] it and each one tries to have all the
[18:47] knowledge they know just what to do and
[18:49] the words to say and it becomes just a
[18:52] political speech in instead of a powerly
[18:56] demonstrated Holy Spirit message that
[18:58] Saints to the heart of man and discovers
[19:01] the sins prise God they're trained for a
[19:06] political
[19:09] talks and we don't need
[19:12] that Paul said the word come to us not
[19:15] only of the gospel and word only but
[19:18] through the power and the manifestation
[19:20] of the Holy Ghost amen that brought the
[19:24] gospel demonstrating the powers of the
[19:28] Holy Ghost
[19:30] po but all these men go off the
[19:35] seminaries and they learn great
[19:37] educations how they must stand before
[19:39] the people how they must present
[19:42] themselves how they must dress and how
[19:44] they must act they should never use the
[19:47] wrong
[19:48] grammar now that's all right for a
[19:51] political
[19:54] speech but we are not after the
[19:57] enchanting words of M
[19:59] Paul said the gospel that I preached
[20:01] didn't come like that but it come
[20:04] through the renewing of the the holy
[20:06] ghost in the power of demonstrations
[20:12] amen come Hallelujah by a right formed
[20:16] speech praise God that your wisdom would
[20:20] be or your trust would be in the wisdom
[20:22] of
[20:23] man but it come through the
[20:26] demonstrations of the power of the re in
[20:28] Christ Hallelujah that's the
[20:32] gospel Amen to know him in the power of
[20:36] his resurrection
[20:39] hallelujah praise God each one tries to
[20:42] think he's a little smarter than the
[20:44] other man each denomination the
[20:46] Methodist will say we got the smartest
[20:48] man the Baptist will say and the Church
[20:51] of Christ and so forth they all we we're
[20:54] the smartest we our our people we don't
[20:56] let just the ordinary man go out and
[20:57] preach the gospel
[21:00] but they handpick
[21:02] them oh God have
[21:05] mercy handpick them if they're indument
[21:09] with their certain Doctrine then they
[21:11] put them in the church God can't touch
[21:14] them in no way
[21:17] amen I want somebody to preach to me
[21:20] that's been handpicked by the Holy Ghost
[21:23] God has raised
[21:25] up Hallelujah not picked by man are
[21:33] denominations all knowledge they say oh
[21:35] we know all about
[21:36] it and some of them doesn't know the
[21:39] first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they
[21:42] deny
[21:46] it it reminds me of a little book I read
[21:49] one day in California about 10 years
[21:52] ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I
[21:55] forget who was the author just a little
[21:58] T sent
[22:00] book but it had some good sense to it
[22:05] though it seemed jokingly and
[22:08] cunningly but I found something in there
[22:12] that sounded like God to
[22:16] me and one of the little stories started
[22:18] out like
[22:20] this one morning in a great chicken
[22:25] pin there was a certain little r
[22:31] that thought he
[22:32] had had all the knowledge that there was
[22:35] to be no
[22:36] one so he FS up on a box and beat his
[22:40] little bill against the Box four or five
[22:43] times threw back his little head and
[22:45] crowed like you never heard of rooster
[22:48] crow and the others he attracted their
[22:51] attention and he said ladies and
[22:55] gentlemen of this chicken pin
[22:59] I would like to speak to you all this
[23:01] morning on some great educational
[23:04] program we have just
[23:08] designed said I have required a lot of
[23:11] knowledge in my studying as he pulled
[23:13] his little glasses over his
[23:16] bill and he said I have decided that we
[23:20] chickens can better ourselves by more
[23:25] knowledge therefore I can tell you that
[23:28] where if we will dig and work in a
[23:31] certain pin or hole we'll find a certain
[23:35] vitamin that'll make us Crow better
[23:38] prettier
[23:39] feathers and oh I can tell you how we
[23:42] can EMB better ourself and many
[23:44] different ways and the little pullets
[23:47] with their little red Combs they just
[23:48] cackled and said isn't he a
[23:53] darling and they certainly admired
[23:57] him oh he is such a brilliant
[24:01] rooster reminds me of some of these your
[24:04] Seminary
[24:06] preachers such a brilliant man there's
[24:10] no need of us hanging around the rest of
[24:11] chickens we all ought to go with
[24:14] him well before the little fell got his
[24:17] speech finished there was another little
[24:20] chicken that didn't have such bright
[24:24] feathers come running in from the rest
[24:26] of the chicken yard and said boy is just
[24:28] a
[24:30] minute I just heard the latest bulletin
[24:33] on the radio chickens went up 4 cents on
[24:36] the pound we're all going to the
[24:38] slaughter
[24:40] tomorrow what good your knowledge going
[24:42] to
[24:44] do brother all the knowledge that we can
[24:47] accumulate what good does it do we're
[24:49] six foot of
[24:51] dirt
[24:53] amen we're all dying by inches and by
[25:00] our knowledge means nothing we want to
[25:03] know
[25:07] him but they do that as I was remarking
[25:11] some time ago
[25:12] about a certain little
[25:16] Canary and he thought he know all the
[25:19] knowledge that it need to be known and
[25:21] he knowed so much that he could tell all
[25:23] the rest of the canaries about the human
[25:26] beings so he flies up on his cage and he
[25:29] begins to speak about the human beings
[25:31] how he knowed all about them and all of
[25:34] a sudden a professor from Purdue walked
[25:37] up and begin to speak some high polished
[25:40] words to him and the little fell batted
[25:42] his eyes and turned his
[25:44] head now he had eyes he could see the
[25:47] professor he had ears he could hear
[25:51] him but of course he didn't know what he
[25:53] was talking about why he's got a canary
[25:56] brain
[25:58] he's just a bird
[26:00] brain that's all he's got he hasn't got
[26:02] a human brain so he can't think like
[26:05] human beings and neither can a human
[26:08] being think like God Amen you're human
[26:14] all the worldly knowledge is no more
[26:15] than a canary
[26:17] brain amen all you do you just hurt
[26:21] yourself with
[26:22] it God you got to have the mind of
[26:26] Christ
[26:29] Hallelujah the reason people go and join
[26:32] organizations and substitute a handshake
[26:36] instead of the new birth they're trying
[26:38] to bypass the new
[26:40] birth they don't want the new
[26:44] birth and the they know we teach it in
[26:47] the
[26:48] Bible so they want to substitute
[26:52] something for it and the Pentecostal
[26:56] people are just as bad
[27:01] trying to substitute something they want
[27:05] it in
[27:06] class this must be just so classy we'll
[27:10] shake hands and join the church and be
[27:12] sprinkled or baptize or
[27:16] something they're afraid of the new
[27:20] birth I sometimes believe the Brandon
[27:23] Tabernacle is getting afraid of it am
[27:29] now we all
[27:30] know that a birth I don't care where it
[27:33] is or what where abouts it's a
[27:36] mess if a baby's born on a shuck pile on
[27:40] a hard floor or in a peak decorated
[27:43] hospital room it's a mess
[27:46] anyhow amen a birth of a calf birth of
[27:49] anything else is a
[27:51] mess and the new birth is nothing less
[27:54] than a mess amen but people so starchy

[28:26] potatoes that that old potato has to
[28:30] root a corn cannot produce new life
[28:34] until it's
[28:35] rotten amen and a man or a woman can
[28:38] never have new birth until their
[28:40] intellectuals and their own self is
[28:42] rotten

[29:07] substituted something for it amen we
[29:10] want the classical way praise God
[29:18] sure the other day Friday wife and I was
[29:21] going to the
[29:23] store I don't mean to harp on this
[29:28] but as we went down the street I just
[29:31] kept turning my head one way for the
[29:32] other naked
[29:34] women I promise God when I was a blind
[29:37] man if he'd heal my eyes I'd look at the
[29:40] thing was
[29:43] right I keep a little cross hanging in
[29:46] my car when I see such as that I look at
[29:49] the cross and say oh God that's my
[29:54] refuge as I looked at the cross
[29:58] I've seen those women prise God me said
[30:01] we haven't seen one woman today that's
[30:04] got on a
[30:08] skirt and she said bill look at that
[30:11] woman
[30:12] there with those little straps around
[30:15] the top of her body said you mean to
[30:18] tell me that woman don't know that's
[30:22] wrong said if she doesn't know it's
[30:24] wrong then she's out of her right mind
[30:28] I said just a minute honey she is an
[30:32] American she does as the Americans
[30:36] do I said I was in Finland not long ago
[30:40] sweetheart and I questioned there to a
[30:43] man that set me down Dr Mion and and we
[30:48] were going to
[30:50] the the health
[30:52] bath What's called the
[30:55] Sund and they take you in and P pour hot
[30:58] water on water on hot rocks and it just
[31:01] sweats you then they make you jump in
[31:04] ice water and then back out then you
[31:05] take you into a room and there's nurses
[31:07] and there women who scrub them in and
[31:09] them
[31:10] naked send them back into the pool I
[31:14] wouldn't go in I said Dr Mion that's
[31:18] wrong he said all right then rever
[31:20] Brandon that's wrong then how about your
[31:22] American doctors that'll strip a woman
[31:24] naked and lay her on the table and
[31:25] examine every sex organ she's got
[31:34] God how about your nurses in the
[31:38] hospitals I said excuse me brother n
[31:40] Mion you're
[31:42] right what is it it's
[31:47] Customs when I was in Paris I could
[31:51] hardly believe
[31:52] it that the urals for both men and women
[31:55] were the same on
[32:00] I couldn't understand it that the
[32:01] restrooms was on the side of the
[32:04] street were both male and
[32:08] female I couldn't believe that when
[32:10] women went to the beach to go swimming a
[32:13] boy and his sweetheart they had no
[32:15] dressing rooms they just took all their
[32:17] clothes to the last garment then turned
[32:19] their backs and put on a little strap
[32:20] when swimming but it's
[32:22] so they pay no attention to
[32:25] it it's a custom of friend
[32:30] in
[32:31] Africa women and men young and old no
[32:35] clothes at
[32:36] all walking through the Prairies never
[32:40] know what a restroom was or things or
[32:41] never went out of each other's
[32:44] s but they don't know the
[32:47] difference they don't know the
[32:49] difference but it's customs of
[32:53] Nations but I said honey we are
[32:56] different we're from another
[32:59] Nation we are pilgrims and strangers
[33:02] here that's what makes these things look
[33:04] so wrong
[33:06] amen for the Bible said they that
[33:09] profess such cleanly show that they are
[33:12] pilgrims and strangers there seeking a
[33:15] city to come amen a man or a woman in
[33:19] Italy in France in Africa in any other
[33:25] Nation that's ever Bor again of the Holy
[33:29] Ghost don't do those things
[33:32] amen they won't wear those clothes they
[33:35] won't act like that because they're of
[33:38] another
[33:39] nation whose ruler and maker is
[33:44] God we're from
[33:47] Heaven the spirit that's within you
[33:50] motivates your life if you are American
[33:53] you'll do as Americans
[33:55] do if you are French you'll do as the
[33:58] French
[33:59] do and criticize the other but if you
[34:03] are a god you'll do the way they do in
[34:05] heaven because your spirit comes from
[34:09] above and it controls
[34:13] you a little something you might look
[34:16] at in the scripture those who sought
[34:20] this new
[34:21] city acted different they professed that
[34:24] they were pilgrims and
[34:26] strangers but on the side of King they
[34:29] become fugitives and
[34:33] renegades but Christians were pilgrims
[34:37] and
[34:38] strangers a fugitive has no
[34:41] home a renegade is a horrible
[34:46] person but a
[34:49] pilgrim is something real and from a
[34:52] real land in another Nation trying to
[34:55] find his way home amen professing by his
[34:59] living that he has something that he's
[35:01] from another
[35:03] country there is the reason but yet
[35:07] those people who do so those people who
[35:10] wear those things let me tell you and
[35:13] South Africa when I saw
[35:17] 30,000 raw heathens naked blanket
[35:22] natives 16 18 20 year old girls boys
[35:26] with not once bch of
[35:29] clothes standing there with mud in their
[35:32] faces and painted Up Bones through their
[35:35] nose and blocks of wood hanging from
[35:38] their ears and cross human bones or some
[35:41] bones in their
[35:43] hair animals teeth hanging over
[35:48] them naked as they come into the world
[35:51] and didn't know
[35:53] it but when they received Christ and
[35:56] fell on their face and received the Holy
[35:59] Ghost they got up and folded their arms
[36:01] to hold shame to their bosom as they
[36:05] walked away and found clothes to put on
[36:08] Amen why they become pilgrims and
[36:11] strangers to this world amen hallelujah
[36:15] praise the
[36:17] Lord hallelujah they were away from him
[36:21] yes
[36:22] sir oh yes these people call themselves
[36:26] Christians they belong to churches
[36:28] they go and say we are methodists we are
[36:30] Baptists we're Pentecostal we're s Day
[36:33] Adventist we're this that the other that
[36:35] doesn't have one thing to do with it
[36:38] your spirit the life that's in you
[36:40] motivates and tells what you are Jesus
[36:43] said by their fruit you shall know
[36:48] them the church has become like Israel
[36:52] first they seen all the Heathen Nations
[36:54] having a king God was their King
[36:58] and they seen the Heathen Nations having
[37:00] King so they wanted to act like the
[37:03] Heathen Nations and they bought themsel
[37:05] a
[37:07] king and as they did
[37:12] it they got in trouble gradually begin
[37:15] to come in gradually the world begin to
[37:18] slip into them finally ended up in
[37:22] aab one king coming just a little closer
[37:24] to it a little closer to it and finally
[37:26] squeeze the life out of them there they
[37:29] went and when their real king come they
[37:31] didn't know him that's the same thing
[37:33] the church has done it's adopted here
[37:37] they are it's adopted politics
[37:42] educations it's adopted organizations
[37:46] Society big churches amen High confuting
[37:50] preachers and when the real King comes
[37:52] they don't know him and they're
[37:54] crucifying the very Holy Ghost that's
[37:56] their King help us Jesus they don't know
[38:00] him Hallelujah but they laugh at him and
[38:03] make fun of him as they Jews did their
[38:06] Messiah the church is doing their
[38:08] Messiah the same
[38:10] way they don't know
[38:13] it they haven't got the spiritual
[38:16] Insight because they're so
[38:27] to to compare with the world we're
[38:30] exalted to Humble
[38:32] ourselves and one is a majority in God
[38:36] and today in the healing evangelist out
[38:37] on the fields there's such a competit
[38:41] competitors one says well bless God I
[38:43] have so many thousand I got a bigger
[38:44] meting than you have what difference
[38:47] does that
[38:48] make we have one or one million what
[38:51] difference does it make are we true to
[38:54] God are we true to his word do we stand
[38:57] under test of the holy
[39:01] spirit is it true that's the main thing
[39:05] but we compromise upon the
[39:07] Bible lot of our Pentecostal people upon
[39:10] the fundamental doctrines of this Bible
[39:16] compromise I don't want to hurt feelings
[39:19] I'm in my own church and I feel that I I
[39:22] could do just what in my church because
[39:24] I'm preaching the gospel but there's
[39:26] tens of thousands of Pentecostal
[39:28] preachers know that there's no such a
[39:31] thing in the Bible as a baptism in the
[39:32] name of father son Holy
[39:35] Ghost I challenge the Archbishop for
[39:38] anybody to show me where anybody was
[39:40] ever baptized in the name of father son
[39:41] Holy Ghost am but they compromise
[39:45] because these organizations has did so
[39:49] there's not one person in the New
[39:51] Testament and for 300 years afterwards
[39:53] the history of what was baptized in the
[39:55] name of Jesus Christ amen what is it
[39:59] organization that's did it
[40:02] compromising and today they' took all
[40:05] the street workers off the
[40:07] streets they've took the tambourine out
[40:09] of the
[40:10] church they've taken all the glory out
[40:13] of the church and got seminaries
[40:16] preaching little old rooster comb
[40:20] preaching all Polished in society and
[40:23] they're women wearing shorts and dresses
[40:26] that they're skinned into and man
[40:28] smoking cigarettes and gambling and
[40:30] telling dirty
[40:33] jokes it's a disgrace in the sight of
[40:38] God I know that's rough but it's time
[40:42] somebody said
[40:47] something
[40:49] compromising giving in acting like the
[40:51] world I don't care if I have to stand
[40:54] alone with nobody but God alone I'll
[40:56] preach the truth of God's Bible and
[40:58] stand for it if I die I'll still stand
[41:02] for the
[41:03] truth prise the
[41:05] Lord we want truth I measure up not
[41:09] according to the church but according to
[41:10] the word of God I want to measure
[41:14] up but Del did you notice she know that
[41:18] Samson had a
[41:20] power and she didn't know where that
[41:23] power
[41:24] laid she couldn't tell what that power
[41:27] was was but there was some great power
[41:30] that Samson possessed and she wanted to
[41:33] find it and as Delia she kept wooing
[41:37] Samson after her
[41:39] beauty oh she dressed herself real sexy
[41:42] and she walked before him and she teed
[41:45] like some of the little teenagers of the
[41:46] day and and so forth and just act like
[41:49] something other strip teas trying to woo
[41:52] Samson to
[41:54] her that's the same thing the world's
[41:56] done to to the
[42:00] church now where is your great power
[42:03] well if we'll organize that'll break the
[42:05] power the Catholic Church done it but
[42:08] the Philistines is on the Samson and a
[42:10] Luther come
[42:11] out and he organized again if you buy me
[42:15] with another card it'll hold me so they
[42:18] did and the fistings on me Samson what
[42:21] happened Wesley came out and broke the
[42:24] cards amen now you de see all along
[42:28] don't you know I love you Samson all
[42:30] right tell me the truth in your heart
[42:32] all right you buy me with another card
[42:35] all right now we'll do that what is that
[42:37] that's the denominational card you let
[42:39] me be free that I ain't got no
[42:41] denomination then I tell you you have me
[42:43] broke so how come the
[42:46] Pentecostals amen where's your power FL
[42:50] be up on me and he broke the cards again
[42:54] but now what happened is got the penny
[42:57] Pentecostals to Big doctors of divinity
[42:59] for their
[43:01] pastors some great man they've got just
[43:04] as much school in ritual as a Methodist
[43:06] or Baptist or the rest of them's
[43:08] got going into a church and you can't
[43:10] hear a
[43:11] amen just as cold as a bunch of uh
[43:15] Eskimos right off the North Pole amen
[43:19] cold
[43:21] indiff and now the Philistines is on
[43:25] these
[43:26] Samson the the Philistines is on the
[43:28] America where is that Oneness of
[43:31] spirit amen where is the Oneness of
[43:35] Pentecost Assemblies of God and the
[43:37] United and the Church of God and this
[43:39] that and the other each one with a
[43:41] different is and this one with that and
[43:42] this one with that we're so broke up the
[43:45] you can go into a city to hold a Revival
[43:46] of one Church sponsored the rest of them
[43:48] only even attend
[43:51] am the Communist is up on the America
[43:54] where is our power where is our Glory
[43:57] why is it because we went after the
[43:59] wisdom of man instead of the power of
[44:02] God why we got art preachers and things
[44:05] are so stiff and starchy till they've
[44:07] organized us that we're so starchy and
[44:09] stiff neck the people you never hear a
[44:11] shout in the church anymore you never

[44:46] stiff while the God can come into the
[44:48] midst of Pentecostal people and show
[44:51] that he's God and prove the signs of his
[44:53] resurrection that don't even shake them

[48:14] lot of mental telepathy my pastor said
[48:17] it was of the devil you poor
[48:19] hypocritical deluded
[48:22] Infidel all polished up you
[48:26] wolf and sheep's
[48:28] clothes Jesus said if You' have know me
[48:30] You' have know my
[48:33] day but you got a bunch of STS to try to
[48:35] make you like the rest of the world we
[48:37] want a bunch of man of God who don't
[48:39] compromise on the word but preach the
[48:41] truth and stand on the baptism of the
[48:44] Holy
[48:45] Spirit but what has the world done it
[48:47] shaved all your power
[48:49] off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but
[48:53] the world certainly shaved your power
[48:56] now to the starches the rest of
[48:58] them what are we going to do what's
[49:01] going to happen there's one glorious
[49:04] thing that I can think of in this
[49:06] text while Samson was bound we can't
[49:10] have a
[49:11] Revival listen our loyal brother Billy
[49:14] Graham reviv in our day listen oral
[49:18] Robert scream reviv in our
[49:21] day listen at the rest of them Reviving
[49:23] our they how can we have a Revival when
[49:26] we're
[49:28] bound amen we bound the holy spirit with
[49:31] our organizations and traditions and we
[49:34] can't have a holy ghost
[49:37] Revival man I know that's scorching hot
[49:40] with the
[49:42] weather but it's the
[49:44] truth how can we have a holy ghost
[49:47] Revival when you're so bound and
[49:49] starchy Farm of godliness the Bible said
[49:52] they had Farm of godliness but would
[49:55] deny the power there the power of
[49:58] what amen the power of the organization
[50:02] the power of the world the power of the
[50:03] church the power of the Holy Ghost
[50:06] that's the secret place in the church
[50:09] and when the church adopts educated
[50:12] preachers and big buildings and finery
[50:14] and instead of the oldfashioned Holy
[50:16] Ghost it better be in a mission
[50:19] again
[50:24] amen how you going to have Revival of
[50:26] the Holy Ghost and people quench it and
[50:28] bound it and afraid of
[50:33] it there's where the trouble Li the
[50:36] Philistines is on the but the one
[50:39] blessed hope we have while Samson was in
[50:43] jail what's the first thing they had
[50:45] done when they caught him they bound him
[50:47] first they took his power away they
[50:49] found his secret they found your
[50:52] secret the world found your secret now
[50:55] you women all Bob your hair go like the
[50:57] world you man all go and act like the
[51:00] world it's all right tell jokes and
[51:02] dirty jokes and go out and smoke a few
[51:04] cigarettes and run out with the
[51:06] neighbors wives and everything else like
[51:08] that a little sociable drink to hold
[51:10] your job I'd rather lay on my belly and
[51:13] eat sod crackers and drink Branch water
[51:15] and stay clean and pure before God then
[51:18] the
[51:19] compromise for any kind of a
[51:22] job right thank you true stay true to
[51:27] God Samson the Philistines is on thee
[51:31] brandom Tabernacle whism is creeping in
[51:34] among you what about it have you exposed
[51:38] your secret have you exposed that secret
[51:41] did God give you when you were Walling
[51:43] there and ass sawdust a few years
[51:45] ago have you let it creep out the social
[51:48] formal
[51:50] worship God what's happened to you God
[51:54] can come down and perform a miracle and
[51:55] go right down to the the audience and
[51:57] tell people the secrets of their hearts
[51:58] and everything and heal the sick and
[52:00] Afflicted and do signs and wonders and
[52:02] preach his word as hard as it can by the
[52:03] Holy Ghost and people say well I guess
[52:05] that's all
[52:06] right we enjoy listening to it once in a
[52:08] while if we're not too
[52:10] tired that's brandom
[52:14] Tabernacle the Philistines is on the
[52:17] what used to be when the preaching of
[52:18] the word and the old Saints with the
[52:21] tears in their eyes would rise to their
[52:23] feet and walk soling maybe not saying a
[52:25] word just walking around two or three
[52:27] times and sit down so filled with the
[52:29] Holy Ghost the word
[52:31] fedom amen man shall not live by bread
[52:34] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[52:37] out of the mouth of
[52:39] God Philistines is on the brandom
[52:42] Tabernacle Philistines is on you
[52:44] Pentecostal of course the Philistines
[52:46] got you rest of you long time ago when

[53:10] all of it when you let the world creep
[53:12] in you go to act and act the world then

[1:41:10] place for you and it's just like our
[1:41:13] Prophet said we're not trying to be like
[1:41:16] the world you know what I mean you know
[1:41:19] I don't care if everybody sings perfect

[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:19] amen man I you enjoying it amen man
[2:15:24] there was a sister Alicia who had a
[2:15:26] testimony I'm not sure if she's in the
[2:15:28] building
[2:15:53] I can speak well English um I need help
[2:15:57] I is that
[2:16:16] okay I don't know how to sing very well
[2:16:23] but like many of you I have many
[2:16:34] testimonies it would be a lot to go very
[2:16:37] far back in my life but not so long ago
[2:16:40] in a preaching um
[2:16:52] uh in my own home I was asking for a
[2:16:55] topic that I had in my
[2:16:59] heart
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:05] um and I didn't think that it would be
[2:17:08] spoken about so soon
[2:17:12] here and our pastor was speaking of said
[2:17:19] topic and as soon as he started speaking
[2:17:22] it caught my
[2:17:28] attention because just a few weeks ago I
[2:17:30] had been thinking about that
[2:17:40] topic and I don't know if it's happened
[2:17:42] to you guys that when the Lord is
[2:17:44] speaking to you
[2:17:50] it's like I could see back and not see
[2:17:54] any of you guys standing
[2:17:57] there it's as if I was alone as if it
[2:18:01] was all for
[2:18:07] me and almost literally I looked all
[2:18:09] around me and I practically saw no
[2:18:17] one and during the whole preaching I was
[2:18:20] very excited about that
[2:18:23] topic and when he did the calling to the
[2:18:30] altar I was still doubting in either
[2:18:33] going up or
[2:18:37] not because I felt that I had gotten
[2:18:39] everything
[2:18:43] there I was just giving thanks to God
[2:18:45] for speaking to me so quickly
[2:18:51] and in the last prayer that he did for
[2:18:57] everybody I just raised my hand and said
[2:18:59] Lord thank you because I am
[2:19:01] understanding everything that you're
[2:19:05] speaking but in a moment I also wanted
[2:19:08] to go up and to be prayed
[2:19:15] for and I was uh practicing what I was
[2:19:18] going to tell him to say to pray for me
[2:19:22] me and I was sure that I wasn't going to
[2:19:24] be able to say
[2:19:26] it but she's always uh thinking about
[2:19:30] me and in a moment she was already with
[2:19:35] me well she translated for
[2:19:41] me and in that moment I felt the
[2:19:44] presence a
[2:19:47] lot I couldn't even uh take a look at
[2:19:56] him as something started happening in me
[2:19:59] that I wanted to take aby's
[2:20:04] hand because I couldn't look at him or
[2:20:07] look anywhere I just closed my
[2:20:12] eyes and I don't know what moment I felt
[2:20:14] that I uh took his arm
[2:20:23] but I don't know if he can remember but
[2:20:25] I felt that I took a hold of
[2:20:28] him and in that
[2:20:33] moment I heard that he was speaking to
[2:20:35] me in
[2:20:37] Spanish I was understanding everything
[2:20:39] he was
[2:20:42] saying and if Abby was telling me
[2:20:44] something I couldn't hear her anymore it
[2:20:46] was too much of what I was
[2:20:49] feeling because because I know it was
[2:20:51] the
[2:20:54] Lord through these vases that he's used
[2:20:57] in these
[2:21:05] preachers I think every preacher and all
[2:21:07] the time that they use to speak to
[2:21:12] us I'm a person that's a little
[2:21:16] nervous and I never like to come up
[2:21:19] here but
[2:21:22] I'm but I'm really thankful for the time
[2:21:25] that y'all use to speak to
[2:21:30] us because I notic that sometimes they
[2:21:33] have to set aside
[2:21:34] their to put the things of God and I'm
[2:21:37] very
[2:21:41] thankful because God has given me 365
[2:21:45] days
[2:21:46] healthy safe
[2:21:50] and the only thing I have to do is come
[2:21:52] here and sit
[2:21:54] down and sometimes
[2:21:58] I what will I tell the Lord when they've
[2:22:01] prepared so
[2:22:03] much and that I can't live the
[2:22:07] word I do the best I
[2:22:09] can pray for
[2:22:13] us it looks like we're alone but we're
[2:22:16] not alone brother we have him on our
[2:22:19] side
[2:22:21] and I
[2:22:24] have loved you guys very much the very
[2:22:27] little amount of we to talk y'all are
[2:22:30] very sweet with
[2:22:31] me and with
[2:22:34] Abby and I would like to say a lot of
[2:22:38] things but I want to give time to
[2:22:40] everybody
[2:22:40] else to the Musicians as
[2:22:43] well because y'all take the
[2:22:47] time to the precious voices that are
[2:22:49] sometimes behind
[2:22:51] even little
[2:22:57] girls and I sometimes just close my eyes
[2:22:59] and I feel like my voice is coming out
[2:23:00] in
[2:23:02] them to me it's just an
[2:23:05] inspiration and hear their beautiful
[2:23:08] voices to me they're very
[2:23:12] brave to come up here and give a song
[2:23:15] special y are very brave
[2:23:22] and all the work that y'all their moms
[2:23:24] do to teach
[2:23:27] them
[2:23:29] and Sunday school teachers for the
[2:23:32] patience they have I lived it once with
[2:23:35] her and I had to have a lot of
[2:23:45] patience and I don't want to leave
[2:23:46] without saying that I don't remember if
[2:23:48] that day that I had that blessing with
[2:23:49] the Lord it was a
[2:23:53] Sunday I don't remember if it was the
[2:23:55] next Monday or two Mondays
[2:23:58] after I got to my
[2:24:06] job and the lady in the house told me
[2:24:09] that she would just come back in a
[2:24:10] little
[2:24:13] moment but to me it was all normal
[2:24:15] because she does that a
[2:24:18] lot and when she came back
[2:24:22] she came back very
[2:24:27] happy and I when I passed by
[2:24:30] her she stopped
[2:24:34] me and told me Alicia how is your
[2:24:38] case I have a case with a
[2:24:43] lawyer and well since I've known her for
[2:24:46] years she's known a little bit about my
[2:24:49] case
[2:24:54] and I told her well it's going along
[2:24:55] it's just going along very
[2:25:00] slowly she said okay just be more
[2:25:02] sincere with
[2:25:12] me and I told her that um well right now
[2:25:15] it's a little detained it's going along
[2:25:17] but it's a little detained because I'm
[2:25:18] doing it in payments
[2:25:25] but I know that there the Lord is just
[2:25:27] waiting for me to get all the money
[2:25:29] together so she sat me
[2:25:32] down she took away what I had what what
[2:25:35] I was holding in my
[2:25:38] hands and she told me we want to take
[2:25:40] your
[2:25:43] case well I didn't understand it because
[2:25:45] I know they're not lawyers
[2:25:50] but they paid the full
[2:25:54] price so it's just pure grace that the
[2:25:56] Lord has given me to be walk
[2:25:59] here I have a lot to be thankful
[2:26:02] for and maybe I have so little to
[2:26:07] give but I want to live this year the

[2:32:21] [Applause]
[2:32:30] December
[2:32:38] was I want to be short because if I
[2:32:41] say we be all
[2:32:48] night in
[2:32:52] 2023 the Lord sent me an
[2:33:02] angel when we began to rent uh the home
[2:33:05] that we're
[2:33:12] renting we prayed to the Lord so that
[2:33:14] maybe he would change the heart of the
[2:33:17] landlord to sell us their home
[2:33:19] [Music]
[2:33:25] and in November he said I have good
[2:33:30] news I'm going to sell you the
[2:33:41] home but I didn't have the credit uh to
[2:33:44] buy the home because I had to go through
[2:33:45] the bank
[2:34:05] all of November and
[2:34:09] December January February
[2:34:18] March when and I would go hunting I
[2:34:21] would go out there on my own and I would
[2:34:23] cry alone out
[2:34:37] there uh but I prayed to him and I
[2:34:39] prayed for him to send me an angel so
[2:34:41] that I can buy my
[2:34:47] home and he responded he sent me an
[2:34:49] angel
[2:34:58] and he
[2:35:00] said and he said brother
[2:35:03] um go buy the house uh that you want I'm
[2:35:06] going to buy it for you
[2:35:20] but I asked the Lord that if I things
[2:35:21] would turn out wrong and I couldn't pay
[2:35:23] it that not to do it uh to Hur my
[2:35:34] brother and the enemy just put
[2:35:36] up uh stipulation after stipulation and
[2:35:39] we couldn't do
[2:35:43] anything and that was
[2:35:46] one that was one Angel yes
[2:35:53] and this year you sent another
[2:36:00] Angel my wife and
[2:36:08] I we were thinking of uh preparing our
[2:36:16] documents but it was too expensive
[2:36:22] and I asked the Lord once again Send Me
[2:36:23] an Angel again so that he can help me
[2:36:26] and he sent him
[2:36:29] again and the brother
[2:36:32] said he said here you go so that you can
[2:36:34] start your
[2:36:45] case and we started the case
[2:36:55] they said in seven to eight months they
[2:36:57] would get the uh their social security
[2:37:00] and then after that they would get
[2:37:02] the the per the permit the permit to
[2:37:13] work and I want to thank God because he
[2:37:15] always responds
[2:37:19] he's always there he always
[2:37:22] responds for all the needs that we
[2:37:27] have and like my sister Alicia
[2:37:32] said things have happened to me
[2:37:38] when when I hear a
[2:37:42] sermon in English and then all of a
[2:37:44] sudden it's in English and I realized
[2:37:46] that I'm understanding like if it was in
[2:37:48] Spanish
[2:37:56] and this year uh when I was
[2:38:03] sad the first time in a brother Billy uh

[2:43:29] and then after that brother Andrew and
[2:43:32] and then we'll have brother Ben come
[2:43:33] after that amen
[2:43:50] God bless you Saints I truly can say
[2:43:52] that there's no place I'd rather be than
[2:43:55] just uh gather to together with those
[2:43:58] who you know we we really have had our
[2:44:02] hearts turned by an end time message and
[2:44:04] we've gathered around a truth and and uh
[2:44:08] you know this is you're standing before
[2:44:11] the evidence of of what the restored
[2:44:14] word is I the bride and and the
[2:44:18] testimony you're seeing that you know
[2:44:20] God's desire to have a body a bride and
[2:44:23] a church and know each testimony that
[2:44:26] the Holy Spirit the same yesterday today
[2:44:28] and forever having people hear in their
[2:44:31] own language the true book of Acts is
[2:44:33] being lived out and uh you know we're
[2:44:36] just thankful to be a part of it I I
[2:44:37] believe around this time a year ago we
[2:44:39] were uh we honestly thought that we were
[2:44:42] terminally ill and just seeing the Lord
[2:44:45] un undertake miraculously for us the
[2:44:47] things that the men medicine and the
[2:44:49] symptoms were testifying to the Lord
[2:44:51] just supernaturally delivered us and
[2:44:53] healed us and we're standing here just
[2:44:56] to uh by his grace and his love and you
[2:44:59] know and one of the things I reflect
[2:45:01] back on just looking at this year you
[2:45:03] know I'm I'm thankful for a pastor that
[2:45:06] uh just yields himself to the Lord and
[2:45:10] and you know I don't think we would
[2:45:13] truly understand all the things that a
[2:45:15] Shepherd is able to Shield the flock
[2:45:17] from um the wounds and the things that
[2:45:21] he are probably suffered and you know
[2:45:24] it's
[2:45:25] uh just a something I want to recognize
[2:45:28] and say thank you for all you do for
[2:45:32] everything you've done through the past
[2:45:33] year the building the church the the
[2:45:35] many labors and you know I I I look back
[2:45:39] at this year and I I'm just grateful for
[2:45:41] everybody especially our pastor and I
[2:45:45] just um want to say thank you Lord for
[2:45:48] all you all that he's done God bless
[2:45:59] you God bless you
[2:46:02] all you know it's little thought that I
[2:46:05] had uh the Lord's dealing with me about
[2:46:07] the new year and I just believe even
[2:46:09] after tonight's uh message about Samson
[2:46:13] the little thought was just have the
[2:46:15] right vision and a lot of times just
[2:46:17] like Samson he got his eyes on things
[2:46:19] that were pleasant to the eye but you
[2:46:23] know I I believe that if we would see
[2:46:26] like what is Promised just even in the
[2:46:28] tape that there's coming a Revival and
[2:46:31] it's an individual and so for me
[2:46:34] personally what I want to have my eyes
[2:46:35] on is to do like I believe it was Ruth
[2:46:39] that when it was barley season it was a
[2:46:42] time of a harvest there's a time of
[2:46:44] harvest you know there's a time where
[2:46:46] you and I have received this message
[2:46:48] message and just like our brother was
[2:46:50] saying our hearts have been turned and
[2:46:53] so I want to be faithful like Ruth and
[2:46:55] go out and you know collect the little
[2:46:58] wheat that's dropping off here and there
[2:47:00] and how do we do that by going and
[2:47:01] feeding and praying and receiving that
[2:47:04] word into a heart and then it actually
[2:47:07] what it did for Ruth is so striking to
[2:47:09] me but there was somebody there a prince
[2:47:12] that fell in love with her and her
[2:47:15] character her faithfulness and that's
[2:47:17] what I want to be I want to have the
[2:47:18] vision that I'm not looking at the
[2:47:20] things of the world the Technologies
[2:47:22] though they have great iPhones and they
[2:47:23] have great cars and different
[2:47:25] Technologies but I don't want to be like
[2:47:27] Samson where the enemy blinds me I want
[2:47:31] to have the right Vision I want to be
[2:47:33] faithful to go into the word of God and
[2:47:35] I want to do my part you know we see
[2:47:37] there's older saints of God like our
[2:47:39] brother David was our brother you know
[2:47:41] was telling about our pastor you know we
[2:47:43] make a way one for the other when God
[2:47:46] strikes you with Revelation it moves you
[2:47:48] into action and we go and bear for one
[2:47:51] another and we thank God for a Godly
[2:47:54] Pastor one that sees and has Vision I
[2:47:56] remember and I was going to testify of
[2:47:58] this before but before this was even
[2:48:01] built this was back in 2015 or or 14 but
[2:48:05] we were out here and there was a number
[2:48:06] of us and it was when um brother Ed bisc
[2:48:09] was here and a number of us was walking
[2:48:11] in this property and we were looking up
[2:48:13] at the tower and brother Ed bisc turned
[2:48:15] around and spoke about Brother David
[2:48:17] having being a a vision and I believe
[2:48:20] that God gives a man a vision that he
[2:48:23] can blaze a trail that others can follow
[2:48:25] and say this is the way and that's what
[2:48:26] our Prophet did and I believe that he's
[2:48:29] an example of faithfulness to hold to
[2:48:31] the word of God and I want to take
[2:48:33] courage and I want to say I want to have
[2:48:34] the right Vision I want to see the
[2:48:36] people that have gone before us and
[2:48:39] follow in their steps that's what we're
[2:48:41] to be to other people amen so I want to
[2:48:43] unite my heart I want to be like like
[2:48:45] this there was a quote in there it says
[2:48:48] one is the majority with God this is a
[2:48:51] time to unite become one with God and we
[2:48:54] become the majority it's not worrying
[2:48:55] about the world and things so I just
[2:48:57] want to have the right Vision I want to
[2:48:59] be faithful I want to go into the
[2:49:01] storehouse I want God to feed me so that
[2:49:03] whenever I go and I've been feeding on a
[2:49:06] tape and I come in contact with somebody
[2:49:08] who has a need I already have the word
[2:49:10] in season and it can bring life to
[2:49:13] somebody that's what the seed will do
[2:49:15] it'll bring life we've received life now
[2:49:17] it's time to go and be about our
[2:49:19] father's business amen God bless you we
[2:49:22] love you you know it's really the love
[2:49:24] of God that brings confidence that's
[2:49:26] what it's a byproduct of the love of God
[2:49:29] is revelation so we can not have to
[2:49:31] dwell and worry about our Humanity we
[2:49:33] can look and see there's something on
[2:49:35] the inside that's greater than my
[2:49:37] Humanity it's the love of God let it
[2:49:39] shine this year God bless you
[2:49:43] [Applause]
[2:49:52] wow that was good that was
[2:49:55] amazing um so driving
[2:49:59] here you kind of learned uh especially
[2:50:02] when it comes to Brother David that um
[2:50:04] you have to be ready for the
[2:50:06] unexpected you there's never anything
[2:50:09] that's normal that you can can expect
[2:50:12] there's always going to be something you
[2:50:13] don't understand but it's always good
[2:50:17] but as I was coming here I was pondering
[2:50:19] um a song was playing in my head and I I
[2:50:22] love the sing so when a song strikes me
[2:50:25] sometimes that's where I find my
[2:50:26] inspiration I was thinking of the song
[2:50:27] in his time right and every year that
[2:50:30] goes by we make plans we make decisions
[2:50:32] of things we want to get done in a year
[2:50:34] we say well this is my target this is
[2:50:36] what I want to hit this year if I don't
[2:50:37] hit it then this year is a
[2:50:38] failure and I got to thinking on that I
[2:50:41] was like man where was I last year
[2:50:42] compared to this year and you start
[2:50:43] looking you start comparing and saying
[2:50:45] well I failed here I failed there I
[2:50:46] failed here and I failed there like wow
[2:50:48] this year was a waste but it can't be a
[2:50:51] waste I'm righteous he orders my steps
[2:50:56] everything that goes on within this year
[2:50:58] he knew it would take place I'm not one
[2:51:01] step behind I'm no further than what he
[2:51:04] knew I would be in this moment so if
[2:51:06] you've got a need and desire for
[2:51:08] something if it's a loved one if it's a
[2:51:10] desired outcome of a life you want to
[2:51:12] live whatever it is whatever vision is
[2:51:13] you have in your mind understand the
[2:51:15] Lord's timing is everything right he's
[2:51:18] he's The Giver of all good gifts so
[2:51:20] whether he gives it to you or not your
[2:51:23] your names are written in the Lamb's
[2:51:25] Book of Life you've got something to be
[2:51:27] happy about so that song in his time was
[2:51:30] really on my heart so I we'll just sing
[2:51:32] that chorus
[2:51:33] cuz why
[2:51:35] not in his
[2:51:38] [Music]
[2:51:41] time in his time
[2:51:46] [Music]
[2:51:49] he makes all
[2:51:53] things
[2:51:56] beautiful in
[2:52:00] [Music]
[2:52:02] his oh and Lord please
[2:52:07] show me
[2:52:10] every
[2:52:12] day as you're
[2:52:16] teaching me your
[2:52:20] way that you'll
[2:52:23] do just what you
[2:52:28] say in your
[2:52:33] time one of the best advice I'd say
[2:52:36] brother David's ever given me and it
[2:52:39] sticks to me constantly he says buddy
[2:52:41] you could pray and pray and fast and do
[2:52:45] all of these things but God can do no
[2:52:48] more for you than what he set out to do
[2:52:51] so just rest and knowing he's in control

[3:03:33] amen the Lord has been good
[3:03:36] amen you
[3:03:38] know there's so much to say and and I I
[3:03:43] really don't want to take up any time
[3:03:44] and
[3:03:46] just you know I remember earlier this
[3:03:50] year I went to see a doctor and you know
[3:03:54] you know how you go see a doctor the
[3:03:56] verdict is usually you're going to die
[3:03:58] you know so it's never anything good
[3:04:01] that comes out of it but uh you know I
[3:04:04] thank God that you know and he he
[3:04:07] touched my body he heals me and and I
[3:04:10] feel a lot better and and I purpose in
[3:04:13] my heart for any for all that is done
[3:04:16] for me am man I'll spend my life serving
[3:04:19] him amen you know when the Lord does
[3:04:21] something good to you you do something
[3:04:23] back you want to show your appreciation
[3:04:26] for all that he does for you amen and
[3:04:29] you know I know uh things has been said
[3:04:32] about Brother David is just I the the
[3:04:36] leadership is just unmatched um he
[3:04:41] uh you you learn so much by just
[3:04:44] watching him and the way he does things
[3:04:47] and
[3:04:48] and to a leader is not one who stands in
[3:04:52] the front and bid his chest and want
[3:04:54] people to follow him a leader is a
[3:04:57] leader by example it's one that uh
[3:05:01] usually when when everything is going
[3:05:03] fine you won't even see him he is high
[3:05:06] he somewhere just want to see how
[3:05:08] everything evolve and and when there's
[3:05:11] something to be corrected he just knows
[3:05:13] how to slip in there and just starts to
[3:05:15] work and and correct it and I and I and
[3:05:18] I've just I I'll say it's just been an
[3:05:21] opportunity of a lifetime to just uh you
[3:05:25] know work alongside him and just watch
[3:05:27] him and and learn from him and see how
[3:05:30] he does things and just wonder why and
[3:05:32] ask the question and it will answer you
[3:05:34] and show you so you you don't do things
[3:05:37] because it's just the way to do it but
[3:05:39] you understand the motive and objective
[3:05:41] behind and I've been so fortunate to
[3:05:44] have that uh and I could say it's a true
[3:05:47] friend I've had an opportunity to just
[3:05:50] uh stay close to him and just listen and
[3:05:53] and watch him and be able to learn a lot
[3:05:55] and I thank God for that amen and my
[3:05:58] heart desire for the New Year I'll say
[3:06:00] like the prophet it's not we don't
[3:06:03] change P turn pages and I we don't as
[3:06:07] Believers but mam said that the believer
[3:06:09] has to be the most motivated person that
[3:06:12] is on the face of the Earth and and our
[3:06:16] goals has not changed Rapture is the
[3:06:18] goal and often time the devil will try
[3:06:21] to throw things in there to try to cause
[3:06:24] you to look the other way and that's
[3:06:26] what he does every day but my if but
[3:06:30] says that if we could just keep our eyes
[3:06:31] straight to the Cross we're not turning
[3:06:34] a new leave what we wanting for every
[3:06:36] day of our life is to make contact with
[3:06:39] Christ is to be born again is to
[3:06:42] continually die to ourselves and let him
[3:06:45] Live This Promise this message is a
[3:06:48] promise of a Rapture this message has a
[3:06:51] promise of an overcomer and it's not an
[3:06:54] overcomer for one day it's the Overcomer
[3:06:56] from here till eternity but R said when
[3:06:59] God gave his weapon his weapon was good
[3:07:01] for everything I want in my life to be
[3:07:04] able to utilize the weapon not just for
[3:07:07] my own circumstance but every time I
[3:07:09] come against even one that's tied up and
[3:07:11] bind up in the de and the devil has
[3:07:13] gotten so twisted up that I be able to
[3:07:16] use the weapon and and make it effective
[3:07:18] and make sure that weapon works not just
[3:07:20] for me but for others that's the desire
[3:07:23] of my heart to be where God wants me to
[3:07:25] do to be and doing what he wants me to
[3:07:27] be doing amen God bless
[3:07:31] [Applause]
[3:07:37] you you know
[3:07:40] the it really doesn't do do much good to
[3:07:44] look back because there's not a thing
[3:07:46] you can do about it you know what I mean
[3:07:49] you can learn from it but if you don't
[3:07:52] have a path forward you're going to
[3:07:55] repeat the same mistakes over and over
[3:07:59] again and so I'd like to share with you
[3:08:03] what my vision
[3:08:05] is for our body and what it is that my
[3:08:11] heart desires to see and I I think it so
[3:08:16] beautifully put if I was to use some
[3:08:19] scriptures in Ephesians the 4th chapter
[3:08:24] and I'd just like to read
[3:08:27] uh uh maybe the first seven
[3:08:32] verses and and this is Paul speaking he
[3:08:37] said I
[3:08:39] therefore the
[3:08:41] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[3:08:47] you ye walk
[3:08:49] worthy of the
[3:08:51] vocation wherewith ye are
[3:08:55] called and I like that because Paul puts
[3:08:58] every single one of
[3:09:00] us as part of
[3:09:02] it that we've all been called and we all
[3:09:06] have a vocation a vocation a work
[3:09:10] something that that fits the
[3:09:15] characteristics and the gifts
[3:09:18] that God's given us a vocations he said
[3:09:21] like a calling that that called calls
[3:09:25] you and he goes on to speak that we walk
[3:09:28] worthy of
[3:09:30] that that we realize that when when we
[3:09:34] let our flesh get in the way we're not
[3:09:36] walking worthy of the calling and we
[3:09:39] want to be Overcomers and and do better
[3:09:43] and then he goes on to say with all
[3:09:45] lowliness and meekness
[3:09:48] and
[3:09:49] longsuffering
[3:09:50] forbearing one another in
[3:09:55] love and again it he's talking about
[3:10:00] this
[3:10:02] Unity that the body of Believers have
[3:10:06] that each one of us is
[3:10:09] upholding the truth of the
[3:10:12] Gospel that we
[3:10:15] might Adorn
[3:10:17] the doctrines of God and then he says
[3:10:22] endeavoring to keep the
[3:10:24] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[3:10:30] endeavoring to keep the unity of of the
[3:10:34] spirit in the bond of Peace see as he's
[3:10:37] speaking here he's not leaving anybody
[3:10:39] out there there's not smart there's not
[3:10:43] foolish there's not better there's not
[3:10:47] ver we're all in it together and he goes
[3:10:52] on he says this he says there is one
[3:11:00] body there's one
[3:11:04] body and one
[3:11:07] Spirit even as ye are called in one
[3:11:12] hope of your calling one Lord
[3:11:17] One
[3:11:19] Faith one
[3:11:21] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[3:11:26] above all and through all and in you
[3:11:33] all and you know I was fellowshipping
[3:11:36] the other morning with brother Mike
[3:11:40] Parks Junior and brother
[3:11:43] Jonathan and we got talking about the
[3:11:46] Oneness of the
[3:11:48] body when a body of Believers can come
[3:11:52] in one Mind One Faith one Spirit have
[3:11:57] one goal the same
[3:12:00] absolute and that what we could
[3:12:05] be as a United one body One
[3:12:09] Voice you say well I have this job I
[3:12:13] speak that language how many different
[3:12:15] languages did we hear s
[3:12:18] singing why I I sat
[3:12:22] and the world doesn't know what they're
[3:12:24] missing the the voices the the talent
[3:12:28] the songs uh you know I mean I was just
[3:12:31] sitting back you know I think this side
[3:12:34] of my mouth touched this ear and this
[3:12:37] guy I mean I just couldn't believe my
[3:12:39] eyes I thought where's all these people
[3:12:41] been
[3:12:43] hiding you know and and we want to step
[3:12:46] forward
[3:12:48] you know what I mean and and and and and
[3:12:52] realize every day that we
[3:12:56] represent the message of the
[3:12:58] hour and God has
[3:13:01] identified himself with us by giving us
[3:13:05] the privilege to say that we are the
[3:13:09] bride and doesn't matter where we came
[3:13:13] from because there's one faith
[3:13:17] one
[3:13:19] baptism one word one message one
[3:13:24] truth and if we could come into that
[3:13:29] wholeness and and you've got to know
[3:13:32] you're a part of
[3:13:33] it if you don't say you're a part of the
[3:13:36] body then you're not but if if we would
[3:13:39] all go all
[3:13:40] in for this gospel if we would go all in
[3:13:46] to sharing ing
[3:13:48] this message if we would go all in to
[3:13:52] have our candles burn
[3:13:54] bright if all of us would agree to that
[3:13:58] one
[3:14:00] thing you know I I thought of uh
[3:14:04] brother Manasses and and sister zier you
[3:14:08] know uh he he's he represents our
[3:14:13] country he's a soldier and and I I
[3:14:17] appreciate your service and and your
[3:14:20] duty and and what you do I respect that
[3:14:24] I respect and I want to respect whatever
[3:14:28] station or place that a person is that
[3:14:32] there's no Envy there's no jealousies
[3:14:34] there's no no no despising one another
[3:14:40] but if we could become this one the
[3:14:43] prophet of God said that's what brings
[3:14:46] the rapture
[3:14:51] is when we come into that great union
[3:14:56] doesn't hurt to die to
[3:14:58] yourself he's got you nothing can pluck
[3:15:02] you out of the palm of his hand so we
[3:15:07] just just in and I I want our our what
[3:15:12] we want to go into the
[3:15:15] storehouse and
[3:15:17] bring out if the Holy Spirit would help
[3:15:20] us is the things that bring
[3:15:23] us to that
[3:15:25] Unity that our lights could shine and
[3:15:29] our good works could glorify Our Father
[3:15:33] in Heaven that each believer in this
[3:15:37] building would have the confidence to
[3:15:40] testify of the word of God to lay your
[3:15:43] hands on the sick to pray for others and
[3:15:47] that the works of God would not be in
[3:15:50] this place but they would be manifested
[3:15:53] that we will not light our candle and
[3:15:56] put it under a bush basket but that
[3:15:59] we'll let our light so shine that our
[3:16:03] good works might glorify Our Father in
[3:16:06] heaven and let me tell you no matter how
[3:16:09] smart they are someone was telling me
[3:16:11] the other day how smart Elon Musk was oh
[3:16:15] he's a genius he's really smart I said
[3:16:17] Elon Musk is
[3:16:22] stupid he's bone head
[3:16:28] stupid he wants to try to go to
[3:16:33] Mars why waste billions of dollars in
[3:16:36] Mars when you can go so fast past Mars
[3:16:41] so far out of this universe for free
[3:16:47] don't give me that light you know he
[3:16:51] wants to create batteries and all this
[3:16:53] that produces light well I got something
[3:16:55] This Little Light of Mine you know I
[3:16:58] mean it'll shine in
[3:17:00] darkness you know what I mean and and
[3:17:03] then what does it profit the whole man
[3:17:06] if he can gain the whole world and lose
[3:17:08] his soul he ain't smart if he was
[3:17:12] smart he would find the closet somewhere
[3:17:17] find an
[3:17:18] altar and then he would sell all that he
[3:17:21] had and give it to the poor and come
[3:17:24] follow him don't forget what smart
[3:17:28] really
[3:17:30] is the wisdom of God is foolishness to
[3:17:35] man and the wisdom of man is foolishness
[3:17:38] to God so don't forget who you are and
[3:17:41] what you're a part of and and that God
[3:17:46] created us us to be a body fitted and
[3:17:49] joined together so and that's what my
[3:17:53] heart's desire is is that we can all
[3:17:56] come into this Oneness and that the Holy
[3:17:59] Spirit would go into the storehouse of
[3:18:02] God's
[3:18:03] word the word that God left
[3:18:06] us by and he left it to us
[3:18:12] himself people say brother brandom left
[3:18:14] it to us no Jesus left it to us
[3:18:19] himself he the Lord Jesus came veiled
[3:18:23] himself that's right and hid
[3:18:26] himself in a
[3:18:28] vessel as as as he said a veil a human
[3:18:33] flesh Veil and broke the Mysteries to us
[3:18:37] stored up the word of God for us that
[3:18:40] all of us could Feast so there's no
[3:18:44] reason for any of us to go hungry and
[3:18:47] there's every reason for us to look out
[3:18:50] after one another so let's become one
[3:18:54] lot of churches lot of places all over
[3:18:57] the world and we we we wish every single
[3:19:02] one of them well that they prosper and
[3:19:06] that they be in good health but what I'm
[3:19:11] concerned about is is as for me and my
[3:19:17] house we'll serve the Lord and for as
[3:19:21] far as our body's concerned we will stay
[3:19:24] with the word we will stay with the
[3:19:27] message we will look for into the
[3:19:30] storehouse to have the things that make
[3:19:34] us more Christlike and so I just trust
[3:19:38] that that this coming year that that you
[3:19:42] would make a greater effort
[3:19:46] to be a part of the local body that you
[3:19:51] wouldd make a greater effort to
[3:19:55] contribute not
[3:19:57] financially but
[3:19:59] spiritually by coming in service
[3:20:02] prepared
[3:20:04] worshiping letting the your light shine
[3:20:08] that you would become more involved in
[3:20:11] the body by praying one for another and
[3:20:15] looking out after one another another
[3:20:17] that you would come to such a place that
[3:20:20] you would say this is my family this is
[3:20:23] my
[3:20:24] people amen this is who I'm going to
[3:20:27] spend eternity with and I want to serve
[3:20:30] and love one another because you'll know
[3:20:35] that you are my
[3:20:37] disciples by your love for one another
[3:20:41] and our dedication to the word of God
[3:20:44] I'm not ashamed of this message
[3:20:47] cuz it's the power of God un salvation
[3:20:51] and I just trust that we can all come
[3:20:53] into that where we're all giving of
[3:20:56] ourselves one to another we live right
[3:21:00] for one another we do right for one
[3:21:04] another we pray for one another without
[3:21:08] ceasing and I pray with all my heart
