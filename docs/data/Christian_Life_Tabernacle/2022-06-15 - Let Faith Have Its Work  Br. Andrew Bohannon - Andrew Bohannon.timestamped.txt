[46:08] this service in the blessed wonderful
[46:10] name of the lord jesus christ we do pray
[46:13] amen
[46:14] praise god
[46:17] well if you have your bibles we'll go
[46:19] right to the word
[46:20] certainly appreciate that testimony and
[46:23] the testimonies uh
[46:25] um
[46:27] it's just a marvelous thing to think
[46:29] that someone who would be suffering in a
[46:32] trial for so many years and
[46:34] god so merciful to provide a way that
[46:37] you can feel your feet again
[46:40] praise god
[46:42] and even just
[46:44] thinking about
[46:45] how mindful he is even of the little
[46:47] things to
[46:48] to
[46:50] deal with our brother in such a special
[46:52] way isn't isn't that the way god does
[46:55] how many can testify here that's god's
[46:57] been personal to you
[46:58] amen praise god i'm thankful we serve a
[47:01] personal god
[47:03] amen
[47:05] well we won't keep you long we just
[47:06] trust that the things that the lord's
[47:08] put upon our heart will be a blessing to
[47:10] you and that we can enter into a little
[47:12] time of fellowship with the lord and
[47:16] if you want to open your bibles we're
[47:17] just going to take a little thought out
[47:19] of the gospel of luke in chapter 11.
[47:32] certainly been enjoying the
[47:35] the way the lord's been dealing with the
[47:37] ministry
[47:39] it's
[47:39] been a blessing to me
[47:41] we're going to read there in
[47:44] verse 33
[47:46] of chapter 11.
[47:48] the scripture says
[47:50] no man
[47:52] when he had
[47:54] lit and lighted a candle put it
[47:57] in a secret place
[47:59] neither under a bushel
[48:01] but on a candlestick
[48:03] that they which come in may see the
[48:06] light
[48:08] amen you may have your sheets we trust
[48:09] the lord will
[48:10] add a blessing to the reading of his
[48:12] word
[48:13] yeah i just thought it's so special in
[48:15] the
[48:16] different gospels they referred to that
[48:18] scripture if you don't mind leaving it
[48:20] up on the board for a minute
[48:22] it just
[48:29] made me think about it
[48:31] today and
[48:33] i was thinking about
[48:35] when the lord put it on our brother
[48:36] benoit to share the things that the lord
[48:39] put on his heart and
[48:41] you know he read out of the quote about
[48:44] you know
[48:45] don't wait till your candles burn down
[48:47] or have burned down but go and tell them
[48:49] how it got lived
[48:51] amen isn't that wonderful
[48:54] you know and to think there was a man
[48:56] that lit that candle
[48:58] is there a man here tonight that if your
[49:01] candle is not lit you can light your
[49:03] candle
[49:05] amen
[49:06] isn't it wonderful that the word of god
[49:08] isn't just psychology where you can just
[49:10] take it and it can be a concept
[49:13] and that you can just grasp it and say
[49:15] well
[49:16] i i can agree with that
[49:19] but praise god there's a god that'll
[49:21] come behind it and make it live
[49:24] amen
[49:26] oh i'll tell you i'm i'm starting to get
[49:28] a little fired up because i see a saint
[49:30] here oh my that didn't have much hope
[49:33] and oh
[49:34] i remember the lord just put it on our
[49:37] hearts and i i could just tell you this
[49:39] is to the glory of god but a bag full of
[49:42] pills that the science only through
[49:45] science and and intellect of man that
[49:48] that was their only provided way to
[49:51] bring uh uh an answer to to a sick body
[49:55] to to to to bring some kind of uh
[49:58] healing virtue but praise god
[50:02] there was a living god on the scene
[50:05] the same god that's
[50:07] that's that's here tonight amen oh
[50:10] oh i'm just i i can't help but hardly
[50:14] even say it because i tell you
[50:17] you know the testimonies of god just
[50:19] bring you into his presence i i i have
[50:21] to say it i'm so i i was longing for the
[50:24] day to see brother jackson's mom and
[50:26] service
[50:27] hallelujah you know i seen her in a
[50:30] place of
[50:31] absolute despair she might not even
[50:34] remembered it but there was something in
[50:36] my heart that said i'll see her in
[50:37] church hey man you know when when uh the
[50:41] the vision of the people
[50:43] in the world they just they can only see
[50:45] so far but thank god there's a faith
[50:48] that god has brought in this end time
[50:50] that we can look beyond circumstance and
[50:52] we don't have to force god's hand to
[50:54] come and do it when we want it but god
[50:57] is sovereign god can move any time any
[51:00] place at any hour and he always moves
[51:03] according to his word amen
[51:05] praise be to god he's alive to do for
[51:08] you exceedingly and abundantly
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:12] praise god
[51:14] i'm grateful to see you sis
[51:17] praise god
[51:18] god is so wonderful he's got so much
[51:20] more for us hallelujah

[51:24] hallelujah
[51:26] you just claim your you claim your
[51:28] promise
[51:30] brother jackson that's our promise
[51:32] we're not leaving one hoof behind
[51:34] hallelujah
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:42] god's word has a creative power when
[51:45] it's in a believer's heart and he's not
[51:48] fearful of what man can do amen
[51:51] he's not afraid of the yesterday he's
[51:54] not concerned about his tomorrow
[51:57] he's willing to give off
[51:59] in a life of full surrender
[52:01] say i might not be able to see it like i
[52:03] ought to but praise god my god is in my
[52:06] heart he started to work and he's
[52:09] faithful to finish it because that's his
[52:10] word
[52:11] amen even if god is just barely tugged
[52:14] on your heart to say you know what i
[52:16] want jesus to come and live in my heart
[52:19] hey that's enough oh god to start a fire
[52:22] of a flame to take you all the way to
[52:24] glory hallelujah
[52:28] we got witnesses here tonight
[52:31] you did it for me
[52:33] he'll do it for you
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:36] amen
[52:39] praise god
[52:40] we're uh
[52:42] we're thinking of a little thought
[52:44] that's on our heart to to let faith go
[52:47] to work
[52:49] amen god didn't just give us a
[52:51] fulfillment at the end time to see the
[52:54] word coming to flesh
[52:56] to
[52:57] to put seven angels in the cloud in the
[53:00] sky to vindicate his presence to give us
[53:02] a vision of a statue of a perfect man to
[53:05] vindicate himself that he's identified
[53:08] again with man he's not to be ashamed to
[53:10] be called our god
[53:14] and we want to let this revelation go to
[53:16] work
[53:20] we're not waiting for somebody else to
[53:22] do it what's my part
[53:26] the bible says these signs shall follow
[53:28] them that believe
[53:29] in my name
[53:33] there's no other name under heaven where
[53:36] man must be saved
[53:38] that's in the name of the lord jesus
[53:40] christ what a precious name to be able
[53:42] to to name the name of jesus oh my
[53:46] you think about how good it feels to
[53:48] name your name but oh when that jesus
[53:50] christ names your name
[53:52] after this is all said and done oh isn't
[53:54] that what we're living for
[53:57] enter into the joys of the lord that's
[53:59] been prepared for you before the
[54:00] foundation of the world
[54:04] amen
[54:08] amen
[54:12] you know something that
[54:20] praise god something that uh
[54:22] we're listening to why christ speak it
[54:26] it just put like a focal point
[54:29] and uh
[54:31] you know he says we're living
[54:33] we've lived the time out
[54:35] the time of the rapture is at hand and
[54:38] we're looking for a rapturing faith that
[54:41] can pull the church together and give it
[54:43] some supernatural strength to to that
[54:46] can change these bodies that we may live
[54:51] amen isn't that what we're looking for
[54:55] you know when god comes on the scene and
[54:58] you you have a need and
[55:00] it might be sickness
[55:02] it might be financial trouble
[55:04] might be relationships
[55:06] and yet you can place upon the altar
[55:10] your need to a god that can answer back
[55:14] it's not some
[55:16] fictitious something it's not some
[55:18] emotional concept
[55:21] but it's a god that cares that's right
[55:24] it's an on-time god
[55:30] amen
[55:33] now we're looking to let this faith go
[55:36] to work amen
[55:38] and the scripture says there in john 15
[55:40] and in seven and eight it says if you
[55:43] abide in me and my word abide in you
[55:47] ye
[55:48] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[55:51] done unto you hearing is my father
[55:53] glorified that you bear much fruit
[55:57] so shall ye be my disciples amen
[56:00] and and it just it's it's amazing
[56:02] sometimes people you know they get to
[56:04] where they're thinking about something
[56:06] and they like you know think about what
[56:08] you like a subject you know if you like
[56:10] sports or if you like drama or if you
[56:13] like music
[56:15] you're constantly dwelling on it and
[56:16] sometimes you might even just be
[56:18] daydreaming or dreaming and you know but
[56:20] you're dwelling on it and the scripture
[56:22] is saying here if you abide in me amen
[56:25] you know there's there's a lot of
[56:27] thoughts that come that are contrary to
[56:28] god's promises for us but let's listen
[56:31] let's when when a man can take the faith
[56:34] the revelation of this hour and see that
[56:37] i can't i can't manifest until i hear it
[56:41] because faith cometh by hearing and
[56:44] hearing the word of god
[56:46] so if i would consecrate myself to a
[56:48] time
[56:50] where i can let the word minister to my
[56:53] heart
[56:54] amen
[56:57] that way we can let that faith go to
[56:59] work
[57:00] amen
[57:03] praise god
[57:12] you know i was thinking about this
[57:14] scripture in james um
[57:16] james chapter 2 and in verse 14
[57:22] you know we're thinking about how that
[57:25] you know we need to have rapturing faith
[57:27] and god's provided it
[57:30] in this end time
[57:31] because we're a people
[57:34] that are not set for destruction
[57:37] aren't you thankful
[57:39] there's a people
[57:40] that we the world bride
[57:42] they're heaping up their judgment
[57:44] they're making preparation for a
[57:46] tribulation
[57:47] praise god but aren't you grateful that
[57:49] there's rapturing faith in the in the
[57:51] word of god
[57:53] that'll take and it will you know it's
[57:55] an applied faith right it's not oh well
[57:58] i'm feeding on the messages i'm feeding
[58:00] on the messages
[58:02] and i think that's that's exactly where
[58:04] the the message we were just listening
[58:06] to why christ speak
[58:08] moses
[58:09] he knew because
[58:12] intellectually his mom
[58:14] told him
[58:16] say you were born a proper child
[58:18] you were born a deliverer
[58:21] it's been prophesied that after 400
[58:24] years and you're the you're the one that
[58:26] had this certain
[58:28] uh
[58:29] birth
[58:30] and and
[58:32] god even by faith they they put him out
[58:35] on the the
[58:37] you know the
[58:38] the river and the water they didn't fear
[58:41] because it was by faith
[58:43] and so that that's that's what we want
[58:46] we want to apply the faith that's been
[58:49] been taught through this pulpit and
[58:51] that's taught through the word of god
[58:53] and the message we want to actually
[58:56] let it live go to work for us amen
[59:00] yes sir
[59:01] praise god
[59:06] see the predestinated now this is out of
[59:08] why christ speak he says see the
[59:10] predestinated seed is laying there and
[59:13] when the light struck it it come to life
[59:16] and you can't keep it down you can't
[59:19] hide it amen isn't that wonderful that
[59:22] there's seeds in the ground
[59:24] that when the light strikes it you can't
[59:26] hide it because it was ordained to come
[59:29] forth whatever the seed is is ordained
[59:32] to come forth
[59:34] amen
[59:35] so there's a people that are
[59:37] predestinated to eternal life
[59:39] you're predestinated to express the
[59:42] risen savior
[59:47] it doesn't matter if concrete was laying
[59:50] there
[59:51] you could see it doesn't matter if
[59:54] sickness was laying on that seed it
[59:56] doesn't matter if if genetics
[59:59] of family
[1:00:00] sin or history or whatever it doesn't
[1:00:03] matter that you were in dead and in
[1:00:04] bondage
[1:00:06] the predestinated seed had to come forth
[1:00:09] when the light crossed its path
[1:00:11] what happened it come forth
[1:00:15] now it shines and rises to the glory of
[1:00:18] god amen
[1:00:19] ain't that wonderful
[1:00:22] the life of christ praise me to god
[1:00:25] there's there's a hope of glory
[1:00:27] at this end time what is the hope of
[1:00:30] glory
[1:00:31] it's christ in you
[1:00:33] christ in me
[1:00:35] you say well what do you mean
[1:00:37] christ in me christ in you
[1:00:39] you know i got to thinking about
[1:00:41] you know there was a young man and
[1:00:44] you know i i
[1:00:46] you know he might not feel like he's uh
[1:00:49] amounted to much as far as christian
[1:00:52] but i saw god moving in him don't you
[1:00:54] love to see god moving in your brother
[1:00:56] and sister
[1:00:58] young or old middle-aged
[1:01:01] white black boy girl
[1:01:04] boy i just see the love to see the risen
[1:01:06] savior doing what he said there's
[1:01:08] something in my heart that says hey man
[1:01:10] praise god
[1:01:13] and he just
[1:01:14] you know
[1:01:16] the enemy tried to discourage him
[1:01:19] you know that's what
[1:01:20] that's what his job is is to bring an
[1:01:22] opposition to come in and to fight at
[1:01:24] you
[1:01:25] but praise god there's something in us
[1:01:28] that's greater
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:31] he had a
[1:01:34] he had some opposition say well
[1:01:38] you know
[1:01:39] they treated me wrong
[1:01:41] i said well
[1:01:43] that's probably so that's probably right
[1:01:46] you know
[1:01:47] in life
[1:01:48] life's full of difficulties life's not
[1:01:50] fair
[1:01:51] there's a lot of things that
[1:01:53] can happen in life
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:56] you can't make sense of it
[1:01:59] and i just encourage them i said you
[1:02:00] know
[1:02:02] there's christ in you want to forgive
[1:02:04] them will you let him live
[1:02:07] will you let him go to work
[1:02:09] and he looked at me he's like well
[1:02:11] all right
[1:02:13] and i didn't i just left it there
[1:02:15] but praise god
[1:02:16] our god is alive and well
[1:02:19] and you know what
[1:02:20] i could stand back and i could say i
[1:02:22] seen christ in my brother he was willing
[1:02:25] to let go and let god is there somebody
[1:02:28] here tonight willing to let go and let
[1:02:31] god
[1:02:32] god is wanting to pour out his blessings
[1:02:35] upon our lives that's right
[1:02:37] sometimes there's little things that are
[1:02:38] holding us from receiving the eternal
[1:02:42] word of god and the word of life to
[1:02:44] resist wrecked us out of the condition
[1:02:47] that we're currently in
[1:02:51] god has a great
[1:02:52] tree that he wants to bear forth fruit
[1:02:55] he said abide in me
[1:02:58] and you can ask what you will that your
[1:03:01] fruit would remain that you'd be
[1:03:04] bearing much fruit
[1:03:09] well praise god
[1:03:11] who wants to be the the restored bride
[1:03:13] tree
[1:03:14] where somebody some passerby can come by
[1:03:18] take a little long suffering
[1:03:21] a little joy
[1:03:23] you you your little messiah you you
[1:03:27] individually every single one of you
[1:03:29] have creative power to create an
[1:03:31] atmosphere where the sinner can come in
[1:03:34] where the sick can come in
[1:03:38] where those who are discouraged those
[1:03:40] who don't have a hope those who are
[1:03:42] walking in darkness those who have no
[1:03:44] certainty you can say my god is able
[1:03:48] even now
[1:03:50] even now
[1:03:51] he can come and break those shackles
[1:03:55] he did it for me
[1:03:57] there's something here tonight called
[1:03:59] grace
[1:04:01] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[1:04:04] that saved the wretch like me
[1:04:07] praise god
[1:04:09] praise god
[1:04:16] when the light strikes the seed
[1:04:19] you know
[1:04:20] this word
[1:04:22] is not light
[1:04:24] until it's vindicated or brought to pass
[1:04:28] so when it's promised
[1:04:30] that at the end time there would be a
[1:04:32] people
[1:04:33] that
[1:04:34] would be called they god would not be
[1:04:37] ashamed to be called their god
[1:04:40] those who actually look to the word of
[1:04:43] god
[1:04:44] and worship the true and living god
[1:04:46] not a god of the past
[1:04:49] not far off but right now
[1:04:54] he's not ashamed to become
[1:04:56] their god hallelujah
[1:05:00] so when that light
[1:05:02] when that word
[1:05:04] is comes to pass
[1:05:06] like we see
[1:05:07] malachi 4
[1:05:10] we see
[1:05:12] revelations 10 7.
[1:05:14] what does it do
[1:05:15] when it goes apart across
[1:05:18] your path you see
[1:05:21] i was in the word of god
[1:05:24] and god brought it to pass
[1:05:26] something on the inside begins to
[1:05:28] identify
[1:05:30] that
[1:05:31] there's something in here that that i
[1:05:33] believe that
[1:05:35] and what goes to work
[1:05:37] belief
[1:05:38] faith in the word of god and and all of
[1:05:41] a sudden now it's just like
[1:05:43] god did it then he's got something for
[1:05:45] me now
[1:05:46] do you believe that god has something
[1:05:48] for you right now
[1:05:51] god has something for us right now he's
[1:05:54] uniting us together in christian love
[1:05:57] in the faith that was once delivered to
[1:05:59] the saints
[1:06:00] he's bringing us to a restoration
[1:06:03] of faith
[1:06:04] that we can put it in action amen to
[1:06:07] where we can let the faith that's been
[1:06:10] given
[1:06:11] loose and go out to work amen
[1:06:14] isn't that wonderful there was somebody
[1:06:17] that was all bound up and we referred to
[1:06:20] her as the woman at the well
[1:06:22] and she
[1:06:23] came and it was her hour
[1:06:25] of quickening it was her hour to be
[1:06:27] brought to life
[1:06:29] and you know what
[1:06:30] on that visit it was just another day
[1:06:33] that's true
[1:06:34] wasn't it like that for you it was just
[1:06:36] another day of your life
[1:06:38] and you you didn't know that you were
[1:06:40] predestinated you didn't know that you
[1:06:43] were ordained to life
[1:06:44] you didn't know that he had precious
[1:06:46] promises for you
[1:06:48] you didn't know that he had a hair
[1:06:50] inheritance for you you didn't know that
[1:06:52] he had a family for you to come in and
[1:06:54] be a part of to minister to to be
[1:06:57] ministered to
[1:06:58] hallelujah to be able to be
[1:07:01] fruit-bearing
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:05] to be able to be satisfied with life
[1:07:08] oh yeah
[1:07:10] you were looking here and there and
[1:07:13] everywhere
[1:07:14] but oh my when that light came across
[1:07:17] your path
[1:07:18] that's what happened with her she said
[1:07:20] we know that when the messiah comes
[1:07:24] he'll do these things but who are
[1:07:26] you i'm he
[1:07:29] oh my that sets something in her to
[1:07:31] working
[1:07:33] and then that discernment became to work
[1:07:35] him
[1:07:37] oh my
[1:07:38] he's the revealer of the thoughts and
[1:07:40] intents of the heart
[1:07:42] oh my when that light
[1:07:45] struck that seed
[1:07:46] something came
[1:07:48] something came forth what was it
[1:07:51] the resurrection brought that seed to
[1:07:53] life she said come see a man
[1:07:56] who told me all i've ever done oh oh
[1:07:59] that candle was lit
[1:08:01] who lit the candle she didn't light it
[1:08:04] you didn't light your candle
[1:08:07] god came to you
[1:08:08] in your dark hour
[1:08:10] god came to me
[1:08:15] no man lighted the candle
[1:08:19] and set it under a bushel
[1:08:21] so the work that god did when he lit us
[1:08:24] is to be on full display
[1:08:26] because it's the light away
[1:08:30] ain't that wonderful
[1:08:32] ye are the light of the world
[1:08:34] young people
[1:08:36] middle age
[1:08:37] olders
[1:08:39] god has a purpose
[1:08:41] that he wants to shine a light in your
[1:08:43] world there's people in your world that
[1:08:46] need to see the light of god
[1:08:49] at this end time
[1:08:51] a lot of people were pointing back
[1:08:53] to a jesus 2000 years ago
[1:08:57] but where is the dwelling place of the
[1:08:58] living god
[1:09:01] where is his voice
[1:09:03] where is the voice of the resurrection
[1:09:06] at the end time
[1:09:16] there's a people
[1:09:18] joshua and caleb
[1:09:20] they were given the promise
[1:09:22] of a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:09:25] and whenever they came and got divine
[1:09:27] fulfillment
[1:09:28] they seen the evidence of the land that
[1:09:30] it's real
[1:09:32] and no matter the opposition
[1:09:35] no matter the report
[1:09:37] of the the other 10 spies
[1:09:41] it says
[1:09:42] our god is more than able we're not
[1:09:45] trusting in our own works we're not
[1:09:47] trusting in our ability to know god is
[1:09:50] the one that brings revelation
[1:09:53] our job is to ask
[1:09:55] this is according to your word
[1:10:04] praise god
[1:10:08] in james chapter 2
[1:10:10] it speaks about
[1:10:12] we'll just read it right here
[1:10:16] chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:10:20] you love the lord
[1:10:22] amen i love the word because it it
[1:10:24] brings a clear vision
[1:10:27] you know and you your life experiences
[1:10:29] and circumstances that you face today
[1:10:32] sometimes are trying to
[1:10:34] to to make your faith void
[1:10:38] but praise god god is here to make it
[1:10:40] live
[1:10:42] in that wonderful god is here to make
[1:10:45] your faith go to work
[1:10:48] to to to receive your inheritance and
[1:10:51] that others
[1:10:53] can see
[1:10:54] that god is not
[1:10:56] dead
[1:10:57] god is living
[1:10:58] and he's able to do according to his
[1:11:00] promises
[1:11:03] the scripture says what doeth that
[1:11:05] prophet my brother and though a man say
[1:11:07] you have faith and have not works
[1:11:09] can faith save him
[1:11:11] if a brother or sister be naked and
[1:11:13] destitute of daily food
[1:11:15] and one of you say to him depart in
[1:11:17] peace
[1:11:18] be ye warm and filled notwithstanding
[1:11:22] you give him give them not those things
[1:11:25] which are needful to the body
[1:11:27] what doeth it profit
[1:11:30] even so faith if it hath not works it is
[1:11:34] dead being alone
[1:11:36] yeah a man may say thou ha
[1:11:39] thou has faith and i have works show me
[1:11:42] thy faith without thy works and i'll
[1:11:45] show you
[1:11:47] the my faith by my works
[1:11:51] thou believers that there is one god
[1:11:54] thou do us well the devils also believe
[1:11:56] in tremble
[1:11:57] but will thou o vain man
[1:12:00] that
[1:12:01] faith without works is dead
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:06] was not abraham our father justified by
[1:12:09] works when he had offered isaac his son
[1:12:13] upon the altar
[1:12:15] see now
[1:12:16] how
[1:12:17] faith wrought
[1:12:19] with his works and by works was faith
[1:12:23] made perfect
[1:12:25] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:12:27] saith abraham believed god and it was
[1:12:29] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:12:32] he was called the friend of god
[1:12:34] see
[1:12:35] then how that the works
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] that by works a man is justified and not
[1:12:42] by faith only likewise also
[1:12:45] was not
[1:12:47] rahab the harlot justified by works when
[1:12:50] she had received the messengers and sent
[1:12:52] them on their way
[1:12:53] but as the body without the spirit so
[1:12:56] faith without works is dead also you
[1:12:58] know and i just think about what why
[1:13:00] christ brother banham talking about
[1:13:03] how that we got
[1:13:05] moses
[1:13:07] moses was ordained to be the deliverer
[1:13:12] you know and
[1:13:13] he knew it from the intellectual side
[1:13:16] and there's a lot of promises that we
[1:13:18] know on the intellectual side and god
[1:13:20] uses that channel of intellect because
[1:13:23] it has to drop past the intellect
[1:13:25] because faith cometh by hearing but we
[1:13:27] wanted to sink past the intellect and
[1:13:30] come down where this faith can go to
[1:13:32] work amen because if we're just doing it
[1:13:36] then it's
[1:13:37] it can be undone and if god's gonna do
[1:13:39] it amen that's an eternal permanent work
[1:13:43] amen because we're not looking just to
[1:13:45] to soothe a temporary we we want to see
[1:13:49] that eternal work come to pass in our
[1:13:51] lives
[1:13:52] and the lives of our loved ones amen
[1:13:57] and so we just
[1:13:59] we think about moses and how
[1:14:02] you know he came to that place where
[1:14:06] you know he had that that intellect of
[1:14:09] trying to
[1:14:11] fulfill his purpose by intellect
[1:14:14] and you know that's the way we do
[1:14:17] that you know but we come to realize
[1:14:19] that
[1:14:20] that'll have to come to a failure
[1:14:23] because what good is it in a marriage if
[1:14:25] it's just
[1:14:26] one-sided right
[1:14:29] i mean
[1:14:30] one party's doing all the work
[1:14:33] like
[1:14:34] hey uh
[1:14:36] you know
[1:14:38] isn't it time for you to do this and
[1:14:39] that and the other well no
[1:14:41] this is a this is a uniting of the bride
[1:14:44] and the bridegroom you know god is so
[1:14:47] orchestrated this thing
[1:14:49] to where
[1:14:50] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:14:57] and moses got to the place where he
[1:14:59] realized that he was a failure in that
[1:15:01] way
[1:15:03] you know and that's where we come to
[1:15:05] you know we come to a place where
[1:15:08] our weakness we're made strong in
[1:15:10] weakness and it's no longer our excuses
[1:15:13] i can't talk
[1:15:15] yeah i stutter
[1:15:17] you know what whatever your excuse is
[1:15:20] but god has deposited
[1:15:23] a gift of faith
[1:15:25] amen that you can hear the word of god
[1:15:29] and you can look beyond the
[1:15:30] impossibility of man
[1:15:33] and see
[1:15:35] there's another resource of life amen
[1:15:39] praise god that
[1:15:42] your your special
[1:15:44] class of people
[1:15:46] that believe for the impossible
[1:15:49] even even as our brother orlando they're
[1:15:53] going out
[1:15:54] to virginia
[1:15:56] how many believe that god is going to
[1:15:58] touch that situation
[1:16:01] i believe it
[1:16:04] i believe that
[1:16:06] god wouldn't have brother orlando drive
[1:16:08] all the way that and do all of that
[1:16:11] and his word not come to pass
[1:16:14] how about in your life
[1:16:16] how about your situation
[1:16:19] you know if we just try to do it
[1:16:21] the way we think it needs to be done
[1:16:24] it'll come out of failure
[1:16:27] but if there's a need
[1:16:29] he said if you call
[1:16:31] upon the name of the lord
[1:16:33] you shall be saved
[1:16:35] and all power was given unto him
[1:16:38] and now where's the authority
[1:16:41] in the heart of the believers i see
[1:16:43] believers tonight that can be defense
[1:16:45] makers in their world
[1:16:47] if they'll let the faith
[1:16:49] go to work amen you know i it so blessed
[1:16:52] me when our pastor said you know
[1:16:54] sometimes we let the little things in
[1:16:56] life the bills and all of the
[1:16:59] responsibilities and the tax all this
[1:17:01] stuff it it makes
[1:17:04] it it brings like a littleness to our
[1:17:06] world
[1:17:07] but but when you have
[1:17:10] faith as a mustard seed
[1:17:12] you can move mountains
[1:17:17] and the enemies just trying to get us
[1:17:18] all huddled up
[1:17:20] in our own little world
[1:17:23] how the enemy has afflicted us
[1:17:26] and caused all this grief
[1:17:28] and yet we've been commissioned
[1:17:30] to bring satan's kingdom down
[1:17:35] you're more than a conqueror
[1:17:37] through christ jesus who loved us
[1:17:40] praise god
[1:17:43] we just need a personal contact and
[1:17:45] that's what moses needed
[1:17:47] moses knew intellectually that he was
[1:17:49] the deliverer
[1:17:51] he was the one ordained for the job
[1:17:54] but then when
[1:17:56] he had that
[1:17:57] personal meeting with the lord
[1:18:01] can you imagine how much of a wreck
[1:18:04] our lives were when we tried to do it
[1:18:06] without that personal meeting
[1:18:10] you know we end up slipping this way and
[1:18:12] slipping this way
[1:18:15] but he's ordained it that we would
[1:18:17] take his yoke upon us
[1:18:20] that would be
[1:18:21] you know that yoke is an interesting
[1:18:23] thing because it has the two and you're
[1:18:25] going at this thing together
[1:18:27] you know isn't it wonderful he said i'll
[1:18:29] never leave you nor forsake you
[1:18:31] i'll be with you even in you that's a
[1:18:33] great comfort to me
[1:18:35] sometimes you feel like you're going
[1:18:37] down roads all alone
[1:18:41] because you're not alone
[1:18:43] what a comforter
[1:18:50] see
[1:18:52] he
[1:18:54] this is i believe uh paragraph 48 he
[1:18:58] tried through his intellectual
[1:18:59] experience with the word he tried to
[1:19:01] bring them out
[1:19:02] and deliver them because he knew he was
[1:19:04] born for that purpose he knew that the
[1:19:07] time the scripture all said that he had
[1:19:09] already had 400 years just
[1:19:12] as we know now
[1:19:14] as a man asked a few moments ago about
[1:19:17] the coming and the rapture we know that
[1:19:19] we live the time out and the rapture is
[1:19:22] at hand we're looking for rapturing
[1:19:24] faith to pull the church together to
[1:19:26] give it some supernatural strength
[1:19:29] that'll change these bodies that we live
[1:19:32] in you know i was just the other day you
[1:19:34] know with this heat wave and you know
[1:19:35] you get little aches and pains you know
[1:19:37] you're working but praise god that god
[1:19:39] could give you a vision you know hey
[1:19:43] this is not my final destination
[1:19:46] you know i don't have to continue in
[1:19:49] this
[1:19:50] dread and this just you know because i
[1:19:52] know how pain can get i i suffered with
[1:19:55] pain for a very long time
[1:19:57] before i knew the lord and really met
[1:19:59] the lord and knew that his power was
[1:20:01] still the same that he can deliver and
[1:20:04] he can heal
[1:20:05] and that thing sometimes gives you
[1:20:07] narrow vision
[1:20:09] amen don't don't you realize that the
[1:20:12] enemy is trying to box us in and give us
[1:20:14] narrow vision try try to give us some
[1:20:17] kind of shiny something to chase after
[1:20:19] in the world
[1:20:21] you know
[1:20:23] what what's over there oh is that
[1:20:26] oh is that
[1:20:27] that's a new job
[1:20:29] oh
[1:20:31] there's advancement
[1:20:34] look at oh new home
[1:20:37] you know comes
[1:20:39] new car
[1:20:40] you know
[1:20:41] what comes with all that is more
[1:20:42] responsibility more headache
[1:20:45] more thinking about this world
[1:20:47] i'm ready to blast out of here
[1:20:52] let me say it this way i'm getting ready
[1:20:54] to blast out of here god is still
[1:20:56] working on the inside
[1:20:58] bringing himself to the outside
[1:21:01] isn't that your testimony
[1:21:03] jesus working on the inside
[1:21:07] coming to the outside
[1:21:09] that's our hope of glory
[1:21:12] it's christ in me
[1:21:24] when we see god that can raise the dead
[1:21:28] off the floor or out of the yard
[1:21:31] and bring him back to life
[1:21:33] and present him before us
[1:21:36] when we see god who can take a cancer
[1:21:40] that ate a man to a shadow and raise him
[1:21:43] up
[1:21:44] strong healthy man
[1:21:46] that ought to give rapturing faith to
[1:21:48] the people
[1:21:52] well praise god
[1:21:56] i'm
[1:21:59] i am so glad to see you brother
[1:22:00] jackson's mom i tell you what there's
[1:22:02] something just it's wailing up in me
[1:22:04] it's years
[1:22:07] you you wait until you see
[1:22:09] if god puts a vision in your heart you
[1:22:11] hold to it
[1:22:12] you don't let nothing
[1:22:14] steal it away
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:29] see
[1:22:30] our schools of theology can never
[1:22:33] produce that yet they intellectually are
[1:22:35] all right
[1:22:37] but you've got to meet that light you've
[1:22:40] got to find that something amen isn't
[1:22:42] that what we're searching for more of
[1:22:46] is when the word
[1:22:48] comes to us
[1:22:49] and we say amen and we begin to testify
[1:22:53] of it
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:55] you know what by his stripes
[1:22:58] you are healed that's right
[1:23:01] god has died to deliver you
[1:23:05] from that mental oppression
[1:23:07] god has paid the price that you can ask
[1:23:11] whatever you have need of you need a job
[1:23:16] god is a provider
[1:23:22] see moses
[1:23:23] based his great call upon the word
[1:23:26] and it was great
[1:23:28] until one day he met this light and the
[1:23:31] very word itself spoke back to him
[1:23:35] then he got his anointing
[1:23:38] that anointing
[1:23:40] what that anointed what he had in him
[1:23:44] and on the inside the intellects that
[1:23:46] believed it the faith that he based
[1:23:50] that was based upon his belief in god
[1:23:53] that separated him from his mother
[1:23:55] and now when he strikes
[1:23:58] in the presence of this light it
[1:24:01] anointed
[1:24:02] that
[1:24:03] that he believed
[1:24:04] see
[1:24:05] and the anointing
[1:24:07] and he was commissioned
[1:24:09] amen isn't it wonderful that god comes
[1:24:12] personally to you and we've heard
[1:24:13] testimonies and i just you know i thank
[1:24:16] god i could even give a testimony i i
[1:24:18] remember when the lord put on my heart
[1:24:20] and
[1:24:21] you know was fellowshipping with the
[1:24:22] brother that was dear to us known him
[1:24:24] for years and we were doing some work
[1:24:26] together and
[1:24:27] it wasn't a necessarily a believer at
[1:24:29] the time but you know we were doing a
[1:24:32] job together and you know i heard on
[1:24:34] tape that god was a provider and i heard
[1:24:37] that god still raises the dead and he
[1:24:40] does the impossible and it says
[1:24:42] something in my heart that now there was
[1:24:45] there was a faith starting to rise up
[1:24:47] and i remember
[1:24:49] you know
[1:24:51] one of the tools gave way and it was an
[1:24:53] air compressor and we were in the middle
[1:24:55] of the job
[1:24:57] you know we were in the middle of the
[1:24:59] job
[1:25:00] and i i just said you know what we can't
[1:25:03] you can't clean up shop and throw all
[1:25:05] these other products away because it
[1:25:07] still needs to be completed and so i
[1:25:09] went over there and laid hands on the
[1:25:11] compressor
[1:25:15] brother tommy's here to testify
[1:25:19] god allowed that compressor to go to
[1:25:21] work after won't work
[1:25:23] i never heard it do that
[1:25:25] it just died right on the scene
[1:25:29] but you know what
[1:25:31] something in his heart started bubbling
[1:25:34] you know if you've ever witnessed a
[1:25:37] miracle
[1:25:38] there's something in your heart that
[1:25:39] says
[1:25:42] there's something in my heart that i
[1:25:44] want to speak i want to pray
[1:25:48] the brother testified he took his hat
[1:25:50] off prayed
[1:25:51] what was that
[1:25:53] that was a personal meeting
[1:25:54] and god spoke back by giving him his
[1:25:57] heart's desire
[1:26:02] i love god for that
[1:26:12] that anointed what he had believed
[1:26:15] and he was commissioned
[1:26:17] praise god i won't keep you much longer
[1:26:28] praise god
[1:26:30] you know
[1:26:32] i tell you what the
[1:26:35] you know in nature brother branham
[1:26:37] talked about how nature was one of his
[1:26:39] bibles
[1:26:41] and you know he said that i noticed that
[1:26:44] you know in nature
[1:26:46] um
[1:26:47] when they had these certain animals they
[1:26:49] were feeding off a certain land that
[1:26:51] they'd actually
[1:26:52] begin to
[1:26:54] be identified with what they feed on you
[1:26:56] know like the certain
[1:26:58] uh lambs or sheeps they would
[1:27:01] um
[1:27:02] you know or excuse me there it was the
[1:27:04] um
[1:27:05] it was deer in a certain country they
[1:27:07] would eat this brown
[1:27:09] blue type of grass or whatever it was
[1:27:12] and all of a sudden they began to
[1:27:15] uh
[1:27:16] be like the same as what they were
[1:27:18] feeding on in a certain coyote in a
[1:27:20] desert land or whatever it was kind of
[1:27:22] feeding on some red foliage or something
[1:27:24] and then they would take on kind of the
[1:27:26] same identity of what they were feeding
[1:27:29] and i thank god that
[1:27:31] god sent a man
[1:27:33] in this area that would give us
[1:27:36] spiritual food in due season he wouldn't
[1:27:38] take and filter the word of god but our
[1:27:40] pastor would lead us to the message of
[1:27:43] the hour
[1:27:44] and he would take the word of god and
[1:27:45] break it to our hearts in its simplicity
[1:27:48] i i'm a benefic a beneficiary of someone
[1:27:52] who's laid his life down for this gospel
[1:27:55] praise be to god and and he's it's an
[1:27:58] example to me like
[1:28:00] you see brother branham he gave his life
[1:28:03] as an offering it was a living sacrifice
[1:28:06] and now it's a it's a testament it's a
[1:28:09] testimony of what i want to do it's what
[1:28:12] we want to do
[1:28:15] isn't it worth consecrating and
[1:28:17] dedicating and cutting away turning
[1:28:19] loose
[1:28:20] from not obligating ourselves to things
[1:28:23] in this world
[1:28:25] not becoming enamored
[1:28:29] not letting it draw us in
[1:28:40] but we want to make a clear-cut decision
[1:28:43] for me and my house we're going to serve
[1:28:45] the lord
[1:28:46] every situation
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:59] you know brother branham makes this
[1:29:00] statement i
[1:29:01] i
[1:29:05] you know when he's when he saw when
[1:29:07] moses saw that he was a failure his
[1:29:09] faith kind of dropped back a little
[1:29:11] you know and just because you failed
[1:29:14] just because you've set out to do
[1:29:16] something for the lord and you knew you
[1:29:18] were called to it
[1:29:21] you know he said go into all the world
[1:29:24] preach the gospel
[1:29:26] and you know
[1:29:28] i've done i've made mistakes i've gone
[1:29:31] about it with the wrong approach
[1:29:34] haven't you done the same going out and
[1:29:36] just
[1:29:37] with the zeal of the lord ah you know
[1:29:39] we're just gonna
[1:29:41] convert the world
[1:29:45] but
[1:29:47] there's a predestinated seed
[1:29:49] as we grow we begin to refine our search
[1:29:54] as we're declaring the light of the
[1:29:56] gospel
[1:29:57] we take on the spirit of the word and we
[1:30:00] go and seek that's what was lost
[1:30:04] those that are on his great tally book
[1:30:07] the lamb's book of life amen
[1:30:10] want to have our
[1:30:11] faith to let our faith work
[1:30:14] for the promises amen
[1:30:19] see
[1:30:20] now god forgive me if this sounds sack
[1:30:23] religious
[1:30:24] i do not work on earth only through man
[1:30:27] i am divine yeah the branches and i only
[1:30:29] declare myself when i can find a man

[1:30:51] to see them

[1:31:00] god's will and good pleasure to give you
[1:31:04] the kingdom and he's given us a part in
[1:31:06] it

[1:32:32] you know
[1:32:34] when faith was
[1:32:36] active and
[1:32:39] an old-fashioned meeting of testimonies
[1:32:41] and the power of god and the blessings
[1:32:44] we've seen so many testimonies in the
[1:32:46] power of god to set people free from the
[1:32:49] bondages to to to bring them into the
[1:32:52] kingdom to to set them free from sin and
[1:32:55] the bondage of sin to really begin to
[1:32:58] see sons and daughters expressing like
[1:33:01] our brother billy priest about the duty
[1:33:03] of expression you know isn't it
[1:33:05] wonderful you know when when you begin
[1:33:08] to see this
[1:33:09] this
[1:33:10] light that's shown across their path and
[1:33:12] now there's a resurrection oh my
[1:33:15] it just sets us to a greater expectation
[1:33:18] every service
[1:33:19] every service who's next
[1:33:23] where's the next resurrection
[1:33:26] where's where's the light going to shine
[1:33:28] forth to bring about
[1:33:31] the christ
[1:33:32] in your life amen
[1:33:38] says
[1:33:42] in verse 16 or in paragraph 16 he says
[1:33:46] if i could look tonight
[1:33:49] it's the holy ghost bubbling if i could
[1:33:52] look out tonight and look at the great
[1:33:54] morning star the evening star yonder
[1:33:58] what makes you shine evening star
[1:34:01] he'll come back and say it's not me
[1:34:04] shining brother branham it's the sun
[1:34:06] shining on me
[1:34:08] that's what's doing it
[1:34:11] we have a old-fashioned meeting more
[1:34:14] testimonies in the power of god
[1:34:16] it isn't the people that's shining it's
[1:34:18] the holy ghost from heaven shining on
[1:34:21] the people
[1:34:24] giving light to this dark world in the
[1:34:27] absence of the son of god hallelujah
[1:34:30] right that's right that's what we need
[1:34:32] tonight is an old-fashioned bubbling up
[1:34:35] meeting i used to go
[1:34:37] when i was a pastor at the milton
[1:34:39] baptist church i stayed with a friend
[1:34:41] called the rights i used to go in the
[1:34:44] night way down the hill
[1:34:46] and when i'd go out there an old
[1:34:48] nightingale or a mockingbird we call
[1:34:51] them dare
[1:34:53] used to set a little old cedar bush
[1:34:56] where it turned in down below the barn
[1:34:59] and go about a half a mile on the hill
[1:35:03] they're the woods to the place and this
[1:35:05] little old nightingale
[1:35:07] sat there
[1:35:09] he was just
[1:35:10] once in a while the clouds
[1:35:12] the cloudy night he'd wait a while
[1:35:15] then he would
[1:35:17] just sing a song to the top of his voice
[1:35:20] and i began to study
[1:35:22] what made him do that
[1:35:25] it's a cloudy night in this bird his
[1:35:26] brother bran was just studying it was
[1:35:28] like man this bird
[1:35:30] all of a sudden he just breaks out in a
[1:35:33] song just as loud as he could
[1:35:36] he said what made him do that
[1:35:39] he said
[1:35:40] he sits there and looks towards the
[1:35:42] heavens through the night
[1:35:45] and whenever he can see
[1:35:47] one star shining he starts singing and
[1:35:50] knows there's a sun shining somewhere
[1:35:53] amen that's that's that's what happens
[1:35:56] with you and me when we hear the
[1:35:58] testimonies of god dealing with these
[1:36:01] children that have set their eyes
[1:36:04] above leonicia and they've looked and
[1:36:07] seen that a god is able and has
[1:36:10] fulfilled his promise
[1:36:13] and then it sings something in their
[1:36:14] heart to the top of their lungs oh glory
[1:36:17] to god
[1:36:24] because he knew the sun was shining
[1:36:27] somewhere
[1:36:28] there's a living god
[1:36:30] somewhere
[1:36:32] on earth
[1:36:33] amen
[1:36:35] hallelujah the same holy ghost power
[1:36:38] raised them up on the day of pentecost
[1:36:41] give them the blessing of god the power
[1:36:43] is
[1:36:44] still in existence somewhere
[1:36:47] and when you can see the church that's
[1:36:49] getting that's together with god what a
[1:36:52] marvelous thing god in his universe
[1:36:55] praise god isn't that wonderful
[1:36:58] you know i just
[1:37:02] i'm just going to go ahead and ask you
[1:37:04] if you want to stand we'll just invite
[1:37:06] the musicians
[1:37:12] you know the the
[1:37:14] moses when he
[1:37:16] he was the next pharaoh
[1:37:20] and he was ordained to
[1:37:22] lead the children out
[1:37:25] and yet he had the opportunity presented
[1:37:28] to him
[1:37:30] you know it was is the glamour of egypt
[1:37:33] he could have had anything he wanted
[1:37:35] you know and with the gift of faith
[1:37:39] he made his choice
[1:37:43] he he
[1:37:44] he was identified
[1:37:47] with those what they call mud daubers
[1:37:50] but those were the people of god
[1:37:52] amen amen
[1:37:54] praise god
[1:37:57] this
[1:37:58] this message in
[1:38:01] why christ speak it says this in
[1:38:03] paragraph 134 he says
[1:38:06] they paralyze the little faith that they
[1:38:08] have and it can't work
[1:38:10] but moses gave way to that and he
[1:38:13] his faith paralyzed the world either
[1:38:16] your faith will paralyze glamour or
[1:38:19] either glamour will paralyze your faith
[1:38:22] now you have to take one or the other
[1:38:25] and you see the bible don't change
[1:38:28] god don't change and here's the
[1:38:30] unchangeable god why christ speak you
[1:38:33] know and i'll leave you with this
[1:38:35] you know
[1:38:36] there's there's things that we
[1:38:37] conceptualize what's what's good and
[1:38:40] what's right and and i i'll say this god
[1:38:44] i believe that he's four
[1:38:46] healings and and he's four even if
[1:38:48] someone doesn't have the same faith for
[1:38:51] the impossible and
[1:38:54] and and if there's a there's there's a
[1:38:56] faith that worketh by love in the
[1:38:58] believers today i remember
[1:39:01] just
[1:39:02] there was a need that came and this is a
[1:39:04] number of years ago but you know hearing
[1:39:06] the revealed word of the hour there's
[1:39:09] anything's possible with god and i
[1:39:11] remember hearing that one of my wife's
[1:39:14] cousins they were in a distressful
[1:39:16] situation
[1:39:17] and
[1:39:18] one of the cousins fell on christmas eve
[1:39:22] and went tumbling down the ladder or
[1:39:24] down the stairs
[1:39:26] and
[1:39:27] completely like broke the neck and was
[1:39:29] paralyzed
[1:39:31] and it was it was a devastating thing to
[1:39:34] the family
[1:39:35] and yet
[1:39:36] we just put it before the lord you know
[1:39:38] i don't know what god wants to do in
[1:39:40] that situation and you know they weren't
[1:39:42] living right it was two women that were
[1:39:44] you know they have an open life that is
[1:39:47] not what we would say is is christian it
[1:39:50] was you know
[1:39:51] uh
[1:39:52] but you know what god is willing to to
[1:39:56] declare because he's no respecter of
[1:39:58] persons and god's able to deliver of
[1:40:01] spirits of bondage and oppression and i
[1:40:03] just want to say that we went out there
[1:40:06] and we just had a burden to go out and
[1:40:10] see what god would do and you know what
[1:40:13] within a year we saw her at a family
[1:40:15] function
[1:40:16] totally walking as if nothing happened
[1:40:20] you know it's the goodness of god that
[1:40:23] brings a heart to repentance
[1:40:25] you see
[1:40:26] let's just approach this
[1:40:28] and let the faith go to work amen
[1:40:32] let the love of god that god loved you
[1:40:35] with be shed abroad to go out
[1:40:37] into this world and impact them for the
[1:40:40] gospel amen

[1:40:59] deeper sincerity or a deeper
[1:41:01] consecration to
