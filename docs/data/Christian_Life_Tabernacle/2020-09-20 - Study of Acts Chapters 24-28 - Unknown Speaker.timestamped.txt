[6:04] what a beautiful name it is
[6:07] the name of jesus christ
[6:13] oh and what a beautiful name it is
[6:19] nothing compares to this

[7:44] [Music]
[7:53] lord jesus truly there's no
[7:57] name given to man that we could be saved
[8:00] by but the name of jesus christ
[8:03] lord as we sing those words what a
[8:05] beautiful name
[8:09] lord we maybe all could look back into
[8:12] our past and
[8:14] start to think of what it would be like
[8:17] if
[8:18] it wasn't for you lord to come by our
[8:20] way
[8:22] so the name of jesus means so much to us
[8:24] that we're lost and
[8:26] we're in darkness and trespasses and sin
[8:29] but you saw fit lord to call us
[8:32] he's all fit to elect us and
[8:35] give us the revelation lord that it was
[8:37] your blood that you shed on calvary that
[8:40] took our place
[8:42] as we meditate upon those things
[8:45] and to come to the knowledge and the
[8:47] revelation of what it truly means to be
[8:49] justified lord
[8:51] to think that because the blood that you
[8:54] spilt on calvary lord that you took our
[8:56] sins and
[8:57] you threw it in the sea of forgetfulness
[9:00] and lord we're justified that we never
[9:02] did it in the first place
[9:04] or the enemy's an accuser of the
[9:06] brethren and he tries to
[9:08] to remind us of our past failures and
[9:10] the things that we've done wrong
[9:12] but there's so much power in the name of
[9:14] jesus christ
[9:16] demons have to flee and we can approach
[9:19] you
[9:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[9:22] ask and receive the things that we ask
[9:24] for so lord that's why we sing to you
[9:27] tonight we sing the
[9:28] the praises of zion lord we're just
[9:32] asking in that name that you would pass
[9:34] by our way once again
[9:36] you'd break the bread of life and speak
[9:38] to our hearts lord there's needs that
[9:39] are represented in the body
[9:41] but we know that by your stripes we are
[9:44] healed
[9:45] lord and we come asking and standing
[9:47] together as a body
[9:49] for the needs that are represented lord
[9:50] that you would do above and
[9:52] exceedingly that we could even ask lord
[9:55] we know that you're faithful and you're
[9:56] mindful
[9:57] of what we have need of we love you lord
[10:00] we just commit the service to you
[10:02] lord the songs that are sung each one
[10:05] that has a part lord those that couldn't
[10:06] make it
[10:08] lord the minister as he would come forth
[10:10] lord we committed all to thee for thy
[10:12] glory
[10:13] and ask all these things in your
[10:14] precious name the lord jesus christ

[42:21] this evening and uh god has been good to
[42:25] us
[42:26] give you health let you breathe that you
[42:29] see the beautiful sunshine
[42:32] and so tonight we're going to try to
[42:35] finish up
[42:36] the book of acts and
[42:39] we never can't get away from the
[42:41] unfailing realities of the word of god
[42:44] it's real and it never fails
[42:48] when all this beautiful texas is going
[42:49] to be ashes
[42:51] they'll still be the word of god let's
[42:54] pray father we thank you
[42:55] this day for your grace to us we thank
[42:58] you that we can be here and
[43:00] to enjoy your word we pray that you
[43:01] speak directly to each one
[43:04] father all we're trying to do is make
[43:06] christ real to the people
[43:08] bless them help us to speak the truth we
[43:10] ask in jesus name amen
[43:13] so you may be seated
[43:17] open your bibles to acts chapter
[43:22] 24 but you know the that quote that we
[43:26] started with this morning
[43:28] knowing that you are my responsibility
[43:30] and on my hands for the gospel
[43:32] i'll always want to keep you writing the
[43:34] pages of this bible
[43:37] that was brother branham's ministry and
[43:40] um
[43:42] first corinthians 1 18 by the
[43:44] foolishness of preaching
[43:47] because what we do here what you enjoy
[43:49] is foolishness to a lot of people
[43:52] you know they completely look over
[43:55] ephesians 4 chapter chapter 4 verse 11
[43:58] and 12.
[43:59] but in galatians 1 and 8 paul told us
[44:01] very specifically
[44:03] god has given me the revelation i gave
[44:06] it to you
[44:07] and if anybody if i come back
[44:10] next week with a better revelation god
[44:13] you know
[44:14] don't listen if an angel drops out of
[44:17] heaven
[44:18] and gives you something different so
[44:20] there's one of our key scriptures
[44:23] that if it's different leave it alone
[44:27] now you're not going to change people
[44:29] i've tried doesn't work
[44:32] you got to leave them alone the best we
[44:34] can hope for is
[44:35] maybe a mutual respect um
[44:38] that uh i don't preach about you you
[44:41] leave me alone
[44:41] we'll meet you at the finish line so
[44:44] that's all we can hope for
[44:45] but um we're going to preach again from
[44:48] brother branham's
[44:49] absolute which is the scripture and in
[44:52] chapter 23 of acts we had
[44:55] uh we had
[44:58] paul in prison remember or he's he's
[45:01] under
[45:02] heavy guards in um caesarea
[45:05] they took him down there with 470
[45:07] soldiers remember
[45:10] and so he uh says they left him bound
[45:14] but you know kind of protective custody
[45:18] and so uh in chapter 24 we have the fact
[45:21] that
[45:22] five days later it says that um
[45:26] here in chapter 24 verse one and after
[45:30] five days
[45:31] ananias the high priest descended with
[45:33] the elders
[45:34] and with certain orator that means a
[45:37] lawyer
[45:38] named tertullius who informed the
[45:41] governor against paul
[45:42] so they came down in mass you know
[45:46] they're with their great um uh
[45:49] lawyer and we're gonna tell this
[45:52] governor exactly who this character is
[45:54] see and here he comes with his entourage
[45:56] in verse two he flatters the government
[45:58] with great words
[45:59] we have enjoyed the great peace and
[46:01] prosperity due to your wonderful
[46:03] planning
[46:03] and we're so thankful but we have a
[46:06] little situation sir
[46:08] this man so they invented some
[46:12] accusations which remain amounted to
[46:14] name calling
[46:15] the same thing we got going on today
[46:18] they have no basis
[46:20] but because we hate him we're gonna make
[46:22] up stuff you know
[46:24] and so he's telling the governor how
[46:26] that
[46:27] this man profaned our temple now the
[46:30] governor
[46:31] could really care less about their
[46:33] religious problems
[46:34] that's y'all's problem you know and so
[46:37] we grabbed him because he profaned our
[46:39] temple
[46:40] and uh we were going to judge him
[46:42] according to our laws
[46:44] uh-huh how's that beating him to death
[46:47] that was the way they were going to
[46:48] solve it
[46:49] and but your man the commander took him
[46:52] from us
[46:53] with great violence oh yeah remember
[46:56] he simply rescued him out of their hands
[46:59] and so
[47:00] uh he thought it best that you yourself
[47:02] judged this case
[47:04] and all the jews said amen yeah you're
[47:06] right mr trudeau so we agree
[47:08] so we have paul on trial for his faith
[47:10] here in chapter 24
[47:12] and um he's standing before an angry
[47:16] arrogant religious high council and the
[47:18] roman governor in caesarea
[47:20] in the years about 57 a.d so governor
[47:23] felix gives paul the nod
[47:25] permits him to say his peace okay 24 10
[47:30] then paul after that the governor had
[47:32] beckoned him unto to speak
[47:34] answered and said for as much as i know
[47:37] that thou hast
[47:38] been of many years a judge unto this
[47:41] nation
[47:42] i do the more cheerfully answer for
[47:43] myself in other words you
[47:45] you know our whole situation here in
[47:46] israel because the thou mayest
[47:48] understand
[47:49] that there are not yet 12 days since i
[47:51] went up to jerusalem
[47:53] for the worship and they neither found
[47:55] me in the temple disputing with any man
[47:58] neither raising up the people neither in
[48:01] the synagogues nor in the city in other
[48:02] words i'm perfectly innocent
[48:05] 13 neither can they prove the things
[48:07] wherever they now accuse me
[48:09] okay but this i confess unto thee
[48:12] that after the way which they call
[48:14] heresy
[48:16] that's the way i worship the god of my
[48:17] fathers believing all
[48:20] things which are written in the law and
[48:21] the prophets
[48:23] i believe the entire scripture not just
[48:25] a few choice pieces of what moses said
[48:28] okay verse 15 and i have hope towards
[48:32] god which they themselves also allow
[48:34] that there shall be a resurrection of
[48:36] the dead both the just and the unjust
[48:39] and herein do i exercise myself
[48:42] to have always a conscience void of
[48:44] offense towards god and toward man
[48:46] in other words live honestly now after
[48:49] many years i came to bring alms to my
[48:51] nation and offering
[48:52] whereupon certain jews from asia found
[48:55] me purified in the temple
[48:57] neither with multitude nor with tomo you
[48:59] know causing no upset
[49:01] but ought to have been here before thee
[49:04] and object if they had against me so
[49:07] these guys didn't even show up to trial
[49:08] they're over jerusalem causing the scene
[49:11] they didn't come down verse 20.
[49:13] or else let these same here say if they
[49:15] have found any evil doing it with me
[49:18] while i stood before the council except
[49:20] to be for this one voice that i cried
[49:22] outstanding among them touching the
[49:25] resurrection of the dead
[49:26] i am called in question for you by you
[49:29] this day
[49:30] well there's where he touched the wrong
[49:32] key
[49:34] the governor was not so interested in
[49:36] the fine points of the religious law of
[49:38] the jews
[49:38] now that's y'all's problem he was simply
[49:41] protecting god's man
[49:42] of the hour from death by the hands
[49:46] of the most religious people on the
[49:47] planet
[49:50] sadducees and pharisees they knew it all
[49:53] and they had the pedigree and the
[49:55] attitude to prove it
[49:57] yeah we had john the baptist
[50:02] he said oh you generation of snakes
[50:05] dangerously moving amongst the crowd you
[50:07] know
[50:08] jesus said blind leaders of the blind
[50:10] and many other things in matthew 23
[50:13] and now paul is on trial for his beliefs
[50:15] in chapter 24
[50:17] verse 14 through 21 that we just read
[50:20] and
[50:23] so now governor felix having a better
[50:25] understanding of the way
[50:28] of christ because you know he's had some
[50:29] history with the jews
[50:31] and he granted an injunction and he said
[50:33] well i'll tell you what
[50:35] we'll do this when the chief police
[50:37] comes down
[50:38] we'll review the how we'll review the
[50:40] case again
[50:41] goodbye have a nice day and a problem
[50:45] so far verse 23
[50:48] um and he commanded the century and to
[50:50] keep paul and to let him have liberty
[50:52] and that he should forbid none of his
[50:54] acquaintance to minister or come to him
[50:56] so he was
[50:57] he had a nice place to stay guys can
[50:59] come and see him and so forth
[51:02] and so then a few days later governor
[51:04] felix and his wife drusilla
[51:06] invited paul over for lunch and asked
[51:08] him more about the christian faith he'll
[51:10] get into talking
[51:11] and paul didn't hold back you can read
[51:13] it yourself he expounded to them
[51:14] regarding righteousness
[51:16] holiness judgment that is coming and
[51:18] there was such an anointing present
[51:21] that the government was fearful and he
[51:22] trembled you know
[51:24] he was moved by the power of god through
[51:26] the words
[51:27] of a gospel preacher but he put it off
[51:32] like a lot of people today you can go
[51:34] now i'll call you
[51:36] you know when it's more convenient i've
[51:38] got a lot of things to think about today
[51:39] in other words
[51:40] i have other priorities okay
[51:43] so let me tell you something it's never
[51:45] a more better
[51:46] right time than right now when god
[51:48] speaks
[51:49] don't think that you've got tomorrow
[51:52] there's a lot of people on the way to
[51:53] the hospital right now that won't see
[51:55] the sunrise
[51:57] you don't have no i you have no
[51:58] guarantee that you go out there and
[51:59] start your car
[52:02] you know and so um god knows
[52:06] when is right and he expects you to
[52:08] answer at that time you see
[52:10] there's a time when it's the right time
[52:14] now i'll give you a small story of last
[52:17] you know a long time ago when the
[52:22] the film the ten commandments first came
[52:23] out was 1955 okay
[52:26] and so some people told brother branham
[52:28] about it
[52:29] and he thought well that'd be a good
[52:30] idea sounds good so he took his family
[52:33] which would have been 1955.
[52:37] joseph wasn't born yet so we got the two
[52:40] girls and his wife the four of them
[52:42] they went to a small theater in new
[52:44] albany a little bit bigger than this
[52:46] congregation here and so he's
[52:49] you know film comes on the ten
[52:50] commandments and
[52:52] of course it's four hours long but um
[52:55] they're watching
[52:56] and when the you know when the pillar of
[52:58] fire comes on the screen
[53:00] it's so perfect brother bram jumped up
[53:02] and took his hat off because he thought
[53:03] it was a real thing
[53:05] oh yeah oh it's film okay so he sits
[53:07] back down
[53:09] well they see the whole film and then
[53:11] they're on the way home
[53:12] now rebecca was very very sensitive
[53:15] person
[53:16] you know she was very sensitive to
[53:17] spirits and at that time she would have
[53:19] been
[53:20] nine years old and so they're going home
[53:24] after a four-hour film which you know
[53:25] they didn't go to movies or something
[53:27] brand new
[53:28] and so she's crying well honey what's
[53:30] the matter you know daddy took you to
[53:32] movies but dad didn't you see and so
[53:36] she had seen in the film where
[53:39] moses said now all this on the lord's
[53:41] side come with me
[53:42] and you know these people are coming
[53:43] across and they're going with him but
[53:45] she wasn't watching them she's watching
[53:46] these other people
[53:47] that waited another half a minute and
[53:50] they fell in the pit
[53:52] you know and they were trying you know
[53:54] in her
[53:55] way looking at it and she said well it
[53:56] wasn't fair dad means people trying
[53:59] and he said well let this be you know
[54:01] like we would say a teaching moment
[54:03] when god shows you something you do it
[54:07] you don't wait around take a vote and
[54:08] see if grandma agrees and all this no
[54:10] you go get with it so that's what
[54:13] happened here
[54:14] you know he put it off
[54:17] well in our story here the governor sent
[54:20] for paul on a regular basis it says
[54:22] and they had we'll say limited
[54:24] fellowship
[54:26] but we never read about the government
[54:28] governor actually accepting christ
[54:29] or being baptized he'd just like to talk
[54:32] about it
[54:33] oh we got friends like that we got
[54:35] family i like to talk about it and
[54:38] debate the issue well you know now get
[54:40] with it
[54:41] you know and at each meeting guess what
[54:44] he was really hoping that because he
[54:46] allowed paul to have these visitors
[54:48] at each meeting that he had with paul he
[54:50] was expecting paul to bring
[54:52] him some cash yeah it says that right
[54:54] there in your bible
[54:55] that each meeting he would bring a bribe
[54:57] okay you're looking at me like i'm crazy
[54:59] verse 26
[55:00] he hoped also that money should be given
[55:02] him of paul
[55:04] that he might loose him wherever he sent
[55:06] for him
[55:07] the more often and communed with him
[55:10] clear back there it wasn't invented in
[55:12] mexico it wasn't invented in africa
[55:16] way back there so this went on for two
[55:19] years
[55:20] from 57 to 59 a.d
[55:24] so then the governor's term you know
[55:27] came to an end
[55:29] and um another one was going to take his
[55:31] place
[55:32] but felix being a politician he left
[55:35] paul
[55:35] in prison in order to please the jews
[55:39] and make himself look good yeah
[55:42] you see with some people you probably
[55:44] don't know any but i do
[55:45] it's all about appearance
[55:48] no substance all about appearance you
[55:50] know but you see god demands a correct
[55:53] order of priorities and with the
[55:55] believer
[55:56] jesus christ always has first place
[56:00] never forget jesus christ is the
[56:02] redeemer of mankind
[56:05] william branham is the restoration
[56:07] prophet that you just happen to live in
[56:08] the same time frame
[56:09] you know so anything that comes between
[56:12] you and god
[56:13] is called an idol we have an entire
[56:16] study on idols
[56:17] images and idolatry yeah okay moving
[56:21] along to chapter 25.
[56:23] so in 25 1 and when festus was come
[56:26] unto the province that's the new
[56:28] governor after three days he ascended
[56:30] from caesarea up to jerusalem
[56:33] now um i put in there ascended up to
[56:36] ascend it means going up because
[56:38] jerusalem is at 2 300 feet above sea
[56:40] level
[56:40] caesarea is on the seaside you see
[56:44] and usually when you read in your bible
[56:46] the people went up to jerusalem they
[56:47] came from the east side from jericho
[56:50] because in in what like 25 miles it goes
[56:54] up 3000 feet or better
[56:55] so always going up to jerusalem anyway
[57:00] verse 2. then the high priest and the
[57:02] chief of the jews informed him against
[57:04] paul
[57:05] and you know besought him and they
[57:07] desired favor against him
[57:09] that he would send for him to jerusalem
[57:12] laying weight
[57:13] in the way to kill him so they're still
[57:15] after him now i'm sure that these 40
[57:17] guys
[57:17] they probably got hungry right yeah they
[57:21] probably didn't keep their promise
[57:23] because time is going on he was in
[57:25] prison down there for two years
[57:27] so uh but they're still wanting to kill
[57:28] him
[57:30] so the first order of business you know
[57:32] with the new governor the religious
[57:34] authorities brief the new governor about
[57:36] this prisoner
[57:37] with a sinister plan now sir with all
[57:39] due respect
[57:40] please bring this sorry preacher up here
[57:42] to jerusalem so we can take his head off
[57:44] you know um so the new governor says in
[57:48] verse 4
[57:49] um no he will remain he'll remain in my
[57:52] jail in caesarea
[57:54] i will take care of him so after 10 days
[57:57] he returns to the nice seaside home and
[58:00] they have the trial okay verse 7
[58:04] of chapter 25 let's see here
[58:08] and when he was come the jews which came
[58:10] down from jerusalem stood around about
[58:13] and uh laid many and grievous complaints
[58:16] against paul
[58:17] which they could not prove sounds like
[58:20] news today right a bunch of nonsense i
[58:22] can't prove
[58:24] um okay we're going to go down through
[58:25] um where we have here
[58:28] we're down through um verse 14.
[58:31] now wait a minute we're in 25 yeah verse
[58:36] here now 7-12
[58:40] and so while he answered for himself
[58:41] neither against the law or the jews
[58:43] neither against the temple or against
[58:44] caesar
[58:45] have i offended anything at all said
[58:47] paul
[58:48] but festus willing to do the jews
[58:51] pleasure but you know do them a favor
[58:53] answered paul and said will thou go to
[58:55] jerusalem and there be judged by these
[58:57] things
[58:58] before me got a question here
[59:01] then paul said i stand at caesar's
[59:04] judgment seat
[59:06] when i ought to be judged or out to be
[59:08] judged to the jews have i done no wrong
[59:11] as thou very well knowest for if i be an
[59:14] offender or have committed anything
[59:16] worthy of death
[59:17] i refuse not to die but if there be none
[59:20] of these things wherever they can accuse
[59:22] me
[59:22] no man can deliver me to them i appeal
[59:26] to caesar
[59:27] now this comes out of his own you know
[59:29] reasoning
[59:31] god already spoke to him said you will
[59:33] be a witness to me in rome
[59:35] well he just got his ticket signed when
[59:38] festus
[59:38] then fest is when he had conferred with
[59:41] the council
[59:42] answered you appeal to caesar the caesar
[59:45] yoga
[59:46] buddy we'll be glad to get you off our
[59:47] hands out of here
[59:49] so king agrippa came to welcome the new
[59:53] governor of hestus and rehearsed the
[59:54] whole story with him
[59:56] and in verse 22 then agrippa said unto
[59:59] festus the new governor
[1:00:00] i would also like to hear this man
[1:00:02] myself tomorrow can you can you arrange
[1:00:04] that
[1:00:05] oh sure search yeah yeah we'd like to
[1:00:07] hear it for myself
[1:00:08] okay so verse 23 through the end of the
[1:00:10] chapter and on the next day when agrippa
[1:00:13] was come
[1:00:14] and beatrice with great pomp and you
[1:00:16] know entered into the palace of the
[1:00:18] hearing and the chief captains you can
[1:00:19] imagine all the stuff that's going on
[1:00:21] you know
[1:00:22] paul was brought forth and festus said
[1:00:24] king agrippa
[1:00:26] and all men which are here present with
[1:00:28] us uh you see this man about whom
[1:00:30] all the multitude of the jews have dealt
[1:00:32] with me both of jerusalem and also here
[1:00:35] crying that he ought to not to have
[1:00:37] not to live any longer but when i found
[1:00:39] that he had committed nothing worthy of
[1:00:41] death
[1:00:42] and that he himself hath appealed to
[1:00:44] augustus caesar in rome
[1:00:46] i have determined to send him but i have
[1:00:49] nothing
[1:00:49] to write i have no letter to send with
[1:00:51] him wherefore i have brought him before
[1:00:54] you
[1:00:54] and especially um before theo king
[1:00:57] agrippa
[1:00:58] that after examination um i might have
[1:01:01] something to write in other words you
[1:01:02] could give me some clues what i could
[1:01:04] put in this letter
[1:01:05] for it seemeth to me unreasonable to
[1:01:06] send a prisoner and not with all to
[1:01:08] signify
[1:01:09] the crimes laid against him so he knew
[1:01:11] it was all sham he knew it was all a
[1:01:12] bunch of accusations
[1:01:14] but hey you want to go see caesar fine
[1:01:17] but i got to send a letter with you okay
[1:01:20] and so
[1:01:21] are we going to chapter 26 then agrippa
[1:01:24] said unto paul
[1:01:26] thou are permitted to speak for thyself
[1:01:28] then paul stretched forth his hand
[1:01:30] and answered for himself i think myself
[1:01:33] happy king agrippa because i shall
[1:01:34] answer for myself this day
[1:01:36] before thee touching all the things
[1:01:38] whereof i
[1:01:40] am accused by the jews especially
[1:01:42] because i know
[1:01:43] you to be an expert in all the customs
[1:01:45] and questions which are among the jews
[1:01:48] wherefore i beseech thee to hear me
[1:01:50] patiently
[1:01:51] so now king agrippa which was appointed
[1:01:53] directly by rome
[1:01:55] listens to paul as he tells his entire
[1:01:57] story
[1:01:58] from verse 2 all the way down through
[1:01:59] verse 23 with lots of details
[1:02:02] we're not going to read the whole thing
[1:02:03] but we're going to look at verse 14
[1:02:05] and when we were all fallen to the earth
[1:02:07] okay he's telling about when he was
[1:02:08] going to damascus and fell down the dust
[1:02:10] and everything
[1:02:10] he said i heard a voice speaking unto me
[1:02:12] saying in the hebrew tongue
[1:02:14] saul saul why persecutest thou me
[1:02:18] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:02:19] pricks and i said who aren't you lord
[1:02:21] and he said i am jesus whom thou
[1:02:23] persecutest
[1:02:24] but rise and stand up on thy feet for i
[1:02:27] have appeared unto thee
[1:02:29] for this purpose to make thee a minister
[1:02:32] now he was not a minister he was an
[1:02:34] agitator he was putting people to death
[1:02:37] but god's grace reached down for him
[1:02:40] so no matter who you are or what your
[1:02:43] past is
[1:02:44] today you can turn the corner if you
[1:02:47] accept the grace of god
[1:02:49] because right here i'm going to make you
[1:02:50] a minister and a witness both of these
[1:02:52] things
[1:02:53] which thou has seen and those things
[1:02:55] which i will appear unto thee
[1:02:57] deliver thee from the people and from
[1:02:59] the gentiles unto whom i send thee
[1:03:02] so i'm sending you to the gentiles that
[1:03:03] had never happened before
[1:03:05] verse 18 to open the eyes and to turn
[1:03:08] them from darkness to light now these
[1:03:11] people
[1:03:12] thought they were in the light they were
[1:03:13] quoting their prophet perfectly without
[1:03:15] an ipad
[1:03:16] without a cell phone they read and they
[1:03:19] memorized that's how they knew the law
[1:03:21] of moses
[1:03:22] but they were in darkness they thought
[1:03:25] they were right
[1:03:26] they had memorized everything moses said
[1:03:28] but they were in the dark
[1:03:29] but i'm going to send you paul bring him
[1:03:31] to the light
[1:03:33] um comma and from the power of satan
[1:03:36] are you kidding me the power of satan we
[1:03:38] memorize the prophet's words
[1:03:40] it happens it's happening today
[1:03:46] from the power of satan unto god that
[1:03:48] they may receive forgiveness of sins
[1:03:51] and inheritance among them which are
[1:03:53] sanctified by faith
[1:03:54] that is in meat okay um
[1:03:58] verse 19 whereupon o king agrippa i was
[1:04:00] not disobedient until heavenly vision i
[1:04:02] obeyed everything god
[1:04:04] said i was totally converted and i did
[1:04:07] what he said
[1:04:08] verse 22 having therefore obtained help
[1:04:11] of god i continue unto this day
[1:04:13] witnessing both the small and great
[1:04:15] saying none other things than that which
[1:04:18] the prophets and moses did say should
[1:04:20] come
[1:04:21] i'm preaching to you the word of god
[1:04:24] they don't believe
[1:04:25] even though they memorized it
[1:04:28] look i know a person far away you don't
[1:04:32] know him probably
[1:04:33] but this person told me 20 years ago
[1:04:37] that she had heard every recording eight
[1:04:40] times
[1:04:43] and i'm thinking why do you have this
[1:04:45] temper to fight a buzz saw
[1:04:47] if you've heard everything so it's not a
[1:04:50] matter of
[1:04:51] what you've done it's whether you've
[1:04:53] been converted from the inside out
[1:04:56] you know and all he's doing is preaching
[1:04:59] what moses
[1:05:00] said you know verse 23 that christ
[1:05:02] should suffer and that he should be the
[1:05:04] first that should rise from the dead
[1:05:06] and should show light unto the people
[1:05:08] and to the gentiles
[1:05:10] all that's in moses writings you know
[1:05:13] but they couldn't handle the
[1:05:14] manifestation
[1:05:15] they just want to repeat you see look at
[1:05:18] 24
[1:05:20] and as he thus spake for himself festus
[1:05:23] said with a loud voice
[1:05:24] paul you're beside yourself much
[1:05:27] learning has made you mad
[1:05:29] but paul said i'm not mad most noble
[1:05:32] festives
[1:05:33] but i'm speaking forth the words of
[1:05:34] truth and soberness
[1:05:36] for the king knows of these things
[1:05:38] before whom also i speak freely
[1:05:41] for i am persuaded for i am persuaded
[1:05:44] that none of these things are hidden
[1:05:46] from him
[1:05:47] for this thing was not done in a corner
[1:05:50] now friends
[1:05:51] this that we call the truth the message
[1:05:53] it wasn't done in a corner
[1:05:55] it's being projected far and wide around
[1:05:58] the world
[1:05:59] in many languages there's a man in
[1:06:02] mexico
[1:06:02] right now that has baptized more people
[1:06:06] than paul
[1:06:06] than peter baptized on the day of
[1:06:08] pentecost things are happening
[1:06:11] yeah oh yeah
[1:06:14] so reading on down kanga grip i believe
[1:06:17] is now these the the
[1:06:18] prophets i know that you believe then
[1:06:20] agrippa said paul
[1:06:21] almost not persuaded me to be a
[1:06:23] christian i mean i'm that close
[1:06:25] you know and paul said i would
[1:06:29] to god that not only thou
[1:06:32] but also all that hear me this day we're
[1:06:34] both almost
[1:06:35] and all together such as i am except for
[1:06:37] these chains that i've got on you know
[1:06:39] so um verse 30 and when he had thus
[1:06:42] spoken
[1:06:44] um the king rose up and the governor and
[1:06:47] bernice
[1:06:48] and they sat with him and when they were
[1:06:50] gone aside
[1:06:52] uh they talked among themselves saying
[1:06:55] this guy has done
[1:06:56] done nothing worthy of death or of these
[1:06:58] bonds these chains
[1:07:00] then said agrippa and defestus this man
[1:07:03] might have been set free at liberty
[1:07:05] if he had not appealed to go to caesar
[1:07:07] he asked for it
[1:07:09] away he goes so at the time of paul's
[1:07:13] trial there in caesarea it was not a
[1:07:16] crime to be a christian
[1:07:17] when standing before a roman court they
[1:07:20] all agreed that paul was innocent
[1:07:22] but after spending two years in the
[1:07:24] prison there he was sent to rome
[1:07:26] to the supreme court and his journey to
[1:07:29] rome
[1:07:29] was not a pleasure cruise it was full of
[1:07:32] problems
[1:07:33] okay and we're going to cover this in
[1:07:35] the next few minutes here
[1:07:37] because this is the end of the study but
[1:07:40] um our brother was facing a very uh
[1:07:43] long voyage to rome today it's a
[1:07:46] four-hour flight
[1:07:47] but then all they had was a boat and it
[1:07:50] all depended on the winds
[1:07:51] and which way they were blowing and so
[1:07:53] forth and this is late autumn
[1:07:55] of 59 a.d now the merchants kept
[1:07:59] an eye on the weather and um
[1:08:04] they knew when was the most favorable
[1:08:06] winds
[1:08:07] favorable times you know just like right
[1:08:09] here the weather can change
[1:08:11] so this ship that they're on could have
[1:08:14] been 100 feet long
[1:08:16] it was all wood carrying up to 300 tons
[1:08:20] of grain
[1:08:21] from the middle east to rome okay
[1:08:24] after mid-september the sailing gets
[1:08:26] dangerous so they greatly discourage
[1:08:28] sailing from november 12th
[1:08:30] till march 10th and they were carrying
[1:08:33] mediterranean grains
[1:08:34] to rome the grain dealers over there
[1:08:36] were waiting for the shipment
[1:08:38] and so they took along some prisoners
[1:08:41] they stopped for a day
[1:08:42] in sidon which is lebanon today and paul
[1:08:45] was permitted to go into town
[1:08:47] see the saints okay and
[1:08:50] then they tried to proceed but the winds
[1:08:52] were contrary took more time
[1:08:54] then they came to a place in southern
[1:08:56] turkey called myra
[1:08:58] and all the prisoners were put on
[1:09:00] another boat that sailed for many days
[1:09:02] in bad weather
[1:09:04] and they finally came to the island of
[1:09:05] crete now this is all in your bible i'm
[1:09:08] not making it up
[1:09:09] so 27 verse 9
[1:09:12] let's see here now when much time was
[1:09:16] spent
[1:09:16] and when sailing was now dangerous
[1:09:19] because
[1:09:20] of the fast was now already passed paul
[1:09:23] admonished them
[1:09:24] and he said sirs i perceive that this
[1:09:26] voyage will be
[1:09:27] with great hurt in other words we're in
[1:09:29] for it and much damage
[1:09:31] not only of the lading of the ship but
[1:09:33] also of our lives
[1:09:35] nevertheless the centurion believed the
[1:09:38] master of this owner of the ship
[1:09:39] more than the things which were spoken
[1:09:42] by paul
[1:09:43] so lots of bad weather so we get to
[1:09:45] verse 18
[1:09:47] and we being exceedingly tossed with the
[1:09:50] tempest
[1:09:51] the next day they lightened the ship
[1:09:53] what do you think that means
[1:09:55] they're throwing the grain out that's
[1:09:57] gold
[1:09:58] no they're gonna get paid when they get
[1:09:59] there so they're pitching this stuff out
[1:10:01] because they don't want to sink
[1:10:03] um verse 19. and the third day we cast
[1:10:06] out with our own hands the tackling of
[1:10:08] the ship
[1:10:10] yeah all the you know what makes it work
[1:10:13] they're getting serious
[1:10:15] uh it's looking bad for everyone in
[1:10:17] verse 21
[1:10:18] and after a long absence paul stood
[1:10:20] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[1:10:23] we should have hearkened unto me he
[1:10:25] should have hearkened to me
[1:10:26] and not have loosed from crete and to
[1:10:29] have gained
[1:10:30] this harm and loss now i exert you to be
[1:10:33] of good cheer
[1:10:34] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:10:36] life among you
[1:10:37] but only the ship in other words we're
[1:10:39] going to lose this boat but nobody's
[1:10:40] going to get hurt
[1:10:42] for their stood by me this night an
[1:10:43] angel of god whose i
[1:10:45] am and whom i serve and he said fear not
[1:10:49] paul
[1:10:50] thou must be brought before caesar and
[1:10:52] god hath given thee
[1:10:53] all them that sail with thee wherefore
[1:10:56] sirs be of good cheer
[1:10:58] for i believe god that it shall be even
[1:11:01] as it was told me
[1:11:02] how be it we must we must be cast upon a
[1:11:05] certain island
[1:11:07] now he doesn't say where but it is uh
[1:11:10] you know an island they're coming to but
[1:11:12] when the fourteenth night
[1:11:14] was come in other words two weeks later
[1:11:16] as we were driven
[1:11:18] uh as we were driven up and down in uh
[1:11:21] adria about midnight the ship
[1:11:25] men deemed that they're drew near to
[1:11:26] some country
[1:11:28] and they sounded and found it 20 fathoms
[1:11:30] and when they'd gone a little further
[1:11:32] they sounded again there were 15 fathoms
[1:11:36] then fearing lest we should fall upon
[1:11:38] the rocks
[1:11:39] they cast four anchors out of the stern
[1:11:42] and wished for day
[1:11:43] so this is all happening in the night
[1:11:45] and as the shipment were about to flee
[1:11:47] out of the ship
[1:11:48] when they had let down the boat unto the
[1:11:50] seed of the lifeboat
[1:11:53] under color as though they would have
[1:11:55] cast anchors out of the four ship
[1:11:57] paul said to the centurion and to the
[1:11:59] soldiers except these abide in the ship
[1:12:01] you cannot be saved in other words we've
[1:12:03] got to stick together you guys go off on
[1:12:05] your own
[1:12:06] too bad so the soldiers were cut off on
[1:12:08] the ropes of the boat
[1:12:09] and let her fall okay goodbye lifeboat
[1:12:13] and while they're while the day was
[1:12:14] coming on paul besought them all to take
[1:12:17] me
[1:12:17] saying this day is the fourteenth day
[1:12:20] that we have tarried continued with our
[1:12:21] fasting
[1:12:22] and we've not eaten anything so let's
[1:12:24] eat the stuff we have
[1:12:26] amen and therefore i pray to you
[1:12:30] take some meat and for this is for your
[1:12:32] health
[1:12:33] for there shall not a hair fall from the
[1:12:35] head of any of you
[1:12:37] wow and when he had thus spoken he took
[1:12:39] bread gave thanks
[1:12:40] and they began to eat and they were all
[1:12:42] a good cheer
[1:12:43] and took some meat 37 and
[1:12:47] we were all in the ship 200
[1:12:50] score that's 276 people
[1:12:53] this is no little band of renegades
[1:12:56] that's a crowd
[1:12:58] it's three times what's here tonight or
[1:13:00] more
[1:13:01] 276 people and when they had eaten
[1:13:04] enough
[1:13:05] they were they lightened the ship and
[1:13:06] cast some more stuff off you know
[1:13:08] and then the wheat into the sea and when
[1:13:10] it was day they knew not that they
[1:13:12] didn't know where they were
[1:13:13] but they discovered a certain creek with
[1:13:16] a shore
[1:13:17] in which they've mined it and you know
[1:13:19] thrust the ship in there
[1:13:20] and when they had taken up the anchors
[1:13:22] committed themselves to the sea in other
[1:13:23] words let it go
[1:13:25] however it can go and 41
[1:13:28] falling into a place where two seas met
[1:13:30] they ran to the ship ground
[1:13:32] and so now boom we're into the sand
[1:13:36] the waves are beaten on the ship and the
[1:13:38] soldiers council was to kill the
[1:13:40] prisoners lest any of them
[1:13:41] should swim out and escape but the
[1:13:44] centurion willing to save paul
[1:13:46] kept them from their purpose and
[1:13:48] commanded that
[1:13:49] um they which could swim should cast
[1:13:52] themselves into this first in the sea
[1:13:54] and get the land and the rest some on
[1:13:57] boards have broken off with the ship
[1:13:59] and so it came to pass that they escaped
[1:14:01] all safe to land
[1:14:03] okay so they're they're doing what they
[1:14:06] can
[1:14:07] to get to land that we can't sail no
[1:14:10] more
[1:14:10] ships in the stuck and um
[1:14:14] so in the last chapter here when they
[1:14:16] escaped they knew that the island was
[1:14:18] called melita
[1:14:19] and the barbarous people showed us no
[1:14:22] little kindness in other words they were
[1:14:24] very nice to us
[1:14:25] maybe these people come from nowhere and
[1:14:27] they've never you know they're just
[1:14:28] barbarians
[1:14:29] and they're very nice to us and so um
[1:14:33] they made a fire and received us and
[1:14:35] because of the present rain
[1:14:37] you know because of the cold and when
[1:14:39] paul had gathered a bundle of sticks so
[1:14:41] paul isn't just sitting there waiting
[1:14:42] for everybody to do things so he's in
[1:14:43] there with them
[1:14:44] helping get some sticks for this fire
[1:14:45] because you got 276 people plus the
[1:14:47] soldiers
[1:14:48] now the barbarians of the uh of the
[1:14:50] island and they're all you know kind of
[1:14:52] having a
[1:14:53] time there together so he's out there
[1:14:55] helping gather some sticks
[1:14:57] and um so in
[1:15:00] these sticks that he's gathering a snake
[1:15:02] comes out and grabs onto his arm
[1:15:04] now if you know if he ever been snake
[1:15:05] bit i haven't but it sounds like it's
[1:15:07] pretty bad
[1:15:09] and so um he gathers these uh sticks
[1:15:12] and when the barbarians saw that the
[1:15:14] venomous beast hung on his hand
[1:15:16] they said among themselves no doubt this
[1:15:19] man's a murderer
[1:15:20] whom though he had escaped the sea
[1:15:23] vengeance
[1:15:24] vengeance is going to get him you know
[1:15:26] and so he
[1:15:27] shook off snake into the fire felt no
[1:15:30] harm
[1:15:31] how be it when they looked and saw that
[1:15:32] he wasn't swollen
[1:15:34] or fell down dead but after that they
[1:15:37] looked
[1:15:38] a great while and saw no harm they
[1:15:41] changed their minds
[1:15:42] and said oh he's a god
[1:15:46] you know 30 minutes before he's a
[1:15:47] murderer
[1:15:49] and now he's a god see how people can
[1:15:52] change
[1:15:52] in the same quarters of the um in the
[1:15:55] same
[1:15:56] quarters were possessions of a chief man
[1:15:59] of the island
[1:15:59] whose name was publius who received us
[1:16:02] lodged us for three days courteously
[1:16:04] yeah all 276 people i was like
[1:16:07] that crowd to come to your house you
[1:16:09] know and um
[1:16:11] it came to pass that the father of
[1:16:12] publius lay sick
[1:16:14] had a bad bad sickness paul entered in
[1:16:17] prayed
[1:16:17] laid his hands on him and healed him and
[1:16:19] when this was done
[1:16:20] others also which had diseases in the
[1:16:23] island came
[1:16:24] and were healed who also honored us with
[1:16:27] many
[1:16:27] honors and when we uh departed
[1:16:32] they laded us with many great things and
[1:16:35] uh after three months we
[1:16:37] they're there three months wow uh we
[1:16:40] found a ship going to alexandria
[1:16:42] and um they went on
[1:16:45] on their way well let's see here 14.
[1:16:50] when we found brethren okay so that they
[1:16:52] they came to
[1:16:53] um the uh area of of uh
[1:16:57] you know coast where rome was up up in
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:00] land a little bit uh we found brethren
[1:17:03] and we desire to tear with them
[1:17:04] days and so we started traveling towards
[1:17:07] rome
[1:17:07] and from thence when their brethren
[1:17:09] heard of us they came to meet us as far
[1:17:12] as the appian way
[1:17:13] still there and the three taverns wentz
[1:17:17] uh paul saw he thanked god and took
[1:17:19] courage
[1:17:20] okay so paul is going on his way
[1:17:24] towards rome okay and he's under house
[1:17:28] arrest for two years there
[1:17:30] during this time nero had a lot of
[1:17:32] problems with this
[1:17:33] government so from first timothy 1 and
[1:17:35] from romans 15
[1:17:36] it's reasonable to think that paul was
[1:17:39] released
[1:17:40] and traveled as far as macedonia and
[1:17:42] also to spain he was later
[1:17:44] rearrested according to the historian
[1:17:46] eusebius and paul then was beheaded
[1:17:49] outside the city walls in public in the
[1:17:52] year
[1:17:52] 67. the actual details of the end of
[1:17:56] paul's life are unknown
[1:17:58] but there's a very beautiful church paul
[1:18:00] outside the walls
[1:18:01] we've been there many times and we have
[1:18:05] you know the letters that he's written
[1:18:07] throughout
[1:18:08] his ministry to his children in the
[1:18:11] gospel
[1:18:12] and they are a pirate part of the bible
[1:18:15] and
[1:18:16] if i ever get invited back we'll get
[1:18:18] into some of those letters
[1:18:20] so if you have time and nothing else to
[1:18:23] do some evening
[1:18:24] you can order a film from christian book
[1:18:27] distributors called
[1:18:28] paul apostle of jesus christ it's very
[1:18:31] factual
[1:18:32] it's very intense not for little
[1:18:34] children
[1:18:35] but it's the same thing we're talking
[1:18:37] about
[1:18:38] paul apostle of jesus christ and that's
[1:18:40] what it says on his tombstone
[1:18:42] so may god bless you thank you for your
[1:18:44] patience with me
[1:18:45] and uh we trust we can come back
[1:18:48] sometime soon
[1:18:49] there's a lot of places to go a lot of
[1:18:51] people in need
[1:18:52] but remember that anything
[1:18:56] different from what paul and william
[1:18:58] branham taught
[1:18:59] is seed of discrepancy just that simple
[1:19:02] no time to play games no time to well
[1:19:05] let's see if we can get along
[1:19:06] no seed of discrepancy and we're not in
[1:19:09] organized religion we're into scripture
[1:19:13] so may god bless you
[1:19:24] thank you
[1:19:29] i like holding swords that's wonderful
[1:19:32] i mean you enjoy that amen you know
[1:19:36] it's funny isn't it that i think
[1:19:39] too many times we speed read our bible
[1:19:43] you know instead of just taking a verse
[1:19:45] and
[1:19:46] looking at all that's in there and and
[1:19:49] you know and just take it in and
[1:19:54] you know i enjoyed that because you know
[1:19:57] as
[1:19:58] brother george talked about that time
[1:20:00] you know we saw that there was a
[1:20:01] political climate
[1:20:03] there was an economic economical climate
[1:20:08] there was many things going on
[1:20:12] all around and but yet
[1:20:16] the gospel still had its plan and its
[1:20:19] course
[1:20:20] and god was still making a way
[1:20:23] and you know that's amazing right you
[1:20:25] get arrested
[1:20:26] you get put on a boat go through a great
[1:20:28] big gigantic storm
[1:20:30] everybody survives you get on an island
[1:20:33] and then a healing campaign
[1:20:36] breaks out you know people are getting
[1:20:38] converted people are getting
[1:20:41] uh saved and
[1:20:44] you know in we believe that this is a
[1:20:47] restoration message
[1:20:50] you know and and that's that's what we
[1:20:53] leave out we we want the revival
[1:20:57] but we don't want the shipwreck you know
[1:21:00] what i mean
[1:21:01] we we want the we want to see all the
[1:21:04] mighty
[1:21:05] uh works done but we don't realize that
[1:21:09] that uh power apart from character is
[1:21:12] satanic
[1:21:13] you don't you don't understand that
[1:21:16] character
[1:21:16] comes from the fiery furnace of
[1:21:18] affliction
[1:21:20] you know you earn that character
[1:21:22] character is something that's earned
[1:21:24] you know what i mean it's something that
[1:21:26] that you come up against situations
[1:21:29] and you choose the christian way of
[1:21:32] doing things
[1:21:33] you cruise that you choose the christian
[1:21:35] attitude
[1:21:36] you choose a christ-like approach you
[1:21:39] take
[1:21:39] the humble side you you give up
[1:21:43] your rights and and you weigh the
[1:21:45] situation and you find out
[1:21:48] that it's uh it's not worth the argument
[1:21:51] or the fuss
[1:21:52] you know if you if many people
[1:21:56] uh in this age that we live in they want
[1:21:58] to sue everybody
[1:22:00] and you know so you get all upset in
[1:22:03] your spirit
[1:22:04] in everything and you run down to an
[1:22:06] attorney
[1:22:07] and peace and if he's attorney worth
[1:22:10] anything
[1:22:12] the first thing he'll sit there and tell
[1:22:14] you
[1:22:15] it's not worth the money you're gonna
[1:22:18] spend
[1:22:20] okay are you mad enough to spend
[1:22:23] thousand dollars
[1:22:25] and then people sit back and say well
[1:22:27] it's the principle
[1:22:31] no you know what i mean it
[1:22:34] it's not you know what i mean it's the
[1:22:37] ego
[1:22:40] and and so you you see that all down to
[1:22:43] this brother george is reading this
[1:22:44] at dc paul taking the humble side taking
[1:22:47] the humble side
[1:22:49] you know now if it would have been david
[1:22:51] mcgeary
[1:22:52] the story would have read like this
[1:22:53] david mcgary's upon the island and he
[1:22:55] escaped
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:59] he ran for his life he hid
[1:23:02] in the barn you know what i mean he was
[1:23:07] out of there
[1:23:09] you know the first night the storm came
[1:23:11] he jumped overboard
[1:23:14] you understand but paul stuck with it
[1:23:18] you know as he was reading i said look
[1:23:19] at paul he's he he went to the next step
[1:23:22] and he went to the next step and he went
[1:23:25] to the next step
[1:23:26] he was being led of the spirit of the
[1:23:29] lord
[1:23:30] and you know and and that's part of the
[1:23:32] story he
[1:23:33] as he went through that the thing that
[1:23:36] struck me this morning
[1:23:37] is everybody's telling them don't go
[1:23:39] don't go don't go and they were speaking
[1:23:41] the truth
[1:23:43] you know this awaits you this awaits you
[1:23:46] but there must have been something else
[1:23:48] that was leading him that was moving in
[1:23:51] his heart
[1:23:52] and he stayed true to that you know what
[1:23:56] i mean and that's part of the character
[1:23:58] that was developed in him when you can
[1:24:00] stay true to
[1:24:01] something that's within your heart and
[1:24:04] not be swayed
[1:24:05] by all the opinion of the day or the
[1:24:08] spiritual movement
[1:24:10] of the day and you notice how brother
[1:24:11] george
[1:24:13] entitled it preaching from brother
[1:24:15] branham's absolute
[1:24:17] so that word was the absolute to paul
[1:24:20] even though people warned him what was
[1:24:23] ahead
[1:24:25] and the truth of what was ahead didn't
[1:24:27] deter
[1:24:28] him from what was in his heart
[1:24:31] and that's part of the character to be
[1:24:33] true to what's inside of you
[1:24:36] and we all believe the seed of god is in
[1:24:38] us
[1:24:39] and we believe that seed that was placed
[1:24:41] in us
[1:24:42] was placed in our heart because we were
[1:24:45] a part of the father
[1:24:47] in the beginning that's right and we're
[1:24:49] we are a part of that word
[1:24:52] and we were in his thinking and
[1:24:54] therefore
[1:24:55] he had and were an expression so
[1:24:58] he had a thought of us he knew what he
[1:25:01] called paul for
[1:25:03] when he met him on the road to damascus
[1:25:05] he knew he'd been wrong
[1:25:07] and didn't he say you'll find out the
[1:25:09] many things that you have to
[1:25:11] suffer for my namesake and so the whole
[1:25:14] god's plan totally unfolded in paul's
[1:25:18] life
[1:25:19] just the way it was predestinated that
[1:25:22] it unfold
[1:25:23] in paul life even until his end
[1:25:26] where he said i fought a good fight i
[1:25:29] run a good race
[1:25:30] now i go to receive the reward that
[1:25:32] waits
[1:25:33] for me the crown of righteousness that
[1:25:36] is laid up
[1:25:38] in heaven for me and and so
[1:25:41] i i i just think that when you think of
[1:25:44] that
[1:25:45] and and as brother george said that part
[1:25:47] of what i wanted to bring
[1:25:49] was to make it real to you
[1:25:52] you know and so it's no good to have
[1:25:54] religion which i think is the curse of
[1:25:57] denomination
[1:25:58] is to take religion out of our life
[1:26:02] and place it out here as a history
[1:26:05] and never see a living christ in our
[1:26:07] life every day
[1:26:09] in circumstances and situations and
[1:26:12] we're up
[1:26:12] so yeah we have a sickness that comes in
[1:26:17] to our assembly that happens
[1:26:20] but we also have a people that raise up
[1:26:22] in prayer
[1:26:25] you know we have trials and and
[1:26:28] and and tribulations but
[1:26:32] we have people that stand up and in a
[1:26:34] good spirit
[1:26:35] and a good conscience they don't trash
[1:26:38] their experience
[1:26:40] they don't trash their church they don't
[1:26:42] trash their life
[1:26:43] because they're going through a time of
[1:26:45] tribulation and trial
[1:26:47] they praise the lord all the more
[1:26:51] and you know and and so we see this
[1:26:55] character
[1:26:56] that's really being built in this book
[1:26:59] of acts so what we see is we see
[1:27:02] character
[1:27:04] and that's the only thing we'll take
[1:27:05] with us is our character
[1:27:08] so you know and that and peter writes
[1:27:10] don't think it's strange
[1:27:11] i mean look at all these trials and
[1:27:13] tribulations that
[1:27:14] paul went through you know i like
[1:27:18] par i like the parts of paul's life
[1:27:20] where he's on
[1:27:21] land and everything's good and he's
[1:27:23] having the meetings and fellowship
[1:27:26] but that was the smallest part of his
[1:27:27] life most of his life this guy was in
[1:27:30] prison
[1:27:32] you know he's in ships and wrecks and
[1:27:34] traveling and in bonds
[1:27:35] and everything you know i know everybody
[1:27:38] wants to be an apostle but they don't
[1:27:40] want to be a paul apostle
[1:27:43] you know if you know everybody wants to
[1:27:45] be a missionary
[1:27:46] and then that's where you get your
[1:27:48] suitcase you buy your first class ticket
[1:27:50] you fly somewhere and you stay in hilton
[1:27:53] and then you go to
[1:27:54] four or five meetings that are all
[1:27:56] designed and set up
[1:27:58] and they feed you and everything and now
[1:27:59] that's a new missionary
[1:28:01] no i'm sorry
[1:28:05] you know what i mean you can see the
[1:28:06] character
[1:28:08] that we need so when you get in your
[1:28:10] life
[1:28:11] and you hit in your situation god put
[1:28:14] you in your life
[1:28:15] where you're at the job you're in the
[1:28:18] circumstances you're in the trials
[1:28:20] you're in
[1:28:21] some of which we've brought upon
[1:28:22] ourselves
[1:28:24] some come upon us because of poor
[1:28:27] decisions
[1:28:28] some come upon us because of testing but
[1:28:31] remember
[1:28:31] some come upon us that because that we
[1:28:34] could be a witness
[1:28:36] that people can look upon our trial and
[1:28:39] see that you
[1:28:39] went through this trial with a smile you
[1:28:42] went through this trial with hope
[1:28:43] you went through this trial calling upon
[1:28:45] the name of the lord
[1:28:47] and therefore your candle is set upon a
[1:28:49] hill
[1:28:50] that it shines at light that all men can
[1:28:52] see
[1:28:53] your good works and glorify the father
[1:28:57] which is in heaven so you know
[1:29:02] you know in one place you sit back and
[1:29:04] you think well this is
[1:29:05] just simply going through the scriptures
[1:29:07] no there's a lot
[1:29:09] deeper revelation unfolding
[1:29:12] but tell you something you'll never hear
[1:29:15] it if first of all you don't open your
[1:29:17] heart to it
[1:29:19] and look for it you say is that
[1:29:22] scriptural seek and you shall find it
[1:29:25] knock and it shall be open unto you
[1:29:29] you know i pray for i sav
[1:29:33] that thou may see us so
[1:29:36] you know we've got to have that thirst
[1:29:37] and that hunger just say no wait a
[1:29:39] minute god sent brother george here
[1:29:42] and i feel he's led of the lord and and
[1:29:45] the
[1:29:45] the door opens for him and now he's been
[1:29:48] he's going to speak something to us
[1:29:50] you've got to sit back and say what's in
[1:29:51] that for me
[1:29:53] you know what's being said why what
[1:29:57] what because god is
[1:30:00] hidden in simplicity and revealed in the
[1:30:03] same
[1:30:04] and then you start reaching out and the
[1:30:06] more that you draw nigh
[1:30:07] unto him he'll draw an eye into you
[1:30:11] the more that you pray to have your eyes
[1:30:13] open the more you'll see
[1:30:15] the more you knock the more it'll be
[1:30:17] open
[1:30:18] to you and and and you understand
[1:30:22] these great uh these great lessons
[1:30:26] are to bring that character of christ in
[1:30:29] your life
[1:30:30] let this mind be in you that was also
[1:30:33] in the lord jesus amen that the works
[1:30:37] that i do you shall do
[1:30:41] also and this is what we want is we want
[1:30:44] that christ
[1:30:45] like life in our lives because of the
[1:30:47] same spirit
[1:30:49] that dwelt in jesus christ dwell
[1:30:53] in your mortal bodies it shall also
[1:30:55] quicken
[1:30:56] you and that's what we want
[1:31:00] we want to be quickened so understand
[1:31:03] in order to be quickened you've got to
[1:31:06] have character
[1:31:08] and in order to have character you're
[1:31:10] going to have to have testing
[1:31:12] and it's more precious than gold so you
[1:31:16] look at paul in the great ascension
[1:31:20] that he made it to become
[1:31:23] a writer of the new testament
[1:31:27] that was if i could say that
[1:31:33] acknowledgement and that esteem
[1:31:36] that's placed upon him as being the
[1:31:39] first church age messenger
[1:31:41] and the writer of the new testament
[1:31:46] was not given without a price
[1:31:51] and he was willing to pay the price in
[1:31:54] order to fit
[1:31:55] the reward and even with our own
[1:31:58] messenger
[1:31:59] you know his testimony to come to that
[1:32:02] place
[1:32:03] where he could take that position it
[1:32:06] didn't come without a price
[1:32:09] amen so you know you may not have to pay
[1:32:12] a
[1:32:12] price but you should always be willing
[1:32:16] to pay it that's up to god to what
[1:32:20] test that he wants to put you through
[1:32:22] but no matter what it is
[1:32:24] always open your heart and be willing
[1:32:27] and to take whatever comes your way take
[1:32:29] it with a christ-like spirit
[1:32:31] and with hope and with testimony on your
[1:32:34] lips
[1:32:35] that you're in the palm of god's hand
[1:32:37] and nothing
[1:32:38] can pluck you out so god bless you so
[1:32:41] what we're going to do
[1:32:42] is we're going to have billy come and
[1:32:45] and
[1:32:45] we're going to have moses sing some more
[1:32:47] songs
[1:32:48] and if if i can't get moses to move over
[1:32:51] here
[1:32:52] i'm going to wear him out
[1:32:55] when he's here amen you know i
[1:32:59] i'm hoping that i can get moses someday
[1:33:02] and
[1:33:02] sit down and visit with him and
[1:33:05] i know he feels a little call in his
[1:33:08] life and someday i'd like to have
[1:33:09] minister to us and just
[1:33:12] share some of the word and the things
[1:33:13] that are on his heart
[1:33:15] and uh and uh so billy if
[1:33:19] you'd come and you can just i'll put
[1:33:22] the management of brother moses into
[1:33:24] your hands
[1:33:26] and uh and we just hope that we just
[1:33:30] have
[1:33:31] a wonderful time don't don't you love it
[1:33:32] when moses sings in about 25 different
[1:33:35] languages
[1:33:39] so maybe we can set a a guinness book of
[1:33:42] world records
[1:33:43] the most language is saying in one song
[1:33:46] in the service but anyway we love you
[1:33:48] moses
