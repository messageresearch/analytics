Description:
Br. David McGeary
April 2, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

amen amen what a God we serve amen he's mindful of us tonight let's approach him father we heard your word this morning that you have a law in that law is your word that law is so strong that heaven and earth will pass away but the law of your word will remain for it it governs from one end of Eternity to the other it is the source of all life it is the source of all truth and reality and father part of that great law is the believer's right to approach you to come to you and to cast our cares upon you for you careth for us part of that law father is that if we call upon your name that you'll be faithful and just to hear our petitions father when we are unrighteous and unworthy to come into your throne Lord you made a way through your son and Lord we use that law of the blood of Jesus Christ who cleanse us from all righteousness to bring our petitions before you this evening and ask that you would Grant to us the blessings of your great word fathers we just have a little short time of fellowship before communion Lord we just can do nothing but commit ourselves into your hands trust that you will be our portion we love you and we ask you to strengthen us this evening in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you thank you musicians I appreciate our musicians so much I appreciated that Trio there that's that was pretty good singing wasn't it yeah nobody's got anything on us sorry anyway that's the way I feel you know you got to be honest right hey man let's open our Bibles up over to the uh book of uh Nehemiah and we're gonna just I'm just going to build on a little something that uh my brother preached this morning and I just kind of add to it I think it was a wonderful theme for the day I think it fits in with the things that were fellowshipping around and uh let's we'll read the 19th and the 20th verse of the third chapter and and again I don't know these names are are kind of hard for me to pronounce but I never could spell or read and that's because real early I figured they all had it wrong and I had it right I would I was a phonetic speller I I just kind of went how the word sounded you know and um but anyway so I've never had that gift my I always felt a spirit I I always felt it Sprite and so the kids grew up under the anointing of the Holy Sprite and so they used to they used to go to the store and point to the shelf and said Daddy there's some of that Sprite that your spirit that you talked about you know and uh but anyway so you just bear with me it's nice to have things I'd leave our brother uh quote there that God bless you brother nice to have you and and uh so Andrew and Grace I don't know this isn't your last Sunday with it is it no you'll be here so I got a few more weeks to pick on you right good good a good strong relationship it's always built with a good fight did you ever know that I I fought my way through school I went on the playground two days the first day me and somebody was having it out and you know what I fought everybody and all those people that ever got in a fight with were my best friends and uh so there's only one guy I'm in a fight with that's not my best friend and we'll talk about him tonight in a different light uh anyway so let's read here it says but uh sand Bal at I guess and hormonite and Toba tobana or tobiah anybody want to give that a try all right there we go and the and the servants the amorites and the jejumites and uh Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us and I like that the god of heaven will prosperize amen and it says therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this evening you know our brother spoke this morning about the believer's right to bring his petition uh to the throne and we and we listen to a wonderful piece a message uh out of I believe it was the restoration of the Bride treat about the believer's right to take the word of God and to go uh bring that and lay claim to that which was taken from him and uh and uh there's principles that run through all throughout the scripture and you can always go back through the scripture and you'll find that everything started in uh Genesis and it continues on all the way through into the uh time of the Book of Revelation and this the tactic that Satan used in the beginning in the garden is the same tactic that he continually uses all the way down through time we know that that he picked the battle with Eve the ground that he would fight her on and oppose her and he chose that battle and that was reasoning and that reasoning sets forth in the mind uh where uh the enemy always brings things to consider you know have you considered have you have you thought of this have you thought of that have you thought of this and my goodness and nowadays uh I don't know everything's out there that you can imagine the imaginations of man there you could take you a lifetime in fact they have this thing now they call artificial intelligence that should tell you how good our intelligence is if our intelligence can produce something that's artificial that's going in the wrong way well this great artificial intelligence that they have they now are saying we better slow this down because it's starting to do things that they didn't know it could do it's got built in algorithms is that what it's good I think I said it right it's got these built-in doodads that can that can just go out there and and uh you know grab information and put it together and and one guy came up he's a great military guy that's in charge of our stuff he says well we did a test and we asked it to find flaws in our system and I I'd forget what it was in 13 hours or something it found three or four major flaws and it all of a sudden dawned on them that everybody's got this well you know it didn't take uh didn't take me very long to know because that there's a flaw in the system because it said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away so I know that anything that's contrary to the word of God's flawed already you know what I mean the whole life flawed the whole civilization thought whole education thought it's all flawed because it's where is it leading is leading to destruction there's there's no truth in it there's no reality in it it isn't what lasts but that they're saying he says oh no he said this this artificial intelligence is going to put 300 million people out of work and you know then I thought oh my I thought I I guess that's not too bad for me I I don't work much anymore and and it's okay and and then I got to thinking about oh what about the the young people that are coming up and after just one more burden to to put on him you know what I mean one thing oh what am I going to do what am I going to do for work what am I going to do for this and and I'm not smart and all this you if you know and then all that stuff floods in and people are out there and people are going to doctors now because they've got environmental anxiety and they're worried about the air and they're worried about the Sun and they're worried about this and now they're worried about a machine taking their job and and all these things and all this pressure is coming on and I thought you know the believer all he's got to do is sit down a moment and get in the presence of God and and Let the Peace of the Lord settle in their heart and and just come in and just think a moment you know he said he said the righteous shall not beg bread now I don't I don't know uh how that will be but I know it will be because he said so I know that the righteous will not beg bread whether they have two loaves of bread and three fishies are are whatever manner it comes into that that we have a God that's Jehovah Jireh that he'll provide for his own and that that that's never laid to rest you understand as our brother said this morning that's built in to the law of God from eternity when God spoke that in eternity he knew what lied ahead amen so you don't make Provisions for something that's not there you know what I mean you make perfusions so he made a provision for us he made a sacrifice for us well we were yet centered you know before well we were yet sinners he died for us he made a provision for it so the very law of God itself the and the law of God is the word of God it's the essence of God it could what the law is is what God spoke into motion and whatever he spoke he knew the beginning of it and he knew the end of it and there's nothing in between that can stop it the best the enemy can do is hinder it but he can't stop it unbelief does not stop God all that the father had given me will come in that settled and and I believe that uh it's a desire of the heart because when I I Look to what the Lord trying to tell us and I think that's what he's trying to call his children back to because it was such a theme of the messenger of the hour to come back to the church and look at the denominational systems and look what they were running after they were building they were making big systems there there were men rising up in their midst of prestige and and there begin to become doctors and Scholars and people that supposedly knew more about the word that that the people were beginning to shrink back from what their inheritance were they became afraid to partake in what that was given them to partake in but you understand that what's given to the Church depart partaken and laid out in the in the promises of God that these a Twain would be one and he became us that we could become him and and what his desire for us to come to is the place that we would not feel it robbery to be equal to God another if I could say it this way the thoughts that God had of you in the beginning what he knew of you what he made you to be that you wouldn't be afraid you wouldn't be fearful to step up and to be what he said you could be that you'd be willing to take that position and you you've got to take that out of the hands of the enemy you got to go possess that because he points at the weaknesses of your flesh he points at your shortcomings he he points at everything about you that is weak and frail but that's not what you're built in you're not built in your strength it's not by strength it's not by might but it's by my spirit saith the Lord it's by his spirit that you will be there it's by his spirit that he will overcome it doesn't matter what weaknesses you have because he has the ability and the power over the weakness and that's why we keep pressing the mark and we know that and and I'm not the only Bible person that teaches uh out of nehemiah's preachers that preached out of esri Nehemiah for ages and and it's always the same theme many ministers and doctors and books and things have been written at the type of the building of the wall as the type of the building of the Christian these are simple things we see in the word of God let's go back as we talked about this place in Nehemiah where they are there building the wall but we know 16 years later uh that earlier that when the Great king Cyrus took over the Babylonian Empire and we know the story how the Jews were carried off into captivity under Babylon and how that all the temple gold and Temple items of worship and everything and that God the scripture says that God moved upon that king's heart oh my I I could preach on that for hours and hours and hours how many has ever seen God move on somebody else in your behalf amen I I I'll tell you the God's a wonderful God I know I tell you this story but it Thrills my heart I remember I bought a piece of I bought an old old Lexus you know the thing was probably 13 14 years old and I bought it you know but I was young back then and I thought of it had an L on the front of it it made you something special you know what I mean and uh okay and uh I I really think that L stands for a look the other way because this is just really a Camry with a l Road on it you know what I mean but if you like that letter L we'll charge you fourteen thousand dollars more and you can walk that around and feel important you know and I bought this car and it was kind of a one very good it's a good car but um I don't know it just seemed like the transmission Went Out Boy and I worked on a speech for that guy for days and days and days you know and they sold me the car I don't know probably five or six thousand dollars you know and and I think they were embarrassed that the thing was on their lot and they was just hoping someone hurried come by and get it off there you know but well I drove out of there thinking that you know I was built for Success because I was driving a 15 year old Lexus you know what I mean and and I remember the transmission went out on it now I just got to the place and I thought man I'm gonna go read this guy the right act and well I'm going to tell him and boy I was just really gonna let him have it and like the time I was going to put the skunk oil on my shoes and walk through the bank because a check bounce that I didn't think should bounce you know I I don't know if any of you have mind battles but uh I got a real active mind if you know what I mean and uh so anyway I I went down there and I remember I Was preparing to go and the Lord come down spoke to me and he said go in there and do this just ask him you know humble yourself and ask him so I went there and I sat down and of course that one little guy sitting on this shoulder saying let them have it and the other guy said just do it I say so I sat down there and I said sir I said you know just to be honest with you this was probably a little better card than I can drive and and the transmission went out and I don't think I have the money to fix it and the lord gave me the words to is there anything you can do to help me you know the Lord moved upon that guy then he said I'll tell you what I can do for you David and and I began to realize that he probably sold 70 80 000 cars all day long you know what I mean I mean uh you know my little six dollars and fifty cents an hour on his uh little application form probably didn't match up to the six seven hundred thousand dollar a year payments and incomes that people were making but he said I'll tell you what I do David he said if you'll just pay for the parts I'll fix it all up for you and he did exceedingly and abundantly above what I could even ask her thing and God moved upon him on my behalf and that's the Gateway of humility because it's human nature to resist the proud and the arrogant if it's human nature I've seen it with guys on job sites I've seen it in in car dealerships I've seen everything where those egos get battling it no longer has nothing to do with anything but I'm just I'm not going to give an inch and you're not going to give an inch and and it's just a great big goal uh you know a bull fight and and you know bless God you know what I mean and everybody's ready to rumble you know what I mean and you get two losers but remember humility is the doorway for God to come move on your behalf if you'll just take the humble side if you'll just humble your sight leave you'll just sit back and place it as we heard this morning place it back in the Throne of God place it back in the law of God said Lord you said you'd fight my battles because Lord I I may have got myself in this position like the song says Satan got me in trouble but Jesus got me out and just let God work for you it works Church it works taking the humble way works every time amen because he's got you and you know we have the same right I've got your back he's got you he's got you so much that nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand you take in the humble side will never never hurt you it'll never hurt you but it will allow him to identify himself with you because you are manifesting one of his attributes now he's got a pathway to come and work on your behalf but he can't bear Witness to a bad attitude he can't bear witness to something that's not like him it's okay I could never say enough words even the scripture says that he humbled himself even unto the death of the cross that's something and what did it do it changed the world so let's turn back over here to Ezra just for a moment I'm just going to go through this real quick and and uh so this is 16 years earlier King Cyrus lets the Jews return back to Jerusalem and of course we know that Nebuchadnezzar sacked a Jerusalem he tore it down burnt the gates tore down the Walls now the Jews are returning back to that land and the first thing that they want to do is they want to build the temple so the book of Ezra is the building of the temple but in the fourth chapter of the book of Ezra it reads like this this is well it I'm not going to read it the way it's written but you read it that's the way it's written uh anytime I read these names and everything I think there's a general word they have for it called AB living now when the adversary of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the Captivity built the temple unto the Lord God of Israel then they came to zerubula and the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esser hadam king of assur which brought us up hither now I want you to notice the Heart part about these things is that there was a law of Separation amongst the Jews they weren't supposed to intermarry they were supposed to be separate do you know that a law always applies to God's children that were different were separate we're not like other people we're not like other faiths we're not like other belief the very scripture says to it says come out from amongst them and be ye separate and and it it's a it's something that you've got to understand that Satan has no part of your inheritance he has no part of your blessings he he he he wants to he he wants to come in the disguise of supplying you a blessing that he can be a part of your glory but God does not share his glory with anybody he doesn't do it it can so many times we'd see things that that might appear to be opportunity or might it be appear to be a blessing but there's a great Revelation and understanding in this if God's going to provide a way he'll provide the way foreign you got to just watch and make sure and these men they knew this they knew that it was their Temple now these are people that weren't Jews they served the same God because they were all of the the different descendants of Ishmael and and different ones so they claimed to be Christians oh but you understand they've claimed an inheritance that wasn't there they claimed and and they wanted to dilute the purity of the word of God they wanted to dilute the uh the the the the the this Temple worship as being the place that God placed his name for the the children of Israel and Isaac's descendants those that were circumcised according to uh the uh the law and and these things I don't know if circumcision was in place at this time or not but what I'm saying they were separated out do you understand what I'm saying right that they were a separate yes they this they were circumcised they were they were separated out so they were a separated people that's one of the hardest things for us to do is this day separated touch not the unclean thing you know it it's difficult because we want to do it but I just want to follow this little that thought down today there's so many ways we can go with it and they came into Jerusalem and said let us build with you for we seek your God and jerus and Yeshua and the rest of the chiefs of the fathers of Israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build and house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded us then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building oh isn't that something one moment they said let us build let us join in let us build this thing and they said no you have no part of us you don't have a a a a a you don't have a part in this this is our Temple This Is Our God these are our Commandments and we're going to keep these Commandments and and we're not going to give you access to this Temple a a part of the inheritance of this Temple we are not going to open the door for you to come in here and say I'm coming into this building and worship here and defy the house of the Living God and give them an Avenue because they said we built it we have a right to come in he has not changed it's the same thing in the garden oh surely you won't die let me in they wanted this great inheritance and they said you don't have he says then he says then the hands of the people he said then the people of the land weaken the hand of the people of Judah and troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose and the days of all the days of Cyrus King of Persia even until the reign of Darius King of Persia and the reign of whatever in the beginning of his Reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and of Jerusalem now I want you to see that the adversary never wants you to build what God wants you to build the scriptures are amazing oh when it comes to the word of God and that's what he's saying is God would have never given us a weapon if he didn't know there was a battle so we know that that even in the message uh uh the greatest battle ever fought the great theme of that message is to get the believer to put his faith in his weapon to believe that the word of God alone has the power to meet whatever challenge what could be brought against you look and it doesn't matter how he comes it doesn't make sense it never made sense in the scripture for a man with a little young man maybe a teenager boy a lot of the historians try to make David 14 years old you know and uh you know I I was visiting with Ariel today he's 14 years old you know but that's that he's a strong nice handsome strong tall young man but that's not what the scripture said about David David was ready probably looked more like me I'm pretty ready and so you know just a little guy now you would never expect something of little like that to meet a giant but that's not where David's Faith was David's Faith was in the word of God his faith was God gave me charge over these sheep it wasn't the bear there wasn't a lion that motivated him it was a commission that he had that he has given charge over those sheep and he was going to do everything he could to protect that charge he didn't know if he was going to defeat that line but he's going to fight it because he's given charge his duty was to drive that line away to fight it he didn't know about Kabir because Duty was given to fight it he was about his duty you know and we've been given a duty we've been given a duty that in every circumstance we put Jesus Christ forward that's what our life does we put Christ forward someone asked me he said do you and sister Leslie ever fight I said we'd probably fight a lot more but she's a Christian you know what I mean it don't matter you put Christ forward you turn the other cheat you take the humble side that that's our duty and so his charge was my duty is the go out and do everything I can to protect these sheep the minute he stepped into the line of duty God was obligated to give him Victorious over that lion because he had a throne that he was supposed to set on if I could say this to you this evening all things are possible I don't know what they are but they're still possible I don't know what they'll be but they're still possible because all things are possible to them that believe in the Lord I'll worry about it when I get there but I'm not locked into any circumstance I'm not locked into any situation I don't care what's there I'll rise above it like the song We Sing you know you you just set your wings you know if if the mountain won't move we'll fly amen all things are possible I don't know what they are I don't know what it is I don't got a pre a notice Satan's never sent me a telegram telling me he's going to be there if Satan sent me a Telegram and said I'm going to be here at such and such time how many of you would show up you go ahead because I ain't you won't find me anywhere near that guy if I know it's him I have no part of them I have no Fellowship I have no Fellowship in his ideas I have no Fellowship in his thoughts I have no Fellowship in his thinking there's nothing about him I want to know there's nothing about him all I know is He's a snail and that's all he is and he's a liar he's the father of all lies there's no truth in him uh I he don't deserve the time of day but yet he's there and anytime anybody ever wants to do something for God the enemy is always trying to hinder the church being built into what it should be built whether it's giving them a rabbit Trail to run down whether it's to give them a Doctrine to go running after uh whether it's to give up a movement to rise up whatever he can do and what does he appear as he appears as an angel of Light he appears like oh this is God and and this is great and and this is this and this is that and all he's trying to do is pull their eyes off of what that your eyes should be set on I believe his brother Mike said about the eye of God of what path is he leading me down what works has he foreordained for me to walk in what is it to you if he tarries till I come follow me whatever he can do to to to to shake you or to or or to move you and what is he shaking not only is he trying to shake your faith but he's trying to shake your journey your accomplishment Peter says it this way in First Peter the fourth chapter I was going to start with the 12th verse but there's so much wisdom in the 11th verse first Peter 4 11. it says if any man speak let him speak as the Oracle of God If any man minister let him do it as the ability which God giveth Ah that's a great scripture too many times people try to imitate Ministries or results you know God's got an ear too act you know sometimes we might have somebody sing and oh they might not have the best tune in the world or the words might just not rhyme like uh you you know some uh great Shakespeare had written them but you don't know what music is to God's ear you know music that God's yours what comes out of the heart you get places and all of a sudden you know it's all about how good their musicians are and who can keep beat and if someone can't hit the string just right they're out of the group and and we've got a great internet presence I don't want an internet presence you know what I mean I just want us to know when he's here and when he's here I want us to praise His name I want him to worship him I want him to have his way okay if you want to lift sing and lift your hands up the Lord feel free to do it but do it for him not to create an atmosphere not to create a service not to delay anything of this world let it let it let your joy rise up in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and just let the word of God become our our great thing and he says and do it to the ability in order to do it put all your God into whatever you do I believe Billy Paul shared with us here and and me personally he told me he said David my father told me he said if you be you're going to be a bum don't you work one day in your life what is that what a statement be the best do it according to your ability you know that scripture ought to motivate every single one of us to ask ourselves what's my ability not my ability as I can do this and I can do that I'm not talking about a perverted side of it of having an ego we're talking about God what did you give me that I can do You Are My Strength Lord I can do this and it goes on to say he said which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified so yeah it ain't beautiful let him do it according to the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion forever and ever amen now beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you that's if I could say the bottom theme of what that we're talking about think it not strange that this adversary resisting you is a strange thing in other words like it shouldn't happen it's going to happen he says but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceedingly Joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorify just an amazing statement and then you turn over to Thessalonians and and I think this is a striking scripture in Thessalonians 3 and 3. it says and he's talking about the Affliction that he was in and and the trouble that he was going through and how they were withstanding him and and and and and being in prison and all the different things that Paul went through and he says this in the in the third verse he says that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed there unto for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye no for this cause when I could no longer for a bear I sent to know your faith let's by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labor be in vain you know it's absolutely appointed to the believer that the adversary is going to withstand you every time that you want to get an inch with God he's going to be there he's going to try to keep you from climbing that ladder if he has to he'll wave the mirror in front of you he'll try to look he'll try to always show you what you are but a Believer never goes by what they are they only go by what's spoken what they are to be that's what they wrote her yeah I'm like this but it's not I don't want to be like this and he promised me I'm not going to remain like this so I don't care that's not what I'm seeing as I spoke many years ago that's not the real me we're going forward we're marching we're going to have to fight all the way through and he's got to step up his game Satan does he's got to stop you he can't let you bear arms he wants to feed you ammunition that don't work he wants to join in your fight and give you blanks and give you dummies and give you programs and things that that don't work there's only one weapon that works it's by these great and precious promises that we are partakers of divine nature it's when you can take a promise of God and you can hold that promise of God up here and say I don't care what you do this is what's going to come to pass because it's a promise from the promissor that cannot lie you know when he starts saying well what about this and what about that and what about this symptoms isn't the Cure you could get rid of all the symptoms and still be sick I know some of us have had that covet thing that went around I know a person that had seven vaccines you know why they've had seven vaccines they've took they've had covet seven times it's according to your faith whether you take it or whether you don't I don't trust any of it it's only one thing I know is real this is real and I know if I believe this despite my weaknesses despite my failures despite the number of times that I fail there's one thing God can't do and that's lie and the minute I can approach him and say Lord you said so because I I I it didn't say if I was this and it didn't say if I was that it says one thing if I would confess my sins that you'd be faithful and just to forgive them if I would let you know that I failed here and I've done this and I'm sorry I've done that you would throw those in the sea of your God's forgetfulness he told me that then I could approach your throne under the shed blood and I could have what I asked for and that's the church that God wants to start rising up he wants people to start looking at this enemy and said it's appointed to me Satan that you would come I knew you would be here I believe if we read the scripture I may have read it I'll read it again again found in in Peter and and this is the fifth chapter and as we get ready for communion the fifth verse of the fifth chapter of Peter I think maybe it was read this morning I'm not sure likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the elders yea of all ye be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give Grace unto thee humble oh do you see that doorway of humility amen you know it it don't matter when you start if you start to measure Yourself by money there's already somebody that's got more money I don't measure Myself by money I measure Myself by my inheritance my father owns the cattle on a thousand Hill the Shah of Iran at one time was one of the richest men of the world he had a 747 I believe it was back then and it was nothing but a hospital it had a full team of Surgeons it had a full nursing staff it had every drug and everything it followed him all around wherever he went didn't matter how many doctors he had because our messenger told us he said if God's going to take you there's not enough doctors there's not enough medicine and anything to keep you here but if God wants you to stay here there's not enough devils and there's not enough sickness and there's not enough anything that that he can take you and that that could you we there's no need us putting our rest in anything anymore I mean how much more news do we need to understand this world is falling apart that we've got to move our affections away from the things of the world and start turning back to the promises that God's given us to survive by we're only going to survive by the promises of God's word you know it's going to keep you from here on out the supernatural because you don't fit there's all kinds of things in the news of them coming after the Catholic Church wait till they find out what we believe what do you think they're doing they're trying to create hate crime well you got to have a crime against somebody right well animals got more rights than a lot of humans not against dogs or cats or rats I'm we'd be surprised pretty soon if there's a organization to save the New York rat oh you laugh I remember when they're sitting on a plane I was sitting there and I said you know something one day they're going to make a book about walking I thought that that's hilarious you know I just laughed as I was walking yeah now we watch you'll write a book about walking now you've got walking shoes walking books walking trails you know take a walk walk walk walk you know and you can go on and on it doesn't matter see there's there's nothing left they're forming this great thing oh you know it's against this faith and against this you know where that's all leading to it's all leading to it's all leading to okay let's let's identify the with religions are those that can have hate crimes against you got to declare yourself before there's a hate crime oh they're going to gather up and say these are all the Christians and these are all the groups and and everybody's going to apply for all this and under a great big disguise as an angel of Light like they're wanting to join themselves to us in some great form of Christianity let us join you and help promote your God we have nothing to do with them we are not going to rely on them we are not going to trust them we are going to lay our faith in one thing and that's God's word that's the promises of God's word that's the supernatural God that promised us that he would take care of us and when it gets too bad he'll take us out but don't think it's strange that we have an adversary don't think it's strange that Satan's gonna fight you on every level the only thing is strange he's going to play games in your mind don't think it's strange that he's going to try to take all your hope away don't think it's stranger he's going to try to make the situation look impossible all things are possible and I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthened me the church of the Living God is being called back to return to the supernatural not in the disguise of any movement or worship or anything but in the individual Soldier meeting Satan his adversary and and did I ever finish reading that scripture I don't know if I did let me read it again before I close because it's a it's a great scripture it says humble yourself that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon Him for he careth for you this is the hour of the church where she comes to the place that the world no longer has anything to offer her there's nothing that she's offering that you want to be a part of why do we work to redeem the time to redeem the days why do we work because if we stole that we can give why are we doing what we're doing we're we're waiting out the time because we're looking up for our Redemption draweth nigh we're we've we've been cast out they don't want you don't want to get back in thank God they he said this cast your cares upon Him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he made devour I think Peter was well acquainted with the Devil he was well acquainted with them we don't have to like them we don't give him no glory we don't listen to him but when he came to Jesus Jesus said get behind me get behind me because it is written a body that's fitted and joined together with every member supplying the need to the other if I could say it like this every member is standing at his gate and he's not going to let Satan enter into the body through his his portal Jesus said he Sanctified himself for our sake it's it's when we understand that wait a minute I I cannot let this worry overtake me because if I let this worry overtake me then it if I'm not careful it'll overtake another and another you say give me word A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump it's when we start standing up we don't stand up against people we resist our adversary when he draws a painting no matter how realistic he looks if it don't line up with this amen it's Modern Art it ain't real you've got to look through it until you see the revelation of God's word standing in it every deceit of Satan has got God's word standing in it Every Lie of Satan's got God's true word in it and it's such a call now Church for us to return back and be restored to the faith of our fathers to the battle that they fought they all long to be here to be in your spot young women every sister in that church would love to be here today to stand against the Wows of the devil that's trying to turn you into something that you're not to get you to give away your virtue your motherhood your sanctity young men the same thing all them guys would want to be there so they could turn their head that church was crying out let me stand in this age but God chose you and he gave you a weapon and he gave you his Spirit to fight with he gave you himself and he just says to the church the hold I stand at the door and knock behold I stand the door and knock if you will open up I'll come in and sup with you that that's not a history book story you are the door we're the door that he's knocking what's he trying to do prophet of God said he's trying to get back in his church why does he want to get back in his church because he wants to throw that devil into the Lake of Fire and you're his army you're his Soldier he wants you to start putting the bullets in your gun and start pulling the trigger and fighting a member of the prophet of God preaching he goes back a man that was there told me he said brother ma'am stepped back from the pulpit and he looked you know how he would get in that realm where he just seemed to take that stagger step so under the anointing Soul looking out there and he said he reached down like he drew his sword and said who will take their sword and Stand By Me I want to draw My Sword I want to get back in the fight I want to get back on the battlefield I'm not going to go hunt him but Betty when he comes I'm going to be ready the trial in one hand and my sword and the other God bless you and I'm going to ask brother Billy to come and read the communion scriptures for us before we pray brother Billy would you come thank you the ability reads the scripture it says for I have received of the Lord of First Corinthians chapter 11. the 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me and after the same manner he took the cup when he had stopped saying this is it says this cup is the New Testament in my blood do the do do do this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as often as ye eat eat ye eat of this bread and drink the cut this cup you do this you do show the Lord's death till I come wherefore whatsoever shall eat and this bread and drink this cup unworthily of the Lord and Wordly shall be guilty of the blood of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup and drinketh unworldly eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and and secretly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when we when ye come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come foreign
