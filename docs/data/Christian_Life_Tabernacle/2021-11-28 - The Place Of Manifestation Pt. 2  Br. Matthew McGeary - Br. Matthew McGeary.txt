started to think back at what we could have been maybe where we would be today if you didn't come by our way lord oh god our minds don't even like to go there the lord you met us in our time of need and we're so thankful tonight to be able to rejoice and to tell you that we love you that we thank you that we appreciate your god lord we just want to take a little time now to look into your word and ask that you would just come by this evening lord just whisper little love secrets into the ear of your bride that they might be encouraged tonight or maybe we can speak back to you lord in our heart as maybe the thought would come forward that we could start to rejoice and we can start to thank you for your great love that you've loved us with we pray lord we just ask now you take complete control of the service and jesus christ's name we ask it amen hallelujah praise the lord amen thank you musicians amen we'll just turn in our bibles to deuteronomy 16. once again i say bear with me i'm a little hoarse but i don't imagine being too long tonight but we just maybe want to look in here and see if something can be said that would encourage you i believe if you've come expecting just in the reading of the word or a reading of a quote god can god can speak to you and so we're thankful for that and uh just to continue um along the lines of where we were just reading in deuteronomy 16 and we'll just read verse 5 and 6 it says thou mayest not sacrifice the passover with any of thy yeats which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there shalt thou sacrifice the passover at even and at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt amen you may be seated and maybe just to uh try to launch from a little of what we spoke on before we read this quote here out of god's provided place of worship says but we must find where he put his name for it is it is his only provided gate amen glory watch where did he put his name in his son and skipping down he says jesus said i come in my father's name and you receive me not you want the scripture on that saint john 5 43 i came in my father's name and you received me not then the father put his own name which is jesus in the sun and he's the way he's the door he's the house he's where god chose to put his name god never put his name in me never put it in the church he never put it in methodist baptist catholic but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel immanuel means god with us he put it in christ emmanuel god with us and so we know that we're living in an hour that god has come amongst us and he has manifested in his presence amongst the bride amen god has come amongst us and has manifested his presence amongst the bride as as i'm reminded just in saying that there was a time where the devil was buffeting at the prophet and he there was a demon standing there in his room and he was telling him you're nothing but a bluff he was he was telling the prophet of god who had seen mighty works that was walking with the angel of the lord he was uh one that god was using to interpret his word and there the devil was coming against him and telling him he said nothing of a bluff well i'm encouraged by that because i see how the devil tries to do the same thing against me when i'm trying to make a stand upon the word of god and and i'm looking into the bible and i'm looking into the promises and i'm looking into the message where it speaks of a bride and an overcomer and somebody that's rising up in the end time that's eating the book and taking this message and that's running with it into the the catching away of the bride and and all of these great things that have been spoken and we saw one come to maturity we saw a sheath wave offering come with the power of the spoken word and and dominion over the earth a son of god coming into his position again and that speaks to my heart something in me says that that is me that's what i'm called to be if that was a first one that coming to maturity then i was planted in the same field that good ground that god had placed his seed word in and as i seen the first one what was the chief wave offering it was the first one that come to maturity and so just as we saw jesus christ a first one that came to maturity that was waved over the people away back to them over at pentecost he come into maturity and now we see one amongst us again according to divine promise in the end time that god said that he would restore all things living in an age of restoration not to just restore us back to an age of pentecost there at the beginning of the church ages but god had come back to restore us all the way back to eden all the way back to what adam had lost back to that title deep book of redemption back into the hand of man again back into a place and a position where he had full control and dominion that he could speak the word and it was no longer the man speaking but it was god speaking that is what god is trying to tell the bride of christ tonight that you're coming back into full authority you're coming back into that position you're coming into a maturity that we saw of that first one that came in maturity and something in your heart wants to believe it something in your heart is saying yay and amen to the word something then you say lord i believe it but the but the devil's trying to come and buff it at your flesh and tell you you're nothing but a bluff or where is the mighty works seen in you oh he's trying to tell you but oh i'm i'm so thankful as the prophet of god oh god help me tonight that he would start to preach the breaking of the seals he would start there and preaching god hiding himself in simplicity but what was he speaking of he took the scripture there said despise not the day of small things there was a time where the temple had been torn down and they had come back to rebuild the temple and the men of all that had saw the former tabernacle they wept there because they settled the new tabernacle is not like the old one but he said oh no don't despise the day of simple things we're living in an hour in the third pool where it's not a public show it's not some big dispensation running out and raising the dead and if you're out the hospitals and some big united states revival with all of these evidences and so many things to point to for some type of vindication but there's been a people that have been cut away into a secret place in that third pool where he said i will meet you in there there's something happening there's a change happening just like abraham and sarah had received a promise and day by day they were walking according to the promise because they had met jesus christ they were in the presence of the revealing of melchizedek there and he said according to the time of life and now the bride is walking under the same dispensation by divine promise looking for the day in the hour that your bodies are going to be changed oh and the devil's trying to look at you he's trying to point to you he's trying to tell you you're nothing but a bluff nothing's really happening what's going on in your life oh you you think you're somebody oh where's the mighty words oh oh yeah he come on now he tries to tell you oh that that you shall do the greater well where are the greater works in your life where's the manifestation of the things of god in your life you say you believe the message where's the message in you and he'll start to to corner you into such a way where you start to look at your faults and failures but i'm not so much interested in us looking at maybe our faults and failures but do you believe the message is there something in you despite your failures is there something in you despite your faults is there something in you that you can look at yourself and rush you know i'm not that really good i don't really measure up that well i realize there's so much more i want to do but when you lay it all down is there something in you says lord i don't understand it but i believe it lord i'm looking for the day of the manifestation of these things that you have spoken in my life and i might fall one time two time a million times lord but there's something in me that can't give up there's something to me that can't stop why because it's not you it's god and you he's not willing to to just as he was not willing to suffer to see his holy one see corruption he's not willing to see you see corruption either he's not willing to leave you down and out like that but god wants to lift you up he wants to raise you up he wants to bring you into all of the manifestation of what he spoke but we're faced with the faults we're faced with the failures we're faced with the devil buffeting of us and say you're nothing but a bluff but oh i like that story because i'm reminded that they're in that place that the prophet said satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you and that's what we need to do saints if it's contrary to the word don't take it let's make this simple tonight what did god say about you that's all that matters have you considered my servant job what'd he say he was a perfect man upright in his generation there's nobody like him oh oh you you could you could uh take the same approach and him say have you considered my bride and he was saying she's perfect she's without spot she's out with out without regular there's not even a blemish in her and the devil would try to come and tell him say well now wait a second now wait a second lord what are you talking about just the other day but i'm so encouraged that if you've pled the blood of jesus christ if you have taken your faults and your failures and you have pled the blood of jesus christ look the prophet would even admonish the people that were coming into the prayer line he would tell him look if you have something you need to make right and you don't want the public to know because i'm not in control but if you come up here with unconfessed sin in your life it'll be exposed and it might just be told out there what your problem is is what you're facing but if it's under the blood of jesus christ there your your own accuser the devil could try to say well now you say she's perfect but i got a different record i got a different book that i'm looking at and he would start to tell the lord well they did this and they did that and they did this over this time do you remember that and if you have pled the blood of jesus christ i'm so encouraged to know that god would stand there and look at the devil the all-knowing god who knows all things and could look at that devil and truthfully not lying but truthfully say i don't know what you're talking about what sin oh you talk about a grace you talk about a thanksgiving so let's not look at your faults let's not i know we say this many times but i believe that we are limited so much in our freedom of worship we're limited in so much that we will step out by faith because we're limited by this this these five senses and these gates of our flesh but oh we're to possess the gate of our enemy we're to possess these gates we're not worried about those gates the only gate i'm worried about is faith that that one that takes root in the word of what god said what did god say about you tonight so even i love how it is because even in a service you know satan will bombard your mind and try to distract you and try to point all of these things out and you know i've heard this before and but you know let's if we've heard it before if it's the word of god why don't you take sides with jesus tonight and say amen to the word and say you know what if that was a first one to maturity if this is what the word said that i'm a believer so i'm going to take sides with jesus i'm going to keep walking with him i'm going to walk with him in this message until the change of my body i can't do nothing else that's what i was called for that's what i was placed here for and then something coming to the room after we rebuked the devil and just to maybe reiterate that some of us just need to rebuke the devil tonight that's okay why don't you take some time to do it those little thoughts and those little persecutions and those little things he's been trying to do to you and trying to tell you you're never going to be delivered you're never going to be able to make it this is the way you're going to be your whole life you're just never going to get the victory why don't you just go and say oh devil i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ you're trying to tell me i won't have my family you're trying to tell me i won't have my joy you're trying to tell me i won't have my victory you're trying to tell me i'll never be delivered you're trying to tell me i'll never add up you're trying to tell me i'll never be successful you're trying to tell me i'll never be accepted you're trying to tell me i'll never fit in you're trying to tell me i'll never have a place in the body you're trying to tell me that god's never gonna pick me up and you saying i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you you're not welcome here you're not welcome in my thoughts you're not welcome in my mind you're not welcome in the church i rebuke you oh i pray just as that manifested there in the room of that prophet it can manifest here in the tabernacle tonight he said all sudden there's a sweet presence that come over the building also there was a sweet presence that come in the room and it was the holy ghost and he spoke to him a mature son of god he said don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence oh emmanuel hallelujah god with us emmanuel don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go i want to ask you what do you have to worry about tonight the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you if you're walking with him what do you got to worry about what we need is illumination in our heart to know what we're walking with i think a lot of us don't even know what we got you you you're in a fight you're in a fist fight and you're loaded with guns and ammo and all this ammunition and some of us don't even know how to use it i mean we got the revealed word of the hour the unveiled uh the unveiling of god god has come and made himself know what we need to do is pray for revelation lord show me how to use this show me how to fight the warfare show me how to fight the good fight of faith or show me how to stand upon the promised word of this hour that i might know who i am as a son and daughter in jesus christ that i might stand in my position that i might stand with liberty that i might be able to wield the sword of faith and and and chase the enemy back we're not retreating come on all the stuff that's going out in the world don't scare me the bride is christ says bring it on i was born for this you ever hear people say that oh they were born for that uh they're a natural you're a natural overcomer you were born for this this is the purpose god placed you here was to be here in the most wicked age that you would prove to satan that you're not like that eve you are that one that's coming into maturity now that when we've seen a first one there's something in you that wants to say i believe it yes it might be the day of simple things it might be the day of small things it might not be in your understanding of what you're hoping it to be but if you'll continue to labor to pray and get into the presence of god and continue to pray for revelation that this word would be revealed to you oh and if you're walking with him then the word is being interpreted in you god is speaking through you he's manifesting his word in you because you're the provided place that god wants to manifest this word amen oh he said but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel and the name is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god and he plays the name in his son what is the name it's the lord jesus christ so what was it the interpretation of the word the word interpreted is the manifestation of the lord jesus christ that's what we're excited about because we're living in the hour that we have seen the interpretation of the word we've seen prophecy being fulfilled we can recite all the scriptures but we all know them so that's what we've been gathered together by is that the word has been interpreted in our generation and it was none other than the manifestation of the lord jesus christ but he came for the purpose that he would continue his work in and through the bride you are now the place of manifestation we look back into the history books we look back into the bible we can look back into the church ages we can look back into abraham and into noah and to moses and we can see god how he was manifesting himself in the patriarchs we see how god manifested himself in elijah we see how god manifested himself in the prophet john and in our lord jesus christ and then peter james john matthew bartholomew and those disciples we can look back there and see how god was manifesting himself and those but this is now the hour of the bride in the end time that has now accepted the word and the revelation under the seventh angel messenger and just as he fulfilled his part just as he played on his part he was the interpretation of the word but i'm reminded in the bible in ezekiel when the lord asked the prophet he said can these bones live he said thou knowest thou knowest if these bones kill he told what he didn't tell he told the prophet to prophesy and then when the prophet prophesied it was the word that the prophet prophesied that brought those dry bones in the valley to life and that's none other that's what's happened in our day and age that god has vindicated his word by a prophet coming on the scene and god has spoken through the lips of the prophet saying there will be a bride in the end time and what was it the prophet played his part he fulfilled his part but the word of god that was spoken has now been going forward and what is it doing it's catching into the heart of the bride of jesus christ that was predestinated here in the end time to fulfill that spoken word that was promised don't you realize you're living in the hour that the third pool is coming at the manifestation in you not history i'll meet you in there and there that's what's happening right now oh that might not excite you that might be familiar and common to you but that's what i'm thankful for that's what i'm rejoicing about that's what i'm living for that's what excites me in the morning that's what gives me hope that's what well that's what that's what it's all about because without this message what do i got let me ask you what do you got without this message a bunch of creeds a bunch of drugs a bunch of out what do you got because the message what is the let me just say it like this what is the message he says it right here he says that the interpretation of the word the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god the word interpreted is the manifestation of the lord jesus christ the message is the manifestation of the lord jesus christ but it can't stay on the books it can't stay on the tapes it can't stay in the past so where is the message being interpreted where is the message being manifested it's being manifested in a people that have gathered themselves together on an eve sunday evening in bedford texas is where the message is living it's where the message is alive it's where the never failing presence of jesus christ is in our midst i ask you then why don't you just reach out and claim what you have need of oh we've heard it so many times but he is passing by your way tonight oh that's what i'm living for that's what i'm thankful for without this message i got nothing without this message i'm just like isaac laying on an altar waiting to die certain death no hope oh but what did abraham say what did he say there in verse 5 he said god had told abraham hey go up to a place where i showed you and offer thy only son but watch god speaking watch god speaking through abraham and verse 5 it says if you read it with me we all keep pulling like this we might be in trouble i don't even got anywhere yet and i didn't have much to go with god help us but he said oh take thy only son isaac whom now love us and get thee into the land of moriah and after him there offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of so here is that place that god has spoken to abraham i'm going to show you a place where something's going to happen there's going to be a manifestation and what abraham has in his mind is only what god has told him that i'm going to this place and this place that god has chosen is where i'm going to offer my son the only thing he knows to do is to be obedient to the word and so now in obedience to the word he's walking by faith but oh listen to this faith seed speak here in verse 5 he was traveling there with his son and they had some mules and and some other helpers that would with them and then they were in verse 5 he was saying abraham said unto his young men forgive me if there's people interpreting i got to learn how to i'm trying to find it different gears forgive me and abraham said unto his young men in verse 5 abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship but he didn't stop there and come again to you oh what is this what is this profound speech that you're saying abraham god told you to go up there and offer your only son but there's something that's speaking through abraham there's a revelation there's something that that is caught in abraham that he's been through something he's been through some trials he didn't have abra he didn't have his son isaac in the first place isaac was dead to him in the first place he never had the son he could never bring the sun forth so the very sun that god was asking him to sacrifice it was god gave him that son he did not procreate that son in his own ability he had no ability it was impossible for abraham and sarah to have a son so the very son that he had was the very work of god in their life that he fulfilled the promised word that he told abraham you will have a son and so he received isaac from the dead and he knew by revelation that if i already received him from the dead once i can receive him from the dead again so he could speak by faith and say i can go up to that mountain and the same god that gave me a promised son that was dead to me is the same god when i go up on the mountain and i sacrifice my son he's the same god that can raise him up again oh there was a revelation in the father abraham he knew something about faith he knew something about walking with god he knew something that there was a god of all situations there was a god of impossibilities there was a god no matter how hard your child got you are walking with the never failing presence of jesus christ what do you have to fear oh he said right here we will go yonder in worship and come again unto you and the prophet of god would say this he would say and he said now you wait here i like this of abraham he said to his servant said you ain't here with the mules and i will and i and my son will go yonder to worship and we shall return how is he going to do it when he went up there to kill him god told him go up and take his life but what did the bible say in romans 4 abraham knew that he'd received him as one from the dead and was fully persuaded there it is saints he was fully persuaded i wonder if we're fully persuaded this evening of the message are we fully persuaded are you all in are you all in look saints you can't be halfway in and halfway out you can't be hot and cold you can't be living for god one day and not living for god the next god is trying to show you something that you can come to a place where you're fully persuaded that in the face of your friends in the face of the enemy in the face of your adversaries that you are fully persuaded to take god at his word amen that he was fully persuaded that god was able to raise him up from the dead from where he received him as a figure see said you wait here how's it going to do now watch this think about yourself for a little bit how's it going to do i can't tell you can you think of that sister with your baby in your arms and mother sitting in the wheelchair a little boy there over here a daddy i don't know how he's going to do it i just don't know how he is going to do it but he is going to do it because he promised he would on the basis you would believe it he does it to others see this boy and i the lord and i will return see you wait here and we'll go worship there was something in abraham that was speaking out god was speaking out through abraham abraham had uh works is faith expressed look you say you believe the message well let me look at your works and see if you really believe the message i think we've gotten to a place where we've been in this message so long that we we we've it's like that's what's happened to humanity there used to be decency and common decency amongst the women in america but we see the perverseness where it's got to and i want to say this it's the same thing in the message there used to be a holiness dress there used to be a way that the sisters carry themselves there used to be a music that the bride would listen to but we've been around this so long it's like the needles move where we let in any kind of music we let in any kind of dress and all of a sudden what we have today yes it might not look like the world but if you compared what we had today with the message 30 years ago our sisters would be ashamed of themselves i believe that to be the truth not our godly sisters god bless you god's proud of you we love you we're so thankful of of the standard and the holiness but i'm speaking to those that are not fully persuaded i'm not speaking to our godly god bless you sisters god bless you men that are fully persuaded and you believe this message and you're a true example i commend you but i'm speaking to that son and daughter of god that's on the fence and you know better you know you're hot and cold and in and out you know you dress different in the world than you do when you come to church we're not condemning you we've all many of us have been there but god by his love and grace he's just telling you there's more for you you don't have to struggle look servant god is not a struggle oh if i could say that to your young people and somebody that's just struggling to serve god if you can just take god at his word come to a place of full surrender when you completely die out to your own thoughts and your own ability and you come to calvary and you're weak your way at the cross and you're forgiven of your sins you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you receive the baptism of the holy ghost oh there's nothing like it i was i was baptized and filled with the holy ghost back in december 1999 i've never been the same since i have not struggled to serve god have i had struggles i've had my struggles have i had my ups and downs i've had my ups and downs but since that day saints i've been fully persuaded i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ i'm not in and out i'm not up and down but i'm seated in heavenly places with christ jesus i know in whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he is more than able to keep that which i've committed unto him to that day i'm not afraid i'm not scared i'm not worried why that's why abraham wasn't afraid he wasn't worried he's like i didn't have a son in the first place the devil's trying to make you afraid and worried that you're not going to make it you should just say devil you're so stupid forgive me for using the word but he is i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the grace of god in the first place oh how many times saints you got to go back to the word when you get in discouragement maybe you've done something you shouldn't do and you just remind yourself he who be going to work is just and faithful to finish it oh my i've gotten there many times i look back and there that devil is he's rebuking me he's telling me you're nothing but a bluff and i'm looking at my works i'm looking at my life and i'm like man i thought i should be way up the road by now i thought i should be a lot more mature than this how in the world am i battling with these things why am i facing these types of problems why am i going through these things right but then you realize look it's not me i didn't start the work he started the work and if he started the work then he will finish the work and i'm fully persuaded of that just as abraham was fully persuaded that lord you told me i would be a father of many nations so you can take my only son but one thing you cannot do you cannot fail your word he promised it he said it then quit listening to the devil go ahead and take god at his word tonight why don't you just go ahead and rebuke the devil and take god at his word and what god said and be fully persuaded tonight that he's more than able oh hallelujah i might be screaming and spit up here but at least i'm doing it for god i might be a wreck i might be sick my voice might be gone but oh i would have done it for so i would have done it for another kingdom i about killed myself out there in the world drinking and drugging and doing all the things for for the devil oh you just you just stick around a little bit i get excited i'm sorry about it if i was that way in the world for something that was death if i was that way in the world for something that was trying to kill me oh what about when you're living for god who's preserved your life he saved you he's baptized you he's filled you with the holy ghost he's giving you victory oh my we got something to scream about we got something to shout about i got something to stop my feet and snort about come on somebody some of us did some crazy things when we're out there in the world we start to think back on some of those things my goodness you talk about thanksgiving i don't even know if time will have time to get there but i thought that'd be nice to maybe stroll down memory lane a little bit thank god for what he's brought us through oh so they'd get up there dad we got the altar where's the lamb son my son god will provide himself a burnt offering the prophet would go on to say abraham laid him up there can you imagine taking his little curly hair and rolling it back out of his face and his little brown eyes looking up like that and his lips quivering see that big bladed knife come out of his father's think of it think of that father laid his little head back and pulled his throat back so he could stab him through the throat with his knife all in obedience to god no matter what it looked like he said i received them as one from the dead god is able to raise him up he raised back the knife and started and the holy spirit caught his hand and said abraham here am i oh praise god just at the right time just at the right hour i'm so thankful that he's the same yesterday today and forever you might have been believing for something a long time you might have been believing for healing in your body you might have been believing for a family member you might have been believing for something so specific but i want to encourage you that if you're fully and you're taking god at his word god will not fail his word it was just at that time that god spoke a ram into existence oh and how you could go down that type that it was a ram it was a he it was a representation of the lamb jesus christ that he was going to provide jehovah jireh the lord will provide for himself a lamb the prophet of god would go on to say this he would say god had a certain place he met abraham and there abraham worshipped i was thinking about this he told them last to stay there we will come again with you did you imagine the worship after god vindicated and manifested himself in that place of jehovah jireh could you imagine i i am i can you imagine the emotions father were you really going to do it well son the lord told me to say i didn't want to but father he you were right he did provide a ramp yes son yes could you imagine all the hugging and the weeping and how they must have rejoiced and and all the emotions and the fluttering and and him going back in his mind and and thinking of when he met melchizedek and said i'll visit you and i know he was just oh and when he changed his name and all of these things and there everything was coming back kind of like you know when when when tragedy strikes or when something uh so uh there's a scare in your life you just think back and the only things that matter really really stand out you're not worried about all the fluff you're not even worried about your job you're not you're not worried about all the little things that used to bother you just thankful to be alive and all in that moment it could just be oh thank you thank you for your grace thank you for your word lord thank you thank you that your jehovah jireh i can imagine there as they they wept there and they hugged and they went back oh there was a worship there was a thanksgiving i say what a thanksgiving it must have been that god had provided himself a lamb he said god met him in a certain place and they worshipped and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in oh thank you god the word that he promised to fulfill and the day that you're living it the the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in the word that pertains to the bride you're the one that's going to fulfill it you're the one you're the chosen place you're the chosen vessel quit listening what the devil's saying listen to what the messenger is saying listen to what the prophet's saying that's the very word that is speaking into your heart that you might manifest what was spoken the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you will be written epistles of god read of all men not what you claim but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim god said these shine stuff all of them that believe that speaks through you so god was speaking through abraham and manifesting his word and god is doing the same thing he's manifesting in his word and the bride and that is speaking through you you are written epistles read of all men that they might see your good works and glorify god the only god that the only real true god the only lord jesus christ that people are going to see in this world is the bride that is manifesting the word where else are they come on where else are people gonna come in contact with the manifested word of the hour even if they find it on a tape or some technology or they read it it still has to be quickened in them for that word to become material that's how god ordained it to be so the message of the hour is being interpreted in you well god wants to pour his blessings out upon you uh you know i'm kind of tired of living below my privileges i'm kind of tired of of of of shrinking back this ain't a time to shrink back church this is a time to go forward with god man maybe we said we wouldn't be long but we're getting close to leaving that behind huh well praise god are y'all feeling all right praise the lord god is good amen the prophet of god would say this can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same jesus in bride form same power same church same thing same word i don't know if i need to read that 15 times 20 times but at least i'll read it again i want you to open up your ears open up your heart god is speaking to you the bride of jesus christ get your eyes off the flesh get your eyes off the way of man get your eyes off your past and now listen to god speaking to you he's telling you right now the same jesus in the bride form same power same church same thing same word that is who you are just as jesus christ was the word made flesh and dwelling among us now there is a bride that the word has been spoken by malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 1-7 there has been an unveiling of god and a word that has been spoken concerning a bride in the end time and you are the one that is manifesting that spoken word oh i know i say it over and over again but i need to hear it over and over again you can't tell me enough because i'm being bombarded enough by the things of the world i can't even drive down the street i can't even turn on my phone i can't even go into the supermarket that the whole world is puffing up my flesh and pulling on the five senses and trying to hold me down but praise god there was an eagle that spread its wings and flew in this lady'll see it age and called out my name and said come up higher oh you said how do i get there just jump just start flapping your wings so when you hear the quote just jump just start flapping your wings quit wondering how you're going to manifest it and just say i know i'm going to manifest it not because what i can do but because he said it and i'm fully persuaded that the lord jesus christ will bring his word to pass in me oh that's a revelation are you fully persuaded tonight bride oh just exactly the same grain that went into the ground the same jesus in form the same power same church same thing same word you are that same word oh glory to god oh thank you jesus what did the prophet of god say look it speaks through you the bride has thus saith the lord or she stands still they know listen they know do you know tonight they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now so the word made flesh and dwelt among us emmanuel did not complete all his works while in his earthly ministry his earthly ministry well you know where he's at now he's in his her earthly ministry what are you talking about brother he did not fulfill everything while in his earthly ministry but now he says so now he works in and through the bride so now that same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us emmanuel what did he say back there he said that he said that it was emmanuel he said not in the methodist church baptist church but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel god with us don't you realize bride that you are the anointed pride you are the anointed word oh you can't fail you can't miss it but what we need to do is reach out by faith and claim it and be fully persuaded of it that's why we live so far below our privileges praise the lord oh my the same power the same word maybe we'll just end right around here because i'm on the brink of preaching a regular service i thought we'd be really short but but i i just maybe would dwell on this for a moment here we've heard this many times but let's just read romans 8 19. i kind of wonder if i sound like a little like smith wigglesworth i heard he was a grunting and kind of starting and hard to listen to i i mean god bless you for having to put up with this romans 8 19. listen to this now he says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god now as i just thought on those things if you think about the original creation the earth was the chosen place of manifestation for the word seed to bring forth so then god he separates the light from the darkness the sun comes out and and all these seeds come forth to life and there's all of the fish and all the animals and there's a paradise of god on the earth and as long as adam is in his position and has dominion over the earth as a miniature god everything is running along just fine everything is in perfect harmony right but then when adam fell from his position everything went on to chaos death set in the curse set in and now death was set into the human race and into all the world so then now what has happened that man has fell from his position now the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god that they might come back into the position that adam was once in in the beginning right so then if we look at that word manifestation that word also means revelation so the whole creation is groaning for the revelation of the sons of god oh my don't you realize that that's what's taking place at the unveiling of god as christ has unveiled himself to the bride it's actually revealed who the sons and daughters of god are it's actually revealed who the bride of jesus christ it's actually the revelation of the sons of god that death will be swallowed up in victory that the your bodies will be changed that you are going to come back into that position by adoption into that place of manifestation that god's called you to that's what you're coming back to that's what the whole creation is groaning for is for you to come back into that place back into that position look this is the dispensation if you will of adoption this is where sons and daughters of god are coming back into position again what are you talking about brother matthew i'm talking about a son of god back in his position again like it was in eden this is the place i just maybe want to say this one more time the place of manifestation of the word of god in his bride that's where this word is materializing that's where these things are coming and maybe we can just end somewhere around here you know the word says but if you walk in the light as he is in the light i was just looking at that word there the light that actually means to shine or to make manifest so then it was light by the revealing of the word in our day that brings these sons of gods into manifestation without the message there's no manifestation of sons without the message there's no adoption without the message there's no perfection because the message is christ the word and you are part of that word what is it it's the same word it's the same power but it's in bright form oh my we got something to praise god about we got something to be thankful for oh the prophet of god said in uh the same message god's only provided place of worship he said we are flesh and bone of him as long as we are the bride of christ do you believe that all right he died for us and we died to ourselves and were buried in his name that we would no more be of the world but in him by which both the family in heaven is named after jesus christ that's ephesians 1 21 for both heaven the family now listen to this now this this really pulls many things together remember our even our opening text the place that he chose to put his name right we're seeing a type there in the old testament but now the prophet is going to just pull everything right together here he says he says now of which both the family in heaven is named after jesus christ that's ephesians 1 21 for both heaven the family in heaven what's the family in heaven named jesus what's the family on earth named well that's the house of god where the blood's at oh my i got excited about that when i read that today i started to think about how people get all uh confused and worried and start wondering about the mercy seat and if there's no more blood on come on we're bathed in it we're washed in it we're cleansed it you want to know where the blood is follow that bleeding bloody word amen he said well that's the house of god where the blood's at is that right that's the door that's the gate that's the place he put his name follow that again right let's back up there what's the family honor where's the family on earth where's the house of god on earth a body that has prepared me written epistles read of all men where's the kingdom of heaven don't go looking out there where is the kingdom of heaven it's in you it's in you where is god today where is the pillar fire where is those licks of the pillar it's in you it's in you so what is he saying here he says what's the family on earth named well that's the house of god where the blood said is that right that's the door that's the gate that's the place he put his name and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us it's the word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in it's the word sparking in you it's the word being manifested in you and i want to say that god is duty bound to his word oh praise his name i'll just invite the musicians but god is duty bound to his word remember there in the morning service we talked about how when moses he turned aside to see what this great side site was with the the the pillar of fire there on the mountain he said oh moses take off thy shoes for the ground that you're standing on is holy ground well it wasn't so much the it wasn't so much the mountain or the ground that was holy but it was because that pillar of fire because the presence of god was there that's what made it holy and the prophet of god would say it like this he would say there's no holy man there's no holy church it's the holy ghost not a holy church a holy people it's a holy ghost among a people that's what it is see not a holy mountain where peter and them stood the mountain wasn't holy but it's a holy god on the mountain that made it holy not a holy person it's the holy ghost used in that person what makes it all you are a holy people a chosen generation a royal priesthood where the word is being manifested and the presence of god is abiding right here in this group of believers here this evening oh my the place wherein you're standing i'm not so much interested in the church building [Music] i've gone and been able to seem me and brother andrew we went down i believe maybe it was in dallas or another city name but brother branham preached some services here and there's a picture with a pillar of fire settled down on his shoulder you can even go there today and you can walk up to that door and i don't know there's just something about standing there and just to think my 60 years ago the prophet stood here [Music] the pillar of fire was right here many times we want to go to sabino canyon we want to go over here and sometimes we wonder oh if maybe if i can just go back to when i first met the lord maybe you think to a place and maybe sometimes in our minds we start to think well if maybe if i could just go to some place and sometimes i feel like we're cast down and a little sad and there jesus is drawing nigh and saying what are you so sad about [Music] what are you so sad about you're like oh are you a stranger from around here we're looking back in the past at memorials and relics and failing to recognize [Music] that you're the manifestation of the word in this hour [Music] that's a god in history [Music] that's history but where is god tonight [Music] he's in you where is the message of the hour you are the message you are the place of manifestation so i'm not so much interested in the history but i'm interested in that word i'm interested in that holy ghost i'm interested in that pillar of fire as i thought on these things you know so many people you know they they're they're they're they're maybe looking for prophecy to be fulfilled in the future and as i thought about this you know some people are are concerned with with maybe this move over here and that move over there and and maybe they're looking for some big revival and some people you know they're looking for the prophet to return some people are looking for a tent vision some people are looking for some further manifestation of the word to bring them into their position but you know as i thought about that you know when the prophet was there he had that tent vision and he was standing there in that cathedral-like tent and he said there was a platform and there's a little wooden building over there and he said that pillar of fire the angel lord that was standing with him it moved from over there over the top of that little building and it went in there and he said i'll meet you in there this is the third pool he said i'll meet you in there that is the third pool well that was the pillar of fire that went into that little place and said i'll meet you in there that is the third pool well many people are looking for a future manifestation but i want to tell you the pillar of fire is here tonight in this room oh you say brother matthew what are you talking about i don't believe it you don't have the authority to say that you know i sat in the pew as a skeptic myself i heard brothers stand in the pulpit and they would say the angel the lord is here and i thought in my righteous indonation who gives you the authority to say that who where what are you trying to make yourself who are you trying to make yourself out to be but by god's grace something in me gave a man a benefit that a doubt and i'll say you know what maybe there's something in there what would give them the authority you know what gives a man to say give gives the man that authority the word of god he said the angel of the lord and camps around about them that fear his name as there are people that have gathered themselves together on a sunday evening that fear the name of the lord then the angel of the lord the pillar of fire is here i will meet you in there you are living in the hour of the manifestation of the third pool let's all stand [Music] oh my i'll meet you in there i'll meet you in there where is the place of manifestation or where is this third pool lord i want to meet you in there [Music] lord there were people in lines going into that little secret place you said i'll meet you in there [Music] they went in on crutches they went in crippled they went in lame and they came out on the other side delivered they come out on the other side all saints of god there is a place of manifestation that comes by the spoken word of god this message is the spoken word of god this message the revealing of those seals is that third pull i want to ask you are you heartbroken you don't have to wait for some tent vision you can meet him in there tonight you don't have to wait any longer you can be heartbroken you can be depressed you could be seeking the baptism of the holy ghost but if you go in there i'll meet you in there see i'm not so much interested in the little building i'm not so much interested in the mountain [Music] it was that pillar of fire that moses was in the presence of that's what changed him that's what commissioned him and it was that god that spoke to him and said he said to him in exodus 3 12 he said certainly i will be with thee [Music] well god had commissioned moses to take his children in an exodus god has commissioned you to fulfill this word but he's telling moses he said certainly i'll be with you and this shall be a token unto you that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt you shall serve god upon this mountain [Music] moses knew right there no matter what from this day forward he could go down to egypt the most mighty nation in the world on a donkey with a stick but he knew thus saith the lord i'm going back to that mountain and nothing can stop that from coming to pass and moses when he went down there and fulfilled the commission of god there was a day he came back to that mountain [Music] and he could turn around to those people and say this day this scripture is fulfilled maybe i could say it like this [Music] we've heard a message said there will be an invincible army said there would be a bride without spot or wrinkle [Music] said that she would rise up in the last day that should be predestinated not to fall i can look out upon the congregation there's scripture that says in a moment and a twinkle of an eye you'll be saying there's people sitting here with that promised word in their heart there is a people a perfect that have caught the revelation of this message and you know what i can stand here and say this day this scripture is fulfilled heavenly father how we love you lord you're so gracious to us [Music] to think oh god that you have [Music] you've shared your your whole mind you've shared your whole plan [Music] lord i thought tonight we would take a moment of thanksgiving on a thanksgiving holiday weekend to just thank you lord for calling us thank you for electing us thank you for choosing us lord i thought how maybe we would think back to maybe when we were teenagers and [Music] maybe before we knew you and just start to go down memory lane and to think of what would have come of us if you didn't call our name [Music] the lord we're here tonight oh god if you didn't intervene i would either be dead or in prison [Music] i just want to tell you thank you lord thank you for your grace [Music] lord you spoke a word concerning me before i even ever came on the scene and to think no devil in hell can stop that [Music] god may there be a faith rise up in us tonight that we'll be fully persuaded to go from these doors knowing who we are more than ever knowing that we are the manifestation of the sons of god that we've received a revelation that is bringing us back into our position back into adoption back to that place in eden lord i pray a blessing upon your people now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen let's just sing this yet for me [Music] in fear [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] to be afraid [Music] wow [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] bye [Music] i give myself away [Music] me [Music] is [Music] myself [Music] me [Music] [Music] yes [Music] myself away [Music] i give myself away [Music] take my heart [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] give myself away [Music] [Music] if you could come dismiss us maybe i can leave you with this i thought i might have gotten to a thought of what a thanksgiving you know brother branham preached invisible union of the bride of jesus christ on 11 25. [Music] you know that was that's the anniversary of my mom and dad and brother branham said it's if he could have chose any age to live and as he starts to talk about this message i would have lived in this age because it it's a golden age and i thought i hear my pastor my mom and dad they're celebrating their golden anniversary and they were married on that same day invisible union and i just thought as i come to service maybe we'd have a time to reflect and be thankful for what god's done because the prophet would say there in that message you would say god slipped the wedding band of predestination onto your finger and i started to think about that he said oh what merited grace oh what unmerited favor he said oh what a thanksgiving and i started in my mind to think about that predestinated wedding band and started to think about all them years that i was out there in sin i was wearing that wedding bag he was never gonna lose you you were always his i was talking to brother jackson oh we were teenagers we were out in the world we should have been dead or in prison but you know what kept you brother jackson you're wearing a wedding band of predestination do you want to know why you're here tonight because he slipped that wedding band of predestination on your finger he said she's mine he's mine devil you can't have her you can't have him take your hands off of them but he was waiting for that day that you would turn your heart and say lord i need you i need your lord and ever since then [Music] oh what a thanksgiving to thank god for what he's done for us brother darien [Music] what a privilege it is for us just thank you for all that you are the reality of who you are not just in letter form not just in pages in the message or the voice of brother branham but lord god in a reality to our souls today not another age as we just heard the age the best age for the bride to manifest you lord jesus not of our own ability but by your divine grace what and elected lady we are father god as your bride we are so thankful we're so grateful oh lord god we we know father even as just thinking of me when i was engaged in my wife my bride anything she asked i would want to run and just give it to her and that is how you telling us this evening again lord anything you ask in my name it shall be given father you are so so true so real oh god we just love you we adore you we worship we glorify you oh lord god we bless your name with all that we have for all that we are is because of you all that we have is because of you all that you've given us our lord god is because of your amazing grace your love of father god that you've called us and placed us before the foundation of the world it just blows our mind to just think back how you've brought us through this life of god every single day to be here tonight sitting in these pews no one else but us you wanted us to hear what you had your servant bring to us oh lord god bless our precious brother matthew lord god reveal yourself more and more to him not just to him but to your many man remembered bride body of father god we see the hour we see the time we're living in and one thing's for sure you can never fail so we stand lord god ready waiting to hear what you would have us do as we go forth from here lord god knowing what you spoke to us this evening just to remind us who we are where we come from and where we are heading our lord god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever once again as you provided the ram in the thicket for abram you've provided a sacrifice in this day in this hour to manifest your people according to your promised word we so love you bless us no further take us safely to our different destinations and bring us safely back home to fellowship and feed on thee in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you are dismissed for those that want to stay in worship we'll just have brother steve come and lead us in some songs but you are dismissed let's just sing this for those that want to stay in worship give thanks with a great full heart [Music] is [Music] [Music] because of what the lord for us [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i want to go where the rivers can are overflowing my feet [Music] in your praises [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] in your presence oh god that's where i am [Music] that's where i belong seeking your face touching your [Music] grave in your presence [Music] i [Music] in your praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] in your praise [Music] in your presence [Music] you
