tonight praise the Lord you love the Lord isn't he wonderful amen amen amen wasn't that a wonderful message last night praise God we serve a present tense God that can do all things amen nothing that our God can't do and he's here with us tonight you believe that and he's here with us to touch you and to do for you what you have need of uh you know this is uh Our Guest we we called it our dedication service a a chance for us to show our Thanksgiving to the Lord for the new facility that we had we we didn't necessarily want to build a church but we were forced to you made us build it it's your fault but you know we were putting in the little Fellowship Hall we were putting about 345 people in there on Sunday and the only person in town we wouldn't invite to church was the Fire Marshall so uh but everybody's been gracious and you know it it was referred to last night and we also often refer to churches as a lighthouse a a beacon set on a hill um the the def uh the purpose of a lighthouse I I thought it was so wonderful and I just like to think because we're not really dedicating the building it's like a lot of other Church buildings and in the lighthouse is a building it's a structure that sits high but within that Lighthouse is a light and it's the flashing forth of that light that gives the lighthouse its purpose so if it didn't have the light if there wasn't a signal going from the lighthouse it would just be an oblique it would just be a tall building it would just be a structure but what makes it a lighthouse is that something is shining forth and the purpose of the lighthouse it's it is it's to Aid or to serve in navigation in other words to navigate you many times will call your Navigator because you want to know where you're going and how to get there and that's what a lighthouse is it's a navigator and it it it it it gives directions it's a warning of Hazard so this is the purpose so you sit here tonight the Lighthouse of God and you have a purpose and you you you're you're uh you're to to show the way and you're to uh warn of Hazards and you're your the lighthouse is there to uh establish position it lets you know where that you're at it establishes position and guides them to their destination amen just think that's what we're here for and the theme of our Service uh this meeting is to be about our father's business so you know so the lighthouse has a purpose and this is the business that we're to be about we have a commission to be the light and there's many scriptures that in the in the Bible that refer uh to light and uh and the the light of the believer the light of the world and in Matthew for example it says you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden you are the light of the world you are the one that shows the direction you are the one that leads the destination you are the one that keeps from ha Hazard you are the one that shows people their position who is that that's you and these are responsibilities that we can no longer Sher these are responsibilities that we must take up that we we're commissioned to be about our father's business this isn't about just living a life so you can get a reward this is about a bride that is going to take on the mind of Christ and look upon the needs of others above the the needs of themselves it it says in the Psalms it says your word is a lamp to my feet and the light of my path it it says for the Commandment is is a lamp and the law a light reproof of instructions are the way of life amen that's what the word of God does for us Jesus spoke to them again saying I am the light of the world he who followeth me shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life amen that's what we desire is the light of life and as we read last night in Mark the disciples uh went to seek him he had done many miracles in their midst and they caught their attention and so Jesus got up early and he went out to pray and to be alone and it says when and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee you know when people are hungry for what you have amen all men seek for thee and he said unto them let us go unto the next towns that I may preach there also for therefore cameth I forth and that's what our commission is to go into all the world and so we want to be about our father's business and I thought last night was so wonderful because you can't be about the father's business without the father and you've got to know what his business is and we heard last night that you have a God that that knows all things he's omnipresent he's omnis there there's nothing that he can't do he he offered to supply you every need that you have need of every uh there wasn't a challenge that he couldn't make and and our brother spoke this he said the angel of the Lord has come to drive us in to the presence of God to the present tense God and and that's our heart's desire through these meetings we we didn't want to come to these meetings and say all right everybody come with your need list you know I need this I need that I need this but we wanted just to lay all of our wants and all of our desires at his feet and just take a moment to listen just listen to the word of God the word of God will bring you into a divine presence where you will absolutely know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he keeps his word and that every promise in this book is yours and so as the word as the word of God has preached to you tonight let it pull you let it lead you let it guide you let it make known to you the unlimited possibilities of a present tense God that can do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think and if you could walk from this building tonight with a treasure the pearl of great price the Lost coin of your life and know that the word of God has given to you a possession that will never fail that'll keep keep you forever it's a honor for me tonight to have the our ministers from uh uh the local church here sitting with us up here that that help uh and preach the gospel and and go out and Minister the good things of God we have other ministers with us tonight brother Ron Brother Charles others I know that are with us the brother from Brenham and and different ministers that are here even some of ours couldn't be with us here but we're in this together church amen it's really time that we come into that invisible Union and we get about what God's called us to be and and to remember the prophet of God said the church has lost the understanding and the remembrance of the real testimony of Christianity so let us revive Our Testimony I enjoyed that word last night I was just having myself a jubilee cuz I knew that God was for me amen I knew he was with me and I knew he wouldn't let me go and no matter how hard I tried to get away like a little running squirming baby he just wraps his arms around me and holds me close to him and and keeps me safe amen I want those arms around me again tonight don't you amen don't don't you don't you want him just to grab you tonight and tell you he loves you and it's all okay I know all about it oh Lord I done all this he said I I died for you well you were yet a sinner I died for you I your sin was with me on Calvary and I nailed it there that you can go free tonight so I'm excited for God's word tonight I'm excited for what he will do I don't have a plan I'm not working towards a prayer line I'm not working towards a Revival I'm not trying to get something going this way or that way I want to sit back get isab and watch him do what he chooses to do and bring me into his glorious presence let us Stand Together Billy give me a song to sing [Music] the so my soul long oh you are my heart desire and I to wor all you you are alone Are My Strength my you are alone that's [Music] my [Music] oh of my heart desire and and I to worship the amen my privilege tonight to have brother Michael Ray preach for me and if I'm not mistaken this is the first Pulpit you preached in y out of town right out of town this is the first Pulpit he preached in out of town from his local church amen so we've been trying to steal him ever since but anyway you're going to enjoy the word of God tonight and I know the love that in this man's heart for God's people and that love is our Victory so sit back and rest tonight and let the spirit of God bless you brother Michael without fear or without favor this Pulpit is yours in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you and I long to worship you oh you alone and you alone Are My Strength sh and you alone does my spirit my heart desire and [Music] to Heavenly Father tonight that is indeed our heart's desire Lord just sitting in the back study and listening Lord to the worship coming from lord your children your son your daughter's hearts Lord pure Lord in its expression Lord I pray Lord that I know it reached Lord your throne room and Lord as a sweet smelling Savor Lord did you draw in I'm sure just a a deep breath Lord as you Lord just were so pleased Lord with the worship from our hearts Lord we've come to hear from you Lord not from man not from Lord some man's thinking but Lord we want to hear directly from the heart of God tonight so Lord I pray you anoint Lord this little room this Sanctuary Lord this congregation and Lord your spirit would brood Upon Us Lord and Lord you'd meet the needs of our hearts Lord your word of God as your scripture States is sharper than a two-edged sword piercing and dividing Lord between Soul and Spirit Lord you know our heart you know our needs you know our deepest areas and regions of our soul so Lord I pray your word would speak to us now now Lord and deliver the Lost Lord break the chains Lord that bind Lord those here tonight Lord may we leave Lord this moment this time in your presence Lord our hearts burning because we've been in the presence of almighty God so we commit this speaker and hear to you in our Your Name Lord our precious Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you how are you tonight amen you sang and you've worshiped and you've praised and you've had specials but now we're going to hear the word of God Amen so I pray you put everything in it tonight maybe turn around shake each other's hand get the Bloods flowing out of your arms and your limbs maybe stomp your feet a little bit say it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen I told my dad I said I feel like I'm a horse coming out of the gate my goodness so if I come out a little bit too fast I just need to hear someone yell whoa Nelly All right so we're just we're just happy to be here tonight my it's just always a honor to come and be with the congregation here as Brother David said indeed is you have a real close spot in my heart being the first out of town my goodness I'm sure it was a bucket of nerves at first service out of you know honest to goodness you were just so gracious to listen and and pull but uh we've come a little ways and the Lord's been with us each step of the way and we're just so honored to be able to be here you're the building the sanctuary the church butter David is just beautiful and I know behind all the walls and the jip rock and all of that is thousands of feet of wire and all the different connections and cabling and infrastructure and I know there's love buried in these walls I mean you're walking on Love Actually you know it takes incredible amount of effort from a body to be able to do this and so we just pray that the Lord just descends and continues to use as Brother David said may this place this Sanctuary this body of Christ be a lighthouse until the Rapture takes place I mean but I but David I just had wrote and I'm trying I'm going to I'm racing here more I'm very conscious of the time but but David I did want to say you you have one of the biggest hearts that I know and I was thinking about just even your name as the Lord even considered David a man after his own heart and brother brandham he says he said somebody he was talking about his services and how he they were saying maybe you need to recall your tapes he says because I'd preached being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he says I ain't recalling them' he says I'm making more this is brother brandham he says that's right making more that's is the Bible if they don't like what we did yesterday just watch what we're going to do tomorrow he said that's a thing to do see just keep on going there's no end of it because it is of the lord it's God he says you know what God did God looked down out of Heaven he said David you're a man after my own heart David wasn't ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he loved God and he was happy so Overjoyed till he didn't think about human Prestige I thought but David that's just like you amen we're going to just serve God we're going to serve him we're going to give our heart to him we're going to do everything we can for this gospel that's just like you butter David you're a man after God's Own Heart and so we're honored to be able to be just be here with you and support the work here in what little way we can and all the effort that was in for these meetings I just have to say does who who baked the snicker doodles is there a hand around or oh my goodness those are amazing amazing to put the lunch and the sandwiches and all that after there's so much that goes into these these weekend and meetings God bless you for every bit of Labor and even the snicker doodles sister those are amazing amen somebody appreciates a good Snicker doodle it's me amen why don't you turn to your Bibles this this evening without any further delay we're going to turn to numbers 13 I have quite a bit of scripture there to read so I'm not going to have you stand this whole time but I'll just read a little bit uh maybe the scripture I'd like to speak from and then I'll go back and go to the beginning so numbers 13 familiar scripture maybe for many as it's a scripture where the spies are going to be going into Canaan land and and Moses is speaking to the people so maybe just in a bit of a summary as we lead up to there Moses is is going to pick a man out of each tribe and he goes through each each name and actually I was going to read them but for the sake of time I will not but I was just cognizant as every person from each tribe was mentioned and named and as it went through each one I thought my how each one would have been so Keen or would have been so thrilled and honored to be called as they were passionate I'm sure to to get into the promised land they had their own desires and burdens and and such to possess what God had given them and and and scripture names him specifically but only two out only two out of that whole list actually had it in them I'll be cognizant of that as we go through the service but at verse 17 Moses said Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them get you up this way Southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities that they dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be you of courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the T now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes I can say that Moses must have been very keenly interested in what the land held he wanted to know if there was wood if there was no wood if it was a fat land or a lean land he wanted to know what tents were there what strongholds were there he wanted to know what resources were in the land all right so they went up searched the land from the Wilderness of Zin unto reob and as the men as the men come to hamath and they ascended by the south came up to Hebron and he went I'll just go through the scripture there in 23 he says and they came to the brook of eshkol and cut down from th a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs and the place was the brook of eshco because of the cluster grapes which the children of Israel cut down and they returned from searching the land after 40 days and they went and came unto Moses unto Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel under the Wilderness of pan to cadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land so they'd come back Moses had wanted to know what the resources lay in the land how good it was or how bad it was and now they've come back with proof and a little bit of evidence of grapes and pomegranates and figs and now they're going to show them and they told him and said we came under the land this is all 12 of them obviously that are gathered here with thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it so they agreed with wholeheartedness surely it floweth with milk and honey it was abundant it was full of resource it was it was full of goodness it was a fat land it it had so much goodness in it and here is the fruit or I should say a a taste or a foretaste of it nevertheless immediately after they now just mentioned what the land contained and I'm sure there was more that could have been said as they were glowing with with with what was there but somehow the immediate verse or immediately following that they said nevertheless here they put an immediate limit nevertheless the people be strong that dwell on the land and the cities are walled and very great and more over we saw the children of anak there Giants and the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites the the amorites dwell on the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome amen you may have your seats tonight may the Lord bless the reading of his word tonight you know humanity is transfixed maybe even driven with with all of its desires and such is focused quite heavily on resource or I should say resources you know Wars are are fought and uh and such you know Spain went to America and and found gold they were looking for resource you know England and France Rome all the con many of the conquests that that have happened over time most often there's some sort of commodity to plunder some some sort of uh desire they have maybe they're Limited at home and so they're going to to obtain something that they don't have Greece one of their big battles that Greece fought was because they were limited in their own natural resource and so resources of a land are are vital to any country many of the African nations they were colonized just because of their resources and man went in to try and Conquer and take of the minerals and and and take from the land and so it's mankind who has searched through all time it's got Wars its conquests that have been waged for resource thousands and hundreds of millions of dollars have been mobilized to take take over lands to take over countries because they have something that they don't so without the proper amounts certain resources your economy suffers growth suffers you become vulnerable you can't build as such that you need other kingdoms can come in they can develop more they take over and anybody on a side note maybe some of the younger well not so younger maybe there's an old strategy uh computer game of the old times called Age of Empires anybody ever know that oh my am I that old oh you had to go get gold and stone and food and wheat and all this kind of thing you had to build your Empire up you needed resource if you didn't do it you wouldn't build it was impossible and so the American Revolution even the fight for Freedom the independent the war of independence looked like for you it was the fight for freedom but actually from Europe they viewed the war as a very different story Europeans saw the conflict as a battle over control of lucrative trade routes and commodities of the East and West Indian they didn't even see your Independence they didn't really actually care all it was was about Commodities and resource a different Viewpoint of that England wanted to retain its control of the colonies to reap the benefits of the natural resources here of America and so man is concerned with resources because they're limited this Earth is limited in its resource and resource limits man gets so concerned in it so therefore it's desirable for Renewables who's familiar with that everybody should be everybody wants a renewable resource because it's never ending and therefore it doesn't deplete and it can keep going and because it sees man sees a possible limit and so it's trying to figure out how how can I find something that is is Unlimited in his resource Amen Brother David pretty much quote almost could have quoted my title a God he quoted I think God of unlimited possibilities I was going to title it tonight maybe tapped into unseen resources but pick your pick your title whichever one you want but tonight we're going to speak about a god of the limited amen am me our brother Tom was tap dancing all over a little bit last night that's okay so we'll just swing a different little Direction so we'll just go part two of Last Night how's that and he'll take part three tomorrow so man's ever hunting ever hunting for more potential and looking for untapped areas that he can find something to ensure he does not run out in fact they're so Keen that they that on on on a resource they make create movies they create books they there there's super abilities that man craves for that that can manifest a an unending or a supernatural power that will never ever end you know they want some superhero you know limited is restricted in size of amount or extent it's few small or short I'm an adjective I should say a synonym kind of guy so relative or similar words I'm going to read them fast catch a few of them limited means restricted or finite B bounded little narrow in short supply meager it's scanty it's sparse it's insubstantial deficient inadequate insufficient poultry poor misery basic rudimentary patchy sketchy minimal cramped and small just in case you needed a couple it's limited I can tell you the world is limited in its abilities its resources and it's its ability to fulfill what mankind requires and we're creatures of limitations we have limited time that's we're we're constrained by limitations I can tell you we know that because you have limited time and you have limited money so we're very well of the limitations on our planet and everything it constrains us because if you know I'm sure a few of us would love un unlimited time and unlimited money yeah indeed I got one over here but our human mentality we we tend then to measure everything because that's just the way're we're we're we live live in a world of limitations and we have scales and units of measurement and and and so we got you know from micro to macro and small medium and large and we have all these different scales of graduating sizes and such because that's just how we work man's mind is is based on limitations and and limits and so we we put these things because you know we care about measurement you bet you care because if someone said you know what I'll give you hundreds or billions of dollars which one would you want well you care about measurement right there like well can I go with billions yeah because it's a unit of me unit of measurement that you care about amen and so God though is not a man God ain't no restricted to any measurements man un like us we tend to look at God though because of our our world because of measurements because we weigh in you know pounds and tons and all these kind of thing we then tend to look at God Through The Eyes of our limited Humanity all right and so we then do tend to put a measurement on him or restrict him by our own me our own barriers of our mind but God is a god of No Limits and I know that's hard for us to comprehend because we we we live in the realm of limits but unlimited is what our God is he means he's not restricted in terms of numbers or quantity or extent it's having the greatest possible amount or number and in fact unlimited is inexhaustible it's Limitless it's boundless it's unbounded it's immense it's vast it's great it's extensive it's immeasurable incalculable Untold unfailing Everlasting infinite endless never ending I'm talking about your God whose bottomless measureless inestimable Cosmic unrestricted unconstrained uncontrolled unrestrained unchecked unhindered unhampered unimpeded unfettered unbridled uncurved unconditional absolute full utter Sovereign Supreme and omnipotent that's your [Applause] God I can tell you when whoever put that in Webster they were writing it just for this service so that I could Proclaim to the devil my God is a god of the unlimited my God is a goddess of supreme the unrestricted the unconstrained and no man controls your God there is actually no unit of measurement even in the concepts of man that belong to God you know that's actually hard for you and I to maybe understand because we have big needs and small needs it doesn't exist to God God's like it's a need you have a prayer you have a concern you have a have a circumstance there there's no way to God doesn't look at little he doesn't look at big he doesn't look at your a to a toothache and a Cancer and be like well that's huge to me I don't know if I can handle that I mean the toothaches no problem but the cancer I don't know how I can do it no God is unlimited meaning he doesn't have a unit of measurement for your need it means he looks at your need whether it's a toothache or a cancer he says well all things are possible because Jesus said looking upon them saying with men it is impossible but with God for With God all things it didn't say 99% of things it didn't say just a limited amount of things it's a limited addition of what I can do I can only do so much no he can do all [Applause] things brother bam said now when the Brethren receive the sign receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren he said that's wrong there is no Summit to God's power don't put God in your mental box don't put some scale of measurement on my God my God's unlimited if you want to live with a limited God you go right ahead but not my God he said we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet it's never been tapped yet through the thousands of years of believer after believer as they've moved on and on in their experience and they've gone into Heavenly places his love his Joy his peace his outpouring has never been tapped yet he said God has never tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about he said well Lord I need a little bit more do you have a little bit more for me he said I'm sorry what is that I'm unlimited what do you desire tonight what is your need tonight he's the god that can feel your need yeah you can sink into the stars for all I care my God will fulfill it he says it's never been ever even revealed to our Arch Angels is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for Eye Has Not Seen Nor Ear Has Not Heard neither has it entered into the hearts of man what God has for them in store he's an unlimited God Amen so here is Israel sitting at Kadesh at a critical Junction point and God had finally led him to a place where they were getting to the peak really of what lay ahead here was 12 men sent which had good intentions desires to go into the land glory to God we're going in the promised land can you think of that moment do you want to be a spy would you like to go on the promised landine would you like to go as Moses started to choose each one like my glory to God I get to be the first one to taste of the fruits think of that moment there you there was important even named them off of the tribe of Simeon it was shaad of the tribe of Judah it was Caleb trouble lay ahead the unknown lay ahead burdens lay ahead uncertainties lay ahead change was ahead much lay ahead all of that was part of obtaining their promise part of accessing the resources there was resources of abundance but there was a little bit of work to do they had to start to get in they had to get in the promised land they had to cross over they had to spy it out they was they were just they were scratching at the surface of what worked needed to be done to even get there but it was there and they told him and said we came into the land that th sent us and surely surely it floweth with milk and honey I mean I can imagine the conversations as they were going in their little groups and going into different areas of the land and some were looking at the Giants but I can imagine the conversation that Joshua and Caleb had at all times was only and always about what the land had look at this this is more than what even Moses said he said it was flowing with milk and honey but it's abundant this is Limitless I mean look at this land it's fertile look at the trees look at the wood look at this oh sorry that's a a cat wow that doesn't matter that cat Fortress will go down oh my there's Giants whatever we can do those but look at the milk and honey oh but someone else is saying well look at the figs oh my goodness it's sons of anic that are here I know but did look at the fig trees and no no did you see that City no I'm try trying to look at the resources that God has for us I can't get my eyes off of what Satan thror in front of me 10 out of those 12 came back with the testimony of nevertheless I'd never want my testimony to be nevertheless in this context the people are strong Giants are in the land and there then Caleb Still the people and they rebutted back and confessed openly and unabashedly that there's just no way for us to do this there's no way for us to obtain the resources that God has for us numbers 13:31 and it says but the man went up with him and said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we i i i i h I actually just struggle with comprehending after all that they had gone through after all the circumstances that they had went through mana and quail they' gone through Egypt and all the plagues that had come across and God had brought them out with a strong hand they went through the sea Red Sea that parted and here they had the audacity to throw it in God's face and say we are not able wait a second what we has anything to do with it anyway did you open the Red Sea did you bring Mana down from heaven did you bring Quail did you bring the the plague of death and boils and and Li and frog did you do that well no I didn't so what part of we are you having to do with anything about the promised land they got they got questioned up and they got muddled up in their brain and somehow felt that they had something to do with it you got nothing to do with it all you got to do is walk in it and believe that your God is more than able that's why Caleb could have nothing to do with Caleb he said we're able to because my God it missed the point completely wasn't to do with them any at all and they'd been looking at the flesh and disregarded the resource within their own Camp the pillar of fire had been with them all this time can you imagine a pillar of Fire by day and a pillar of cloud by night and then they come back and be like no it's impossible and the pillar of fire is in their midst and then they decide to choose a captain I I I know I know you you just glaze over the scripture but can you imag imagine Moses who's LED them who left as he looked out of the window and and disregarded all of Egypt's pleasures and money and fame and glory and looked at the Mudders and said I'd rather be there and bear the reproach and stepped out of it took the reproach walked down with the children of Israel right out of Egypt and they're like you know what we're just going to get a new captain that's what they say let's make us a captain and let us return unto Egypt it's better to be back in bondage and oppression of a man-made system critical error because they put a limit on God and His abilities I wonder unfortunately that's not just happening back in the children of Israel's day that's not just way back in numbers but I don't know about you but where I come from that's still happening they've sojourned they've gone a long way they've seen God move God's done incredible miracles in their midst and they've walked in it and they come to the point Suddenly It's like wow I just can't do this anymore and turn my face and they turn their backs on this God that's moved and delivered and and and helped them through certain difficulties and such as say nah we don't want him anymore and they go back to their wallow still happens today but I'm glad the story don't just end there cuz I don't identify with the 10 I identify with the two all right because identify with the two that were able to see that their God was more than able and their eyes were on the unlimited possibilities of what lay across the river am man that's where identify they wanted they' seen their God move and they wanted what the land had that's my type and my hero is Caleb they wanted what that land had and they said I don't know what it's going to take but my God's able and I'm just going to put my eyes on it and walk day by day I don't know how I'm going to get through tomorrow I don't know how I'm going to get through this situation I don't know how I'm going to get through cancer I don't know how but my God has got my healing just over in that [Applause] land because in Romans it says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he justified is anybody identifying with this scripture anybody here cuz I'm pretty sure this is the scripture that Caleb would identified with amen who he justified he called D he justified he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us amen that's a Caleb [Applause] people in this day in this AG I can't really want to don't really want to jump my jump my notes but there's a land Without Limits and I'm saying Dallas it's time to conquer Israel sat there they sat they looked across at the joy that was set before him and limited God's ability I can't even imagine of thinking and looking at that actually even tasting not just grapes but they had figs and pomegranates and they could they even tasted but there's a barrier there you know it's terrible when you see somebody they've tasted and you're like you know you know what's terrible when someone's achieving lower than their abilities anybody ever had experienced that and somebody's they've got so much so much uh potential and you see it in them but they're not they're not pressing towards it or they're not trying to develop it and you're just like come on it's just it's just there if just put a little effort in it put a little diligence in you you can do more and it don't want just burns you you're like I wish I had those abilities myself cuz I would No No's ever thought that before know there was in Second Kings there were there was a city under siege and there were some lepers that sat out on the out of the uh City City they had nowhere to go and inside the city there had been sieged and people there was no food as famine they were even eating their own children terrible situation as they had been encompassed I Believe by the syrians I think it was resources were gone limited isn't even in the in this in the picture in the scope it's bare gone nothing non-existent and here they were sitting in there these little Le these lepers and they're sitting there and the scripture says why sit here we die so they're having a conversation and little did they know and I'm just trying to work through with some time here little did they know that inside a prophet had prophesied of something that was going to transpire he said that barley and such would go at a certain price and there was a doubter in their midst and he said that's not impossible that'll never happen because he's looking at the circumstance not at the word that was being issued by a prophet he said oh and so he doubted but little did they know that had transpired and they're sitting there outside the gate and they're saying what should we do if we go inside we're going to die and and there's nothing there but if we go to the syrians camp we're going to die but maybe per Adventure they are going to just maybe have compassion on us maybe they'll give us a morsel and maybe throw us something because we're lepers and they don't want to touch us so hey why don't we go down there what if we just sit here and do nothing we die all right and behind them was a prophecy a word spoken and so here they go well all right let's get up from our chair let's go and do something we never done before let's go and just take a step of faith and go in a direction that I've never thought of I'm just going to because if I sit here I die all right so here we go all they go they back up their who knows what their little bed roll or something like that walking towards a Syrian Camp unaware of what it transpired but here God had moved on the scene the god of the unlimited and he had moved and put it and and made it so that they thought there was an Army coming someone had hired an army and off the syrians went and unbeknownst to them they were walking into abundance how do you know that you don't need to get up from your chair today you need to step out in faith because God's got some abundance for you he's not just a god of Second Kings he's a god of today because of his Second Kings in Hebrews 138 that means it's in your hand to step out and say well Lord maybe I'm like a leper maybe I've been sitting in sin all day long and I'm just sick and tired get up get up let you die but God my God has some resources for [Applause] you oh what if the to kill us well you're dead here what if the armies don't get up and leave well you're dead here well I've been here for years and nothing's happened well you're going to be dead here yeah come on I just don't know if I can surrender well you're going to be dead there my friends will leave me they'll mock me what excuse was worth it what excuse would have been worth them staying here and unbeknownst to them riches Untold no excuse was worthwhile I tell you no excuse is worthwhile when the god of the present that is unlimited is in our midst today no excuse for you to sit in your place where you're stagnating in your spiritual walk or you have a need no excuse is worth sitting there Reach Out And Touch the [Applause] Lord w why should I sit here in the muck of sin lost and wretched as a leper why sit here in the med mediocre life of a message child with no experience of your own hanging on your coattails of your mommy and daddy why sit here Bound by some doctrine of man some Twisted idea of the message that they got holding you back why sit here bounded by some malice or hurt that's in your heart past some past circumstance why sit here when the god that has what you need is here and they were sold out they were willing to die they actually got up with the expectation that I might die and that's exactly what it takes to get up with the full expectation I'm dead to myself and when they came to that place then they stepped into another realm they stepped and started tapping into the Unseen real of the resources of God [Music] I can tell you when they got there oh my goodness going from Death To Life come on they thought they were going to die and they start to look in here wait a second you mean there's no syrians around here you mean there's gold and there's garments and there's food and they start stuffing their face because it's Joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's peace that passes all understanding they start drinking it in and taking and say oh my goodness they take some and they went and hit it they hid it behind here they came back they're like this is amazing and then they said wait a second we can't do this we need a share we can't just sit here and enjoy I need to share it I need to get out there I need to tell this world that God sent a prophet and he's restored me to my [Applause] position [Music] amen think of that moment they're like you mean this is all for me this is all me every bit of this is for me every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I am trusting in my love my God Divine it's mine yes it is I don't have to share with nobody you do but it's still all yours I'll just go to your prophet and say that's a paradox but Brown says choose you this day you who you'll serve said the words been preached signs has been done the Holy Ghost is here the hour has come for a decision made amongst the people he said what more can God do send it down with signs and wonders discernments proved it scientifically put it on a picture sent it across the world thousands times thousands witnessing he said they arose in the middle of the night started down towards walking by faith towards the host of the syrians and God honored their faith he said it didn't only save their own life he says but it saved the whole city he says there's a lot of sick people with heart trouble to berler lot was bound in chairs he says why don't you tonight why do you sit there till you die the hour has come for you to make a decision now he said God can't do no more about it it's up to you you got to make the decision I pray you'd sit in your Pew tonight I don't know who it applies to and you start just rolling that one in your heart why sit here till we die why sit here till I die in this state I'm in I'm dead why I tell you the devil's going to give a thousand different excuses he's going to pour it on you but I'll tell you you just need to get up because life abundant is just down that way you know what that happened to the doter he doed it he doed God's word he doed The Prophet's message and he got to the door the gate and he must have seen the people at a fra of time pouring out heading out into the riches of what God had gave them and then he got trampled and died they don't pay it doubt just believe just believe and Satan has tried to Siege this bride he's tried to hold her bound God has loosed though a word that has broken down the Walls there's no more Siege on the name of Jesus Christ amen it's not bound up by some trinitarian doctrine that has been there through the down Through the Ages but he's brought a word in this day to unleash the riches of his glory and tell you what he where the power lies it's in his name the name of Jesus Christ that you can speak his name there's power in his name I can tell you ages gone by they didn't have that they were Bound by a demon of trinitarianism but God in this day there's no more Siege on that no more there's no more Siege on some Merit or action that you must do something you must whip yourself you must pay a Penance you must do this this you must do that no more it's Grace unmar [Applause] Grace I tell you there's resources you know that people are still bound to that still bound to that BR says once he gets Beyond once you get Beyond The Sound Bearer sound Bearer he said then it's Speed Unlimited you can fly free he says in the church chur and you sitting here tonight you're struggling and struggling when you come up to that sound Bearer those planes Rattle and shake and bounce around and it's he said that you're struggling God's up pulling you and showing you things he says if you can ever get past the sin barrier of unbelief if you can just press past all the doubt all that Satan's putting in your mind say well I don't know if I can fully commit I don't know if I can fully get myself over can I really believe for this need can I really believe for my son or daughter fully commit pass the sin barrier of unbelief he says then unlimited Revival will break out through the United States and everywhere if you can go beyond the sound barrier of sin barrier of unbelief he says oh is it true Did you does it mean could I be healed could I be saved are you asking that question well I'm going to answer it for you could I be filled with the Holy Spirit somebody asking that question tonight he says get beyond that just keep struggling and struggling till you break through the Holy Ghost comes upon you he said I'm telling you you're beyond the dead and 50 miles of Elbow Room who's in need of that tonight there's no reason why you should leave a door tonight without the filling of the Holy Spirit where you got 50 miles of Elbow Room ain't no devil in left or right sir I said it's time to break through look to the one that Caleb looked do can we make it over is that land mine can I obtain the life yes can I have Liberty yes you know the human being we got limits man man is so keen on trying to get past them man they pump Them Bodies full of pills and this protein powder this lifting weights and this they're just trying to get a little extra out of their out of their body they're trying to do mind exercises so that their memory can go a little further because they don't want to get dementa earlier so they're they're trying to make sure what can I do to extend the limit because there's a limit right here if I can just get another year we can get the life expectancy one more year another five years they craving and there's potential in here with limits you know hey I'm I got a lot of potential in here too I'm not going down there and some of you young men you do you pump your weight you do whatever and you're trying to trying to find the potential inside your being and some attain it most do not most do not indeed but potential is the latent qualities or abilities that may be developed veled and lead to future success that latent means it's existing but not yet developed or manifest it's hidden or concealed so there's a concealed quality or a hidden quality within it's lying dormant or it's hidden until circumstances that are suitable for development or manifestation all right you know and God wants to show through the scripture that there's greater there's something in side greater than just the human flesh I mean and a lot of times through the scripture God uses men and women to push past the limits that are not capable by this human body and so we can go into scripture and we can read about Samson who by all man's rights didn't have anything as far as strength but God stepped in in the moment and anointed his flesh and something greater beyond the limitations of this manifested amen how about Solomon say wow he was so wise not human wisdom but God stepped in and poured out a wisdom From Another Dimension from an unseen realm and dropped it into with Solomon's being and Solomon then exuded beyond the limitations of this Daniel dream and visions and such and different ones through scripture type after type something changed mary caught the word of God in her hour and It produced something beyond the limits of man see when God steps on the scene God don't care about your limitations man strives for it man does all it can for it he tries to put you this course and that and the other but God has the ability to go beyond in an unlimited place so unlimited that someone like Sam could have Samson could have strength to slay hundreds and hundreds of Philistines and they marveled they're like how on Earth can he do that because God simple when God steps in God has is the god of the unlimited and so God now has put his life into flesh and I want to just talk now as Mary then received the word and as an incubator then brought forth God came forth and poured himself into flesh and so now God was giving an example if I create I'm going to create flesh my body that I created not man not from Mary not from Joseph but from God spoken word that she then incubated and he poured his life into it he says now I'm going to step into Earthly measures and I'm going to show what God can do amen and to give you and I and Humanity an insight into the unlimited of God and so now he steps and yes he wept he got tired his strength withered he had to go to sleep he probably got a cut in a bruise struck his toe he bore he was a human he bore that but one day he stepped into a wedding I just know God must have been just excited because he knew today I'm going to give Humanity a taste of my unlimitedness thank you oh there's no more wine the wedding's a catastrophe everything's ruined our reputation is over over oh Mak do you think you can do something do you think I can do something and God in his Simplicity steps into a little chamber and at the Finger of God at the word of God water pots that were water turn into wine I can tell you there's no human ability that could do that but in human flesh because God life embodied that he could speak a word and change water to wine he probably had a little smirk on his on his face as he knew this was the beginning of my unlimited nature the latent the concealed or hidden quality began to now manifest why because eternity combined with the Mortal remove the limits just walk with me on this one come on get to the end of my service eternity inside the Mortal breaks through the limits of humanity come on the flesh is limited but when it's struck with the with the eternity inside it went beyond the abilities of this flesh yeah my touch can go so far far my eyeballs can see so far maybe I can see 100 yards maybe a glimmering little candle it starts to get limited or I hearing in this Dimension I can only hear someone whisper from the back I couldn't hear you cuz I'm limited in my flesh but when God life dropped in and he started to walk Hallelujah he sat down at the well with a little lady and she had a thirst man she had a thirst but human consumption of water she tasted it but it didn't quench it and she went to this husband and this husband and this husband and this need and this pleasure and that and she's trying to taste she's trying to take it in and her Humanity could not get quenched but then the one the son of man Steeps on the scene he says but if I give you water you'll never thirst again why because eternity had stepped into flesh and he said I got something greater than the limits of this Earth I can give you not this water but I can give you living water and you'll never thirst [Applause] again can you think of that moment that she started her Source was now filled and guess what she became rivers of Living Water and she tore into the city come see a man who told me everything I was it started to flow out of her because what had happened she had partaken of the same eternity and she now was Living Waters herself and sharing it saying I'm changed here's the Messiah something happens something happens when you get in contact with eternity how about the little woman that had to touch his garment that little lady tapped into another realm she was clambering my if I could which I won't but she tore through the crowd if I had time I'd have you all pour out into this aisle and i' tear straight through you cuz that's what she had to do she was tearing through she's like I don't really care about you all I'm getting through that's right she thought her human touch she knew by faay the Viking reach him something will change my need will be met the circumstance I live in if I can reach into another realm yeah it wasn't this come on it wasn't this it was Faith she was tapping into another realm I need to reach him I need to touch him but it's her faith that tapped in and the limits of her body the limits of her touch pressed past into another dimension and God's virtue passed from him to her and she was [Applause] healed brother Brown says the doctor's limited God is unlimited the doctor he can work with two senses what he can see what he can feel only his two senses he can declare that will declare anything but God has untapped resources Hallelujah I wonder if we can just bring it to today how about there's something happened in the building a healing it's a lady sitting here right here in the audience kind of heavy set lady she's got her hands up her eyes are closed and she's praying she's got a bowel trouble and a back trouble and she's praying for God to heal her she sitting right here wearing glasses a dark suit right at the end of this row you got your hands up that's what's wrong with you if that's right ra ra raise your hands I don't know you or strangers go home now you touched the border of His Garment you touched him because I'm 20 ft from you but you touched him the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities if it can happen to that lady in that meeting surely you can also reach by faith in another realm and tap into the resources of the god of the unlimited don't limit to God to's 1950 1960 19658 don't limit him there don't let your puny mind of time limit God to 58 he's got a 2024 Saints how about Martha you know one of my most favorite lines of scripture is when she says even now Lord You're the resurrection in life do you believe Martha yes Lord I know he'll rais but even now even now one could speak she was speaking to one that could reach into the regions I'm sorry but our human limitation ends at death but she was speaking to one who could go far beyond the Realms of this life he could tap into another dimension even now Lord I know you're the resurrection and life though he said believe that is Martha though he were dead yet shall he live yes Lord I believe even now and at the word of God by a name spoken it reached and pierced into another dimension and penetrated far to wherever Lazarus was and cried Lazarus come forth Lazarus I know where he was but he must have got the call and said I'm actually due back on Earth because one that could Pierce into another dimension that could tap into the unlimited Martha's Faith believed on the resurrection and he said don't worry Martha I can speak it and I'll call him back all right I'll jump ahead who lives in you who's Holy Ghost filled okay so then whose life lives in you what did he say Moses why Cry To Me Speak Hallelujah you know one thing that you have that's unlimited I'll tell you your words some people use less and some people use more but I can tell you you could talk 24 hours a day 365 you have pretty much got a limited words and by your confession Hallelujah instead of using them words for who knows what else you could speak and continually confess the word of God and those words reach into the eternities and tap into another realm and reach the unlimited resources of God say God I've got a son I've got a daughter I've got a need I've got a circumstance I'm going to use my words to confess what your word said I'm going to put it on my lips and the unlimited resource you gave me I'm going to use it to profess the finished [Applause] work habac says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by faith I wonder tonight who's a Martha that needs to cry out even now my Limitless God even now but BR says when a man when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present oh you say brother Michael you pasted that quote in after last night that's wrong that was already in my notes so God knows that you needed to hear it twice when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present as you heard last night there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen he's looking at the god of the Limitless amen yet by promise he says now how Abraham how not only did he see the UN and the reason he believed it was because it God said it he said and if we be dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in Christ dwells in US it does the same thing it takes every Divine promise of God that's in the Bible and calls it present tense Hall amen because in my notes he said because that present God is unlimit is Unlimited in his resources to meet every one of your needs you say well brother Michael you're just copying your dad no the Holy Ghost is saying again to confirm to you I heard and now I'm meeting your [Music] need you know there was a man named Legion this was a duel because here Satan had done everything and he started pouring on demon after demon and whether it was a lie or whether he stole I don't know what he did and one Spirit came upon him and then another Spirit came upon him and it just continued to evolve and to grow and to grow until this man was a complete bundle of demons think about it and Satan he must have put his shoulders back and buttoned up his coat and said there there is a picture there's a picture of what I can do this is the epitome of my power and he watched with Glee as he went raving and spitting and cutting himself through the tombs of the dead and Satan stood back and said look what I can do look at my power but then the same God that had proved himself already gets off a boat tired he's tired he'd been preaching Healing The Sick meeting the needs he steps onto the shore and Satan says says oh yeah it Showdown and he sends that demon Laden man right to the feet of Jesus and those demons they know who's God they fall down and they start to scream out scream out and call and worship don't send this out and they start to to manifest themselves and in flesh is now in a duel between a limited devil and an unlimited [Applause] God everything the devil could pour on he poured on this was his moment to shine this is his time to say all right this is what I can do here's my Showcase of my power of the darkness that I can contain and a little humble man that he thought at the Finger of God loose him it wasn't some super duper prayer service it wasn't I'm calling Heaven down and I'm casting you out no no God just said leave him [Music] the unlimited God yes sir nothing nothing could stop Legion from his freedom at that moment nothing the limits of Satan were so on display I pray you hold this in your mind the epitome of his power was so limited at that moment because God was going to show you and I there's nothing he can do that is more or more greater than the power that God had when God in flesh stepped on the [Applause] SE come on I can tell you when Legion was free I can tell you the Devils were holding on tight come on don't let him go don't let him go Satan saying hold on boys hold on let him [Applause] go Legion Broke Free he tore off he said Glory I'm free because an unlimited God stepped on the scene so then what's your need tonight my God the unlimited the omnipotent is here tonight I don't care if you say well brother Michael I'm a legion well I'll tell you this that's the limits of Satan's the unlimited God let [Applause] Hallelujah don't leave tonight don't leave tonight my goodness I can tell you Legion had the opportunity this is your moment Christ is coming on the scene the unlimited God is coming your way I can tell you he was not going to miss that moment you know and the Devils would tried their level best but he was a seed of God I don't care how hard the Devils tried to run this direction and pull him and took a war nothing the seed was being beckoned yes by the master and it called him and it drew him whether he liked or not down to the seat of the one that could save him if you're a seed of God I don't care what devil thinks I don't care what he says I don't care what doubt he cast in your mind you're getting drawn in because you're a seed of God and his word starts to call and beckon you to his feet Hallelujah [Music] one man I got to skip this you know when you approach him right when you approach him right it unlocks the resources of God approach him wrong and you get no response it's important barus cried out son of David have mercy on me and God met his need another little lady cried out son of David he didn't didn't even answer her didn't didn't say a word oh Lord I help me approach to the word is vital you know after she said Lord help me she worshiped she says I need you and then she humbled herself amen yes cuz he said even dogs he says yes Lord she humbled herself to the word whatever the word was saying she said yes Lord unlocked actually unlocked the healing for her daughter so as a parent as a loved one as a mom as a dad we approach the word with the right respect with the right right approach the right attitude the right mod the right objective we approach him Lord whatever your word says I just need you to unlock the resources for my daughter that's all she cared for that's all she desired I'm going to shift years a little bit what in a moment when now that life that lived in flesh deity in flesh God in morphe came down and now hung on Calvary because there's a barrier there's a limit that you and I couldn't go into his presence and God broke that Veil The Flesh Veil so that you and I could now approach and enter in boldly I preached on it year a little while back but I was just pondering a little when how that priest he was the only one that could go in once a year that's all just him and how everybody would have looked at him and just yearned if I could just go into the presence of God if I could just be the high priest oh just a taste of that shuk kind Glory I could have a morel of that mana and the priest did everything required everything was ready everything was ready for the S of bringing in the blood and the atonement and he walk in and everybody would be hushed yearning oh what would that be like to step into the Shana presence of God but your God said I yearn for that too so I'm going to step down and I'm going to break the veil so that you can step in and come into my presence and you too can face on the Mana Living Word of God you too can come into and you can let the veil close behind and it's just you and [Music] me you know we put a mental limit on the blood of Calvary because we get limited in our mind as we're humans of measurement and we can run this sometimes into the Realms of sin and we measure sin we measure it bad this is this is a white lie that's not a white lie you know that's just a little false that's almost all truth but a little false but that's so that's kind of less sin and that's more sin you he murdered but he only gave a white lie I'm sorry but to God it's all sin if White Lies were on the SC jaale of things low and just minor sins well then Eve had a very minor sin really at the end of the day she just just teeny little bit she doubted a little bit and that caused the world to go into chaos so I'm telling you there's no unit of measurement in sin for God it's just all wrong all sin but somehow we classify things and then so those that have grave sins you know somehow that merits the deepest deepest regions of hell and sins that are so bad you yes there are sins you can cross the line indeed but that's not I'm going but butam says if the truth of gospel has been presented to you in such a way that you have to see it and because of popularity or something else you turn your back to it and walk away and don't want to see it that's where you cross the line for he disbelieves willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no sacrifice for sin but that's so that's a different but I want to talk about even our measurement where even David you know we can look at David and all his sin and that all adultery that he committed and lusted after a woman plotted to to to mask the sin POS IAH so that he was the dad and then that didn't work so then he plotted a murder and then indeed did have Uriah murdered and we just look at that and say oh dear goodness David that is uh that's at the top brother Brown says and the prophet said surely he says Grace you'll not die you'll not die David he says Grace has saved you it was Grace to David that saved him if it hadn't been for Grace where would we be isn't that right sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace from a sovereign one he said it twice Sovereign he says what can Sovereign Grace can only be given from one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask nobody it don't have to be like hey should I should I let them should I let them off the hook should I cover their sin should my blood atone for that no he don't have to ask nobody no question he just says my grace he says it does what it wants to it isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do that can I must I will I doesn't do it it does it itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the violence he can save the worst he can save the impur he can save the immoralist he can heal the sick is hallelujah that's the blood of Calvary that tore back the veil and shed it on the cross he said there's nothing it's Unlimited in its Grace Hallelujah you say well brother Michael I still feel that it's I'm unsavable in that sense all right I'll just level you up manasse in the scripture began to rain at 12 for 55 years he says to have the longest rain in Israel he came from a believing home he had a good daddy Hezekiah did right in God's eyes he repaired altars he followed the ways of David Hezekiah was faithful he had a heart for God it was a solid home and Manasseh grew up in this home this good message believing solid home he believed there or manasse was born there and often in those types of homes often young ones that have grown up in the message we see that they will go off and they will go off and sometimes it isn't like the sin is even intensified those that are raised in the message and they go off into sin well Manasseh he was it was all the Heathen altars he started to repair Hezekiah died Manasseh grows up takes rain at 12 and he starts to repair all the Heathen altars his father tore down he removed and destroyed the altars of God the Groves and high places he put altars for all the host of Heaven he he put away the altars he said you you name it he made an altar for all the gods he made an altar for this God for that God for that he basically walked over the testimony of his daddy right undoing all that his ancestors done before him if I could say this he was destroying the testimony of his family that was that was before him that that what they had held up and he set up Gods to bail and such in the house of the Lord desecrating the Holy Temple in the very place where God was worshiped is there any I would say is there anything different than someone coming today sitting in the house of the Lord boldly living a sinful life no different he influenced Israel to sin he helped counsel countless soul to sin encouraged joyously LED his country to sin tremendously before God and then he even allowed his own children to be sacrificed the unthinkable I'd say no different than maybe sending our CH children into the fires of this world and allowing the garbage that's presented before them and willfully subjecting them to the Fashions and gods of this world into the fire not a lot of different and this is what Manasseh did in the natural and even if you think this Abomination did not satisfy Manasseh he was the very glutton for iniquity he used enchantments and dealt with famili familiar spirits and deal with the Devil by seeking all kinds of Supernatural witcheries and wizardries and if that wasn't enough 2 Kings 21:16 says and moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to the other but besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin and doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and I could say heaping up Mountain on mountain of foul sin after foul sin and I might say that maybe manasse would be the compound of every sort of wickedness I don't know if there was even more of a person that was more evil that could have done any more than manasse so I don't really care I'm talking to somebody here that might be saying somehow that your sin or your state of being is at the max and I just don't know God could ever save me May maybe I've crossed the line you're here that tells me you haven't crossed the line and so there is manasse here here and if you ended there in Second Kings then the prophets were sent out to him and different ones that judgment was going to come and 2 Kings 2:20 2 Kings 21:10 says the Lord spake to his servants to prophets and they said we're going to bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah and more and whosoever heareth both his ears shall tingle God is bringing judgment and you can read 2 Kings 21 and you can see a life in a trail of evil all the way through of the most wretched that will make your ears even tingle of the judgments that God put down on him and you would think that's terrible of all terribleness but if you didn't ever jump up into 2 Chronicles you only got half the picture because Manassa through all that sin and shame and something his daddy had told him maybe come back to his mind maybe has a had had a little devotion with him one day and he talked to him of a limitless God he says manaso our God is Jehovah he is God he's capable of the impossible he can move mountains he can part Red Seas he can bring Mana when there was no food he can give he just would go through the Miracles and wonders of God All Through the Ages and he would teach him Manasseh God's the god of the impossible he can do all things don't ever don't ever limit Jehovah a man as he's in Affliction now the scripture says he brought them to a Syria manasse among the Thorns they bound him with FEDS carried into Babylon and when he was in Affliction when he was in Affliction he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and he heard his supplication and brought him came to Jerusalem then manasse knew the Lord he was God Hallelujah the limit unlimited power of the blood I don't if God can do that and pardon and save and keep manasse through all that he did do not tell me whatever you've done is worse than that that's in scripture at the highest peak of evil to tell you God's blood can cover all sin [Applause] don't limit this token blood don't put a limit on what it can do God did not go through all that in scripture I'm going to come down to a close God did not go through all scripture and to show of his unlimited nature and the resources that you can take tap into just to leave it there God didn't do that just to walk and be like yeah this is what I can do though he was doing that but he wasn't stopping there because that same unlimited resource at Calvary and that spear pierced his side and his blood was shed and the spirit left him it was going somewhere it wasn't staying there with him he had somebody a bride in his mind that he says I need to deposit my unlimited nature into that's the greater plan Saints it this doesn't end at scripture we got to bring it right to here right to now the same unlimited resource lays within you and in me amen you said well brother Michael that God in flesh veiled yes brother Bram says now the same word that the prophet spoke the same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if it don't we don't compromise the same word living in you we'll produce the same thing sir why was God so focused why is the scripture so everywhere through scripture it's it's F it's Union it's a bride it's a virgin womb it's a pure bride it's a church unadulterated we we can see this all through scripture it's because because it's bringing to realities God there's something that he's wanting to to to to unite with he's wanting to deposit something in it it must be the right one I tell you the wrong woman and the right okay let me back up there are Potentials in a woman and Potentials in a man and when they come together those potentials can manifest all right but bring the wrong man on the wrong woman and you got chaos but bring the right man and the right woman it becomes perfect in God's eyes and it can bring together or manif EST am the potentials that lay inside all right so God is in is so concerned that his bride is being united the potential in her is not a corrupted hybrid potential but random says God has never changed he's determined to do something and nothing going to stop him he'll do it the gene that God put in you you might not see it you might not feel it you might not be able to hear it but there's a resource inside you that's waiting to come in connection with the groom and that unseen potential laying inside your soul it requires life or light I should say that would that could was triggered at Calvary to strike the seed Within amen and that manifestation that seed Gene of God that's in there is a potential and it's waiting to be unlocked by the word of this hour amen that's what the that's why it's so critical to see and to see the word revealed in this day and age because God placed inside of you a potential a life that's sitting there a seed that's sitting there but it can't be unlocked it's latent until a certain time period when the word gets manifest in this day and Strikes you amen that's what this message is it's the removal of all limits that's what the loosening of these seals are it's God removing the limits it's not God saying this God's limits but he's revealing or opening the what his word can do I should say it's opening what you the revelation of what he is he's always been unlimited but Through the Ages only Luther saw the just to live by faith we Wesley only saw well it's saved by grace but in this day God tore off the limits of Revelation and said I'm going to pour in this day a word so that you can see yourself as [Applause] unlimited that's what this message is it's so you know who you are so you can tap into the same life but it required a minor it required deep exploration it required a prophet to be to the mighty Angel to descend and give him an open book so that he could then present it to you and I oh my goodness I pray we get it tonight you have the unlimited resource of God deposited inside of you he removed the barriers the fingers of the false doctrine of the false prophet loosing and releasing all of the different constraints freeing the trap that Luther was under tearing the seal off that Wesley was under Pentecost was in a barrier but God was removing it all God this day says I'm done I need her to know who she is I need her to be free from all limitations I need her to know because I need her to get a little bit I need her to get Rel released from Gravity loser was kind of bound down he didn't have it all Wesley was also bound down Pentecost a little bound down but in this day this hour you and I have been given a word so you can see wait a second is that what God did all this for he came he typed himself all the way through in Joseph and in David and all that so he could reveal himself of who he is so then I can see that I'm part of him so that I can say if it's his life in me that I'm like him if he's a resurrection I also have Resurrection inside of me that's why yes that's why that's why this word came to tear the [Applause] limits I'm not a god of some Catholic Idol I'm not a god of Sanctified living just or just a god of gifts and healings and tongues I'm a God desirous of a bride I need to bring her back to Eden Beauty I'm just going to lift her vision a little so she can see herself as unlimited that's why these final seal these seals were broken it was a secret till now but brand said musicians you better come I might have you sit here for a little bit but if you make your way I I say at home you put the pressure on me so but Brown says well end on this I was thinking that the natural man went out at the Unseen of his eye and pulled an atom down out of the sky and split that atom in two that destroys human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of God can draw amen he says this knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with with the supernatural he says if he could do that in the natural realm what ought man of God be doing so man can split an atom destroy human life this is 1949 he says what ought man of God the man of God be doing friends he says the church is far behind let's pray my God that we'll move his church up the natural man with natural resource is getting greater results than people that call themselves Christians let's press into the Unseen the blessings are yours they're there for you I thought Lord 1949 so then I did a little research and in 19499 man indeed with vision and the splitting of an atom that creates a very large large emission of energy bomb think bomb and brother BR is saying how can natural man be doing this we should be the spiritual man we're way behind this there's power there in fion magnitudes of Power Man was tapping into God's laboratory splitting breaking apart and destroying but there's a greater method I loved it so I'm just going to love preaching it right here right now there's a greater method that man has been unable to harness they've tried since the for about 100 and something or 1930s or something like that they've been trying to harness fusion fusion is the combination of two small particles joining to one and the magnitude of power that comes out of fusion is almost Limitless in fact man even considers it Limitless that's Fusion but they can't figure out because it's actually the Collision they need so much energy for Fusion okay it's the same process fion doesn't happen naturally in the world man has to do it man has to create division man has to create a bomb that splits but naturally in this world Fusion happens where it happens naturally in the Su n on the sun that's what's powering the sun is Fusion it is a power unlike no other in the Stars and I thought well there must have been in 49 brother Brandon was looking saying where's where's the spiritual man but in 1963 I said oh my goodness Fusion began to happen as a bride was starting to unite and collide with the s o n of God and a power was getting released in this day so that a unlimited power was released into his bride the sun's massive gravitational force naturally includes induces fusion and without that force a higher temperature is needed man cannot do it but it happens in the stars I thought Lord that's what's happening right here it's Fusion it's a bride being fused with the groom amen fision that's for man but Fusion this is she this bride in this last day an unlimited bride in resources she's now tapping into she's become part of the source if you're part of the source then what's inside you then what are you capable of [Music] [Applause] [Music] speaking it's like you're almost a Super Woman not no super Wonder Woman of this world you have to realize that natural inspiration of the of Darkness Taps into a realm and if they're tapping in that then what is happening it's called God's super lady is being manifest you say well brother Mark I don't really feel how am I ever a Superman how am I a superwoman well because you walk out on a street of every filthy demon is throwing every bit of wickedness your way and you bow your head and you deny it I sat in a plane with all filth and garbage on every screen around me I just said oh God where are we living I put my a lay buds on that's the power of God because you sisters reject the power of an enemy to Adorn yourself with garments fit for Destruction that is an Abomination to God and live in Purity and no makeup and no jewels and all this because you men are men not cowering to the ideals of weakness and Jellyfish standard because you sisters stand up to head stand under headship submitting to the word as help meets not swallowing this girl power or any power but it's God power in you and me because young people won't let the perversion of Hollywood and music and fith and entertainment that's a super race because inside you is an limited power that can combat the darkness of this day you say that doesn't sound so great I tell you every bit of pressure that Satan can is upon you and I and you're walking Victorious that's super power [Music] [Applause] It's Time To Break Free the limits of your mind God's crying to you it's time you're Limitless you're fused with eternity better brandham said in my last quote I just wonder though tonight if you're willing are you willing to get up oh I sit here till I die Brown says now that you might know that this be the spirit of God the next row behind the woman a man sitting there with trouble in his neck if you'll believe sir God will make you well you believe it do you believe it raise up your hand I'm a stranger to you but he's not see whenever you are just have faith wherever you are I want you to apply this quote here because if my God is the god of unlimited God that means that if he can do that here that same God is present right now because we heard it last night he's the god of the present so he's Unlimited in the present and so if he can speak to needs here can you not meet your need here he can raise your hand see wherever you are just have faith in God can you pass that barrier of unbelief now can you let the Holy Ghost come in right now and take

little softer s just a little more it's always a battle it's always a challenge the condition I'm in that I realize that I'm aware of that I can feel and a word that's Supernatural but I've got to get out of my condition and I've got to say I'm going to walk into that Supernatural amen I'm going to rise up from my leopard condition and I'm going to walk into the abundance of the resources that God has and youve just got to say it you got to admit it's for me you know some of us are in such bondage to church order we're in such bondage to the our churches and our doctrines and and we're so bound down by everything we can hardly just lift our hands and say thank you Lord for saving me you want the Holy Spirit tonight the holy spirit is here all you've got to do is go through the battle you say I've asked for it a hundred times you know what the prophet of God said if you put the bullet in a gun and you fired a dud a h 100 times he said put the next bullet in and fire it it again pre- Adventure this one is going to go off and let's don't live below our privilege it it I don't want to have a shou and fit and then walk without it I would rather sit here sober in a clear mind and make a decision [Music] Satan you says I can't God says I can I'm going to believe him Satan says you're sick God says he's my healer I'm going to believe him I'm going to accept the Unseen resources of almighty God I'm going to accept the super natural God that can do all things I'm going to serve that God not a Doctrine not a church not a Ministry I am here tonight to serve the Unseen Supernatural God that's full of promises Glory Joy freedom and joy unsp speakable that's the God that I serve is that the god you serve tonight is that the god you want to continue to serve then make the choice in your heart you know there's a little song I like to sing and I I I've been through a lot of battles I've been through physical battles I've been through mental battles but there's one thing I know one day on a rooftop with long hair I opened the book to Romans chapter 1 and I sat on that roof desperate alone afraid suicidal and I read chap Romans chapter 1 and I asked in my heart I said Lord that's my life I'm a a truth speaker I'm incontinent I'm a murderer I'm amongst murders I'm amongst bikers I'm amongst all this stuff but you saidah and I accept you into my heart and he came into my heart and he's never left me great and he's never forsake me and I've never been sorry that I made that [Music] choice are you sorry tonight you made that choice yes sir have you made the choice well if you made the choice then take the benefits take the resources don't leave the gold on the ground grab it take take it it's mine are you unhappy are you miserable well why don't you take joy unspeakable Are you full of fear that you're going to go to hell no anybody that tells you it makes you afraid to W fears of the devil and don't be afraid amen be happy amen amen don't be afraid if God be for you who can be against you we ought to be the happiest people in the whole world we ought to be full in our hearts if you heard the word of God tonight you should be happy amen I heard tonight that there is an unlimited resource God full of power and he's for me amen and I can either do one thing I can believe what he said or I can believe all these other lies you say brother M girl you're making it simple it's that simple who are you going to believe the liar or the way the truth the life who you going to believe the sickness that tells you you're going to die or are you going to believe that God said that I died on the cross for that sickness yes what are you going to take you say I got a habit I I got a tobacco habit I got an alcohol habit are you going to believe that that habit is going to keep you in Chains or are you going to believe that Jesus said I resurrected so I can deliver you from that you got to take one or the other tonight church as for me in my house I choose to take the Living God I I I refuse to live below the blessings any longer will you make that determination tonight I refuse to live below the blessings that God has provided for me and I can sing this with all my [Music] heart amen ever since Jesus saved and pardon I've been singing every day I've never been sorry l a trust is oh and Shadow is with me God all the I've never been sorry oh that I trusted his name oh I've never been sorry that I trusted his blessed holy name every moment find exact my soul has been singing since the Savior came i' never been sorry that I trusted his name all the long I sing the story pra before his wonderous i' never been sorry that I trusted his name oh surely I know our home is waiting beautiful home in Heaven above i' never been Sor oh that I trust in his name oh I never been sorry that I trust in his blessed Hol every moment I find it EXA my soul has been singing since the Savior came i' never been sorry and I trusted his name the start hope is [Music] shining never s that I trusted his name oh never thought of said reining Jus is this minut I know i' never been sorry trusted his name oh i' never been sorry but I trusted his bless and every moment I exactly the same my soul is been singing since the Savior came I've never been sorry this now I want to say this we heard he's the same right we say he's all powerful that he can do all things I have a question I don't want somebody that just wants more of God you know where you find more of God you don't for find more of God in a prayer line amen you find more of God in a closet amen you don't get more of God when somebody lays hands on you now that's just saying I'm going to let them lay hands on so I don't have to do my work I don't got to get in my closet and pray and till I break through and die and confess my sins but sometimes there's Believers that are in our midst that Satan has put an Affliction on them maybe a cancer maybe a real sickness and not not just people being prayed for because oh I hope I I need to get well or I need the Holy Ghost you know where you find the holy ghost in your closet that's where you find it when you're really hungry and you're really desperate but I wonder tonight if there's one Among Us that's a Believer and you have a sickness you have a disease and you'd like the Saints to pray for you and you believe that if the Saints pray for you that you'll be well that's a simple challenge now maybe there's nobody sick amongst us maybe nobody's suffering with a disease and I say I thank God for that but I'm not afraid to challenge that sickness if he's in on your life so I just want to say if if you that it's right there before you you can either say I I've got this problem or I'm sick and I I believe that the ever present God that these brothers preached has unlimited resources to deliver me from that sickness then I'd say the same thing you for you tonight if you know you're not saved and you know you don't have the Holy Ghost not I want more of God or I want to come up here and repent and say I'm sorry oh God I'm so sorry for everything I didn't know you want the everpresent god to come into your life life and change you amen and you think that if you were willing to make that step and come and ask the brothers to say would you pray for me but if you know there's a Holy Spirit and you know better then just go home and apply the token that's what you need to do you need to go apply the token get rid of the music get rid of the games get rid of this just go apply the token and the Holy Spirit will come that's not what I'm talking about we've deluded the real challenges down if you've got a devil and you know you have a Tormentor then God's church can deliver you from that torment amen if your backslid then read your Bible and pray fast and take care of that yourself but we've played Church we've covered it up with music and songs and everything and it's time that we come face to face with our own [Music] mirror so I hope there's not any anyone in here that has a physical Affliction but if you do I believe the men that have preached this gospel believe that God could heal you and I'd like to invite you to be prayed for if you know you need it if you don't Hallelujah I would rather have well people than S people if you've all got the Holy Ghost I would rather be dwelling with people that have the Holy Ghost than people that don't but you see the challenge of this word is we've got to start getting honest with ourselves we've got to start getting honest with our conditions and honest with our heart's desire I love what our brother said he says that power is within us have you tapped the life that's within you amen I pray tonight that you'll make a determination in your heart that you and the one and only powerful omnipotent God that we heard about that you enter into Fellowship that's all my heart's desire is that you know him in the fullest of his glory and that's what Peter said without faith it's impossible to please God for We must believe that he is how many believe he is and that he's here and that he's a rewarder of that them that diligently seek him when are we going to start grabbing our reward quit paying for your sins take everything he's got he loves you so very very very much brother Ron it's nice to have you would you come dismiss our service in prayer please take him with you he's here before brother Ron prays I just want to say that we have leftovers from the barbecue it's going to be put out for you we want our guest to go over and eat feet first and if you eat it all up then the Home Folks can go home but there's some leftover barbecue some left over sandwiches maybe some leftover desserts that's for that carnal man that's trying to kill you tonight but I hope that you take the spiritual food that was delivered here tonight and know that you can live in the presence of the omnipresent God and he'll never leave you nor forsake you but be will with you even with you and in you till the end would you ask a bless say a prayer for the food too brother un amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord as we have heard your word tonight and barriers have been broken places that we have limited you because of life and because of the things we've been taught but tonight we've sat at your feet and learned of you that you're an unlimited God unlimited power if we would just believe your disciples asked what can we do to work the works of God and he said just believe father I pray that you will allow everyone here tonight may they father come to that place that I believe help my unbelief father I thank you for the word that's gone forth let it fall into the good ground of faith in our hearts believing every word of God possessing every gate redeeming every promise we thank you and we praise you we ask you to bless the food father that is here and prepared I pray that you will bless it give us health and strength in our bodies we ask these things for your glory in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen amen God bless you let's sing this as we're dismissed amen there's a calm that Cal that cover
