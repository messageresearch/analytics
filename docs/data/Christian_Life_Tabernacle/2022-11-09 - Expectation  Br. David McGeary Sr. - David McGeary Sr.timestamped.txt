[22:06] thank you
[22:09] flavor is a special
[22:17] [Music]
[22:28] I was just thinking
[22:30] yesterday about
[22:33] the scripture that says in him we lead
[22:36] we live and breathe and have our being
[22:40] and just how
[22:42] Jesus is the center of everything of joy
[22:45] and
[22:47] I read another scripture about how the
[22:49] Pharisees by not accepting the baptism
[22:53] of John had refused the Council of God
[22:56] against them
[22:57] so that that just kind of made an
[22:59] impression of me and just on Jesus to be
[23:02] the center of everything I do
[23:04] [Music]
[23:09] um
[23:12] Jesus
[23:14] you're the center of
[23:18] my
[23:19] joy
[23:23] oh that's good and perfect comes from
[23:28] you
[23:32] the other's heart of my content
[23:37] Hope For All I Do
[23:42] Jesus you're the center of my joy
[23:51] when I've lost my direction
[23:55] you're the campus for my way
[23:59] [Music]
[24:09] in sadness you're my laughter
[24:14] that shatter's on my face when no more
[24:21] your hand is
[24:28] Jesus
[24:30] you're the center of my door
[24:38] oh that's good and perfect comes for me
[24:47] another heart of my contentment and the
[24:52] hope for all that I do
[24:56] Jesus Jesus you're the center of
[25:01] my joy
[25:06] you are why I find pleasure
[25:10] in the simple things in life
[25:20] [Music]
[25:24] the voices of the children
[25:28] my family and Michael
[25:33] source
[25:36] and half my
[25:38] highest dreams
[25:42] Jesus
[25:45] for the sin
[25:46] [Music]
[25:46] us
[25:54] [Applause]
[25:56] for me
[26:01] Jesus
[26:08] [Music]
[26:11] you're the center of
[26:14] my joy
[26:18] let's sing it again Jesus
[26:21] you're the center of my
[26:28] job home that's good and perfect comes
[26:33] from you
[26:35] [Music]
[26:44] I do
[26:47] Jesus you're the same you're the center
[26:50] of my joy one more time
[26:55] singing Jesus oh
[27:05] that's good
[27:09] thank you

[27:24] Jesus you're the center of
[27:28] glad you're
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] [Applause]
[27:42] not your blood is the center of your joy

[28:55] I wanted to comment I mean there's
[28:57] nothing more than being in the presence
[29:00] of God and see him moving our midst and
[29:03] do things that only he can do
[29:05] and then that's how it's
[29:11] been a lot of words

[33:45] last night
[33:49] [Music]
[33:54] Jesus Christ
[33:57] [Music]
[34:24] our heavenly father
[34:27] Lord our hearts are enlarged
[34:32] [Music]
[34:36] realization
[34:40] coming to pass if your word is
[34:43] ever so real
[34:46] father we see the world that's turned
[34:51] from you
[34:53] man no longer wishes to
[34:56] retain you in their knowledge
[35:00] they've gone the way of their own device
[35:04] but we're here tonight Lord because we
[35:09] believe in you
[35:11] and we need you and we've come to seek
[35:15] your face
[35:16] we've come to hear from you
[35:20] we've come Lord because we believe that
[35:24] thou art kind and merciful
[35:26] and that you will not forsake us or
[35:29] leave us but you'll stand with us and
[35:33] complete that work which you started we
[35:36] ask you to lift our hearts up we pray in
[35:40] Jesus precious name amen amen God bless
[35:44] you be seated just a little bit of where
[35:48] we just share a few things about the
[35:51] word uh it's just
[35:53] seems like you know our meeting has come
[35:57] and and we're here at the time and we're
[36:02] we're just trusting that the Lord will
[36:05] do a lot for us
[36:07] okay we just wanted to ask you a few
[36:10] things uh you probably noticed that
[36:13] everything's pretty uh
[36:15] dirty everywhere with the mud and the
[36:18] rain and everything so we're trying to
[36:22] get that under control
[36:24] and we'd like to try to clean the
[36:27] parking lot up tomorrow so if there's
[36:31] any brothers that can take a couple
[36:33] hours and we have a couple blowers and
[36:36] some brooms and we'll try to clean off
[36:39] the parking lot
[36:40] this parking lot out here uh it's we're
[36:44] going to try to keep it for our visitors
[36:48] for old people
[36:53] and for maybe mothers that have
[36:58] uh children like three and under
[37:01] and so there's only 19 spots
[37:05] but what we would like you to do we
[37:08] would like you to park down the street
[37:11] at the Baptist Church
[37:13] I know a lot of you have been parking on
[37:15] the side streets and some of you been
[37:18] getting tickets you can't park in front
[37:21] of a fire hydrant in Texas
[37:24] you've got to be so many feet from the
[37:27] curb
[37:28] but these streets are dark and I don't
[37:33] really like the idea of people running
[37:35] across central
[37:37] so if it's not too far of a walk
[37:41] you know what I mean if if you think
[37:44] that's difficult I can have some
[37:46] paramedics on standby
[37:48] if you think that two blocks is too much
[37:53] you know
[37:54] but anyway so let's try to do that we've
[37:57] rented the parking lot down the street
[37:59] and so if we could just try to park down
[38:02] there and walk up and the neighbors
[38:06] aren't real happy
[38:08] um but I can't help that so if anybody
[38:12] would do that so we'd like to try to
[38:15] clean up the church tomorrow any
[38:17] brothers that have a time to come over
[38:20] and help and clean and then by the grace
[38:23] of the Lord we're going to start
[38:25] pouring concrete next Monday and maybe
[38:29] in the next few weeks we could have our
[38:31] parking lot in and then that would
[38:35] that would solve that so and then also
[38:39] in in the fact that we are
[38:43] laying concrete we have a lot of Steel
[38:47] to tie a rebar you know and that's where
[38:50] you lay the Steel across and you take a
[38:53] little wire and you twist it together so
[38:55] we need about 20 Brothers to tie rebar
[38:58] so you don't have to be intelligent
[39:01] you know you just have to put a little
[39:04] wire and
[39:06] little we have a little tool that you
[39:09] twist and uh Dan maybe you can come over
[39:12] and show everybody how to tie some rebar
[39:14] you know anyway
[39:17] um
[39:17] it's uh
[39:19] it's not back breaking work but you'll
[39:23] know you'll have a back
[39:25] because so uh
[39:27] we just we just hope maybe some of you
[39:30] will jump in in the next couple weeks
[39:32] and help us
[39:34] one of the things that we're trying to
[39:36] do by doing as much as we can ourselves
[39:40] is to keep our mortgage down
[39:43] so you know we're not where we don't are
[39:47] putting us under a financial
[39:49] uh pressure
[39:51] um I think you've known me for a long
[39:53] time I've never made a lot of pleas for
[39:56] money and I don't preach about money I I
[39:59] just think that when a man's uh born
[40:02] again and he has the spirit of God
[40:05] God's a giver
[40:09] is that right
[40:10] God so loved the world he gave his only
[40:15] begotten son so if you don't have money
[40:18] give your time if if you have money give
[40:23] your time and money
[40:25] you know so one doesn't replace the
[40:29] other
[40:29] so I think we can do this and we're
[40:32] really starting on our way uh it's it's
[40:35] taking form up there so we're real
[40:37] excited about uh doing that so if you
[40:41] could help us tomorrow and then again
[40:45] um I don't know how the deacons correct
[40:48] what preparations they're going to make
[40:50] for visitors I really don't know what
[40:53] we're going to have for visitors because
[40:55] we didn't tell anybody we're having a
[40:57] meeting
[40:58] we can't even seed our own people but if
[41:03] the deacons put some seats out for
[41:06] visitors uh then just uh you know try to
[41:10] help them uh support them and and do
[41:15] what they ask you to do to make their
[41:18] job easier too and then of course the
[41:20] secret is get here a little early
[41:23] and pray and and be seated and then you
[41:28] don't have to be walking in while
[41:30] service is going on you know and be
[41:33] everybody being seated in the song
[41:35] leader trying to lead songs and people
[41:38] strolling in and and all those things
[41:41] and so just do your best if you can to
[41:45] get here early and uh so Friday night
[41:49] it was at seven Saturday morning at 10
[41:55] Saturday evening at five
[41:59] is that right
[42:01] five and then Sunday morning at 11 and
[42:05] then singing so at six so we just want
[42:10] to talk about those things so let's just
[42:14] talk a little bit about what it means to
[42:18] go into a meeting so let's stand and
[42:20] we'll just read two familiar scriptures
[42:24] we won't keep you long tonight
[42:27] but we we just
[42:32] hope that you all come out encourage
[42:37] people like you know in church that
[42:40] maybe haven't been here in a while or or
[42:43] looked around and maybe you can help
[42:45] somebody get here
[42:47] and see what the Lord can do for us
[42:50] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1.
[42:54] I'm sure you all have this memorized
[42:59] Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance
[43:03] of things hoped for
[43:05] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[43:10] and then also Hebrews
[43:13] 11 and 6 without faith it is impossible
[43:17] to please him
[43:20] for he that cometh to God must believe
[43:22] that he is
[43:25] and that he is a rewarder
[43:28] of them that diligently
[43:31] seek him
[43:34] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[43:39] diligently seek him let us pray Heavenly
[43:41] Father we just asked you to bless us
[43:43] this evening we've come together we're
[43:46] preparing our hearts
[43:48] for a meeting that we're having father
[43:52] we're inviting you to this meeting Lord
[43:57] we want to be prepared to receive you
[44:00] we want to be able to recognize you when
[44:04] you come in our midst we want to
[44:07] understand what a great privilege it is
[44:09] to have your presence and all that it
[44:12] can do for us we ask you to bless us now
[44:15] in Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[44:19] bless you may be seated
[44:26] I think there's a a great word that uh
[44:30] brother Branham used many times in
[44:33] talking about services and and talking
[44:37] about preparation uh for a meeting and
[44:42] he would start many of his campaigns
[44:45] uh on this subject of expectation
[44:50] what it means to have expectation and
[44:55] both these scriptures here is a are is
[44:59] kind of a definition of itself of what
[45:05] expectation is
[45:07] faith is the substance of things hoped
[45:10] for or we could read it like this now
[45:12] Faith is the substance of our
[45:16] expectations
[45:18] the evidence that our expectations are
[45:22] going to come to pass
[45:24] so that's what faith is and then also it
[45:30] says without
[45:31] expectation it is impossible to please
[45:35] him
[45:36] for he that cometh the God must believe
[45:41] that he is and he's a rewarder or he is
[45:46] a answerer
[45:48] of expectations and that he's a rewarder
[45:52] of them that diligently seek him now I
[45:56] like uh Webster's uh definition of
[46:01] expectation so we're talking about
[46:04] having a meeting
[46:06] so uh if if we come to a meeting uh and
[46:11] it's just kind of uh I'm just gonna go
[46:15] there and see what's happening
[46:18] well all you'll get is what you see
[46:21] and that can be good or bad just
[46:25] depending on the frame of mind but
[46:30] remember I'm talking about a Revival
[46:33] he said no uh no a preacher brings a
[46:38] Revival
[46:39] in other words he doesn't pack the
[46:42] Revival with him it's the people that
[46:46] bring the Revival and and a Revival
[46:51] isn't adding more members it isn't uh uh
[46:56] uh having a of some form of experience
[47:01] or Enlightenment a Revival means to
[47:06] bring back it means to revive to go back
[47:10] to a former place so if you're in if
[47:14] you're not in a place that you were
[47:17] before then you want to uh uh go back to
[47:23] that place if you were closer to the
[47:25] Lord at one time in your life and you've
[47:29] seemed to have gotten cold or you seem
[47:32] to feel like you're you're a distant I
[47:36] think that's a very common feel for a
[47:39] Christian that there's just the dry
[47:42] times there's times that you feel
[47:44] distanced from the Lord you you it's not
[47:48] that you're evil and it's not that
[47:50] you're doing wrong it's not that there's
[47:52] sin in your life but you just don't feel
[47:55] like it may be the presence of the Lord
[47:58] is there like you would like him to be
[48:01] or you would like to go up to Higher
[48:04] Ground the scripture says that I counsel
[48:07] thee to buy of me a ice have that thou
[48:10] mayest see and and sometimes that's all
[48:14] that it is it's just something that
[48:18] would come and Enlighten us and open us
[48:22] up and let us see that we make a contact
[48:26] uh with the Lord and sometimes that's
[48:29] all that it simply is I believe in them
[48:32] I I know it's true I believe the word of
[48:36] God but I just had I just would like to
[48:39] make a contact I would like to be
[48:42] brought back into a relationship and
[48:46] that's what Revival means it means to
[48:48] restore back and this is the age of
[48:54] restoration and it we know it was the
[48:58] restoration of the word the opening of
[49:00] the seals but it's personally a time
[49:03] that God is spending as much time as he
[49:08] can with his bride
[49:12] he's courting her he's he's taking her
[49:16] to a a a place that he's prepared with
[49:19] her he wants to spend a time with her
[49:24] and when you can look at a meeting
[49:27] that's coming up uh
[49:31] the the Revival starts with the people
[49:34] and it starts with a people that want to
[49:38] spend time with him
[49:41] that's what we're talking about we're
[49:44] not coming to a meeting to be preached
[49:47] at
[49:48] you know we're not coming to a meeting
[49:51] to be entertained but we're coming to a
[49:55] meeting because we've set this side of
[49:57] time so we've we've set aside a time
[50:00] like when you want to give with somebody
[50:02] you you set aside a time you say look
[50:06] Let's uh let's go out to have dinner
[50:09] next Sunday or or how about Friday night
[50:12] I have some time off and you making an
[50:16] appointment
[50:17] and if you set some time aside because
[50:19] do you want to spend some time with this
[50:23] person and so when you're going into
[50:26] this meeting you're coming into the
[50:28] meeting you're you're coming in saying
[50:30] I'm coming to this meeting because we've
[50:34] invited the Lord
[50:38] amen so you've got to invite the Lord
[50:41] remember the people bring the Revival
[50:44] the pit the Revival is is by the people
[50:47] the people that today saying Lord I've
[50:50] invited you to the meeting
[50:53] so because I invited you I've been told
[50:57] that you keep all your appointments
[51:01] because okay if if if if I say this this
[51:05] the next few days Lord I'd like to make
[51:07] contact with you I'm inviting you into
[51:10] my life
[51:13] you know I I just don't want to always
[51:16] worship God at arm's length
[51:19] you know I just don't always want to be
[51:21] saying I know you're up there I know
[51:24] you're up there but I I want I I this is
[51:27] just such a time uh that it's becoming
[51:31] personal
[51:33] it's such a time that the real desire of
[51:37] the real believer's heart is is just to
[51:41] be in fellowship with him it gets a
[51:44] different relationship than it's ever
[51:46] been the church Ages was a great
[51:49] relationship as as the church came up
[51:53] from being totally away from them being
[51:56] in the Dark Ages being under
[51:58] trinitarianism and and dogmas and Creeds
[52:02] and being ruled over by the lady osia
[52:06] and ruled over by the ministry and men
[52:09] with great enticing words and great
[52:12] explanations and knowledge and
[52:14] everything they could keep the people at
[52:17] Bay
[52:19] and they can insert themselves between
[52:22] the Savior and the people like they were
[52:25] a mediator and they always were the
[52:30] people were Forever Learning and never
[52:32] coming to the realization of the truth
[52:35] so the ministry inserted themselves
[52:39] almost as uh as an administrator of the
[52:44] thing but poor we're coming into an age
[52:46] where God doesn't have any middlemen
[52:53] it's him and you
[52:56] amen it's him and you
[52:58] so all we can do is we can we can go to
[53:02] his word and we can say the the word
[53:05] says father that in the scripture
[53:10] Jesus told us
[53:13] that if two or three of us would gather
[53:15] together
[53:17] that he would be in our midst
[53:22] anything with ever faith
[53:25] faith has to have a resting place it has
[53:29] to have something that it settles on
[53:31] something that it holds to
[53:35] it can't Faith doesn't float
[53:39] faith is is
[53:41] unmovable because it's attached itself
[53:45] to something
[53:48] and it's it's greater than a barnacle if
[53:53] you anybody know what a barnacle is okay
[53:58] Barnacle just attaches itself you know
[54:01] what I mean it just and that's what
[54:03] faith does faith attaches itself it it
[54:07] just latches on to it and puts a
[54:11] strangle hold on it but it's got to have
[54:14] something to latch to it's got to have
[54:17] something to hold too and that what that
[54:20] is is the word of God
[54:23] so if if the word of God tells us if the
[54:27] Lord told us if you will gather together
[54:29] two or three of you will gather together
[54:32] I promise you
[54:35] that I'll be there
[54:39] that I'll come into your midst so we're
[54:42] going into the meeting we're not having
[54:44] a meeting just to have a meeting because
[54:45] uh like I said this is for us what it is
[54:49] is us as a body
[54:52] fitted and joined together loving one
[54:55] another being purchased by the blood of
[54:58] the Lamb
[54:59] joined together of Believers in this
[55:03] area for whatever reason that God has
[55:07] brought us together uh we've all heard
[55:10] the eagle cry
[55:13] we've heard the scream of Malachi 4 5
[55:16] and Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7. we
[55:20] we know that it's true we've been
[55:23] attracted to it I didn't call you he
[55:27] called you
[55:29] the the thing that attracted you to the
[55:32] voice was something that he put in you
[55:35] to hear it
[55:36] and so we come together
[55:40] with a common purpose
[55:44] with a common goal you say what is that
[55:48] goal well that goal is to
[55:51] worship Him
[55:55] to to
[55:59] acknowledge Him to spend time with him
[56:03] to hear from him to hear what he has to
[56:08] say to put ourselves aside and give him
[56:12] preeminence
[56:15] so that's what we're doing
[56:17] we're taking a scripture
[56:20] a word
[56:22] that if we'll gather together he'll be
[56:25] there
[56:26] and we're going to latch on to that
[56:31] right
[56:33] so I'm expecting
[56:37] because now the Webster says and I like
[56:40] it expectation is a strong belief
[56:46] that something will happen
[56:50] or will be the case in the future
[56:56] so an expectation is my first
[57:00] expectation is that he'll be here
[57:07] and I want to I want to recognize him
[57:11] because I know he comes in mysterious
[57:14] ways
[57:16] I know his ways are Beyond finding out
[57:20] so I want to prepare my heart
[57:23] I I I want to have a strong belief that
[57:28] he is going to be here and something
[57:31] will happen
[57:34] I'm going to feel the effect
[57:37] of his presence
[57:39] I'm going to feel the effect of his
[57:42] visitation I am going to lay my petition
[57:47] okay at his feet when I get the chance
[57:54] I don't want to be praying far away
[57:57] like we said I don't want to just send a
[58:00] prayer up on a floating letter through
[58:02] space I'm believing
[58:05] because he said so
[58:07] that he'll be here and when he's here I
[58:11] want to talk to him
[58:15] and not only do I want to talk to him
[58:18] I want him to talk to me
[58:22] now I'm an expectation I'm in strong
[58:25] belief that something will happen
[58:29] so you in order to
[58:32] you can't have expectations
[58:36] without you having a vision
[58:40] of what you're expecting
[58:45] otherwise you're walking blind
[58:49] you're not looking for anything
[58:51] in order to be expecting you've got to
[58:54] be looking you've got to be leaving so
[58:57] there's got to be a substance
[59:01] or a reality or something that you're
[59:06] expecting
[59:09] like the woman that touched the Hem of
[59:12] His Garment
[59:13] she was in expectation and strong belief
[59:17] that something will happen
[59:20] when she touched the Hem of His Garment
[59:24] so she had to know
[59:27] what she was expecting to happen before
[59:31] it could be a strong belief
[59:37] now we have some electricians in here
[59:39] they have a pretty good idea if you
[59:42] stand in a wet puddle and concrete
[59:45] Barefoot and you such a hot wire
[59:48] that you're going to get a tremendous
[59:50] religious sensation
[59:57] they know it's going to happen
[1:00:00] that I mean it's so much so is the
[1:00:04] expectation of that happening
[1:00:07] that they make Provisions not to get
[1:00:11] into that spot
[1:00:13] well if you could have expectations to
[1:00:17] the negative how much more is it to have
[1:00:20] expectations to the positive
[1:00:25] look I'm going into this
[1:00:28] knowing that he said he would be here
[1:00:31] now he's going to hide himself
[1:00:36] because he hides himself in Simplicity
[1:00:39] how many know he hides himself he hides
[1:00:42] himself from what the eyes of the white
[1:00:44] and prudent and reveals to himself to
[1:00:48] them such as would learn
[1:00:52] such as would ask and desire look he's
[1:00:56] going to be here I know I've got thus
[1:00:59] saith the Lord
[1:01:02] his word is thus saith the Lord is that
[1:01:04] right I'm not prophesying I'm just
[1:01:07] saying he said God said that settles it
[1:01:10] he said if two or three people gathered
[1:01:12] together in my name I'll be there well
[1:01:14] people always miss them
[1:01:19] so can you if if if you're you're you're
[1:01:23] coming into something you've got to be
[1:01:27] in uh you've got to have a uh you've got
[1:01:31] to be in strong of expectation but
[1:01:34] you've got to know what you're expecting
[1:01:38] else it is an expectation
[1:01:41] it's wait and see
[1:01:44] I'm just going to go there and see what
[1:01:46] happens
[1:01:48] well you may see it and you may not
[1:01:52] it may it may slip you by
[1:01:56] but if you're if you're looking for him
[1:02:00] and you've you've got a reason
[1:02:05] you see the expectation is a reason not
[1:02:09] reasoning but a purpose now I have a
[1:02:13] purpose in my heart that I I want to
[1:02:16] recognize his presence I have a purpose
[1:02:19] in the heart I want I want to get myself
[1:02:22] out of the way I want to touch from him
[1:02:24] I want to restore my fellowship with him
[1:02:27] I want to restore my communion with him
[1:02:30] I want it back in my life I want
[1:02:33] leadership back in my life a lot of us
[1:02:36] believe them but we just haven't made
[1:02:38] contact with leadership do you know one
[1:02:40] of the last messages brother Brandon
[1:02:42] preached to the church was leadership
[1:02:47] he needs to come back and take
[1:02:49] leadership of our life
[1:02:53] maybe you don't have them leading your
[1:02:55] life we're not condemning somebody
[1:02:58] but we're providing the opportunity
[1:03:03] by
[1:03:05] performing
[1:03:08] and relying on his word
[1:03:12] that he'll be here
[1:03:14] because so when you when you have a
[1:03:18] vision program said it's like a person
[1:03:19] that's ill
[1:03:21] they they're never going to be healed if
[1:03:24] they don't have an expectation of a
[1:03:27] healing
[1:03:30] because they look they know they're
[1:03:32] healed
[1:03:34] that's what they're looking for he's a
[1:03:36] Healer when she reached and touched the
[1:03:39] Hem of His Garment she had a bloody
[1:03:41] shield and she knew and she touched the
[1:03:44] Hem of that garment her expectation was
[1:03:47] that that would come to an end
[1:03:51] all she had to do is touch it
[1:03:55] so
[1:03:57] she already had an Evidence
[1:04:01] she knew I'm in it
[1:04:04] touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:04:08] people don't
[1:04:10] try to touch him anymore
[1:04:14] we used to sing that song Touching Jesus
[1:04:17] is all that really matters
[1:04:20] the the church world
[1:04:24] and the way Satan's presenting himself
[1:04:27] nowadays is he's trying to always make
[1:04:30] the believer and the church member and
[1:04:33] observer
[1:04:36] and then they put on a show
[1:04:43] I mean you go to church now that they
[1:04:45] got light shows and they've got guitar
[1:04:47] players and they've got singers and
[1:04:50] they've got a dramatic
[1:04:54] a speaking and no you say why do you
[1:04:59] have a speaker
[1:05:00] because faith comes by what
[1:05:03] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:05:06] so how does it work the the preacher
[1:05:10] don't pack the Revival I don't talk to
[1:05:12] them
[1:05:15] I don't say no this is what I want you
[1:05:18] to preach on you know I mean you you I I
[1:05:22] got this
[1:05:24] right here you know what I mean I want
[1:05:27] you to cover O Brother Trey you know he
[1:05:30] doesn't he doesn't do that I want you to
[1:05:32] cover oh brother Frank you know and then
[1:05:36] oh there's sister Susie Q
[1:05:39] you know what I mean boy she's got a
[1:05:41] long tongue
[1:05:45] we don't do that
[1:05:47] we we're expect
[1:05:48] Lord
[1:05:50] to speak to the preacher put something
[1:05:53] on his heart now Keith comes in and he
[1:05:57] just starts preaching what's on his
[1:06:00] heart why is he doing that because he
[1:06:03] wants to put the word out there because
[1:06:06] he wants us to be looking for something
[1:06:10] that we can latch onto
[1:06:15] that's for me that's the word that's
[1:06:18] your promise
[1:06:20] now I've got something I can hold to I
[1:06:23] can be an expectation
[1:06:27] I can expect something to happen because
[1:06:30] you spoke to my heart
[1:06:34] and the spirit of God the Holy Spirit
[1:06:38] which is the spirit of Jesus Christ in
[1:06:41] not in physical form but it's Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ in spirit form himself his person
[1:06:47] his personality his nature his
[1:06:51] attributes walking in our midst in a
[1:06:54] spiritual realm anointing and blessing
[1:06:57] and quickening and talking to his
[1:07:00] children
[1:07:04] I want to recognize that
[1:07:10] I'd rather recognize it by Revelation
[1:07:13] than Feel It by emotion
[1:07:20] so you can sit right back you can say
[1:07:22] he's going to speak to me
[1:07:25] so now to the work
[1:07:27] now now you've got
[1:07:30] you've got two witnesses
[1:07:33] your expectation
[1:07:37] and him
[1:07:39] speaking
[1:07:40] and giving you something to hold on to
[1:07:46] preaching is an education
[1:07:51] preaching is him
[1:07:54] making himself
[1:07:56] available
[1:07:58] to you
[1:08:02] that's what this meeting is
[1:08:05] it's us getting together
[1:08:10] providing an opportunity
[1:08:12] and inviting Jesus into our midst and
[1:08:15] and he wants to come
[1:08:20] he loves you
[1:08:22] he's happy when
[1:08:25] you're invited
[1:08:27] and you invite him
[1:08:30] and you're expecting you can't you get
[1:08:32] anticipation
[1:08:34] of of seeing him of him touching you
[1:08:38] because you getting something that you
[1:08:40] desire
[1:08:42] you say
[1:08:43] what should I
[1:08:46] he said the desire of your heart
[1:08:49] so when you have expectation that you
[1:08:52] you you see yourself on the other side
[1:08:56] of the circumstance
[1:09:00] that's what you're expecting I'm
[1:09:01] expecting that
[1:09:04] these questions or this empty spot in my
[1:09:09] heart or this
[1:09:11] this feeling of being distanced okay I
[1:09:16] I'm expecting that that the insecurity
[1:09:20] that I have and and my past and and I
[1:09:25] hope that you got that message that we
[1:09:29] felt the Lord put on our heart uh close
[1:09:32] the book
[1:09:34] that was him talking to you
[1:09:36] he knew he was going to come he knew
[1:09:38] there was a meeting down the road he
[1:09:41] knew he didn't want your past to hinder
[1:09:44] you
[1:09:44] he he wants to give you a fresh
[1:09:47] invitation just sit down with him and
[1:09:50] fellowship with him and talk with him
[1:09:52] and get close to him and have your own
[1:09:54] personal experience with his spirit
[1:09:58] that's the Holy Spirit you get that
[1:10:01] spirit in you the same spirit that
[1:10:03] quickened Jesus Christ will Quicken your
[1:10:06] mortal body
[1:10:07] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:10:11] he'll be here
[1:10:13] Jesus will be here in spirit form
[1:10:17] the holy spirit will be here
[1:10:21] that's a promise
[1:10:23] now you've got to have an expectation
[1:10:28] of what
[1:10:30] will happen to you
[1:10:33] when you come in to his presence
[1:10:41] what would you expect
[1:10:46] well you know sometimes
[1:10:49] a real good conviction of sin is a good
[1:10:53] thing
[1:10:56] when all the little stuff the little
[1:10:58] foxes that are spoiling the vine the
[1:11:01] little weaknesses in everything just
[1:11:03] rise to the surface
[1:11:06] then they're on the table
[1:11:08] you don't feel like they're they're hid
[1:11:11] anymore you don't feel like like every
[1:11:14] time you talk with him you got this
[1:11:16] thing bugging you
[1:11:18] you know I mean it's all on the table
[1:11:20] you and him it's all out there hip he
[1:11:23] brings it out there
[1:11:25] He he'll reach down and then deal with
[1:11:28] you and pull it out and and say so he'll
[1:11:31] he'll say well let's get it out in the
[1:11:33] surface let's get it out front where we
[1:11:36] can talk about it and I can forgive you
[1:11:38] and I could give you the strength to
[1:11:41] overcome Hallelujah
[1:11:45] all those things
[1:11:47] can happen
[1:11:49] when you're in expectation
[1:11:51] when you're expecting something to
[1:11:54] happen because you believe that he's
[1:11:56] going to be here
[1:11:58] and you know sometimes we miss them
[1:12:01] because he comes in such small ways you
[1:12:04] know the prophet God talked about the
[1:12:06] little fish
[1:12:08] in the ocean
[1:12:11] he said that
[1:12:14] he said it's like that fish being there
[1:12:17] and all of a sudden he realizes you know
[1:12:20] that he's in this great vast ocean and
[1:12:23] he says you know what
[1:12:25] I better be real careful
[1:12:28] of how much water I drink
[1:12:32] you understand
[1:12:34] so
[1:12:36] when you recognize he's here
[1:12:41] all things are possible
[1:12:45] the trouble is is that he goes
[1:12:48] unrecognized
[1:12:50] he keeps his part of it but nobody has
[1:12:53] expectation he's going to be there
[1:12:55] nobody walks through the door expecting
[1:12:57] to see him nobody is is waiting to see
[1:13:01] him move they don't have their spiritual
[1:13:03] antennas on brother Raymond you said
[1:13:06] call put your spiritual thinking cap on
[1:13:09] they don't see him speaking to him in
[1:13:11] the word uh to maybe someone will sing a
[1:13:14] song and can and boy it's just kind of
[1:13:17] the song you had or you'll be sitting
[1:13:19] there and you'll read a scripture and
[1:13:21] the preacher will come up and read the
[1:13:22] same scripture
[1:13:25] and all that stuff goes unnoticed
[1:13:31] that that's of like the fish
[1:13:34] oh
[1:13:36] you know I better be I better be careful
[1:13:39] but our messenger taught us things that
[1:13:43] only we can we can get it
[1:13:47] because we were made to get it
[1:13:50] he said when you have a teaspoon
[1:13:54] of that ocean water
[1:13:57] you've got everything that's in the
[1:14:00] ocean in that teaspoon so Watch What
[1:14:03] Happens
[1:14:04] maybe it's a psalm
[1:14:08] and it touches your heart and you
[1:14:10] recognize us that's him
[1:14:13] don't drink sparingly
[1:14:17] start pursuing down that line start
[1:14:19] drinking down that line start pressing
[1:14:22] yourself pin there where does that
[1:14:24] channel lead where does that river lead
[1:14:27] it leads to the ocean
[1:14:30] oh yeah
[1:14:32] that's his invite
[1:14:37] that's that's him reaching out and
[1:14:40] saying I'm here
[1:14:44] oh that's when you drop everything
[1:14:48] you get in tune
[1:14:50] you start looking for him he he's he's
[1:14:53] flashed himself by you maybe in a song
[1:14:57] Maybe in the scripture maybe in
[1:15:00] something that ignates your heart look
[1:15:03] past look past the word that spoke
[1:15:08] look past the veil that it's in look
[1:15:11] past the preacher and looked at him
[1:15:16] Look Away to Jesus
[1:15:19] what do you see
[1:15:22] you start seeing them
[1:15:24] he starts to knows he's here
[1:15:26] your expectation Rises boy something's
[1:15:30] fixing to happen something's fixing to
[1:15:32] happen I I'm believing it Lord because
[1:15:36] this my night is this the time I'm going
[1:15:38] to be free from this Spirit that'll
[1:15:40] always bug me is this the time I'm going
[1:15:42] to get the courage to testify Lord I've
[1:15:45] been wanting to just tell this person
[1:15:46] I'm sorry is this the night that that
[1:15:50] you're going to deal with my heart
[1:15:54] okay and and you can you can travel a
[1:15:58] million miles
[1:15:59] in one Split Second
[1:16:02] in the presence of the Lord
[1:16:08] if you're willing to take the journey
[1:16:12] if you're if you're willing to say
[1:16:15] whatever it takes Lord
[1:16:18] I'm ready for whatever it takes I'm
[1:16:20] ready for a change
[1:16:22] I'm way I'm ready for a Revival
[1:16:25] I'm ready for a restoration came ready
[1:16:29] for a greater commitment I Lord I'd like
[1:16:32] to be endued with power
[1:16:36] power's not a bad thing power without
[1:16:39] character is a bad thing but Power with
[1:16:42] the love of Christ is Victory
[1:16:46] we've got power over the devil
[1:16:49] I think brother Billy and brother
[1:16:51] Matthew would have been laying that out
[1:16:53] there for us that expectation that a
[1:16:57] Believer can have
[1:16:59] to absolutely finally tell that devil to
[1:17:04] take a hike
[1:17:08] oh let me give you the scripture
[1:17:11] for take a hike get behind me Satan
[1:17:18] get behind me
[1:17:19] and there's don't stand in my way
[1:17:24] you've kept me from making this next
[1:17:26] step you kept me from a greater
[1:17:28] Fellowship you've kept me from
[1:17:30] expressing my love
[1:17:32] to him
[1:17:34] can you you instead of me feeding his
[1:17:37] love and rejoicing in his love and
[1:17:40] basking in his love every time he comes
[1:17:43] around all I've got is conviction
[1:17:47] wouldn't you like to rise above
[1:17:49] conviction
[1:17:51] I would
[1:17:53] I hate feeling dirty all the time
[1:17:57] you know what I mean I'm going to accept
[1:17:59] that he wouldn't have reached out to me
[1:18:05] I I think that he's got expectations of
[1:18:09] us
[1:18:12] and he wants to pour
[1:18:15] his spirit
[1:18:17] that all his expectations
[1:18:20] can come true
[1:18:22] okay so we can just see ourselves on the
[1:18:25] other side of the victory we can see
[1:18:28] when that little teaspoon
[1:18:30] of his presence
[1:18:32] drops in that a little anointed song
[1:18:35] that little bead in your heart that
[1:18:38] little tear that comes down that little
[1:18:42] holy unction that little quickening and
[1:18:46] I I don't want to misinterpret this word
[1:18:49] but but there there is a spiritual
[1:18:52] sensation
[1:18:54] not if but a spiritual your spirit is
[1:18:59] awakened
[1:19:02] and you feel something come alive in you
[1:19:05] pursue that
[1:19:07] get into the spirit
[1:19:10] invite it to come richer and deeper get
[1:19:14] lost in it start talking to him
[1:19:19] expect something to happen
[1:19:22] do you believe that
[1:19:24] no if just those of us that are here
[1:19:28] this evening
[1:19:31] we come
[1:19:33] we would create such an atmosphere that
[1:19:37] our cups would overflow
[1:19:39] and isn't that really what it were a
[1:19:42] Christian finally gets to where he's not
[1:19:44] always praying for himself
[1:19:47] he knows that God's got him
[1:19:52] he's restored his Fellowship now they're
[1:19:55] going to pray for my children
[1:19:56] can I pray for my grandchildren I'm
[1:19:59] going to pray that the Revival comes in
[1:20:01] I'm gonna whatever these clouds are that
[1:20:04] are hanging on my loved ones Lord you
[1:20:07] stood on the bow of the boat
[1:20:10] and said Peace
[1:20:12] be still
[1:20:14] and the waves calmed and the clouds went
[1:20:17] back the prophet of God stood on the
[1:20:19] mountain and rebuked this storm
[1:20:22] amen don't you think he can do that
[1:20:24] what what do you think he can do this
[1:20:27] weekend
[1:20:28] I think he can do all things
[1:20:31] kind of everything's possible
[1:20:34] but if I don't have an expectation of
[1:20:38] something
[1:20:39] I will see nothing
[1:20:46] alls I'll see is a church service
[1:20:49] alls I'll see is a good preacher alls
[1:20:52] I'll see is a great song
[1:20:54] all thou will feel is the emotion of the
[1:20:57] music
[1:20:58] but I want to rise above that don't you
[1:21:01] I I want to go and and I I'm I'm just I
[1:21:06] want to be an expectation I want to have
[1:21:10] a vision
[1:21:11] of my victory I want to have a well man
[1:21:15] not just a physical well-man but a
[1:21:19] spiritual well-being
[1:21:21] okay I want to see Christ in me
[1:21:25] the hope of glory
[1:21:29] the holy spirit is the person of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ upon the believer
[1:21:38] if you and him becoming one
[1:21:43] and all that the father hath given me
[1:21:46] will come to me all that the father hath
[1:21:49] given me I've freely given you
[1:21:53] as I freely given you you freely give
[1:21:56] you take our position
[1:21:59] as as real brothers and sisters in the
[1:22:04] Lord nothing between me and my savior
[1:22:07] pin nothing between not the preacher
[1:22:09] holding the Revival not the preacher
[1:22:12] bringing the Revival I'm bringing the
[1:22:14] Revival
[1:22:16] what's my Revival my expectation
[1:22:20] of a higher plane
[1:22:25] a greater work
[1:22:31] I want to have Works don't you
[1:22:34] show me your faith without your works
[1:22:37] I'll show you my faith by my works I
[1:22:41] want to have works that show my faith
[1:22:44] that represent and identify him in my
[1:22:49] life
[1:22:50] that's what I'm expecting
[1:22:54] I'm expecting somebody for me personally
[1:22:57] I know I Pastor a church and and all the
[1:23:01] stuff that comes with that but that's an
[1:23:04] office
[1:23:06] you understand that's a uh I don't want
[1:23:09] to use the word job because it's
[1:23:10] something I love to do with all my heart
[1:23:12] but that's something that carries its
[1:23:15] own blessing
[1:23:16] and its own trials but I'm still a
[1:23:19] Christian
[1:23:21] I'm still a brother
[1:23:23] I still am tempted and I'm still weak
[1:23:26] and I I still got failures and and I
[1:23:29] want this not to just be a meeting for
[1:23:32] me as a pastor
[1:23:34] I'm doing I'm doing the meeting for you
[1:23:36] but I'm doing it for me too
[1:23:41] I want to rise up higher
[1:23:44] I I really want the Capstone
[1:23:47] I really want the love of God
[1:23:50] shed abroad in my heart I want
[1:23:52] compassion
[1:23:54] I want pity I want long suffering I
[1:23:58] really want to be a representative of
[1:24:00] him don't you you think that this
[1:24:03] weekend that he could give a touch
[1:24:08] that would make us a better
[1:24:10] representative of him
[1:24:14] that we could put some of the things
[1:24:16] behind we could leave those things which
[1:24:18] are behind and press for a higher
[1:24:21] calling
[1:24:23] I believe it's all possible
[1:24:26] if you're a skunk he can take the stripe
[1:24:28] off your back
