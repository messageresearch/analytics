Take not thy holy spirit from me. our restore Lord the joy of thy salvation [Music] and renew a right spirit within. [Music] Let's just go before him. Heavenly Father, Lord, we know the song that David would sing, Father, is a heart's cry of every believer, Lord, to be renewed and restored in your presence, Father, to always be found in your house, Lord. We'd rather be adorment in the house of God. And Lord, there's no other place that our hearts desire is to be than to be found in your presence. And Lord, we're so thankful that you desire, Lord, to draw us unto yourself. And Lord, that you provided a way that we could come. We're approaching now, Lord, in the acceptable place in thy son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, that all of our sins being forgiven, Father, you've provided a place of worship. And Lord, in this day, you've given us a truth. And Lord, we know who you are. And you've opened our eyes that we're blinded. And Lord, we've been now gathered around the body word, a bleeding, bloody word, Father. And Lord, it's producing exactly what you sent it to produce. And we want to thank you for that, Lord. We believe it's that word that has what we have need of. That's why we've gathered here, Lord. That your word would come. It would heal our diseases. That it would shape us into your son's image, Father. And Lord, if we could be more pleasing to you. So we commit this service to you, Father, that you would do by your word what you intend to perform. Commit this service to you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. While you're standing with me, if you turn in your Bibles to the book of Revelations, we're going to take a reading out of chapter 3, very familiar for our day. In verse 17 it reads, "Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind and naked, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire, that thou mayest be rich, and with ramnant, and white remnant, that thou mayest be clothed, and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear. and anoint thine eyes with eyes that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcome, and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. Heavenly Father, as we've read your word, we ask that you would multiply it to us. Father, in your name we pray. Amen. You can be seated. Just continuing on the thought this morning. I I really uh much was en enjoyed and was blessed by the service. Uh it just as a thought to carry that forward, I want to speak on identified by desire and the fruit of desperation. So just in that reading of what we took from the lady church age I the word need I would say is also tatamount to desire. If you need something you're desiring after it. I have need of this. I need it. I desire after it. I need a drink of water. Uh whatever a lacking would be would also be associated with a desire. And what we find in in this day there's a people who would say they have no desire for anything that really that which they have need of. So there's a there's an identification by a lack of desire. Uh and we don't want to be the ones who are saying we have need of nothing. We have no desire for nothing. Our bellies are full. We are fat. There's no desperation. There's no crying for more. But we want to be the ones that are found as having the need of his righteousness that we would be clothed in white ranant that we'd receive is that we could see. And I believe that's the, if you will, the passing from death unto life is when you recognize that you've received what you have need of. &gt;&gt; So there's going to be a contrast. I believe that's the paradox really in any time is there's a point at which you pass from death unto life. &gt;&gt; But there is a you can't um equate I think it's really hard I guess just to really say it simply. You can't understand the kingdom of heaven unless you've been born again. &gt;&gt; So you would you would think that it's something that you could wrestle with intellectually, obtain carnally, but it's not something that you can do for yourself. You have to be completely dependent on him. He's the one who has to come and open your eyes. Um I I find that really the word of God has everything that we have need of. It is your identification. So when you look into the word of God as a son of God, there's a cry in your heart that that wants to produce everything that the word of God told you that it could produce. It's not going to be satisfied by anything less. So when Jesus says, "Be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect." That's going to cause a desire in your heart, a desperation, a call that requires perfection. But there's an enemy &gt;&gt; that wants to take that desire and get you to settle for anything less &gt;&gt; because that's the carnal mind. &gt;&gt; It will take the things of God and the promises of God and get give you a plan or an idea on how to achieve them. &gt;&gt; If I mean let's the book of Genesis the reason the devil hates it is it exposes him. In the very beginning, Eve had a promise. &gt;&gt; And what Satan did was come to her and propose a way for her to obtain the promise &gt;&gt; that was not God's provided way. &gt;&gt; And that t that tactic has not changed. &gt;&gt; It's still the same. Man wants something to do with it. in even in our own abilities we are going to be faced with that uh if you will tendency &gt;&gt; in and of ourselves we look for at first first thing is what can I do about it &gt;&gt; what can I do &gt;&gt; and that's kind of the paradox is we can do nothing &gt;&gt; you know the uh the thing that we recognize is that there and I want to clarify something there's a difference between desire and temptation. Okay? When you've been born again, the very heart desire in you has been changed. You your you your your heart is now set upon the heavenly. &gt;&gt; You can now say that the things I used to desire after I count as dung. They no longer mean anything to me. But I can still be tempted. But temptation is from without. I can definitely recognize that it's no longer in my heart to do those things. So you have to discern that which is without and that which is within. If it's not that with is without that defileleth a man, but that which is within. &gt;&gt; So you in probing and seeking out your own salvation with fear and trembling has to discern what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; So I'm speaking on being identified by your desire. So you find it within yourself a nature, a law that when you would do good, evil is present with you. &gt;&gt; But there's a seed gene of God in you that desires the things of God, that desires something further in the kingdom of heaven. Jesus would even pray on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; And even in our reading, Jesus said, "As I have overcome and is set in my father's throne, it is given to you to overcome." It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I do not believe that there was nothing. I I I don't believe that Jesus Christ fell to anything. &gt;&gt; Okay? I want to establish that right now. Jesus Christ did not live a partial victory. He didn't come to show that we could only go so far in this flesh. &gt;&gt; He didn't come to, you know, to say you're going to always going to have to cope. But I'm crucified with him at Calvary and I've resurrected with him &gt;&gt; now. The life that I live, I now live by the blood of Jesus Christ, by the life of Jesus Christ. I'm not uh living the life of David McGee. Now, that's a paradox &gt;&gt; because that the guy who seems to wake up in the morning, &gt;&gt; okay? And you see that and I see that. But I'm here to declare when heavens and earth pass away, the real me is going to be here. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be the faults. It ain't going to be the failures. It ain't going to be the doubting. It ain't going to be anything less than the word of God. &gt;&gt; And it is the word of God that has been swn in us. You know the uh the end time believer is given to manifest the fullness. &gt;&gt; So you you got to embrace that desperation. You have to understand that that travail is intended for a purpose. We have to be sincere. &gt;&gt; We have to recognize that the desperation to manifest perfection is of God. &gt;&gt; It's because it's a promise. &gt;&gt; It's because it's our inheritance. And it's not necessarily going to come easy. &gt;&gt; But it's a victory. I it's it's it's what was it? It was it was a given in this day that there there would be a people that would have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. So in and uh power apart from character is satanic. So this is a common phrase. It's it's actually pretty good. It's a scriptural understanding. But knowledge is power. &gt;&gt; Okay. So God even being omnipotent, omnipresent, an attribute of power is to know all things. It's a powerful thing. So when you increase with knowledge, but you don't have the character, &gt;&gt; it becomes something where truth can be carried in unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; But there's the character of Christ that comes by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still the answer. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; It is the life of Christ that allows us to overcome. &gt;&gt; It's not just in an understanding of who we are. It's not just in an I loved it when brother Billy and brother Matthew went down the same line. There has to be a desire for connection. &gt;&gt; We are drawn to him by some a bond that's unbreakable. &gt;&gt; He desired you before the foundation of the world. You're not getting away from it. &gt;&gt; So, it's got to have its work. He's drawing you unto himself. And what has to happen is you're drawing into the presence of the sun. It's melting away everything that cannot stand in his presence. The baking out of the greenness sometimes makes you think that you're unworthy. It causes little things to be magnified. But what is he doing? He's drawing you unto himself. &gt;&gt; He's perfecting you. He's creating in you the identity. So what you're identified by is your desire. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to follow after it. &gt;&gt; You know, we would call it maybe sometimes a discipline. A lot of people they they do a discipline. We were going I you know, I try to work on my discipline. I don't have very much discipline. There's people who have professions that it requires a discipline. they're disciplined in it, especially with around the things of sports or anything that's a of a of a natural ability. It it it becomes a discipline that encompasses all aspects of your life, diet, you know, they got regiments and it becomes a very much a discipline and something that shows where your desire is at because you're pursuing after a goal. And the reason we took the scripture reading we did is it's given to us to sit with him in his throne. &gt;&gt; We have to keep the goal in mind. &gt;&gt; What is it going to take to sit with him in his throne? &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; It has to be character fit to rule. &gt;&gt; That's the prize that's set before us. So we should we should understand that it through this world that in the time that we're here God is going to be perfecting us. Just to read as it to grab an inspiration Matthew chapter 6 verses 9 through 12 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us as our de our debts as we forgive our debtors. As we said, the the very proclamation of what we should be praying for is the manifestation on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we can catch the heavenly vision, &gt;&gt; if we can understand what's there, then we have the right to cast down the things that are here. And I I'll ask you this. How do I know the kingdom of heaven? I know because it's within me. &gt;&gt; I have no doubt to that which I've obtained. I've been I've been touched by his fire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know whom I believed in. I've encountered God. I'm not questioning anymore if God's real. And I know that he identified me as a son. And that experience is for everybody. &gt;&gt; It was not David McGary Jr. that was worthy to come into his presence, but he sought me out &gt;&gt; and he touched me. And he marked me and he identified himself with me. &gt;&gt; Oh saints, it becomes such a reality to me. The identity he took in my shame &gt;&gt; in all my failure. He identified himself with me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When he hung there on the cross, he took all my shame. &gt;&gt; Before I could be identified with him, &gt;&gt; he identified himself with me. Yes. &gt;&gt; When that becomes a reality, &gt;&gt; it per it generates a love in your life for him &gt;&gt; that doesn't want to do anything that would bring a reproach to him putting his name on you &gt;&gt; and I so many times fell. But that should be the love response for what he did for you is God, hold me by your mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; I'm no better than anyone. &gt;&gt; Unless you keep me, I'll fall. &gt;&gt; I don't you there's a there's too many vessels of dishonor, Lord. &gt;&gt; By your grace, raise me up, Father. &gt;&gt; We don't We don't need any more vessels of dishonor. &gt;&gt; We need real vessels &gt;&gt; to his glory. You know the the thing that we are is it's it's spoken of in Romans 8 verse 9 is the text that even brother Ben was taking. But ye are not in the flesh &gt;&gt; but in the spirit. &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Everything that we are, everything that we are is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it is the spirit of God that dwells in us. &gt;&gt; And everything contrary to that we cast down. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We do not accept anything less than Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. So I tell you that what is in you &gt;&gt; is the same life that was in Jesus Christ. Not a partial victory, &gt;&gt; but you have the right to every victory he possessed. &gt;&gt; Every victory. Not a partial victory. &gt;&gt; It was a victory that allowed him to lay his life down and raise it up again. There has to be a desperation to possess all the things that God has for us. God has put the thirst there to to draw us to the place that the supernatural transpires. If you have not had your soul changed, if you and maybe that's a brought to life to be quickened to have a revelation of really what your soul possesses, &gt;&gt; it takes the quickening power of God to do so. The way God works in the is simply faith cometh by hearing. Hearing by the word of God there by looking at our example of Christ Jesus. It should cause us to say that's what I want to be. That's the image that's set before me. I'm desiring after it. I want to be like Jesus. And that's the very thing that should be living in our brothers and sisters around us. &gt;&gt; I want my life to be salty. Just to take a a in this presuming preaching 620117 starting uh 3:19. So it's the life that counts. It's by the fruit you're known. If you see that you're it isn't tallying up. Would you like to be a real Christian? And now I want you with your heads, eyes closed, and praying. If you will, I want you to be real honest. Now, just now, be real honest. Sin cannot be covered by drinking, by casting it aside, by joining a church, by trying to do better. Sin can only be killed by the power of God, the blood of Jesus Christ. Wouldn't you want a life like that if you would? and you're you believe God is in the building. His never-failing presence is always near, no matter where you are. A vision the other morning told me that he said, "Do not fear. Stand up boldly." See, because the neverfelling presence of Christ is near. Would you want to be that type of a Christian? Like you really know you should be. You're really trying to be, but you haven't reached that place yet. Now your own life proves it. Raise up your hands to God. God bless you. That's honest, sincere hearts. I really want to be. Now, if you have, you know, your life that you're tallying up what a Christian is required to do, then even now in the presence of the Holy Spirit, Satan makes you keep your hand down, won't receive it. Now, what about that? When you know you're right here with the scriptures that you're wrong, I say that in love. What a horrible thing that it is. see that you would know that. I don't say that you are, but I say if you would know it and know that your life, look at what you do and the things that you're acting in your life doesn't compare to the Bible and you hear the gospel is preached and you read it yourself and you know it's wrong to do these things and yet you do it. Isn't that horrible? Now at least 20 30 hands up went out. Would you like now? Don't nobody look. Just let me look. I want to pray. Some was left out. We'd put your hand. I will see you in the balcony. Yes. God bless you. There's plenty more. God, it really sincere. Why don't we settle it tonight? Just why not just say tonight, let's settle it. Now, come in among you out here at Phoenix, the lovely place. Appreciate you so much. Letters, write, encouragement, things. Try encourage me and pray for me. And the reason I got I want to sincere Christ going to make an answer for this. Sorry, just getting to this. I don't tell you all the truth. Then see, I'm going to have to answer. And what's the reason? I want I want you to be there, brother, sister. Don't take a chance. The slightest chance. Don't take it. Don't just play with it. We don't Let's be real. Real Christians. You can be, too. You know a certain lady that you'd like to be like, a certain man you'd like to be like, a certain minister you'd like to be like, a certain person you want to be that way, you can be, let's believe it with all our hearts. There has to be an example lived out and waved out over the people. &gt;&gt; You know what is it? what it when you recognize potential, when you recognize something that could be obtained. And I trust that in our day, we know what can be obtained. We've had a sheathwave offering, a a a speak to the storm ministry, a create the squirrels, a son of God coming into position and authority. We have example lived before us that we can desire after that we could say, "Lord, as you as he followed Christ, I want all of it. I want all of it for me in this day." A a child does that tendency quite easy. &gt;&gt; We could even do it naively. When we see someone else has the ability to do it, competitive nature tells us there's potential for me to do it. &gt;&gt; There should be a godly attribute that in us says that's for me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to pursue after. I want that. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let anybody sell you short. It is not for me to say to quench your thirst. &gt;&gt; It is not for me. You've got it, brother. You've arrived. If God's calling you further, go further. &gt;&gt; There's more for you to have. &gt;&gt; We are fools to compare ourselves one to another. &gt;&gt; The only thing that you're responsible for is he calls and leads you, you follow after it. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. &gt;&gt; If he's put a desire in there for more, there's more for you to have. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not my measure of spirituality that you need to achieve. &gt;&gt; Now, if I'm leading and I'm an example, praise God. But, you know, let's pray frogger a little bit. You get out ahead and then I'll and I'll catch up. &gt;&gt; But let let's charge. &gt;&gt; Let's go find all the promises he has for us. Let's lift one another up. Let's be the examples. Let's say we can do this, brother. I've got the victory. &gt;&gt; Not You know, &gt;&gt; we're flawed. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. &gt;&gt; You know, I I victim mentality &gt;&gt; is not what we have in this day. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Away with it. &gt;&gt; We're not just all the broken sistns, &gt;&gt; the wounded vessels, wounded warriors for Jesus. That's not what our claim is. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord God that health all my diseases. When I was lost and undone, he found me. Now that I've tasted of the heavenly, I got something to give. Let me tell you, the one who heals a broken heart that can take you from nothing and and bring you up. There is no place that my God can't bring you from. &gt;&gt; You may think you're lost and he doesn't know where you're at. He knows exactly where you're at. The love of Jesus Christ is the greatest power this world has ever known. &gt;&gt; And if you I I believe that if you could but taste it. &gt;&gt; Whatever you think is too great becomes nothing. &gt;&gt; The things that I thought were unfixable one moment in his presence were gone. &gt;&gt; Gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And no man who enters into the presence of God recognizes there ain't no worthiness in you. &gt;&gt; Try to tell me that a kid who grows up on a pew doesn't have anything to repent of. &gt;&gt; You've got a righteousness that you're bringing to God. &gt;&gt; You haven't been in his presence. You show me in the scripture where anybody's encountered God and they said, "Well, that was nothing. &gt;&gt; I guess I was good." Even the rich young ruler at least had to repent of heart. &gt;&gt; You don't come into the presence of God and and think that you got it. &gt;&gt; You recognize that without him, you're lost. that he has everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; That that's the salvation that would write the verse. It was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my heart my fears relieved. &gt;&gt; How precious that hour, it's that transformation. It's the guilt. It's the sin. It's the burden that makes you the candidate for a savior. That's right. &gt;&gt; If there's no burden and there's travail, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I have need of nothing. I'm good. I understand all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; I understand the message. I know what God's done in this day. I've intellectually obtained it. And what do you become? A rich young ruler &gt;&gt; that wasn't willing to just go just to die. Whatever it is, I guarantee you he's calling you further. &gt;&gt; If it's sell all that thou hast, &gt;&gt; learn how to die. &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. &gt;&gt; Be zealous, therefore, and repent. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I don't want to leave any behind. &gt;&gt; I recognize that there's those who understand that they've passed from death into life. We're not trying to crucify Christ. Aresh. If you pass from death unto life, I understand that. But you know what it's like to repent. &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to die. &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to to have him come and be the lifegiver. &gt;&gt; But don't think there's another gospel. &gt;&gt; Like the gospel somehow changed now that we've got all the mysteries open. It's a different gospel. You just don't have anything to repent of. &gt;&gt; It's not a different gospel. Repentance is still the the ingredients hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; The formula is repent. &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. That's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. There's no uncertainty in it. &gt;&gt; There's there's no other formula. &gt;&gt; And it starts with repentance, you know, and I it takes a revelation to repent. That's right. &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation to repent. You can't come to repentance unless he reveals to you your frame. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you think it's a checklist. &gt;&gt; Well, I stole the gum from Piggly Wiggly and my mom caught me. Chick. I'm sorry, Lord. And I've been a pretty good guy otherwise. So now you can receive me and you can accept me and I have something to bring. I could really be beneficial in your kingdom. What would you like me to do? I could pass out tracks. I could probably get people. I can compel them to come in. We can do things that we and then what are you just doing? You've you've accepted the religious covering. You've become a cane. &gt;&gt; You are now approaching him through your works, through your own worthiness. You're you're approaching him through knowledge. &gt;&gt; And your approach is to die to your own understanding. It's hard to die. &gt;&gt; The travail of death. And you know what? It's from glory to glory. I'm not going to despise God's program. If I have to go through a place of desperation for him to bring me a revelation, then Lord, I want to be on your threshing floor. I want to be on the potter's will. I want to be in the place where he's molding and making my character. I don't want to despise the desperation. &gt;&gt; Whatever he sees fit in my life to bring to pass, to mold me into him, his image, to make it so I could sit in the throne. I'm going to keep the prize before me. I'm going to recognize the goal. What is he making? He's he's he's making a character to sit with him in his throne. &gt;&gt; And people may look at that process and think it's failure. &gt;&gt; But if I know the goal &gt;&gt; and I know what he's doing, &gt;&gt; then it brings a victory amidst the storm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It ain't a failure. It's a trophy. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful in his sight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the work of his hands. So many times what man has measured as failure is God's successes. &gt;&gt; What man looks at and despises is is God's trophies. Galatians chapter 1 verse 6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you under the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another. It's not another gospel. But there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel other than that which was preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I again, if any man preached unto you any other gospel that ye have received, let him be accursed. For I do now persuade, for do I now persuade men or God? Do I seek to please men? For if yet please men, I should not be a servant of Christ. But I certify to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of men, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard of me by conversation in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it. And I profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me, that I might preach among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which the apostles before me, but I went to Arabia and returned again to Damascus. This gospel that we received was the same gospel Paul preached. &gt;&gt; It wasn't received of man. It's not the product of man. And when we say the message, we don't mean something that man has done. &gt;&gt; When we say Christ, when we say the Lord Jesus Christ, there's many that bear his name that are not him, but we don't use his name profanely. We don't attribute it to things that are not him. Though we know things have gained access to it, we the son of predition is exposed. &gt;&gt; But we don't equate the things of God to the things of men. What God does is God. &gt;&gt; What man does is man. &gt;&gt; And I understand that I do the works of men in my life all the time. But the truth, as brother Billy said, stands apart. &gt;&gt; It It's not the truth because I've said it. &gt;&gt; Me, David McGary. It's the truth because it's God's word. &gt;&gt; And God is obligated to his word. &gt;&gt; If a donkey speaks it, &gt;&gt; the truth stands apart. I have no claim to it as it being my own. He's claimed me by it. &gt;&gt; The only claim I have is that he cla he put his name on me. &gt;&gt; He gave me the name. He read my name. &gt;&gt; The truth stands sovereign. &gt;&gt; So just because someone takes the truth, &gt;&gt; they have no claim to it. Don't ever uh diminish the truth because people carry it in unrighteousness. Let the let God's word be God's word. It's not man's product. It's not received of man. It's received by by revelation. And you have to seek out in your own heart with fear and trembling and make sure that it is not an intellectual understanding. I I this really can't be confused. I know there's things in my life that I'll say I intellectually understand and I believe them, but I want them to become a revelation. It's it's not wrong to believe the truth, but we want the quickening power to come with it. We want anointed word. There's an anointing in this day that's been given to us to overcome. &gt;&gt; Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. You know the the the amazing thing is there's a fruit of in of intellectual understanding and it it it's it's not that even and this this is for all of us okay because Moses the beautiful type of Moses with an intellectual understanding of who he was what his calling was what his position was with an intellectual understanding he killed a man &gt;&gt; and that's what we will do with intellectual understanding it's my idea versus your idea. I want you to say it the way I say it because it's the way I understand it. So just please say it my way and otherwise I'll kill you. Say it my way. Please just use my terminology because it's my intellectual understanding. I need you to say it my way and I will totally kill your doctrine if you don't say it my way. That's an intellectual under that's the that is a mark of an intellectual understanding. And let's just go around this 50 more times so we can all adopt the same phraseology because we I got to grab it this way. So intellectual understanding will kill a man, &gt;&gt; but a revelation will say, "Come see a man. &gt;&gt; I found a man who could tell me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I can see where you're coming from, brother. &gt;&gt; I understand what you're saying. I may not say it the exact same way, but I know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; I have enough grace to see what you're you're looking at the mountain from that side, aren't you? &gt;&gt; Oh, he's he's a non He's an unfelling God. His mercy is great. &gt;&gt; You could fellowship around a revelation. &gt;&gt; There's some virtue to give. &gt;&gt; There's a life and a saltiness that could be poured out. So God grant me more revelation. &gt;&gt; Open your word to me, Father. We, you know, there's an identity that we have by our desire. There should be an example that's set before us. I I think of the story that Brother Brandham told of the boy that was walking in his father's footsteps and and when he looked back, he was like, "What are you doing? I'm following after you, Dad. I'm doing what you're doing. &gt;&gt; There's there there's somebody's footsteps that you are following in. We have to understand we are sheep. &gt;&gt; We are sheep. &gt;&gt; It's it's not negotiable. &gt;&gt; You are following something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A a discipline, uh something. &gt;&gt; We've been made that way. &gt;&gt; We're sheep. If you can understand influence, one of the first things when I became born again, oh my goodness, when I started to see that there was a voice behind everything, when I started to see that there was influence and my spiritual understanding became opened and I realized that things were voices and things were being declared out and crying out and they're w wanting to press their way in and find influence and identity in you. And you see those things being identified in people. Identity, desire being manifested. What is inside of you is declaring itself because you've followed after something. &gt;&gt; And if no one else sees it, he does &gt;&gt; for the good, too. &gt;&gt; He knows your heart. He knows what you're desiring after. This is uh as the eagle stirs her nest in 6101. No 166. No sir, Papa Eagle. They look just like him. They believe the same thing he does. They look like him. Yes, sir. They're made like him. They are built like him. And he knows they're genuine eagles. Oh my. That's what God wants. A genuine Messiah. He is Messiah. Messiah the anointed one. And we are his children which have a lesser anointing. So we're as Jehovah eagle is the great eagle and we're his eaglets. He's Messiah and we were the same anointing as Messiah. Amen. Anointed Messiah means the anointed one. Are you anointed? Amen. What with the same spirit that he was anointed with. We have it in measure. He was without measure. He was God manifested in the flesh and were sons of God part of him. Come off. Yes sir. The very works that I do, ye shall do also. I might take a spoonful of water out of the ocean out here and you would never miss it out of the ocean. That's the way we would be missed if we were happening to drop out. But remember, the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean is in that spoon. Same water. That's just more of it out there. So that's what it is. Oh, you say, "What is it out there?" Ocean water. What's here? Ocean water. Just exactly. That's the way Papa Eagle thinks about his little ones. Hallelujah. How's he strutting around? He will scream at them and they'll scream back. &gt;&gt; That's it. I am he that was. Amen, Papa. I am he that is. Amen, Papa. I am he that is to come. Amen, Papa. I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen, Papa. I'm still the healer. Amen, Papa. I give the Holy Ghost. Amen. Papa little old crow. You got a little loud. Don't make me to you at all. Different reaction. You little buzzard. What you hollering about? Get out of the nest. Little vulture. You couldn't eat eagle food anyhow. That's right. Amen. Why we worried? what the what the world thinks. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what anybody you get the victory. There's always going to be somebody over there think, "Oh, he got a little emotional, got a little in the flesh. They just never got a whole that never mind." I pray God you lose it. It I love it. Brother Brandham tells a story. It's It's God has a sense of humor. sister was dancing in the aisle and he thought it just might be a little out of order. He ended up down there dancing, too. &gt;&gt; You can go look that up. &gt;&gt; I You know what? I hope the people are really good critics are really good at looking up quotes. you. If no one knows how to use the message app by now, come see me. All right. 171. Thank you. I was going to skip ahead. You little buzzard. What you hollering about? Get out of the nest, little vulture. You couldn't eat eagle food anyhow. That's right. Oh my. Then first thing you know, he finds out that they're fine little eagles. He walks around. The first thing you know, mama is determined that her that her little eagles ain't going to be like an earthbound chicken. They ain't going to be walking on all the time going to give them a few trials to see how they come out. Every son that cometh to God must be chasened, tried. That's so important, saints. I you can, you know, we're talking about finding your identity in the scripture. You go through the scripture, there's a Hannah, there's a Rachel, there's a it's not fit to give the the bread to to dogs. There's always some resistance. &gt;&gt; But what comes out is the character and the nature that Christ wants to see. He knows what's in there. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he planted and he knows it will overcome. That's right. &gt;&gt; He He is not doubting the gene he put in you &gt;&gt; one bit. &gt;&gt; It's the very life of Christ in earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; It's overcoming power. &gt;&gt; But he's got to kill the shuck. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a little bit of chastening, a little bit of trying, a little bit of baking. And when they back up, say, "No, I ought." Oh, why? You wasn't a son to begin with. If you cannot stand the chastisement, then the Bible said you become a bastard child and not a son of God. So that's the way you pull them out. Like a man went forth. He said the kingdom of God throwed a net into the sea. And when he draw it out, there was tapens, crawfish, lizards, and everything else. Pulled them out onto the bank. That's the preacher's job. We don't know what is which. Some of them is fish, some of them as lizards, some of them snakes, and some of them crawfish. Watch the old crawfish when he's there. Somebody say, "Glory, hallelujah. Praise the Lord." Sayump. You know, I should play that part. Blump blump blump. I can't believe that. Right back to the water he goes. You know, just I don't know if you've ever seen a little mud bug skitter backwards. Don't want no part of it. Bloom bloom. Back to the water he goes. The old snake just slick stick his head up. I thought I was in church. We're all supposed to be refined, civilized people in here. I thought I was in church. You know, they'd be more comfortable if you're hollering at the ball game. might put it on the television and go in their own house. They just love it. But no, ain't no place for that in church, huh? The old snake just stick his head up, say, "I thought I was in church, but it's holy rollers." Here he goes. What was he? A snake to begin with. A crawfish to begin with. Old lady spider. Plunky plunk. Right back to the mud hole again. Right back out with the shorts on cutting her hair. Right. As long as it goes to the as a hog goes to its wallow, the dog to his vomit. There you are. Don't get mad. Just sit still. When I was a little kid, we lived up in Kentucky and I had a hard time living. Mama used to take out the corn pone and I don't know whether you know what that is or not. black eyed peas and turnip greens and she would make an old corn pone. We we don't have any large. She would render out meat with skins and when she would make that that grease that shortening for the corn and bread out there and then meat skins that's pretty rough. I mean I I skinned a hide. I couldn't imagine boiling a hide down to get the fat off the skin. That'd be one of the more gamey tasting things. I I don't know if anybody still does that, but that's hard living right there. And she would render out the meat skins and when she would make that the grease, the shortening out of the cornbread out of them meat skins. And you know, it was kind of bad living. So every Saturday night we all used to have to take a big bath and had a big old cedar tub and when they poured the water in to get hot and that was nine of us. And so all of them would take a bath. You never change the water. Just add some more hot water. It was the last one. Had to take my own boy. I had to bath. All right. But then the thing is that after it to get ready for school Sunday, now that was on the Saturday night and the Sunday we would all take a good round of castor oil on account of that way we had to eat. I got so sick I would hold my nose and just gag. Said, "Mama, I can't even stand this stuff. I can't." She said, "Honey, it don't make you sick, it don't do you any good." That's the way the gospel is. If it don't get your spiritual gastronomics all stirred up, make you real sick, you won't go digging, and find out where it's right or not. Don't despise the chastening of the Lord. Recognize he's doing it for a purpose. He's the answer. Hold on. In the name of the Lord, I tell you, hold on. &gt;&gt; It's worth it all. &gt;&gt; When your faith is re, you will come forth. &gt;&gt; No person crosses a desert unless they know there's something on the other side. &gt;&gt; You hang on for the answer. &gt;&gt; There's an answer. You may You may be all sick. You may be all tore up. There may be desperation. There may be anxiety. There may be all this turmoil. And you don't know. You feel like you're at your wits end. Hold on. &gt;&gt; Christ is the answer. Don't settle for anything less. &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not here for a feel-good gospel. &gt;&gt; We We got a leaving message. We got a goal, &gt;&gt; God. Whatever it takes. Let my character be the right character. &gt;&gt; If I have to die a little bit, that's okay. &gt;&gt; If I If I have to give something up, it's all right. But Lord, don't don't give up on me. continue to refine me. It's got to make you dig. There has to be a desperation. Just to draw on an example, I'm going to turn to Samuel. 1 Samuel Chapter one. I'm not going to try to unpack all of this. I pray the Lord will do that for you. So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the post of the temple of the Lord. And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore. And she vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord of host, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmmaid, and remember me and not forgive thine handmmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmade a manchild, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall not raise or come upon his head." And it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah, she spake in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said unto her, "How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee." Many times right at that moment, a lot of us would have the wrong response. Well, if you were a man of God, you'd have approached me differently. But this was an opportunity. And Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord, not who do you think you are? How dare you pick on the sisters? What do you you know just just watch the approach because what happens is there's always two reactions. There's the eagle and there's the buzzard and the word comes offensively. And what are you going to do? Are you going to repent? Are you going to have the right approach? Are you going to cover yourself with a religious spirit? &gt;&gt; Are you going to hide? We want the word of God to come right down to our address and speak to us and we want to be open. No, my Lord, I'm a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thy handmmaid for a daughter of BL, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief, I have spoken here too. Then Eli answered said, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, and thou hast asked of him." And she said, "Let thine handmmaiden find grace in thy sight." And so the woman went her way and did eat. And her countenance was no more sad. But there was a travail. There was a place where Hannah was at where her soul was bitter. Repentance has to have its work. [Music] And I believe you could be a good kid and not have done anything wrong. And when you come into the presence of a righteous God, recognize that you're lacking. &gt;&gt; There is no righteousness that we have when we come into the presence of a holy God. You may have done nothing wrong your entire life, but you can't be holy like he's holy. Even the angels are dirty before him. They never did anything wrong. to to to to relegate repentance to a checkbox so that you've never had a revelation of what it means to be born again. It's no longer your life, but the very righteousness of Jesus Christ in you &gt;&gt; who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect. &gt;&gt; It's the life of Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to know that you know that you know that you know And you don't need to dig it up. But if you know that your you're identified by desire, if your desire has truly changed, if your heart has been set on fire, if you want to express the heavenly image, if you've heard from your theophony, if you have a a prize, if you have a goal, if you're if you're selling all, you know what? I have nothing else. &gt;&gt; You want to tell me that the church of Pentecost isn't alive and well? I know there's people sitting in this building right now who will tell you they have nothing else but this message. They've sold it all out. There's nothing else that means anything to them. The message means everything. &gt;&gt; It's all that they have. I I can tell you it's all that I've got. &gt;&gt; I It doesn't need to be stripped away to prove it. I know that when it all comes down to it, it's all that I got. Don't take this message and relegate it to anything else than the grace of God to bring us up into the heavenly to give us complete and total victory. &gt;&gt; It's not the work of man. It wasn't made to to create theology and and it's meant for you to possess complete victory. You could be as he was, victorious, &gt;&gt; possessors of all things. You can enjoy the the neverfelling presence of Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's with you wherever you go. &gt;&gt; And the gates of hell can't prevail against that. Satan cannot take him from you. &gt;&gt; He's here &gt;&gt; in your darkest hour. He's there. in your darkest hour. &gt;&gt; He was there &gt;&gt; looking over his son. &gt;&gt; He would tell Satan, "No more. &gt;&gt; You can't go that far. &gt;&gt; You can't take him." &gt;&gt; There's many of us have walked up to that line and God said, "No." &gt;&gt; Mercy said, "No. He's not going to let you go. &gt;&gt; You don't need to prove his love for you to walk up to that line. You just have to surrender. &gt;&gt; You just have to die. You have to be will and say, "Lord, I I know I have a lacking. I need you, Lord. I see the life lived. I don't have what it takes. But if the gospel's the same and you're the same yesterday, today, and forever, Father, then you could touch me, too. If you've touched them by the power of the Holy Ghost, you could touch me, too. &gt;&gt; If they could know you in a reality that they know they know you're real, then you could do the same for me. &gt;&gt; If you said you came to open the blinded eyes, then you haven't changed. &gt;&gt; That is who you are. &gt;&gt; You still open the blinded eyes. So, Lord, open my eyes. There's more with us than there is with them. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world. You're telling me this guy I can't lick. I can lick them. &gt;&gt; There's Give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; I'm a possessor of all things. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in me. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; There ain't another. There's not another Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You There's some that'll preach to you another Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; but there's not another. &gt;&gt; It's a victorious Christ. What did we read? As I've overcome. That's that's the script. That's our scripture. You want the goal. You want the prize. You want it set before you. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. Even as I also overcome and am set down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit is saying under the churches. Did you hear it? &gt;&gt; Hey, did you hear it? We have a promise. &gt;&gt; We have a mountain to take. &gt;&gt; It's been given to us. &gt;&gt; We could sit in his throne. &gt;&gt; We can rule with him. You know what that means? You know what that means? Oh, that I got someone on my mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got someone on my mind. When they come before me, I'm going to say grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, man. You know, I I think of I think the Gibeonites, Gideonites, you know, there's this tribe that saw the children of Israel, and they were fearful out of a godly fear. They had reverence sung to them. So, they're like, "Throw some moldy bread, put on some raggedy clothes, and they go up to the Israelites and like, I'm tired. I've come a long ways. I'm your neighborh. And uh we just wanted to make allegiance with you. Please don't kill us. We'll serve you. Now, they didn't know that these guys live next door. So, they make an allegiance with it. Okay. You know what? You look pretty raggedy. You look pretty tore up. You've obviously your bread's moldy. We can understand with our intellect exactly who you are. didn't consult God at all. Just intellectually sized him up. This was the amazing thing. God honored that oath. Matter of fact, they weren't allowed to break it. And when you look, when Joshua commands the son to stand still, when he speaks the word, it is for the sake of them. They were going to battle because all the other tribes were like, "Oh, you're gonna line yourself up with them guys. Well, we'll just come kill you." And you know who stood in their defense? The children of God. We have authority. And you want to see the power of God manifest? Stand for somebody. &gt;&gt; Stand. Do battle. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil just come in and take someone's life. Do battle. &gt;&gt; You want to speak with authority? Say, "Let it rain on my brother's crop, son. You stand still. Go take the fight to the enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't let him have your family. Don't let him have your loved ones. Don't let them have your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. The grace of God is an incredible thing. &gt;&gt; And then they found themselves to be servants to the Levites. So don't don't you know what? There's going to be those in the outer courts. There's going to be all sorts of things in the kingdom of God. But you have the opportunity to play a part in that economy. What kind of inheritance do you want? What kind of reward do you want? How many people do you want to be able to be fellowshipping with? You say, "I'm glad I got you here, man. Boy, going to miss you. Good to see you." Do you realize what it's been given to you? &gt;&gt; Does it Don't you want to thirst after that? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have the character that's fit to rule? &gt;&gt; Don't you recognize what we've been called to in this hour? No wonder all the saints from all the other ages wanted to be here. The the position of sons, &gt;&gt; adopted sons. &gt;&gt; What an inheritance we could have in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's possess all the things that God has for us. Amen. Can I try to find a place to stop here? Amen. I find this uh problem with it getting away from your notes is then you you don't know where you're in your notes. So got a lot in here. So um you know just we make a mess of things so many times when we go about things our way and our intellect. We the other day we're over at brother Thiago's and we started putting together get two cooks in the kitchen. It's not going to be the first or the last time IKEA gets mentioned in a sermon, but we got to putting together a piece of IKEA furniture. And I think they do design those things just to prove that men can follow directions because if you don't follow the directions, it don't work. cuz the way you look at it and it goes together and it goes together perfect. It fits like it was it was supposed to go there. But by the time it was over with Julia had to go and redo it all. And I asked her, you know, how did it she took a picture of it and it was complete and it looked really good. I was like, well, how bad was it? She said, I had to redo everything. said the screws that I needed that for the very end were you had already put together like the first pieces you had to take it all apart and saints when we try to do something our way &gt;&gt; he's just going to have to break it down and redo it &gt;&gt; we cannot despise the chastening of the Lord &gt;&gt; it is for a purpose and that's my encouragement to you I'm not saying that the travail is easy. And I'm not saying there isn't travail ahead, but when we know what the prize is, that's the same thing that Christ did for the prize set before him. He endured the cross. &gt;&gt; You're the prize. &gt;&gt; It is the it's with that in mind. We'd be the most miserable of all people if we didn't recognize for which we were contending. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that that I've tasted of it's worth it all. I there is nothing that this world has and can compare to the things of God. &gt;&gt; There ain't no drug. There ain't nothing that one moment in his presence. &gt;&gt; It it's greater than anything, saints. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go try to find out. &gt;&gt; That's all substitutes. &gt;&gt; And and I can testify to that. There's nothing greater than the reality of the presence of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Nothing greater. Period. &gt;&gt; And I want to live in it. I want baptism after baptism. &gt;&gt; It's what renews me. I love it when the inspiration of the Lord draws near. I love his anointing. I love his power. I love his grace. I live for that. I want to be I I want to be in it. I want to be found in his presence. I love the quickening power upon my heart. Yeah. that can make me a fanatic. You know what happens is is because people have no seed in them, they know that that leads to sensuality because it's just anointing on flesh. That's all they have to be anointed. Because without the seed of God in you, it just causes manifestation. &gt;&gt; But you know what I say, God? Bring it everything to manifestation. Bring it all to maturity. This is the this is the day of harvest. Lord, I want to be a mature Christian by your word, by your spirit. Mature me, Christ, into your image. This is in the sixth seal, paragraph uh 384. This is what it comes down to, saints, is when when the word comes, your attitude to the word. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you'll honor these people for their respects to the word and heal them for Jesus' sake. Out here in the audience, Lord, there's sitting a people just like it was who for ge who listened to the apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost, how he went back to the word and got the word. I like that. This is uh 630323 paragraph 384. How he went back to the word and got the word and he said Joel said in the last days these days will take place and this is that and 3,000 believed it and were baptized. And father, today we stand here by your grace. And it's not because that it's a special people, but it's because just like in the days of the lion or the ox or the man, it's eagle time. It's the anointing of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's the time that we're living in. It's the work of the Holy Spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead. It's an anointing that is here to prove that anointing just as David was anointed, just as anybody was anointed. If you understand the church ages, the had the anointing of the ox and martyrdom and the wisdom of man. This is the eagle hour. There is an an eagle anointing. You want to be found under the influence and the anointing for your day. because you could be found being distracted &gt;&gt; and being trapped and being laboring in another field. And that that's a lot of what's going on. But you want to be in the channel of what God's doing in this day under the anointing that he has for you. It's it anointing matters. It's the time that we're living in. It's the work of the Holy Spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead. The things that he said that he would do just before the evening light were out. Here we've seen him do that right down along the road. We seen it come down the scientific research and his picture taken the great pillar of fire and that led the children of Israel who met Paul on the road. This is the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; This is the picture that he's referring to. And we know the same pillar of fire that led Moses down there in the wilderness. By that same pillar of fire, he wrote several books of the Bible. For he was anointed with the word. The same pillar of fire coming upon Paul on the road to Damascus, he wrote many books of the Bible called the word of God. And now Lord, the same pillar of fire by the evidence of the proof of the word and by the scientific research that we see it revealing the word of the Lord. God let the people quickly awaken Lord quickly those who have the name put on the book of life when the flashes across their path may they see. Let the little ill-famed woman all the way well that day she recognized quickly and she knew it was the scripture. And now, Father, I pray that all that will receive you at this time in their hearts will settle it forever at this hour and they'll finish with sin and with and will arise and make preparation now for public confession of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins to show that they believe that God has forgiven them and they take on the name of Jesus Christ. Then, Father, pour down the Holy Spirit of oil upon them, that they might be placed into the service of the Lord God, that they might be workers in this last evil day. For we realize we have just a short time, and the church might go at any time. The lamb might at any time leave the sanctuary up there, the throne of sacrifice, come from the throne of God, but the sacrifice lays over there. No more hopes of the world. She's finished. And she goes into frustrations and great spasms, earthquakes, and the great things shaking and the resurrection and the and Christ rose from the grave when the saints rise and the same thing will take place. Lord, could it be any minute? We're watching that glad day to arrive. Take your children under your own, Father. Draw your little lambs to your bosom, grant it, and feed them on the word till they strengthen for service. We commit them to you now. Lord, answer this prayer. Saints, the desperation of the hour has got to become real. &gt;&gt; At any time, this thing could wrap up. The sincerity and the desperation that we want to be identified with is the fruit of that desperation. The fruit of recognizing just like it would be a Rahab, get them in. We want to get all those in that could be saved. The hours late, we're marked by the fruit of our lives, by the desperation, by the desire that we have, by where we stored up our treasures, where our hearts at. The things that we declare, by the very things that we do speak louder than our words. &gt;&gt; And Lord, help me live a life worthy of this gospel. the musicians would come. You know, sometimes it may feel that what you're doing is your own effort. You may feel like you're dragging your flesh to church. You may feel like it's almost completely a carnal act. But I want to encourage you that if you're doing it according to the word of God, that's the supernatural element. That's the supernatural element. &gt;&gt; By possessing the word of God, you are possessing the supernatural. And by you acting on it despite everything else, that's supernatural. When you put God's word first and you put it into action, when the devil knows that there's been nothing else given to you but the word, that's supernatural. You're a supernatural people. You're the people of the book. When you have the word in your possession and you act upon it, that faith in the word that'll produce what God sent it to is pleasing to God. So while there's a power and while there's anointing and while there's spirit, there's nothing more supernatural than a son of God by the hands of faith taking the word of God and doing battle &gt;&gt; because you know in whom you've believed. And the hands of faith that a son of God has are different hands. The weapons of our warfare are not flesh. They're not carnal. They tear down Satan's kingdom. Just thinking of even that, I I'd say that one of the times where I've seen one of the most supernatural things in my life, I saw the dead raised. I told the testimony a while back. And when I after that was done, I think I was so in shock, brother Billy. But I knew what he was worthy of, I stood there and I started glorifying God. And I'll tell you, I've never felt more in my flesh than in that moment when I was standing before witnesses saying, "God, you're worthy. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm going to praise you. Look what you've done." I was commanding my mind and my lips and my voice to praise him. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you one thing I wasn't going to do. I was going to be silent. Not after what I seen he done, &gt;&gt; saints. And once he's become real to you, &gt;&gt; give him what he's worthy of. You don't have to be supernaturally charged. You just have to know that he's real. &gt;&gt; And know that it's pleasing to him. Let the love of God reign in your hearts. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's just turn the service over to our brother and pray. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord, that you've made yourself real to us. And Lord, you have a grace that's sufficient for us. And Lord, we're going to have confidence in the hand that you have in our life that though it's trial, though it's travail, though it's heartache, whatever it is, Lord, that you're molding a character that's pleasing to you. Lord, we're not going to despise your chastisement, Father. Those things that would lead us to repent, Lord. We want you to have your complete and perfect work, Lord. Our confidence is in you that who's begun the work will finish it, Lord. and we don't rest in even our own ability that we can do something to make a significant change, Father. But we need you to come and be the differencemaker, Lord. Our confidence is that you're with us, that the neverfailing presence of Jesus Christ is here to perform what you've promised, Lord. And my prayer now is that we as bow our heads, Lord, that Lord, in you and your grace, as you've made yourself real to me and me being unworthy, Father, that you would also, Lord, by that same grace, open the eyes of the blind, Lord. Our commission in this calling is that the blinded eyes would be open, Lord. And that's Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And you're the confirmer of that. It's not something man can do, Lord. But we look to you in your grace and we ask that for we believe we're standing in your will and your a love for us has been declared. Satan, we give you charge to leave as you would try to blind the eyes of your God's people. You have no standing here. This is bloodbought ground. The blood that was shed on Calvary dripped upon this very earth that we're formed from. We're the purchase of Calvary and you have no ground. You have no right. Lord, we ask that the victory that you won, Lord, would be manifested. We'll be careful to give you the praise and the glory and the honor. For we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Stand and sing that tonight. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. And I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Oh, I raise my hands. I'll bow my knees and worship at your throne. Oh, and I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Just sing it again. Just sing it from your heart tonight. Oh, and I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. [Music] Oh, and I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. [Music] I raise my hands. I'll bow my knees and worship at your throne. I need you. I need to right now. Lord, I come. I confess by you. I find my way. Oh, and without you, I'll fall. Oh, and you're the one that guides my heart. Oh Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Oh, and every I need Oh, you're my one faith. Oh my rightousness. Oh God, how I need you. Oh, where seems run. Oh, your grace is more where grace is found. Hallelujah. He's grace himself tonight. Oh, and you are. Oh Lord I am free and a holy man. Oh is Christ in me. Oh Lord I need Oh [Music] my. Oh my god. Oh, and my rightest. Oh, God mighty. Sing that second verse again. Oh, and worship runs deep. Your grace is where the grace is found. [Music] That is where you are. Lord you are Lord. I am free and I'm holy. Oh is Christ in me. Oh Lord I need you. Oh my. [Music] Oh my. [Music] Oh, you're my &gt;&gt; Oh, and my tasteless. Oh, God. [Music] Hallelujah. I trust the word spoke to you tonight. You know, when you lose the hunger for something, there's nothing left. You know, you just follow through and you just basically just become a follower. But something is worth when you have the hunger for it. You know, the word is given and we see it and we don't want to be like those that grew up by the sea. We see, you know, we played in the water every day and all of the sudden the sea don't mean anything to us. The the the it's it's given to accomplish your purpose. And if we have that purpose as our goal in mind, we're going to strive until it happens. You know, you don't rest your weapon when the battle is not finished yet. You know, you you keep your weapon. You keep fighting until the battle is over. That's what a soldier does. The the enemy is full of distraction as we heard it. He will get something going on over here, you know, hey, pay attention over here. Pay all of that. He's just trying to slow your progress. He's trying to get you to a place where you remove you you you you take your eyes off the ball as he would say so you don't focus anymore so you worry about the cares of life and the things around you and everything all in a while while you are in battle. You can't do all of that. You focus on the battle and Jesus will fight everything for you. You focus on the goal ahead. He will provide everything else that we have need of. But there has to be a hunger within the heart. I mean, you go read some of the messages even after 63, the prophet is standing there says that the seal is open and all of this, but we have a hunger within our I'm like, you have a hunger. The reality of God is continual. The reality of God is every day. We we live in a time where the the enemy is so deceitful. It's not time to even pay any mind or any of your time trying to understand what the enemy is. I love what our brother said. We have been given a message and we desire for that message to become a reality. And I we don't care what the church down the street is doing, what the others are doing. And I'll even say this, I don't care what my neighbors doing. I want the word to become a reality to me. &gt;&gt; And once it's a reality to me, I want it to become a reality for you, &gt;&gt; for the other person, for the other person. You see, the problem is if you keep distracted, you won't fight for the right thing. &gt;&gt; We we want to be the light of the world. And we can't be the light unless we partake of the light. We we we we are this human being that part of us as brother will say Jesus Christ was 100% man and 100% human. We don't want to focus on the human side. We want to focus on the the the heavenly side, the God part of us and let it shine and let it possess our vessel and lead us into a place where we can actually focus and be about our father's business. You know, some part of the enemies, you know, even why the church is not full is because people have places to go. They got jobs, they got things, and they got bills, and they got And oh my, let me say this. I just want to say this with all my heart. The the enemy, he's been studying men for 6,000 years. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about man. And the only way we will enter when all is said and done, it's going to be by revelation. &gt;&gt; It's going to be by stripping everything everything humanly. Just like Jesus said, not my will but thy will. Father, we will have to come to a place where he says, "Father, I have no will. I have no way. If you don't come, I die." If we still have even an ounce of intellectual that we can hang on to and and because I still got a job, then I'll come. No, it's going to have to come to a place where we say when all is stripped away from me, I'll still serve the Lord &gt;&gt; because it will go either one way or the other. And all it's looking for is to slow you down from the progress from obtaining to the promise. And the scripture says they without them uh them without us they're not made perfect. So they are waiting on us to catch up. They are waiting for us to win. I love said they are probably standing over there and just pressing on and just screaming press on brothers. You're almost there. Don't give up. Just keep going. &gt;&gt; Let's not give up. Let's continue the fight. He the general Jesus Christ himself is leading the fight. Let's continue and he will lead us to the promised land. Amen. Brother M. Thomas sake, if you could just come and dismiss us. Amen. And if you need prayer tonight, don't be ashamed. Don't be afraid. You just come up and I'll say this even while the word is being preached. If you need prayer, just come up forward. All right? You don't have to wait. And you know, Bman says we can get out of order a little bit. You know, just come forward and the Lord will speak to you and he will do what he needs to do. Amen. Let's bow our hands. Heavenly Father, Lord, it was good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Lord, the word spoken, Lord, has gone forth, Lord. Lord, I pray that everyone in here, Lord, that might be streaming, Lord, that that we would go out and be doers of your word, Lord, not just hearers. Lord, as our brother just said, the hour is late, the distractions are great. Lord, the enemy is coming in like a flood. During a flood, every crack, every crevice, every little area, Lord, gets filled with water, Lord. But we had one come in this day that reminded us that when we see the enemy come in like a flood, that you raise up a standard. Lord, you've raised up a word to to bring us victory. [Music] &gt;&gt; The words are a victorious. Lord, it's us that you're waiting for, Lord. Help us to continue to die daily. Lord, to put you first, to seek first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the devil has is lies. Lord, we know that you've got our back. Lord, it's been you the whole time. It's grace that's led us safe this far, and your grace will lead us home. that we just ask that you'd be with us, Lord, that you would. We want to give you the preeminence, Lord, not just in this service, but in our lives, Lord. We don't just want a savior. We want a Lord. This message was not a message of a man, but from you, Almighty God. We love you. We thank you for it. We ask that you'd be with us as we go. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Want to remember our pastor and just pray that the Lord will bring him back safe home and those that are still on that went to camp and other places and the Lord will be with them. Amen.
