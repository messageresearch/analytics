Description:
They Testify Of Me.
Br. Matthew McGeary
Sunday Evening Service
November 24, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

but of an eternal benefit Lord to your people so we just pray that you come in the cool of the evening now Lord and speak to us once again we pray we love you and ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if you have your Bibles let's just turn into uh John chapter 5 amen we I almost don't want to say it but I I I I'm going to to be short this evening but anytime a minister says that that's the only time I would say you probably shouldn't believe them because they try to be short it doesn't work out too well but we we just um just kind of wanted to share something on our heart um uh um we we had a message we wanted to preach to you um but I just feel that the Lord wants to bring that another time um so we just we just shifted here and and and this morning before Service uh something that was just said that was a fresh inspiration so I just thought we'd talk about that just for a moment and uh by God's grace we'll bring we'll bring this other thought another time so uh just reading in John 5:39 it it says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me amen you may be seated also just turning your Bibles to Psalms 23 I can really hear myself and I like it you know sometimes in a big building your voice gets absorbed into the and you strain your voice but uh I I can I can hear so maybe I can keep my voice for more than a couple days Psalms 23 let's reading there I sure like the Psalms and I find out um if if if maybe the book of Psalms hasn't become a treasure to you um it's usually usually in the hard times that the book of Psalms really becomes a cherished book because many of the Psalms David wrote was when he was in dark times and he would say yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies that anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever and I just want to say that um uh maybe for a title I just want to title this they testify of me just bringing that from John 5:39 they testify of me and we we know that faith is a revelation and you know Faith really what it does is it produces a reality in the believer's life you know uh we would hear messages preached you know possessing the Gate of the enemy possessing the Gate of the enemy after a trial we we know we have the gates the gates of the senses of the spirit and of the flesh but but there's another a sense and that's the sixth sense of faith and the the amazing thing about faith it has an ability to call those things that are not as though they are and it has ability to see the Unseen where everything is all around you is declaring something else but then faith has an anchor that declares a different reality everything says you're going to fail you're going to die uh there's no way for you to make it this is going to be your end but there's something else that's declaring uh the word of God I would say faith is a revelation that declares another reality and I just want to say that God God loves to test his children you know he allows things to get to a place to where it's impossible and not not with a probability as some would call it you know where all hope is lost 99.999% no he'll allows something to get to a place where like it's just 100 % sorry there there's just no other way you're it's just that's it and you know you can just look through the Bible and and and and find example after an example of the Patriarchs and and Abraham and Sarah and just it's just everything it got to a place where it was impossible and and that's God likes it that way he wants you to get to the place where after all of your trying and after all of your reasoning and after all of your efforts you know you finally say Okay I I can't do it you know you you you know anybody ever lost something and you you search your your your pockets a million times you might as well stop it's not there and you finally say you know what Lord will you help me and really that's what God wants you to get to a place is where you trust him and you're walking with him and and you you wonder why when you look at the children of Israel why would God lead the children of Israel he brings them out by a mighty hand and then he leads them right into a trap you know you know uh pharaoh and all of them be like you know this God had some power but he sure is a poor general you know my you know all of this power he had look what he did he led them and they're pinned uh with their backs against the Red Sea and here comes the Pharaoh's Army coming charging down you know a you would think that would be the time where the Believers would have said oh what's he going to do this time I mean look what he did out there in the wilderness I mean back there in Egypt and and now we're in a place where I tell you brother Billy it's impossible but we serve a god of the impossible right he he and so there should have been expectation there and so God does that in your life and in situations he'll allow you to come to a place and everybody started to murmur and complain and it's amazing how easy it is for us to get our eyes off of God and his word and off the promises and start looking at the circumstance say God did you bring me out here to die that's just the opportunity for God and for Faith to take hold and and brother Brandon would say and be certain of God he says you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith amen did you know that God likes to see how you'll react well sometimes we don't react right and you guess what's going to happen you're going to come right up to the same trial again because inside of you there is is a word reaction but when you're leaning on the Flesh in the ways of man and you continue to try to reason or Justify or you go through a season of of sanctification or you you you come up to a battle and you fall again there is a word reaction by faith which is your victory that if you allow God to be the one living through you that'll give you that victory in your life and so you'll come up and God loves to see how you would react he allows you to get to a place where it seems impossible where it seems like there's no way for you to win and get into a battle I'd like to maybe just give you a quick example of that so I I'm gonna have Weston ha Wyatt come up here come on guys just come up and stand right here yeah there you go right down there that's fine that's fine just hey that's pretty good and I'm I'm gonna ask brother Andrew come on up and hey David you can come on over here hey brother Billy why don't you go down and and join him hey we'll get Gary Gary go go ahead and go on over there and stand over here and hey I I got a good one brother Daniel come on up front come on come on brother Daniel we'll get you involved come on up you go ahead and stand right over here on that side of the eye and face these two guys right y'all are going to come down here y'all go go all over because y'all are in a fight no y'all are in a fight all right there you go all right now look come on down there all right now okay there you go that's good that's good right there you're facing off guys all right this this is the battle right here all right now I I mean I mean who will give me five no who's going to win this fight now let me let me rephrase this now now but but if you look at this who's going to win this fight we all know that if we were talking in the ways of Flesh this is an impossibility this is an absolute impossible task for these uh young men to win this battle but you know I want to paint a different picture right here you know and and this is Weston and but they're going to be love and faith all right and you know love and faith they work together right did you know love and faith work together and right here is standing love and faith and we know that love is God God is love and God is his word and and here's standing love and faith and over here is standing fear and depression and anxiety sorry about that guys I told you but but these are all the armies of the other side a and they're the Boogey men right they're they're they're they're coming to to defeat you uh but you know what I I love about this is that is is when fear comes David's fear now he gots his arms up and he's coming at you but how do you win this battle how does faith and love win this battle when fear comes in we have a promise in 1 John 4:18 that says there's no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear so your weapon is the word and the spirit of the word so when fear comes you don't have to you don't have to beat these guys all by yourself I mean there it's impossible for you to take all these down and put them in a strangle hold all right but if you use the word amen yes how did Jesus overcome he did he could have said the word but he was teaching in one place Jesus said I sanctify myself Jesus didn't need to sanctify himself but he was training and teaching and showing and he said it is written so when all of these big monsters over here start to come and fear is coming in your life you have to say it is written there is no fear and love but perfect love cast out fear and now Andrew the Giants coming oh he's got what are you going to do you look at the word first John 4:4 says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and that giant goes tumbling down to the ground boom when sickness comes he doesn't leave you over here with a sickness and and all of these guys are and like there's no way for me to be well look they're they're already getting scared ain't that amazing you put one down and and now sickness is taking a seat he's saying you know what you know what this must be the same God that whipped us at the Red Sea this must be the same God that whipped us on C could it be that same God that was in Peter that same God that was in Moses that same God that was in John is in these little guys right here and the little guy stands there and also he says he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed Hallelujah that's how you overcome faith and love is working together now I'm not done with you yet all of a sudden Here Comes one of the scariest ones death death is coming what are you going to do in the face of death what are you going to do what does the word say the word says oh 1 Corinthians 15:55 oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory but thanks be to God who give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord bless and maybe you get looking around and you see ministers and and you you you see deacons and and you see the elders and the devil starts to tell you well you'll never be like them you made a mistake you told a lie to your mommy or your daddy you'll never grow up to be a real Christian that's how the devil works but see how are you going to fight how does faith and love you work together and you take the sword of the spirit and the word of God and when he tells you you you'll not you're not what you should be Philippians 1:6 says being confident in this very thing that he which begun a good work in you oh come on I don't care how how spiritual you've ever felt or how ordained of God and how predestinated and elected you fa there's times you come in your life you start to even question if you're a child of God you start to question do I even have the go Holy Ghost you start to question why am I even here but oh there's an anchor in the soul that says being confident of this everything that he which be done a good work in you he will perform it until the end of the day of Jesus Christ amen give these people a hand God bless you oh the devil starts to come at you and he says you don't have the Holy Ghost you ever been there that probably a good good great chance that you got what he's trying to rob you from but he's clever he'll point to your your mistakes and your failers in such a way where you don't have the Holy Ghost and you say Lord if I don't have the Holy Ghost Lord I want it but I look into your word in Romans 8:30 says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called lord I know you called me but you said if you called me you also Justified me and if you Justified me Lord I believe you and if you justify me then you've already glorified me Hallelujah your Victory is laying right there in the word but you see it looked impossible I mean that that that's an impossible task an impossible battle but you know when you look at the greatest battle ever fought brother Brandon would say and grab the faith the sword of the spirit thus sayith the Lord and scream Hallelujah you know sometimes I look like a mad man cuz I just I just scream Hallelujah I said I'll be walking through the house or you know the family knows there goes dad again I'll just be going along be hallelujah what are you shouting about I don't even know but Hallelujah anyhow right because it seems like everything's wrong but sometimes you just go to praising God like we heard this morning you know what I fell down I I made a mess of things but praise God anyhow he started the work he's going to finish it thank you Lord scream Hallelujah then cut down every enemy in front of you there were some enemies there but cut them all down there it is cut every enemy an old spooky Spirit making you feel all cut that thing away with what the word of the Lord but our strength the joy of the Lord is our strength get away from me whack you cut him with the word whether it be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be a sickness whether it be a disease whatever it is take that word and pull that sword that's what I was I was forgetting you were supposed to be standing there with your Bible right using that word pull with the sword and if you whack it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again and then give up no in that qu brother brand talks about he loves to test his children he said now if if if you if you say Lord I believe you and you're a good God and you healed me and then you don't get better and you say well that's just how he is you know and and you storm off well I guess I'm not a child of God anyways well I guess I'm I'm I'm never going to get healed no he says he can't use that but if you stand there with the word of God and that enemy is buffed against you over and over you hit him with the word and if he don't move you hit him again you hit him again Whack It Again Whack It Again whack it and whack it till you chip the hole through like a little chicken peeping itself or an eagle what you are peep yourself right on through that old Shell of sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one amen that's the battle that's the soldier that's the soldier of the Cross yes sir knock every enemy out who's he talking about search the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life look if Jesus did it all right right then you're able to stand and say Search the word of God it testifies of me right so you're called to knock every single one of them out Romans 8:31 says what shall we say to these things if God before for us who can be against us I like how the psalmist said why should I feel discouraged why should the Shadows come why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and all when Jesus is my portion my constant friend is his His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me why do you sing because I'm happy I sing because I'm free His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know that I know he's watching me yeah but you're away from God you send away your day of Grace all of these things are true but you are the one that identifies with the other side no faith and love are working together Romans 8:35 says what shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress persecution famine nakedness Peril sword it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded see Faith persuaded it can't be persuaded by anything else Faith's one persuasion is the word of God I am persuaded nothing else can persuade me otherwise for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come there ain't no height there ain't no depth no other creature shall be able to separate us from from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so go ahead and run your mouth go ahead and criticize go ahead and call me all you want to call me you dumb devil go ahead and be little try to tear down try to point to complexes try to point to the veil try to say this and say that yeah but I can stand like Jesus stood and say search the scripture and them you think you have eternal life but the very one word testifies of who I am faith has to be persuaded in that when you're standing against all opposition because your mind will fail you your feelings will fail you your family can fail you your friends can fail you everything around you can fail you but there's one thing Hallelujah that will never fail the believer and that is the word of God and God is his word and it can never fail I said it can never fail for heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away search the scriptures they testify of who I am sometimes you just got to put up the mirror in the morning and walk on in and look you're the Rascal you made me fall yesterday and you're going to try to make me fall again but I am called to put you under my feet because that image I see in the mirror is not who I really am my image is in the word of God God because I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Very message testifies of who I am there's faith faith in who you are good we're right on schedule here Jesus said at that day in Christ The Mystery of God revealed Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me when the Revelation is made manifest I want to ask you where is the Revelation being made manifest at that day you shall know you you me you what this is really testifying of you at that day you father in me and I and you and you and me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I am the father uh that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father in me then when the Revelation comes forth where is the Revelation coming forth we all want to look back and say well that was in in the sheath wave yes well you know there was another sheath wave before brother brandom got here Jesus Christ is the original sheath wve but God wanted to have a family he was just getting started right he was the sheath wave was lifted up there on Calvary and he was wed back to the people on Pentecost but see God by Divine promise promised that he sent a prophet to restore the same faith and when this word is made manifest when this Revelation comes forth not just in the prophet he was a first one but now that same Revelation is coming forth in a many membered bride body search the message it testifies of who I am search the scriptures and then you think you have a go ahead and point to my faults and my failures and point to all my Oddities and point to My Flesh and point to my family and point to my condition try to put me in this and that this is why he's that way and he's just trying to do this and he's wanting to be political go ahead and say all those things and I stand in the name of the Lord and I say search the scriptures and them you think you have eternal life but it's testifying of who I am you can speak against God's anointed you can speak against the Bride of Jesus Christ oh but you have a reality faith is anchored in the word come on church it's time to take the word of God and fight it's time to take the message of the hour and fight you're not going to miss the rapture you're not just some odd peculiar person with all kinds of complexes and you're never going to make it it's just oh maybe I'll get in by a glass of water I'm getting excited I didn't mean to get excited Hallelujah I'm in a battle Devil's trying to squash us trying to take us out right right but we have no other appeal no other place to stand but on the word come on search the scripture Jesus wasn't going by the the the feeling of the the the crowd I wonder if they'll accept me or not you know I mean uh hey guys I'm the Messiah uh you know they're kind of feeling it they're not I'm going go over to this side and like hey you know this is who I think I am what do you think about that yeah no his reality was the way come on I'm buing my heart we all go through it you're working your job you're working your 5 to n you're coming to church twice a week and you're dragging around this bag of bones and all the lady you'll see in this bag of bones is trying to tell you who you are not no nope you'll never live it you'll never get the victory you're always going to you're always going to be tempted by by the sexualization out there of all the women you're never going to get the vict that's what the devil says but faith and love work together start taking them out his word and say uh I'm done playing church I'm going to take the word and I'm going to whack that thing greater is he that is in me and he that is in the world and if he don't move hit him again if he don't move hit him again keep whacking and whacking cut yourself through that devil knock every single one of them out come on yes sir search the message you are the message it testifies of who you are oh I love it I don't know about you but you wouldn't want to know what's the conversations that happens between these two ears oh man y'all probably chain me up and throw me in an institution I'm one crazy bird I'm telling you some crazy things can get kicking around in there I don't know things I wouldn't tell nobody I'm telling you I'm like but he knows Lord forgive me he knows it's okay son you're a vessel just empty out and fill up with me quit filling up on the things of the world fill up on the things of God a bird will fly over don't let it build a nest and if something starts settling down you say wait a second all right all right devil I see I allowed you to seow that little seed and it's popped its head up and I I've started to be back biting against my brother I kind of got to talking about the church I started to talk about uh uh how I feel things should be done I I kind of started thinking well the only reason you know that that one people they just sit in the back over there cuz they're really not a Believer who are you to say anything about anybody actually my my my my Prophet taught me that you you you you you can be entertaining Angels una of aware God could Veil himself in the grocery store clerk you mean God use a person that looks like a worldly person well I don't know how any more of the world you can get than a donkey if God wants to speak out of a donkey he'll speak out of a if God wants to speak out of what you would call a painted face jasmel Believe It or Not he'll speak right out of their mouth amen that's right he'll use whoever he wants however he wants to get your attention the question is is are you going to accept the correction but we get so high and puffed up and and so pred that's where we going we're supposed to be quitting right about now we get so predestinated and and so lifted up we don't have the life I don't want to go that direction we're not using the word to lift oursel up we use the word to get into our place to get into our position to do battle and I tell you where the bride of Christ should really be now we should have such a Sanctified consecrated life where we're not trying to do battle just to keep a Sanctified life but we can be like Abraham Hallelujah you know who you are you're persuaded I have met God he has given me a promise I'm going to be a father of many nations I'm going in a body change I'm going in a Rapture God give me my family he give me my health he's going to give my B he's going to give me my baby so when the enemy comes in and he starts messing with your brother or your sister you ain't you ain't got to be well let me let me get prayed up real quick let me get prayed up and let me sanctify my life and let me get into a place so I can finally get in the game that's how some of us are sometime oh we got a real need now well hold on let me let me make everything right let me uh make sure I get everything you know it's like somebody shows up unannounced you're like running around you're like throwing things under the carpet and throwing things in the closet and and making everything look like you know like everything's okay you know many times in the work that I do I they have to bring me into the backyard and and they'll bring me through and all the time excuse the house excuse the house and I my comment is always I said it's okay they're made to live in CU life's a mess you know you don't you don't have to make excuses for SpaghettiOs being crusted on the floor and all over the counter top I can see you got four babies I can see you got I can see you're living life life ain't easy life's messy life's dirty sir but we want to act like we like nothing's going on the Lord comes to your house and oh let me just let me let me just straighten everything up let me let me I better throw all the short skirts into this jawer and that jawer if he starts to look around my no say Lord come in life's messy I ain't been living quite right but you know what I love about the Lord he doesn't say you know you ought to clean that stuff up he'll be talking to you like how you feeling today before you know it he got the broom in his hand he's working with you he's helping you start to realize my burden's getting a little bit lighter starts to clean up the house a little bit start to tidy and before you know you just talking with him a while having a little prayer and all a sudden you get to look it around like man the Spaghetti O are gone the counter's clean and all of a sudden you're like where is my past anyways oh it's I took care of that too you don't have to worry about that anymore and then if you just start walking with him uh with a consecrated heart before God and then all of a sudden you hear about a brother or sister they got a messy house say so so's houses a little dirty say you know what I I actually God showed me how to clean house you know what why don't I go over to brother so and so house and see how they're doing you come over there like how's everything going everything's good yeah you sure everything looks okay you come in a little bit further and and all of a sudden you get into like oh okay yeah yeah there's a little bit of of a mess here you know so many times people always want to come over for the fellowship and leave early because they don't want to clean where are we going well hallelujah we're going to have church we want to be some big Crusaders we want to be some big look at me but I tell you those humble servants who stay back and help wash your floor and do your dishes God bless them you don't know how much that means we always want the Big Show the big put on the big look at me when I say it's time we live a consecrated life where we can be like Abraham who who's whose son and daughter is out in the world my oh they're really burdened by that well let let's let's go after them let's get let's start expecting them to be in the house of God well you you you know what what how am I going to do that well I just got a few pruning Hooks and shears it doesn't matter about what you got it matters about who's with you when you're walking with him like these two young men that were standing here they weren't counting on their own strength they were counting on the word they can say it's not about me it's about what the word says you want to know if I'm going to win the battle search the scripture search the message then you can go do battle huh all right where are we at we might just call for the musicians I said about 20 30 minutes why don't we do that we just call for the musicians I told you we're going to be short but I I I it's purposeful because we don't have to say a lot but if God can take a little and multiply I want to say a little in his hands is enough like that little boy how in the world how in the world could he feed the multitudes you want to know how does anybody want to tell me how he gave it to Jesus I say tonight somebody you just need to give it to Jesus I I don't care what it is you got just give it to him we might be in the house of God five minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes but I say if he can take one of these words and multiply by Revelation in your heart and give you the victory H because the devil's trying to run you down trying to criticize trying to divide come on we got we got to we got to get spiritual church amen the prophet said he he won't let your church just just be all a big big family he'll come in and try to sew poison he'll come and try to cause division he said don't ever take sides with that well come on the devil works the same way he'll do it in your family and your relationships I mean he does it in our parking lot you know you're your kid hit my kid you would think we would be more spiritual did you know the the devil tries to use our kids to keep families from fellowshipping and somebody will come over like well you know they're kids just like this they're always bullying oh really okay well you know yeah I kind of I really don't get along with him anyway so yall want to go hang out together yeah we'll go hang out and talk about them how much we don't like them Lord have Merc it's sad but God knows right where you're living sir and we call ourselves the Capstone bride of Jesus Christ where is the love amen we are hey I I tell you sometimes you got to pick which M mountains you fight on there's been a lot of situations man it just like man that has to be dealt with and God's like leave it alone leave that alone but Lord do you see I'm sorry yes you see I'll take care of it you just you just take care of you just mind your own business basically some of us just need a my hey you can talk about me all that you please I'm trying to close maybe that'll good be a good song to sing but I'll talk about you down on my knees real lightly because I I got another quote Oh I always do this and I'm sorry Jesus said at that day that's this day I like how he closes out he says then when the Revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you in me he goes there you are I I know he's not really saying there you are but I read it as there you are there you are there you are hey mama that's me there I am you're right there laying in the word where you can stand and say this day this scripture is fulfilled search the message and them you think you have eternal life but this message is testifying about who I am thank you because the I am is here we keep trying to put everything out in the future oh then then then no the I am is here if you can believe it all things are possible oh my we'll praise the Lord let's just stand the word is your reality it's not a hope so it's not it's not a mental makeup you know David didn't have to worry about how he was going to become king he didn't worry about if Goliath was going to kill him the word said he was going to be king that's right and God anointed him for the job and I say it's time as the Bride of Jesus Christ we can take the Bible just like Jesus Took the book and said this day this scripture is fulfilled he said and as the father has sent me so send I you Jesus said the father that sent me him went in him to vindicate himself right for he was the word and the same Jesus that sends you goes with you and in you to vindicate the same God and as the father has sent me I live by the father so I send you and you live by me what is he he's the word you live by the word there you are you are the word you live by the word you don't live by man's opinions you don't live by your memory you don't live by your past you live by the word I want to sing that song uh oh

may know that he doesn't want you to walk just like anybody in the streets he wants you to be to have this in mind every day in every battle that you go through he wants you to take the word of God and go forward he wants you to use the word what the word is not given for for us to fight with one another it's given for us to come together and go fight the enemy we have an enemy you know we have someone after us trying to discredit us and trying to bring us down and trying to do all kinds of things and trying to show that what we have doesn't work my goodness that's the one we got to go after amen I love that it's not it's given when you see a circumstance I was fellowshipping with a brother you know you talk about the power to bring into existence someone is going through a problem you can speak a new world for them you you can look at someone they're not a Christian and they they're going through the they sick or they have difficulties and whatever is going your word will speak into existence a new world for them that they can go live on it but if we would use it to to try to get the all the quotes and to try to do this and do that no that's not it's not going to be effective that way it's going to be effective when we use it for healing when we use it for deliverance when we use it to come together when he use it to bring us together and make us one because the bride in the end time is the very image of who he was when he was here on Earth We're certainly thankful just ask that brother the Lord will bless brother Matthew for what he just poured out and amen
