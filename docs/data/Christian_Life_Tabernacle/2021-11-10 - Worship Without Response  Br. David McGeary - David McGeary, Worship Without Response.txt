that you would speak to us from your word may it just be our portion this evening each one father receiving something of you we ask it lord you would grant that to us in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen lord bless you tonight let's turn in our bibles as we're just gonna speak a few words concerning our meeting coming up and and trust that they're a blessing to you let's turn in our bibles to matthew the seventh chapter and the seventh verse so um we don't know how many is uh watching in tonight or connected up i i know we usually have a 30 or 40 sometimes more but we certainly like to see all those people materialize i think brother billy preached to us tonight last wednesday about it becoming material you know i'd like to see the church materialize i some of them i i believe they're still there i haven't seen them for several years but i think that we're trusting that as many could come out as we can friday night we're really looking forward to brother uh burly williams coming and sharing with what's on his heart with us and then brother tom ray and just have uh kind of go back and get our meetings started again we didn't go outside to invite a lot of people in but we hope that you can come with your friends if any of them would respond or all of our family can come out together and grow on the lord let's listen to the seventh verse here as we just read this and i'm sure you'll be able to derive very quickly where our heart is going ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth now this is the lord speaking so how how how much value does that statement have to you if he said so if i said so you might wonder if i'm kidding or you know what i'm getting at and all this but when he speaks that's gold that's solid rock so i mean he says and it shall be open to you for everyone that asketh receive it and he that seeketh find it and to him that knock that it shall be opened now he he makes those great promises now he he's now he wants to put it in perspective to you so you can take what he just said and consider it in the light that he's speaking it so he wants to give you a little confirmation even from your own selves to so that this statement gains so much more weight it says or what man is there of you whom if his son asked bread he will give him a stone or if he asks a fish will give him a serpent if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him wherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men shall do to you do even so to them for this is the law and the prophets father bless your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated uh i think those these are great scriptures uh in going uh into our services and you know one thing about the great things and the great blessings of god it's like a cup you know that it overflows and when you get blessed and and you're blessed and god's working for you and and you're seeing god moves it's not long that that just overflows you know what i mean and then you're sharing your blessing you're sharing your testimony i like this scripture and its approach uh because the lord ties it into whatsoever thing that you would have men do to you you do to them and he's he's putting he he's talking about the father in heaven and there's one thing that we know about the lord is that he practices what he preaches you you can you can confident and i love how all the brothers have been going going through the word and trying to bring us to the place that we build our confidence in the word of god build our confidence in the things that god says and to have the scriptures and the word of god become the guiding principles by which we achieve things you can achieve things by man and that gives glory unto man how many times have uh i've heard the testimony from believers they've taken jobs that were really over their head or beyond their educational degree or they they went ahead and took responsibilities that they have never had before and they were willing to step out into those areas because they trusted in the grace of god and and that's how that we want to go forward we don't want to achieve and accomplish without uh the lord being in it and if god be in it and god be with us and god be for us then he can do all things all things are possible uh we we have we've got that understanding in our heart the understanding as the our messenger called it the uh the vision the the vision of the opportunity that a lie that lies there for us that it's possible with god you know the possibility is there as long as he's with me i can do it amen that's the one trust i have is the possibility so we're talking about going in to these uh meetings and and we want to go into a meeting or you want to go into anything understanding that god as a father and that's a that's a good question you know do we really look at god as a father you know our father we look at him as the creator we look at him as one that you know can do whatever he wants and that we need to be in in fear of him but i don't know if that's just the fear like a fear of wrath or just a fear of respect and and honor you know that that you want to do but the father also knows that you want to do his will and and i i don't think that you would be here tonight if there wasn't either a conviction working in you or a love working in you or something in you that you knew there was a god and you hungered for the lord and jesus now of course you know in his ministry he's now bringing to the church an exodus and we know an exodus is coming out of one thing and moving into another he's he's he's now he's preaching the gospel to the jews and uh we all of these scriptures we all put believe are all part of the great sermon on the mount when he was preaching in the crossroads of trade up there on this southern part of the sea of galilee and and so he's talking to him in an exodus exodus and he's trying to change the relationship that they have with god as a god of far off to a god that's going to dwell with him what what a what a gospel understand the gospel that jesus is preaching is tr is is revealing to his children that god has an attitude towards them that's different than they perceived remember by law that's what they lived under and now he's preaching to them the exodus of moving from one spiritual way of worship from one spiritual mindset from one approach to a new approach and in order for them to approach god in a new light in a new spirit and a new understanding they need to understand some things about the god that they serve and now he's they're not just serving him as a god is afar off but jesus if i could use this word if it would be all right jesus is thankfully he is humanizing god you know what i mean he's wanting you to understand that god is now creating a union with your thinking and his thinking which one of you being evil you know and and that's what the jews realized right we're evil we're sinners we need the law to keep us we've got to stay away from everything that's unclean you know and we don't really ask god the only time we cry out from god cry out to god is when we've broken his law or we've moved away from them or we haven't been doing the commandments that we were told to be commanded and therefore we cry out to god now he's bringing to him a completely whole new different relationship how many of you feel that the lord lately through the ministering of his word and his spirit is trying to bring us into a new relationship with him amen something where where we're able to stand up and accept what he's given to us and what he's done that what he's done for us and we're words we're we're as i preached here a little while back we're accepting the responsibility of our election uh we're thankful for it we're grateful for it we're we're gonna and we're not gonna deny what he did okay he he he chose me i'm not gonna deny it he forgave me of my sins i'm not gonna deny it he he was merciful and kind to me i'm not gonna die deny it i'm going to accept it and i'm going to now walk in the responsibility of my appreciation of what he's done for me i am going to be more careful of my testimony i i'm going to become more careful of the light that i'm shining i'm going to be more careful of what what atmosphere it is that i'm testifying too and i'm not going to get all bummed out at the boss because that's not who's in charge of me i'm not going to get mad at the pastor oh that's okay i i threw that in there no i don't think anybody's mad at me i hope everybody that's not here is not mad at me then i have a lot of repenting and work to do because i'm sure you've got a just cause so you understand so now he's going in here and he's saying which one of you now i want you to think for a moment he's introducing to us the thoughts of god jesus is not in this exodus there's two things that are going on he's changing the relationship he's making god human why is he making god human because god is now human right he's walking in flesh diverse manners he did these things but now in his son he's doing these things so now he's he's there he's he's he's i love this terminology it means a lot to my heart he's present tense he who have seen me have seen the father so he's now he's getting very intimate and he's showing to him and he's bringing them to an exodus to a new a new a new understanding of the father a new relationship and he's making inhuman and he say use your own thoughts he says which one of you you know he says if then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him and you know i thought of a a a title or a thought of or what it was that i was wanting to express and i just came up with a little thought you know worship without response to worship without response and and before it just seemed like they were just worshipping oh wow you know he's god he's the only true god it's worshiping it that worshipping and uh but there there was never a desire for a response you know what i mean it's like you you know it it's and he's he's starting to tell him now it's not just you saying i love you or i adore you or you're the almighty your god uh your oh i could get so excited right now buddy no i'm gonna close it keep my things in because but it's not it's it's it's not just you can you just picture it they're burning lambs and they're they're doing all these things and it's all adoration and everything but there's no response but but there couldn't be a response but now that there's an offering made and a sacrifice being made and the real lamb has come down to take away our sins now he has put himself in a position where he can respond so now it's not anymore but keeping the law keep yourself clean keep your thing separating out of people but now the relationship is changing and now he wants to respond to worship now his response is not going to be i got a like this is a tight line i'm going to try to walk here but his response is not only his intervention in his life in your life when you don't know it he doesn't want it to be a response like a puppet you know i'm going to pull this string in your life and i'm going to pull this string in your life and without us having any relationship at all i'm just going to guide your steps and part of that is true the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord and that's what we know that grace is grace is divine intervention in our lives that that comes from the throne of god in other words god makes a decision to intervene in our life on our behalf for our betterment that's grace mercy is god deciding not to carry out the judgment that you deserve but to to uh to uh wipe your slate clean and to absorb what you justly deserve and and take it within his own judgment and and so the relationship is not just a relationship from him intervening but now he invites you into the relationship to ask for a response ask anything that that's that that's a that's a new thing we realize now that he has kept us by what grace and by mercy that all along the way he has been intervening he has been protecting us and keeping us in everything so he's done those things but now the relationship is it's almost like that's that's how he courted us but now it's becomes a union and he's he's he's he's telling us that i will respond i will respond it's not worship without response you've loved me you've served me you've accepted my mercies you've accepted my grace you've accepted my word now i'm sitting here telling you ask me and i'll i will give you the desire of your heart seek me and you'll find me so so just to take this beautiful a thought about this uh book the exodus that they're going through and the change of their relationship and that god's now wanting to enter into a relationship of response he wants to respond to your heart's desire oh that's the first thing that you go to right is all your dirty sins that keep you from asking you're not worthy you're not that he's trying to bring you past that you know you know if if you're dirty ass for soap and water hallelujah you got a habit you want the liver ask for deliverance this is what he's saying i'm not going to give you a stone you know i i will respond to you what a beautiful god that you you understand you understand in my heart just bubbling over is that he he's brought he's he condensanted he he came from being god to uh to a man that we could handle them and touch them and feel them and experience it and have a relationship with them so now he's saying i was up there and you worshiped me afar off and with your your your lips you did worship me but your hearts were apart from me but now i've come down i become one of you i'm in your form and now i'm humanizing myself and telling you i because i've cleansed you i'm willing to have a relationship with you on your level i like that i i i'm having a lot of fellowship and and and uh you know i enjoy giving brother tommy a hard time so uh he we got to talking about the scripture you know in in first sean in the beginning was the word you know and everything that was made by made by him and he was talking about how you know and i said well tommy you're just trying to figure out god you know and the scriptures are so phenomenal when you sit down and read those first four scriptures it's just you know it just it just the expanse of it is just pretty soon you just you know you're lost because he put it within you that you can't but the beginning of the end so there's this great god and now he's coming down where he's going to deal with your thoughts the way you think the way you perceive the way you hurt the way you take emotions and the way you take input and everything about that you are he is now becoming so he's became you you've heard this statement right that we might become him that we might be conformed into the image of his son so we're going into this meeting and we don't want to approach this meeting with the attitude of i'm going to wait and see what happens i'm going to come into this meeting and i'm going to make something happen because i am going to ask [Music] and because i ask and he's already placed himself in the position of a responder a lot of talk about first responder i'd like to maybe preach a message called the first first responder have i already preached that you understand you understand now he's responding this is where he wants the relationship he doesn't want worship without response him you are this is his attitude yes this is his thoughts this is what he is trying to reveal to us as is i'm not the kind of god that you just sit there and worship me and worship me and worship me and i don't respond to you i want you to know me i want you to know the kind of god that i am i want you to know the love that i have for you god so loved the world that he responded with his only begotten son so he's not he's he's trying to change the dynamics we're now he's in our lives responding it's not worship without response let's just do a quick bible study you like the word let's turn over to jeremiah and we're going to go to jeremiah the 29th chapter and we're going to start with the ninth verse you you'll see as we read this why our messengers so much begin to talk they say the days of miracles are passed so what they're saying the day of response is past the day of god responding to your hearts and your needs what happens if we we you know uh if you look at the love that a mother has for her child and how she responds to that child's needs you know and a real mother and how she responds to that child's needs and now god's sitting back and saying that that's even one of my attributes i'm here to respond thank you lord i mean what a relationship but so this is what he he said let's go through this for a moment if you don't mind bearing with me in my folly it says for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord so if they're prophesying falsely is they're not telling the people what he really is remember that was one of jesus's first complaints they they you keep you wash pots you wash pans you do this you do all these things you know what i mean and my father's not in it so as we read he says for thus saith the lord that after 70 years now this is to the jews but this is also to me if i let me just say to me a type of the seven church agents so after after a period of time i'm going to i am now going to enter into a relationship with you and the relationship is what responds so the law is a form of captivity well that's what the law is right you can't do what you want to do okay but when you're born again you do exactly what you want to do the trouble you have is with the things you don't want to do just the opposite okay so he says here beautiful i love it he said accomplished at babylon what's babylon that's that's the catholic church it's a denominational spirit it's a great harlot it's everybody that's spewing out all this religious stuff and if that's false and these lies and contrary to the word this whole religious uh apostasy that we're in is beautifully typed here he said after after years after the seven church ages are accomplished in uh the nickelodeon seven church ages accomplished in babylon under the great harlot praise god that's you won't find that in your bible so if i lost you don't start turning pages i i'm just letting you how i read some of these things because prophet of god said take the word of god and bring it to your age put your name in it put yourself in the situation right i we've come out we're in a very dark time where they're robbing us of all our rights and everything and they've been doing it for a long time now you see we all of a sudden we're going whoa where are we prophet of god told us in 56 that they made the choice he said and i will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place now where is it that we want to return to we want to return to eden okay but he's going to cause us to return to this place so there's going to be an exodus where we're coming out of one place and moving into another relationship now and now this relationship is a relationship of not worship without response so we where now he is placing himself self into your lives he is placing himself into the relationship and he's revealing himself to you and how he's going to deal with you how am i going to deal with you ask i'll respond i'll give you an answer you shall receive another if you're asking something that's not good for you he's not going to withhold himself i wish i had that scripture on my mind i know it but i can't recall it my recall is not like it used to be so but that's what he said so he he's not going to withhold it he's going to tell you no that's not bad i got something better for you in other words don't create your own response and then judge your relationship on whether or not a girl told me one time the person she was seeing asked her to marry her and i said what did you say and her answer to me was he didn't give me a big enough diamond of course i went and bought leslie a bigger one but what a response she already had the weight that she was going to measure so we don't want we we just want to know that this is not a relationship without response it's not worship without response and so that as we're we're just looking at this type here as we're just running it through the scriptures just to enjoy god's word because we're wanting to go into the meeting knowing that we're not going in this meeting to worship him and that he doesn't have a response for us we want to go in this meeting knowing that he's inviting you to lay your request down how many loves the story of esther esther comes in right and it was certain death to walk in the presence of the king she walked in there every sword went up and he put his king out his rod out there she was beautiful serving him and he says what would you like me to do up to half of my kingdom hallelujah what did he say little flock it's the father's good pleasure to what give you the kingdom how many's asked for any of the kingdoms all kinds of stuff in the kingdom that would be a sermon when itself wouldn't maybe one day you take that preach on all the stuff that's in the kingdom you can handle it take you about 50 years but that's all right it'll be a lifetime ministry he says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and i believe in and you you know i feel this and i've expressed it to you before that satan works real hard to get you into an adversarial relationship with god that god's always wanting to beat you well that's what the law was it was the law of punishment of condemnation but now he's wanting to lift the condemnation so we just read through and just have a good time in god's word he says then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray un to me and i will hearken unto you so here he's talking in type in the old testament and here he responds and as the lord healing their sick giving their hearts desire answering rabbi rabbi you know help me here help me there and he's showing and he's preaching god is a god that responds he's not far off he's not the punished he's a deliverer and a lover and a and a great host so now we look at this type and it falls right down into our age and it's the same answer after deliverance i respond i'm a god now that's going to respond to you when you come back to this place out of captivity our relationship is going to be you ask i'll answer he wants to by not asking you're turning away his affections you're turning away his response just think he said they prophesied falsely just think that people that preach that there's no miracles there's no works there's no supernatural intervention they've it's a one-sided relationship and no wonder he said that with their lips they do worship me but their hearts are far from me look as we read let's just read these few scriptures it's beautiful i will hearken unto me and ye shall seek me and find me and when ye shall search for me with all of your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from the nations and from all the places we're in i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again unto the place whence i caused you to be carried away from in captivity isn't that just exactly the type of the church ages of us dropping out from where we were in this hickey of time that he could manifest we go through the church ages and now here he is in the last church age he's not saying i've not departed from you i'm with you even in you till the end ask anything of the father in my name and he shall grant it be what's he speaking of he's speaking of now of the relationship of the father to respond to his children he begins to preach this whole relationship of response to the jews which is something totally new to them and look who's responding first beggars and sinners and leopards and sick people not none of the high society and what are they doing they're trying him because this is the kind of god he is i am now going to respond to you i've washed you clean you're pleasant in my sight through the blood i can worship you with you beautiful and now he's saying try me prove me see if i keep my word one of the writers said you have not because you won ask not do you ask not because you don't believe he will respond and his whole relationship now he's trying to change the whole uh whole magnitude of what he wants you to feel about him he wants you to understand you can't worship me without me responding you will not have worship without response those are his attitude towards us we're always talking about our attitude towards him our life towards him what we ought to do for him how we ought to live for him let's just stop for a moment let's just don't go into this meeting about us he wants to share himself he wants to he wants our relationship with him to be enhanced he wants us to know i'm here for you i've got your back i'm with you in this talk to me ask i'm not going to give you a stone i'm not going to give you a fish i'm going to give you whatsoever things you ask prove me try me let's let's understand even the captivity in babylon and they they went away from god and they got captive but he said i'm not going to leave you in that captivity i'm going to bring you back and establish a relationship with you and the only way you can have a relationship with me is to know me and to know that i respond he wasn't bringing him back out of captivity so they could just worship him afar off he wants to be there he wants to be active he wants to be involved said he's a father he's the good shepherd he'll leave the 99 for the one everything about it that you begin to see jesus preaching he's now preaching the father's response to his redeemed children israel rejected it so he brought it over to the gentiles but he can't change it's thrilling so he's a god that that responds so let's don't admit that this meeting that we're going into to be worship without response because you're leaving him out what did jesus teach he says no man does this or does that that it's not rewarded to him a hundredfold in this life and the life to come what's he talking about he's talking about response response everywhere you start reading in the scripture its response how god responds how he reacts how he thinks how he does it's all about i'm i will respond and i i and isn't it funny but the very word that he preaches creates desire in our heart that what we want is we want him we want victory over sin we want our spirits right we want our attitudes right we want to get rid of our worry we want to get rid of things that are ungodly it's it's it's it's it's such a fantastic thing that's happening he's transforming the prayer of our heart and then he's there to respond to that prayer and manifest himself so you know i just wanted to share that with you because i thought well you know this year we didn't invite a lot of people and and we just invited our church and i i like a successful meeting i like when the spirit moves i like uh you know i like the emotion as long as it's controlled in in the word of god uh and i don't want to limit any praise or shouting or anything like that you know just don't shout any higher than you live and and you're in good shape you know but to to come in to a meeting and to be in anticipation and hear god reveal himself to you or speak to you and know that he has a response for you because he knows his thoughts towards you he knows what your heart's desire is and actually to be in anticipation to see the response of god going forward throughout the meeting as we begin to change our relationship with him we're confident that who we are we those things are established now he's he's creating the cry of our heart that he can respond to that cry father may they be one as we are one may they know the love that you love me and that full change that is transforming in the church from not just always being from the standpoint of we got to do this and we got to serve this and we got to do this and it's it's all on us he looks out and he says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i'll give you a rest my yoke is easy my burden is light ask anything of the father and i'll respond amen i i don't want worship without response amen so let's let's come and and and would you you within the congregation each of you know different people in the congregation i don't speak spanish maybe some of our spanish-speaking people can reach out i know we've had some new uh hispanic believers that have come in and they've been worshipped with us the last few weeks or the last month reach out to them let them know about the meetings let people know that you know that haven't been coming to church regularly reach out to them and invite them to the means if we could just get all of us here loving the lord worshiping the lord every one of us just waiting to see what god's beautiful response will be to our worship what a blessed time i believe that this meeting is the theme in my heart for this meeting is the trimming of our lamp and the first way that you get your light that's the purpose of trimming a lamp right to get rid of the smoke and to have the light shine is to receive your light is the response of god in your life he is the light of man amen you love them amen will you be in prayer be here early some of the brothers the young strong brothers sitting on the front row you can get with uh brother jackson he might want to move some tables around in the pavilion or let him know you'll be there after service friday we have some good sandwiches for everybody some drinks and some sandwiches and some chips right after so don't worry about not eating come and feed spiritually and then we'll have sandwiches for you and then saturday morning there's no service this saturday morning but we're meeting over at the gymnasium on bedford road and we're going to have hamburgers and hot dogs and potato salad and beans and and drinks and and chips over there for you and so we're going to try to uh serve uh we're not going to all try to eat at one time you can be there and eat whenever you want but we'll be cooking from like 11 to 1 30 or or something like that a window and a couple different brothers will man the grill so if you show up they can put a burger on for you but we'd like to be able to wrap it up and have a fellowship and and everything and the gym will be open for whatever uh games and stuff and matthew will be helping over there setting up what things that you want to do come with a good spirit we're not competitive you you know what i mean uh if you need the rim lowered to six feet we can do that you know because we're just here to love the lord and love one another and be in anticipation god's looked at your lives he's seen what you've been through you've seen what our church has been through through the pandemic how we've tried to stand the best we could he knows we've confessed our failures and now he's a god that responds and i'm anxious to see that god bless you brother billy close in worship thank you i stand let's sing that song how deep the father's love for us how deep the fathers [Music] the chosen [Music] oh [Music] school [Music] oh [Music] [Music] water tears [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] when [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah aren't you glad i paid your ransom hey amen bernie jackson if we could just come in this miss us tonight [Music] yeah just real quick to echo as brother david said if you have some young people that could um help us out on friday night and even on saturday uh me and the deacon's kind of a plan on how we're gonna serve some things so we'll be looking for that um and then as he said just to try to narrow the time frame of cooking for setup and break down and those that will be over the grill from 11 to 1. so just kind of
