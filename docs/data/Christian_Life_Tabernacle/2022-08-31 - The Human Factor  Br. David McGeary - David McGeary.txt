peter uh left i'm sure that peter's got a side to this story right he he later says you know paul speaks many things that's hard to be understood you know and those of weak minds they get all upset about it but in the midst of everything that is going on here are the disciples and they have a i can say a human factor and human factors has played a lot of part in the scriptures and and the the part that we always have to deal with with humanism and of course the broad definition of the human side of things is when the nature of man gets involved in something uh many of you i i know are are taught teach school and your school teachers and you can see behavioral patterns of children and you are taught to see where those influences come from and we find out there's a lot of human factor in the gospel now we say why why do we take uh such a carnal subject when we're dealing with an elect lady we're dealing with a chosen people the the bride uh there's great mysteries to be discussing and great uh uh great uh truths that have been unfolded in our age and i find that a lot of times that's what happens to us is we get caught away uh into the theology and into the a spiritual mind and we begin to become so spiritual minded that we're missing the very world that's going on around us and a lot of time then we start looking upon heavenly things and we think of heavenly things and and and heavenly things are understood by uh the spiritual things but yet here we are in a body of flesh in a world dealing with human beings all around us and i have found that most of my trouble comes from humans i would say 99 of my trouble comes from humans the other one percent comes from me but understand the the the scripture uh speaks of it and if it's been something that has gone on in the church all the time there has been disputations and disputings of doctrines disputing of of of different uh elements that have came up and people are voice their opinions they voice their sides they voice what they feel is the right way and what's the a wrong way and feelings get hurt and people have a tendency to begin to take sides and and and sure enough somebody will say something and it has such effect and such a disruption on our our our life and our spirit to where it can unsettle us and rob us from our peace and all it was was just something human just think of it the worst human you know probably isn't going to live over 110. my mom's up a hundred so i didn't want to say a hundred but she's not the worst person i know you know she's the best person i know but we let things that bother us we let the human side affect us and the human factor have an effect on us instead of being able to stand back and look at it and realize that's just human you know i i deal with it a lot of times in in in young people and and school kids and and work places where uh you you a child or a kid will be in high school for example and they'll get a teacher and the teachers mean the teacher is rough on them the teacher is negative towards them and they have a bad relationship with this teacher in fact this teacher might even go out of their way to make things difficult and i've sat down with many a a young person that was going through that and i always tried to explain i said stand back for a second separate yourself look at that person they're they're only here in your life for i don't know how long do you go to school i know it's way too long but is it six months at a time seven months at a time is it more than seven months nine months we need to put an end to that john how many agree that's just terrible hey amen you know no wonder i couldn't make it through high school that that's way too long but you gotta you gotta do it you know what i mean you can't let you can't let that person in nine months of your life change the whole course of your life you can't let that human factor affect you it's like somebody that's working and i i've met many a young man that had been on the job and maybe the boss says something and you know what boy that's the end of it they pick up their tools they just stomp off the job to hook over over to maybe three or four sentences or or or just just a human factor that came in somebody that's in a human spirit or a carnal spirit that just doesn't you know just is going to upset their their whole career their whole income pattern and everything because they let the human factor affect them they they they let something outside of them something that's just carnal something that's humid have an effect on us and if we would understand as christians that's part of the whole battle of being a christian and being an overcomer is to overcome the human factor it isn't always about following all these gracious rules and doing all these great works and and and give you know and having a lame for yourself a pattern for good works but there's also a great part of it is you have to deal with the negativity you know what i mean and believe me there's somebody out there that's been designed to get under your skin of course in my life it seems like everybody's designed to get under my skin but that's why i'm preaching this i'm working on it you know what i mean you've got to step back and understand there's a human factor and understand that in the scriptures the human factor has been a great part of the development of the church so let's just read a few places in the scripture so we read this one scripture in galatians where where paul and peter had a conflict and there was a factor and and paul stood back and and watched some brothers being carried away after and then and and then he watched a a gentile one of his converts go over and sit with the jews and wouldn't sit and he saw the confusion that it was causing and the message that it was sending and and so he stood up he felt he had to address it but there was a human factor involved in that that that raised that up and we could go to other places in the scripture where where where the human factor came into effect i believe it's in acts 16 in the 17th verse of the book of acts that paul's walking down the street and the soo sayer girl comes out they have it here on the board the same followed paul and us and cried out saying these men are servants of the most high god which showeth unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said unto the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour and and so we see there that paul uh he he had to deal with the human factor there's a human that had a spirit about him and have something that was a discerner that was was was calling out and and you know the thing that she was saying was true but it got under paul's skin he let it go for a while but but there it's just an incident of humans playing a role in christian lives and we could go we could just go hours through the bible of people that withstood other people in the scripture people that that that rose up people that bore false witness people that that spoke lies and and and the many things that transpired in the scripture the human factor here let's just turn to acts 5 uh just real quick for a second we'll read uh a few other places uh in the scripture because i like uh the scriptures but in acts 5 uh let's just read the first uh thing and and look at the look at the nature of mankind the paul now paul's got to deal that peter's got to deal with this human factor he said but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet now you look at the judgment here of peter and peter said ananias why hath satan tilled thy heart to lie to the holy ghost and keep back part of the price of the land he said while it remained was it not thine own he said it was your money now now paul's dealing with the human factor what a story to put in here because he's he's dealing with a human being right that is pulling off a human stunt and is coming up with human actions now peter just says it was always yours look at what he says he says he says well it remained wasn't not thine and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this in thy heart thou thou hath not lied unto men but unto god and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young men rose wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of the three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and peter answered unto her tell me wherefore ye sold the land for so much and she said yay for so much then peter said unto earth how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out and she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carried her forth and buried her by her husband and a great fear came on all the church and upon as many as heard these things i don't want to miss the point here the point isn't that they they lied they did lie they didn't tell the truth they said that they they sold it for more and all the pretentiousness and all the things but i want you to see here's another part of the human factor entering into the church let's turn over to corinthians first corinthians and or we could just go if we get this reading order let's go to romans 14. so it says romans 14 him that is weep in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputation for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not let not him which eateth let and let not him which eateth not judge him that edith for god receiveth him who art thou that judges another man's servant now we're beginning to see the awareness of the human factor so so now paul's instruction of there's there's there's people that don't eat things there's people that eat things okay there's there's a human factor involved don't get caught up in the human factor don't get caught up in that side of it don't get caught up in the judgment don't be sucked into it and if you notice that all through your life in the workplace at the home place every place there's always something out there that's trying to suck you off of your ground that's trying to push you into a bad attitude trying to push you into a bad spirit again it's just the human factor they're everywhere these humans are are everywhere they're crawling everywhere and they've got all kinds of ideas and all kinds of thoughts and all kinds of opinions and if you're not aware that they're out there they're going to get you you might just become one yourself and you know it's amazing that this kind of seems to be the age where everybody's trying to disciple everybody politically they want you to think the way they do they want you to dress the way they they want you to accept their agendas they wanted to accept your your opinions they come against you with all kinds of attitudes all kinds of negativity all kinds of approaches it's just something you've just got to sit back and you've got to realize the human factor i i was going to today i was going to make a purchase it wasn't for myself it was for somebody else that uh i was going to make a purchase on their behalf and it did it it was for a little larger sum of money than you might be normally used so i had to use a credit card so i called the credit card company i made sure my balance was zero i talked with the representative and i explained to them the situation we got it all cleared up the amount who it was to and everything and he says when are you gonna make this purchase i'm gonna make it within the next 30 minutes and he says okay you're good to go good i call up i make the per to make the purchase and they decline me it's about that time that you realize that you just dealt with a human being i mean you know and now i'm embarrassed on the other end so now i've got the person that i'm trying to make the payment to they're on the other end and i'm now saying you've made a mistake i said now let's go over the number again the number is nobody's got their pen right you know i know some of the numbers but and i give her the number i give her the the number again so now i'm i now i'm dealing with another human factor but the worst part of the equation is my human factor is now entering into it now i'm going to start i'm going to start uh you know start the the human factor is starting to create attitudes in me it's starting to affect me you know so now i think that this poor person on the other side of this phone has got to have mental problems you know brother dan it's like like cutting it twice and it's still too short you know you just you just are sitting back and i'm thinking this can't be i just talked to the lady so now i'm explaining to the lady i just talked to him they said it was good to go well she can't help it she put it in she said i'll write it down i'll put it in again i put she puts it in again and and and and she comes back and says it's it's declined and so by this time i'm saying well the uh you know what i mean so some something's wrong here right well the whole the only thing that was wrong in the whole equation was the human factor and instead of if i'm just trying to say this because we're talking about a church that is wanting to move on to a perfection they're they're wanting to they're wanting to have a love that surpasses understanding they're they're wanting to have a peace that's your past understanding they want to have joy unspeakable they're they're talking about creating an atmosphere they're talking about being a burning candle sitting on a hilltop they're talking about laying a pattern of good works to that to glorify their father in heaven we've got all these great christian aspirations that were supposed to be the saints of god in shining armor but the the whole victory of every bit of that coming to pass is a realization of what you're dealing with you're dealing with humans you're dealing with the human factor every day there's a human factor in fact the world is trying to get the human factor completely out of everything it's going to be pretty strange the day a little robot comes into your room and starts nailing down the floor well they got robots for everything else i wouldn't trust a little machine that rides around my house and sweeps the floor for nothing i don't care that's what they made brooms for but somebody thought up the idea and the only time i've ever seen them things is stuck in a corner but somebody's buying them why because someone don't want to clean up or they get the idea i'm telling you that there's something amazing about the human factor and being able to discern the humanism that we're surrounded with we're just reading here in the scripture and i want you to watch the human factor as it unfolds in these scriptures and how that they have to work through this this human part of some eating some not eating human nature is they want a side either somebody's right or somebody's wrong either you eat or you don't eat and and and paul is talking with the romans and he's saying wait a minute that's human some eat and some don't but don't walk watch how it's handled it becomes beautiful he says let let him that edith despise him that eateth not let not him that eateth despiseth him that he is not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him who art thou to judge another man's servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he upholdeth for god is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord he that regardeth not the day to the lord he regardeth it he he does not regard it he that edith edith to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die in the lord wherefore we live therefore or die we are the lords for this end christ both died and rose and reviled that he might be lord both of the dead and the living but why dost thou judge thy brother or why does thou set at not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ as it is written as i live as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way wow big part of christianity a big part of the consciousness of our life and our action and our reaction paul's actually dealing with how these people are reacting to what other people are doing they go here they go there they do this they see that they eat this they do that they work they don't work don't get caught up into don't judge your shirt let's close with just a couple more things just the human factor we know that the human factor is there let's read corinthians eight first corinthians the eighth chapter the human factor problems that rose up amongst early christians in regard with one another these are problems that rose up in the church the early church they were there were situations that rose up where some were eating herbs and other were eating meat and here's a whole another section here of of of the the what what rises up and and the reaction and action of human beings to certain things that come up and the importance of the christian and the individual to live and work out his own salvation with fear and trembling and if something condemns you then don't do it right all things are lawful for you but all things aren't expedient if you feel you can do something and it'll offend somebody else don't let it be a stumbling block you've got to understand what are you dealing with you're dealing with the human factor you're dealing this person is offended by what i do it ain't well they shouldn't be offended they should know better they should be more spiritual uh what's wrong with them they're just not even a christian they're backslid no you got to deal with it right it's a human factor you know what i mean not everybody not everybody stays after church and prays i would that we we stayed praying not everybody shows up to church on some time the human factor if you know to show up on time you show up on time if you want to stay and pray do you stay and pray you understand look you're going to find the human factor you're going to find people that come in they're disrespectful to the house of the lord because they're disrespectful to the offices it's a human factor if you if you don't realize that this is set up that that the biggest test comes in our lives comes from the people that surround our lives control over dealing with i know it gets under my skin you know what i mean and you know i'm trying to say when the waitress forgets to bring your coffee or or she serves you cold coffee or or or the the food's not hot or you're there first and past you and weights past you and waits on somebody else and and they you you put your order in somebody comes in 10 minutes later sits down and their food comes out first who are you going to strangle are you going to jump up and go talk to the manager are you going to let everybody in this in the shop know i didn't hear no more good we didn't like you anyway it isn't worth it and you say well why are you bringing up the human factor because people are removing god from their life look there's no more moral conscience there's no more god there's no more balance in their spirit they're they're they're now becoming being given over to reprobate minds to human thinking thinking used to be man used to have the fear of god in their heart the fear of of of retribution in their lives the fear of judgment in their life there used to be a balance in people's lives that god put in their lives that caused their human actions to come under control but those bars are being taken down they're being taken down in our schools they're being taken down by our politicians towards law enforcement they've been taken down towards common decency okay you know yeah people will go into a restaurant dressed so vulgar that it makes you hardly you can hardly eat your food amen i mean it's not even cleansing how they they come in but i i i i what am i going to do let them put my light out am i going to let them am i going to let them choke my kindness choke my works to choke the love of god that should be shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit what i'm saying is and i can i hope i can get it to you the human factors on the rise there used to be a a a society you know where you had you had social decency and the way that you did certain things there was a social life there was a society life you respected one another you took care of one another the prophet of god called it common decency as the enemy is eroding that and men are becoming lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god that that human part of man echad haiti used the terminology the animal part of man the brute beast in man the guy that'll cuss and drop bad words and take the lord's name in vain right out in public in a restaurant use cuss words uh come up children and amongst uh ladies everywhere that that this whole this i i guess this this people's rights lady ocean i'm a human and i'm going to do what i want to do i'm going to say what i want to do if you don't like it tough and and i got my right and i'm free what what happened to yeah i'm free but i'm going to respect your wife that's right i'm not going to cut in front of your way you know i'm not going to i'm not going to to do things i dealt with a young man today i could have judged him for a lot of things i'm sure you know his hair might have been a little long and you know if he didn't actually wear all the type of clothes i would but nice young man if he had enough decency about him he wouldn't sit down without asking me if he could sit down i thought you know lord put a star on his side give him a blessing you know what i mean it it's something when you see something else out there and the reason i'm saying this is because the challenge of the human factor is fixing to hit our lives worse than ever worse than ever and if we don't get caught up we're going to get in a war with it we're going to be in a battle with it it's going to discourage us it's going to bring us down it's going to rob us of our joy it's going to rob us of our peace and then you just think you think well i'm just going to go live out in the woods and you'll go out and live out in the woods and some herman will come and cap next door to you and give you a hard time you're we're not going to escape it right but we've got to come to the point that we are so solid in the word of god we understand what it is that we're representing what is our challenge and our our challenge is to rise above it and we'll will read another scripture and and be done so paul's talking here as meat to idols he says now he says now is touching things offered to idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edith and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love god the same is known of him any man love god the same is known of him i don't want to be known by my reactions to humans because humans bug me humans make me think bad humans make me utter things under my breath humans are humans i can't forget that i too as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be god's many and lords many but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we buy him how be it there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscious conscience of the idol unto this hour eat as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat condemneth us not to god for neither if we eat are we better neither if we eat not are we the worst take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak for if any men see thee which hath knowledge sit it meat in the idol's temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboiled to eat those things embolden excuse me to eat those swings which are awful to idols and though and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died but when we but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience you sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to a fan what a consciousness what an awareness of really what your mission is really what what it is that that real christianity comes it's not living on to yourself it's living unto others is being aware of the decisions you make aware of the adjustments to make the the aware of whether you're stumbling somebody it's the recognition that there's people out there that are weak and their conscience is easily offended that they get offended very easily you say something they're offended their feelings get hurt if you have real feelings to get real hurt real easy you don't want to spend a lot of time around me because i'm a wrecking ball i don't mean to be that way you know i just say stuff and i just mean it jokingly you know what i mean and and you know i might come up to you and say you know there ain't much difference looking between you and a mule and a horse you know or you know it's a any old crazy thing just to be friendly but if you're easily offended right you know what i mean it can you get hurt i got to pull back wait a minute that's just human humans get easily offended i got to be careful i don't stumble there's an awareness about me in other words all of our christianity can't be doctrinal it all can't be it all can't be uh supernatural we can't all of a sudden think that we're above everybody else around us and and we're living with all this low life act and all these people that don't have knowledge and and and and if they knew what i knew then they wouldn't think the way that they think that's not what we're called to do we're called to say how do they think i'm going to adjust myself that i i don't offend them because if i offend the conscience of the weaker i offend the lord i'm not going to take what i'm capable of doing i don't care you might be you might be capable you know of of doing a certain activity that i could never do i got sucked into playing a board game one time this demonology game called risk well i got sucked into that game about three hours later i realized i was wiped out i condemned that game right there so no believer plays that game that game straight from the pits no you might be able to play that game don't invite me over don't offend me you know there's a lot of things you find out about people they don't live the way you do they don't live the way you do they don't have the holiness standards you have they don't have the drive for the gospel that you got they don't have the dedication to listening to tapes you have they don't have the dedication of reading the bible if you're not careful pretty soon they offend you and you start judging them what is it to you if he till i come follow me what i'm saying these little foxes this thing that goes unnoticed that's happening in our hearts and happening in our minds the effect that the human factor has on us if we're not careful it's going to keep us from attaining that capstone pyramid that we're all after isn't that what we're really after is perfect love you say why are we after perfect love because without perfect love you won't be there without conquering the human factor without conquering the effect that negative humans human actions human thinking human discernment human opinion without without being able to see it coming understand the trap of it re-like it doesn't have to affect you you can let things go you can turn the other cheat if they give a scriptural inquiry give them a scriptural answer pray that you might know how to answer all men but think it's not strange of the fiery darts of the enemy and who did most of those fiery darts come from i have not seen a devil floating around shooting arrows but i've seen it come off the lips of people the actions of people the unrighteousness of people the way people do things and this this struck my heart because i bought a person a gift one time very very nice gift i appreciated the brother he did a lot for me and he was a good friend and and he was quite the hunter so i got a bow and arrow uh form you know the best that i thought money could buy and talk to somebody and all that of course i gave it to him right so whose was it when i gave it to him it was his right it was mine while i had it but i gave it to him well am i gonna i got all tied up in a knot and i got all bummed out and i got all discouraged because he went and sold it well i probably would have given him the money but i let that's a humanism you understand he didn't think oh this was a gift from brother david and and i wanted him to be the gift you know and this is the gift brother david gave me and and you know look at this fine this fine gift here and i killed this deer with the bo brother david gave me okay so right in the whole thing was my humanism was all my humanism reacted in it so when he didn't react to my humanism i let his humanism give me and now the very thing that i set out to do got all messed up if i could have stood back and said okay he probably needed that money more than he needed about he was maybe under a very difficult circumstance in his life and this was a way out without embarrassing him or whatever i don't know the human factor but i can got to come to the place where i separate myself from what the human factor is it's everywhere i've got to set my wings and rise above it and let's read these last scriptures as we close this evening on just a little middle of the week bible study so that uh you know we don't always have to have a great big sermon let's turn to matthew and brother steve can come up and get ready to lead us in a couple songs for it's a great read just to go back and and read the uh the sermon on the mount and and the the five uh five six and seventh chapters of matthew but let's turn to matthew the fifth chapter and the awareness of the human factor let's read in matthew 5. i just hope tonight these words will sink in and come to your thought in your mind in circumstances that come around you the musicians you can come to so let's turn and read this in closing to see me it says and if any men sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also tell me that ain't a human factor if somebody sues you at the law for thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asked thee and from him that would borrow he have heard it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i send you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now that is overcoming the human factor because all those things he talked about are what humans do and this is what he's telling us because he wants us to be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect but i sand you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if we love them which love you for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same now this is the separation of humanism we're never going to send the message of the gospel the evidence of the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how rich religious we are until we can get the spirit of god in us that separates us from the humanism we love them that hate us how many loves to love them that hate you no you don't but how can you say that you love god and hate your brother love a god you can't see at the end and after and and say you know and say you hate your brother who you do see and that that's that's the point i know i'm fundam you know making it elementary because i want it to reach everybody but this is what's happening because the separation from the publican the separation from the sinner the only thing that separates you from anybody else is not the religion that's going on in your mind it's not your doctrines it's not your teachings it's your ability to separate yourself from human action that's where it stands and it's not easy but that's what's given to the overcomer to him that overcometh i will have him sit with me in my father's throne be really aware of what it is that we're having to overcome because it's coming for us it's coming forth people are changing their attitudes and workplace business people people are just out flat out not paying people now they're they're they're they're that they'll they'll they'll crook you they'll lie you they'll they'll all kinds of things that they'll say all manner of evil against you and jesus reviled not when he was spoken up you know what he he held his peace we could read many scriptures but the the evidence is we talk a lot about the evidence we want all the evidence to be in the supernatural but what good does it do if we have all this super natural evidence which the world doesn't believe and doesn't see if we can't show them a light in the world that they're living and that's where he said is to let your light shine in darkness and jesus was the light of men and why was he the light of man because he overcame the world that was his testimony he overcame humanism he turned the other chief what do you think the world is it's humanism another week we can accept other people's humanism but we don't want to accept our humanism we want to bring our humanism under subjection and be christlike we want to get to where what he's talking about here how do you be like your father in heaven you can't let everybody burn you all the time you can't be offended blessed is he who is not offended in me you can't form clicks you can't talk about people you can't do these little things that eat you up spiritually because i really think it's time to climb don't you he said if you love if you 46 for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which in heaven is perfect you know you you you look at all the great things that are going into the statue of a perfect man you get up to godliness and to be like god and it's finally capped off with perfect love perfect love brotherly kindness those are the virtues that keep the negative effect of humanism working in our lives it's what causes you to create an atmosphere because they wonder what is this hope why do you act different why don't you gossip like the rest of the girls why aren't you mean sure it's easy to pick out somebody that's a little uh less talented or socially skilled than you are and make fun of them that don't make you popular [Music] you know to tease somebody about their weight or the the way their hair is or their no hair or whatever none of that that there's just a place that we can rise up where there's a freedom [Music] and and there's a freedom in having the love of god in your heart being pitiful you know i mean and having pity and realizing you know that people show up and they don't tell the truth and they say they can do things that they really can't do and you just gotta take a deep breath say lord it's just the world it's just humans the prophet of god talked about letting off the pressure he says people are just going they're they're speeding up and down the streets they've gone mad don't let it strike you church realize when you walk out these doors i hope that it'll set in your hearts tonight that you understand you're just gonna have to deal with the world because you're in the world but you're not of the world but you're overcomers of this world and that's been our great portion god bless you let's stand tonight maybe tonight just as we're gonna close and maybe i wasn't able tonight to draw it as clear as i realized it is with me and you know it it's always in your life i got a new chest of drawers and so i put my socks on the top drawer and unless he felt they were too high so she put him on the next drawer down where i could see him well i want him on the top drawer well she thinks they'd be better on it so you know what okay that's fine they're just socks i only wear socks to church i don't care what drawer the socks are in stop a minute you know what i mean if if she feels the socks should be on the second drawer instead of the top door great you know she's shorter than i am at the eyes so she can't see him well who really folds them who washes them who puts them up she does [Music] i don't do my own socks sister so if you got a husband that does his own socks you thank god forums now you guys ought to do your own socks and not make your mama do them [Music] but yeah because someday you might live alone you know what i mean you'll find out that you get tired of wearing them dirty old socks you know you've got to wash them now and then but what i'm saying is we don't even put on the mind of christ if humanism reacting to humanism just bad we're so quick to answer so quick to defend so quick to take a position we don't got no position we just want him we want his love shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit if you'd like more of of him let's just bow our heads you lift your heart you don't have to lift your hand unless you want to you really want to let him know but you want to rise above humanism and you want to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and you want to mind spiritual things because the carnal mind is at enmity with god's thinking but you want to put this mind in you that was in christ that every man looketh upon the thoughts and the needs of others before himself now we're getting into real bride material and you just like to say lord i really like to be able to respond better i'd like to be able to read back better i i'd like to have a greater awareness of the human factor and if there's a human factor then there's got to be a word factor there's got to be a scriptural approach there's got to be a spiritual mind for every matter lord and i want that to be first in my heart i want to be first in my mind i want it to be first in my life father i really want to grow lord and i want to rise above the human factor heavenly father as we lift our hands and we approach you [Music] you know the human part of every single one of us that's why you provided forgiveness [Music] that's why you say do unto others as you would have them do unto you that's why you said if you're compelled to go the mile go twain so many things you spoke of about speaking not again blessed are ye when all men shall speak evil of you for my name's sake great is your reward [Music] father forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us so many places out to the scriptures in fact sometimes the whole scriptures just seem to cry out at us with instructions how to overcome the human factor lord and that's our desire tonight as this church lord that our sound doctrine would be accompanied by a sound spiritual spirit of divine love we ask that you would grant these things to us in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen is that creating me a clean heart let's sing that as brothers jesus comes [Music] creating me [Music] within me me [Music] within me oh [Music] glory [Music] me [Music] within me [Music] me [Music] ask me [Music] is [Music] this is my [Music] all i have

desire low me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all i have within me [Music] [Music] all that i am [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music]
