[16:24] bow our heads and commit the service to

[16:26] [Music]
[16:27] we've gathered here
[16:30] everything's in order
[16:32] we want to welcome his presence
[16:35] we've done all that we can do and now we
[16:36] depend upon him
[16:39] that the service may be done according
[16:40] to his will let's just commit it to him
[16:43] father we love you and we thank you for
[16:45] this another opportunity to be gathered
[16:46] together around your word
[16:49] lord to fellowship around the work that
[16:51] you've done in each of our hearts
[16:53] lord to use the opportunity to lift up
[16:56] your name and to worship you
[16:58] lord not just in song not just in
[17:00] worship but with our lives
[17:02] lord we pray that we just lord that your
[17:05] service would be done according to your
[17:06] will lord may your word have the
[17:08] preeminence
[17:09] lord may every spirit that would stand
[17:11] against your word
[17:12] be taken under the dominion of the word
[17:14] and rebuke from this place father we
[17:16] just want to welcome your presence you
[17:18] know every need
[17:19] you know already know the work that you
[17:21] want done
[17:22] and we pray that you would have it done
[17:24] according to your will in jesus name
[17:26] amen
[17:29] y'all can go ahead and be seated here to
[17:31] get a load off we're going to be
[17:33] turning to psalm 119 here in a second
[17:35] picking up in
[17:36] verse 161
[17:39] and i was just reading that the other
[17:41] day and
[17:42] you know i noticed as you read psalm 119
[17:45] you know nine times
[17:47] the writer speaks about having a love
[17:50] for the word
[17:53] you know he uses statements like oh how
[17:55] i love thy law
[17:57] it is my meditation all the day
[18:01] he says therefore i love thy
[18:03] commandments above gold
[18:06] yea then fine gold
[18:09] you know three of those times are here
[18:11] in just this little eight verse section
[18:15] of psalm 119
[18:17] he says in verse 163 i hate and abhor
[18:20] lying
[18:21] but thy law do i love
[18:24] he says in verse 167 my soul hath kept
[18:27] thy testimonies
[18:29] and i love them
[18:31] exceedingly
[18:34] but he says this he makes an interesting
[18:36] statement in verse 165
[18:38] and this verse just caught my attention
[18:41] it says great peace
[18:43] have they which love thy law
[18:47] and nothing
[18:50] nothing
[18:51] shall offend them
[18:55] nothing
[18:57] you know that's quite a statement
[19:00] he talks about both having great peace
[19:04] and having nothing offend you
[19:06] because you love his word
[19:09] you know we live in an age of great
[19:11] trouble
[19:13] you know there's
[19:15] just have to read down the headlines of
[19:17] any newspaper or news website i mean
[19:19] it's nothing but you know everything
[19:21] from political trouble to global trouble
[19:24] to financial trouble to
[19:26] you know
[19:26] moral trouble to family trouble to
[19:29] economic trouble
[19:32] it's just trouble on every side
[19:36] you know there are voices that are
[19:37] trying to tell us to be worried about
[19:39] one thing
[19:42] or to be concerned about the next
[19:44] or to plan for something else
[19:48] you know if we're not careful we can
[19:49] become affected by all the trouble
[19:53] and it can cause us to think
[19:56] or to act
[19:57] or to say
[19:59] something different than what the word
[20:02] would say
[20:05] you know the word may declare one thing
[20:07] but the trouble may try to drive us to
[20:09] do something else
[20:12] you know there's no promise that we as
[20:14] believers would be free from trouble
[20:17] you know in fact the this passage here
[20:19] begins in verse 161 it says princes have
[20:22] persecuted me without a cause
[20:26] princes
[20:27] spiritual wickedness in high places
[20:30] surrounding us with trouble for no
[20:32] reason other than who you are and where
[20:34] you live
[20:38] but you know it's interesting that we
[20:40] have an answer to the trouble
[20:43] and it's having a love
[20:46] for the word
[20:49] not a book not texts or quotes but a
[20:52] love for that part of himself that he
[20:54] has made known to you
[20:59] great peace
[21:00] have they which love
[21:03] thy law
[21:06] in first john 4 17
[21:09] makes an interesting statement it says
[21:11] herein
[21:13] is our love
[21:14] made perfect
[21:16] complete
[21:18] that we may have boldness
[21:21] in the day of judgment
[21:25] because as he is
[21:28] so are we in this world
[21:32] there is no fear
[21:35] in love
[21:37] but perfect love
[21:40] casteth out fear
[21:44] because fear
[21:45] hath torment
[21:48] he that feareth
[21:50] is not made perfect
[21:52] in love
[21:54] now notice he's not talking about his
[21:56] perfect love he's talking about yours
[22:00] ours
[22:02] you know fear is torment that is the
[22:05] opposite
[22:06] of great peace
[22:08] amen
[22:10] notice there is no fear
[22:13] no torment
[22:15] in love
[22:18] great peace
[22:20] have they
[22:21] that love
[22:22] thy law
[22:25] perfect love
[22:26] casteth out
[22:28] all fear
[22:31] the whole heart like we talked about
[22:33] last time a perfect heart complete and
[22:35] total love
[22:37] for the
[22:38] word nothing held back
[22:41] he that feareth is not made perfect
[22:45] love
[22:47] you know
[22:48] whether what what you're the status of
[22:51] your love is
[22:53] by the status of your peace
[22:56] the one is used to measure the other
[22:59] herein
[23:00] is i love is perfect love
[23:03] herein is our love made perfect
[23:10] how many can say that we're in a day of
[23:12] great trouble
[23:14] of judgment
[23:16] the question that i had as i read that
[23:19] do i have great peace
[23:23] do i have
[23:25] perfect love
[23:28] do i love the word with my whole heart
[23:32] you see the extent that i do the one
[23:34] is the extent to which i have the other
[23:38] proverbs 3 says my son forget not my law
[23:42] my word
[23:44] but let thine heart
[23:46] not thy mind
[23:48] but thy heart the center of thy desire
[23:52] center of your love
[23:54] keep my commandments
[23:56] for length of days and long life and
[23:59] peace
[24:00] shall they add to thee
[24:02] you know the scriptures don't make any
[24:04] promise that will be a free of trouble
[24:05] but it does say that we can get to such
[24:08] a place
[24:10] where we love his word
[24:12] which is himself
[24:14] so completely
[24:16] so perfectly that while we may have
[24:18] trouble
[24:20] we will not be troubled
[24:24] but great peace it's not a mind thing
[24:27] it's not because we've got it all
[24:29] figured out
[24:30] but it's a heart thing
[24:32] it's because of where the center of our
[24:34] desire is
[24:37] you know paul
[24:39] after speaking about this treasure that
[24:41] we have in earthly vessels he said in
[24:43] second corinthians 4 8 we are troubled
[24:45] on every side
[24:48] yet not distressed
[24:51] we are perplexed
[24:53] but not in despair
[24:56] in colossians 3 he said but let the
[24:59] peace of god rule
[25:02] in your hearts
[25:05] not our minds
[25:06] but our hearts
[25:09] if we continue reading here in psalm 119
[25:12] it says great peace have they which love
[25:14] thy law and nothing
[25:16] not one single thing shall offend them
[25:20] you know that word offend means to
[25:21] stumble
[25:23] to get out of step
[25:25] to get tripped up
[25:27] to change how you walk
[25:30] jesus made the statement in matthew 11
[25:33] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[25:35] offended in me
[25:37] you know sometimes we read that and we
[25:39] think about that he's speaking about
[25:40] getting offended by the word
[25:43] but he said blessed is he who is not
[25:46] offended in me
[25:47] not by me
[25:49] what that means is that we can be to
[25:51] such a place in him
[25:54] that we have no offense
[25:56] that nothing will offend thee
[26:00] blessed is he who is not offended
[26:03] in
[26:04] me
[26:05] having such a love for the word
[26:07] that nothing shall offend thee
[26:12] you know he spoke of our jesus spoke of
[26:14] our hour in matthew 24 and he describing
[26:16] all the troubles of the hour we live in
[26:20] and one of the things he said is this he
[26:22] said in verse 10 and then shall many be
[26:25] offended
[26:27] and shall betray one another and shall
[26:29] hate one another and i just read that
[26:31] thought if that isn't our hour
[26:33] i don't know what is
[26:36] but blessed is he who is not offended
[26:39] in me
[26:42] so there's a reason you know as i was
[26:44] reading this we can go ahead and stand
[26:48] you know there's a reason that at the
[26:49] very top of the stature of the perfect
[26:52] man
[26:53] is love
[26:56] you know i don't know about you
[26:59] but i want to get to such a place of
[27:01] love
[27:03] of that word
[27:06] that i can have great peace
[27:09] that nothing
[27:11] can offend me
[27:13] i know i'm not there right yet
[27:15] but i hope
[27:17] that
[27:17] that's your prayer this morning is to
[27:19] get to that place in him
[27:22] that nothing
[27:23] shall offend you
[27:26] that great peace have they which love
[27:29] thy law
[27:30] so as i was reading that
[27:32] you know the other day i thought i want
[27:33] to be one of those people
[27:35] that it's speaking of in the scripture
[27:37] don't you
[27:38] let's just read that section of psalm
[27:40] 119 this morning just 161-168
[27:44] let's read that together princes have
[27:46] persecuted me without a cause but my
[27:49] heart standeth in awe of thy word i
[27:52] rejoice at thy word as one that findeth
[27:55] great spoil
[27:56] i hate and abhor lying but thy law do i
[27:59] love
[28:00] seven times a day do i praise thee
[28:02] because of thy righteous judgments great
[28:05] peace have they which love thy law and
[28:08] nothing shall offend them
[28:10] lord i have hoped for thy salvation and
[28:12] thy commandments my soul hath kept thy
[28:15] testimonies and i love them exceedingly
[28:18] i have kept thy precepts and thy
[28:20] testimonies for all my ways are before
[28:23] thee amen

[58:44] blessed and precious name
[58:46] of our lord and savior jesus christ we
[58:49] pray
[58:50] amen

[59:02] lord is your portion i'm getting a lot
[59:05] of rebound here can you you're working
[59:07] on it
[59:08] sometimes i think it's just me
[59:10] i'm kind of hollow up here so
[59:13] the sound kind of echoes back and forth
[59:16] let's turn in our bibles this morning
[59:22] [Music]
[59:26] if if we would
[59:28] and uh
[59:30] [Music]
[59:33] let's just read over here just one quick
[59:35] scripture
[59:37] uh for a scripture reading and
[59:40] and then
[59:43] we'll go
[59:45] return back to it
[59:47] let's read in just corrin
[59:49] and all the members of that one body
[59:53] being many
[59:55] are one body
[59:58] all
[59:59] so also
[1:00:00] is
[1:00:01] christ heavenly father we ask you to
[1:00:03] bless your word to us your precious name
[1:00:05] we pray amen god bless you may be seated
[1:00:15] we we certainly
[1:00:17] appreciate all of you uh
[1:00:20] walking down the street and up from the
[1:00:23] parking lots and
[1:00:25] we have a a little bit of parking open
[1:00:28] now on the dirt for a little while and
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] we appreciate you parking in the dirt
[1:00:35] and
[1:00:36] doing all the things that we have to
[1:00:38] suffer
[1:00:39] as we go through this time but
[1:00:43] you know the inward rewards are
[1:00:46] wonderful
[1:00:48] and the grace of god
[1:00:50] is so sufficient
[1:00:52] um
[1:00:53] and so we wanted uh fellowship a little
[1:00:57] bit this morning i don't know if it'll
[1:00:58] be
[1:01:00] like a bible teaching or not you know
[1:01:03] i'm certainly by no means an evangelist
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:09] i i don't have the energy anymore to run
[1:01:12] from
[1:01:12] one side i kind of uh envious of those
[1:01:16] guys that can
[1:01:17] you know
[1:01:18] just go and go but
[1:01:20] uh
[1:01:21] i i hope that
[1:01:23] by experience i've learned to work
[1:01:26] smarter and not harder
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:30] so
[1:01:30] maybe that's what i can bring to the
[1:01:33] table
[1:01:34] i i
[1:01:36] not deep or complicated
[1:01:39] life to me is always been i've just
[1:01:42] dealt with what's in front of me
[1:01:45] and it never mattered to me
[1:01:48] how it got there
[1:01:50] it is what it is and uh so
[1:01:54] that's what you have to confront
[1:01:57] uh there's not a lot of virtue
[1:02:00] in complaining
[1:02:02] i was reading in uh well i listened to
[1:02:05] yesterday uh the little sermon called
[1:02:08] uniting time and sign
[1:02:11] and in the beginning of that message the
[1:02:13] prophet of god is is talking about
[1:02:15] himself and
[1:02:17] in how that when he
[1:02:19] gets wore out and tore down
[1:02:21] he gets what he called the blues and he
[1:02:24] said you get to that place that you
[1:02:27] don't feel that
[1:02:29] anybody cares for you
[1:02:31] or you don't know whether you're on the
[1:02:33] right track or
[1:02:35] and it's just kind of a burden he says
[1:02:37] now you all have it he says but i just
[1:02:40] got a double dose of it
[1:02:43] he said but there's one thing he said i
[1:02:45] never
[1:02:47] he says complaining all it does is
[1:02:50] destroys faith
[1:02:53] that's all it does it just breaks down
[1:02:55] your faith and he said i
[1:02:58] i never he says and when you the older
[1:03:01] you get the harder those burdens are to
[1:03:04] bear and he says and he says i want to
[1:03:07] bear my burden
[1:03:09] he says i don't want to be crowned with
[1:03:11] a crabby old spirit
[1:03:14] he says that's the worst thing that i
[1:03:16] can think of in life is coming at the
[1:03:19] end of your road
[1:03:20] and having a crabby
[1:03:22] complaining
[1:03:25] spirit he says i want my life to be
[1:03:28] crowned with peace and joy
[1:03:31] patience long-suffering
[1:03:33] and love he said that's the crown of
[1:03:35] life
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:37] i would like to have
[1:03:40] and i think those are the important
[1:03:42] things that uh
[1:03:45] that
[1:03:46] we strive for
[1:03:48] and i thought you know that's a that was
[1:03:50] a great thought and i thought it was a
[1:03:52] good advice to have while you're young
[1:03:56] don't complain
[1:03:58] because it's just going to ruin your
[1:04:01] faith
[1:04:02] and you're going to turn out to be an
[1:04:04] old crab
[1:04:08] anybody want to end up being an old crab
[1:04:11] i've met a few crabby people
[1:04:15] you know i have a crabby person one time
[1:04:17] look at me and say you're the devil
[1:04:22] you know
[1:04:23] and in my heart i i might have thought
[1:04:26] well you're an old crab
[1:04:29] right but i don't want to be crowned
[1:04:31] like that
[1:04:32] i want to sit back and say that's the
[1:04:34] human factor
[1:04:36] that's human i don't have to i don't
[1:04:38] have to go there i don't have to defend
[1:04:41] myself he'll defend that
[1:04:44] amen my job is to create an atmosphere
[1:04:48] of love
[1:04:49] of peace my job is to to radiate what
[1:04:54] he's done
[1:04:55] for me
[1:04:56] my job is to express
[1:04:59] that i have confidence that i'm in the
[1:05:02] palm of his hand
[1:05:04] and nothing can pluck me out
[1:05:06] my job is to say that no matter what
[1:05:09] this life brings i have a mansion
[1:05:12] waiting for me i'm not staying here i'm
[1:05:15] going
[1:05:16] and that's why we firmly believe that
[1:05:18] this is a
[1:05:20] a leaving message
[1:05:23] it's not a staying message
[1:05:25] i'd like to just
[1:05:27] read just a couple
[1:05:28] statements this morning because i think
[1:05:31] it's important
[1:05:32] that our emphasis is
[1:05:35] is you know
[1:05:37] is is
[1:05:38] uh
[1:05:39] is the rapture
[1:05:42] our emphasis isn't on the revival
[1:05:45] our emphasis is on the rapture
[1:05:48] it doesn't good the revivals come and go
[1:05:52] but the rapture is a sure thing
[1:05:56] and that's what we want to make sure
[1:05:59] that we're making
[1:06:01] and we want to have a greater
[1:06:03] understanding
[1:06:04] of what our
[1:06:06] qualifications are
[1:06:09] to be a part of that rapture
[1:06:12] that's what we understand and we realize
[1:06:15] that what our message was it was a
[1:06:18] message that came to call a people out
[1:06:22] to separate a people because there was
[1:06:25] fixing to be an exodus
[1:06:28] and so we we know we study our messenger
[1:06:31] came to us and he laid out to us the
[1:06:34] three exoduses how the the three times
[1:06:37] of the church that the church made great
[1:06:40] moves and that they left one
[1:06:45] dispensation
[1:06:46] can move into another dispensation
[1:06:49] and how every time that the church moved
[1:06:52] from one dispensation
[1:06:54] to another from the from the law to
[1:06:58] grace in the type of coming out of egypt
[1:07:01] that there was a a messenger that god
[1:07:05] came and veiled himself in flesh
[1:07:09] to be a sign to the people
[1:07:11] that there is a there's a transition
[1:07:15] taking
[1:07:16] fixing to take place and don't miss it
[1:07:20] and and so we understand in moses as
[1:07:23] exodus uh there were so many types that
[1:07:25] was a natural physical exodus from a
[1:07:29] one land to a promised land from a land
[1:07:34] of bondage to a land of promise
[1:07:38] from a land of
[1:07:39] slavery and bricks and
[1:07:42] to a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:07:46] and there was a god came and veiled
[1:07:49] himself
[1:07:50] in the flesh of moses and did signs and
[1:07:53] wonders to prove to them to get ready
[1:07:56] can we understand the getting ready for
[1:07:59] that rapture
[1:08:00] or that exodus to them it was a rapture
[1:08:04] the rapture from slavery to freedom from
[1:08:08] from working for someone else's land for
[1:08:12] working in their own land that great
[1:08:14] exodus but there was still
[1:08:17] the getting ready was the application of
[1:08:20] the blood of the token
[1:08:23] they had to put that on the door
[1:08:26] in order to be there to make that
[1:08:29] and and
[1:08:31] if the blood had to be applied and we
[1:08:34] understand in our day the token has got
[1:08:37] to be applied
[1:08:38] the word of god has got to be applied we
[1:08:41] understand the second exodus was from
[1:08:44] law
[1:08:45] and the bondage of sin
[1:08:48] into a spirit-filled life by the grace
[1:08:52] of god and the purchase price of calvary
[1:08:56] and once again god came and veiled
[1:08:58] himself in flesh
[1:09:01] and paid a price for us
[1:09:03] that we could pass through from the
[1:09:06] wages of sin which was death to the gift
[1:09:10] of god which was eternal life
[1:09:14] and and what a what a beautiful thing
[1:09:17] that it is to be free he can still tempt
[1:09:21] us
[1:09:23] he can still draw us away after after
[1:09:26] the flesh
[1:09:27] but but he's not going to rule and reign
[1:09:31] in the lives of the born again he is not
[1:09:34] going to do it because that that soul
[1:09:37] and that life has been purchased by the
[1:09:40] lamb of god it's been purchased by the
[1:09:43] blood of god and so we understand that
[1:09:46] we saw that he came down in an in a body
[1:09:49] and a sacrifice
[1:09:51] and that was an exodus from law to grace
[1:09:54] to the baptism of the holy spirit to the
[1:09:57] union of god and man together as one now
[1:10:01] there's there's come another
[1:10:05] sign
[1:10:06] that god veiled himself again in flesh
[1:10:09] in our day
[1:10:11] in the ministry of the son of man
[1:10:14] the rein re-impersonation
[1:10:17] of the ministry of jesus christ that was
[1:10:20] to the jews that same ministry
[1:10:24] was
[1:10:25] re-impersonated in our day
[1:10:27] because the same god that dwelt in him
[1:10:31] veiled himself
[1:10:34] in a prophetic ministry a prophesied
[1:10:37] ministry behold i will send you elijah
[1:10:40] the prophet as it was in the days of the
[1:10:43] voice of the seventh angel
[1:10:47] as it was in the days of sodom and
[1:10:49] gomorrah so shall it be in the
[1:10:52] revelation of the son of man we saw
[1:10:54] those promises and then we saw that
[1:10:57] promised ministry
[1:10:59] and those spoken scriptures we saw those
[1:11:03] very promises that were written in the
[1:11:06] word of god we saw them manifest in
[1:11:10] flesh
[1:11:11] there they were in human form
[1:11:16] in a body
[1:11:18] and the body
[1:11:19] was doing the same science the same
[1:11:22] works preaching the same gospel
[1:11:26] trying to restore back to us
[1:11:30] the same faith
[1:11:32] that we would recognize that there's
[1:11:34] fixing to be an exodus
[1:11:39] and that our faith would
[1:11:42] uh
[1:11:43] move in us so much by revelation
[1:11:47] that it would bring us to the place of
[1:11:50] preparation
[1:11:52] another that we've we've seen the word
[1:11:55] manifested
[1:11:57] we've seen it come to pass exactly what
[1:12:00] was said the church world didn't
[1:12:03] they they're still looking back
[1:12:05] at the the second exodus
[1:12:10] they didn't recognize yes
[1:12:14] that when
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:17] foolish virgins
[1:12:19] go after the
[1:12:20] oil that's when he comes
[1:12:26] he he comes
[1:12:28] he comes to unite himself he comes to
[1:12:31] become one with those that that hear his
[1:12:34] voice and and are called out he he comes
[1:12:37] and he he manifests himself and here he
[1:12:40] comes in our generation doing the same
[1:12:43] things
[1:12:44] turning us back to the audience just
[1:12:46] like sarah in the tent
[1:12:48] talking to the woman at the well
[1:12:50] just like jesus talked to the women to
[1:12:52] the well catching the spirit everything
[1:12:55] about the ministry was identical
[1:13:00] to
[1:13:02] the exodus
[1:13:03] from
[1:13:04] law into grace
[1:13:06] every bit of it was identical to every
[1:13:09] exodus before because if he ever does
[1:13:13] one thing one way he's got to continue
[1:13:16] to do it the same way and we know that
[1:13:19] god works in threes we will not get into
[1:13:21] biblical numerology this morning but
[1:13:25] what what the the understanding that
[1:13:28] we're wanting to place on is that
[1:13:33] our revival
[1:13:35] is the rapture
[1:13:39] i mean that's
[1:13:41] that's what it's all about
[1:13:45] and that's a place that we have to be
[1:13:48] led to
[1:13:50] we've got to be prepared for
[1:13:54] we've got to be transformed
[1:13:57] to that condition
[1:13:59] this is something that i always keep in
[1:14:01] my heart
[1:14:02] that the rapture isn't an event it's a
[1:14:06] condition
[1:14:07] you're in rapturing condition it's
[1:14:10] rapturing faith you're in expectation
[1:14:14] you're in anticipation you're looking
[1:14:17] for it you believe that it's real
[1:14:20] you're not wait and see when i see it
[1:14:23] i'll believe it no you it it's the
[1:14:26] evidence of something that you're hoping
[1:14:29] for you know the rapture's coming i know
[1:14:31] i'm going to be a part of it
[1:14:34] i know i'm going to be changed i can see
[1:14:36] the world condition i can see the sodom
[1:14:39] condition i i can see the
[1:14:42] the the lack of the love of word you
[1:14:45] know the brothers came back from israel
[1:14:48] and you know what the okay the the
[1:14:51] israeli people
[1:14:54] are realizing
[1:14:56] that they're going to have to change
[1:14:58] their commerce
[1:15:01] because they no longer can rely on
[1:15:04] christian
[1:15:05] tourists
[1:15:07] because christianity is declining in the
[1:15:11] world
[1:15:22] a man was speaking the other day and
[1:15:24] there this is a political season
[1:15:28] and and he he made the comment he says
[1:15:31] well that candidate that's for them
[1:15:33] christians
[1:15:37] it's not the majority anymore
[1:15:39] the first time in our country's
[1:15:42] history
[1:15:45] less people go to church
[1:15:47] more people stay home now than go to
[1:15:50] church
[1:15:51] christianity
[1:15:53] is in a decline
[1:15:55] it's no longer the consciousness
[1:15:58] of the country
[1:16:01] or the nation
[1:16:03] and so this whole country saying we
[1:16:05] can't rely on them there's not enough
[1:16:07] christians anymore people aren't coming
[1:16:10] to the promised land they're not coming
[1:16:12] to to to see where jesus was
[1:16:16] well we don't want to look to where he
[1:16:18] was we want to look to where he is
[1:16:24] we don't
[1:16:26] ever want it to let us slip
[1:16:31] that this calling out is about a rapture
[1:16:36] it's not about a restoration of a
[1:16:38] revival
[1:16:40] it's not a about
[1:16:44] making
[1:16:45] and manufacturing signs and wonders
[1:16:48] signs and wonders follow the believer
[1:16:52] in other words the the spirit and the
[1:16:55] power that causes miracles is indwelling
[1:16:59] in the
[1:17:00] believer and we're going to go that
[1:17:03] direction but just listen to this
[1:17:05] statement as as he he says
[1:17:09] he says
[1:17:10] just uh just a little couple little
[1:17:12] comments about his rapture because what
[1:17:14] we're going to talk about this morning
[1:17:16] really has to do with the rapture
[1:17:19] now what did he say in revelations 10
[1:17:22] that would take place
[1:17:25] why was the trip to tucson
[1:17:29] to open to the church
[1:17:31] in the days of the messenger of the
[1:17:34] seventh angel
[1:17:36] the seventh angel message
[1:17:38] the whole word of god would be made
[1:17:41] manifest
[1:17:43] the seals
[1:17:45] that what all the stocks has left off
[1:17:49] of why
[1:17:51] and all about it
[1:17:53] would be made manifested in this time
[1:17:56] is that what the word says
[1:17:59] then we see it
[1:18:02] then where are we at see where are we at
[1:18:06] there is only one thing its harvest is
[1:18:10] here
[1:18:11] she's dead right
[1:18:13] she's ready for the coming amen
[1:18:19] dead right
[1:18:21] so in other words i i surely don't want
[1:18:23] to be sitting back
[1:18:25] and not ripening up
[1:18:30] right how do you get right
[1:18:34] by being sitting in the son
[1:18:37] you've got to sit in the presence of the
[1:18:39] s-o-n in order to get right
[1:18:44] you you want to be ripe
[1:18:49] i know some people get right by putting
[1:18:51] it in a bag and stick it in the
[1:18:52] refrigerator i just know how i want to
[1:18:54] get ripe i want to be sun-ripened
[1:18:57] what are they called the best fruit is
[1:18:59] what vine ripened i want to be vine
[1:19:02] ripened
[1:19:04] i want to be ripened because i'm
[1:19:06] attached to the vine and the life that's
[1:19:09] in the vine is in the branches
[1:19:12] and and that we have the same fruit
[1:19:16] i like this little statement
[1:19:18] he says
[1:19:22] he says no matter whether we are ready
[1:19:24] or not
[1:19:27] i thought wouldn't that make a good
[1:19:29] sermon title ready or not
[1:19:32] how many ever heard that as a kid ready
[1:19:35] or not here i come
[1:19:38] well you know what the world's in a game
[1:19:40] of hide-and-seek
[1:19:42] they're all hiding from them and we're
[1:19:45] seeking them
[1:19:48] right but ready or not this is what he's
[1:19:50] got he says no matter whether we're
[1:19:53] ready or not
[1:19:55] the lord jesus will come just the same
[1:19:59] at the appointed time we must be ready
[1:20:03] we must
[1:20:04] do it now
[1:20:06] it's no
[1:20:07] time to wait
[1:20:09] we must redeem the time and be
[1:20:14] ready
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:17] amen so this certainly talked about
[1:20:20] redeeming the time and and where we are
[1:20:23] and another part
[1:20:26] of being prepared
[1:20:28] for the rapture
[1:20:30] and and i hope that's on your heart
[1:20:32] church
[1:20:34] i i know there's a lot of directions we
[1:20:36] can go
[1:20:37] and and the world's going to lots of
[1:20:40] directions the church rules going to
[1:20:42] lots of directions
[1:20:44] but but i i honestly feel in my heart i
[1:20:47] think the most important thing that a
[1:20:50] believer can do is prepare for the
[1:20:52] rapture
[1:20:55] you know what it really means to redeem
[1:20:58] the time to make yourself ready now we
[1:21:01] want to talk a little bit today
[1:21:05] about the church
[1:21:09] now
[1:21:10] when we say church
[1:21:12] there's a lot of
[1:21:13] meanings
[1:21:15] for church
[1:21:17] and and we have a lot of
[1:21:19] ways and the word church is used in so
[1:21:22] many contexts in in so different many
[1:21:26] different ways we talked about the
[1:21:28] church and and so when we say the church
[1:21:32] many times we refer to it as the
[1:21:34] building
[1:21:36] that's a church
[1:21:38] or the church is on the corner
[1:21:40] of
[1:21:41] such and such place afghan we refer to
[1:21:44] this as as the church we're building a
[1:21:47] church
[1:21:48] well you know but that's the building
[1:21:50] but we still use the terminology church
[1:21:54] for
[1:21:55] the building the building is the church
[1:21:58] the church building uh that down over
[1:22:01] there there's a methodist church there's
[1:22:03] a
[1:22:04] a
[1:22:05] a baptist and we're referring to the
[1:22:07] building and then there's the church
[1:22:11] and that's referred to as the group of
[1:22:14] people
[1:22:16] you know we might refer to the church as
[1:22:18] the group of people
[1:22:21] the members
[1:22:23] of a certain church we might call it is
[1:22:26] the the baptist church
[1:22:29] referring to a group of members to a a
[1:22:33] group of people that believe the same
[1:22:37] thing and we might call that a a church
[1:22:42] and so
[1:22:43] an identification
[1:22:45] as a group of people so that's another
[1:22:49] way that we refer to a church you know
[1:22:53] so we refer to a church as a building
[1:22:56] refer to it as a group of people or a
[1:22:59] group of members the members of the
[1:23:01] church is is the church and we call that
[1:23:05] a church but we're interested in another
[1:23:08] church
[1:23:10] and that's the church of the called out
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:15] now that's a church
[1:23:17] i could say it like that that's a church
[1:23:20] within the church
[1:23:22] amen so we know there's the church
[1:23:25] building
[1:23:26] and in the church building there's a
[1:23:28] group of members
[1:23:30] the church and in that group of members
[1:23:33] there's another group
[1:23:35] another church that's a elected called
[1:23:38] out a group of people that have been
[1:23:41] born again
[1:23:44] so that that church that's within the
[1:23:48] church
[1:23:49] we call that church the bride
[1:23:52] that that church is an elected
[1:23:56] uh
[1:23:57] people and and so we we read that that
[1:24:00] that group or that elected
[1:24:03] uh
[1:24:04] people is is a body so we want to refer
[1:24:08] to that
[1:24:10] church that's the church that we want to
[1:24:13] contact
[1:24:14] this morning
[1:24:19] but i believe is it this morning that
[1:24:21] all of your hearts
[1:24:23] are here because you have received a
[1:24:27] revelation that god has sent a prophet
[1:24:30] messenger
[1:24:32] now some of you may be here because of
[1:24:35] your mommy and your daddy and this is
[1:24:37] where you grew up this is where your
[1:24:39] friends are and there's nothing wrong
[1:24:41] with that let me tell you that's better
[1:24:43] than
[1:24:44] than being at the bar because mommy and
[1:24:46] daddy are at the bar
[1:24:48] so we're we're
[1:24:50] we're grateful
[1:24:52] uh for those of you that come
[1:24:55] up with your parents because you want to
[1:24:57] have harmony at home but we still would
[1:25:00] like to encourage you and let you know
[1:25:03] that you can have
[1:25:06] an individual affair and relationship
[1:25:12] that faith comes by the hearing of the
[1:25:15] word of god and that our desire would be
[1:25:18] to to to preach to you and to make the
[1:25:22] gospel
[1:25:23] simple enough
[1:25:24] that that if you would incline your ear
[1:25:27] that you would hear
[1:25:29] and recognize something and that your
[1:25:31] eyes would receive eyes out
[1:25:35] and that you would see
[1:25:37] what it is that your mom and dad believe
[1:25:40] what it is that brother david's
[1:25:42] preaching
[1:25:43] to why these people come from all kinds
[1:25:46] of different walks of life all kinds of
[1:25:49] languages and and
[1:25:52] different life's experiences and
[1:25:54] different classes and have gathered
[1:25:56] themselves together why that they have a
[1:26:00] picture of the pillar of fire hanging in
[1:26:03] their church and a picture of a cloud
[1:26:05] and
[1:26:06] and
[1:26:08] this pyramid over here on the wall the
[1:26:11] statue of a perfect man
[1:26:14] what is it that's driving them
[1:26:19] and causing them
[1:26:21] to be that way
[1:26:24] and
[1:26:25] our desire would be that that would
[1:26:27] become real to you
[1:26:31] and even the very
[1:26:33] spirit that
[1:26:36] that is causing
[1:26:38] you to be here this morning that that
[1:26:41] spirit would grow in you
[1:26:43] as the scripture says that your the
[1:26:45] knowledge of your revelation might
[1:26:47] increase
[1:26:50] that you might know what the
[1:26:52] unsearchable riches
[1:26:56] of the kingdom of gods are
[1:27:00] so we all want to grow this morning
[1:27:03] we want to increase in the knowledge we
[1:27:05] want to increase in the understanding
[1:27:08] we've got we understand it's getting
[1:27:10] dark
[1:27:13] right
[1:27:14] but we know there shall be light in the
[1:27:17] evening time
[1:27:18] that god is going to provide for us a
[1:27:21] way to see by
[1:27:25] he's going to provide a voice
[1:27:27] to lead us and guide us it can in our
[1:27:30] desire
[1:27:31] no matter
[1:27:33] where that you are in your life's
[1:27:35] experience no matter where you are in
[1:27:37] your child
[1:27:39] uh in your in your growing whether
[1:27:41] you're a child adult a young adult
[1:27:44] whatever that the word of god can find a
[1:27:47] place in your heart and give you
[1:27:49] perspective to what the truth really is
[1:27:56] and you can have that
[1:27:57] we
[1:27:58] we
[1:27:59] we care about it and we try to preach
[1:28:02] the gospel in a way that it can be
[1:28:04] understood
[1:28:05] and we don't have to
[1:28:10] maybe to go
[1:28:13] so fast but
[1:28:14] uh so we we know that
[1:28:17] uh
[1:28:21] that this church
[1:28:25] the church of the firstborn
[1:28:29] the church of the elect
[1:28:32] the church of the called out
[1:28:35] is a church whose names were written
[1:28:39] on the lamb's book of life before the
[1:28:41] foundation of the world
[1:28:44] and that's what the gospel's for
[1:28:47] the gospel is
[1:28:49] to preach the word
[1:28:51] and the word goes out
[1:28:53] and finds those
[1:28:58] because faith
[1:29:00] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:29:02] word of god
[1:29:04] so blessed are the feet of those that
[1:29:07] bring the good news
[1:29:09] in fact
[1:29:10] all of us
[1:29:11] are commissioned
[1:29:13] to go into the world and spread the
[1:29:17] gospel
[1:29:18] because you've got to sow in order to
[1:29:21] read
[1:29:22] and one planet one watereth but it's god
[1:29:26] that gives the increase
[1:29:28] so never doubt who you're around can
[1:29:30] never doubt the situation that god's put
[1:29:33] you in never doubt who that you've come
[1:29:36] in contact with nobody can take your
[1:29:39] place you can reach a spot that nobody
[1:29:42] else can reach
[1:29:44] and and it should be a burning desire on
[1:29:47] our heart to find all those
[1:29:52] that
[1:29:53] god
[1:29:54] wants to share himself with
[1:29:57] and he uses you
[1:30:00] that's why he's commissioned you
[1:30:03] you say i'm not commissioned yeah you
[1:30:04] are
[1:30:08] don't look at a program
[1:30:11] you know you don't have to be hudson

[1:30:20] you know
[1:30:21] you you don't you don't have to be then
[1:30:23] be yourself
[1:30:26] be yourself
[1:30:28] your your life's journey

[1:30:33] who need the word of god
[1:30:37] amen you don't have to sell them the
[1:30:39] whole
[1:30:40] bushel basket
[1:30:43] all you have to do is let them know
[1:30:45] god's a healer
[1:30:47] god's a forgiver
[1:30:49] it'll ignite something in them
[1:30:52] it'll create a thirst the word of god
[1:30:55] says be salty it'll create a thirst in
[1:30:58] them and pretty soon they're going to
[1:30:59] inquire of you why do you have this hope

[1:31:05] and everything's gone up in price and
[1:31:08] and and uh everything's just getting
[1:31:11] more expensive and and

[1:32:20] now let's follow this because i this
[1:32:22] morning and just taking this little uh
[1:32:26] understanding what that work want to
[1:32:28] talk about just for a few moments
[1:32:31] is
[1:32:33] and
[1:32:34] i i forgot i i got these statements but
[1:32:37] then i forgot to write down what message
[1:32:40] i took them out of so i'll read them my
[1:32:42] best and
[1:32:43] and sometimes the brothers can search
[1:32:45] them out and if they find it they could
[1:32:47] put it there but
[1:32:49] this is in paragraph
[1:32:51] 16
[1:32:52] from a message
[1:32:55] now
[1:32:56] i trust that you are listening to so
[1:32:58] many tapes
[1:33:03] that you're get that you're going to be
[1:33:05] able to say i know where that's at
[1:33:14] and as i said last evening
[1:33:17] god has allotted that
[1:33:19] his scripture
[1:33:21] from the beginning
[1:33:23] before there was any time
[1:33:27] when he was eternal
[1:33:30] he is the eternal one
[1:33:33] and then these things that happening now
[1:33:37] are only the attributes of god's
[1:33:41] thinking
[1:33:44] now that's things both good and bad
[1:33:48] in other words god's omnipotent he's not
[1:33:51] present he's all-knowing he knew that
[1:33:54] satan
[1:33:57] right
[1:33:58] would
[1:34:00] distort the word
[1:34:02] he knew he was a liar amen
[1:34:06] he knew what would transpire did you
[1:34:09] guys find that that quick
[1:34:11] took me hours to find it
[1:34:17] so he knew it
[1:34:19] so remember even the darkness that's
[1:34:22] here
[1:34:23] god knew the darkness was here because
[1:34:26] he had planned the law of contrast
[1:34:30] amen he wanted you to stand out he
[1:34:34] wanted you to be different he wanted you
[1:34:37] to reflect something different
[1:34:41] well you think well i'm different i
[1:34:42] don't want to be different i don't want
[1:34:44] to wear a dress i don't want to have
[1:34:46] long hair i don't want to not go to
[1:34:48] these sporting events i don't want to
[1:34:51] not do this i don't want to be different
[1:34:53] well he made you different
[1:34:56] and you'll never be happy until you
[1:34:59] accept your difference
[1:35:06] i mean
[1:35:09] i got a big nose
[1:35:12] i learned to accept that a long time ago
[1:35:16] i am not going to go spend 60 000
[1:35:19] to change
[1:35:20] something that's not going to help me
[1:35:22] anyway
[1:35:23] you either like me or don't like me my
[1:35:26] nose isn't the reason for that
[1:35:28] i'm the reason for that oh it's my
[1:35:31] atmosphere it's my first impression it's
[1:35:34] my attitude it's my nature it's what i
[1:35:37] correct
[1:35:38] what i create
[1:35:41] you'll kill yourself trying to change
[1:35:43] something that's continually changing
[1:35:49] you spend all the time you want in the
[1:35:51] gym your hair's still gonna fall out
[1:36:00] you know what i mean i don't care you
[1:36:02] can fast all you want you're still going
[1:36:04] to go from a size 29 to a thigh 36.
[1:36:11] just wait a while
[1:36:16] you know you can build all your muscles
[1:36:19] up here you want but eventually they end
[1:36:21] up down here
[1:36:29] so we might as well get on the right
[1:36:30] page right
[1:36:32] we might as well get rid of the
[1:36:33] carnality
[1:36:35] might as well get rid of what the world
[1:36:37] thinks you are different
[1:36:40] you're oddballs
[1:36:42] you were created oddballs
[1:36:44] you were created to be different
[1:36:50] okay you are just
[1:36:53] the manifestation
[1:36:56] of god's thinking amen
[1:37:01] you're what he thought
[1:37:04] when he looked up there he didn't see
[1:37:07] marilyn monroe
[1:37:08] or barbie doll
[1:37:10] he saw you
[1:37:12] however you are whether you like it or
[1:37:15] not that's what he saw that's the way
[1:37:18] that's why you're the way you are
[1:37:20] because that's the way he wanted you to
[1:37:23] be
[1:37:24] and he thinks it's beautiful
[1:37:30] why satan say you're not beautiful
[1:37:34] all they see is these advertisements
[1:37:36] these things body shamed body shamed
[1:37:39] i'm not ashamed of the body i'm going to
[1:37:41] get
[1:37:44] it's eternal
[1:37:46] it never dies shame this old piece of
[1:37:49] junk all you want it's going to rot
[1:37:51] anyway
[1:37:54] let's get focused
[1:37:57] so it's just everything is just an
[1:37:59] attribute of his thinking in other words
[1:38:03] satan is only a perverter he's not a
[1:38:05] creator everything that's here
[1:38:08] even the time
[1:38:10] is because god thought it
[1:38:13] it is only is
[1:38:17] is thinking
[1:38:18] at first it has to be a thought
[1:38:23] and then a word
[1:38:26] and a word
[1:38:28] when a thought's expressed
[1:38:31] it's
[1:38:32] a word
[1:38:34] so if i i was to ask my my my brother
[1:38:37] here and i would say
[1:38:39] what are you thinking
[1:38:43] right now well no don't you don't
[1:38:46] you don't have to you don't have to
[1:38:48] answer that i'm just
[1:38:50] i'm here stand up i'm just using you as
[1:38:52] an example
[1:38:54] all right i don't want to know what he's
[1:38:56] thinking
[1:38:57] now god knows what he's thinking
[1:39:00] okay but the only way i can know what
[1:39:03] he's thinking is for him to what
[1:39:07] speak it
[1:39:10] now i know what he's thinking
[1:39:13] so you're thinking you wish i'd have
[1:39:14] never called you
[1:39:16] you're thinking that you're embarrassed
[1:39:18] but you're such a good-looking young man
[1:39:20] i want you to put you up here so
[1:39:22] all the people in the world can see and
[1:39:24] to end everything okay but you would
[1:39:26] never know what he was thinking until he
[1:39:28] what
[1:39:29] spoke it thank you you did a beautiful
[1:39:31] job
[1:39:32] there's a large portion of the kingdom
[1:39:34] waiting for him
[1:39:37] so you understand that it's got to be
[1:39:40] spoken so he had all these thoughts
[1:39:43] until they were expressed
[1:39:47] you wouldn't know what it was thinking
[1:39:51] well there was nobody to hear so when
[1:39:53] god expressed it he said let there be
[1:39:57] and then those thoughts
[1:39:59] took on form right so let's just follow
[1:40:01] this through so we can make uh just
[1:40:04] understand where we're trying to go this
[1:40:06] morning in our sunday school for our
[1:40:08] body here i'm not preaching to the world
[1:40:10] i know there's people that catch up and
[1:40:13] they they watch but this is for
[1:40:17] my ministry is for our local body
[1:40:22] i know a lot of people think they have a
[1:40:24] worldwide ministry but outside the local
[1:40:26] body of ministry
[1:40:28] to me
[1:40:29] the body to the world message to the
[1:40:32] world is the message william branham
[1:40:34] sent
[1:40:37] he said
[1:40:38] his thing at first it had to be a
[1:40:40] thought and then a word
[1:40:42] and a word when a thought is expressed
[1:40:45] it's a word and then it's spoken
[1:40:51] so when the i used the brethren so
[1:40:54] whatever thought he had he had to put
[1:40:56] that thought into words before he could
[1:41:00] speak it
[1:41:02] so where does the word have to be
[1:41:06] it has to be in your mind
[1:41:12] now it might have been taught to you
[1:41:14] from a baby
[1:41:17] you know what i mean
[1:41:19] i might walk up to something and i say
[1:41:22] well that looks like
[1:41:24] corn mush
[1:41:25] and you'd say no fufu
[1:41:28] saza
[1:41:29] boy fufu are you seeing all the people's
[1:41:31] eyes
[1:41:32] perked up
[1:41:33] it's like i made them hungry
[1:41:38] that's the word you've got
[1:41:41] that's been put in your mind
[1:41:44] to identify that it's not the same thing
[1:41:47] to me
[1:41:49] because i have a different word
[1:41:52] but isn't it funny that different word
[1:41:55] different expression
[1:41:57] the manifestation is the same
[1:42:05] he said express it's a word then it's
[1:42:08] spoken
[1:42:09] it has to happen
[1:42:15] and the whole thing is god's unfolding
[1:42:19] himself
[1:42:20] in his attributes
[1:42:23] and then god being made material
[1:42:27] tangible
[1:42:28] that we can talk to
[1:42:31] speak with
[1:42:32] in his whole church body and everything
[1:42:37] now that's the church body i'm talking
[1:42:40] about the one that he's made himself
[1:42:44] tangible in
[1:42:45] the one that he's speaking to
[1:42:48] and having fellowship with
[1:42:52] make sure you're part of that body
[1:42:54] if you haven't spoke to him in a long
[1:42:56] time start the conversation
[1:43:02] cry out of the father
[1:43:05] he's at the door knocking
[1:43:08] open it up
[1:43:11] let him in he said i'll come in and sup
[1:43:14] with you have fellowship with you
[1:43:17] don't stay on the outside
[1:43:19] when you have a god that that loves you
[1:43:22] wants to be with you
[1:43:24] wants to help you grow wants to help you
[1:43:27] overcome wants to provide for you wants
[1:43:30] to take care of you
[1:43:33] you're just depriving yourself of a
[1:43:35] wonderful fellowship
[1:43:40] he said
[1:43:41] it says attributes and then god
[1:43:45] therefore your name
[1:43:47] was
[1:43:48] in his thinking
[1:43:54] that's how you have eternal life
[1:43:57] you can't have it no other way
[1:44:00] if you got eternal life you always was
[1:44:04] see
[1:44:05] if you otherwise you just can't say well
[1:44:09] i belong to church i do this no sir
[1:44:15] eternal life never had a
[1:44:18] beginning or any
[1:44:21] anything that was eternal never did
[1:44:24] begin it cannot end
[1:44:27] so you were only in his thinking
[1:44:31] your name
[1:44:33] who you are
[1:44:35] and what you are
[1:44:37] that's the only way
[1:44:39] you could ever have eternal life because
[1:44:42] you always was
[1:44:47] now
[1:44:48] tell me that ain't a hard thing to
[1:44:50] change
[1:44:55] accept it
[1:44:57] and start figuring out why god made you
[1:44:59] the way he made you
[1:45:02] why he put you where he put you
[1:45:06] aren't you glad he didn't make you like
[1:45:08] me
[1:45:11] i'm not going to say the same thing back
[1:45:15] but you are what you are because god
[1:45:17] made you that way praise god for that
[1:45:21] let's grow
[1:45:23] he said
[1:45:26] he says and those no matter
[1:45:29] what they are
[1:45:30] they are eternally
[1:45:32] he said
[1:45:33] you always was and those no matter what
[1:45:36] they are they are eternally dead
[1:45:39] they were dead from the beginning the
[1:45:41] bible said the woman that lives in
[1:45:43] pleasure is dead well she's alive right
[1:45:47] she's always been dead she's dead in sin
[1:45:51] and trespasses
[1:45:53] and now if you were in the quickening
[1:45:56] at his beginning
[1:45:58] that's what he come to redeem
[1:46:01] and your name was put on the lamb's book
[1:46:04] of life
[1:46:05] in his thinking
[1:46:07] that
[1:46:10] at the beginning and he come to redeem
[1:46:13] all names that's in the book
[1:46:17] no more
[1:46:18] not one more
[1:46:20] just what was in there
[1:46:22] when the last name is redeemed
[1:46:26] he takes his book and claims what he has
[1:46:30] redeemed
[1:46:31] now a lot of people ask why hadn't the
[1:46:33] rapture happen why isn't it that should
[1:46:36] i still have children
[1:46:40] who knows
[1:46:42] but when the last one
[1:46:44] that he had in his thinking
[1:46:46] in the beginning
[1:46:48] is redeemed that's when it's over
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:53] i don't know when it is i don't know who
[1:46:55] it is but remember this i could maybe
[1:46:58] like just say it'll say this this
[1:46:59] morning it helped me
[1:47:02] when all these questions about uh the
[1:47:05] dates and years and times and having
[1:47:08] children and time being no more and him
[1:47:10] coming off the mercy seat
[1:47:13] he can come off the mercy seat but it
[1:47:16] didn't change what was in his mind in
[1:47:19] the beginning
[1:47:24] that may be your little grandbaby
[1:47:28] maybe your great-grandbaby
[1:47:30] but what was there
[1:47:32] will be here and if it's part of that
[1:47:35] when that last one's redeemed it'll be
[1:47:38] there
[1:47:39] you cannot take a human calendar and a
[1:47:42] human understanding and try to interpret
[1:47:46] god's program
[1:47:51] it's going to happen just the same
[1:47:55] should i get married get married plant
[1:47:57] your potatoes should i have children
[1:47:59] have children
[1:48:01] what happens if their names not on the
[1:48:03] lamb's book of life what happens if
[1:48:04] their name is on the land
[1:48:11] there's another judgment seat
[1:48:14] where a lot of people will make it
[1:48:16] because they've been good to the bride
[1:48:18] but this is rapture we're talking about
[1:48:21] so we don't know we go forward we live
[1:48:23] right we do right
[1:48:38] okay
[1:48:42] he says now what a strange thing it
[1:48:45] would be if we couldn't believe all
[1:48:48] that's written in the scriptures
[1:48:51] for the whole thing is god's word
[1:48:54] and all inspired
[1:48:56] in every bit of it
[1:48:59] and we believe
[1:49:00] every bit of it
[1:49:03] look
[1:49:05] you know this is a lot of place where a
[1:49:07] lot of times
[1:49:09] the misunderstanding of what the holy
[1:49:11] spirit is
[1:49:13] now the word of god is god's thinking is
[1:49:17] that correct
[1:49:19] so that that's what the
[1:49:21] the word of god is we understand that in
[1:49:24] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:49:26] was with god and the word was god we
[1:49:29] understand that those thoughts that god
[1:49:31] had was made flesh so we could look at
[1:49:34] those thoughts in the flesh that we
[1:49:36] could handle touch and feel them
[1:49:40] now he's not here in that body anymore
[1:49:44] but he's still here
[1:49:47] but we understand what the what is what
[1:49:50] does the holy spirit do
[1:49:53] the scripture says the holy spirit came
[1:49:55] not to
[1:49:57] speak of itself
[1:50:00] but to bring you into remembrance of all
[1:50:03] the things that i taught
[1:50:06] now when you really come down to the
[1:50:08] essence because the holy spirit is not a
[1:50:11] third person
[1:50:15] it is not another person
[1:50:20] the holy spirit is the word
[1:50:24] but you understand the holy spirit is
[1:50:26] his spirit
[1:50:29] i hope i can just say this just right
[1:50:32] and
[1:50:34] the holy spirit puts
[1:50:36] the mind of the word
[1:50:39] in you
[1:50:45] what god had in his mind
[1:50:48] was expressed in his word
[1:50:51] so when you become the word
[1:50:54] your thoughts are the same thoughts that
[1:50:57] produce the word
[1:51:00] so what does the holy spirit do
[1:51:03] it changes your thinking
[1:51:09] it changes your mind
[1:51:13] and there you don't have your mind
[1:51:16] and the word
[1:51:20] when the spirit comes he puts the mind
[1:51:23] that was in christ in you
[1:51:25] isn't that what philippians 2
[1:51:28] uh 5-11 says let this mind be in you
[1:51:32] that was in christ jesus thinking it not
[1:51:35] robbery to be with god
[1:51:39] so generic what is the
[1:51:42] the word of god is preached
[1:51:45] it's the thoughts of god so he's trying
[1:51:47] to express them thoughts and manifest
[1:51:51] them thoughts but how can he manifest
[1:51:53] the thoughts in your flesh if they don't
[1:51:56] come manifested in your mind first
[1:52:03] so god's trying to change
[1:52:07] the way the church thinks
[1:52:12] he wants you to know you were with him
[1:52:14] in the beginning he wants you to think
[1:52:16] that way
[1:52:19] in questions and answers
[1:52:22] this
[1:52:23] question comes into brother branham i
[1:52:24] don't know if he read it beforehand or
[1:52:26] not
[1:52:28] but this
[1:52:29] i believe is his brother or this sister
[1:52:32] had a dream
[1:52:34] he said barbara i had this dream a year
[1:52:37] ago
[1:52:38] and it's reoccurring
[1:52:40] i'm all tore up
[1:52:43] he says i was out
[1:52:45] in
[1:52:46] like a desert i and i you can go read it
[1:52:49] i'm going to do my best with it he's
[1:52:51] like i was out in the desert and i was
[1:52:53] in white sand
[1:52:55] and i was lost
[1:52:58] terribly lost
[1:53:00] and he said my wife was there or my my
[1:53:03] son was there and
[1:53:05] or my husband was there
[1:53:07] and we were all lost
[1:53:10] terribly lost
[1:53:14] and brother graham says
[1:53:17] sister
[1:53:21] he says
[1:53:23] everything's good
[1:53:25] he said the white sand
[1:53:28] meant that you
[1:53:30] weren't lost
[1:53:31] that you have the holy ghost
[1:53:34] he says that's just the devil
[1:53:37] making you feel that way
[1:53:40] he says and it's making you all upset
[1:53:44] and nervous
[1:53:47] and when you get upset and nervous
[1:53:50] you make
[1:53:51] your husband or your wife upset and
[1:53:54] nervous and then you make your children
[1:53:57] upset and nervous and then the whole
[1:53:59] family becomes upset and nervous
[1:54:04] it just passes down and it passes down
[1:54:06] he said don't you let satan do that to
[1:54:08] you you quit thinking that way you get
[1:54:12] that thought out of your mind
[1:54:14] you're saved you're elected you're
[1:54:16] redeemed the white sand prove it
[1:54:19] let it go
[1:54:22] well i hope that that person just
[1:54:24] thought praise god
[1:54:26] if the prophet of god said i was filled
[1:54:29] with the holy ghost and redeemed betty
[1:54:31] that would be life to me look out
[1:54:35] i just hope i'd have the character to
[1:54:37] keep that humble
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:43] but it was it was inner thinking
[1:54:48] and here's the word of the hour the
[1:54:50] first thing it does it's got to change
[1:54:51] your thinking so you've got to remember
[1:54:54] the word
[1:54:56] which we believe this message is the
[1:54:58] word has come to change our
[1:55:02] thinking it come to change a carnal mind
[1:55:06] to a spiritual mind a carnal mind is
[1:55:09] what enmity with god it can't understand
[1:55:12] spiritual things but the spiritual mind
[1:55:15] is
[1:55:16] life
[1:55:18] because spiritual things are
[1:55:20] comprehended by a spiritual mind the
[1:55:22] only thing that can change the mind is
[1:55:25] the word
[1:55:31] the only thing that can change the mind
[1:55:33] of the church
[1:55:36] and i know that people
[1:55:39] when people say well it's the holy
[1:55:40] spirit but the holy spirit came
[1:55:44] to give you the mind of the word
[1:55:49] it came to give you word thinking
[1:55:54] it didn't come to have a revival around
[1:55:57] its presence
[1:56:00] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:56:02] the unjust
[1:56:06] but it don't change them
[1:56:11] they shout and live the same
[1:56:14] they praise god they sing specials they
[1:56:17] carry on and they live the same
[1:56:22] they love the blessings they love the
[1:56:24] hallelujah but they're not preparing for
[1:56:26] the rapture
[1:56:29] but let me tell you the only thing
[1:56:31] that's going to change your thinking is
[1:56:34] what god sent in this age to change the
[1:56:38] thinking
[1:56:43] and that's the word
[1:56:48] how can you eliminate
[1:56:51] the word from people's lives and expect
[1:56:54] to have them be changed into rapturing
[1:56:57] condition by a spirit that falls on the
[1:57:00] just and the unjust
[1:57:04] it would have to bring the unjust two
[1:57:09] but that's not what does the
[1:57:10] transformation
[1:57:12] it's not the anointing of the spirit
[1:57:16] it's the transforming power of the
[1:57:19] spirit to put make our minds become word
[1:57:23] minds
[1:57:28] then how can you keep running yourself
[1:57:30] down when the word says your name's on
[1:57:32] the lamb's book of life
[1:57:37] don't make sense
[1:57:41] why would we strive for an anointing
[1:57:44] that can go away
[1:57:49] but when you think a certain way
[1:57:52] when you've been transformed
[1:57:55] into a new creature
[1:57:58] with a new heart
[1:58:00] and a new mind
[1:58:02] and a new outlook
[1:58:04] and new perceptions that doesn't go away
[1:58:10] why because
[1:58:11] even when
[1:58:13] in the storm no matter where i am
[1:58:16] you are who you are
[1:58:21] we know you're still the same your word
[1:58:24] don't fail
[1:58:25] whatever you said will happen that's
[1:58:27] what's in your mind
[1:58:30] because that's what the holy spirit does
[1:58:33] it's not a come and go anointing
[1:58:38] sure he blesses you
[1:58:40] falls on the just and the unjust
[1:58:43] sure it's an anointing
[1:58:49] but we live for a change
[1:58:53] we're living for a change
[1:58:55] we want to be changed what are we living
[1:58:58] for we're living for the rapture we're
[1:59:00] living for a change
[1:59:02] we're living in how are we going to be
[1:59:04] changed with the carnal mind the holy
[1:59:07] spirit and that's why the messenger came
[1:59:09] everything every time i listen to his
[1:59:12] word every time i read what he says i
[1:59:14] realize what he's trying to do he's
[1:59:16] trying to change the way i think
[1:59:24] he thought different in everybody
[1:59:28] he didn't keep it to himself
[1:59:30] he shared it with us
[1:59:33] so that's what the holy spirit
[1:59:37] is doing
[1:59:38] he's trying to put the thinking
[1:59:41] that made you the word so if if you're
[1:59:45] the word
[1:59:46] then
[1:59:47] if the words of thought are from
[1:59:49] expressed the thinking has to go along
[1:59:52] with the word
[1:59:56] is that
[1:59:58] simple enough
[2:00:01] i hope i i don't know
[2:00:04] how i'm communicating
[2:00:07] but i'm doing my best to
[2:00:10] let you understand i don't want us built
[2:00:13] in feelings
[2:00:15] or emotions
[2:00:17] revival's fine
[2:00:20] you want to shout that's fine
[2:00:23] you want to run around the church that's
[2:00:25] fine i'm not against that hallelujah
[2:00:27] praise god i'm not against it
[2:00:32] but if it's not changing the very way
[2:00:35] that you think
[2:00:38] then all you are is spiritually wet
[2:00:48] peter and them guys
[2:00:51] they're in a prison
[2:00:54] they just go rejoicing
[2:00:56] praise god
[2:00:57] wow they had the mind of god
[2:01:01] they thought the way god thought
[2:01:04] who was it was sharing this the other
[2:01:06] day
[2:01:07] about john being
[2:01:09] boiled in oil couldn't boil it out of
[2:01:11] him
[2:01:12] he had it in his mind
[2:01:14] if you figure the anointing that was on
[2:01:16] him and boiling oil
[2:01:19] no it was his mind
[2:01:22] he had the same mind that god did why
[2:01:25] because he had the same word
[2:01:28] and you're not going to get the old only
[2:01:31] the voice of the word will change the
[2:01:35] mind
[2:01:41] if you want the church to change and
[2:01:43] have the mind of christ
[2:01:44] play the voice to the church
[2:01:49] play the voice hear the voice
[2:01:52] it's ordained
[2:01:54] to quicken the words in you
[2:01:57] the spirit quickens the word in your
[2:02:00] mind and makes it happen and makes it
[2:02:03] alive
[2:02:04] so we understand that
[2:02:06] the spirit
[2:02:09] is
[2:02:10] is
[2:02:11] the holy spirit is what puts the mind of
[2:02:14] christ in you
[2:02:16] is that
[2:02:17] you am i is that kind of made clear
[2:02:21] you understand exactly
[2:02:23] what that it does it actually
[2:02:27] it
[2:02:28] that's what quickens so the affair
[2:02:32] is individual
[2:02:37] you understand that
[2:02:39] in other words it's not done to a group
[2:02:43] god doesn't convert groups he converts
[2:02:46] individuals
[2:02:49] the conversion is individual
[2:02:54] each of you have to have your own
[2:02:56] conversion
[2:02:57] you didn't go someplace with somebody
[2:03:00] now you most you might have individually
[2:03:03] came to the altar
[2:03:07] but there's nobody saved in a group
[2:03:10] god don't save groups he don't save
[2:03:12] churches the methodists aren't saved
[2:03:15] because they're methodists the catholics
[2:03:17] aren't saved because they're catholics
[2:03:21] we're not saved because we're in the
[2:03:23] message
[2:03:24] god doesn't save
[2:03:26] he
[2:03:27] groups he deals with individuals the
[2:03:30] conversion is individual
[2:03:33] you understand that it's an individual
[2:03:36] affair
[2:03:37] the mind
[2:03:39] the the change that the word creates in
[2:03:42] you
[2:03:44] it
[2:03:44] it is
[2:03:46] it is individual
[2:03:49] those things are are individual the
[2:03:51] birth is individual
[2:03:54] every single one of you
[2:03:56] was very even twins are birthed
[2:03:59] individually
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:03] so
[2:04:04] all that part of it's individual
[2:04:09] but after you have the individual birth
[2:04:14] and you're
[2:04:16] born
[2:04:18] into an experience
[2:04:20] and you've been converted
[2:04:22] and now god is through that process
[2:04:26] of of being born again and rejuvenated
[2:04:30] and made afresh and new and and laying
[2:04:34] down your thinking and accepting his
[2:04:37] word as your thinking
[2:04:42] in other words his word becomes your
[2:04:45] final outcome
[2:04:50] satan may try to get you to reason but
[2:04:52] when it comes down to it you're you're
[2:04:54] the word you think the way he thinks
[2:04:57] that's your final outcome
[2:05:00] but
[2:05:00] you're born into a body
[2:05:05] and this is where i just want to finish
[2:05:08] now
[2:05:09] for a few minutes
[2:05:12] because
[2:05:13] he is coming to rapture
[2:05:16] a body
[2:05:24] god came in the form of a body
[2:05:31] and when god's going to rapture
[2:05:34] he's rapturing a body
[2:05:37] i don't know where that body is
[2:05:41] i trust me we have many members of that
[2:05:44] body here
[2:05:48] and that's the way i think
[2:05:53] i believe every single one of you is a
[2:05:55] believer
[2:05:56] every single one of you is going
[2:05:59] i trust that every single one of you and
[2:06:02] if satan keeps badgering you're not
[2:06:06] tell him
[2:06:07] what the word said he was
[2:06:10] he's a liar
[2:06:12] he's the father of lies there's no truth
[2:06:15] in them amen
[2:06:18] but we come
[2:06:21] and so this is the thinking that i'm
[2:06:23] trying to
[2:06:24] express in the word of god
[2:06:27] because too many times we start living
[2:06:30] only for ourselves
[2:06:33] we live in selfsville
[2:06:38] we only take selfies
[2:06:47] our our whole idea
[2:06:49] even in the church
[2:06:51] is
[2:06:52] if i'm going to go in the rapture i'm
[2:06:54] going to go on the rapture
[2:06:56] but did you ever stop to understand that
[2:06:59] you're part of a body
[2:07:01] that's going in the rapture
[2:07:05] that you've been born into
[2:07:08] a body
[2:07:12] that your life is not a life unto
[2:07:15] yourself
[2:07:16] for you to make it to heaven
[2:07:19] your life
[2:07:21] that he gave you
[2:07:23] he made you an individual but and he
[2:07:26] tailored
[2:07:27] that individual birth just to you
[2:07:31] that you would be
[2:07:34] a part of a body
[2:07:39] and that you would be fitted
[2:07:41] in to that body
[2:07:50] i'd like to read this statement if i
[2:07:51] could i think it's a beautiful
[2:07:54] statement
[2:07:58] he says now i want
[2:08:00] you to remember
[2:08:02] that the very thing that we are trying
[2:08:05] to contend for that is jesus is not dead
[2:08:11] but is alive
[2:08:15] oh if we could just get that into our
[2:08:17] minds huh he's not dead
[2:08:21] he's not gone away
[2:08:24] he's going to do everything he said he
[2:08:26] would do
[2:08:29] 10 10 4
[2:08:32] that is jesus is not dead he
[2:08:35] but he's alive
[2:08:37] and he's just the same today
[2:08:40] as he was when he walked in galilee
[2:08:44] only he's not in a corporal body
[2:08:48] but in his church body
[2:08:54] working through each member
[2:08:57] as he has ordained them to do
[2:09:02] do you believe that
[2:09:07] so that's where he is
[2:09:11] he's in a body
[2:09:16] and he's ordained it
[2:09:19] and made it
[2:09:21] that each body
[2:09:24] and member of that body
[2:09:28] and each member was ordained to do
[2:09:32] what he ordained him to do
[2:09:37] because he's ordained that piece of the
[2:09:39] body to work with another piece of the
[2:09:42] body
[2:09:44] because that body has got to come
[2:09:46] together because he's rapturing a body
[2:09:54] in hebrews he says sacrifice is an
[2:09:56] offering i have not but a body thou hath
[2:09:58] prepared for me
[2:10:01] he was trying to tell the church
[2:10:04] well if he came in a body
[2:10:06] and now we know his spirit has come
[2:10:09] in a body
[2:10:12] the mystical body of christ he's not
[2:10:14] here anymore in a carnal body is he
[2:10:17] but he's here in a mystical body
[2:10:21] he's preaching the gospel
[2:10:24] but he's using body members
[2:10:27] he's praying for the sick he's using
[2:10:30] body members he's making intercession
[2:10:32] he's using body members he's feeding the
[2:10:35] poor he's using body members
[2:10:38] he's coming for a body
[2:10:42] turn to ephesians
[2:10:53] i believe it's
[2:10:54] five i think i had it wrote down here
[2:10:57] maybe not
[2:10:58] but
[2:11:08] we can find it
[2:11:25] no let me see i've got it here i'll just
[2:11:27] plan it i thought it was ephesians six
[2:11:30] uh
[2:11:32] it's on one of my papers here i'm not
[2:11:34] good with papers
[2:11:35] anybody that knows ephesians 4 16.
[2:11:43] this is what he says here in ephesians 4
[2:11:45] 16.
[2:11:47] now
[2:11:47] now listen because now we're talking
[2:11:49] about the rapture
[2:11:51] we're talking about preparing ourselves
[2:11:54] for a rapture
[2:11:56] and being in rapture and condition
[2:11:59] you're not in rapturing condition
[2:12:02] until you're positionally placed in the
[2:12:05] body
[2:12:06] doing what you're ordained to do
[2:12:11] being blessed
[2:12:13] and anointed and singing and shouting
[2:12:16] and rejoicing and dancing does not put
[2:12:20] you in rapturing condition
[2:12:23] amen
[2:12:24] i'm not saying that it's bad to do that
[2:12:27] but don't ever take it as an evidence
[2:12:35] you're just against any emotion no i'm
[2:12:37] not i'm a very emotional person don't
[2:12:39] get me mad
[2:12:45] one person told me one time he said i've
[2:12:47] learned one thing about you and i said
[2:12:49] well what's that brother he don't you
[2:12:51] ever say anything bad about your deacons
[2:12:57] because that upsets me
[2:13:00] because they're all volunteers
[2:13:03] now if they're getting paid have at them
[2:13:06] part of the job
[2:13:10] but when you go off on a cashier
[2:13:13] it's not her job
[2:13:18] she probably couldn't even afford the
[2:13:20] thing you're buying
[2:13:24] you know she's just there
[2:13:28] she's going to leave the hamburger stand
[2:13:29] she's going to leave the restaurant
[2:13:31] she's going to go home soak her feet
[2:13:33] she's going to wash all the food smell
[2:13:35] out of her clothes i'm going to wash her
[2:13:37] hair and everything she's going to try
[2:13:39] to put all the human factor behind her
[2:13:44] so she's going to get some rest
[2:13:48] don't let's don't
[2:13:50] lose
[2:13:52] our objective
[2:13:55] and our purpose
[2:13:57] let's read this
[2:14:01] that we henceforth be no more children
[2:14:05] tossed to and fro
[2:14:07] and carried about with every wind of
[2:14:10] doctrine
[2:14:11] by the slight of men
[2:14:16] there's be steadfast
[2:14:19] know what you're preparing for know
[2:14:21] where you're going know why you're doing
[2:14:23] what you're doing
[2:14:26] remember
[2:14:27] revival is not our goal
[2:14:31] the rapture is our goal
[2:14:35] we're not trying to create a revival
[2:14:37] here
[2:14:40] in bedford
[2:14:42] we're not trying to say we got this one
[2:14:44] coming from here and this one coming
[2:14:46] from here and and man we got it going on
[2:14:49] and and we got the best singers
[2:14:53] let's make the rapture
[2:14:55] let's make the rapture
[2:14:59] let's live rapture
[2:15:01] let's think rapture we're at rapturing
[2:15:04] time it's harvest time
[2:15:06] every sign for the coming of the lord is
[2:15:09] at hand let's be ready
[2:15:13] don't miss
[2:15:15] it
[2:15:18] don't just accept the rain
[2:15:21] if it's not changing
[2:15:23] that your mind becomes the same thought
[2:15:26] that was in the word
[2:15:30] cunningham craftness whereby lie in wait
[2:15:33] to deceive
[2:15:34] but speak the truth in love
[2:15:38] may grow up
[2:15:40] into him
[2:15:41] in all things
[2:15:44] that we may grow up into him
[2:15:47] in all things which is the head even
[2:15:52] christ
[2:15:54] from whom the whole body
[2:15:57] fitteth and joined together
[2:16:00] and compact by that
[2:16:03] which every
[2:16:04] joint
[2:16:06] supply it
[2:16:10] according to the effectual working
[2:16:14] in the measure of every part
[2:16:18] making increase of the body
[2:16:22] unto the edifying of itself
[2:16:26] in
[2:16:27] love
[2:16:28] that is a mouthful
[2:16:33] that's beautiful
[2:16:37] he said how will they know you are my
[2:16:39] disciples
[2:16:41] by your loved one for another
[2:16:44] by every member the body is compacted
[2:16:51] you know what when you compact something
[2:16:53] it it it it becomes firm it becomes
[2:16:56] strong the body's made strong by every
[2:17:00] member
[2:17:02] supplying to the other member
[2:17:05] that which god had given them as being
[2:17:08] members in particular
[2:17:12] so you've got to understand what he's
[2:17:13] coming to rapture
[2:17:16] he's looking at this body
[2:17:21] now i'm not talking about this body but
[2:17:23] this natural body here should be an
[2:17:26] example of the spiritual body
[2:17:32] you can't separate yourself from the
[2:17:34] body
[2:17:37] you can't just come to church
[2:17:40] come through the doors sit down
[2:17:43] fulfill your church obligation get up
[2:17:46] and go out like you have no
[2:17:48] responsibility or obligation to anybody
[2:17:50] else here
[2:17:56] no
[2:17:59] you might have something for somebody
[2:18:04] you're saying get you so beat down
[2:18:08] don't let him do that
[2:18:12] your very word of kindness
[2:18:14] your very handshake your very act of
[2:18:17] love
[2:18:18] but listen he said let's just read it
[2:18:19] again
[2:18:22] he says
[2:18:23] but speak the truth in love
[2:18:28] may grow up
[2:18:30] into him
[2:18:33] in all things
[2:18:36] even things which is the head even
[2:18:40] christ
[2:18:41] from whom the whole body
[2:18:43] fitteth and joined together
[2:18:47] so how can you be in rapturing condition
[2:18:51] if you're not going to allow god to fit
[2:18:54] you and join you to the body
[2:19:00] you can't sit back say oh i'm going to
[2:19:01] make this on my own no you're
[2:19:04] not because you ain't going without me
[2:19:13] so if you don't want me hanging onto
[2:19:14] your ankle
[2:19:17] pick me up
[2:19:22] how are you gonna how are you gonna say
[2:19:24] i'm in rapturing condition
[2:19:26] when you're totally unaware
[2:19:28] that he is now
[2:19:31] in his body
[2:19:34] he's in the body which is the church
[2:19:40] how can you say i'm ready for the
[2:19:41] rapture when you're totally unaware
[2:19:44] of that body
[2:19:46] the existence of that body the needs of
[2:19:50] that body
[2:19:51] now remember i said there's a church
[2:19:53] building we're not talking about that
[2:19:56] i'm not preaching about building fund
[2:20:01] there's the church membership
[2:20:05] i'm not talking about that
[2:20:09] i'm talking about a mind
[2:20:12] a called out people that have the mind
[2:20:15] of christ that look upon the needs of
[2:20:17] every man as their own
[2:20:25] he said
[2:20:26] fifth and join together and compact
[2:20:29] by that which every joint supply of
[2:20:41] you how are you in rapturing condition
[2:20:43] if your joint isn't supplying
[2:20:48] spiritually prayer intercession thinking
[2:20:53] burdens everything what's happened is we
[2:20:56] get this whole idea about the individual
[2:20:59] part
[2:21:01] yes you've got to have the individual
[2:21:03] part but after you've had that
[2:21:05] individual experience you're placed in a
[2:21:08] body
[2:21:12] to fulfill that need of that body
[2:21:16] that compressed about there according to
[2:21:19] the effectual working in the measure of
[2:21:22] every part the effectual
[2:21:24] working of the measure of every part
[2:21:30] now we're wanting to get ready for the
[2:21:31] rapture
[2:21:33] right that's the whole thing
[2:21:35] you've got to know you have a measure
[2:21:38] you've got to know you have a part
[2:21:41] you've got to know there's something you
[2:21:43] supply that's the maturity
[2:21:46] of the statue of a perfect man
[2:21:49] that's the maturity of being
[2:21:51] speaking the truth and love
[2:21:55] and becoming in all things like can
[2:21:57] hearing is the love of god made perfect
[2:22:01] as he is
[2:22:02] so are we in this world
[2:22:06] he says every part making increase
[2:22:10] of the body
[2:22:15] if i'm in rapturing condition
[2:22:17] i'm making increase to the body
[2:22:20] and there's my thinking has not just
[2:22:23] become about survival
[2:22:27] i'm trying to survive i'm trying to make
[2:22:30] it i'm trying to fight the world you
[2:22:33] know i got all these troubles and all
[2:22:35] these battles and and oh god
[2:22:38] you know i've got to make it
[2:22:41] wait a minute
[2:22:47] let me shake myself
[2:22:50] i was in him in the beginning
[2:22:55] i've got eternal life i was there
[2:22:57] i'm going to put the thinking
[2:23:00] of god in my mind
[2:23:01] i'm going to put the word in what he
[2:23:03] said about now i'm going to be about
[2:23:05] what he made me to do let's apply to my
[2:23:08] other members my other parts of the body
[2:23:11] i'm going to help them make the rapture
[2:23:13] i'm going to help them make the rapture
[2:23:14] you're not going without me well i'm not
[2:23:17] going without you i'm here for you i'm
[2:23:20] praying for you i'm with you it's not
[2:23:22] just me it's us
[2:23:28] we're in this together
[2:23:35] he said he would rather have us love one
[2:23:37] another than love him what kind of love
[2:23:39] is that
[2:23:42] so what i'm saying is when this church
[2:23:44] starts to get to rapture and condition
[2:23:46] there's a uniting that takes place
[2:23:50] in the love of god
[2:23:52] in her heart
[2:23:53] it's 12 14 so we'll
[2:23:56] we'll close i'll let you go read this
[2:23:57] other part at home
[2:24:00] the effects will work in every part
[2:24:02] supplying
[2:24:04] together in love and then of course we
[2:24:07] read that first part in corinthians
[2:24:10] of first corinthians in 12 and we won't
[2:24:13] we won't go
[2:24:14] into that
[2:24:16] any farther this morning
[2:24:18] because it's late
[2:24:20] but the whole thing talks about
[2:24:22] every part of the body
[2:24:25] and let me just read down then we'll
[2:24:27] skip
[2:24:28] all the things about every member being
[2:24:30] necessary
[2:24:32] how many knows corinthians 12.
[2:24:35] first part is about gifts
[2:24:38] the second part is about
[2:24:40] how there's a body
[2:24:43] that gets worked in and that it's a body
[2:24:46] and
[2:24:47] it can now and that there's a many
[2:24:49] member but one body one body many
[2:24:52] members but one body and and he says and
[2:24:55] then the 25th verse he says there should
[2:24:58] be no schisms in the body
[2:25:01] but that the members
[2:25:03] should have the same care
[2:25:06] one
[2:25:07] for another
[2:25:09] and and this morning we'll
[2:25:11] we'll just
[2:25:12] and i wanted to go through corinthians
[2:25:14] and and go through those scriptures but
[2:25:17] uh time
[2:25:18] uh
[2:25:20] would escape us but i'd like just to
[2:25:23] close with uh
[2:25:27] with this
[2:25:29] reading
[2:25:31] this morning
[2:25:34] and again i i don't
[2:25:36] remember where it's
[2:25:40] found
[2:25:44] but he makes this statement
[2:25:54] he says now christ is the head
[2:25:58] of this christ is the head
[2:26:01] of this
[2:26:03] masonic kingdom
[2:26:05] and you can not organize a kingdom
[2:26:09] of which christ is a head
[2:26:11] you cannot denominate a kingdom which
[2:26:14] christ is the head
[2:26:16] because christ is king
[2:26:19] and you cannot take the intellectuals of
[2:26:22] man
[2:26:23] and make an organization to which christ
[2:26:27] will govern
[2:26:29] what does christ govern
[2:26:31] he governs his
[2:26:32] body
[2:26:37] the kingdom of god is
[2:26:39] going contrary to
[2:26:43] is going contrary to the king
[2:26:45] and if they're going contrary to the
[2:26:48] king
[2:26:49] it would be against the king
[2:26:52] so if it's against the king
[2:26:54] it would be an antichrist
[2:26:57] that's pretty rough
[2:26:59] if i had just a little more voice
[2:27:02] i'd make that clear
[2:27:05] it is an antichrist
[2:27:08] and if you bear with me a few minutes
[2:27:11] i'll prove that
[2:27:12] an antichrist spirit tries to take the
[2:27:15] people
[2:27:16] and call them from an organization to an
[2:27:21] organization
[2:27:22] organizing them together
[2:27:25] which never was the will of god
[2:27:28] people has always fussed at me because i
[2:27:32] struck so hard at organizations
[2:27:34] it isn't the people in there that i'm
[2:27:38] striking at
[2:27:39] it's that denominating spirit
[2:27:42] that makes people think that
[2:27:45] we
[2:27:46] are
[2:27:47] the people
[2:27:56] that's that second church
[2:28:00] we talked about
[2:28:02] god's people is called out people
[2:28:05] i believe they're in every denomination
[2:28:09] that could be catholic that could be
[2:28:11] protestant that could be jewish that
[2:28:13] could be any kind of church
[2:28:16] but the real church is the mystical body
[2:28:19] of jesus christ
[2:28:22] now you cannot organize the mystical
[2:28:24] body of christ now every person
[2:28:28] that comes to christ comes out of the
[2:28:31] world
[2:28:32] comes into christ comes into this
[2:28:35] mystical body
[2:28:37] and you are a member of that body when
[2:28:41] you are brought into this church
[2:28:44] called out and are baptized into the
[2:28:47] mystical body
[2:28:49] you get it
[2:28:50] not methodist not baptist not
[2:28:53] pentecostal not nazarene not pilgrim
[2:28:56] holiness not catholics but the body of
[2:29:00] jesus christ
[2:29:01] we'll pick that up a little deeper in
[2:29:04] other questions in a few minutes
[2:29:06] as we go into the deeper parts of it but
[2:29:09] the body of christ is the church
[2:29:13] now he likened it in many parables
[2:29:16] like husband and wife
[2:29:18] he calls the church the bride
[2:29:21] and the bride is no longer the bro the
[2:29:24] bride is no longer and the bridegroom is
[2:29:27] no longer two people
[2:29:30] they are one
[2:29:32] she is flesh of his flesh and bone of
[2:29:34] his bone and then when a
[2:29:38] man in a woman is called to the mystical
[2:29:41] body of christ
[2:29:43] by the holy spirit
[2:29:45] they become a full member of his body
[2:29:49] when they're filled with the holy ghost
[2:29:52] because god took
[2:29:53] the spirit of christ
[2:29:56] raised up his body
[2:29:58] and placed it upon the throne and sent
[2:30:02] back the holy spirit
[2:30:04] to make up the mystical body of christ
[2:30:08] which will be united
[2:30:12] at the marriage supper at the coming of
[2:30:15] the lord you can't organize it
[2:30:18] it is
[2:30:19] mysterious
[2:30:22] jesus said to nicodemus the wind bloweth
[2:30:26] where it listeth and can
[2:30:30] it
[2:30:31] thou cannot tell which way it cometh or
[2:30:34] where it goeth so is everyone that's
[2:30:37] born of the spirit you can't understand
[2:30:39] it it comes from somewhere
[2:30:42] it isn't methodist it isn't baptist it
[2:30:45] isn't pentecostal it is an organization
[2:30:49] it's a birth
[2:30:51] born into the kingdom
[2:30:54] of god now try to organize it
[2:30:57] and bring it to antichrist because
[2:31:00] anything that's against the teachings of
[2:31:02] christ
[2:31:05] is antichrist
[2:31:07] amen i hope that this morning through my
[2:31:11] my
[2:31:13] inability to
[2:31:15] really express it the
[2:31:18] the the way that i i'm trying to do it
[2:31:21] on my heart i i just wanted to look just
[2:31:24] for a quick because i wanted to make
[2:31:26] sure that
[2:31:28] that
[2:31:29] i've covered
[2:31:31] everything that i kind of wanted and
[2:31:34] but when it when it comes down to it
[2:31:36] this body
[2:31:41] if you're a part of the body you know it
[2:31:46] and and when you realize you're not
[2:31:49] living for yourself
[2:31:51] you're living for that body
[2:31:54] you say i don't know who it is i i don't
[2:31:56] know who is the body or who isn't
[2:31:59] but the mind that's in me
[2:32:02] has got to be the same mind that god so
[2:32:04] loved the world he gave his only
[2:32:06] begotten son
[2:32:08] well when man was yet sinners he died
[2:32:10] for us
[2:32:12] when we can live for
[2:32:14] and know we're a part of something
[2:32:17] that is just not me that's going
[2:32:21] i've got a responsibility a care make it
[2:32:25] and do my part
[2:32:27] and and do my supply
[2:32:31] and the prophet of god said this in the
[2:32:34] token
[2:32:35] he says oh take this solemnly
[2:32:39] we should love one another
[2:32:41] oh my
[2:32:42] is paragraph 243 in the token
[2:32:48] we should
[2:32:51] we should love one another oh my we
[2:32:53] should be
[2:32:54] so in love
[2:32:57] don't never speak evil against one
[2:32:59] another
[2:33:01] if somebody makes a mistake pray for him
[2:33:03] right quick
[2:33:04] we are together
[2:33:06] in this
[2:33:07] with god
[2:33:09] we are brothers and sisters
[2:33:11] oh we live godly
[2:33:14] live live like daughters of god live
[2:33:17] like sons of god live sweet kind humble
[2:33:21] let no evil come into your mind
[2:33:24] in your thinking
[2:33:26] just dismiss it
[2:33:28] if it knocks on the door
[2:33:31] take it away just say just show
[2:33:34] your token and keep walking i am under
[2:33:39] the blood
[2:33:42] this morning i wanted to
[2:33:46] share this
[2:33:47] because
[2:33:50] we're talking about a rapture
[2:33:52] and we're talking about being a
[2:33:54] rapturing condition
[2:33:56] and we're talking about
[2:33:58] the rapture is faith
[2:34:01] and it's a revelation
[2:34:04] and when we understand that i'm not the
[2:34:07] only one he's coming for
[2:34:10] he's coming for a body
[2:34:14] and i want to give myself to that body
[2:34:17] as christ gave himself for me
[2:34:20] and as he pours his spirit the church
[2:34:23] and as he brings this body together in
[2:34:26] unity and
[2:34:28] peace that every member is now helping
[2:34:32] every other member make that rapture
[2:34:36] he's taking a body
[2:34:40] he came in a body go read the five
[2:34:43] identifications of the church listen to
[2:34:45] it as he explains the mystical body well
[2:34:48] understand he is dwelling in a body
[2:34:51] he's coming for a body you're a part of
[2:34:54] that body i pray this morning that
[2:34:57] you'll take some sense of consciousness
[2:35:01] that you belong to something
[2:35:04] that you're a part of something
[2:35:06] and you have something to supply
[2:35:09] to that body
