[13:06] himself and just live a life now of
[13:09] sacrifice for every one of his family
[13:12] members
[13:13] and I'm sure it's
[13:16] overwhelming and a lot taken from him
[13:20] Lord and just pray that your Holy Spirit
[13:22] would go to him right now Lord as just a
[13:25] a a refreshing of your presence would
[13:28] just come upon them Lord Lord in such a
[13:30] supernatural way that he could be

[13:36] those demons that are trying to Howl at
[13:38] him Lord we rebuke that devil lord and
[13:42] just pray that the peace of God would
[13:43] just start to settle in his heart in his
[13:45] mind and that he would know as he takes
[13:48] you at his word that it's you that's
[13:49] living out through him in his life
[13:52] expressing Christ to each one of his
[13:54] family members and Lord I know that he
[13:56] could be discouraged many times at the

[24:21] if anybody has any time tomorrow to come

[24:27] of help we have some Lumber that needs
[24:30] to be cut up and stacked and Boards
[24:32] moved and and sidewalks swept and and
[24:38] everything to uh to get ready for our
[24:42] guest and uh that's what we're going to
[24:44] have we hope we have guests but we're
[24:47] looking for the most important guest
[24:50] amen so uh and good it it looks good
[24:55] seeing you back there brother Tim being
[24:57] a grandpa I like I like that look amen
[25:01] amen so let's turn in our Bibles to the
[25:03] Book of Amos and
[25:07] um we just I want to make a couple
[25:10] comments and um and trust that the Lord
[25:14] will uh be our portion so instead of uh
[25:19] when we read this in instead of uh
[25:22] putting maybe uh Israel there maybe you
[25:26] could put your name there there or put
[25:29] the bride's name there or put the
[25:32] seventh Church age there but listen to
[25:35] what that is
[25:37] spoken hear this word that the Lord hath
[25:42] spoken against you oh children of Israel
[25:47] against the whole family which I brought
[25:51] up from the land of Egypt
[25:56] saying you only have I known of all the
[26:00] families of the
[26:02] earth therefore I will punish you for
[26:05] your
[26:07] iniquities can two walk together except
[26:11] they be
[26:12] agreed will a lion war in the forest
[26:16] when he hath no prey will a young lion
[26:20] cry out of his den if he had taken
[26:24] nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon
[26:29] the Earth where no Jin is for him shall
[26:33] one take up a snare from the earth and
[26:37] hath not Nothing At All Shall a trumpet
[26:41] be blown in the city and the people be
[26:44] Not Afraid shall there be evil in the
[26:48] city and the Lord hath not done it
[26:53] surely the Lord will do nothing but he
[26:56] reveal his secrets unto his servants the
[27:00] prophets Heavenly Father we ask you to
[27:02] bless your word your precious name we
[27:05] pray amen amen you may be
[27:11] seated he said the lion hath Ro who will
[27:15] not fear the lord God hath spoken and
[27:19] who can
[27:20] be
[27:22] um
[27:24] prophesy you know I went through uh
[27:29] a experience in a way I guess I might
[27:33] say um and it it struck me and uh a lot
[27:38] of times I believe in my personal life
[27:41] that the Lord allows me
[27:44] to uh maybe go down a certain way and uh
[27:51] I I don't quite understand it and then
[27:54] and then things will transpire and
[27:57] things will be sad there or I'll I'll
[27:59] see things and get in this situation and
[28:02] and then it uh it it strikes me and I I
[28:07] will think well you know what am I doing
[28:10] or where's this in the word or or what's
[28:14] transpiring you know what's going on
[28:16] within my own self and I found this in
[28:20] this uh this great uh event that our
[28:26] country's uh just been through this
[28:29] election and and everybody says this is
[28:33] a surprise and that's a surprise but
[28:36] we're talking here and we read out of
[28:39] Amos and we we we talked about Amos last
[28:43] Sunday and when we preached about the
[28:46] way of a true prophet and and uh so let
[28:51] let's put it back in another line of
[28:56] thinking if I could say that instead of
[28:59] the way of a true Prophet the way of a
[29:02] True
[29:04] Believer okay so a way is uh we we say
[29:10] that maybe a person is uh how do you get
[29:13] to a certain place what's the way uh the
[29:17] path that you take you know the way that
[29:20] you go from this spot to that spot and
[29:23] and or you you say you might ask
[29:26] somebody well how did you get there
[29:28] which way did you come you know you're
[29:31] 20 minutes late which way did you come
[29:34] oh you took you took oh you went that
[29:37] way uh that that way don't work you know
[29:40] there's construction that way and and
[29:43] and uh the traffic's backed up that way
[29:46] or somebody say well which way are you
[29:48] going to go to church well I'm going to
[29:50] go all the way down mid CI because they
[29:52] got all the bridges closed so a way is a
[29:57] decision that's made to get from one
[30:00] spot to
[30:02] another okay so uh so when we talk about
[30:07] the way of a true Christian we talk
[30:10] about what path is he taking to get to
[30:14] where he's going and where we're going I
[30:18] hope is we're going for a
[30:21] kingdom okay that's what we're living
[30:25] for uh uh Christianity is is something
[30:30] that is so wonderfully
[30:33] beneficial in
[30:35] itself that when I got converted and the
[30:38] Lord came in my life and I I was under
[30:42] terrible paranoia I I was suffering
[30:45] paranoia very bad that something bad
[30:48] would happen to me the police were going
[30:50] to come get me uh you know I I you know
[30:55] if I I saw certain Vehicles go down the
[30:59] road or certain sounds I would think I
[31:02] would go hide in the closet like like
[31:05] that's going to help me I was going into
[31:08] my closet for the wrong reason you know
[31:11] uh and so
[31:14] uh I was in a condition and uh and and
[31:19] and suffering now so when we talk about
[31:23] the the way of a Christian so the people
[31:27] people uh we should
[31:30] know what
[31:32] we're why we're living for what we're
[31:35] living and now Amos you remember that he
[31:39] went to the the Israel and and he looked
[31:43] out upon him and his complaint was this
[31:47] and we read this quote and I'd like to
[31:49] read it again before I make just a few
[31:52] more statements he
[31:54] says but those God anointed eyes of that
[31:58] Prophet didn't narrow because of the
[32:01] glamour so he went there and he saw a
[32:04] people that had walked away from God and
[32:08] they're very uh now they're more
[32:12] concerned about the world and what the
[32:15] world has to offer they're now working
[32:19] harder for their position in the world
[32:22] their their retirement uh their home uh
[32:26] their automobile
[32:28] uh so cares have come in that uh are
[32:33] having an effect on them it's pulling
[32:36] them they're they're now wanting to have
[32:38] more worldly knowledge and more
[32:41] education uh they want to have more prge
[32:44] and they want to wear nicer clothes and
[32:47] nicer things and and so all the time
[32:50] that they're doing this they're they're
[32:53] slowly giving up little bits of the law
[32:58] a little bit of habits that and
[33:00] traditions that they had uh they quit
[33:03] doing little things they quit washing
[33:06] the pant they they started inviting the
[33:09] Gentile over to their house for meals uh
[33:12] uh they they weren't they weren't uh
[33:15] washing the way that they used to wash
[33:17] and going through through all the
[33:20] ceremonies and you have to remember all
[33:22] those ceremonies in the Old Testament
[33:24] were put there for
[33:26] types they were Shadows of things to
[33:29] come uh they were they were incens and
[33:35] and marking post that were identifying a
[33:39] course and a way that man uh was
[33:43] supposed to uh be going like they they
[33:46] were
[33:48] landmarks uh that kept the people
[33:51] separated from the world and so that was
[33:55] what the law was given for by obedience
[33:58] to the law it was automatically going to
[34:02] separate you from those that didn't keep
[34:05] the law and that's why there was so many
[34:08] uh what we would call Holiness aspects
[34:12] built in to the law be and that man
[34:16] could follow they could actually follow
[34:19] the law
[34:20] intellectually and and of course their
[34:23] nature would fail so God provided a
[34:27] sacri sacrifice in our day he's provided
[34:31] a spirit that takes the desire for sin
[34:35] away and so uh we find out that that's
[34:38] what Amos was doing he was looking out
[34:41] over the people and started to see that
[34:43] they begin to take a different way a
[34:47] different way how they interpreted the
[34:49] law a a different way of what was
[34:52] important to
[34:53] them all of a sudden their attitudes
[34:56] changed their their desires changed the
[35:00] things that were important to them
[35:02] changed and they begin to drift away
[35:07] from God and and so that's what Amos uh
[35:12] came and said he said you you're the
[35:15] people I
[35:17] chose and and that's the first thing
[35:20] that they
[35:22] forgot they forgot their
[35:25] election they forgot that they were
[35:27] chosen they forgot that they were set
[35:30] apart they forgot that God could have
[35:33] set another people apart but he didn't
[35:37] they were who he set apart the blessing
[35:41] could have fallen on somebody else but
[35:44] it didn't it fell upon them they were
[35:48] elected they were chosen and they were
[35:52] separated now a lot then that thing
[35:55] began to get and they they like the fact
[35:57] that they were chosen but they didn't
[36:00] like the fact they were
[36:02] separated you know what I mean so that
[36:05] line begin to get murky now what do we
[36:10] call that line today they were getting
[36:15] lukewarm lukewarm so there was a a and
[36:19] lukewarm is the mixture of hot and cold
[36:22] it's when there's no
[36:24] clear definity in lines of choice so
[36:29] there's not something that's so
[36:33] definitive in your life that it
[36:38] influences the choice that you
[36:41] make so if you don't have that that that
[36:45] choice you know I've me a lot of people
[36:48] that that they're good Christians but
[36:50] they they they run after the dollar you
[36:53] know if there's a dollar there they drop
[36:56] everything and they they they they got
[36:58] to go to the dollar and I went through
[37:00] that real bad one time I remember when I
[37:03] was struggling and and I was cutting
[37:06] timber in the log woods and I got a job
[37:10] offer to work on
[37:13] Sunday and they were going to pay me in
[37:15] one day what I made a month because they
[37:20] had to have a road cut in to a piece of
[37:24] the
[37:25] forest and I remember remember oh I just
[37:29] I had I bent the
[37:32] law I figured it out that I could do
[37:35] that and not sin I studied my
[37:39] predestination and uh so you know I I I
[37:43] it was a lot of pressure on me to and of
[37:46] course the other guys the other loggers
[37:48] they wanted me to go because if if I
[37:52] went everybody would make money faster
[37:54] and and I remember going through that
[37:56] and then I remember remember I said well
[37:59] I'm not going to work on
[38:00] Sunday okay I'm I'm going to have my
[38:03] priority here and I'm not going to to do
[38:07] this and so I just made up my mind and
[38:12] and would the money have helped yeah it
[38:15] helps for a
[38:17] season you understand but I I didn't
[38:21] take the short season I took the long
[38:25] haul you know what I mean
[38:28] and and that is the way narrow is the
[38:31] path but wide is the path to destruction
[38:34] and it's very fluid but narrow is the
[38:38] way it's a narrow way and and I was a
[38:42] young believer and and I I just knew
[38:46] into the message and I really you know
[38:49] wanted to
[38:50] keep everything that was
[38:53] said well it's sad that
[38:56] time takes that away from you and so I
[39:00] remember I didn't do it and and I just
[39:03] didn't do it and and I remember that uh
[39:07] about a year later I was driving and and
[39:12] I thought you know I've been driving on
[39:14] these tires a long
[39:16] time and I looked out and my tires still
[39:19] had a lot of tread on them you know of
[39:22] course all I could afford was those
[39:24] 29 uh dollar specials you know what I
[39:27] mean they good for 20,000 mil and I was
[39:30] getting 100,000 miles I was getting a
[39:34] few extra miles per my gas and and a a
[39:39] lot of little things my electric bills
[39:41] were good and my water bills another it
[39:44] all that money I would have made showed
[39:46] up in another place plus I got more work
[39:50] than I ever could could dream of right
[39:53] next door to me and so you you find out
[39:56] that that that you you end up starting
[39:59] to find out the ways that you're going
[40:02] the the path that you're on
[40:05] uh what where's what's your end goal
[40:10] what is it is that you're trying to
[40:12] accomplish in the way that you're going
[40:15] now Israel began to forget that so this
[40:19] was this was his complaint let's go back
[40:22] to the complaint
[40:24] again and he said this he said his I is
[40:27] narrow it didn't narrow because of the
[40:29] glamour like some tourist but on the
[40:33] moral
[40:34] corruption to a people who was called to
[40:39] be blessed of
[40:40] God so they now weren't looking for
[40:43] their blessing from God you understand
[40:46] they were looking for their blessing
[40:49] from the society and the culture and the
[40:53] civilization that was around them you
[40:56] know okay if we're not careful you know
[40:58] a boom comes in and everybody wants to
[41:01] be a part of this boom and a part of
[41:03] this and a part of that and and you you
[41:06] you you you just got to learn we've got
[41:08] to learn to put on Christian
[41:11] blinders you know what I mean and just
[41:13] keep our eyes on the plow and keep our
[41:17] road going straight and so he said this
[41:20] he
[41:20] said to a people who was called to be
[41:24] blessed of God his eyes didn't look at
[41:27] the glamour they didn't narrow because
[41:29] of the
[41:31] glamour he glamour it was
[41:34] because the indecency and the corruption
[41:37] of the people that had been called to be
[41:41] chosen of
[41:43] God and would act in such a way as that
[41:49] so that's what he said so here's the
[41:51] people that's call that's called to be
[41:54] the children of God and they're acting
[41:57] in a completely different
[41:59] way so what when you act in a certain
[42:03] way you act because of your mind so
[42:07] their mind wasn't
[42:10] right you understand their affections
[42:13] had turned away from God and now their
[42:17] affections were on the things of the
[42:19] world it wasn't God first you know what
[42:23] I mean sacrifice began to drop out of
[42:27] their lives they begin and they begin to
[42:31] uh cut back on their tithing they begin
[42:34] to cut back on their uh offerings uh you
[42:38] know Amos has all this in his gospel
[42:42] that he's preaching and and so they're
[42:44] starting to make they're starting to
[42:46] make financial decisions they're
[42:48] starting to make uh uh uh social
[42:52] decisions they're they're starting to
[42:55] make uh choices based on not their
[42:59] Eternal position in God but based on the
[43:03] present tense that they're
[43:05] in and that is very tough battle because
[43:12] your present tense conditions will put
[43:15] so much pressure on us that it's hard to
[43:20] believe that if we don't do something
[43:23] that there's going to be a result come
[43:26] on us
[43:27] and is and Israel quit looking for God
[43:32] to supply their need they they they they
[43:36] couldn't take the pressure so they and
[43:39] they begin to the Glamour and the social
[43:42] and the climbing and the finance uh
[43:46] begin to get over they they begin to be
[43:50] concerned about how much money they had
[43:53] in the bank they began to be concerned
[43:56] about their pay demment and and all
[43:59] kinds of burdens began to enter in their
[44:01] life that never should been named among
[44:05] them because this is what Amos is
[44:08] telling them I've chosen you above all
[44:13] people I could have chose a lot of
[44:15] people but I chose
[44:16] you and so he goes on to say as we were
[44:21] reading he
[44:23] said and would act that way and then he
[44:27] says he see the corruption the
[44:30] Decay that's what he was looking at
[44:35] that's when he seen all of that it
[44:38] didn't attract him it sickened him at
[44:41] his soul why he was a prophet he knowed
[44:45] what God had promised to
[44:50] bless now this is what Israel is
[44:54] forgetting they're forgetting that God
[44:56] prom promised to bless them you're my
[45:00] children right I will not let you
[45:04] want you're my children I'll provide
[45:07] your every
[45:08] need they they they be so they they
[45:12] begin to come into a state you
[45:16] understand that they're beginning to
[45:18] walk away and so he and this is what he
[45:22] said he
[45:24] said he said
[45:27] and he was a prophet and he knowed what
[45:30] God
[45:32] had he he said he knowed what God had
[45:37] promised to bless and what a blessing
[45:41] was
[45:45] now Israel's forgetting
[45:49] this the blessings now have turned
[45:53] monetary the blessings now have turned
[45:56] social
[45:58] you you understand the the the things
[46:01] that used to Thrill their soul peace Joy
[46:05] longsuffering meekness those things
[46:07] aren't thrilling their souls no more
[46:10] they're they're they're they're slipping
[46:11] into carnality slowly but surely they
[46:15] don't realize it you understand they
[46:18] they don't they don't realize it they're
[46:21] being lulled
[46:23] asleep okay so look at this cuz we know
[46:27] it's a parallel of today and the and he
[46:32] knowed what God had promised to bless
[46:34] and what a blessing was and how the
[46:37] people act with the blessing so he began
[46:42] to see that they begin to act different
[46:46] than the
[46:47] blessing now back to my little
[46:52] experience so we had an
[46:55] election and so we we have this one man
[46:58] that that uh you know he's a
[47:02] Republican and and we have a a lady
[47:06] running well it that's difficult because
[47:10] one
[47:11] scripturally according to the
[47:14] Bible a woman shouldn't be in that
[47:17] position brother random said it was even
[47:20] a shame that she was that they were had
[47:23] police officers out there now that's
[47:27] very
[47:28] unpopular you understand that's almost
[47:31] now you're degrading women you're
[47:34] putting a woman on a lower level uh uh
[47:39] you have no respect for woman who are
[47:42] you to say that a woman should be in the
[47:45] kitchen and bearing
[47:48] children
[47:50] my goodness
[47:53] gracious what kind of old crank nut what
[47:57] are you a woman's got a right over her
[47:59] own body do you know that's not what the
[48:01] Bible
[48:03] says the Bible says the they have power
[48:07] over one another's bodies oh but all
[48:10] this is slipping away from the
[48:13] church they don't even
[48:16] know what the law taught
[48:19] anymore they don't even know what the
[48:22] rules are
[48:24] anymore that's that's all gone
[48:27] politics is gone
[48:29] up and people are uh and the the
[48:33] scripture says a good soldier doesn't
[48:36] entangle themselves in the Affairs of
[48:39] the world and now we've got message of
[48:43] Believers and sisters saying I'm for G
[48:46] and we got brother I'm for
[48:51] Trump oh my you you know what I mean and
[48:55] and and she got an agenda that's you
[48:58] know like way out here and for women's
[49:02] rights and women's to do this and and
[49:04] that and this other guy's over here and
[49:06] he's he's for the rich and oh man he
[49:08] makes a lot of money he's Rich what's
[49:11] the love of
[49:12] money it's the root of all evil so
[49:16] everybody say oh I want a better economy
[49:19] I want more money what do you going to
[49:21] get when you get more money more
[49:24] evil I can take you through scripture I
[49:27] can take you to the church ages I can
[49:29] take you when Prosperity hit in the
[49:31] church age how then the open door came
[49:34] and things began how that they built
[49:36] these communities and how they begin to
[49:39] move away from God because of prosperity
[49:42] Prosperity takes you farther away from
[49:48] God it just
[49:52] does so I I I got into this
[49:58] thinking oh my
[50:00] goodness if we have a woman
[50:04] president and that and she
[50:08] wins man we're at the
[50:15] end what you going to do to this
[50:18] country it's
[50:21] terrible and then all of a sudden I I I
[50:25] find well
[50:27] a a trump
[50:28] one
[50:33] oh now the world's not going to
[50:36] end GE Jesus you you don't have to come
[50:40] so
[50:41] quick we got four more years of
[50:44] prosperity we got four more years that
[50:46] we're not going to have all kinds of
[50:48] things stuck down our throat we got four
[50:50] more years and I thought what a
[50:54] deception that's right right you know it
[50:58] says in Matthew that the last days there
[51:01] shall be many false prophets the prophet
[51:03] of God says that was false
[51:06] anointings that's right that were men
[51:10] that carried
[51:11] anointings that anointed you to think
[51:15] that they were going to do better for
[51:18] you and the other person was carrying an
[51:22] anointing both of them were working for
[51:25] the same purpose and the same goal was
[51:28] to get your eyes off of what you're
[51:31] called to live
[51:32] for that's
[51:37] right so I thought wow I felt such
[51:43] relief you know why cuz man if KLA got
[51:47] it I'd have been on my knees every day
[51:49] I'd have been reading my Bible I'd be
[51:51] studying prophecy if she showed up into
[51:54] that in that Purp dress up there I'd
[51:57] have went through the seals every line
[52:00] by line Page by page I would have
[52:02] searched the 70 weeks at Daniel man I
[52:05] was going to dig
[52:08] in oh my and I thought after I I can go
[52:12] put my shovel
[52:17] away I oh I don't have to worry the
[52:20] economy is not going to crash we're not
[52:22] going to go into oppression we're going
[52:25] to have four more good years years the
[52:27] stock market's going up everybody's
[52:29] investing they've Gone Bananas all the
[52:31] wars are going to end what's the Bible
[52:34] say it says peace and safety then comes
[52:39] sudden destruction what's happened is we
[52:42] become like Israel and we forgot what we
[52:45] were called to be when we got
[52:52] here we're letting all kinds of things
[52:54] influence us
[52:57] you want to be prosperous put God
[53:02] first all else will be added unto you
[53:06] you make a decision for the kingdom God
[53:10] is obligated to bless
[53:15] you but they forgot
[53:18] that who was keeping Israel
[53:22] alive the only time Israel ever got in
[53:25] trouble is when they quit putting God
[53:27] first when they let the law
[53:30] slip they let everybody slip they let
[53:34] things slip and so all of a sudden
[53:37] everybody in the message is so excited
[53:40] because Trump's
[53:46] president you don't think he's got horns
[53:49] in a pitchfork and a fork and
[53:53] tail you just like a male devil bigger
[53:56] than you do a female devil but they're
[53:59] on the same
[54:00] side they're working for the same goal
[54:04] they're the author of confusion they
[54:06] work this confusion be beautifully they
[54:09] pull the the wool over everybody's eyes
[54:13] oh we're in better shape now or we'll be
[54:16] in better shape than we would if they if
[54:19] your spiritually corrupt it doesn't
[54:22] matter who's there come on that's right
[54:26] that's about who's controlling your
[54:30] life I thought in my heart I thought man
[54:32] if that woman livs i' turning off the
[54:34] radio for good I'm never going to listen
[54:36] to another newscast I'm not going to
[54:39] listen to No Talking Heads I'm going to
[54:41] go into my own little world and live in
[54:44] my own little
[54:46] shell well you want to know something
[54:49] that's where I should be all the
[54:52] time so now I got somebody oh I want to
[54:55] listen to him
[54:59] now what one group saying well he's
[55:02] Hitler he's the he's a
[55:05] fascist you know be be afraid be afraid
[55:08] and and and and liar and and the other
[55:12] one's doom
[55:13] and I I didn't hear one of
[55:17] them say God so loved the world he gave
[55:21] his only begotten son I didn't hear one
[55:23] of them say what we need to do is read
[55:25] our Bible Bibles and realize the fact
[55:29] that God fulfilled Malachi 4:5 Luke
[55:33] 17:30 revelations 10:7 in our day God
[55:36] sent a Prophet by which this nation
[55:39] should live
[55:42] by and we need to return back to the
[55:46] word of
[55:47] God that would have been the
[55:51] truth so alls it is is certain people
[55:55] like certain lives
[55:58] I love the LIE when they come up to me
[56:00] and say brother McGary you're looking
[56:02] thinner than you ever have yes sir I've
[56:05] been working on
[56:08] it yeah you like the flattery you like
[56:12] the L you like the
[56:14] security all of a sudden you feel so
[56:17] much more
[56:20] secure let me tell this is the same
[56:24] Prophet our Prophet said
[56:27] now you go right back over he preaches a
[56:30] message called
[56:31] spiritual
[56:33] Amnesia so he preaches the way of a true
[56:37] Prophet okay he's explaining why
[56:40] Amos had to say the things that he
[56:46] said because he was a true Prophet
[56:49] regardless of what it appeared he only
[56:52] looked at them through the eyes of the
[56:55] word
[56:57] yes now I hope I have that
[57:02] disease I hope I look at you only
[57:05] Through The Eyes of the word that's
[57:07] right I don't care what you think I
[57:10] don't care how you feel the most
[57:13] important thing to me is the word and
[57:17] for you to put the word first because if
[57:21] you do you'll get blessed and I I hate
[57:24] to see people in the same place the same
[57:28] Financial condition the same situation
[57:31] everything's the same in their life
[57:34] because they're caught in a cycle where
[57:36] they never can make that decision to
[57:39] sacrifice everything to put God
[57:46] first and they miss
[57:49] it they miss it it doesn't matter what
[57:53] decision that you make
[57:56] a lot of decisions people make don't
[57:58] even make sense to me why would you do
[58:01] that why would you do this why would you
[58:04] do
[58:06] that I hate to say this
[58:09] but I'll just be honest with you cuz it
[58:13] this I was going to run out and buy
[58:14] lesie a brand new car you can't hardly
[58:17] buy a car without paying several
[58:21] ,000 and so I I was going to trade her
[58:24] car in and so I thought I'd fix it
[58:28] up so I got some dents taken out of it
[58:31] and some scratch in and got it cleaned
[58:33] up and everything and brought it to the
[58:35] body shop then got to the body shop the
[58:38] lady in the body shop says why would you
[58:40] ever want to sell this
[58:41] car it's
[58:46] gorgeous and I got to thinking about
[58:49] it well I wanted to you know do
[58:54] something
[58:56] and then she says well I love my
[58:59] car I thought oh I'm so glad you love
[59:01] your car I just save
[59:07] $50,000 this my thinking's
[59:10] wrong you know what my thinking was
[59:14] right but God was still looking after me
[59:19] because I didn't I wasn't going to make
[59:21] one more nickel on trade in whether the
[59:24] seats were torn in that car
[59:26] whether it was full of d whether it had
[59:29] no tread on its tires I went out and got
[59:32] that car fixed up and cuz something was
[59:34] driving me to fix it up I thought it was
[59:37] to buy a new
[59:39] car but God
[59:41] was ordering my
[59:44] footsteps without me even realizing it
[59:48] and then I thought oh
[59:50] Lord how much am I missing
[59:57] and why am I missing
[1:00:01] it why all of a sudden that I feel a
[1:00:05] great relief of spiritual pressure and
[1:00:09] the pressure of the end of the world the
[1:00:13] pressure of the soon coming of the Lord
[1:00:16] Jesus Christ the idea that I've seen
[1:00:19] prophecy being fulfilled so fast and all
[1:00:22] of a sudden a guy gets a landslide
[1:00:24] election and prophet
[1:00:29] stops now that's one powerful dude right
[1:00:33] he can stop prophecy no no nothing
[1:00:41] stopped when they talk on their speeches
[1:00:44] the one person gets up says we're one
[1:00:46] we're going for the other one person
[1:00:48] gets up we might have lost but we
[1:00:49] haven't quit fighting we're still going
[1:00:52] to push what we believe in how can two
[1:00:56] walk together unless they agree they
[1:01:00] will never agree America's
[1:01:06] gone and if you let
[1:01:10] this guy persuade you all of a sudden
[1:01:15] things are better because he got elected
[1:01:18] then you're
[1:01:20] deceived and if you thought that could
[1:01:23] that she would be better for the country
[1:01:26] you're deceived there's only one thing
[1:01:29] that saves the believer and that's full
[1:01:32] obedience to the word of
[1:01:35] God it's putting Jesus Christ first in
[1:01:38] your life acting like a Christian what
[1:01:43] Christian principles are and let the
[1:01:45] love of God be shed abroad in Your Heart
[1:01:48] by the Holy Ghost but what happened so
[1:01:51] what did Amos see so now go he preaches
[1:01:56] he preaches the way of a true prophet
[1:01:59] and he
[1:02:00] establishes Amos as being Vindicated to
[1:02:05] see and to call out now he goes preaches
[1:02:10] spiritual Amnesia and he preaches that
[1:02:13] message and he's telling you what Amos
[1:02:16] saw and what it was that Amos was
[1:02:20] calling out and so I'm I want to read
[1:02:24] just a few statements
[1:02:27] and close he
[1:02:31] says and he he makes a few little little
[1:02:34] statements and then uh we'll just close
[1:02:37] service and if anybody wants to stay for
[1:02:40] a few hours I think we might need a
[1:02:42] little bit of help setting up chairs
[1:02:44] next door uh and we'll talk a little a
[1:02:48] few little things but he says this and
[1:02:50] this is out of spiritual Amnesia and if
[1:02:53] you could read these two books together
[1:02:55] it it would really be a blessing so way
[1:02:58] of a true Prophet is is preached in uh
[1:03:04] uh June uh well no I think May is
[1:03:09] 51362 and he comes back and preaches
[1:03:13] spiritual Amnesia in
[1:03:16] 41164 he says well when you look at at a
[1:03:20] city and you look at a people you look
[1:03:24] at a church
[1:03:26] and you look at a people that's so far
[1:03:30] away from God there isn't nothing but to
[1:03:35] diagnose but
[1:03:37] sin what is sin unbelief there's so far
[1:03:42] away from God because they don't believe
[1:03:44] he's coming
[1:03:45] soon they don't believe the law matters
[1:03:49] they don't believe their decisions have
[1:03:51] consequences they don't search for the
[1:03:54] way what the Lord would do how they
[1:03:57] would approach it they don't place the
[1:03:59] timing of their
[1:04:01] actions they actually are out of control
[1:04:06] driven by all kinds of different ideas
[1:04:09] and
[1:04:10] Spirits he said so that's sin which is
[1:04:14] unbelief the wages of sin is death it's
[1:04:22] dying America's dying
[1:04:26] this guy is not going to come in and
[1:04:28] breathe life into
[1:04:32] America he's just going to make
[1:04:34] everybody get farther away from
[1:04:40] God well what would you have done if the
[1:04:43] other person would have elected well I
[1:04:46] hope the people that knew prophecy it
[1:04:49] would drive them closer to God but he
[1:04:53] ought to drive you closer to God if you
[1:04:56] have spiritual eyes have if you can
[1:05:01] see his poisons just a little more easy
[1:05:05] to
[1:05:08] eat or maybe
[1:05:10] not I don't know I just
[1:05:13] know he's a
[1:05:15] liar she's a liar Satan's a liar and
[1:05:20] there's no truth in them
[1:05:30] it's dying the diagnose proves what it
[1:05:34] is you see when people get away from God
[1:05:38] and won't listen to the word you have no
[1:05:42] more desire for the word then there's
[1:05:46] one diagnosis to it the soul that sinth
[1:05:50] the soul shall die unbelief shall
[1:05:54] separate you from God that's exactly
[1:06:00] right unbelief separates you from God
[1:06:04] the diagnosis is we're dying and all of
[1:06:08] a sudden that struck me what in the
[1:06:12] world is what was
[1:06:16] that this relief I
[1:06:22] felt what's that I I don't want
[1:06:28] that Satan appears as an angel of
[1:06:32] Light things will be better now we're
[1:06:36] not going to go down the tubes yeah you
[1:06:39] are what's wrong with you David you know
[1:06:42] better than
[1:06:44] that what is this relief it's an
[1:06:50] anointing it's an anointing
[1:06:56] oh everybody thought we were going in
[1:06:57] the wrong direction what direction were
[1:07:00] you going
[1:07:04] in nobody knows what direction they're
[1:07:07] going in what direction are you going
[1:07:10] in let's hope we're going up let's hope
[1:07:14] we're living for up let's hope we're
[1:07:16] praying even so come Lord
[1:07:18] Jesus you know you don't say oh my
[1:07:21] goodness gracious I'm
[1:07:23] I'm man I I just got
[1:07:27] saved from all kinds of trouble and
[1:07:30] confusion and and everything well you
[1:07:32] know maybe a little trouble and
[1:07:34] confusion a little pressure might just
[1:07:35] do us some
[1:07:38] good there's no relief here it's the
[1:07:41] biggest deception is going on and the
[1:07:44] worst part of it is it's happening right
[1:07:46] in the framework of this message people
[1:07:48] are becoming political people are siding
[1:07:51] with opinions they're siding with
[1:07:54] agendas and and God's got one
[1:07:57] agenda build yourself in the Statue of a
[1:08:00] perfect man if the same spirit that was
[1:08:03] in Christ Jesus dwell in you it shall
[1:08:05] Quicken your mortal
[1:08:08] body so that's what he said he
[1:08:11] said he says now once one diagnoses so
[1:08:17] so he he talks about it so what he's
[1:08:19] saying is now and he preached in this
[1:08:21] message they've got amnesia he says and
[1:08:25] another thing that cause it ca that he's
[1:08:29] talking about Amnesia now he says listen
[1:08:31] to what causes people to
[1:08:35] forget where they're going what they're
[1:08:38] doing where they've been that's what
[1:08:41] amnesia is it it's a
[1:08:45] total lack of
[1:08:49] remembrance of what's you've been
[1:08:52] through who you've been associated with
[1:08:55] where you've been working all of a
[1:08:58] sudden I got hit in the head I had I had
[1:09:00] a very bad conduct conduction in an
[1:09:03] accident and I was suffering with
[1:09:05] amnesia I had just got
[1:09:09] married and lesie came in the room and I
[1:09:12] looked at her I
[1:09:14] said who are
[1:09:19] you and she said well I'm your wife I
[1:09:22] went oh
[1:09:25] no
[1:09:28] recollection at
[1:09:30] all we just went through a statue of a
[1:09:33] perfect man and what does he say he who
[1:09:35] does not add these things cannot see a
[1:09:37] far off and forgot where he's come
[1:09:41] from
[1:09:42] Amnesia you haven't been through this
[1:09:45] word journey to forget that you were
[1:09:48] trying to go for a
[1:09:50] Rapture what kind of Amnesia has struck
[1:09:53] us
[1:09:55] what kind of Amnesia is letting us start
[1:09:58] to let the bars down and think that
[1:10:02] we're safe now because the stock market
[1:10:05] went
[1:10:07] up well you know the higher things go
[1:10:11] the farther they
[1:10:14] fall so listen another thing that causes
[1:10:19] among the people is getting between two
[1:10:21] opinions
[1:10:29] what was this whole election about two
[1:10:34] different
[1:10:39] opinions how many people got caught in
[1:10:42] between two different
[1:10:48] opinions to be honest we don't have a
[1:10:51] say in the
[1:10:53] matter another thing that causes people
[1:10:56] to get and have amnesia to forget their
[1:10:59] past forget where they come from forget
[1:11:01] where they're going another thing that
[1:11:03] causes it among the people is getting
[1:11:04] between two opinions that causes
[1:11:08] Amnesia and it gets you to a place where
[1:11:12] you
[1:11:13] actually what you've
[1:11:15] done you've lost your
[1:11:21] reasons you've lost your reason
[1:11:26] the reason I do this why I lost the
[1:11:29] reason I go to church on Sunday I lost
[1:11:32] the reason why I listen to tapes I lost
[1:11:35] the reason why I left my Bible they
[1:11:38] forgot the
[1:11:41] reason it astounds me how the prophet of
[1:11:45] God has covered the condition that the
[1:11:49] churches in tonight perfectly in his
[1:11:52] message word by word we we forgot we
[1:11:56] have an absolute we forgot we have a
[1:11:59] supernatural
[1:12:01] discerner the word of God that was
[1:12:04] preached to us to discern these things
[1:12:07] for
[1:12:09] us he said and and you don't know the
[1:12:14] reasons you've lost your
[1:12:16] mind you you you can't make you don't
[1:12:22] know who you are you can identify
[1:12:27] yourself you can you can walk around eat
[1:12:31] and everything but you still can't
[1:12:34] identify yourself you have got your
[1:12:38] scholarly
[1:12:40] education same education you had but you
[1:12:44] don't know where it come from and you
[1:12:46] don't know who you are and where you
[1:12:50] belong that's amnesia
[1:12:56] oh
[1:12:58] my now what's he talking about spiritual
[1:13:03] Amnesia so God has people in the last
[1:13:07] days has forgotten what the testimony of
[1:13:12] being a Christian
[1:13:18] means it's again this Amnesia has become
[1:13:24] among the people and they can't identify
[1:13:28] themselves they forgot all about it they
[1:13:32] had forgot his Holiness they have forgot
[1:13:35] his law the women were living like the
[1:13:38] rest of the women God's church and his
[1:13:42] people has always been a separated
[1:13:45] people a called out people A peculiar
[1:13:50] people a holy nation a
[1:13:53] royal priesthood
[1:13:55] offering spiritual sacrifices to God the
[1:13:59] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:14:03] his name God called his church
[1:14:07] and separated it from the world for that
[1:14:13] very purpose
[1:14:16] amen he gave it a
[1:14:18] law he and he must be holy and said I am
[1:14:23] Holy you must be holy holy and without
[1:14:26] Holiness no man shall
[1:14:29] see
[1:14:31] God God said that
[1:14:36] himself and then he makes this statement
[1:14:38] he says I want to stop here a minute to
[1:14:40] say the same thing among our people
[1:14:43] today that's call themselves Christians
[1:14:46] their character oh if they would only
[1:14:50] realize and
[1:14:52] so I I just think that
[1:14:56] uh going into these
[1:14:58] meetings uh if there's something that a
[1:15:02] theme or something that's on my
[1:15:06] heart and I would ask maybe you would
[1:15:10] think about it and pray and meditate
[1:15:13] with me is I want to be about my
[1:15:16] father's
[1:15:19] business okay I don't want to be about
[1:15:22] the business of the world I don't want
[1:15:24] to find my place in the world I don't
[1:15:27] want to find anything the world has to
[1:15:30] offer I want to be about my father's
[1:15:33] business and what determines that is
[1:15:39] not what the world uses to determine
[1:15:47] success what are you measuring yourself
[1:15:50] against Israel stopped measuring
[1:15:54] themselves
[1:15:55] against the word of God and begin to
[1:15:58] measure themselves against
[1:16:01] civilization
[1:16:03] education and
[1:16:05] Science and that's how they begin to
[1:16:08] judge themselves and you know what
[1:16:10] happens to a Christian when he starts
[1:16:13] looking around them seeing the success
[1:16:16] of people seeing this seeing that and oh
[1:16:19] I've never had nothing I I I can't go on
[1:16:23] like this forever and and everything and
[1:16:27] they just get into that place that
[1:16:31] that what am I I I'm I'm going to do an
[1:16:37] Amnesia sets
[1:16:40] in they become
[1:16:44] uncontent there's not a a steadfast
[1:16:49] deep seated
[1:16:51] joy in their heart that nothing can
[1:16:56] pluck me out of the palm of his
[1:17:01] hand and he
[1:17:03] said the righteous shall not beg bread
[1:17:07] if I put him first I will not beg bread
[1:17:12] if I lose my house there's a reason for
[1:17:15] it if I lose my car it'll work out
[1:17:20] everything will be B but when you start
[1:17:23] measuring yourself
[1:17:25] by the world you have no peace you have
[1:17:29] no joy because the peace and joy of God
[1:17:34] surpasses understanding and the prophet
[1:17:36] of God preached a whole message called
[1:17:38] lean not to thy own understanding so if
[1:17:43] I measure Myself by the world I'll be
[1:17:46] about the world's
[1:17:47] business a carnal mind is enity against
[1:17:52] God but a spiritual mind is is joy and
[1:17:56] peace and happiness so this
[1:18:00] meeting when you come to this meeting
[1:18:02] come I with this in your heart
[1:18:08] nothing no
[1:18:11] Ambitions no
[1:18:13] goals no Lord I need this
[1:18:16] blessing I need that blessing just come
[1:18:21] and say
[1:18:22] Lord speak to me
[1:18:26] amen I want to be
[1:18:29] reestablished in your
[1:18:34] business I want to be about my father's
[1:18:38] business and you allow that to come and
[1:18:42] you just come and I believe God will
[1:18:44] speak to you in such a mighty
[1:18:48] way that you'll find out there's
[1:18:53] nothing in in this world to hold me
[1:18:59] here
[1:19:02] and
[1:19:03] it I I I I can't tell you what will
[1:19:08] happen either way but I know one thing
[1:19:12] God never changes his mind about his
[1:19:17] word so don't don't get excited and
[1:19:22] don't get discouraged this whole thing
[1:19:25] is nothing but a deception God bless you
[1:19:30] so uh brother Chris do we still we do we

[1:26:10] God you know what I mean I've got a
[1:26:13] garment coming a a robe white as
[1:26:16] snow you know what I mean that's the
[1:26:18] robe I
[1:26:19] want I already went through
[1:26:22] that I'm just confessing
[1:26:25] so I got into this dress for success
[1:26:28] thing when I was about 35 years old a
[1:26:32] long time ago so I went and got me a
[1:26:35] really nice pair of alligator shoes you
[1:26:37] know and I had an alligator bike now
[1:26:40] like that was going to make me
[1:26:43] money I'm going to buy a pair what do
[1:26:45] you think this is something like Wizard
[1:26:47] of Oz you know you get a certain pair of
[1:26:49] shoes on and you're going to fly into
[1:26:51] success so I got and so I went and got
[1:26:54] this
[1:26:54] suit and I found this
[1:26:57] material that was from England and it
[1:27:01] had the Royal stamp on it so this was
[1:27:04] the material they used for the royal
[1:27:08] family and I so I G to have a suit made
[1:27:12] well it I wasn't going to just get a
[1:27:13] suit I was going to have me a tailored
[1:27:15] made suit all in my mind thinking that
[1:27:21] this was going to be successful
[1:27:24] and I began to hang around with
[1:27:26] successful
[1:27:30] people I forgot the
[1:27:33] scripture narrow is the way to heaven
[1:27:36] and people that find it but all of a
[1:27:38] sudden I want to be around all these
[1:27:40] guys that were making money and liked
[1:27:42] everything well you know never Dawn them
[1:27:44] the reason they're making money is
[1:27:45] they're cheaters they're liars and
[1:27:47] they're
[1:27:50] deceivers you'll never be successful the
[1:27:53] way they'll be successful cuz you're not
[1:27:56] willing to pay the
[1:27:58] price so I got this beautiful suit I
[1:28:02] finally wore it to church well first of
[1:28:04] all I found out there wasn't one
[1:28:06] Christian that could tell the difference
[1:28:08] between penny loafers and alligator
[1:28:11] shoes so that didn't
[1:28:14] matter to them a belt was a belt and the
[1:28:17] best I got out of a compliment oh you
[1:28:19] got a new
[1:28:21] suit yeah is that all you can
[1:28:26] say this is Royal
[1:28:30] wool well I forgot the real wool that I
[1:28:34] was supposed to have so there I go so we
[1:28:37] go out to eat and here comes a sister
[1:28:40] nice real Christian sister and she has a
[1:28:44] jar of baby
[1:28:46] food and it's some sort of orange banana
[1:28:51] squashed baby food
[1:28:54] she dropped it right in front of me it
[1:28:57] hit the floor and came all the way up my
[1:29:01] suit up and then down this
[1:29:08] side it only took one service for that
[1:29:12] suit to make the
[1:29:14] Rapture cuz it was
[1:29:17] gone
[1:29:21] ruined and the only success
[1:29:24] I got from all those clothes was a
[1:29:28] lesson from the Lord you don't dress the
[1:29:32] outside man for Success you dress the
[1:29:35] Inside Man and he promised that you
[1:29:39] would be
[1:29:42] successful okay so the church will be
[1:29:46] hot and the church will be
[1:29:50] cold the sound will be loud and the the
[1:29:54] sound will be
[1:29:57] soft some of the instruments will be
[1:29:59] louder than other
[1:30:02] instruments I know everybody's like
[1:30:05] going to a little Le game I thought you
[1:30:08] know every parents looking only at their
[1:30:13] kid nobody cares what you're doing or
[1:30:16] what your kids's doing they're not there
[1:30:18] for your
[1:30:20] kid they're there because they think

[1:30:25] major league

[1:30:29] majors fatten
[1:30:31] 300 let's get real it's not going to be
[1:30:35] perfect but if you're
[1:30:37] perfect in your heart and you're perfect
[1:30:42] in your motivate objective then a lot of
[1:30:45] this other stuff just don't
[1:30:50] matter if you complain where the Deacons
[1:30:54] sit you here you would probably complain
[1:30:56] at the wedding
[1:31:00] supper when am I sitting way down here

[1:31:06] who were arguing about who got to sit
[1:31:09] where sit down wherever you're put be
[1:31:12] happy you're

[1:32:45] issue the pastor has supreme

[1:32:54] left side and I put the forks on the
[1:32:56] right side I don't care what the

[1:37:03] political environment and where we put
[1:37:07] our trust and where we put our
[1:37:11] hope and Lord we know beyond the shadow
[1:37:14] of a doubt that
[1:37:18] our Angel to our age told us
[1:37:23] that his coming was
[1:37:26] overdue and that he could come at any
[1:37:28] minute or any
[1:37:31] time and even the Lord himself speaking
