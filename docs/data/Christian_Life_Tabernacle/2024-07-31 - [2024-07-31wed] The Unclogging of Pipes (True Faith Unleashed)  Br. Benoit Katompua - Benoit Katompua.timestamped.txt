[20:36] uh uh those that were able to come uh
[20:39] I've said it there and I say it again it
[20:41] was a tremendous blessing amen for my
[20:43] church um to be able to have the
[20:45] fellowship there and maybe if you're
[20:47] here and you say well we didn't get to
[20:48] hardly visit with anybody well I'm
[20:49] working on trying to get my people to
[20:51] talk more uh and so but uh we sure
[20:54] appreciate it and brother Matthew amen
[20:56] the the ministering of the word was just
[20:58] one wonderful and and the Lord knows
[21:00] most of you probably don't have any idea
[21:02] man the things that we went through to
[21:03] get to the meetings um but this morning
[21:07] they want you to they want me to change
[21:09] all right
[21:11] amen that works amen sometimes you just
[21:15] got to you just got to adapt to the
[21:19] situation amen do I need to start over
[21:21] no I'm not going to start over I do want
[21:23] to say that we appreciated brother
[21:24] brother Matthew again in his ministry
[21:27] amen it was a blessing to our church
[21:28] there was a lot of things that happened
[21:31] um to get to that point and this morning
[21:34] I woke up and there's a lot of songs
[21:37] that we can sing but this song's been on
[21:39] my heart all day and it just seems like
[21:41] uh with everything that's going on the
[21:43] testimony or the prayer request for the
[21:45] the family in Louisiana uh you know
[21:48] maybe perhaps you've had a rough week
[21:50] maybe you've had a rough year maybe
[21:52] you've got something that's going on
[21:53] whatever it is one thing that we can say
[21:56] is that in every situation a Believer
[21:58] learns constantly that they have nothing
[22:00] but trusting in
[22:01] Jesus and and to me that's our hope you
[22:05] you somebody wonder why are you even
[22:07] here tonight well I'm not here for just
[22:10] religion or just to pass the time but I
[22:13] think we're here because we know there's
[22:14] only one one person that we can go to
[22:16] and that's Christ and that we can come
[22:18] and we can offer ourselves tonight in
[22:20] the church service by sacrifice say Lord
[22:22] I'm here and I want to thank you that
[22:23] you've brought me through every trial
[22:25] and no matter what is coming my way I I
[22:27] have no clue what it is but I know that
[22:29] if I just hold close to him he'll get me
[22:31] through it this is a song that we all
[22:33] know and uh so it's nothing special it's
[22:35] just perhaps maybe you could sing it
[22:37] with me if this is your testimony as
[22:39] well amen it's just through it all I've
[22:41] learned to trust in Jesus amen let's
[22:43] sing

[22:56] didn't know right from

[23:04] situation God gave blessed
[23:08] consolation that my Trials come to only

[32:57] Faith isn't an assurance Lord Jesus and
[32:59] we are certain father that if we come in
[33:02] your house Lord Jesus you said forsake
[33:05] not to Gathering amongst each other Lord
[33:07] you said where two or three are gathered
[33:09] in their midst will I be Lord Jesus
[33:11] father we trust that you are here Lord
[33:13] Jesus we've done the man part by
[33:16] arriving father we're asking you to do
[33:18] the god part in being with us in this
[33:20] time we leave everything else into your
[33:22] hands Lord Jesus I ask this in your
[33:25] precious holy powerful and wonderful
[33:27] name
[33:29] amen I trust we're gathered to be in the
[33:31] house of the Lord
[33:33] tonight let's just turn
[33:35] our Bibles over to the Book of Psalms
[33:38] while you're
[33:47] standing we're going to read in Psalms 8
[33:50] I believe
[34:07] the scripture
[34:08] reads oh Lord our Lord how excellent is
[34:13] thy name and all the Earth who hath set
[34:16] thy Glory above the heavens out of the
[34:19] mouth of babes and sucklings H has thou
[34:21] ordained strength because of thine
[34:23] enemies that thou mightest steal the
[34:26] enemy and the Avenger
[34:28] when I consider thy Heavens the work of
[34:31] thy fingers the moon and the stars which
[34:34] thou has ordained what is man that thou
[34:37] are mindful of him and the son of man
[34:40] that thou visitest him for thou has made
[34:42] him a little lower than the angels and
[34:45] has crowned him with Glory and Honor
[34:47] thou mest him to have dominion over the
[34:50] works of thy hands thou has put all
[34:52] things under his feet thou has put all
[34:56] things under under his feet all sheep
[34:59] and oxen yay and the beasts of the field
[35:02] to the fowl of the air and the fish of
[35:05] the sea and whatsoever passes through
[35:07] the paths of the Seas our Lord our oh
[35:11] Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name
[35:14] and all the Earth may the Lord add a
[35:17] blessing to the reading of his word you
[35:18] may be seated
[35:29] I don't think I'll be long but we'll
[35:37] see the Lord put a uh a more of a
[35:41] question in my heart
[35:43] for a while now that I've been
[35:46] pondering and I know we've been speaking
[35:48] about traditions and speaking about the
[35:52] effects of traditions and how that works
[35:56] with man
[35:58] and you know praying and trusting in the
[36:00] leadership of the Lord trying to you
[36:03] know you don't want to beat a dead
[36:05] horse but at the same time if the Lord
[36:07] wants you to stay in a channel it
[36:10] doesn't matter if you think it's beating
[36:11] a dead horse somebody needs to hear it
[36:15] so the Lord put on my heart that sto the
[36:17] unclogging of
[36:20] pipes and the subtext or you know
[36:24] subject you could say would be true
[36:26] Faith Unleashed
[36:29] and uh last time we were here and we
[36:32] spoke we we touched on a quote that
[36:35] brother brandom spoke on in proof of his
[36:37] resurrection this is merely just to lay
[36:41] something down for the thought that God
[36:43] put on my heart in paragraph 31 it says
[36:46] now Jesus spoke the same thing when he
[36:49] was here on Earth he said ye are blind
[36:51] leaders of the blind he said if the
[36:53] blind leads the blind won't they all
[36:55] fall in the ditch now pronouncing
[36:58] Christian or religious teachers blind
[37:00] see God has a way of revealing himself
[37:03] to the people and making himself known
[37:05] to the people but many times tradition
[37:08] shuts off the people before God can get
[37:10] a chance to get into them to reveal
[37:12] himself see you get it see Traditions
[37:15] all what that is
[37:17] today and it got me thinking
[37:21] because the the the problem isn't just
[37:27] tradition we've we've we've got into
[37:29] that and kind of expressed what the Lord
[37:32] had on our heart in that part and now
[37:35] the Lord's moved in a way that now the
[37:38] thought's been in my heart
[37:40] of if I'm here for a
[37:43] purpose if Christ has brought me here
[37:45] for a
[37:46] reason and I need to yield myself so
[37:49] that he might have his way and use me in
[37:51] whatever manner he sees fit in order to
[37:55] do that I have to get out of the way
[37:58] I have to get things out of my life
[38:00] brother Brandon would type and the
[38:02] scriptures would type you are a
[38:04] temple your body is a place where the
[38:06] Lord dwells so if the Lord's dwelling in
[38:09] your house what kind of a home have you
[38:11] opened for
[38:12] him we we want to be real careful with
[38:16] how we present oursel when it comes to
[38:18] the Lord you know as as we heard it says
[38:22] the Lord has a way of revealing himself
[38:25] he's wanting to make himself known
[38:28] show you in another sense you could say
[38:31] another piece of the puzzle but until
[38:34] you can get out of your own set ways
[38:38] which is what tradition is is a set way
[38:42] then God can't really use
[38:44] you as I pondered on this thought I fell
[38:47] upon the sermon but preach there's a lot
[38:49] of quotes from this sermon uh the
[38:51] fundamental foundation for faith brother
[38:55] Brandon would speak about Adam how Adam
[38:56] in the beginning beginning was a
[38:59] son he was like
[39:02] God what he said came to pass he was a
[39:06] son with full Authority brother bam said
[39:08] he had unconscious faith meaning it
[39:11] wasn't something that he was consciously
[39:13] trying to muster up it's just he knew if
[39:16] I say something it has to be whatever I
[39:19] speak I have an authority behind what I
[39:21] utter that will bring it to pass amen
[39:24] not because of who he was uhhuh but
[39:28] because of who God made him when God
[39:31] said he made him in the likeness of
[39:33] himself see Adam oh this is amazing Adam
[39:38] is you and I because we have been
[39:42] brought now to what it is that Adam had
[39:45] lost Adam had full dominion and
[39:48] Authority brother brandham said he was a
[39:50] master of
[39:53] circumstances how often we when
[39:55] circumstances arise do we consider
[39:58] ourselves masters of
[40:00] circumstances or do we have things that
[40:02] have clogged up the pipe the flow in
[40:05] which God supposed to bring forth his
[40:07] Revelation to
[40:08] you is it busyness of life is it
[40:13] work is it school is it
[40:17] relationship what's in the
[40:19] pipeline when you're building the home
[40:21] you have a water M the water man is the
[40:24] source that connects to the main and it
[40:26] brings forth water into the building and
[40:29] that water gets dispersed you have a
[40:30] bathroom you may have a sink you may
[40:32] have something else but if you shut off
[40:34] the valve in the water man then the
[40:36] building doesn't get any water now a
[40:39] building without water you can't really
[40:42] do much
[40:43] in it's missing a key
[40:46] piece you're the temple of God brother
[40:49] Brandon would say that you there's a
[40:51] pipe that you're directly connected to
[40:53] that is Christ and anything you put in
[40:56] the way
[40:57] from God letting his Water of Life flow
[41:01] so that you might become a son a true
[41:03] son with true Faith like Adam was see
[41:07] Adam never questioned anything Adam
[41:10] never doubted anything Adam never
[41:13] thought for one second oh man you know
[41:16] I'm not God I'm I'm I'm just his
[41:19] creation I'm I'm this I don't have
[41:21] authority I don't have you show me where
[41:24] that was described because the Adam that
[41:26] we knew
[41:27] that if he spoke to a mountain it was
[41:30] moved if he told the the the lion come
[41:33] forth come let's have fun the lion came
[41:35] forth he had complete authority over
[41:40] everything but would say once again it's
[41:42] a unconscious
[41:46] faith I I'll give you an example how
[41:48] many here Believers are going to wake up
[41:50] tomorrow what's your
[41:53] Assurance what's the proof that you'll
[41:55] be alive tomorrow that you'll wake up
[41:57] tomorrow how do you know you wake up and
[42:01] you're on
[42:02] autopilot if it's work you get up how do
[42:04] you know your car is going to start you
[42:06] just get in your car you start you go to
[42:08] work how you know you'll make it how do
[42:11] you know you'll finish work see you're
[42:13] operating in the unconscious realm but
[42:15] according to things of the Physical
[42:17] Realm God wants you to operate that
[42:20] unconscious faith in the spiritual realm
[42:22] and if we're not careful we start just
[42:25] going by the ways of life every days
[42:27] like this every month's like this and
[42:29] year and so forth and you're not really
[42:31] progressing into anything that Christ
[42:33] wants you to be spiritually brother
[42:36] Brandon would say that man was made with
[42:37] a
[42:38] purpose he has to fulfill his purpose in
[42:42] this day brother B would say that after
[42:45] the fall what happened with Adam was he
[42:48] lost
[42:50] consciousness of what Authority he
[42:54] had he could no longer speak
[42:57] and what it is that he spoke came to
[42:59] pass because something now was clogging
[43:02] that pipe see beforeand there was
[43:06] nothing in Adam's
[43:08] way but after the fall now he had
[43:11] himself in the way this is something
[43:15] that he did the Lord told him the day
[43:17] you eat thereof the day you'll die he
[43:20] fed on it you reap what you
[43:22] sow we we have we have to watch
[43:25] ourselves
[43:27] brother would say that now in our hands
[43:29] has been restored what Adam
[43:33] lost complete Authority
[43:37] Dominion the scripture says you were
[43:39] made to
[43:41] rule you were given power over all
[43:45] things you're a master of circumstance
[43:49] that's right amen you give me the
[43:51] circumstance God can't
[43:55] master either you've got something in
[43:57] the pipeline stopping that Revelation
[44:00] for that specific
[44:02] circumstance that you think no this is
[44:04] too much for God God don't care about
[44:07] this I've been struggling with this for
[44:09] so long the spirit's been battling me
[44:11] I've been fighting with it I don't know
[44:13] how to get past
[44:14] it it's so easy to minister to somebody
[44:18] else about the things of the lord it's
[44:21] so easy to tell somebody just have faith
[44:23] in God just trust in God he'll answer to
[44:27] you he'll give you what your heart
[44:29] desires that's easy but when it really
[44:32] comes down to you see what you're really
[44:34] saying is man have faith in God in the
[44:37] back of your mind you're saying Lord
[44:38] don't bring that in my
[44:40] doorstep I just I just have enough for
[44:42] him for me to tell him and let him know
[44:45] what he needs to do but the moment it
[44:47] comes to do to you now now you're
[44:49] stepping back lord I I don't I don't
[44:51] know what to do how do how do I figure
[44:52] this out well what do I need to exhaust
[44:54] okay I need to do this I need to do that
[44:56] I need to do this I need to do
[44:58] that that's not the authority that was
[45:01] promised it wasn't an I need to
[45:04] do it's this is going to happen am I
[45:08] hope this takes place no no no no I
[45:09] don't hope I know it'll happen I may not
[45:13] know when or how but I believe because
[45:17] I've been given Authority that anything
[45:19] that I speak has to come by come on now
[45:24] regardless of the circumstance that you
[45:27] see yes regardless of the mockers
[45:31] regardless of all the different
[45:33] situations if Christ said he's given you
[45:37] Authority you're his son you're heir to
[45:40] All
[45:42] Things how could you be air to all
[45:48] things but beat yourself up every two
[45:55] minutes you know what I I I'm not air to
[45:57] all things I'm just you know last last
[46:01] last week you know I made a mistake man
[46:03] you know just you know just before
[46:05] coming here you know I made a mistake
[46:06] man I I was talking bad about that
[46:08] person I shouldn't have been doing that
[46:10] man I'm not going to pray why come to
[46:12] church it's pointless you see the
[46:14] condition I'm in how is God going to
[46:15] speak to me how's God going to tell me
[46:18] something how's he going to use
[46:21] me when did God ask for your condition
[46:24] to be the
[46:25] cause am his will will come to pass in
[46:29] spite of you regardless of you our
[46:34] problem is we work too much in the
[46:36] Physical Realm we see too much 1+ 1
[46:39] equals 2 in the kingdom of God 1 plus 1
[46:42] is not to for a day to God is but a
[46:45] thousand years so now you do your math
[46:49] and let God do his math he truly is the
[46:52] god of impossible math when situations
[46:55] seem like they can't be figured out when
[46:58] circumstances feel like there's no
[46:59] answer to them when it seems that your
[47:02] strength has run out that's a time to
[47:04] thank God when you can't do it anymore
[47:07] praise him when you can't figure it out
[47:10] anymore praise him when you don't have
[47:12] the strength to get past it praise him
[47:15] why are you praising
[47:18] himh in my weakness his strength is made
[47:23] perfect not you know what Lord I I bench
[47:26] 300 pounds you know I can I can really
[47:28] move anything
[47:32] I that's not the kind of strength God's
[47:34] looking for yes he don't need your
[47:38] help he he doesn't need your
[47:41] opinion uhhuh he doesn't need what you
[47:44] think all he needs is a son that'll say
[47:49] Lord you
[47:51] said now I may not understand how I may
[47:55] not understand why
[47:57] but you said and if you said
[48:02] it we we are Abraham's Royal
[48:05] seed we have that same silly faith that
[48:09] Abraham
[48:11] had that patient
[48:15] Faith years and years and years and
[48:18] years and years and years and years and
[48:19] years can go by you could be asking for
[48:22] the same thing and it may seem like it's
[48:24] never coming
[48:27] but my
[48:30] God you don't see what's working on the
[48:32] spiritual side you only see what's
[48:34] happening on this side but if for one
[48:37] moment the Lord could give us a glimpse
[48:39] of what's happening on that side of
[48:42] things did he not say there's more with
[48:44] you than there are with them did he not
[48:46] say greater is he that is in you than he
[48:48] that is in the world if Christ has said
[48:50] it then where's your faith yes amen he
[48:53] spoke it believe it whatever doubts in
[48:56] your way get it
[48:57] out it doesn't belong you were made a
[49:01] son amen not a
[49:05] stepson you are a direct son because you
[49:09] were in his mind in the beginning you
[49:12] couldn't be a son unless you were here
[49:14] with him in the
[49:16] beginning
[49:18] Hallelujah brother Brandon would say in
[49:20] the door to a
[49:21] heart I want to open my heart my door of
[49:25] faith I want you to come in and take
[49:27] possession I want you to open my eyes oh
[49:30] Lord I have said in the meetings I've
[49:33] heard brother brandom and many of
[49:34] ministers talk about you being the same
[49:36] yesterday today and forever and I've
[49:39] tried hard to believe that I've really
[49:42] seen your power come and unfold the
[49:43] secrets of the heart I've seen you speak
[49:46] through your servant to absolutely
[49:47] strange people and would know who they
[49:50] were the sins that they were doing the
[49:53] sickness that was in their bodies and
[49:55] I've seen you healed them from all thy
[49:57] blindness sickness and Sanity and have
[50:00] set them free and
[50:04] somehow I've kept my own little Door of
[50:07] Faith
[50:08] closed God be merciful to me tonight say
[50:12] open the door of my faith would them
[50:16] people raise their hands to God open my
[50:19] door Lord God Bless you that's right God
[50:22] bless you open my door Faith Lord I open
[50:25] it to you
[50:27] come in be Lord be
[50:30] ruler take me as I am I'm no good we've
[50:36] come to the same
[50:37] conclusion you're no good I'm no good
[50:42] we're all no good but
[50:44] he but
[50:47] he in spite of your no
[50:50] goodness he said manew you were a
[50:52] Troublesome one but I want you Dave you
[50:55] were a Troublesome one but I I want
[50:57] you Chris back there crispy Critter I
[51:00] want
[51:02] you CU oh no you don't know the kind of
[51:04] life that I live I was so terrible you
[51:07] know I I I just all the iniquities and
[51:09] stuff that I I did you don't understand
[51:12] I'm just God can't do nothing with me
[51:14] praise God that's the kind of man God
[51:17] can use when you realize you can't do
[51:23] anything think of Moses
[51:27] come on put yourself in
[51:30] issue you've been placed in Egypt you've
[51:33] risen now you're a general in the
[51:35] greatest army that ever
[51:37] lived science would say or
[51:41] history you have the power the the
[51:45] ability the
[51:47] strategy that when you're told you're
[51:49] the
[51:50] deliverer wait you've probably heard
[51:53] brother brandom say this the children of
[51:56] Israel outnumbered the
[51:59] Egyptians they accepted the oppression
[52:01] that they were in and therefore it made
[52:04] them
[52:05] weak the only Power the devil has is
[52:09] your belief in
[52:12] him if you don't believe
[52:15] him he can't give you
[52:18] anything part of it is you accepting
[52:22] it oh you go to the doctor and say oh
[52:24] brother you've got this disease well I
[52:27] guess I got it you received it that's
[52:30] right that's true I I I want that
[52:33] different kind of faith I want that one
[52:36] when the circumstances seem
[52:41] impossible like my head's going to be
[52:43] chopped off that kind of faith if God
[52:47] you don't do nothing it's the end of me
[52:51] and to be able to stand boldly and say
[52:54] Lord regardless of this situ
[52:57] father I
[52:59] know I know you will deliver
[53:02] me here Moses is is is raised there he
[53:06] has all this idea he has all
[53:08] these he has everything at his disposal
[53:11] he could infiltrate from within he was
[53:14] one of the highest ranking members in
[53:16] the Egypt in Egypt yet God didn't use
[53:21] any of
[53:24] that he tried it his way
[53:27] No Moses it's still
[53:30] you I don't need you I need me in
[53:35] you he waited till he got
[53:39] old
[53:42] right where he couldn't do nothing for
[53:44] himself gave him a
[53:46] stick that's an old
[53:49] person now he said okay
[53:52] Moses go deliver my
[53:55] people you couldn't have done this like
[53:57] 30 40 years ago like when I had all the
[53:58] youth and strength and the power I could
[54:01] move mountains back then now I'm I'm old
[54:03] I'm big and my my shoulders are kind of
[54:08] stooped why would you use me now there's
[54:11] no miracle there's no mystery in the
[54:16] ability of you to come up with an answer
[54:19] but there is a miracle and a
[54:22] power when a son sees
[54:26] Hallelujah when brother Brenham is
[54:29] describing gifts and and and so forth in
[54:31] the church he he puts forth the scenario
[54:34] he says imagine you the PE the people
[54:37] with gifts come together they come with
[54:39] a a word from the Lord and the word says
[54:41] a brother will come forth in the aisle
[54:43] he'll be dressed like this and he'll be
[54:44] prayed for and when you see that you'll
[54:46] know that I am the Lord thy God and and
[54:49] it's written and brother brandom says it
[54:51] before the service begins and then that
[54:53] person comes forth he's drawing an
[54:54] example that person comes forth
[54:56] and now when everybody sees
[55:01] that do you understand the odds of a
[55:04] random person being described how they
[55:07] look what they'll be dressed in what
[55:09] they'll do their action everything to
[55:11] the tea not missing when you see that
[55:14] what it does in you the believer it
[55:16] raises your faith and all that Faith
[55:20] raising is for is for you to then take
[55:22] the word and say Lord if you can do it
[55:24] then Lord you can come in my
[55:26] circumstance and you can have your way
[55:28] in my situation we're talking about the
[55:31] unclogging of
[55:33] pipes God made you an all powerful being
[55:38] amen amen see Satan wanted to exalt
[55:43] himself above you he said above the
[55:47] Stars the prophet would say the stars
[55:49] are the sons of
[55:51] God here you are the devil wanted to
[55:55] raise himself a little bit higher than
[55:57] you but for you God said you know I'm
[56:00] not offended if my son has my power I'm
[56:04] not offended if my son has my authority
[56:07] I'm not offended that when my son speaks
[56:09] is as good as me speaking I'm not
[56:11] offended by that we need to start
[56:14] operating in that realm get out of this
[56:18] realm for a moment and let God do
[56:21] something for you in the Supernatural
[56:24] realm brother Brandon would say in the
[56:26] sermon the fundamental foundations of
[56:29] Faith paragraph
[56:30] 19 now what are we anyhow how did we get
[56:34] here did you ever think of those things
[56:36] along those lines we are human beings
[56:40] what made us human human beings what
[56:43] made us different from anything else on
[56:45] the earth brother clears his throat
[56:47] pardon me as human beings no matter what
[56:50] a state a man is in he's yet a Son of
[56:53] God no matter how sinful he is how far
[56:57] away he is he's a fallen son but yet
[57:00] he's a son God is his Creator God is his
[57:04] maker God has bought him with a price he
[57:07] may never reconcile himself to that he
[57:10] may never accept it it may never do him
[57:13] any good but yet he is a son and she is
[57:18] a daughter and what did God put man here
[57:22] for now we could spend much time on
[57:25] these thoughts but we won't we just give
[57:27] a basic thought here for the night then
[57:28] we'll go to praying for the sake because
[57:29] perhaps ministers has already spoke and
[57:32] so forth now God when he made man in the
[57:35] beginning I want us to really focus on
[57:38] this he made him Superior to anything on
[57:43] Earth he gave him the jurisdiction of
[57:47] everything on Earth to control
[57:50] everything he controlled animal life he
[57:53] controlled the foul life the fishes of
[57:54] the sea he controlled the winds he
[57:57] controlled the plant life he controlled
[58:00] everything jump down to
[58:03] 35 when they could get rid of sin this
[58:07] this is in uh the sermon Dr
[58:12] Moses preached in
[58:14] 55414 he preaches this after he the next
[58:18] day after he preaches the the
[58:20] fundamental foundations for
[58:22] Faith
[58:24] and remember God God made you all
[58:27] powerful he made you to have dominion
[58:30] over everything to have jurisdiction
[58:32] over everything a master of circumstance
[58:36] keep those in your mind we're speaking
[58:38] of things that clog the
[58:39] pipe brother Brandon would say when they
[58:42] could get rid of sin paragraph 35 you've
[58:44] got to get healing oh my that makes the
[58:47] Methodist feel good doesn't it yes sir
[58:48] look get rid of the cause and you get
[58:50] the Cure already drawing interest and if
[58:53] God In His Infinite mind for knowing
[58:56] that hundreds of years later that Jesus
[58:58] would die on a cross and made sin for us
[59:02] be crucified and let Israel be healed by
[59:05] the phenomenal before Christ was
[59:07] crucified how much more will he after
[59:10] Christ is crucified if that was the type
[59:14] how much more by the antitype how much
[59:17] greater program have we today than what
[59:20] Moses had and yet when Moses come out of
[59:22] the Wilderness there wasn't a feeble one
[59:25] among them
[59:26] 40 years Dr Moses I imagine if there's
[59:30] doctor here tonight you'd like to have
[59:32] some of his prescription how many would
[59:34] like to have his
[59:36] prescription Hallelujah LED 2 million
[59:39] people how many babies is bornn every
[59:42] night in two million people how many old
[59:44] people how many cripples how much
[59:46] sickness among them and Dr Moses took
[59:49] care of every one of
[59:52] them and brought them through without
[59:55] one f feeble one among
[59:58] them why doctor you can't even do a
[1:00:01] family that well think of it why Dr
[1:00:05] Moses had
[1:00:07] prescription would you like to see what
[1:00:10] he had for a prescription I'll show you
[1:00:13] let's look into a briefcase I am the
[1:00:15] Lord that Health thee that's all the
[1:00:18] prescription he needed I am the Lord
[1:00:21] that Health thee put that in the brief
[1:00:23] briefcase doctor I tell you your

[1:01:11] he said so
[1:01:13] amen there's a simple formula here when
[1:01:16] God says something you put your peanut
[1:01:20] brain aside and you say Lord I'm taking
[1:01:22] you at your word because you said it I
[1:01:25] believe it yes Father I don't have to

[1:02:27] really free then you wouldn't have done
[1:02:31] that well if you were really free then
[1:02:34] you wouldn't have said that well if you
[1:02:36] were really free you wouldn't have had
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:39] attitude Freedom wasn't based on
[1:02:43] you the scripture says if the son
[1:02:47] therefore shall make you make it
[1:02:50] personal if the son therefore shall make
[1:02:53] me bino free I'm
[1:02:56] free let the devil Bluff let him say
[1:03:00] what he will he's made me free well if

[1:06:24] washed over two million people is
[1:06:26] watching over
[1:06:28] you he watched over that
[1:06:30] Prophet with all the things that went
[1:06:32] through in his life all the battles he
[1:06:34] had to face the circumstances the
[1:06:36] struggles the fights this message came
[1:06:38] at a cost and don't think living by it
[1:06:41] ain't coming at a cost it'll cost you
[1:06:45] something it'll cost you something but I
[1:06:48] have an assurance whatever it cost you
[1:06:51] in my father's house for many
[1:06:53] mansions it's worth the price
[1:06:58] it'll cost your
[1:07:00] life it'll cost your
[1:07:03] Ambitions it'll cost your
[1:07:05] goals that's right your
[1:07:08] perceptions your own
[1:07:10] ideas your way of living it'll cost you
[1:07:14] everything the closer you draw to the
[1:07:17] Lord the more the
[1:07:20] cost oh i' I've just started in this
[1:07:23] little small spot I've I've been
[1:07:24] baptized and and so forth and whatnot
[1:07:26] and then here that Devil comes and says
[1:07:28] well you know brother brandom said
[1:07:30] baptism don't save you it don't do
[1:07:32] nothing for you it's the beginning of
[1:07:35] something it may not be the thing that
[1:07:38] saves you but it starts the process
[1:07:41] because a son fulfills the word so as
[1:07:43] long as I know I'm walking in the word I
[1:07:45] will I will obtain that end
[1:07:53] goal brother brandom says in the
[1:08:01] sermon fundamentals of
[1:08:05] Faith paragraph 26 he says now through
[1:08:09] the fall he lost that
[1:08:12] power then he become unconscious of the
[1:08:15] fact after losing his relationship and
[1:08:19] friendship fellowship with the father
[1:08:22] then he lost that and all of his great
[1:08:25] channels become clogged up and he
[1:08:28] couldn't get through now what Adam was
[1:08:32] in God Christ has redeemed us back to
[1:08:36] that now a redeemer to redeem anything
[1:08:40] is to bring it back to its origin again
[1:08:44] and Adam never had to be sick he never
[1:08:48] had to die he never had a worry he never
[1:08:52] had a heartache he never had fear
[1:08:56] he just climbed up in the arms of the
[1:08:58] father and just like a child everything
[1:09:00] was his and whatever he asked why he
[1:09:04] just got it everything obeyed him
[1:09:08] because he was God's child and the child
[1:09:11] is heir of all
[1:09:13] things paragraph 29 now when man fell he
[1:09:18] lost this now what he lost in the fall
[1:09:22] Christ as a redeemer did you ever stop
[1:09:24] to think what Christ redeemed us
[1:09:27] for he gave us everlasting life he
[1:09:32] brought us back to that Eternal
[1:09:34] fellowship and relationship to God to be
[1:09:38] his sons and daughters again to restore
[1:09:41] back all that Adam lost in the
[1:09:45] fall now the thing of it is since he's
[1:09:48] restored man back to this place man in
[1:09:51] the fall this is you and I has lost his
[1:09:54] conscience of what the father put him
[1:09:57] here on Earth to do in other words all
[1:10:01] of the plumbing as it was in our brain
[1:10:05] and the outlets of Faith have been
[1:10:07] clogged up with business Affair home
[1:10:10] life domestic things it's all become so
[1:10:13] clogged up with that until God can't
[1:10:16] operate through those channels that he
[1:10:18] made a man for you see why it's
[1:10:22] important to unclog the things that are
[1:10:25] standing in the
[1:10:27] way we always speak about how we as sons
[1:10:31] and daughters are living beneath our
[1:10:33] means we talk about the great things
[1:10:36] that our Prophet did he spoke squirrels
[1:10:40] appeared he spoke to the storm it went
[1:10:42] back and we Marvel oh my what an amazing
[1:10:48] feat wow if only I was a prophet I could
[1:10:51] do the same
[1:10:53] thing who lied to you
[1:10:58] who lied to
[1:11:01] us to let us think that those things
[1:11:03] that we saw were only given to that
[1:11:07] office did we not just read where he
[1:11:11] said you have been given the authority
[1:11:15] Adam
[1:11:16] had you can speak to the
[1:11:19] storm it'll
[1:11:22] move you can speak to a bull
[1:11:26] amen you can pray for a
[1:11:29] pum amen you can speak a fish back to
[1:11:33] life you can do all those things see our
[1:11:37] problem is we Marvel at all the things
[1:11:40] that he did and fail to see how much
[1:11:43] stuff had to be unclogged from his life
[1:11:46] in order for that to be
[1:11:48] produced you
[1:11:51] understand it came at a cost
[1:11:56] the Lord sent him to go preach
[1:11:59] somewhere he listened to his
[1:12:02] mother-in-law and it cost him a
[1:12:07] lot but if God wants you to be a son and
[1:12:11] he wants you to know the
[1:12:12] authority my brothers and sisters he
[1:12:15] will take whatever is
[1:12:17] necessary to get you to that point that
[1:12:21] you completely submit everything to him
[1:12:24] the Lord told them don't go to
[1:12:27] Africa he didn't listen he went and he
[1:12:31] got into
[1:12:33] meeba he had to learn
[1:12:36] obedience he had to learn to unclog
[1:12:39] himself there was too much as he would
[1:12:41] say William bram's biggest enemy is
[1:12:43] William
[1:12:45] brandham he had to learn to get himself
[1:12:47] out the way to stop thinking
[1:12:51] small Lord you know I I really need for
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:57] know I want this sickness that I've been
[1:12:59] fighting for four or five years to be
[1:13:01] healed
[1:13:03] but rather than heal that just my finger
[1:13:06] hurts can you heal
[1:13:09] that no maybe that's too much maybe
[1:13:11] that's too much maybe that's too much I
[1:13:13] have this one gray hair up here could
[1:13:15] you just remove that from
[1:13:18] me why not ask for the big things do we
[1:13:22] not serve a big God do we not serve
[1:13:25] serve a powerful God what has clogged
[1:13:28] your faith the channels of your faith to
[1:13:31] make you think that as a son you can
[1:13:35] only ask for crumbs on the
[1:13:38] table you have right to everything on
[1:13:41] the table amen the table's been laid and
[1:13:45] dressed for
[1:13:50] you don't be your own
[1:13:53] problem though as as long as you're in
[1:13:55] this flesh you'll have to war against
[1:13:58] yourself but anytime the devil Bluffs
[1:14:01] and just stands himself up sit him back
[1:14:06] down the Lord play his
[1:14:09] position if you didn't know is under
[1:14:12] your
[1:14:14] feet we've settled that he belongs under
[1:14:18] your
[1:14:18] feet so if he's under your feet what's
[1:14:22] stopping you from the feet up
[1:14:25] right if you stomp on him every single
[1:14:29] day how do you stomp on him I pray and
[1:14:32] read my Bible every day I feed on the
[1:14:35] tapes I get one with a word because
[1:14:38] that's when I'll become the word the
[1:14:40] more I feed the more I become till
[1:14:43] eventually you become a son with full
[1:14:47] Authority and you've got nothing
[1:14:49] clogging your channels how do you expect
[1:14:52] how do
[1:14:53] we the Lord was was dealing with me Ben
[1:14:56] how do you expect to see a
[1:14:58] Rapture your faith is
[1:15:01] clogged you can barely have faith for
[1:15:03] your basic needs how are you going to
[1:15:06] have faith for
[1:15:09] Rapture you mean my body will be changed
[1:15:11] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:15:13] you mean if I have a short limb that
[1:15:16] limb will grow back cuz there's no
[1:15:17] imperfection in
[1:15:19] glory these are the kind of things the
[1:15:22] faith God wanted you as a son to have is
[1:15:25] supposed to produce
[1:15:27] yes we need to get the distractions out
[1:15:31] they don't benefit you they don't help
[1:15:34] us they hinder
[1:15:40] you says in fundamental of Faith
[1:15:43] paragraph
[1:15:44] 32 if God designed man's body he
[1:15:49] certainly designed the body of his son
[1:15:51] the church and he has designed designed
[1:15:54] us to come together in Heavenly places
[1:15:57] in Christ Jesus and have these
[1:16:00] Supernatural workings of God Outlets
[1:16:03] through Gifts of spirit such as prophecy
[1:16:05] and wisdom and knowledge and Gifts of
[1:16:07] healing and all these other different
[1:16:10] gifts its Outlets that God lets out his
[1:16:14] power and lets out his Revelation to the
[1:16:17] people not as an individual so much but
[1:16:20] as a unit we're all together one great
[1:16:23] body of believers how do we get into
[1:16:26] this body this Mystic body of the Lord
[1:16:28] Jesus by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:16:31] into this body now Satan by the laws of
[1:16:34] sin and death makes everything that sin
[1:16:38] and death bought
[1:16:42] operate and sends a cancer now no notice
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:47] order Satan sends a cancer whatever it
[1:16:50] is you're battling you place it
[1:16:52] there the man recognized
[1:16:56] it and receives
[1:16:59] it Satan sends heartaches we recognize
[1:17:03] it and receive
[1:17:05] it and if Satan by his power can make
[1:17:10] his laws work in man how much more ought
[1:17:14] god with his power make his laws work in
[1:17:18] man if Satan can make his laws be sure
[1:17:22] and US recognize it how much more ought
[1:17:26] God through the children to make his
[1:17:29] laws be recognized among his people of
[1:17:32] Divine Healing Revelation power of gifts
[1:17:35] manifestations of the Spirit the law of
[1:17:37] sin and death Works in
[1:17:39] people and the law of Liberty of Christ
[1:17:43] has come into us to set us free from
[1:17:47] those
[1:17:48] things come on friends so I believe this
[1:17:52] with all my hearten
[1:17:56] now I believe this all my heart I
[1:17:59] believe that we're nearing the age that
[1:18:03] when people are going to recognize these
[1:18:06] things that we had so much vain
[1:18:09] philosophy and so forth and teachings
[1:18:12] that ought not to be until it has set
[1:18:15] the human mind to a revolution of
[1:18:18] thinking on matters of this and
[1:18:22] that what you need is to revolt yes
[1:18:26] against that old thinking you need to
[1:18:29] revolt against that old man God made you
[1:18:33] more than that he called you to be more
[1:18:36] than
[1:18:38] that oh
[1:18:41] Hallelujah we are those people that are
[1:18:46] recognizing how do you recognize he said
[1:18:49] the Satan sends a cancer the man
[1:18:53] recognizes it and receives it now think
[1:18:57] about this God sends a messenger all
[1:19:00] right the people recognize it and they
[1:19:04] receive
[1:19:06] it you can't receive something you don't
[1:19:08] listen
[1:19:09] to on you can't recognize something you
[1:19:12] don't spend time with that's right did
[1:19:14] he not say that the this bride had to be
[1:19:18] able to see the two Spirits within the
[1:19:20] framework of the church discern it
[1:19:23] withand
[1:19:27] come on
[1:19:28] Friends the Lord's trying to take us
[1:19:31] somewhere we got to
[1:19:33] unclog whatever it is you need he's here
[1:19:38] tonight he'll unclog it he'll remove it
[1:19:42] if it's you that's in the way he'll do
[1:19:45] whatever he needs to we've got example
[1:19:48] after example after example of God
[1:19:50] setting the man out of the way so that
[1:19:53] he might be able to use them Lord if I
[1:19:56] am in your
[1:19:58] way get rid of
[1:20:00] me let it be you that they see Let It Be
[1:20:04] you that speaks they've had enough of
[1:20:06] been that's right I want to so transmit
[1:20:10] the light of God that you don't see me
[1:20:14] but you see
[1:20:16] him that's the intention God had
[1:20:24] Bram says in paragraph
[1:20:26] 39 now if we could throw oursel
[1:20:29] completely to God and to his will and be
[1:20:33] lost to our own thoughts and just let
[1:20:37] the mind of Christ be in US them same
[1:20:41] operations of the spirit would work
[1:20:43] through us just as the natural thing
[1:20:46] does just the same thing but we were
[1:20:49] first created for that purpose to
[1:20:53] control
[1:20:55] see the devil wants to pervert that and
[1:20:58] tell you that this is what you were made
[1:21:00] for this is what you were supposed to be
[1:21:03] you were supposed to always struggle you
[1:21:06] were supposed to always battle diseases
[1:21:08] battle sickness battle
[1:21:11] trials the devil wants you to attribute
[1:21:14] this life that has a Time clock on it an
[1:21:17] expiration date and he wants you to
[1:21:20] identify yourself with it well the
[1:21:22] moment you identify yourself with it now
[1:21:25] you have an expiration date but you've
[1:21:28] been made an eternal being you dropped
[1:21:31] in this little hickey of time you're
[1:21:33] here but you're not of this world so you
[1:21:36] can't operate according to the things of
[1:21:38] this world see when Adam was there in
[1:21:40] the beginning he operated on that true
[1:21:43] six sense he was so engulfed in it his
[1:21:47] five senses were useless the devil could
[1:21:50] not he couldn't touch him because he was
[1:21:53] 100%
[1:21:56] Faith but when he
[1:21:59] fell now he started to rely on
[1:22:02] himself I I've got to dress myself i'
[1:22:05] I've got to hide myself I've man I've
[1:22:07] done wrong I've done wrong I I've and
[1:22:10] the Lord comes Adam Adam Where Art
[1:22:15] Thou come on Friends what about
[1:22:20] us what about us are we dressing
[1:22:23] ourselves what we think is a Christian
[1:22:25] Life when in fact it's just
[1:22:28] religion are we dressing oursel as sons
[1:22:31] of
[1:22:34] God if you're a son act like
[1:22:38] it talk like it walk like it be about
[1:22:44] it that's
[1:22:47] right Jesus
[1:22:49] said the scripture says but we first
[1:22:52] created for that purpose to control to
[1:22:54] rule and to praise God and to live for
[1:22:58] God now Jesus said if this is the
[1:23:01] formula if ye abide in me and my words
[1:23:05] abide in you you can ask what you will
[1:23:08] and it shall be given unto you if ye
[1:23:12] abide in me and my words abide in
[1:23:17] you paragraph 43 it says
[1:23:33] before I get there there's there's
[1:23:35] something that just came into my
[1:23:38] head brother brandom says in the
[1:23:42] sermon trying to find
[1:23:53] it paragraph
[1:23:55] 37
[1:23:57] of Dr Moses
[1:24:04] 55114 could you pull that up for me I
[1:24:06] don't see it here in my
[1:24:14] notes this brother bandam says and if he
[1:24:18] did that under that Covenant how much
[1:24:21] greater is that Covenant today if he did
[1:24:25] that under that type what will he do
[1:24:27] Under the anti type you know what I
[1:24:29] begin to believe Christians friends that
[1:24:31] we're just living in the beginning of
[1:24:33] the greatest time the world has ever
[1:24:36] witnessed I just believe that all the
[1:24:39] lines are getting unclogged you know
[1:24:42] clogged up with all kinds of doctrines
[1:24:44] theologies and kinds of stuff unbelief I
[1:24:48] want us to focus on this part it's it's
[1:24:50] been handed down from generation to
[1:24:53] generation
[1:24:54] oh there's no such a thing as healing
[1:24:57] the days of Miracles has passed we just
[1:24:59] automatically believe that you see the
[1:25:02] power of generational things that are
[1:25:04] passed on they have such a power and
[1:25:07] effect over you that when it's spoken
[1:25:09] you just believe
[1:25:11] it if you grew up in a
[1:25:14] home where what the prophet said was
[1:25:17] always
[1:25:19] questioned what he said was always
[1:25:22] doubted was always explained
[1:25:26] be real careful you can pass that
[1:25:29] trait down to your kid and he then when
[1:25:33] he grows sees the word and says mom
[1:25:37] always question that one dad didn't
[1:25:39] quite believe that one if we're not
[1:25:42] careful we start attaching ourselves to
[1:25:45] things we ought not to be attaching
[1:25:47] ourselves with but thank God for the
[1:25:50] holy ghost that whatever generational
[1:25:52] curse is running in your family when you
[1:25:54] receive the Holy Ghost it kills that
[1:25:56] line in that moment it says you're not
[1:25:58] continuing
[1:26:00] anymore that's right we got to be real
[1:26:03] careful with the things we pass on be
[1:26:06] real careful with the things we let hold
[1:26:08] and bind
[1:26:10] us break free from those generational
[1:26:13] things who's going to be the Son and the
[1:26:15] daughter to say I'm standing against
[1:26:17] that Spirit of doubt in my family I'm
[1:26:20] standing against that anxiety Spirit I'm
[1:26:22] standing against the suicidal Spirit the
[1:26:24] cancer Spirit oh the doctor says it runs
[1:26:26] in my family it's been on for years and
[1:26:28] years and years so what now
[1:26:30] what now so it runs okay what are you
[1:26:33] going to do about it now it is written
[1:26:36] yeah amen that's right break past the
[1:26:39] generational
[1:26:42] curses God's trying to show you
[1:26:46] something brother Bram says back in the
[1:26:49] fun the fundamental foundations for
[1:26:50] Faith paragraph 43 so everything that
[1:26:53] God has spoken his word received into
[1:26:56] the right
[1:26:58] channel will materialize that word for
[1:27:02] whatever the promise it is God will do
[1:27:05] it he's obligated to
[1:27:09] it then if ye abide in me and my word
[1:27:13] abide in you then ye have God the word
[1:27:17] in you and you believe the word just as
[1:27:20] you believe God because it is God and
[1:27:24] it's Inseparable then if you have God's
[1:27:27] word in you you have God's life in you
[1:27:32] you have God in you and whatever God's
[1:27:35] word speaks forth out of you it'll have
[1:27:39] to come to pass just like it was spoke
[1:27:42] from God Jesus said whatever you ask in
[1:27:46] the father in my name that will I do do
[1:27:48] you realize what that means you realize
[1:27:51] if we go before God in the name of Jesus
[1:27:54] it's just the same as Jesus himself
[1:27:57] praying it isn't me praying
[1:28:00] anymore if I come in his name and he
[1:28:03] recognizes his name and Jesus said
[1:28:06] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:28:08] that I do and then I go to the father in
[1:28:12] Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore
[1:28:15] it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying
[1:28:17] through me oh Hallelujah that makes me
[1:28:20] excited so you know what that does it
[1:28:23] eliminates your condition
[1:28:26] because when a son gets down to
[1:28:28] pray God don't see you he sees
[1:28:33] him oh Lord I I'm I'm I'm I'm the worst
[1:28:37] of them
[1:28:38] all
[1:28:40] hallelujah hallelujah amen he sees a son
[1:28:43] in need amen he sees a a son Desiring
[1:28:47] something and the littlest desire to
[1:28:49] serve God is greater than any desire the
[1:28:52] devil can put on his son or daughter of
[1:28:54] God his desire has got no effect on you
[1:28:57] but you keep your eyes stayed on him and
[1:28:59] you trust that no matter the
[1:29:01] circumstance no matter what you've done
[1:29:03] unclog the Avenues of Faith get free a
[1:29:06] little while let that turn that water
[1:29:09] pressure all the way up let that water
[1:29:11] just gush right through clean up that
[1:29:14] entire
[1:29:15] system just for a moment let loose and
[1:29:18] let God have his way oh when that kind
[1:29:21] of a son recognizes who he is and he
[1:29:24] says I've got the Waters of everlasting
[1:29:26] life flowing through me he can do
[1:29:32] anything he can do anything he's not
[1:29:38] hindered
[1:29:41] Hallelujah let it flow through me
[1:29:44] Lord but says and then I've got to
[1:29:47] receive what I ask for because he said
[1:29:49] it and it's God's Own word it can't do
[1:29:53] nothing else
[1:29:54] but produce just what it
[1:29:57] said oh my
[1:30:01] goodness that settles me amen he'll have
[1:30:05] to produce what he said through
[1:30:08] me if he's got to drag me Lord I'm ready
[1:30:12] to be
[1:30:14] dragged whatever he's got to do that
[1:30:18] word will not return void that's
[1:30:20] right he spoke it he's Duty bound to
[1:30:23] watch over that word because that word
[1:30:25] is
[1:30:26] him if that word doesn't come to pass
[1:30:29] then you're saying that God doesn't keep
[1:30:31] his
[1:30:33] word but God said I am the Lord and I
[1:30:35] change it
[1:30:37] not he's the same yesterday today and
[1:30:40] forever if he did it then he'll do it
[1:30:42] today and he'll continue to do it
[1:30:44] forever
[1:30:45] more right so then we believe that and
[1:30:49] this is the confidence we have in God
[1:30:53] that we get what we ask for for he's God
[1:30:57] and cannot take back his word he's got
[1:31:01] to stay with his word so then if ye
[1:31:04] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:31:07] ask what you will and it'll be given
[1:31:08] unto you isn't that simple Faith created
[1:31:12] we was made for that purpose then
[1:31:15] through the fall why we was taken away
[1:31:18] from it and then in Redemption we was
[1:31:21] brought back to it again
[1:31:24] brother says notice this and the only
[1:31:26] thing to hinder the human race today
[1:31:30] from being Superior in controlling like
[1:31:33] they did in the beginning is because
[1:31:36] that the power lines of God made in the
[1:31:39] human being has been clogged
[1:31:44] up I need the great
[1:31:46] plumber I need him to
[1:31:48] come sometimes I say this reverently
[1:31:52] sometimes Theology and Church doctrines
[1:31:54] have clogged up your faith line clogged
[1:31:56] up your lines till you have been taught
[1:31:58] that those things can't be and that puts
[1:32:02] a block in the
[1:32:04] way you get somebody crazy enough to ask
[1:32:07] God for the craziest thing you've ever
[1:32:09] heard and then you with like doubting
[1:32:12] Thomas you start
[1:32:14] going God ain't gonna give him that he
[1:32:18] just asked what how much yeah God ain't
[1:32:20] doing
[1:32:22] that did he ask ask you if he was going
[1:32:25] to do it according to what you thought
[1:32:28] on no no no he's asking for too much
[1:32:31] he's asking for too much or God's got
[1:32:32] too
[1:32:33] much that's why he's asking a son
[1:32:37] recognizes whatever I ask my dad for
[1:32:39] he'll give me amen that's
[1:32:42] right whatever I ask my father for who
[1:32:47] has all wealth who has all blessings who
[1:32:51] has all power whatever I ask for as a
[1:32:56] son he'll give it to
[1:33:02] me Lord help me to ask
[1:33:05] more and now if the natural laws of God
[1:33:08] per 53 which is electricity and things
[1:33:11] once handed down in the right capacity
[1:33:14] can do those things how much more could
[1:33:17] the power of the Holy Ghost once passing
[1:33:20] through the human heart by faith what it
[1:33:22] could do now God has not promised us
[1:33:26] electricity only that knowledge shall
[1:33:30] increase but look what the Holy Spirit
[1:33:33] has promised to the Believers today and
[1:33:35] then we look back to see that God put
[1:33:38] electricity here for a certain
[1:33:42] thing and science is moving into the
[1:33:45] field of science and bringing it out but
[1:33:49] we as Christians we have become too
[1:33:52] clogged up we just can't understand what
[1:33:55] we think about the doctor said I can't
[1:33:57] get well as long as you think that then
[1:34:00] you're not thinking God's thoughts
[1:34:02] you're you can't do it if you say well
[1:34:05] I'm going to die the doctor said I was
[1:34:07] going to die all regards to the doctor
[1:34:09] that's the best of his knowledge if he
[1:34:12] said he's going to die humanly speaking
[1:34:14] I would believe the same thing but by
[1:34:16] the word I don't believe it am that's
[1:34:20] right because he promised me whatever I
[1:34:22] ask the father in his name name could be
[1:34:24] granted and I believe that's true now if
[1:34:28] God could just clear that little Channel
[1:34:31] out and run that energy out to that
[1:34:34] place then something is going to happen
[1:34:38] the whole body is set together to
[1:34:41] operate and as Life Begins just as sure
[1:34:45] as it takes every member of the body to
[1:34:48] operate and give me life so does it take
[1:34:52] every member of the body of Christ to
[1:34:54] operate together to give it life you
[1:34:57] know what I mean oh what a service it'll
[1:34:59] be when every single son and daughter of
[1:35:02] God comes to the recognition that
[1:35:04] there's nothing standing in your way for
[1:35:06] what you have need of what kind of a
[1:35:09] service would that be I wonder if he
[1:35:12] wouldn't just Rapture right out of
[1:35:14] here but we get so clogged
[1:35:18] up we get so oppressed we get so
[1:35:22] affected we so things in our life stop
[1:35:25] the Avenues and channels of God from
[1:35:28] producing what he already said it had to
[1:35:33] produce he said it had to be that way
[1:35:37] but we get in the way with what we think
[1:35:39] has to
[1:35:43] be get out of the we and get in
[1:35:48] him if you're in him all things are made
[1:35:52] possible to them that are in Christ
[1:36:00] Jesus paragraph
[1:36:02] 59 now I believe that a lot of times in
[1:36:04] the wiring up of God's spiritual body on
[1:36:07] Earth we let some plumbers in I say that
[1:36:10] reverently instead of electrician but
[1:36:13] it's the plumbing is all right but we
[1:36:16] can't save them by water you know that's
[1:36:19] right and that's a big thing for a
[1:36:22] Baptist to say but that's true that's
[1:36:25] true as if the body is correctly wired
[1:36:29] up and the Father in Heaven Hallelujah
[1:36:32] turns the big master switch on something
[1:36:35] is going to rise up that's right that's
[1:36:38] if the body is if the building is
[1:36:42] properly wired see here you have God the
[1:36:46] great
[1:36:47] electrician the master
[1:36:50] plumber you're waiting for the wiring to
[1:36:53] be just
[1:36:54] right was it not said that it's been
[1:36:56] given to her to Adorn herself andine
[1:36:59] linen which is righteousness when you
[1:37:01] get adorned with the right thing and you
[1:37:04] get properly wired and you've got your
[1:37:07] Avenues of Faith completely cleaned and
[1:37:10] the master turns on that switch
[1:37:13] something has to rise up out of you
[1:37:16] because there's nothing stopping it
[1:37:19] you'll sit in a powerful service you'll
[1:37:22] people jump jumping here jumping there
[1:37:24] and so forth and the word coming forth
[1:37:26] and it's a beautiful wonderful
[1:37:28] time and you're there in the midst of
[1:37:31] everything and you're so clogged
[1:37:34] up that you look and you start saying
[1:37:37] why is he
[1:37:40] jumping why is he
[1:37:42] shouting why is he
[1:37:45] praising why is he acting the way he's
[1:37:48] acting rather than focusing on what God
[1:37:51] had in store for you and what God was
[1:37:54] trying to speak to you you are so wound
[1:37:57] up in your own channel of how God's
[1:38:00] supposed to come of how God supposed to
[1:38:02] do things that you don't give the spirit
[1:38:05] enough
[1:38:06] room I heard a prophet say that God will
[1:38:09] do whatever it takes to get his son to
[1:38:12] believe
[1:38:14] yes so if you think it needs to be this
[1:38:18] I serve a God that says that's my son
[1:38:21] that's what he wants I'm come in that
[1:38:25] way and he receives the Revelation that
[1:38:29] goes beyond deeper than just the shout
[1:38:33] deeper than just
[1:38:35] jumping deeper than just this and that
[1:38:39] when you receive that Revelation it's a
[1:38:43] reality nothing can move you yes amen
[1:38:47] unclog the channel and let God put in
[1:38:51] your life what he has need of for the
[1:38:54] purpose in which he put you on Earth
[1:38:57] for it's not I hate the question I
[1:39:01] always get ask this question what do you
[1:39:03] want to do when you grow
[1:39:07] up if you personally I'd rather the
[1:39:11] Rapture be tomorrow or right now than
[1:39:14] figure out what I'mma
[1:39:17] do this world you're constantly chasing
[1:39:20] something that's true you're constantly
[1:39:22] running by behind something you got all
[1:39:25] the money in the world more problems
[1:39:27] going to come things going to cost a
[1:39:29] whole lot more oh but he's got millions
[1:39:31] in the bank yeah but you got hundreds of
[1:39:33] thousand worth of
[1:39:36] expenses just cuz you get more don't
[1:39:39] make the life
[1:39:40] easier you got to be smart with that
[1:39:43] which you
[1:39:44] have in the little amount that it is and
[1:39:47] if the Lord blesses it keep the same
[1:39:50] mindset oh but that's in the financial
[1:39:52] realm okay
[1:39:53] spiritually if all God gave you was the
[1:39:56] ability to get on your knees and
[1:39:58] pray you do that to the best of your
[1:40:00] ability amen if there's anybody that
[1:40:03] gets on their knees and pray Let It Be
[1:40:05] You Yes say there need somebody get on
[1:40:07] their knees Lord I'm here let me be one
[1:40:11] that gets on my knees and pray if all
[1:40:14] you can do is raise your little hand
[1:40:15] just a little bit for a sign of Faith
[1:40:19] you do that to the best of your ability
[1:40:21] you
[1:40:22] watch you stay faithful with the little
[1:40:24] bit he's got you one of these
[1:40:28] days it may not be the way you expected
[1:40:30] it it may not be the way you thought it
[1:40:33] but he expands that which he gave you
[1:40:36] and you start realizing wait a minute
[1:40:38] though I have little if I got him I got
[1:40:43] everything that's the key if I've got
[1:40:47] him it don't matter what I see in my
[1:40:49] pocket it don't matter what I see around
[1:40:52] me I've got him he works The Impossible
[1:40:55] he moves mountains anything I have need
[1:40:58] of he has the power to make it come to
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:06] pass he
[1:41:09] says now if
[1:41:13] theology no he says if the building is
[1:41:16] properly wired back up in 60 a little
[1:41:18] bit if it's properly taught
[1:41:23] there's an importance in
[1:41:25] teaching and every fiber of our body
[1:41:29] being Lost In Christ and to his word
[1:41:33] alone now if you got theology if you've
[1:41:37] got some Doctrine if you got some
[1:41:39] Superstition if you got some unbelief
[1:41:42] you got something that stops up
[1:41:44] somewhere then that energy can never
[1:41:47] pull you through but when you get to a
[1:41:50] place where you're perfectly wired and
[1:41:52] the master electrician has oated by
[1:41:55] sealing it with the Holy Ghost the only
[1:41:58] thing is just to turn on that switch
[1:42:01] then and there will be a light show and
[1:42:04] that's right and ye are the light of the
[1:42:06] world a city that is set on a hill that
[1:42:09] cannot be hid and we

[1:42:19] concerns and we tonight ought to be
[1:42:22] ashamed of ourselves and honestly and
[1:42:26] humbly confess our unbelief before God

[1:43:08] representation the word has to be seen
[1:43:11] in you in full Authority
[1:43:16] yes don't settle for anything

[1:44:09] word you've been given thus sayith the
[1:44:11] Lord speak

[1:44:18] bride what's the need speak it he's
[1:44:22] listening yes he's waiting for you to
[1:44:25] confess it yes you need to get past the
[1:44:29] idea that what I'm confessing I don't
[1:44:31] quite understand how it will ever come
[1:44:33] to pass get past that idea you'll never
[1:44:36] truly make a True Confession so long as
[1:44:39] you're still trying to figure out the
[1:44:41] channel in which it'll bring it to pass
[1:44:44] he never asked you to figure out the
[1:44:46] channel that's right amen just confess
[1:44:48] it yes and have unmoving faith that's
[1:44:52] right he's Duty bound to bring it to
[1:44:57] pass you talk about the last minute at
[1:45:00] the last moment God moving on the scene
[1:45:04] the thief at the cross when his life's
[1:45:07] almost at zero it'll be the end of him
[1:45:10] in that
[1:45:12] moment he lived his entire life
[1:45:15] incorrectly it took one moment of
[1:45:17] recognition of who he was in the
[1:45:19] presence of that he knew he could make
[1:45:22] such and
[1:45:24] ask he didn't come by the way of
[1:45:28] baptism and all the different steps he
[1:45:31] didn't come by that way he recognized
[1:45:34] something though yes he asked something
[1:45:37] big of God that's he said Lord we
[1:45:41] deserve this but you you don't deserve
[1:45:45] this remember
[1:45:47] me
[1:45:49] how what about me and you when it gets
[1:45:53] to that end point that last time when
[1:45:55] you think there's no hope no ability for
[1:45:58] it to happen do we recognize who we're
[1:46:01] in the presence of do we recognize who
[1:46:04] our father
[1:46:06] is the power you've been given speak the
[1:46:11] word nothing can stand in your
[1:46:20] way brother says in paragraph
[1:46:30] 66 I might not be able to get past all
[1:46:32] these quotes but try to find a place to
[1:46:36] close what did Christ redeem us
[1:46:39] for did you ever think what he redeemed
[1:46:41] us for why didn't he just make the
[1:46:44] atonement there's no need for giving
[1:46:47] them these Powers there's no need in
[1:46:49] making this man a Son of God there's no
[1:46:52] need of doing that I will just ask him
[1:46:55] to believe it and write his name in the
[1:46:57] book of heaven and that'll settle
[1:47:00] it sometimes I that's how we
[1:47:03] think Lord you honestly you could have
[1:47:06] just took my spirit out put your spirit
[1:47:09] in and just lived and then I had no
[1:47:11] conscience of anything and done it done
[1:47:14] just figured it out I don't want to have
[1:47:16] to do it I don't want to have to but he
[1:47:19] wants you to exercise that power he
[1:47:22] wants you to know you have
[1:47:26] power but he give us these redeemed
[1:47:28] blessings that we might operate the work
[1:47:31] of God by the energy of the holy spirit
[1:47:35] in St John 15 he said I am the vine and
[1:47:38] ye are the branches do you know the vine
[1:47:42] can't bear
[1:47:44] fruit although the fruit is in the vine
[1:47:47] but the fruit cannot be brought forth
[1:47:49] from the vine it has to have the branch
[1:47:52] Branch to Bear the fruit and you are the
[1:47:56] branches now the Vine with all of its
[1:47:59] energy cannot produce
[1:48:02] anything unless the branch is willing to
[1:48:05] receive the
[1:48:08] energy Lord help us now God is depending
[1:48:13] on
[1:48:14] you as a member of his body to bear
[1:48:17] fruit of his spirit and now if he's
[1:48:21] depending on you let's open up our
[1:48:24] channels and let the Holy Spirit come in
[1:48:26] tonight and recognize us and energize us
[1:48:30] and free us from all these fears and
[1:48:33] doubts Revival has
[1:48:40] come brother Brandon would say the Holy
[1:48:42] Spirit paragraph 74 the holy spirit is
[1:48:45] the Healer if the musicians can come the
[1:48:48] holy spirit is here tonight to energize
[1:48:51] every life to do
[1:48:54] everything now we see what the basis of
[1:48:57] Divine Healing we'll have to draw this
[1:49:00] to a close just because time won't let
[1:49:02] us speak much longer we've got to bring
[1:49:04] it to a close
[1:49:06] now there's something that's wrong and
[1:49:09] in the beginning God created you to be
[1:49:12] master of every circumstance and that's
[1:49:15] the origin that's authentic that's God's
[1:49:18] word there was nothing nothing could
[1:49:21] happen unless you was the master of it
[1:49:25] that's what you were created
[1:49:29] for then sin came along through the fall
[1:49:33] and blinded the eyes of it and now Jesus
[1:49:36] come along and redeemed it back and now
[1:49:39] the father gives you the Holy Spirit to
[1:49:42] lead you and guide you giving you all
[1:49:45] these Divine promises
[1:49:48] teachers humbly saying it as I love
[1:49:51] every manner woman that believes the
[1:49:53] name of the Lord Jesus see and I am not
[1:49:56] a de AB deor not to fuss I don't believe
[1:50:00] in that I believe in just preaching the
[1:50:03] word that's all and I believe that this
[1:50:07] is God's word and if this is God's word
[1:50:10] as I believe it to be I believe that
[1:50:13] he's obligated to answer for me every
[1:50:17] promise that's in the book if I meet his
[1:50:21] conditions and he SE heals me into his
[1:50:24] kingdom by the Holy Spirit which I
[1:50:26] believe is not fanaticism though we have
[1:50:29] had a lot of fanaticism with it but yet
[1:50:32] it's not fanaticism it is the truth and
[1:50:35] then God is obligated to his word to
[1:50:39] take care of his word he watches over it
[1:50:43] to perform it amen Church he's watching
[1:50:47] over
[1:50:49] us in order to perform what it is that
[1:50:52] he said that's right we need to unclog
[1:50:56] the pipes in our
[1:50:58] life we need to let Christ just have his
[1:51:02] way in our
[1:51:04] members get past any ideas or thoughts
[1:51:07] that we've had in the past of what it
[1:51:10] meant to live a Christian Life and
[1:51:13] recognize you cannot live a Christian
[1:51:16] Life
[1:51:18] hindered you need to be completely set
[1:51:22] free from anything that hinders you
[1:51:25] brother Bon preach God's word calls for
[1:51:28] total separation from
[1:51:30] unbelief do you know why you have to
[1:51:33] completely separate from unbelief in
[1:51:36] order to receive God's word because
[1:51:38] God's word is a seed that produces life
[1:51:43] and it can't produce the life in you if
[1:51:46] there's unbelief present clean your
[1:51:49] circle maybe your channels that are
[1:51:51] clogged is not something in you maybe
[1:51:54] you're all right maybe all your channels
[1:51:56] were clear but the circle around you is
[1:52:00] not one that God can minister to you
[1:52:02] that God can speak to you and have his
[1:52:04] way with you don't just live a Christian
[1:52:07] Life in church but go out of here and
[1:52:10] live the Christian Life
[1:52:12] unclogged freed from your mind free from
[1:52:16] your
[1:52:17] thinking let's stand
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:31] we we always hear the story
[1:52:34] of the mother Eagle you you can play
[1:52:37] something sister
[1:52:38] Julia of the mother
[1:52:41] eagle and the little Eagle in the
[1:52:43] chicken
[1:52:45] coat and how here he is going throughout
[1:52:51] life thinking he's a
[1:52:54] chicken but something just didn't sit
[1:52:56] right with
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] him he looked at his circumstances says
[1:53:01] man this this isn't
[1:53:04] me this isn't who I
[1:53:07] am I wasn't made to eat
[1:53:11] worms I wasn't made to eat these
[1:53:14] things when I look up in the heavens I
[1:53:17] see someplace where my heart longs to be
[1:53:21] I long to soar I long to
[1:53:25] fly I long to be at one with the
[1:53:28] heavens but I'm
[1:53:32] here yet something inside of me says
[1:53:36] there's something
[1:53:37] more and that was
[1:53:40] us here in this world Bound by the
[1:53:44] things of this world and the
[1:53:45] circumstances of this world but then God
[1:53:48] sent a prophet to Remind You and I
[1:53:53] of what Authority was given to us of
[1:53:56] what right we had as a son to live by
[1:53:59] that we were never meant to be hindered
[1:54:02] we were meant to soar in the
[1:54:05] heavens nothing could stand in our way
[1:54:08] master of our own
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:12] circumstances if you would like to
[1:54:14] receive the
[1:54:17] recognition and
[1:54:19] receive what it is God has given to Us

[1:54:42] Pew and minister to you where you're

[1:56:07] Jesus father I can't make them
[1:56:12] realize who they are what Authority
[1:56:15] they've been
[1:56:16] given but you
[1:56:19] Lord when you give that revelation Lord
[1:56:22] Jesus it becomes a
[1:56:25] reality it tears down any thinking that
[1:56:29] was Prior Revelation changes the
[1:56:32] thinking of the
[1:56:33] mind it's a cellular change it's a

[1:58:06] help but see that I wouldn't
[1:58:07] representing you

[2:03:41] the power of doubt and it's there and
[2:03:44] you're only going to produce doubt
[2:03:47] everything you're going to do well you
[2:03:48] know that's what I thought it's going to
[2:03:50] happen and that's what you know you do
[2:03:52] and it produces negative and you believe
[2:03:53] it and it produces more negative oh but
[2:03:56] if you can look at the positive if you
[2:03:58] can look at Faith tonight and say
[2:04:01] there's a power of Faith that's given to
[2:04:03] a Believer then when things are not
[2:04:05] going the way they're supposed to I have
[2:04:08] the power to change them I'm not stuck I
[2:04:12] have been given the word of God to live
[2:04:15] by oh my if we could just come with our
[2:04:18] Consciousness and say Lord help my
[2:04:20] unbelief I I see these things going the
[2:04:23] way they are going and and your word
[2:04:25] says that if I believe this is what's
[2:04:27] going to happen help my unbelieve
[2:04:29] tonight just come by my way let my faith
[2:04:32] be nzed by the power of faith that you
[2:04:36] can bring into existence your word into
[2:04:40] my
[2:04:41] life and I believe he's here to do that
[2:04:44] we just we just he just our brother just
[2:04:46] preached it and we read it as the
[2:04:48] prophet was saying he's there to
[2:04:51] energize Us by faith and to bring us to
[2:04:55] believe his word and live by the word
[2:04:57] and have the word produce the word in us
[2:05:01] that word coming out of us and producing
[2:05:03] what he promised will
[2:05:05] produce you think about it if the the
[2:05:08] world that we live in Satan can take Man
[2:05:12] by its knowledge and and create the
[2:05:15] science out there that we look and the
[2:05:18] great invention that man has done how
[2:05:20] much more by faith faith God is wanting
[2:05:23] to make his word a reality to us he's
[2:05:26] wanting to call us to say don't look at
[2:05:29] the things of the world don't don't be
[2:05:31] despaired don't look at it and think you
[2:05:33] are stuck by the things you're looking
[2:05:35] at look into the word this is your
[2:05:38] promise this is what you've been called
[2:05:40] to live by this is what you've been
[2:05:42] called to change the circumstances by to
[2:05:45] say sickness at my is at my door I don't
