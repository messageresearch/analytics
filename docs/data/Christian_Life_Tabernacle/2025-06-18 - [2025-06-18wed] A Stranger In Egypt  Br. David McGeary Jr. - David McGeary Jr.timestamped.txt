[31:17] [Music]
[31:41] Amen. Is it all you want today? Amen.
[31:45] Certainly thankful for that. Amen. My
[31:49] phone died and I had some requests on
[31:51] there. I couldn't find it. So, I just I
[31:53] know uh uh brother Jose submitted a
[31:57] testimony. Just wanting to thank
[31:58] everybody for their prayers um for
[32:01] Sister Raquel. We're certainly thankful
[32:03] that the Lord has brought her through
[32:04] and that we pray that she may have a
[32:07] faster recovery. Amen. Amen. and want to
[32:10] continue to remember our pastor that the
[32:12] Lord will bring him. I talked to him
[32:14] today. He was on the way to church. We
[32:16] just want to pray that the Lord will be
[32:18] with him and bring him back safe. I know
[32:20] brother Matthew is out preaching. I I
[32:22] was talking to him. I said I don't know
[32:24] how he does that. I just I don't know. I
[32:26] told him he has he must have callous on
[32:28] his voice, you know, just we certainly
[32:31] thank the Lord for what he does and
[32:33] certainly doing it for the body of
[32:34] Christ and we pray the Lord strengthen
[32:36] him. Like I said, it's good to see
[32:38] brother Andrew, brother um Tommy back
[32:42] and in the house of God. If you have a
[32:44] need upon your heart, why don't you just
[32:46] lift your hand up to him tonight? Man,
[32:48] he's here to answer the needs and the
[32:50] cry of his children. Amen. The Lord's
[32:53] manifestation today is in his body.
[32:56] That's where you'll see him. Amen.
[32:58] Brother Tommy, if you could just come
[32:59] and take this knees before the church,
[33:01] the brothers that are taking the
[33:03] offerings, if you could come at this
[33:04] time.
[33:09] [Music]
[33:16] [Music]
[33:24] You know, I kind of feel like Jose, you
[33:26] know, when you're gone
[33:29] and you come back, it's
[33:34] we don't know how good we have it until
[33:37] you come back. And when you're gone,
[33:40] you're like, man, I wish I was home.
[33:43] But, you know,
[33:46] we had an opportunity to go to another
[33:48] church and very small group, but it just
[33:51] makes us realize how lucky we are.
[33:54] Everybody here loves each other so much
[33:56] and we have such a big group and
[33:58] everybody's cares so much about each
[34:00] other. And you know, when you're out
[34:03] there and you're amongst the world,
[34:07] people don't care about each other. They
[34:09] just don't care. But let's just go
[34:12] before the Lord.
[34:15] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we're so
[34:17] grateful, Lord, to be in your house this
[34:19] evening, Lord. And
[34:22] Lord, we look to you to prepare our
[34:24] hearts, Lord. And Lord, may we receive
[34:27] what you have for us the even this
[34:29] evening, Lord. and may the minister come
[34:32] forth and just deliver the word in a
[34:36] mighty powerful way, Lord. May he put
[34:37] himself aside and allow you to just take
[34:41] over his vessel, Lord. Lord, may you
[34:43] take over each vessel in in this house
[34:46] this evening, Lord. And may we just
[34:48] surrender our hearts to you, Lord, and
[34:50] just give it all to you, Lord.
[34:53] We're we're so grateful, Lord, just to
[34:55] to know you, Lord, and to be able to
[34:59] have the revelation of this message is
[35:01] just so wonderful, Lord.
[35:04] We're such a great and lucky people,
[35:06] Lord.
[35:08] Lord, you've you've blessed us so much,
[35:10] Lord. And there's nothing in this world
[35:14] that's worth this message, Lord. This
[35:17] this message is everything, Lord.
[35:21] Lord, and we're so grateful for that,
[35:23] Lord.
[35:25] Lord, we just look to you to bless the
[35:27] tithes and offerings, Lord. And Lord, we
[35:30] just thank you once again for just the
[35:32] life you've given us, Lord, and for
[35:34] Calvary, Lord.
[35:37] Lord, for those stripes you received for
[35:40] our sister, Lord.
[35:43] Lord, we thank you for her healing,
[35:44] Lord. Lord, we're so grateful,
[35:48] Lord, just to see our sister healed,
[35:51] Lord. And Lord, may you just be with
[35:54] her, Lord, and give her a speedy
[35:56] recovery, Lord. We love you and praise
[35:58] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:00] Christ. Amen.
[36:04] Amen. Sister Joy has a testimony for us.
[36:07] If she could come at this time,
[36:29] rather nervous, but I'll try to keep
[36:31] this concise and as short as I can.
[36:36] And I brought tissues because I don't
[36:38] cry.
[36:42] But about six months ago exactly, um I
[36:44] discovered that I had a cyst in my hand
[36:46] um right where my left ring finger meets
[36:48] my palm.
[36:51] There didn't seem to be much concern at
[36:53] first. It didn't really bother me too
[36:54] much and I could easily forget about it
[36:56] unless I specifically felt for it and I
[36:59] figured it would just easily dissolve
[37:01] and go away on its own. Um as time
[37:04] progressed, it got a bit bigger. it
[37:06] seemed to become u less malleable and
[37:08] harder uh within my hand. Um and when it
[37:11] did that the surrounding nerves and
[37:13] tendons became a bit more sensitive and
[37:16] it would sort of ink when touched or if
[37:18] I moved my thumb across it
[37:21] especially if I also stretched my
[37:22] fingers apart in the right way I could
[37:24] feel it into my uh middle finger there
[37:26] as well.
[37:28] Um and I could feel that strain when I
[37:31] flex my hand certain ways. And of
[37:33] course, as you all know, I played my
[37:34] viola every service. And one of the main
[37:37] things I have to do to play the
[37:38] instrument uh are quick stretches and
[37:40] movements with my left hand. And there
[37:42] would be times uh that there was enough
[37:44] sensitivity that particular night, that
[37:46] particular day uh that'd make it a bit
[37:49] more painful to play. And I never wanted
[37:51] to give that up. And I never wanted to
[37:53] have that prevent me from playing
[37:56] because I felt that this is one of the
[37:58] services that I do for the Lord and one
[38:00] of my favorite ways to enter into the
[38:02] worship of a service.
[38:04] And lately, I've been truly blessed by
[38:06] what our pastor and ministers have been
[38:07] preaching lately, especially about
[38:10] coming into our position, moving forward
[38:12] in faith, and having expectation.
[38:14] And the last few weeks have really been
[38:16] powerful in that. And I've wanted to
[38:18] move towards deeper revelation of that
[38:20] personally. And I just seemed over the
[38:22] past probably month, month and a half
[38:25] that just became more sensitive at the
[38:28] same time. And then brother Billy
[38:30] preached just last uh the Sunday before
[38:32] on expectation by revelation and it just
[38:34] really blessed me. And again, my hand
[38:36] just seemed to kind of be on my mind a
[38:38] bit more. it seemed to get more painful
[38:40] and that ache it was just kind of on my
[38:43] mind just um but I just felt something
[38:46] in my heart say like why am I letting
[38:48] this worry me and I have a god you can
[38:50] take this away
[38:53] and I was struggling to feel confident
[38:54] in my own faith there was just a lot of
[38:57] unnecessary doubts just going through my
[38:58] mind I was just even questioning like
[39:00] why am I am I doubting this why am I
[39:02] coming across this um in this way um but
[39:06] then I was actually um working through a
[39:08] personal devotional I came across a
[39:09] quote in a passage that really meant a
[39:11] lot to me. It's actually um one I've had
[39:13] for for years and it's the the my quiet
[39:16] time, the ones that they gave out years
[39:18] and years ago uh through voice of God.
[39:20] And um I'd probably come back to and
[39:22] actually just start using it as my my
[39:24] daily devotional. And it uh usually has
[39:27] a quote uh scripture and then just uh
[39:30] areas for your notes. And um I've been
[39:33] using it just to write out prayers and
[39:34] to write out my thoughts.
[39:37] And um and last Saturday on the 14th uh
[39:42] there was a particular quote from uh
[39:44] brother Brandham um from testimony uh
[39:47] preaching 63
[39:49] and it's when he's talking about being
[39:52] on the mountain and when the the storm
[39:54] came and he uh was trying to find his
[39:56] way back and u and he says and staying
[40:00] there at that time I raised up and I
[40:02] said Lord God great creator of nature I
[40:04] believe that is you speaking not one
[40:06] time have you ever showed me anything
[40:08] that was wrong and not one time you let
[40:09] me say anything but what come to pass I
[40:12] said therefore I say to this storm
[40:14] that's a raging go to your places go
[40:15] back leave this alone command that the
[40:18] sun will shine for the next four days
[40:20] till these men can get their trophies
[40:21] and I can get them help them get them
[40:23] and get them out of these mountains and
[40:25] the Lord God who is my solemn judge this
[40:27] morning that rain and things twisting
[40:29] within a moment's time there wasn't a
[40:30] bit of it I looked and there was a wind
[40:32] come from the other way across the top
[40:34] of the mountain and lift up those clouds
[40:35] like that and then just a matter of a
[40:38] few minutes the sun was broke up right
[40:40] through the top and shining right down
[40:41] just as pretty as could be and it's
[40:43] always been one of my my favorite
[40:45] testimonies from brother Ben just that
[40:46] story the way he talks about it is so
[40:48] powerful and then the verse that went
[40:50] with it was Mark 11:23 this I verly say
[40:53] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[40:55] this mountain be thou removed and be
[40:57] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[40:59] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[41:01] that those things which he saith shall
[41:04] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[41:06] saith. I also just want to read my the
[41:10] prayer I wrote out here because it also
[41:12] just kind of goes into the the next part
[41:15] of this. But um I was just really taking
[41:18] some time and just really praying at
[41:21] that time and I wrote I want to
[41:23] strengthen deep and sincerely exercise
[41:25] my faith in accordance with the promises
[41:27] of the word. There are times when I feel
[41:30] weak and unworthy. But the Lord God
[41:32] himself has called me to my position to
[41:34] stand firm on it. He is with me and in
[41:37] me. So I have all authority as a
[41:39] daughter of God to ask what I will in
[41:41] his name. And Lord, I ask you for the
[41:44] healing of the cyst in my hand and you
[41:47] and all that you have for me to come
[41:49] into. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[41:52] And then and I was just quietly just
[41:56] kind of just praying and just like just
[41:58] feeling that system. in my head just
[41:59] like you know no matter what I feel
[42:00] right now that pain that's there it
[42:03] doesn't matter those symptoms it doesn't
[42:04] matter and move forward in faith and
[42:06] just that kind of been on my heart and
[42:08] it just really kind of sunk in deep
[42:09] after that particular
[42:11] uh time and the very next morning which
[42:14] was this past Sunday
[42:17] my dad had actually already come up to
[42:19] pray for the needs and and I just during
[42:22] that time I had raised up my hand
[42:25] I hadn't even realized exactly what he
[42:26] said at the time but I even went back
[42:27] and listened to it. But as I had written
[42:31] down in that prayer saying that I am a
[42:33] daughter of God
[42:35] that specific time when he started
[42:37] praying he said we aren't servants we
[42:39] are children we are offspring of a
[42:41] heavenly father
[42:44] and I at the time I almost couldn't even
[42:46] know what came over me I almost fell out
[42:49] of my chair and just started weeping
[42:51] because when I raised my hand I it felt
[42:53] different when I raised up it's it's was
[42:55] smaller. I didn't feel pain when I
[42:57] touched it
[43:01] and my my hand just kind of felt cool
[43:03] and it I just that whole prayer I just
[43:05] felt it going through my hand
[43:08] and it was just such a powerful just
[43:10] direct answer to that prayer
[43:15] and since then it has not been sensitive
[43:17] I haven't felt pain from it it's been
[43:20] smaller than it was and I'm praying and
[43:22] believing that God will bring a complete
[43:24] healing
[43:26] And I ask for your prayers as well. And
[43:28] I thank you.
[43:36] Hallelujah.
[43:37] [Applause]
[43:39] Hallelujah.
[43:41] Now, that's how you do the fighting. You
[43:43] stand your ground. You know, I've always
[43:45] appreciated Sister Joyce. She's always
[43:48] on the post of duty every time. Amen.
[43:51] And and you could certainly
[43:54] just think about even with pain, she's
[43:56] still there just playing and knowing
[43:58] that she will receive her healing.
[44:00] Certainly thank the Lord for healing
[44:02] her. Amen. Hallelujah. Blessed be his
[44:05] holy name. Give of thee. Amen.
[44:08] Amazing
[44:12] grace,
[44:14] how sweet
[44:16] the sound, all that say
[44:21] for rest like
[44:23] me.
[44:25] Oh, and I want
[44:29] was lost but now.
[44:34] Oh, and was mine,
[44:37] but now

[44:45] that taught
[44:47] my heart
[44:49] to fear and engrave
[44:53] my feet.

[44:58] Oh, and I praise
[45:01] thee
[45:03] thy grace. Hallelujah.

[46:22] has promised.
[46:26] Hallelujah.
[46:28] Oh, his word,
[46:30] my hope.
[46:33] [Music]
[46:35] Oh, anyway,

[46:40] and B. Hallelujah. Oh, and as long
[46:46] as

[47:20] amazing grace. Sing that third verse.
[47:25] The Lord
[47:27] shall soon
[47:29] be dissolve
[47:31] like snow.
[47:33] The son
[47:35] for bear to shine.
[47:41] But God
[47:43] who called
[47:45] me here
[47:49] shall be
[47:51] forever.
[47:56] My chains are gone.
[48:01] I've been set free.
[48:04] My God, my s
[48:08] [Music]
[48:15] His
[48:17] mercy reigns
[48:21] unending love.
[48:25] It's amazing grace. Let's just go before
[48:29] him. Heavenly Father, truly it's amazing
[48:31] grace. And Lord, your love is been what
[48:35] secured us. It's been what set us free.
[48:37] Father, just be with us as we fellowship
[48:39] a little tonight. Lord, the needs of
[48:41] your people. We ask that you'd minister
[48:42] to them. Father, you're the giver of the
[48:45] bread of life. And when we partake of
[48:47] it, it changes us, Lord. We become who
[48:49] you are. Lord, it's in the partaking of
[48:52] it, Father, that there's transforming
[48:54] power. So, we ask that you would just
[48:56] multiply it, Father. May it produce
[48:58] faith and the change that you desire in
[49:00] your people. We commit it to you in the
[49:02] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[49:04] Jesus Christ. We pray and ask these
[49:05] things. Amen. If you turn with me in
[49:08] your Bible, we're going to take a short
[49:10] reading just to fellowship with you
[49:12] around something the Lord uh just put
[49:15] upon my heart and uh hopefully we just
[49:17] tear in it and see what the Lord has for
[49:19] us. It's Deuteronomy uh out of chapter
[49:23] 10 verse 19.
[49:25] Uh just a brief reading. Love ye
[49:28] therefore the stranger, for ye were
[49:30] strangers in the land of Egypt. Ask the
[49:33] Lord to bless the reading of his word to
[49:36] our hearts. And you could be seated.
[49:43] I think there's a quite a bit just in
[49:46] that small reading that we can take from
[49:49] and it would feed us for quite a while.
[49:52] Love ye therefore the stranger for ye
[49:54] were strangers in the land of Egypt.
[49:56] what it what the people are being asked
[49:59] to do and it's quite profound is it's to
[50:01] to think of their time that they
[50:03] sojourned in the land of Egypt and then
[50:06] therefore to love the stranger for they
[50:08] were strangers in Egypt. And I don't
[50:11] know about you, but when I think of the
[50:12] children of Israel being in the land of
[50:14] Egypt, I really don't think of it as a
[50:16] of a as a pleasant time or that they
[50:19] would it would be something to
[50:21] reciprocate love from. But they're told
[50:25] as because they were strangers in the
[50:27] land of Egypt, therefore to love
[50:29] strangers. And it it hearkens to
[50:32] something that I believe is true with
[50:34] the elect of God. When God has shown
[50:36] favor upon you, when he's done something
[50:38] that touch your life, it it causes a
[50:41] different result and a cause and effect
[50:43] in our life is completely different than
[50:46] what it would be in someone else. You
[50:48] would say, "I was a slave there." Um, I
[50:51] in the land of Egypt is where I lost
[50:53] loved ones. In the land of Egypt is
[50:55] where I have bad memories. There's bad
[50:58] things that happened. I And yet this is
[51:01] a fruit of this now is to be that it
[51:04] would enkindle a love for a stranger
[51:07] because you were once a stranger in the
[51:09] land of Egypt. This is not something
[51:11] that a man can do. The commandment here
[51:15] that is being made in the l in the book
[51:17] of Deuteronomy I would say it's the Lord
[51:19] Jesus Christ the living word. The same
[51:21] word that would come and say if you look
[51:23] upon a woman to lust after you have
[51:26] committed adultery with her already.
[51:28] It's the same word that would say uh if
[51:30] someone smites your cheek to turn the
[51:32] other cheek. It's requesting a virtue of
[51:35] someone that would not be in themselves
[51:38] natively to give a after the flesh. This
[51:42] is a commandment to God's elect. Love ye
[51:45] therefore the stranger, for ye were
[51:46] strangers in the land of Egypt. And I I
[51:50] I have to tell you, um, if I was a
[51:54] slave, if I was looking back at the
[51:56] people who had had lashed me, who had if
[51:58] I was trotting out someone else's
[52:00] bricks, if this was work that I didn't
[52:02] want to do of my accord, but was asked
[52:04] of me to do, and I was forced to do it,
[52:07] to eat, to have my provision, I I didn't
[52:09] get to choose my way of life. Someone
[52:11] was choosing my way of life. They
[52:13] probably told me where to live and what
[52:15] time to wake up and what time I could go
[52:17] to bed. It was not a pretty sight. And
[52:21] yet now
[52:23] that is supposed to cause me to love
[52:25] somebody.
[52:29] This isn't this isn't something that I
[52:31] would find in myself that I had the
[52:33] ability to do.
[52:36] And I I just want to ask, does anybody
[52:38] feel like they're a stranger? Amen.
[52:41] Because I I I think that's impressive
[52:43] too that it it identified the people as
[52:46] being a stranger in the land of Egypt.
[52:48] In other words, they didn't fit in.
[52:51] Okay? The ch the Jews were not fitting
[52:54] in with the Egyptians.
[52:56] They were a stranger. They were a
[52:58] stranger because of their custom. They
[52:59] were a stranger because of who their god
[53:01] was. They were a stranger because their
[53:03] affections and the commandments of the
[53:05] things that they kept were completely
[53:07] different from Egypt. So there has to be
[53:09] a setting apart in order for them to be
[53:12] a stranger because it was not just being
[53:14] a just their location that made him a
[53:17] stranger. It wasn't that they were from
[53:20] a different place. It was that they were
[53:22] procurely a called out and
[53:24] differentiated people. And we are
[53:27] strangers in a land. I I feel completely
[53:32] with no identity with what goes on in
[53:34] this world around me. And and now I've
[53:38] been asked to love the stranger. And and
[53:41] I believe that is something that
[53:44] honestly people become stranger and
[53:46] stranger to us. We can't even understand
[53:48] their method of thinking or what they're
[53:50] doing. And the very thing that's
[53:51] supposed to be enkindled in us is a love
[53:54] for them because we are a people that
[53:57] are strange people. At the end of the
[54:00] day, we're the minority and we're the
[54:01] strange ones. That's right.
[54:04] You know, it's it's the it's us that are
[54:07] the oddballs and we're the nut and bolt
[54:10] that's keeping it all together.
[54:12] Okay.
[54:14] And just as we would unpack that, um,
[54:19] it it to me is very similar to, like I
[54:22] said, turning the other cheek, but I
[54:25] would just ask myself to remember the
[54:27] things that I've been through because
[54:29] it's a it's a recollection and a
[54:31] recalling of the things that have been
[54:33] in your past that tells you how you're
[54:36] supposed to respond to the situations
[54:37] you're in. He who's forgiven much loves
[54:40] much. So this is something that's
[54:42] profound because really they're the
[54:44] people that were brought out by a mighty
[54:47] hand out of the land of Egypt. So this
[54:49] is something that they could look back
[54:50] and say, "I know I was a sojourer when I
[54:53] was in the land of Egypt. I'm as if I
[54:56] was the slave that was a that was
[54:58] working and and and toiling because he
[55:01] knew he was a prince in another land and
[55:03] someone could look at him and say, "Why
[55:04] does he behave different?" Well, he
[55:06] knows he doesn't belong here. So there's
[55:09] a there's a sense of identity that the
[55:12] people of Israel could have in looking
[55:15] back at the time they spent in Egypt
[55:17] knowing that they were in the promised
[55:19] land. So they had come into possession
[55:22] of something that gave them a virtue
[55:24] that they could look back and say it was
[55:27] worth it all.
[55:29] Look where the Lord has brought us to.
[55:32] We are in a land. We we we're coming to
[55:34] a place of of promise. We've come out of
[55:37] a place that we were in and we've
[55:39] received a deliverance and we're we have
[55:42] a promised land that we're heading
[55:43] towards. So what is it now that we can
[55:46] have? It's a virtue and a strength that
[55:48] we never had before.
[55:51] And I I I take it as a promise to myself
[55:54] that I can look back at the things that
[55:56] God has brought me from and in that I
[55:59] can then have the grace for others. None
[56:02] of us were in ourselves delivered
[56:04] ourselves, but it was a mighty hand of
[56:07] God that brought us out of the hand of
[56:08] Egypt. It wasn't We didn't have the
[56:10] ability to do it. We would be still
[56:12] stomping someone else's bricks right
[56:14] now.
[56:18] It It's not because we had the ability
[56:20] to to change our ways. We couldn't, you
[56:22] know, we couldn't lick the spots off. We
[56:25] were We were sinners, bound in sin, but
[56:28] the mighty hand of God delivered us.
[56:31] So then who is then who can we hold that
[56:34] someone's sin to their account?
[56:37] We we don't have our own righteousness
[56:39] but we would we would being forgiven
[56:41] much now look at somebody else and not
[56:44] forgive them and not not hold the same
[56:47] forgiveness that's for them. But we can
[56:50] because there's a love of God that has
[56:52] been given and shown to you that you can
[56:54] love the stranger.
[56:56] This is a testimony of God's elect.
[56:59] And you you can't give what you ain't
[57:01] got.
[57:03] And and I say that to the testimony of
[57:05] what you've been shown is the grace of
[57:07] God and the love of God. That's an
[57:08] inexhaustible fountain. You can forgive
[57:11] because you've been forgiven. You can
[57:14] love much because you've been shown a
[57:16] lot of love. And it's simply in the rec
[57:19] just stop and remember sometimes what
[57:21] the Lord has brought you from.
[57:25] You you you simply have to recall, wait
[57:27] a second, Lord. I was once alienated
[57:29] from you. I didn't even know you. I
[57:32] didn't know your love. I was a stranger
[57:34] to you. I allowed my heart to wander. I
[57:37] allowed my affections to be on other
[57:38] things. But in all of that, you loved
[57:40] me. Amen. And you sought me.
[57:44] And in that, we can love and have a
[57:46] strength for others that can change
[57:48] their lives. So, it's quite amazing. A
[57:51] root of bitterness defiles many. You You
[57:54] could look and say, "Man, what a scarred
[57:56] life. Why are you this way? Why are you
[57:58] contankerous? Why are you angry? Why are
[58:00] you bitter? Why do you trust no one? Why
[58:02] is it that you're that way?" "Well, man,
[58:04] you just don't know my background. You
[58:06] just don't know what I've been through.
[58:07] Everybody I loved and trusted,
[58:09] everybody's always betrayed me.
[58:11] Everybody's always done me wrong. Yet, m
[58:14] every time I look to get the advantage
[58:16] on someone is because that's just
[58:18] everybody's out for their own. It's dog
[58:19] eat dog. If if anyone comes my way, I'm
[58:22] just scheming on what I can do to come
[58:25] out on top because you ain't going to
[58:26] get the best of me.
[58:30] And matter of fact, when I do you wrong,
[58:32] you're probably going to be looking how
[58:34] to do the flip on someone else because
[58:36] I'm going to teach you how to do people
[58:38] dirty.
[58:41] And that's what's bread. That is what is
[58:44] being
[58:45] a a little leaven. That's the leaven
[58:48] that is out there
[58:51] just
[58:53] multiplying and multiplying hurt,
[58:55] sorrow, bitterness. But what are you?
[58:58] You're the salt of the earth. You're the
[59:01] light set upon a hill. You're the one
[59:03] who could say, "I know what it's like to
[59:05] be forgiven. I know what it's like to
[59:07] have all my debt completely erased. What
[59:11] is this source that you forgive from?
[59:14] I've been a recipient of unmmerited
[59:16] favor and grace. God in his goodness
[59:19] reached out to me in my life and touched
[59:21] me. I can show you what it's like to be
[59:23] forgiven. What did What did I do to
[59:25] deserve it? Oh, nothing.
[59:28] I just wanted to do something a little
[59:29] good.
[59:32] Well, why would you do that? Well, I
[59:33] know what it's like. I know what it's
[59:36] like for someone to pull me up out of
[59:37] the mud and out of the clay,
[59:40] to deliver me from the pit and from my
[59:42] bondage and from my taskmaster.
[59:45] I know what it's like to be set free.
[59:48] I could remember what it was like to be
[59:50] a stranger.
[59:53] And I, you know, um,
[59:58] you know, it's that he who's forgiven
[1:00:00] much loves much. I believe was what
[1:00:03] Jesus said. Um
[1:00:08] when the when the woman was washing his
[1:00:10] feet,
[1:00:17] it's in uh Luke 7:36.
[1:00:22] And one of the Pharisees desired him
[1:00:25] that he would eat with him. And he went
[1:00:28] into the Pharisees house and sat down to
[1:00:30] meet. And behold, a woman in the
[1:00:35] Pardon me. A behold a woman in the city
[1:00:39] which was a sinner.
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:48] So I was sitting in my throat.
[1:00:53] And behold, a woman in the city, which
[1:00:55] was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus
[1:00:57] sat at me in the Pharisees house,
[1:01:00] brought in an alabaster box of ointment,
[1:01:05] and stood at the feet.
[1:01:11] I know we all identify with this. It's
[1:01:13] kind of hard to read.
[1:01:16] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[1:01:18] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:01:21] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:01:23] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:01:26] them with ointment. Now when the
[1:01:28] Pharisees which had bidden him saw it,
[1:01:31] he spake within himself, saying, "This
[1:01:34] man, if he were a prophet,
[1:01:37] would have known who and what manner of
[1:01:39] woman this is that touchth him, for
[1:01:42] she's a sinner." And Jesus answered and
[1:01:45] said unto him,"Simon, I have somewhat to
[1:01:48] say unto thee." And he saith, "Master,
[1:01:52] say on."
[1:01:54] I'm sure he wasn't ready for what he was
[1:01:56] about to hear. There was a certain
[1:01:59] creditor which had two debtors. The one
[1:02:03] owed 500 pence and the other 50. And
[1:02:06] when they had nothing to pay, he frankly
[1:02:08] forgave them both. Tell me who therefore
[1:02:13] which of them will love him most. Simon
[1:02:16] answered and said, I suppose that he to
[1:02:19] whom he forgave most.
[1:02:31] unto Simon, "Seeest thou this woman? I
[1:02:35] entered into thine house. They g th thou
[1:02:38] gavest me no water for my feet, but she
[1:02:42] hath washed my feet with tears, and
[1:02:44] wiped them with the hair with her head.
[1:02:46] Thou gavest me no kiss. But this woman,
[1:02:49] since the time I came in, hath not
[1:02:51] ceased to kiss my feet. my head with
[1:02:54] oil, thou dost not anoint, but this
[1:02:57] woman hath anointed my feet with
[1:02:59] ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her
[1:03:02] sins which are many are forgiven. For
[1:03:05] she loved much, but to whom little is
[1:03:08] forgiven, the same loveth little. And he
[1:03:11] said unto her, thy sins are forgiven
[1:03:14] thee. Amen. I feel that when we come
[1:03:16] into the house of God, if we want to
[1:03:18] just enter into an atmosphere of giving
[1:03:20] him a blessing of washing his feet, we
[1:03:22] simply need to remember what we've been
[1:03:24] forgiven of. It it should be such a way
[1:03:27] that we come into the house of the Lord
[1:03:29] that we're quick to forgive, that we're
[1:03:31] quick to make sure there's no in our
[1:03:33] hearts, and we simply have to start
[1:03:35] anointing his feet with our tears. We
[1:03:37] have to be willing to put ourselves
[1:03:38] before him and say, "Lord, you forgave
[1:03:40] me. You know where I've been. you know
[1:03:43] what I've done, but I'm here to worship
[1:03:45] you. I'm here to anoint your feet. I'm
[1:03:47] here to give you the there. I can't hide
[1:03:49] from you anything I've done anywhere
[1:03:51] I've been. I can't approach you through
[1:03:53] pretense. I can't approach you through
[1:03:55] my own righteousness. You know all about
[1:03:57] me, but I'm here to come before you and
[1:04:00] tell you you're my Lord. I'm here to
[1:04:02] come and tell you you're the one that
[1:04:03] matters most. I'm blocking out all the
[1:04:05] spectacle. I don't care who's watching
[1:04:08] me. What matters is I'm with you.
[1:04:11] The fact that she found his feet was
[1:04:14] enough.
[1:04:15] And you have that opportunity every time
[1:04:17] you come into the house of the Lord is
[1:04:19] to shut everything else out and say,
[1:04:21] "Lord, I'm coming to you. I'm not coming
[1:04:24] to you based on anything that I've done
[1:04:25] or haven't done. I'm coming to you
[1:04:28] because who you are, and you're the
[1:04:30] answer. You're the one who can forgive
[1:04:31] the sin. You're the one who can make it
[1:04:33] all right. And when I'm in your
[1:04:35] presence, it's all good. I know what
[1:04:37] it's like to be in the presence of the
[1:04:38] master. And it doesn't matter.
[1:04:40] Everything else fades away.
[1:04:44] I know who I'm with and it doesn't
[1:04:46] matter. I could just sit there and weep
[1:04:48] for eternity. It's okay. I'm there. I'm
[1:04:52] I'm thankful for those moments when
[1:04:54] everything else doesn't matter. That's
[1:04:57] the place we can get to. You know,
[1:04:58] that's the place when it doesn't matter.
[1:05:00] Will you love your enemies?
[1:05:02] If there's something that would cause us
[1:05:04] to not have the virtue of Christ, we
[1:05:06] just need to get back to his feet.
[1:05:07] That's right. You just need to be get
[1:05:09] back to know who's in control. The one
[1:05:12] who forgives sins is the one who's in
[1:05:14] control because that is the one who has
[1:05:17] the power to of eternal life. We don't
[1:05:20] There's no form of life, eternal life
[1:05:22] except God's own life. So who's in
[1:05:24] control?
[1:05:25] You could gain the whole world but lose
[1:05:27] your soul. What did it matter? It
[1:05:30] doesn't matter. When you look at what
[1:05:32] salvation we've been given, that is the
[1:05:35] strength we draw from. You cast down any
[1:05:38] other reasoning, any other logic, it
[1:05:41] look it doesn't matter if someone
[1:05:42] defrauds you. It wasn't yours to begin
[1:05:45] with.
[1:05:49] We don't have a sense of ownership.
[1:05:54] It's all his. We forfeited it. A lamb
[1:05:56] gave up its rights.
[1:05:58] I don't have nothing unless he provides
[1:06:00] it. I don't have nothing unless he pre A
[1:06:03] strong man watches the house in vain.
[1:06:06] We don't have a guarantee of tomorrow,
[1:06:08] but for the grace of God.
[1:06:10] If you want to frustrate yourself, act
[1:06:13] like you're the one holding on.
[1:06:16] If you you know, it's it's it's the
[1:06:21] the ability of God is to put bring you
[1:06:23] through things so that you know him
[1:06:25] better.
[1:06:27] He's going to he So when it when the I
[1:06:29] mean you look at really what at the end
[1:06:31] of the day was the children of Israel
[1:06:33] could go back and look back and say the
[1:06:35] strongest nation on earth couldn't hold
[1:06:37] us.
[1:06:40] The strongest one
[1:06:42] with their strongest armies could not
[1:06:44] hold us. And I'm here to tell you you're
[1:06:46] free. There is nothing you're bound to.
[1:06:49] There's nothing that holds you. And
[1:06:51] you're a debtor to nothing.
[1:06:53] And part of your liberty that you have
[1:06:55] in Christ Jesus is to recognize that
[1:06:58] neither do you own anything. You know,
[1:07:00] one of the things I recognized when I
[1:07:02] would deal with that some of the
[1:07:03] homeless people, you know why they chose
[1:07:05] to be indigent? They don't have a care.
[1:07:09] I don't have nothing to lose. And they
[1:07:10] mean it.
[1:07:13] They really mean it. It is a they it be
[1:07:17] they've recognized for their mental
[1:07:18] health and well-being, it's better for
[1:07:20] them just not to have nothing.
[1:07:22] It's easier on them. It is a choice.
[1:07:26] Matter of fact, don't give me anything.
[1:07:29] I would have to worry about losing it.
[1:07:32] And that sounds something, but some of
[1:07:34] us just need to die enough. Just need to
[1:07:36] let go enough. Just need to come into
[1:07:38] the house of the Lord with a little bit
[1:07:40] more liberty to recognize that you're
[1:07:42] free. I mean, I I don't even know what
[1:07:44] sometimes we're holding on to our
[1:07:46] dignity.
[1:07:50] You know what are we holding on to?
[1:07:52] Lord, let me let it go. I don't want to
[1:07:54] stay. I don't want my pride to keep me.
[1:07:56] That's a nasty thing. I've been a victim
[1:07:58] of my pride more than I want to admit.
[1:08:01] But that's pride that would make me not
[1:08:02] want to admit it.
[1:08:05] And I still don't want to admit it.
[1:08:10] I mean, we we are helpless. We are
[1:08:14] sheep. We really have no way around this
[1:08:16] but to die.
[1:08:19] We don't have another way of doing this
[1:08:21] except to put off our mind and put on
[1:08:24] the mind of Christ. And we have a sure
[1:08:26] approach.
[1:08:28] We have the grace of God. We have the
[1:08:30] Holy Spirit. We have something that
[1:08:32] could come and wash our minds and make
[1:08:33] us new. And to say, "Lord, I remember
[1:08:36] what it was like to be a stranger in
[1:08:38] Egypt." You know, my brother, one time
[1:08:40] we were we were
[1:08:43] walking down the street and a bunch of
[1:08:44] cops pulled up and they were after the
[1:08:47] guy we were with and I'm all ready to
[1:08:50] have an argument with a cop cuz I know
[1:08:53] my rights.
[1:08:55] I'm just walking down the sidewalk as a
[1:08:58] young American teenager and I've got my
[1:09:00] rights. Who's your supervisor?
[1:09:06] you know, I mean, like, I'm ready to go.
[1:09:09] Like, why are you stopping me? I don't
[1:09:11] need to give you my name. I mean, this
[1:09:13] is, you know, just naturally me.
[1:09:17] And and Matthew goes, "David,
[1:09:20] sit back and enjoy the lights."
[1:09:27] I said, "You're right." So, we sit down
[1:09:30] on the ground and we watch him this guy
[1:09:32] up and take him to jail. But all I had
[1:09:35] to do to change the paradigm is
[1:09:38] recognize I didn't have nothing to
[1:09:40] defend.
[1:09:43] But I was all bulldog.
[1:09:45] I was all in the fight.
[1:09:49] And it just had to change. I just had to
[1:09:53] say, "Wait a second. You're right. This
[1:09:55] situation is totally not what I'm making
[1:09:58] it. I might as well just let the process
[1:10:01] unfold." We have someone who's in
[1:10:03] control.
[1:10:06] The grace of God is alive and well. He
[1:10:09] knows your tomorrow. You don't need to
[1:10:12] frustrate the grace of God. You don't
[1:10:14] need to You simply need to look back and
[1:10:16] say, "He, I've been through enough to
[1:10:18] know he'll be enough. He He if I'm here,
[1:10:21] the grace of God brought me here. It's
[1:10:23] the grace of God that's going to see me
[1:10:25] on. I I can encourage my heart in the
[1:10:28] things of the Lord and I can take say
[1:10:30] booevil. Come on. I'm not going to let
[1:10:33] you rob my joy. I'm going to give God
[1:10:35] the praise. That's dumm. You're not
[1:10:37] going to cause me to think that my God
[1:10:39] hasn't preserved my tomorrow. That he's
[1:10:42] not the one who's holding my health.
[1:10:44] That he's not the one who held my hand.
[1:10:46] That he didn't see me in my mother's
[1:10:48] womb. That he's not the one who
[1:10:49] delivered me. He's the same yesterday,
[1:10:51] today, and forever. Why am I going to
[1:10:53] stop praising my God?
[1:10:56] He's the lifter of my head. If you could
[1:10:58] just see where he brought me from, oh
[1:11:00] man, them bricks of Egypt, man, the mud
[1:11:02] used to get to my knees. I would come
[1:11:05] home, I'd be so stiff.
[1:11:09] I was a I was a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:10] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:10] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:10] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:10] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:10] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:11:11] a a a a a a a a a a a a brick stomper
[1:11:12] for the devil.
[1:11:14] But now by the grace of God, he's washed
[1:11:17] me up by his Holy Spirit. There ain't no
[1:11:19] more mud of the world on me. My life, I
[1:11:22] want to cry, holy, holy, holy unto the
[1:11:24] Lord God Almighty. I don't want an
[1:11:26] identity with Egypt. What's people's
[1:11:28] problem? Why do they want to have an
[1:11:30] identity with Egypt anyways?
[1:11:34] A bunch of slavery. Like why do I want
[1:11:37] to glorify slavery? But things that
[1:11:40] people are in bondage to and people want
[1:11:42] to wear the trinket.
[1:11:45] You know, I don't want to identify with
[1:11:47] and what I mean by that is um there's
[1:11:51] things that you may have the liberty to
[1:11:52] do and it's not sin, but there could be
[1:11:55] things that people are in bondage to it.
[1:11:57] You're not in bondage to it, but someone
[1:11:59] else is. You know, so if you're me
[1:12:00] offends somebody, you know, you you you
[1:12:03] you recognize that wait a second, this
[1:12:05] could be a weakness of theirs. This
[1:12:06] defiles their conscience. They can't
[1:12:08] have confidence towards God if they do
[1:12:10] these things. So, I'm going to sanctify
[1:12:12] myself for their sakes because I
[1:12:14] wouldn't want them to see my liberty and
[1:12:16] be stumbled by it. Okay. So that is that
[1:12:19] is a that is a mindset that we want to
[1:12:22] be able to be washed by the water of the
[1:12:24] word and say okay wait a second Lord
[1:12:26] allow me to have a a an insight on my
[1:12:30] liberty before the people before the
[1:12:32] great you know as I am an example and an
[1:12:35] encouragement a source of strength for
[1:12:37] others that my my footsteps could be
[1:12:40] ordered in such a way that it wouldn't
[1:12:42] stumble somebody
[1:12:44] avoiding the very appearance of evil Um,
[1:12:48] if someone doesn't know it's an odus is
[1:12:51] non-alcoholic and you're drinking an
[1:12:53] oels, they may just think you're
[1:12:56] pounding a beer.
[1:12:58] I remember pulling up beside someone in
[1:13:00] a car one time and I think it was maybe
[1:13:02] when Red Bulls first came out, you know,
[1:13:05] and I'm just like, "Hey, you can't be
[1:13:07] drinking and driving, man."
[1:13:11] and they're like,
[1:13:15] you know, but there we we sometimes just
[1:13:17] don't know what something looks like,
[1:13:20] right? And really, unless God shows us
[1:13:23] those things, we won't. But the point
[1:13:26] is, a lot of times we're showing
[1:13:28] something that has a semblance to
[1:13:30] something we really know nothing about.
[1:13:32] But you take somebody who's been there.
[1:13:34] You take someone who's been in the mud
[1:13:36] pits of Egypt and they could tell you,
[1:13:38] "Hey, you may not know this, but what
[1:13:40] you're dealing with goes a lot further
[1:13:42] than you realize.
[1:13:45] It starts there, but it ends up here."
[1:13:48] You know, that little storytelling that
[1:13:50] ends up over here. You know, that little
[1:13:52] that's that's what we call a white lie.
[1:13:56] You know that that's actually becomes
[1:13:59] gossip.
[1:14:01] you know that that you're feeding on
[1:14:03] something that it grows. Beware. And we
[1:14:07] should be willing to subject ourselves
[1:14:08] one to another as iron sharpeneth iron
[1:14:10] and say, you know what, my brother, I
[1:14:12] never thought of that before.
[1:14:15] I I I pray that God allows me the grace,
[1:14:18] you know, hopefully it's not an
[1:14:20] encumberment. I want to be able to lay
[1:14:22] things down. I don't believe as the body
[1:14:25] of Christ, we are underneath anybody's
[1:14:28] influence. that as as we care for one
[1:14:30] another, I really don't feel that if
[1:14:32] someone came to me, I would be seen that
[1:14:34] someone who was just wanting to assert
[1:14:36] their authority and their influence on
[1:14:38] me. I believe that it would be the love
[1:14:40] of Christ in them when they came to me
[1:14:42] to correct me that they were interested
[1:14:44] in my good.
[1:14:46] I believe that. Amen. I really do. And
[1:14:49] if we have that love and care one for
[1:14:52] another, and that I appreciate, brother
[1:14:54] Tommy, that is the love we have for
[1:14:56] another. I'm not bringing that into
[1:14:57] question, but I feel like we could um
[1:15:00] have a greater liberty and a confidence
[1:15:02] towards one another to be that voice
[1:15:06] to be the encouragement to the young
[1:15:07] men, the men to be examples, the old
[1:15:10] elder sisters to be examples to the
[1:15:11] younger. We are a body jointly fit
[1:15:14] together. We need one another. We
[1:15:16] absolutely have to have it. You know
[1:15:18] what they do in the world? They they do
[1:15:20] a lot to get customer surveys and
[1:15:22] feedback. They really really try to get
[1:15:25] customers to tell them what they're
[1:15:27] thinking. We should be able to love one
[1:15:31] another enough to go to to each other
[1:15:33] and tell each other what we're thinking.
[1:15:36] Brother, I didn't see you on Sunday. I
[1:15:39] didn't see you. Is everything okay?
[1:15:43] Is Is there Is there You know what? I I
[1:15:47] hear you got a job. That's great. The
[1:15:48] Lord's blessed you. But are you
[1:15:50] worshiping your job now? Maybe you don't
[1:15:53] say it like that.
[1:15:58] I'm praying that you get a new job.
[1:16:03] But, you know, there's a there's got to
[1:16:05] be an understanding of what we testify
[1:16:08] to by where you set your priorities.
[1:16:11] The the best way to be an example is put
[1:16:13] God first.
[1:16:15] I if if you want others to know what you
[1:16:17] care about, put the things of the Lord
[1:16:19] first. And it it it's I'm not telling
[1:16:21] you to manufacture something ain't real.
[1:16:23] I'm just telling you to be don't be
[1:16:25] ashamed to shine your light.
[1:16:28] Just don't be ashamed. Just tell them
[1:16:29] what what matters to you. And and that
[1:16:33] in itself puts the Lord in action. Hey,
[1:16:37] you know, I really don't want to be
[1:16:38] here. I you may notice that I'm I I
[1:16:41] really wish I was at church right now. I
[1:16:43] miss it. I don't want to be here, but
[1:16:45] I'm here because you made me feel like I
[1:16:47] didn't have a choice and that if I
[1:16:48] didn't work, but my heart's in the house
[1:16:50] of God. Do you know what it's like to go
[1:16:52] to church? Do you know what it's like to
[1:16:54] walk in and recognize the atmosphere,
[1:16:56] the power of the Holy Spirit, and to
[1:16:57] have your fears and your doubts dissolve
[1:16:59] and everything with the pressure of that
[1:17:01] day, everything that was building up,
[1:17:03] and it just felt like my mind was going
[1:17:05] a mile a minute. And when I walked in,
[1:17:06] it was like everything was okay. Do you
[1:17:08] know what that's like,
[1:17:10] man? That's where I want to be. I want
[1:17:12] to be in the house of the Lord. They'll
[1:17:14] kick you out.
[1:17:16] They Yeah. Why don't you just go to
[1:17:17] church? Instead of bringing your church
[1:17:20] here, why don't you just go to church? I
[1:17:23] you want separate. What kicked them out
[1:17:25] of Egypt anyways? Right. You just indeed
[1:17:27] invite God on the scene and recognize
[1:17:30] who's in control.
[1:17:33] Um
[1:17:36] yeah, appreciate you guys fellowshipping
[1:17:38] with me, but I like to look back at what
[1:17:39] the Lord's brought me from.
[1:17:42] Because I if if really if anything
[1:17:45] happens in our lives where we're losing
[1:17:48] the the joy in our life, we simply need
[1:17:50] to recognize what God has brought us
[1:17:52] from.
[1:17:54] And it's enough if you've been forgiven
[1:17:56] much. And trust me, we've been forgiven
[1:17:59] all.
[1:18:01] David would even say it this way.
[1:18:02] Blessed is the man in unto the whom the
[1:18:05] Lord will not impute unrighteousness.
[1:18:07] You're the very elect of God. You're
[1:18:09] miss Jesus Christ. You're bone of his
[1:18:12] bone, flesh of his flesh. In this day,
[1:18:14] you you you had the word come open and
[1:18:16] read your name right off the book and
[1:18:18] say you never did it in the first place.
[1:18:20] This message by God's prophet came and
[1:18:22] told you you're the spotless bride of
[1:18:25] Jesus Christ. And that's the love of God
[1:18:28] to you.
[1:18:30] Now,
[1:18:32] let it be real to you.
[1:18:34] We simply have to wash our minds of
[1:18:37] anything that would tell us contrary and
[1:18:39] there would be a source of joy and a
[1:18:41] source of strength and a source of
[1:18:42] grace. But if we can really grasp the
[1:18:45] full revelation of that this world isn't
[1:18:47] holding us.
[1:18:50] You could steal my coat and I can give
[1:18:52] you my cloak. I know the master that
[1:18:55] owns the cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:19:00] Hey, it it there's nothing. Don't be
[1:19:03] afraid of him who could destroy your
[1:19:04] flesh.
[1:19:06] That in all that this world can do, it
[1:19:10] could only do one thing, and that's
[1:19:11] cause you to know God better.
[1:19:15] It doesn't matter. The waster could come
[1:19:17] and he could torment you. He could give
[1:19:19] you sickness. God could put you through
[1:19:21] a trial just enough to break some bands
[1:19:23] of the world. But the only thing you're
[1:19:24] going to do as a son of God is you're
[1:19:26] going to know him better. You're going
[1:19:28] to know him as the one who delivers you
[1:19:29] from a from the from the hand of the of
[1:19:32] the tormentor. You're going to know him
[1:19:34] as the healer. Whatever it is that Satan
[1:19:37] has buffeted you with. And I and I I
[1:19:40] tell you what, it's the grace of God to
[1:19:42] bring the growing pains. That's
[1:19:44] ultimately what it is. If you God's not
[1:19:46] the author of confusion. What I want you
[1:19:49] to understand is that you could be in
[1:19:51] your Egypt and you could be in your mud
[1:19:52] pit, but God's a deliverer. And if you
[1:19:55] recognize that what he's doing is going
[1:19:57] to bring you out by a mighty hand. You
[1:19:59] can say, "Oh, my hour of deliverance is
[1:20:01] coming.
[1:20:03] I know that even in the midst of this,
[1:20:05] my God's hand is able to deliver me."
[1:20:07] And I and and through all of this, I'm
[1:20:10] going to know him greater.
[1:20:13] How? How can you know him greater?
[1:20:16] Because in my weakness, he's made
[1:20:17] strong. Because in the things that I'm
[1:20:19] not able to do, he's able. I'm going to
[1:20:22] know that I can't and he can.
[1:20:25] Well, you're just going to fail. That's
[1:20:26] right. But he's a mighty deliverer. How
[1:20:29] is it that this could be that? No matter
[1:20:31] what, you're only getting closer to him.
[1:20:34] That's right. No matter what, I'm only
[1:20:37] getting closer to him. I'm not backing
[1:20:39] up. I'm not retreating. And it's the
[1:20:42] grace of God in my life that's going to
[1:20:43] turn those things that were meant for
[1:20:45] evil to good. You can do as much as you
[1:20:49] want, Satan. You're a bluff. You have no
[1:20:52] more arrows. That's right. You're a
[1:20:55] bluff. I've read. We can go in and read
[1:20:58] the book. The son of predition is
[1:21:00] thoroughly exposed.
[1:21:02] Thoroughly exposed.
[1:21:05] We are who we are because of who he is.
[1:21:08] Our identity and his identity is just
[1:21:10] like Eve was in Adam.
[1:21:13] You cannot be se you can't be separated
[1:21:15] from him.
[1:21:18] You're just as much eternal as he's
[1:21:21] eternal.
[1:21:25] We if if that picture starts to melt
[1:21:28] into our minds, this world starts losing
[1:21:30] its hold on us. We start to recognize,
[1:21:34] oh, but for a season. Lord, I want to
[1:21:36] make sure that my life's testifying that
[1:21:39] your kingdom is what's eternal. This is
[1:21:41] just temporal. You know, you could you
[1:21:44] could do what you will. You know, we
[1:21:47] went through a little thing recently
[1:21:49] where we we uh we got into a house that
[1:21:53] we had let someone stay in for a little
[1:21:55] bit and my my my my
[1:21:59] perplexed.
[1:22:01] I thought it was vandalism.
[1:22:05] I was like, "This was malicious.
[1:22:07] There's no way that someone does this."
[1:22:09] This was the on. They gave 50 kids hand
[1:22:13] paints and said, "Go at it."
[1:22:18] Last day, fingerpainting wall day. You
[1:22:20] know, it looked that bad. I mean, it
[1:22:23] just was like, "Okay, this was
[1:22:24] malicious."
[1:22:27] Julia's quoting a scripture, you know, a
[1:22:30] a child unattended or something like
[1:22:32] that will bring the mother to scorn,
[1:22:36] you know, something like that. And so it
[1:22:38] just was, you know, I was perplexed
[1:22:44] and you know, me and Julie was just
[1:22:46] talking about it and it's like, you know
[1:22:48] what,
[1:22:50] uh, we had no animosity in our hearts
[1:22:53] and we were more concerned about, you
[1:22:57] know, other things than our own
[1:22:58] well-being. It's quite the mess to clean
[1:23:00] up. But I'm telling you, when you
[1:23:02] recognize that everything that we've
[1:23:05] been given is by God's hand
[1:23:08] and the grace of God, that is a source
[1:23:11] of strength that Satan wants to isolate
[1:23:13] you from. He wants you to make it
[1:23:15] another problem. He makes you he wants
[1:23:18] you to he wants you to forget that you
[1:23:20] were once a stranger in Egypt.
[1:23:24] And we have to remember saints, we've
[1:23:26] been forgiven much.
[1:23:28] We have I it is it is unfortunate the
[1:23:31] way that man I think brother Ben was
[1:23:32] even talking about it the way that
[1:23:34] people possibly could could try to size
[1:23:36] people up and itemize them. We're
[1:23:37] children of God.
[1:23:39] We have no we have no right to treat
[1:23:42] anybody any different. Matter of fact,
[1:23:44] if you go back to our reading where we
[1:23:46] read this in Deuteronomy, it has a
[1:23:49] little more context. Uh if you back up
[1:23:51] to Deuteronomy 10
[1:23:54] uh verse 17,
[1:23:57] it says, "For the Lord your God is God
[1:23:59] of gods, and the Lord of lords, and a
[1:24:02] great God, a mighty and terrible, which
[1:24:05] regardeth not persons, nor nor taketh
[1:24:09] reward. He doth execute judgment of the
[1:24:12] fatherless and the widow, and loveth the
[1:24:15] stranger in giving him food and
[1:24:17] remnant."
[1:24:19] Ah, isn't that something?
[1:24:22] This is something the Lord practices
[1:24:24] what he preaches. He tends to the
[1:24:26] stranger, and he loveth the stranger.
[1:24:28] And then that therefore is the
[1:24:29] commandment to you. Love ye therefore
[1:24:31] the stranger, for ye were strangers in
[1:24:34] the land of Egypt. Thou shalt fear the
[1:24:36] Lord thy God, and him thou shalt serve,
[1:24:38] and to him shalt thou cleave, and to
[1:24:41] swear by his name. I love that. We have
[1:24:43] to cleave to him.
[1:24:45] We He He has a commandment for us to
[1:24:47] cleave to him. We don't need to look to
[1:24:49] anything else for our comfort. We need
[1:24:51] to cleave to Christ. Cleave means to
[1:24:54] hold to hold fast to to draw yourself up
[1:24:56] close to to hang on for dear life. To
[1:25:00] cleave to it like it matters. That's the
[1:25:03] that's the uh desire of God towards us.
[1:25:10] He is thy praise.
[1:25:14] Let me back up. For thou shalt fear the
[1:25:15] Lord God. To him shalt thou serve. And
[1:25:17] to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by
[1:25:19] his name. He is thy praise,
[1:25:23] and he is thy God that hath done for
[1:25:25] thee great and terrible things which thy
[1:25:28] eyes have seen.
[1:25:31] There was such a desire for this
[1:25:33] remembrance to be brought before the
[1:25:35] children of Israel and their children
[1:25:37] perpetually. if they're and they were
[1:25:40] given to us an example. You know how
[1:25:42] easy it was for them to forget?
[1:25:45] You know, I'll tell you,
[1:25:51] I don't want to say it mean that. So,
[1:25:53] that's maybe me preaching at myself a
[1:25:56] little bit.
[1:25:58] Remember what he's done
[1:26:01] and ask yourself how that should affect
[1:26:03] your your approach and praise to him.
[1:26:08] Ask if you can at least
[1:26:11] give him some praise. That's due his
[1:26:13] name to give him some time. And I and I
[1:26:16] and I do mean in the house of the Lord,
[1:26:17] but you know praise is my brother Mike
[1:26:20] Jr. was probably one of the first people
[1:26:21] that he he said, you know, praise one of
[1:26:23] the highest forms of praise is
[1:26:25] emulation.
[1:26:28] When you behave the way someone else's
[1:26:32] behaved, it's one of the highest for
[1:26:34] forms of praise.
[1:26:37] You've been forgiven.
[1:26:40] You want to praise him, forgive.
[1:26:45] It's I it if he entertain the loveth the
[1:26:48] stranger, you want to praise him, love
[1:26:52] the stranger.
[1:26:55] Don't accept a national attitude or a
[1:26:57] different mindset or some modern way of
[1:26:59] thinking. You don't have an identity
[1:27:02] outside of the identity that Christ gave
[1:27:04] you as a forgiven son and daughter of
[1:27:07] God. Don't lose your identity.
[1:27:11] Don't let this world try to give you
[1:27:12] one. You're identified by his grace and
[1:27:16] his forgiveness. You're identified the
[1:27:18] same way the woman that was washing his
[1:27:20] feet was identified. Thy sins be
[1:27:22] forgiven thee. At that point, she was
[1:27:24] the woman whose sins, though they were
[1:27:26] great, were forgiven her. She had that
[1:27:29] identity.
[1:27:31] And you have the opportunity to give
[1:27:33] that identity out. You want to be You
[1:27:35] want to be identified as the person who
[1:27:37] hasn't been forgiven, don't forgive.
[1:27:40] You want to be identified as the person
[1:27:42] that doesn't know the grace of God,
[1:27:43] don't have grace. You want to be
[1:27:45] identified as someone who
[1:27:49] doesn't know what it's like to be set
[1:27:51] free.
[1:27:53] Don't give the benefit of the doubt of
[1:27:55] showing someone the true liberty you
[1:27:57] have in Christ. Show them you're in
[1:27:58] bondage to the same vice that they have.
[1:28:01] Well, yeah, let's just go do it
[1:28:03] together.
[1:28:05] When I leave you, I won't be having to
[1:28:07] do it. I know you'll be stuck doing it
[1:28:08] for ever, but that's your problem.
[1:28:14] But you can say, "No, I have a greater
[1:28:16] liberty. That's okay. I don't want to do
[1:28:18] that.
[1:28:20] I'm not going to do that with you. I
[1:28:22] have a I have I'm free from that. I
[1:28:24] don't have to do that. If you need to do
[1:28:25] that to be happy, that's fine. But for
[1:28:27] me, I've been set free.
[1:28:31] You know, that's what starts to
[1:28:32] separate. I there was times in my life
[1:28:35] is that the Lord changed me. I had
[1:28:37] patterns in my life. Uh you know, I
[1:28:40] would get ride home a ride home from
[1:28:41] school. Well, I didn't dawn on me after
[1:28:43] the Lord changed my life that the people
[1:28:44] that I was going to get a ride home from
[1:28:46] were probably going to continue their
[1:28:48] routine. Let's go smoke out. And it's
[1:28:51] like, I don't do that. You guys go
[1:28:55] ahead. I'm going to be over here. And it
[1:28:58] starts to be like, man, so you really
[1:29:00] have changed, haven't you?
[1:29:04] Yeah, man. I I just, you know, I don't
[1:29:06] desire those things anymore. I love the
[1:29:08] Lord. He You don't understand what it's
[1:29:10] like to be changed. I wish you could
[1:29:12] have the same experience. You know,
[1:29:13] God's real. You can you can experience
[1:29:16] the love of Christ and it and once that
[1:29:18] becomes a reality, you recognize the God
[1:29:20] of this Bible has called for holiness
[1:29:22] and righteousness and he causes a
[1:29:24] separation for those things. I don't do
[1:29:26] those things anymore.
[1:29:28] But you can't
[1:29:32] show that until you've tapped in. So I
[1:29:36] this is twofold.
[1:29:38] If you've tapped in, make sure the tap's
[1:29:41] open when you come to the house of the
[1:29:43] Lord. Remember the grace that he's shown
[1:29:45] you. Remember what it was like to be in
[1:29:47] bondage. Remember the things that he set
[1:29:49] you free. You have a right to remember
[1:29:50] that. You should you should preface your
[1:29:53] praise by saying, "Lord, you're the Lord
[1:29:55] God of my deliverance. I remember you
[1:29:58] know what? You're the one who kept me. I
[1:30:00] know we talk about a lot about
[1:30:02] deliverance, especially coming from a
[1:30:04] place I have, but we were just
[1:30:05] fellowshipping today. You know what's
[1:30:07] the grace of God that keeps people?" You
[1:30:10] you might have the testimony. Say,
[1:30:11] "Lord, I look and I see the things that
[1:30:13] you've kept me from. And you should be
[1:30:15] the loudest.
[1:30:18] You should shout a little louder than
[1:30:20] me. If you I God, your grace has kept me
[1:30:24] from so much. You gave me a loving
[1:30:27] family. You gave me believing parents.
[1:30:29] You You allowed me to be in a place
[1:30:31] where I could come to church, where I
[1:30:32] could hear the truth, where I could hear
[1:30:34] the message. When there's many voices
[1:30:36] and many and so many things of
[1:30:38] confusion, you've allowed me to hear the
[1:30:40] voice of truth. I could know who you
[1:30:42] are. I'm not guessing if I'm praying to
[1:30:43] the father or to the son or to the holy
[1:30:45] spirit. I'm not confused about who you
[1:30:47] are. I know you're the Lord Jesus
[1:30:50] Christ. I know who I'm going to see.
[1:30:53] I You've declared yourself.
[1:30:57] The mysteries that a lot of people
[1:30:59] ponder at are made known by this
[1:31:01] message. If you get in and you look, the
[1:31:03] answers are there. It'll tell you
[1:31:05] exactly who you're going to see when you
[1:31:07] get to heaven. You don't have to only
[1:31:08] imagine.
[1:31:17] We need to get a little more revelation.
[1:31:20] We don't need to just be emotional. We
[1:31:22] need to really recognize what we've been
[1:31:24] given.
[1:31:27] We You've been given a word that is so
[1:31:29] amazing.
[1:31:31] So amazing. It is the grace of God to us
[1:31:34] that delivered us out of a modernday
[1:31:36] Egypt. We would be in such bondage to
[1:31:40] denominational deception and thinking
[1:31:43] all little little pieces. Well, I've
[1:31:45] confessed. I've confessed them before
[1:31:47] man, so I must be saved. No. Have you
[1:31:49] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:31:50] believed? There is not a mystery. Well,
[1:31:53] I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but
[1:31:54] does your experience line up with the
[1:31:56] word? Do away with experience. Back to
[1:31:59] the word. Don't tell me you have the
[1:32:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then live
[1:32:02] contrary to the word. If you can't
[1:32:03] subject yourself to it, there's a
[1:32:05] bastard child there that isn't
[1:32:07] withstanding correction, but I but I
[1:32:09] feel the presence of the Lord. Will you
[1:32:11] not accept the correction?
[1:32:15] We want to be able to be honed by the
[1:32:17] word of God.
[1:32:22] You know, the the ultimate source of of
[1:32:25] all of it is a it's a well of life
[1:32:27] that's springing up within our hearts.
[1:32:30] And that there's things that the devil
[1:32:31] wants to throw boulders on that channel
[1:32:34] and stop it up.
[1:32:36] And he he's he he's only got five
[1:32:39] channels, you know,
[1:32:41] and through your emotions, too. But he's
[1:32:44] going to come at your reasoning and your
[1:32:45] affection and your memory and your
[1:32:47] sense, right? So, he's going to come at
[1:32:50] you and he's going to try to hurt you.
[1:32:53] He's going to try to cause life
[1:32:54] experience. He's going to try to be able
[1:32:56] to bring things into your remembrance.
[1:32:57] And you have to say, you know what?
[1:33:00] I'm going to cast down reasonings and
[1:33:02] affections. I'm going to accept what the
[1:33:03] word of God says.
[1:33:06] He's not the author of confusion
[1:33:09] so I don't have to be confused on why
[1:33:11] I'm going through things. It can only
[1:33:14] work to my good.
[1:33:20] Let's just uh have the musicians come.
[1:33:42] Part of our testimony will always be
[1:33:44] where we've came from. Right. You know,
[1:33:47] when it one of the things when I think
[1:33:49] about the things that move me a lot of
[1:33:51] times is the people who I can look at
[1:33:53] are the ones I remember and wish they
[1:33:55] could have come out too.
[1:33:58] And it causes a sobriety. It causes a it
[1:34:01] causes a um I believe a heart condition
[1:34:05] that we all should have.
[1:34:07] You know, if it was the stoning of
[1:34:10] Stephen there, there your past and the
[1:34:12] testimony that God's given you is an
[1:34:15] important dynamic that
[1:34:18] allows you to have the testimony or the
[1:34:22] way you behave and order your steps now
[1:34:26] because of what you've been through.
[1:34:29] So it is okay to sit there and remember.
[1:34:33] It is necessary that you recall the
[1:34:36] grace of God to you
[1:34:39] in your worst.
[1:34:41] You should think of the times when you
[1:34:43] were a child and think of the things you
[1:34:45] did wrong and the things that and yet
[1:34:48] despite all of that
[1:34:51] he loved you
[1:34:54] and he had a grace for you
[1:34:57] and in that
[1:34:59] you you can recognize Lord did I forget
[1:35:03] what you've done for me I think of even
[1:35:05] brother Brandham at the diner when he
[1:35:08] walked in there and he saw that woman
[1:35:10] and she was sitting in the booth and he
[1:35:13] said it was a horrible scene. It was
[1:35:15] enough for the reaction of him to say,
[1:35:17] "God, why don't you just wipe this off
[1:35:20] the face of the earth
[1:35:24] and the Lord drew him aside and sure
[1:35:27] enough through that channel, through
[1:35:28] that gift, a vision broke and he saw
[1:35:32] blood
[1:35:34] around the entire world. It wasn't a
[1:35:37] limited atonement, but it was for the
[1:35:39] sins of the whole world.
[1:35:43] And it was a blood covering that every
[1:35:47] time something was done wrong, anytime
[1:35:50] something was said, all the sin that's
[1:35:52] going on.
[1:35:54] That's a blood covering that's good for
[1:35:56] everyone.
[1:35:58] Not just you,
[1:36:00] that's everyone has been paid for with
[1:36:02] that. That's right. For God so loved the
[1:36:05] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:36:07] son.
[1:36:09] It was it's he paid for the sins of the
[1:36:12] entire world so that anybody who wants
[1:36:15] to accept it can.
[1:36:18] That's the liberty and the grace that
[1:36:20] we've been given that the devil can't
[1:36:22] take away. He could take away a lot of
[1:36:25] things, but he can't take away that I'm
[1:36:26] forgiven. Come on. Oh my.
[1:36:30] Yes.
[1:36:31] He this world could dissolve but he
[1:36:33] can't take away that
[1:36:36] you've been made an able minister of the
[1:36:38] grace of God.
[1:36:40] You can give what this world can't. Come
[1:36:42] on. Amen.
[1:36:46] It's yours to give.
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] He's deposited in you a love that's
[1:36:54] greater than anything you could have
[1:36:56] ever known.
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:09] I believe that's here is love. Great is
[1:37:11] the ocean.
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:16] Let's just sing that.
[1:37:18] Great.
[1:37:23] Vast as the ocean.
[1:37:28] loving kindness
[1:37:32] as a flood
[1:37:36] when the prince
[1:37:40] of life are answered.
[1:37:44] Oh, he shed for us
[1:37:49] his preious blood.
[1:37:53] And who his love
[1:37:57] can I remember?
[1:38:01] Who can see? Who can see
[1:38:06] to sing his praise?
[1:38:10] Well, he will dance.
[1:38:13] never
[1:38:15] be forgotten.
[1:38:19] throughout heaven's
[1:38:23] eternal
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] on the mount
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:31] of crucifixion.
[1:38:36] Fountains old
[1:38:40] deep and wild
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:44] through the flood.
[1:38:49] S of God's mercy
[1:38:53] flows abound
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:57] and gracious tide.
[1:39:01] Grace and love
[1:39:05] like mighty rivers
[1:39:10] flowing
[1:39:11] [Music]
[1:39:14] from above.
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:18] Heaven's peace
[1:39:22] and perfect justice.
[1:39:27] Kiss a guilty
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:31] world in love.
[1:39:33] You know that's
[1:39:36] that actually kind of hits on something.
[1:39:39] We don't often want to be associated
[1:39:41] with the guilt.
[1:39:45] We don't want to admit it was our
[1:39:46] mocking voice that hung him there. We
[1:39:48] don't want to recognize it was our sin
[1:39:50] that put him on the cross. We forget
[1:39:53] what it's like to feel guilty.
[1:39:56] We forget what it's like to be the woman
[1:39:58] at his feet. That's what I'm trying to
[1:40:01] say, saints, is
[1:40:03] if we could be just so thankful for
[1:40:05] having the guilt taken away. I believe
[1:40:08] when we came into the house of the Lord,
[1:40:10] there would be such a atmosphere that we
[1:40:13] could see sinners saved.
[1:40:16] When we recognize what it if we can
[1:40:18] remember what it's like to be a slave to
[1:40:20] guilt and remember what it's like to be
[1:40:23] set free from it, then we could desire
[1:40:26] that to happen for someone else. What if
[1:40:29] someone here doesn't know what it's like
[1:40:31] to be forgiven?
[1:40:35] What if someone came into this house
[1:40:37] tonight thinking they weren't a
[1:40:39] candidate for the grace of God?
[1:40:46] They they're bearing the guilt
[1:40:49] and you can't recognize and identify
[1:40:51] yourself as someone that would wash his
[1:40:53] feet. But they're looking to you. You
[1:40:57] say you're one that's forgiven.
[1:40:59] You say you're you're one of the ones
[1:41:03] who could sing this song.
[1:41:05] Say, "I know what it's like to have been
[1:41:07] guilty. I know what it's like to be
[1:41:10] forgiven. But I really don't know how to
[1:41:12] show it. I don't know how to say thank
[1:41:15] you, Lord. It was me.
[1:41:17] I don't know how to tell you, Father. It
[1:41:19] was your grace that saved me when I was
[1:41:21] unlovable.
[1:41:24] Lord, help me show it. So that when
[1:41:26] someone comes, they can recognize I'm
[1:41:28] thankful. Yes.
[1:41:30] However it is, Father, just may I be
[1:41:32] able to show you that I'm thankful.
[1:41:35] Maybe it's silently in my heart. But may
[1:41:37] there be such an atmosphere around me
[1:41:39] that if I don't do anything to show it,
[1:41:41] they recognize this is the heart of a
[1:41:44] grateful, forgiven
[1:41:48] son of God.
[1:41:52] Let me all
[1:41:55] thy love accepting
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:00] love of the ever
[1:42:04] all my days.
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:08] Let me
[1:42:12] th
[1:42:17] and my life
[1:42:20] be to thy praise.
[1:42:25] Thou alone
[1:42:28] shall be my glory.
[1:42:33] Nothing in
[1:42:36] the world I see.
[1:42:41] Thou cleans.
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:48] Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] Thou set
[1:42:53] has set me free.
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:05] Oh,
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:10] grace through thy word
[1:43:14] and thy grace.
[1:43:18] My need is many.
[1:43:21] Oh, and as I trust,
[1:43:25] oh indeed my Lord,
[1:43:30] oh and faithful,
[1:43:33] fullness thou are pouring
[1:43:39] thy great love
[1:43:43] and bow on me.
[1:43:46] Oh, and we got
[1:43:51] full and botless
[1:43:56] drawing out
[1:43:59] my heart. Sing that first verse again.
[1:44:02] Oh, and here is love.
[1:44:07] I s the ocean.
[1:44:11] Oh, and loving God.
[1:44:16] and says of love
[1:44:20] when the gra
[1:44:24] of
[1:44:26] sound. Oh, and shed for us.
[1:44:31] Oh, he's precious for us. Oh, and who is
[1:44:38] just think about it tonight. But I
[1:44:42] remember.
[1:44:44] Oh, and who can sing
[1:44:48] to sing his praise?
[1:44:52] Oh, and evil
[1:44:55] for ages.
[1:44:58] Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] Oh, and through our
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] eternal
[1:45:07] state,
[1:45:09] where would I be?
[1:45:14] You all know.
[1:45:18] Oh, I'm glad you see
[1:45:23] through eyes of love.
[1:45:26] Oh, and a hopeless
[1:45:29] day.
[1:45:31] Oh, and an empty.
[1:45:34] Is that your testimony tonight?
[1:45:38] Oh, where would I be? Where would I be?
[1:45:45] You only know.
[1:45:48] Oh, I'm glad you see
[1:45:53] through eyes of love.
[1:45:56] Oh, and a hopeless king.
[1:46:01] Oh, and an empty place.
[1:46:05] Oh, we've done.
[1:46:08] Oh, amazing grace. Amazing grace.
[1:46:14] A sweet sound.
[1:46:18] I once was lost,
[1:46:23] but now I'm found.
[1:46:26] Oh, and a hopeless king. Oh, what an
[1:46:31] empty.
[1:46:33] Hallelujah.
[1:46:37] Oh, amazing grace. Amazing grace.
[1:46:44] How sweet the sound.
[1:46:47] Oh, and I was wonder.
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:55] Oh, what a hopeless king.
[1:47:00] Oh, and an empty
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] gra.
[1:47:08] Hallelujah.
[1:47:10] Where would we be if not for grace?
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:15] I tell you the greatest heart and
[1:47:18] I don't want to call it challenge, but
[1:47:21] whatever we ever do, we always feel like
[1:47:25] it falls short of what God has done for
[1:47:27] us. We could give ourselves every bit
[1:47:31] everything and it's still the only thing
[1:47:34] as a believer we seek for is just to
[1:47:37] show the appreciation for all that he's
[1:47:39] done for us. how he's protected us from
[1:47:43] children and you know perhap we done
[1:47:46] dumb things and stick our fingers into
[1:47:49] the wires and we could have died but he
[1:47:54] kept you safe and you were in sin and he
[1:47:57] he saved you and you were lost and they
[1:48:00] found you and and and to be gathered in
[1:48:03] his presence and to come to the
[1:48:05] knowledge of all of that. Oh my. There's
[1:48:08] no language that can express that love
[1:48:10] that we feel for him. That's why the
[1:48:13] scripture says we love him because he
[1:48:14] first loved us. All we ever want to do
[1:48:17] is just Lord, if I can express even just
[1:48:20] a tiny piece of my appreciation for the
[1:48:23] love that's gone, that's gone before me.
[1:48:26] The love that's protected us. I mean,
[1:48:28] the devil is a deceiver. The greatest
[1:48:30] deceiver that there is. I I tell you
[1:48:33] this, God has already paid the price for
[1:48:36] everything, all the sins of all the
[1:48:39] world. There is not a person on earth
[1:48:42] that that that is bound because God
[1:48:45] wants him to be bound. That's right.
[1:48:49] The price is already in paid. I like as
[1:48:51] our brother was speaking, even the
[1:48:53] children of Israel, you know, the the
[1:48:55] ice fellowship might quite some. It was
[1:48:58] by deception
[1:49:00] that they were kept there.
[1:49:02] Egyptian tried to show that, you know,
[1:49:05] we we have to deceive them that you have
[1:49:07] to do this and if you don't have a job,
[1:49:09] you're not going to pay your bills and
[1:49:11] if this happen, you're going to lose
[1:49:13] this and and you live by deception
[1:49:16] trying to balance everything around you
[1:49:18] all the time where God is looking at you
[1:49:20] and said, "I've set you free.
[1:49:23] I've set you free to worship me. I've
[1:49:26] set you free to to to live your life for
[1:49:28] me. I've set you free. There is no
[1:49:31] nothing can separate us from the love
[1:49:33] that is in the God that is in Jesus
[1:49:36] Christ. He's paid for all of that. So we
[1:49:38] can walk free.
[1:49:41] God don't want you to be bound. No, not
[1:49:44] for anything. If there's something, you
[1:49:46] bring it back to him and say, "Lord,
[1:49:48] your word said I'm free and and this is
[1:49:51] bothering me and I want to serve you. I
[1:49:53] want to be fully serving you with
[1:49:56] everything I have. I want my testimony
[1:49:58] to be clean and everything. And he's
[1:50:00] going to bring his word to come to pass
[1:50:02] in your life.
[1:50:05] We were not to be We are strangers in
[1:50:07] this world. We were not to be made
[1:50:09] bound. We were made to be free. Amen. Is
[1:50:12] that your heart desire tonight? Many of
[1:50:14] you desire prayer, come and you'll be
[1:50:17] prayed for. And I believe there's
[1:50:18] freedom in the house of God. We are not
[1:50:21] a bound people. We are free people. I
[1:50:23] love uh I believe it's Paul. He looked
[1:50:25] at gripper. He said, "I'm a free man
[1:50:28] except for this chains which is around
[1:50:30] me. I'm a free man. You can bound the
[1:50:32] natural man as much as you want. That
[1:50:35] I've been made free and whom the son has
[1:50:37] made free is free indeed.
[1:50:40] Walk in freedom that the Lord has made
[1:50:43] for you." Amen. Why don't we sing that
[1:50:46] song? I know we sang it not long ago. Uh
[1:50:49] why would I worry when uh when giant
[1:50:52] come following my name? Uh my Amen.

[1:50:57] it.

[1:54:37] valley to low. There's no field that I
[1:54:41] have. He doesn't already know. There's
[1:54:45] no power to me. There's no I can't.
[1:54:51] There is nothing for God that's
[1:54:54] impossible.
[1:54:56] Oh, there's no mountain to hide. No
[1:55:01] valley to hold. There's no fear that I
[1:55:05] have. He doesn't already know. There's

[1:56:23] you glad is bigger, better, stronger
[1:56:25] than than anything that the devil can
[1:56:28] bring. Amen. That how that that has to
[1:56:31] bring peace in your heart to know that
[1:56:33] whatever you're going through, you can
[1:56:35] take it to him and he will give you an
[1:56:37] answer. Amen. Brother Andrew, if we
[1:56:39] could just come and dismiss us. Amen.
[1:56:42] Amen. And I really enjoy that. Amen.
[1:56:44] That's what the word of God does to you.
[1:56:46] You come all beaten up and you know seem
[1:56:49] like you were in a car accident and then
[1:56:51] you come in the word in the house of God
[1:56:53] and God fixes you up and you know does
[1:56:56] an old change and you're ready to go out
[1:56:58] again and go fight. Amen. Amen. Blessed
[1:57:02] be the name of the Lord. God bless you.
[1:57:05] I certainly can identify with that. You
[1:57:08] know, it's like sometimes if you have
[1:57:10] something a device or like you're
[1:57:12] scrolling or you need an update or an
[1:57:14] app or something like that. And that's
[1:57:16] really what the grace of God has done
[1:57:18] for us is, you know, we're saved by
[1:57:21] grace through faith. So, I needed to be
[1:57:24] here tonight to hear this. It's like
[1:57:26] when you get a new revelation, when God
[1:57:28] renews you and washes your mind, you get
[1:57:30] an update. There's there's something on
[1:57:32] the inside that we got to have the right
[1:57:35] attitude towards the word of God. I I
[1:57:37] had to be here tonight. I believe every
[1:57:39] single one of us had to be here tonight.
[1:57:41] God wanted to update the hardware on the
[1:57:44] inside. This love of God has got to cap
[1:57:46] this bride.
[1:57:49] Okay.
[1:57:51] Amen. You know, it's just uh we're going
[1:57:55] to read a prayer request. Brother
[1:57:56] Darien's asking prayer to pray for uh
[1:58:00] Helen and re for healing and restoration
[1:58:05] of uh
[1:58:09] uh cut I'm sorry come consciousness for
[1:58:14] sister Rachel
[1:58:16] Garisman
[1:58:18] in South Africa
[1:58:21] a restoration of consciousness I believe
[1:58:24] that's what it says for Rachel
[1:58:27] uh gaysman in South Africa. She has
[1:58:31] suffered a stroke and is in the ICU uh
[1:58:35] hospital and she's the mother of my
[1:58:39] friend
[1:58:40] NSA.
[1:58:42] You know, I believe that each one of us
[1:58:44] can touch him by the feeling of our
[1:58:46] infirmity. We can take this burden to
[1:58:49] heart and know that we can just touch
[1:58:51] because he's a high priest. Well, let's
[1:58:53] go. Let's go together believing.
[1:58:56] Heavenly Father, Lord, you see, oh God,
[1:58:58] our hearts, Lord, we we rejoice in the
[1:59:02] words that were spoken tonight, Lord.
[1:59:04] Lord, we feel like there's something on
[1:59:06] the inside that has been vibrating. We
[1:59:09] know that there's a change, Lord, that's
[1:59:11] coming, Lord. That great magnet is swept
[1:59:14] over tonight, Lord. And we believe it's
[1:59:16] you inside of us, Lord. And Lord, we
[1:59:19] know that you're present here. And Lord,
[1:59:21] we need help, oh God. this request. It's
[1:59:23] urgent, Lord. We've seen you time and
[1:59:25] time again when we come in unity of
[1:59:28] faith. Lord, the love of God to see this
[1:59:31] person that suffered a stroke. Lord, we
[1:59:34] just desire, oh God, that you would move
[1:59:36] on the scene on the hospital. Lord, give
[1:59:39] the doctor's wisdom. Give the nurse the
[1:59:41] touch. Oh God, whatever it is, Lord,
[1:59:43] bring the healing. Father, we know that
[1:59:45] you're the healer. And so we call upon
[1:59:47] your name. Lord, let it be a testimony
[1:59:49] that resounds out in the community to
[1:59:52] say that there's a living God in a time
[1:59:54] of need that will answer back to the
[1:59:56] heart's cry. Father, we just rejoice in
[1:59:58] your presence and your goodness. Father,
[2:00:01] as we commit ourselves, Lord, when we
[2:00:02] leave here, Lord, may we go a little bit
[2:00:05] lighter, Lord. Go a little bit closer to
[2:00:07] the kingdom, Lord. Grow in the grace, oh
[2:00:10] God, that was spoken, Lord, to love the
[2:00:12] neighbor, Lord. Father, help us, Lord.
[2:00:14] Give us, oh God, this great reality that
[2:00:17] we're crying out for. It's a craving,
[2:00:19] Lord. Lord, we pray your blessings upon
[2:00:22] every heart, Lord, as we leave here,
[2:00:23] Lord. May we rejoice and be glad in
[2:00:26] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:00:34] Amen. God bless you. You are dismissed
[2:00:36] KFD. Amen.
