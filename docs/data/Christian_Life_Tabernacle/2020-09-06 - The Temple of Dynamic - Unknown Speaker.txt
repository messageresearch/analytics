it's given us life amen and amen the scripture says we've received life and life in abundance amen just not a little bit but in abundance amen let's open our bibles to do scripture reading tonight we went into communion service we try not to try not going to be too long uh just to say a few words to comfort us i mean genesis chapter one we're going to read verse the second verse it says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters amen let's also turn in luke chapter 4 and verse 16. look the fourth chapter in verse 16. it says and he came to nazareth where he had he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and he stood up for the read for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and to recove and recovering of sight to the blind to set to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he began and and and he again and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all of them in the synagogue were fastened on him that's just my head a gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence father your word is wonderful we love it lord we thank you for speaking to us this morning father now we just want to speak a little bit on what's on our heart and pray that you could just take it and multiply it lord you know that you know that you took the fish and you multiply it took the bread and multiply it we know that everything we laid in your hands father you have the ability to multiply therefore we pray father that you just take your word and speak to our hearts tonight because we have need of you we love you and ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen i have your seats just for a few moments i just stressed i could bring what's on my heart and this is really moved upon me on what our pastor preached this morning and perhaps as i go you'll see a lot of similarities and and i just trust that something could be said that could just go together with what was said this morning because i believe it's the word of god amen and so i want to just just for frame a reference i want to title this um in the uh the temple of the dynamic the temple of the dynamic and and almost for a subject as jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me in in you as we read this was in luke chapter four this is was right after he he was uh taken in the wilderness by the spirit of the lord after he was baptized and taken into wilderness to be tempted and after he was tempted and of the the the the devil for 40 uh when he was in the wilderness he came back this is after the temptation he comes and now he's beginning his ministry he's beginning to set and the first thing he comes and he tells them the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me so he he recognized that he was the anointed one of that time he comes to a place where he's actually recognizing that i have been anointed to do this and and and i'll say this just to begin that as we read in genesis chapter 1 that god does the way that god brings his word to pass is by his spirit anointing is by his spirit moving is by spirit fulfilling something and and as we'll just look we'll go through the bible and begin to realize these things as it is written but random speaks in the message identify masterpiece of god it says now when he made adam that first man how perfect he was he looked uh he said he looked like god the great holy spirit brooding over the earth and the bird came out and then the animal different things it kept coming more in the form of one that was that that was brooding so it start with the bird and then it comes all the way into the form of the one who was actually doing the brooding and and so this is god in the beginning he it was his spirit that caused all of that to move and burton tells us that that that that it was the seed he was brooding over the sea that was already planted the seed was already under the water so as god is brooding it was the holy spirit bringing his word to come to pass what was spoken one time god is now bringing it to come to pass and the way he did it it was by his spirit moving and causing it to come to pass and so he continues on until he finally they came a a species just exactly like one that was doing the rooting god it says man was made in the image of god then he placed him in the great garden like michelangelo he placed his great life work and the great sculpture god placed his handiwork in the garden of eden made him a help meet a complete satisfaction it was what a complete satisfaction it was of god till even he rested it says it was just a rest his work had been finished so now he is showing us and it's important we begin to realize that it as the brooding is going forth is starting from something small until it comes into the image of the one that's doing the brooding the holy spirit within our lives as we receive it is to start from something small it's to start from a conviction is to start from a thirst in it to start from wherever we are from not liking the things of the world and and get away from where we are and move us into another place and but the the objective is not so we can stay in that condition uh and but branham says this will read it it says well the holy spirit was not given just so we can say we we're not like the world and and it's not given just so we can stop and say i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do this that's not the measure that god desired and our pastor said this morning that god wants to give us more and we just want to look up on the more that he wants to give us but the goal that god has in mind was so that the one who's doing the brooding could be manifested fully in the brooding of the sea that is brooding up that in the one that is bringing up will be nothing more than his representation into the image of the one that is brooding is trying to bring us back into the very image of god from the seed that we are he would brewed and brewed and brewed until we become any even in his very image david said in the in the psalms it says that that many comes to you and they they get what they want and you you feed the hungry it says there are many of you the people of the world it says the the sons you give them food and you give all of the things but it says as for i i want to stay in your presence until i become even like you reflecting the very desire that we see the prophet say here the one who's doing the brooding wants to see himself in the image of what is brooding in a message you must be born again it continues on it says now the holy spirit has never left the earth still on the earth he's talking about even today the holy spirit has never left the earth is still on the earth what is the holy spirit doing on the earth it says it's still on the earth it's still brooding over the earth coming on come unto me ye that are labored and have heavy heavy laden all you material that has been built in the image of god cooing calling and wooing what is it doing you we we here as the church and the body of christ representing the material of god that has been placed in this time and the holy spirit is here to take off that material and to bring it in the image of the one who's doing the brooding the body of christ was not given so he could be an image of something else it was given so he could be the very image of christ himself reflected within his body so he says now it continues on it says if the holy spirit is whose he says we come back right and say yes great god uh you you made me and i love you and you are my creator and i'm sinful i'm ashamed of it it says then he places in in me eternal life it says then if he gives me eternal life by answering by by answering back to his call and made me what i what i am without having a choice how much more can you raise me up after i've made my choice and been filled with the holy spirit the holy spirit is god's own life and you can no more lose that life than god can lose himself it's god's own life and he's trying to represent himself in you and the only way he does it is by spirit the only way he wants to do it is by his spirit moving upon the believer moving upon his seed so he can bring his seed into the very image of himself and then he says then if you give me eternal life by answering back it says and made me without be having my choice how much more you will raise me up if i've made my choice to fill me with the holy spirit the holy spirit is god's own life you can do more you can do no more that god can lose himself the word comes from the greek zoe and i it says i give unto you unto them eternal life so i begin to to think about just how in the scripture as the the scripture tells us about how many times we look in the old testament and we see examples of the spirit of god moving and and we know the prophet told us that there's no such thing as a holy man it's god the holy spirit in the man that makes a man holy there's no such thing as a holy church it's god in the church that makes it holy in other words it's always god doing everything and i began to think about samson the description that the prophet gave him and said it's not a man that you could have looked and attributed all the strength that he had and he seemed like it was a mama's boy or a a sister boy and one that was just a skinny one with long hair and things like that and and and and and the problem today is men's understanding or denominational the intellect of man has printed samsung into this great man and huge and talented and strong who was able to do all those things by himself but the prophet gives us a perfect description he says if you looked at him and the things that he did it never matched [Music] it never matched he looked at him and he said it was such a skinny boy and a zucchini man and but then when the spirit of the lord came upon him then he was to be able to do the things that he was doing when the spiritual of the law descended upon him that's when it took the the jawbone of a mural something that could have been broken up just by hitting anything and barbara says it will take that and hit the metals and after metals and kill a thousand philistine something that was supernatural something that you could not attribute it to the flesh and then when the spirit of the lord left him he became a man just like any other man you could look at him he was without strength without anything what did what he did it was the spirit of the lord moving upon him that caused him to do those things and i want to say this because it's important what we desire as a body of christ even as a herd i i don't believe we we live at any time where we need any more mechanics i believe we have enough mechanics they everything that the messenger told us about the word of god we know we've heard it and we'll believe it and we know all the things that he said what we need above all is the spirit of god to move upon that word and make it a reality for each and every one of us what we need is the manifestation the prophet tells us that god uh interpret his word by bringing it to pass in other words when you see the manifestation is the very interpretation of what was in god's mind about this word so what we need in order to have to see the interpretation is for the same spirit to move in genesis the same spirit that move upon samson the same spirit that moves upon david we need that same spirit to move upon us to bring us into a condition where we can manifest the word of god for our time we go too much after the mechanics and we're like oh i've never seen this before oh i love this and this is wonderful and that's good but don't stop there you move until the lord will move his spirit so you can say like jesus tonight and say the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring up this word and to live this world to manifest it to bring it to pass i am the manifestation of the word of god for this generation and and and the the mechanics will not do it it takes the dynamic to bring us into that place that's why we need to kick out the trash and we need to pray more we need to forgive more we need to have the love of god within our hearts we need all those things why because those things are moving us from the mechanics into the dynamics of the world that's been promised if it's clogged up there's no way we can get to the mecha to the dynamic all we'll have is the mechanic and i feel like sometimes we're so happy with the mechanics that we have because we can see this we can see this but let's not stop there let's move to a place where god will take that mechanic and bring the dynamics to bring it to pass i'll pass you away this morning how that god that we can go into hospitals and touch the people and raise them in and i'm not talking about just going to do all kinds of miracles i'm talking about being led by the spirit of god where god places on upon your heart you have love for somebody and you can't stand there to watch them suffer and you call upon the name of the lord and he moves upon your heart to god do and you do according as he's shown you that's the time that we're living in so when yeah he he moved and and he came and he moved upon david and david believed he was anointed and and i'll say this even for the prophet that came and anointed him he didn't look like he was the guy for the job they came and they brought one after another and the scripture says he looked and said it's got to be that one it wasn't the second one came in yeah you know if he wasn't that one it could be that one it wasn't not until his all the sons came by and the prophet came there and he said if god spoke to me there's got to be somebody they were at the place where they just wanted anybody is there anybody else left it says well there's one who's over there and he's watching after the sheep and everything he said go call him at this point we just need somebody i tell you it's not our presentation or ability to do anything it's not our strength or by our might why we have to come into the realization is if god can use a mule if god can speak to a donkey if god can do those things that god can use you oftentimes because our order is we always at the very bottom and that's okay even at the very bottom god is able to use you so he can bring his word to come to pass david showed up and it wasn't exciting when it showed up and the lights and the sky open it just came up and they looked at him they said well we're going to try and as they did the glory of the lord manifested they knew it was him but what happened afterwards he went back doing what he was doing he went right back he didn't go back over there and no wonder perhaps he was asking himself i've just been anointed king but i'm still a shepherd here i'm still watching after sheep i should be at least to have one of my older brother come watch and say because i'm the king no he went exactly back to where god placed him why because he knew that he has been anointed he knew that wherever god would place him god wanted him to be there he was satisfied not by what was outside but what was done within his heart we need to come to a place where it's not the outside that satisfies us what satisfies us is the presence of the lord within our heart is when we get to a place where god is me to me that's why i'm here god has done this for me that's why i'm doing what i'm doing so he comes in and he knew he was the king and there was one day he got told to just take food to his brother that was at war and there he comes in he's bringing food to his brothers and they stuck over there and all of them scared of this goliath and the whole kingdom the whole military might and all the trained people and all of them just sitting there wondering what's going to happen and how there was just the last day and all of him just come to realize that we we just there's no way we confess this person and he showed up and the anointing began to work and the anointing began to work and i want to say this god will lead you in a situation where that anointing will come upon you for you to act it's not given so we can just go and say i'm anointed i'm anointed i'm anointed but when a situation arise something within you will tell you this is the time that you need to take control this is what you've been anointed for and you've been anointed for you to bring forth the word of god and he stood up and he said i have been made king he remembered what happened that day and he knew that in the position that god gave him that it was absolutely impossible for him to die unless he was sitting on the throne so he says because he has anointed me but one of them speaks about moses he says that moses was born a proper child and and and i want to use this because this is such a type of us even today um he grew up and they told him about how he was born and and how that they put him in a a a in a basket and they they they put him up on water and and all the things that has happened to him so all of those things and prabhupada says that everything that i told him it drew the picture for him in other words his parents told him about his birth and and how he was a proper child and how that he was saved and how that he was born for a certain purpose all of those things were the mechanics that was laid out before him and we we also realized that he tried to act upon that mechanic and he failed amen and the prophet tells us that when we see the things that we see today we see the world in the condition that we see today we we we have been given an eyesight for us to see the reveal word of the hour we've been called we heard our name we don't believe this message intellectually something within our hearts is responding to this message so all the mechanics are in place we could say but that's not enough it takes the dynamic to come off the word that we have believed so he can bring all of the promises just like he did in the beginning in other words it takes the dynamic to come and quicken every promise that has been uh uh a lot of for us for this generation that's how we come into it it's not a uh well you know we and i can say this uh we've we've seen our salvation in it that's wonderful we've received deliverance for it that's wonderful but that's not it that's not the end of it we've seen the healing from it that's not the end of it remember pravanam says that this uh uh uh seven seals or this quickening power that comes at the end time is to take us from where we are and to bring us into rupturing faith so we're going to go from here to there by quickening every single promise along the way the holy spirit quickening it to us so we can get into that condition what is in the messages it is it is the rising of the sun it says it says if the spirit that raised christ from the dead the word the dynamic it says the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body now it says now how we flesh uh how now are we flesh of his flesh and bone of his born because because quickly he says because quickly while we are here mortal uh sinners and mortal ready to die these bodies it's quick and it's quickened that body what what's quicken bring to life the spirit that once liked to drink run around commit adultery and these things it's quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected you are resurrected it quickened your body it continues on and it says therefore your body is the temple of the dynamic your body is the temple of your dynamic and that's what i want to speak on tonight i want to say this my brother my sister we were not made for us to be sinners we were not made for us to remain in the things of the world god didn't create us so we could be just like the world he created and he chose a special group of people so his dynamic could come and manifest themselves in their bodies and and and we have to believe that we have to come to a place where we come to the realization that i have been made to be the temple for the dynamic it says why because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanic you were made part of the mechanic and i want to say this when we see our our election where we see how it's brought us together we see what is taking us from sin and all those things if we see how it saved us how we sanctify us how is what it's done for us so far we say we take all the things that he's done for all but it says we are able to draw the picture together and be able to see that there's something at work god has been doing something it's opened my eyes to see something it's done something for me and i'm not what i used to be the desires have been taken off and all those things why he's making you a temple for his dynamic and then he says that's part of the mechanic and they and they there's your resurrection they there is in the church there is there's the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened you've you've heard you believe it change you from denomination unto the word and i want to say this it's the resurrection power that begins the very rapture within your heart yes the rapture begins by the new birth why because it's taking you as we said in genesis is coming to that little sea that was in the uh in the ground and it begins to quicken it he's quickening it his quickening is quickening what what is he quickening unto is quickening unto so you can become in the very image of who he is so you can see yourself the same as he is what was the purpose of quickening power it's not so we could just say i've received quickening power and i don't love the world anymore the quickening powers come to you so it can manifest the works of jesus christ in you so he speaks on and he says he says the dynamic it comes upon it says the dynamic if it comes upon the water it will just splatter the days of miracles are passed pom pom pom and i believe the bible pom pom pom but that's just no problem he says but when he hits a thousand octane it says zoom away she goes see you see how it says the dynamics strike that but if it strikes a chicken it won't do no good because there's nothing to quicken there's nothing to quicken in the chicken it says but when it strikes an ego it moves out amen the dynamic with a mechanic see what i mean that's it it's the if the true ego uh it says if it is the true ego he will understand so he says let me say something to the uniting time to see the church united nations united the uniting time of god and his bride too it says i say this with reverence and respect i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she's sealed into the kingdom and i believe the mechanics are there now i want you to again to to come to the realization of what the prophet is laying out as the mechanic i believe that she's called i believe that she's still i believe the mechanics are there and then he says the mechanics are there it says they are waiting for the dynamic that will take her off the earth into glory in the rapture i believe that it will i believe that with all my heart yes sir we don't know how it will it was going to do but he shall do it he is the dynamic we just become members of of the of the machine of his body forming ourselves into the image and see him unite himself with us and his work and his love gift and and his and and his hands and he hands them to us just before the wedding supper we are waiting and watching for that the dynamic of the church will be the revealing of the holy spirit that the holy spirit that we have to work that it that we have worked in a small measure while we are while there is the headstone coming down to unite with a body but when the head and the body unites together the power of the full of the power the full power of the holy ghost will rise up exactly like that even from even the dead that's dead in christ 400 years or ago will rise in the beautiful or in the beauty of his holiness and take flight into the sky the dynamic is the holy spirit now i i just want to say this the the the mechanics part of it is our our place of us to play is the pushing that we have to do it's the best thing that we have to do is the repentance that we have to repent is the moving out of the things of the world it's by desiring the right things it's by applying the token is by forgiving one another it's by moving into the things that he has allow us to do that's the mechanic part of it because god will not come to a place where there's condemnation so he wants us to move out of condemnation he move on to move out of uh fussing and and fighting and all those things where we can get into the unity no wonder why the prophets say often and often he says oh if we can come under one mind under one accord he says there will not be a sick person in our midst in the next minute why because it's the unity that breaks the dynamic to come and work in the body it's the unity that brings the dynamic to work in the body in the message the anointed one uh i'm sorry perfect faith he says watch now he has appeared to us the same in the same form as it did to them in the old testament and in the same as in the new testament as is shown by the same word the same christ and i declare to you that christ is the holy ghost the word christ means the anointed just as the person is anointed just that it says that's the person that's anointed that is christ the anointed one how many knows that's the truth he says anointed one there is to be a man that would be anointed anointed with what the bible says in acts chapter 2 that jesus and nazareth the man of proof of god anointed with the holy spirit went about it and done great works and things that god manifested and proved he was he was this man and then he continues on he says and now we we become anointed with the same spirit anointed messiahs after last day to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show that he is not dead but is in the form of the holy ghost is in his people moving among his bride with a love afraid to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one with for the wedding supper and the same signs and promised by the same god and the same word is making his same manifestation there is nothing left for us to do but to believe but to believe it and believe it is the substance that creates a perfect faith it's the substance that creates perfect faith when we believe in this union when we come to a place where we know that we are anointed when we come to a place where we begin to manifest we let this dynamics come upon this temple that we are the scripture says that don't you know that your body is the temple of the holy spirit what is it it's god anointing you so you can move into it and i want to say this oftentimes you know we speak about the holy spirit coming and the holy spirit and receiving the holy spirit and sometimes it's left mysterious where people get into a place where do i have it don't i have it how do i get it i thought i had it and i don't have it and all those things and i want to just say this tonight the holy spirit can only come to the seed it's no question brahmanam says that in fact in the last day it says that that the holy spirit is here hunting for those who are predestinated before the foundation of the world can you get it god is wanting to give you so bad more than you desire it why because it's his word it is anointing it's his power he wants to manifest himself into you but madame says this he speaks about christ it says that all the program of god dwelled in him who was the anointed one and i want to say this all of the plan of god the same as it was in christ is rested upon those that have received this quickening power why because the quickening power does the same as he did in christ it does into the bride what was the holy spirit given for god wants to show this generation that he's alive he wants to show this world that he still lives he has work to do but he cannot do it in the body of jesus christ he has a body of people in the last day that he promised it will pour the scripture says that all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ it poured into church we got caught up in what measure and everything and i want to say this we've been told that the ocean is spoonful will do exactly what the cub can do and i want to say this when we put our liquid fire together you take your measure you give it to that one measure we put that one measure together we put all of that together it comes into a size where god will allow us to do what he wants us to do as a body he cannot do in christ something different than the bride it cannot be in christ christ becomes the part of the whole plan of god and gets in us and do something different when he gets into us he makes us he makes us part of his plan it says now he says he says now that is true god called messiahs god called us and we become kings and priests unto god just like jesus was the high priest we become a last priest jesus he says god god in fullness dwelled in christ dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of god to the world for god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself god was god come into his church and anoint him and anoints him some messiahs some messiahs oh do you see it it says the same thing he did with us we he did in his he did he did is in his church the same power he had in his church his church becoming his dominion and he's the king over this dominion we are the king and priest offering spiritual sacrifices to god the fruits of our lips giving praise to his neck to his name oh it says amen oh my he says they were messiah messiah little messiah little anointed ones anointed one of what the main one the main anointing of that great one it says who do you who do you say this is give me a church that's so completely anointed with god till they everything acts their every action and move is that say of the lord walk in the shekinah glory and i'll show you a messiah it's it's that giving into him it's that dying to ourselves now you know we say oh we're waiting on this the scripture but says over and over again god who's god is waiting on you and i that's right so is it god waiting on us or is this us working on waiting on god see the enemy always wants to bring the confusion oh god i need this oh god i need this but random talks about moses it says moses was grown a proper child god laid everything he came into the dynamic he says he had the mechanics he was being told and he seen it in a word and he knew that there were to be out of the bondage and everything and then his dynamics is when he came to the burning bush it came and the dynamics came upon him but him says in the message the third accident if i'm not mistaken it says he says that when he says that god went into the form of moses so the dynamic came and he dwelt into the body so he comes and now he's before the red sea after all that god had done but when it says what was his action he says just like us humanly oh god can you come now i need you to speak i need you to show me what should i do what should i do what should i do and by the scripture but what i'm saying he says god must have been fed up with him yes sir he says speak the word and go forward it was anointed for the job that's the purpose of his creation was so he can do what he was doing the purpose of your creation is so you can hear this word and manifest it so he says and then he says one place it says uh moses wanted just to be pushed every time god will come in and move him to another move him to another and then push him from here and push him there and push him there but in the adoption hearing him we heard it this morning god is looking for sons and daughters that have understood the position they know what they're here to do they know what they've been anointed to do they know what they've been called they're about the business of the father so they come into a place where what they desire is the desire for the father what they what they would like to see is what their father wants in other words they are connected to this kingdom that what their father just like adam in the beginning out of name animals and the scripture says when god looks at it it says that's wonderful that's wonderful why because the mind of the father was transferred to the sun and the revealing of this word brings a quickening power while the mind of god has been revealed to us if we can move within our mind nothing will stand in our way and if something's done we have been given the power we have been given the holy spirit to call upon the holy spirit so he can come on the same and move on our behalf speak the word how are you going to speak the word because i'm connected to the father because what i desire is the father's desire what i want is to see the father manifested it's not me it's the father living in me ultimately the sun all the sun becomes it's just the father in another form ultimately the sun becomes the father in another body why because it's the pure spirit of the father that dwells within the sun he talks like the dad he walks like that he thinks like that he has the same love the same compassion the same everything how are we gonna get there if we're still fast if we're still mad at each other if we can't see clearly if we can't get off the things of the world if we can't clean up if we can apply the token how are we going to get there and that's why the tutor has been sent so he can walk us through the truder is the quickening power that will come and show you this is not the business of the father this is what the father wants you to do you do wrong the holy spirit convicts you what is he doing he is quickening you and tutoring you so you can come into that fullness god has not called us so we can just say we are saved oh that's what pentecostal did that's what they did they got gifts and they jumped up and they want everybody to be that way and that's the end of it god has called us for something different we have been called for the full manifestation the headstone has come the the love of god has been descended and we have received it and the desires of the father is the desire of the bride what's the purpose of the mechanics if there are no dynamics it's just so we can share with one another more mechanics so today we can use these words to describe one thing and then use the same different words to describe the same thing that's the curse of denomination they desired no part of the power they were happy with what they had in fact how how can a real believer say that the days of miracles are passed how can you say that and i will say well that's the nomination but i wonder how many of us when things happen how do we like our parents would even describe this morning we run into and god is the last thing we go to and i mean we show up crawling like crawling it's like at the last breath oh god in egypt where we have been called to be placed to be sons to be daughters to be the ones the continuation of the kingdom to be representative of the kingdom to be the mind of the father revealed to the word to have all these things with us it says he says now the word was made fleshed and manifested in him he was the complete anointed it was the complete anointed one it says they had it by partial they're headed by portions we are we have it by portion but it was the entire uh plan of god laid in him god planned before the foundation of the world to redeem the laws was in him he was that word and he still is the word the same yesterday today and forever remember he can he can do he came to the father through the prophets and made himself known through the prophets and then in the last day through the son jesus christ he was made manifest it's the same plan if god desired to save the sins the sinners in jesus christ god desired to save the sins in the bride the sinners in the bride if god desire to heal in jesus christ god desires to heal and arrive if god desires to deliver in jesus christ the same god desire to deliver in the bride it's the same continuation there's no stopping it's the same god moving where is he moving into is moving into the very image of who he is like a prophet talks about that the gold the one who works on the goal he will beat it and they will beat it they will work the gold until they see the very reflection in the gold and i believe that's what god is doing with us he's looking for his respection he's not looking for personality personality has nothing to do with this men have turned this gospel into personality and style of preaching and this and man and then oh i like the style i like when this one does this i like this you're missing the point of what god is trying to achieve god is not interested in man this gospel was not said so man can take it and take ownership of it and become the revelator this was sent so god can speak to his sons and daughters so they can manifest christ we get lost into people they pull us here and this one pulls here this one interprets it this way that one contradict that one and now we don't know it we're waiting so who's going to say what and how they're going to further explain it god brings his word by bringing it to pass that's his interpretation he says it with a messenger i want it i want to see it just like it says it i'm not interested in men's and explanation i want the dynamic that smoke that word to come within me and make the world a reality to me those are the people that are going in the rapture as long as you're still caught up within man you loosen it god wants you back into the fall look to him look to him who jesus christ the author and the finisher of our faith he will start and will finish it he will spoke to what he'll make it to come to pass i don't care if you don't understand it you just believe it and he will bring the interpretation he will bring the understanding he will bring everything that you have need of amen it says this it says if i say the spirit of john dillinger was in me i'd have gun and be an outlaw it says because that's being a nature and that's being natural and if i said the spirit if i put my life of the life of pumpkin in a in us in a in the uh vine uh a grape vine it will bear pumpkin it says sure it's the life that produces it put the life into an apple tree and it will it into put the life of an apple tree into a pear tree it will bear apples because the life it's the apple life in the tree and and i want to say this this is by no means a condemnation far before it this is to bring us to a place where we begin to seek the life the appropriate life that we need to bring if i'm not bringing the spirit of christ if i'm not manifesting the life that comes with the spirit of christ i want it right we're here this is what as long as we're still breathing and live a year it's a space a time for us to do the right thing to move into the right thing he didn't say this as a condemnation and so you can go and say oh i must have a different life no if i don't have it i want it i'm looking for it god i want that manifestation and i don't care who laughs at me or who thinks whatever i tell you at the last day there's not gonna be laughing people will be crying and screaming and all kinds of things i want one is giving me a chance today it says today when you hear your voice his voice i'm not your heart today i heard his voice and i'm screaming our father i want your life not anybody else's life i don't want some preacher's life i don't want some pastor's life i want the life of christ living within me so i can manifest the fruits of christ oftentimes we take it and we flip it around oh i'm doing wrong i must know is there something within you that wants to do right if there is the city is there just call for the dynamic to come just pray so he can send the dynamic you didn't figure out this message by yourself you didn't come up to the conclusion that this is true that was the mechanic that he put in there just call upon the dynamic to confirm that mechanic that already lies in there amen he says and all that was in christ he poured into his church anointed one to continue the work that his word might live constantly that his word might live constantly if it's not on earth how is he going to live constantly he's going to live constantly by a group of people who have received his word and they are manifesting his spirit constantly that's how the holy spirit is not in the air it's not stuck up in the air and finding out am i gonna land am i gonna no the holy spirit is in the people to manifest christ it's here to manify is he here where in the people but what was in god important to christ as far as i'm concerned when he moved from christ it went into the people that's what the scripture says it says that that the word might might live constantly he lived by the word of the father men shall not live by the bread alone but everywhere that proceedeth after the mother god the church don't live by bread alone but by the word of christ the holy spirit comes in it and takes the words of christ and make it live action today these signs shall follow them that believe it says oh brother give me a church full of holy ghost god will do in one year what all theologian failed to do in 2000 years you wait until that anointing of the church really strike home to that faithful little remnant after the door of the gentile is closed oh god will anoint the church then you will announce a church then who's filthy will let him be filthy still who's righteous let him be righteous still who's holy let him be right holy still and god will anoint this church with the power of god and things will take place not only then but there he's doing it now he's doing it now we need to move into it we need to come to a place where we desire these things yes we want to see these things and in closing i know we have communion tonight i'll just jump quickly and close here i'll read one more and then get to a close it says it says the kingdom of god is the word of is the kingdom of god is his word made power if you want to put it down write the first uh first corinthians 4 and 20 the kingdom of god is word is god's word made power what is what is the kingdom of god is within you kingdom is in you god's word comes in there what does he do what does he what does this word begin it turns itself into power the word attains itself into power making it say exactly what he said what he said you say you say you can't say it it says it it's it says it it says this and make it work so it speaks and then it makes it work you've got to say the same thing as it says to make a confession not saying well it's polished and a little here and more wisdom and then i'll better stand over here you stay with the word there it is and he makes it power jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever jesus says in saint john 14 and 12 if you abide in me and my words abide in you i beg your pardon it wasn't he said he said he said it there but he said he if he that he he that believeth in me the works that i do shall it do also if you abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will and it shall come unto you if you abide in me and my words in you it's the constant abiding i want to close with this i was thinking about elisha or elijah on the mount carmel it came and it was such a time of confusion and the scripture says that it came to israel and it says that if baal be god and says then worship him if god be god let's worship him let's not get caught up between two opinions and i feel like oftentimes we are caught up between intellect and dynamic is it inalight is it dynamic sometimes we go by you know and then we'll say no it's not it we go back to the dynamic and then we it says if don't be caught up between the two now i want you to realize what he did here so he said that that the god who's god he will answer by fire by the dynamic the the true gospel of god always has a dynamic attached to it the true god the creator of heaven and earth he never sent his word and let you figure it out and let you try to find it yourself like the prophet of baal he made fun of him and says perhaps he didn't hear you you got to scream out louder it wasn't in the screaming and they scream and they run around and they cut themselves and create a source of urgency and did all of those things and nothing happened and you know why elijah was sitting right there when he came the first thing he done is he prepared the altar what is the altar is the mechanic is the word because the holy spirit can only move upon the word so once he had the word ready he knew that god will come and vindicate his word and i want to say this how many times the messenger in this last day he said if what i spoke to you if what i say to you is the word of god then he will come and vindicate it it's not for men to try to prove anything it's if it's the word of god god will come and vindicate it if what you believe is the message god will come and predicate it there's a dynamic always attached to the word to prove that what you believe is a reality so he comes in and he did it according to the word of the lord so he comes and he tells them and they do all that they can and everything and and all they lay all the intellect that nothing happened and the scripture says by the evening time elijah knew that the time was getting closer it just let them run and let them run when the evening time was done it says i think now you guys have run out and that's what pentecost has done they've screamed out and put out all the gifts and cut themselves and think it was by the sacrifices of man and done all that they could and what did it produce nothing why did he produce nothing then this little old just small guy and just not not greater stature just a little man and jesus just came and stood there and he took the first thing he done is he prepared the altar he took all the loose hands and he put it together he took what they left out and what the method is left out the baptist and the precipitation and all he laid all together and he knew by doing that by preparing the word that god will vandicate his word because why that's what he told him and he comes and delays the altar and it says that if god be god let him come and answer by fire and to prove that it was not the works of man he says poor water they pull back it after bucket off the bucket perhaps they say well there was a little wind that blew up and caught fire there was this he wanted to absolutely prove that this is not by any works of man this is god in action and i want to say this my brother my sister for us to see god in action let's believe the word let's kick out the trash let's prepare the altar let's lay on that altar let's die to ourselves and let's give ourselves all that we are let's not build some bridges other places let's cut loose of everything i tell you that's the church that will manifest the messiahs of the last day why because god will move upon her amen god bless you amen amen that's what i've been trying to say i just can't say it as good as billy and you believe that that's what we want and we've got to do our part and we and that's what we said that we've got to have that tutor we've got to have that spirit come we've got to have them start cleaning our lives we've got to start looking for it you're not going to see it if you don't look for it prophet god said if you come critical to criticize something you'll find something to criticize if you come looking for that dynamic power to start coming into the church it'll come and there's something that that touched me that billy said that i wanted to send that and let it really sink in your heart good he said when you looked at samson and you looked at the outside and you looked at the physical and then you looked at the work they didn't match now if big john meal here lifted up something you could understand that he's a big strong man you know but if some little skinny guy comes along and does it it don't match it's him if you look at yourselves you don't match you're you're you're not what the world would think was a church you're not what the world would think could have the power you don't have the education if you you you're just he didn't come to the rich of this world but he came to the those that were rich in faith the poor of this world when you start to look around and you see god elected you because you didn't match the ecclesiastical theory of what a christian would be he's the match he's the match to you because he created you and i think if we could get that courage and be encouraged and get our eyes off ourselves and our eyes on the prophet promise and that's what billy said when we can start to look to him we believe what he said right we believe what he said he's given us the automobile we own the automobile we go out there and we sit in the automobile and we say god gave me this autumn it's my automobile i could turn the key and it'll crank now what do you need to make it go you need that gasoline from heaven and that's what billy's saying to us tonight god put the gasoline in my tank i'm ready to go i'm ready to move to higher heights i'm ready to move to a more holy life i'm ready to move into service for you i'm willing we read that quote last week he says who's willing to say satan i've come to stand against you i've come to challenge you i've come to do it this is for me and this is where i believe the church is at and i loved how brother billy said the mechanics is there the tires are on the car he's done everything now lord send the gasoline of your holy spirit and that i i can make when i turn that spark in my heart it'll take me to my healing it'll take me to my deliverance and then when you start experience it for yourself then you know what he's done for me he'll do for others you know why i've always had a hope for a lost person no matter how lost they are or how dark they look because i came from a very deep dark place of sin darker than i can even express to you through my testimony i believe god plucked me out of hell and i was in the grips of satan and he took me out so i know in my heart that he can save any man no matter how deeply in sin they are now lord give me the love give me the gasoline give me the spirit to bring this to the dying world i'm about the father's business brother branham said i'm interested in the lost i'm interested in the sick and afflicted i'm interested in those that are in bondage and burdened and i want to bring this dynamics to them so i can show this world that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever church that's and billy read the quotes tonight that's what we're moving into it's not man we we finally got past we had before we could have a form a ladder rain we had to have a former rain a teaching rain pentecost thought they were the latter rain but they weren't because they didn't have the teaching rain to go with it and what did really billy share with this night of the holy spirit through billy shared with it that's why pentecost never turned into nothing but a bunch of screaming shouting hollering and they can only produce that when they're in their atmosphere but a believer that's got the power it don't matter if they're in the mud it don't matter if it's a rocky mountain it don't matter if it's a valley it don't matter if it's the desert they've got the gasoline that moves the mechanics and that's where we're coming to we don't need emotion to do it we need the person of jesus christ dwelling in us and that's what we're having communion with tonight let's stand together as the brothers go prepare the communion to bring it and we'll read this little portion of scripture found in the 11th chapter of corinthians i enjoyed that brother and like i told you i wish you that has turned your back to the audience and then they could have said the lord turned us back to the audience and just preached to me i'm telling you that's what my heart's burning for and i i i've seen it in the in the sermons that that he's been bringing us you know they've just been pieces of the puzzle to me you know preach on this preach on that preach on that and now i'm starting to see the picture come together didn't brother billy say that he says he shows you this in the world he shows you this and you see the picture shouldn't we see the picture coming together with the homosexuality shouldn't we see the picture coming together with the civil unrest in the streets shouldn't we see the picture come come together with the plagues and the virus shouldn't we see the picture come together with the earthquakes and the fires and and the floods and that they're having look just down on the coast when is the picture gonna come together that this is the time lord give me i sap that i might see the hour is here hallelujah let us read for i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this duty as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me don't you love like this cup is the new testament in my blood in other words me dying on the cross has brought to you this new testament and this revelation and i'll meet you under that shed blood every time do this as often as you dink in remembrance of me for often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of the cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup ask yourself is there a desire in your heart to commune with the lord even though satan's trapped you and made a lot of mistakes even though you've done things that you're ashamed of go past those things and look into your heart and say lord i want what i heard tonight i want this dynamic that i heard tonight that's why i'm coming to have communion not that i'm perfect but that i'm imperfect not that i haven't made mistakes but that i want the power that'll give me overcoming power amen and and and and for he says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged hallelujah and when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world therefore my brother when you come together deter to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come let us pray our heavenly father or we carry one for another lord our church has never been in times like this seems like it's just the civilization itself is trying to rip us apart trying to take believers out and making it difficult father we've got real christian saints that are out there ministering to those that are by this virus they call it that's affecting the elderly we've got real christian women and men that are they're helping every day and we ask you to protect them lord we ask you to be a shining light in that darkness that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever father and we long for the day that we can all come back together lord that we can look upon one another's faces and we can hug one another knowing that we're safe in you for lord we know that if the watchman watches and god doesn't watch the city that that watchman is watched in vain lord what good does it do is if we did everything the world told us to do us and you weren't helping us and protecting us father please remember us father bring us closer together stronger together and as our brother preached tonight may that token so go out in our lives that you you'll know where to come and dwell amen you will know where to come and dwell because we've applied the blood we asked this tonight in jesus name we pray amen god bless you brother you'll come may be seated amen let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord we ask you to bless this bread father and for all that it represents and we know that you represent your word and your word is food and meat indeed through the spiritual inner man we ask that we could come into communion tonight with the very desire that you have for us the desire that we would be as your messenger said chips off the block just about the father's business living and doing the same thing just the way you would do it that's our portion that's what he's trying to do is have a church of sons and daughters that are about his will may we come in communion tonight with that vision father this blood that represents the shed blood of jesus christ that paid the price that by his stripes we were healed that it represents the stimulation of revelation may it come on our heart till it's revealed to us personally that we have a part to play in the fulfilling of the word may our communion be around your person tonight we ask it in jesus name we pray amen may god bless you come as you feel led hallelujah [Music] you
