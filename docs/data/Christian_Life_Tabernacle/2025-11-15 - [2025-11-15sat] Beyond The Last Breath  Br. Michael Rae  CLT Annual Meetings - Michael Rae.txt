Description:
Beyond The Last Breath
Br. Michael Rae
CLT Annual Meetings
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 15th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

God bless you tonight. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. And do you know and believe that he knows what you have need of &gt;&gt; even before you ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the greater thing is is that he loves you. And we love him because he first loved us. And and so we have great faith in his faithfulness to us. And he called us. And if he started a work in us, he'll finish it till the end. So uh I I just enjoyed uh last night's service, didn't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. What it means to have a new heart and to have God change your heart. and all those that came to the altar and and and you ask God to to make a change in you, he'll do it. He'll keep his word. He'll hear what you ask for. Now, that's not going to keep you from temptation because the devil's a roaring line, you know. He'll make you prove it every day of your life, you know. So don't you don't you can't run from them. You got to turn and face them with the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. You know, every year we in our hearts we have a a theme in our heart that uh we desire. And this year in my heart uh it was you know uh listen and hear. Listen and hear. In incline your ear to the word of God and take every word, every sentence and and hear it. And and and and if you if you listen, then you'll hear.

And he'll bring it by and let you know, I hear you. I know you. I know what you have need of even before you ask. So if we listen and the scripture uh says this in uh revelations it says the 17th 22nd chapter it says and the spirit and the bride say come. Let him that hath ear heareth say come. Let him that's a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely. Amen. And let him that heareth say, "Come." Amen. Let's stand together tonight. If you have a request on your heart, God already knows what it is. Approach him with faith. Say, "Father, you know my heart. You know, I've asked for a new heart. &gt;&gt; You know, I want my heart inclined to you. And we sing that little song, listen to my heart. You know, when my words fail me, Lord, listen to my heart. Amen. Let's approach the throne of grace tonight. If you have a a need on your heart, you have something that you'd like God to specially do for you, ask abundantly cuz he is able. In your world, it might seem impossible, but with him all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just speak your heart to him. He knows it. He loves you. Let you approach his throne of grace. Our gracious father, we approach your grace, your mercy, and the mighty throne that you sit upon. Father, we walk to it and we bow down, Father, and we kneel under the shed blood of our redeemer. And we make our requests known to you this evening because you're all powerful and you're all knowing and you can move on our hearts and you can speak to us and father we can listen and we can hear and blessed is he that heareth the words of these prophecies. And this evening, Father, we desire more than ever that our understanding would come open and that our revelation of your love would increase and the power of your might towards us may be our comfort and joy. Father, we thank you today for all those that helped. Father, Brother Tim Syler, Father, all that the meat that he cooked for us, Father, all the baking, all the sides, Father, all the labor of love that went into it. May you touch each giver and each heart tonight and bless them. Father, the ministers that have gathered, praying for the meetings, our visitors, Father, that have come to worship you with us. We ask that you be, Father, magnified and lifted up. And we ask, Father, in return that you'd be kind, gentle, and merciful to each one, granting them the desire of their heart. For we ask it in the most precious and most gracious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I want to sing that little song as we turn it over to Billy and just thinking about the service that we had last night about a heart change. That little song, Listen to My Heart. Amen. Do you believe God hears your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How do you explain? How do you a love that goes from east to and runs as deep as it is. You know all our Lord. You know our fears.

Oh, and we will use the words we know. to tell you what an awesome God you are. Oh, tell you what I love. Listen to our heart. If words could fall, I pray. And if I had a thousand years, I was still running out of time. So if you listen to my heart, Lord, every sing, thank you for the truth. Thank you for the way.

So so lovely to be here and to sojourn with you again, seeing so many faces that we love and cherish through the years. And I was just thinking, my goodness, it's it's it's quite interesting actually to see each one grow. That's what's actually quite, you know, just precious to see. You know, you come over the years and you say, "My goodness, I'm getting old." And dear goodness, but it's precious to see life, &gt;&gt; you know, seeing this little buddy here just grow up on me. My goodness, your little man. God bless you. Thank you for your hospitality, Brother David and Sister Leslie, and each one, Brother Matthew, and everybody that's just so welcomed us. My goodness, it's just been beautiful. I got my little baggie snicker doodles. Sister Lori, if you're here, oh my, the cookies today, the NI Nima bar cookies, the maple cookies, the brisket. Oh my, I gained a few pounds today. But we thank you so much. And I I actually I want to say thank you to brother David and sister Leslie. You know, it meant so much to us when you came when brother Biscoll passed away and you came and spent time took time out of your week and you know I know we didn't get time together in a sense but just to have you come there was such a special strength to us and we thank you so much and special to us appreciate that so so very much. So if we can just give a little bit back to you here tonight let's give my give myself over to the Holy Spirit. Let him speak to you tonight. Amen. I was pondering just the services and the weekend and I was just thinking about just all the burdens that are represented here, the needs that are represented here. And I just was at home in my study and I thought, Lord, what what do you desire to do to with these precious believers? And they've labored and they're working hard. They've set time aside and they've put in their funds and their time and they've cooked and they've prepared and they've cleaned and all all to create a moment. All to create a moment. Not just to have a gathering and eat dinner together and have the best brisket known to North America or to the world. That's that's not the point. The point is so that he can come &gt;&gt; and that you can actually be so impacted and changed that this weekend of meetings you can point back to and say there &gt;&gt; my God met me. &gt;&gt; That's what I pray the services and even last night just such a special move of God as the Holy Spirit moved so tenderly and sitting in the chair there at the very end and brother Billy started to sing the song stay. I just love that song. That song can really only be sung at a very special moment of a service when the Holy Spirit has come in such a tender way. And then that song just can come and you can start to just to tell him, "Lord, just stay a little bit more. You've come, you've tenderly moved, and you dealt with our hearts, but just just a little more. Just stay." And that was just how it was last night. I pray you were able to drink from the fountain of life. But the Lord tonight has something a little more maybe. &gt;&gt; And so we'll just pull a little more tonight, will you? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not finished yet. So why don't we turn to our Bibles and we'll turn to the word. You know what? if we just removed all of our preconceived ideas tonight. &gt;&gt; What if we just set aside everything that you've thought this service could be &gt;&gt; and you come and thinking of something you've maybe been through many weekends and many services, but just just push it all aside. What if tonight &gt;&gt; was like the very first service you've ever been in your life? &gt;&gt; What if you came to it like that? &gt;&gt; He said, "What if this would be the very first night? I've never been in an atmosphere like this." And you you what if what if you were coming and someone te told you like Philip did Nathaniel said Nathaniel he's here the Messiah is here. What if what if I like Philip came to you tonight and said listen Nathaniel you need to come and see the Messiah is here. What what if we had that conversation and all of you were there under the tree and you said really here in this hour? Could it really be? Could it really be that Jesus has revealed himself in this hour again? Could it really be that the son of man has come and revealed the scriptures and Malachi 4 has come and been fulfilled in this earth? COULD IT BE? &gt;&gt; AND I'M LIKE, "YES, it's happened. You need to come and see." &gt;&gt; And what if you, like Nathaniel, came to Jesus' feet for the very first time. &gt;&gt; And if Philip said, "Come and see." And he did. And he said, "Okay, I'm going to come." And he there sat for the first time. Let's approach it like that. &gt;&gt; We're all Nathaniels tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Galatians chapter 5. Scripture that you all know quite well, I'm sure. Galatians 5. Actually, we'll slip over to six. Sorry. One chapter over and verse seven. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. Amen. Let us not be weary in welloing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. If we faint not. Let's just slip back to Ezekiel 37. Brother Tom scared me last night as he went to 36 and I my mind was racing. I said, "No way. Not to my very same chapter." Pretty close. Ezekiel 37. It's a good sound. Imagine the moment when someone received their first Bible back in the, you know, 1500s and such in 1600s and they had a service and the very first time they started to hear pages. What a moment that would have been, huh? A preacher must have been like, "Glory, they've got the word in their hands." Amen. And we have that same one in our hands tonight. Amen. Ezekiel 37 verse 9. Then said he unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, thus saith the Lord God, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain that they may live." So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, tonight, Lord, we are so thankful that we can be gathered together, Lord, in this atmosphere today. And Lord, you don't want to take, Lord, a service for granted. Lord, we can just come to meetings, but Lord, we want to, Lord, maybe as Nathaniel, Lord, came with a little trepidation. Could it really be that Philip's right? Could it really be that this is the Messiah? And Lord, as he approached that moment, Lord, I'm sure there was a little bit of excitement. And Lord, just wonder in his being, Lord, tonight, but Lord, something was calling him because, Lord, a seed inside of that predestinated son of God was drawing him to the word and and flesh in that hour. And Lord, that's what's drawn us here tonight is Lord, a seed inside of each one of us, Lord, that we're desiring with a great desire to hear from the very word of God, Lord. And that is what Nathaniel heard as you spoke to him and you discerned him, Lord, and the word was a discerner. Would you discern our need tonight, Lord, with that same one, Lord, when you were there, this the same God, Lord, as your scripture says, is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're the same as you were in Galilee, as you are today. And so would you discern our need, meet our every Lord, heart's desire, I pray. And we just commit this word to you now. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated tonight. All right. You help me preach tonight. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take just a little thought if I could. I'm if I'd title it tonight, I'd maybe title it the beyond the last breath. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Beyond the last breath. And we'll just try and maybe take a couple of these scriptures and uh just present bring a little thought. We'll just fellowship together. Amen. Along the way. And and so the scripture there as we read in Galatians, it says, "And let us not be weary in welloing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not." And so there's an aspect there that that you could get weary and tired. them. And then in Ezekiel, we we I want to just focus on the the scripture where it says, "Breathe and breathe upon these slain that they may live." And maybe try and bring these two thoughts together. And you know, when a when a little baby is born, a little baby is born, there's there's a natural, if I could say, even a natural wind that that it gets infused into this little baby. All right? And and then that little be baby, you know, he comes and he's birthed there and he's just until something is infused into him, he's just what we'd call still. It'd be a stillborn baby if nothing if nothing came and entered into his lungs. there when THAT THAT WIND STARTS to move and you know sometimes maybe the doctor has to give it a little pat on the rear or something like that just to kind of startle that little thing and he brings that that breath of air into his lungs and something changes. You know something happens there when when the wind not just wind COMES IN BUT LIFE COMES IN RIGHT COMBINED with that wind or that that natural airflow that we just think natural but something else is taking place a natural a life is now being birthed and he becomes a living thing well breathing thing. He's been living off of his mama there for a little while but now that wind is now there and that spirit is brought into that BODY WHEN THAT BREATH STARTS surging through that little being. Amen. It's quite an incredible moment whoever's been able to experience that and to see life be infused. And so with this life now, mankind has has really been uh you know that's been happening for many many uh hundreds of years. Babies have been born. Man has started to breathe and they've started to to to uh to produce I could say with that breath that wind that has been then that utters from them the the first wind of life man is now exhaling out through these centuries. And with that life it's produced a lot of things. That first that that wind man has been able to do well it was with that wind that they say the the you know some of the greatest things of man was the declaration of human rights with with this breath of life man has has conquered kingdom after kingdom domain after domain. You go through all through time you look at Rome and Greece and Babylon and the Mongols and all these different things. They they they they've conquered and have been conquered. They they've produced incredible things of art with with this air, with this with this wind of life that has come through man. They've produced things like the pyramids and such. And they've composed great symphonies and orchestrations and and and and man has produced &gt;&gt; as as man has breathed in and breathed out. It's produced and it's gone through through the centuries of time. It's created the steam train, the engine, and then it created a plane, and man has gone to the moon and done all these great feats. And they've they've, you know, done things like the four-minute mile and even greater maybe now. They've climbed Everest, the greatest mountain in the world here. And great feats of heroism. You know, they've gone to warfare. Texas itself is one of the war hero. Chris Kyle, mighty sniper, the legend. Life, the wind has produced these things. It's with this wind of life, the battle of Sanito in 1836, Texas became its own place. &gt;&gt; Man has harnessed fire. It's created the written written word, created things like electricity or harnessed electricity, split atoms. with this life man has taken the breath of this first wind and has been doing a lot of things and with what I could say what have they done with it with all its accomplishments and all the great things that man has done through all the centuries you could compile the greatness of man and what he's done since the first time it's received this breath of life but it's still filled with incredible difficulties &gt;&gt; through all of the goodness and all the greatness that man has done, we still live in an incredibly worrisome age and a pressurized age. And and an age, Brother Brandham says, he says, in this great day that we're living, he said, there's so much pressure. &gt;&gt; You know, everything seems to be pressurized. He said, such a hard hard time. He says, "How strange in this age of plenty, in an age of progress, in an age of abundance, how could there be trials?" &gt;&gt; You know, with all that man has had, he's had thousands of years to to to breathe in this air and create and and accomplish and and improve and and and take time TO TO MAKE THE BEST he can. And still, we live in an age that's just so pressurized, so strangely filled with so much difficulty. He said, "With an age of plenty and opportunity, when everyone has so much, there's so much more to be had. With the inventions to do our work and so many things that give us pleasure, he says, suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation." He says, "When everybody ought to be happy, when really nothing to be unhappy about, millions are taking sedatives at night, pet pills in the morning, rushing to doctors, entering institutions, trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol." He said, "Yes, this age boasts of tremendous stores of worldly goods, but the people are less happy than ever. This age boasts of spiritual attainments, but the people are less sure of themselves than ever. This age boasts are they're less sure of themselves than ever. The age boasts of better moral values, and it's more corrupt than any age since the flood. It talks about knowledge and science, but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields. For the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep a breast with all the changes that have come upon the earth. This is a leadyian church age. He says, "And in one generation, we've gone all the way from horse and buggy to space age. And we're proud and boastful about it. But inside is a dark void cavern that's crying out in torment. And without a known reason, men's hearts are failing for fear. And the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics. &gt;&gt; This is what man has done &gt;&gt; with the first breath. And believers are not exempt of these cares. &gt;&gt; Believers are not exempt of the strains and these troubling situations that we go through. For there's great, it's a great wearome time as we read in scripture. Don't be weary and welloing because we go week after week with great cares. And that's why I was pondering each one of you as we were just thinking about the weekend of services. What cares and burdens that you bear as you'd come to these meetings and you you'd walk in here and maybe someone has no idea what you're going through. Someone has no idea the strain that is maybe on your mind right even right now. Maybe some of you are right at the break the point of breaking because you carry a burden so heavy. This first wind that we've breathed in as mankind has not created a lot of easiness and we carry burdens within our family that weigh heavy on our mind or our children. Maybe we're looking maybe maybe we're desiring children. Maybe we're desiring our children to be married or saved. Or I can tell you young parents, it's not easy rearing children. It gets exhausting and you're trying to take care of the children, hold the standard of Christ in the home and this pressurized age, the world pressing on every side and the influences and you have teenagers and you're you're waring with the world. &gt;&gt; It becomes wearing. Maybe you've gone through many decades of life and you have disappointments that have heaped up over the years and you know one disappointment is okay, two is three and four and suddenly 10 and suddenly you have a life's worth of disappointments. You're coming down here tonight. You're just Lord, I don't know how I can get through another day. Maybe some of you have had friends leave you, forsake you for this gospel. That leaves a wound hurt on your heart. Maybe you've had possessions will be lost. Things you've striven for and you've gained and now they're gone. Maybe you're sick and your body's failing you. &gt;&gt; We have burdens. We get weary. &gt;&gt; We get weary. Some maybe have financial strains that you've carried for many, many years and an accumulation of burdens and cares and years of maybe persecution, maybe disassociation, maybe from your family. And through time, you might even ask yourself recently, Lord, does this ever end? Is there ever an end to this? Will this trial come to an end? Will this burden come? Will the burden end? Do I have to carry this? How much longer do I need to carry this, Lord? And I'd say with natural life, yes, there is an end to the first wind. For mankind comes when it we come to a place where we no longer take in the first wind and we come to the place where we come to our last breath. That's just humanity. And Ezekiel 37 starts to paint a picture of this place. And the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me into the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of dry bones and caused me to pass by them round about. And behold, there there were very many in the open valley. And lo, they were very dry. This is scripture. And he said unto me, "Son, can these bones live?" And here, think about it, Ezekiel. And he answered, he said, "OH LORD, THOU KNOWEST." HE'S LOOKING AT A VALLEY OF dry bones. If you could maybe go up to those bones and just blew on them, they just go into dust. They're they're SITTING THERE SO DRY. THEY WERE DEAD, DEAD, AND DEAD three times over. And he's saying, "Hey, can these bones live?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel saying, "Well, &gt;&gt; with my natural eye, &gt;&gt; IT REALLY LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE. WITH MY NATURAL EYE, I DON'T I &gt;&gt; MY FLESH SAYS NO. THEY SURELY COULD CAN DRY BONES LIVE AGAIN. IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT THESE THINGS THAT THAT COULD JUST BLOW INTO THE WIND WHERE THEY'VE THEY'VE UTTERED THEIR VERY LAST BREATH &gt;&gt; can live again? &gt;&gt; But Lord Lord, thou knowest. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ALL THINGS. I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST HUMAN. AND I DON'T KNOW NOTHING, BUT YOU KNOW ALL THINGS. SO, I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE AN ANSWER. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, &gt;&gt; TONIGHT I'M JUST SAY, LORD, YOU KNOW MY PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW MY SITUATION? &gt;&gt; DO CAN I GET THROUGH IT? &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, LORD, &gt;&gt; AMEN. And there were bones. These were prior lives. &gt;&gt; This is THESE WERE THIS WAS SOMEBODY THAT WAS BREATHING BEFORE. This was somebody that that had a life before. THEY HAD LIVED. THEY HAD FAMILIES. MAYBE THEY had loved ones. They had children that we know nothing about. &gt;&gt; Don't just look at them at dry bones. Let's let's let's remember what they were before THEIR LAST BREATH. THEY WERE SOMEBODY. THEY DID SOMETHING. THEY LIVED FOR LIFE. THEY HAD A WIFE. THEY had a h, you know, a husband or whichever they could have had. They had accomplishments that we know nothing about. &gt;&gt; They did something. THEY HAD SUCCESSES. Maybe they had failures. They had friends and friendships THAT THEY HAD. THEY HAD JOBS. THEY HAD LIFE. &gt;&gt; Don't just look at them as dry bones. Look at them as somebody like you &gt;&gt; that lived and breathed AND THAT FIRST BREATH WAS JUST IN AND OUT. THAT WIND CAME IN AND OUT OF THEM AND THAT natural wind had moved through their beer beings and everything they had accomplished and did is totally forgotten &gt;&gt; cuz you know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's nothing there. All of that is totally unknown. &gt;&gt; All of their earthly accomplishments and achievements. What did it mean? What did it mean? All it became was a valley of dry bones. That's it. That's all it was sitting there. Corpses that have lost everything. And so I wonder all of our earthly accomplishments and our achievements. Where's it going to be? &gt;&gt; What's it going to get us really? At the end of the day, the first wind gets us to a valley of dry bones. It gets us six feet under the earth in some little coffin somewhere. And eventually WE ALSO WOULD BECOME JUST DRY BONES. &gt;&gt; You know, if that's all you're hanging on to is what you can do and what I can achieve and and what this WITH THIS FIRST WIND OF LIFE CAN DO FOR ME AND HOW I CAN ACCOMPLISH AND I CAN GAIN ALL THE THE MONEY I CAN AND ALL THE SUCCESS I CAN. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL BECOME. IT'S JUST DRY bones &gt;&gt; and it WILL ALL BE FORGOTTEN. &gt;&gt; Totally forgotten. &gt;&gt; Your great school and degree will be forgotten. All of that, whatever your goals, your work progress and awards, your sports abilities, how well YOU CAN KICK A SOCCER BALL, SWING A BASEBALL BAT, WHATEVER IT COULD BE, throw some hoops, YOUR HOBBIES, YOUR PASSIONS, EVERYTHING YOU PUT TIME INTO THE STUFF THAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; It's just going to be dust, &gt;&gt; just dry bones. And Ezekiel continued to say, "And when I beheld, lo, the senus, and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them. The first wind of life was not in them anymore. They were still there lifeless. They could have all THE THE GOOD FLESH ON THEM. The bones could come together. THE MUSCLES COULD GET ATTACHED. Everything was perfect. They were standing there, the epitome of A HUMAN BEING. MUSCLES READY TO GO, but still no life. And the scripture says, "Then he said unto me, prophesy unto the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, thus sayeth the Lord God, come from THE FOUR WINDS, O BREATH, and breathe UPON THESE SLAIN THAT THEY may live." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "So I prophesied, and he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army." Then he said unto me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house OF ISRAEL. BEHOLD, THEY SAY, we talked about that ONE TIME. THEY SAY, WHO SAYS?" SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY THAT HAS NO AUTHORITY. THEY SAY that the bones ARE DRIED AND OUR HOPE IS LOST. WE ARE CUT OFF OF OUR PARTS. THEREFORE PROPHESY AND SAY UNTO THEM, THUS SAYETH THE LORD GOD, BEHOLD, OH MY PEOPLE, I WILL OPEN UP YOUR GRAVES, AND CAUSE YOU TO COME OUT OF YOUR GRAVES, AND BRING YOU INTO A LAND OF ISRAEL, AND YE SHALL KNOW I AM THE LORD, WHEN I HAVE OPENED YOUR GRAVES, OH MY PEOPLE, AND BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE GRAVES, AND I AND SHALL PUT MY SPIRIT IN YOU, and ye SHALL LIVE, AND I SHALL PLACE IN YOUR OWN YOU in your own land, AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD. I HAVE SPOKEN IT AND PERFORMED IT, SAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS EZEKIEL FINDING OUT? HE WAS FINDING OUT THAT GOD KNEW, I CAN BREATHE A SECOND WIND INTO THIS BEING. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR FIRST WIND DID. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR FLESH CAN DO, BUT I CAN RAISE IT UP. I CAN TAKE AWAY ALL THE EARTHLY ASPECT AND I CAN INFUSE INTO YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel's dry BONES RECEIVED A SECOND WIND &gt;&gt; BEYOND THE LAST BREATH OF HUMANITY. BEYOND THE LAST BREATH THAT YOU BREATHE, THERE'S ANOTHER BREATH. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A DIFFERENT INFUSION THAT GOD WANTS TO POUR INTO YOU. HE DON'T CARE ABOUT JUST THE NATURAL. THERE'S A SECOND WIND THAT HE NEEDS TO INFUSE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The second wind of life WENT BEYOND ALL ASPECTS OF THE NATURAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ALONG WITH IT, ALONG WITH THE INFUSION OF THE BREATH OF GOD CAME GOD'S SPIRIT HIMSELF &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID, "AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT." IT WASN'T JUST NATURAL BREATH AT THE WHEN YOU BECAME A BABY, BUT A SECOND INFUSION. WHEN A HOLY SPIRIT COMES INTO YOU AND COMES INTO ME, BEHIND THAT IS HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The second wind MAN STRIVES, FIGHTS. OH MY GOODNESS. THEY INFUSE THEMSELVES WITH PILL after pill, you know, scoop after SCOOP OF SOME PRODUCT TO TRY AND help them be healthy. diet, concoction after concoction to ensure that the first wind that you breathed in at birth could last a long time just to extend it another day or another year or another 10 years, whatever. Man tries a whole lot. &gt;&gt; But there's a greater win. &gt;&gt; It's the second one. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's more important than preserving this first one. You know, God gave us oxygen and nitrogen, mixed it all together for us that we could be drawing it into our lungs and you know, breathing that so beautifully. But, you know, there's only one place. There's only one thing we desire is the WIND OF GOD &gt;&gt; TO be infused into you and I. Brother Brandon says that of Christ and mystery God revealed. says, "Oh, oh, I wish I HAD TIME TO GO BACK TO EZEKIEL AND PULL OUT THEM DRY BONES AND show you." HE SAID, "CAN THESE DRY BONES LIVE AGAIN?" HE SAID, "PROPHESY. HOW CAN PROPHECY COME?" ONLY THROUGH THE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD." HEAR YE DRY BONES, THE WORD OF THE LORD. I CAN TELL YOU THIS EVENING WHAT HAS BEEN INFUSED INTO YOU IN THIS HOUR HAS BEEN A WIND FROM A PROPHET'S MESSAGE THAT HAS COME THIS HOUR TO GET AWAY GET YOUR MIND OFF OF THIS NATURAL EARTH THIS NATURAL WIND THAT'S COMING INTO MY MOUTH RIGHT NOW AND GET YOU PRE GET YOU FOCUSED ON ANOTHER WIND ANOTHER INFUSION THAT CAN TAKE YOU INTO ETERNITY &gt;&gt; DON'T GET STUCK ON TERAPIRMA THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT IS TO LIFT YOUR EYES UP A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SEE YOU NEED TO BREATHE ANOTHER BREATH THE FIRST wind really did did them dry bones no good. &gt;&gt; But when the word of a prophet camel &gt;&gt; when the word of a prophet came, &gt;&gt; it had power &gt;&gt; TO RAISE UP THE DRY BONES. NOT JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER and make them look like A GREAT ARMY BUT IMMOVABLE BUT IT ALSO IS ABLE TO INFUSE INTO THEM THE VERY ESSENCE AND LIFE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Because the word this is restrictive. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Because the word has life. Yes, &gt;&gt; this word has life. &gt;&gt; It ain't just a Bible that you're reading for, you know, put in your time. Well, I just got to read my Bible tonight, you know, just because I got to check that box off, you know. No, this has life. &gt;&gt; This is the second win that you need. This is Christ himself that needs to infuse himself into you. You need to you need to breathe this one in. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, the Shounomite woman was there and her baby HAD DIED AND THE FIRST WIND HAD EXITED OUT of her little boy. And she knew THAT THERE WAS A PROPHET IN THE LAND. SHE KNEW IF I COULD JUST GET TO THE WORD OF MY DAY, I KNOW THAT THERE COULD BE A SECOND INFUSION INTO MY LITTLE BOY'S BODY. AND SO, SHE CAME TO A PROPHET AND HE SAID, "I NEED YOU TO COME TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT." &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU NEED A YOU NEEDED THE WORD TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT. HE SAID, "I NEED I KNOW THERE'S A WORD IN THIS HOUR. JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. AND HE'S HERE IN MY MIDST TODAY, AND THIS WEEKEND. I NEED HIM TO COME TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT BECAUSE THE WORD HAS POWER TO RAISE YOUR DEAD BOY, &gt;&gt; TO RAISE YOUR DEAD GIRL OR GIRL. HE HAS POWER TO RAISE YOUR DEAD HUSBAND OR YOUR DEAD WIFE. &gt;&gt; She brought that prophet to her little home. He came there and he laid there hand to hand, face to face, face, lip to lip AND BREATHED. AND THE POWER OF GOD IN A PROPHET, &gt;&gt; think about it, &gt;&gt; infused a second wind of life &gt;&gt; into that little boy. &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "The Lord God lives and our your soul never dies. I'm not going to leave you." That's what she said to Elijah. And he prayed right there till Elisha went to the house. Laid his body on that dead boy, dead baby. Never prayed. Laid his head and hands OVER LIKE THIS. PUT HIS LIPS AGAINST it like that. AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT WAS IN ELISHA COME UPON THE CHILD AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; OKAY, I'm going to make it a big jump here tonight. You think that spirit of God ended there in Elisha in the scripture? You think the spirit of God ended at William Brandon in 1965? Did the spirit of God stop working in his people and through HIS PEOPLE? THEN WHO'S HERE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHO'S HERE TONIGHT THAT IS LIVING AND BREATHING THROUGH A BODY OF PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Spirit. AND IF GOD COULD BREATHE THROUGH A PROPHET LIKE THAT, IF I COULD TAKE THE WORDS BUTTER BRENNHAM SAID, "PUT THESE WORDS ON YOUR LIPS. PUT THIS PRAYER ON YOUR LIPS." WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S LIFE WITH THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; Without the breath of life, a body is dead as dead can be. We know it. There's nothing there. You can have all the characteristics of this body, but without breath, &gt;&gt; it's dead. &gt;&gt; We know this. It could have a perfect nose. IT COULD HAVE PERFECT EYES. It could BE THE PERFECT SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY. MUSCLES RIPPLING AND BEAUTY AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WITHOUT BREATH, &gt;&gt; it's nothing. Without breath, it's a corpse. It's a cadaavver. It's a shell. No one home. That is the same very same for the spiritual body that is walking day in and day out with the Holy Spirit living inside. You're just a spiritual walking cadaavver &gt;&gt; and need a second wind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not to put it so graphic, but that's as basic as it can get &gt;&gt; because you'll just end up dry bones. But if the second wind of God, a Holy Spirit infusion can come. But Abraham says, "What we need, the church needs is not a facelift or a bunch of new members, but revive that what we've got and fill with the Holy Ghost AND SET OUT TO FIGHT THE ENEMY TO PRAY FOR THE SICK, HEAL THE SICK, CAST OUT DEVILS. FREELY YOU RECEIVE, FREELY GIVE. These signs shall follow them THAT BELIEVE CHRIST PUT INTO THE HAND OF THE MAN OF MAN." THE STRONGEST WEAPON THAT WAS EVER PUT INTO THE HUMAN BEING WAS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT &gt;&gt; AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT IN THERE. HE SAYS, HE SAYS, AND THEN FIGHT WITH WHAT'S IN YOU UNTIL DEATH SET YOU FREE. I SAY TONIGHT, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SECOND WIND, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT BREATHING THROUGH YOU, TONIGHT IS YOUR NIGHT FOR THE BREATH OF GOD TO COME AND INFUSE YOU. HE SAID, "WELL, I GAVE MY HEART TO HIM." AND HE'S WANTING TO THEN PUT HIS SPIRIT IN YOU. &gt;&gt; Don't stop AT JUST GIVING THE HEART. &gt;&gt; DON'T STOP AT JUST GIVING THE HEART, BUT SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO BREATHE IN. &gt;&gt; I NEED A HOLY GHOST FILLING TONIGHT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm going to define for you a second wind. Anybody here is a runner? Who's Anybody run? Tough crowd. That little guy back there. Nobody's a runner in here. Hey, I like it. For the one or so runners that are in this building, they'll understand what I'm saying. But the rest of us, it's all new news here. When you run to keep the first wind going as long as you can, a runner can experience this kind of exhilarating moment where they become exhausted and they they're coming to really the end of their their ability and they get what they call a second wind. IT'S LIKE THIS THIS RESURGING OF ENERGY that that fills them and they are able to keep going. It's kind of a you know it's a bit of a interesting phenomenon and everybody has some wonderings of you know why or or how does it happen but you know so they they it's this temporary relief of breathlessness and fatigue or in sleep you know you can combat the drowsiness you kind of wake up you're like wow yeah whoever's done that so there we go there we go you're not runners but you're late nighters okay I see so you got no problem if I STOP MY CLOCK and we just you know keep going because you know what I now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You get that little second wind, YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, I'M GOOD FOR A LONG HAUL. I'M GOING TO BE LIKE LISTENING TO PAUL WHO WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT PREACHING AND THE POOR FELLOW THAT DIDN'T GET A SECOND WIND FELL OUT OF THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING." That's right. Exactly. That's We don't have no windows here, so we're good. BUT BUT THAT'S WHAT THE SECOND WIND IS. IT'S A CONFUSION. You're like, "I'm ready for the day again." But, you know, everybody tries to figure out why. scientists they reason with series you know they just think that well it's just some endorphins that kick into the brain and it makes you feel good and and you know there's some you know you ignore the pain kind of thing but others others kind of theorize that well some take the fact that maybe it's it happens in professionals because you know they've trained and they can push through and and things like that or or some they just think it's totally psychological you know that it is just you know the boost comes when you realize you're over halfway and suddenly you know you're going on the other side of the hill and it's like you get a real resurgence But you know, whatever it is, it happens. I don't really care what the reason is. There's something called the second wind. It comes and and people feel this this this infusion of energy and and and and they they feel like they can go all the way. But if I COULD SAY THE SECOND WIND IN IN THIS HOUR ON A SPIRITUAL ASPECT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHICH BRINGS POWER FOR YOU TO KEEP GOING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That second if it hasn't come AND FILLED YOU, YOU'RE really just GOOD. AS I SAID, THEM DRY BONES OR YOU KNOW, SATAN WANT NO scared of no dry bones. &gt;&gt; Satan ain't scared &gt;&gt; of just somebody that's walking in and out of church just as a message young ruler. &gt;&gt; He he he don't scared of nothing. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU THOSE BONES BECAME INFUSED WITH LIFE &gt;&gt; AND RECEIVED A SECOND WIND FROM A PROPHET'S WORD, NOW WE HAD A PROBLEM. THE SOLDIERS CAME TO BATTLE. ARMOR STARTED BEATING, GLEAMING, SWORDS CAME OUT, SHIELDS CAME OUT. IT SAID, "ALL RIGHT, IT'S READY FOR BATTLE TIME." &gt;&gt; WHOA. Just hold your horses there. And that's what happens when the you become from dry bones to living bones because the Holy Spirit has come and infused you. &gt;&gt; Satan says, "Wait a second. I got a problem here." Them November meetings really caused a stir was in hell BECAUSE SOMEBODY WALKED IN DRY BONES AND THEY RECEIVED SOME SORT OF BREATH, SOME SORT OF INFUSION, SOME SORT OF SECOND WIND AND I GOT AN ISSUE HERE IN HELL. I GOT TO DISPATCH A LEGION OF DEMONS TO THAT PERSON THERE BECAUSE OF WHERE I COULD JUST IGNORE THEM. NOW I CANNOT. &gt;&gt; Something brought Job's strength when it seemed hopeless. It wasn't Job's abilities. Job didn't do nothing. Something brought Abraham through the dark hour of trial when he was waiting for a promise. Something moved the martyrs through incredible tribulation. SOMETHING. THEY HAD SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT WAS BEYOND JUST THIS NATURAL BREATH THAT WAS BEYOND JUST WHAT I'M BREATHING RIGHT NOW THAT COULD GET THEM through incredible difficulty. &gt;&gt; Abraham that was there for 25 years, you don't think that was a difficult time. You don't think that at year 17, DAY 275, HOUR 12, MINUTE 39, that he was just there under the weight OF THE BURDEN OF GOD. DID YOU NOT HEAR YOUR PROMISE? I STILL BELIEVE. WHAT WAS IT? He was infused with something more &gt;&gt; than just this breath I'm breathing right now. &gt;&gt; But Abraham says, "And I looked." He said, "I was looking at all the trees and all of that." He says, "Well, that wind's blowing. What's that wind blowing for? What makes the trees act like that?" And he said, "And he said to me, capital H, those trees represent the churches of this day, great to spires." And he said, "We, yes, we were once great churches, but they haven't got no life in them." He says, "What the pulmerorm left and the caterpillar is eaten, the caterpillar left, the cankerorm eating." And I thought, "Well, what's this? What does this wind mean?" He said, "That's the Holy Spirit that come on Pentecost come like a mighty rushing wind." I SAID, "LORD, WELL, WHAT DO YOU SEND THE WIND FOR?" HE SAID, "YOU REMEMBER JOEL SAID, I WILL RESTORE UNTO YOU." SOMEBODY TONIGHT MIGHT FEEL LIKE, WELL, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A LITTLE BIT DRY. I'M A LITTLE BIT LIKE A BIG STICK, BUT I CAN RESTORE. THERE'S ANOTHER WIND THAT CAN RESTORE. IT'S CALLED THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT IS HERE TONIGHT TO SAY, I'M HERE TO BLOW THROUGH THIS LITTLE SANCTUARY. I'M HERE TO BREEZE THROUGH HERE LIKE A RUSHING WIND AND INFUSE. You &gt;&gt; remember, you're Nathaniel &gt;&gt; and you're hearing this for the first time. You're not hearing this like a believer that's been here for 50 years. You're hearing this for the first time saying, "Lord, I need this tree. I need this vessel to be infused." &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time they shake, they dig down a little deeper and get a better hold. &gt;&gt; They go deeper. The wind shakes, makes the tree go down deeper and makes a better tree." He said, "That's what we need tonight is an old-fashioned God-scent Holy Ghost meeting. That's what Switzerland needs, WHAT GERMANY NEEDS. THAT'S WHAT CANADA NEEDS. That's what America needs. He said, "That's the great world. What the great WORLD NEEDS. AND GOD'S GOT HIS PEOPLE. HIS SPIRIT IS HERE. JUST TURN LOOSE AND LET IT BE FLEXIBLE AND THE HOLY GHOST WILL SHOW YOU." AMEN. I THOUGHT, "OH, GOD, TONIGHT, COULD THERE NOT BE A MOVING OF YOUR HOLY SPIRIT WHERE WE ARE JUST DESIRING WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IN ME TO SEE YOU MOVE?" &gt;&gt; Is that just my desire? &gt;&gt; Is that just my desire? Oh God, I pray not. You know, there was a man was a deep, deep, deep sea diver. We're talking 300 plus feet and more. And through a course of situations, he got cut off from his air at about 300 something feet down. And he had a reserve of 10 minutes after his lines got cut. and his butt diving partner was getting pulled. I won't go over the details, but his they were getting pulled and that's why the lines got cut. Well, the one because it gotten snagged and one got pulled away. And as he was pulling away there, as their comms were going to almost stop working, he said, "Get to the top of this underwater uh structure and I'll come I'll come back." And anyways, he gets to the top of the structure with minutes to spare on his tank and the air goes out and he had cluck clicked himself in. And he's sitting there lying there on the 300 feet underwater and his air ceases. Minute by minute goes by and they work to try and get help back to him. And 29 plus minutes later they get him into the capsule where they can get back to air and he's dead. He has breathed his last breath. And they try CPR. They try to give them breath and they give up and they sit in there 300 ft down in this capsule thing that and they just broken that and they they got there but way too late. And as they're talking to each other, they hear him speak. They're like, they they can't reconcile how this man is living again after almost 30 minutes with zero oxygen, no damage. He he he he he it's like he wakes up. He doesn't have brain damage. He's he he he didn't have no idea. You know what what's just happened? They get him upstairs and it's like life went on after almost 30 minutes with zero air. And I thought about that somebody could be 29 years dead. You could sit in church for 30 years &gt;&gt; and your pastor could come and he could preach a word and he he might just have a broken heart. He's maybe looked over the audience over year after year after year, minister after ministers come through and it's like it's like there's it's no hope. There's anything nothing can waken them. Nothing can shake them. It's is there anything year 2 year 5 year 10 minute 15 minute 10 year 15 year 28 year 29 year and suddenly &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; something that they can't explain &gt;&gt; something that we &gt;&gt; I can it's called my god &gt;&gt; AT YEAR 29 SOMEBODY'S SITTING IN CHURCH SOME HUSBAND JUST DECIDES YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE I'M GOING TO GO TO CHURCH AFTER 29 29 YEARS OF PRAYING FROM A LITTLE MOMMY, A LITTLE WIFE THAT'S COME TO CHURCH YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SUDDENLY SOMETHING HAPPENS. IT'S CALLED A WIND GOES THROUGH. A SECOND WIND AFTER THE LAST BREATH HAS BEEN BREATHED AND ALL HOPE HAS BEEN GONE. BUT GOD COMES THROUGH &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "I'M NOT DONE YET. I'M HERE TO GIVE A MIRACLE. I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU THAT I STILL LIVE. THAT I CAN BREATHE INTO THIS BODY OF MINE AND BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE." DON'T YOU DARE SIT THERE AND LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND SAY, "OH, THEY'RE PAST HOPE." THEY'RE NEVER PAST HOPE. BECAUSE MY GOD CAN INFUSE INTO THEM HIS VERY ESSENCE. &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND WHEN GOD DOES THAT, &gt;&gt; NEVER THE SAME AGAIN. I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NO DEFECTS. THERE'S NO BRAIN ISSUES. THERE'S NO PAST LIFE ISSUES. ALL THE PAST IS WIPED AWAY. ALL THE HURT AND SORROW IS GONE BECAUSE HE CAME IN AND BREATHED INTO YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DON'T RELY ON YOUR FIRST HAIR. IT'S FILLED WITH HURT. IT'S FILLED WITH WORRY. IT'S FILLED WITH SHAME. IT'S FILLED WITH CONDEMNATION. BUT GET THE SECOND BREATH. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL GONE. &gt;&gt; ALL TEARS ARE WIPED AWAY. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, ALL THINGS BECOME NEW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The first win &gt;&gt; brought a cursing Peter. The first wind brought a tax collecting Matthew that the Jews hated. The first win brought a Saul that could stand there and watch the people stone Stephen. Just give me your coats. You need to loosen up. I need to make a good throw. I'll hold the coats for you. Take him out. That's what the first one produced. &gt;&gt; This is just the first. I'm going to release my vengeance upon these people they call Christians. That's what the first one produced. &gt;&gt; And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind. AND IT FILLED THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE SITTING. AND THERE APPEARED UNTO THEM CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS OF FIRE, AND IT SAT UPON EACH OF THEM. AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEGAN TO SPEAK WITH OTHER TONGUES AS THE SPIRIT GAVE THEM UTTERANCE. THAT WAS A SECOND WIND THAT TOOK A CURSING PETER AND A TAX COLLECTING MATTHEW AND A WRETCHED SAUL AND COULD CHANGE THEM. &gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR HISTORY IS. I DON'T CARE WHAT ISSUE YOU GOT. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE YOUR PAST HISTORY. THIS SECOND WIND OF GOD CAN BREATHE THROUGH YOU AND CHANGE YOU INTO A PETER THAT COULD STEP OUT AND SAY, "COME ON, HELL. HERE I COME." &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SECOND ONE, YOUNG PEOPLE THAT YOU NEED TONIGHT. IF YOU GAVE YOUR HEART, HE'S HERE TO FILL YOU. &gt;&gt; But says that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost. THAT'S WHAT GOD SENT THE HOLY GHOST FOR. THE HOLY GHOST COME TO GIVE YOU POWER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says, I got some more scriptures here. Just a minute. The Holy GHOST COME TO GIVE YOU POWER. HE GIVES YOU POWER. HE SAID, POWER IN PRAYER. &gt;&gt; He says a little person that's lived a good life. Always defeated. Oh, sure. I love the Lord, Brother Brandon, but you're always defeated. THEY NEVER GET A PRAYER ANSWERED. BUT YOU FILL THAT LITTLE WOMAN WITH THE HOLY GHOST ONE TIME AND WATCH WHAT TAKES PLACE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TAKES PLACE. SATAN KINGDOM GOES ON RED ALERT. LIGHTS START FLASHING. SIRENS START GOING BECAUSE A LITTLE SISTER GETS ON HER KNEES AFTER BEING FILLED WITH ANOTHER WIND OF GOD THROUGH HER AND SAYING, "OH GOD, I HAVE THIS NEED right here." &gt;&gt; He said, "Take that little man so cowardly. The boss kick him all over the place. WAIT A MINUTE HERE. NOW SOMETHING CHANGES. He's got the Holy Ghost." He says it gives you power in speech. &gt;&gt; You're going to work maybe barely even saying a word about what you who you are. People kind of just kick you around, whatever. But this Holy Ghost wind &gt;&gt; walk through work with your shoulders back. &gt;&gt; What happened to this one? I'll tell you what happened. The essence of Almighty God breathed into him. He said, "God was over us with Moses in the burning bush. He fed us with mana. He walked with us three years. But now he's in me. It's not he me that speaketh. It's him. I know who he is and I know who I am. I ain't no more. He is. Ephesians 3. Oh, I pray tonight that it's just not just a service, &gt;&gt; not just quotes and scriptures, &gt;&gt; not just a preacher preaching his heart out, but tonight that you said, "Lord, I I need that. I need that that different. I don't need my spirit. I need your spirit. &gt;&gt; I need your life living inside of me. I need these bones that were dry. THAT'S FEEL SO DRY HERE TONIGHT. I NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I NEED YOU TO COME IN. I GOT WARFARE AHEAD OF ME. I GOT TO GO INTO THE THIS LAND. I NEED TO I I need my skin MY MY SU MY FLESH NOT JUST TO TO PRODUCE SOMETHING and on my own it won't happen. Wherefore I desire that ye faint not, Paul's saying, at my tribulations, for you, which is your glory, for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH MIGHT BY HIS SPIRIT IN the inner man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you need to be strengthened in my with might BY HIS SPIRIT THAT CHRIST MAY dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth AND LENGTH AND DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSES KNOWLEDGE THAT YE MIGHT BE FILLED WITH THE all the fullness of God. Now unto him that's able to DO EXCEEDINGLY ABUNDANTLY above all that we should ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this wind now blew through Pentecost. Peter, James, John, Paul and all these ones started to march through. Butter Brandon says when he saw that little bride in preview, we can look back to the Pentecost first Pentecost church of Acts 2 and we can see all the mighty works it did as they went by gate beautiful and silver and gold have we none but such as we have rise UP AND WALK AND THEY THEY WERE THEY were able to we see miracle after miracle through THIS SCRIPTURE AND WOW WE SAY WHAT AN INFUSION OF GOD. WE COULD SEE THE MOVING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ALL THROUGH THE CHURCH. AND brother Brandomy says, "Here is a preview of the bride." And she come by and I noticed her the way she was. Oh, very lovely and pretty young. And she was walking just in step as she could, not a march, just in stride of a woman, how to walk gracefully and leike. And that's the way she was walking, coming to my left side as she went out of my sight. and he saw the first church, if I could say the first wind go through. But a message came at the end time at the end of ages. If I could say another breath of God was going to be breathed. And brother Bram says, "THEN HE SAID, THE BRIDE WILL COME INTO PREVIEW AGAIN." And here the bride CAME BEHIND HER, THE VERY SAME LOOKING BRIDE THAT PASSED AT THE BEGINNING. THEN MY HEART JUMPED FOR JOY TO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A BRIDE AND SHE'LL BE MADE IN THE SAME THING AND CLOTHED IN THE SAME THING THAT WAS AT THE BEGINNING. SHE IS TO BE CALLED. AND I KNOW THAT IS THE TRUTH. IT'S THE SAME WIND THAT BLEW AT PENTECOST IN ACTS 2 THAT WAS BREATHING THROUGH THAT INFUSED THEM WITH POWER IS BREATHING THROUGH THIS AGE AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ABOUT. IT'S GOD BREATHING A SECOND INFUSION OF THE SAME SPIRIT OF GOD INTO A BRIDE &gt;&gt; TO BRING HER through preview. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say it's the same. the first and the last &gt;&gt; the same breath of God &gt;&gt; rushing through this little group and those that have, you know, if you've ever experience a second wind, it's impossible as a runner or anybody in some sort of physical activity. If I was walking a marathon and I walked it, I would never experience a second wind. Never. I'd never know what that even means. &gt;&gt; If I joged a little bit, I got tired. Got to walk this next K next mile. I jog a little bit. Oh boy, got a heart rate of 130. I'm going to walk again. I wouldn't even know what that mean. A runner could be, man, have you hit it? Have you hit your second win yet? Second what? What's that mean? I don't know. See you, bud. And off he goes. You know, it just be a blur. Because he he he tapped into something. I'll tell you what he tapped into. It's because he was giving everything. &gt;&gt; Because he was exerting all. HE WAS GIVING EVERYTHING HE HAD TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE HE CROSSED OVER TO WHERE HE FEEL AN INFUSION OF ANOTHER'S ENERGY THAT CAME FROM DEEP WITHIN. AND I TELL YOU, THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RECORD THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE WHERE A BURST OF ENERGY CAME WHEN YOU WEREN'T GIVING EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; BEFORE A SECOND WIND COULD COME, BEFORE AN INFUSION OF STRENGTH COULD COME, YOU GOT TO PUT OUTPUT. I look at butter brand his schedule sometimes. I look down all the way through and it's like meeting meeting and then he talks about himself at the pulpit and laying here falling asleep in the early years and day after day through prayer lines. I'M LIKE, "OH GOD, what have I done? I've done nothing." &gt;&gt; This was a PROPHET THAT WAS PUTTING OUT EVERYTHING. HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD. I'M NO PROPHET. WE'RE NO PROPHET. BUT WE CAN PUT OUT EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GIVE OUR ALL. BUT WE GOT TO GIVE OVER AND GIVE EVERYTHING TO HIM. BECAUSE WHEN WE GIVE EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; THAN A RUNNER &gt;&gt; FEELS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU START GIVING YOUR ALL, WHEN YOU SURRENDER EVERYTHING, WHEN YOU LAY IT DOWN AT AN ALTAR, THEN GOD CAN COME THROUGH YOU AND SAY, "ALL RIGHT, I'LL INFUSE YOU." &gt;&gt; You want to hold back 80%. You want to hold back 10%. You ain't going to get there. You want to hold back just EVEN 1%. YOU GOT TO GIVE 100%. YOU'RE AT THE YOU'RE AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FALL DOWN. I DON'T THINK I CAN GO ANYMORE IN THIS RACE. AND THEN SOMETHING STARTS TO CHANGE. LIKE I THINK I can do this. I THINK I GOT IT. I'M READY. WHY? BECAUSE YOU GAVE ALL. &gt;&gt; I know some of you here have been here a long time. You've been here a long time. You've labored many years. You have given of your sustenance. You've supported the work of God. You've labored day in and day out, decade in and decade out. You've put out and you get down weary. Daniel says, "And the 10 horns out of this kingdom and or 10 kings, and they shall rise, and another shall rise after them, and he shall be diverse from from the first, and he shall subdue three kings, and he shall speak great words against the most high, and shall wear out the saints of the most high." So, it's no surprise that you that have toiled a long time and you've labored, oh my goodness, you could have been just in this army for a year and you're already wore out. Why? Because Satan is there to wear you out. Scripture. And they SHALL WEAR OUT THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH. THE THE THE meaning of that IS TO TO OPPRESS or to wear down or it indicates a partially successful attempt to defeat. &gt;&gt; That's pretty key key word there. &gt;&gt; Partially. &gt;&gt; PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL WHERE YOU'RE DRAGGING. OH MY GOODNESS. YOU'RE NOT DEFEATED. YOU'RE NOT FLAT OUT AND DEAD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT LIKE, "HEY, COME ON. I'M OUT." NO, NO, NO. PARTIALLY ABLE, BROTHER. I am through a battle, but I can't do it ANY LONGER. YES, YOU CAN. YOU GOT YOU CAN DO THIS. WE CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENTH US. GET UP. I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN DO IT. AND SO, YOU'RE DOWN THERE. YOU'RE JUST partially defeated because scripture says he shall wear out the saints. Partially defeat the saints. And this picture, it kind of comes to this slow grinding exhaustion to the faithful under a hostile rule and an oppression from an enemy that targets both your body and your spirit. and you become under great defeat and fatigue, don't be weary and welloing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it's right here at this moment &gt;&gt; that God starts to pour in &gt;&gt; and he starts to infuse you with strength and you start to realize this is the hour. If I could say this here tonight, this is your hour of a second wind of God. &gt;&gt; If you are in that place, little mommy, or you're in that little place, little daddy, THIS SERVICE TONIGHT IS GOD'S CALL TO YOU, SAYING, "I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU. I HAVE NOT FORSAKEN YOU. I REMEMBERED YOU, AND I KNOW YOU'RE GIVEN OUT, AND I KNOW YOU'RE WEARY, AND I KNOW YOU'RE LOW, BUT I'M HERE. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE." YOU MIGHT BE 29 MINUTES DEAD THERE WITH NO AIR, BUT I'M HERE TO INFUSE YOU. You &gt;&gt; know this world they give you know they give everything. The world gives their everything. &gt;&gt; Who here has not have you walked around this earth not in the last few years? I'm sure you could go in this your last week and you've watched the world give their all to darkness. &gt;&gt; They are passionate. They are zealous. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's their entertainment, their gaming, THEIR SPORTS, THEIR POLIT POLITICS. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS, MAN. THEY HAVE JUST GIVEN ALL AND GIVEN OVER. &gt;&gt; They have. They It's like they don't even grow weary. Far be it that God will ever let his people be outdone by Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; And so he's here tonight to say it's time for a second wind. &gt;&gt; It's been long. I know it's time for a second wind. &gt;&gt; I'm here to breathe life into you. Okay. It's the extra effort. It's the 100% that brings you to receive the blessing. &gt;&gt; Tonight, you need to put in 100%. God wants to give you a blessing tonight. &gt;&gt; But you need to be like Rahab who actually welcomed the enemy and exposed herself. &gt;&gt; She exposed herself to threat. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD TO STEP OUT a little bit and be like, "Yeah, these guys are different. I've been watching. But what if Rahab, what if they're actually planted spies to seek out maybe somebody inside the king's kind of got A GOT A HEADS up that THERE'S MAYBE AN INTERNAL WHAT IF WHAT IF RAHAB? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I JUST FEEL A PULL. I I FEEL CALLED. I NEED TO REACH OUT TO THESE TWO MEN HERE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT SHE HAD TO STEP OUT IN FAITH AND GO ALL IN. SHE HAD TO GIVE OVER COMPLETELY AND SAY, "HEY, UM, do you need a place? Uh, you know, it was kind of code word going on there to get them over to her house." And what she found out, as brother Brown says, there were two little tape BOYS COMING TO SHARE THE MESSAGE TO HER. WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS WILLING TO STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT AND SAY, "HEY, COME INTO MY HOUSE." MAYBE YOU NEED TO STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT AND SAY, "LORD, COME INTO MY HOUSE." &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to be like blind Barnameus that he had to cry OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. &gt;&gt; NOT BY JUST VOICE, BUT BY FAITH. HAD TO CRY A LITTLE BIT MORE AND STEP OUT AND GO ALL IN &gt;&gt; 100%. OH GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU need to do that tonight. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to be like Zakius who had to climb a tree. Short little guy. Had to climb a tree. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET UP THERE LIKE, "OH, dear goodness. I'M NOT I REALLY GET MY CLOTHES DIRTY, GET SOME GRASS STAINS AND AND BARK STAINS ON MY ON MY SWEET ROBE THAT I JUST PAID FOR." YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT. MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET UP AND CRY. MAYBE YOU GOT TO WIPE YOUR NOSE, BROTHER CALL SNOTTY AND WHATEVER ELSE. MAYBE YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Peter had to cast his net on the other side and humble himself to the word. Are you kidding me? I'm a fisherman. I've fished HERE ALL MY LIFE. YOU'RE TELLING ME TO THROW MY NET ON the other side? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Peter. On the other side. You mean I need to believe your word? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT FISHING? OH, PRETTY much everything. I created them. YOU IMAGINE WHAT JESUS is thinking right there? Peter, in the beginning was the word and the WORD WAS WITH GOD. I WAS IN THE BEGINNING. I WAS BEFORE THE BEGINNING. I PUT THAT FISH IN THE WATER. JUST THROW YOUR NET OVER, WILL YOU? But no, he waited. He waited. Peter, throw your net over. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Humbled himself to the word. &gt;&gt; Maybe like Nathaniel we talked about or the Hebrew boys that defied a decree. These are all PEOPLE IN SCRIPTURE THAT WENT ALL BEYOND 100%. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NEBUCHADNEZZAR, burn us. Yeah, that's some given all. &gt;&gt; Even if our God won't deliver us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even if &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the 99% was we won't bow. Our God's going to come and and and but if he doesn't, well then maybe we'll think about it. That's 99%. 100% all of it is we'll never bow. WE'LL NEVER COMPROMISE. I'LL NEVER FALL FOR THESE THINGS OF THIS WORLD. AND EVEN SO, IF I HAVE TO GO DOWN, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT I GOT GOING TO BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE FIRE, BUT I WILL NOT AND WILL NOT COMPROMISE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S 100%. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How about David had to break ranks with Israel. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GIVING YOU SOMEBODY SOME DIFFERENT ONES THAT HAD TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE TO RECEIVE ANOTHER WIND. AMEN. BECAUSE WHEN THE HEBREW BOYS WENT INTO THAT FIRE AND THEY SAID, "OH GOD, IF YOU LET US BURN, SO BE IT. WE SERVE YOU." BUT THEN they stepped into the flame. Shadrach, man, I still smell that ointment you put on this morning. I was preparing for the trial. No smoke? No. Can you believe it? Whoa. Who's this? WHO'S THIS? WELL, IT'S ONE LIKE UNDER THE SON OF GOD THAT'S STANDING IN OUR MIDST. WHY? BECAUSE WE WENT ALL THE WAY. &gt;&gt; AND GOD THEN BROUGHT A WIND. &gt;&gt; It's nice in here. It's balmy 72°. &gt;&gt; Why? Because a second wind came &gt;&gt; when they gave everything. &gt;&gt; David broke ranks. All of Israel's trembling at the knee. Oh my goodness. There's David's like, "What are you knees knocking for? There's no drums beating. My goodness, there's a lot of kneecaps and he looked at that line. Soldiers lined up there, lined up there." He's like, "Really, David? You're going to do this? What do the pressure?" I mean, I don't want everybody's everybody standing. I don't want to be the one that stands out. I mean, I'd really be the one to step out in faith. I mean, look at all my friends around me. They're just holding the line here. Yeah, but there's a giant there that's defying of God. Oh, man. ALL RIGHT, GOLIATH. WHEN HE DID THAT, IT WAS OVER FOR GOLIATH, RIGHT? BUT DAVID HAD TO GET PAST THE 99% AND GO 100% SO THAT HE COULD START WHIPPING OUT HIS SWING AND SAYING, "ALL RIGHT, THIS DAY, THIS DAY YOUR HEAD'S COMING OFF." &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Only when he did this &gt;&gt; did the wind &gt;&gt; start to blow &gt;&gt; this is your night. &gt;&gt; This is your night to step out a little different. &gt;&gt; This is your night to be a David, a Jacob, an Abraham, a Moses, a Paul, maybe a Ruth, but leave it all behind. &gt;&gt; Orpa couldn't do it. Orpa couldn't do it. Oh, just a pull to be home in the comfort of her family. &gt;&gt; But Ruth, Ruth, she was willing to leave everything she knew. &gt;&gt; And the wind of God blew a Boaz by her way. That's right. &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight, saints of God, what God's wanting to blow tonight. &gt;&gt; What is he wanting to blow from this word? &gt;&gt; But he's needing you to step &gt;&gt; out &gt;&gt; and give everything. &gt;&gt; Queen of Sheba was willing to leave. Esther was willing to go and die. The widow of Zerapath put the word before her own health and her son's existence. Daniel faced lions and prayed in the face of the law. If none of these were willing to go the extra mile, they would have never received the promise. They would never receive the outcome that scripture has. &gt;&gt; But they were predestined. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know why? Because behind you actually is the word. It's pushing you. It's pushing YOU LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN. IT'S LIKE you can. AND IT'S ACTUALLY PUSHING YOU. YOUR PREDESTINATED SEAT IS IN THERE. SO THE WORD PUSHES YOU ONWARD. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE 100% THEN IT BLOWS AND IT BREATHE IN AN INFUSION INTO YOU. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WIN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HELP BUT CROSS OVER. GLORY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT HIM BEHIND YOU LIKE THEY DID IN ISRAEL. THEY HAD A PILLAR OF FIRE. IT WAS BLOCKING FROM ALL SIDES. EGYPT COULDN'T EVEN GET THERE UNTIL GOD LIFTED THE FLAME. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Okay, now you can go and try to pursue them." What a mockery. If Pharaoh only knew God played cat and mouse with him. &gt;&gt; Okay, now you can go and try and get them. Oh, oops. Water. You don't think that's not happening to you? &gt;&gt; You don't think THERE WAS JOB SITTING THERE? HE HAD NO IDEA THE CONVERSATION. BUT REALLY, GOD WAS JUST CAT AND MOUSE WITH THE DEVIL. OH, HELL. ALL RIGHT. I'LL LET YOU GO A LITTLE BIT LONGER. OH, OOPS. Pull you out of there. I'm going to put it back into Job. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO DOUBLE THE PORTION. &gt;&gt; Is that your God? &gt;&gt; Is he going to treat Job differently than you? You going to treat Moses and the children of Isra is Israel differently than you? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; But he's just saying give it everything. &gt;&gt; Give the two might say my everything is so small. I preached a little bit ago about the two mites. You know how much it was worth? US cents. 1/8 of a cent. That's what she gave 1/8 of a penny. You don't even make pennies anymore. They just ended a few days ago. I believe Pennsylvania printed your first penny or stamped it out or wherever it was. Cut it up into eight pieces and find the little morsel of copper and then try and pay something with that. Hey, uh, pretty hungry today. I need a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk. What do you got? Well, that looks like a speck of dust. Yeah, it's a eighth of a penny. Can it get me anywhere? Are you insane? Sometimes I think people feel like that way and they're coming to God with an eighth of a penny of their ability and you think God is saying that to you. Are you what I'm saying? I'm here to tell you tonight God is saying that's all I desire. &gt;&gt; That's all I need. I just need the everything. If it's a small, don't ever think what you have is small. God standing there looking at saying that's worth more than the world's to me. &gt;&gt; I'll give another example. Are we okay? &gt;&gt; You on your second win yet? &gt;&gt; You know I got one service. You know that. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to give it all I got. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when I hit my second win. Amen. Matthew 27 says here was a thief on the cross and what he hadn't done. I I want to imagine what what would HAVE HAPPENED IF HE HADN'T GONE THE EXTRA. WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS HE WAS THERE HANGING ON THE CROSS AND AND HE was there now with with with THIS OTHER THIEF BESIDE Jesus and they WERE THERE AND WHAT IF HE HAD NOT GONE 100% and I'm just going to tell you HE WAS SUFFERING BIG TIME ON A CROSS. NONE OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT. None of us have had know what it's like to to be hung on a cross. AND HERE HE was being being HUNG BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN AND HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT AND HIS FEET THERE NAILED OR tied or whatever it would have been and HIS STRENGTH AND HE WAS THERE MOCKING AND HE'D HAVE TO RAISE UP. YEAH. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD RAIL ON HIM. YOU CALLED YOURSELF THE SON OF GOD. AND THEN THEY'D MAYBE HEAR THE PRIEST DOWN there and be like, yeah. You know what he said? He said if he tear this temple in three days, he'd raise it up. Can you imagine the thief there on the other one railing on him? The scripture says he saved others himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him come now come down from the cross and we'll BELIEVE HIM. HE TRUSTED IN GOD. LET HIM DELIVER HIM NOW if he'll have him before he said I am the son of God. And the thieves also which were CRUCIFIED WITH HIM CAST THE SAME IN HIS TEETH. YEAH. YOU YOU SAID AND THEY WORKED hard to cast it in his teeth. King and then the other one a king and he just stand there push himself up and sack back down. But something changed and one thief continued to rail. But something happened. And the other thief in this moment in Luke, it starts to says, "But then the other answering rebuked, dust thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?" And we indeed now he's saying this back at the thief and he's working. des not fear God. And he's now working because he's at the end and he's working to spit these words out and we intate us. And I imagine if he's right there at the very last aspects of his mortal breath and he turns and he works hard. The work's still back up. Remember &gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt; when come into thy kingdom. &gt;&gt; He gave everything. everything. What if he stopped at 99%. What if he ended? I can't do it and he couldn't get out the rest. And he's one sentence away from paradise. But he gave everything. And then on the other cross another one is hanging and says today &gt;&gt; today you'll be with me &gt;&gt; in paradise. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you &gt;&gt; those last moments of Baptist life &gt;&gt; were very different. &gt;&gt; As he waited and the last breath &gt;&gt; went out from him &gt;&gt; and he took another one in paradise. &gt;&gt; Why? because he was willing to give it all. &gt;&gt; And then God came behind. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I just wonder because then there was another one that still had to give his last. &gt;&gt; And for you and I, he was there. It is finished. &gt;&gt; And he gave all. &gt;&gt; So that you and I could have another breath with that thief on the cross. If he hadn't given everything, IF HE HADN'T GAVE HIS LAST AND FINAL. AND AFTER THE LAST BREATH, GOD CAME AND INFUSED. &gt;&gt; AFTER HIS LAST BREATH IN THIS EARTH, THERE'S ANOTHER BREATH WAITING FOR YOU AND I. AFTER THE LAST BREATH IN THIS TIME, THERE'S ETERNITY WAITING FOR YOU AND I. WHY? BECAUSE HE DID IT. ARE YOU WILLING to &gt;&gt; Are you willing to &gt;&gt; wind of his spirit was released on Calvary &gt;&gt; so that her bride could be birthed &gt;&gt; and a masterpiece could be born. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now. Go to Michael. He said, "I'm very weary though. I'm so worn down with burdens." I know. He knows. Actually, he knows. And he's here tonight to say, "I'm I'm here to breathe. I'm breathing to you strength." David was There was his men fought a fight a battle or fought a battle came to Ziglaggle on the third day that the Amalachites had invaded the south and Ziglag and smitten Ziglagg and burned it with fire taking the women in captives and all that was there and slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way. So David and his men came to the city. They had just been fighting another battle and they were weary. But here they came, and behold, they saw Zigleg was burned with fire, and their their wives and their sons and their daughters were all daughters were all taken captive. And David AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WITH HIM LIFTED UP THEIR VOICE AND WEPT until they had no more power to weep. That's what scripture says. They were so sorrowful. They had been LABORING AND FIGHTING AND BATTLING AND THEY'D BEEN GOING THROUGH BATTLE AFTER BATTLE AND THEY CAME BACK JUST TO COME and maybe receive some sustenance AND AND SOME CARE AND SOME comfort and it's all gone and they begin to weep. They're fighting man. And now David castaway and David's surviving. Now he goes home and and now the worst has really happened. And while they were gone, I'm sure as they leave they're like, "Oh God, keep our family safe." and they go back home and it's it's all gone and wiped out. And David was greatly distressed for the people. And the people spake of stoning him. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SO UPSET. THINK OF IT. THESE PEOPLE IN a moment of actual anger and rage, they were going to stone David. I mean, they were following David pretty pretty strongly. But now, IN THIS MOMENT OF SORROW, THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE STONING YOU. YOU'VE LED US THIS WAY. YOU'VE LED US THIS FAR. AND NOW HERE I AM. OUR FAMILIES are gone." And they're and they're anguish. And they're fainting and they're wearying. And David, the scripture says, "But David &gt;&gt; encouraged himself in the Lord his God." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine everybody around you? &gt;&gt; You know, come on. I can imagine even hearing this AT THIS HOUR. REALLY? I'VE BEEN GOING THIS FAR DOWN THE DOWN THIS ROAD. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE THIS LONG AND THEN THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND THIS HARDSHIP HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND AND EVERYTHING IS GONE AND I'VE LEFT HOMES AND I'VE LEFT FAMILIES AND I'VE SACRIFICED AND THIS IS ALL IT'S GOTTEN ME. Someone gets so tired and weary. DAVID, I'M DONE FOLLOWING YOU. That's what they were at this place. David must have walked away, found a quiet place. He might be in a place like this. And you need to walk away in a quiet place. He pulls out maybe in his little satchel he keeps some of his most special psalms that he's wrote. He starts to pull it out. He starts to read cuz there's actually some psalms that are considered like golden psalms that actually are articulated there with a certain word. Psalm 56 and he must started reading it. He said, "Lord, I'm low." He said, "Lord, be merciful unto me, oh God, for a man would swallow me up. He fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would daily swallow me up. For they be many that fight against me, oh most high. What time I am afraid I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word. In God I have put my trust. I will not FEAR WHAT FLESH CAN DO UNTO ME. Thou tellest ME MY WANDERINGS. PUT THOU MY TEARS INTO THY BOTTLE. ARE THEY NOT IN THY BOOK? GOD, THINK ABOUT IT, LORD. PUT MY TEARS OF ANGUISH INTO A BOTTLE. CHERISH THEM. SEE MY NEED, OH GOD. YOU SEE MY GROANINGS AND MY MY FAILINGS. OH, DON'T FORGET them when I cry unto thee. Then shall my enemies turn back. FOR THIS I KNOW, FOR GOD IS WITH IS FOR ME. IN GOD WHEN I PRAISE his word. AND HE STARTS TO rehearse these and something starts to change. He starts to look back maybe when he was in a cave and he was writing there when he WAS HE WAS HUNKERED DOWN. HE SAYS, "I WILL CRY UNDER THE GOD MY MOST HIGH UNTO GOD THAT perforth all things for me. HE SHALL ASCEND FROM SEND FROM HEAVEN AND SAVE ME from the reproach." He's remembering. He's encouraging. He's saying, "Lord God, I need your strength right now. Maybe you need to encourage yourself with the Lord a little bit. You need to go back TO THOSE TIMES WHEN GOD WAS WITH YOU. BACK TO THOSE TIMES WHEN HE SAVED YOU. BACK TO THE CAVE. BACK TO THAT PLACE OF TIME WHEN GOD WHEN THE SATAN CAME ABOUT YOU, THERE'S A ROARING LINE AND GOD ENCOURAGED YOU TO SAY, "HEY, I WAS I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE. I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE. I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE. IF I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE, SOMETHING IN DAVID STARTED TO REACH OUT AND HE STARTED TO WRITE A NEW PSALM AND HE STARTED TO SAY, "OH, PRESERVE ME, OH GOD. FOR IN THEE DO I PUT MY TRUST, OH MY SOUL, THOU HAST SAID UNTO THE LORD, THOU ART MY LORD. THE LORD IS A PORTION OF MY INHERITANCE AND MY CUP. THOU MAINTAINEST MY LOT. Inspiration start bubbling out from him. Maybe tonight a little bit of inspiration needs to bubble out from you. &gt;&gt; And what happened to David? &gt;&gt; He raises up and all despair starts to fall from around him. You might be in a disaster. Just start encouraging yourself in the Lord a little bit. &gt;&gt; He walks back to the group. Very different spirit. They're all still sorrowful and crying. Maybe some still have stones in their hand. Where'd you go? I was just encouraging myself and the Lord a little bit. I just wrote a new psalm. Said, "Well, what do you have to say about this?" He says, "Call the priest." He says, "Pray, bring me hither and ephod." Abathar brought these ephod. And David inquired of the Lord, "Shall I pursue AFTER THIS TROOP? SHALL I OVERTAKE THEM? SHALL I GO AND GET THEM? SHALL I RAISE UP AND GO AFTER MY RIGHTFUL POSSESSION? HE SAYS, AND HE ANSWERED, PURSUE, FOR THOU SHALT OVERTAKE THEM AND WITHOUT FAIL RECOVER ALL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE LORD DOES. YOU START REALIZING THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN AN OVERCOMER. YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE WORD AND IT'LL TELL YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN, GO PURSUE. GO TAKE YOUR INHERITANCE. GO TAKE IT BECAUSE I'VE DECREED THROUGH MY WORD YOU SHALL RECOVER ALL. &gt;&gt; PURSUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. PURSUE THE DEVIL TONIGHT. TAKE WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS. MAY GOD BREATHE INTO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WERE WEARY. They were down LIKE THIS. THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET THEIR WIND. Are you kidding me? I just fought a battle after battle and I don't even have vituals. No, but the word just said that we can we can pursue and get it all. &gt;&gt; Well, in that case, let's go. &gt;&gt; In that case, let's go. &gt;&gt; You're more than overcomers. GOD'S ALREADY WON THE BATTLE FOR YOU. HE DID IT ON CALVARY. HE SAID, "I'M YOUR HEALER OF ALL DISEASES. GET UP &gt;&gt; AND IN BE INFUSED TONIGHT. TAKE WHAT'S YOURS. THIS BLOOD TOKEN IS ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU NEED OF. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD DAVID TO GO AND PURSUE IS THE SAME GOD HERE TONIGHT SAYING, "PURSUE." &gt;&gt; YOU JUST need to RECEIVE IT TONIGHT. MAYBE YOU NEED TO STAND ON YOUR FEET LIKE THESE BROTHERS. MAYBE YOU NEED TO ACCEPT IT TONIGHT AND SAY, "LORD, I'M A LITTLE WEARY. I'M A LITTLE LOW. I'VE BEEN THROUGH A WHOLE LOT TONIGHT, BUT THIS IS MY HOUR. I NEED A SECOND WIN. IF &gt;&gt; GOD COULD GIVE IT to to a David, he'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; He'll give it to you. He'll give it to me. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A DEBTOR TO NO MAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE WEARY. &gt;&gt; Fate not. &gt;&gt; God's got some dry bones coming to life right here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can just worship him. YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER MICHAEL." BUT THEY WENT OVER AND PURSUED. You can still stand. I'm closed. The musicians can come. He said, "I don't know if I even have the strength to stand. I'm so tired." Yeah. Some couldn't even get across the river. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You couldn't even get up across the river. I've been walking this road so long. Let the younger ones go. They can do it. There wasn't no knocking against them. They were tired. I have a scripture for you. Because there were believers in Acts two that received an infusing of God. The wind blew mighty rushing wind. But in Acts 4, I believe it was Peter and John. And I think Peter, they were they were let go out of prison. And they went to their own company, the scripture says, and reported to all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. And when they had heard that, they lifted up their voice to God, and they started to pray. Maybe a little praying tonight with one accord and said, Lord God, thou art God, which hast made heaven and earth, and sea, and all that is IN THEM. WHO BY THE MOUTH OF THY SERVANT DAVID HAS SAID, WHY DID THE HEATHEN RAGE? And the people imagine vain things. The kings OF THE EARTH STOOD UP AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED together against the Lord, against his Christ. For of a truth, against a holy child Jesus, whom thou HAST ANOINTED. THIS IS THEIR PRAYER. IN ONE MIND AND ACCORD BOTH HEROD AND PONTIUS PILATE AND THE GENTILES AND PEOPLE OF ISRAEL were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand AND THY COUNSEL DETERMINED BEFORE TO BE DONE. OH LORD, BEHOLD their threatenings. Oh Lord, BEHOLD MY CHILD. BEHOLD, what's going in my life, MY FAMILY, MY ISSUES HERE, MY MY SICKNESS, MY DISEASE. OH GOD, BEHOLD THE THREATENINGS. They'd been they' had a Holy Ghost experience just a couple chapters ago. They're saying, "Oh, God, we're weary. We're being threatened. WE'RE WORN DOWN. OUR NERVES ARE SHOT. WE'VE BEEN HIDING HERE AND HIDING, RACING HERE, PREACHING HERE, AND THEN GETTING CAUGHT THERE AND PRAYING TO GET THIS ONE OUT OF JAIL THERE. OH GOD, grant to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thy hand. Lord, we need boldness. We need a little show of your glory among us again. We need a little outpouring. WE NEED A LITTLE SECOND WIND. WE NEED ANOTHER ANOINTING THAT YOU COULD JUST BLOW THROUGH. It says, "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness." This was another breathing, if I could say, a second wind of his spirit blew through. They had a feeling at Pentecost at Acts 2, but Acts four came along and said, "Lord, I need a little more. I need a little more strength tonight. I've been down this road a little long. I've been laboring and I've been cutting through and I've BEEN LIKE DAVID, BUT I NEED a little bit of an infusion tonight. Maybe tonight the people of God need to raise up a voice and start to pray. You can lift up your voice tonight and SAY, "OH GOD, I ALSO NEED A SECOND WIND TONIGHT. I ALSO NEED AN INFUSION. I'VE GIVEN YOU MY HEART. I'VE LAID IT AT YOUR FEET TONIGHT. I NEED THE WIND OF YOUR SPIRIT TO BLOW THROUGH." That's what he can do tonight. But it's in your hands now. It's out of my hands. IT'S IN YOUR HANDS. GOD HAS NOW LAID IT TO YOU AND SAY NOW CRY OUT. MAYBE YOU NEED TO BE A BLIND BARNAMEUS. Maybe you need to be a Ruth or an Esther. It's to you now. It's in your hands. He's here to do everything you have asked and need for. I believe it with all my heart. This is your meeting. This is your hour. This is your moment. May a second wind blow right here. Oh god. Now is the critical moment. Actually, now is the critical moment. It's that moment where it passes between the preacher and the people and Satan desires to get right in the middle. But I believe the Holy Spirit is healed greater. The Holy Holy Ghost is here's greater. So I pray oh God tonight whatever whatever Lord you desire to do Lord may nothing here hinder your moving now. Hallelujah. Let's just sing peace like a river. Peace like a river. I just let's just mind the Lord right here right now. Peace like a river. River and love like a mountain. Oh, the wind wind of your spirit. Oh, it's blowing everywhere. Why don't you reach out? You're alive like a fountain and heing streams of life. Oh come, Holy Spirit, let your fire. Amen. Let's sing that to him. Let be that your prayer tonight. Oh peace, peace like a river. Oh love like oh a mountain and the wind of your spirit it is blowing everywhere. Oh, and joy, joy like a fountain. Oh, and he streams of life. Oh, come home. The spirit let you fire. Maybe before we sing it one more time just to let the Holy Spirit brood. I just ponder and I I thought last night how many of the young younger ones maybe came to the front and they're wanting to give their hearts. Brother Tom was laboring. Even brother Matthew McGee saying to somebody, would you like to just give your heart to the Lord? And maybe tonight it's maybe you have given your heart to the Lord, but you need a second win tonight. Maybe you're someone who's labored for a long time. You've been in this message a long time. YOU'VE LABORED STRONG AND HARD AND YOU are a mighty VO WARRIOR. BUT TONIGHT HE'S SAYING, "LORD, I just need another breath. I need another filling of your spirit to help me move MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT. IF I can say that's your night tonight." He's here to do that tonight. Don't lose the moment. Don't don't don't lose or miss this opportunity to say, "Lord, to reach out and just let the wind of his spirit blow over your life. Don't walk out of here weary. You can walk out of here strengthened. You can walk out of here like DAVID DID. I'M READY TO pursue because he encouraged himself in the Lord. If you need prayer, you want to be in kneel in your seat. This is what this whole weekend is about. This moment, last night's moment, tomorrow morning's moment, whatever that would be, whatever God has. But tonight, don't miss this hour. You do as God lead you tonight. now. Oh, and peace like a river. And love like like a mountain. Oh, the wind of your spirit it is blowing blowing everywhere. Oh, and joy joy like oh a fountain. Oh, and heing streams come alive. Oh, this is my prayer. Come, come, holy spirit and let your fire fall welcome. Holy Spirit come. Come holy spirit let your fire your dad. Don't approach him like a sinner. He said you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You've been to the altar. You've confessed your sins. He said that he was faithful &gt;&gt; and just to forgive them. Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; Cuz the seed of God remains in them. So our brother talked about that first breath that gave us this life. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, came into the world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; But that's not who we really are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Way back in the beginning, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew you then. &gt;&gt; The color of your eyes, &gt;&gt; the color of your hair, &gt;&gt; the statue you were in. That's when he slipped the wedding band of predestination on you. He wanted us to know that Calvary paid the price that allows us to go past our flesh, past our history. Do you hear what our brother said? It don't matter what you've done. It doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't Don't look back at that. &gt;&gt; Don't wrecking yourself a sinner. wrecking yourself saved. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you are a sinner, then maybe you need to come to the altar. Reckon yourself a sinner. Say you're sorry. &gt;&gt; And if you say you're sorry, he said, "I'm just faithful to forgive you." &gt;&gt; Don't substitute the promise for a human action. take him at his word. Our brother said tonight, he said, "Our life, our history, our past was the result of the breath that we got from our first husband. I don't care who you are, your natural record isn't very good. But the gift of God &gt;&gt; is a second breath. &gt;&gt; Scripture says Jesus walked into the room and he breathed on him and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Are you willing to lay down your first breath tonight? It doesn't do you any good to keep laying down that first breath &gt;&gt; over and over again. &gt;&gt; Why don't you take a breath, &gt;&gt; a different breath? You can do that right where you're sitting. Say, "Lord, I want this breath. &gt;&gt; I want to breathe it in. I can't have it schooled into me. I can't come up with the formula. I've repented. I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You said I shall receive &gt;&gt; this breath of life. And here I am. Father, I need a revival. &gt;&gt; Lord, that was just for me tonight. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for anybody in this building, Father, it was for me. Give me that second breath that I'll keep going. &gt;&gt; I'll keep preaching. &gt;&gt; I'll keep traveling. I'll quit keep talking to to souls. &gt;&gt; I'll do all that I can. &gt;&gt; For the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Say that to yourself tonight. &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself in the Lord. Don't look at that old man. He's not looking at it. He's looking at you for who you really are. And he wants to give you that breath of life. You know our theme song is only believe all things are possible. Do you believe all things are possible tonight? &gt;&gt; I am tired of Satan keep running us down and pointing out our past. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of him accusing the elect. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I told Mike, I said today, I said, "I I'm going to preach a message called Faith in the Accusation." &gt;&gt; Why do you believe what he said? &gt;&gt; Every day he's going to tell you, "You're no good. &gt;&gt; You're rotten. You're worthless. You're a sinner. You're a failure. You never do nothing right. You're just God doesn't love you. You're terrible. Now, how many believe that's the truth? &gt;&gt; I don't. &gt;&gt; I know I was a scoundrel. &gt;&gt; I know I am still a scoundrel. But I know he put my name &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. And I know that he promised to bring me &gt;&gt; into what he prophesied of me, &gt;&gt; which is a victorious son of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I need a breath of life &gt;&gt; to make that real to me again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Go back to the first place you ever met him. the first time that he ever talked to you and dealt with you. Mine was a rooftop. I've talked to hundreds of Christians and heard their testimonies. Matthew was alone one day in a truck and Satan said, "You're just going to go back to that television anyway." He come running through the door and said, "I'm going to kill you." We thought he was going to kill David. Me and Lesie flew out of our bed. Down the hall we went and we thought Matthew's going to go kill Davey, what had he done this time? And all we heard, we heard spash, bang, everything. He finally was done with listening to Satan. And he grabbed a big pull of bolt cutters and went out there and took a television, wherever it was, and smashed it to pieces. You want to sp smash your accuser tonight. &gt;&gt; That's what our brother's talking about. &gt;&gt; Getting a breath of life in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That smashes your accuser. &gt;&gt; And you don't listen to him no more. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's the father of all lies. &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags. There's nothing we can ever do to deserve it. &gt;&gt; Alls we can do is accept it. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm asking you tonight, do you believe he's got a second wind for you? Do you believe he knows you? He knows all about you. He knows every thought, everything you ever did. And all he's saying here tonight is let me breathe on you. That's what we need to do is open our hearts. Say, Lord, I need a revival. I need to freshen my bornag again experience. I need to apply the token to my life. I need to give my all. And I'm here to rededicate myself. I'm here to receive your breath. Breathe on me, Lord. I'm predestinated and chosen for your breath. &gt;&gt; You already got it. He's You think he knows? &gt;&gt; All right. How many believes the Lord can breathe &gt;&gt; on our sister's prayer request &gt;&gt; and make it live? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul right here, his wife had a friend whose child had leukemia. All of a sudden, he got stirred up sitting at home. I'm going to go pray for her. He went over to the hospital where they said there's no more medicine to help her. There's nothing that she can do. Six years old, Paul, &gt;&gt; six years of age. He went there and laid his hands on her. Three weeks later, he gets a phone call. There's no leukemia anywhere. &gt;&gt; Somebody came and breathed. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; somebody came and breathed. &gt;&gt; Paul believed what he said. All things are possible to them that what? Believe. &gt;&gt; Do you believe you can have a second breath? &gt;&gt; You believe your life can come back on fire for God? Do you believe that that all everything that's laid to your charge is wiped away? That you never did it in the first place? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's get the religion out and let's get the life back in. Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, I just got a song because I I I I want us to be victorious. &gt;&gt; I want us to claim it. &gt;&gt; I want us to believe in one another. &gt;&gt; I thought, you know, this has been my heart for the since January. has been a path forward. I thought, what a path that's been opened up to us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A new heart. &gt;&gt; A new breath. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A new life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He's our Lord God. &gt;&gt; Jehovah. &gt;&gt; It's that song. You know, goes about taking our Egypt, possessing our Egypt. Do you know that song? &gt;&gt; Do you believe he'll bring you out of where you are? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Our brother preached it. &gt;&gt; Yes. I mean, we can do an altar call and everybody can come to the altar and we can go through the same sorrow and the same repentance and come up. I'm a sinner. I'm no good. Lord, fill me. Lord, change me. And you can go through that cycle over and over and over again. I don't want to do that anymore. I want life. &gt;&gt; I want him to breathe on me. &gt;&gt; I want to lay yesterday down. and breathe aresh. Do you believe whatever our sister is asking for God can do? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She believes it. &gt;&gt; Yes. I could lay hands on everyone here, but if they didn't believe if they didn't accept this word, if they didn't accept their forgiveness, they get up and they tired of that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want a new life. &gt;&gt; Yes. I give you what you ask for. &gt;&gt; Your sins are remitted. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said the life of Christ &gt;&gt; was in them. whose sins you remit, they are remitted. &gt;&gt; They said the Catholic priest took that and made it carnal. &gt;&gt; But he said what it was was the divine revelation of the word of God. Why are your sins remitted? Because you never did it &gt;&gt; in THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He has no hold on you. &gt;&gt; He has no claim on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, give me that breath. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To receive that revelation. &gt;&gt; Give me that breath that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; That's the breath of life we want. &gt;&gt; Soldiers, how does that song help me sing? I won't forget the wonders of my &gt;&gt; You remember that you found me back the waters Oh, you're the God who fights for me victory. Hallelujah. Hallelu. You have to see. You have me through the hallelujah. Hallelujah. A cloud by me is a sign that you are with me. The fire by night is a guiding light to my feet. You found me. You free me. Help the waters for my relief. Oh yeah. Heat. Sing hallelujah. Hallelu. A cloud by day is a sign that you are with me. The fire by night is a guiding light to my fear. You found me. You're freeing like the water. Heat. Heat. Hallelu. You step into my You took me all the way. You lost me out in freedom into the promised land. Now I will not forget you. I sing of all you make me smile forever. Hallelujah. Your son We are not defeated. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Take that new breath. Take that new breath. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Oh, you're the kind of price for me victory. Hallelujah. You have brought a prophecy to the king. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ah, do you believe he's fighting for you? &gt;&gt; You know he's not going to lose a one. &gt;&gt; We need to have victory &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; It's not the picture that Satan draws. &gt;&gt; That's reality. It's what God said &gt;&gt; is reality. &gt;&gt; Satan says you're sick. &gt;&gt; The doctor told me you've got a non-contagious chest infection. Whatever you do, just lay down for a few days. Don't get up and drink lots of water. &gt;&gt; I wasn't ready for that breath. My &gt;&gt; I was ready for this breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan said, "You go up there, you're going to start coughing." Well, Satan, I ain't going to stop. I'll I'll cough and praise God. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We've got to get rid of the negativity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never have a negative thought. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hey, &gt;&gt; we've been loathing ourselves for too long. &gt;&gt; David had a lot of reason to look back, but he accepted &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord. He accepted his pardon. &gt;&gt; Do you accept your pardon tonight? &gt;&gt; You can either look back or you can take a breath tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go home and apply the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go to that closet and throw out the high heels, throw out the makeup, throw out the jewelry. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; throw out the scissors. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can go home tonight, throw down your games. &gt;&gt; Get rid of your whatever you have on your machines, I guess, computers, whatever's there. You say, "How am I going to do that?" By the breath, &gt;&gt; by the new breath, &gt;&gt; that he's going to breathe into me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe you can put a breath in me tonight &gt;&gt; to make me victorious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "When's he going to give it to you? Today? Tomorrow? &gt;&gt; The next day?" &gt;&gt; It's not a one-time breath. The same natural breath that keeps you alive is the same spiritual breath &gt;&gt; that keeps you alive. &gt;&gt; Read your Bibles, &gt;&gt; pray, &gt;&gt; listen &gt;&gt; to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And live. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to live? &gt;&gt; Is victory yours? &gt;&gt; Can you sing, Victory is mine? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these people are coming to the altar because they know there's a God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That'll hear their prayer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Will you join your faith &gt;&gt; with their request? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know what God can do. &gt;&gt; I can't even testify, brother Matt, how dark I was. But you know something? &gt;&gt; That's not how he looked at me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He looked at me through the blood. &gt;&gt; He looks at you tonight through his blood. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to walk out here a sinner. &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk out here delivered. &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk out here. So, Lord, I don't know where you want me to do. I don't know what direction I'm going to. I just know I want to go forward. &gt;&gt; And I'm trusting that this breath that my brother spoke about &gt;&gt; will lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll put enthusiasm in me. &gt;&gt; It'll speak to me. &gt;&gt; It'll convict me of sin. &gt;&gt; It'll reveal the word to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to live by the natural man. &gt;&gt; I'm going to live by every promise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the book. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like he addressed that message to Christian Life Tabernacle tonight. &gt;&gt; Our visitors, whatever choice you make. &gt;&gt; But as for me in my house, &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want new life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To serve the Lord. Brother Billy, would you help me sing that? I tonight, I believe that victory is mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe every person that's at this altar has already been promised &gt;&gt; by predestination. &gt;&gt; Victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe they'll rise up and because they made this trip to the altar that God's going to start ordering their footsteps in their life. &gt;&gt; They're going to start putting the puzzle together. He's going to start leading them and guiding them and they're going to find themselves in the joy of the Lord &gt;&gt; cuz victory is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose &gt;&gt; a one. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I believe that &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Saints of the living God. Do what our brother said. &gt;&gt; Give your all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I woke up this morning. I hope tomorrow this song is on your heart. Oh, when I woke up this morning, I didn't have a doubt. And I knew that the Lord would bring me out. So I got down on my knees. I pray, Lord, help me. This is the part my God. I sing. Oh, victory is victory. Oh, victory. Claim somebody. Put somebody on your heart. Say, they're going to get the victory. They're going to get their healing. They're going to get their deliverance. Speak out the word. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's about time we tell him to take a hike. Praise God. Oh, today I &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tonight, &gt;&gt; don't Listen to the liar. &gt;&gt; Do not have faith in the accusation. &gt;&gt; Satan is an accuser of the brethren. Seeking whom he may devour. Remember, he can't lay anything to your charge because the blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; has cleansed you &gt;&gt; and he has given you his spirit. &gt;&gt; Satan is not going to admit you've got the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; You can let your hair grow long. He'll say you're a hypocrite. You can let your dresses, you can get rid of the makeup, you can apply the token into your life. He's never going to admit that you're born again. &gt;&gt; So, if you're looking for him, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; to give you some sort of star of approval, &gt;&gt; forget it. &gt;&gt; I have news for you. Satan hates you. &gt;&gt; That's me. And he's not going to quit tempting you. &gt;&gt; He's not going to quit lying to you. He's not going to try to quit deceiving you. All you need is a second wind. &gt;&gt; Take a deep breath. Says, "Satan, &gt;&gt; I'm done." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With you. I'm done with you. &gt;&gt; You lie. You cheat. There's no good thing in you. I You've casted your vote against me. Jesus Christ has casted his vote for me. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; who you going to believe? God who said you're clean, &gt;&gt; you never did it in the first place, &gt;&gt; who revealed the word of God for you for the hour. &gt;&gt; Or are you going to believe the liar? &gt;&gt; If you start believing him, he'll drive you crazy. &gt;&gt; I believe this. &gt;&gt; Let's go forward. Let's come back tomorrow, believers. ready to receive instruction, &gt;&gt; to listen and hear and take a new path forward in his name. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. We have food. Some of it might be leftover from this afternoon, but leftovers are pretty good if you're hungry. Amen. &gt;&gt; They've been preaching this gospel for 2,000 years and it filled my soul tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to ask a blessing on the food. They'll have something. Sandwiches, uh maybe a piece of meat and a piece of bread, maybe one or two noodles, a couple beans. We don't care. Where there's any, there's plenty. &gt;&gt; And and if, buts, and wise are all Satan's lies. Let's bow our heads. Let's walk away from this building tonight believing who we are, &gt;&gt; the redeemed and purchased of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us pray. our heavenly father. Lord, though you rebuked me tonight and you chassened me, Father, Father, I'm thankful that you spoke to my heart and said that I could have new life. I could have new vigor. I could have new energy. I can have new leadership. I can have new direction. No matter how bumpy the road, you're going to take me all the way down it until you put me back on the path that you want me. I'm going to take that breath. I'm going to breathe it in. It can't be schooled. It can only be God-given. And I believe, Father, you gave the opportunity to me personally tonight. I hope each believer here will leave those things which are behind behind and press to the higher mark in the higher calling in Christ Jesus. Thank you, Father, for touching these hearts that came to the altar to giving victory and and Lord, let the possibility reign in our hearts that all things are possible. We love you. We thank you. We ask you to bless our food, bless our fellowship. Father, place within us a positive heart, encouraging ourselves in the Lord with a word of praise on our lips. We believe it and we say, "Amen." God bless you tonight. Go in peace. Amen. Amen. What's that song like? Let's sing joyous. Amen. How many believe Joy is the flag? Hallelujah.
