[41:48] heavenly father lord we're approaching

[41:56] meet us lord at the point of our need

[42:13] that
[42:14] lord we won't never let the spirit of
[42:17] revival die lord
[42:18] so we pray oh god that you would revive
[42:21] our heart tonight
[42:22] lord give us a clear vision lord help us
[42:25] oh god to see you
[42:27] and what you want done lord we're just
[42:29] committing the service to you
[42:31] lord we're asking lord that the special
[42:34] requests that are upon the heart lord
[42:36] here and
[42:37] over the stream and the wire lord god we
[42:40] know that you're a god that's not
[42:44] fettered by time lord so we just commit
[42:47] all the needs to you
[42:48] lord committing this service from
[42:50] beginning to end to your hand in jesus
[42:52] christ's name
[42:53] amen amen
[42:56] wonderful so uh happy to hear the
[43:00] worship
[43:01] he's certainly worthy of all the praise
[43:04] and all the honor to his name such a
[43:08] privilege
[43:09] to live in a time where
[43:12] god has anointed us to see the things
[43:15] that we see
[43:17] and hear the things that we hear we are
[43:19] definitely a privileged people
[43:22] amen i just want to take a little
[43:26] thought that uh lord placed on my heart
[43:28] i was um
[43:29] thinking about you know the service
[43:31] brother david had about
[43:33] you know um god never called in a man
[43:36] until he first
[43:37] warned him and then even a service prior
[43:41] to that
[43:42] about the frontline workers and
[43:44] something just
[43:46] struck my heart that just maybe if the
[43:49] lord will help us we just want to share
[43:50] a little something
[43:52] and we'll just take the scripture out of
[43:55] ephesians
[43:56] um chapter six
[43:59] where we'll begin and just as he was
[44:02] preaching about the front line workers
[44:05] he had made a statement that
[44:11] he said well where is the front line
[44:14] and so something began to stir in my
[44:16] heart and
[44:17] you know it's and then he said brother
[44:20] branham said in that message
[44:22] that we listened to on sunday he said
[44:25] um you know we ought to go to him and
[44:27] find out
[44:28] what he wants done and so you know we
[44:31] take those
[44:32] those challenges personal you know and
[44:35] we
[44:36] place ourselves in the story and so
[44:39] uh tonight by his help i want to share a
[44:41] little bit about where we feel we can
[44:43] get a little closer to that front line
[44:46] amen so in ephesians
[44:49] chapter 6 and we'll start in verse 13.
[44:54] the scripture says wherefore take unto
[44:57] you the whole armor of god
[44:59] that ye may be able to stand in the evil
[45:02] day
[45:03] and having done all to stand stand
[45:06] therefore having your loins girded about
[45:08] with truth
[45:09] having on the breastplate of
[45:11] righteousness and your feet shod
[45:14] with the preparation of the gospel of
[45:16] peace
[45:17] and above all taking the shield of faith
[45:20] wherewith you may be able to quench all
[45:23] the darts
[45:24] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[45:27] the helmet of salvation
[45:29] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[45:32] word of god
[45:34] amen if we can also turn into first
[45:36] timothy chapter one
[45:45] paul was encouraging timothy no doubt
[45:50] in verse 18 first timothy 1 and 18.
[46:11] i think i wrote this scripture down
[46:13] wrong just bear with me for a second
[46:19] here it is this charge i
[46:23] commit unto thee son timothy according
[46:26] to the prophecy
[46:28] which went before on thee that thou
[46:32] that thou by them my war
[46:35] good warfare holding faith and a good
[46:39] conscience
[46:40] which some having put away concerning
[46:43] faith
[46:44] have made shipwreck of whom is
[46:47] hymenius and alexander whom i have
[46:51] delivered unto satan
[46:52] that they may learn not to blaspheme
[46:55] amen
[46:56] you may have your seats it's interesting
[46:59] the um
[47:01] the you know we're at the end time and
[47:04] the the prophet said that you know we
[47:07] didn't come here for a picnic
[47:10] we're here to fight and
[47:13] you know god's god doesn't just provide
[47:17] the whole armor of god the dress where
[47:19] of god
[47:20] so that we could just you know have an
[47:23] apparel
[47:23] that people can recognize and notice but
[47:26] we actually want to
[47:28] be those members those equipment to
[47:31] actually be utilized
[47:32] and and i just got to thinking in in
[47:36] you know as far as what the frontline
[47:38] workers in the natural there's a lot of
[47:40] people that are putting their life on
[47:42] the line
[47:43] in front of um sick people and
[47:47] you know the the chaos the thought of
[47:51] uh germs and different things like that
[47:53] now
[47:54] people in order to help them they have
[47:56] to compartmentalize their own fears
[47:59] and then they have to also realize that
[48:01] there are certain safeguards if that
[48:03] they would just apply
[48:04] what exactly they've already had as far
[48:07] as protocol
[48:08] how that those protocols are safe
[48:10] measures to guard against
[48:12] an infection or to guard against a
[48:14] disease or or an incident where now
[48:17] their life could be in peril
[48:19] and so just like the believer there's
[48:21] things in god's word that if we'll just
[48:23] stay right with the word of god
[48:25] we don't have to fear nothing we can
[48:27] just say we'll hold to the protocol
[48:30] and so we're just thinking about how you
[48:33] know we're called to
[48:34] to be uh written epistles
[48:38] right of all men we're called to shine a
[48:40] light in the dark place
[48:42] and so as as the nurses and the doctors
[48:45] are looking towards
[48:47] science and medicine and different
[48:50] things to care for their patients
[48:52] they want to be able to ask them certain
[48:54] questions to start understanding
[48:56] where they're at what sickness do they
[48:58] have and how they can
[48:59] appropriate a salve or how they can
[49:01] bring about a certain remedy
[49:03] or some kind of vaccine or whatever they
[49:05] can do to help
[49:07] and so as believers i just got to
[49:09] thinking about how
[49:10] that we can discern the things that are
[49:12] going on in the world the things that
[49:14] are affecting people that
[49:15] don't have the same resources in their
[49:18] armament in the equipment
[49:20] there's people that don't have the same
[49:22] faith
[49:23] they're not they're anointed by a
[49:25] different spirit
[49:26] and we're thankful tonight that we're a
[49:29] privileged people
[49:30] that we've heard the call to come out of
[49:32] all that chaos and all of that nonsense
[49:34] all of the human thinking all of the
[49:37] the ways of man's science and
[49:39] civilization and education
[49:41] so we can come into the promised land of
[49:43] god isn't that wonderful
[49:46] and to know that when you've come over
[49:48] the the promised land
[49:50] and now you're on the other side you can
[49:52] start making a call
[49:54] hey you can come over to this land let
[49:57] me just tell you how i did it
[49:59] not the way i think it's done but
[50:01] exactly how i
[50:02] did it and if you do the same thing
[50:06] god is obligated to bring the same
[50:08] results
[50:09] because god is not a respecter of
[50:11] persons amen
[50:15] there's such a wonderful atmosphere here
[50:17] tonight i just thank god
[50:20] you know i just me as a man i feel so
[50:23] insufficient
[50:25] but we know that god's faithful and so
[50:27] we just
[50:28] we just trust in him we'll just ease our
[50:31] way and
[50:31] and just trust the lord's hand so this
[50:34] the scripture that we read there is and
[50:37] the thought that just kind of was
[50:39] striking my
[50:40] heart is to stand in the evil day
[50:43] and and we're anointed and you know
[50:45] there is an
[50:46] anointing that comes and it even can
[50:49] anoint those that don't have
[50:52] the life of christ now they're going to
[50:54] carry out a job they're going to carry
[50:56] out a commission also
[50:58] because there's going to be a people
[50:59] that actually stand against you and me
[51:02] as we're walking in life they're they're
[51:04] anointed for the job to stand against us
[51:07] but there's nothing that can stand
[51:09] against this word and win
[51:11] it's it's this is undefeatable
[51:15] so we just want to stay with what it
[51:16] says
[51:18] and so you just think about paul telling
[51:21] timothy
[51:23] in the scripture there he says now
[51:25] according to the prophecies which were
[51:28] went before thee and i thought about
[51:30] that and i thought about what things
[51:32] were spoken of us
[51:34] and you know you think about things and
[51:36] paul was
[51:37] pointing he says now if you can hold to
[51:41] that
[51:41] faith and and with a good conscience
[51:45] see that you might war of good warfare
[51:49] amen that's that's what we really want
[51:51] to do we want to stand on god's word
[51:54] and we want to fight a good warfare not
[51:56] holding the truth in
[51:57] righteousness not going about just with
[52:00] uh the gospel truth like a hammer
[52:04] you know that's we've all been guilty of
[52:07] doing it
[52:08] in our ignorance but now we want to
[52:10] realize there's people that are so
[52:12] distressed they're so
[52:14] in such a chaos they they have no hope
[52:16] they're walking in darkness
[52:18] but when your life crosses their path
[52:22] there's a glimmer of hope because you're
[52:24] the light of the world
[52:29] so i've just drawn a little contrast
[52:31] between faith
[52:33] the revelation that we've received in
[52:35] this hour
[52:36] and the fear and doubt that is also in
[52:40] the world
[52:41] i mean you think of the atmosphere how
[52:44] so
[52:44] charged it is for unbelievers to
[52:48] or make believers to be walking and
[52:50] experiencing
[52:52] a shutdown you know nothing seems to be
[52:55] making sense
[52:56] everything is obscure you don't really
[52:59] understand you're just kind of rolling
[53:00] along
[53:01] going along well what's next what do we
[53:04] need to do next
[53:05] yes but we know because a
[53:08] vindicated prophet came and he spoke to
[53:11] us and he let us know clearly
[53:14] he says it's thus saith the lord they're
[53:17] going to unite
[53:19] okay there's no obscurity for us
[53:22] we have the revelation we're the time is
[53:25] short
[53:26] we're at the end things aren't just
[53:29] gonna go on and go on like the scripture
[53:31] prophesied that they would have that
[53:33] attitude
[53:34] but we don't have that attitude we know
[53:36] the hour is late we want to stand at the
[53:38] front line
[53:39] and let the people know there's a place
[53:42] of escape from the judgment that's
[53:44] coming
[53:46] amen the the scripture says
[53:50] in isaiah 59 19
[53:54] and kind of halfway through the
[53:56] scripture there
[53:59] it says when the enemy comes in like a
[54:02] flood
[54:03] the spirit of the lord shall lift up
[54:06] a standard against him hey man don't you
[54:10] feel privileged don't you feel the
[54:11] spirit of god just
[54:13] reviving your heart to the realities is
[54:16] you're that standard
[54:17] you see the world they're going on
[54:20] and and now they're being used
[54:24] as that flood that's coming in coming in
[54:27] to destroy
[54:28] coming in to stifle out the witness of
[54:31] the holy ghost
[54:32] in this hour saying surely you could
[54:34] just live any kind of
[54:36] life you can drink you can smoke you can
[54:39] do all of these things and just go to
[54:41] church and pay your tithe
[54:43] and that'll be fine but there's a
[54:46] standard that's been risen in this last
[54:48] day
[54:49] it's a people that say i'm not gonna
[54:51] take
[54:53] here a little and they're literal out of
[54:55] it i'm gonna take i want it all
[54:57] amen doesn't isn't that the heart of our
[54:59] our faith and just saying
[55:01] lord let me have it all what you have
[55:03] for me
[55:09] amen brother branham said this
[55:12] in god hiding in himself in simplicity
[55:15] and then revealing himself in the same
[55:17] he says you see
[55:18] it was wisdom that started the ball
[55:20] rolling in the muck of sin
[55:22] at the beginning for eve was seeking
[55:25] wisdom
[55:27] eve was seeking wisdom when she met
[55:30] satan
[55:31] and satan gave it to her he give it to
[55:34] her
[55:36] and wisdom is contrary to the word
[55:40] we're not asked to have wisdom
[55:43] we're asked to have faith in what has
[55:46] already been said
[55:48] amen you know we're just wanting to get
[55:50] a little closer to where we need to
[55:51] stand
[55:52] a little closer to where the front line
[55:54] is we want to just
[55:58] have faith in what already been said
[56:03] amen thinking about the
[56:06] um you know the witness of the spirit is
[56:09] so wonderful because you know
[56:11] when you're in in a question in your
[56:14] mind and
[56:15] then you're just reading scriptures and
[56:17] you're going on and you see a contrast
[56:19] then god could come and bring that
[56:21] witness like oh that's what the word
[56:23] means
[56:24] i see it made alive and so there's a
[56:26] rest there's a peace
[56:28] you know don't you thank god that he can
[56:30] give that peace that goes beyond all
[56:32] understanding though you don't
[56:34] understand what's going on
[56:35] all in the world but even in the midst
[56:38] of it
[56:39] there's peace see the world doesn't have
[56:42] that peace
[56:43] their their their peace is it's within
[56:47] the arm of flesh and what they can do in
[56:50] their armament
[56:51] but we have a different armament it's a
[56:55] supernatural armament
[57:04] you know when we see the the system
[57:08] the uniting of the church and state as
[57:11] it's coming up
[57:12] brother branham said this in the latest
[57:14] in church age about how that
[57:16] the the the fitting of those
[57:20] characteristics
[57:21] in the last age in which we live for
[57:24] example the worship of
[57:26] one god zeus and who was the chief
[57:29] father of the gods this
[57:30] forecasts the 20th century one god
[57:33] father
[57:34] father of us all religious premise that
[57:37] is set forth
[57:38] in the brotherhood of men okay and he
[57:41] says that even now is
[57:43] bringing together the pentecostals the
[57:45] catholics the jews
[57:46] hindus etc and they intend to
[57:50] to to to to a mutual
[57:54] form of worship that will increase our
[57:57] love
[57:58] understanding and care for each other
[58:00] now think about the deception
[58:02] okay so we're gonna help minister to
[58:05] somebody
[58:06] that's that that we need to be a front
[58:09] line worker going
[58:10] to render aid to somebody who doesn't
[58:13] have the present truth
[58:15] uh we just want to say okay you know
[58:17] what this whole blending where they're
[58:19] just
[58:19] watering down any truth that they're
[58:22] just gonna say
[58:23] oh you know what we're all coming
[58:24] together that we can increase and love
[58:27] one for another
[58:28] but there really there's no love if you
[58:30] don't have truth
[58:31] if i if i had my children running out in
[58:34] the street and i didn't tell them that
[58:35] there's a
[58:36] car coming that's not love there's a
[58:38] judgment
[58:39] on its road this is a
[58:43] watered-down gospel that they're trying
[58:45] to say and they're
[58:46] uniting for what well the pentecostals
[58:50] are not even striving and actually
[58:51] gaining ground
[58:52] in this union with the avowed intent
[58:57] that all all others will follow
[59:02] this very attitude was seen in the
[59:05] united nations organization
[59:08] when the leaders refused to recognize
[59:10] any one individual concept
[59:12] of spiritual worship but recommended
[59:16] putting aside the separate concepts
[59:19] with the hopes of all religions becoming
[59:21] leveled into one
[59:23] for all desire the same goal all have
[59:26] the same purpose
[59:28] and all are basically right
[59:32] this is the hour that we're living this
[59:35] is the confusion that they're promoting
[59:39] you know we want to war a good warfare
[59:42] that's a lie from the pit
[59:45] they have an anointing and they're
[59:47] carrying out their commission
[59:49] how about a people that sees their
[59:51] uniting
[59:52] sees their false doctrine and now we're
[59:55] rising up to the place where we can
[59:57] recognize
[59:58] our position on the front line we have a
[1:00:01] truth
[1:00:02] it delivers it heals it saves
[1:00:06] it brings vision it brings understanding
[1:00:17] standing in the evil day you know this
[1:00:20] day you see it
[1:00:24] there's people taking up all kinds of
[1:00:26] causes
[1:00:28] you know it's the the latest scene
[1:00:31] church ages
[1:00:32] is laid out there and it says that this
[1:00:35] is the age of people's rights
[1:00:38] and and never mind god what god sees was
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:43] never mind what god said in his word
[1:00:46] the justice is now what's justice for
[1:00:49] the people
[1:00:51] what kind of social equity can we pass
[1:00:54] out here
[1:00:55] how can we level the financial sector
[1:00:58] how can we do this and how can we do
[1:01:00] that so now they're anointed to make
[1:01:02] these stands for causes
[1:01:06] and so we want to be on the front line
[1:01:07] to be able to assist
[1:01:09] if there's somebody in need and maybe
[1:01:12] there's somebody that's still on the
[1:01:14] lam's book of life that's on that other
[1:01:16] side taking up the wrong cause
[1:01:18] we want to be able to approach them say
[1:01:21] brother
[1:01:22] this is the truth god sent a vindicated
[1:01:24] prophet
[1:01:25] that system is headed for the fire
[1:01:30] hey let's just keep it simple too you
[1:01:32] know the truth is
[1:01:34] you see it's all headed up yeah it might
[1:01:36] sound good they're giving free money now
[1:01:38] but
[1:01:39] like our pastor said there's tougher
[1:01:41] times coming
[1:01:42] this is a delayed reaction the reality
[1:01:46] is about to set in
[1:01:48] let's press in let's press into the
[1:01:50] kingdom
[1:01:51] hallelujah
[1:02:01] now they're standing and they're boldly
[1:02:04] demanding
[1:02:05] equality equality
[1:02:08] socially and financially and this is the
[1:02:11] age of the communists
[1:02:13] where all men are supposedly equal
[1:02:16] though that is only so in theory
[1:02:21] you know just because someone believes
[1:02:22] something doesn't make it right
[1:02:26] my goodness
[1:02:32] it's all headed up for that one world
[1:02:35] government
[1:02:37] that they're now setting up as we think
[1:02:40] of the city
[1:02:41] of being some great church council
[1:02:45] we we foreshadow the ecumenical move
[1:02:48] that's going to take place today
[1:02:50] wherein wherein very soon we will see
[1:02:54] the so-called
[1:02:55] christians come together indeed church
[1:02:58] and state
[1:02:58] religion politics are coming together
[1:03:03] the tares are being bound and the wheat
[1:03:06] will soon be ready for the garner
[1:03:08] amen lord if i'm doing something lord
[1:03:11] burn it out of me i want to be that
[1:03:13] ripened wheat
[1:03:15] i want to be ready for the harvest i
[1:03:17] want to be bread on this table for those
[1:03:19] who are
[1:03:19] on the front line brother come over
[1:03:23] hey man don't you feel like that don't
[1:03:25] you feel like you want purpose in your
[1:03:27] life
[1:03:27] lord fulfill your word in me
[1:03:34] this this world is headed for a burning
[1:03:39] we know the scripture says that
[1:03:42] it's thus saith the lord
[1:03:45] we know who's going to bomb the vatican
[1:03:49] and so now
[1:03:52] you know i i looked at this thing and
[1:03:55] and it just it just amazes me man when
[1:03:58] when they grab science
[1:03:59] you know one of the first times they
[1:04:01] detonated a hydrogen bomb they were kind
[1:04:03] of waiting for fallout you know they
[1:04:05] were going to do a test
[1:04:06] and it was like five megatons out in
[1:04:09] some kind of
[1:04:10] area and they they
[1:04:13] detonated in the water you know trying
[1:04:15] to minimize
[1:04:17] well water is two parts
[1:04:20] hydrogen or one part hydrogen anyway
[1:04:23] scientifically it's it's explosive
[1:04:25] oxygen
[1:04:26] is explosive and hydrogen is explosive
[1:04:28] so the fallout it turned out to be three
[1:04:30] times
[1:04:31] the magnitude of what they anticipated
[1:04:35] and the fallout was great
[1:04:37] you know we already know that
[1:04:40] they've got bombs they've got stuff that
[1:04:43] one fanatic hitting that button
[1:04:45] i mean we're sitting on a a pile of
[1:04:48] dynamite
[1:04:49] i mean the oil the gas the water i mean
[1:04:52] everybody's got uh
[1:04:54] you know those plants or whatever oh my
[1:04:56] goodness
[1:04:57] brother the judgment's in the mail
[1:05:00] let's get this urgency i mean i got
[1:05:03] co-workers i got
[1:05:04] neighbors i got family members they need
[1:05:07] to hear the truth
[1:05:09] god sent a vindicated prophet and he
[1:05:12] said
[1:05:12] come to the fountain it's flowing
[1:05:16] if you have a desire for grace come to
[1:05:19] the fountain
[1:05:22] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:25] and forever
[1:05:28] don't look at your life look at what his
[1:05:30] life did for you
[1:05:40] that front line worker
[1:05:46] that front line worker he makes his
[1:05:49] confession
[1:05:50] before men
[1:05:53] he says in matthew 10
[1:05:57] and 28 he says
[1:06:01] fear not them that shall kill the body
[1:06:05] not be able to kill the soul sometimes i
[1:06:09] think that
[1:06:10] we're kind of a little bit out of
[1:06:11] balance on that because we're
[1:06:13] kind of caught up in some things that
[1:06:15] got us earthbound
[1:06:16] the lord help me lord help me fear not
[1:06:20] them which kill the body but not
[1:06:23] able to kill the soul you see man when
[1:06:26] he was created he created
[1:06:29] and then he was put in a body he never
[1:06:31] fell
[1:06:32] in that part he failed in the natural
[1:06:35] body
[1:06:36] and so god you're part of him
[1:06:39] he the enemy cannot touch you now this
[1:06:42] whole body this whole pest house is just
[1:06:44] dirt it's earth
[1:06:48] so i don't fear of this body i got
[1:06:50] another one it doesn't have these
[1:06:52] problems this one does
[1:07:01] but rather fear him that is able to
[1:07:03] destroy
[1:07:04] both soul and body in hell
[1:07:08] brother i'm on the front line i want you
[1:07:10] to know that you know what
[1:07:11] you can go without a paycheck you can
[1:07:13] die all this stuff but fear the one that
[1:07:16] can take soul and body
[1:07:19] i mean we're we're talking on a another
[1:07:22] level here
[1:07:24] you got a soul and we got a charge we
[1:07:27] got an
[1:07:28] influence our lives are witnessing
[1:07:31] something to those are desperate
[1:07:34] to have what we have
[1:07:39] just needs one spark of life one
[1:07:42] testimony brother i i was uh
[1:07:45] you know walking along and
[1:07:48] the car hit me whatever the incident was
[1:07:51] and you know what
[1:07:52] i was at god's mercy and i someone
[1:07:54] testified to me and said if you just
[1:07:56] name the name of jesus from your heart
[1:07:59] god will heal you and someone does that
[1:08:01] and all of a sudden they're just sharing
[1:08:03] it with somebody else and they say
[1:08:04] hey wait a minute he did it for such and
[1:08:06] such and he's just like me
[1:08:09] that's how simple we want it to be we're
[1:08:11] not some super duper
[1:08:13] we're just people trusting in the grace
[1:08:16] of god
[1:08:17] in the promises of the hour
[1:08:20] you are called to lift the standard
[1:08:24] of his word you have been anointed
[1:08:27] fear not little flock it is your
[1:08:30] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:08:32] kingdom
[1:08:33] amen ain't that wonderful amen
[1:08:38] whosoever shall confess me before man
[1:08:41] him will i confess also before my father
[1:08:45] which is in heaven
[1:08:47] yeah i got to thinking about a testimony
[1:08:49] and you know it's it's really
[1:08:51] interesting i
[1:08:52] i've never in my life you know and i'm
[1:08:54] not trying to throw anybody under the
[1:08:56] bus i
[1:08:57] really appreciate certain things that
[1:08:59] that in my life when i've come into
[1:09:02] hardships really hard times my mom's
[1:09:04] always been there for me as a rascal and
[1:09:06] she did
[1:09:07] all kinds of stuff and you know that's a
[1:09:09] mother's love
[1:09:11] you know and i i just i'm telling you
[1:09:15] i i went over to
[1:09:18] drop something off this is back in march
[1:09:20] and
[1:09:22] you know i i kind of understand better
[1:09:25] now but
[1:09:25] you know i went to see and it been a
[1:09:27] while you know with the whole shutdown
[1:09:28] and things and i went to hug her and she
[1:09:30] she kind of you know she's like
[1:09:34] i was like whoa you know wait a minute
[1:09:37] this has never happened
[1:09:42] so you think about it you know how that
[1:09:46] you know you go through things and you
[1:09:48] realize wow
[1:09:50] how the enemy will try to work in our
[1:09:53] humanity
[1:09:54] how to work in our psychology the things
[1:09:56] that we feed on
[1:09:58] have an effect in our subconscious so we
[1:10:01] got to be
[1:10:02] really cautious and and guard our heart
[1:10:05] guard what goes into the eye gate guard
[1:10:08] what goes in through the ear gate
[1:10:09] so we're not just constantly looking and
[1:10:12] feeding and then just becoming
[1:10:14] like court reporters or or news
[1:10:17] reporters or you know some kind of
[1:10:20] something that's not confessing truth
[1:10:24] that is so valuable for a son or a
[1:10:27] daughter that's been restored
[1:10:29] and been brought into the economy of god
[1:10:31] to testify of truth
[1:10:33] because that's the lifeline that's the
[1:10:36] very thing that'll draw someone into a
[1:10:38] new birth
[1:10:40] please god hallelujah
[1:10:44] says think not that i am come to send
[1:10:47] peace on the earth
[1:10:49] but i have come to i have not come to
[1:10:52] send peace but a sword
[1:10:54] and so i testified to my mom that god
[1:10:57] sent a prophet and
[1:10:59] you know surely i probably could have
[1:11:00] approached things hindsight's always 20
[1:11:02] 20.
[1:11:03] so you know there's things that you do
[1:11:05] and you realize
[1:11:06] man i wish i could have approached that
[1:11:08] a little bit differently
[1:11:09] but you know if you walk with the lord
[1:11:12] long enough
[1:11:13] you see that you're his son or you're
[1:11:15] his daughter
[1:11:16] no matter how much you fail you're still
[1:11:19] his son or daughter
[1:11:21] and god will testify of his gifts
[1:11:25] god will allow circumstance to work
[1:11:28] to vindicate his truth so don't fear of
[1:11:32] making a mistake
[1:11:34] i ended up saying some things and it was
[1:11:36] years like
[1:11:37] man i really love my mom and we
[1:11:41] things got rough you know i remember
[1:11:44] my first daughter she was you know
[1:11:47] making requests because
[1:11:48] i was like i don't know what to tell her
[1:11:50] you know just grandma's sick you know
[1:11:52] there's things going on
[1:11:53] and she did get sick you know you can
[1:11:56] only say so much about a true witness
[1:11:58] before
[1:11:59] you start symptoms start showing up
[1:12:02] you know the enemy starts knocking at
[1:12:04] your door because
[1:12:06] god's not going to have his witnesses
[1:12:09] have this kind of
[1:12:13] loss for words on that but you know you
[1:12:16] follow what i'm trying to say is that
[1:12:18] you know you can only mock
[1:12:21] so long before god comes and proves his
[1:12:24] word
[1:12:26] and so you know i ended up
[1:12:29] getting a call and you know my mom had
[1:12:32] been
[1:12:32] she had gone through a surgery and it
[1:12:35] got infected it was
[1:12:36] really bad and it was looking very
[1:12:39] dark and and her hour had come and uh
[1:12:43] just been praying just
[1:12:44] asking the lord for his his mercy and
[1:12:47] his guidance and
[1:12:49] i tell you i i was able to go where she
[1:12:52] was at at the hospice and
[1:12:54] god put a scripture on my heart
[1:12:58] i just did what he said in his word i
[1:13:00] was on the front line
[1:13:02] i didn't try to i didn't try to
[1:13:06] do anything other than what he already
[1:13:09] spoke
[1:13:10] and god raised her out of that place
[1:13:14] and you realize that today when there's
[1:13:16] needs
[1:13:17] who does she call is because there's a
[1:13:20] witness in your life where god dwells
[1:13:24] what an honor what a privilege we're
[1:13:27] living at the end
[1:13:28] and we're anointed for the job god has
[1:13:31] placed
[1:13:32] confidence in your life he has given you
[1:13:34] a testimony
[1:13:36] what the power of the resurrection can
[1:13:38] do it can take you from a life of sin
[1:13:41] and unbelief and selfishness and walking
[1:13:44] your own way
[1:13:45] to yielding and letting the love of god
[1:13:48] lead you even if it comes into
[1:13:50] persecution
[1:13:52] even if it comes into mockery even if it
[1:13:55] comes into
[1:13:58] misunderstandings
[1:14:04] you know this whole mass thing you know
[1:14:06] i already heard
[1:14:08] that the head hunt the head man the head
[1:14:10] boss over there he just said
[1:14:12] he didn't want nobody to testify of
[1:14:14] their
[1:14:15] faith you know and
[1:14:18] you know it just kind of you know it's
[1:14:20] really
[1:14:21] really hard to see like if you have any
[1:14:25] kind of
[1:14:25] damage to your ear or anything like that
[1:14:28] if you have
[1:14:28] anything other than just perfect hearing
[1:14:31] if you're talking to me with a mask
[1:14:34] and i can't see your mouth man it's hard
[1:14:36] to hear you
[1:14:38] and then you give me six feet away
[1:14:42] ah but you know we'll render under
[1:14:45] caesar with caesar's
[1:14:46] but we're looking for an entrance to be
[1:14:48] on the front line
[1:14:52] i want to see the hand of god extended
[1:14:56] through these redeemed members i want to
[1:14:59] see the house full we're
[1:15:00] we got a vision for a new church i want
[1:15:03] to see
[1:15:04] the the vision of the pastor come to
[1:15:07] pass
[1:15:08] i want to get behind them i want to say
[1:15:10] lord give everything that i got let me
[1:15:12] give
[1:15:12] it
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:18] yes so man's taking up all kinds of
[1:15:22] causes
[1:15:25] because there's perception of social
[1:15:27] injustices
[1:15:29] and you know to think of the great god
[1:15:32] of glory
[1:15:33] extending his hands being nailed to a
[1:15:37] cross
[1:15:38] bridging the way that man could come
[1:15:40] back to him
[1:15:41] and man spurn that love and that grace
[1:15:47] and to think that
[1:15:50] you know the day and the hour that we're
[1:15:52] living
[1:15:54] and what we've been exposed to
[1:15:59] and how that god has manifested his word
[1:16:02] once again
[1:16:06] you know there's there's there's certain
[1:16:07] things in natural
[1:16:09] that i won't go into it very very much i
[1:16:12] don't know exactly where my time is
[1:16:15] looks like i'm already kind of there but
[1:16:18] you know there's um you know this body
[1:16:22] this body and so you know if we're going
[1:16:25] to minister aid to the world
[1:16:27] or those that we love you know the
[1:16:29] condition
[1:16:30] and the time that we're in the we want
[1:16:33] to realize
[1:16:34] okay for this cause for the shutdown and
[1:16:37] all the things that are being
[1:16:38] implemented
[1:16:39] you know people who don't have the same
[1:16:41] resources
[1:16:42] who want to see what kind of effects are
[1:16:45] transpiring
[1:16:46] in their world because if we really want
[1:16:48] to be effectual to somebody else we need
[1:16:50] to place our feet in their shoes for a
[1:16:52] moment
[1:16:52] to be able to understand if we can bring
[1:16:56] ourselves to that understanding
[1:16:58] how that they're seeing things how
[1:16:59] they're feeling things what is their
[1:17:01] mind working towards what is their hope
[1:17:03] what are they giving
[1:17:04] over to what is their faith in where
[1:17:07] does their confidence lie
[1:17:09] so we we just think about you know
[1:17:13] how that pressure you know we know that
[1:17:15] in this end time
[1:17:17] the the the there's three great burdens
[1:17:20] that that are upon this age and one was
[1:17:22] the
[1:17:23] the nervous tensions you know and and
[1:17:26] the other one was soft living
[1:17:27] and the the pressure the pressure for
[1:17:30] riches
[1:17:31] so now we're living in an evil day
[1:17:37] you know the love of money is the root
[1:17:40] of what's transpiring they want to rule
[1:17:42] because they can't get enough
[1:17:45] i mean that's an anointing
[1:17:49] so the pressures and the stresses so
[1:17:53] god made the body that if if
[1:17:56] you know you had a lion coming at you
[1:17:59] you know you would have this
[1:18:00] uh response in the body where certain
[1:18:02] other vital organs would shut down
[1:18:05] and then it would give you a burst it
[1:18:06] would give you uh
[1:18:08] adrenal rush and you would be able to i
[1:18:11] mean you could
[1:18:12] jump like probably twice as high and
[1:18:15] lift like
[1:18:15] you know so many more strength than
[1:18:18] you're capable of normally doing
[1:18:20] but this response was only supposed to
[1:18:23] transpire
[1:18:24] and and chemically there's a couple of
[1:18:26] um
[1:18:27] hormones that are released uh from
[1:18:30] there's a little gland on the kidney
[1:18:32] that um it releases adrenaline and
[1:18:35] cortisol
[1:18:36] and so these chemicals are supposed to
[1:18:40] elevate the blood pressure and and give
[1:18:42] a burst of energy
[1:18:44] and then it even enhances the brain's
[1:18:47] use of glucose
[1:18:49] and increase the ability to to
[1:18:52] substances that repair tissues so it's
[1:18:55] like okay
[1:18:56] a lion's coming boom but you're only
[1:18:58] supposed to be in that condition
[1:19:00] for just a brief moment because once
[1:19:02] you're gone then the levels can subside
[1:19:04] and you're not
[1:19:05] in fear of death
[1:19:08] just like that but now the the problem
[1:19:12] that the body has if it's constantly
[1:19:15] being bombarded
[1:19:16] with more stress and more pressure and
[1:19:19] more stress
[1:19:20] and and economic pressure or you're
[1:19:23] gonna
[1:19:24] you're gonna get sick and die pressure
[1:19:26] or
[1:19:27] or you're gonna take your kids away or
[1:19:30] or you don't have enough money to pay
[1:19:33] for this
[1:19:34] insurance if you get this virus or
[1:19:36] whatever
[1:19:38] you know and so what happens now it says
[1:19:41] that the long-term
[1:19:43] activation of this stress response
[1:19:46] system
[1:19:47] and overexposed exposure of this
[1:19:50] cortisol
[1:19:51] it actually can disrupt all of the
[1:19:54] body's processes
[1:19:57] and so we want to be aware of that well
[1:20:00] you know when we come to the front line
[1:20:02] and and realize
[1:20:03] that these people were all being put at
[1:20:06] risk
[1:20:06] because of the atmosphere that has been
[1:20:09] created around us
[1:20:11] it's it's symptoms like and and so for
[1:20:14] your nurse is going to diagnose symptoms
[1:20:16] and gather them up give them to the
[1:20:17] doctor
[1:20:18] he says well one of them the long-term
[1:20:20] stress response
[1:20:21] and exposure is is is
[1:20:24] anxiety depression
[1:20:28] digestion problems headaches heart
[1:20:30] disease sleep problems weight gain
[1:20:33] memory and concentration impairment i've
[1:20:35] been stressed
[1:20:36] has anybody else caught any of these
[1:20:39] symptoms
[1:20:40] so you know what you can go to them and
[1:20:41] say you know what i know how you feel
[1:20:44] i'm experiencing this too but you know
[1:20:47] what i want to share with you a resource
[1:20:50] this is not a coping mechanism this is
[1:20:52] not some kind of medicine
[1:20:54] this is a power to deliver this is a
[1:20:57] power that brings hope it brings peace
[1:21:00] it brings vision it brings life
[1:21:08] see we want to face the battle
[1:21:11] face the battle not just cope with it
[1:21:15] not just say well whatever's next no
[1:21:19] god has given us exceedingly precious
[1:21:22] promises
[1:21:26] amen this
[1:21:28] this pressure it causes
[1:21:32] emotional symptoms of general
[1:21:34] unhappiness
[1:21:36] moodiness irritability anger
[1:21:39] feeling overwhelmed loneliness
[1:21:41] insulation
[1:21:43] and other mental and emotional problems
[1:21:46] you know as a christian sometimes
[1:21:50] we feel these things and so what we want
[1:21:53] to do is realize
[1:21:54] we can complementalize compartmentalize
[1:21:57] those things
[1:21:58] and say you know what i can feel the
[1:21:59] feelings but that doesn't
[1:22:02] dictate my life
[1:22:05] faith is what leads me
[1:22:11] as the body perceives stress your
[1:22:13] adrenaline glands makes and releases
[1:22:15] hormone cortisol in the bloodstream
[1:22:17] this stress hormone it causes an
[1:22:21] increase in heart rate and blood
[1:22:23] pressure
[1:22:24] you know and one thing that the mayo
[1:22:26] clinic advised is
[1:22:27] you know to get a hobby i tell you what
[1:22:32] it's not a hobby but let's let's get to
[1:22:34] soul saving
[1:22:35] let's get the gospel out another one of
[1:22:38] the things that said well
[1:22:39] you know exercise i want to exercise my
[1:22:42] faith when i see the sick
[1:22:45] say by his stripes i was healed
[1:22:48] if you take god at his word he'll do the
[1:22:50] same for you
[1:22:53] he said you know reading a book and say
[1:22:56] why don't we just eat the book
[1:23:00] amen amen
[1:23:04] you know you think about things and and
[1:23:05] you wonder at it sometimes but
[1:23:08] you know man they they do these things
[1:23:10] and they go to the doctors they have
[1:23:12] great
[1:23:12] confidence in science and medicine
[1:23:14] because that's what they're taught
[1:23:15] and it's not until those things
[1:23:17] completely utterly fail you that you
[1:23:19] started looking
[1:23:20] to the side unless you were just
[1:23:22] witnessed by somebody that the truth of
[1:23:25] god's word
[1:23:26] and so i think about this time that
[1:23:29] they had questioned brother branham
[1:23:30] about you know there was a
[1:23:33] there was a certain witch doctor that
[1:23:35] all these people that would have
[1:23:36] come to her and if they did the certain
[1:23:38] ceremony that you know over 30
[1:23:41] of the people that went to the witch
[1:23:42] doctor were being healed by incurable
[1:23:44] diseases
[1:23:46] and you think wait a minute well the
[1:23:48] scripture and the question brother brown
[1:23:50] satan can't cast out satan unless his
[1:23:52] kingdom be divided so
[1:23:53] you think well how do you reconcile
[1:23:55] these things you know
[1:23:57] but you think about where we're at in
[1:23:59] time people
[1:24:01] are living by faith
[1:24:04] some of it is in their own ability some
[1:24:07] of it is in their bank account
[1:24:08] which could dwindle and then where
[1:24:10] they're at if your science and your
[1:24:12] civilization and your education
[1:24:15] fail you because it's changing there's
[1:24:17] something that doesn't change
[1:24:21] it remains the same
[1:24:24] and so they say well you know it was her
[1:24:28] approach
[1:24:30] it was the people's approach to the
[1:24:32] witch doctor
[1:24:33] that caused this god honored the
[1:24:36] faith because they believed they were
[1:24:38] approaching deity they were approaching
[1:24:40] a god
[1:24:42] and god there now so the in science
[1:24:45] they've tapped into this
[1:24:46] um effect they call it a placebo effect
[1:24:49] where if they're now they're going to
[1:24:50] have like a certain new drug or whatever
[1:24:52] they'll
[1:24:53] they'll have a test sample of thousands
[1:24:55] of people and
[1:24:56] with so many of the thousands of people
[1:24:58] they'll have the exact same looking pill
[1:25:00] and then they'll say
[1:25:01] okay without that pill is the real thing
[1:25:03] but this one over here is just sugar
[1:25:07] and so they do the test study and it's
[1:25:09] profound
[1:25:10] how many people actually whatever the
[1:25:13] the medicine was designed for now
[1:25:17] a large percent of them that took the
[1:25:19] sugar pill are good
[1:25:21] what oh my
[1:25:25] i mean the power of faith you know it
[1:25:27] was the very things that abraham feared
[1:25:29] that came upon him
[1:25:30] you know what as we're facing the things
[1:25:32] that are coming
[1:25:33] let's walk in faith believe in the
[1:25:35] promises let's not fear what man can do
[1:25:43] you know even even science is testifying
[1:25:46] about faith and how god honors faith
[1:25:50] and people try to do some kind of form
[1:25:52] of religion well i'll feed the poor i'll
[1:25:54] do this and do that those are honorable
[1:25:55] things but
[1:25:56] brother put your faith in god's word and
[1:25:59] watch him move
[1:26:00] in your life the life of your loved ones
[1:26:04] that's why i want to tell those on the
[1:26:05] front line you know what god will move
[1:26:07] for your needs
[1:26:08] and for your family it's all your hearts
[1:26:10] ever desires were
[1:26:13] he'll do exceedingly and abundantly what
[1:26:15] you can even think or imagine
[1:26:17] amen amen
[1:26:25] praise the lord you know at this
[1:26:30] i probably just try to summarize some of
[1:26:34] this
[1:26:34] and just you know we realized that
[1:26:38] as it was with you know christ's first
[1:26:41] coming
[1:26:41] and you know there was a judas and he
[1:26:44] fell for money
[1:26:45] and now there's an anointed people that
[1:26:47] are also going to follow in that same
[1:26:49] suit
[1:26:50] they're going to be very the very
[1:26:51] incarnation of that antichrist spirit
[1:26:55] but there's going to be a people that
[1:26:56] are going to be the incarnation of the
[1:26:58] living god
[1:26:59] anointed by the spirit of god and so
[1:27:04] brother brown said this in the four seal
[1:27:06] he says but
[1:27:07] when the lord appears here on earth
[1:27:09] he'll be riding a snow white horse
[1:27:12] he'll be completely fully emmanuel
[1:27:15] the word of god incarnate and see now
[1:27:18] here's the difference
[1:27:19] how much there is in them that's the
[1:27:22] difference
[1:27:23] of them notice the antichrist is a pale
[1:27:26] horse
[1:27:27] mixed colors a horse is a beast that
[1:27:30] represents a power
[1:27:33] his power is all mixed up why
[1:27:36] politics is national powers religious
[1:27:39] powers
[1:27:40] its demon power and all kinds of powers
[1:27:44] mixed together a mix pale horse was
[1:27:48] he got all kinds of powers but when
[1:27:51] jesus comes he'll be on a solid white
[1:27:54] horse the word
[1:27:58] amen this is a mixed color with his
[1:28:01] colors red
[1:28:02] white black three colors in one
[1:28:06] represented in one and the three powers
[1:28:10] represented in one the white horse the
[1:28:13] black horse
[1:28:14] the red horse three crowns and one
[1:28:18] amen i seen the crown myself stood oh
[1:28:22] and closed and i looked at it won't let
[1:28:24] me get to it
[1:28:26] on the count of the glass on it
[1:28:29] so there was with a big lock on it
[1:28:32] sitting in the case a triple count
[1:28:34] crown so you know it's true uh-huh
[1:28:38] so there he he was triple crown
[1:28:42] viker of heaven purgatory
[1:28:46] and earth and see we're living in a time
[1:28:50] where it says in revelations there's
[1:28:51] we're going to merchandise all these
[1:28:53] things the gold the silver the cinnamon
[1:28:55] the this the that the other
[1:28:56] and then it gets down and it says at the
[1:28:58] end of i think it's verse 14
[1:29:01] where it says that even the
[1:29:04] slaves and souls of man
[1:29:08] i mean we are the ones that can go to
[1:29:11] the front line
[1:29:12] and extend the lifeline brother the
[1:29:15] devil is trying to make merchandise of
[1:29:17] your soul
[1:29:19] my what a privileged people we
[1:29:22] are to shine the light of god's word
[1:29:26] if nothing else we give them an
[1:29:28] opportunity
[1:29:29] speak the truth and love if they hate
[1:29:32] you for it
[1:29:33] well they hated our lord for it
[1:29:42] you know i think that
[1:29:46] you know we want to be placing our feet
[1:29:50] and and and placing ourselves in
[1:29:53] the word um i think brother brother
[1:29:56] david said
[1:29:56] like put yourself in this story and so
[1:29:59] there was a
[1:30:01] story of a brother that was made mention
[1:30:05] and i'll try to paraphrase it because
[1:30:06] it's kind of a lengthy quote but
[1:30:08] he says in the key to the door there was
[1:30:12] a
[1:30:12] a man that kept feeling the call to the
[1:30:15] mission field in africa
[1:30:17] and he had a lovely wife and a couple of
[1:30:19] girls
[1:30:20] and they were young seven or eight and
[1:30:22] and so he just kept having this feeling
[1:30:24] that
[1:30:25] god was calling him and calling him and
[1:30:27] finally just couldn't get away from it
[1:30:30] and then he was starting to speak to his
[1:30:31] family and he said i must go
[1:30:34] and finally it came down to the showdown
[1:30:37] where he said i must go you know i think
[1:30:40] that's kind of where
[1:30:42] i stand i must stand
[1:30:45] on the front line to witness this gospel
[1:30:49] just as plain as pure and simple as it
[1:30:52] is
[1:30:53] i must go he says and then it went to
[1:30:56] the mission boards and they said oh
[1:30:58] god called me to the mission field back
[1:31:00] there in the jungles of rhodesia
[1:31:05] and in the jungles they're infested with
[1:31:07] malaria
[1:31:08] with fever with hot sun with plaguery
[1:31:12] with leprosy and all kinds of diseases
[1:31:14] back there in the jungle
[1:31:17] and that would be where he would be
[1:31:18] going for the rest of his life
[1:31:21] and so he sold his home and all that he
[1:31:25] had
[1:31:26] so the the mission board wanted to test
[1:31:29] him
[1:31:29] and said are you sure now
[1:31:33] are you sure this message is the truth
[1:31:39] we want to be certain of god because in
[1:31:41] a similar way
[1:31:43] there's things that are coming they
[1:31:45] might take our homes
[1:31:47] they might take everything we have they
[1:31:50] might try to
[1:31:51] create an atmosphere where it seems like
[1:31:53] it's all of these same
[1:31:55] perplexing things hot sun plaguery lepsy
[1:31:58] malaria fever that's kind of what the
[1:32:00] atmosphere is feeling charged now
[1:32:03] the financial burdens and all of those
[1:32:05] things but he said i'm positive
[1:32:09] see when god speaks and you know it's
[1:32:11] god you can be positive
[1:32:13] god can't lie hey man
[1:32:17] he said sir have you thought it on this
[1:32:20] manner you have two pretty little girls
[1:32:22] and a lovely wife
[1:32:23] and if you just you won't you won't pass
[1:32:26] over
[1:32:26] and then you can come back he said no
[1:32:28] that the lord told me
[1:32:31] and it is so real he said the lord
[1:32:33] called me and i don't want to leave my
[1:32:35] home
[1:32:35] i don't want to leave my church and my
[1:32:37] people but the lord called me to
[1:32:39] there in the jungle in that jungle and
[1:32:42] he said
[1:32:42] sir did you know those little girls can
[1:32:45] take yellow fever or blackwater fever
[1:32:47] and die overnight and he referred to the
[1:32:49] different people who lost their children
[1:32:51] the little ones and they were taken back
[1:32:53] there
[1:32:54] on the diseases that they had no
[1:32:56] inoculation for and he said
[1:32:58] think of leprosy oh you're pretty wife
[1:33:00] you're two girls with
[1:33:01] leprosy and that hot sun and things oh
[1:33:04] jesus see i was working on the flesh
[1:33:07] working on your conscience working on
[1:33:08] your mind that's what the devil tries to
[1:33:11] do in reason
[1:33:12] out the faith that god's placed us for
[1:33:16] to stand at the front line
[1:33:21] says aren't you afraid of the
[1:33:25] the the danger of taking your children
[1:33:28] and wife in such places
[1:33:30] and the missionaries stood there and the
[1:33:31] yellow fella the young fella
[1:33:34] with tears running down his cheeks he
[1:33:36] turned around he said
[1:33:37] my brethren my vision
[1:33:40] of god's call he said if god's called me
[1:33:44] to africa
[1:33:45] my children and family is more safe in
[1:33:48] africa
[1:33:51] than anywhere in the face of the earth
[1:33:58] amen what was it he had a key
[1:34:03] to his call he had faith in what he was
[1:34:07] talking about
[1:34:07] and i thought what a gallant remark
[1:34:11] when i first heard that my heart bounced
[1:34:14] he says
[1:34:15] if god had called me to africa and my
[1:34:17] children
[1:34:18] in leprosy and plaguery and everything
[1:34:20] else i'd be safer than anywhere else in
[1:34:22] the earth
[1:34:22] he had the key that's what it takes
[1:34:25] when you got the key there's no fear
[1:34:27] there's no doubt there's no question
[1:34:30] you don't have to ask nobody about it
[1:34:32] you know exactly
[1:34:34] amen and that's what we're asking for to
[1:34:35] god right now
[1:34:37] is god where we're at in time is this
[1:34:39] where you placed me
[1:34:41] i want to serve god with all of my heart
[1:34:43] and you know
[1:34:44] the only way we can serve god is serving
[1:34:46] his people
[1:34:48] reaching the lost standing on the front
[1:34:51] line
[1:34:51] not caring for this old bag of bones
[1:34:55] god's got it he's got provision for this
[1:34:58] guy
[1:35:03] hey man i'm gonna try to rap wrap this
[1:35:06] i just i just feel to share briefly
[1:35:10] brother brown said this and and and
[1:35:12] things that are to be
[1:35:13] you know we are the very
[1:35:16] gene of god and one of the things that
[1:35:20] we're to do
[1:35:22] is we're representatives of heaven so
[1:35:25] we're here
[1:35:26] to express god we're here to express the
[1:35:30] way he loved
[1:35:32] we're here to express the way he forgive
[1:35:35] we're here to express his kindness
[1:35:39] we're here to exp to to express
[1:35:42] when we're reviled not to revile back
[1:35:47] we're here to to offer our cloak
[1:35:50] and whatever else they ask us we want to
[1:35:52] be able to do those things
[1:35:54] and we're here to express god he says
[1:35:56] because it's our duty
[1:35:58] to express god to this nation and to
[1:36:01] this people
[1:36:02] and to this neighborhood that we're
[1:36:03] associated with
[1:36:05] amen so as we're getting ready for this
[1:36:09] build we want to remember our neighbors
[1:36:12] around here you know surely some people
[1:36:14] don't understand the hope that we have
[1:36:16] and surely it's just an inconvenience of
[1:36:18] kids crying and yelling and
[1:36:20] all the carry-ons that maybe they just
[1:36:22] they really care for
[1:36:24] but you know what we're here to express
[1:36:27] god
[1:36:27] how can we extend the hand how can we
[1:36:29] make it a little bit
[1:36:30] easier more peaceable for them
[1:36:33] now that's that's our duty and so i'll
[1:36:36] i'll wrap this up here
[1:36:38] and just invite the musicians i just
[1:36:39] have one more little thought i wanted to
[1:36:42] share with you is we're just
[1:36:45] thinking about you know
[1:36:48] you know we want to make our battles
[1:36:51] count for the lord
[1:36:53] we don't want to be just taking up arms
[1:36:54] of our own agendas and our own thinking
[1:36:57] and what we feel is necessary
[1:37:00] but now this this thought came across
[1:37:03] brother brahm in time
[1:37:04] tested memorials he said now
[1:37:09] some time ago the great caesar augustus
[1:37:12] after the great famous battle that he
[1:37:16] got the victory he won he got the
[1:37:18] victory and he was going to celebrate in
[1:37:20] rome
[1:37:21] and he said to them i want someone to
[1:37:23] ride with me some worthy man
[1:37:25] to ride by my side
[1:37:29] while i'm doing this i want some man
[1:37:32] to share these blessings with me and all
[1:37:35] the
[1:37:36] i went through the camps all the
[1:37:39] officers
[1:37:40] trimmed their plumes they polished their
[1:37:42] swords
[1:37:43] they made their armament real bright
[1:37:46] and everything they practice standing
[1:37:48] there straight
[1:37:49] and certain salutes to the king and and
[1:37:52] so forth
[1:37:53] and each one of them walked up with
[1:37:56] their big armor before him
[1:37:57] and he set out there on his throne and
[1:38:00] watching
[1:38:01] and there come up a little officer there
[1:38:04] come up an officer with his big
[1:38:06] fine plume his feather edge and stood
[1:38:09] there and made a salute
[1:38:10] and caesar he just shook his head and
[1:38:13] then he walked away
[1:38:15] and another came up and made his salute
[1:38:17] and caesar shook his head and walked
[1:38:19] away
[1:38:20] time after time soldier after soldier
[1:38:24] till finally finally way
[1:38:27] down along the line come a little
[1:38:30] footman
[1:38:31] he didn't have any shield to polish
[1:38:35] he didn't have any plume to trim but he
[1:38:38] walked
[1:38:39] in front of caesar and he didn't even
[1:38:42] know how to make the right kind of
[1:38:44] salute
[1:38:45] he just bowed his head and walked away
[1:38:48] and caesar said wait a minute
[1:38:51] come back here and he walked over there
[1:38:54] and he
[1:38:54] looked at him and he said where those
[1:38:57] scars
[1:38:58] on your face that cut
[1:39:01] that disfigure that crippled up where
[1:39:04] did you get those scars at
[1:39:06] he said i got them in the battle
[1:39:09] fighting for my lord caesar
[1:39:12] amen and he said climb up and sit down
[1:39:14] by my side
[1:39:15] you are the one that's been tested and
[1:39:18] proven
[1:39:19] hallelujah your testings and trials are
[1:39:22] not
[1:39:22] in vain saints take courage tonight he
[1:39:25] wants you to
[1:39:26] take the full armor of god realize the
[1:39:29] truth of the realities what we're going
[1:39:31] through
[1:39:31] is to battle train us to to bring us to
[1:39:34] that place where we can
[1:39:36] sit next to the lord and testify say yes
[1:39:40] i did this on the battlefront these
[1:39:42] scars
[1:39:43] it brought me to a place where now i can
[1:39:47] be adopted
[1:39:48] and you can harvest me that that ripened
[1:39:51] wheat
[1:39:52] praise the lord why don't we stand i
[1:39:55] have one
[1:39:56] closing scripture i wanted to
[1:39:59] to read in isaiah 50 9.
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:14] scripture says in isaiah 59 19 he says
[1:40:17] so
[1:40:18] shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:40:21] from the west
[1:40:22] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[1:40:26] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:40:28] flood
[1:40:29] the spirit of the lord shall raise up a
[1:40:31] standard against it
[1:40:33] and the redeemer shall come to zion
[1:40:36] and unto them that turn from the
[1:40:38] transgression in jacob
[1:40:40] saith the lord and as for me this is my
[1:40:42] covenant with them
[1:40:44] saith the lord my spirit is
[1:40:47] upon thee and my words which i have put
[1:40:50] in thy mouth
[1:40:52] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[1:40:55] out of the mouth of thy seed
[1:40:57] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[1:41:00] saith
[1:41:00] the lord from henceforth forever amen so
[1:41:05] we're just believing that
[1:41:08] tonight we got a little closer to the
[1:41:11] front line
[1:41:14] we don't have nothing to fear
[1:41:18] we have like the bible says we want to
[1:41:21] fear him who can destroy
[1:41:24] the soul and the body amen
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:30] why don't we bow our heads together if
[1:41:32] you have a need and
[1:41:34] the lord spoke to your heart and you
[1:41:36] received his witness and you feel that
[1:41:39] you want to be more dedicated to be a
[1:41:42] front-line worker and
[1:41:44] you you have a desire for souls
[1:41:47] you want to ask the lord to help you to
[1:41:49] cut away from anything that would hinder
[1:41:51] that work
[1:41:53] you would you would want to ask god to
[1:41:56] give you a vision
[1:41:57] what that looks like that you can walk
[1:41:59] into it let's just pray together
[1:42:01] heavenly father

[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:36] is
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:50] is
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] jesus
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:32] is
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:56] [Applause]
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:00] is
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:42] yes
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:52] and all i want to say
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:23] if you just take your seats in a moment
[1:46:25] i just
[1:46:27] want to make a little announcement
[1:46:33] to you all you know i i thought as as
[1:46:35] brother
[1:46:36] andrew was ministering and that song
[1:46:40] that we just sang all i want to see is
[1:46:43] jesus
[1:46:45] they can't see jesus till you either
[1:46:47] speak
[1:46:48] or move
[1:46:51] you know what i mean if they're just
[1:46:53] looking at you and you're just standing
[1:46:54] there doing nothing
[1:46:56] then they see you but when you speak or
[1:47:00] move
[1:47:01] or have an action then they see christ
[1:47:03] in you
[1:47:04] so it's just like our brother said
[1:47:06] without being there in the line without
[1:47:08] doing
[1:47:08] something without but explaining for
[1:47:11] yourself a pattern of good works
[1:47:13] without without some sort of action
[1:47:17] and even the our messenger told us he
[1:47:20] said
[1:47:20] show me your faith without your works
[1:47:23] and i'll show you my faith
[1:47:25] by my work so you can look at my actions
[1:47:28] and determine whether i believe
[1:47:30] you can hear what i say and what that i
[1:47:34] do
[1:47:34] to be able to tell whether i'm convinced
[1:47:37] or
[1:47:38] concerned or not and and so that's a
[1:47:41] very good thought tonight that
[1:47:43] that we have got to be in action
[1:47:49] i i would like uh tonight i asked
[1:47:51] brother andrew if he wanted me to make
[1:47:53] this announcement before
[1:47:55] or after he ministered and he just felt
[1:47:57] in his heart
[1:47:58] he would rather have me do it afterwards
[1:48:00] and i certainly don't want to take away
[1:48:02] from the wonderfulness
[1:48:04] of the word so you set that right in
[1:48:07] your heart
[1:48:08] i'd like just to read a little scripture
[1:48:10] to you
[1:48:11] and and and this is
[1:48:14] found in matthew 12 and you don't have
[1:48:16] to look for it you know it pretty much
[1:48:18] by heart
[1:48:19] have you not read this scripture
[1:48:22] the stone which the builders reject has
[1:48:26] become the head
[1:48:27] of the corner this is the lord's doing
[1:48:31] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:48:35] and they sought to lay hold on him
[1:48:38] but feared the people for they knew that
[1:48:41] he had spoken the parable
[1:48:43] against them and they left him
[1:48:46] and went their way and they sent
[1:48:49] unto him certain of the pharisees
[1:48:53] and of the herodians to catch him in his
[1:48:56] words
[1:48:57] and when they were come they said unto
[1:49:00] him
[1:49:01] master we know that thou art art true
[1:49:05] and charist for no man
[1:49:09] for that regardeth not the person
[1:49:12] of men but teacheth the way of
[1:49:15] god in truth is it lawful
[1:49:18] to give tribute to caesar or not
[1:49:23] shall we give or shall we not
[1:49:26] give but he knowing their
[1:49:29] hypocrisy said unto them why
[1:49:33] tempting me bring me a penny
[1:49:36] that i may see it and they brought it
[1:49:39] and he said unto them who is this image
[1:49:43] and subscription and they said
[1:49:46] unto him caesars and jesus
[1:49:49] answered and said unto them render to
[1:49:52] caesar the things that are caesar's
[1:49:55] and to god the things that are god
[1:49:58] and they marveled at him so we're gonna
[1:50:01] try
[1:50:02] to do both and so what i'd like to do
[1:50:06] is just sit with us you know our sundays
[1:50:09] are starting to get uh more people and
[1:50:13] i'm real happy with the
[1:50:14] turnout tonight it seems like people are
[1:50:17] hungry for god
[1:50:18] but i want to set in just some new
[1:50:20] safety guidelines
[1:50:22] if you could listen and and and that
[1:50:26] is to do to render to caesar the thing
[1:50:29] that they
[1:50:29] want to caesar and still give us the
[1:50:32] opportunity to render to god the things
[1:50:35] that are god
[1:50:36] you know what i mean they'd want to
[1:50:38] cover us so we couldn't sing or we
[1:50:40] couldn't praise but
[1:50:42] so these are guidelines they're not laws
[1:50:45] they're not things that we're going to
[1:50:48] enforce
[1:50:49] or arrest you but we just asked that you
[1:50:52] would help us do these things so
[1:50:54] we want to put in place some new safety
[1:50:56] guidelines
[1:50:58] and and so and we'd like to say this and
[1:51:01] we'll send an
[1:51:02] email out and reiterate them but if you
[1:51:05] are not
[1:51:06] feeling well it is better to stay home
[1:51:10] until you are less likely to catch
[1:51:13] something
[1:51:15] so if you're not feeling well then i
[1:51:18] know that's kind of hard because
[1:51:20] we want to pray for the sick but if it's
[1:51:23] something that you're not feeling well
[1:51:25] and it's you know there's a difference
[1:51:28] between having a sickness in your body
[1:51:30] or having a disease
[1:51:31] something that we can pray for and not
[1:51:34] feeling good
[1:51:35] for when you don't have the strength so
[1:51:38] if you don't feel good then
[1:51:39] it's better to stay home so you less
[1:51:41] likely
[1:51:42] if you're not as strong and that's
[1:51:45] different
[1:51:45] than if you have symptoms if you happen
[1:51:48] to have a virus symptom
[1:51:50] fever cough fatigue and when i say
[1:51:53] fatigue i don't mean being tired or lazy
[1:51:57] it's a big difference you know what i
[1:52:00] mean
[1:52:00] i mean we have people that haven't
[1:52:01] darkened the days of the
[1:52:03] the church since this thing started
[1:52:06] you know and uh uh you know i i
[1:52:10] i i hope they're well but
[1:52:14] uh but if if you know so your loss of
[1:52:16] appetite you know the symptoms it's best
[1:52:19] to stay home
[1:52:20] and we're going to try to go back in
[1:52:22] sitting
[1:52:24] as family units the best we can
[1:52:27] parents with children aunts and uncles
[1:52:29] cousins except
[1:52:31] grandparents so if we can sit as much
[1:52:33] together in a family unit
[1:52:36] as possible that's we that we would like
[1:52:40] to do we want to sanitize our hands
[1:52:43] often
[1:52:44] coming in and out of the sanctuary
[1:52:47] bathrooms except
[1:52:48] wash and sanitize your hands often
[1:52:53] now this is something that we're going
[1:52:54] to do a little different
[1:52:56] we're going to wear masks coming into
[1:52:58] church and leaving church
[1:53:01] until you're seated like in a restaurant
[1:53:05] or at work so in a restaurant you wear a
[1:53:07] mask in
[1:53:08] you sit down you take it off the feed
[1:53:11] well we're going to wear a mask in take
[1:53:13] it off to praise the lord to worship the
[1:53:15] same
[1:53:16] and defeat on god's word and say amen
[1:53:19] but when we leave we're going to put it
[1:53:21] back on
[1:53:23] so we're going to wear our mask going in
[1:53:25] and
[1:53:26] coming if you have to get up and use the
[1:53:28] restroom put your mask on go up
[1:53:30] and use it so we're going to do the
[1:53:32] little extra measures
[1:53:34] that we can do to try to make it safe
[1:53:37] for everybody i know just like our
[1:53:39] brother said tonight we're not ruled by
[1:53:41] fear
[1:53:42] but we want to we want to make it
[1:53:46] as best as possible there have been our
[1:53:49] churches and they're believers that
[1:53:50] doesn't mean they're not
[1:53:52] godly people they're really good
[1:53:55] christian people where this
[1:53:57] sickness has struck their congregations
[1:54:00] and
[1:54:01] and i'm not saying they didn't take
[1:54:03] precautions you just don't know
[1:54:06] you know what i mean so we're going to
[1:54:07] do our best we're going to try to make
[1:54:09] it comfortable
[1:54:11] so if you would like to wear a mask in
[1:54:14] church during service feel free to do it
[1:54:18] amen don't don't feel bad but if if you
[1:54:21] do take your
[1:54:22] mask off and you sit in your seat and
[1:54:25] fine and then if you
[1:54:26] get up to go or come back in and out
[1:54:28] just put your mask on
[1:54:30] and and so we'll just we'll do that put
[1:54:33] it on and off
[1:54:35] it says yeah if if you don't want to
[1:54:38] touch anything wear gloves
[1:54:40] if you don't want to get near the
[1:54:42] offering plate or touch
[1:54:43] money or or do anything wear gloves
[1:54:47] we'll do our best to provide masks and
[1:54:49] gloves
[1:54:50] please bring your own mask if you have
[1:54:53] one
[1:54:54] outside mask are your choice
[1:54:58] but let's try to keep our social
[1:55:00] distancing you know four to six
[1:55:03] feet it's probably better not to shake
[1:55:06] hands
[1:55:06] and to hug but if you can't help it
[1:55:10] i understand
[1:55:14] i mean it's like an instinct to me you
[1:55:17] know what i mean i see somebody and i
[1:55:19] just
[1:55:20] want to grab them by the neck and just
[1:55:22] give them a big old hug
[1:55:23] you know what i mean and yeah and i i
[1:55:26] i'm just not as worried
[1:55:30] but i also don't want to send a mixed
[1:55:32] signal
[1:55:34] you you know what i mean that so we want
[1:55:37] to do our best so
[1:55:39] i think the most times we're crowded is
[1:55:41] when we're going
[1:55:42] in and out of the church and when we get
[1:55:45] in the foyer
[1:55:46] so when you get outside just create a
[1:55:48] little space for you you can take your
[1:55:50] mask off outside
[1:55:52] uh where you can leave your mask on so
[1:55:56] certainly don't feel bad about that we
[1:55:59] will
[1:56:00] we will uh uh send an email out
[1:56:03] to um to uh again to
[1:56:07] everybody but also pass it along to one
[1:56:10] another
[1:56:11] if you would and so we'll we'll just do
[1:56:14] our part
[1:56:15] and it's okay so we'll render that part
[1:56:17] to caesar
[1:56:18] but because you have to wear your mask
[1:56:21] in and out i expect us to sing
[1:56:23] all the louder and clap our hands since
[1:56:26] our hands are sanitized
[1:56:28] we ought to be able to clap them louder
[1:56:31] right
[1:56:32] and and say amen so let's really uh
[1:56:36] let's really do our best just to go
[1:56:38] forward with the lord you know
[1:56:41] brother andrew was preaching i i thought
[1:56:43] about
[1:56:45] you notice that we dumped some piles of
[1:56:48] dirt
[1:56:48] out here that was not for the kids could
[1:56:51] play king of the mountain
[1:56:54] eventually that'll be watered in and
[1:56:57] become a hard
[1:56:58] service surface that we're going to park
[1:57:00] on
[1:57:01] but the gentleman that's doing
[1:57:04] that and bringing that to us we met
[1:57:07] today
[1:57:08] and we just got to talk and in the
[1:57:10] conversation
[1:57:12] uh when he was raised the catholic that
[1:57:14] like i was raised a catholic and we
[1:57:16] started talking about
[1:57:18] doing you know knowing what god's plan
[1:57:21] is for your life just like brother said
[1:57:23] tonight
[1:57:24] you ought to go ask what would you have
[1:57:27] me to do
[1:57:29] and the conversation led and we started
[1:57:32] talking about serpency
[1:57:36] and he and it's just
[1:57:39] amazing how he just latched onto it
[1:57:44] and believe it and saw it and started
[1:57:47] rehearsing scriptures
[1:57:48] back to me that that uh testified
[1:57:53] of those things and and and how
[1:57:56] uh you know and of course he began to
[1:57:59] talk about
[1:58:00] his experiences in the catholic church
[1:58:03] and
[1:58:03] how that he knew that that some of those
[1:58:06] things weren't right
[1:58:07] and how the lord's dealt with them and
[1:58:10] it's marvelous to see
[1:58:13] what we take for granted
[1:58:18] how enthused somebody is
[1:58:21] and what the truth does for him i asked
[1:58:24] him
[1:58:26] you know i said david i said
[1:58:29] are you are you
[1:58:33] like history he says yeah i like history
[1:58:35] and i like to read
[1:58:36] i said i have a book about the seven
[1:58:38] church ages that i
[1:58:40] really think you agree well this guy's
[1:58:43] really on my heart
[1:58:44] and i'd really like to see the lord
[1:58:47] bless him
[1:58:49] i gave him a message called healing
[1:58:52] thoughts the little booklet i believe
[1:58:54] brother george or somebody put that
[1:58:56] booklet together and he told me he says
[1:58:59] man i incorporate that with my
[1:59:02] my reading every day and
[1:59:05] he's just got his year pinned from aaa
[1:59:09] and
[1:59:10] he says now this is a part of my daily
[1:59:12] worship so every day he's reading the
[1:59:14] message
[1:59:15] you know what i mean and he says it's
[1:59:17] blessing him and he's gaining
[1:59:19] faith from it and i love to see god do
[1:59:22] things for people don't you
[1:59:24] i would rather see a guy come to know
[1:59:26] the lord
[1:59:27] than be healed and so i just thought the
[1:59:30] message tonight was perfect for that so
[1:59:33] let's go ahead and stand together
[1:59:35] brother andrew i didn't mean to take
[1:59:36] from your
[1:59:38] service at all but we we need to go
[1:59:40] ahead and put these things in place and
[1:59:43] do our best to
[1:59:46] do it and you know there's
[1:59:50] all kinds of things out there you know
[1:59:55] there's people that know that they're
[1:59:57] sick and they're trying to go
[1:59:58] into public places and to try to infect
[2:00:02] people and all those things well i told
[2:00:05] the companies
[2:00:05] well that's not nothing new to us satan
[2:00:08] comes to church
[2:00:09] all the time you know what i mean trying
[2:00:12] to bring division
