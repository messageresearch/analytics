Description:
The Source of Your Perfection 
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Evening Service: February 27, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that you just bring such a presence oh god and of your word to cause us lord that we may look to you for everything that we have need of and realize that the time is at the end oh god we commit everything we are and we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you let's open our bibles before you be seated we're going to read in a couple of scriptures and then you'll be seated and then we'll read uh two more uh one or two more um let's first start in matthew chapter five we read this last time we're going to start uh matthew 5. he says and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away that court let him take that cloth also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asked thee and for him that would borrow of thee turn not thy way ye have heard that it had been said that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them that that them which despisefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to to his son to rise on the evil and on the good sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what rewrote have ye do not even the public can do the same if ye salute the brighter and only and do ye more than others do not even the republican do be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect let's also turn in first corinthians chapter 13. we're gonna start from verse nine it says for i for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is prophetics come then that which is in part shall be done away with when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things amen also let's turn in hebrews chapter 6. and we're going to just read one verse hebrews chapter six and verse it says let's read verse one it says therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and the laying of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will do if god permit amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father we thank you once again tonight we perhaps father that you come by our way and speak to us that's the desire of our heart we love you and ask those things in the name of jesus christ amen command you may have your seats amen certainly enjoyed the word this morning uh i was in the back and brother david asked me what is it you know what are you going to preach on i said well you you basically just said everything i wanted to say and better so i just i was supposed to say to preach on wednesday but then with the weather [Music] it was moved the service was canceled and these are just some of the things if i could say that resonated with me from our meetings that we had in even this morning they just became so clear in my heart and so i pray that as we go through that something will speak to you last time when we spoke we spoke on moving to perfection and we read the scripture that says be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and i hope as i go through this that it would connect it with what was uh spoken this morning because i feel like the word has just been continuing and just going in a direction where god is calling up to move up in higher ground i believe that the broad is coming into a place where she comes to the realization of what the word was all about of what she was put here on earth to do and i believe as we look into the world we could the word of god when we see the events that's happening outside if we look carefully we'll see that what god is trying to do within his body and i think that's what's important recognizing what god is doing in the world is wonderful recognizing what what's happening as far as the signs are concerned is good but i want i'm more interested in what god is trying to do in me i'm more interested in what is it that god is trying to do in our midst what is it that he's wanting to take this bride and the word that is written revealed in the end time so we said be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and we made a comment that there could not be a need for perfection or there could not be a requirement for perfection unless god build it to be perfect unless god allowed it and build it so that it could get to the perfection so you can't ask perfection from something that can never reach it or you can never ask a someone who lacks something who lacks the ability who lacks the competence who lacks everything in order for them to achieve something they will need to get it from somewhere and we realize that god here as we read it says be therefore as your father in heaven is perfect in is in direct communication and saying that you are of your father and your father is perfect therefore you can also be perfect we said it last time it's not because of uh he's he's requiring perfection is because of who our father is he's saying we can be perfect because he's directly connecting you to himself he's letting you know that you can be perfect as i am perfect now uh we we read as a definition of perfection it's the process of of achieving uh either spiritual maturity of coming or coming into a perfection it's the action or the process of improving something until it's thoughtless until it's thoughtless or can come to the uh as close as possible to being without defect so and tonight i want to continue but i want to just give it a different title perhaps it would help us as we continue on even from what was spoken this morning i want to speak on the source of your perfection the source of your perfection the scripture reads in john 15 and 16 it says ye have not chosen me i have chosen you i'm speaking about the source of your perfection ye have not chosen me i have chosen you and ordained it that ye shall go forth and bring forth fruit so when we when we go when we go out of here or when we look at ourselves even tonight we have to come to an understanding even as a scripture saying god is not talking to us as human beings as we sit here with our natural senses and with our emotions spiritual stances god is communicating to us as eternal being that is trying to bring us into the realization of something he's saying that ye have not chosen me i have chosen you so if you sit here tonight the need to come into perfection is not something that wait on you for you to say well i don't understand how i'm going to get to perfection i don't know what the first step is going to be i don't know what the second step he's saying that ye have not chosen me i have chosen you in other words i will provide what is needed in order to get to perfection i know the way to perfection i have chosen you i called you to be perfect and i have chosen you to be perfect that you may bring for fruit it's not up to you it's up to my choosing it's up to my doing that you understand that i have chosen you did i know even as a pastor said this morning he knew all things when he came to choosing you there is nothing that's hidden before god there was not a sin that you had committed there was not a word that you had spoken there's nothing past present and future that you're gonna do that's gonna catch god by surprise it says well i didn't expect that from him or oh that's surprising that's not what i expected for him to do but he says i have chosen you in other words he knew you and he placed you and he predestinated you so you can be perfect i was thinking about this as i was reading uh he have not because i thought it went so well with what our pastor was speaking this morning i began to think uh you know i i when i was young i i just not even many years ago i grew up my mom had gone away when i was around four or five years old and i hadn't had a chance to talk to her in many years and and after so many years i believe i was maybe 20 or so years um i had a chance to talk with her on the phone and and and you know and you pick up the phone and you feel there's no connection you're trying to talk and and you you're just trying to figure out where to start and and things like that and and then but then we began to talk and talk and and she would ask me a question or ask me something and i will remain quiet and just not know what kind of answer to give and everything and and and she would say she made a comment she's like you know that's just how you were when you were a kid it said you know when you you heard something you didn't like you would go you will shut completely down and here i am in my 30s and i thought i had changed and i thought you know i had progressed i had matured and everything and something can be spoken about me when i was young and directly i can relate to that even in my older age something would directly connect and i'll say well i don't know i wonder how she knew that we'll talk and then she'll say something and and she will drop and and finally you begin to realize that she knew more about me than i knew about myself and i'm here to announce to you my brother my sister god knows more about you that you even know about yourself sometimes we think we surprise ourselves on some of the things we do you do something you're like well whether it be good or bad oh i didn't expect i didn't know i could do that i didn't know i had that ability to understand it so i didn't know i could either do that or or things like that that's in the human realm but i want to tell you this morning god knew the seed that he had planted god knew what he had planted it is nothing you can do that will surprise him in fact he knows more about you than you know about yourself we go through situations we go we try to figure out things you know every day when there's a new something new that comes up it seems like it's the end of our lives i don't know how i'm gonna get out of this i don't know how this is going to go but yet god comes and he takes you out of it oh something else happening like i think i'm stuck and this is the end of me and god comes and he takes you out of it why he knows where he's taking you all he's asking is for you to follow his leading as we heard this morning that the children of god are those that are led by the spirit of god so i want to say this morning tonight we can take all the understanding of everything that we are we can look at everything that we do we can sum up everything about us and come to a conclusion that regardless of what we have done regardless of what we're going to do god has chosen us and why is that important because it answers the question about all your humanity about all of your thinking about all the possibility that could you you could lay before you if you can come to an understanding that it doesn't matter what happens to me god has chosen me he answers all the questions of life it completely answers everything so you can be at peace to know that as i'm walking he's walking with me if he had chosen me he's not gonna leave me he's gonna walk with me in the morning he's gonna walk me with me at night he's going to be with me every day now but one of them speaks now listen he speaks about perfection he's in the message water waters of separation this is what he says he says god looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner now this is i'm talking about your source of perfection he's saying as he looks through through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed amen you are redeemed because he's always seen you through the blood of through christ that's the reason we can be perfect the reason we can be perfect tonight is because god when he looks at you he sees you through the blood of christ and he says that's how we could be perfect not perfection not perfect in a sense of sinless we are perfect in the eyes of god when we are in christ hallelujah oh it's not about being sinless what i cannot do wrong here my thoughts are always perfect no as long as we are in this place we'll be caught up in those things as long as we are perfect we'll think wrong we'll do wrong and we'll be caught up in things we shouldn't be and all of that but as far as god is concerned when he has chosen you he chose you in christ and in christ it's already done in christ there's nothing to be added in christ it's already finished in christ he paid the price that was supposed to be paid in christ he died for you in christ he made you sing less in christ he provided everything that was needed in order for you to appear sinless before him not perfect in a sense of sinless we are perfect in the ass of god when we are in christ that's the reason he said be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect paul in the 10th chapter of hebrews trying to explain uh the law having a shadow of good things to come not very not the very image of things that could ever make the comer unto perfection because god was looking through animal blood but how he looked through the blood of his son perfection by it says perfection comes by christ jesus or by jesus christ and yes and i want to ask who's jesus christ the word perfection comes to jesus christ who is jesus christ the word in other words when you believe the word when you let the word work inside of you when you believe it you walk by it you talk by it when you let the world change you when you let the world brings you in the image of what god predestinated for you that's how you become perfect now he continues on he says now i'm not perfect in your sight i love this you may not be perfect in my sight but what about in god's sight you may look and says i know the failings of that one i know him very well i know they're not perfect and you can i can look at you and say the same in all the things but the things that we have to consider it's not in one and other sites that matters that's why the scripture says we are foolish to compare one with another but what we need to look in god's economy to look at in god's sight and he says that's where he lays if you are born again in the body of christ then god looks upon you as a perfect as perfect as christ was himself amen nothing you can do it's not by our any uh by any of our works you can do it all by grace it says by grace it's by grace god has give as give you this offer he says and if you accept it in the sight of god you are perfect if you accept this word tonight oh what a privilege to know that if we accept a message the word that god has sent us in this end time automatically you are perfect in his sight we're not perfect because we're better than the world and because we don't do anything wrong we are perfect because the word cleanses us why because the word takes away the desires of the world the word that takes away the nature of the word it keeps us pure and it causes us to obey his commandment amen it says accept a you you've accepted it and in the sight of god you are perfect redeemed washed in the blood of the lamb without fault without blame without blemish without spot isn't that marvelous he asked and and the scripture says i was thinking in first first peter 1 and 23 says being born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever being born again not of corruptible seed but it says by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever in other words if you are born by the word of god you live forever if you are born of the word of god you abide it forever why because if he lives you shall live also why because everything that god is you become why because the nature that god was and and even the scripture tells us heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away being born by the word causes that you can be eternal now the scripture says here and i'm not going to read through all of it in luke chapter 8 it speaks about the parable of the sower it says and i'll read from verse 4 he says and it talks about the man who came and chose it it says and much people gathered together and and came to him out of every city and speak any spec by by parable and soul went out to sow his seed and he sold some fell on the wayside and it was trodden down and the falls of the air devouted and some fell upon the rock and as as soon as it sprung up it was a weathered away because of lack of moisture and some fell upon the torn and the tone sprung up with it and choked it another fell on good ground and sprung up and bare fruits and a hundred fold and when he had said these things he cried and he had and he had the ear to he he that has an ear let him hear and his disciple asked him and saying what what might this parable be and he said unto unto he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to others but to others in parable that seeing that they might not see and hear that they may not understand now i i think this becomes very important because we i think as we advance more and more we see that this message is not understood by intellect and only those that came in by revelation will remain at the end because we can see how much the intellect people or those that enter in by intellect how their intellect is falling down how all of those things that people perceived and the understanding that they had and and and what they thought that they knew because they had believed and and somebody came and told them something different and they walked away but you realize even we can say this here he is in saying that i'm speaking such so that only a particular group of people will understand this i'm saying these things the way i'm saying it's because it's not given for everybody to believe it's not given for everybody to receive what i'm saying but this is said in such a way that it will only catch a certain group of people that i have in mind and and i begin to think even you know we think about the message of the hour and the things that uh the prophet came in his life and the things that he preached now we can look at the first bull and realize that everybody accepted it why because it had to do with the flesh you hold someone by the hand and you you tell them what sicknesses they had and all those things and people looked at it and they were attracted by it when the second bull came the discerning of the spirit saying something that only you knew again still within the flesh and the spirit realm where a man who was somewhere who only knew who was there and knew that nobody else knew this but someone could tell you that you would believe that too but oh when he came to the third pool he began to think or to speak about a certain description that was never heard before he began to talk about the seed of god that was predestinated before the beginning and he had nothing to do with the flesh he had nothing to do with the spirit of man all he had to do is you had to believe the word and let it come to pass no connection in fact it will come to say that i say these things and others will go away i say these things others will be driven away others will question why is this but he's saying it knowing that it's said this way to only attract the elect at the end time so he speaks of this parable and in 14 it says that which fell among the torn are they which when the herd go forth and choked and choked with a care in the riches and the pleasures of life and bring no fruits to perfection but in 15 it says but that it says but that one good doubt but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word that says they keep it and it brings forth fruits with patience we and i just want to say this it's important that as a church of the living god we come to an understanding that god is not interested in dealing with us through our flesh god is not even interested to dealing with us through our spirit mind as a man human mind but god is interested in dealing in the seed that he had planted inside of us so we can operate by the seed that he had planted and not by our flesh or thinking so he could be by faith alone and not of works so he could be something that god himself will come and bring it to come to pass i was thinking about the other parable that we read the last time which it spoke about how that the sower came and he saw seed and this was in matthew 13 25 matthew chapter 13 how that he came and he sow seed and the enemy came and he saw a different seed and and and then at the end at verse 30 it says that let them grow together until the harvest and in that time of harvest i will send the reapers to gather together first a tear to bind them and to burn them but then gather the wheat unto my barn so here he is in the same at the end time meaning the time when the seed will have grown now we said this last time it's very important you realize yerry is when when he's saying that when they came and they said why don't we go out in the field and pull out all the tears that were the wrong seed that was planted he says no leave it alone let it grow together let it grow together it says but if you go at that time when they're still young you may hurt the seed in other words i was i i i was thinking so much about this and the scripture came to my heart where it says and i believe it's in galatians chapter 4 it says it says now i say that an heir as long as is a child different nothing from a servant in other words the church in his infancy when he doesn't know it's what what what it's all about and it doesn't know about its power it doesn't know about what he owns what is mine and it doesn't know about the position that god was trying to put it in a child when he's young when he's not about the father's business when he doesn't understand what is the father wants me to do when he's still young and and he's crying and all he wants is milk in it at that age it's no different from from a servant it's not different from a slave a servant but when a child grows up when a child gets into maturity when he comes into its perfection when he grows up and he becomes to a place where he understand what the father wants it to do at that time the the tear can be taken out and the seed will hold at that time it comes into the maturity it will come into the function of what god predestinated it to be and i want to say this that's why it's so important in this end time we realize that god is bringing his church into maturity he doesn't want us just to gather here and not know the reason why we gather here he doesn't want us to be those uh that are just excited the word comes and we jump up and down and we scream and everything and we go back being the same people no but he wants people that will step into possession the word of god at the end time is supposed to produce a more mature bride but than what the word produced in the first church ages that's why as we stand here we claim this promise why we've come into an understanding that what god is doing in this end time he's not looking for a baby but he's looking for a mature pride one who can stand and say this is my word this is my promise and i'll stand upon it until god brings it to pass and i'll say this it's very important don't forget that adoption was predicated on the conduct of the child the understanding of the business of the father the understanding that i have been given a responsibility i have been given a position i have been given something so i can bring the word of god to come to pass the scripture says that if you abide in me and my word abide in you ye shall ask what you will and i shall it shall be done it says wherein the father the year is wherein is my father glorify that you bear much fruit it says so much that he may so much so ye shall be my disciple as my father has loved me so i have loved you continue in my love it says if ye keep my commandment ye shall abide in my love and even as i have kept my father's commandment and abide in his love these things i have spoken unto you that my joy it says that my joy that my joy might remain in you that you be joy and your joy might be full this is my commandment and if we love and i love one another as i have loved you what is his commandment his commandment that is that we may keep his word his commandment is that we may come into the perfect place where we can bring forth coming to maturity where we can bring forth fruits is his joy his that we may come into a place where we can understand what is it that god is trying to achieve with us now he speaks in the message fellowship by redemption it says but if if god could not condemn his first creation how much more it is impossible for him to condemn his second creation he says when you are created anew in jesus christ you can't do it yourself i'm talking about the source of our perfection because so many of the time and time and time again the believer's greatest challenge is yourself the believer's greatest opposition is ourselves the believer's greatest challenge is every time we walk up we look at ourselves in the mirror we have to try to overcome that person that we see in the mirror we have to try to conquer that person we have to try to read the word of god and position ourselves not as what we see with our eyes even as the prophet said you look at me you see my fault i look at you i may see you imperfect but it says how about what god is seeing so a believer's positioning is to come to the place where you lose your own mind when you lose your own understanding where it doesn't matter what the devil is trying to show you what you interested in is what is god trying to show me what is he wanting me to see about myself oh i tell you i tell you this morning tonight let me i headed here let me see if i can read it because it's very important uh we we read it i believe in the rising of the sun this is paragraph 31 it says now the the the very essence of the message that was sent it is the rising is risen from the dead his benef his beneficiaries who shares that resurrection with him it says they draw benefit from this in other words from what from what god is seeing them not from what they're saying about themselves but listen to this draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some uh tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we are pointing to we only reflect exactly what we are pointing to and if you keep pointing to yourself you keep pointing to yourself you're never going to achieve anything but oh if i can walk up in the morning and hear the bride isn't invincible on me and say i'm pointing to death the bride will be so much like him i'm pointing to death oh the bride will go and she'll be the final voice i'm pointing to death the bride will be in the same image as the husband i'm pointing to that amen so he says you cannot do it by yourself no matter how much you you you you want to do it you cannot he listen to this it says it's a gift it's the it's a gift of god no man can make okay no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give him everlasting life and raise him up again in the last day and when listen to this and when god has borne you anew has borne you anew by the holy ghost he can only look upon you as perfect work oh i tell you this it it it it's so important we can see this well it says when you when god has bought you anew by the holy ghost he can only look at you has a perfect word because when god has bone you anew by the holy ghost he can only look at you as perfect work because he did it himself he says glory amen he can't condemn you for he had he because for you are my workmanship amen oh my he says i feel like shouting like the methodist think of it you are god's workmanship he did it by how sovereign grace not because you jumped not because when you went to church not because you turned a new page but because god by his mercy brought you into christ to fellowship and look upon you as perfect work of his own why i brought him i presented him to to my to the blood he's there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong with my work he said you are god's workmanship to come to an understanding that i am god's workmanship i am the work of god and i was thinking about this this afternoon oh you think about christ the mystery of god reveal is that such a revelation even what something that it just tremendously opens up more and more there he is god makes his creation satan comes and causes god's creation to come to fail now god takes his word he puts it in the womb of a woman where he they it's nothing to do with the women but it's all god's word and that word comes to pass and within that word that one seed is contained all the other seeds that god had in the beginning all the plain of god that he had why it was hidden in christ if satan knew it he was never going to kill him but what he didn't understand is the plan of god was in christ so therefore when he died you died with him when he was again you raised with him that's why he said that the plane was in christ if we can only understand that way when we come to our bible we read that he overcomes sin i can say i can overcome that too why because i was in him when he went to the cross [Music] the plan was not that christ will die and who was wrecked so god can figure out another way to bring the other seeds no the plan was the devil came and caused the creation to come to fall but god had a single plan the scripture says that the lamb was slaying before the foundation of the world what was he doing the plane was always christ the blood has always been christ the plan is christ all together so the understanding that in him all that god was the very first form that god took it was him the word so here he came he showed it when he came into the garden i was just talking about david about this he showed what he was going to do but the devil missed it it came and it took it was always adam it was always about adam but when adam was there he comes and out of adam he gets even he shows he says that's exactly what i want to achieve and everything but satan didn't see that so he didn't know that when he came to christ and he killed him that all he did was release the bride let christ come and when it died when he resurrected all the victory that he had the bride had it too in fact people still miss it today because they go back in the bible they don't understand what is this right that you guys are talking about who's the bride where is she the bride is him in the last day it's the manifestation of christ what he always wanted to do from the beginning hallelujah it says because not because you jumped not because you went to church or you turned a new page he says but he bought you in christ christ is the mystery of god revealed the whole entire mystery of how god was going to unveil himself like we heard this morning who's this bride how is she gonna come and we'll read it in a moment i'm just jumping ahead of myself what is all about her where did she come from who she is what's her representation it was all in christ in other words when she began to begin to be manifested it was nothing but christ himself reflection being made into her so now it says he says hebrews 2 ephesians 2 and 10 it says for ya we are his workmanship created into union with christ jesus unto good works but when it says in invisible union it says now listen to this oh this is wonderful you're all the book is gone with the old union now your name in the old in it has been transferred you say do you mean to tell me my old book god put it in the sea of god forgetfulness to stand perfectly before god he says now your name is now in the new book not in the book of life but in the lamb's book of life now he asks what lamb book what what what the lamb had redeemed not the old book of your nature natural union but a new book the bride he says hallelujah your new life in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate yo now let me let me continue on the marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal term from the beginning takes hold i want to stop there for just a minute i think oftentimes we approach christianity in such a wrong way where people are here you hear the word you said i want to be that i want to be that and you try to work yourself up into something and into justification into sanctification either you heal or you shouldn't steal oh i will try my best not to steal and everything that's not the way god has been working it out god has been working it out from eternity into the person that you are here and i want you to understand that's why because it's very important we see it he says when it's when when the germ eternal gem takes hold in other words the seed that god planted inside of you takes hold of this flesh causes it to walk by god's word to speak by god's word to think by god's word what is it something took hold of you and what is that that's that eternal term we come to church we hear oh you need to be baptized oh god i need the baptism so i can do right i need this i need this and i want to say this to you tonight the rain never changes the nature of the seed when the rain falls on the chassis and just the rain doesn't take the wheat and turn it into something else the rain doesn't take the tomato and turn it into carrots it doesn't take an apple and turn it into something else the rain facilitates what was already predestinated within the seed and only brings it into manifestation i tell you that's why he says you always had eternal life you always been with god it's the part of you that always wanted to be with god and god is reconciling with our part you didn't become a christian you were always a christian oh i tell you the revealing of the seven seals the third poll it brings confusion to the world but it's such a price to the bride it's the life itself why because you really said i always wanted to be that and then he comes and tells you well the reason why you always wanted that is because you were that let me say this eternity existed before time could exist let's not get it twisted we are not human trying to press into eternity no eternity was there before so in other words we're going back to what we were in eternity it says your that germ from the beginning takes hold and i want to say this if i can implore you tonight let that germ take hold of you don't try to control the germ of life that god has placed within you satisfy you with the things of the world let it take hold of you because that's what god is speaking to this word is addressed to the germ not to your intellect not to your understanding not to this human he said things we can never understand it with our mind he says you eat my flesh and drink my blood he says how can he say such a thing it was never meant for intellect those that were called by intellect they fought right there but there were those eagles those that were called more than just for the intellect they said you know what i don't understand what you just say i can't explain what you just told me but one thing i know is you have the words of life and therefore whatever it is that you want me to do i will follow it says hallelujah that determined germ takes hold and you are it says you are not only forgiven but you are justified glory to god romans 5 it says romans 5 and 1 it says therefore you are justified by faith now he says this this is in a message same message trying to do god the service he speaks about the bride now he says the word the evening message carries out evening results he says the evening message my soul evening seed not the morning seed evening seed he says is that right that's why it's important we speak about luke 17 30. now it's important to realize this mystery was hidden and it was not revealed until the same time so if you looked at it from the standpoint of before no one understood who this bride was how she was going to come what's her name all about her that's why i'm saying oh i tell you it's such an inspiration because when when david was speaking this morning i just i just about threw my notes and said i don't know what i'm gonna say but i began to realize it's god trying to say the same thing it was all hidden until the same time so in other words for you to know who this fright was how she was gonna come everything about her you had to listen to the voice of the seventh angel messenger it didn't come by anybody else it didn't come by any other teaching in fact but of adam says this takes more than just theology or studying the scripture or trying to put the scripture together this is divine inspiration from god it says the meat sin the meat seed it's the seed back it was a denomination it died and it perished but the evening time message will show the evening results like to show to show the evening time results he says now he says in jesus time midday it showed the midday result jesus it says the the the the beginning message saw the beginning result he met creation he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he made a bride for it the bride was not made until the evening time no one knew anything about this bride until the evening time that's the revelation of her it says see it see it says see what by his word how did he form the earth how did he speak into existence by his word he says how he how he says who was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now i want you to remember tonight this morning we read this when he asked who is the son of man he repeated the same sentence he says who is the son of man he says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god in other words the son of man was not william branham the son of man was the revealing of all the thoughts that god had within him before the foundation of the world and you will take it and encapsulate it in the flesh of in the body of jesus that when it comes it will open the whole mystery it says how it says who was the son the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and what was god and it was made flesh and dwelt among us how will he how will he take his bride by the word not by a new cart not by theologian's idea but according to his word he will identify her he says don't put one thing to it or take away anything from it leave it that way see he says now 178 it says the evening time he he says the evening time he promised he would reveal through the opening of the seven the seven seals and show what the church had missed back there revelation 10 malachite 4 luke 17 30 he says he said he he will do it now let's not mix it up let's keep it right like that let's keep it the way it is why because people came and they probe and they probe them they came in the probe and they thought that they had the only interpretation about what was going to happen and oh he was going to do this here all this pride and what is even the definition of bride and everything let me continue on for the second time and he continues on this is another message he says he says it says let me skip here speaks about the seed it says in a very plain language in a very plain language to the true bride of christ was made in the mind of god eternally in very plain language the true bride of christ was made was in the mind of christ eternally he says do not express until each came forth in the designation decreased season as each member came forth became expressed into the place of it in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine by designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called for for for for for that she's predestinated him come from the same source oh my brother my sister this is not another creation lower than what was made in the beginning this is christ now you remember when eve came about this was a byproduct which was made after the whole creation was finished oh but it was only in types and the reason why god let her fail was because he had a greater plane in that fall that he would come now and out of christ himself there will come a bright that can never fail why because the same as he was this pride is going to be he says it's the very apparent that she ought to be called that she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and now manifested in many members body whereas god was manifested in one in our lord jesus christ oh he continues on he says now then now then he says here we are coming to a conclusion what is the conclusion as the eternal logos was manifested in the sun and and jesus dwelt and in jesus dwell all the fullness of god bodily and the eternal was one and eternal and that eternal one was the father manifested in the flesh thereby gain the title of son even so eternal is the thoughts is the thoughts in our turn became the manifest the the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh those eternal thoughts doubt those eternal thoughts now manifested in the flesh of the son of god even as we are all we are so-called did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn by only but for only the elect can be reborn what is he saying this is part of god's plan in the beginning the bride existed in the beginning she was eternal with him she didn't gain somehow her eternal life because of christ and then christ died for her and then you know god made her no all of that was part of god's plan that through the redemption she can be connected right back she's equal with him he says the true church of jesus christ the bride is like pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attribute her identity is found in him was he he says what what he is she is to reflect what what he has she is to manifest there's not a fault in her you talk about our source of perfection i say this the only thing we see ourselves with fault is if when we keep our eyes on this mortal man when we look at the mortal man the struggle that he goes through but remember the promise is it's the seed that has to come to that revelation and when the seed comes through the revelation it promises it will take this flesh under his subjection but it has to start with a seed it which has to start with thy eternal germ within you coming to the manifestation of realizing who's this bride the bride is the word coming to pass the bride is the manifestation of this hour he says at one place the bride is what christ promised that the manifestation of him anybody who wants to see him will have to see him through the members of the bride he says if i could just skip for the take of time it says now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creed we cannot live by denomination we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed not a denomination but a living oracle of god the leaving word of god the leaving word of god now remember we just read it says by the same word that he created the heavens and the earth in the beginning by the same word in the noon that he came and he spoke his son christ to come into existence by that same word he's speaking and calling the bride at the end time he says he says a living attribute of god displaying displaying to the world the attributes of god in the form of a bride that that to be expressed in this hour that we are living in it says martin luther could not express the attribute that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like a corn of wheat that went into the earth the bride it says the bride in the end time it says and notice not only the bride wash washed forgiven but she's also justified it says did you ever did you ever try the word did you ever try the word justified and see what it means now for instance if brother green speaks about how if he didn't do anything or if he went and did something and you say he's forgiven that's forgiveness but if he never touched it you can never come and say you are forgiven because i never done it in the first place so the the righteousness of christ has come that's come upon the bride has brought the bride into a position where she's not even accused she's not even found guilty she's not even found having been associated with those things why because we are his workmanship i want to just say this it's very important as a member even as the last time because remember when we hear these things about wars and rumors of wars and and and there's things that's happening you know people get all oh the end time the end time yeah but it's very important we realize us that are part of the member of the bride how am i advancing towards that perfection we can't be settled with just saying oh i go to church and i hear the word as our pastor say this morning satan will let you do those things satan will let you come to church he will let you even hear and rejoice part of it but what he doesn't want you to do is to become one with that word is to let the eternal seed and say god i'm all for you whatever you want to do with me let the seed inside of you take hold and begin to manifest who this bride is now listen to what he says he speaks about i can even relate this to what's happening outside it says like israel it says back in the promised land she don't know it says she don't know how she's how she got back she was just automatically put back there why national force put her back in her place he says now i'm going to say something national force put israel in a homeland national forest puts the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride we are being moved by the power of god and perhaps our understanding even when we say the end time the manifestation of son oftentimes people jump quickly to just say you know all we think about is oh scroll being brought into existence mountain being uh brought down or stones being controlled and all of those things but i want to remind you that the manifestations of sons becomes starts with a new birth it starts with the new birth and the sea taking hold and it's one step and walking by one step until he brings you into that position to the place where he wants you to control whatever he has placed before you it's not just walking up and say well let me try today can i can i move mountains in can i do this and can i do this no it's the power of god within the word of god the same power that saved you the same power that convicted you that same power that took away the nature of the world that same power is controlling you why because he's putting you in the members of the bride and he says the world forces this way the world forces that way but god forces upwards the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place it says cause she's recognized her position in the word then she's in christ i tell you being in christ means so much more to me today than he did yesterday why because i'm understanding that all i have to do is find out what did christ do when i know what he did then i know i can do it you say what do you mean because i'm in him remember he spoke about united states it says all that she is all of her failure i i identify with that all of her glory identify with that everything she's ever been but not just to identify in all the failures but also identifying all its victory every victory that it's ever won every war every good thing that it's ever done in the natural you identify with it too so are the members of the bride everything that christ is we are called to identify with it so therefore we can't look at ourselves and say i'm a failure i'm this you're looking at the wrong person looking at the wrong place you're starting it all wrong what you have to realize is i need to find out that seed that can take hold of this flesh it's no longer my life as peter as paul as as the disciple can paul casey says it's no longer me that liveth it's christ i live how is it that christ that lives within me it's a seed it's a life within me that's controlling this flesh what i want to do i can't do it because what i want to do is something tells me to do something different why it's a seed god has a purpose for that seed he has a direction in the path that he wants it to take and nothing can stop it why because we're going back to eternity amen god bless you if you could stand amen the musician they're gone amen amen did you get all that i'm glad you did because there's a lot in there that's right i'm still feasting on it trying to figure it out you know what it's not by figuring it out is it it's my revelation hey man i hope that you got that one statement brother billy made just thrilled me so much he said even though she was in the feminine part if we can just get it in our mind in the beginning god made man and what his image and likeness adam was the first adam and he was both what male and female that's how they were together in the beginning him and her united together to make what god had in his mind you're the female part of god amen and now we're being brought what back together again back joined up to exactly what god had oh if you can when you how can you say bride without saying wife how can you say bride without saying union how can you say bride without these two becoming one you know when we can start thinking of ourselves as a bride you know a lot of people i have a lot of good friends and i if i could i don't know how the vocabulary to express it but good sisters that are good friends i've known them since they were kids and they grew up and we have a good uh friendship and and they're wonderful but i have one wife you understand in everything that i have she has my friends don't have it they don't have access but the wife has access leslie has access in in in the natural if i leave everything goes to her well what did he do when he left he left everything to her because she's him right oh it's we're entering in you understand we're entering in to a new mental and spiritual relationship with the word to we're no longer sinners we're no longer working our way to heaven but we're coming to the revelation that they he put the wedding band on us there were wife think of the different relationship that you have with christ with the lord jesus with the eternal word of god when you start approaching it i'm one with this i'm married to this this is my husband we're husband and wife oh my that's why he won't let his wife go through the tribulation oh it gets so good it gets so good it gets so wonderful we can't keep walking around oh i'm trying to work my head i hope he takes me to heaven when you come up and say i'm married you know i i think of that little story that he tells about the the little lady that remember that cattle rancher and and he goes there and she's in ragged clothes and throwing out dishwasher and he touched the dock and do her and he says you're the one and he espouses himself to her and tells her that he's going to come back and marry her so now they're one she's rejoicing in the world's laughing at her but you know why they all got dolled up but he had all the money to make her and dress her and do whatever he wanted for her he had all of it he just wanted someone that he could become one with and and oh billy i loved it how you said it brother hey man it's it's just it's just so beautiful amen how are you perfect because he was going to make you perfect you didn't have to make yourself perfect he was going to make you perfect because you were already him he knew where you were he knew what you were a part he knew you were there and now he says i'm going to come down and make her perfect oh my goodness don't worry about it don't look at yourself if you have a fault just raise it up to him and say lord make this fault perfect make this thing perfect [Music] hey man i i love it hey man maybe this song here i i don't i like the song but i don't know how to sing it

saved from sinner filled with the holy ghost to bride in christ being one oh father we're moving into that union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride the marriage of the lamb the union of

us that we could become him they're the same thing that was in beginning male and female not in the human sense that we would think but in the eternal sense of two natures one god one spirit one word

him everything that he is i am oh god let our minds think this way because the right mental attitude towards the word of god brings it to pass father may we be stimulated this week as we go out and start thinking of ourselves as married i'm married i'm married oh god thank you i'm not ever looking for somebody else i found the love of my life i put on the wedding band the predestination and i'm
