amen praise the lord that's our only hope amen we'll just get right into the word this evening and we have communion we don't want to keep you long so we're just going to go right into the word how many enjoyed the word this morning amen i'm looking for that revival to continue in my heart every every day hey praise the lord amen every day i want that old man to die and i want the i want the the spirit man to live praise the lord so we're just going to open our bibles if we could to a couple places of scripture here in the book of first peter chapter one and then we're also going to go back a book from that to the book of james chapter one as well in first peter chapter one we'll start reading at verse three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen and we'll turn back here to james chapter 1 and we'll jesus just read verses 1 through 4 and i think you'll maybe see kind of a theme it says james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen let's just go before the lord heavenly father lord our we just love you so much lord and appreciate the opportunity to come before you once again to hear from you lord lord we're looking lord to receive something from you this evening god knowing lord that we can't come into your presence and go out the same but lord our hearts desire lord is that we just cleave even more closely unto you lord seeing that the hour is late lord to know that lord as the tares are being bound so is the wheat being gathered to be brought up lord into the heavens together at that that great body change that we're looking forward to lord but lord let us just as we're even coming into a communion evening lord let us examine ourselves lord let us look into the mirror of your word this evening oh god and may we just lord if we see any blemishes lord we we quickly lord to to put it underneath the blood lord and to let that blood lord your precious blood and cleanse it away lord we just come before you this evening asking that you would speak to us lord bless all those that are traveling father all different ones that are lord our pastor traveling lord to get some rest lord and to to recover lord in the flesh may you also grant him a recovery and a revival in the spirit lord may you just anoint him lord for the work that you would have oh god and give him a refreshing lord not just of his flesh but of his soul oh god and lord different ones our brother matthew that would be traveling to minister may strengthen him as well and lord hear lord you wouldn't forget us even here oh god that as we've come together lord at our posted duty this morning and this afternoon oh god that you would just bless each and every one meet them at the place that they're at right now we just commit the service to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated just wanted to speak uh i kind of had an idea or a thought and then the lord kind of changed it and i just wanted the thought that kind of came to my mind this morning when the lord kind of turned i was just fellowshipping you know with brother billy in the back before he came out and it's amazing you know the word of god is just infinite and and you know i believe brother branham even said it would be all eternity god just revealing himself to us you know revealing the different attributes of himself to us and we've only you know the things that we see on this side i believe we've only just barely scratched the surface and it's amazing how you can have an idea maybe something upon your heart and then as brother billy and i were talking how it just seems like everywhere you go in the word it's just a fork in the road you go down this path and it'll go this way and this path in it you're just trusting that that you're just following the the pillar of fire to lead us to where we would go so the the thought that the lord really impressed upon me if i could put it this way is is the joy of the test and it's such a it's such a paradoxical idea isn't it that that when how we could say count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations but you know god when he's bringing when we realize when we start to realize what he's bringing us to in this age and i believe as we've heard our pastor minister and the different ones that have come through and ministered behind and the things that we're beginning to see what god is truly bringing us to and a manifestation it's not just a manifestation of just one little thing here or there but he's god is desiring to manifest his very life in you in a bride it's not just to be it wasn't it's not enough anymore to say oh we just had justification with luther or we had sanctification with wesley or some restoration of the gifts with the pentecostal move but god now is has brought it boiled it down to we call it the seed time to where the very life that went down in the beginning god is requiring that same life to come forth here at the end time we heard it ministered this morning our brother billy brought out how throughout the other ages we did rejoice when the blade sprung up we did rejoice when the tassel sprung up and when the stalk came up why because it was a manifestation of that life we rejoiced when when the the husk came out and the shock showed itself because why it was a manifestation that there was a life to come and yet in the age that we're in now being smitten out of laodicea we've heard the call come ye out from among them be separate don't be partakers of her plagues and we've heeded that call and with that call comes a greater expectation of where we're to come to because it's no longer enough just to have a tassel just to have a stalk just to have a shuck but he's requiring a seed in this hour a ver and what is the seed but it's the very life that went into the ground at the beginning and in order to prove what that seed is it has to come to a test it has to come to a testing time because god won't leave it up to just a guessing game he's not going to leave it just to a chance but he will prove the scripture says prove all things hold fast that which is good so god isn't just gonna leave it up in the air as to whether this is or whether it isn't see we know in our hearts that we've received a word but see with that comes a testing time it's required that any child that comes to god must go through a testing time abraham received the promise of god he said you're going to have a son you're going to be the father of many nations your seed will possess the gates of the enemy and yet with the receiving of that promise there came a necessity of a testing of that promise to see whether he would hold to it or rather he wouldn't and so that's what we're talking about we want to the joy of the test it seems like a paradoxical thing because we're going how many have gone through tests and trials right now we're falling into too many tests and many trials and temptations and trials of our faith and that the instinct the the the nature of the flesh as we've discussed this many times is to throw up our hands and say why me why do i have to go through the test but see that's the flesh man talking because there's a seed down on the inside of the inside of you that knows who it is that knows the nature and the the power that is latent and inside of it the very word power that lays in you that was planted before the foundational world and as we've heard in these messages lately has been quickened by the light that's been shown forth in our age but now the question is through the tests and the trials have come to prove what that seed is capable of what that word is capable of because there's a time where it's gonna become it's a dividing time it's a time to divide the chat from the wheat that's the time we're at brothers and sisters there's a reason the great falling away has come the scripture says that that there don't be concerned when you see all these these different uh these many things that have come up in strange doctrines and things that have come he's he said these things have to come but they don't come just for the sake of them coming but they've come to prove what the acceptable is because you can't have a true without a false you can't have a positive without a negative there has to be we i remember our pastor preached it maybe a year ago there has to be a law of that distinction the contrast has to come so don't be concerned when you see all these tests and trials coming when you see a thousand will fall at your left hand ten thousand if that right but it shall not come nigh thee why because it's come to proof what is acceptable before the lord think it not strange count it all joy say how can i count it in joy and i'm not going to hold us along tonight i don't want to hold islam we're going to be very short by the grace of god but it's mainly because the idea is so simple but if the lord would quicken it to your hearts and to see how important this test is how important the trial is every day when you go through a temptation in a trial many times we we go through we see something see we see something that happens in our lives and we're going through something no matter what it is it could be an external trial we heard brother billy mention that a little bit oh we think about the bills and we think about this medical issue over here and we think about this family issue over here it could be an internal trial lord i've just struggled so much with this temptation i've just struggled so much with overcoming this thing in my life it could be external it could be internal it doesn't matter what it is but the trial has come for you you've got to understand that that satan is so whipped he is so whipped that he's nothing but just not just a temporary schoolmaster test for you say every temptation that comes in your life is for you it's not for the devil to exalt himself over the seed of god no sir why because he said the seed shall possess the gates of your enemies so the temptation didn't come see the devil has got many people tricked into thinking that the temptation has come to destroy you that the temptation has come to weed you out but remember if you're seed the temptation can only come to prove who you are it's come to prove you the lord told the children of israel he said i took you in the wilderness why to prove what what was in your hearts do you think god needed to prove it to himself what was in their hearts the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he didn't have to know about that but what was he doing he was proving to them what was in their hearts when you go through these trials and temptations brothers and sisters they are for you to show you what we have left to work on if i could put it like that i'd like to keep it simple what do we have left that we haven't rooted out yet is there a root of bitterness over here is there a little bit of judgmental law law living over here little legalism here and there there's a lot of that going around but what happens the trial on the test has come to prove to you to show you what's in your heart it didn't come for the devil we think oh that the test is just here just so the devil can have his way with me no the devil's already whooped he's a defeated foe and i know they sound i just feel like to say this but i thought you know that this is the lord remember we're typed as eagles and i thought about this and i ended up finding a video on it i thought and not only that i thought it was really interesting you know that those parent eagles will bring living creatures into the nest to let the little eaglets practice how to kill that prey and you know when i looked that up you know what i found i found they brought a baby fox to the nest it's the little foxes that spoiled the vine and what did it do the mother brought a living baby fox it was no threat but what were they doing they were trying what is that eagle doing it's trying to instill in that child in that baby an instinct to understand what it's capable of it the that that parent is trying to teach them this is what i've given you this is what you this is your nature this is who you are this is the power that you have and when the when the lord brings love allows temptations into your life it's just to bring that devil see the devil's already whooped he's like that baby fox couldn't do nothing to those eagles if he tried but it's not there for the fox it's there for the eagle to show you that you have already overcome the world he's nothing but a defeated foe so what is he doing he's trying to teach us he's trying to build you up and you need to have faith in who you are we believed on who he is but do you have faith in who you are because if you had faith in who you are you truly understand who he is and if you truly understood who he is you'd understand who you are why because you start to realize there's no difference oh that sounds sacrilegious to say but if you've been able to catch the underlying thought that the lord has been trying to get through to his people in this church over the last month it's the shorts what does he bring that wave sheath what are we talking about the wave sheath what was the point of the wave sheath the point was not the wave sheath the point was to prove that that law worked and there was more behind it that were on the way just like the first one i don't know about you but i'm one of those ones that's on the way for the harvest right behind the wave sheath and that they're not going to be anything different why because remember the seed it's seed time again what's the difference between planting and harvest numbers one went into the ground 104 came up one wave sheath was waved a whole bride comes in behind it glory to god and it's not the man it's not about that we heard it this morning it always points to christ because he was the seed that went into the ground except the corn of wheat die it abideth alone but if it dies and goes into the grounds and rots through seven church ages it rotted through a dark ages it rotted and then it started to spring up it started to spring up luther came up wesley came up pentecostals came up then we had a wave sheath come along and what did it show it showed harvest time it's at the door harvest time is here not only is harvest time here but it's going to produce exactly what god's law said it would which is just like the beginning if i plated corn in the ground and i waited and that thing died and it rotted and started to come up and i came up with soybeans there's a problem somewhere if i planted corn and all of a sudden buckwheat came up there's a problem somewhere because what went into the ground is what has to come up so what are these trials to do these trials are to prove they're not to prove to god anything that's right god doesn't need to prove his word to himself he is his word he's trying to get you to believe it he's trying to get you on his page he's trying to get you to say that's me i can reach that i can be that i can live that i can walk and talk like that the same words that he did i will do why because he said it and if that word went down that word's got to come up the devil's got so many deceived into thinking they can't reach that bar when the reality of the situation is that's the only bar that's going to get you out of here and it's not the bar of william branham it's the bar of the lord jesus christ in william branham to show see god proved through that prophet's life that even in satan's eden in a fallen see god proved god proved in the old testament through the law that a fallen man couldn't do it prove through the law that a fallen man couldn't do it then he came in the in the in the body of jesus christ and proved that the word could do all of it then he's coming this day to prove that through that word a fallen man could rise up to a place where he can go back to an eating condition even in the body of his flesh that's why paul could say he said oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death he said but i thank god through the lord jesus christ it's a rhetorical question because it's already delivered if you could come to a place to accept who you are if you could truly grasp it and see what he's trying to tell you about who you are then you'll realize that all these tests and trials you're going through they're for you they were purpose built for you they were designed for you to overcome them because you got to be an overcomer you know the lord can't just lay it out on a plate and call it remember brother branham said that he said he just he pulls you over there and calling an overcomer no you didn't overcome anything but what are you overcoming you're over you don't even have to overcome the devil you've already done that why because he did it for you but now what do you have to do you have to overcome yourself you're overcoming yourself you're overcoming the body of this death every day when you look in that mirror and you see that old pesthouse staring back at you that old nasty thing that doesn't like the things of god that wants to be lazy that doesn't want to love their brother but then there's a like what do we hear this morning but there's a revival in your heart that's burning and saying god i see the life that you have for me i see the word that i have designed and made and called to live it'll bring forth it'll it'll it will overcome this flesh so much that they'll think you're jesus christ himself you know why i can say that because they thought that about brother branham and i don't know about you but that's the same life we're called to oh you say brother that can't be it that's the only place it can be you know what you know you know what the scripture says in first john he says he says brethren try the spirits he says any spirit that says jesus that does not say jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god that's a present tense jesus christ is coming the flesh now he did and william branham jesus christ is come in this flesh in your flesh in his flesh in her flesh jesus christ see that's why i appreciate the way brother the lord had brother billy bring it out this morning he said any spirit that tells you that you cannot attain that's of the devil it doesn't matter what the excuses are you can have all the excuses you want but the word already said so that christ is come in the flesh he says if you abide in me and my word and you ask what you will he says he says my father and i will come and we all make our abode with him i would that they be one even as we are one so if jesus was so much one when you see me you see the father and he said i would they be the same then who might argue i want that i need that i'm going to have it not because i can work myself to it but because i'm going to yield myself to the word until he brings it to pass we've got it mistaken when we think we're sitting there struggling and fighting you know the only thing you're struggling and fighting with is not being honest with yourself because you go through temptations you go through trials those are good you know why because there's a lot of revealing that goes on when you start getting into trials you start to reveal a lot of things see james says in james a little bit farther down here i believe yeah james chapter 1 he says he says let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither attempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of satan's own lust that's not what he says he says when he has drawn away of his own lust seeing too many times i i know brother branham said this you can look it up and he said it many times he said too many people say oh the devil made me do it he said the devil didn't make you do it he said you heard his call and you went out to him because he can't come into you he'd be your brother so what was it it's just like the remember the story of the little sister that had just gotten saved and she's just walking down the street and she walks past the music hall and when she stopped just for a second let no man say i'm tempted of god but what was it she was drawn away brother bram said right there she stopped that's where she lost it first of all because she she even gave the devil an ear brother branham said resisting the devil is really simple you just ignore him and move on but what happens we're not honest with ourselves brothers and sisters we've got to come what what are we here a revival is getting the trash out getting all the trash out admitting that there's trash there to begin with well we're the bride we don't have nothing wrong we don't have this or that then why are we not seeing a perfect overcoming power this isn't about being accusations or anything we've already overcome but the question is have we really trusted him the way we claim to because there's never a fault with god never a fault with god but what did she do she listed and then what did she she was drawn away of her own lust see no matter what you do this flesh has its things going on you know not everybody struggles with everything by the grace of god i never you know there are certain things i never struggled with there are certain things you may never struggle with so that maybe isn't inherent in your struggle but but see it's time we got away from all the devil did this and the devil did this no he says you're drawn away of your own lust so maybe it's time we own our own see but that's but that's why you can rejoice in the trial when the tempt he said rejoice in the temptations why because when you start to feel that pull of a temptation do you know what god's doing in that he's revealing to you where the problem might be he's revealing to you where the enemy's laying see we did oh he's just doing this to do it no god is giving you opportunity you say oh lord i don't want to have that pull in my heart to listen to that music or that sister how she thought about all the time she danced and what are the awards and oh i did this and did that what was it there was a little bit of a pool but the temptation came and what was it the temptation actually reveals the devil think i thought the way the lord gave it to me was this we're in a battle and the devil lies around every corner waiting to ambush you you don't necessarily know where he is all the time there are sometimes it's pretty obvious where the trap's at hey you want to go to this party after school today i got a bunch of beer we're coming that trap's pretty obvious or at least it should be but you don't always know where the devil's going to anoint someone just to try to press those buttons it could be a brother or a sister it could be a co-worker it could be a family member you don't always know where the trap's going to be set but what happens is when the trap is sprung any military person will tell you if that once they spring the trap the jig is up you know where the enemy's at so when the temptation comes the devil of a necessity must reveal himself praise the lord for the temptation praise the lord when it comes because then i can focus my fire i can say there he is right there [Applause] and then what he do you get that on your knees and you pray you cover it over in prayer you get before the lord and say lord i don't wanna i don't wanna have this anymore i wanna repent i wanna i wanna true repentance that's what we like a lot of times it's true repentance honesty with ourselves saying lord there's a oh well lord the devil did this and the death no there's lord there's something in me i need you to take out [Music] say lord try my heart and see if there'll be any wicked way in me and take every bit of it out every one of these trials and temptations comes with a purpose it comes to help you these trials are not to destroy you god is for you not against you joe if anybody had a right to think god was against him it was job he said lord i i did the right things i sacrificed correctly i prayed for my children i i helped the widows and the orphans and the all these ones i had to love and all these things and people keep accusing me but you see the trial was for job the trial was for job let's see if i could find this quote you forgive me my printer stopped working at home so i had to i don't like necessarily bringing my phone up here but i have there's a you know job there was something that job had where and i don't know if i can find this right now but lord knows but you can find it in the message perfect faith in 1963. brother branham said that job fear and because he feared the things that he feared came upon him now job the scripture says he was perfect and upright in his ways but yet there was something that god needed to reveal to job brother braham said in another place i can't remember the message he said job fear death why he had the he asked the question he said lord i see the tree go down and come up i don't understand it but a man goes down doesn't come back up so what was it see god used that trial not only to reveal job's problem he had feared brother braham says in that message perfect faith they said if he had faith he said it wouldn't have happened but because he feared it brought it to pass he said the thing that which i feared came upon me praise the lord he had enough revelation to see what it was but what happened see this is the grace of the trial even in the midst of the trial because even in the middle he said lord i have these questions i don't understand death doesn't make any sense and then here comes god in the midst of the trial see the trial not only reveals the devil and his tricks but then god through the trial reveals a portion of his nature to you because it's in that trial that god will reveal that his portion of himself that can lift you out of it i think brother billy said it this morning he said so many times those little portions they'll sit there and lay dormant for years but it's already in you you just didn't even know it yet because it wasn't the season to come forth but then god brings you into a trial just so he can get you to a place to prove to you what he already placed in you so it wasn't to destroy job it was to show him and what he said he said i know my redeemer liveth he had all these questions the pro brother branham said he feared death at one time but then in the midst of that trial in the midst of the temptation then the lord comes in and raises up a standard gives the prophet a vision he says though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh i'll see god my eyes will behold him and not another he said i'll stand before him in the last days so what was it he was revealing himself in the midst of the trial and then he comes along later and job had all these fears about oh well i feared this might come upon me and this might come upon me and god threw it all shows don't worry about it job where were you when i when the sons of god sing together and i believe job had a revelation he said i was there i was in you i believe that why because in the midst of the trial is where god reveals himself to be who he is it's in the middle of the battle where god see it's easy to just take things for granted when you're on the mountaintop and he got everything going for you but when you get in the middle of the battle and things start to get really down and dirty and on every hand it seems like things are going wrong that's where god reveals himself to you if you would just submit yourself to him but the trial has come for your benefit the trial did not come to destroy you the trial did not come to push you farther away but it came to draw you closer the trial came to prove to you who you are i was i i was seeing a thing and they were talking about carburetors and this factory that made carburetors and they make them all and they're pretty complicated little machines and if you don't remember those are the things that used to go in cars way back in the day now it's all fuel injected i think and all these different things but they make these carburetors and they put them together but before they can package them in a box and ship them off they have to hook them up to a machine and test them and they test every pressure point they test every little crevice and crack and seal and that's what god is doing to you right now in the trial so don't don't worry say oh lord i i failed in this trial say praise god you revealed to me where i need help lord you you revealed to me where the enemy lies see we get so we throw up our hands and just say oh lord i can't do it well you can't that's the point it's always been the point but he's bringing us up to a place brothers and sisters he's bringing us to a place where as he is so are we i believe the book of john if i can find it here bear with me if i can find the scripture here amen and first john chapter four now and we'll close here in just a minute i know we'll be really short but that's i just feel led to just not really go very long maybe we'll read a quote or some or something here but he says in first john chapter 4 he says herein now let's start at verse 16. and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world that's where that's where we're at brothers and sisters as he is so are we in this world that jesus christ has come in the flesh he's bringing us to that place but these trials and temptations you're going through he's trying to prove to you he wants you to have confidence in who you are brother branham in that message perfect faith said jesus had confidence in who he was he had faith in what the word said about him which is why he could do the things that he did simply because he believed what the word spoke about him and that's what the lord is trying to get us to do is to believe what the word spoken about us in this day that there is a bride that has a that has a message to preach not a different message it's not something different why because it's got to go back to eden and it's got to go back to the very first message and what was the trick that the devil got pulled over on eve in the beginning that the original message wasn't enough that there was something extra that could be gained somewhere why do you think there are so many schisms and doctrines and paths and things that run down because they've taken this message and they rejoiced but because it was carnal they started they started to get distressed they started to get if i could say antsy as we say they started to get a little bit there's got to be something more there's got to be something more there's got to be something more no there is no there is no other there was no other message in the garden of either eden other than the day you eat thereof that day you'll die but see what did satan come along and said surely there's a little bit more to be gained over here remember she was drawn away brother branham said i believe in the message god of this evil age that she was she was drawn away why she by her by lust brother ram said what was it a lust for knowledge she wanted to know and i believe we mentioned this in the last service but the problem was and what the devil's trying to get over the people of god in this hour is that you already have all the knowledge that you need jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the word and nothing else see there's no other message to come and the devil's going to try to be out there remember with false prophets he said they even work now in the world and they've been working ever since right at the beginning when paul preached that spirit of antichrist trying to get people to believe there's a little something extra here if you could just dig a little deeper there's a little bit more than what anybody else has got brothers and sisters don't be deceived that way why because the the test is gonna prove and it's proving that went out from among us because they weren't of us see what was it we've seen all the ones that have departed recently what do they all have in common well there had to be something else to it there had to be something more so what did we do we started digging deeper we started digging deeper carnally now they started digging and digging and digging and digging and what did it get but he said they wrestled to their own destruction and we've seen a shipwreck it's exactly what paul called he said they'd be a shipwreck and that's all we see now is shipwrecks on the left shipwrecks on the right why because they've people we've wandered from the simplicity the atonement of calvary was enough what the seven seals and the seven thunders and the seven church ages did was reveal to us what that atonement actually did see the problem is oh there's got to be more to it no we had no idea what it was until those seals were broken we had no concept that god was calling us to that place to set in my throne and to truly have a revelation of what that means do you know what god has called you to god has called you to be a partaker of deity remember gold is deity he said your faith your triumph your faith is more precious than gold he said you'll be like gold tried in the fire the problem is maybe we haven't quite been able to come to a full revelation of that and and you forgive me i don't have the quote here and i want to look it up and bring it because it's such a powerful thing but in the church age book brother branham mentions one little quote in there that just really always struck me he said he said many that are gonna miss it are gonna miss it because they didn't fully accept the atonement it's that simple because if you could truly accept it's accepting you've got to receive it see when when the angel when the mighty angel came down with an open book in hand he didn't go to john the type of the bride and cram it down his mouth he said you take it you eat it that's we've got to take this word we've got to eat this word we've got to be completely saturated with this word because faith only comes by hearing the word that's all and there's no word outside of this message the rest of it is is going down because not one jot or tittle will pass away and they've all perverted outside of this message there is no rapture outside the message of william branham it can't happen because christ is the word he won't have one arm god he won't have one here and one there when it comes to the word it's all the word or nothing so it's got to come back to an eden showdown again are you going to take what the word says yes sir or are you going to try to figure it out some way that there's got to be something extra to it could you think i i marvel and i appreciate a prophet and the way he was open with us about all the things that he struggled why because we start to see even through his life being a type for us to show us that all the trials that god allowed him to go through served a purpose when he disobeyed god when it came to the pentecostals and had to lose his wife and his daughter god wasn't trying to destroy him even though it looked like it and satan tried to tell him that right come right over his shoulder and you and you said god loves you and look what he's done your wife already died and your little innocent baby laying dying right there but that wasn't the point the point was to mold him and to make him what if what i mean if anyone would see their faults in that moment and to see the mistake that he made by rejecting the path that god had laid out in that moment it was william branham but what was it that was the purpose because there was a work down the road that he had as the prophecy would say he had to take the harder path he had to take the harder way he had to take the weight like god said it is my way and that's what god is looking for us he's not looking for us to just coast down through the trial's got to come and we've got to consciously take the road with god's despised view because it won't be a flowery bed of ease it's not going to just be coasting on the resume of william branham we've come underneath that umbrella but have we come into the life of it all the mistakes that he made knowing abby i believe he had a full revelation of who he was and what commission he was fulfilling you could see it in the way he spoke but could you imagine now mentally and and the the temptations and the pressures that would have to come with that and then to see a man that could lie to somebody and tell his wife i'm not telling i'm not here a man that could look back on his failures and how he failed god but he what was it he had such a simple faith that the atonement of jesus christ was sufficient to bring him into such a perfect fellowship that he could walk with no condemnation before the people with that kind of a commission weighing down on him but because why he could understand it wasn't about him in the first place but it was about the world god fulfills his word not even just for your sake but for his word's sake and because you are the word he's got jesus obligated to fulfill it to you because he can't let if you're part of the word if you are the word how many believe you're the word you've been broken off an attribute of god and an attribute of god is nothing else in the word and if god won't let one word of his fall to the ground without fulfilling itself then how can you fail you can't because you are the word if you're the word you cannot fail any more than god could fail because he won't let you fall to the ground without fulfilling your purpose how so how how could you that's why jesus could go into the grave he said i know i'll suffer not my holy one to see corruption i won't leave his soul in heroes in hell or suffer his body to see corruption why because he knew that word pertained to him so if god has spoken a word to you in this hour and it can only be that's why it's not it's not a conglomerate it's not a it's not a guilt by association well i'm just attached to the message and so i just partake of that blessing well you may receive some fringe benefits just like many of the hangars on did you may get a little fish and loaves you may get a little snack here and there but when it comes to the the rubber meets the road unless you eat the flesh of the cinnamon and drink his blood it's going to push you away one of those days except you have that word in you at which point that trial didn't come to cast you away it came to draw you closer where else shall we go am i making sense he's calling us to a higher place we've got a higher calling than just sitting on a church pew and just saying oh well lord i hope this happened no you were called a word of god for this hour that's why no one can fulfill your place because nothing can add or take away and if you can't add or take away from the word then i can't add or take away from that body because only you can fulfill that portion if i were to take away my part would be taken away because you're part of him your bone of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word power of his power life of his life he can't deny you and these trials and temptations haven't come to prove it to him they've come to prove it to you why because he knows what we are he knew from the foundation of the world what we were we act as if god is surprised we act as if god didn't see what was coming down the road he already knew what was there he provided an avenue he said with every temptation there's a way of escape but what do we do sometimes we just get drawn away by our lusts and then we try to pass the buck off to say well that was their thing they did this no you did it put it before the lord put it under the blood and move on leave the past in the past move on from there say lord try me one more time so i'd say that as we're getting ready for communion this evening and we'll just all stand and we'll close with that with this i didn't want to keep us long and i don't know if the lord would allow me to find well so that's all right we'll just we'll just leave it there god has made you an overcomer he's made you that way but sometimes he's got to prove it to you that you're an overcomer but he go you you go through the test so you could have confidence in what he made you so don't think it's strange remember the trial of your faith is more precious than gold why because every time you go through these trials whether you saw a test is a test you take a test in school how many ever taken a test and failed what did that just prove to you well didn't prove you weren't going to graduate but it proved in that carnal case maybe you need to do a little more studying maybe there's something you need to do a little catching up on so when you come to a trial success or failure remember god is using it to reveal something to you the trials when they put that little carburetor in the machine to test it what is it it's to reveal any little flaw any little thing that's not like it when it's put when that when that refiner puts the gold into the fire it's not to destroy the gold it's to get it to a place where that refiner can get all the dross out the refiner can start to hammer i was ju we were joking with the brother it said it's amazing when you think about forging when they take medals and they want to form them into something and that's what god's doing to you he's forging you he's making you he's molding you into his image but it's a painful process for the metal because the metal first has to go into the furnace and then it gets heated up to where it's glowing the fiery trials of temptation and then what happens then that ingot is pulled out of the fire and no doubt the income says oh praise the lord i'm out of the trial and as soon as the end gets out of the fire puts it on the anvil and starts hammered away because now he's going through the trial he's soft enough to be molded and then he says oh praise the lord now i'm done with the hammering now he's got to go to the quenching station now that's the last part but many times he hammers it and he can only get so much out of that trial because you know you go how many you know this brothers and sisters you go through a trial god gets you desperate you say you get down on your own lord help oh lord i need you lord help me i'll rep i repent i'm just being honest and then he brings you out of the trial and he's molding you he hammers you you go through some pain you say lord but then what happens what happens you start to cool off what happens when that metal starts to cool off it starts to get hard again so what does he have to do stick your right back in the fire and then what do they do they take those bellows the big old glow that looks like an accordion and that he just hits that bellows what is he doing he's making it hotter yeah he's blowing he's blowing it a little hotter a little hotter then he'd say oh lord i can't take the fire he says okay and starts hammering me again but that's what is it the trial the trial is not to destroy that material but it's it's the master knows the purpose for that material he knows the purpose for your life every though every time he sticks you in those fiery trials you know what you can rejoice why because he's softening you up he's getting you moldable to his will because what happens what did we hear this morning how we need those revival fires to burn we need those revival fires in our heart to burn more and more why because that's what keeps us soft that's what keeps us moldable but if we let that cool breeze of laodicea start to blow over you what happens you start to cool down and once that metal starts to cool it gets hard you say lord the word doesn't move me the way it used to maybe you need a little bit of a trial maybe you need some fiery trials to come and warm me up a little bit you know it's it's when the you know it's wind it's not the you're not gonna you're not gonna cozy up to the fire when it's hot outside it's when it gets that cold dark night that you start to cozy up to the fire many ma many of us maybe got a little too comfortable we've we've gotten really cozy in the in the world and the way things are and it's really comfortable well sometimes those trials come along to get you out of that comfort zone get you into that cold winter so you'll cozy up to the fire a little more but praise the lord you know what happens then when that when that blacksmith is done and he gets that final forging you know i always used to think you know they talk about the quenching of the metal and i always used to thought they'd do it in water but no they actually do it in oil praise the lord for the oil he takes that he takes that thing it's still hot but what happens is he takes it and quenches it in that oil and they say molecularly the structure of it if you quench it just right see if you quench it if you quench it at the wrong time that that sword or whatever you're making will become brittle and then when you go to use it it'll just break or if you don't but if you don't quench it it'll just be soft and you could just bend it it wouldn't do it it'll never hold an edge but see if you quench it just right at the right temperature at the right time in the in the oil just right you're going to have a blade that'll hold an edge sharper than anything and it's still flexible it can bend when it needs to bend but it won't break and it doesn't just conform to whatever force comes against it no it can bend but it doesn't break and you know it comes and snaps right back that's the kind of christian god's making right now he's making rugged soldiers that can take the pressure that can take like iron sharpening iron can can take that sharpening to hold an edge but yet when it gets into combat doesn't break under the stress so don't worry about the trials they've come to prove you they've come to prove to you who he is and he makes a way of escape with every temptation but just realize when those when those temptations come you're walking through the world or you're going you know you go through the store and you see the things on tv now and all the insanity that's going on or the devil tries to bring something along your path and all of a sudden you feel that temptation you know what he says he says joy james said he said rejoice it sounds almost crazy lord oh and i could feel that pull towards that towards towards that that envy spirit praise the lord why because you could feel it and if you can see that that means the devil's exposed he tried to launch his ambush he was hiding in the cover then he poked his ugly head out to try to try to get you on the road but then you trained your sights on him he said lord thank you for revealing it to me what i got what i got to cover and then you get to prayer they say lord i don't want to have that i don't want to have that pull in my life anymore i hope that makes sense to of all of us so as we go to communion this evening you just cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you no matter what trial you're in right now remember it's for your benefit it's for your benefit it's not for the devil the devil's already defeated and he's performing his work he's done he's doing what he does the one thing about the devil remember he's a good adversary but he's nothing but a defeated foe before the children of god so all you have to do is trust in what he's made you to be it seems so simple but how many times how many sometimes feel like you're so far from it because you look at yourself we're looking at our own things so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and we'll have brother billy come maybe we just bring this before the people lord jesus lord to the world that would seem such a a a paradoxical thing lord and even to the laodicean christian mind it would seem maybe a silly thing lord to rejoice when we're tempted to rejoice when we fall into trials and tribulations but lord as you've called us in this age and given us that prophetic insight that your prophet spoke of to give us those those eagle eyes oh god to anoint us in this eagle age to see lord that we could recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and then lord as we heard lord to when we recognize that spirit to resist that spirit by the holy spirit lord because we know we can't do it on our own but lord we believe and we're trusting lord and who you've made us to be who you've called us to be that seed that you placed in us before the foundation of the world well that when we've done all we can do to stand we stand lord because we know lord that those tears and the trials may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning lord if there be anybody here oh god that says lord i i just lord i've gone through so many trials i've gone through many temptations lord maybe i'm going through a temptation or a trial even now lord help me to see the enemy in the trial lord may you highlight that enemy for me lord where i could i could be aware of him and what where where that pull might be if there's a temptation lord that's trying to draw me away oh god you'd help me to recognize that temptation lord to cover it over with prayer to cover it over with the word to cover it over with the holy ghost in that token to place it there before you lord jesus to repent lord and place it before you lord jesus lord and then lord to recognize you that you're our sufficiency lord that you're the one that's provided for the victory lord lord that if there would be anybody there oh god that you just witnessed that to them in their heart even now lord lord you said in the book of john oh god that that as you are so are we in this world lord you're bringing a people to that place lord where i believe it would be said just as it was at antioch that they called them christians not because lord there was a profession of their mouth but that there was a life lord that there was a life so powerfully lived by the holy ghost in them that even the heathen couldn't help but see that there couldn't be anything else but the very life of god being lived through those people and lord i know that you're bringing a bride to that place even now you're living it out in your people now lord i pray lord as we go to communion oh god that we would just have every heart cleansed lord that we just place everything before you lord god and lord place it underneath the blood oh god may we just apply that token now lord we're not trusting in our own merits oh god but we're believing lord in that full atonement we're coming underneath that full atonement lord we believe it father we accept it may you give us the grace to move ourselves out of the way oh god and let you live through us in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen aren't you happy for the master's hand amen you know even as our brother said god is trying to prove to ourselves you know you you think about those trials and those temptations and the perfectly packaged for you and for each and every one of us he knows exactly what you have need of and he knows in fact the scripture tells us that he actually even knows the measure he says no temptation comes to where he could take you he says but with every temptation god supplies the way so he can get the the desires result as he was as our brother randy was preaching i i thought about you know this the message tells us that you know when the bride when that church when we recognize who we are well we need some testing to recognize who we are we need to to go to this testing systems you know to to come to the realization of who we are amen it's not just by you working up and saying i know who i am no there's got to be some adversity something standing on your way for you to realize i'm not this and i'm this this is what i desire and god taking you through all of that that's what the scripture says it's more precious than gold because through those temptations he actually brings us in fellowship with god because we need him we want him to walk with us we want him to take us through those things we want to fellowship with him even more amen as the brothers of bringing the communion let's just turn our bibles open our bibles first corinthians chapter 11. the 23rd verse it says for i res i have receiver of the lord that which i also deliver unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given tanks he breaked it he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup when he had stopped saying this is this is a new testament of my blood do this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as off as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye this show the lord's death till i come wherefore whosoever shall eat and and shall shall eat this bread and drink the scalp of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily either and drink it damn eat it and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if i would he says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened off the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hungered let him eat at home that ye may come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen i like this and it says when we come it's a scary one for another and even is saying that when we are judged we are judged so that we are not we are chastened off the lord so we are not condemned with the world let every man examine himself even as our brother said that trial that temptation that place it's to cause self-examination where you look at yourself and you realize lord i need help with this lord i need help with this and i believe even when communion when we come we receive strength from communion to say lord that desire for you to provide me the healing that i need the deliverance that i need the things that i need i'm here to receive of you for me to be a better christian amen let's just bring it so to pray
