Description:
The Journey of the Seed: God Calls For Maturity 
Br. David McGeary Jr.
May 07, 2023 PM
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

wings amen Faith's a gift of God so he blows those great Winds of Faith to us and we're so grateful for that amen you know tonight I've asked the David Jr to speak for us I thought when Billy said we have Brother David come out there he definitely could have got that right and you know I watched AV over the years and he's always been a minister he's always prayed for the sick he's always sat down and counseled the Brokenhearted he's always tried to share the Lord wherever he can go and and uh I I think that anybody can be a preacher but it's hard to be somebody that just ministers and I believe he has a lot of love for God's people and for uh the church and a lot of experience and behind the years that he spent in this gospel so we've just asked him to come this evening and share with us what the Lord's put on his heart so let's sing that last verse again as As We Worship the Lord this evening amen [Music] amen oh watch the eagle [Music] does not struggle [Music] [Applause] said to the winds oh you can fly in a minute do not struggle it's my grace [Music] amen let's just go before him gracious Heavenly Father we're here because you're the voice that's called us Lord each of us has a portion of faith that we've been made responsible for lord it's because our ears have heard the gospel and Faith's come by that hearing and it's leading us on a path it's a journey Lord and we just want to fill a ship around those things Lord for we believe you're we're your children Lord we're the Seed of Abraham and the Lord as such it were a special called out separated people father there's a Heritage that's ours Lord and there's an adversary that doesn't want us to take possession of those things father so we just ask that you'd come in the Simplicity of your word that you'd be each of our portion we commit ourselves to you father you know our frame Lord and we know you care above what we could even imagine you're so mindful of each one Lord and I just ask that you would deal with each heart seek the Lost Minister healing the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen well I know I'm pretty common to a lot of you and maybe some as we've grown maybe not so common but I feel I would take the opportunity to at least apologize to all the parents they've always had to say don't do as Davey do so and if I was to give Davey advice you know it may be to floss the teeth you want to keep and you know wear your retainer if you have braces but I really don't want to hear me tonight I have no desire for that so if we just turn in the word to Galatians 3 a portion of scripture that uh want a fellowship on in 3 verse 8 and I may back up but the core of it is there Galatians 3 and verse 8. we'll just wait for it to be displayed we'll move on and the scriptures foreseen that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel to Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed you know as the Seed of Abraham I think it's something when we look back to the father of our faith he was preached the gospel you can be seated well just Fellowship in the Lord from there amen you know I I Marvel at this book of Galatians especially when you when you see how you know Paul would come and Minister it and he would start out in chapter three he would say oh foolish Galatians and uh I I uh and you you come through and he sums it up you get to the end he calls us the Seed of Abraham and the faith you know in Romans 10 it talks about hate how faith is delivered is by the preaching of the word and here's Abraham receiving a promise that he had to believe in faith he actually receives it in in Genesis 12 if we would turn there but the reading I actually like is where he expresses the promise more in 18 and we'll turn there too but in chapter 12 of Genesis 1-3 he would read it now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and unto a land I will show thee and the Seed of Abraham is always on a journey it's a there's a get thee out and I it doesn't matter where you're at if you're a Seed of Abraham and you're going to follow the leading of the seed that's in you there's a crying for maturity that that is in the seed and if there is a thought that I would would share it would be the Journey of the seed God calls for maturity and that's what I would would pray that each one the Lord would allow you to see is that you know we're not just born mature and and maybe even understanding all things but brother Branham and many times would take the time to tell us what it would mean to be uh born again and and that your Journey's begun and we know that type was a type of the promised land when you crossed over Jordan you went into the promised land the scripture even talks about how the Lord didn't just deliver the land of all the beasts that inhabited or the inhabitants of it he said the Beast would come in but there was a process by which they would go in and take the land and it was even an exercising of their faith because each tribe had been given an allotment and there was a portion and it was for them to take the land and the all these things are given to us as an example the the thing that's probably the most significant and why I I would believe that the time of Abraham you look at the ministry it it's the perfect type of a gentile receiving a dispensation of Grace the promise to Abraham was not a conditional Covenant it was an unconditional Covenant and and invert that's what I like about Verse 18 of Genesis Jesus the voice of God to Abraham which we know is Christ telling him shall I hide that thing which I do it from Abraham already predetermined and and that's what I see what I read in the book of Galatians here's this prophecy that all the nations the heathen and there's a pleading with the Galatians to not lose the Liberty that they have they're not justified by the law and such a precious righteousness we have our joy is our strength so you just pray for me you know if the waters get troubled we're just gonna press through I remember one time I was asked to lead songs I cried the whole time through it all right you know but when Sons precious to you it really it it should be felt if if it's not felt you should bury it and and the there was a Zeal of Abraham he was always getting stronger in the faith now the so many things could have worked towards condemnation of Abraham you you go through it yet none of those things are accounted to him because there was a Zeal he had for the promise he was given and that is what was counted to him to righteousness and you're the Seed of Abraham you know I the devil's crafty I I doubt that he came to any of you and said did you mix your Cottons and your linens today did you drink any milk with your meat did he did he really go to you and plead the true love the law no no but we're not but he would condemn you by the law and that's when you read the book of Galatians that here it is being pled on our behalf that hey you're not under the law amen now if you're the Seed of Abraham you don't love the things of the world amen now that's your heart your flesh is always going to condemn you we're in this world your flesh is of this world but have you been born again of the Seed of Abraham do you have a love for the things of God in you amen right so there's your justification that Life of Christ in you crying out for maturity don't let anything paralyze your growth [Music] that's where the Pentecost where everything fell is the growth that they're called to and you know by God's grace we could maybe Fellowship around what that growth looks like because there's a journey if you even look at the children of Israel coming out of Egypt there's a point in time where there's some that don't go over the Jordan they set up camp they didn't enter into the full Promised Land you know and that's given to us as an example where we would behoove ourselves and brother Branham says that was Pentecost now you would think that partaking in the outpouring of the holy spirit that that wouldn't be it but he said what showed that they did is they set up camp they they separated themselves with things that was important to them it's just where their priority was it wasn't that there was more to be had but they found it more important to find fault and to draw circles and that's that's us you know that's the sad part is you know but if it cuts it's all right sorry this is uh Jehovah Jireh in 61. oh 209 I think it's a little before paragraph 27. now when did Abraham's seed lose this Great Fellowship when they went down into Egypt they never lost his Covenant he lost his Blessing and that's what I'm trying to get to the people tonight the Pentecostal church has lost its former blessing there's something wrong we know that anybody that ever read the history of the church knows that there's something wrong with the church now you haven't lost your Covenant but you lost your blessing come back to the promised land come back to the word come back to Christ this is take this to our hearts stop looking saying our denomination is bigger than theirs they're old buzzards roosting and worse something stop doing that come back to the Lord Jesus come back to the real Church reach out your arms for every Fallen brother amen there you are come back God hasn't taken his Covenant away from you but your blessing is gone because you've gotten worldly went out in the world been a flirting with the world then you're out of the promise but the Covenant still holds only thing you have to do is come back amen and when God made his Covenant with Abraham remember it was unconditionally and God called you not because you was a good person thank you Lord amen but because unconditionally he called you and by his grace he gave you the Holy Spirit right faith is a gift of God lest any man should boast amen but that's another thing of the seat of Abraham if you look at Abraham when in in Genesis 18 when he says what I should hide that thing from Abraham that which I doeth he was about to go down to Sodom and judge him and you see a nature of Abraham when he starts to plead and he isn't yeah they think they are right but if they studied the message if they heard what quotes are important to me you know that that's not the attitude of a Seed of Abraham it's pre-adventure Lord pre-adventure maybe they just haven't got the revelations what's the nature that's being displayed the nature of Abraham doesn't say Lord consume him with fire it doesn't call for judgment it calls for Mercy it calls for a long suffering calls for Grace so we're the Seed of Abraham amen that's our fellowship and as the Seed of Abraham I believe we're being called to maturity there's a maturity that it has to come to there's a journey of the seed as you look at it I I feel that in some ways what happens is when you mature there's an expectation you have of others sometimes and we and we lean into that but we have to allow for the same growth there has to be you know you put the the corn seed in the ground and you let it grow I think sometimes we just want popcorn we want that instant hey just have a sensation you know just have an experience or or just you know what pet my religious IQ and just let succumb to my influence I just want to see my influence exercised in your life and we don't want to see a true spiritual growth and that's because really it a lot of times you know it's just a matter of having confidence in the word of God to perform that which it's sent to do be still know that I'm God it's one planet one watereth and David Jr gives the increase right where's all the glory go I really appreciate what our Pastor said this morning it's whose Church who's leading the church really when it comes down to it who's leading the church are we playing church is the confidence that we have is that all we sees the humanity we're called out they're playing Church a lot of places they're living in a light for another day they're not going to ever come to the maturity but we have seen a sheath wave offering we're gathered around the promised word of full maturity and there's things in that I this is the thing that would behoove us where we're at right now we're being called to a land that we've never been to before and if you don't feel that call check up because I ain't seen anybody having a body change yet and we've had people step over and they've received it but we're going to be translated has anybody gone this way before but Abraham was called out to go sojourn in the land that's we've received that promise just as he received a promise we've been asked to believe that you're going to receive a body change how because this message that's come has provided a prophesied bride amen we live in the day of a voice amen amen things that are to be the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the Bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature is it growing is it growing that that's Lord let it grow and by letting it grow is something stunting the growth the promise of the life of the seed is that it will produce he's you know these are things that God said Let each seed bring forth of his kind you haven't been bored of a denominational seed you haven't been born of the will of man you've been born by the word of God the the this message is more precious to us than we realize I it you we we were just fellowshipping the other day someone looked up what the world wants you to do to be a minister it's completely Godless guidance it's like they turned it in to Academia it's like a process like do this do that in no place does it even say like receive the Holy Ghost be led of the spirit I mean like God's out of it right but that's not our heritage this is all God this is his doing this isn't what man's done but uh amen to the full stature therefore if the corner wheat of Christ had fall had to fall on the ground so did the bride this is the bride from every age had to fall into the ground through the Dark Ages any grain that goes into the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he establishes on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer Mart of them had to go into the dirt into the Earth in the dark ages to bring forth again in the age of Luther and to come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for though this last day there was Brides through every ages we know that they received the word for their day but you know in in each day there was people who received the word for their day and as there was a blending of a dispensation they walked forward in the light they didn't stay there and when you put the period That's What brother Branham said Pentecost did that was wrong so they put the period well we've spoke in tongues period well we've done this period and we've got such a beautiful message of truths and I don't care what the truth is it's the truth but if that's where you put the period at you're dying you're not walking in the light you haven't come to full maturity and it's not that those things aren't true but if they separate you from your brother I mean we don't you really don't want to be judged by the law I mean that's that's the thing then yeah you're going to judge yourself don't do it there's no worthiness as soon as you open that up you can't put it back in if that's what he says he said if you're gonna you're a debtor to the whole law You've Lost Your Blessing you've just made yourself a debtor to the whole law you know the law is there to make guilty everybody else but there's somebody could go in and eat the show bread there's a liberty that the bride has and it's it's real and it's because there's nothing could be laid to her charge but as soon as she takes herself out from underneath that and starts trying to crucify someone else don't do it now let our righteousness shine you know let's not do sinful things let you know what I'd rather you show my Liberty by the things I don't do that I'm not in bondage to them right I mean I I in junior high seen a kid we play this game called quarters don't want to give anybody any bad ideas I've given enough of those I won't maybe go into too much details but you know people would start this kid would lose his shoes and it was it was like the next time he was going to win and I've seen that demon of gambling on somebody it was the next time I'm gonna get it he had it bad I'm just a kid but it was a demon you could see the influence on him I I use that I don't know if anybody struggled with that but I don't I've never had to battle that but if I knew someone I took advantage of people at that time that had that problem I'll admit it Lord forgive me but you see what I'm saying the Liberty I would have to be able to flirt with that thing and not be in bondage to it why would I do that in front of someone who's in bondage to it do you really love the person so you know it's not that all things don't have a there's a liberty it's like Brother David says you could play football you could do those things you know but if that's what has consumed you you know if that's really where your love's at then you've missed it and and be careful that your meat doesn't offend your brother because there's some things that that some people do have bondage to all right you know there's there's a there's an innocence a lot of times when people are messing with things because they don't understand the extent to which they go and if if you listen to The Godly discernment of your parents or some some people who know that protect you from a lot of Heartache because you're flirting with the with bondage that you don't that you're not in right I mean the Lord wants to keep you from it and there's a chastisement and a correction you know there's a something and we'll just go here predestination is is a blessing it the devil hates it because it tells them where he's going and we love it because it tells us where we're going I mean Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you hallelujah amen so we we take that and it's true here's the destination but you're a seed what what fruit do you what inheritance do you want to have when you get there how much fruit do you want to bear do you want to just show up and you have the talent nothing that what fruit do you want to bear in that Journey those are the choices you make now I trust the Lord that the promises he has the things that were meant for evil God will use to the good we have promises we fortify ourselves in but people have pierced themselves through with many Sorrows because they've loved the things of this world and they've been they've tantalized things and I would say by the grace of God put away those things they don't sin will keep you longer than you want to say stay it may seem Innocent but you know you know if it ain't right it don't even need to go into specifics you know the Lord could just stay away from it you know there was something we learned over in Israel they have a concept to approaching the law they said they they put barriers so we've we I've heard the scripture that you should not boil the kid in its mother's milk and that's we find that in our our Bible in the levitical laws and that the kid being a goat but Cosman got told that he couldn't bring a drink into the the hamburger joint because the guy came up and this is a young teenage kid says what's in the cup it was like coffee did you add cream yes get out if you're in a restaurant and we serve meat we don't want the milk with the meat so they Amplified the law they said we'll put a barrier just to avoid even the possibility of you having meat with milk we'll we'll avoid the very appearance of evil don't be drawn away of worldly lust amen just get rid of the whole thing if amen avoid the appearance of evil I'll say this there's protection in the law and doing those things until you get the Holy Ghost to Legion so to follow the letter of the law amen amen but as we journey I found one of the things that was exciting to me is that the Lord understands where we're at he understands the maturity of our faith he actually understands the challenge that we face that's why we've been given a a witness such a great witness that's why we have a message to restore the faith is because it has the ability to produce the life and you know we have been given this Natural Life to even better understand our spiritual growth there's things that when you were a child you probably didn't understand that you look back at now and they make perfect sense as a Christian in the Christian Life as a in the walk that we have we're going to come to the place where the things that we've talked about as being Eternal become a reality we step over to the other side brother Brandon said it's a world world we're going to live there amen that's our that's our heritage want to take this quote that said Abraham and his seed it's a 6104-23 and he eats just speaking of I believe what what I said about growing he says and that's what we are now think about it what's that going to be what's the world where we can pass from Glory why when we take a scope and we a scope and see 120 million light years space that ain't 1 16 of an inch in eternity amen I mean we can't even put a chart or a graph up here to explain you could take the best telescope you have and look a billion light years out and you can't even measure that as a sixteenth of an inch in eternity we can't understand those things now if anybody come talk to me later I'll enjoy I'll listen Hallelujah Glory but Jesus come from Heaven to Earth in a thought amen he's that that he's that close to you now amen we could step from this into the Eternal presence of God he could catch you just like that he's the Seeker of those who are lost amen he's denied them of a broken heart and you know what the best category is lost in a way right because if you don't know where you're at you qualify he's seeking you so if you didn't know where you were at in your spiritual growth you could say Lord you're seeking me you're coming for me Hallelujah and when he finds you there ain't nothing like the hand of Jehovah no there ain't amen maybe there will be a time where I could Fellowship around some of the things the Lord's brought me through but I can't hardly think about him without crying I'll tell you that he's been so good to me his his grace his long suffering his goodness and if I could tell you I I would say it you know he loves you more than you realize maybe I'll share one experience is pretty profound never could explain it I was my dad was remodeling a house out in Grapevine and uh you can take that but uh you know I it was I was around 18 years old I was going through a hard time I was pretty broken-hearted for various reasons can't remember why but I know our emotions sometimes can be bigger than we are and uh in my heart I was asking the Lord why those things are those ways and a young kid probably about seven or eight runs down the fence line mountain and working in a backyard it's the neighbor's yard and I'm pulling cable out of the house I'm walking electric cable I'm pulling it so I've walked away from the house just pulling a long run and the kid runs up and he's shouting my name and I've never seen the kid before didn't know him he says David so I'm like trying to make sure I'm hearing my name by the third time he says it I'm just like yeah I mean he had me and he said Jesus cares how you feel and I said what and his mom was yelling at him from the house and I stood there like is this some kind of prophet you know what just happened but he cares that much [Music] amen we'll just turned it over and to Brother David and pray the Lord be your portion and just encourage you along the way God bless you [Applause] thank you amen amen I enjoyed that to know the things that matter you know what I mean that's I think that's the thing to Value the things that you really have just to think that our portion is the love of God the Forgiveness of our sins the commitment that he's made to each of us that in no wise would he forsake us that nothing would pluck us out of the palm of the hand his hand I guess as David spoke I just thought in my own self how easily I forget the simple things when the confusion comes all around just go back I never chose him he chose me amen I didn't find him he found me amen I didn't save myself he saved me amen I can't do one thing for my salvation okay so he would have died in vain and if we could love one another we're in the love that he loved us and if we could give to others everything that he gave us and it's got to go beyond our tent you know just it's that let the light shine I just feel in my heart that that's something that I want I believe God's going to have a real Church and that Capstone is really coming deeper and deeper into our hearts and into our lives to do those things let's stand this evening if the brothers would go prepare the communion like what they might communion scripture here and we'll turn into First Corinthians the 11th chapter you know this is a great opportunity when you commune with somebody in you talk with somebody um when I meet my friends that my old friends and my friends that I've had for years and years and years one of the things that's always a part of our conversation is what we call reminiscing do you remember when it used to be simple do you remember when there used to just be a few of us do you remember when things weren't so complicated do you remember when you knew everybody in church and everybody's name and and everybody was in diapers you know and now we've got children and grandchildren and and you reminisce when I meet an old buddy from high school or someone that I went through the message with you could reminisce I was visiting with brother Ron Peterson the other day and we started reminiscing all the different things we went through the time that I got locked out of my home and I had to spend time on his at his house that evening and and of course I was giving him a hard time we showed up it was rainy and dark and cold and had no place to go knocked on his door he gets up and and comes to the door and hears me and Leslie standing there with Sharon and he said man we don't got no place to go and he says well come on in and he gave us a spot on the floor to sleep on I kind of wished he'd give me his bed I let him know that all the time and and we he threw some blankets on the floor and we're on the floor and that morning last week he cuts up she was just a had a few diapers and they went to their washing machine and she washed the diapers we had only cloth diapers in those days for any of you young mothers you know but and all her diapers just came to pieces and just and she was standing over the washing machine crying as she pulled her diapers they were just shredded and Sandy came up and said well I have some diapers and and you know you you talk about those times and what you're doing is you're communing you're talking about all the things that got you to where you are all the things we've been to Ron has a church in Phoenix I have a church out here but remembered all our Boyhood days cutting Timber together and stacking logs and all the stuff that we went through that brought us to where we are that's communion and we talk about the battles he's fighting with his daughter and and and and encouraging one another in the Lord that's what you do with communion you go to the Lord and you think about where he brought you from when he talked to David he said David remember you were just in the Sheepfold and I raised you up and made you a king I was lost out in the world and you came found me and you talk it over with them and you reach out and tell you touch that great love vein that he has for you and you put him first in your mind and you put all that he done for you and how good he's been to you and all that he saved you from and you let that begin to come up in you and you tell them that you love them and that you're thankful and you're having a communion you have regrets that's why he died he died to take your regrets away the chastisement of our peace was upon him he took this suffering that we could have peace and we can have it abundantly in him by his stripes we are healed and we think of the promises that communion this is what communion is it's our time to reminisce and to fellowship and to commune with what a great God we have and as our brother spoke tonight that we purpose in our heart that we'll love with the same love that he loved us we'll forgive with the same forgiveness that he forgave us we'll turn the other cheek just like King David when he left the city and they began to speak spit on him he says no he says don't you know the Lord you know and just give everybody the benefit of the doubt I think the pressure that the world's trying to put on us will find out someone's got the pressure all in control and it's the one that loves us Amen Let us read for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me remembrance reminiscing remembering me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this D as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come whereforever whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord and if I could just add a little bit it's not that your life's mistake free you know that you haven't failed because you can repent and he's faithful and just to forgive you but if you come to communion with malice in your heart and hatred in your heart and bitterness in your heart after all that he forgave you of okay that's what you don't want to defile not the failures of your flesh but if you've got bitterness or you've got malice or you've got ought against somebody don't take communion till you make that right if you failed his grace is sufficient for you you repent of that you purpose in Your Heart Lord help me overcome you do what David said tonight you find the things that are causing it and you walk away from it you build a wall and you close the gate and then come and partake the main thing is don't partake with hatred or bitterness that defiles the very love that caused him to lay down his life he says but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup examine yourself I'm wrong Lord that wasn't right I'm sorry I'll make it right for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body once again to the malice hatred not looking on that person the way God looks upon him not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that you we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come amen I would have liked to have been there for the meeting when Paul said that church in order but I'm thankful that I have a in the storehouse of the Lord I have how our messenger set our church in order amen Lord richly bless you you may be seated that's all pray together and and and each of you pray if I could say it for the piece of the bread that you're going to be partaking of you pray for the wine that you're partaking of in other words you pray for the portion that you're going to receive from communion tonight Lord give me something tonight do something for me let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father the bread is broken father representing your body father and that we can partake of it that it's made indeed in life indeed there's life in your word father and we're so grateful for it and we remembered this evening the love that sent you to us Lord the burden of that love that you were so willing to take that when you realize the cup that lied before you you asked father let this cup pass from me but nevertheless thy will be done and father you went to Calvary for each of us this evening to everyone that could read it hear it talk about it be shared with other you win it For All Mankind for your Wills that none should perish father some just turn away and walk away but this evening father we're here to receive of you we ask you to bless this bread to us we take it in remembrance of you and your love for us Heavenly Father this wine that represents your ability father to give us revelation to change our spirits and our hearts and our nature your ability to heal our diseases and to change our lives your ability to deliver us out of every circumstance and situation to you be the glory father we remember the Mighty God that we serve that all things are possible that there's nothing too great for our God we remember your love we
