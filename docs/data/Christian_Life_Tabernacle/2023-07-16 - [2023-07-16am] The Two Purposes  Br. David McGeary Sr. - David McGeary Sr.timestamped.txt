[19:43] I want to welcome everyone and all our
[19:45] visitors God bless you this morning turn
[19:47] around and welcome someone this morning
[19:48] amen
[19:52] a man will fight for the night before I
[19:54] saw him reading this morning
[19:55] amen God bless you and have your seats
[20:15] I'm grateful for the rain this morning
[20:17] it arrived in time for church
[20:20] right on time
[20:22] you know I don't know about you but when
[20:24] I read the scriptures and I see
[20:27] the scriptures repeating itself if
[20:29] there's ever a phrase or a statement or
[20:31] whatever that it repeats itself it
[20:34] usually causes me to stop and pay extra
[20:38] special attention
[20:40] you know we know that all scripture is
[20:42] given by inspiration of God and is
[20:44] profitable
[20:45] that's what II Timothy 3 16 tells us
[20:48] every word every statement
[20:51] inspired by God so
[20:54] when he repeats himself
[20:56] it causes at least should cause us to
[20:59] pause a minute
[21:00] and see what he's putting his emphasis
[21:03] on so
[21:05] you know
[21:06] when you read that he repeats himself 26
[21:10] times
[21:11] in one particular passage of scripture
[21:15] that's going to give my attention
[21:18] when we read Psalm 136
[21:23] there's something that he repeats 26
[21:25] times
[21:27] at the end of every verse
[21:31] something's being emphasized here and
[21:35] catches our attention he says this at
[21:37] the end of every verse he says for his
[21:39] mercy endureth forever
[21:44] it's an entire portion of scripture
[21:46] devoted to thanking God
[21:50] for his continuous
[21:53] constant
[21:54] unending mercy
[21:58] you know we might
[21:59] read this scripture and kind of dismiss
[22:02] it as well it's you know
[22:04] it's a worship song
[22:05] they
[22:07] you know like any song even that you
[22:09] might hear today it often will take the
[22:11] same phrase and repeat it several times
[22:13] to create an atmosphere
[22:16] but this one made it to the scriptures
[22:20] where all scripture is profitable we're
[22:22] all scripture is given by inspiration
[22:27] it opens in verse one o give thanks unto
[22:29] the Lord for he is good
[22:32] for his mercy endureth forever
[22:35] and it ends in verse 26 o give thanks
[22:38] unto the god of Heaven
[22:40] for his mercy endureth forever
[22:45] but what caught my attention were the
[22:47] verses in between
[22:49] because every time the psalm mentions
[22:52] God performing a work
[22:55] it follows that work with the statement
[22:58] for his mercy endureth forever
[23:02] you know that little three-letter word
[23:04] for
[23:06] is a big word
[23:09] it means
[23:10] because
[23:12] it's the word
[23:14] used to connect an action
[23:18] with the reason or the purpose
[23:21] behind the action
[23:22] [Music]
[23:25] it means for this reason
[23:27] for this purpose
[23:31] I got up this morning
[23:33] I put on my Sunday best
[23:36] and I got in the car
[23:38] for church this morning
[23:40] there was a reason
[23:42] there was a purpose
[23:45] so when we look at this resume of works
[23:48] that God has done
[23:51] in Psalm 136
[23:54] and each one followed by the statement
[23:56] for his Mercy
[23:58] endureth forever
[24:01] it's more than just a phrase from a two
[24:04] thousand year old worship song
[24:06] it's the continuing reason or the
[24:09] purpose behind his working
[24:13] let's look at a couple of examples
[24:16] in verse 4 he doeth great wonders for
[24:20] his mercy endureth forever
[24:24] because his mercy endureth forever
[24:29] the reason he does the Wonders is
[24:33] because of his Mercy family
[24:37] the Wonders or the actions
[24:40] The Works he performs
[24:43] his Mercy
[24:45] is the reason he does it
[24:47] it's the motivation it's the purpose
[24:49] behind the work
[24:52] in verse 5 he made the heavens
[24:55] the Heavenly Realm
[24:57] because of his Mercy
[25:00] in verse 6 he stretched out the Earth
[25:03] above the waters
[25:05] because of his Mercy
[25:08] it's not because of our science or
[25:09] politics that holds this world into
[25:11] place it's because of his Mercy that's
[25:13] right amen
[25:15] do we go on and read and
[25:18] describes all the works that God did he
[25:21] smote the firstborn of Egypt
[25:23] he brought Israel out from among them
[25:26] he divided the Red Sea to provide a way
[25:29] where there was no way
[25:31] because of his Mercy
[25:34] he used that same way to overthrow their
[25:37] enemy
[25:39] he led his people through the wilderness
[25:41] he defeated great Kings and then he gave
[25:44] Their Kingdoms to his people because of
[25:47] his Mercy
[25:50] he did it all because of his continuous
[25:53] unending never failing Mercy
[25:58] every work that the Lord performed
[26:01] is his Mercy in action
[26:07] and here's one I think we can say Amen
[26:09] to in verse 23 he remembered us in our
[26:11] lowest state
[26:14] and redeemed us from our enemies
[26:17] because of his Mercy
[26:21] it's not because of our family
[26:24] it's not because of our intelligence
[26:27] or of our goodness
[26:29] or our nationality there's no reason at
[26:32] all
[26:33] because of his Mercy
[26:37] it's what caused him to do his work
[26:40] Mercy is his work
[26:45] everything he does every work he
[26:48] performs
[26:50] is because of his continuous Non-Stop
[26:54] Mercy
[26:55] think of it he has to do nothing
[26:58] but by his Mercy
[27:00] he performs work
[27:04] it's a very motivation for his work
[27:08] it's not something he offers and fits
[27:10] and starts
[27:12] you know be based on circumstances or
[27:15] based on how we feel or
[27:18] how good we've been
[27:20] his Mercy
[27:22] is a continuous Focus
[27:25] directed at a specific people
[27:30] all the work he performs is driven by
[27:34] his Mercy for these ones
[27:38] what people
[27:40] will the people of his choosing
[27:43] you know the Lord told Moses in Exodus
[27:45] 33 17. it's a it's a wonderful passage
[27:50] this conversation between Moses and the
[27:52] Lord he says I will do this thing also
[27:55] that thou Hast spoken
[27:57] for thou has found Grace in my sight
[28:02] and I Know Thee by name
[28:05] someone of his choosing
[28:08] he goes on to say I will make all my
[28:12] goodness
[28:14] pass before thee
[28:17] how many can say Amen to that
[28:20] amen and I will proclaim the name of the
[28:23] Lord before thee
[28:26] and will be gracious to whom I will be
[28:29] gracious
[28:31] and will show Mercy on whom I will show
[28:34] Mercy
[28:37] in verse 20 once again speaking to the
[28:40] one who he has chosen by name
[28:44] thou canst not see my face
[28:47] for there shall
[28:48] no man see me and live
[28:52] and the Lord said behold there is a
[28:54] place by me
[28:56] and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[28:59] shall come to pass while my Glory
[29:00] passeth by
[29:03] that I will put thee in a cliff of The
[29:04] Rock
[29:06] and will cover thee with my hand while I
[29:08] pass by
[29:10] and will take away mine hand and thou
[29:12] shalt see my back parts
[29:15] but my face shall not be seen
[29:19] now this actually happens in the next
[29:20] chapter
[29:22] 34 6 and the Lord passed by before him
[29:25] and proclaimed the Lord
[29:29] the Lord God
[29:31] merciful
[29:32] and gracious
[29:34] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[29:37] and Truth
[29:39] keeping Mercy
[29:42] for thousands
[29:44] you know when the hand of the Lord
[29:46] passed by
[29:48] when the work of the Lord
[29:51] Came Upon the scene
[29:53] what was declared
[29:56] in his passing
[29:58] was his Mercy
[30:02] for the one who he called by name
[30:05] and who had been placed there by him
[30:09] you know as I was reading that it became
[30:12] so clear
[30:14] everything he does
[30:16] every work that he performs is the
[30:21] manifestation or the Declaration of his
[30:23] continuing unending never failing Mercy
[30:27] for a people
[30:30] for those who he knows by name
[30:32] every work
[30:34] you know that means that no matter what
[30:37] our circumstance
[30:38] how we feel
[30:40] what situation we find ourselves in
[30:44] even when we don't understand it that is
[30:47] his work of Mercy
[30:50] it's his Mercy at work
[30:56] it's the place where we find ourselves
[30:58] when the hand of God is at work
[31:01] is that place of his Mercy
[31:05] are you grateful for his Mercy enduring
[31:08] forever
[31:09] let's stand this morning and let's read
[31:11] Psalm 136 together
[31:14] [Applause]
[31:17] starting in verse 1.
[31:20] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[31:22] good for his mercy endureth forever o
[31:26] give thanks unto the god of gods for his
[31:28] mercy endureth forever o give thanks to
[31:31] the Lord of lords for his mercy and
[31:34] Earth forever to him who alone doeth
[31:36] great wonders for his mercy endureth
[31:39] forever to him that by wisdom made the
[31:42] heavens for his mercy endureth forever
[31:44] to him that stretched out the Earth
[31:46] above the waters for his Mercy into
[31:49] Earth forever to him that made great
[31:51] lights for his mercy endureth forever
[31:54] the son to rule by day for his mercy
[31:57] endureth forever the moon and stars to
[32:00] rule by night for his mercy endureth
[32:03] forever to him that smote Egypt in their
[32:06] firstborn for his mercy endureth forever
[32:09] and brought out Israel from among them
[32:11] for his mercy endureth forever with a
[32:14] strong hand and with a stretched out arm
[32:17] for his mercy endureth forever to him
[32:19] and which divided the Red Sea into parts
[32:22] for his mercy endureth forever and made
[32:25] Israel to pass through the midst of it
[32:27] for his mercy endureth forever but
[32:30] overthrew pharaoh and his host in the
[32:32] Red Sea for his mercy endureth forever
[32:35] to him which led his people through the
[32:38] Wilderness for his mercy endureth
[32:40] forever Tim which spoke great Kings for
[32:43] his mercy endureth forever and slew
[32:46] famous Kings for his mercy endureth
[32:49] forever Sion King of the amorites for
[32:52] his mercy endureth forever an OG the
[32:55] king of Bashan for his mercy endureth
[32:57] forever and gave their land for
[32:59] inheritage for his mercy endureth
[33:02] forever even in Heritage unto Israel his
[33:05] servant for his mercy endureth forever
[33:07] who remembered us in our lowest state
[33:10] for his Mercy endures forever and hath
[33:13] redeemed us from our enemies for his
[33:15] mercy endureth forever who giveth food
[33:18] to All Flesh for his mercy endureth

[1:04:52] to do everything
[1:04:55] in the power of Your Love
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:11] the writers finally wrote and said God
[1:05:14] is love
[1:05:19] when he wanted to describe his church he
[1:05:22] said they will know that you are my
[1:05:24] disciples by your love
[1:05:26] one for another
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:32] when at what time to describe
[1:05:35] the savior's great work he said God so
[1:05:38] loved the world
[1:05:40] he gave his only begotten son
[1:05:46] Lord somehow this morning if that love
[1:05:48] could be shed abroad in your word
[1:05:54] the one writer wrote he said love is
[1:05:57] corrective
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:02] love doesn't think of itself and
[1:06:05] flaunteth not itself
[1:06:09] but it's Meek and it's humble
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:16] Lord word

[1:07:44] too but I know the Energizer don't you
[1:07:47] hallelujah amen let's open our Bibles
[1:07:51] this morning and uh
[1:07:56] to Ephesians the first chapter and read
[1:08:00] a few verses there this morning
[1:08:04] and it will go into our service we like
[1:08:06] to welcome all our guests
[1:08:09] our our guests from Oklahoma that are
[1:08:18] building
[1:08:20] did I did I did you lose me did I go
[1:08:23] I'm okay
[1:08:27] oh they're gonna switch me
[1:08:55] all right I've been wired
[1:09:00] amen well anyway we have like our guests
[1:09:03] from uh
[1:09:05] Oklahoma and I was visiting with the
[1:09:08] brother the other day they're insulating
[1:09:10] the uh
[1:09:12] uh
[1:09:14] building over there and he he came and
[1:09:17] uh sat down began to talk with me and he
[1:09:20] said you know I I noticed that uh
[1:09:23] you you worked real hard all day long
[1:09:26] and everything and after this was
[1:09:29] Wednesday and he said and then after you
[1:09:31] worked all day long you you got up and
[1:09:33] preached the gospel
[1:09:35] he said how do you do that
[1:09:37] and I don't know you know I the whole
[1:09:41] gifts to get yourself out of the way
[1:09:44] and he said me says well he says you
[1:09:47] know I like this study and there's a lot
[1:09:49] of preachers like that he said when I
[1:09:52] when I asked the minister he said I
[1:09:54] don't even uh I don't I take the whole
[1:09:57] day off I don't even work and I thought
[1:10:00] man
[1:10:01] I was thinking of asking them to preach
[1:10:05] but if if he
[1:10:08] is going to take the whole day off I can
[1:10:12] I I don't know what to do you know what
[1:10:15] I mean so maybe if he takes half a day
[1:10:18] out like that maybe I could talk to him
[1:10:22] about tonight but I don't know I just
[1:10:25] ruined a service for him but
[1:10:28] I'm a firm believer in that scripture
[1:10:30] instant in season and out in season
[1:10:33] believe me I think a lot of the brothers
[1:10:35] will testify I promised the brothers I
[1:10:38] would do one thing one month I'm going
[1:10:41] to lay out every service a month in
[1:10:43] advance now
[1:10:48] uh
[1:10:50] the Lord can change anything anytime
[1:10:54] right so you know the little disclaimers
[1:10:57] that are written on the bottom is this
[1:11:00] is subject to this this is the subject
[1:11:02] to that it it certainly will that day
[1:11:04] also uh we we have
[1:11:08] uh some of Cindy Martinez's family in
[1:11:13] from Chicago and they fellowship with us
[1:11:15] and and listen online to some of the
[1:11:18] services and things and uh they're in
[1:11:21] the back we're all standing so they they
[1:11:23] don't stand out but anyway we welcome
[1:11:26] them and and there's kind of a really
[1:11:29] unique testimony there
[1:11:31] somehow they had heard about uh looking
[1:11:34] online they they ran across
[1:11:37] our service and they felt to listen to
[1:11:40] it they can tell the testimony better
[1:11:43] than I can
[1:11:44] so they were
[1:11:47] streaming the service and and I'll just
[1:11:51] be honest with you I'm not a big
[1:11:53] believer in streaming because it comes
[1:11:56] becomes a substitute and and but I
[1:12:00] understand some people get in this
[1:12:03] situation they need this dream
[1:12:06] is that time to quit already
[1:12:09] all right turn off your alarms turn off
[1:12:12] your phones before you come into the
[1:12:13] sanctuary thank you and uh
[1:12:17] so they're they're streaming and work
[1:12:21] having prayer
[1:12:22] uh for
[1:12:25] um you know brother brother Adrian and
[1:12:28] sister uh Cindy Martinez and were
[1:12:31] praying and they're listening and they
[1:12:34] say I wonder if it's the same Adrian and
[1:12:38] Cindy so they're listening to us pray
[1:12:41] for them online not even knowing that
[1:12:45] they were coming to our service I
[1:12:48] thought that was kind of unique and then
[1:12:50] they they found out they were and
[1:12:52] they've been listening and and they're
[1:12:54] wonderful people we really trust that
[1:12:56] the Lord speaks to their heart this
[1:12:58] morning you believe God's word this
[1:13:00] morning let's read this Ephesians
[1:13:04] we know Ephesians is a
[1:13:08] special book for us
[1:13:11] because the Ephesians is The Exodus into
[1:13:16] the spirit of God
[1:13:18] Galatians is a book that deals a lot
[1:13:21] with the carnal side of man but
[1:13:24] Ephesians is a book that deals with the
[1:13:27] spiritual side of man
[1:13:30] um
[1:13:31] and those two elements war against one
[1:13:36] another your flesh and your spirit are
[1:13:40] at War amen the flesh is contrary to the
[1:13:44] spirit and the spirits contrary to the
[1:13:47] flesh the spirit desires you to do
[1:13:50] things the flesh would never dream
[1:13:53] possible that's why we have to walk by
[1:13:56] faith in Revelation but let's read with
[1:13:58] Paul
[1:14:00] in writing this letter to the Ephesians
[1:14:03] and
[1:14:03] we know that scripture that we probably
[1:14:07] read over and over again in Ephesians
[1:14:11] you know you are our workmanship
[1:14:13] in Christ Jesus Ephesians 2 10 for we
[1:14:17] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:14:20] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:14:24] foreigned that we should walk in them
[1:14:27] great Revelation but we're going to read
[1:14:29] the first chapter starting in the first
[1:14:31] verse Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[1:14:35] the will of God to the Saints which are
[1:14:39] in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:14:43] Jesus
[1:14:45] Grace be to you and peace from God our
[1:14:49] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:53] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:14:57] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:15:01] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:15:05] places in Christ don't forget where that
[1:15:09] is it's in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:15:14] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:15:20] before the foundations of the world that
[1:15:25] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:15:29] before him in love
[1:15:33] having predestinated us under the
[1:15:36] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:15:40] himself
[1:15:41] according to the good pleasures of his
[1:15:46] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:15:50] grace wherein he hath made us acceptable
[1:15:55] in the Beloved Heavenly Father we ask
[1:15:59] you to bless us in your precious name we
[1:16:02] pray amen God bless you you may be
[1:16:05] seated
[1:16:06] this morning
[1:16:09] we are certainly uh
[1:16:12] blessed to be in the house of the Lord
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:15] and you know
[1:16:17] I I sit in the back many times and
[1:16:21] brother Mike will come up and and give
[1:16:25] his exhortation and it is so much down
[1:16:29] on the lines of what that uh is on my
[1:16:33] heart that uh
[1:16:36] sometimes it's such an encouragement and
[1:16:39] a blessing to me but the
[1:16:42] if I had a title this morning I would
[1:16:45] want to entitle it the two purposes
[1:16:50] the two purposes
[1:16:53] and the word
[1:16:55] purpose means the reason for which
[1:17:00] something is done
[1:17:02] or for which it exists
[1:17:07] so you exist this morning for a purpose
[1:17:11] and that's where we're going in our
[1:17:14] sermon this morning
[1:17:17] is that we might establish a
[1:17:22] that part of the purpose that we are
[1:17:30] speaking this morning is we're also
[1:17:33] addressing the subject of our thinking
[1:17:39] you understand I we we
[1:17:41] are aware and we've been talking about
[1:17:45] filtering
[1:17:47] how that you've got to filter everything
[1:17:51] through the word of God
[1:17:55] and when it's filtered through the word
[1:17:58] of God every desire every dream every
[1:18:02] decision and everything is filtered
[1:18:05] through God's word so what does the word
[1:18:08] of God do what's a filter do it takes
[1:18:10] out all the impurities
[1:18:13] all the deceptions all the uh uh lies
[1:18:19] and half truths and all those things
[1:18:22] when all those things thank you when all
[1:18:25] those things are filtered out in all you
[1:18:27] have on the other side is pure word then
[1:18:31] you have nothing but the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] that's what we want nothing but the
[1:18:36] spirit of God nothing but the Holy Ghost
[1:18:38] and we live in a very complicated world
[1:18:41] now uh this is the most deceptive age
[1:18:45] that there has ever been there's never
[1:18:47] been an age as deceitful as this age and
[1:18:52] part of that deceit is that Satan
[1:18:55] appears as an angel of Light that we
[1:19:00] don't recognize what that means Satan
[1:19:02] appearing as an angel of Light Eve never
[1:19:06] meant to to disobey God
[1:19:12] her intention was wow I can be like God
[1:19:18] you know and and as you know the
[1:19:21] expression has been expressed to us that
[1:19:24] the path to hell is paved with good
[1:19:28] intentions
[1:19:29] correct all right people have good
[1:19:32] intentions I have a burden I have a
[1:19:35] desire I have a burden to do this I have
[1:19:37] a burden to do that but it's not a
[1:19:40] filtered through the word of God the
[1:19:44] intention is good
[1:19:47] and the scripture told us that always
[1:19:49] seemeth right unto a man but the in that
[1:19:53] of that way is death in other words they
[1:19:56] look at their intentions they they look
[1:19:59] at what their desires are they they come
[1:20:02] up with all the great things that they
[1:20:05] want to do and they they want to express
[1:20:08] and and they end up doing God a service
[1:20:13] without it being his will
[1:20:17] and and it's not that man is evil but
[1:20:22] you've got to understand something your
[1:20:24] very makeup your very nature is that
[1:20:27] man's heart is far from God
[1:20:32] and
[1:20:33] our thinking is not his thinking
[1:20:39] he sees the beginning
[1:20:41] for the end in other words he knows why
[1:20:45] he created everything and the way that
[1:20:49] he created it
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:51] Amen in other words does our brother
[1:20:53] expressed he had a purpose in doing
[1:20:56] something he had he had a reason for
[1:21:00] which this whole thing exists
[1:21:05] now we want to get these things in our
[1:21:07] thinking this is not just a random uh
[1:21:12] life we're on
[1:21:15] this evil age that we're living in has
[1:21:19] been prophesied
[1:21:22] it has been told us that Satan would
[1:21:26] appear as an angel of Light
[1:21:32] that men
[1:21:34] out of their goodness of their heart
[1:21:38] would try to do God a service
[1:21:42] but that service never lines up with
[1:21:47] what his purpose was in the beginning
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:53] you know so many times I'm just going to
[1:21:55] throw this in here it's on my heart so
[1:21:58] many times the purpose of the baptism of
[1:22:02] the holy spirit is missed
[1:22:07] you were born with the nature all right
[1:22:10] you came into the world speaking lies
[1:22:13] you you have a survival Instinct in you
[1:22:19] and the the way you came into this world
[1:22:22] was a result of your marriage or your
[1:22:27] union to sin
[1:22:31] we came into the world through sin
[1:22:35] the very act between man and woman
[1:22:39] the first act that way was in the garden
[1:22:42] between the Beast and a woman yeah
[1:22:46] whatever came from that that was that
[1:22:50] act of bringing us into this world was
[1:22:54] an act of unbelief
[1:22:59] and of course we understand that that
[1:23:02] that was a deception now we are not
[1:23:06] guilty of that if I could say it that
[1:23:09] way but we inherited that sinful nature
[1:23:13] we inherited our mind we inherited our
[1:23:17] thinking uh just our flesh itself the
[1:23:20] fact that it it come into the world
[1:23:23] speaking lies well it was built on a lie
[1:23:27] that's right the very existence of the
[1:23:30] act that produced the the flesh was
[1:23:34] built on the LIE so if that was the
[1:23:37] purpose of it and the nature of it was
[1:23:39] deception then we're actually born into
[1:23:43] that deception so deception becomes our
[1:23:47] nature
[1:23:50] our human nature is designed to be
[1:23:54] deceived and too deceived
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:00] I think makeup's the biggest deception
[1:24:02] there ever is
[1:24:04] we heard the prophet of God said oh you
[1:24:07] look at those Ruby lips she said just
[1:24:10] remember there's fangs behind those
[1:24:12] things
[1:24:15] right making you know I won't go there
[1:24:18] that's about a two-hour sermon
[1:24:21] right there
[1:24:22] But but so you have this nature
[1:24:26] well the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:24:29] the change of nature
[1:24:33] you've got that in other words a new
[1:24:36] Nature has to be birthed in you that's
[1:24:39] why you have to be borned again and we
[1:24:43] know about the seed that's in us but if
[1:24:46] that seed is not brought to life by a
[1:24:49] birth
[1:24:50] it remains in the ground and rods
[1:24:56] so it's got to be brought to life
[1:24:59] it's Dante and that's what the spirit of
[1:25:02] God does is it brings that seed to life
[1:25:05] and so many miss it because they feel
[1:25:09] the baptism of the holy spirit is the
[1:25:11] anointing and they put the emphasis on
[1:25:15] the anointing instead of the revelations
[1:25:19] the church has been built on anointing
[1:25:22] it's built on Revelation
[1:25:27] so many people get the anointing but
[1:25:31] they don't get the revelation
[1:25:36] we know that
[1:25:38] Pentecost Brothers Stefan they ran with
[1:25:41] the anointing but they didn't have the
[1:25:43] revelation of why that anointing was
[1:25:46] given to him the Holy Spirit did not
[1:25:49] come to speak of itself but it came to
[1:25:51] bring us in remembrance of everything
[1:25:54] that Jesus taught
[1:25:57] it always goes back to the word in there
[1:26:01] the word so we know this morning
[1:26:05] that God had a purpose
[1:26:08] and and we're ministering this morning
[1:26:10] out of the message Christ The Mystery of
[1:26:13] God revealed and and he says these
[1:26:17] things
[1:26:18] he says now for a text I want to take
[1:26:21] out of there for a text based upon the
[1:26:24] entire Bible
[1:26:26] I want us to title this Christ is the
[1:26:30] mystery of God revealed Christ being the
[1:26:34] mystery of God revealed now I took it
[1:26:38] in order as a Sunday school lesson so we
[1:26:42] could
[1:26:42] all read together and have this
[1:26:46] Fellowship
[1:26:48] together
[1:26:50] this is not entertainment this morning
[1:26:54] you haven't come to watch me perform
[1:26:58] there's a lot better performers we have
[1:27:02] come this morning to Fellowship together
[1:27:04] there's no big eyes there's no little
[1:27:07] use I don't have some great Revelation
[1:27:10] that you don't have
[1:27:13] I I heard the same voice that you heard
[1:27:19] when I heard that voice it brought to
[1:27:23] life something in me that said this is
[1:27:27] the man of God
[1:27:28] this is the voice to our generation
[1:27:33] it struck me when I heard his voice I
[1:27:37] knew I couldn't tell you what it was
[1:27:40] like but I can say this my sheep know my
[1:27:42] voice and another they will not follow
[1:27:46] us there is no substitute for that voice
[1:27:51] listen to it in your life
[1:27:55] but he said here he said that until
[1:27:58] we're here to Fellowship together this
[1:28:00] morning now God's secret mystery he had
[1:28:04] before the world began
[1:28:07] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:28:11] there was something that he was trying
[1:28:15] and was going to achieve
[1:28:18] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:28:24] to let himself be expressed
[1:28:28] because first there wasn't even a Moon
[1:28:32] Star atom molecule or anything he was
[1:28:36] God but he exists but he exactly wasn't
[1:28:42] God at that time because God is an
[1:28:47] object of worship and there was nothing
[1:28:50] to worship Him
[1:28:54] now think of that
[1:28:57] I like that because now
[1:28:59] it gives me a reason why I'm here
[1:29:03] a purpose why I'm here you are not rats
[1:29:08] put in a maze
[1:29:10] to see if you can make it to the other
[1:29:12] side
[1:29:13] that's too much what religion is
[1:29:17] and then you're bound in fear if you
[1:29:20] make the wrong turn
[1:29:22] and then a man will insert himself in
[1:29:25] there as being the one to tell you which
[1:29:28] turns to make
[1:29:30] and you say okay if you say it this way
[1:29:33] or you say it's that way oh I'll just
[1:29:36] follow that
[1:29:39] connect
[1:29:41] with the purpose
[1:29:46] there's two purposes
[1:29:49] who connect with the purpose he says so
[1:29:53] in his great mind he wanted these
[1:29:56] attributes to be expressed
[1:29:59] in him was love
[1:30:01] in him was to be a father in him was to
[1:30:04] be
[1:30:05] son in him was to be savior in him was
[1:30:09] to be healer and all these great
[1:30:12] attributes we see already expressed were
[1:30:17] in God
[1:30:19] so God had a purpose
[1:30:22] right he had a three stage purpose
[1:30:27] so we know that God has a purpose so
[1:30:30] that's the one purpose
[1:30:32] but there there there was another
[1:30:35] purpose
[1:30:37] that was inserted
[1:30:41] and and that purpose is uh
[1:30:46] described in uh
[1:30:50] Isaiah
[1:30:52] the 14th chapter
[1:30:55] and the 12th verse
[1:30:58] so we know that all through the
[1:31:02] scriptures
[1:31:05] there was always twins in every Revival
[1:31:11] they're even in the beginning there was
[1:31:13] light and there was Darkness
[1:31:16] and God separated the light from the
[1:31:19] darkness every place that we go in the
[1:31:21] scriptures we can find that there's
[1:31:25] always been twins there's always been
[1:31:27] two Vines because there's there there's
[1:31:31] what's Cain and Abel there was Jacob and
[1:31:34] Esau there was Jesus Jesus in Judas
[1:31:37] there there's always always
[1:31:41] to uh opposing an opposite voices
[1:31:47] another way I could express it was the
[1:31:50] law of contrast that God had to allow
[1:31:54] one thing to be there to contrast the
[1:31:57] other else everything would be one great
[1:32:00] blur but so there's always been two so
[1:32:03] they're in the Garden of Eden and we
[1:32:05] know even before that
[1:32:07] that that in the beginning when the
[1:32:11] Angels fell
[1:32:13] and they were cast to the earth when
[1:32:16] when that Angel Rose up when Lucifer
[1:32:19] rose up in the beginning he had a
[1:32:22] purpose
[1:32:24] he he wanted a kingdom
[1:32:28] he wanted an Eden and our messenger
[1:32:31] absolutely came and preached to us
[1:32:34] beyond a shadow of a doubt that Satan's
[1:32:37] Eden is here
[1:32:41] there is a God of this evil age
[1:32:45] so we can actually look out if we have
[1:32:50] any ice have at all and see the purpose
[1:32:55] of Lucifer is being fulfilled amen
[1:33:00] he's got something he's trying to
[1:33:02] accomplish and he wants to impose
[1:33:07] his purpose
[1:33:10] upon you
[1:33:13] if I could express it this hey he wants
[1:33:16] to make you a pawn
[1:33:20] on he wants to make you a servant to
[1:33:23] unbelief
[1:33:27] can you imagine become a servant to
[1:33:29] unbelief
[1:33:32] that you are are ruled by fear
[1:33:35] that you're ruled by doubt
[1:33:40] that you're ruled by hope
[1:33:42] instead of Revelation that you're ruled
[1:33:45] by reasoning instead of Revelation
[1:33:50] can you imagine me in that bondage
[1:33:53] because there's an evil spirit that goes
[1:33:56] about like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:33:59] he may devour who wants to capture All
[1:34:02] Mankind and make them slaves to build
[1:34:05] his City to build his Temple to build
[1:34:09] his civilization to build his kingdom
[1:34:11] and all of it's of the devil
[1:34:17] I don't I don't know it would be worse
[1:34:22] to be a
[1:34:24] a willing slave with the knowledge of it
[1:34:28] or to be a slave to it and not know it
[1:34:33] a lot
[1:34:34] how would you like to be worshiping
[1:34:36] Satan
[1:34:38] thinking you're worshiping God
[1:34:42] everything you pour into your life
[1:34:44] everything you do every work that you do
[1:34:48] everything you built for and come at the
[1:34:51] end of the road to find out not one bit
[1:34:54] of it
[1:34:55] was done for the purpose of God Amen
[1:35:01] I don't want to be deceived like that
[1:35:08] we all believed this morning I hope the
[1:35:10] majority of us understand whatever level
[1:35:13] of Revelations God's given you but the
[1:35:17] voice that we've heard in this day
[1:35:20] one of its purposes was to reveal the
[1:35:24] son of perdition
[1:35:25] it was to reveal the deceiver
[1:35:29] and his deception
[1:35:32] and how he works
[1:35:35] and what he does
[1:35:37] that there is a
[1:35:40] a an opposing Force
[1:35:46] an l a
[1:35:49] enemy
[1:35:51] that appears as an angel of Light
[1:35:58] I'll give you a way of Escape
[1:36:02] I'll fix your problem he's so deceiving
[1:36:08] it's frightening
[1:36:13] but we've got something
[1:36:16] that we've got to hold to
[1:36:18] and that's God's word
[1:36:21] so let's just read about just a
[1:36:24] description this morning of this other
[1:36:27] purpose
[1:36:29] how Thou Art fallen from Heaven o
[1:36:33] Lucifer
[1:36:34] Sun of the morning
[1:36:38] Isaiah 14 12.
[1:36:40] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[1:36:43] to the ground which did weakened the
[1:36:48] Nations
[1:36:50] for thou hath said in thine heart
[1:36:54] this is his purpose
[1:36:56] I will Ascend into heaven
[1:37:00] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:37:04] of God
[1:37:05] how many know what the stars of God are
[1:37:09] what are they they were the seven
[1:37:11] Messengers in the palm of the hand in
[1:37:14] other words I'm going to exalt myself
[1:37:17] above every message
[1:37:21] that these Messengers gave
[1:37:26] you don't think Satan is trying to exalt
[1:37:28] himself above this message
[1:37:32] you know what he did he infiltrated this
[1:37:35] message with make-believers
[1:37:38] he infiltrated this message with
[1:37:40] unbelievers they could pack the name
[1:37:43] they could pack the books they could
[1:37:45] preach in the gospel they could do
[1:37:47] everything and then when they fall like
[1:37:50] flies
[1:37:53] all it does is tries to give the message
[1:37:55] a dirty name all it does is confuse
[1:37:59] people all it does is break hearts
[1:38:05] because you wonder if the they never
[1:38:08] filtered the purpose
[1:38:14] I'll tell you
[1:38:16] you're obligated to your family
[1:38:19] and to your soul
[1:38:22] if you're going to sit and listen to my
[1:38:26] human voice you should filter every
[1:38:30] motive and objective in everything you
[1:38:34] ought to put me through the ringer
[1:38:40] find out if it's real right
[1:38:44] not a time for make-believe
[1:38:47] it doesn't do you any good to come to
[1:38:50] church to fulfill your obligation to
[1:38:54] church
[1:38:56] don't save you
[1:39:00] it's the being born again that saves you
[1:39:04] it's having a nature change that saves
[1:39:06] you to have him rise up in you that
[1:39:10] saves you
[1:39:12] listen to what he says
[1:39:14] I will have the stars of God I will sit
[1:39:17] upon the Mount of the congregation
[1:39:22] I'm going to rule over them
[1:39:25] and we think oh that's the Catholic
[1:39:28] Church no it's every harlot
[1:39:31] that's right that came out of her
[1:39:36] 200 000 demon demons
[1:39:40] turn loose on the bride
[1:39:44] oh how many demons do you think you've
[1:39:46] been fighting
[1:39:49] there's two hundred thousand demon
[1:39:51] demons after you this morning who wants
[1:39:54] to drag your soul to hell
[1:39:57] oh Don't Preach about hell that'll empty
[1:40:00] the pews praise God
[1:40:05] you've got to fight your way to hell
[1:40:10] you've got to absolutely reject and go
[1:40:14] over every barrier that God raises up
[1:40:19] to go to hell
[1:40:21] listen here he wants to rule over you
[1:40:24] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:40:28] clouds
[1:40:29] I will be like the most high
[1:40:34] God of this evil age
[1:40:39] Satan's Eden god of the fecal age
[1:40:42] serving God
[1:40:47] is put out of the people's mind
[1:40:50] they no longer wish to retain God in
[1:40:54] their knowledge not not God there is a
[1:40:58] God God is his word
[1:41:02] in the beginning was the word
[1:41:05] you can't have God without having his
[1:41:08] word
[1:41:10] anything you call God that is not word
[1:41:14] is an idol
[1:41:18] it's just an idol
[1:41:20] whether you create your
[1:41:23] whether you create
[1:41:24] his personality you make him what he
[1:41:28] makes them that's why we've got so many
[1:41:30] filters today so many Church buildings
[1:41:33] that you can go into and they will
[1:41:36] filter the word and just give you the
[1:41:39] word that you like
[1:41:45] the osteins what what's the what was the
[1:41:49] reason for his success and why he has so
[1:41:53] many people that come to him and his
[1:41:56] answer was well we don't talk about hell
[1:42:02] um
[1:42:03] we need a good Hellfire Brimstone
[1:42:06] message
[1:42:11] you know that's that's how he gets them
[1:42:14] all in
[1:42:16] because this is the Bible
[1:42:20] we believe everything that's in it
[1:42:24] but you don't have to take off your
[1:42:26] earrings and your makeup and your paint
[1:42:28] and you can still wear your shorts and
[1:42:30] you can still make faith we believe
[1:42:32] everything that's in it every promise in
[1:42:35] this is mine and God loves me
[1:42:40] yeah he does
[1:42:43] you know
[1:42:44] but they don't like the part that loves
[1:42:47] corrective
[1:42:49] and people just gobble it up
[1:42:51] put all their trust in them
[1:42:56] that's not where I want to go
[1:42:58] that we're talking about this liar here
[1:43:01] because
[1:43:03] the most high now he says yet
[1:43:06] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[1:43:10] to the sides of the pit
[1:43:13] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[1:43:17] upon me and consider thee saying is this
[1:43:21] the man that made the Earth to tremble
[1:43:25] and in shape kingdoms
[1:43:28] you don't
[1:43:30] that scripture is for us today
[1:43:35] the Son of Perdition has been revealed
[1:43:38] so we can narrowly look upon him and say
[1:43:42] this is the guy
[1:43:46] that's destroying kingdoms and shaking
[1:43:50] people
[1:43:54] the only thing that's ever going to do
[1:43:56] that's when you put the flashlight of
[1:43:58] God's word on them praise God there was
[1:44:01] a man here that could turn on the light
[1:44:04] that's right
[1:44:06] he said
[1:44:08] he said that made the world's
[1:44:11] as a wilderness
[1:44:13] and destroyed the cities thereof that
[1:44:17] open not the house of his prisoners
[1:44:21] and the kings of the nation even all of
[1:44:24] them light in glory every one of them in
[1:44:29] his own house
[1:44:31] is this a guy
[1:44:34] do you realize right today he's
[1:44:36] destroying cities
[1:44:39] whole cities
[1:44:41] in our country look at Chicago Illinois
[1:44:45] full of demons
[1:44:48] full of crime
[1:44:50] full of everything used to be one of the
[1:44:53] most beautiful places along the great
[1:44:55] Shoreline and now it's gone to the
[1:44:58] corruption
[1:45:00] of uh I don't know what they call it
[1:45:03] they call it woke thinking but they're
[1:45:05] they're wrong it's luciferism
[1:45:11] you take San Francisco yeah
[1:45:14] it used to be called The Gem of the
[1:45:16] Pacific
[1:45:19] a beautiful place
[1:45:22] I've been there
[1:45:24] and now it's it's full of of people on
[1:45:29] the streets and and drugs and and
[1:45:33] everything businesses are fleeing from
[1:45:35] it by the thousands shutting down their
[1:45:39] stores they don't know what to do
[1:45:41] there's only one thing to do and that's
[1:45:45] repent amen
[1:45:50] they don't see what it is
[1:45:54] he's destroying this nation
[1:45:59] you don't think about a purpose he's got
[1:46:02] a purpose
[1:46:04] and I'll tell you those of you who got
[1:46:06] your children it can in public school
[1:46:09] I'm not against anything but you keep
[1:46:12] your eyes on everything they send home
[1:46:15] you go sit in in a classroom
[1:46:19] you let that school know you're there
[1:46:22] and you're listening oh yes don't turn
[1:46:26] them over into their hands
[1:46:31] they actually have men
[1:46:34] come into schools
[1:46:37] dressed as women
[1:46:40] and put on a show
[1:46:43] and all the kids in their innocence it's
[1:46:46] funny huh
[1:46:50] the seed of acceptance
[1:46:56] the seed of acceptance is being sowed
[1:47:01] if you don't filter that seed of
[1:47:04] acceptance out of your life
[1:47:08] he will give you by reasoning a reason
[1:47:11] to do everything that you do
[1:47:15] as contrary to the word of God as it is
[1:47:19] it will appear as light
[1:47:24] he's got a purpose
[1:47:27] his purpose is to be worshiped
[1:47:30] what was the one thing that Satan
[1:47:33] couldn't do
[1:47:35] create
[1:47:38] he couldn't create
[1:47:40] God had that power
[1:47:43] and God expressed that power I hope you
[1:47:47] get this
[1:47:48] he expressed that power by making them
[1:47:52] male and female
[1:47:59] right but he did he said I'll make them
[1:48:00] male and female he made the plants they
[1:48:03] have their own pollination and that they
[1:48:06] they have a separation
[1:48:09] he made all the animals they have a
[1:48:11] separation he had a way of bringing
[1:48:14] forth life
[1:48:16] and he made them male and female
[1:48:19] made he them
[1:48:22] and now Lucifer
[1:48:25] with his purpose of sitting upon the
[1:48:28] throne
[1:48:31] and being exalted of God he has now fed
[1:48:35] the world
[1:48:38] this whole idea of inclusion
[1:48:42] God is not an includer
[1:48:45] God is a separator
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:51] and if you want to call it racist I am
[1:48:54] the most spiritual racist
[1:48:58] there is
[1:49:04] sin in life don't mix
[1:49:13] no don't get all so fancied up with the
[1:49:15] color of your skin because God don't
[1:49:17] care
[1:49:18] he's not a respecter of persons
[1:49:22] he looks what's on the inside
[1:49:27] and if he chose to express you in brown
[1:49:30] praise God if he chose to express you in
[1:49:33] yellow praise God in red praise God in
[1:49:37] Black praise God and why praise God
[1:49:40] the family
[1:49:42] amen but God's a racist
[1:49:49] he is
[1:49:51] and just for all you people on YouTube
[1:49:53] who's going to X me out
[1:49:58] we have all the colors here this morning
[1:50:02] and they're all amen and God's a racist
[1:50:08] you don't think he's a racist
[1:50:11] what did he do with Abraham
[1:50:13] he created a race
[1:50:17] and then he created another race of the
[1:50:20] royal Seed of Abraham
[1:50:22] God's always had a people
[1:50:25] get over it
[1:50:31] there's one that's coming
[1:50:33] Beck has got a purpose of being God I'll
[1:50:37] make a male and female I'll let the
[1:50:39] people in My Kingdom decide what they
[1:50:42] want to be
[1:50:44] if they want to change that's fine
[1:50:49] but I'm trying to get you to understand
[1:50:51] are you aware
[1:50:54] yeah
[1:50:55] of what's happening right
[1:50:58] because there's a purpose
[1:51:02] there's a purpose for all this
[1:51:05] it's the second purpose
[1:51:07] that purpose is Satan to exalt himself
[1:51:10] and sit on the months of congregation
[1:51:13] and raise into the most high that he
[1:51:16] could be worshiped
[1:51:18] and have an Eden
[1:51:21] and sit in it is the God of this Eden
[1:51:24] what did he use in the beginning he used
[1:51:27] Eve what is he using in this day the
[1:51:30] beauty of woman
[1:51:32] oh
[1:51:34] I hope you can see it
[1:51:36] our messenger laid it out over and over
[1:51:39] and over again
[1:51:42] but we're not we want to re-emphasize
[1:51:44] this morning just for a few moments if I
[1:51:47] could say this the real purpose
[1:51:50] there's two purposes one's a false
[1:51:53] purpose and one's a real purpose
[1:51:57] let's talk about our purpose
[1:52:01] this morning
[1:52:02] right so God had a three-fold
[1:52:06] purpose you understand that right so in
[1:52:09] other words God in his mind in the
[1:52:13] beginning had a purpose and that that
[1:52:17] was what that he had so God had a
[1:52:21] purpose or a reason for everything to
[1:52:24] exist
[1:52:25] he had a reason why something is done he
[1:52:29] had a reason why he created now we just
[1:52:32] listened to brother Brenham tell that he
[1:52:34] in him he had attributes
[1:52:38] and he wanted to express himself he
[1:52:41] wasn't even God
[1:52:43] there was nobody to worship Him
[1:52:46] so he wanted to have Fellowship God
[1:52:49] wanted to have Fellowship he had a
[1:52:51] purpose and so if we would look at
[1:52:54] paragraph 140.
[1:52:56] in the midst Christ The Mystery of God
[1:52:58] revealed known as God has had a
[1:53:03] three-pole purpose
[1:53:05] in this great mystery Secret
[1:53:09] God in his great mystery secret that he
[1:53:14] had before the world began
[1:53:17] he has got a three-fold purpose in it
[1:53:24] now
[1:53:25] is there anything in you that's
[1:53:27] interested in what
[1:53:29] the reason for all this is
[1:53:34] that's what man the all psychologists
[1:53:37] find out that men are there for three
[1:53:40] reasons who am I
[1:53:43] why am I here and where are I going
[1:53:49] psychiatrists couches are filled today
[1:53:52] because they don't know where they're
[1:53:55] going
[1:53:56] and the anxiety of not knowing their
[1:54:00] future
[1:54:01] causes them so much trouble that they've
[1:54:04] got to take Xanax and Valium and and
[1:54:09] drugs and alcohol and everything
[1:54:14] they don't know who they are
[1:54:18] can you imagine sitting down in front of
[1:54:21] a guy and saying who am I and they don't
[1:54:24] even know who they are
[1:54:29] wouldn't it be wonderful if you could
[1:54:31] sit through down to a psychiatrist and
[1:54:33] he'd be honest with you and he'd say you
[1:54:36] know I'm a child of the devil
[1:54:39] and your lost as can be
[1:54:43] and my job is to take you to hell
[1:54:46] and get you to worship Satan
[1:54:50] would you come flying off the couch
[1:54:54] well if you're not turning off the TV
[1:54:56] you wouldn't come flying off the couch
[1:55:00] if you aren't turning off the radio and
[1:55:02] all that junk you wouldn't become flying
[1:55:04] off the couch
[1:55:06] because remember the scripture says with
[1:55:10] their mouths they do worship me
[1:55:13] but their hearts are far from me
[1:55:17] this is such an age of deception
[1:55:22] where the mouth can say anything
[1:55:25] but it's only the elect
[1:55:27] that have iceap
[1:55:31] so he got a three-fold purpose
[1:55:34] before the world began he's got a
[1:55:37] threefold purpose in it now we want to
[1:55:41] go upon that this morning what is that
[1:55:44] threefold purpose now I believe to help
[1:55:48] with the help of God who is present
[1:55:52] and he'll show it to us
[1:55:55] now if he had this threefold purpose we
[1:55:59] want to find out what this three-fold
[1:56:04] purpose
[1:56:06] we want to find out what it is
[1:56:10] first the first thing was that God
[1:56:13] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[1:56:19] first purpose of God he wanted to reveal
[1:56:22] himself amen
[1:56:24] now let's be smart this morning
[1:56:26] God creates Adam and Eve
[1:56:29] right
[1:56:30] they walk in the cool of the evening
[1:56:32] with them
[1:56:34] and they love him
[1:56:36] and they're talking together it's
[1:56:38] beautiful he can plant this move it here
[1:56:41] and he's got and they see God in all his
[1:56:44] glory and everything
[1:56:46] but they don't know him
[1:56:49] they only know part of him
[1:56:54] they know he's a father
[1:56:56] they know he's a Creator but there was
[1:56:58] no way that Adam could ever know that
[1:57:01] God was a savior
[1:57:03] that he was a deliverer
[1:57:07] and there was no way that Adam and Eve's
[1:57:10] offspring
[1:57:12] would ever know God any other way
[1:57:15] if they came the way that God had
[1:57:18] planned for Adam and Eve
[1:57:22] you understand that that's not too deep
[1:57:24] I hope
[1:57:26] so God looks at Adam and Eve
[1:57:29] he looks at all their offspring
[1:57:34] everybody he had in his mind
[1:57:37] and he says I tell you what I'm going to
[1:57:39] do I'm going to take all these people
[1:57:41] and I'm going to put their name on the
[1:57:45] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:57:48] nothing can put it on nothing can take
[1:57:52] it off
[1:57:55] I'm going to secure them
[1:57:59] in order for me to carry out
[1:58:03] my purpose
[1:58:05] of revealing myself amen
[1:58:08] so what's he do he says okay Philip
[1:58:13] way back he saw you before you ever got
[1:58:16] here before you or ever was a star in
[1:58:18] anything he put your name on the Lamb's
[1:58:21] Book of Life
[1:58:23] now
[1:58:24] he says
[1:58:26] fine
[1:58:27] he takes Adam out of Eve because Adam
[1:58:31] couldn't be deceived
[1:58:34] and he allows man to fall so here you're
[1:58:38] going through time you're walking with
[1:58:41] God you're in the thoughts of God but
[1:58:43] God allows this little dip in time
[1:58:46] brother Graham calls the little hickey a
[1:58:48] little niche where you drop out of that
[1:58:51] dimension
[1:58:53] into this Dimension and you take on a
[1:58:57] body of sin
[1:59:01] now God has always had your Eternal Body
[1:59:05] in his mind amen
[1:59:09] and praise God it's not this
[1:59:17] so you drop down
[1:59:20] now you're here
[1:59:23] through the deception of Saint Lucifer
[1:59:25] putting forth his program and his
[1:59:28] purpose of what he's doing in deceiving
[1:59:30] Eve we end up here
[1:59:34] now here we are
[1:59:37] but what why did God allow that
[1:59:41] not to put you on trial
[1:59:45] because if you have eternal life you
[1:59:48] always had it
[1:59:50] where was your eternal life it was in
[1:59:53] the thinking of God before the
[1:59:56] foundation of the world it wasn't in
[1:59:58] your works
[1:59:59] [Applause]
[2:00:02] because your filthiness is ranked
[2:00:07] and that's right when Jesus come he said
[2:00:09] all the father hath given me will come
[2:00:12] my sheep know my voice nothing will
[2:00:14] pluck them out of the palm of my hand
[2:00:17] when the disciples came back from the
[2:00:19] great works he said don't Rejoice
[2:00:21] because you Satan's were fallen and
[2:00:24] demons were cast out but Rejoice because
[2:00:27] your name was written in the Book of
[2:00:29] Life
[2:00:33] so we drop down here
[2:00:36] and we were lost
[2:00:39] now he can reveal himself
[2:00:42] make himself known his attribute known
[2:00:44] as Savior then we get sick that kid can
[2:00:48] make us attributes known as what healer
[2:00:52] we get in trouble now he can come show
[2:00:55] us he's a deliverer we get destitute and
[2:00:58] he can be Jehovah Jireh he can be a
[2:01:01] provider
[2:01:05] we're surrounded with the attributes of
[2:01:08] God Amen
[2:01:11] and we don't touch him
[2:01:13] we don't use them
[2:01:17] Satan has got us out of Fellowship
[2:01:20] but if we can get back and fellowship we
[2:01:23] find out he's all we need
[2:01:27] God sends his Spirit to bring you into
[2:01:30] fellowship and to re bring you into
[2:01:33] remembrance that he's everything that
[2:01:37] you have need of he's all I need
[2:01:41] so he he wanted to do that was his first
[2:01:43] purpose was to make himself known
[2:01:48] that's all you want to do is display all
[2:01:51] his attributes
[2:01:52] to let you know who he really is so we
[2:01:55] can look and see the invisible things of
[2:01:57] God are clearly seen in the creation
[2:02:00] around us we can see the beauty of
[2:02:02] nature we can see the great creative
[2:02:04] power we can see all the things that
[2:02:07] God's done it's beautiful now we got
[2:02:09] this perverter out here that's got a
[2:02:12] completely different purpose
[2:02:15] and he's trying to sell that to you
[2:02:17] every day
[2:02:18] filter
[2:02:24] it all
[2:02:30] so he had and now he's revealing all
[2:02:33] this other side of him
[2:02:38] all the parts we would have never known
[2:02:41] if he didn't allow us to come here
[2:02:47] but while we were yet sinners he died
[2:02:50] for us
[2:02:53] the minute he fell he said I'll put
[2:02:55] enmity between thy seed and the serpent
[2:02:58] seed yes
[2:03:00] oh I love it
[2:03:01] I love that he loves me
[2:03:04] despite all that I am
[2:03:07] it never was what I did
[2:03:09] if you can do one thing for your
[2:03:12] salvation Jesus Christ died in vain
[2:03:16] stay with me would you just a moment
[2:03:20] secondly this is paragraph 44.
[2:03:23] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[2:03:27] body of believers
[2:03:30] that is his bride that he might live
[2:03:35] in
[2:03:36] people
[2:03:40] that's the second purpose
[2:03:44] not only did he
[2:03:47] want to reveal himself
[2:03:51] but he wants to have the preeminence
[2:03:54] he wants to live in you
[2:03:59] right the second purpose
[2:04:03] wants you to acknowledge Him
[2:04:06] ma'am
[2:04:09] and do religious offerings
[2:04:13] to him
[2:04:16] he wants you to to to
[2:04:20] light a candle or or sing A Hymn or
[2:04:25] fulfill out a ritual of going to church
[2:04:28] in fact he'll even provide for you all
[2:04:32] kinds of different flavors
[2:04:37] you can be a presbyterian and worship
[2:04:39] God you can be a assemblies and worship
[2:04:43] God you can be all these things out here
[2:04:46] and worship God but
[2:04:48] that's not God's purpose
[2:04:52] God's purpose is he wants to live in you
[2:04:57] that's the second full purpose of God
[2:05:02] oh what love
[2:05:07] he didn't just put you down here like
[2:05:10] you're in a maze
[2:05:13] he wants to have preeminence
[2:05:16] he wants to live in you
[2:05:19] he wants you to know this that if the
[2:05:23] same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ
[2:05:25] dwelleth in me it'll also Quicken my
[2:05:30] mortal body
[2:05:32] what is the indwelling spirit of Jesus
[2:05:36] Christ it's the earnest
[2:05:38] of your Redemption
[2:05:42] it's the title deed to the abstract that
[2:05:46] you have a body
[2:05:49] waiting for you
[2:05:51] and that you have a place in another
[2:05:54] kingdom
[2:05:56] how do how do I know that because the
[2:05:59] the I've been made join heirs
[2:06:04] I've got the I've got the title deed
[2:06:07] I've got the word of God I've got his
[2:06:10] presence in me
[2:06:17] he's dwelling in me
[2:06:21] church if you don't know he's dwelling
[2:06:23] in you please find a closet somewhere
[2:06:26] and pray through
[2:06:28] till you know that he walks with you and
[2:06:33] he talks with you
[2:06:35] that you've applied the token
[2:06:42] don't let your flesh tell you it can't
[2:06:44] be done right
[2:06:46] if your heart doesn't condemn you he is
[2:06:49] greater than your heart he's greater
[2:06:51] than your flesh
[2:06:55] his flight your flesh will war against
[2:06:57] you all the days
[2:06:59] you know why because your flesh knows
[2:07:02] it's not going oh
[2:07:10] I ain't taking this bag of bones with me
[2:07:13] Jerome
[2:07:15] it gets stiffer every morning
[2:07:20] and starting to wobble and Shuffle
[2:07:24] it's starting to fade away
[2:07:27] but I pray to God there's something on
[2:07:29] the inside that beats stronger and a
[2:07:32] harder and more for him oh God I want to
[2:07:36] serve you oh God I want to be like you
[2:07:38] oh God I want to invite you into every
[2:07:41] corner of my life I want to be a little
[2:07:44] Messiah
[2:07:54] paragraph 155 second to have preeminence
[2:07:59] by this in his church which is his body
[2:08:04] the bride
[2:08:06] till he could have the preeminence to
[2:08:09] express himself through them
[2:08:17] he
[2:08:19] I can't even believe it
[2:08:23] God wants to excuse this
[2:08:28] chunk of clay
[2:08:32] this person that had all this darkness
[2:08:36] and in them and his love is so great
[2:08:42] that he's willing to come in and wash
[2:08:45] all of that away
[2:08:47] throw it in the sea of God's
[2:08:49] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[2:08:54] to wash me and cleanse me with the
[2:08:56] washing of the water of his word and
[2:08:59] then use this redeemed body to live in
[2:09:03] and express himself through
[2:09:08] every single one of you
[2:09:11] in every Walk of Life every condition
[2:09:14] every situation
[2:09:16] I'm pretty sure he's got almost every
[2:09:19] situation of Life covered in this one
[2:09:22] room
[2:09:24] and he wants to express himself through
[2:09:27] you thank you Lord that's his purpose
[2:09:32] that's what he wants to do he wants to
[2:09:35] express himself and now his third
[2:09:39] purpose
[2:09:40] and thirdly to restore the kingdom to
[2:09:44] its right
[2:09:46] ly position
[2:09:48] that fell from sin by the first Adam
[2:09:52] back to where he walked in the cool of
[2:09:56] the evening with his people talking with
[2:10:00] them fellowshipping with them
[2:10:05] now sin and death had separated them
[2:10:08] from his presence and his entire
[2:10:12] and his entire expression
[2:10:17] do you read it before the foundations of
[2:10:21] the world to express all of his
[2:10:24] attributes that he was
[2:10:28] he wall
[2:10:30] the church let's don't miss the rapture
[2:10:36] let's don't miss it
[2:10:39] don't sell out oh yes
[2:10:44] now let's just close
[2:10:47] this morning
[2:10:51] and talk about us
[2:10:55] we've been talking about
[2:10:58] thinking
[2:11:00] right so we're trying to once again this
[2:11:04] morning to reach out
[2:11:06] to end to to stimulate
[2:11:11] our thinking
[2:11:13] to get us to think
[2:11:15] the right way
[2:11:18] so this is my lesson this morning this
[2:11:21] last few minutes
[2:11:24] I want you to understand there's two
[2:11:25] purposes going on
[2:11:28] one is Satan trying to rule over you
[2:11:31] build an Eden
[2:11:33] be a god
[2:11:35] and have you be his slaves
[2:11:38] remember the what one of the
[2:11:40] descriptions
[2:11:41] of Lucifer he wouldn't open his prisons
[2:11:49] he won't let you go
[2:11:52] and you cannot unlock the cell
[2:11:58] you were doomed to start with
[2:12:03] but one came
[2:12:06] and he'll open the door
[2:12:13] don't be like that Crow
[2:12:16] that was tied to that string and he had
[2:12:20] set up a lifestyle
[2:12:22] and a thinking and he could only would
[2:12:25] go so far
[2:12:30] and then when the string was cut
[2:12:33] he was free but he wouldn't fly
[2:12:40] I feel we got too many that are free but
[2:12:42] won't fly they won't fly in the
[2:12:45] heavenlies they won't fly to get Vision
[2:12:47] they won't fly to get revelation
[2:12:52] they won't go to where no man has ever
[2:12:55] gone before
[2:12:59] some of you might have caught that
[2:13:04] but don't you think all that stuff's out
[2:13:06] there for a reason
[2:13:08] the world screams the gospel to us
[2:13:13] and what is lady osia give me I Sav that
[2:13:17] I might see
[2:13:19] give me clothes that I might be clothed
[2:13:23] because he that hath a what ear let him
[2:13:27] hear
[2:13:28] no we're talking about our thinking this
[2:13:30] morning
[2:13:31] and in closing with this
[2:13:35] remember Esau
[2:13:37] right he says they're like Esau
[2:13:47] he said they're like he saw outwardly
[2:13:49] okay
[2:13:51] eat Esau was religious on the outside
[2:13:55] and when it come to religion it seemed
[2:13:58] to be more religious than Jacob was
[2:14:02] he seemed to be a better man
[2:14:04] than Jacob was
[2:14:06] but on the inside of him what he was
[2:14:12] he was elderly religious
[2:14:15] but his thinking was not filtered
[2:14:23] let me say it again
[2:14:26] don't let your thinking go unfiltered
[2:14:33] amen don't let thoughts run through your
[2:14:37] mind
[2:14:38] don't draw conclusions
[2:14:42] don't draw perceptions
[2:14:45] don't look at things and think it's the
[2:14:48] way that it is it's only the way that
[2:14:52] God's word says it is I don't care if
[2:14:55] Satan appears as an angel of Light
[2:14:59] when Satan appeared to Martin he
[2:15:02] appeared as an angel and he said Martin
[2:15:05] I'm your lord Fall Down and Worship me
[2:15:08] act in the presence was there and the
[2:15:11] light was shining in the room and it was
[2:15:13] glorious and Martin began to filter it
[2:15:17] right
[2:15:18] could this be him is this the hour is
[2:15:22] this the day is this the time and he
[2:15:24] filtered and filtered and filtered until
[2:15:26] he saw one thing he had a crown on
[2:15:35] and he knew that Lucifer wanted to sit
[2:15:38] on the fence of the congregation he
[2:15:40] wanted to exalt himself as king of kings
[2:15:42] and he said wait a minute that crown
[2:15:46] doesn't filter
[2:15:52] and he said get behind me
[2:15:54] Satan because the bride shall crown
[2:16:01] got a filter
[2:16:03] now listen to Esau
[2:16:07] our knee is religious but his thinking
[2:16:09] was not filtered he didn't think right
[2:16:13] of the birthright
[2:16:15] he didn't think that God that the
[2:16:18] birthright meant as much as God said it
[2:16:22] did
[2:16:24] there he was
[2:16:26] said I'm hungry
[2:16:28] what difference does it make about the
[2:16:31] old Birthright you can have it if you
[2:16:34] want it oh my
[2:16:38] God if I was to ask you this morning I
[2:16:41] hope I don't seem angry or anything but
[2:16:44] my soul is screaming inside of me
[2:16:48] not because of you because of me because
[2:16:51] I see how short I am
[2:16:54] and I see what's at stake
[2:16:57] how many of you know what your
[2:16:59] Birthright is
[2:17:03] that you could describe to me and say
[2:17:06] this is my Birthright
[2:17:09] so many people go back to Pentecost and
[2:17:12] think his powers and gifts
[2:17:15] your Birthright is your election
[2:17:26] that's what your right Birthright was
[2:17:29] you were born for the purpose you were
[2:17:34] elected and purposed to be here
[2:17:41] to be the elected lady
[2:17:48] that's why you're chosen
[2:17:50] that's your Birthright
[2:17:54] but like Esau
[2:17:58] like Cain
[2:18:01] like Judas
[2:18:04] they didn't think right to the
[2:18:06] birthright
[2:18:09] they didn't ever comprehend
[2:18:12] what it meant to be elected and chosen
[2:18:17] of God
[2:18:22] that's the birthright
[2:18:24] and when the thinking is wrong towards
[2:18:28] the birthright
[2:18:30] then you throw that Birthright away
[2:18:34] for every little thing that comes up
[2:18:42] you compromise on the word of God
[2:18:49] but this Eve
[2:18:52] if we would just read with me
[2:18:57] in paragraph
[2:18:59] 163.
[2:19:05] now what is his purpose now
[2:19:10] today
[2:19:12] to express himself as a son see and now
[2:19:18] that in him might dwell the fullness of
[2:19:22] the godhead bodily
[2:19:24] I'm
[2:19:26] I've got Colossians lying here right
[2:19:29] here before me see
[2:19:30] that all through the scripture that's
[2:19:33] what God's purpose was
[2:19:36] then all through this life of his son
[2:19:39] his cross the blood is saying here of
[2:19:43] his cross that he might reconcile
[2:19:46] himself a body a bride
[2:19:50] which is Eve
[2:19:54] the second
[2:19:56] Eve
[2:19:59] and God give it in type
[2:20:02] like he did Moses and all of them the
[2:20:07] same thing that he did in Adam and Eve
[2:20:09] giving a type that that they were Christ
[2:20:14] and the bride and his second Adam the
[2:20:18] church is the second
[2:20:22] Eve
[2:20:25] oh
[2:20:29] now we begin to we begin to
[2:20:33] to
[2:20:34] understand something
[2:20:37] we're the second Eve
[2:20:42] here we are
[2:20:45] the second Eve
[2:20:47] that's our purpose
[2:20:49] the first Eve what
[2:20:52] she compromised on the word of God
[2:20:56] but what's the second Eve going to do
[2:21:00] she's not
[2:21:02] right no don't pit yourself deceived
[2:21:06] by thinking if you believe that William
[2:21:08] branham's a prophet of God
[2:21:11] and that he's the messenger for this age
[2:21:14] that
[2:21:16] automatically means that you haven't
[2:21:19] compromised
[2:21:23] I've been places and had people sit down
[2:21:27] and overhear their conversations about
[2:21:29] William Branham
[2:21:34] comparing themselves to them
[2:21:37] oh one guy's going on old brother
[2:21:39] Brenham had a resident gift
[2:21:41] in other words our gifts just come and
[2:21:44] go but brother branham's gift stays with
[2:21:47] them all the time
[2:21:48] do you think that might be because he
[2:21:50] was born to prophet
[2:21:52] and he was the messenger to the age
[2:21:58] and you've been elected to hear it thank
[2:22:01] God
[2:22:03] they write books about them
[2:22:06] they use them all the time they quote
[2:22:09] from his messages
[2:22:16] but this election
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:22] our Birthright
[2:22:25] this eve will not compromise let's read
[2:22:30] paragraph 174.
[2:22:33] predestinated
[2:22:43] let's go back to 163 just for a second
[2:22:49] a bride he said this church is the
[2:22:52] second Eve
[2:22:54] and as long as the second Eve
[2:22:57] compromises against the word
[2:23:00] she's doing the same thing the first Eve
[2:23:04] did
[2:23:08] trying to say well it was for some other
[2:23:11] age well we'll get to that in a few
[2:23:15] minutes whether he said that it was for
[2:23:17] another age
[2:23:19] how can it be for another age when he's
[2:23:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:23:26] but God has a purpose
[2:23:28] and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent
[2:23:31] and wise and revealed it to the
[2:23:34] predestinated babes who were
[2:23:37] predestinated to receive it
[2:23:43] now she's not going to compromise
[2:23:45] because this Eve is put to the same test
[2:23:48] now if we think right about the
[2:23:52] birthright
[2:23:55] and we understand why we're here
[2:23:58] we're here not to compromise on the word
[2:24:01] of God
[2:24:04] not to make any reasons not to not to
[2:24:08] filter the word of God out but to filter
[2:24:10] everything through the word of God so if
[2:24:13] we find ourselves here we find out that
[2:24:15] there's all kinds of things we
[2:24:18] compromise on
[2:24:23] what happens if I threw out work on
[2:24:25] Sunday
[2:24:31] that almost chokes half the everybody to
[2:24:33] death
[2:24:35] and I know I'm not the one that said it
[2:24:39] I'm usually the one that sits down and
[2:24:41] says well if you've got this problem and
[2:24:43] you got that problem I understand and
[2:24:44] you got an ox in the ditch you know what
[2:24:47] I mean and and because I'm a pastor and
[2:24:50] I love you and I try to make it as easy
[2:24:52] as you can
[2:24:56] but it's not my call
[2:24:59] it's your call
[2:25:03] and you're the one that's got to stand
[2:25:05] up and say wait a minute
[2:25:06] this is what the word says
[2:25:09] I don't care what the world says about
[2:25:12] it
[2:25:15] I don't care what the outcome is
[2:25:18] I'm like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[2:25:21] oh King live forever
[2:25:26] but I am not going to bow to that Idol
[2:25:30] I wish you no ill
[2:25:33] I I wish you no harm
[2:25:37] but as for me and my house we're going
[2:25:39] to serve God
[2:25:42] they wouldn't eat the king's bread they
[2:25:45] would need unkoshered food they wouldn't
[2:25:47] fall down to nothing they were
[2:25:50] determined
[2:25:51] to be princes of God's word
[2:25:56] he said fire it up boys
[2:25:59] seven times
[2:26:02] hotter
[2:26:05] I don't know how they get it seven times
[2:26:07] hotter the only thing I could do is
[2:26:09] they've started those bills going you
[2:26:12] know what I mean
[2:26:13] that flame is so red hot the guards went
[2:26:16] up there and opened the door and
[2:26:17] perished
[2:26:22] but they were without compromise
[2:26:26] why
[2:26:32] they weren't going to defile Israel
[2:26:34] they weren't going to defile their
[2:26:36] Birthright they weren't going to file
[2:26:38] who they were and where they come from
[2:26:40] that they were the Royal Seed of Abraham
[2:26:43] that they served the one in living god
[2:26:45] Jehovah
[2:26:48] and they walked into that fire
[2:26:51] and who was in the fire to meet him
[2:26:58] but you know nowadays
[2:27:01] before we go into the fire
[2:27:06] everything in the world's there
[2:27:11] God says be it your post to duty
[2:27:17] every reason
[2:27:20] I've watched it over and over and over
[2:27:22] again
[2:27:23] people move to where there's no church
[2:27:25] and they perish
[2:27:29] their intentions are good
[2:27:32] they got all kinds of reasons they got
[2:27:35] all kinds of this they got all kinds of
[2:27:37] stuff
[2:27:42] I had a person tell me one time he says
[2:27:45] well I told them I would I said it's
[2:27:47] contrary to the word of God don't do it
[2:27:50] well I told them I would
[2:27:53] you gotta be kidding me
[2:27:56] go tell them you lied
[2:27:59] that you're a liar you were born in sin
[2:28:03] shaped iniquity and you came into the
[2:28:04] world speaking lies I'm sorry I lied to
[2:28:07] you
[2:28:10] I told you I'd do something I can't do
[2:28:13] is contrary to the word of God all in
[2:28:15] all we wrinkle it around
[2:28:19] because our Birthright doesn't mean
[2:28:21] anything to it we don't know why we're
[2:28:24] here
[2:28:24] we're here not to compromise on the word
[2:28:29] this second Eve is not going to
[2:28:33] compromise we've all we're all here for
[2:28:36] one purpose it's to tell the other
[2:28:39] purpose I'm not part of you
[2:28:45] I've got a purpose that I'm here for and
[2:28:49] that's for Christ to live through me
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:55] go ahead and make your own testimony
[2:29:01] he don't change
[2:29:07] and that's what's wrong with the
[2:29:09] ministry
[2:29:11] they pass out filters
[2:29:14] so everybody can filter what they want
[2:29:16] to taste
[2:29:18] Church
[2:29:19] there's one filter for this day
[2:29:22] and it's the message
[2:29:25] that God sent
[2:29:28] through his messenger
[2:29:31] it was given to us
[2:29:35] to expose every other purpose than the
[2:29:40] purpose of the birthright
[2:29:46] we we read
[2:29:48] in thinking men's filter what the
[2:29:51] evidence of the Holy Spirit was
[2:29:54] the evidence of the Holy Spirit was
[2:29:57] drawing every thought
[2:29:59] through God's word filter
[2:30:03] that's the evidence that you've got the
[2:30:05] spirit of God and I I'm warning you I'm
[2:30:09] beseeching you I'm calling out to you
[2:30:12] with all my heart Church
[2:30:15] get a hold and have the right thinking
[2:30:18] to your election and Birthright
[2:30:22] ma'am
[2:30:24] some of you were born into it and had
[2:30:26] wonderful parents praise God
[2:30:28] others didn't
[2:30:33] but what determines that great election
[2:30:36] is that he put that seed in you
[2:30:41] that becomes aware by the spirit of God
[2:30:44] that hey I'm here for a purpose
[2:30:48] I'm part of his purpose for him to live
[2:30:51] in me
[2:30:55] and that's what he said if ye abide in
[2:30:58] me and my word abide in you then ask
[2:31:01] what you will because you are the word
[2:31:04] are the same
[2:31:06] he has the preeminence he's got the
[2:31:10] rulership you're a prisoner to him the
[2:31:14] world is dead you have nothing more you
[2:31:18] see the rest of the people living the
[2:31:20] way they do but yet you do not do it
[2:31:24] you're a prisoner you're yoked with him
[2:31:27] my yoke is easy
[2:31:31] he said your yoke with Christ with the
[2:31:33] word I do only
[2:31:36] which
[2:31:37] pleases the father and if you can't
[2:31:41] believe that I'm he then believe the
[2:31:44] word so perfectly noticed he said
[2:31:47] believe the works in closing this
[2:31:49] morning
[2:31:51] paragraph 63 what is his purpose now
[2:31:55] to express himself as a son see
[2:31:58] and now that in him might dwell the
[2:32:02] fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:32:05] and I've got Colossians laying right
[2:32:08] here before me that's I've I read that
[2:32:11] that's not what I wanted to read I want
[2:32:13] to go over to paragraph 184 I'm sorry
[2:32:16] 184 that's close and reading this
[2:32:19] predestinated
[2:32:21] there's the mystery
[2:32:29] listen now this morning
[2:32:31] predestinated there's the mystery he
[2:32:34] before Christ or anything else ever was
[2:32:39] on the Earth
[2:32:41] you see his great mystery that he chose
[2:32:45] the
[2:32:47] bride amen
[2:32:50] knowing Eve would fall
[2:32:53] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[2:32:57] she would fall but he would choose a
[2:33:01] bride that would not fall
[2:33:05] that would hold to that word regardless
[2:33:09] of what the rest of the world said about
[2:33:13] it
[2:33:17] there they would hold to that word
[2:33:20] they are predestinated to stand there
[2:33:27] the adoption of children by Christ
[2:33:31] predestinated the church to that great
[2:33:35] glorious stand
[2:33:40] what is she here for every job offer for
[2:33:44] everything that would take you away
[2:33:46] every project no matter what it is wait
[2:33:49] a minute
[2:33:52] he's first amen that's right I don't
[2:33:56] care you put God first he'll take care
[2:33:58] of everything out put God first
[2:34:02] that Widow put God first
[2:34:08] it came time during that offering she
[2:34:11] took those little might she had and she
[2:34:13] threw it in there and oh Lord the Lord
[2:34:16] said that's it
[2:34:17] see her
[2:34:18] great is her reward wherever the gospel
[2:34:22] is preached her name will be will will
[2:34:26] be mentioned
[2:34:29] you know what that gave her it gave her
[2:34:31] a place in what
[2:34:33] eternity
[2:34:36] the Widow
[2:34:39] who was able to take the last oil
[2:34:41] and the last bread
[2:34:44] and pivot to the man of God
[2:34:50] oh you don't think that was a man mind
[2:34:53] battle
[2:34:54] but he said thus saith the Lord
[2:34:57] you're truce will not run dry your
[2:35:00] Barrel will not be empty what happened
[2:35:03] to that God
[2:35:08] 's got things coming to pass in our
[2:35:11] lives
[2:35:12] and and and no wonder in lady osia he
[2:35:18] says I counsel thee
[2:35:20] to buy of me I have that you might see
[2:35:27] when we when our thinking
[2:35:30] disregards the birthright
[2:35:33] we've got the wrong thinking to our
[2:35:36] Birthright which is our mystery election
[2:35:39] in him
[2:35:42] yeah you don't fit in the churches
[2:35:46] you'll never fit
[2:35:48] you won't fit in the corporate world you
[2:35:50] won't fit on the job you've been
[2:35:53] predestinated to be an oddball
[2:36:00] you're not going to win the Home Run
[2:36:02] Crown you're not going to win the
[2:36:04] Kentucky Derby you're not going to win
[2:36:07] Wimbledon
[2:36:14] but you can win the crown of life
[2:36:18] the gift of God wasn't riches
[2:36:22] he came to the poor of this world rich
[2:36:25] in faith the gift of God's eternal life
[2:36:27] through Christ Jesus
[2:36:30] his gift is his spirit
[2:36:33] coming in you that will Quicken you and
[2:36:36] change you out of this world that's
[2:36:39] rapidly falling he says
[2:36:42] now you see a secret
[2:36:45] to what to restore Fallen Eve
[2:36:49] as she was prefigured of the church
[2:36:54] and now notice as God opens up the sight
[2:36:57] of Adam and took out Eve by his own
[2:37:01] flesh and blood
[2:37:02] and divided his Spirit from masculine to
[2:37:05] phenomen to feminine he put it in Eve he
[2:37:09] took the rib from under aside and made
[2:37:12] Eve out of it it was God did the same
[2:37:16] thing
[2:37:19] taking out of the sight of Christ the
[2:37:22] blood and the water and Christ is the
[2:37:25] word and taking the word and making up
[2:37:28] his church Eve see back to himself again
[2:37:32] Redeemed by the blood that was come from
[2:37:35] his body you see it now God's great
[2:37:39] mystery now being unfolded it's been hid
[2:37:42] since the foundation of the world but
[2:37:45] Pete prefigured all the way down
[2:37:52] my Birthright this morning is to be Eve
[2:37:57] to be the feminine part
[2:38:00] of the bridegroom
[2:38:03] to become one with the word and in an
[2:38:07] invisible Union
[2:38:08] not to compromise
[2:38:12] to filter everything through
[2:38:15] to get back and and
[2:38:18] like Jesus said he says the kingdom is
[2:38:22] God is like a pearl
[2:38:25] of great price
[2:38:27] and when a man finds it he sells all
[2:38:30] that he has that he might possess this
[2:38:33] Pearl
[2:38:35] it's like a woman that loses the coin
[2:38:39] she sweeps the whole house out and
[2:38:41] garnishes the house and searches for it
[2:38:44] till it's restored and then she invites
[2:38:47] her neighbors and says that which is
[2:38:49] lost has been found
[2:38:53] what will a man give in exchange for a
[2:38:57] soul
[2:38:58] what would you give this morning
[2:39:01] for your Birthright
[2:39:07] what you're thinking towards the
[2:39:10] birthright I'm talking to myself this
[2:39:12] morning
[2:39:14] how how what what prize do I put on it
[2:39:19] what beauty do I put on a god you chose
[2:39:22] me
[2:39:24] low down
[2:39:26] wretched hippie sinner yeah
[2:39:29] with no hope at all
[2:39:32] of ever going anywhere but maybe the
[2:39:36] jail
[2:39:39] and you set me free
[2:39:42] not only that you revealed the light of
[2:39:45] the last day to me
[2:39:47] you let me see the seals open up you let
[2:39:51] me see you standing in your church ages
[2:39:53] you let me see the seven candlesticks
[2:39:56] and the Seven Stars
[2:40:00] you let me see the Feast of the trumpets
[2:40:10] and I I appreciate it Lord
[2:40:15] but that wasn't my purpose
[2:40:18] my purpose was to make an un
[2:40:22] compromising life
[2:40:25] that only did what the word said
[2:40:29] and to get rid of all my own thinking
[2:40:33] all my own decisions all my own things
[2:40:37] and become a prisoner
[2:40:39] to my Birthright
[2:40:42] Esau
[2:40:44] didn't regard the birthright
[2:40:47] and Jacob
[2:40:49] he wanted it
[2:40:52] I could go through that story for one
[2:40:55] way it really belonged to Jacob
[2:40:58] to begin
[2:40:59] because he had the Redemption string on
[2:41:03] his finger
[2:41:04] just like
[2:41:06] Rahab
[2:41:07] just like all of us this morning we
[2:41:10] never did nothing religious
[2:41:13] to get there
[2:41:14] but he chose you
[2:41:18] don't ask me why
[2:41:21] I have no reason why God would choose
[2:41:25] any of you
[2:41:30] I'm glad the choosing is not mine
[2:41:34] I'm glad the choosing is his
[2:41:37] and I don't know why he did it
[2:41:41] I can't explain the reasons I can't
[2:41:44] explain anything but God revealed to me
[2:41:48] the purpose why you did
[2:41:54] the purpose the reason that you've done
[2:41:57] something
[2:41:58] the reason I exist
[2:42:01] and when I can look at the birthright
[2:42:04] and say that's my election
[2:42:06] I was elected to be the second Eve
[2:42:12] I was elected to stand in Satan's Eden
[2:42:17] in the God of this evil age
[2:42:20] and tell him I am not going to eat the
[2:42:25] fruit
[2:42:27] of your tree of knowledge and of your
[2:42:30] civilization
[2:42:33] that there is an elected people
[2:42:36] has been rose up in this day
[2:42:39] to stand there and say I don't care how
[2:42:42] you present it you Wicked angel of Light
[2:42:45] there's a voice that came in this day
[2:42:49] to point you out
[2:42:52] to expose your filter to expose
[2:42:55] everything is and to tell me that
[2:42:57] there's an elected lady that's standing
[2:43:00] here that will not compromise on the
[2:43:03] word of God she will accept her
[2:43:05] Birthright she will accept her election
[2:43:09] and she will say I am she
[2:43:15] and believe it
[2:43:19] not doubted
[2:43:21] I don't want to substitute anointing
[2:43:25] for Revelation
[2:43:27] I hope that whatever we do here all our
[2:43:33] purpose is all of my heart's desire is
[2:43:36] in preaching the gospel
[2:43:39] and all the suffering that goes with it

[2:44:11] compromise on the word she accepts
