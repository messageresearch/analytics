song special we'd like to ask him to sing for us but my sister sharon she just asked the church to be in prayer an urgent need came for her co-worker her co-worker's name is ashton he was working on a vehicle and it fell on them and they have no hope they're they're in the hospital and feeling that the doctors are just feeling there's no chance but sister sharon said i know with if god's people are praying for him then there's a chance and so we just want to plead that god can use this opportunity just to show them their grace and pray that sister sharon could be a light to them during this time so let's just remember them in prayer just also the other needs that that's been mentioned we're so grateful for the wonderful testimonies that we've been hearing sister melinda and brother kyle and a little celine just should it increase our faith amen we continue to remember a little boy at brother matt morris's church um i believe it's his name is amos um he was by god's grace they they god spared his life and he he looks to i mean burns can be uh much worse but he was he was burnt bad but um their whole house was burnt to the ground but their little amos he's 14 year old boy he got burned really bad on his hands and so um side of his face and a little on his nose but we're believing for complete perfect healing of that young man and we we told them that we're going to really be praying and going before the lord on that be on their behalf or there's just many needs that we never want to let them fall to the ground so let's just remember those needs brother if you'll come and

i wanted to thank the lord um last wednesday um we stopped by the store real quick after church and i thought you know the boys didn't want to stop and they were tired and hungry and i said you know it was late so i picked up a bag of chips and i said that'll keep them busy in the car and when we were home my husband and i were trying to get them to brush their teeth and you know how get ready for bed take showers and i had esther on the counter and we were both right there and so he reaches over for a chip and i thought we're right here you know he's just gonna lick the dust off of it or whatever so i let him have a dorito which i know you know i wouldn't normally do such a thing but it was so late we were tired trying to get the other kids in bed and we were right there with him well i don't know how he got distracted he ends up i guess choking on it and we had grapes on the counter so i didn't know did he grab a grape i don't think he did but at this point it didn't matter i had to grab him i sat on my lap and i was trying to you know as a nurse you try to stay calm and that was the one thing they drilled you got to stay calm no matter whether it's bleeding or broken bones or but when it's breathing and they can't breathe and they're turning colors my husband i don't think he understood the severity of it he was you know putting dishes in the sink and by then i was praying inside i said lord he started gasping for air and i realized okay something needs to happen now i mean there's no calling 9-1-1 when the baby's blue i mean you are 9-1-1 there and i said lord you're the only one who can help me now i you know i was beating his back i had flipped him over and by then i was ready to do the adult you know trying to get that out of him and he starts throwing up all the food that he had eaten but he still couldn't get that out of his you know where he was breathing he couldn't breathe and finally you know i think it was the second time that i beat him really hard and i said lord i need you to do something if you don't do anything this is it he's he can't breathe and the lord somehow that came out of his throat and i didn't still didn't know if it was a grape that he grabbed or if it was the chip but he took a deep breath and the color started to come back and i just wanted to thank the lord because you take these little things for granted and you don't you know my husband didn't realize it was so serious and he says well i didn't think he was really choking and so he had moved on and i was just praying um but you know i know you just i can't you know when you get excited and you can't think and you can't you know do anything for them so i try to stay calm but i just want to thank the lord for that and i was just reminded of that and i said lord i just got to give you glory for [Music] that sometimes in this life we might get discouraged you wonder if you're all alone you're just barely hanging on stop and believe all the things he's

and commit everything we are to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen certainly welcome everyone in the house of god uh let's just open our bibles we're gonna read uh one or two scripture then you'll be seated we'll read the rest uh genesis chapter one verse one it says that in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters oh just uh let's keep and and and read uh genesis chapter 1 and 26 it speaks about the creation of man and said god said let us make men in our image in our likeness in our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the files of the air and over the cattle of the of the earth of the cattle and all over the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the files of the air and over every living thing that move it up on the face of the earth amen yeah you may have your seats and as you seated let's also turn in exodus chapter 25. the 25th chapter let's start with verse 1 it says and the lord spake unto moses saying speaking unto the children of israel that they bring they bring me an offering and every man giveth willingly with his heart shall he take shall he take my offering and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold silver brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and ram skin dried red and badger skins and and shatim wood and oil for the for the light spices for for anointing oil and sweet incense onyx stones and stones to be set in the e part and in the breast breast plate and let them make a sanctuary that i may dwell among them now if you just see the description of what has to be done before god can come and dwell in their midst and it says according according to all that i have shown thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and pattern of the instruments therefore even socially make it and then it says and they shall make an ark of shatim wood two cubics and half shall they it shall shall be the length of it and and the cubic and a half the breadth of it and the cubic and a half the heights of it and now shall overlay with pure gold without without shall thou overlay it and shall make upon upon it a crown of gold round about let's skip to verse 31 the same chapter verse 31 it says and now shall make the candlestick of pure gold and beaten work uh work shall the candles candle sticks be made his shaft and his branches his bowels and and his knobs and his flowers shall shall be of the same the six branches shall make out out the side of it tree branches of the candle sticks out of one side and the three branches that they cannot stick out at the other side three bowels make like onto onto almonds and knobs and flowers of in in one branch and three bowels make like almond the other branch and the not with with the knob and the flower so in the six branches shall come out of the sticks it says uh let's give through 37 it says and thou shall make the seven lamps therefore and they shall light they shall light the lamps thereof they may give lights over against it and the tongues thereof of snuff snuff dishes therefore shall be a pure gold off a talent of pure gold shall they make it with with all the vessels and it says and look to thou look to that look to that thou make them after their pattern which i have shown thee in the mount now you just want to spend a few moments try not to be too long just maybe a couple of minutes just something that struck me even as our pastor just the things that he's been preaching i want to speak on uh on god's pattern in heaven god's pattern in heaven certainly enjoy the word this morning and i think it's it's a very uh telling it's very telling and very important that we we we come into the word that's been revealed to us because it's the coming into it that brings the very manifestation of what we are supposed to be seeing um i and and i've been encouraged so much with even the very testimonies that people have given i i believe the the we we have heard the message long enough and we continue to hear it we walk in the word long enough we and we continue to walk in it but it comes a time where that word has to become a reality there comes a time where that word has to take on flesh and walk and act and and i could say this even in light of what we we expect or what we call as the manifestation of the third pool it's encouraging to see the signs of it because we are being told that it's going to come a time where we can't buy or sell there's going to come a time where they're going to lock down churches and if we're still here we have to have something that can work we have to have something that we will hear the word of god it would move upon us and we'll speak the word and i'm so encouraged because when you look at all of these testimony that have been given there's almost a common characteristics and that's when you speak the word when you ask why don't you pray why don't you ask why don't you tell him why don't you do this so it's move upon it's not just a believer sitting there and waiting oh god if you can oh god if you could just know it's actually come down to the manifestation of this hour which is that i have been empowered to do this i have been given power i have been chosen and called for this purpose that i can speak the word and god will move upon it god is the relationship has changed it's no longer god in heaven we live in a time where the god of creation who created all things who came and dwelt in his son the scripture says we live in a time where god is in his people when you want to see god you see his people it's no longer just something we can dream of but we see it when we hear those testimony we see god and we are encouraged by it so as we read the scripture here we see uh god's pattern in heaven we can look at it and i just hope it can connect with what was preached in the morning because it's very important we come to realize that we are we are carrying something we are not left at our own devices this is part of the master plan that a believer will carry out the word of god and god will come and vandicate that believer for the faith that they have shown in carrying out the word so it speaks here as we read in genesis it says the spirit of god moved upon the face of the earth we could look and and and we can see uh we know the scriptures very well we see that god came and he moved and he began to create things and and he came and we are told that god came and he said let her be now i i just want to stop there for a moment when he says let her be we know that barbara speaks about how that the word went forth and it took millions of years and and he brought forth what god was speaking about and our pastor touched this morning and said that uh uh uh that god brings his word by interpretation in other words when we see the interpretation then we understand what was spoken when the prophecy is given we have no idea when he says this is going to happen uh anybody any man can say whatever they want but when we see the manifestation of it that becomes the interpretation of what was spoken so when god said let her be now i just want to move you back just for a little bit let her be and then we know that when god said it something went out of him and he created what god wanted now but i want you to think about before the word was very spoken the very word was spoken letter b because when it's spoken it's spoken with an intention it's spoken with a specific motive and objective it's spoken and it's waiting for something specific to come out so before this god was sitting there with all his thoughts and he was sitting there with all his mind and i thought it's so we don't even have the vocabulary to begin to explain this i just thought about it for a moment i was lost even myself to just think about okay we say well this was in god's mind and oftentimes when we think mind we think our own mind where things come in and go out as quick as they come in and we walk up we're going to go do something we forget what we're about to do we got to go back and and by the time we get back we remember what we wanted to do so it's not even equal to what we would construct within our own mindset that in the mind of god but if i could just uh for a moment and say we you take a a brandon comes and he preached christ the mystery of god revealed and he began to tell us what actually when we say the mind of god what do we mean when we say the mind of god it says that god had threefold purposes in other words when we speak we say the mind of god we are looking at the fault purposes of god from the beginning the mission and what he was trying to achieve so when he said let her be you look in the threefold purposes what exactly did he want to do it says he wanted to know his people and he wanted to have dominion and he wanted to be one with him and he wanted to restore his kingdom so here he is at the very beginning he's speaking of his kingdom when he says let her be it was the heavens manifesting himself on earth when i say the heavens i don't want you to look at the sky i want you to think about this mind of god this god who created everything this god who had no one knew everything what was in his mind there was not even an expression or anything but then he said let there be out of this heaven of god something is being expressed on earth and and that prophet tells us that the earth is supposed to be or is created to be an image of what came from heaven so when he say letter b is modifying the things that we see and he's taking and breaking up the seas and he's doing this is taking what is in the heaven and manifesting it on a certain earth he's taken and he's doing all of that so we we see that so we can say the earth and the creation began to be made to match what was in god's mind and so everything now is being created to come back and match what god was speaking everything is being formed into the matching of what came from this heaven of god that he was speaking of so we find out we we that he began to speak and we find out that uh the mind of god and how he comes and and he explains it himself and we then began to look within our mind the scripture tells us that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so within this mind all of this has already taken place and yet on earth nothing has happened yet within this mind all of this planning has already taken earth and when the word is going forth the word is carrying out this mind that has already completed everything so that when it comes out it's perfectly no wonder when it came out god said this is good no wonder why when he spoke it came out it says this is good when it came out it says this is good why because it was the representation of what was in heaven is being seen on earth oh i tell you we serve almighty god that's why we don't have to worry tonight we're just like we heard it this morning if we have the message within our heart if we have this message if we are carriers of this seed if we are carriers of the package if we are carriers of the revelation of the end time that is going to manifest why because it's the mind it's a heaven being manifested on earth so now when i s when i'm speaking about uh uh uh a pattern i want us to have this in mind it's when you speak about pattern it speaks about a construct of something how something is built it's a it's a design it's a model and i can say this everything has a pattern you just have to see it everything has a pattern you know we could talk about building and how to build this and everything and and those that are in construction they can look at it and see the skeleton and know what wood and what type of wood will go where and how you would lay the foundation and how long and how the mixture of everything has to be exactly and all of that why because they have the pattern within the head you know we can speak about uh uh uh uh uh we can speak about computers those that are in computers can look at it and they can see you just have to say a few words they can put it together they understand how everything is built and all of those things so as we speak about this pattern we're seeing how that god is taking heaven and is bringing it down to manifest it on earth how because when we can identify the pattern then we can see god how it's moving but random calls himself a typologist why because he was able to go into the bible and identify the pattern by which god did things he was able to go and look at the type and look at one type and look at another and look at another and be able to determine that if god did this over here if he repeated it over here that same god if he comes back to do anything it cannot contradict the others because the scriptures cannot be broken so we see within this mind there was the perfect plan of god the perfect plan of redemption and how the god wanted to everything to play out and then it says as we read the scripture it says let us make man in our image now we we understand that god as we read in genesis chapter 1 that he was let us make man in our image it was a spirit god is a spirit so he came and he made man and the man that he made was a spirit man but the the very focus that he made the man of the reason he said as we read in genesis was for him to have dominion what they have to rule over the earth was for him to take uh uh uh the earth and subdue it and and make it work according to his will and and and and be the god on earth be the manifestation of heaven on earth so the pattern of god is in heaven but it's it's reflected to reflect this this mind of his and all that he has done he wanted it displayed and reflected back back on earth so the purpose of making man was so he can do exactly what he did in heaven so he can do it on earth he wanted a perfect manifestation of who he was into earth and then we find out that men fall from that and so the scripture says that how it becomes very important that we see that the earth is to be made in the pattern of heaven in matthew 6 and 9 the scripture says jesus came and and the disciples came in and they came to him and he says that teach us how to pray just after what manner we should pray he says in verse 9 it says and in this manner they therefore ye pray said our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name that kingdom comes and that will be done in earth as it is in heaven so everything was was with the purpose of of manifesting in this earth what was in heaven what's the the purpose that that that what when we look at the earth that we should be able to pick up what is it that's happening in heaven because god didn't do anything on earth unless he done it in heaven first so he says that will be done as in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debt and so as we forgive our debtors let us not uh lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil from that is the kingdom and the power and the glory uh forever amen and then it says in 14 it says for for if ye forgive forgive men they trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not man for the trespasses therefore you will therefore therefore neither will your father forgive you their trespasses you know so here he is showing once again that god's will in heaven the desire was for that will to be manifested on earth the the and i'll say this the purpose of the revealing of the word of the hour as our pastor touched this morning today the scripture is fulfilled the purpose of that revealing of that message is not just to come so we can come to a place and say we have the holy ghost and we are happy about it but the purpose was to bring us right back into the beginning so we can get back in the same condition that adam was in the beginning the purpose was that this message was a restoration message that was to restore back the condition and to restore because remember what random says the the nature didn't fail the animal didn't fail none of them fell the only person that committed sin and felt was man and so the word that was coming and then we with him falling everything came into chaos everything came into chaos because men fell but the purpose of the message was so that god can come and reveal not just to reveal us pentecost because we have to be birthed as our pastor said we have to be birthed back into that kingdom we have to be now we are here looking back at the pattern that was back on heaven yeah yeah we are now sitting here today we it's not it's no longer as looking from the vantage of god sitting there and trying to reveal his mind but we have been given access to the word that shows us what the pattern was right back from the beginning so it comes it's to restore that man back into the condition where he can have dominion over the fish of the earth and where he can have dominion over over the animal over everything come back into the image of what god created him to be so bring us into the condition where the supernatural is happening in our lives bring us into a place where we can hear testimonies like we heard we're hearing today where god is constantly manifesting himself i tell you that's the purpose of god from the beginning who's this melchizedek god's intention was to dwell within a flesh with with his being he wanted to talk like you talking he wanted to hear like you're hearing he wanted to be one with his people he wanted to come and and and and and once again not just in creation from the beginning where he cast down devils not just from jesus christ where he died and defeated the enemy no from the very man that the devil caused to fall that god will come and dwell within the fallen flesh it will come and redeem it and bring it right back into a place where the same flesh will do the same oneness that he did when he was in the garden of eden that's the vantage point that we are looking this from and we can see the pattern in the world we can see the life of our prophet and see we see that pattern so now he comes and it says we see how this pattern has to be manifested it shows us and he tells as we read about moses now he tells moses he says now he gives him all the measurements and he says now i want you to go back up there and he says i want you to build this tabernacle this dwelling place of god where i can come down and dwell with you i want you to build it according to the specification god gave this specification god gave the measurements god gave how it should look god gave everything and moses took all this in traction and went and built it and god came and dwell in it oh i was so thankful for the message of the hour god has given us all the instructions it's giving us all the measurements it's told us about the new city that we're gonna go dwell in he's told us about the statue of the perfect man it's giving us the mystery about adoption he's giving us all those things why so we can just take it and follow it why because that's the pattern that will take us right back into where we came from it will take us right back that why it's the pattern of god if ever god ever done one thing one way he cannot change it he's obligated to do it the same way and and he sent a prophet messenger to come not just to preach the message or we can hear it he came and he demonstrated what he preached god took a man and he brought him right back into eternity manifesting the same thing that adam did so we can know that when we believe the same way he'll produce the same thing [Applause] [Music] so he comes and he gives them he says this these are the specs that i want you to follow i want you to build it according to this and i want you to follow this i want you to follow all this measurements and everything and it will produce it will produce the good so the children of god we said we we we are being given a pattern by which we can walk by the scripture says in first peter chapter 2 and verse 9 it says ye also a lovely stone he says ye are built up a spiritual house of the holy priesthood he says to offer up sacrifice spiritual sacrifice is acceptable by to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is con it is contained in the scripture behold alain zion achieved cornerstone it says elect says precious and he that is that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which are also which also believed he is a precious but unto them which are disobedient to the stone which the builder disallow the same is made the head corner the head of the corner it says and the stone it says in the stone of its stumbling and the rock of offense even to them which stumble at them and them words being disobedient were unto also where they were appointed it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that he should show forth the praises of him that has called you out of darkness into a marvelous light here he is giving a description of what is it the pattern that we need to be walking into you are a chosen people you are people that have been selected oh i tell you you know but imagine he was preaching the other day people want to do away with the prophet that's the devil right there because he knows a prophet is a pattern of god since the beginning the scripture says in amos that god will do nothing unless he reveals his secret to the prophet you do away with the prophet you don't have the word you don't have the word and i want to even say this it was men that chosen say to god we don't want you to speak we want you to pick a man that you could speak us to us through and god has kept the pattern from the beginning god speaks to one man that one man speaks to a generation and if you do away with that one man you don't have the word that's the pattern of god we're not going back in some half truth or some madman understanding on all of that we're going back with the blueprint we're going back with the pattern that has been established from the beginning a word of god by which we can walk by talk by live by why it produces the same thing that it produced from the beginning it has never changed that's the pattern of god you know and i wonder today what a man people wants to build their own way people that want to do away with everything you know man wants i wonder what pattern are we walking by every day when we walk up in the morning what pattern are we putting in our mind and we think oh if i work hard i'll make more money that's a trick of the devil oh if i do this i'll get this no you're not made to prosper by the economy of the world you are meant to prosper by the economy of the above follow the pattern follow the pattern you know and i'll just say this this has been on my mind for quite some time you know oftentimes we speak about even you know sisters and how they dress and all of those things and rightfully so because that's the word we gotta keep in line and make sure that because we are a people from that kingdom we are here to reflect back that kingdom and therefore we have to follow the pattern that has been given for us from above the world was not made to be in its own image it was meant to be a reflection of what came down from heaven into earth and i'll say this i see so many times even on young people you know there's this this pence that just seems to be a little too tight and and coming up and the socks are showing and and the suit looks like they bothered the young the the the the little one's jacket like i'm wearing my son's jacket or something and it's up here it seems like it can't close and the shoes looks to be like you can put two feet in it that's something that that's not the pattern of heaven that's not the pattern we have received there's a different pattern of modesty that we have received by the word of god and that's what we need to walk by [Applause] i'll say this that why is the pattern so important the scripture speaks about job it says that he looked he came to a place and the scriptures speak about how that things had come upon him and he looked at the he says in john 38 and one and and and so he began to think about everything that was happening god came and the his callow was taking his children and all the things that he owed was being taken it he couldn't understand it and and the job began to pray and he began to intercede and and the scripture but it speaks about how he looked at nature he was able to see the pattern he was able to see something he says well when i look at the flower it says the life comes up and it comes all the way up it produces a flower it dies now not that the life dies the fly the life gets out of the flower the flower itself is just recovering it falls that life goes back right back into the root when the season comes again that same life comes back up into a leaf again and creates another one oh i tell you that's why the prophet tells us even the bible tells us a believer does not die there's no way you can die why because in heaven you'll be the same life the same life that's speaking to you tonight it'll be the same life that you're sitting with here it just be a different flesh why because this flesh is a corruptable it cannot make it to the other side in fact paul said that if this body be dissolved there's already another one [Applause] as part of the pattern of god that's waiting for you to receive that soul back into it amen so he looked and he sees the the pattern in everything he sees the pattern in everything around him so now he asks this question what becomes of man when men dies then what will become of him he says i see the pattern everywhere but i don't see anything for man you see at that time it was seemed like it was hidden he couldn't see the pattern but oh as we began to in the seat and he prayed that's how he a lot of i just spoke at that great revelation it says i know my redeeming living and i know that if i die that in this flesh i shall see god for myself why because he understood that if god ever done one thing one way he's obligated to do it again if i can see the pattern in the flowers if i can see the pattern in the trees that same pattern has to exist for mankind so in 38-1 it says after he had spoken all that he could speak the scripture says then the lord answer job out of the world it says who is this that dwelleth that that darkened counsel by words without knowledge who is this that speaking these things without understanding it says it says get up get up that alone like a man for i will demand of thee and answer doubt me it says where was thou when i laid the foundation of the world now i'm taking you back right back into this heaven of god it says declares that if god has understanding it says had that laid the measurement thereof if thou knoweth or if uh whoever stresses the line upon it where it says whereupon i'll doubt the foundation there was fastened and laid the cornerstone thereof it says when the sun when the morning stars sang together all the sons of god shouted for joy oh i looked at that and i began to think about you know but when i'm speaks about i believe it's in the message my life story says i went i went to this pentecostal church he says i got there and i was sitting there and it says then they call the men to preach it says then they call and they pick up this old man who was looked to be about 90 i'm not sure what agent said and he came he couldn't even stand straight and and he said they pulled him out of the congregation and said i felt sorry for the man because there were so many young people that could preach there why did they pick a man that looked like he couldn't even stand but he said oh that old man got up there it says he began to talk he says all the ministers that came before him that preached about god and and the things that we are facing and now we can overcome and all those things but he said when this old man came up here he didn't just preach about this it went right back into the pattern of god right back into the beginning when the sons of god shouted for joy i just want to say to us tonight there was a time where you shouted for joy what we're living here is only a reflection of what already played the scripture says there's nothing new under the sun so if we are here it's because we all we had a representation there and we are here only reflecting what's already been played up to him so i want to tell you tonight if you had victory over there there's no way you can lose there's no way you can be defeated because why he breaks the pattern oh i tell you god didn't take up his time for nothing he didn't sit there with the heavens and planning and killing the lambs and planting this and this and this so you can come back here and be defeated no the reason is the scripture says that we bypass our theophany we have no knowledge of what happened up there but the scripture says that back there we're already with him oh if we can only follow the pattern this is nothing new this is something that was already spoken that was already represented up there we're just walking right back into it [Applause] it says when the sun that's why you know barbara says the job the oldest spoke in the bible when he said it i just thought oh this is such true now it's coming it's my blessing even genesis it's bypassing even genesis going right back into what genesis says in the beginning god job comes and the the scripture says and speaking to him it says where were you before i even laid the very foundation where were you so he's taken him right back into a god he's sitting there with his own mind and he's thinking about all these things and how they're going to happen and within the mind the victory was already given even before the war started god is not a god who gives you something that will cause you to fail the very reason why he gives it to you is because you were with him because you were part of him you were victorious we only hear manifesting now which was already spoken so he says it says it speaks here it says i wish we had a little time to go in job 7 and 37 and see it says where it says whereas where was where it says where were you when i laid the foundation of the world before i let the foundation of the world declared as me it says where were you fasting at or were you or when when the morning stars sang for sang together and the sons of god started for joy tell me job buckle up yourself like a man i want to speak to you it says and now paul said he chose us in him the church before the foundation of the world it says watch watch we should that we should be holy it says not our holiness well you say you believe in holiness but brandon i said sure it says sure not mine but his my holiness is nothing is nothing his is perfect he says well you say do you believe that you can drink it says oh no i never said that look a grain of with can can only produce wheat it says it can't produce cocker bird there's no desire in it there's no life in it to produce cocker bird with it says if you if you are if you are in jesus christ it says it says don't be deceived you you had better search this close now see close now see if you keep on saying well i don't condemn me to do this and i don't condemn me to do that things through the things of the world and now i'm going to hurt just a little bit to pull back the further the feathers and back other the other way it says but it's it's one thing sure evidence that you've been you've you've been you've been to christ you've never been born if he says you've never been born again he says he that loveth the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in him it says now if you just quit doing it because you know you ought to do it and quit doing this quit doing this it says that sign that you haven't got nowhere yet when you when it says when that thing becomes dead in you and their nature is gone away there is another person in there and it's it can only produce the holy words that was in christ in you produces christ like life now i i i again i i feel like it's very important that we see from what vantage point he's talking about because i don't think i'll have time to read it but he talks about at one place it says it's like a woman has good you know and they have goods and they want to sow something it said what they do is they take a pattern whatever if they want to make a skirt or whatever it says they will take a pattern and lay it on top of that goods and it's only the part that falls within that pattern that's the part that's accepted everything else will be rejected it says now remember the goods is the same it's but with the same price it's the same price it's same with everything but the pattern that's laid on top cuts out so you can only select a portion of what you want to use oh i tell you my brother my sister it's not about christianity it has nothing to do with the bible and all of that it's all about election and the people that god has chosen to be as members of this bride this is a pattern of himself his lady terror and he knows who's in there and who's not that's why he said you have not chosen me i have chosen you and not just that he has chosen you he's giving you a specific place and role for you to play that cannot be changed you're not a christian like just any other christian you're a different kind of christian why because you are being lifted up by the word like i said it's the revealing of the message god when pastor said it this morning you know when god shows these things when we look in the scriptures and we begin to see these things it's god opening your eyes so you can see the pattern how many people read about the woman with the purple dress and just said it means nothing it means nothing why because they so hell bound to just reject the message they don't matter what you say they don't have it within them to believe with they just want to reject nothing within them just didn't want to take the consideration i was thinking about what brethren says about the woman at the well and the priest see the difference is when the sons of the morning shouted for joy that woman was represented in there [Applause] and the priest had zero representation in there that's why all he could see was wrong wrong wrong wrong oh but when the woman when he came he says give me water and he says i know you had seven husbands six husbands and the one that you're dwelling with right now is not yours and everything that matched some pattern she said i know that the messiah will come and when he comes you will do the things that you just did why because she had a pattern within her heart i tell you it's the same thing with us in this evening life we heard the message it matched something that was within our heart a pattern that god established [Applause] [Music] how we're going back just follow the pattern just follow the pattern just follow the word it will pull you just a little by little it will just pull you little by little and before you know you go right back into eternity before you know you they're just shouting for joy the same picture of you that was up there is manifested right down here why the purpose of god is for heaven to be manifested on earth the purpose of god is for heaven to be seen on earth walking on earth talking on earth but one of them says that the earth is full with the devil this is set in seating we've been told there's 300 000 more demons and thousand thousand more demon upon the earth but it says heaven is also on earth and heavenly how is heaven manifested oh there's a projection up there in heaven and god has a son and a daughter down here that are manifesting his kingdom they just want to be just like their daddy that's why we can never be successful in following any other pattern but random says the church is become everybody copying one another you know this one does this the other doesn't you know we dress like the world we act like the world and there's a tick tock video everybody follows it there's the ice bucket challenge everybody does it there's this and this and everybody is following what pattern is that that's not the pattern of heaven that's not the pattern that's going to get us back over where we came from that's not the pattern that's going to give us what we have need of oh but there's a pattern by the word of god you believe the word you walk by it you become carry off the seed you testify of it even when people ridicule you that pattern will get you back where you came from if the musician could come that's the pattern of heaven that's the pattern would be called to walk by there's no other pattern on earth it's the panel of god he sends messengers he sends prophets to bring words to his people and when they receive it it's god that they're receiving and if god has brought them back with moses out of the wilderness and i'll say this perhaps i've said it before in the first accidents they were coming from a natural land to another natural land and they all died in the wilderness second exodus they were coming out of a spiritual conditioning to another they came here they are and they were persecuted and the church went into the ground oh but in the 10th exodus there's a promise that there's a people that are going to lift off the earth these people are not going to test that these people are going to take why it's the pattern of the end time god is gonna come and just take them off the earth why because they are a top of enoch why because it's the promise of the hour oh i'm so happy with what we have received i tell you my heart can contain what we have received there's nothing to be ashamed of don't be ashamed of him testify of him live for him walk for him do everything for him why that pattern will take you right back into eternity let's all stand if our pastor can come [Applause] hey man let's just sing that as you invite our pastor this time the generation the final voice the world oh that the coming of the lord is all living now [Music] go become [Music] [Music] oh sing it again [Music] is [Music] now you know why billy's my favorite preacher he is i'd rather listen to billy than anybody except for brother branham i'm sorry you're number two i mean now just think of really what he said right because so god's got this pattern he's laying this pattern here well you know he's got another pattern to fulfill don't you i go to prepare a place for you you know what i mean so he's already got something there that you've got to match up to so he's taking you here cutting you out here so he can place you in that pattern there so he took it from there to here and then he's going to take it from here to there this makes me kind of get happy why because if i was there and i manifest here i can't miss there he's not done until i'm there and he can't fail no wonder brother brahm said if you had eternal life you always had external life oh i feel sorry for someone that's not in this message they're just looking for here trying to find the whole thing oh this means this and if you go back and look at their messages over 20 years they've changed what they believed and the trend changes and they changed we got one that come here and he could take us from there [Music] to there he never left us here he always put us there's a city there's a royal seed there's a lamb beyond the river there's a fruit tree there's a life tree there's a river of life and we'll be there amen let's do let's go if the spirit of christ dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body amen so don't worry if he takes you and mold you because he already has a pattern of you what you are to be there so he's going to cut it out until we fit that pattern and when we fit that pattern here we go i don't care if it's one by one if you knew right now you could get into the perfect image of christ and he'd take you home how quick would you try to get your life a hundred percent together hey man billy i enjoyed that brother why did you quit i was ready to just keep going amen lord bless you like i told you i leave monday to see my mother anyway just keep that in prayer i want to thank god for letting me have her so long you know my heart goes out so many of us haven't been able to see our loved ones many believers loved ones have went to meet with the lord and they weren't there and it's sad and and i haven't lost my mind many of you might not know that melinda's real name is mary and gelbert and i call her mary and that so tim dad calls her mary too so i don't know who's closer to insanity tim you're your dad or me but but that's that's her real name so all those that were concerned about my health and about my mental stability uh uh i thank you for your kind thoughts but i i'm still together that far now i might not be able to recognize her in four or five years from now i don't know that's up to the grace of god but that's what i've learned to come to color and and and so anyway all's well are you anxious to go home amen oh i'm glad let's sing that that's good i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god hallelujah oh i'm so glad i'm a part of the family [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] it's because [Music] [Applause] we all share [Music] praise the lord [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] as we traveled hey amen amen

you lord because we've heard your word that's the only thing that changes so we ask lord as we go from here we set about our chores the days living whatever it may be lord whether we're housewives or on the job leading a crew whatever it is lord maybe christ like in everything we say and do [Music] lord even our very thoughts need to reflect you for our prophet said that our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words on earth so lord we can just take that and consider it lord he said not to be negative in any way these things are hard to attain to but lord we know that it's by your will and your word lord we will be that perfect spotless bride lord and it's not of our choosing but if it's your own so as we go from here lord may we just be happy excited about what the future holds
