enough words that we could all sit here and just talk about your goodness and your grace Upon Our Life [Music] how you let us Lord how you walked with us Lord how you just show us every day that you're always with us and you'll never leave us because Lord you chose the bride and you always had your eye on her because she used to be without spot a wrinkle and Lord we're just so grateful for your word I pray Lord tonight that you Lord you help me move out of the way I'm maybe a little nervous but I asked Lord that you would have your way Lord It's Your word it's not my words there's nothing that I could come up with Lord but it's just your word and so Lord I pray that you bless us tonight Lord that you would have your way that you would come and dine with us Lord it Lord we just welcome you in our midst tonight Lord we ask Lord that you would have and come and dine with us Lord and just show us your love once again it's by that love that we know you Lord Jesus we commit the rest of the service into your hands and know that everything that we have belongs to you we just leave it all into your hands now in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and to the house the Lord let's just turn to our scripture here we're going to read in Matthew 25. verse 10. and then we're going to go to Revelations 22. pray you're excited to be in the house of the Lord it's always good to be with our precious brothers and sisters like faith and just to know that we're a fellowship and around him and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with them to the marriage and the door was shut and let's also turned to Revelations 22 verses 7 to 12. it says behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard them and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then Jesus saith unto him and then then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust and he that is filthy let him be filthy still I want to concentrate on this next portion of the verse and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to every man according to his work according as his work shall be amen we just ask a blessing over the reading of the word God bless you you can just have your seats and so I'm just blessed to be in the house of the Lord tonight I if you can just pray for me I'm a little nervous and I'm just gonna obey the Lord and just follow his leadership and and just see where he takes us tonight but you know the Lord just gave me a few scriptures and a quote a few quotes on my heart for tonight and so um I want to talk about the righteous and holy reward there's a righteous and a holy reward and there's a way that we obtain that righteous and holy reward and sometimes we take a scripture and we may look at the negative let them that be filthy be filthy still but let them be filthy because we receive something that gets us to be righteous there's a message that came in this generation that we can be righteous we can be holy we can be washed by the blood of Jesus Christ and there's a union now that's happening between the word and the bride and this is not just a union between the groom and the bride but it also produces a cleansing to the bride because she must be without spot or wrinkle I was just looking into I know sometimes it's hard when you go on the internet and you type up what's the percentage of divorce these days you know my marriage is a very wonderful thing it's a very wonderful Covenant that the Lord made but the internet said that 60 of marriages in 2023 ended up in divorce there is a million 900 something worth of marriages that happened every year and 60 percent of them end up in a divorce and so you realize how the devil even tries to attack the natural way of a marriage between a a a a man and a woman trying to unsettle them and take them away from even a simple Covenant of a marriage between a man and a woman how much more will he try to deceive or try to come and and pervert or maybe even deceive the very bride of Jesus Christ but we know that his word is righteous we know that his word is Holy and as we apply this word to our life now who are changing the image of what we are you know marriage is a wonderful thing you know I you can you can reflect the people that are married the Believers that are married tonight but you know it's it's a it's a decision that you make that you know you have to live with the rest of your life it's something that you have to be sure about because now you become one in pain and suffering in good and bad and up and down there's a lot of things that now we're uniting when we when we marry our loved one marriage is intimate marriage is love marriage is also a union between the bridegroom and the bride and verse 12 in Revelations 22 says and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be brother Branham says this and humble thyself he says Across the Nation will come those who are dead in Christ will rise first we believe for a rapture says the Rapture will take place the church will be taken home and then the tribulation was set in it says oh my we don't want to be here during that time I don't want to be here in the tribulation no God forbid that any of us would be here during that time because he says he that is filled to be filthy still and he that is Holy be holy still and he that is righteous be righteous still to know the lamb had come forth with his book of redemption and the bride has to be taken out and those who turned it down has to go through the tribulation period both Jews and Gentiles what a time of tribulation I don't want to do that Lord sanctify me now that's a good Nazarene Doctrine and it's the truth it's true that's right it says fill me now with your Holy Spirit Lord take all the word out of me now Lord it says as an old color brother said I got my ticket in my hand it's already punched and when I come down to the river that morning I don't want no trouble so that's about right I don't want no trouble hold your ticket in your hand because we're going over think of it just think of it it says that's great time of redemption that great time of redemption is at hand my saints that makes me happy because now we could be in the expectation of receiving the Redemption of the very word that God sent in this generation amen and I wanted to just maybe say a little bit of a portion of my testimony tonight not long but excuse me a lot of you guys a lot of you know my my past and we fellowshipped around my my testimony but you know I grew up in a very Christian home um my mom and dad always try to have the word of God around us they the best they could with what they've known and most of my life as a child up until about 19 or 17 18 19 years old I grew up in the Pentecostal Church and so there was always something that stuck with me every time we would meet I know we would be at church every Thursday and every Sunday we would we would we would do the best we can to serve the Lord with what we knew and so at the age of 16 I um I made a decision to follow the lord I said Lord I want to give my heart to you and I got baptized and then with the Lord Jesus Christ and so at that moment you know I had a fire in my heart I said Lord I want to follow you just like any of us you know you make a decision and you're like Lord I want to follow you and after I got baptized a few years later we end up moving out of state and um then we start pretending again on a Pentecostal church again and 2005-2006. and within that timing the Lord was dealing with me the Lord was really trying to show me something as we were just walking in this on this road that he was leading us and there was always something inside of my heart where I was like Lord your gospels being preached your words being said but the life of the people don't match what they're saying it it just always struck me how you know there was the word at the light that they've had but but the life was not lived according to even the word that was being said so now as we're just partaking of this and I'm the Lord's dealing with this with me I start just getting into things that I shouldn't be getting into and you know all my life as we hear the gospel and all these things there is always testimonies there was always things that the Lord's done for other people there was always things that the Lord's done and and and and and how the Lord brought this person out and healed this person and all these things and here I am I was like Lord I don't have anything you've walked me through all this you showed me all these things but if somebody was to ask me about who is Jesus Christ I would have no way of testifying or what you've done for me and I got down to pray and I said Lord I said I want you to show yourself to me I don't want somebody else's testimony to work on me I want you to give me my testimony I want you to come live inside of me and my life would be matched to your gospel and so now there was an expectation now my my Visions changed instead of just doing things out of routine now there was a change where God's wanted to show me what to be like revealing to me the truth giving me something to hold on to and not only to hold Alto as a revelation but God now was changing he was transforming and so we get a hold of the message of what we call and I'll let you know now it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen it heals you when you're sick it delivers you when you're down it keeps you up when you're weak it it it it it brings you into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and it's because it's the voice of the age and as I'm starting to as I'm starting to walk now into the message and the Lord's showing me things that I realized that God is wanting to manifest himself to the revelation of the word in me a personal relationship and so I was really happy because all this life there was something inside of me that knew that there was something great and I was like Lord why are the people now living according to your gospel and so the lord gave me a a revelation about that because I seeked I asked the Lord and and so as as the time was passing on the Lord was just bringing us up but let's turn over to Revelations 19. as we just continue his word won't come back void science if we seek him if we ask with the sincere heart he'll give us what we ask for and it's the obedience to the word Revelations 19. verses 7 through 10. it says let us be glad and rejoice amen and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me seed thou do not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy my when we testify who Jesus is in my life when I have a revelation of who Jesus is in my life it becomes the word of Prophecy because now we have to confess the very thing we believe amen it's not just good enough to say I believe it and just remain it on page on a paper it's enough for me to understand what God wanting it for my life how I can express it in my life how I can take the very word of God the Life of Christ inside of me to live not just one day every day not just one month but every month have it be consistent where now we are in a union with the word and the union comes by revelation it's the way he knows his bride it's the way he reveals the secrets to his bride amen worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so we see that the word which is Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and he came to live down Among Us to live down Among Us proving his word brother Branham says in 64. August 16th he says now we say he's raised from the dead he says I didn't say it the word said it here they said he raised from the dead and he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man would be man would be made manifested now remember that Jesus was talking G it says not Jesus was talking to Abraham there says that could discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he was not yet born but he was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the almighty the great Almighty showing it says and Jesus said as he was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed it says not more as a church not no more he says the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed it says to join the church to the Head to unite the marriage of the Bride it says the bridegroom call will come right through this and when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church and it has to be the word and he is the word and the two unite together and do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man it says not a clergy man I don't know he says do you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church in him as one the bride and she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage it says fill your flesh says self all and of all the Flesh of mighty man because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person day two become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church become one whatsoever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing I believe that because it's the same word it's the same Angel it's the same truth that we believe that the prophet brought to us and once the seals have been opened Oh Glory to God we have access to his redeeming power for his word to be manifested inside of our hearts First Corinthians chapter 13 verses 11 through 14 says for other Foundation can no man lay that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man builds upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because they shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he had built there upon he shall receive a reward my brings me to the remembrance of the Hebrew children I wonder what word they were standing on they were told to bow down to an image of Daniel the very prophet they told him the bow down and it says no we can't do that we can't bow down to that false god and what did they do they stood upon what they believed because it was a revelation of who they had and what happened they had the right foundation they had the right foundation and when they stepped in a fire that was seven times harder my sometimes we think of these things as stories but these things were real [Music] these things were real seven times harder and they walk in and all of a sudden he's there with them the words there with them standing in their midst knowing that the Revelation they stood on it was a reward to them because their life now was saved based upon what they believed amen just like the word in the beginning it was spoken to us in the Garden of Eden it says spoken word and the second time it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the third time it became part of us and the Holy Ghost dwelling in us God coming into man it says first he spoke the word and the enemy tore down mine you could just see the image then the word was made flesh he was crucified but now amen there is a difference in the word the word is become the church and the church is the word he says God it says all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church the Holy Ghost now the enemies got something he says see then he isn't fighting something back here many people just stick the letter the letter killeth but it's the spirit that gives life it says and and they take these streets and so forth still killeth but when you are taking the spirit that's God himself how do you know it's God because he's taking the word and manifesting it then it's God himself oh my the spoken word how do we know that's God when a word just doesn't become just a word but now it has to take flesh and me if it doesn't produce fruit I keep seeking I keep digging I keep asking I keep walking I keep going and before you know it you're walking with the Lord and you're all of a sudden transformed you become clean because even the Bible says in John 15 he says you are cleansed by my word which I gave thee his word is always a cleansing power he's worth sanctifies us his word cleanses us his word which is the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unbelief and that's an application every day every hour every minute of our day that we can because the devil is trying to get in between the union of God himself the word and his bride and now he's trying to deceive by giving her a little bit of distraction here a little bit of distraction here but the word of God gets us right back in line because we know what the word says amen how do you know it's God because he's taking the word and manifesting it then it's God himself oh my the spoken word brother Branham goes through in the Ephesian Church age and I'm just going to read these these few paragraphs here and he's talking about the condition of the church but then he talks about the reward at the end of each age and he says the first church the Ephesian Church The Works of the church what was condemned what they were what God condemned them for it says it was Works Without Love the reward was the Tree of Life the Church of Smyrna Was A persecuted Church they went through tribulations the reward was Crown of Life the third church the perimist church the age of the false Doctrine Satan's lying and the foundation of the papacy rule marriage to the to the church and state it says the reward was hit Manna and a white stone the Church of tatara was the Church of the people seducing the Dark Ages the reward was power and Rule of Nations and The Morning Star the Church of Sardis was the Reformation age a great missionary he says I'm sorry or not missionary but the hidden names they had their own names and their reward was right rape meant and the Book of Life which has to come in the judgment we had we had that the other day the Book of Life it says you to be judged from the book of light the Saints are translated and taken without that they don't do that they don't go there the Phila the Phila the Philadelphia Church age was the age of Brotherly Love The Great Commission age and the great missionary age to open the door the reward was a pillar revealed the names of God was to be during this age when he went around in 1906. the lady you'll see in church age the lukewarm Church Rich increased in Goods having need of nothing but was wretched poor blind miserable and naked and the reward was set was to sit on the throne with the Lord those who overcome that age my to sit with him on the throne for those who overcome that age overcoming the age how do we overcome by his word how do we stand the Devil by his word how do we defeat the enemy by his word and if we feed upon his word we can use the word because the word is a double-edged sword right piercing given to the divider of the Sunder of our hearts and to the marrow able to use the word of God now to fight and it has to be a revealed word otherwise they won't stand and the reward was said to it was set on the throne with the Lord Hebrews says is this way but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently sick him amen he rewards you if you seek Him how does he reward you with Revelation he gives you the very word to know how to live by In This Dark Hour instead of going to Google or going to other places to find out the steps of what to do something we would rather use the word of God and have him instruct us of what to do because if we use the word it'll always be Eternal it'll never fail and the word will always produce fruits it'll always produce life it'll always produce what it was meant to produce in this generation the bride has to spend time with her Lord to know how to overcome because he already overcame and because he already overcame I can overcome through him amen it's not me that's overcoming but it's him giving me the power of His words whoever come by his word so that leaves me out of the picture I don't even have a say Lord whatever your will is lo let your will be done not my will but your will but Lord let me find you in the scripture let me find you in the message of the hour what would you like me to do today Lord who would you like me to present this very life that now I'm living for you to be able to preach this word to somebody to be able to testify at the grocery store to be able to just come and say Lord I want you to work in my life I want you to use my life I want you to use my very testimony to bring sons and daughters to bring the ones that they need the Lord to be able to testify the bright the the scripture said earlier we were reading in Revelations 19 it says that the bride had met herself ready there was something she was doing she was making herself ready to be righteous still to be holy still to continue to be cleansed by the washing of the water of the word continually amen it says that the word of God to prepare herself to overcome the temptation of this world and she would be dressed and fine linen that's the righteousness of the Saints brother Branham says this and the marriage of the lamb and this is where the Lord kind of gave me a little inspiration out of 62. January 21. he says and that we know that there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is amen because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice she has to make herself ready we have the material and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready Saints how much am I getting ready what is my consecrated life now outside the church walls at home it might be an intimate with my Lord am I praying day and night asking God to come in my life and change me because we're supposed to have a transformation of these bodies we're supposed to be walking into a new body now this transformation is coming by this word being revealed in us and I'll say this the prophet was manifesting that because the very word that came through the trunk changed the very Trump to show us what it's like to be a believer of God's word unadulterated and God now wants us to take this word because it came for me it came to cleanse me it came to redeem me it came specifically for me for my life to be able to show me to lead me to guide me to tell me Where I Belong what is my identity it says so many ways verse 54. if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but said that's up to you see you got something to do they that overcome Sharon Herod all things they that overcome you have the power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she had made herself ready I like that word the same way it is about Divine Healing God has the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you'll have to fight every winch of the way God has an amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you'll have to fight every inch of the way I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that set before us we must lay them aside ourselves we can't say God you come lay them aside for us we got to do it ourselves my I gotta get myself ready yeah there's a preparation that a Believer must have he's got to be dressed by the word dressed by the revealing of the word in our life the character of the fruit of the tree of life has to be manifested in me because it was the very thing that overcame through all the ages the reward the reward was to believe on his word and he brought you out he he he made an escape for you he saved you verse 81 and the same in the same sermon it says now marriage in one sense is a type the Earthly marriage here is the type of the Heavenly marriage now let's go over it just a few moments to rehearse at a moment the first thing there is there must be a decision made the first thing is as it takes a natural marriage is a decision has to be made the young lady has to make her decision whether she wants this young man and the young man whether he wants the young woman and it says there has to be a decision made and you have to make it see she she must be the only woman in the world that you love and he must be the only man if it isn't then you've made a wrong decision and that's the same way by making a decision for for Christ the first thing you have to do is make up your mind whether you're going to serve God and take him as your savior or you're going or you're not going to do it are you going to serve the world are you going to serve Christ you're going to make up your mind it says there has to be a decision made when you make up your mind that you're either going to serve God or Mama then you take your choice but the decision has to be made we have to make a decision today every day what am I going to choose am I going to choose the word of God or am I going to choose something that takes me away from the word of God and it starts with the little things it starts with the little things before you know it you just it gets to the bigger things because we get we get carried away right we lose the love of the word by feeding more on belief and concentrating on doing more on belief instead of loving the very word of God for this hour and the word of God has to take flesh it has to take flesh in me it has to take flesh in you it can't just remain on the tape it can't just remain on paper we have to manifest the word of God verse 84 and then after the decision is made that you are then comes the engagement that you find that at the altar you've got to make an engagement before this Union can be and that's the way it is with Christ's Church it has to be an engagement with Christ a pledge an engagement A Love Affair we have to love the word of God it doesn't have to be something that we just do because we were told but we have to find the love of the word to be manifested in my life and now when I pray and I seek God he's a rewarder of the one that diligently seeks him because he gives Revelations to those that seek Revelation and the revelation of Jesus Christ in me only makes the maturity grow Yonder it brings you more up into the stature of Jesus Christ because it starts with faith and it gives you virtue and then you and and all of a sudden we become sons and maturity verse 85 it says and then after the engagement it says in Dan the next thing is is promises made there has to be a promise made to one another like you make a promise sweetheart if you'll marry me I promise that I'll be loyal and true I will look upon no other woman I'll look upon no other man I'll do all that as a duty as a wife we have children I'll do I'll do all as a duty as a mother I'll be a housekeeper all these promises he's got to be made or should be in a correct wedding and that's the same way that's the same thing when you come to Christ Lord if you'll receive me into your kingdom I promise there you are I'll love you I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my Tidings into the storehouse I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything I'll pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right where your promise that and it should come from your hearts if you promise your husband that and not from your heart you mean it you absolutely not living correctly with them it's kind of a crystallized affair it becomes that letter because we have to live by the word the word has to be our instructor the word has to be our leader the message of the hour has to be the very thing that's leading and guiding us in verse 94 but you see so first decisions made next engagement and then promise and then the ceremony and that's the bride it says bride takes the bridegroom's name she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and when and then when the church has the ceremony it makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name then she's no longer a church of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I I don't mean that by name I mean that by the birth by Nature by power of God by the revealed truth of God and thine heart she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes as a part of Christ when she does that see she Christ injects into her his own spirit his own life the Bible said to Adam and Eve you no longer are Twain but you're one and the woman the church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one Christ in you amen that's it his life has been brought into you then you become the bride because we're bone of his bone we're flesh of his flesh we're word of his word and we're manifesting the very Life of Christ and us the uniting of the bride and the groom the cleansing of the word Upon Our Life to be able to cleanse us to be able to wash us from all unbelief to give us faith in the word knowing that it comes to pass not just say it comes to pass to see it come to pass in our life to be able to know God I stand on your truth there was a prophet in this generation that prayed for the sick a lot and he stood in the in the pulpit and he said I'll pray for a thousand people and if they don't get healed I'll pray from again the next day because his word never fails and it's by the revelation of the word in its proper time and season that God wants to use it he wants you to manifest the word every day every day every day it's a constant walk it's a constant Union paragraph 109 it says it was a beautiful type of what God did a Calvary that he overcame he overcame hell death and the grave at Calvary to be able to come and live inside of a bride to cleanse her to wash her to lead her and to show her he took Christ and connected him with the church through a Riven side he brought the blood that cleansed the person that sanctifies the Flesh of the church and puts the spirit of the Living God that he took off the cross there out of Christ and puts it into the individual then they are one they become one Christ and you are one and you and your husband should be one and if there's anything contrary then there's something wrong with your union and so we see that he brought the blood that cleansed the person that Sanctified the Flesh of the church and puts the spirit of the Living God and us paragraph one from 87 it says God calls you as an individual and it's you that's got to clean up because he's taking the people from the Gentile for his namesake his bride the Gentile amen my that makes me happy that makes me just want to praise the Lord because I know that the word is there any time we need it it's always there it's always there for us it's a matter of how much we run to the word to seek for deliverance to seek for healing to seek for Revelation to seek him in prayer to seek him and see him in our life amen I'll do the will of my father because I love him not because I have to I do the will of the father We Live the Life of Christ because we love to because there's a love that now lives inside of us to the word and that love is being expressed not only into our surroundings but everywhere that's Divine love where we can now share eternal life now we can share the love of Christ Living inside of our hearts I'll invite the musicians to come we can start closing here she had made herself ready she took the word and she had made herself ready because there was a word that she kept as a prophecy because she kept the very word of this hour to change her to transform her to take her from the condition to where she's at to be more righteous let him that be righteous be righteous still we got to keep our righteousness let him be that let him that's holy let me let him be holy still amen brother Branham uses this story here in this message and it says let me tell you a little something that happened he says I'm a missionary as you know it says do Evangelistic missionary work about seven times overseas around the world here not long ago in the city of Rome Rome is the great city of Art they had a school of art there and several of our American Young Folks go over there every year to take a year or two training in order to learn paint to learn to paint pictures there was a group of young Americans over there a few years ago as the story was told me and when they got when they get over there they just go Hog Wild when they're in Rome they do as their room as the Rome does they get out and drink and strip themselves and do everything else and carry on both girl both boys and girls and there was a certain school and in this school this group of young Americans over there every one of them almost did the same thing but there was a certain little girl she wouldn't tolerate it at all she stayed in at night time she read while they were that while they were all out drinking daytime she worked study well she was at while she was the laughing stock of the whole school and she kept herself like a lady conducted herself like a lady although there was young Roman boys and everything around trying to get her to go out she refused it no sir she stayed right with her lessons learning to draw into pain rather and she stayed with it finally an old custodian at the place kept watching her sing she was so much different although she was a Roman Catholic kept watching her how she conducted herself one evening the young girl in the park where the studio was why or the place where they had school she wanted she walked out upon the campus and went up towards the top of the hill and the sun was setting and she was standing up there with her pretty clean face and her hair hanging down looking across that way towards the setting of the Sun the Oakland State the old custodian was ranking down in the yard he kept watching the girl and he ranked something just kept telling him go talk to her so he laid his Rick down took off his old slouch hat walked up where the young lady was cleared up his throat she turned around and he said pardon me Miss she said yes sir certainly and he noticed she had been crying all the rest was out on a big spree for the night he said madame I hope that you understand me in the right way that I'm just going to speak to you I said you've been here almost two years now and I've noticed the group that you've come with continually they're out on parties and coming in all times at night drunk and clothes hats off of them and everything but I know it is that you don't attend such parties and said I know it is that seemingly that you're always looking across the sea of an evening you walk up there and stand here each evening and watch the Sun go down and he said and said what what caused that what causes that it says I'm an old man and I'm I'm curious to know what causes this difference between you and the others she said yes sir she said I'm looking towards home when the Sun is setting she said a cross beyond that sun Yonder in my homeland and she said in that land there's a certain state and in that certain State there's a certain city and in that certain city there's a certain house and in that certain house is a certain boy said he too is an artist when I left to come over here I pledge my love to him we're engaged to one another and she said no matter what any of the rest of them does that has nothing to do with me she said I promise to live true and right and she said I'm longing for the day when I feel myself on the top of the wings of that big plane that will take me across the sea and set me down at the airport where he'll meet me he's building a home and will live together in that land and said that's the reason I act the way I do I'm true to the promise that I've made a boy and he's true to the promise that he makes he makes me said I hear from him now and then and I write to him and said corresponding with one another we're still holding our vows waiting for the day to meet my what a story if we could just stand we're now we're holding to our vow we're knowing that he's redeemed the bride that loves him because he first loved her and we were always there we were always there he just allowed us to walk through this time to recognize him who he is by his word to be able to instruct us to be able to live inside of us it says oh how that would do for a real Christian to get away from the things of the world and someday you talk about coming into a port on the wings of a dove he's coming for a bride one that don't fool with the world or the things of the world she is washed in the blood of the Lamb she's pledged her her love to him only the love of the world is gone and dead to her the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready my we have a reward a reward by seeking for Revelation and that reward is the spirit of Christ inside of us living through US showing us how to overcome using the very word of this hour the revealed word of this message my what a what a time we've had in this generation what a Time a message to come to identify the very bride of Christ how much we should be in Union with that to hear from him to asking for leadership amen let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord for bringing a message to our hearts Lord you sent Malachi 4 5 Revelations 10 7. Luke 17 30. Lord you gave us this ministry only to reveal yourself to us Lord Jesus Lord I pray that we don't take it for granted Lord and we continue to seek you Lord that we continue to seek your righteousness Lord that we continue to seek Lord you in your word a revealed word of the hour continually Lord let us just be able to seek you in our prayer closet Lord in the morning when we rise to be able to just open up a scripture and have us speak to our hearts to be able to hold it for the day to be able to encourage us when we're down to be able to deliver us when we're when we need Deliverance Lord to be able to use the very word the ointment to be put Upon Our Hearts to grow us Lord Jesus to bring us into the image of this hour the image of the word that you want us to be into Lord what a privileged time we're living Lord let us just be about the consequent Our Lives fully and truly for you Lord that we would be able to have a love the Lord is so much that the things of the world won't even have an entrance inside of our heart anymore Lord that we can just continually seek you seek your faith seek your truth oh my Lord I pray that you bless every one of us in this building tonight Lord are you continue to walk with us and show us the truth the way Lord that you would be able to show us Revelation Lord Lord that you would be able to sanctify our souls our hearts Lord to continue to grow closer to you father Lord let your word be manifested in our life Lord Jesus oh thank you Father for your grace your mercy your love Oh Lord You're So Beautiful Lord your word is so rich your word is so strong Lord Jesus Lord sometimes lord it's it's it's it makes you melt it makes you just to fade away Lord how beautiful you are Lord oh Lord let us just be able to love you more than ever before it's in times like this where we can get closer to you lord lord if we draw an eye on to you the scripture says that you'll draw an eye onto US father Lord let the love of God just be sure about in our hearts and we just thank you again for being with us for encouraging us Lord Lord we love you now we pray all this in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's just sing this song as we just invite our but the Billy to come at this time amen I play pledge allegiance to Jesus I pledge allegiance to the land I pledge that in his word I'll Stand foreign [Music] [Music] all the way oh and God I know you're true [Music] is just flesh to him Lord all the way rest until I see him shining face on that street [Music] When I Grow is first again oh and God [Music] oh and I want to do my best [Music] I'm going all the way [Music] [Music] oh all the way you know [Music] oh as I grow away [Music] away [Music] did you enjoy the word amen My Eyes giving us the material to get ready it's giving us his word whatever we have need of I like that story because that that little girl took it personal she didn't care what others were doing and it was very personal to her The Vow that she made and she purposed within herself that nothing else will matter and and that's the attitude as Christian we need to have it's not being attracted over here that that attracts you and everything it's a personal vow God I'm gonna leave your word and I'm gonna do everything I know what your word said is what I'll do I don't care if the person sitting next to me is not I will do it because it's in my heart to do man and husband and wife I will do the word and I think when we get that kind of attitude it brings us together because we have the same heartbeat we have the same desire I'll say this you know there's a lot of people that would bring you know we get into this realm of the the word where you know people are there's so much that's been said about the message and the things but I'll say this this is the only message that's promised to bring you into the rapture I I like that quote that he read because it's important you understand what the manifestation of the son of man is actually doing to us because we have all kinds of bookstores and all kinds of books out there and and there's more that's going to be written but it's the manifestation of the son of man that really brings the attraction to the bride because why the word that was promised is now being fulfilled and I like that it says it's when you take this message this word because everybody can bring on their own interpretation tell you what this means what the end of the world is going to be and all of those things and and you know what the generations we live in but there's not no one that can come and take it and prove to you by the word of God by the spirit of God this message is the very interpretation of the age by God's word what he promised it will happen in the time that we are living in and it's the only thing that will get us ready let's not look elsewhere or be confused or or get into some states where you are not sure oh this is the time to pledge this is the time to have a single heart and to have singleness of heart to say God I'll stay upon your word I will eat of it and I'll let it change me I'll let it bring about that change that I need in order to be ready for the Rapture oh that's my heart to say as I was hearing it I said God let me be ready by Your Word let me do my part so you can do your part it said when we take this reveal word of the Yahweh it will manifest the son of man again so the manifestation didn't just stop with the prophet the manifestation will follow wherever the word is being followed I like that because it's the same God it's the same word it's God fulfilling his prophecy amen oh my I just feel real good amen Amen brother Andrew if it could just come and dismiss us tonight thank you certainly enjoyed the word tonight I just want to give a quick testimony I just feel it's in line with what the heartbeat of God is tonight I had made it known about eight uh 14 months ago that my stepdad had contracted kidney failure after he got the third round of vaccines and it was looking really bad for him they didn't have much hope for him and then after some further test they found that he had a real aggressive form of leukemia and so they they had sowed a seed in his mind of well we don't know if you're going to live or not and um you know because we received this word of righteousness there's something that moved on my heart and said you know what though the doctor said that by his stripes you were healed and he began to accept a different report and over over time what has happened we went and visited him last summer and he ended up about 15 years ago giving me a vial of anointing oil where I started testifying to him over the 15 years since he gave me that oil I've went to hospitals I've fulfilled the word of God over and over and over and seen the faithful hand of God to produce a righteous act because God made the promise to us and I told him the testimony I said this is the word of God and we're going to do this because it's God's word and we're fulfilling it and we did that and now it was about three weeks ago he told me he called me said you know I'm still on dialysis but I forgot to tell you the doctor told me I'm cancer-free you know this is our God to take the word of God into our heart and let God produce our righteous action amen that's the power of this Word of Promise let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord what a what a wonderful reminder oh god of what you want to do Lord You Wanna become one with this Humanity that you paid the price Lord and Lord surely Lord you bathe this Earth with your blood Lord we know it's your spirit brooding over us Lord to Manifest this word and it's by your promises Lord that we see the fruit in our lives Lord there's nothing that we did
