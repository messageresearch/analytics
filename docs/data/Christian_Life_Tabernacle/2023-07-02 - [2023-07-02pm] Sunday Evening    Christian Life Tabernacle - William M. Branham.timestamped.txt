[45:18] control we just ask you to bless us this
[45:22] evening in our time of Fellowship in
[45:25] Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[45:28] pray
[45:29] amen
[45:31] amen if you have your Bibles let's just
[45:33] turned to a real scripture that I'm sure
[45:37] that we all know
[45:39] in the gospel of Matthew the 16th
[45:43] chapter
[45:44] and the 15th verse
[45:46] and uh we certainly enjoy that thank you
[45:50] musicians and
[45:51] singing and all those wonderful things
[45:55] it says in this scripture in the 15th
[45:58] birth and we know and he said unto them
[46:02] but whom
[46:03] say ye that I am
[46:07] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[46:10] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[46:15] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[46:18] blessed art thou Simon
[46:21] barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not
[46:24] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[46:28] which is in heaven and I say unto thee
[46:31] that thou art Peter
[46:34] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[46:37] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[46:40] Prevail against it father we ask you to
[46:42] bless your word and your precious name
[46:44] we pray amen Lord bless you
[46:47] the importance of Revelation
[46:52] our messenger told us he says I cannot
[46:55] emphasize to you enough the importance
[46:59] of Revelation
[47:01] and we notice how each of the people
[47:04] before when they asked they had filtered
[47:07] it through a lot of their own ideas one
[47:09] say you're this one say you're that he
[47:11] says but who do you say I am and then he
[47:14] filtered it through the word of God and
[47:16] he got the answer amen after this
[47:19] morning's message I thought it would be
[47:21] appropriate to play the messenger and so
[47:24] we're going to play a portion out of the
[47:27] message
[47:29] thinking man's filter
[47:31] and from paragraphs 103 through 188 and
[47:37] I just highlighted a few little
[47:38] statements I'd like to read them before
[47:41] that we hear them and then when you hear
[47:45] them again maybe they'll be a a
[47:49] twice but he makes this one statement uh
[47:53] I I thought was pretty good just to
[47:55] express back about how the thinking and
[47:58] Filter Works
[48:00] he says I come out of a meeting here
[48:02] there was a little Ricky standing back
[48:05] here behind the church one night and he
[48:08] said to me about three or four years ago
[48:11] he said the reason you say that you're
[48:14] an old man
[48:17] said I think they look nice
[48:20] and I said I can imagine that
[48:23] for just the looks of him you can tell
[48:26] what he looked like and I said tell me
[48:30] something how old are you he said I'm 30
[48:34] years old he said when I was 15 years
[48:37] younger than you I thought the same
[48:40] thing right it's and it's still felt
[48:46] a thinking man's filter notice if he had
[48:50] been his mind filtered through the word
[48:54] of God God's filter he wouldn't look
[48:57] upon her he wouldn't think she's pretty
[49:00] he'll think she's a jezebel he'll think
[49:04] behind those red lips is poison fangs
[49:08] that would sting him and the Bible said
[49:11] her Gates is the gates of the hell and a
[49:14] man that walketh in them walketh like an
[49:18] ox going to the slaughter there's a
[49:21] thinking man's filter
[49:23] amen so we certainly see these things
[49:26] I'd like to make another
[49:28] statement here
[49:31] and it's it's a paragraph of
[49:35] 109 he says a thinking man's taste when
[49:40] a thinking man hears the word of God my
[49:43] sheer sheep hear my voice a stranger
[49:47] they will not follow for down in there
[49:51] is life and life connects with life
[49:56] because we're he's going to build to
[49:59] something and he says sin connects with
[50:01] sin and sin is so hypocritical until it
[50:07] thinks that it's saved when it isn't
[50:11] saved
[50:12] and it's the very depths of hypocrisy
[50:17] church members want a denominational
[50:20] filter so that they can have their own
[50:24] desire and still be classed religious
[50:27] people you hear them say
[50:30] oh he's very religious
[50:34] amen that's this another quote here
[50:38] found on paragraph 121 he said but down
[50:43] inside of you somewhere
[50:46] here you come there was something in you
[50:49] there that began to draw
[50:52] I want us to think on this part about
[50:55] something in you drawing
[50:58] he said you didn't put that there God
[51:01] did something in in you begin to draw if
[51:06] you know it it was something that told
[51:10] you there was a god somewhere and you
[51:13] read his word then you took the church
[51:16] you took their ideas when you was told
[51:21] better you never used the think immense
[51:24] filter but when you use God's filter
[51:28] which is a thinking man's filter because
[51:32] all other filters will pass away but
[51:36] mine shall not and when you take God's
[51:39] filter you draw your life your desires
[51:42] if you draw your desires through God's
[51:45] filter a think immense filter there is
[51:49] nothing left but the holy God
[51:52] amen isn't that wonderful hey man let's
[51:57] just read another statement here
[52:00] and it says let me plant this is
[52:05] paragraph 147. let me plant the word of
[52:09] God in my heart
[52:12] and purpose there that I'll not turn to
[52:17] the right hand or to the left hand away
[52:21] from it
[52:22] but I'll live true to it all the days of
[52:26] my life and oh Father God then send down
[52:31] upon me the Holy Spirit of life to
[52:36] Quicken those words to me that I might
[52:39] manifest Jesus Christ before those who
[52:43] are before me to look for it to happen
[52:48] that's my prayer
[52:51] what a beautiful statement just Mark
[52:54] that down he says he says I said this
[52:57] this morning paragraph
[53:00] 157 or 56. I said this this morning
[53:04] we're in the seeing age
[53:06] the top
[53:08] there's no more facilities above that
[53:12] that you can move upwardly to know
[53:16] you from your nose you can smell your
[53:20] lips you can speak from your hands you
[53:24] can feel and reach and your feet and so
[53:27] forth but you can't go no further than
[53:30] your eyes Malachi 4 has come sight it
[53:37] shall be light about the evening time oh
[53:41] walk in the light
[53:45] amen amen I believe our brother alluded
[53:48] to that paragraph 163.
[53:53] he says now let us all tonight check our
[53:57] desires and then you can see what kind
[54:01] of filter you've been drawing through
[54:04] let's check each one of us
[54:07] here and out Across the Nation check
[54:11] your desires what you want really in
[54:15] life check what you're fighting for
[54:19] check what you're here for check what
[54:22] what you go to church for what makes you
[54:26] it's good to go to church but just don't
[54:29] go to church only
[54:31] that won't save you see just check just
[54:37] a few minutes say is my
[54:40] is my objective what kind of filter am I
[54:44] drawing through anyhow amen and then
[54:48] this is the statement I really want to
[54:51] emphasize as we listen to this uh for
[54:54] it's 41 minutes long I'm sure you can
[54:57] stay uh attentive for that it says this
[55:01] is paragraph one um
[55:04] 80 I believe or 181 it says the word if
[55:10] you are predestinated you see it
[55:13] there's no way to hide it from you you
[55:17] look there and say why it's just so
[55:23] plain before my face
[55:27] I look at it and there it is I'm looking
[55:33] right at it I see it here it is the word
[55:38] every word just word by word living out
[55:43] there's a a taste of eternal life that
[55:47] you want and when you breathe through
[55:50] that
[55:51] then can come through and and then can
[55:56] come through that God's filter nothing
[56:00] but the spirit no world at all no one
[56:03] belief at all it's God's filter and when
[56:07] you breathe through that nothing can get
[56:10] through that but the Holy Ghost now
[56:14] you've got the evidence of the Holy
[56:18] Ghost see a holy man or woman's taste
[56:23] they want to live they got eternal life
[56:26] and because this word is quickened to
[56:29] them they live a thinking man's filter a
[56:34] holy man's taste amen you know that's
[56:37] probably the biggest question you get
[56:39] how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost if
[56:42] there's something that draws through you
[56:45] amen because something that you just see
[56:49] it right you just can't deny it it's
[56:52] right before your face you just can't
[56:55] get away from it there it is and you
[56:58] draw that word he said that's the
[57:00] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[57:03] amen so Lord richly bless you as we
[57:06] listen to this 41 minutes I believe it's
[57:09] inspirational I believe it's just
[57:11] necessary and uh especially after what
[57:14] our brother said about saying only what
[57:17] he said I think the best way to say only
[57:19] what he said is to hear him say themself
[57:21] amen the Lord Mercy bless you as we
[57:24] listen in this portion of this message
[57:27] thinking men's filter father bless your
[57:30] word Jesus name we pray amen
[57:34] oh so now we want to look at Ephesians 5
[57:37] 26 that it is the washing of the Water
[57:40] by the word
[57:43] a Waters of separation
[57:45] what does it do then the filter of God
[57:49] is the word
[57:51] Waters of Separation washing other
[57:54] waters of Separation by the word
[57:58] God's filter then you can't come into
[58:01] Christ through a church Builder
[58:04] you cannot come by the nominational
[58:06] filter or a Creed filter there's only
[58:09] one filter that you can enter into that
[58:11] Holy place that's to the washing of the
[58:13] water follower
[58:15] the word of God is a thinking man's
[58:18] filter
[58:19] the church WIll judge you here whether
[58:21] you're a good name or not they'll give
[58:23] you a good feeling half past the flag at
[58:24] your death same great wreaths of flowers
[58:26] and do everything for you but when it
[58:29] comes down to your soul facing God it's
[58:32] got to have eternal life
[58:35] if it's an eternal life it's part of the
[58:38] word and it's my own word cannot be on
[58:41] my own hand cannot deny my hand my own
[58:43] eyes cannot deny my hand out of my foot
[58:46] or my Tor any part of me
[58:48] they cannot lie and either can a man
[58:51] that's part of the word of God or a
[58:54] woman then I have one part of the word
[58:56] of God then remember when you think you
[58:58] can have Bob Harry come in the presence
[59:00] of God you're wrong
[59:05] that's it
[59:07] you're wrong
[59:09] you can't come through God's silver
[59:11] or you're Washed by the Water of the
[59:13] word
[59:14] then you enter you to the fellowship You
[59:17] Think You Are
[59:18] but you can't be until you come through
[59:20] the word and every little spot every
[59:23] little word of God man shall not live by
[59:24] better owned by every word
[59:27] it's got to come through that filtration
[59:30] coming through and that gives a
[59:32] righteous man's taste because that's
[59:34] what he's looking for
[59:35] looking for something to cleanse him
[59:37] the word
[59:39] the word of God is a faking Man's
[59:41] children
[59:42] and it makes a righteous man's taste we
[59:45] know that truth filters all the sin of
[59:48] unbelief out
[59:50] there's a little more disbelief when he
[59:52] comes through the filter
[59:53] because it is the true believer's taste
[59:57] the True Believer wants to be right
[59:59] regardless
[1:00:02] you just don't want to stay alive on the
[1:00:04] social ranks I'll belong to church the
[1:00:05] biggest church in town I don't care if
[1:00:06] it's a mission on the corner if it's a
[1:00:09] brush Harbor somewhere a thinking man
[1:00:11] knows that he's got to meet God
[1:00:14] in regards to what the church says or
[1:00:16] anybody else says he's got to come on
[1:00:18] God's terms and God's terms is God's
[1:00:21] word
[1:00:22] well they say God's word sure I don't
[1:00:23] believe it's God's word but can you
[1:00:25] filter through it I go let a bob-headed
[1:00:27] woman come through there
[1:00:35] see it ain't a thanking man's taste
[1:00:39] no thanking me I don't think I think you
[1:00:42] now think twice before he jumps into
[1:00:43] something like that
[1:00:45] notice
[1:00:46] that word cannot deny itself
[1:00:49] then it is satisfied or it's the desire
[1:00:51] it's a desire of what
[1:00:54] what made you desire in the first place
[1:00:56] because down in your soul
[1:00:59] there was a predestinated seed
[1:01:03] which was
[1:01:04] eternal life always laying in there
[1:01:08] always was in there
[1:01:11] all that the father has given he will
[1:01:13] come to me
[1:01:15] there is an idiom going to be lost
[1:01:19] a faking man's taste
[1:01:22] when a thinking man Hears A word of God
[1:01:24] my sheep sheep hear my voice
[1:01:27] a stranger they will not follow
[1:01:29] or down in there is life
[1:01:32] and life connects with life
[1:01:35] still connects with sin and sin is so
[1:01:38] happy
[1:01:39] hypocritical
[1:01:41] until it thinks that it's saved when it
[1:01:45] is insane
[1:01:47] it's in the very depths of hypocrisy
[1:01:51] church members wanted a nomination
[1:01:53] filter so that they could have their own
[1:01:57] desire and still be class religious
[1:01:59] people you're always very religious in
[1:02:02] Africa was out there one day is talking
[1:02:05] about these some of the kids that's
[1:02:07] talking about these rock and roll songs
[1:02:09] that Elvis Presley and they were singing
[1:02:11] Pat Boone and whatever more Ricky Nelson
[1:02:14] and all them others I said there are a
[1:02:16] bunch of Renegades
[1:02:18] some little girl said well he's very
[1:02:20] religious I said so was Judas
[1:02:23] I said Judas only got 30 pieces of
[1:02:25] silver
[1:02:26] Elvis Presley got several million
[1:02:28] dollars they're both sold out their
[1:02:31] Birthright
[1:02:33] I said there's enough of the very
[1:02:35] important statement the nation's gone
[1:02:39] still
[1:02:40] just as deceiving as the filter of the
[1:02:43] cigarette these denominations that those
[1:02:45] members come in they ought to even be a
[1:02:47] lord be a law that they couldn't sing
[1:02:49] religious songs
[1:02:51] it's against or to be against the law
[1:02:53] for them to do it but the whole thing's
[1:02:55] become one great big pile of hypocrisy
[1:02:58] that's where they stay today the true
[1:03:00] film
[1:03:01] for the soul says if you love the world
[1:03:04] are the things of the world the love of
[1:03:07] God's not even in you
[1:03:09] see you can't you can't say rock and
[1:03:11] rollers of the world as of the god
[1:03:14] rock and rollers of the world any of
[1:03:16] those dances that filtered nasty filthy
[1:03:19] things rather is of the world it's all
[1:03:22] over the world
[1:03:23] you can't say that Bob's hair for a
[1:03:25] woman is a God
[1:03:27] the Bible says it's not
[1:03:29] so it's a bill to the world and if you
[1:03:31] love one Speck of the world
[1:03:34] the love of God's not even in you see
[1:03:37] what's that law what's wrong is
[1:03:38] something down on the inside drawing the
[1:03:41] soul is drawing your resource to the
[1:03:44] outside down through the spirit into the
[1:03:46] soul
[1:03:46] if the soul loves the world is dead
[1:03:50] I don't care how it's anointed it is out
[1:03:52] yet how righteous it is out here down in
[1:03:54] here it's dead
[1:03:55] or he that loves the world are the
[1:03:57] things of the world the love of God's
[1:03:59] not even any
[1:04:01] no matter how religion
[1:04:03] the true filter that we will will set
[1:04:06] all those things out and bring nothing
[1:04:08] but the trueness of God the word into
[1:04:10] the real true soul
[1:04:12] they're like Esau outwardly okay ESO was
[1:04:16] religious on the outside and when it
[1:04:18] comes to religion it seem to be more
[1:04:19] religious than Jacob was
[1:04:21] you see to be a better man than Jacob
[1:04:23] was but the inside of him
[1:04:26] what he was is outwardly religious
[1:04:30] but his thinking was not feeling
[1:04:32] he doesn't think right of the birthright
[1:04:35] he didn't think that God's a Birthright
[1:04:38] meant as much as God said it did
[1:04:46] see I'll go to church I'm just as good
[1:04:49] as you are my denomination just says
[1:04:51] what's one of the greatest in the world
[1:04:52] my mother volunteer my father brought to
[1:04:54] it all this that the other my pastor was
[1:04:56] educated he's got sourceful that
[1:04:58] touching that much farther from God
[1:05:01] that ain't no thinking means filter
[1:05:03] if it would how could Peter ever been
[1:05:06] what he was
[1:05:12] but he attacked the thinking man's
[1:05:14] filter
[1:05:16] notice
[1:05:17] all mine
[1:05:20] Esau thought that that Birch art didn't
[1:05:22] mean what God said it did that was the
[1:05:25] difference between life and death
[1:05:27] and so like Eve and like Judas sold
[1:05:31] their birthrights
[1:05:33] for a satisfaction of the taste of the
[1:05:36] knowledge of civilization that's exactly
[1:05:39] what Eve sold her birthrights for
[1:05:41] she sold it for a little taste of
[1:05:43] science
[1:05:45] a little taste of worldly knowledge
[1:05:47] a little better church a little better
[1:05:49] glass of people today it would be called
[1:05:51] see and Judas sold his birthrights for
[1:05:55] 30 pieces of silver to make a few extra
[1:05:57] dollars my congregation can pay me
[1:05:59] better over here and I'll just preach
[1:06:00] over here see sold out if I become a
[1:06:03] preacher well they said brother Graham
[1:06:04] We believe that message is the truth but
[1:06:06] we can't accept it if we did well where
[1:06:08] would we preach at
[1:06:09] the word
[1:06:10] brother that's the parish
[1:06:13] thoroughly well I'm none of the brothers
[1:06:15] in the back yeah but I'm looking for
[1:06:16] another brother to back me up I'm
[1:06:18] looking for Jesus Christ to back me up
[1:06:20] because he stood by him he's the one who
[1:06:21] said it
[1:06:23] and when the true Birthright the blood
[1:06:25] fill it out by the word all sin and the
[1:06:30] world and church and denominations and
[1:06:32] sectarianism is left outside
[1:06:35] education
[1:06:37] civilization
[1:06:38] church denomination system sin of all
[1:06:42] types is left outside when a thinking
[1:06:45] man takes a thinking man's filter and
[1:06:47] God's estimation
[1:06:48] there's nothing left in it when a man
[1:06:51] draws his wrists life to a God's filter
[1:06:56] notice here your life is all messed up
[1:06:59] as sin because you were born in sin
[1:07:01] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:07:04] speaking eyes I'm going to say something
[1:07:05] that's done McCullough used to say
[1:07:07] listen to me
[1:07:10] when you come in this world you were
[1:07:13] born in sin
[1:07:14] you didn't even come with a Fighting
[1:07:17] Chance
[1:07:19] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:07:21] come to the world speaking lives within
[1:07:24] your own spirit
[1:07:25] the desire of sin
[1:07:28] a Lover's sin because you were born in
[1:07:30] sin
[1:07:31] you didn't have a chance
[1:07:34] but down inside of you somewhere here
[1:07:37] you come
[1:07:39] there was something in there that began
[1:07:42] to draw
[1:07:43] if you know it was something that told
[1:07:45] you there was a god somewhere and he
[1:07:47] read his word and you took the church
[1:07:49] you took the ideas when you're told
[1:07:51] better
[1:07:52] then you'd ever use the thinking man's
[1:07:55] filter
[1:07:56] God's filter which is the thinking man's
[1:07:59] filter because all other filters will
[1:08:03] pop but mine shall not and when you take
[1:08:07] God's filter and draw your life
[1:08:10] your desires
[1:08:12] if you draw your desires to God's filter
[1:08:16] a thanking them filter there's nothing
[1:08:18] left but the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] now if you aren't the evidence of the
[1:08:23] Holy Ghost there it is
[1:08:25] when that Soul if you're of the line
[1:08:27] with the word of God in every respect
[1:08:30] amen shows you draw your life through
[1:08:32] the thinking man's filter God filter
[1:08:35] notice
[1:08:36] is that God's filter he said we was
[1:08:39] Washed by the Water of the word and when
[1:08:42] God gave Adam and Eve a filter in the
[1:08:44] Garden of Eden he said don't you draw
[1:08:46] now this in there
[1:08:48] but Satan punched a hole in and say oh
[1:08:50] it's a little bit won't hurt
[1:08:51] just one drop too it's all it took to
[1:08:54] step death into the human race
[1:08:56] that's all it takes just one Taste of
[1:08:58] nicotine
[1:08:59] then they're gone
[1:09:00] there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost
[1:09:02] and then that shows that in you were
[1:09:06] that predestinated seed down in you that
[1:09:09] makes you hunger for God all the father
[1:09:12] has given he has given me to redeem
[1:09:15] they died with me at Calvary the Rays of
[1:09:18] thee in the resurrection all that he has
[1:09:21] given me will come to me
[1:09:24] they'll be tracing the body where foot
[1:09:26] arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be
[1:09:28] placed in there and they will come to me
[1:09:31] in their season
[1:09:34] oh my There Is that real filtration of
[1:09:39] all the sin of the world and the love of
[1:09:41] the world is dead and the soul is
[1:09:43] drawing only one thing
[1:09:47] don't forget it oh you out there on the
[1:09:51] telephone set this down in your mind
[1:09:53] when a thinking man
[1:09:57] begins to think
[1:09:59] who he's going to stand before and what
[1:10:01] the word of God is
[1:10:04] what he begins to think then when he
[1:10:06] draws do that there's nothing can't get
[1:10:09] to it but the Holy Ghost
[1:10:11] what is it it's the germ seed word from
[1:10:15] the beginning that you was in God at the
[1:10:17] beginning studying her drawing the sea
[1:10:20] life
[1:10:22] the seed is in Your Heart by Florida
[1:10:24] Nation
[1:10:25] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] the seed is already in there by the
[1:10:31] foreknowledge of God predestinated
[1:10:34] and when it draws it can't draw through
[1:10:36] nothing else but the word
[1:10:39] and then it's the taste of the cake
[1:10:44] it's a righteous man the holy man who
[1:10:48] sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:50] same yesterday and forever what comes
[1:10:52] into that place down there that word
[1:10:54] that's in the heart of hid that word in
[1:10:56] my heart that are sitting out against
[1:10:57] thee what is it what is drawing through
[1:10:59] the word there's only one thing to pass
[1:11:02] through the word
[1:11:03] what's the Holy Ghost
[1:11:07] that's the only thing that can pass
[1:11:10] through the word is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] and a thinking man's filter is a holy
[1:11:16] man a taste
[1:11:18] then he's tasted of the Heavenly pain
[1:11:20] he's got the word of God in his heart he
[1:11:23] sees it manifested before it and his
[1:11:26] whole Souls wrapped into it and the
[1:11:28] world and all things that stand around
[1:11:32] a thinking man's filter
[1:11:34] of religion I'm thinking of filtering
[1:11:37] religion now what a thinking man's
[1:11:39] filter gives a holy man's taste
[1:11:42] I think it satisfies his taste he sees
[1:11:45] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:11:47] today and forever there it is seen right
[1:11:50] before doing the same things he did it
[1:11:53] satisfies the holy man's taste his
[1:11:56] thinking he knows then it is past and
[1:11:58] death and alive
[1:12:00] and he loves and and loves for the world
[1:12:04] to be confirmed and what's the word to
[1:12:07] be confirmed and Vindicated in each age
[1:12:10] he waits for it
[1:12:12] for he is a holy man
[1:12:14] and he's got a desire to see God others
[1:12:17] just wants to join church this man wants
[1:12:20] to see God
[1:12:21] he don't see him in a bunch of Creeds he
[1:12:24] don't see any big fine pipe organs or
[1:12:26] Cathedrals and high crosses or polished
[1:12:28] up Scholars for their Scholars turn
[1:12:30] around he doesn't see him in theology
[1:12:34] on a theologian
[1:12:35] he sees him in the confirmation of his
[1:12:38] word
[1:12:44] of the Lord is typing out the Finish
[1:12:47] where The Grapes of Wrath are stored
[1:12:48] these loose of faithful lightning with
[1:12:50] his terrible Swift sword his truth keeps
[1:12:53] marching on
[1:12:54] it will to them
[1:12:56] yes sir
[1:12:58] see what I mean a filter man a thinking
[1:13:02] man's filter a man that wants to stand
[1:13:04] in the presence of God what was God's
[1:13:06] filter his word
[1:13:09] that day you either of that day you die
[1:13:12] don't care what's happening out here
[1:13:13] don't you pass that word
[1:13:16] washed By the Waters of the word a
[1:13:19] thinking man's filter not a denomination
[1:13:21] not a Creed not a church not a cathedral
[1:13:24] but a thanking man filter for you're
[1:13:26] going to be judged by the word
[1:13:29] uh thank you man I'll think that
[1:13:33] a foolish man or a taste of the world
[1:13:35] will just take anything a substitute
[1:13:38] why substitute when there's a real one
[1:13:41] think just think of him a woman speaking
[1:13:45] in tongues
[1:13:46] with bobbed hair and lipstick on
[1:13:49] and then the church still holds to it
[1:13:52] and that's the evidence the Holy Ghost
[1:13:57] honor a preacher from a seminary or some
[1:14:00] Bible School using the trinitarian
[1:14:03] baptism
[1:14:07] or compromising with the words of some
[1:14:09] Creator denomination
[1:14:11] is that a thinking man's filter
[1:14:15] not the way I see it brother it's a
[1:14:18] foolish man going through that
[1:14:21] right could you imagine that instead of
[1:14:25] using God's word as a filter for his
[1:14:28] soul
[1:14:29] letting it all Creed and denomination
[1:14:31] piling on top of him like that instead
[1:14:33] of taking God's word for a filter
[1:14:35] and then he's all contaminated and let
[1:14:37] him induce into him doctrines of man
[1:14:40] doing things almost deceiving the very
[1:14:42] elected and neglecting the word when he
[1:14:46] could draw to his own soul if there's
[1:14:48] anything in there to draw a Bible but if
[1:14:50] that predestinated
[1:14:53] seed
[1:14:55] don't miss this if that predestinated
[1:14:58] seed is not in there it will not draw
[1:15:02] through there because it'll draw for its
[1:15:05] desire if a smoking man wants a smoky
[1:15:08] man's taste
[1:15:10] and if you've got to hold a stick I say
[1:15:12] suck your finger and he stood there
[1:15:14] stuck in his finger
[1:15:15] well he said that's silly why his taste
[1:15:19] is for nicotine
[1:15:21] so he's not a thinking man
[1:15:24] see but he said I don't I don't taste
[1:15:27] nothing and I won't taste the word I
[1:15:28] want to taste tobacco I don't taste the
[1:15:30] vein give him a toast and let him suck
[1:15:32] on that
[1:15:34] sure they suck on that he said I don't
[1:15:37] taste nothing what you sucking on it for
[1:15:38] then
[1:15:39] you've got to desire to taste nicotine
[1:15:42] and when you're sucking on a church
[1:15:44] Creed
[1:15:46] and still you women wear bobbed hair
[1:15:48] painted faces and this sexy dress and
[1:15:51] you man look at them and all these other
[1:15:52] things to carry on the way you do what
[1:15:54] is it what's in there the world's still
[1:15:57] in there
[1:15:58] and you're gonna taste
[1:16:00] you're pulling on it for a taste I go to
[1:16:03] this church you don't ever name that
[1:16:04] thing you don't say nothing about this
[1:16:05] nothing about that now these things are
[1:16:07] brought up our preacher's more
[1:16:08] wide-minded than that we don't say
[1:16:10] things like that what is it you've got
[1:16:12] the taste of the world you're sucking
[1:16:14] for
[1:16:16] eign
[1:16:24] and the only thing that you can draw
[1:16:26] through God's word is the spirit the
[1:16:29] quickening power to make the word itself
[1:16:32] which is in you live to manifest Jesus
[1:16:35] Christ in the age you're living
[1:16:38] oh
[1:16:39] my god brother
[1:16:41] if that ain't the truth I don't know
[1:16:43] what the truth is
[1:16:44] I've lost my mind if that isn't the
[1:16:47] truth
[1:16:48] it is the word itself
[1:16:51] in your heart
[1:16:53] prejestinated there
[1:16:55] that's drawing and it spits out that
[1:16:58] word that don't want it but when it gets
[1:17:00] over here in the world it begins to
[1:17:03] crawl and when it draws to the word it
[1:17:07] can be nothing else
[1:17:13] then a thinking religious man's filter
[1:17:17] is a word and it satisfies that Holy
[1:17:22] case that's in his heart
[1:17:24] a thinking man's filter
[1:17:26] a holy man's taste oh man
[1:17:31] what we're into
[1:17:33] instead of using God's filter for his
[1:17:35] soul he's letting Satan deceive him
[1:17:38] but some denominational Creed just as
[1:17:41] Zachary the tobacco companies are
[1:17:43] deceiving you people smoke cigarettes
[1:17:45] you just get more members and that's all
[1:17:48] or let me close in a few minutes saying
[1:17:51] this
[1:17:55] how blind can we get
[1:18:02] the leading the blind at this age
[1:18:05] under false pretense
[1:18:08] under false Creeds under Douglas's pulse
[1:18:13] under denominations false
[1:18:16] under Creed books is false
[1:18:19] oh blind ledorcia leading the ground
[1:18:23] you're all headed for the ditch change
[1:18:26] your filter tonight preacher
[1:18:30] don't draw that denominational nicotine
[1:18:33] into your system up dogmas it creates
[1:18:36] which Jesus said whosoever shall add one
[1:18:38] word to it or take one word from it
[1:18:40] when you tell your congregations right
[1:18:42] then women to do that those men did it
[1:18:44] and all these things that and the other
[1:18:46] as long as they stay true to this and do
[1:18:48] that and keep these Creeds and things
[1:18:49] aren't you ashamed of yourself
[1:18:53] blind Pharisees Jesus said
[1:18:56] Jesus cried blind Pharisees the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit my own hearts and I cross
[1:19:03] how else God would it give you a Revival
[1:19:06] but now your time has come
[1:19:09] it's too late now
[1:19:11] how did you laugh and make fun of the
[1:19:14] people that God sent to you
[1:19:17] but now your time has come oh United
[1:19:20] States United States
[1:19:23] how the God would have hovered you as a
[1:19:26] brew Henderson's brood but you would not
[1:19:29] now this voice is going from coast to
[1:19:31] coast from north to south and east to
[1:19:34] west how God would have hovered you but
[1:19:37] you were not
[1:19:39] now your time has come
[1:19:42] nations are breaking
[1:19:44] the world is falling apart fifteen
[1:19:47] hundred mile chunk of it three or four
[1:19:49] hundred miles wide or Saint hundred or
[1:19:52] maybe 40 miles down into that great fall
[1:19:55] out the under one of these days and ways
[1:19:57] will shoot plan out to the state of
[1:19:59] Kentucky
[1:20:00] and what it does it'll shake the world
[1:20:02] so hard that everything on top of it
[1:20:04] will shake down
[1:20:05] oh I mean a Rock of Ages God let me let
[1:20:10] me breathe upon me Lord spirit all the
[1:20:13] Living God Breathe on Me Let Me Take
[1:20:16] God's filter and live under that Lord
[1:20:18] let me breathe the fresh air of the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost into my lungs and my soul each day
[1:20:23] that I sin not against You O Lord
[1:20:26] Breathe on Me Holy Spirit breathe on me
[1:20:28] oh let me plant the word of God in my
[1:20:31] heart and purpose there that I'll not
[1:20:33] turn to the right hand or to the left
[1:20:35] hand away from it or I'll live true to
[1:20:37] it all the days of my life oh Father God
[1:20:39] then sent down upon me the Holy Spirit
[1:20:42] of life to Quicken those words to me
[1:20:44] that I might manifest Jesus Christ
[1:20:46] before those who are before me to
[1:20:49] looking for it to happen that's my
[1:20:52] prayer
[1:20:53] oh man
[1:20:55] knows how they do today in those
[1:20:57] churches sucking their people to those
[1:20:59] denominational pillars Into The
[1:21:01] ecumenical council
[1:21:03] why why for it gives them the desire of
[1:21:07] their heart organization
[1:21:09] they have a taste for organization
[1:21:13] they'll do it every time God sent him a
[1:21:15] Revival therefore they do they organize
[1:21:17] it is that right
[1:21:19] so they got their kind of filter because
[1:21:22] they've got a great taste and now God's
[1:21:24] going to give them their desire of their
[1:21:26] taste he's going to give them they're
[1:21:28] sucking them right into the ecumenical
[1:21:30] council
[1:21:31] and then they get the organizational
[1:21:33] taste there
[1:21:34] they got it coming
[1:21:37] old church of lady acia don't be
[1:21:39] deceived in this age by their deceptions
[1:21:42] all painted calls you've gone into Lydia
[1:21:48] you were part of legosia
[1:21:51] the church dead through Methodist
[1:21:54] Baptist and Presbyterian just a
[1:21:56] ritualistic form but you're Pentecostals
[1:21:58] who could still once in a while Say Amen
[1:22:01] who can pull a lot of music up on a
[1:22:03] platform and have Bob had women dancing
[1:22:06] all the place
[1:22:08] I still do believe in Divine Healing how
[1:22:11] off God would have took you
[1:22:15] but you took another filter
[1:22:18] a denominational filter
[1:22:20] how off God would have took you
[1:22:24] how deceiving it was Matthew 24 24 Jesus
[1:22:28] said that the it would deceive the very
[1:22:30] elected if it was possible how close did
[1:22:33] you are it looks like Eve just leaving
[1:22:35] off one or two little things that you
[1:22:37] couldn't receive because you're
[1:22:39] organized and can't receive it
[1:22:42] that's all it takes this might as well
[1:22:43] take the whole thing
[1:22:45] or to offend in the Middle East is
[1:22:46] guilty of a whole
[1:22:48] oh
[1:22:51] did it costs Pentecost
[1:22:54] pass thou thinking to God's filter
[1:22:58] not your denominational dreams
[1:23:01] and you will come out with a holy man's
[1:23:03] taste the true baptism of the Holy
[1:23:06] Spirit

[1:23:10] a man letting his wife cut her hair wear
[1:23:13] shorts or wear slacks
[1:23:17] and say he's coming through a thinking
[1:23:19] man's filter
[1:23:21] could you imagine a man doing a thing
[1:23:24] like that can you imagine a preacher
[1:23:26] standing In a Pulpit because he's paid
[1:23:28] good by our congregation and a peps him
[1:23:30] on the back calls him Dr brother
[1:23:32] Reverend takes him out to all kinds of
[1:23:34] parties where you mix bathing and
[1:23:35] everything else on the beaches
[1:23:38] could you imagine a man claiming he's
[1:23:41] coming to a thinking man's filter
[1:23:45] and some of those women on a platform
[1:23:47] with their dresses above their knees and
[1:23:49] cuts the Titan shows every Farm every
[1:23:52] move they make in their underneath
[1:23:53] clothes showing through their dresses

[1:25:27] I stand between the living and the dead
[1:25:30] and realize what I'm seeing before you
[1:25:33] enter out and know that your body is a
[1:25:35] sacred order a sacred task that God has
[1:25:39] given you
[1:25:40] before you enter the street dress like
[1:25:43] that pass your mind through a thinking
[1:25:45] woman's filter
[1:25:47] and let it remember that whosoever looks
[1:25:49] upon you tell us that you you have
[1:25:51] committed adultery with him already
[1:25:56] remember that sister and brother before
[1:25:59] you turn your head to look at her on
[1:26:01] that Second Glance
[1:26:03] pass your mind through a thinking man's
[1:26:05] filter
[1:26:07] you'll come out with a holy man's taste
[1:26:10] of doing what's wrong
[1:26:12] notice
[1:26:14] if you pass your mind through a thinking
[1:26:17] woman's filter you'll come out with a
[1:26:19] holy woman's dress
[1:26:21] that's right
[1:26:23] you'll come out brother with a holy
[1:26:25] man's look now that's just one thing
[1:26:27] everything that you do pass it through
[1:26:28] the filter of God's word see if it's
[1:26:30] right or wrong
[1:26:32] you'll come out with a holy woman's
[1:26:33] dress with long hair decently dressed or
[1:26:37] quite humble Spirit not up brawling and
[1:26:40] fighting the carnal a quiet meat Spirit
[1:26:43] which is a great treasure from God
[1:26:48] the Bible said so
[1:26:50] now I want to ask you something out in
[1:26:52] the lands or close a few minutes now let
[1:26:55] us all tonight check our desires and
[1:26:59] then you can see what kind of a filter
[1:27:02] you've been drawing through
[1:27:05] let's check each one of us here and out
[1:27:08] Across the Nation check your desires
[1:27:10] what you want really in life
[1:27:12] check what you're fighting for check
[1:27:15] what you're here for check what you go
[1:27:17] to church Barn
[1:27:18] what makes you it was good to go to
[1:27:19] church but just don't go to church only
[1:27:21] that won't save you okay this check just
[1:27:24] a few minutes say is my objective what
[1:27:27] what kind of filter am I drawing to
[1:27:29] anyhow
[1:27:30] and if you all cope with the word of God
[1:27:32] and your soul don't do it then there's
[1:27:34] something wrong
[1:27:36] for it shows up your taste that's a lie
[1:27:40] what kind of a life is in you if it's a
[1:27:43] holy discreet honorable it'll come out
[1:27:45] that way if it isn't you've got another
[1:27:48] taste in you you're drawing from the
[1:27:50] Zachariah
[1:27:52] if the taste is the word of God in the
[1:27:54] will of God then you know what's in you
[1:27:57] what's drawing The Taste shows you are a
[1:28:00] part of that word that word is in you
[1:28:03] drawing from the word what's the drawing
[1:28:05] it's drawing to the word because you are
[1:28:08] a part of the body of Christ of this age
[1:28:11] and if that word is in you it can only
[1:28:14] draw through the word the spirit that
[1:28:16] quickens that word that's in you
[1:28:19] this the word alone won't live that's
[1:28:22] the reason
[1:28:23] all the father has given me will come to
[1:28:26] me and if I be lifted up I'll draw all
[1:28:29] man unto me
[1:28:30] see see
[1:28:31] the Father the part of the body of
[1:28:34] Christ that's in the world predestinated
[1:28:36] put it into the hearts any man that's a
[1:28:38] real Christian born again it ain't no
[1:28:40] sense he was a little kid a little girl
[1:28:42] either that there is something in you
[1:28:45] that hungered for God
[1:28:47] and you tried joining churches and
[1:28:48] everything else it wouldn't work why was
[1:28:50] it it was that word
[1:28:52] you was hunting for a filter
[1:28:55] and one day it passed before you you
[1:28:57] seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:28:59] forever that satisfied the taste so life
[1:29:04] was in you drawing see the life in you
[1:29:06] strong yes tell what does all you got
[1:29:08] here you're you're pulling you can't
[1:29:10] pull through this or that and the other
[1:29:11] you've got to find that right killer
[1:29:13] cause you're a thinking person
[1:29:15] if you're a thinking person you are
[1:29:18] predestinated or filtered for from the
[1:29:21] for the foundation of the world and if a
[1:29:24] denominational Minister hears this
[1:29:28] I hope that he takes the thinking man's
[1:29:32] filter
[1:29:33] if he's a denomination minister
[1:29:36] then he'll throw down that
[1:29:37] denominational Pact
[1:29:39] that's sure to perish
[1:29:41] because it's a word of man and except
[1:29:44] God's filtered word that can never fail
[1:29:47] or pass away and it will suit the holy
[1:29:51] man's taste
[1:29:52] and like Jacob will sacrifice all the
[1:29:55] world and the appetites of ever
[1:29:58] denomination or fame that there is in
[1:30:00] the world where you can be Bishop
[1:30:02] Cardinal or you could be a state
[1:30:03] prisoner or a pastor of some great
[1:30:05] church you'll sacrifice everything that
[1:30:08] there is not like Esau to become part of
[1:30:10] the world but like Jacob
[1:30:13] you'll give everything you've got to
[1:30:15] obtain the birthright the filtered
[1:30:19] of the thinking man calls it'll give you
[1:30:22] the holy man's taste and it will satisfy
[1:30:27] and to be satisfying we'll sanctify with
[1:30:30] the Eternal Taste of the Holy goodness
[1:30:33] of God remember Satan punched the first
[1:30:36] hole through ease mind
[1:30:39] or her thinking to let the taste of his
[1:30:42] wisdom and knowledge get through
[1:30:44] now think of this I'm closing Satan
[1:30:47] punched the first hole through
[1:30:49] because all she could draw was the word
[1:30:52] that was a spirit through the word of
[1:30:55] God because she said as long as you
[1:30:56] breathe through this filter you'll never
[1:30:59] die but you take a breath of this I hear
[1:31:02] it you'll die
[1:31:03] see and Satan said but you don't know
[1:31:05] nothing here
[1:31:07] but you take a little taste of this year
[1:31:09] and then you'll know you'll be like God
[1:31:11] see he knows right wrong you don't and
[1:31:13] if you just take a little taste of this
[1:31:15] and she let him punch a hole in it
[1:31:18] just one little hole
[1:31:22] now you see why I say why don't you
[1:31:25] teach women and so forth how to receive
[1:31:27] gifts and things like that I said how
[1:31:29] can you teach him algebra when they
[1:31:30] won't even learn their ABCs
[1:31:33] one little hole all the time he took the
[1:31:38] world's wisdom and when it did it set
[1:31:41] death to the whole family wanting to
[1:31:43] taste of wisdom now look at the filter
[1:31:46] and certainly
[1:31:48] it expressed her taste her taste was for
[1:31:52] the world that's what she's got that's
[1:31:54] what it is today they loved the world
[1:31:56] and the things of the world was a form
[1:31:58] of godliness but denying the power there
[1:32:01] see Satan speak of tongues he let him
[1:32:03] shout he'll have had Divine Healing
[1:32:05] service he led you all these kind of
[1:32:06] things they say many will come to me
[1:32:08] that day Lord and our cast out Devils
[1:32:10] have not done many things done this you
[1:32:12] say I didn't even know you you worker of
[1:32:15] iniquity when the word was placed right
[1:32:17] before you and you still sucked that old
[1:32:19] filter out of the world
[1:32:22] they chose a taste that was in the heart
[1:32:25] doves cannot eat a Karen
[1:32:28] they cannot eat it they don't have any
[1:32:31] gall
[1:32:33] a crow can eat the seed like a dove and
[1:32:36] he can either carrying like a crow
[1:32:38] see because he's a hypocrite but a dove
[1:32:41] is not built like
[1:32:44] any other Bird that's why God represents
[1:32:47] himself as a dove descending from Heaven
[1:32:49] see it cannot it cannot stand to stink
[1:32:53] of a Karen
[1:32:55] it's not a vulture the reason they don't
[1:32:57] have any Gall it couldn't digest it
[1:33:00] would kill it if it eat it
[1:33:02] and a dove never has to take a bath
[1:33:06] a Dove's body puts out oil from the
[1:33:09] inside that keeps it clean
[1:33:12] It's A Life That's ended up
[1:33:15] it generates in it or oil that keeps the
[1:33:18] feathers clean and so is a Christian
[1:33:20] there's a life within them
[1:33:23] that keeps them clean
[1:33:27] it's filtered
[1:33:31] oh notice now look
[1:33:35] at either at the filter and certainly
[1:33:38] you can see the taste thereof of what
[1:33:41] they're doing today look at this modern
[1:33:42] Church look at the filter you see what
[1:33:45] they love
[1:33:52] which is headed for God's judgment
[1:33:55] that's right the love the church
[1:33:57] throughout today is for radio Sia a
[1:34:00] great organization a great setup a great
[1:34:03] proper thing foreign dress people highly
[1:34:05] cultured full of wisdom full of devil
[1:34:08] under the deceit of the Church of Christ
[1:34:12] there's only one word ought to be in
[1:34:14] their Antichrist
[1:34:16] or everything you Christ talk they're
[1:34:18] against practically everything just
[1:34:20] enough so they can call themselves that
[1:34:22] now if you are a thinking people tonight
[1:34:25] here in out in the land where the
[1:34:28] message is going
[1:34:29] your desire will be a Bible taste not a
[1:34:34] denominational taste or you will be
[1:34:37] judged by the very Bible the word that
[1:34:40] I'm asking you to filter your soul
[1:34:42] through
[1:34:43] and to reject one word of it and not let
[1:34:47] your soul pass through that one word
[1:34:49] you'll be turned down
[1:34:51] for a man shall not live
[1:34:54] breathe by our bread alone but by every
[1:34:58] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:35:01] God it will be brought into you
[1:35:03] predestinated and when the Lord breathes
[1:35:06] upon you his spirit will Quicken that
[1:35:08] word to a reality and you'll see that
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:35:12] and forever
[1:35:13] oh man leave the world's denomination
[1:35:16] religious pact let it lay look at
[1:35:19] cigarette pack in the woods
[1:35:21] let it rot in the key
[1:35:26] it's it's a wrong filter and take the
[1:35:29] word which is Christ that gives and
[1:35:32] reaches and preserves
[1:35:36] the taste of
[1:35:38] eternal life to everyone that will take
[1:35:40] it
[1:35:43] eternal life the word if you're
[1:35:45] predestinated you sit
[1:35:47] there's no way to hide it from you you
[1:35:50] look there and say watch this playing
[1:35:51] before my face I look at it there it is
[1:35:53] I'm looking right at it I see it here it
[1:35:55] is the word every word just word by word
[1:35:57] living out then there's a taste of
[1:36:00] eternal life
[1:36:01] that you want and when you breathe
[1:36:04] through that what can come through that
[1:36:05] God's filter nothing but the spirit
[1:36:11] at all
[1:36:13] it's God's filter
[1:36:15] and when you breathe through that
[1:36:17] nothing can get through that but the
[1:36:19] Holy Ghost
[1:36:21] now you got the evidence of the Holy
[1:36:23] Ghost
[1:36:24] see they are holy man or woman's taste
[1:36:28] they want to live they got eternal life
[1:36:30] and because this word's quickened to
[1:36:32] them they live
[1:36:34] are thinking man's filter
[1:36:37] and a holy man's taste
[1:36:41] don't take the world like them cigarette
[1:36:44] companies under a deception but take the
[1:36:46] real thinking man's filter filter the
[1:36:50] breath that you breathe the food that
[1:36:52] you eat everything that you are breathe
[1:36:55] it through God's word
[1:36:58] and you'll have a holy man's taste for
[1:37:01] it will produce that for he's the same
[1:37:03] yesterday today and forever and I know
[1:37:06] whether we are whether we are not I
[1:37:09] believe that we are but if we are not
[1:37:11] there's somebody in the world the day
[1:37:14] that's part of the body of Christ
[1:37:17] and it will live only by the word of God
[1:37:21] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:37:23] mouth of God for this age that we're
[1:37:24] living in now
[1:37:27] and I can't see where denomination of
[1:37:29] those words so plainly in the Bible say
[1:37:31] it would happen and the things that
[1:37:32] would be in here we are living right in
[1:37:34] it now I can't see where it could be
[1:37:36] anything else it is church I realize
[1:37:38] I've got to stand with you in the
[1:37:39] Judgment someday
[1:37:41] or be it for me never tell you anything
[1:37:43] wrong for popularity I don't want that
[1:37:46] if I had my desire I'd just my human
[1:37:49] desire to take my rifle and go to the
[1:37:50] woods and build me a cabin and trap the
[1:37:52] rest of my life I'm getting old tired
[1:37:54] weary and broke down
[1:37:56] but I can't quit there's something in me
[1:38:00] grinding whoa unto me if I don't tell
[1:38:03] the truth and the whole truth wow to me
[1:38:05] if I don't stand here for the last
[1:38:07] breath of bodies left me I must have
[1:38:10] regardless of what anyone else says I'm
[1:38:12] responsible for God and I truly believe
[1:38:15] that the things that we're preaching is
[1:38:17] the truth not because it's me preaching
[1:38:19] it no my brother no sir God knows my
[1:38:22] heart I would like to sit out in the
[1:38:24] congregation and listen to the anointed
[1:38:26] priest how much easier it would be on me
[1:38:28] certainly because I'd have eternal life
[1:38:30] is seen as the man in the pulpit I'm a
[1:38:32] part of it is same as he is I go with
[1:38:34] the same heaven have the same privileges
[1:38:36] how easy it would be for me to sit out
[1:38:37] there and not take all these bruises and
[1:38:39] beats and carry on how easy it would be
[1:38:42] throughout the all night with no sleep
[1:38:44] an hour and a half or two hours
[1:38:45] wrestling all night with things that's
[1:38:47] coming how easy for me to do that take
[1:38:50] up my gun the next morning my fishing
[1:38:51] rod and go fishing or honey how easy
[1:38:53] would be
[1:38:54] brother it fell my lot
[1:38:58] God help me to never shun my post to
[1:39:00] duty but to stand loyal and true and
[1:39:03] produce to you a thinking man's filter
[1:39:06] that'll give you a holy man's taste the
[1:39:08] thinking man filler is the waters other
[1:39:11] waters of Separation it's the
[1:39:12] purification from sin which is the word
[1:39:15] of God
[1:39:17] and the thinking man the man that always
[1:39:19] has got to stand before God knows he's
[1:39:21] got to answer for every word of the
[1:39:23] Bible it'll satisfy that taste that's in
[1:39:26] your heart may God help us to receive it
[1:39:28] as we bow our hands
[1:39:31] and
[1:39:35] that wonderful
[1:39:37] amen I I hope it does cause us to think
[1:39:41] you know so many things brother random
[1:39:44] said in there you know and there's
[1:39:47] little nuggets and little things like
[1:39:50] you know he said a woman not having her
[1:39:53] knees covered when she you know sitting
[1:39:58] here your knees should be covered
[1:40:00] standing and sitting
[1:40:02] they just slowly washed away all those
[1:40:05] things
[1:40:05] clothes so tight you can see the
[1:40:08] underneath garments all those things
[1:40:10] just they just drop them and drop them
[1:40:13] and drop them and drop them and drop
[1:40:14] them
[1:40:16] but yet every single one of them is
[1:40:18] important all the word of God's
[1:40:20] important so I really trust in and hope
[1:40:24] it's a blessing I love the prophet of
[1:40:26] God how he made his commitment he said
[1:40:29] be easier not to be here
[1:40:31] and that's true after my little dinky
[1:40:35] part of it just think he's talking to a
[1:40:38] whole world
[1:40:39] you know I've got people that believe
[1:40:41] the message he was just bringing it for
[1:40:44] the first time what a soldier what a
[1:40:47] courageous man what a true lover of
[1:40:51] God's word I just really think it's
[1:40:54] wonderful amen I think our pool's ready

[1:51:12] and said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:51:15] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:51:19] do
[1:51:19] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:51:24] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:51:27] Jesus Christ
[1:51:29] for the remission of sins and we shall
[1:51:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost

[1:51:51] his daughter saying save yourselves from
[1:51:55] this up towards generation
[1:51:57] and they that gladly received his word
[1:52:00] were baptized and the same day there
[1:52:03] were added unto them about three
[1:52:05] thousand Souls and they continued
[1:52:08] steadfast in the apostles Doctrine and
