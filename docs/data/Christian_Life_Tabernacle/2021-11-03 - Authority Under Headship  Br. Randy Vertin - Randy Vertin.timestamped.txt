[22:45] expectation
[22:46] uh i know the lord's moving

[22:55] a greater realization of
[22:58] of
[22:59] his very presence and
[23:01] our desire to be more christ-like

[23:07] once again it's on my heart that
[23:11] if anybody would have a burden
[23:14] uh to help us with our sunday school age
[23:18] uh children uh i think we're like from
[23:21] five to twelve to maybe plan some events
[23:24] or some get-togethers or some things
[23:27] that we can do for them we've had to
[23:30] kind of give up
[23:31] our sunday school area
[23:34] because of our services so
[23:37] uh if you could uh pray for that
[23:40] that would be wonderful
[23:42] also uh there is a bin
[23:45] in the fellowship room or the back room
[23:48] there
[23:49] for donations for our homeless brothers
[23:51] and sisters
[23:53] and we need coats and jackets
[23:56] blankets skirt scarfs gloves mittens and
[24:00] socks
[24:01] are needed and you can place them back
[24:05] there in the back if you have other
[24:07] items you can contact
[24:09] joseph gordon and cosmine
[24:12] and brother chris harris and
[24:15] and they'd be happy to help you with any
[24:18] of those items that
[24:20] you need so if you have some extra coats
[24:23] and clothes and stuff it's starting to
[24:25] get cold
[24:26] and so we certainly uh
[24:29] want to reach out to them you know
[24:31] they're all part of our family
[24:33] right there maybe that last seed might
[24:35] be out there
[24:36] how much would you rejoice if you found
[24:39] the person that was going to cause the
[24:41] rapture
[24:45] amen i'd be excited
[24:47] all right we'd also like to uh
[24:50] i told uh

[29:30] barbecue please see sister leslie i
[29:32] think we do beans and corn or any other
[29:35] imaginary items that you would like to
[29:39] put together so that those are our
[29:42] announcements our meetings
[29:44] uh uh
[29:46] somebody pray and see if the lord would
[29:48] raise somebody up in our midst that has
[29:50] a burden for
[29:52] our young children and see if we can try
[29:55] to get something uh going
[29:58] uh during at least this school year to
[30:00] offset
[30:02] uh some of the things that are going on
[30:04] and then
[30:06] also our donations for the homeless also
[30:09] if there's any maintenance items that
[30:11] you notice in church
[30:13] uh something that's broken somewhere or
[30:16] that you know needs uh
[30:19] you know needs to be fixed
[30:21] maybe the pew is falling apart where
[30:23] you're sitting or something if you would
[30:26] let brother matt thomas sack and brother
[30:29] troy mackey know or any one of the
[30:32] deacons we will try to get
[30:34] any maintenance items fixed that you
[30:37] might
[30:38] come up with so we hope there's not any
[30:41] questions uh this year uh we we don't
[30:45] really
[30:46] uh send out a lot of announcements to
[30:48] other churches
[30:51] of course we
[30:53] you know we don't really
[30:56] have the facilities of course i know
[30:58] that
[30:59] brother jackson could put 500 people in
[31:02] this
[31:03] building here so
[31:06] but
[31:07] i'd like to see this year to see have
[31:09] more of our friends and relatives
[31:13] and
[31:13] people from our community
[31:16] come
[31:17] so if you have somebody that's been on
[31:19] your heart and you'd like to invite him
[31:21] to church
[31:22] i know certain people will come from
[31:24] from the outside for
[31:27] various different reasons but uh
[31:30] and then some of them in coming for
[31:32] years but let's just maybe extend a
[31:35] special invitation out to someone like
[31:38] you'd like to have come
[31:39] and fellowship and
[31:41] maybe we could just uh
[31:43] extend some fellowship right in our own
[31:45] community
[31:47] in our own
[31:48] neighborhoods and so
[31:51] we're just
[31:52] [Music]
[31:53] hoping that
[31:55] we can just invite people
[31:58] to come in i'd love to have a
[32:01] maybe someone that's away from the lord
[32:03] come in
[32:04] and the presence of the lord deal with
[32:05] their heart wouldn't that be wonderful
[32:08] and i believe god can still do it
[32:11] in fact i believe that
[32:13] the scripture says he's compelled at the
[32:15] end to go into the highways and byways
[32:18] and bring them in and he knows the hours
[32:22] at hand
[32:23] so i believe there's going to be a
[32:25] special grace
[32:26] and a special mercy to get out and
[32:29] bestowed upon them because all that the
[32:31] father hath did to me
[32:33] will come so those are our announcements
[32:36] if you have any questions
[32:40] ask
[32:41] somebody that listened
[32:43] and uh
[32:44] they will certainly
[32:46] uh
[32:48] let you know what's going on
[32:50] so
[32:51] let's just i will remind you several
[32:53] other times in the near future but are
[32:56] you excited for the word
[32:58] aren't you glad in this hour you know
[33:01] the truth
[33:02] and you know the lord
[33:04] oh what more could you have than to know
[33:07] that nothing can pluck you out of the
[33:09] palm of his hand and you're secure in
[33:12] him so let's stand together this evening
[33:15] as
[33:16] we invite brother randy i don't know if
[33:18] he'll sing a song for us tonight or not
[33:21] it's up what's ever upon his heart to do
[33:24] but let's sing amazing grace how sweet
[33:27] the sound as we

[35:29] [Music]
[35:45] through many dangers
[35:48] through

[36:33] amen let's just power heads in a word of
[36:35] prayer
[36:35] [Music]
[36:37] heavenly father lord jesus lord today
[36:40] we're still relying upon that same
[36:42] amazing grace oh god
[36:44] [Music]
[36:46] lord i believe it was
[36:49] your prophet paul who said
[36:51] if we started by this grace were he made
[36:53] perfect by the law or by the flesh
[36:56] lord we can answer an emphatic no to
[36:58] that god we're still relying lord jesus
[37:00] upon your grace this evening lord
[37:04] lord and even as i was thinking earlier
[37:06] today
[37:08] lord how we make so many mistakes and we
[37:10] stumble and we fall
[37:12] but oh god if that same grace could
[37:16] that same blood could wipe away a
[37:17] lifetime of
[37:19] sin and trespasses in just a moment
[37:22] how much more was is that grace still
[37:24] available oh god to your children lord
[37:27] who believe this evening oh god
[37:30] lord for our mistakes that we make every
[37:32] single day oh god that grace is still
[37:34] available that blood is still available
[37:36] lord we even had a prophet lord that you
[37:39] showed how you just reach into your side
[37:41] and write part and over all those things
[37:43] that we do every single day that would
[37:44] be wrong
[37:46] lord we're relying upon that grace once
[37:48] again oh god this evening
[37:50] lord may that amazing grace just cover
[37:52] us oh god right now
[37:54] lord that you'd look down upon us
[37:56] through the shed blood of your son the
[37:58] lord jesus
[37:59] and see pure
[38:00] spotless white
[38:02] oh god because we're covered in that
[38:04] blood oh god
[38:06] lord we love you we just praise your
[38:08] holy name lord this evening
[38:10] lord as we come to hear from you oh god
[38:12] lord it wouldn't be any benefit lord for
[38:14] me to preach my own thoughts or my own
[38:16] ideas oh god lord no
[38:19] no doubt a man could tickle the ears oh
[38:21] lord but
[38:22] lord only the the pure unadulterated
[38:25] word of god can transform a heart
[38:28] we're just asking once again oh god
[38:30] you'd reach down by your mighty hand and
[38:32] lord
[38:33] massage our hearts with the oil of your
[38:35] spirit o god and soften us to you lord
[38:38] jesus
[38:39] lord of the bernies stoniness lord any
[38:41] hardness in our hearts may your oil lord
[38:44] god of the holy spirit just come down
[38:46] and soften us now break up the fallow
[38:48] ground lord jesus
[38:50] let your perfect will be done lord and
[38:52] your people we just surrender ourselves
[38:54] to the hand of the potter lord upon the
[38:56] wheel in the name of the lord jesus
[38:58] christ we pray
[38:59] amen
[39:01] amen let's just open our bibles to a
[39:04] couple of scriptures here
[39:06] uh we would just want to maybe
[39:08] finish up what we ministered
[39:10] before
[39:12] a few weeks ago here
[39:15] we're going to turn to the book of
[39:17] matthew chapter 8
[39:19] read a few scriptures here
[39:22] and then we'll go
[39:26] also back to the book of genesis chapter
[39:29] 3 just keep that in mind
[39:31] um
[39:32] how many of you love the lord jesus
[39:36] his mercies endure forever they're
[39:38] renewed every morning
[39:40] we thank the lord for his grace
[39:43] it's grace that we started out with and
[39:45] it's grace that we're leaving here with
[39:47] because if we think we're gonna
[39:49] fulfill it in our own flesh then we're
[39:51] we're sorely mistaken
[39:54] and i thank the lord for a message that
[39:57] that proves that
[39:58] and for even the life of a prophet that
[40:00] we saw in this day he was who was brave
[40:03] enough
[40:03] to to share his faults and his
[40:05] shortcomings
[40:07] and yet lived a life that proved that
[40:09] the grace of god was enough
[40:11] because he was
[40:12] he was just a man
[40:14] but he was a man that was just crazy
[40:16] enough to believe in an overcoming grace
[40:19] to cover all of his faults
[40:22] and if the lord could do that for him
[40:23] i'm believing that for myself and for
[40:24] each every one of us
[40:26] so matthew 8 and we've read verses 5
[40:28] through 10
[40:31] says when jesus was entered into
[40:34] capernaum there came unto him a
[40:36] centurion beseeching him
[40:38] and saying lord my servant lieth at home
[40:41] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[40:44] and jesus saith unto him i will come and
[40:46] heal him the centurion answered and said
[40:49] lord i am not worthy that thou should
[40:51] has come under my roof
[40:53] but speak the word only and my servant
[40:55] shall be healed
[40:57] for i am a man under authority having
[40:59] soldiers under me
[41:00] and i say to this man go and he goeth
[41:03] and to another come and he cometh and to
[41:05] my servant do this and he doeth it
[41:08] when jesus heard it he marveled
[41:10] and sent it to them that followed verily
[41:12] i say unto you i have not found so great
[41:15] faith no
[41:16] not in israel
[41:18] and then let's turn to the book of
[41:20] genesis
[41:24] chapter 3.
[41:31] and we'll just read a couple scriptures
[41:32] starting at verse 1.
[41:37] it says now the serpent was more subtle
[41:39] than any beast of the field which the
[41:41] lord god had made and he said unto the
[41:44] woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat
[41:46] of every tree of the garden and the
[41:48] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[41:50] of the truth of the trees of the garden
[41:52] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[41:54] the midst of the garden god that said
[41:55] you shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[41:57] touch it lest ye die
[41:59] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[42:00] shall not surely die
[42:02] for god doth know that in the day you
[42:04] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[42:06] opened and ye shall be as gods knowing
[42:07] good and evil
[42:09] amen let's just bow our heads in one
[42:11] more quick word of prayer heavenly
[42:12] father we just pray that you would bless
[42:13] your word
[42:15] father this evening
[42:16] lord your scripture said that faith
[42:18] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[42:20] word of god
[42:21] lord we just ask oh god that we would
[42:23] just come in faith and expectation lord
[42:26] knowing
[42:27] lord that your word can never fail and
[42:29] you said that he that hungereth and
[42:31] thirth after righteousness they shall be
[42:33] filled lord we've come hungering and
[42:35] thirsting after you this evening lord
[42:37] lord may you just feed your children
[42:39] lord may we just reach into the
[42:41] storehouse oh god and and break the
[42:43] bread of life to us oh god and just have
[42:46] your perfect will and way this evening
[42:47] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[42:49] amen you may be seated
[42:52] so we just kind of want to finish our
[42:53] thought
[42:55] that we spoke a few weeks ago i don't
[42:58] remember how long ago it was now
[43:00] but on the power of obedience
[43:03] and the subtitle that we kind of spoke
[43:05] at the time but maybe we'll get to
[43:08] in earnest this evening
[43:11] is
[43:12] authority under headship
[43:15] and and just to kind of recap very
[43:17] quickly what we spoke about before you
[43:21] know we we could read in the book of
[43:22] second timothy chapter three
[43:24] it says this know also that in the last
[43:26] days perilous times shall come and how
[43:28] many know we're living in the last days
[43:30] so we can surely apply this uh to our
[43:32] day right now it says for men shall be
[43:34] lovers of their own selves
[43:36] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[43:38] disobedient to parents unthankful and
[43:40] holy without natural affection truth
[43:42] breakers false accusers incontinent
[43:44] fierce despisers of those that are good
[43:47] traitors heady highmended lovers of
[43:49] pleasure more than loves of god
[43:50] having a form of godliness but denying
[43:52] the power thereof from such turn away
[43:55] and we know that is the day that we're
[43:56] living in we can see it on every hand
[43:59] the attitude of the people of this world
[44:01] the attitude of
[44:02] i guess what we'd say many so-called
[44:04] christians that that claim christ but
[44:07] don't live a life that would even come
[44:09] anywhere close to expressing the
[44:11] character of jesus christ
[44:13] and we see
[44:14] that it's so true
[44:16] men are lovers of their own selves
[44:18] i've said it i've said it before here i
[44:20] just always kind of thought of it that i
[44:23] caught i caught the unholy trinity of me
[44:25] myself and i
[44:26] the the thing the that's what people
[44:28] care about is they only care about what
[44:30] affects themselves
[44:32] you know i see it all the time
[44:35] people would say well it doesn't it
[44:37] doesn't affect me so what should i care
[44:39] well
[44:40] you know but the but we've heard even
[44:42] from our pastor and and
[44:45] what fulfills the law and the prophets
[44:47] of as you would have men do unto you do
[44:50] unto do unto one another and even the
[44:53] lord jesus said you would know
[44:55] my disciples by their love one for the
[44:57] other
[44:58] and we find that the natural love
[45:01] between men is even waned to the point
[45:04] the scripture says that because iniquity
[45:06] would abound the love of many would wax
[45:08] cold and we find because the name of
[45:10] christ is blasphemed in such a way where
[45:13] you know that people would turn on a
[45:14] television and see you know a preacher
[45:16] on tv just begging for money or living
[45:19] one kind of way and preaching another
[45:20] thing
[45:22] that because iniquity abounds the love
[45:24] of the love of many would wax cold
[45:27] and
[45:28] but but god is calling for a complete
[45:32] separation from all unbelief
[45:34] god is calling for a complete obedience
[45:36] to his word we read the quote and i
[45:38] guess we could read it even again here
[45:41] from the token
[45:42] and
[45:43] brother branham says the full obedience
[45:45] to the word of god to the to god's
[45:47] entire word will entitle you to this
[45:50] token
[45:51] but if we looked at that from a purely
[45:54] intellectual standpoint we'd surely fail
[45:57] because we've already fallen short so
[46:00] what does it come down to is
[46:02] what are we really looking at
[46:05] in the in the end is are we truly
[46:08] looking at our sacrifice
[46:10] or if we become carnal and start to look
[46:12] at the things that we can perform
[46:15] because
[46:16] in the end brothers and sisters it all
[46:18] comes back to the lord jesus christ it
[46:21] all comes back to grace now we don't
[46:23] live in disgrace thinking that we can
[46:25] just go live in any kind of way and just
[46:27] do whatever we want and say well we're
[46:29] just happy because the lord did all of
[46:31] it no but because the when when one
[46:33] truly believes the word of god it brings
[46:36] a change in an individual god you can't
[46:39] come into the presence of god you can't
[46:41] come to a to a true knowledge of the
[46:44] word of god and leave the same way you
[46:46] came in it just can't happen you'll
[46:48] either go away you'll go away an
[46:50] unbeliever
[46:51] and be sealed away to that fate
[46:54] or or something will change in you then
[46:56] you'll cling to that blood you'll cling
[46:59] to that sacrifice
[47:01] and what we find is so many times the
[47:03] devil has tried to trick the people of
[47:06] god
[47:07] into thinking that once they've con once
[47:09] they've started in this way of grace
[47:12] that they're made perfect
[47:14] by their own actions
[47:15] but we know that's not the truth because
[47:17] it's always the grace of god and so much
[47:20] that we find out that when the capstone
[47:22] came it didn't shout works works
[47:26] it didn't shout law law it didn't shout
[47:29] self-righteousness self-righteousness
[47:32] but it came with shoutings crying grace
[47:35] grace unto it
[47:38] i was i was driving down the road
[47:40] probably a month ago
[47:42] and we were driving and i just had a lot
[47:44] of things on my heart and i was really
[47:45] just praying
[47:47] just lord i really i just really need
[47:49] you know we need a touch from the lord
[47:51] how many need a touch from the lord
[47:53] you know it's not enough you know
[47:56] it's not enough to just think about what
[47:58] the lord did for you way back when
[48:00] i'm thankful for what god did for me way
[48:02] back when i wouldn't be where i am now
[48:04] if it wasn't for how god changed me and
[48:07] brought me to the place i'm at now but i
[48:09] need i need rivers of living water
[48:12] flowing out from my belly right now
[48:15] we can't live in that broken cistern
[48:19] back there heaping up testimonies of
[48:21] days past and days gone by i want i need
[48:25] a living god right now
[48:27] and we have a living god right now
[48:30] if we could receive it
[48:31] but i was just really crying out to the
[48:33] lord
[48:34] and you may think this is really simple
[48:36] and that is really simple but i would
[48:38] just something i just was sitting here
[48:40] at a stoplight and i looked up and we
[48:42] know how they have the road signs around
[48:43] texas those big ones with the orange
[48:45] letters how they have the little orange
[48:47] lights that light up to make the
[48:48] different words
[48:50] and
[48:50] and
[48:51] and i know that they it may be in the
[48:53] natural it may have seemed like nothing
[48:55] because surely maybe someone was just
[48:57] running a test on the screen or
[48:58] something but i looked up and i saw and
[49:00] it said test test
[49:02] and i was like oh my and just something
[49:04] in my heart was like that was the lord
[49:07] just preparing me for something like the
[49:09] lord was just kind of giving you know
[49:10] maybe you say well that was just a guy a
[49:12] technician doing something wasn't on the
[49:13] other billboards so i don't know what it
[49:15] was but i looked at it and something
[49:17] just said that was for me and i kind of
[49:19] you know how it is when the lord might
[49:21] give you a warning on something you can
[49:22] almost get that the devil tries to put a
[49:24] fear it's like oh my what's around the
[49:26] corner what test test is coming and i
[49:29] started thinking about i said well lord
[49:30] praise god you know if there is a test
[49:32] coming you warn me about it and i know
[49:34] i've got a way of escape by his grace he
[49:36] said you won't go any temptation but the
[49:39] lord will provide a way of escape and it
[49:41] was just something that the lord came to
[49:43] me like a few hours later and i started
[49:44] thinking about that scripture
[49:46] and i said you know what lord i said
[49:48] there's grace grace for the test test
[49:52] and i said praise the lord because no
[49:55] matter how the devil comes in though the
[49:57] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[49:59] of god will lift up a standard against
[50:01] it
[50:02] so it doesn't matter how many the enemy
[50:05] comes in with
[50:07] i think the scripture says in one place
[50:09] he says he says one of you will put
[50:11] flight to a thousand and ten of you will
[50:13] put flight to tens of thousands
[50:15] how much more is it for the people of
[50:17] god
[50:20] how the prophet could say well when that
[50:22] when the when the weakest christian gets
[50:24] on their knees the demons tremble
[50:26] the satan cow is in the corner
[50:29] why because he knows more than we do
[50:32] many times
[50:33] what power lays in the word of god and
[50:35] when we just put our simple faith in him
[50:39] i i i think about this and
[50:41] if if we started by grace then we got to
[50:44] finish with grace
[50:46] and it comes down to realizing brothers
[50:49] and sisters that when when it's at the
[50:51] end of the day no matter how much you
[50:54] think you've accomplished no matter how
[50:56] much you think you've done for god no
[50:58] matter how much you think you've
[50:59] achieved for him
[51:02] you're going to lay that crown at his
[51:03] feet when it's all said and done
[51:05] you're going to lay it all down before
[51:06] him because it was only by his grace
[51:08] that you achieved it it was only by the
[51:11] grace of the lord jesus that you're here
[51:14] right now it was only by his will for
[51:17] your life if you could just accept it
[51:22] but he's working something in us and so
[51:24] we just to kind of recap we talked about
[51:27] that power of obedience and how
[51:29] even in the old testament we find so
[51:31] many things that looked silly we talked
[51:33] about jericho and now it made no natural
[51:36] sense
[51:37] that people marching around a city
[51:40] and shouting and blowing a trumpet could
[51:42] bring the walls down how naaman how the
[51:45] prophet didn't even bless him with his
[51:47] presence sent the servant and said go
[51:49] dip in the jordan and it wasn't that it
[51:52] wasn't the scientific act of dipping in
[51:54] a muddy river that cleansed the leper
[51:57] from his spots
[51:58] why we talk about abraham how god said
[52:01] separate yourself and i'm going to bless
[52:03] you it wasn't just abraham doing that
[52:06] that made him have a child
[52:10] but it was obedience to the word of god
[52:14] that brought the blessing
[52:18] but now you start to think about
[52:20] obedience and we talked about ob obeying
[52:23] from the heart
[52:24] how how it's got to be a life that comes
[52:27] from inside the inside it's it's not
[52:30] enough to have a mental conception of it
[52:32] it's not enough to just be able to read
[52:34] the word and say well yes i see this and
[52:36] i see that as our pastor was talking
[52:39] about seeing the book from the other
[52:40] side
[52:42] because it goes remember our prophet
[52:44] even taught us that the word we're
[52:46] seeing this word it's between the lies
[52:49] you say oh brother you're starting to
[52:50] get outside the word no we start to
[52:52] understand that to truly understand the
[52:55] word
[52:56] you've got to be one with the word
[52:58] because the only way you can truly see
[53:01] what this word is bringing us to
[53:03] is to know the author
[53:05] doesn't matter how much you can memorize
[53:07] it doesn't matter how much you can quote
[53:08] it doesn't matter how many messages you
[53:11] can listen to
[53:12] except you be in tune with the with the
[53:15] composer
[53:16] if you're not in in unity with the
[53:19] writer of the music you'll never know
[53:21] how it's supposed to be played
[53:25] i think we've heard our pastor even
[53:27] mention
[53:28] uh uh my i might have been brother david
[53:30] or another brother mentioned about that
[53:32] that carburetor
[53:33] and how they couldn't get it to work
[53:35] well what would it have been if that if
[53:38] that man
[53:39] that was trying to work on it would say
[53:41] you don't know what you're talking about
[53:43] well they say well i can produce the
[53:44] credentials that show you i created
[53:46] that's why you don't know what you're
[53:47] talking about
[53:48] and that's many times without even
[53:50] knowing what we do to the lord
[53:53] you say lord how could this be in my
[53:55] life
[53:56] how can i live this overcoming life
[53:59] how can i be more than an overcomer more
[54:01] than a conqueror
[54:03] he said it doesn't matter how it can
[54:05] happen the only thing that matters is i
[54:07] said it would happen
[54:10] if you could just be audacious enough to
[54:12] believe it
[54:14] he'll perform it
[54:16] that's what separated abraham
[54:19] was no matter what he felt
[54:22] no matter what he did no matter what
[54:24] mistakes he made he was crazy enough to
[54:27] believe that because god said it he will
[54:30] perform it he that begun a good work in
[54:33] you is faithful to complete it
[54:36] he said i know the thoughts i have
[54:38] towards you thoughts of peace and not of
[54:40] evil to bring it to an expected end
[54:43] so if if or if you've already had that
[54:46] thought about you then why do you keep
[54:48] trying to change god's mind about
[54:50] yourself
[54:53] but the problem is we live so much in
[54:55] our flesh that we can't even accept
[54:58] what god's made us
[55:03] we can't even accept it many times
[55:05] because we can't we can't overcome this
[55:08] carnal mind that sees nothing but
[55:11] wickedness in the flesh
[55:13] you're in good company because even paul
[55:15] said oh wretched man that i am
[55:18] he said what i would do good evil is
[55:20] present with me the good that i would i
[55:22] do not but that would i don't want to do
[55:23] that i do
[55:26] so brothers and sisters you're in good
[55:27] company
[55:29] but be like paul as well and say
[55:31] forgetting those things that are being
[55:37] because it has nothing to do with your
[55:39] ability
[55:42] if it had anything to do with your
[55:44] ability one drop of your ability would
[55:46] make the blood of christ of not effect
[55:51] it has nothing to do with you
[55:53] [Music]
[55:56] i'm preaching at myself tonight too
[55:58] because it's about time we got out of
[56:00] our own selves about it he promised the
[56:03] word he said i will have a bride without
[56:06] spot without wrinkle without blemish
[56:10] and then he called you to the only word
[56:12] that could produce that
[56:14] and the devil's in your ear telling you
[56:16] it can't happen
[56:19] you need to be crazy enough to stand up
[56:22] no matter what happens
[56:24] and look the devil in the eye and say i
[56:26] believe what god spoke about me
[56:31] in spite of all my failures
[56:33] in spite of all my shortcomings in spite
[56:37] of how i've failed him over and over and
[56:39] over and over and over and over and over
[56:40] again
[56:41] because it's not about you anyway
[56:44] that's why christ died
[56:47] that's why he rose again
[56:50] that's why the blood is there for you
[56:53] you know brother bradham said people
[56:54] wouldn't make a rapture because they
[56:56] can't accept the fullness of the
[56:58] atonement
[57:00] except the fullness of the atonement
[57:04] to be crazy enough
[57:07] to believe that even if you messed up
[57:11] even when you fall flat on your face
[57:14] you can get back up apply the blood put
[57:17] it behind you and keep walking forward
[57:19] [Applause]
[57:21] brothers and sisters if david
[57:24] under the blood of bulls and goats
[57:26] could reach into the grace of god when
[57:28] he was a murdering adulterous liar
[57:33] so much so that the law didn't even
[57:35] apply to him anymore he should have died
[57:39] pronounced his own judgment
[57:41] but the prophet got right through the
[57:43] prophet come back and says you won't die
[57:46] if he could pull the grace of god down
[57:49] in the blood of bulls and goats how much
[57:52] more in the final age
[57:55] what god is bringing your people to
[57:57] perfection
[58:01] if he could do that how much more us the
[58:03] blood wasn't even applied then but his
[58:05] faith in that sacrifice was so much
[58:08] that he could reach beyond time and grab
[58:11] a grace that wasn't even in his time yet
[58:14] did you ever think about that
[58:17] now that's
[58:18] that may be crazy but that's the faith i
[58:21] want to have
[58:22] that's the faith i you know what i'm
[58:23] going to be crazy that's the fate i
[58:25] possess
[58:26] why because paul said paul said that the
[58:30] life that i now live i live by the faith
[58:32] god put in me no sir he said the life
[58:35] that i live i live by the faith of the
[58:38] son of god
[58:40] he wasn't even relying on his own faith
[58:42] anymore
[58:43] hallelujah
[58:47] that's the faith i want glory to god
[58:51] not to even rely on my own faith because
[58:53] you can't work it up anyway
[58:57] i believe in pentecostal stuff i believe
[59:00] in singing and shouting and dancing
[59:01] speaking in tongues and words of wisdom
[59:03] and and prophecies and all that stuff
[59:05] but it doesn't do any good
[59:07] if then when you get out there you go
[59:09] and back bite one another and fight with
[59:10] one another and do all these things it
[59:12] doesn't it doesn't do anything
[59:15] power without character say 10. so we
[59:18] wonder why the power isn't here like it
[59:20] ought to be because he's building
[59:21] character first see god does it the
[59:23] right way
[59:24] satan will come down and just pour a
[59:26] bunch of power out on a bunch of people
[59:27] that don't care nothing about god in
[59:29] their hearts
[59:30] but the ones that do care about god and
[59:32] want to do it the right way you know
[59:33] what he's going to do he said he said
[59:35] that husbandman he said he waited long
[59:39] he waited patiently for the fruit he
[59:42] waiteth and waiteth and waited and you
[59:44] know what they say about the fruits the
[59:46] fruits that you got to wait the longest
[59:47] on those are the best ones
[59:49] those are the ones that are most
[59:51] precious those are the ones that are
[59:52] worth the most
[59:53] because those are the fruits that take a
[59:55] lot of patience to go oh you can go
[59:56] throughout a bunch of weeds and they'll
[59:58] sprout off overnight but the one that
[1:00:00] you gotta cultivate the one that you
[1:00:02] gotta put prayer into the one that you
[1:00:04] gotta get that on your knees and you
[1:00:06] gotta jump about it and dig it up and
[1:00:08] the wind's gonna blow and the rain's
[1:00:09] gotta come
[1:00:11] that's the precious fruit
[1:00:14] so don't get discouraged
[1:00:16] god's got a bride
[1:00:18] right here
[1:00:20] all around the world
[1:00:22] he's got it right here you got to put
[1:00:23] that to yourself he's got a bride right
[1:00:25] here
[1:00:26] that he's bringing to perfection
[1:00:28] i don't care how he does it i don't care
[1:00:31] what i got to go through i don't care
[1:00:32] what i got to look like
[1:00:34] because i already look like a fool
[1:00:36] anyway so i might as well go 100 percent
[1:00:38] with it as it is and you could call me
[1:00:41] crazy and say brother but but did you
[1:00:44] did this and brother you failed here
[1:00:46] that you know what i'm not counting on
[1:00:47] myself anyway yeah even if it was true
[1:00:51] even if it was true i said lord forgive
[1:00:54] me i'm gonna do the best i can and
[1:00:56] that's where grace takes over
[1:01:00] that doesn't excuse anything
[1:01:03] but there's a reason why when you really
[1:01:06] became a christian when your heart was
[1:01:08] really changed that no matter how many
[1:01:10] times you mess up it tears you up every
[1:01:12] time
[1:01:16] the devil's always there you ain't no
[1:01:17] christian because of this and because of
[1:01:18] that
[1:01:20] well if i don't if i'm not a christian
[1:01:21] then why do i care so much every time it
[1:01:24] happens
[1:01:29] remember that devil he's slick he's
[1:01:31] going to get you coming and going
[1:01:36] he's going to tell you he's going to
[1:01:37] tell you when you don't feel
[1:01:38] condemnation because you believe in the
[1:01:40] grace of god that your conscience is
[1:01:42] just seared with a hot iron
[1:01:43] but then he's going to get you when you
[1:01:45] feel some conviction because you did
[1:01:46] something that's he ate a christian
[1:01:48] because you wouldn't have done it anyway
[1:01:49] and god wouldn't let you feel this bad
[1:01:51] see it doesn't matter if you try to do
[1:01:52] it intellectually you'll lose every time
[1:01:55] but you've got to look beyond that sense
[1:01:57] you've got to move beyond your mindful
[1:02:00] thinking
[1:02:07] that's rapturing faith
[1:02:09] you say oh that's simple yeah it's
[1:02:11] simple enoch walked with god
[1:02:14] that's all he did
[1:02:16] noah was out there building a boat
[1:02:19] he was working hard
[1:02:21] enoch walked with god
[1:02:23] which one looked like they were more
[1:02:24] righteous
[1:02:26] which one looked like they had more
[1:02:27] fruit
[1:02:30] you know what you can call me fruitless
[1:02:32] all you want as long as when you look
[1:02:34] for me i'll be gone
[1:02:35] that's all right
[1:02:37] you you know everybody else could go out
[1:02:38] there and build their boats you can go
[1:02:40] out there and build your big kingdoms
[1:02:42] you can go out there and build your big
[1:02:44] things your big monuments to your own
[1:02:46] ability if i could just walk humbly with
[1:02:48] god
[1:02:49] and then and then and then when you turn
[1:02:51] around when that when that person turns
[1:02:52] around and say oh look at this big thing
[1:02:54] i built and i'm gone that'll be that's
[1:02:57] the fruit all that's the fruit i need
[1:02:58] right there that's the kind of fruit i'm
[1:03:00] looking for brothers and sisters
[1:03:04] see but the devil's got us all thinking
[1:03:07] that it's all about us now
[1:03:10] you started out in grace are you made
[1:03:12] perfect by works or by your own
[1:03:13] righteousness sir i mean remember if god
[1:03:16] did one thing one way
[1:03:18] he's always got to do it that way
[1:03:20] so if he started this working grace
[1:03:23] is he going to finish it by works i
[1:03:25] think that
[1:03:28] you think we're going to glory when we
[1:03:30] get up there and say praise the lord
[1:03:33] look how well i lived
[1:03:35] look how good i lived you know what
[1:03:37] we're going to say is glory to god for
[1:03:40] the blood of the lamb
[1:03:42] who cleanses from all unrighteousness
[1:03:44] who sealed us away into his kingdom by
[1:03:47] his grace
[1:03:50] we ain't gonna be singing any songs
[1:03:52] about how good we did
[1:03:54] how many people i witnessed to
[1:03:56] how many songs i was saying and how
[1:03:58] perfectly in key they were and i didn't
[1:03:59] hear how well i did this or did that or
[1:04:02] how many how many things i did
[1:04:05] it was all him that did it and you
[1:04:07] already have listen
[1:04:10] except the lord built their house they
[1:04:12] labor in vain they build it
[1:04:18] remember what brother branham said
[1:04:19] statue of a perfect fan he said you
[1:04:21] don't add to it it adds to you
[1:04:23] so why do you think you're going to get
[1:04:25] your little twigs of self-righteousness
[1:04:28] your little haystacks and and little hay
[1:04:31] bales of of of good works that you think
[1:04:34] now there's nothing wrong with good
[1:04:35] works see because the life of christ
[1:04:37] produces that in the individual
[1:04:40] see now the devil because the devil run
[1:04:41] the other side see well you ain't got to
[1:04:42] do nothing you're just predestinated
[1:04:43] right no it'll produce something
[1:04:46] it may be the littlest remember brother
[1:04:48] ram said he said if you just wiggle that
[1:04:50] little finger
[1:04:51] you wiggle the little finger he said
[1:04:53] pretty soon it'll be the whole finger
[1:04:54] pretty soon it's the hand pretty soon
[1:04:56] it's the arm pretty soon you don't
[1:04:57] you're running down the street
[1:04:59] but it'll produce something
[1:05:01] and i don't believe there's anybody in
[1:05:03] here that can say when god touched their
[1:05:05] hearts they didn't see that little thing
[1:05:07] start to fly
[1:05:09] as little as it might have been why
[1:05:11] because the one littlest drop of the
[1:05:14] power of god in your life is more
[1:05:16] powerful
[1:05:18] it's more overcoming
[1:05:20] than all the devils those 200 million
[1:05:22] demons from euphrates that got their
[1:05:24] guns trained right on the bride
[1:05:26] one drop of the blood of jesus christ if
[1:05:28] you could have faith in that
[1:05:30] it's all it doesn't matter
[1:05:32] why because it's not about you
[1:05:34] it was never about you
[1:05:36] and that's what we that's where
[1:05:38] many times we've gotten off the track
[1:05:40] because we hear so much about the bride
[1:05:42] the only thing that makes the bride
[1:05:44] special is that he's in her
[1:05:47] is that there she's one with the groom
[1:05:49] that's why she's the bride
[1:05:51] did you ever know there's a reason why
[1:05:53] there's the bride and the bride groom
[1:05:55] see the bridegroom has all of it
[1:05:58] the bride's just got the bride
[1:06:01] but i need the bride groom
[1:06:03] i need to have all of it
[1:06:05] i don't want just the peace
[1:06:07] i need all of him
[1:06:08] because he's got everything i need
[1:06:13] hell should i
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:19] we got we've gotten so much thought i've
[1:06:21] called it before maybe he said it here
[1:06:22] bride pride
[1:06:25] well i'm the bride now i by the grace of
[1:06:27] god brother matthew you may be able to
[1:06:28] back me up on this brother because and
[1:06:30] this isn't calling you out i know i
[1:06:31] believe you'd you'd take this but
[1:06:33] because i was never into like the bar
[1:06:35] scene the lord just kind i had my own
[1:06:37] struggles but that was one but i've
[1:06:39] heard a lot of people that i knew that
[1:06:40] were in there and you might be able to
[1:06:41] back this up said the one you at the at
[1:06:43] the you know they get the guys that
[1:06:44] would get riled up in the bar and i've
[1:06:46] heard people say this a lot of places i
[1:06:47] worked at in the construction sites they
[1:06:49] said it ain't the one that talks biggest
[1:06:51] you got to worry about it's the guy that
[1:06:52] sits in the corner that's real quiet
[1:06:55] see and that's see that's what the
[1:06:57] devil's looking at with a lot of people
[1:06:58] i'm brian i'm bright i'm bride
[1:07:01] you ain't got to worry about the talkers
[1:07:03] hey but but that one that's in their
[1:07:05] closet real quiet like
[1:07:07] praying out to god all right becoming
[1:07:09] unified with the bridegroom
[1:07:11] that's the one the devil's scared about
[1:07:12] brothers and sisters
[1:07:15] now no i believe in speaking a
[1:07:17] confession he's the high priest of your
[1:07:19] confession but the lord knows the way
[1:07:21] you're speaking it you know when you
[1:07:22] walk around your chest puffed out and
[1:07:24] head so big you couldn't fit it through
[1:07:25] the double doors over here see but but
[1:07:28] the life of christ brings humility
[1:07:32] remember the way up is down
[1:07:35] the way up is down
[1:07:37] i know i'm nothing
[1:07:39] i'm proving that to myself over and over
[1:07:40] and over again
[1:07:42] maybe let the lord jesus prove to you
[1:07:44] that he's all in all
[1:07:45] that he's all we need
[1:07:47] i hope that's all right
[1:07:51] so what we really want to get to here we
[1:07:53] just talked about that obedience and how
[1:07:55] we find out what happens in that
[1:07:57] denominational spirit
[1:07:59] is they can't obey the word of god
[1:08:01] because they've they've trapped
[1:08:02] themselves in a little cage of their own
[1:08:05] creeds and dogmas so when the lord says
[1:08:07] receive ye the holy ghost and it's
[1:08:09] outside those bars they can't reach it
[1:08:11] because they're trapped
[1:08:12] when he says believe every word jesus
[1:08:14] christ the same yesterday and forever
[1:08:16] and it's outside they can't reach it why
[1:08:18] because they've been trapped they can't
[1:08:19] obey the full word of god there may be
[1:08:21] something in there that could
[1:08:22] intellectually maybe grasp it
[1:08:25] and say oh yeah that looks right but my
[1:08:28] church
[1:08:29] but my experiences taught me this i
[1:08:31] don't care what your experiences have
[1:08:33] taught you i don't care what your
[1:08:34] intellect can come up with if it's
[1:08:36] against the word of god it goes in the
[1:08:38] trash
[1:08:40] i know that's simple
[1:08:42] but that's where eve that's why we read
[1:08:43] genesis there because
[1:08:45] eve's simple thing if you listen to the
[1:08:47] the to the message satan's eden
[1:08:50] brother branham said that what happened
[1:08:51] was they were naked and that they were
[1:08:53] not ashamed why because the brother
[1:08:55] brahem said that they were covered with
[1:08:56] a holy ghost veil a holy veil that
[1:09:00] shielded them from all those things
[1:09:02] that they didn't even need to know it it
[1:09:04] wasn't anything to them but see what
[1:09:06] happened brother branham says that she
[1:09:08] lusted for knowledge
[1:09:10] and when she did that and she accepted
[1:09:12] the devil's lie
[1:09:13] she replaced a holy veil with a lust
[1:09:16] veil
[1:09:17] and that's why we see now so many people
[1:09:19] shipwrecks
[1:09:21] because thinking that they're with the
[1:09:22] word of god
[1:09:24] they've replaced that holy veil that was
[1:09:26] once presented to them with the lust
[1:09:28] veil of oh i want to know this i want to
[1:09:30] accomplish that i want to do this and i
[1:09:32] want to do that you remember i is one of
[1:09:35] the wickedest words you can use because
[1:09:37] that was the devil's word your brother
[1:09:39] david and i were just talking about that
[1:09:40] yesterday was it just yesterday i'm
[1:09:43] losing track of time brother i don't
[1:09:44] know but we were just talking how what
[1:09:46] was that was the devil that said i will
[1:09:48] do this
[1:09:49] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:09:51] of god i will be like the most high i
[1:09:54] will do this and i will do that and if
[1:09:56] you find yourself this if this isn't the
[1:09:59] age for i i don't know what is i mean
[1:10:02] they plastered everywhere he got ipad
[1:10:04] iphone
[1:10:07] imac you know all these different things
[1:10:10] everything's about
[1:10:11] that unholy trinity me myself and i
[1:10:13] right why because that's what the
[1:10:15] devil's desire was was to create a
[1:10:17] kingdom unto himself
[1:10:20] but see the desire of christ when he
[1:10:22] came on the seat he said i do nothing
[1:10:24] except what the father shows me
[1:10:26] my work is to do the will of him who
[1:10:28] sent me and to finish his work
[1:10:30] so if that was his desire what should
[1:10:33] our desire be
[1:10:34] it's to do to find the will of god
[1:10:37] and the will of god is his word
[1:10:41] so now we kind of get to the to the crux
[1:10:44] of the matter here
[1:10:46] authority under headship
[1:10:48] see because i we read that i'll just
[1:10:50] read this again here the of obedience
[1:10:52] the the definition of it
[1:10:55] because it's really powerful
[1:10:57] it says obedience is compliance with an
[1:10:59] order a request or law
[1:11:02] and so that's that's the surface level
[1:11:03] of it you say if i tell you something i
[1:11:06] say i need you to obey this order and
[1:11:08] you go do it you've obeyed right
[1:11:10] but this is what really struck me and
[1:11:12] this is where we'll read matthew 8 again
[1:11:15] the secondary
[1:11:16] the the end of that it says
[1:11:18] or submission
[1:11:21] to another's authority
[1:11:24] that's the kind of obedience god is
[1:11:25] looking for
[1:11:28] see because
[1:11:30] you remember in the scripture the lord
[1:11:31] told a parable
[1:11:33] and i think i have it in here
[1:11:36] if i could find it really quickly
[1:11:39] here we go matthew 21 verses 28 to 32 it
[1:11:42] says but what you think he a certain man
[1:11:44] had two sons and he came to the first
[1:11:46] and said son go work today in my
[1:11:48] vineyard
[1:11:49] he answered and said i will not but
[1:11:51] afterward he repented and went
[1:11:53] and he came to the second and said
[1:11:54] likewise and he answered and said i go
[1:11:57] sir and went not
[1:11:59] whether the twain did the will of his
[1:12:01] father they say unto him the first jesus
[1:12:03] saith unto him verily i say unto you
[1:12:05] that the public republicans and the
[1:12:07] harlots go into the kingdom of god
[1:12:08] before you
[1:12:09] for john came unto you in the way of
[1:12:11] righteousness and you believed in not
[1:12:12] but the republicans and the harlots
[1:12:14] believed him and ye
[1:12:15] when he had seen it repented not
[1:12:17] afterward that he might believe him
[1:12:19] and so what are we seeing here it's a
[1:12:21] difference between an intellectual
[1:12:23] religion
[1:12:24] and a heartfelt religion
[1:12:27] because i tell you what brothers and
[1:12:28] sisters there's many times in my life
[1:12:31] that because of the flesh
[1:12:33] the lord said do this and because my
[1:12:37] flesh either i either i felt you know in
[1:12:40] a bad mood
[1:12:41] if i could just say it that way or i was
[1:12:43] struggling with a mind battle i said
[1:12:45] lord i can't do it
[1:12:48] but my heart's desire
[1:12:51] said lord help me
[1:12:54] and whether it was like this every
[1:12:55] single time or not more than often than
[1:12:57] not you repent and you go say lord help
[1:12:59] me to do the right thing and not to
[1:13:02] disobey you lord when you want me to do
[1:13:03] something or whatever it might be apply
[1:13:06] that however you will
[1:13:07] but how many proclaim and say lord i'll
[1:13:11] do whatever you want me to do
[1:13:13] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:13:14] jesus christ well i can't go that far
[1:13:18] love your neighbor as yourself well i
[1:13:20] can't do that i mean you did did you see
[1:13:22] what they did to me
[1:13:24] see but there's a difference
[1:13:27] between a heartfelt religion
[1:13:29] something that changes an individual
[1:13:33] and that's
[1:13:34] the submission that's the obedience
[1:13:35] we're talking about it is a submission
[1:13:38] to authority
[1:13:40] i want to be fully submitted to the will
[1:13:43] of god in my life
[1:13:45] i want a hundred percent submission so i
[1:13:48] and and and if you'll bear with me we'll
[1:13:50] just go through this and we'll we won't
[1:13:52] be too much longer but
[1:13:54] uh we'll go back here and read in
[1:13:56] matthew chapter eight it says and when
[1:13:58] jesus was entered into capernaum there
[1:14:00] came unto a centurion beseeching him and
[1:14:02] saying lord my servant lieth at home
[1:14:04] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[1:14:07] and jesus saith unto him i will come and
[1:14:09] heal him
[1:14:11] and the saturn answered lord i am not
[1:14:13] worthy that thou should has come unto my
[1:14:14] roof but speak the word only and my
[1:14:17] servant shall be healed now we read that
[1:14:19] and we think oh that's just a powerful
[1:14:21] statement just speak the word we use
[1:14:23] that part of it so often just speak the
[1:14:26] word
[1:14:27] that spoken word power
[1:14:29] sounds really good
[1:14:31] but what i want to focus on is why what
[1:14:34] revelation
[1:14:35] did he have
[1:14:36] that could give him that kind of a faith
[1:14:39] what was it that he understood there was
[1:14:42] something in this centurion that
[1:14:44] understood something that was so
[1:14:46] powerful
[1:14:48] that jesus said i've never seen a faith
[1:14:50] like this even in israel
[1:14:52] and brother branham said that was a type
[1:14:54] of you
[1:14:55] that's a gentile faith right there
[1:14:57] that's a gentile faith so you can say
[1:15:00] lord this is me
[1:15:02] i may not understand it but this is me
[1:15:05] right
[1:15:06] i don't care about i don't care i want
[1:15:07] understanding don't get me wrong but if
[1:15:10] that's not a barrier to receive from god
[1:15:14] abraham did not understand
[1:15:16] how his body would be transformed to
[1:15:18] receive a child and sarahs would be
[1:15:21] transformed but he believed it until it
[1:15:23] came to pass
[1:15:25] say lord i don't know how it will but
[1:15:26] you know what lord prove your word in me
[1:15:28] by bringing it to pass
[1:15:30] interpret your word in me by bringing it
[1:15:32] to pass in my life that's what i want
[1:15:35] yes
[1:15:36] but in verse 9 we we see why he could
[1:15:39] have this revelation he said for i am a
[1:15:42] man of authority is that what he said
[1:15:44] no
[1:15:46] he didn't say he was a man of authority
[1:15:48] now many times i think when we read this
[1:15:50] we have a tendency to fill that in
[1:15:52] ourselves and think well he was a
[1:15:54] centurion remember what it's a centurion
[1:15:55] he had a hundred soldiers under him
[1:15:57] so he said oh i'm a man of authority so
[1:15:59] i understand
[1:16:01] that because i'm in charge this and this
[1:16:03] happens no that's not the revelation he
[1:16:05] had
[1:16:06] he said i'm a man under
[1:16:08] authority
[1:16:10] so there so i want you to see this
[1:16:11] brothers and sisters there is a power
[1:16:15] there is a see this is exactly the
[1:16:17] opposite of what the world would have
[1:16:18] you believe in this day
[1:16:20] because the world wants to tell you
[1:16:22] you're just an independent person you
[1:16:24] don't need nobody else and you can do
[1:16:25] whatever you want if you put your mind
[1:16:28] to it if you do this and you do that and
[1:16:30] this or that or the other
[1:16:32] especially young people you're getting
[1:16:34] ready to go to college you're getting
[1:16:36] ready to finish high school and they're
[1:16:37] pumping you up until you do whatever you
[1:16:39] want to do
[1:16:40] you're the masters of your own destiny
[1:16:44] nothing but antichrist
[1:16:46] there's one that holds my destiny in his
[1:16:48] hands
[1:16:49] and i want what he's got for me
[1:16:52] so don't let him tell you that because
[1:16:53] it's antichrist all right
[1:16:55] but look what he says and it's not about
[1:16:57] well i have this power and i have this
[1:17:00] no he says he says i am a man under
[1:17:04] authority
[1:17:06] having soldiers unto me under me
[1:17:09] see having soldiers under him was
[1:17:11] secondarily
[1:17:13] this was a byproduct of him being under
[1:17:15] authority
[1:17:17] he says and i say to this man go and he
[1:17:19] goeth and to another comet he cometh
[1:17:21] unto my servant do this and he do with
[1:17:23] it
[1:17:24] so there was something in this centurion
[1:17:25] what did he see in jesus
[1:17:28] in the lord jesus he said i'm a man
[1:17:32] under authority
[1:17:33] so much so i can understand that
[1:17:35] whatsoever you say
[1:17:38] why because he knew remember what
[1:17:40] brother bran i'm told in the little
[1:17:42] parable if i could call it that of the
[1:17:43] police man in the middle of the
[1:17:44] intersection
[1:17:46] and he and brother brandon went out of
[1:17:47] his way when he describes this to
[1:17:49] describe a little pipsqueak
[1:17:51] that he said his hat pressed down over
[1:17:53] his ears
[1:17:54] he's got clothes that barely fit and
[1:17:56] he's walking out there he's just a
[1:17:57] little thing he said he couldn't i was
[1:17:59] just reading before i didn't get the
[1:18:00] quote down but brother brandon says what
[1:18:01] fight he said he couldn't even stop a
[1:18:02] bicycle if you wanted to so that's a
[1:18:05] pretty weak individual
[1:18:07] see this see the prophets get into
[1:18:09] something with these things he doesn't
[1:18:11] they didn't see them say things just for
[1:18:13] fun
[1:18:15] but he was
[1:18:16] but what was it he said but when that
[1:18:18] when that policeman walked out into that
[1:18:20] street
[1:18:21] and he put that hand up and blew that
[1:18:22] whistle he said three he said hundreds
[1:18:24] of horsepower vehicles would come
[1:18:25] screeching to a halt
[1:18:27] why it wasn't because the whistle
[1:18:30] it wasn't if you let let me go out there
[1:18:32] right down to the street put my hand up
[1:18:34] and start blowing away so you think
[1:18:35] anybody should stop for me
[1:18:37] you'll probably be praying for me in a
[1:18:38] couple minutes because i probably get
[1:18:40] run over
[1:18:41] why because that's not my place it's not
[1:18:43] my position
[1:18:45] but see when that policeman walked out
[1:18:46] there with that badge on
[1:18:48] with that uniform on with that hat on it
[1:18:51] man looked silly to the cardinal person
[1:18:54] but everybody had to recognize when he
[1:18:57] stood in his position
[1:18:59] and he blew that whistle
[1:19:01] in the line of duty everything had to
[1:19:03] recognize
[1:19:05] what authority was behind the man
[1:19:08] so that a centurion understood
[1:19:11] that being under authority is what
[1:19:14] granted the authority
[1:19:17] so he can sit there and look at the lord
[1:19:19] jesus and say if thy if you're not that
[1:19:22] you i believe you're the messiah
[1:19:26] thou art the messiah
[1:19:28] which means you are the man sent from
[1:19:30] god the lamb of god for the sins of the
[1:19:33] world
[1:19:34] if that be so that means somebody had to
[1:19:37] send you on the scene
[1:19:41] did not the lord say he said my father
[1:19:43] who is greater than i
[1:19:46] it's your father greater than you
[1:19:49] so what is he looking for he said
[1:19:51] because you came under authority
[1:19:54] there's something back in you
[1:19:57] all of heaven is back in you
[1:19:59] all of heaven is backing your word all
[1:20:01] you need to do is say the word he said
[1:20:04] if because if in the natural
[1:20:07] i as a roman centurion when i tell a
[1:20:09] soldier go do this
[1:20:11] it's not me saying it it's caesar
[1:20:15] because he had all of rome behind his
[1:20:16] word
[1:20:18] and that soldier knew and he didn't obey
[1:20:22] he's lucky if he's going to prison he's
[1:20:23] probably going to the chopping block
[1:20:27] so he understood the power of authority
[1:20:30] but the authority could only come
[1:20:33] underneath the appropriate headship
[1:20:36] it doesn't come just by doing anything
[1:20:38] willy-nilly
[1:20:40] just by doing it any kind of way
[1:20:42] but it has to be the right place it's
[1:20:44] got to be the right position you've got
[1:20:46] to be in the line of duty it's got to be
[1:20:48] for the purpose
[1:20:50] otherwise you end up like the sons of
[1:20:51] scheme
[1:20:53] well i will preach this because i saw
[1:20:55] paul do it
[1:20:57] but they didn't have authority because
[1:20:59] they weren't under authority
[1:21:04] and so when anybody runs out there and
[1:21:06] just wants to do any kind of way all the
[1:21:08] gospel of the message that william
[1:21:10] braden preached
[1:21:12] the devil laugh at you
[1:21:15] he said well i knew william branham
[1:21:19] i i knew i knew william branham
[1:21:21] but who are you
[1:21:23] but when you when you come underneath
[1:21:25] that authority
[1:21:26] when you come under the headship of the
[1:21:28] holy ghost and this message that's been
[1:21:30] preached
[1:21:31] then and you're in the line of duty
[1:21:33] every demon in hell's got to move out of
[1:21:35] the way
[1:21:37] see and we could take that all the way
[1:21:38] back all the way back
[1:21:40] it did not the lord even say to moses he
[1:21:43] said i've come down to deliver them and
[1:21:45] behold i send you
[1:21:47] why because god chose the foolishness of
[1:21:49] preaching
[1:21:50] he uses man to accomplish his desires in
[1:21:52] the earth
[1:21:54] and so
[1:21:55] moses come under authority
[1:21:57] and therefore he could go before pharaoh
[1:21:59] and say let my people go
[1:22:02] thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:22:04] let my people go
[1:22:07] let there be flags and those flies let
[1:22:10] there be frogs and there was frogs why
[1:22:12] because all of heaven
[1:22:14] was backing that word
[1:22:16] because he was under the authority of
[1:22:19] the word
[1:22:21] so how can we expect
[1:22:23] to have authority
[1:22:25] if we have not come to the revelation
[1:22:27] that we need to be under it first
[1:22:31] submitting ourselves this is where the
[1:22:33] true nature of the bride of christ comes
[1:22:35] into view
[1:22:36] because the nature of the bride is to
[1:22:38] submit paul said some wives submit
[1:22:41] yourselves to your husbands
[1:22:43] paul wasn't just talking about natural
[1:22:45] here brothers and sisters
[1:22:48] he said this is a great mystery
[1:22:50] but i speak concerning christ in the
[1:22:53] church
[1:22:54] so when you see when you start reading
[1:22:56] these things when you find out the
[1:22:57] nature of the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:02] i'm just going to say this i had this
[1:23:04] thought a few months ago
[1:23:06] and i thought about you know as a
[1:23:08] minister how powerful it is and how
[1:23:11] important it is
[1:23:13] it's a scary thing
[1:23:16] you better not as a minister come and
[1:23:18] preach your own thoughts
[1:23:20] you know because when you preach your
[1:23:21] own thoughts
[1:23:22] you know what happens you become you
[1:23:23] become a woman preacher
[1:23:26] because i can't give you anything
[1:23:29] i'm part of you i'm part of the bride
[1:23:31] i'm part of the feminine side
[1:23:34] but if he will come and speak
[1:23:36] if the husband will speak to the wife
[1:23:40] then we got something
[1:23:42] but if i just come on it'll be eve all
[1:23:44] over again it'd be eve trying to
[1:23:46] interpret the word to our own husband
[1:23:49] to our own people
[1:23:50] it'll bring death
[1:23:52] that's why we cannot stray
[1:23:54] from this message that's why we cannot
[1:23:57] stray from this word
[1:23:59] because it was the very mind of the
[1:24:01] husband coming down to speak to the
[1:24:04] bride
[1:24:06] so i can't speak my own thoughts
[1:24:09] it'll bring death it would be i'd be a
[1:24:11] woman preacher
[1:24:13] because i'd just be bride preaching the
[1:24:15] bride
[1:24:16] but if he'll come if the holy ghost can
[1:24:19] get me out of the way and the man can
[1:24:22] speak
[1:24:23] let the man speak
[1:24:25] i want my husband to speak this evening
[1:24:28] i want i i can't do anything for you but
[1:24:31] your husband could do everything for you
[1:24:37] i don't want to speak my own thoughts
[1:24:40] i don't know anything anyway
[1:24:45] the lord's given me grace just over 19
[1:24:48] years to have a revelation of this
[1:24:49] message and be serving him according to
[1:24:51] this this word
[1:24:54] i feel like i know less now than i did
[1:24:56] when i started
[1:24:58] because the more you come to know him
[1:25:01] the more the littler you become
[1:25:04] paul was the same way
[1:25:06] he started out i'm an apostle
[1:25:09] by the time he ended he said i'm the
[1:25:11] greatest the sinner chief of sinners
[1:25:13] you ever you ever heard that if you look
[1:25:15] at the timeline of the books that paul
[1:25:16] the the epistles he wrote he starts out
[1:25:18] talk bragging about being an apostle and
[1:25:21] if you go in the natural timeline by the
[1:25:22] time he ends that's where he ends on the
[1:25:24] chief of sinners why because the more he
[1:25:26] knew christ the more he knew how little
[1:25:28] he was
[1:25:29] that's how the people of god are
[1:25:31] that's how the people you get closer to
[1:25:32] god you get more humble you don't start
[1:25:34] to get built up in pride you don't start
[1:25:36] to get built up in your own abilities
[1:25:39] no sir you don't want to be of ashtai
[1:25:41] how many remember vashtai from the book
[1:25:43] of esther
[1:25:44] the king called her and she said i ain't
[1:25:47] going to the king
[1:25:48] i'm too busy with all my women over here
[1:25:50] remember a woman types the
[1:25:53] this vast i was puffed up in her
[1:25:55] position
[1:25:57] i sit as a queen i have need of nothing
[1:26:00] and no it's not
[1:26:02] that you're blind miserable wretched
[1:26:04] poor naked
[1:26:06] and so you know what the king did he
[1:26:07] said depose her i'll get you a new one
[1:26:10] you're the new one
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:13] he wooed the denominations in brother
[1:26:15] branham's day
[1:26:16] he wooed them with everything he had
[1:26:20] he said he shook every gift before him
[1:26:22] like that little child and they wouldn't
[1:26:24] take it
[1:26:26] you know what they did they said i'm
[1:26:27] gonna
[1:26:28] the book of esther vashtai she went and
[1:26:30] had a feast with her women
[1:26:32] that's what the pentecostals did
[1:26:34] they went right back to mama right back
[1:26:36] to the harlots right back to the
[1:26:38] and had a feast of the women so you know
[1:26:39] what god said i'll depose you
[1:26:42] and i'll find a woman that'll come after
[1:26:44] my own heart
[1:26:45] i'll find a woman that'll submit to this
[1:26:48] world
[1:26:49] i'm going to find me a bride that'll
[1:26:51] come under headship that he can be
[1:26:53] buffed up like the first one
[1:26:55] that's who he's looking for that's who
[1:26:57] he's found
[1:26:59] he's found a people that is going to
[1:27:01] rise up
[1:27:04] i ain't talking about rising up to
[1:27:05] anything great according to the world
[1:27:07] i'm talking about rising up in humility
[1:27:09] i'm talking about rising up in more
[1:27:11] sincerity i'm talking about rising up in
[1:27:13] more love i'm talking about divine love
[1:27:16] that is so powerful
[1:27:19] i remember i was just thinking about
[1:27:20] this quote you could look it up i'm sure
[1:27:21] you've heard it before brother branham
[1:27:22] talks about that divine love and he says
[1:27:24] oh you know you'll get all fussy with
[1:27:27] one another you're like oh i just can't
[1:27:28] stand this brother i just can't take
[1:27:30] this sister he said let something happen
[1:27:32] to him and watch your heart break for
[1:27:34] him
[1:27:35] oh i'm sure look i ain't the pastor so
[1:27:37] don't get me wrong but as a person who
[1:27:39] knows people oh i'm sure there's a lot
[1:27:41] of scruples that go on
[1:27:43] i'm sure there's a lot of things that go
[1:27:44] on people get mad at one another and
[1:27:45] little things start
[1:27:47] don't you worry the holy ghost is going
[1:27:49] to get you where you need to be
[1:27:51] remember iron sharpeneth iron it ain't a
[1:27:54] pleasant experience he said iron
[1:27:56] sharpeneth iron so sharpened with you
[1:27:57] the countenance of your friend
[1:28:00] yeah the lord uses one another to to
[1:28:03] beat one another up sometimes
[1:28:05] just to give you a little bit more love
[1:28:07] just like the just like the disciples
[1:28:09] remember james and john said we want to
[1:28:11] be the greatest
[1:28:13] and then all the disciples got mad and
[1:28:14] said what are you doing
[1:28:17] they got mad about it it's a human
[1:28:19] response i'm tired of human responses
[1:28:22] i want to have a supernatural response
[1:28:24] i want to have a holy ghost response i
[1:28:26] want to have a get down on my knees and
[1:28:28] pray for my brother response i want to
[1:28:30] get down and have my heart break for one
[1:28:31] another response that's the kind of life
[1:28:34] that is in each and every one of you i
[1:28:36] believe it it's in me
[1:28:39] sometimes i let the flesh get in the way
[1:28:41] a little too much
[1:28:42] and it blocks that expression
[1:28:44] how many of you can say amen to that
[1:28:46] sometimes you let the flesh get in the
[1:28:47] way and it blocks the expression but it
[1:28:49] doesn't mean it's not there
[1:28:51] it doesn't mean it's not there's
[1:28:53] something crying out in you
[1:28:55] it doesn't matter how many times in the
[1:28:57] natural in your mind have you given up
[1:29:00] i couldn't count how many times in my
[1:29:02] mind i've given up
[1:29:04] what does the song say something keeps
[1:29:06] holding me
[1:29:07] every day that i see
[1:29:10] there's something you can't stop it
[1:29:13] it's unstoppable because it's deity
[1:29:16] that was planted in you before the
[1:29:18] foundation of the world
[1:29:19] and then when the light of this gospel
[1:29:21] shone across that seed and brought it to
[1:29:23] life
[1:29:24] nothing will stop it reaching its
[1:29:26] destination
[1:29:29] yeah you make it
[1:29:30] you might make it a little harder on
[1:29:32] yourself it's hard to kick against the
[1:29:34] pricks
[1:29:35] you might make it a little bit harder on
[1:29:36] yourself but it's going to get there
[1:29:37] just the same
[1:29:39] why because i think we just heard a
[1:29:40] brother mention it i talked with it it's
[1:29:42] fun it's interesting
[1:29:44] you know
[1:29:45] i praise the lord for how he does things
[1:29:47] because you find out that channel of the
[1:29:50] holy ghost it's universal
[1:29:52] because you'll be thinking something a
[1:29:53] little bring a thought in your heart
[1:29:54] you'll talk about it to another brother
[1:29:56] and then a week or two later you'll hear
[1:29:58] someone say the exact same thing and you
[1:30:00] know you didn't talk to them
[1:30:03] but you just think about how it fixed
[1:30:05] this whole thing is brothers and sisters
[1:30:07] brother branham said oh yeah you can
[1:30:09] take the permissive will of god and oh
[1:30:11] every you know the devil as soon as you
[1:30:12] hear that you know what the devil does
[1:30:14] he goes
[1:30:15] permissive will
[1:30:16] you're going to get spanked it's going
[1:30:18] to be really bad you're going to suffer
[1:30:19] it's going to be horrible but you know i
[1:30:21] have a scripture
[1:30:22] that says
[1:30:23] all things
[1:30:25] work together for good
[1:30:27] all things work together for good
[1:30:30] and then
[1:30:32] even more than that when you think about
[1:30:34] how the prophet would say come back and
[1:30:36] say yeah you may take the permissive
[1:30:37] will but he will turn it around to
[1:30:40] glorify his perfect will
[1:30:42] so because we're an intellectual age
[1:30:44] let's examine that statement
[1:30:45] intellectually and let's beat the devil
[1:30:48] down with his own ideas
[1:30:49] let's take what the prophet said
[1:30:51] literally let's actually take it for
[1:30:52] what it means
[1:30:54] if you find that you've been the devil's
[1:30:56] always you're in the permissive will of
[1:30:57] god there's no way you can make it but
[1:30:59] then the prophet said he'll work it to
[1:31:00] glorify his perfect will he'll bring it
[1:31:03] right back around
[1:31:04] so you can look the devil right in the
[1:31:06] face and say devil i may have taken the
[1:31:07] permissive will
[1:31:08] you know brother branham took the
[1:31:09] permissive will
[1:31:11] he did it in south africa
[1:31:13] when he listened to those men and the
[1:31:14] angel flat out told him he said you can
[1:31:16] do it but you're going to suffer
[1:31:18] that was the permissive will but you
[1:31:19] know what he did he worked it to his
[1:31:20] perfect will
[1:31:22] because then when the cat when the time
[1:31:23] came see that was a learning experience
[1:31:25] so now when the time came see brother
[1:31:28] branham took the permissive will when he
[1:31:29] rejected the pentecostals the first time
[1:31:31] around then he suffered lost a wife lost
[1:31:34] a child
[1:31:35] tried to kill himself
[1:31:37] but what was god doing he took that and
[1:31:40] worked it around for his perfect will so
[1:31:42] that when the time came then that mighty
[1:31:45] proclamation could come forth and say
[1:31:46] because that was chosen the harder way
[1:31:49] do you realize all of those taken the
[1:31:51] easier way
[1:31:53] still didn't stop
[1:31:55] that pronouncement
[1:31:57] that should give you a little bit of
[1:31:58] hope
[1:32:00] that no matter how many times you may
[1:32:02] have felt like you took the easy way
[1:32:05] you're still taking the way with the
[1:32:06] lord's despised you
[1:32:09] you're still present forward by his
[1:32:11] grace
[1:32:12] and no matter what the devil says or you
[1:32:14] took the permissive will you can look at
[1:32:16] the devil and say yes but he'll work it
[1:32:18] to the perfect will
[1:32:20] he'll bring it back around so you
[1:32:21] realize you can never be out of the
[1:32:23] perfect will in the grand scheme
[1:32:27] you can't
[1:32:28] because god's will for you was already
[1:32:30] finished before the foundation
[1:32:33] he just wants you to walk in it
[1:32:36] but brother branham said you'll save
[1:32:37] yourself and god a lot of trouble
[1:32:42] but i could take consolation in knowing
[1:32:44] that even when that doesn't happen he's
[1:32:46] working all things
[1:32:48] for my good
[1:32:49] that doesn't give us an excuse brothers
[1:32:51] and sisters
[1:32:52] but it should give you a confidence in
[1:32:54] god
[1:32:55] to know that if you would submit
[1:32:57] yourself under this word
[1:32:59] he's working on you little by little
[1:33:01] that potter's hand is breaking you down
[1:33:03] and building you up breaking you down
[1:33:05] and building you up sometimes the potter
[1:33:07] has got to seemingly take you down to a
[1:33:10] lump again
[1:33:11] how many of you ever
[1:33:13] felt broke down like that
[1:33:15] you felt like you were coming into
[1:33:17] something
[1:33:18] and then before you knew it you were
[1:33:19] just a lumpy mess
[1:33:22] what was it the potter said oh there
[1:33:24] might have been an impurity got to get
[1:33:25] that out
[1:33:26] so what does he do he starts over again
[1:33:29] he takes that gold and puts it back in
[1:33:30] the fire
[1:33:31] he takes that gold and starts beating on
[1:33:33] it again
[1:33:34] but it doesn't stop the master's purpose
[1:33:36] for your life
[1:33:39] so what what's the what what happens now
[1:33:41] brothers and sisters is we got to come
[1:33:43] just come under accepting
[1:33:46] the headship
[1:33:48] of the world
[1:33:50] stop pushing it away
[1:33:53] you say oh i'm not good enough yes it's
[1:33:54] true that's not the point he was good
[1:33:56] enough
[1:33:59] you can't do it that's the point he did
[1:34:02] it for you and now he wants to do it
[1:34:05] through you
[1:34:10] you know i was thinking
[1:34:12] when i first i ministered this message
[1:34:14] in ohio like a couple months ago
[1:34:18] and it really you know it's amazing how
[1:34:20] the lord orders your footsteps because
[1:34:23] i learned
[1:34:24] you know i ministered here on the on the
[1:34:26] different flights and everything like
[1:34:28] that and we kind of talked about those
[1:34:29] things and how the lord will use even
[1:34:31] like your natural things the job and the
[1:34:33] different things you go through to teach
[1:34:35] you certain things
[1:34:36] and i was just struck because as i
[1:34:37] ministered
[1:34:39] the lord really brought it and i never
[1:34:40] even thought about it it was a fresh
[1:34:42] thing and i just want to share it to you
[1:34:43] as we close here you know as an air
[1:34:46] traffic controller
[1:34:48] i can say the same thing that centurion
[1:34:50] said according to the national man under
[1:34:51] authority
[1:34:53] you know when i sit down
[1:34:55] at that
[1:34:56] place and i'm and i'm sitting there and
[1:34:57] i'm talking airplanes
[1:34:59] they generally have to do what i tell
[1:35:00] them to do
[1:35:01] you know if i tell them to turn left
[1:35:03] they got to turn left if i tell them to
[1:35:04] go up they go up they go down they go
[1:35:05] down all those different things
[1:35:08] is it my voice that's anything special
[1:35:11] no
[1:35:12] is it my ability
[1:35:14] to fly an aircraft no because i have no
[1:35:16] idea how to fly an aircraft
[1:35:19] that's not my job
[1:35:23] it has nothing to do with that but
[1:35:25] because
[1:35:26] the words that i speak the federal
[1:35:28] government has placed
[1:35:30] a commission in my hand
[1:35:33] that said you are an air traffic
[1:35:34] controller in the national airspace
[1:35:36] system
[1:35:37] and you have authority over this
[1:35:38] airspace when i'm sitting down
[1:35:41] and what i say is backed by the
[1:35:43] authority of the federal government
[1:35:46] and so much that
[1:35:47] we if if
[1:35:48] if a pilot were to to do something wrong
[1:35:52] i can issue what's called a brasher
[1:35:53] warning and say well you did something
[1:35:55] wrong you got to call this number
[1:35:56] brother james probably has heard her
[1:35:58] heard of that
[1:35:59] i believe brother james has never had to
[1:36:01] deal with that because he's such a good
[1:36:02] pilot
[1:36:04] but
[1:36:06] but but but but
[1:36:08] it has nothing to do with me
[1:36:10] it's about the position i'm in
[1:36:13] and and what has been invested in me now
[1:36:15] if i were to just go out on the tarmac
[1:36:18] i just start waving around in an
[1:36:19] airplane and say you go over here and
[1:36:21] you go over here it wouldn't do me any
[1:36:22] good
[1:36:24] but see when i sit down
[1:36:26] see when i go into my place of work
[1:36:30] i have to have an identification
[1:36:32] but when my identification is met
[1:36:35] the door is open
[1:36:37] and when the door is open i can walk in
[1:36:38] the building i want you to catch this
[1:36:40] spiritually
[1:36:41] when the doors open i can go in the
[1:36:42] building
[1:36:44] and when i sit down at the position
[1:36:46] that i've been assigned to
[1:36:48] and i have the appropriate equipment
[1:36:50] i have an earpiece and i have a thing
[1:36:52] that i can plug in and a clicker to talk
[1:36:54] to him so when i'm equipped
[1:36:55] appropriately and i sit down at the
[1:36:57] appropriate position and not only that
[1:37:00] see that's not good enough because now i
[1:37:01] got to plug into the position
[1:37:04] see many times we get in trouble because
[1:37:05] we don't quite plug into the position
[1:37:06] we're supposed to be in
[1:37:10] lord help us all i want to be more i
[1:37:12] want to be more plugged in
[1:37:14] but see even that's not enough because
[1:37:16] now
[1:37:17] that's all well and good but i need to
[1:37:19] be certified to operate that position
[1:37:21] so i have to have a certification which
[1:37:23] means somebody else has signed off
[1:37:25] that i'm going to do the appropriate job
[1:37:28] and then when i do that i have to
[1:37:29] operate according to a certain set of
[1:37:31] rules
[1:37:32] i can't just go about doing whatever i
[1:37:34] want to do
[1:37:35] but i operate according to a certain set
[1:37:37] of rules that were given to me
[1:37:40] but when i meet all those requirements
[1:37:43] well then what i say goes
[1:37:47] and that's not puffing me up it's just
[1:37:49] the way it is
[1:37:51] and if i could say it the same way it's
[1:37:52] not puffing the bride of jesus christ
[1:37:54] but it's the way it is
[1:37:56] that when the bride of jesus christ
[1:37:57] comes into her position
[1:38:00] when she operates according to the set
[1:38:02] of rules that's been given to her and
[1:38:04] not just this but a message by a prophet
[1:38:06] that helps us to understand what this
[1:38:08] see i could read we i've told you before
[1:38:10] we have it called the 71 10.65 it's the
[1:38:12] rules for air traffic control in the
[1:38:14] national airspace system it's like that
[1:38:15] thick it's written by lawyers so you
[1:38:18] tell you how complicated it is to
[1:38:19] understand
[1:38:20] but
[1:38:22] but i couldn't just read that and
[1:38:23] quickly go into the job but i had to go
[1:38:25] through training i had to be tutored
[1:38:27] i had to come to an understanding of
[1:38:29] what certain things meant because i
[1:38:31] could read it a certain way and say well
[1:38:32] i would apply it this way they said well
[1:38:33] that's not the way it actually works
[1:38:36] you know there's a one time where maybe
[1:38:37] we thought we had this down
[1:38:40] but then along came a prophet and said
[1:38:41] oh no that's not quite the way it works
[1:38:44] and he was a vindicated prophet
[1:38:47] just like my trainers who all trained me
[1:38:49] they were already certified on the
[1:38:50] position
[1:38:51] they already had their credentials
[1:38:55] so but the bride of jesus christ when
[1:38:57] she comes into her position
[1:38:59] and then she operates to the set of
[1:39:00] rules
[1:39:02] and then she's been trained and tutored
[1:39:04] by the holy ghost
[1:39:06] who's taught her all the rules of the
[1:39:07] road
[1:39:08] taught see and what my job see i have to
[1:39:10] say the right thing at the right time
[1:39:11] and i have to say it in the right way
[1:39:14] and then we hear brother matthew
[1:39:15] preaching that a couple weeks ago about
[1:39:17] how what was it she said the right thing
[1:39:20] when you say the right thing at the
[1:39:21] right time powerful things can happen
[1:39:24] and see in my job it's the same way i
[1:39:25] can't just say well go do this and go do
[1:39:27] that no there's a certain we call it
[1:39:28] phraseology that i have to use to say it
[1:39:30] a certain way otherwise it's not obeyed
[1:39:33] kind of like baptism you know they want
[1:39:35] to go do it all the ways they want to do
[1:39:36] but we got to do it the right way
[1:39:39] and so but when all those things are met
[1:39:40] then i have to be equipped
[1:39:42] and so has the lord equipped his bride
[1:39:45] he equipped her with everything she
[1:39:47] needs to make it
[1:39:48] it was already in you from the
[1:39:49] foundation of the world and if that
[1:39:50] wasn't enough he gave you a word he gave
[1:39:53] you a message
[1:39:54] he gave you a vindicated prophet to
[1:39:56] prove that you're on the right place
[1:40:00] and then when you do all that
[1:40:01] when the bride sits in her position
[1:40:04] kind of like moses
[1:40:06] then he could say
[1:40:08] speak and go forward
[1:40:10] and that's what
[1:40:12] i guess the crux of the whole thing as
[1:40:13] we stand
[1:40:17] just to kind of end it on that note
[1:40:20] if we could understand the power
[1:40:24] of the authority
[1:40:26] if we'll come under that headship
[1:40:30] the carnal mind wants to have it their
[1:40:32] way
[1:40:33] i want to speak this into existence i
[1:40:34] want to go do this and do that and do
[1:40:36] this what if it's not for you to do
[1:40:39] i want to do what the lord wants for me
[1:40:40] to do
[1:40:45] i mean i i'll be honest according to the
[1:40:46] flesh i'd prefer not to be up here right
[1:40:48] now in the flesh
[1:40:50] i
[1:40:51] not good with groups of people
[1:40:53] i get very nervous
[1:40:56] i'm a loner by nature
[1:40:58] my wife will tell you that because we
[1:40:59] live together and sometimes she hardly
[1:41:00] sees me
[1:41:05] but i want what god wants for me
[1:41:08] and i don't say that just to be funny i
[1:41:10] say that because
[1:41:11] each one of us has a different battle
[1:41:13] that we're fighting in the flesh
[1:41:15] not everybody fights those battles
[1:41:18] not everybody fights the battles that i
[1:41:20] fight
[1:41:21] but see you couldn't be an overcomer if
[1:41:23] he didn't have a battle
[1:41:26] and so the devil is always trying to
[1:41:27] tell you that the battle is proof
[1:41:30] the battle is proof i think brother
[1:41:32] david our pastor has been saying it just
[1:41:34] beautifully how the devil if he can get
[1:41:37] you to think that god's your enemy
[1:41:41] and all he's done is he's tried to put a
[1:41:43] god mask on himself
[1:41:45] because it's always him
[1:41:47] he's the he's the accuser of the
[1:41:49] brethren
[1:41:50] and he tries to make you think that it's
[1:41:51] the lord
[1:41:53] brother branham said a powerful
[1:41:54] statement when he when he i believe he
[1:41:57] was talking about
[1:41:58] coming to an understanding of the the
[1:42:00] true the true oneness of god he said i
[1:42:03] always used to think that god was angry
[1:42:05] with me but jesus loved me
[1:42:09] come to find out
[1:42:10] what he say he said but jesus christ was
[1:42:12] the love of god
[1:42:14] expressed
[1:42:15] oh my oh
[1:42:17] oh lord help us to get that full
[1:42:18] revelation
[1:42:21] god's not angry with you
[1:42:23] god wants you to succeed
[1:42:25] he wants you to succeed so much that he
[1:42:28] already paved the way all you have to do
[1:42:29] is be cr i have to say it crazy enough
[1:42:32] to believe him
[1:42:34] because the devil's going to tell you
[1:42:35] that you're crazy
[1:42:39] your flesh is going to kick and scream
[1:42:41] every step of the way that's why you got
[1:42:43] to kill it every day
[1:42:45] the old man has to die every day take
[1:42:47] the sword of the word stab him down
[1:42:49] every day
[1:42:54] you're not alone paul said the good that
[1:42:57] i would i do not
[1:42:59] that that i don't want to do that's what
[1:43:01] i do
[1:43:02] oh wretched man that i am
[1:43:04] but then he comes back at another point
[1:43:06] and says the life that i now live i live
[1:43:07] by the faith of the son of god oh that
[1:43:10] gives me comfort because
[1:43:12] it wasn't even his faith
[1:43:14] he was living by the faith of jesus
[1:43:16] christ
[1:43:17] put your faith in the sacrifice
[1:43:23] that's where it lays
[1:43:24] and then just come under submission to
[1:43:25] that word
[1:43:26] little every bit by bit
[1:43:29] the devil wants you to finish this
[1:43:30] thought the devil wants you to think
[1:43:32] that because you're battling
[1:43:34] you're failing
[1:43:37] it's because you're battling
[1:43:39] because you're you're in the right
[1:43:43] remember the battle doesn't start till
[1:43:44] you crossed over jordan
[1:43:46] you didn't start fighting
[1:43:48] the hittites and the amorites and the
[1:43:50] parasites and all the jebusites and
[1:43:52] everything that's where the real battle
[1:43:54] started
[1:43:56] you had some battles out in the
[1:43:57] wilderness sure but the real battle
[1:43:59] got hot and heavy when you crossed that
[1:44:02] jordan now that that was okay this guy's
[1:44:03] first this guy's serious this brother
[1:44:05] and sister's serious
[1:44:07] they're really going to serve god now so
[1:44:10] now i got to pay some attention to him
[1:44:11] so don't be discouraged
[1:44:14] just pick up the sword and start cutting
[1:44:18] it doesn't need to be any
[1:44:20] if i could say it this way supernatural
[1:44:23] thing
[1:44:25] because jesus in the wilderness just
[1:44:26] used the word
[1:44:29] just the simple word
[1:44:32] he that begun a good work in you is
[1:44:33] faithful to complete it
[1:44:37] i know the thoughts that i have towards
[1:44:38] you thought the peace if not an evil to
[1:44:40] give you an expected end
[1:44:42] you know we had a glimpse of that
[1:44:43] expected end when we had a prophet go
[1:44:45] beyond the curtain of time
[1:44:46] that's my expected end
[1:44:49] i expect to throw my hands
[1:44:51] around brother branham and say my
[1:44:52] precious brother
[1:44:54] that's part of my expected end and i'm
[1:44:55] claiming it
[1:44:57] won't you claim it tonight
[1:44:59] and say i don't care what it looks like
[1:45:02] let's just bow our heads
[1:45:04] heavenly father
[1:45:07] lord maybe just a little bit of a broken
[1:45:09] up message this evening father
[1:45:12] but
[1:45:14] lord i want to come underneath the
[1:45:15] headship of your word
[1:45:18] i want to find that authority of your
[1:45:20] word that i can only find when i come
[1:45:22] under the headship of my husband
[1:45:25] lord i don't want to have my own
[1:45:26] thoughts i don't want to have my own
[1:45:28] ideas
[1:45:30] lord i don't want to have my own desires
[1:45:31] i don't want to have my own dreams
[1:45:34] lord i think so often of that song that
[1:45:36] we sing
[1:45:38] all of my ambitions hopes and plans
[1:45:41] i surrender these into your hands
[1:45:44] lord i think back onto how many
[1:45:48] big plans that i had
[1:45:50] when i was coming out of high school and
[1:45:53] thoughts that i had that i thought i was
[1:45:54] going to do this and do that
[1:45:57] and lord according to the nature you had
[1:45:58] to upend all those things and i didn't
[1:46:00] understand why until just a few months
[1:46:02] after that you brought this message
[1:46:03] across my path
[1:46:06] that i might not have ever heard
[1:46:08] if it wasn't for your grace to strip all
[1:46:10] those dreams away from me
[1:46:14] lord at the time
[1:46:16] lord being a
[1:46:17] christian in a denominational church i
[1:46:19] thought maybe you were out to get me or
[1:46:21] that you didn't love me but i found out
[1:46:22] later on lord it was because you loved
[1:46:24] me that you took all those things away
[1:46:27] so you could express your love to me
[1:46:28] through
[1:46:29] your election that you explained to me
[1:46:31] and showed to me and continue to show
[1:46:35] lord i pray for each one here lord that
[1:46:36] you just help them to make their calling
[1:46:38] and election sure
[1:46:41] lord that we could just be more sure of
[1:46:42] your word oh god
[1:46:44] that we could look to the sacrifice lord
[1:46:46] that we'd look to you that we'd look to
[1:46:48] calvary lord to look to the empty tomb
[1:46:50] and to the blood that was shed for us oh
[1:46:53] god that cleanses us from all
[1:46:54] unrighteousness
[1:46:56] that we would know with a surety lord
[1:47:00] that we stand before you it's perfectly
[1:47:02] spotless
[1:47:04] lord not because we've done any great
[1:47:05] thing but because we've trusted
[1:47:08] the work of calvary
[1:47:10] lord we've trusted a word that we've
[1:47:12] heard in our day
[1:47:14] lord we're going to come underneath that
[1:47:15] headshot
[1:47:16] lord we're going to submit ourselves to
[1:47:18] the word of this message that you've
[1:47:20] brought through the word of a prophet
[1:47:23] lord even as rebecca lord heard
[1:47:24] eliezer's call
[1:47:26] and said i'll go with him
[1:47:29] and lord what did she do but she stayed
[1:47:31] with that messenger all the way until
[1:47:33] she saw her isaac in that field and lord
[1:47:36] even then when she saw her isaac in the
[1:47:37] field what did she do but she she failed
[1:47:40] herself
[1:47:41] she came under headship
[1:47:43] she submitted herself lord to her
[1:47:45] husband
[1:47:48] lord i just want to surrender myself to
[1:47:51] my husband once again lord
[1:47:53] lord i just want to submit all of my
[1:47:55] desires to you all my thoughts
[1:47:57] all of my own thinking
[1:47:59] lord i don't want to look at anything
[1:48:01] intellectual and immoral god but i want
[1:48:03] to look at it through the eyes of faith
[1:48:06] lord i i don't want to live in this
[1:48:08] intellectual civilization lord
[1:48:10] but your prophet said in a place father
[1:48:12] that we'd be living in a faith
[1:48:13] civilization
[1:48:15] lord and i want to live in that faith
[1:48:16] civilization father
[1:48:18] i'm tired of looking at myself
[1:48:21] lord i believe each one here could say
[1:48:23] the same thing but we're going to look
[1:48:25] to you from now on lord
[1:48:26] we're going to be just like enoch and
[1:48:28] walk with you day by day step by step
[1:48:31] little by little lord it doesn't matter
[1:48:32] what all the things around us look like
[1:48:34] father but we're gonna look
[1:48:37] lord to the mark of the high calling set
[1:48:39] before us
[1:48:40] lord we just submit ourselves to you
[1:48:42] father this night
[1:48:43] we give you glory and honor
[1:48:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:48:47] pray
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:59] getting amen
[1:49:03] the pull i felt was more than i could
[1:49:08] have
[1:49:12] and i was on the verge of giving over
[1:49:20] the strength within myself just wasn't
[1:49:24] there
[1:49:28] something keeps holding me
[1:49:32] every day i see
[1:49:36] helping me faithfully
[1:49:39] to overcome my trials
[1:49:44] he's guiding me constantly
[1:49:49] giving me victory
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:53] is a
[1:49:54] reality
[1:49:56] cause something keeps holding me
[1:50:03] satan laid before
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:35] and something keeps holding me
[1:50:40] every day i see
[1:50:43] he's helping me faithfully
[1:50:47] to overcome
[1:50:52] he's guiding me constantly
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:08] amen
[1:51:10] i enjoyed that
[1:51:12] i thought
[1:51:14] there was such an outstanding
[1:51:16] statement that was
[1:51:18] made he said being under authority
[1:51:22] is what gives you
[1:51:25] authority
[1:51:27] just think of that
[1:51:30] you know we always want to prove it
[1:51:33] but if you come under authority
[1:51:37] the authority comes natural
[1:51:40] amen i thought what a wonderful
[1:51:43] uh
[1:51:44] revelation heading into our meetings
[1:51:48] if we could just
[1:51:51] bring ourselves
[1:51:53] under the authority of the world
[1:51:55] make contact with them
[1:51:58] then then we can put ourselves in
[1:52:00] position
[1:52:02] to see what god could do for us
[1:52:04] i i don't think there's
[1:52:07] anything that could be
[1:52:09] added to that i hope the beauty of the
[1:52:12] simplicity of it
[1:52:14] it does and even jesus says i do nothing
[1:52:18] except the father
[1:52:20] shows me
[1:52:22] i was fellowshipping just a little bit
[1:52:24] ago with somebody and i said jesus said
[1:52:27] the scripture says he learned obedience
[1:52:31] by the things he suffered
[1:52:34] i can't even wrap my mind around that
[1:52:39] but it starts
[1:52:43] being under authority
[1:52:45] gives you authority let's just think on
[1:52:48] that
[1:52:48] as we
[1:52:51] go forward that
[1:52:53] what a wonderful calling we have to
[1:52:56] come under this objection to be a
[1:52:59] to be a a bride and to
[1:53:02] love them and serve them and
[1:53:04] lord i i need that tonight that's my
[1:53:07] heart's desire
[1:53:09] hey man billy give us a song to sing
[1:53:12] and
[1:53:13] we'll have a word of prayer and we'll
[1:53:15] worship the lord and
[1:53:17] we'll be dismissed this evening take
[1:53:19] this word with you
[1:53:21] amen take we think it in your mind
[1:53:24] if i'm under authority it gives me
[1:53:27] authority
[1:53:29] if i'm obedient
[1:53:31] he'll take everything
[1:53:33] amen our gracious heavenly father
[1:53:38] lord what a wonderful
[1:53:41] word from you this evening
[1:53:46] to get the things in the right order in
[1:53:48] the right perspective
[1:53:51] father if we just
[1:53:53] come under your authority
[1:53:56] then
[1:53:58] whatsoever things we ask
[1:54:01] they shall be done
[1:54:04] oh god that's
[1:54:06] just such a rich thing
[1:54:09] lord i love that about the centurion he
[1:54:12] didn't say i am a man
[1:54:15] of authority
[1:54:17] but because i'm under authority
[1:54:20] i understand what authority is
[1:54:25] i've experienced god telling me do this
[1:54:27] and do that
[1:54:30] i know what it's like
[1:54:34] oh father
[1:54:35] i pray that in our each individual life
[1:54:38] that sets deep
[1:54:40] in our heart
[1:54:45] being under authority
[1:54:49] is what gives us authority
[1:54:52] granted lord jesus we pray
[1:54:54] in your precious name we pray amen god
