[Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it's a single course here in Reverse as we invite Roberto Mike to come out the whole song room this morning amen Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise for it was that brought my Liberty I do not know you just why he came to love me so long [Music] my Falls [Music] I shall foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] my form is [Music] go ahead and power heads I just want to welcome him his presence here this morning Heavenly Father we once again so grateful to you for your Mighty Works Lord put your hand upon our lives and Lord how each one of us could testify of how you came by our way Lord you did a work or you answered a prayer you made yourself known father we thank you for this time that we might come together now Lord put together our voices and our little our little lick of fire lord and Lord we just welcome your presence or we come with expectation Lord that you might see us here as you promised in your word Lord we pray that you would just have your way not just in the service but in each of our hearts Lord that your word would have the freedom to move and to work and to change and to transform Lord we love you we commit the service to you and we look forward to what you have for us we pray in Jesus name amen well Happy New Year I uh I realize I'm a little bit late to the party but uh you know Liz and I were talking the other day about how quickly the years just seemed to fly you know it seems like we're just wrapping up one New Year's Eve service and we're already planning the next and uh you find yourself asking where did the year go and you know the funny thing is is it's exactly the same number of days it's always been it's just hard to explain why but you know one of the things that people do at the turning point of each year is they set resolutions you know they try to use the new year to start restart a work you know they for some reason they use a date January 1st as the day that they're going to measure their progress or their condition and you know make commitments about some changes they're going to make or some new work they're going to perform and you know I guess the question is is why wait to January 1st what's wrong with May 3rd or October 17th they're when the Lord deals with your heart on something you know why our dates even the measurement we should be using and more than anything the new year is a reminder of how much creatures of time we still are you know we're so time-bound we tend to measure things by time you know whether something is successful or a failure we use time to decide that you know whether we use time to measure our progress on a journey or the progress of a work you know it's we tend to have our focus and our perspective change based on time you know and time is even our bodies are subject to they get tired they get worn out and they need rest because of time you know but if we're not careful we can measure God by time we can measure the effectiveness of his word by time or we can measure the progress that he's making by time but he's not a creature of time you know time is not the measurement he uses he uses his word his word is his measuring stick you know and we're not careful we can be tempted because of time to you know try to perform a work or change something or make a a change in a direction because we perceive that somehow time has an effect on the word you know the number of times the thing is is when God's word Goes Forth it begins to trigger everything to start to come in line with that word and the date on the calendar has nothing to do with it no matter how many times that calendar turns over you know during The Exodus when God was bringing forth his people out of that land of Egypt where they were and beginning to set them on that work to reposition them into their origin their land of origin he made an interesting statements to them in Exodus 11 2. as he's getting the people ready he says this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you no matter what day it was in Egypt no matter what their calendar said no matter what timeline they were using for the people of God they were now in a new timeline they were now governed by a new calendar whatever date it was in Egypt no longer mattered they were now governed instead of by the calendar of Egypt they were now governed by the timeline of the word you know progress for them was now based on thus saith the Lord you know God's people don't measure progress by time they measure it by his word you know their focus instead is on what he has done and what he has said he would do the change of the calendar has no bearing on that you know we're going to read a portion of Psalm 105 this morning Psalm 105 is a it was a Psalm of remembrance that David wrote when the Ark of the Covenant was returned to its rightful position Psalm 105 1-15 is the same as first Chronicles 16 8-22 word for word here you have the ark that which contained the word of God that which contained Resurrection Life that which contained the bread from heaven you know where the presence of the Lord could be found where you know is the place where God's people could inquire of the Lord and seek his leadership and rather than that presence being in their midst in the center of worship where it belonged it was out off in some Corner Fringe somewhere in some little house way off on the edge of the land and for so long it had not been the center of their lives and then here you know David comes to the throne and there begins to be this hour of restoration where the presence of the Lord is restored back in the camp it's brought in once again into a tabernacle of skin and it's set up and you know you can read in first chronicles 16 how everything was put in place according to the word where all the qualifications were met all the sacrifices and offerings were accepted preparation had been made and then it says in first chronicles 16 3 it says and he dealt to every one of Israel both man and woman to everyone a loaf of bread a good piece of fish and a flagon of wine so every person now was standing there in the presence of the Lord and in their own hand was their portion of that Word of Life all preparation had been made and it was here with the people in that position the children of God with all the sacrifices accepted the presence of the Lord restored in the camp them holding in their hand their portion it was then that David presents this psalm of resolution for the people you know those in Egypt might be setting up resolutions for new behaviors because the calendar has changed but the resolution of the people of God is one based on where they find themselves in position according to his word regardless of what the date is look at some of these resolutions that we're going to read in psalm 105. here's our resolutions give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing Psalms unto him Taki of all his wondrous works how are these for resolutions glory in His holy name seek the Lord and his strength seek his face forevermore remember His Marvelous Works which he hath done in the judgments of his mouth the resolution of the people of God based on the position where they found themselves you know our Focus isn't on dates and times our resolution is based on what he has done and what he said he would do our faith is thus saith the Lord and that's all in fact he deals with the time question in verse 8. he says he hath remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations a thousand Generations just for reference according to Matthew 1 the amount of time from Adam to Jesus was 42. Generations so a thousand generation long promise is still well within its expiration date amen his word came forth and it will be fulfilled our resolution is simply to give him thanks to call upon his name to make his deeds known to sing praises unto him to talk of his works to glory in his name to seek his face and to remember his works the continual resolution of the people of God so let's just read that portion together Psalm 105 1-15 together oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous Works Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord in his strength seek his face forevermore remember His Marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oh ye Seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth he hath remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath with Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm amen God bless you and have your seats before we just get into our song service we just want to welcome the family that's visiting with brother Marcos from Galena we just welcoming in our meds may the Lord bless you amen lesson

short testimony in a song officer brother Mark David we're going to invite Brother Jules to come after him or not thank you God bless you God bless you Church oh please part of my little story today I have a testimony oh um so uh you know as we are on on Woody but you know Gus Grace still you know goes and goes with us every single day uh so I remember you know me and my wife we talked to each other and we said look uh I'm done with two babies you know like I think thank God you know you're giving me the boy a girl um and I think I'm I'm good and um and the way my brain works my brain you know I think when my daughter is now seven I think my brain started to you know correlate with the way she talks now I I can't comprehend little babies uh so uh I told her I was like look no and then uh you know we started telling ourselves we started reinforcing that to say no more babies no more babies and we say okay good and I remember we talked about it in a particular day and when we went to sleep I just had to dream it was so real then I saw another boy in the dream and in the dream you know he was telling me Oh his name is Joshua Joshua and you know he was playing with my other son and I looked in the dream I was like oh God there's another one um so then I then I woke up and immediately you know sometimes you just dreaming sometimes you're probably just forgetting me maybe you ate too much at night and you went to sleep okay but immediately something told me you better call your wife and tell your wife you know because my mom is like you guys can still have one so I called my mom and my wife the next morning and said look I found another baby in the dream and his name is Joshua you know we started telling ourselves oh no no it's not going to happen and I remember we came to church in particular Sunday sitting down there the pastor was dedicating butter brother to Momo so I think his name is Danny it was dedicating his son and the pastor has never dedicated any of my kid his is always out in the field or maybe he travels and then he was dedicating the boy he is sitting down there that thing told me oh he's about he's going to dedicate one more boy for you I was like no and then we were driving home I told my wife what had come to me and say you know I talk to myself a lot this is what happened this is what I was seeing you know the baby hasn't even been in the picture and then it wasn't you know a few months after that I think couple of months after that I was just getting ready for work and you know my wife just dropped something on the bed and saying number three has entered the game I was like what gamer used I was like what game are you talking about and then you know it was you know then she was she had you know taken in I was like oh God in my mind I came back to life to say okay I already told you and I told you what his name is and so I was like okay no problem but in my mind you know the devil would say it's gonna be a girl I don't know what you're talking about that's a girl the boy is probably gonna come after so I was like so I went and no so I waited and then she we went she did the ultrasound you know very early you know my wife said you know she came back and said you got to pay me to know what the gender is I was like oh okay so I paid it you know to say okay but in my mind I've already you know I was certain I told her I was like yes I'm going to but I know what it's going to be um and then when she told me you know it was a boy you know I just uh want to use that testimony to say you know even though in in my state you know he still talks to me still shows us it's still loving to us it's still kind um you know we Far From Grace most of the time but he's still there to just pick us up and so for that I'm just very grateful so uh I want to sing this uh song bear with me I might not be in sync but uh we are Marching to Zion come we death love the Lord and let our Joys be known join in a song with sweet the

we are only a custodian although you've given us this baby to raise him in the right way in the will of the Lord and that's what we'll be accountable for Lord God Of Heaven I am here I can't do it by myself for we can't do it by ourselves Allah but we come here this morning and we dedicate this baby back to you Lord whatever is given back to you you will take full control so Lord this morning I'm dedicating little Joshua to you Allah may he grow in the admonition of the Lord may he be your lord like that Joshua in the Bible Lord Jesus that will conquer many grounds of law that will lead many Souls O Lord to the kingdom Lord Jesus Christ and we as well Allah may we O Lord teach him the right things to do may we lay a good example a good foundation bless it oh heavenly father bless thou all

the gift of Joshua to this family may he be like Joshua may be strong and of good courage and not be afraid for you will go with him wherever he goes father we ask you bless the whole family that it'd be an example in a shining light in this Dark Age that we live in Lord we commit him to you and we're thankful for him father and we ask that your hand continue to be upon us in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen God bless you this morning uh it it's certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord and I just wanted to um sister Lori you can stay and everybody else even state two I guess this because we're going to invite I'm not going to preach this morning brother Billy's going to preach but I wanted to talk to you for a moment this morning so uh I I just want to kind of give you a little update and an explanation and uh kind of uh let you kind of know where we're standing I know the other day I turned off the tape so I got a lot of phone calls from a lot of people about my health I'm just old other than that I think I can go as long as the Lord's got me on his calendar but if God wants to take me there's not enough doctors or medicines or anything to keep me here and I don't want to be here like Paul said he said I I would that I would go on but as long as it's better for you that I stay I'll stay and and then again if if you know if God's going to leave me here there ain't enough devils in the world to take me so I'm I'm here to serve him uh he's loved me through thick and thin he's uh the list of what he's forgiven me for is could wrap around the world four or five times he's just wonderful loving God that never failed and his word is undying and it it never comes back void I I want to just let you realize that you know that we're now entering very very close into uh the actual construction phase all the dirt work the dirt work would have all been finished but the their machine broke down so we have a little bit of more dirt to haul off and we'll be ready to start laying our Foundation I don't know if you noticed the color of that dirt out there it's very red or orange or whatever color you want it it will stain okay so it's not there to let your kids play in they'll have orange hands orange feet orange clothes you will have orange carpet you'll have orange dust in your cars parents please keep an eye on your children we're going to start having open ditches and lumber and and difficult places and narrow places to watch so it could be the best that you can uh be aware of what that we're going through ask as we make certain construction moves uh we will have to close and open different sections of the parking if you come in and you're one of the first people's here park is close to the curb to either your right or left as you can don't pull in and just park in the middle okay start at one end imagine the lines you know what I mean and and then just with your imagination just park you know decently so we can get 12 cars in a place where we're getting six now uh don't be afraid to park in the far parking lot just remember you used to walk all the way from the church down the street so uh that was to get you all in shape and so you could make the walk from the back of the parking lot when the church is after the church is constructed the bridge back here and that pathway will no longer be available you will have to walk around so I I believe that a lot of people call it training your mind so you can start training yourself to walk around the parking lot to the church it's safer and better so uh we just want to throw that out there it's very important uh you know because we don't want anybody Falling In Ditches or getting slivers from boards or stepping on nails or all those uh different things so let's all be mindful uh that there is construction going on let's watch and keep safe like I know little boys like to jump on machines you know don't go jumping on the bulldozers or or any of things like that so we want to let you know that also we want to give you an understanding of the direction that we're heading in in what's taking place uh right now we're in a building that is about 4995 square feet that's the size of the building uh that we're in now and it takes us about 33 000 a year to pay the expenses on this building uh and that's the uh and that's for the electricity the gas the water the telephone the internet the supplies the repairs and uh so that so we haven't had a mortgage it over the last uh year or so and uh so uh we haven't had a mortgage payment so we've been able to move the money that we normally would have for a mortgage payment into the building fund so our our total offerings uh last year was about 154 thousand dollars that's what everybody contributed 36 000 of that was from one donor Okay so so if if that 36 000 was taken out of the picture we would have received about a hundred and twenty one thousand dollars in offering last year so if if you you you you take that out basically so what we would have received with that uh taken outs about 121 000. so if we would deduct the 33 from the hundred and eighteen thousand give us about eighty five thousand dollars so I want the reason I'm saying this with something in mind not necessarily to give a financial report but to make us all aware of something so if we add the mortgage what our mortgage we anticipate our mortgage to be around 80 around 78 000 a year and we we bring back we add the existing expenses that would be about a hundred and eleven thousand dollars a year and that would give us maybe a ten thousand dollar margin but the size of the building is going to Triple so we're going we're we're going from uh uh just about uh fourth uh four thousand nine hundred and something to fifteen thousand two hundred square feet so I think you can do the math you know every time I drive by one of those great big gigantic houses I think man what's their mortgage and then my second thought is what's their electric bill what's their gas bill what's their water bill so our our expenses won't triple but they'll increase significantly so I want you to be aware of this that we're moving from 4995 feet to fifteen thousand two hundred and at 80 square feet basically now you have been wonderful faithful givers and you know I don't come to you and talk about money and I don't beg for money many many things I reach into my pocket and take care of I'll I'll just be honest with you we helped with over uh sixty thousand dollars of medical bills for people last year probably another thirty five thousand dollar in rent and bill payments so that wouldn't have been made possible without you your great wonderful givers but I want to give you a fact that I want you all to understand I don't know who they are but only 60 percent of our adult wage earners contribute to the church okay only six out of ten not talking about children six out of ten adult wage earners or 60 percent contribute to the church so what's happening is 60 percent of us are building the church 60 of us that give are building the church for the 40 percent that don't give and those are people that sometimes visit there's people they come periodically but we want them here I want the 40 here because I want them to get saved and and so we don't need any more money from those of you that are giving but we need those that haven't been giving and understand that the responsibility that someone's heating is someone's going to provide padded seats for you someone's going to cool you somebody's going to give you water somebody's going to give you a place to change your diapers somebody's going to give you a place to to take your children a playground for your kids to play on a place for you to park you know you might just take it for granted but somebody's worked hard to do that and so if if everybody would carry their weight it would be later for us all and and so uh I mean I could read the scripture I had it marked here you know uh the the scripture said and I say this to you if you want to read a wonderful portion of scripture that absolutely describes the age we're living in and the blessings for keeping God's word and the curses for not keeping God's word and a wonderful scripture that explains the atmosphere and the hour that we live in read the prophecy of Malachi The Book of Malachi uh absolutely I I was reading it this morning and it it it it just stunned me it literally stunned me what was what was transpired and how the the people make it for example in the fourth verse it says for behold the day cometh fourth chapter for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord a hosts and it shall be letting them it shall leave them neither root nor offspring but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you know we'd go on and read it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet what a wonderful day that we live in but kid there's also other scriptures in here about not keeping my commandments so one it says will a man rob God and yet ye have robbed me the Lord says but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings and he says and ye are cursed with the curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation you know in my experiences I've lent a lot of money and 90 percent of the people that come for funds are people that don't tithe or give offering I can't tell you the blessing of giving you know what I mean I mean I I it doesn't matter if it's a quarter in the Salvation Army bucket that's wonderful it's wonderful to give you cannot out give God you can't do it you can't do it but I I know that the the Lord has blessed you and we're not a rich people we're all Working Class People we don't have big business owners that have large amount of profits and act that every one of us most all of us have jobs we're wage earners it's hard to make time the cost of living has gone up uh almost 10 percent everything costs more than it ever cost before I know that's a burden but the Lord made a promise he said I'll pour out a blessing upon you that you can't contain so uh not only uh is it you're you're tithing which we try to use for the glory of the kingdom of God but in your offerings too and so I know sometimes people just pay their ties but just remember they both were canned in hand together just give what you can sacrifice you know what I mean if it's a set amount that's up to you there's no formula for sacrifice there's no formula forgiving but we never want to do it we want to do it with a joyful heart but I want you to know that I think this morning in our building here we probably they've counted them up we have some maybe somewhere between 350 and 360 people in this building this morning counting in the back and and I know some of my friends from Galena are here somewhere so the blessing to have them amen God bless you and but we got to do this together you understand and so I so those of you that have been faithful thank you continue the good work for those of you that haven't put your heart into it and you're worried about making ends meet and you're worried about those things I can say this to you as thus saith the Lord I've never seen the righteous big bread so put God first love them with all your heart keep his Commandments if you can give to help provide for yourself and those that are around you give with a joyful heart but so I'm I'm not asking those of you that have been faithful to get do any more than what you're doing I'm just asking those of us that haven't put a little effort into it if you just do your little part I think we can make it just fine amen and that about as gentle as I can say it you know what I mean I I this is not a comfortable subject uh for me to talk about uh a money I don't I don't do it often uh but I do know you can't I'll give God and we can give you a more thorough report I wasn't a financial report this morning so to speak that's the trustees job but I I wanted you to know that somebody's providing for you to have a place to sit so if you'll take care of your spot God will bless you and we want to have a place where people can

thought that I've I've taken I I didn't really this morning want to talk about uh finals and money and the building and things like that and try to switch gears into preaching but I think it's very needful that we're all aware of what that we're going into you know what I mean and and uh and like you know you saw what Egypt did when all the Israelites were putting their shoulder roll they built great pyramids and they did all these great things but one day Israel went to the promised land amen I want to go to the promised land don't you I want to take everybody that God's called to get there

sharing the gospel with who will ever listening providing this message in whatever media form tape book recording website I don't know all that there are all that we can to let this world understand that there was a voice that came to guide us through the darkness not an intellect a voice a voice in the days of The Voice the mysteries of God shall belt revealed the secrets of the heart will be

evening service a lot of times the brothers have to be in service and then in between service they they run home and they prepare a sermon and they get ready but I I thought I would do that this morning get ready for this evening service and those of you that can return back we'll have a wonderful time in the Lord amen you love his word I love his word he's so good amen I'm trying to think of a song oh I always I I can't even if I could can't even think of the words that but anyway sister Lori just give me a song We'll sing for brother Billy amen [Music] I guess we're going to sing Amazing

gracious father are we so thankful to be gathering your house Lord in your presence father God we want to commit ourselves back to your hands and invite you right now that you come in you break the bread of life Lord father your word is life unto us and father we pass this morning that the portion that you had allocated Lord for this morning that you may give it to us Lord we thank you Lord and we know that all our differences all our trials and father all of the human problems that we have Lord that your word will fix it for us Lord because you promised that when we step into their presence Lord that you will take care of not just of our spiritual but even our natural Lord we ask this morning you speak to us according to your word in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray and ask amen amen God bless you this morning man are you happy to be in the house of God Amen I would just like to ask you a man to realize that anything that happened right now from right now you can reset your clock to 10 30. we've just stepped into eternity and all the time before it's just time amen let's open our Bibles in this small scripture reading this morning men will try not to be too long we'll just take the time we need and and uh we'll do that yeah I feel you familiar scripture reading John 3 16 it says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life let me read it again for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that so ever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life father we ask you you bless your word to us Lord we commit ourselves to your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you and have your seats this morning thank you mind this uh for just a few minutes like I said I want I'll try not to be too long um as we read the scripture I was inspired by what our pastor has been preached last time about the Capstone love and and as I began to look at it and it's something uh perhaps this morning we'll just try to be on this uh if something just came through my heart and it became almost a realization that it's the when you when you speak about Capstone love you have to also understand that the it's not just love that caps it off but it's also love that begins all everything so in other words it's the love that begins it is the love that ends it uh but one of them says oh the scripture will tell us that Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone but yet he's the same Jesus who comes and is the very Capstone that comes upon the church so if you don't begin in love you won't end in love if you're beginning something else whatever you begin with you'll end with but if you begin in love it will end in love also and so it's the same that started the work the same God who started the work the same God will bring it to a finish we don't have to worry this morning and come and say well I believe I became a Christian what is my ending going to be no the same Jesus by love who came in to rescue you the same Jesus who came and made himself known unto you the same Jesus is here to take you to the Finish Line love is the motivation of it all love is what God is using in order for him to bring this to an achievement so when we get together when we we look at ourselves we have to also understand every time that this is about the love of God it's not about our ability but his love that brought us together I was even thinking when we we think of ourselves when we uh by the love of God and by the grace of God when we get to the other side we're never going to sit down and talk about all the Mysteries oh do you what do you think about that mystery over there what do you think about no it's going to be the love that works it all together oh the love you can go in a very specific and detail of each and every one of us and how that love orchestrated your birth and love came to you and protected your parents and your grandparents and love came and made a way that he would come and meet with you and bring you into his kingdom it was love that did all of that so as we read the scripture says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that would so ever believe in him should not perish but have eternal life oh I was reading this and I was uh studying the message that bravanan preached love and and another one that he called when love is project uh projected and I want to give for a title this morning uh God's love projected will produce Grace God's love being projected will always produce Grace and and the capping and basically the foundation and the caps Stone being both love and Venom will make a statement and he says in that message you would say uh speak about the the the text it would say oh perhaps this some doesn't seem to be much more of a text in it it's just such a short reading as you would say but he said oh I wonder if we understand if we know the value of the text we just read oh if the Christians we would I thought about even us this morning will took a Bible we read or even when you were at home but David came here and he talked about how he was reading in the Book of Malachi then he read and and all those things and whether you would ask yourself did I really understand the value of what I'm reading or you do I even understand who whose words am I reading in the Bible when I read and when I come in contact with a Bible or when I come to church and the word of God is being preached do I have the full understanding of what's really taking place at that moment he would want us to come into an understanding that as We Gather here this morning that we are reading the word of a living God this is not someone who got excited and they wrote it down and he said well you know we'll do this for Good Conduct and we'll write this so people can behave goodly but this is the word of the Living God the same God who said the letter B is the same God who wrote the word that we have read this morning the same God who created heaven and earth is the same one who brought this down that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son in other words the same word has the creative power than the word that was in the beginning that it's the expression of the same God it speaks about the same God it speaks about the doing of the same God trying to get to an objective oh my if we would come it would it would you would come this morning and he will say here it says oh now uh I I know he says this little piece of paper half inch square would not be worth any picking up on the streets it says but it wasn't the value of the paper it's the value that lays in what's on the paper the value of what's on the paper uh he talks about the little boy who who went and it went up in the attic and collected a stamp and he took that stamp and to the little boy all he wanted was an ice cream corn what all he wanted was something that can just something small that he could satisfy himself with and he took it to a collector and collected gave him and he went and he he got an ice cream and he that that was satisfying for him but yet the collector knew the value of it and he knew he could get 50 bucks for it and that's all he got for it but yet as you go down the line there was one who thought it was most valuable and he got a quarter million dollar for the same step the same stamp that was in the hand of the boy the same step that was in the collector's hand the same stamp ended up costing a quarter million dollars in other words it's the same word that you have this morning it's not a different word if you need salvation it's in the same word the question question is what value are you putting in the word what value to what value do you get into the word if you come this morning some came in just for healing they got healing some came for salvation not all they got but I'm here to announce to you that it's more than that it's the Mighty God of presenting himself and moving into the midst of his people and I want to say this morning the true love is the understanding that it's not about what I'm looking for but it's about the understanding of what God is trying to achieve with his word the same word and he says it's not the value the peppers were not worth but it's the value that you put that that's that's not on the paper and then it says that's the way it is with the word of God it isn't just a paper that's that's wrote on it but the value of it it's because the word of God it says because it's the word of the Eternal God it's the word of the Eternal God and Jesus says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never shall never fail therefore John 3 16 tonight it says although small in its portion holds enough value to save the world oh my it holds enough value to save the world so whatever you have need of just throw it in there whatever problem you have in the morning just throw it in there whatever you have need of this morning just throw it it has enough power within that same word that I don't you don't need to know the entire Bible just that one verse is enough to save the entire world it says and then he says it's it's got enough value in it to heal every sick person that's on Earth today it's the it says it's a part it's it pardons it pardons for every sinner it's Joy to the weary person it's a it's the hope for the Hopeless it's food for the Saints it's healing to the sick it's a pardon for those who are troubled and all those things that you you that all those things to you if you receive that so it's all of those things to you if you receive that one word of God therefore we have to come this morning with an understanding I'm here receiving the word of God and whatever I have need of the word of God is able to give it to me the word of God is here sent to me to make me what God desired for me to be in the end time the word of God has been provided in order to bring the atmosphere of faith for us to receive it and be transformed by it oh so for so God God so loved the world that he only that he that he gave his only begotten son it says that whosoever believe in him will not perish but have eternal life I want to say this the love the word or the love of God as we we read it is it says we we as Christians we must it's not something that we learn in school the the love of God it's not something that someone will take a pen and a paper and begin to write off it and say oh the love of God is this and you understand and say oh yeah I I understand what he's trying to say no the love of God is something that one has to come in contact with to have an understanding of it the love of God is something that happens to you an individual where God allows you to drop into a mind of his mind and begin to understand the things that he has done oh my to to look at yourself this morning and realize that I was born a sinner I was born in sin and and Champion iniquity and came into the world speaking lies but here I am today standing in the congregation of saints it takes the love of God for you to even understand that uh because it's the love that sought you it's a love that came and redeemed you is the it's a love that came when when you were about to die and things was to happen and and the situation seems like there was no light at all and and you seemed like it was the end of you the love of God made a way for you to be here so therefore when we get together let's not look at this in some theology or understanding of man oh John is writing about a law we need to go and study about this law no this is something that God is wanting for you to get in contact with this morning so you can understand what he's talking about so it's the love that came and that redeems The Sinner and it comes and he lives in 99 and and come after one and oh I tell you where if you ever been in sin and been stuck in the place where you know that there's no way I can get out of here there's no way I can get myself out of this situation then you understand what the love of God is oh my oh it's overwhelming I'll say it's overwhelming it's a love that you could think and it's the love that's why we you you can't really understand even how someone is converted until you understand the love of God that's why you can't even preach the gospel unless you understand the law and that's why you cannot be a Christian unless you understand the love because it's the same love that you want extended to others when you yourself have come in contact with that love and you've realized that if it's not God I won't be here if it wasn't for him I would have been dead if it wasn't for him I wouldn't I would have never been allowed to even hear the word of God when you come to that understanding it changes your mindset about Humanity because what you desire is for every person on the face of the Earth to come in contact with us saying love oh my oh my that scripture says it will say oh for God so loved the will that he gave you know he gave his only begotten son I begin to to think about it and oh my I was just sitting there just overwhelmed me even just dwelling on that one verse that God so loved the world and I want to say this oftentimes we get it even Twisted within our own mind when we read that God so loved the world what what God what God loved is not the buildings that we see out here it's not the prevention that we see out here it's not what man has done with the atmosphere and the pollution that's out there that's not what caught love but oh if you can think about the beginning God with his creation and the scripture says in Genesis that God came and it was the spirit upon the water and he will look at it and he began to brood upon it to bring us forth his sin let me say this creation has never ended because you are supposed to come in and when God said God loves all of the world it was you that he was thinking about it was he knew that he had seen so was to come into existence he knew that he had sons and daughters that had not come to existence yet that he would take time that it would take time and in the end time it will have a people call upon his own name and and who he is and his mercy and forgiveness that's the world that God loved that's a wall that he died for because the scripture will tell us that he says that the kingdom of God is like a man who finds a field he says he will sell all he will buy the whole field so he can redeem the whole prize so he bought the whole world he created the whole world for the purpose of having a bride oh my if we can only understand that it's not the sin and the dragon the alcohol or the perversion and the things of the world that God is interested in but you you it's the thing his process of creation his process of bringing forth his children Satan came and he broke forth we know the prophet will tell us oh let me just shrink it for the sake of time that that that it was Adam there were to bring Child by the spoken word but that didn't happen why because the devil came and he thought he messed up the program of God but God within himself he couldn't let his love obligated him to do something about it let me tell you love has obligation love will see something to go through love will build the bridge where there is nothing Love Will Make A Way when there's no way well love will make sure that whatever was promised will come to pass it's not uh the Judgment it's love that does that if we can understand this morning that we sit here because God purposed within himself that he would have a people and his love obligated him to do that oh my the prophet will say this is perhaps the best known scripture in the Bible it says it's referred to many times as the golden text of the Bible and it deals with love and it says and I have had the privilege to preach the gospel many many to many many uh hidden lands he says and I've heard the the theories but I've never seen nothing yet that would come that would come up to the Christian love of God nothing yet they'll tell you how someone did some great things and how they're even they will talk about the sacrifices that a person did but nothing will ever come close to what the love of God is it says no one could explain it the poet that's tried to do it the songwriters the failed ministers could never do it it says in another place he spoke about even the the what God was in question and answer he says and God was this great spirit we picture him like seven colors of rainbow that covers it says the bow that he says the bow would actually cover the Earth if it distract the Earth it says it's like a water it's like water in a circle of the curvature of the earth it says what makes it but now it says God is eternal he was perfect it says perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect sacrifice it says all those Spirits all those Spirits all those Spirits as we get in the Revelation they came out and was made out with perfection and I want to say this anything that was outside of God was not God and and and I want to say this because when we read this perfect love perfect everything love and I want to say this love is perfection often time when we speak about perfection our mind about perfectionist we've gathered together and we have a painting here and everybody looks at it and says what do you think and we all come to a conclusion oh that's perfect that's that's good we like The Strokes and everything and all the art lovers will look at it and will appreciate it all the known art lovers will look at it they'll just be something that struck the eye that looks nice that's not perfection because Perfection is not anything to do with the one who's watching Perfection has everything to do with the Creator himself Perfection is in the eyes of the one who made it Perfection is what I've designed what I've made is it fulfilling the reason why I made it but when I will talk about Michelangelo who made the Statue and everything he had he had a thought in his mind the prophet will say and he will come and it will strike the the the the the the the the the the the the stone and it will strike it it says until it match what was in his mind when he matched what was in his mind Oh my he wanted it to come so much alive why because it was the exact picture that was in his mind that's Perfection oh my and God in this end time he's working up a bride and he's working and I want to say this it's not for you to look and look at the scripture say well I don't do this I don't do this but purpose is are you fulfilling the reason why God placed you here and he's the one that judges the Perfection he's the one that perfects it he's the one that brings what's missing he's the one who's working on this masterpiece so he can bring it into this image he says when he looked at Jesus Christ he was so perfect that he smid him he came and he smiled his own his own work so why because he was perfect to him he says speak and the right came out of him as we know that oh my so when we look at ourselves we have to always look according to the scripture so I want to say this morning it's important as Christian that we walk in love and our Focus be on the love of God that suttered everything Paul was speaking First Corinthians 13 it says though I speak in tongues of men and angels and I have no charity I have not charity I'm like a sounding Bryce in the tingling symbol it says and no I have the gift of Prophecy and understanding and understand all the mysteries in all knowledge and though I have all faith now see I want you to see the positioning of what Paul is putting on love above everything else eat the positioning of tongues and interpretations and the ability to speak mystery to understand Mysteries to teach the understanding of the entire Bible but it says before all of that could lay be laid the foundation has to be loved so he says and so I could remove remove mountain and have not charity I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned oh my what a sacrifice what a what a giving of yourself it says and I have no charity it Provident nothing charity suffers long and is kind charity envious not charity wanted not it says and perfect up and not puffed up it says do not behave itself unseemingly seek it not her own honor is not easily provoked and thinketh now evil so yeah and it says Rejoice not for uh Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth it says bearing all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never fail but whenever it says but whether the there be a prophecy they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whatever they can where there be knowledge it shall vanish away so in other words is admonishing us this morning if you were to be a believer if you were planning to make it to the end if you were planning to be in this race for a long time if you're planning to be a Christian who's full of the gift of the spirit one who can make it to the end one who's not going to fail in every place he says you have to make sure that you start with Charity with the love of God in your heart and let me say this this love is not a human love that we gave by reading the Bible this love starts off by the new birth of the spirit of God where you get the love of God into your heart and that's what begins everything but Paul is here to tell you that after you you you you you you you've come in contact with this Mysteries with understanding with knowledge and with the understanding of all whether your sacrifice and all of those things make sure that your foundation for all those things is love because all those things let me say that sadness and impersonator of everything he can impersonate everything but the only thing he cannot impersonate is love he doesn't have genuine love within it he can do Miracles he can do signs he can speak in tongue and do all of those things and those things are wonderful but what you need to do is to understand what is the motive behind those things oh my that's the kind of love I want to have but why not says give me a church that doesn't know anything that doesn't have anything but as long as they have love within their heart why because love will build all the other things out love will bring kindness love will help the others love will heal love will deliver love will bring all of those things it's not about heaven or things it's about having love because all those things can be brought forth by love in Hebrews he says Paul said I could speak in tongues of men and Angel both thanks both things that that is understood and tongues that cannot be understood and has to be interpreted it says I'm nothing I have the if I have the gift of knowledge and understand our wisdom and explain the Bible let me slow down a little bit for The Interpreter sorry I was thinking that this morning and then I came I just took off sorry it says I am nothing he says that don't be that don't do much good to go to school then does it it says and learn the Bible he says though I have faith I can move Mountain healing campaigns don't mean much does it nothing though I give my body to be burned as sacrifice this is the prophet repeating the Scripture it says oh I say I say that man is religious but it's nothing Paul says whatever when it never become nothing it says for where they stung they see they they shall cease where there's prophecies they shall fail where there is other things they say things will fail but but that which program says this but when that which is perfect is come I like this so he takes one scripture he jumps you right away into another scripture he says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with now remember the age of the Capstone so we're here then one that is perfect has come it doesn't mean do away rejected but swallowed up into the hole by listen to what he says that which is perfect he says what is perfect love what is love God let us laid all this little dead works and ordinance and go on to Perfection let us move into the greater love of God let us move I'll tell you this you can do more with love that you can do with anything what Abraham says that one place love is the greatest weapon that we ever have it says what this world needs today is love oh my you know we hear this morning and and gather up in the house of God and and no doubt if he has a pastor give a report we need this we need that or if love could just raise within our heart all these things are nothing because why love is the greatest weapon Love Will Make A Way love will come this morning and touch somebody's heart and love will come and provide it I'll tell you this if you love somebody it will show if you love somebody it will show if you love somebody love will affect that person but when I will come so many times in so many meetings he said or I look at the person they don't have shoes and they don't have anything and it says oh look at him and I'll put my foot next to minor will my shoes feed him and well what is that love at work it's love what can happen it's love trying to find a way for that person and you will look and he will look and and after a while love will come in his heart and he will speak the word and God will come in the same oh my it says you see we are perfect through Christ how do we get in by Holy Spirit baptism it says all right what happened you've passed some dead death unto life well I shake I jumped I jumped to I jumped and do it then it says you don't have to do nothing I I like the piece that comes with love I like the calmness that comes with love but but Brennan will talk about we we call them and I'll just jump through the end now we talk about the manifestation of the third pool but one of them talks about the killable he said I I all of a sudden I jump in and I I didn't remember and they said about I jumped in and I was about to cross it says there was a man killed just the other day he jumped in and he says and he saw the bull he said I tried to reach for my gun I didn't have it it says thank God I didn't have it you see what the love of man will do to you it would rush to some judgment it will try to get to some solution real quick and everything but then when he realized he didn't have it he only used the only thing he left he said I stood there I said I don't want to die a coward I'll just face him and wait and everything and then he said but all of a sudden I didn't fear no more all of a sudden perfect love kicked in and he said he began to speak within his own heart perhaps I was not supposed to come and disturb you and and all those things and all those things and he said he came and he began to camera and he had no fear and about five feet he stopped What stopped him it was love within the heart it wasn't some power he didn't go up and scream and say you ball you are an animal I'm supposed to have power over you and all those things no he had compassion for that bull he understand that he was the one who was in the wrong that he was perhaps not supposed to be there he understood that I am the one that is supposed to be the master but guess what we do we put the blame on somebody else oh it's his fault it's not one fault he is the one who started it that's why I did too and he's the one that's not love that's not love that's not going to get you anywhere What You Need Is God to wash your heart and to fill you with the love of God oh so many times I understood why brother Barnum will say oh that evil get there at the end and you will look at me and you will kick me to hell I'll still love him after I've done all of this and I get there and he looks at me and he kicks me to hell I'll still worship Him because there was nothing left but the love of God within the heart and I want to say this we can do more with the love of God that we can do with anything else but a bill and Paul stood here many times they will tell us how but you couldn't tell the difference between an enemy and a friend he treated everybody the same why because if we if we're willing to be the students of this message let's just not run with the scriptures and the word and the quotes and everything let's not forget to take love with us so we can because because it's love that brought all those things into existence it's the love that brought all those mystery to come to pass if we have the same love God will bring about the same manifestation but if I'm going to say one place like I said I won't be able to finish it says he says one place he says what the church has forgotten is love is love he says you had said because say love one another he says now everybody wants to be loved and I tell you the truth I do I want God to love me I want the people to love me that's exactly the truth and if God loves me then the people will love me and if I love his people then he will love me for doing it now I want you to understand what he's tying it all together I like how he does that he says God would rather you love would rather you love you love than love him did you know that I would write a you love my boy and now he's saying that to say God whether you love one another then love him it says did you know our director you love my boy back here no matter what you say about me I want you to love my children and any father would think that so God so father God think the same thing for he said in so much as you have done unto this little the least of this my my little ones you have done it unto me so if you want to love God just start loving all his children you need to say the guy that you go on the closet and lift your hands and worship and all of that yeah he says you want to love me love my children love the person that's sitting next to you and it didn't just stop about this church love is children everywhere love them manifest that Same Love and then he says this and God will reward you if you will just love his children that shows that you love God that the love of God is in you now that brings sin down home you know because often time when we look at the human love the love is attached to oh you know who is it that it's in the same Circle as I am and you know love one that you know you think you can get along with you know love those that dress like you dress and those that speak like you speak and those that seem to be in the same social class that you are those that you know that seem to understand you the most that's not what he said you know it's the human love that always gets us in trouble because he says that's the kind of love that if someone would mess with your wife you would want to kill him but he said by the agape love will cause you to pray for that person that the Lord May save him so therefore it's important we understand we don't get this love by just reading on or doing this we we have to come in contact with this Jesus the one who so loved the world and and and when you come in contact with him he augments because remember this this uh a statue of a perfect man is the building forth of the foundation they there's not a step where you have to go without love everything has to be by love every stone that has to be and then he is the capping of the storm that comes upon it to confirm the very Foundation law that was established but what I'm saying is that oh man will know that you are my disciple when you've got love one for another the world is so thirsty that of that for that friends and God is love and still we can get brotherly love it says we'll never get very far from God we need a Revival of Love among God's children now there's one place and perhaps I won't have time to get there what what I'm well speaking it says that yeah we are we can come and we can do Mighty things and we can do all of that but he says but if it's not done in love it's of not so I want you to just picture that for a moment this morning you will sit here and the preacher will come and you will preach and everything in the service will go on with the songs and everything but he says that if you do all of that and you don't do it by love it means nothing in other words it will not produce something that's worthwhile it will not be it will not produce something that will stay on the Firm Foundation it will produce something that would fade away it's either done by Pride or because I want people to see how I could speak or how I could present it so that or that but it says the foundation has to be loved it said somebody told me not long ago but right now it says you know what happened it says this great organization is is this great organization I was talking about it says they always sponsor you you know what they did they ousted you then they he says they want nothing to do with you no more I said they drove down their stake and said nobody received brother Branham anymore this is 19 and 61 in the message the Queen of Sheba now he says I said well I drove mine down and I went and it says and away I went past I went I went way past them and I took them in it says they just they says they just all of it that's all it says I take my name because listen to this because a lot of God's children are in there there's a lot of God's children in there now I I I want you to see the approach because this is the man who was invited to a meeting and he's getting ready to come up on the platform and the person comes say oh but my name was called away and he's not able to come and preach when I I will I will let me just stop there you can add your own imagination to it now I I want you to see how far this love goes because I said it's a love you can't explain it you can't understand it you can put it together it's unfathomable it's the it's the unending love the only way you know it is to come in contact with it yeah there he is and and it will stand there and say oh no brother I don't want to kill the brother's reputation and you know you know God put him there and I don't want nothing to do and he walks away this is a man this is a man who would come at the border they will ask him do you have such a such no he drives away and drives back miles and miles away to come and make it right now I'm not talking about William Bryant the prophet I'm talking about William Brennan the man because if love is not in there we it's the work is in vain if the the love the the love of God is not in there it would not produce anything this is the man that comes and he and he's mowing his yard and then and he comes and he's he doesn't have a shirt on and he comes and there's a there's a harness a place and he comes in by accident it touches it and they come off swarming and everything and he comes and he apologized to them he said oh I I didn't mean to disturb you I am so sorry I I did this I didn't really mean to do this I apologize now some of the things they have to sing can because we hear we read the word of God and we go out to oh I want to conquer the world I want to do this but you have to understand what love are you going with is it just your human understanding or are you uh standing there and say Lord I I want to be filled so much with love that even if I'll go something happening that it's not being me reacting to the situation it will not be or myself coming on the surface and trying to defend myself that it will be the love of God that will come on the scene that's why I say this morning love will build the bridges where there's no Bridge love will change your circumstance this morning Lord the love will make a way where there's no way Love Will Repair what's broken love will bring back the the Perfection of God into his church oh my oh my God what about I'm gonna say it says and I say this tonight as a minister of the Gospel we've seen it tight it said and I had a little privilege to preach around the world before ten thousands of people and and it says and and and every Divine promise in the Bible is true it says if you'll take the right man to Latitude towards God any Divine promise you will bring it upon to come to pass if you can take the right mental attitude but listen to this it says and in it says and in our scripture reading tonight God so loved the world is there it says is there anything that if there's anything that the world is dying for today is love it says in my travel I found out that is the rejected Stone the rejected Stone that keeps the building from being fitted together the rejected Stone that keeps the building from being built fitted together it says another place it says we need love God so loved the world that he gave you for only beguns and Son now he projected love when love is projected what is love projected in other words what is it that you're projecting When Love is projected when love goes out when the heart that's going out is the heart of God When Love is being projected it says it comes down to the end Sovereign Grace produces what love projected oh I love that there's no better English word you can put it and I remember Brother David preached this long ago a while back a couple of months a year or so I go away talks about Grace he says Grace is when the decision is already made and the judgment is already about to be pronounced and you've done and you deserve the judgment and then in executive order comes from the turn of God it says I will change it what changes that is Grace that's been projected it's love that's been projected When Love is projected Grace steps in to make a way and brother says that's how we got Jesus that's how we got Jesus if you ever know how did you get Jesus how did Jesus come to the world why did he come to the world it was love that was projected and When Love Was projected Grace created something and Jesus came on the same oh my the prophet said I used to think that God hated me and that Jesus loved me and then later on I find out that Jesus was the very heart of God my brother my sister let's not forget it this morning in love that drives everything it's love that brought you here this morning it's the love of God that you will get you to the Finish Line it's the love of God without it we cannot do nothing God bless you let's all stand this morning foreign [Applause] I don't know about you but I want my love to be kept this morning I feel like I just needed a little more this morning I feel like I just need another injection of love another major just measure of love and that I can love my neighbor as myself that I could do the work of God that he would want me to do that we could all walk together within our love oh I tell you this love that's why it says love covers a multitude of sin them if you see love you don't see any mistakes all you see is opportunity for improvement I I I read this someone said stay away from negative people because they always find a problem for every solution stay away from negative people because they always find a problem for every solution we can do this oh no that's not gonna work because of this because of this we can no no no no no I don't want to be that kind of person I want to come to the Church of God with positivity in my heart I want to come knowing that the Lord will speak to me I want to know I'm part of something that God is building I want to know I'm part of the love of God that he's here bringing us together to fulfill the end time word to fulfill the end time prophecy I'm here to know that God is keeping us with his love that we can function by love we can save my love we can heal by love and not because we have a point to prove we have no point to prove he's already proved everything we just hear about the love like that man who came to tempt him on the platform but one of them said I this this is shocking he said I understood the man it's just a man like me he wants to eat and drink he probably have a family how do you do that a man who came to cause all kind of chaos and everything well aren't you gonna cut him out in the name of Jesus send him to hell right away no that's what love will do to you I don't know about you I want to be a love slave one who's driven by the love of God within the heart and he looks at a man and he says you challenge the Holy Ghost he said I Heard a Voice just came out of me he said I didn't fear him even though he could just take me and break me into pieces I just looked at him and I felt sorry for him it says you challenged the Holy Ghost she'll be at my feet I I feel like we have to get to a place where we understand we have nothing to prove we have to stand if he said it just stand there your mind is gonna rise against you how about this you know what I don't have nothing above I'm just doing his will I'm just if if he blessed me here he'll provide for it if he called you here he'll provide for him whatever the need is he's here if he bless you he'll he'll provide for us whatever we have need as a congregation as a people if he placed us here he'll provide for it you just be filled with the love of God within your heart and let it move upon the scene our gracious father how we're so thankful for your word oh God Lord all we need is just for you to move once again in our heart and just fill us with your love oh God and father God that we may be so on fire lord motivated by your love to do the things we do not because we have to do it not because it becomes a burden but the love of God in our Heart Lord father I know you know the need of each and every one none of us would have been here if he wasn't for your love so I pray that you operated to provide for us this morning we love you Lord with all our heart and that's just things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's just

answer but this I know with all my heart his wounds have paid my Ransom that's when you know the love of God no matter what our faults are failures well we were yet a sinner is when he died for us that's the love he has no wonder he says he says you have freely been given to you freely give certainly [Music] He Who has forgiven been forgiven much loves much I think that's just a beautiful [Music] understanding that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son it's always a reminder to us bring it back to Calvary yes [Music] that's God's provided place of worship there's only one place you can worship Him that's under the shed blood in other words under the projection of the love that he had for you it's the only place you can worship gifts power all those things we'll do be Lord so desires us do but let us move on to perfection I believe that with all my heart that's what I want I feel in my heart a lot of times that I remember many times I've heard this statement that it hurts me more than it hurts you Love's corrective but if you have love it pains the corrector just as much as it pains the one corrected but it's not Peaceable at the time but it brings forth rich peace amen let's have that one for another let's have it for Sinners that would come through the door no matter who it is if you look at yourself you were unlovable but he loved you amen let's I think it's a lovely lovely remembrance of why that we're here in fact the very Foundation is the very Capstone because the stone that was rejected is the one that capped it all off amen let's close in prayer Our Father you understand the morning you understand why it was the time the length everything about it you have a purpose in all things you do father because you love us Your Love causes us to be chastised but that same love causes forgiveness that same love causes healing that same love throws our failures in the sea of your forgetfulness that you could remember him no more Lord to me that's amazing [Music] lordy you could just totally wipe the Slate clean father May that love reach out and tart each heart in here this morning that they could know from this moment now that your love's here to wipe their slate clean to throw yesterday this morning in the sea of your forgetfulness and that if they would receive that love in their heart and they'd accept that pardon and they wouldn't even hold it accountable against themselves because you don't hold it accountable against them Lord and they could walk in that love and then show that same love that you had to them to others oh the joy Bells would be ringing as our brother told us our hearts would be aflame because of the peace that passes understanding Lord May every heart in here know this morning that there's hope regardless of the burden regardless of the mental strain the regardless of the problem the past does not hold the future when love is injected oh thank you Father for setting us free we ask you to bless us father for those that need you may they always know your garment is always there to be touched and that you love them Father we pray that you make that love known to each needy heart each sinner bound that that love may be their portion we ask you to send that love and touch Our Lives we ask it this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you let's sing this little course
