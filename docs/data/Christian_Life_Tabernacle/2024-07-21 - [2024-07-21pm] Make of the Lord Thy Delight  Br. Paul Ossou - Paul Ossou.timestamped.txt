[38:02] the power thereof amen from such turn
[38:09] away we'll go in the book of Psalm
[38:14] 37 Psalm chapter
[38:20] 37 read from verse uh 3-6 Psalm 26 Psalm
[38:25] 37
[38:28] trust in the Lord and do good so shall
[38:32] thou dwell in the land and verily thou
[38:35] shall be

[38:41] He Shall give Thee the desires of th

[38:56] righteousness as delight and thy
[38:59] judgments as the noon
[39:03] day father we read your
[39:06] word it's for
[39:08] you to open it up to translate it to
[39:14] pronounce
[39:15] it for the good of your
[39:18] people we commit ourselves to you in the
[39:22] name of Jesus Christ amen
[39:26] amen have your
[39:32] I believe we happy
[39:36] tonight and we thank the Lord for the
[39:39] word this
[39:40] morning you know like brother
[39:43] says that when you read the
[39:46] Bible from Genesis to
[39:50] Revelation if you don't see the name of
[39:53] Jesus that means you didn't read it
[39:55] right
[39:57] sometimes when we read the
[40:01] word we have difficulties understanding
[40:04] that that declaration from the
[40:07] prophet because with the natural
[40:10] thinking with the intellectual
[40:14] understanding there's verses we're going
[40:16] to
[40:16] read but it doesn't talk about
[40:21] Jesus but we heard we learned this
[40:23] morning
[40:28] that everything is around the
[40:31] word that this Bible how do we call it
[40:34] is the word and John tells
[40:38] us in the beginning was the
[40:41] word and the Word was was with God and
[40:44] the Word was
[40:46] God and the
[40:48] word had was made
[40:51] flesh and when the word was made flesh
[40:54] it was
[40:55] Jesus so when we read the word we're
[40:59] reading Jesus
[41:01] Christ so when we don't see Jesus then
[41:04] we didn't read right that's
[41:09] why as Servants of
[41:13] God all that we're trying to
[41:17] do is to bring everything back to the
[41:20] word because Jesus Christ himself
[41:23] said that heaven and earth will pass
[41:26] away
[41:28] everything that we see will pass away
[41:31] one one thing that will not pass away
[41:34] that's the word of
[41:36] God one thing that will not fail is the
[41:40] word of God that's
[41:43] why all our
[41:46] thinking everything that we
[41:49] are has to be directed towards that
[41:53] word nothing but the word of God
[41:59] amen uh you know yesterday or the day
[42:01] before
[42:03] yesterday what
[42:09] happened there's a an application being
[42:12] developed somewhere in the
[42:15] world uh certainly by one
[42:18] individual or a group of people
[42:27] and this application has
[42:31] issue but it's the whole entire world
[42:33] that's
[42:36] affected something made by men's
[42:41] hand capable of impacting the whole
[42:45] world how much
[42:48] more the word of
[42:53] God the God who created that man who
[42:56] created
[43:02] application the world was not waiting
[43:04] for this to
[43:07] happen it's like
[43:10] says that it will be about the same for
[43:13] the atomic
[43:18] bomb and it's not necessarily the person
[43:21] we waiting on to
[43:23] do maybe someone drunk somewhere
[43:27] and and
[43:29] unknowingly will press the
[43:32] button and it will be too
[43:35] late the world will be
[43:38] impacted but the word of
[43:41] God is the only thing that would not
[43:44] pass
[43:45] away tonight the Lord has placed on my
[43:51] heart a little subject that I'm taking
[43:54] from uh verse 4 of Psalm 34 36
[44:00] s make of the Lord that
[44:05] Delight make of the Lord thy
[44:14] Delight we know we saw how in Timothy it
[44:17] was descriptive of the time in which we
[44:19] are living
[44:23] in talking about man who loves pleasure
[44:26] more and they love
[44:32] God and a delight is a is an intense uh
[44:38] pleasure it's a it's a great
[44:43] pleasure and in this verse the Bible is
[44:45] telling
[44:47] us Delight Delight thyself also in the
[44:54] Lord and He will give you what your
[44:56] heart desire
[44:59] desires it means when someone has a
[45:02] desire
[45:05] tonight and he want that the Lord will
[45:08] give him his
[45:10] desire the infallible word word is
[45:13] telling
[45:16] us it says Delight thyself in the
[45:22] Lord theight make the Lord your greatest
[45:25] pleasure
[45:30] make the word of the lord your greatest
[45:35] pleasure we living in a
[45:38] time where there's a lot of
[45:46] Pleasures where there's a lot of things
[45:48] attracting people to different
[45:54] Pleasures the Bible spoke about this uh
[45:57] since the beginning as a
[46:00] prophecy but we are living these
[46:06] things the devil is opening up many
[46:11] doors to attract us to different
[46:17] Pleasures to to occupy our time to
[46:21] different
[46:25] Pleasures that we may never never get
[46:27] access to what our hearts
[46:32] desires because he knows that if we
[46:35] Delight in the
[46:38] Lord that if we meditate the word day
[46:41] and
[46:42] night as the book of Psalm
[46:46] said that if we if we meditate the word
[46:49] of the Lord day and
[46:52] night that we will be like a tree that's
[46:55] planted by the sea
[46:58] water that would produce its fruit in
[47:00] its
[47:02] season and everything that that man does
[47:05] will will will will be a
[47:07] success God told
[47:11] Joshua meditate on this word day and
[47:16] night don't ever go away from this
[47:22] word find your pleasure in the word of
[47:25] God
[47:29] because in that you'll find success in
[47:32] everything that you're going to
[47:36] do God has given us the
[47:41] key so we can have access to everything
[47:44] that our hearts
[47:47] desires so we can have success in
[47:50] everything that we
[47:52] do and because the devil knows that
[47:57] because he knows the
[48:01] word and he knows what each one of our
[48:04] weaknesses
[48:07] are and he's going to come to that
[48:13] weakness so you can concentrate on the
[48:20] weakness give you pleasure in your
[48:25] weakness you will not have time to
[48:28] meditate upon the word of the
[48:31] Lord and he knows because you don't have
[48:34] time to meditate on the word
[48:38] of you will only have time to do
[48:40] superficial
[48:44] prayers then you won't
[48:50] succeed the voice of pleasure
[48:59] God is describing to us the time in
[49:02] which we are living
[49:06] in and this morning they read to us the
[49:09] description of the age of
[49:12] La in Revelation chapter
[49:17] 3 we realize it's a
[49:21] people they say they are rich
[49:27] when he's sick he can go to the hospital
[49:29] with no
[49:30] problem he doesn't need to pray
[49:36] God if he wants to go somewhere he has
[49:39] his money to buy a airplane
[49:43] ticket and they are those that have
[49:45] enough money to go and visit
[49:51] Mars but God
[49:53] says that they are miserable
[49:58] poor
[50:00] blind and
[50:04] naked and is's inviting
[50:07] them to come to buy from
[50:11] him
[50:13] gold the word of
[50:17] God that the clothes that they may cover
[50:20] the
[50:23] nakedness and I Ser that they may have
[50:26] their eyes
[50:28] open and the same God who's inviting
[50:32] them is constantly standing at the door
[50:35] and knock how is he Knocking by the word
[50:39] of
[50:44] God people are concentrated in different
[50:50] Pleasures talks a lot about uh uh movies
[50:54] and theaters
[50:58] it was because in that time it occupied
[51:01] a lot of time for
[51:06] people people were uh uh refusing or
[51:10] staying away from churches in order for
[51:12] them to go watch series of of
[51:18] movies he would say that Pentecost
[51:21] they've run away from movie theaters
[51:26] the devil has taken the movie theater
[51:29] and brought it right into their
[51:34] homes and the Christians of today
[51:36] they've run away from
[51:39] television the devil is taken the movie
[51:43] theater and he's put it in the cell
[51:49] phone he said he put it in the cell
[51:53] phone maybe it's a little bit expensive
[51:56] for you to go get access over there
[51:58] wi-fi oh we'll give you Wi-Fi internet
[52:01] we'll give you
[52:06] internet that way the time to read the
[52:09] Bible WhatsApp you are there in WhatsApp
[52:12] Tik Tok Tik Tok Instagram Instagram
[52:15] Facebook
[52:16] Facebook and when you go out of there
[52:19] YouTube YouTube
[52:29] and sometimes the whole
[52:31] night or the whole
[52:34] day somebody has not even read one verse
[52:37] of the
[52:38] Bible he's left he's there for five
[52:45] hours and be
[52:49] sure anything that you read on the
[52:52] social
[52:54] media it will influence inuence your
[52:57] life
[53:00] somewhere it will influence your
[53:03] thinking
[53:08] somewhere it's going to bring you
[53:11] pleasure that's why you stay there
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] longer but this pleasure is only taking
[53:24] you away from God enter in your
[53:29] heart for God to hear your
[53:33] prayers for God to give you the desire
[53:36] of your
[53:40] heart someone can say well I'm doing it
[53:43] just for
[53:44] distraction
[53:46] says that the field of
[53:50] Destruction the devil is the champion on
[53:53] that field just put your foot on there
[53:57] he's really going to receive you
[54:00] well and you going to forget that you
[54:02] are a
[54:06] Christian Delight thyself in the
[54:13] Lord sometimes people find Pleasures in
[54:16] certain things in alcohol in the
[54:21] drugs and sometimes they get
[54:24] in because they say they have all kinds
[54:26] of troubl they have
[54:29] problems when they take a little bit of
[54:31] alcohol and the
[54:33] drug they have
[54:35] pleasure they forget all of those
[54:39] problems but when the effect of alcohol
[54:42] is over when the effect of the alcohol
[54:45] drug is over the same problems are
[54:54] waiting but when you make of the Lord
[54:56] that
[54:58] Delight you find pleasure in the word of
[55:03] God you may have
[55:06] trouble oh you
[55:08] pray you open the word of
[55:11] God and you fall right on the
[55:15] answer and when you get out of there you
[55:18] had pleasure solu and the problem has
[55:21] gotten solved
[55:27] because he said that if you Delight in
[55:29] the
[55:31] Lord he will give you your heart's
[55:35] desire God has never
[55:38] lied and the devil knows
[55:41] that that's why all that he
[55:45] does is to try to take us away from the
[55:49] word of
[55:52] God to bring us to doubt a portion of
[55:55] the word of God
[55:59] God wants to bring us to believe the
[56:00] whole word of
[56:04] God but the devil will try to take
[56:08] us to only believe
[56:12] 90% and say oh that not
[56:17] 1% has God really
[56:23] said did God really say that you cannot
[56:26] go on social media than where is it
[56:39] written Delight thyself in the
[56:44] Lord and we
[56:48] know that in the time in which we are
[56:50] living
[56:53] in the Bible is compared that with Luke
[56:55] 17
[56:58] in the time of
[57:02] lot there were those that were finding
[57:05] pleasure in those things of the
[57:08] world like lot in
[57:12] Sodom but there was also another group
[57:15] gr an elected
[57:18] group the group of
[57:22] Abraham they don't look at what the
[57:24] world is reflecting
[57:29] they don't look at what the world has to
[57:32] offer but they look into the promise of
[57:39] God Abraham was a man like you and
[57:42] I and probably an
[57:46] idolator it came from a country of dur
[57:48] in in in in
[57:50] in and one
[57:52] day God spoke to him
[57:57] like God speaks to each and every one of
[57:59] us
[58:02] tonight like God speaks to each one when
[58:05] the word is
[58:06] spoken God told
[58:08] Abraham get out of your
[58:11] country get out of your
[58:13] nation get out of your
[58:16] family go to a place that I shall show
[58:20] you it was even difficult for Abraham
[58:26] because he didn't know where God was
[58:28] taking him but
[58:30] us we have the whole word of
[58:34] God we know where God is taking
[58:39] us we know what God has promised for
[58:43] us and he said like he said telling us
[58:46] like he told
[58:47] Abraham come out of all the pleases of
[58:50] the world come to this
[58:53] message because there's a promise for
[58:55] you
[58:58] that this world will be
[59:01] destroyed but because of
[59:05] you I will send Elijah the
[59:10] prophet to open a way for
[59:14] you to open a bridge for
[59:19] you so you can be like the group of
[59:24] Abraham those that had received the
[59:28] visitation of Elohim
[59:34] himself
[59:39] says in question and answer of uh
[59:44] 54103 uh that
[59:46] evening paragraph
[59:52] 100 we are living in the day that God
[59:54] spoke would would come
[59:58] we are living in the last
[1:00:04] days we are living in a time when men
[1:00:07] regardless of what we tried to think
[1:00:09] about
[1:00:11] it God's word
[1:00:16] saysed that we are
[1:00:19] predestinated that's
[1:00:22] right we were predestinated
[1:00:26] and the devil knows that you are
[1:00:30] predestinated that the day that you will
[1:00:32] make your
[1:00:35] decision to go away from all the
[1:00:38] pleasures that the devil is offering
[1:00:42] you you will have full Ben uh blessings
[1:00:45] of the predestination that you've been G
[1:00:49] to we we are
[1:00:52] predestinated that's right
[1:00:57] what God has called will come to
[1:01:01] God and what God doesn't call will not
[1:01:04] come to
[1:01:06] God God calls and they
[1:01:09] refuse and he calls they
[1:01:15] refuse now I don't say God condemned any
[1:01:22] anybody he's just not willing that that
[1:01:25] all should
[1:01:31] should that any should perish but all
[1:01:34] might come to
[1:01:37] repentance but in order to be
[1:01:43] God he knew in the beginning that there
[1:01:46] wasn't going to
[1:01:49] come he knew that there were those that
[1:01:52] wouldn't come
[1:01:58] that there were those regardless of the
[1:02:00] demonstration of the power of God would
[1:02:02] not
[1:02:04] come that they would not believe this
[1:02:14] message and and and yet being God he
[1:02:17] knew from the beginning that they wasn't
[1:02:19] going to
[1:02:22] come yet he gave them a chance
[1:02:27] but they wouldn't
[1:02:31] come God knew who was in
[1:02:39] Sodom which is why even when Abraham was
[1:02:43] interceding with
[1:02:46] Elohim oh if you find 50 will you really
[1:02:49] destroy them oh no I won't destroy them
[1:02:52] what if you find 10 they said no I won't
[1:02:56] because he
[1:02:57] knew so before the foundation of the
[1:03:02] world the sodomite would not believe
[1:03:10] it he
[1:03:16] says yet he gave them a chance but they
[1:03:20] wouldn't
[1:03:21] come he he sent two angels in in Sodom
[1:03:26] they
[1:03:27] refused he gave them a
[1:03:36] chance how if he doesn't know that how
[1:03:40] did he know that we would have a
[1:03:41] Horseless
[1:03:45] carriages how would he know that these
[1:03:47] times will come like we have now
[1:03:55] why did he say that men would be heav
[1:03:59] highminded lovers of
[1:04:07] Pleasures why all the prophet predicted
[1:04:10] that all the things uh other things
[1:04:13] would would come plummet from be from
[1:04:15] the
[1:04:17] beginning God know
[1:04:20] everything he knows what will be
[1:04:31] and there is men in there that God
[1:04:34] looked down through time and said they
[1:04:37] won't
[1:04:39] come and they just they are just
[1:04:43] condemned and of that
[1:04:50] condemnation because they chose it
[1:04:53] themselves amen voila am amen there you
[1:04:57] are this is God who
[1:05:00] knows but you and I we don't
[1:05:04] know you and I cannot
[1:05:07] say that this one is a sodomite he won't
[1:05:13] believe all that God is asking
[1:05:16] us is to find
[1:05:20] them to give them a chance
[1:05:26] to give them the occasion for them to
[1:05:28] come into the
[1:05:30] message but God himself
[1:05:35] knows who's not going to answer to the
[1:05:38] call when he knocks at the
[1:05:40] door who's going to
[1:05:43] answer continues and
[1:05:46] said and I believe my brother my
[1:05:53] sister I say this with Godly respect and
[1:05:56] with fear of God in my
[1:05:59] heart I believe America
[1:06:04] sunk she's
[1:06:09] demoralized she's gone low to
[1:06:12] stooping it's a
[1:06:16] Pity and it's just not America it's the
[1:06:22] world the the the world is just sunk
[1:06:29] which is why all the pleasures that the
[1:06:31] world is going to try to offer
[1:06:36] us that everything that the sons of Cain
[1:06:39] will will manufacture to put at our
[1:06:43] disposal it's never going to be to try
[1:06:46] to bring us closer to God
[1:06:56] but you always try to take us away from
[1:06:58] the blessing that we have that we have
[1:07:02] the whole world is
[1:07:04] sunken there's no
[1:07:07] moral you just go
[1:07:10] out and see what's going
[1:07:16] on but God
[1:07:19] wants that Sons and Daughters of
[1:07:22] God that they may find their pleasure
[1:07:26] in the word of
[1:07:30] God in everything that God
[1:07:33] said not a part but not a part of what
[1:07:37] God
[1:07:39] Said but everything that God
[1:07:42] said and when we speak about these
[1:07:48] things it's not to condemn those
[1:07:53] people know God said we we will live in
[1:07:57] this time as
[1:07:59] such and the scripture has to be
[1:08:04] fulfilled we are not condemning
[1:08:09] them but we are condemning the sin in
[1:08:12] which those people find themselves
[1:08:17] in to try to bring those people back to
[1:08:20] the word of
[1:08:23] God but if those people are attracting
[1:08:26] us to their
[1:08:29] side with the pleasure that they are
[1:08:35] offering we we won't be able to attract
[1:08:38] them to what which that which is perfect
[1:08:41] which is the word of God butam
[1:08:45] says in uh enticing
[1:08:50] Spirits uh July it preached July 24th
[1:08:54] 1955
[1:08:57] paragraph 111 he
[1:09:01] says don't condemn The
[1:09:05] Sinner have mercy on
[1:09:11] him let him go ahead and smoke his
[1:09:15] pipe let him drink his
[1:09:18] liquor let him have his card
[1:09:22] party that's his pleasure
[1:09:26] don't blame
[1:09:31] him coming
[1:09:33] home coming home and everything tired
[1:09:37] and worn out he wants some
[1:09:41] pleasure the thing you should
[1:09:45] do is live such a Godly
[1:09:51] life that you can prove to him
[1:09:58] that the gospel hold 10,000 times more
[1:10:02] than
[1:10:04] that that a great pleasure in the
[1:10:10] gospel than in those
[1:10:15] things it says and if he dies in that
[1:10:19] state he'll go to hell on his liquor
[1:10:25] that's the devil
[1:10:30] intoxication If he if he
[1:10:32] dies dragging on his on his old
[1:10:37] pipe God is God is their
[1:10:42] judge if he dies going out going out
[1:10:46] there
[1:10:49] dancing and running out with his
[1:10:52] Immortal clothes
[1:10:53] on God is the
[1:10:56] judge but one thing but he says but
[1:10:59] there's one
[1:11:02] thing if you die under the anointing
[1:11:06] power of the Holy
[1:11:07] Ghost like like
[1:11:12] stepen when he had looked up in the face
[1:11:15] of
[1:11:16] God said I see Heaven
[1:11:20] open and Jesus standing at the right
[1:11:23] hand you are Heavenly
[1:11:27] bound like her Martin in its box amen
[1:11:34] amen enticing Spirits versing the word
[1:11:39] of
[1:11:43] God all those things that are producing
[1:11:45] pleasure outside of the word of
[1:11:49] goded they are enticing spirits
[1:11:59] one day I was going to Arlington there's
[1:12:00] a stadium by Arlington the at&
[1:12:07] stadium I saw a lot of people passing by
[1:12:09] in a lot of car
[1:12:13] parked I I I I don't know if there was
[1:12:16] maybe a game going on in the
[1:12:21] stadium and people were there four five
[1:12:24] hours before the
[1:12:26] game and they were
[1:12:28] happy they had
[1:12:31] pleasures and they were going to be
[1:12:33] there until the
[1:12:35] end and even when the game is
[1:12:39] over they would have time to even talk
[1:12:42] about what happened in the
[1:12:46] game but when it's time to come to the
[1:12:48] to the
[1:12:50] church when the church goes on for 3
[1:12:53] hours oh that's too
[1:12:59] much the pleasure that the devil is

[1:17:55] God told me to meditate on the word I

[1:18:04] word God doesn't ask complicated
[1:18:08] things sometimes we complicated
[1:18:12] christianism but
[1:18:14] Christianity is to believe the
[1:18:17] word nothing but the word and all the
[1:18:20] word and that's it and the rest is God
[1:18:25] who does
[1:18:26] it it's not me that does it it's not my
[1:18:29] effort it's not my cry out it's God who

[1:18:39] says he let
[1:18:48] loose he let loose and let go God took
[1:18:52] him through you don't
[1:18:56] in all that God is asking
[1:18:58] us is to take him by his
[1:19:03] word but the effort that the devil is
[1:19:05] going to
[1:19:07] do is to help us not to take God at his
[1:19:12] word to give us a word a
[1:19:15] job oh we
[1:19:18] work we work really
[1:19:20] hard when we come home very tired we

[1:20:16] was I'm
[1:20:20] sorry when you see your friend do
[1:20:23] something that is not wrong that that is
[1:20:25] wrong it says you worship God in showing
[1:20:27] him this is not
[1:20:28] it and the same brother talk
[1:20:32] says everywhere you
[1:20:34] go find time to

[1:20:57] you can you can worship in in in going
[1:21:00] somewhere quiet and
[1:21:03] praying you can you can worship in
[1:21:05] giving a testimony to a
[1:21:08] coworker find a time to
[1:21:15] worship the devil is going to try to
[1:21:18] take us away from that
[1:21:20] atmosphere but the word tells
[1:21:22] us the light th self in the
[1:21:26] Lord and He will give you your heart's
[1:21:33] desire it's not our
[1:21:37] efforts it's not what we are
[1:21:41] doing it's what he has already
[1:21:45] done he already done
[1:21:48] it he knew us since before the
[1:21:51] foundation of the
[1:21:53] world Glory to
[1:21:56] God that there was a man who suffered
[1:21:59] like
[1:22:00] job and from
[1:22:04] job he told us something that we forgot
[1:22:07] in this life he told
[1:22:11] job that when I was laying out the
[1:22:14] foundation of the
[1:22:17] world that the sons of God were shouting
[1:22:19] for joy
[1:22:24] God s saw us screaming over there for
[1:22:29] Joy when he was placing the foundation
[1:22:32] of the
[1:22:34] world he he knew us since before the
[1:22:37] foundation of the
[1:22:39] world he knew what we would
[1:22:43] be he knew by which that which we would
[1:22:46] go
[1:22:48] through he knew that he we would come
[1:22:52] Sinners and was slain since before the
[1:22:56] foundation of the
[1:23:04] world and he came and he fulfilled that
[1:23:07] portion of the scripture with Jesus who
[1:23:09] was
[1:23:10] slain so he can
[1:23:14] materialize to to show us what we were
[1:23:17] what we were we didn't have the
[1:23:19] knowledge that we were
[1:23:20] lacking that for your sins
[1:23:25] in reality I had already paid the
[1:23:27] price for your
[1:23:30] sickness I had already paid the price
[1:23:32] for
[1:23:35] it everything that you
[1:23:37] did was to accept
[1:23:40] him
[1:23:42] says uh in believing
[1:23:46] God preach uh February
[1:23:49] 24
[1:23:50] 1952 paragraph 200 he says
[1:23:57] and God can't save
[1:24:02] you because he has already done
[1:24:07] it so if you come crying today God saved
[1:24:12] meam say somewhere
[1:24:14] else that even if Jesus was standing
[1:24:17] here
[1:24:20] tonight and you come and you said Lord
[1:24:23] save me
[1:24:25] you will say I can't do
[1:24:28] it because I have already done
[1:24:35] it the only thing you have to
[1:24:39] do is
[1:24:42] accepted it's already
[1:24:46] done I wasn't saved 20 years ago
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:57] I was saved not 19 years ago 19 years
[1:25:01] ago so in other word today is over 2,000
[1:25:04] years
[1:25:10] ago but 20 years ago I received it and
[1:25:14] accepted
[1:25:20] it if you believe that you are not saved
[1:25:23] tonight
[1:25:25] the Bible is telling you
[1:25:28] tonight that you were already
[1:25:34] saved and he's only inviting you tonight
[1:25:37] so you could receive
[1:25:40] it he
[1:25:48] says if he if he hadn't it the first sin
[1:25:52] I done God would have wipe me off the
[1:25:55] face of the
[1:25:56] Earth because he said he would he
[1:25:59] would and he has to keep his
[1:26:04] promise I was healed 19 years 1900 years
[1:26:09] ago but I've got to accept
[1:26:15] it and the only thing that kept me from
[1:26:18] being saved when I was 12 years
[1:26:22] old because a spirit hung over
[1:26:26] me a devil
[1:26:29] saying wait a little while
[1:26:35] longer and the same demon is telling
[1:26:37] others

[1:33:58] heart that every demon
[1:34:01] power that's in here at this
[1:34:05] minute is already
[1:34:07] broken I believe
[1:34:11] it oh I
[1:34:15] think one day in
[1:34:20] Congo I had a burden in my heart to go
[1:34:23] preach to to a small to a little village
[1:34:27] a
[1:34:30] Sunday I was I talked to the pastor
[1:34:33] brother rapael that you know very
[1:34:38] well he told me yeah because you're
[1:34:40] going to go to that Village over
[1:34:43] there in on the way there's another
[1:34:45] small
[1:34:47] church I want you to stop by that church
[1:34:50] Sunday night Saturday
[1:34:52] night you pre day
[1:34:55] Saturday and Sunday you go where you
[1:34:58] want to
[1:34:58] go in the
[1:35:02] morning and then in the afternoon I want
[1:35:04] you to come back to that little small
[1:35:06] Church before you can come
[1:35:09] back so I came to that small
[1:35:12] village as I when I was preaching as I
[1:35:15] was preaching
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:23] I felt like there was something that was
[1:35:25] resisting fighting me uh from a an
[1:35:29] elderly sister that was sitting in the
[1:35:32] congregation as I was preaching I was
[1:35:34] pricing and I I just fell a
[1:35:37] resistance it's like I couldn't I
[1:35:39] couldn't just find a way to go
[1:35:45] forward and something just came over me
[1:35:48] and I asked her if that that that that
[1:35:50] elderly sister understood what I was
[1:35:52] preaching
[1:35:55] they told me that she needed an
[1:35:56] interpreter for the the language she was
[1:36:02] speaking so I had an interpreter who was
[1:36:05] translating in a language that's spoken
[1:36:07] by most
[1:36:09] people so I asked another
[1:36:12] interpreter his son
[1:36:14] came but he had a difficulties uh trans
[1:36:19] interpreting and the one who was
[1:36:21] translating me in this other language
[1:36:26] who has never translated in the local
[1:36:28] language that that that woman was
[1:36:30] speaking in he came
[1:36:34] back he he he translated for
[1:36:40] me in that language and I was I started
[1:36:43] preaching really hard on seducing
[1:36:48] Spirits against all those little demon
[1:36:51] spirits
[1:36:53] to show that there's not any
[1:36:57] power can stand before the power of
[1:37:00] God can stand before the word of
[1:37:03] God we
[1:37:06] finished we we went our
[1:37:09] way and I was telling those that were
[1:37:11] with me on the
[1:37:13] way that I said I felt like there was
[1:37:15] something about that
[1:37:18] sister so the next day when I was coming
[1:37:22] back when I was
[1:37:26] preaching I noticed that the attitude of
[1:37:28] that sister
[1:37:31] changed that she was more a little more
[1:37:34] receptive that that she looked
[1:37:37] happy so I continue to
[1:37:40] preach and when I
[1:37:42] finished as we were getting ready to
[1:37:45] go his son came to see
[1:37:48] me he said um Mommy can't
[1:37:53] in reality she's a
[1:37:58] witch and she has a bunch of
[1:38:01] Witchcraft that her heart is
[1:38:03] beating and she can't she can no longer
[1:38:06] keep
[1:38:08] it and she want to take it so it can be
[1:38:11] burned I said there's no
[1:38:14] problem so they brought a really big uh
[1:38:17] uh
[1:38:18] bag filled with all kinds of
[1:38:21] Witchcraft it said oh this stick
[1:38:25] oh I use it to to hurt such and
[1:38:28] such this cloth over here I do
[1:38:33] this we
[1:38:36] burned she said she gave her heart to
[1:38:38] the
[1:38:39] Lord but we didn't have time to bring
[1:38:42] her to bapt to water
[1:38:45] baptism so I asked his son who was also
[1:38:48] a preacher there to organize the baptism
[1:38:52] for her so we went back to
[1:38:55] brazaville so the next day his son
[1:38:58] called me he said my mom didn't sleep I
[1:39:02] said what
[1:39:04] happened she said she told
[1:39:06] me that she dreamed about you like that
[1:39:10] night that you came to tell
[1:39:13] her that you didn't get out all your
[1:39:15] witchcraft
[1:39:17] stuff you have to take out everything in
[1:39:20] order for you to be
[1:39:22] here so now she came up with another
[1:39:25] B with with other witchcraft
[1:39:29] inside to say that the word of
[1:39:32] God there is no
[1:39:35] power that can resist before the word of
[1:39:38] God it's not our strength it's the word
[1:39:42] of
[1:39:43] God just the word of
[1:39:45] God he said in my name you shall cast
[1:39:50] out the devil then tonight
[1:39:53] all I need to say in the name of Jesus
[1:39:58] Christ has to be cast
[1:40:01] out demons have to obey to that voice
[1:40:05] because it's the word of God that it's
