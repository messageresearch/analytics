[26:34] Hallelujah. Amen. I thank God for all
[26:38] the messages that we've received coming
[26:40] over the pull pit. They have really been
[26:42] a a blessing for me to encourage me and
[26:45] to place me in the position that God
[26:47] would have me to be. And I'm trying with
[26:50] all my heart to be faithful to being
[26:52] able to do what the pastors have
[26:55] [Music]
[27:03] said. Like a ship that's
[27:06] tossed and
[27:10] driven, battered by an angry sea.
[27:19] When the storms of
[27:22] life are
[27:25] raging and the
[27:28] fear falls on
[27:32] me, I
[27:35] wonder what have I
[27:40] done to make my
[27:43] race so hard to
[27:47] run. Then I say to my
[27:52] soul, take
[27:56] courage. He'll make a
[27:59] way
[28:03] somehow. I try to do my
[28:07] best in service.
[28:09] [Music]
[28:12] I try to do the best I
[28:18] can when I choose to
[28:22] do the right
[28:26] thing. Evil's present on every
[28:32] hand. I look
[28:35] up and I wonder why.
[28:41] Good
[28:43] fortune pass me
[28:47] by. Then I say to my
[28:51] soul, be
[28:56] patient. He'll make a
[28:59] way
[29:01] somehow. I know the Lord will make a
[29:07] way somehow.
[29:11] When beneath the
[29:13] cross I
[29:17] bow, he will take away each of your
[29:25] sorrow if you let him have your burdens
[29:29] now.
[29:31] [Music]
[29:33] And the load you
[29:36] bear so
[29:39] heavy. And the weight shows
[29:43] on your brow.
[29:48] There's a sweet
[29:51] relief in
[29:55] knowing he'll make a
[29:58] way
[30:02] somehow. Try to do my
[30:05] best in
[30:09] service. I try to do the best I can.
[30:17] When I choose to
[30:20] do the right
[30:24] thing, evil's present on every
[30:30] hand. I look
[30:33] up and I wonder
[30:37] why good
[30:40] fortune pass me by.
[30:45] Then I say to my
[30:49] heart, don't
[30:53] worry. He'll make a
[30:56] way
[30:58] somehow. I know the Lord will make a
[31:03] way somehow.
[31:08] And beneath the
[31:10] cross, I
[31:14] bow. He will take
[31:17] away each of your
[31:21] sorrow if you let him have your burdens.
[31:28] Now when the load you
[31:32] bear so
[31:36] heavy and the weight shows
[31:39] on your brow.
[31:44] There's a sweet
[31:47] relief in
[31:51] knowing he'll make a
[31:54] way somehow. Yes, he
[31:58] will. He'll make a
[32:01] way
[32:05] somehow. He'll make a
[32:08] way somehow.
[32:11] [Music]

[32:19] Lord. You know, I know Brother Clayton

[48:04] man would reach
[48:07] down his hand. Go and do this for
[48:15] me. For you and
[48:19] me. Oh, we're
[48:23] so
[48:26] unworthy to live.
[48:28] Oh, and not
[48:31] fail to kill.
[48:34] But the man
[48:37] on the
[48:38] cross, he had my name
[48:42] in his
[48:44] will. He said that
[48:47] I I could
[48:50] still go free.
[48:53] [Music]
[48:59] Amen. How many can say, "I've been set
[49:02] free tonight." Yes. He paid so you could
[49:05] go free. Amen. Let's all stand at this
[49:08] time as we invite brother Jeremy. Amen.
[49:11] K of D. Oh, there is a
[49:14] [Music]
[49:16] soul in times of
[49:20] need that gives me
[49:24] hope. God brings me
[49:28] peace. In every
[49:31] trial through every
[49:35] test my savior
[49:39] stands in mighty
[49:42] defense. Oh and a road you are.
[49:48] Oh, leave it tight and
[49:51] warm and your strength is
[49:55] calm and your heart feels strong. Oh,
[49:59] and remember
[50:02] God is greater than a
[50:07] stone. Take courage for the battle is
[50:13] the Lord.
[50:15] Oh, and when the waters
[50:18] rise, oh, he calls my name. Oh, and he
[50:24] beats me
[50:27] come out.
[50:30] Hallelujah. He hold my
[50:34] hand lest I should
[50:38] falter and he makes me
[50:42] stand out on the water.
[50:46] Oh, and when
[50:51] you die
[50:54] and all your
[50:57] [Music]
[50:58] strength and your
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] heart
[51:05] God is greater than
[51:10] [Music]
[51:14] stor battle.
[51:18] Amen. You have that courage this
[51:21] evening. Amen. Let's talk to him for a
[51:23] few moments. Heavenly Father, as we come
[51:26] before you this evening, we know you're
[51:28] here, Father, amongst your people. We
[51:31] just want to capitalize on this, Lord,
[51:33] by sitting at your feet tonight, hearing
[51:37] your word. We want to stop, Lord, as we
[51:40] before we get in once again into the
[51:42] hustle and bustle of this life. Lord, it
[51:45] seems like we're if we're not careful,
[51:47] we get too eager to get into that.
[51:50] Father, before we do, we just want to
[51:54] stop and we want to sit at your feet. We
[51:57] want to hear what you have to say. Not
[51:59] what man has to say. I can't do anything
[52:02] for him, Lord, but I need to hear from
[52:04] you tonight. May we stop and may we
[52:06] breathe for just a few moments. Take a
[52:09] deep breath and hear what you have for
[52:12] us as we surrender our minds, our
[52:14] thoughts. Push everything out of the way
[52:16] for a few moments. Everything's going to
[52:18] come. Our work will come. Our jobs will
[52:21] hit us. Our bills will come. All that's
[52:22] going to come. Let's just stop and hear
[52:26] what you have to say. We thank you for
[52:30] your word tonight. I surrender myself to
[52:33] you. We love you. We thank you in Jesus
[52:36] precious name. And the church says,
[52:39] "Amen." Hallelujah. Let's open our
[52:41] Bibles to the book of Luke, chapter
[52:44] 18. Amen. I just feel led to just dive
[52:47] right into this just for the sake of
[52:49] time. I understand it is a Saturday,
[52:51] Saturday. Sunday. I'm used to preaching
[52:53] on Saturday evening. So, uh, this is a
[52:56] Sunday evening and so we want to be, uh,
[52:59] cautious of your time.
[53:01] Luke chapter 18:9. And tonight is I've
[53:05] just the Lord has kind of led us to do
[53:07] more of a a talk kind of uh in in this
[53:12] teaching in a sense. So I I trust it'll
[53:14] be a blessing. And we'll start reading
[53:17] at verse number nine. Luke
[53:21] 18:9. And he spake this parable unto
[53:25] certain now notice what this says tr
[53:28] which trusted in themselves.
[53:31] that they were righteous and despised
[53:35] others. Two men went up into the temple
[53:38] to pray. So both went to church. The one
[53:41] a Pharisee and the other a publican. The
[53:44] Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[53:46] himself. God, I thank thee that I'm not
[53:50] as the other men are, extortioners,
[53:53] unjust, adulterers, or even as this
[53:55] publican. I fast twice in the week. I
[53:58] give tithes of all that I possess. And
[54:01] the publican standing a far off would
[54:03] not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[54:06] heaven. But smoteed upon his breast,
[54:08] saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
[54:12] I tell you, this man went down to his
[54:15] house justified rather than the other.
[54:19] For everyone that exalteth himself
[54:23] shall be amazed, and he that humbleth
[54:26] himself shall be exalted. God bless you.
[54:30] You can be seated this
[54:34] evening. Our thought for this evening,
[54:36] I'll say it twice for you to catch it.
[54:39] Is it too late for character
[54:43] development? One more time. Is it too
[54:48] late for character development? I
[54:52] believe this is a thought that I spoke
[54:53] at home the last service I spoke last
[54:56] year and then God begin to deal with me
[54:58] as soon as we got home this afternoon on
[55:01] this. Now, there's five things I I want
[55:03] us to just look at in real quick and I'm
[55:05] just if you can write them if you want.
[55:07] But the first thing we stopped in, it
[55:09] says trusted in themselves. That's
[55:11] number one. So he is speaking to those
[55:13] who placed trust in themselves that they
[55:17] were righteous and despised others.
[55:20] That's number one. Number two, the
[55:22] Pharisee, then the
[55:24] publican. And then the idea of
[55:27] exalting and the idea of humbling.
[55:31] If we have that in mind and you write
[55:32] this down and you you you you keep this
[55:35] in thought in in your thought process
[55:37] through the entire sermon. First of all,
[55:40] we cannot trust in
[55:41] ourselves. And I want to ask us a
[55:43] question because I believe I'm speaking
[55:45] to message believers tonight. And I
[55:46] believe that we as a body as a body of
[55:50] believers have to carry
[55:52] ourselves as believers as a message
[55:56] believer. We have to carry ourselves in
[56:00] this world in a proper way as the bride
[56:04] of Jesus Christ. Now, none of us thinks
[56:06] that we fit the Pharisee here, right?
[56:09] None of us wants to believe that. And I
[56:12] will believe that the same thing with
[56:13] you. I believe that I'm speaking to
[56:15] everyone here that does not fit the
[56:16] Pharisee. So, tonight, this is going to
[56:18] be a thought that we want to make sure
[56:20] we do not get there. Is that okay? So,
[56:22] let's let's just preach as nobody's
[56:24] there, but make sure we don't get there.
[56:27] Hallelujah. That makes this a whole lot
[56:28] easier tonight.
[56:30] Okay, but let's think about it for a
[56:33] minute. How is you have to ask yourself
[56:36] this question and I'm going to ask
[56:37] myself, how is my
[56:41] spirit, my attitude towards my belief
[56:46] and my conviction? Right?
[56:48] How is your spirit and your attitude
[56:53] towards what you believe and your
[56:56] conviction when you are tested about
[56:59] what you believe or your convictions in
[57:01] your life? How do you react?
[57:06] Now, Brother Brandham in 1961, he says,
[57:08] "And be not afraid." He says, "When it
[57:10] gets to a
[57:11] spot that you cannot have tender love
[57:14] for every human
[57:16] being, something's happened to
[57:18] you." God so loved you when you was a
[57:21] sinner, an alien away from God, an enemy
[57:25] of the commonwealth of God. Think about
[57:27] that. He so loved you that he gave his
[57:30] life for you. We just heard the song.
[57:33] Sure. He says if you get a spirit in
[57:36] you, you're better than someone else.
[57:40] Says, then you're worse than anybody
[57:43] else that I know
[57:45] of. Says, I don't care if you're ever so
[57:49] correct in your
[57:50] theology, your motives, and your
[57:54] objectives
[57:55] is wrong.
[57:58] I'd rather be wrong. I know we've heard
[58:02] this before.
[58:05] I'd rather be wrong in my
[58:08] theology than be wrong in my heart.
[58:11] That's right. The spirit of God dwells
[58:15] in your heart.
[58:17] You see, I I I have found where
[58:20] sometimes it's a lot easier to talk
[58:23] to to denominational
[58:25] people than it can be sometimes to
[58:28] message people.
[58:30] We have to be careful with that because
[58:33] we get a little bit of our differences.
[58:35] It's even happens in the church.
[58:38] We need to and I believe that that God
[58:40] wants us to understand that there has to
[58:42] still you're still living, right? You I
[58:46] would believe so because you're here.
[58:48] And so there is still character
[58:50] development that is happening. Now let's
[58:53] look at the the idea of character
[58:55] development for a moment. Let's look at
[58:56] character development in real life. So
[58:59] character development in real life
[59:01] refers to the process of actively
[59:06] cultivating which is nurturing,
[59:09] parenting or
[59:11] helping positive traits and values
[59:14] within oneself.
[59:17] Now let me stop there. You have a choice
[59:20] tonight. What what what you're going to
[59:22] hear. I choose to want to climb higher.
[59:27] Not in just theology, but I want to
[59:31] carry the word properly.
[59:36] What if I have a wrong attitude in how I
[59:38] carry the word? They're not even going
[59:40] to want to look at me.
[59:45] That's all I got to say.
[59:47] So again, so we're cultivating, we're
[59:50] nurturing, we're parenting, we're
[59:52] helping these positive traits and
[59:54] values. Here it is again within you
[59:57] within oneself shaping how you
[1:00:02] respond which is react or retaliate. So
[1:00:06] the word retaliate is not so much a
[1:00:08] wrong word because you can retaliate
[1:00:10] correctly
[1:00:12] to situations and interact with others
[1:00:15] essentially
[1:00:17] becoming a better person through
[1:00:20] conscious effort. That word conscious is
[1:00:23] aware, alert and being aware. So you are
[1:00:28] aware of
[1:00:30] your
[1:00:32] reaction. You're not just reacting in an
[1:00:37] emotion. You're not just reacting
[1:00:39] because uh uh uh it it feels right.
[1:00:43] You're aware of what you're doing. So
[1:00:46] again, I want to back up. So essentially
[1:00:48] becoming a better person through
[1:00:50] conscious effort and learning from
[1:00:53] experiences. We're talking about
[1:00:55] character development
[1:00:57] uh effort and learning from experiences
[1:00:59] including challenges and successes.
[1:01:03] It's about building personal
[1:01:07] integrity, which is good character and
[1:01:11] virtue and a strong moral
[1:01:15] compass over
[1:01:17] time. So it is more than just thinking
[1:01:21] that we're something but we need to know
[1:01:23] the right direction to go to. All right.
[1:01:25] So this is the idea of real life
[1:01:28] character development. So, uh, uh, we
[1:01:30] need to I need to teach my children
[1:01:32] this, and by doing that, I need to have
[1:01:34] character development. I'm asking you
[1:01:36] the question, is it too late for you to
[1:01:40] have character development? However old
[1:01:42] you are, however much message belt you
[1:01:45] have, however big your eagle belt buckle
[1:01:47] is, is it too late for you to have
[1:01:50] change and have character development in
[1:01:52] your life?
[1:01:55] This takes effort on your
[1:01:59] part. Now notice this wonderful quote in
[1:02:02] the Thyiran church age and uh paragraph
[1:02:06] 2:24. He says, I know your faith. Now he
[1:02:10] does not say here as he did in the
[1:02:12] church in Pergamis, you hold my faith.
[1:02:15] He is not talking about his faith now,
[1:02:18] but he is commending them for their
[1:02:21] faithfulness. And he and he does he also
[1:02:24] mentions their
[1:02:26] patience. Now faithfulness and patience
[1:02:29] go
[1:02:30] together. In fact, patience is the
[1:02:34] outcome of faithfulness. For it says in
[1:02:37] James 1:3, "The trying of your faith
[1:02:41] workketh."
[1:02:43] Okay? Patience. See, there is absolutely
[1:02:46] no other way in which to gain patience.
[1:02:50] It has to come by the trial of our
[1:02:54] faith. Romans 5:3, tribulation workketh
[1:02:58] patience. How highly God regards this
[1:03:02] outworking of our patience is seen in
[1:03:05] James 1:4. But let patience have her
[1:03:09] perfect work, that ye may be
[1:03:13] perfect and
[1:03:15] entire, lacking nothing.
[1:03:19] See, God's will for us is perfection.
[1:03:24] I want you to say, God's will for me
[1:03:27] is perfection.
[1:03:29] And that perfection is patience. Waiting
[1:03:33] on God and waiting for God.
[1:03:37] This is the process of
[1:03:41] character development
[1:03:46] in Christ the mystery. He said, and I'm
[1:03:49] not going to go there, but I'm just
[1:03:50] going to just say this one thing. He
[1:03:52] said, "We got to stay right together."
[1:03:55] He said, "You got to stay right
[1:03:57] together." Now he says now if a brother
[1:03:59] if the brother you think he's a little
[1:04:02] wrong or the sister say now Lord don't
[1:04:05] never let me have the root of bitterness
[1:04:09] spring up cuz it'll affect
[1:04:12] them. It'll affect who? It'll affect the
[1:04:15] person that has the root of bitterness.
[1:04:17] It'll take the Christ out of out of my
[1:04:21] life. Listen, if I have the root of
[1:04:24] bitterness in my life, it's not going to
[1:04:25] take it out of brother Davey's life. is
[1:04:28] going to take it out of my life.
[1:04:31] You get what he's saying here? So it it
[1:04:34] it you have to you have to bear the
[1:04:36] responsibility for yourself. It's your
[1:04:39] responsibility to get the root out of
[1:04:41] your own life. This is the process of
[1:04:44] character development. Just because we
[1:04:46] reach a certain age doesn't mean we're
[1:04:48] not still developing.
[1:04:50] We're still spiritually developing. As
[1:04:52] long as we're breathing, as long as
[1:04:54] we're still in this life, we're still
[1:04:55] growing. We're still maturing. Every
[1:04:58] year we've got to bear fruit
[1:05:02] because we're going through seasons. We
[1:05:04] go through seasons of life. And every
[1:05:06] year there's another season. And think
[1:05:08] about it. The tree the the leaves fall,
[1:05:11] right? The tree looks barren and then
[1:05:13] the spring comes and the fruit comes
[1:05:15] again. It's constantly going through
[1:05:18] changes. It's constantly developing.
[1:05:20] It's constantly Come on, stay with me
[1:05:22] here. So you are constantly going
[1:05:25] through character
[1:05:27] development. Here it is. The poison
[1:05:30] acids of malice. Sometimes you just need
[1:05:33] to look up these words
[1:05:35] yourself. And jealousy and hatred. I
[1:05:38] know this is not in any church. Praise
[1:05:40] God. That'll just take the Holy Spirit
[1:05:43] right away from
[1:05:45] you. Now I I guess this is the right
[1:05:48] word to use. This is in a sense a
[1:05:50] paradox. The Holy Spirit is so powerful
[1:05:52] but yet
[1:05:56] timid. It'll run him from the tabernacle
[1:05:59] here. It'll kill the spirit of God or
[1:06:03] drive it away from here. It'll hurt your
[1:06:06] pastor. It'll do everything. See, he
[1:06:08] says, "Don't you do that." So what he is
[1:06:10] saying here is that if you allow this
[1:06:13] root of bitterness to come up and that
[1:06:15] bitterness is because of a lot of times
[1:06:16] it's past things that have happened or
[1:06:18] something that you just can't get out of
[1:06:20] your life and and it just begins to work
[1:06:22] and then there's envy and there's anger
[1:06:24] and there's things that just keeps
[1:06:26] coming back at you or this malice or
[1:06:28] this uh jealousy or this hatred whatever
[1:06:30] it is. Uh he says what it does is it is
[1:06:33] it creates this this atmosphere in the
[1:06:36] church that'll kick Christ right out of
[1:06:38] the building.
[1:06:41] And then the pastor or the minister the
[1:06:43] pastor is praying and studying and
[1:06:46] working and trying to get the mind of
[1:06:48] the Lord and he's wondering why it's so
[1:06:50] hard and why it's so difficult. And it's
[1:06:52] just because there's a root of
[1:06:53] bitterness in the
[1:06:55] church. And we who claim to be prophet
[1:06:59] followers, follow me as I follow Christ.
[1:07:01] You follow. You see what I'm saying? And
[1:07:03] what is he saying? He says, if we allow
[1:07:05] this to stay in our life and we're not
[1:07:06] willing to go through character
[1:07:09] development, then we are basically
[1:07:12] kicking God out of the church with our
[1:07:15] hands raised.
[1:07:20] He said, "You just wax that much closer
[1:07:23] together.
[1:07:27] Oh, I love that. Don't you? Says, "Take
[1:07:30] the buckle." As the brother testified,
[1:07:33] minister here the other night having a
[1:07:34] buckle, seeing it at a vision that
[1:07:37] buckles on the whole armor of God. Just
[1:07:40] pull her on. Tighten up. Come on,
[1:07:43] brothers. Tighten up. Sisters, tighten
[1:07:47] up. Well, no wells about it.
[1:07:51] Tighten up. Love one another. Forget the
[1:07:55] past. God forgot your past.
[1:08:02] Hallelujah. Just pull her on. Tighten
[1:08:05] up. Move right close to one another.
[1:08:06] Love one another. Talk nice about one
[1:08:09] another. Say nice things about one
[1:08:12] another. I just feel just a
[1:08:14] little like like the devil's just like
[1:08:17] kick them
[1:08:19] off. Talk nice about one another. Say
[1:08:21] nice things about one another.
[1:08:24] Oh,
[1:08:27] and
[1:08:27] then God will bless you. Why won't God
[1:08:32] bless me? Why won't God bless me?
[1:08:33] Because you ain't saying nice
[1:08:36] things. Do you realize it was that
[1:08:40] easy? Now, I don't know who the
[1:08:42] commentator was here, but I thought this
[1:08:43] was good. It doesn't only or always just
[1:08:47] take a sledgehammer to break a rock into
[1:08:50] little pieces. Now, obviously, a
[1:08:52] sledgehammer will do the job, but it's
[1:08:55] not the only way to do it.
[1:08:57] Fascinatingly, it really only takes a
[1:09:00] little bit of water and a temperature
[1:09:02] variation to do the
[1:09:04] trick. In a process known as weathering,
[1:09:08] a small amount of water can seep into
[1:09:10] the crack of a rock. And if the
[1:09:13] temperature gets cold enough, that water
[1:09:16] will freeze. And as it freezes, it
[1:09:19] expands and begins to widen the cracks
[1:09:22] and split the
[1:09:24] rocks. Now, what's true in geology is
[1:09:27] also true in
[1:09:29] ecclesiology. Churches aren't always
[1:09:32] just broken up by big things such as
[1:09:34] false teachings, moral scandals,
[1:09:36] leadership failure, or outside
[1:09:38] influences. It's always those things.
[1:09:41] No, it can do
[1:09:43] it. But it's not always it. Yes, they
[1:09:47] can do the job, but it's not always what
[1:09:50] happens in the life of the church.
[1:09:52] Rather, it's the little things that seep
[1:09:56] seeps into the
[1:09:58] worship and the fellowship of the
[1:10:01] church that given the right conditions,
[1:10:05] if we allow these things, these little
[1:10:07] these little conversations, these little
[1:10:10] moments to seep in and given the right
[1:10:13] conditions, the right
[1:10:15] temperature often fractures a
[1:10:19] congregation. When people's attitudes,
[1:10:23] personalities, preferences, and opinions
[1:10:26] meet with a coldness and
[1:10:29] indifference,
[1:10:31] congregations
[1:10:33] break. Big sins have slain a thousand
[1:10:37] churches and little sins have slain
[1:10:39] 10,000.
[1:10:42] You see, division is one of Satan's
[1:10:46] greatest weapons to slow or to stop
[1:10:51] God's
[1:10:52] work. Now, what good is it to come to
[1:10:55] church if we want to kill the spirit by
[1:10:56] allowing bitterness in our life? What
[1:10:59] good is it? And I think about this. I
[1:11:01] don't want that to happen. I've had bad
[1:11:02] things happen to me. Brother Billy, I
[1:11:06] like you because I know you're an honest
[1:11:07] person. Can I ask you a question? Will
[1:11:08] you answer honestly? Of course you will.
[1:11:11] I just said, "You're an honest person."
[1:11:12] He's scared now. You see his eyes? He's
[1:11:15] like, "What are you gonna say? I'm not
[1:11:17] going to throw you under the bus,
[1:11:18] brother." Have you ever had anything bad
[1:11:20] happen to you in your life? To you
[1:11:23] personally? Absolutely. How many here
[1:11:25] has ever had anything bad happen to you
[1:11:27] in your life? Only a few of you. Wow,
[1:11:29] man. You guys are good people. How about
[1:11:31] let's be honest and raise your hand. How
[1:11:33] many's ever had anything bad happen to
[1:11:34] you personally in your life? For those
[1:11:37] that are honest, good.
[1:11:41] Now, you had a
[1:11:43] choice what to do about
[1:11:46] it. Now, you're still in these this old
[1:11:50] coat. You're still in this old coat.
[1:11:52] You're still in this flesh. And Satan
[1:11:54] will still throw that at you. He'll st
[1:11:57] still throw that in the at the womb of
[1:11:59] your
[1:12:00] mind, right? He'll still throw that to
[1:12:03] try to see if he can get that in there
[1:12:04] to try to get you to to uh uh uh you
[1:12:07] know to think on
[1:12:09] that. But if you have given it to
[1:12:11] Christ, if you have given it, then
[1:12:13] you're no longer going to let that be a
[1:12:15] root in your
[1:12:17] life. Because what good is having the
[1:12:21] message if we're always poised to
[1:12:24] disagree with it? What good is having a
[1:12:27] pastor if we're always poised to
[1:12:29] disagree? What good is having a prophet
[1:12:32] if we're always looking for a
[1:12:33] difference? What good is having the word
[1:12:36] if we're trying to find the flaws?
[1:12:40] As if as we could actually be spreading
[1:12:43] the seed of discrepancy or the seed of
[1:12:45] discord, doubt, question, or confusion.
[1:12:49] If we're not careful, we could actually
[1:12:51] become like a man called
[1:12:54] Diotrophies found in 3R John 1 verse 9.
[1:12:58] Now John speaks here and he says,"I
[1:13:01] wrote unto the church, but Diotrophies
[1:13:05] who loveth to have the
[1:13:08] preeminence among them receiveth not us
[1:13:12] not.
[1:13:14] Wherefore if I come, I will remember his
[1:13:17] deeds which he doeth, praying against us
[1:13:20] with malicious words, and not content
[1:13:24] therewith. Neither doth he himself
[1:13:27] receive the brethren and forbidth them
[1:13:29] that that would and casteth them out of
[1:13:33] the church. Now Diatrophes thought too
[1:13:36] highly of himself for some reason he
[1:13:39] did. And that has a that tends to be a
[1:13:41] lot of an issue in the message because
[1:13:43] we are the message. And I'm I'm not
[1:13:47] becoming sacriiggious, but I want you to
[1:13:50] know this is an
[1:13:52] issue where we begin to think too highly
[1:13:56] of ourselves to where we don't come
[1:13:59] under
[1:14:01] headship. Oh, we come to church, but we
[1:14:04] don't come under headship. All we see is
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:08] man. And Diatrophes was this way. You
[1:14:11] see, he didn't want to listen to what
[1:14:13] John had to say.
[1:14:15] He didn't want to hear what he had to
[1:14:17] say. You know, it never actually said
[1:14:18] that Diotrophies was a pastor, a leader,
[1:14:21] or anything. It only said that he wanted
[1:14:23] the
[1:14:24] preeminence. He wanted the authority. He
[1:14:28] wanted to be a leader. He didn't like
[1:14:30] what John had to say. And when those and
[1:14:33] it said that he didn't want to receive
[1:14:34] the brethren. And when those that
[1:14:36] followed the message of John came in, he
[1:14:39] was like, "We don't want anything to do
[1:14:41] with
[1:14:42] them." You see? And so that spirit that
[1:14:45] that if we're not careful comes into the
[1:14:48] church, if we're not careful, we become
[1:14:49] that. I don't want to become that guy.
[1:14:52] Because once we recognize who the
[1:14:54] preeminence is, we realize we are not
[1:14:57] the preeminence. We are nothing without
[1:15:00] him.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah. And listen, when it comes
[1:15:04] down to actually headship in a church,
[1:15:06] which is a shepherd of the church or the
[1:15:07] pastor, we as shepherds or pastors
[1:15:10] realize we're nothing without thee.
[1:15:13] Hello. Headship.
[1:15:16] He didn't like what he had to say. You
[1:15:18] see, we want the Holy Spirit. How many
[1:15:20] can say this? In our churches. We want
[1:15:23] the Holy Spirit in our lives. We want
[1:15:25] the Holy Spirit to help our pastors and
[1:15:27] our families. I don't want to have the
[1:15:29] spirit of datrophies. I don't want to
[1:15:31] have the spirit against these things. I
[1:15:33] want God to be able to uh I want I'm
[1:15:36] going to speaking for you. I I bet you
[1:15:38] want God to be able to help brother
[1:15:40] David
[1:15:42] to be able to get up here and speak the
[1:15:44] word of God to you freely. Whoever comes
[1:15:47] here, the ministry which is a blessing
[1:15:49] to you in this church that God has
[1:15:51] blessed you with, uh you want you want
[1:15:53] them to come up here with the anointing
[1:15:55] of God and not have to fight those
[1:15:57] spirits and speak freely.
[1:15:59] That should be our desires. Listen, this
[1:16:02] should be an oasis. This should not be a
[1:16:05] battleground. Amen. Oh, I hope you get
[1:16:08] what I'm trying to say. That outside is
[1:16:10] the battleground. I understand that
[1:16:12] we're fighting demons here, but I hope
[1:16:15] that you follow what I'm trying to say.
[1:16:16] We we here when we come to the house of
[1:16:19] God, when we come here through those
[1:16:20] doors and we pray for this service, we
[1:16:23] are praying that God clears everything
[1:16:25] out of the way.
[1:16:27] God, I pray that you would help the song
[1:16:29] leader, that you would help the
[1:16:30] musicians, that the atmosphere is
[1:16:32] created so that the atmosphere is not
[1:16:35] created for just a bunch of this and a
[1:16:37] bunch of that, that the word can come
[1:16:39] forth
[1:16:42] freely. Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] and the deceit of
[1:16:48] discrepancy. Paragraph 65 says, "Now
[1:16:50] notice," he said, "As they did," he
[1:16:52] said, "then the Bible said, he said, uh,
[1:16:54] and John spoke to to his children." He
[1:16:56] said, "Now little children, you have
[1:16:58] heard of the Antichrist, which was to
[1:17:00] come into the world." He said, "Now,
[1:17:02] which already is in the world, and it
[1:17:05] working in the children of
[1:17:06] disobedience."
[1:17:08] Now what was along about 30 years after
[1:17:11] the coming of the Holy Ghost we find
[1:17:14] when the Holy Ghost come the real seed
[1:17:17] the real lifegiver to the seed then here
[1:17:20] comes that discrepancy in
[1:17:22] again and noticed on it
[1:17:25] went the real word had been vindicated
[1:17:28] them prophets of old had vindicated the
[1:17:30] word of God to be the truth as they went
[1:17:33] down if anybody ever read the Nika
[1:17:35] council or the pya council
[1:17:37] them 15 days of bloody politics when
[1:17:40] them bunch of Romans down there wanted
[1:17:42] to bring in and make a denomination of
[1:17:44] that church prophets came in and wrapped
[1:17:47] in sheep skin eating herbs stood for
[1:17:50] that
[1:17:52] word. But what did it do? It had to be
[1:17:55] like
[1:17:56] Cain. It had to be like
[1:17:59] Abel. One had to
[1:18:02] die. Certainly it did.
[1:18:06] Catch this statement. And the word lost
[1:18:11] its
[1:18:13] influence amongst the
[1:18:16] people. Don't let the
[1:18:19] word lose its
[1:18:22] influence. I'm not just speaking of in
[1:18:25] the
[1:18:26] church. Listen, the word should not just
[1:18:29] only have effect
[1:18:30] here. The word should be effective in
[1:18:33] your homes.
[1:18:35] It should be effective in your cars, on
[1:18:38] your
[1:18:40] jobs. And they all voted out the true
[1:18:44] word and took dog in dogmas of
[1:18:46] discrepancy of the early Catholic
[1:18:49] Church. They added a pope. They added a
[1:18:51] bishop and this and that and the other.
[1:18:53] They taken away the real true meaning of
[1:18:56] Peter, of Mary, and all the rest of it
[1:18:58] and made idols and made nothing but just
[1:19:01] a pagan ceremony out of so-called
[1:19:05] Christian religion. What was it? Seed of
[1:19:10] discrepancy and organized organized for
[1:19:14] the first time on earth a church. What
[1:19:16] was it? seed of discrepancy which
[1:19:18] started sewing something adding to it
[1:19:21] taking away. Can't you see what is
[1:19:24] happening here? Think about what is
[1:19:26] going on all over as it were in this
[1:19:29] message. I have in my sense I have never
[1:19:32] seen as it were such a falling away.
[1:19:36] men and women, young people, not just
[1:19:38] young people, but as it were, fathers
[1:19:40] and mothers and grandparents and
[1:19:42] pastors, evangelists falling all over.
[1:19:46] And it's not for worldly things. It's
[1:19:49] for religion.
[1:19:53] Could we have lost touch with his true
[1:19:57] character? Because we lost
[1:20:00] influence with the word.
[1:20:03] We stopped allowing the word to
[1:20:05] influence us and allowed other things to
[1:20:09] influence us. And when we lose the
[1:20:11] influence of the word, we're actually
[1:20:13] losing influence of his
[1:20:17] character. We have become content with
[1:20:20] the Sunday morning high.
[1:20:24] something that soothes the mind.
[1:20:26] Something that gives us the the the fix,
[1:20:28] the the ease that I'm okay. The
[1:20:32] ibuprofen, the al
[1:20:34] leave, but ibuprofen doesn't fix the
[1:20:40] problem. A leave doesn't fix the a
[1:20:43] problem. Listen, hydrocodone don't fix
[1:20:45] the
[1:20:47] problem. It only masks it.
[1:20:53] But there's
[1:20:54] more. Why take a
[1:20:57] substitute when there's a whole
[1:20:59] Pentecostal skies full of the real?
[1:21:03] Why eat in a garbage can when there's a
[1:21:05] fine big clean table set here with
[1:21:08] chicken and dumplings and everything?
[1:21:10] Hallelujah. Why don't we do that? See,
[1:21:14] let's get the real That's what we want.
[1:21:15] A real genuine one. You see, the word
[1:21:18] tells us constantly to be prepared, to
[1:21:21] be sober, to be vigilant, to make our
[1:21:24] calling and election sure. So much
[1:21:26] that's telling us and warning us to get
[1:21:28] ourselves ready, to not be content with
[1:21:31] all of those
[1:21:33] things. But to have character
[1:21:35] development, to not go out into the
[1:21:37] world. I mean, no wonder nobody wants to
[1:21:38] to have
[1:21:41] this with our attitudes. Not you.
[1:21:43] Remember, I already told you in the
[1:21:44] beginning, this is not you.
[1:21:47] Don't don't don't look at me like you
[1:21:49] just ate something
[1:21:50] bad. It's not you. But no wonder they
[1:21:53] don't want this with our attitudes and
[1:21:55] our better than thou and our you see we
[1:21:59] don't want to be that
[1:22:01] Pharisee thinking that we're all that
[1:22:04] because we've got the message of the
[1:22:06] hour. Is it too late for character
[1:22:10] development to where I cringe at times
[1:22:13] when we sometimes go to a
[1:22:15] restaurant or when we go to out in the
[1:22:18] public to wonder how we might treat
[1:22:21] somebody.
[1:22:24] How many can say
[1:22:27] that? You see, you follow me? When we
[1:22:29] because they they might make an error.
[1:22:31] God forbid you've never made one.
[1:22:36] You say, "Brother Jeremy, that's
[1:22:38] nothing. That's not spiritual
[1:22:42] things." All
[1:22:44] right. We must look at the
[1:22:47] character of our
[1:22:49] decisions. Not the emotion of a
[1:22:51] decision, the character of a decision.
[1:22:56] If the Bible tells us to be sober, to be
[1:23:00] vigilant, to make our calling and
[1:23:02] election sure, and so much and all of
[1:23:04] these things, warning us, preparing us,
[1:23:07] I believe that we should do these
[1:23:09] things. And and when we look at one
[1:23:12] another, we don't want to get caught up
[1:23:13] in the emotion of things and all these
[1:23:15] things. We want to look at the character
[1:23:16] of things. You know, there are things
[1:23:19] and I and I want to bring this out to
[1:23:21] two different sides of the story because
[1:23:23] this is begins what happened. And do you
[1:23:24] realize that we're all different here
[1:23:26] right now?
[1:23:28] Shocking. We're all raised in different
[1:23:32] families. So you in this church right
[1:23:35] now, shockingly, we might actually have
[1:23:37] different
[1:23:40] convictions, and that's
[1:23:44] okay. Now, what I'm talking about, I'm
[1:23:47] not saying now, the prophet of God laid
[1:23:49] out certain things that line up with the
[1:23:51] word. Now, I'm not talking about those
[1:23:52] things.
[1:23:54] I already fixed that because I heard
[1:23:56] that. See, what did you hear? I just I I
[1:23:59] already heard
[1:24:00] it. Now, there are convictions that
[1:24:03] people do have and do not have. Now,
[1:24:06] some of that that the prophet Now, do
[1:24:08] you realize that there are some things
[1:24:10] that the prophet never
[1:24:12] addressed? Well, what are we going to
[1:24:14] do? What are we going to do about the
[1:24:17] iPad? He never addressed it.
[1:24:24] We must look at the
[1:24:26] character of our
[1:24:28] decisions. You see our attitudes towards
[1:24:31] our fellow brothers and sisters. You
[1:24:33] want to test someone's character without
[1:24:34] realizing it? Accidentally stepped on
[1:24:37] accidentally step on their earthly
[1:24:40] conviction. Find out where they
[1:24:42] stand in that
[1:24:46] moment. I'm going to say that again. You
[1:24:48] want to find out where you
[1:24:51] are, have somebody accidentally step on
[1:24:54] your
[1:24:56] conviction without meaning
[1:24:58] to or maybe they meant to and see how
[1:25:02] you
[1:25:04] react. Bless God. No, there should
[1:25:08] not character
[1:25:11] development in how we react. I'm not
[1:25:16] telling you to be a pansy and to not
[1:25:18] stand up for the word of God. We should
[1:25:20] hold our swords. But we Why have we
[1:25:23] turned swords against one
[1:25:25] another? No wonder Satan is sitting in
[1:25:27] the chair laughing. Because he's got us
[1:25:30] to turn our swords against one another.
[1:25:32] No. No. Let's turn towards our
[1:25:36] enemy. Think about this. So, as we as we
[1:25:39] look in this and we we look at the
[1:25:41] character of our decisions, sometimes we
[1:25:44] look at the outside decision and we're
[1:25:46] so quick to judge somebody because of
[1:25:49] what they see because they do something
[1:25:51] different than how we were raised.
[1:25:58] But give it time.
[1:26:01] If it's
[1:26:03] wrong and if they are under character
[1:26:07] development and you're praying for them,
[1:26:10] God will bring them around.
[1:26:13] But what good are you doing for them if
[1:26:16] you're
[1:26:20] fuming? Didn't you want somebody to pray
[1:26:23] for you when you were a little bit off
[1:26:27] or a way off?
[1:26:32] I I thank God that I had praying people
[1:26:35] for
[1:26:40] me in the Samaritan church uh age. He
[1:26:43] says, "Unless we suffer with
[1:26:45] him, we cannot reign with him." You
[1:26:49] already know this quote. You have to
[1:26:51] suffer to reign. The reason for this is
[1:26:55] that character simply is never made
[1:27:00] without suffering.
[1:27:05] You know, it's funny. Maybe it's not.
[1:27:08] Lord, should I say this? It is
[1:27:13] funny to sit back sometimes, Brother
[1:27:16] Davey. I'm going to talk to you for a
[1:27:17] minute. Nobody else is here right now.
[1:27:20] And I, you know, I I've been to meetings
[1:27:23] and and youth camps and all kinds of
[1:27:25] things and I sit back sometimes and and
[1:27:28] it's funny to watch people look at other
[1:27:32] people. And you say, "Well, you're
[1:27:34] looking at them, too." I
[1:27:35] am. I've just admitted it to you. But
[1:27:39] you see, what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:27:41] is to watch their faces as they look at
[1:27:44] other people.
[1:27:49] What do you call that? What is that
[1:27:50] called, dear? Where's she
[1:27:52] at? What is that called? Their face has
[1:27:57] emojis
[1:27:59] or expressions or where's my wife?
[1:28:04] Subtitles. You're if the subtitles could
[1:28:08] talk,
[1:28:16] where were
[1:28:17] you at one
[1:28:21] day? Listen, you might have come out of
[1:28:24] the
[1:28:25] womb with
[1:28:29] perfection, okay? But you
[1:28:33] weren't. Let's just be honest. Our
[1:28:36] righteousness is filthy rags.
[1:28:41] We got to go back to the character.
[1:28:45] Character simply is never made without
[1:28:48] suffering. Character is a
[1:28:58] character is a
[1:29:01] That's a little better. Not a gift.
[1:29:06] Not a gift. You're not just going to sit
[1:29:08] there in that pew and say, "God, give me
[1:29:10] give me character. Give me give give me
[1:29:13] character. Let those gifts fall. Give me
[1:29:15] character." No. You got to do what we
[1:29:18] said this morning. You got to press.
[1:29:22] You got to fight for it.
[1:29:25] Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] A man without
[1:29:28] character can't reign, but Diotrophies
[1:29:31] thought he could.
[1:29:35] He can't reign because power apart from
[1:29:38] character is satanic.
[1:29:41] But power with character is fit to rule.
[1:29:46] You see again this is another portion of
[1:29:48] that possession. We have got to possess
[1:29:51] this character and it is my promise of
[1:29:54] victory.
[1:29:57] Hallelujah. He he says in another place,
[1:30:00] it's what I was trying to say last
[1:30:01] night. That spirit can be baptized into
[1:30:04] the spirit and still not be a
[1:30:06] Christian. You're living right off the
[1:30:09] same life, but the fruit you bear tells
[1:30:12] what you are.
[1:30:15] See, that's right. They can do all the
[1:30:17] signs, pray for the sick, heal the sick,
[1:30:20] and open the eyes, and cast out devils,
[1:30:22] and do all these things living right off
[1:30:24] the same life that's in there. But it's
[1:30:28] still a
[1:30:31] lemon. The
[1:30:33] fruits you're known, Jesus said. And so
[1:30:38] then we find out. That's why I said,
[1:30:40] listen, sometimes we just got to look at
[1:30:42] ourselves in the mirror and check our
[1:30:44] own character.
[1:30:46] See, I'm going to look at the fruits.
[1:30:48] This is something I told my church
[1:30:49] recently. I said, I'm not chasing
[1:30:52] rabbits. You said, what does that even
[1:30:54] mean? I'm not going to chase after
[1:30:56] everything. I'm gonna step back. I'm
[1:30:58] going to watch the
[1:31:00] fruits. It's like little children
[1:31:02] sometimes that come and tattle on one
[1:31:05] another. Come on, you deacons. You
[1:31:07] understand
[1:31:08] that? Pastors all around and
[1:31:12] evangelists, they did this and they did
[1:31:14] that and they did this and they did that
[1:31:15] and they did that. Listen, if we were
[1:31:16] running after every little rabbit that
[1:31:20] happens in the
[1:31:22] church, we got to sometimes watch the
[1:31:25] character, the fruits. We know again the
[1:31:29] true specifics that the prophet
[1:31:31] mentioned. I get that there are things
[1:31:34] uh I I get that there are things that
[1:31:36] the prophet of God lined right out for
[1:31:37] us. We should not deviate
[1:31:41] because they line up with the word. Not
[1:31:43] a prophet's opinion, but the word. And I
[1:31:45] even think that some of the prophet I I
[1:31:47] even think that the prophet's opinion
[1:31:49] should be looked at.
[1:31:51] We have we need to be careful with
[1:31:54] always saying it doesn't pertain to
[1:31:55] salvation
[1:31:57] too. How easy it can become. It doesn't
[1:32:00] pertain to salvation. It may not. But if
[1:32:03] we're not careful, we can say it so much
[1:32:05] that we might actually say it to the
[1:32:07] wrong thing.
[1:32:09] That's right. All
[1:32:11] right. You can spit that one out if you
[1:32:13] want.
[1:32:14] I
[1:32:17] wouldn't. I get that there are things
[1:32:19] that are left up to us. There are things
[1:32:21] that will be left up to you to make a
[1:32:23] decision
[1:32:25] on. You're going to There are going to
[1:32:27] be times you're going to have to make
[1:32:28] your own decision because you don't have
[1:32:31] a
[1:32:32] prophet to make the decision for you.
[1:32:35] I'm coming down. Don't worry. I'm coming
[1:32:38] down. You're going to have to make the
[1:32:39] decision for yourself. Churches and
[1:32:42] homes are
[1:32:46] sovereign. Your home is sovereign. Your
[1:32:48] home is
[1:32:49] sovereign. We can't be Pharisees in our
[1:32:52] own homes looking at someone else's
[1:32:57] home. We need to look at
[1:32:59] character and pray for that home. Not
[1:33:03] with I'm thankful that I'm not like that
[1:33:05] home.
[1:33:07] No,
[1:33:09] we're under character development.
[1:33:14] God, help my home to be an oasis that
[1:33:18] anyone that comes into this home,
[1:33:20] because what good is your home if it
[1:33:22] looks like a home of a prophet, but it
[1:33:24] has the spirit of
[1:33:29] Satan, right? Because if you don't have
[1:33:33] the right character, it's you know
[1:33:38] anyways
[1:33:40] realizing I I'm going to say this for
[1:33:44] myself realizing that I am not God's
[1:33:47] gift to this
[1:33:48] earth but he is everything to
[1:33:52] me. We cease to be
[1:33:55] ourselves and become his character.
[1:33:58] Basically what I'm saying is I'm not
[1:34:00] everything.
[1:34:01] He is my everything. He is my all.
[1:34:06] I get it. I have to as a pastor and as
[1:34:09] an a minister, we have to deal with both
[1:34:11] sides. There are people that you have to
[1:34:13] literally try to bring them because they
[1:34:15] have no self-esteem and you have to
[1:34:18] bring them all the way over here. I
[1:34:20] understand that. But then you got to get
[1:34:22] the other ones over here that are so
[1:34:24] high. I mean, you just said, "Come on.
[1:34:27] you're not that person and you got to
[1:34:29] bring him over here and sometimes
[1:34:32] brother David gets up here and you're
[1:34:33] like man what is he doing and the next
[1:34:35] time he's doing this and you don't know
[1:34:37] what's going but you have to trust the
[1:34:39] shepherd
[1:34:43] but what of the seed think about this as
[1:34:46] we coming down but what of the seed now
[1:34:48] this is I like what this commentator
[1:34:50] said here says can you dig up the
[1:34:53] plant and find its seed down at the
[1:34:57] bottom with the plant bits growing from
[1:35:00] its insides.
[1:35:03] No, it's essentially died to
[1:35:06] itself. It ceases to be a
[1:35:09] seed in order that the plant would
[1:35:13] live. It can no longer find its
[1:35:16] identity, identity in its old self, a
[1:35:21] seed. And in this way, it has died. It
[1:35:24] has ceased to exist as its original
[1:35:30] self. It's becoming something far
[1:35:32] different and lives a new kind of life.
[1:35:36] From the potential of life that is
[1:35:40] contained within the
[1:35:42] seed comes a new life capable of
[1:35:46] producing fruit. Where a seed cannot
[1:35:50] produce
[1:35:51] fruit, its plant form
[1:35:54] can. We got to quit being excited about
[1:35:57] just being a seed
[1:36:01] and start allowing oursel to have
[1:36:04] character development. You ain't
[1:36:06] producing fruit as a seed. You need to
[1:36:09] start growing and becoming a plant.
[1:36:12] Amen. Brother Brandham says if life was
[1:36:14] ever in it, then why wouldn't it just
[1:36:17] come
[1:36:18] forth, put it in the ground, the life
[1:36:21] spring forth, why does all that's around
[1:36:23] that life and all that around that germ
[1:36:25] that no man can find? How is it that
[1:36:29] everything material material around that
[1:36:31] germ has to die? So that so it can
[1:36:34] spring forth in a new life. But
[1:36:36] everything around it must die and rot
[1:36:40] before it can spring forth
[1:36:42] life. So it is with an
[1:36:47] individual. As long as there is any
[1:36:49] human
[1:36:50] injections, human ideas, then God's germ
[1:36:54] of life, the Holy Spirit cannot work. As
[1:36:59] long as Jeremy's still got anything to
[1:37:01] do with it, he cannot work. So, I've got
[1:37:05] to die. I've got to let this where you
[1:37:08] you say you're still I still see you.
[1:37:10] Yeah, you still see this old coat and
[1:37:12] you're going to see this old coat as
[1:37:14] long as we're here. But see, something
[1:37:17] has changed on the inside. Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] The old man is dead and there's a new
[1:37:23] life inside of me. And every day, his
[1:37:26] character is developing. And the only
[1:37:28] way that that character can develop is
[1:37:31] if I crucify the flesh
[1:37:34] daily. Is it too late for a change in
[1:37:37] our life? Is it too late for character
[1:37:40] development? I say no. He's still
[1:37:44] working on me.
[1:37:47] He's still working on you. We are still
[1:37:50] the bride of Jesus Christ. And he
[1:37:53] listen, the bride hath made herself
[1:37:56] ready. Listen, he has prepared. He has
[1:37:59] prepared his word for us. He has given
[1:38:01] us the dress. We are prepared. Listen, I
[1:38:04] want to put it on and I want his
[1:38:06] character. I want his character to be
[1:38:09] Listen, what good is carrying this
[1:38:11] again? If I have the wrong attitude, the
[1:38:13] wrong spirit, and all sorts of things,
[1:38:15] brothers and sisters, when we walk out
[1:38:17] them doors, what are you going to do
[1:38:20] when somebody steps on your
[1:38:22] toes? Not literally, but literally.
[1:38:29] I have seen it to where God, we had this
[1:38:33] type of
[1:38:34] service and the test
[1:38:39] came and the burning rubber
[1:38:45] happened. Character
[1:38:49] development. Is it too late?
[1:38:53] Let's stand for character development.
[1:38:57] You have a
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:05] choice. I don't even know if we know
[1:39:07] that song. I don't even know if I know
[1:39:09] that song. He's still working on me. How
[1:39:13] many knows that
[1:39:15] song? Is that a That's an old like
[1:39:17] Sunday school song, isn't it? Yeah.
[1:39:21] to make me what? I don't know.
[1:39:25] Hey, to make me what? It took him just a
[1:39:28] week to make the moon and stars, the sun
[1:39:32] and the earth and Jupiter and Mars. How
[1:39:36] loving and patient he must be. I don't
[1:39:40] even know what key. He's still working
[1:39:43] on me. Let's go higher. Give me a key,
[1:39:45] sister.
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:48] If nothing else, we sang it once.
[1:39:52] Is he still working on you? Amen. He's
[1:39:56] still working on
[1:39:59] me. To make me what I ought to
[1:40:04] be. It took him just a week to make the
[1:40:08] moon and stars, the sun and the earth
[1:40:12] and Jupiter and Mars. How loving and
[1:40:16] patient he must
[1:40:19] be. He's still working on me. Sing it
[1:40:22] one more time. Oh, and he's still
[1:40:26] working on
[1:40:28] me. To make me what I ought to
[1:40:33] be. It took him just a week to make the
[1:40:37] moon and stars, the sun and the earth
[1:40:41] and Jupiter and Mars. how loving and
[1:40:45] patient he must
[1:40:47] be cuz he's still working on me. Aren't
[1:40:52] you glad that he's loving and patient
[1:40:54] for you?
[1:40:56] You're afraid to answer that, aren't
[1:40:58] you? Aren't you glad he's loving and
[1:41:01] patient for you?
[1:41:03] Shouldn't we be loving and patient for
[1:41:05] our brothers and sisters?
[1:41:08] Let's step back and let character
[1:41:11] development
[1:41:13] happen in our life and see what can
[1:41:16] happen in a
[1:41:18] church when we let the spirit of
[1:41:21] God develop
[1:41:24] us. It's more than just theology. There
[1:41:28] is actually a life. There's a
[1:41:32] growth that happens in daily. I mean
[1:41:35] it's just like this this excitement of
[1:41:38] God bless you my brother. God bless you
[1:41:40] my sister. And we go beyond the
[1:41:43] frustrations of this life.
[1:41:47] Can you just shake someone's hand now?
[1:41:49] Yeah, I can do one. No, you can't. Some
[1:41:52] of
[1:41:54] you
[1:42:02] Hallelujah. And it's happening a little
[1:42:04] bit. That's all
[1:42:08] right. Hallelujah. All
[1:42:13] right. Heavenly Father,
[1:42:17] you've been so good to
[1:42:20] us. Help me,
[1:42:23] Lord, to be good to someone
[1:42:27] else. Lord, I don't know what someone's
[1:42:29] going
[1:42:30] through. I may never know, Father, the
[1:42:34] moment I shake someone's hand or the
[1:42:35] moment I walk by.
[1:42:38] Lord, I pray that I could say the right
[1:42:42] words. God, help me to look at the
[1:42:44] charact to have the right
[1:42:46] character. Forgive me, Lord, for not
[1:42:49] having it when I
[1:42:50] should. Help me to grow. Bless this
[1:42:54] church. I I I sense, Lord, I I I sense a
[1:42:57] desire and a and a great presence, Lord,
[1:42:59] to want that and to grow, to be a light
[1:43:02] in this dark area.
[1:43:05] I pray that you would bless them,
[1:43:07] Father, to bind together the pastor,
[1:43:10] Father, and first lady, Lord, and and
[1:43:11] the ministry and all the officers and
[1:43:13] all of the efforts put together, Lord,
[1:43:15] the musicians, Lord. Everybody, Lord,
[1:43:19] push everything aside. All of the
[1:43:21] frustration and the troubles and trials,
[1:43:23] we're going to go through them. The
[1:43:24] church is going to have them. Every
[1:43:26] church will. Satan will see see to it.
[1:43:28] But yet, if we can come to that
[1:43:30] character development every day, realize
[1:43:33] that you have patience for
[1:43:35] us, we could have patience with one
[1:43:38] another. We thank you. We love you for
[1:43:41] this day, Father. As we worship you for
[1:43:43] a few moments, Lord, I pray that you
[1:43:45] would accept our worship because God,
[1:43:47] without you, we're nothing. We thank you
[1:43:49] for your word. We love you. Bless your
[1:43:52] people, but we love you in Jesus name.
[1:43:56] Amen. God bless you, brother Billy. I'll
[1:43:58] let you lead us in some worship. Amen.
[1:44:06] Amen. Did you enjoy that? That was
[1:44:09] refreshing. Amen. It's just so
[1:44:12] wonderful. You know, you you think about
[1:44:16] you hear the message. This is not just
[1:44:18] about scriptures putting together and
[1:44:21] everything. This is what we need for
[1:44:22] tomorrow morning. Yes. Amen. This is
[1:44:24] this is the this is when the rubber
[1:44:26] meets the road. This is the word that
[1:44:29] will give you overcoming power for
[1:44:31] tomorrow. And that's what we need. I so
[1:44:34] appreciate it. And and you know, even
[1:44:36] within our own lives, we have to always
[1:44:38] be reminded that there's a husbandman
[1:44:40] who's working and and when you see
[1:44:42] somebody in the bad shape, just let the
[1:44:44] husbandman in you go to work. Don't look
[1:44:47] at him and criticize, oh, that limb is
[1:44:50] dry and that part is not. Let the
[1:44:52] husband, let something within your heart
[1:44:54] and say, "Lord, I know you can water
[1:44:56] that tree. I know you can do. I know you
[1:44:58] could take away the dry limbs and just
[1:45:00] bring it right back to life and
[1:45:02] everything." He does for us every day.
[1:45:05] You know, we'll go and, you know, you
[1:45:07] know, as our brother spoke, you know,
[1:45:09] there's days where we go, everything is
[1:45:11] okay, and then there's a day where we
[1:45:12] lose it. You're like, you know, I
[1:45:14] thought I was a lot further than I am.
[1:45:16] What is it? It's God bringing you back,
[1:45:18] trying to trim that ego, you know,
[1:45:20] trying to to take away. Well, I know the
[1:45:22] mysteries and then all of this. Now,
[1:45:24] he's like, no, you here, you part of
[1:45:26] you're just like all the others.
[1:45:29] No big guy, no little you. You know, all
[1:45:32] we're trying to do is everybody at the
[1:45:34] post of duty serving God. That's our
[1:45:37] heart's desire. Amen. What song can we
[1:45:40] sing?
[1:45:43] You have one? No.
[1:45:47] This lot of mine.
[1:45:49] All right. This little light of mine.
[1:45:51] Let's try an F.
[1:45:54] This little light of
[1:45:56] mine. I'm going to let it shine. Oh,
[1:46:01] this little light of mine. Oh, I'm going
[1:46:04] to let it shine. Oh, this little light
[1:46:08] of mine. Oh, I'm going to let it shine.
[1:46:12] Oh, let it shine. Let it shine. I let it
[1:46:17] shine.
[1:46:19] Oh,
[1:46:21] let it out. Oh, I'm going to let it
[1:46:25] shine. Oh,
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:36] let it shine. Oh, let it shine. Let it
[1:46:40] shine. Let it shine.
[1:46:44] Oh, and I
[1:46:47] b Oh, I'm going to let it. Oh, and I b
[1:46:54] Oh, I'm going to let it. Oh, and
[1:46:59] I'm show Oh, I'm going to let it. Oh
[1:47:08] my
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] little
[1:47:18] [Applause]
[1:47:28] shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.
[1:47:33] Don't let it blow up and don't let it
[1:47:37] blow it out. I'm going to let it Oh, I
[1:47:43] don't blow it up. Oh, I'm going to let
[1:47:46] it shine. Oh, I know.
[1:47:50] Let it out. Oh, I'm going to let it
[1:47:53] shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:02] Oh
[1:48:06] sh
[1:48:09] Oh
[1:48:12] no.
[1:48:15] Oh
[1:48:18] sh. Oh it is high. It is high. It is
[1:48:25] high.
[1:48:27] Hallelujah. And that's what we want to
[1:48:29] do. We want to go out of here shining
[1:48:31] the light of Christ within our lives.
[1:48:34] And and I love it. I mean, I don't want
[1:48:36] to repreach what's been praised, but
[1:48:38] it's it's a conscience decision. It's
[1:48:41] it's when you are in the right mind to
[1:48:43] know that this is the devil. Uh you
[1:48:45] know, because if you lose that
[1:48:47] consciousness, that's when we blow it
[1:48:49] up, right? But you need that
[1:48:52] consciousness of the word of God in you
[1:48:54] to know that this is not that person.
[1:48:56] And this is the enemy trying to attack
[1:48:58] me to get me out of my elements. This is
[1:49:02] the enemy trying to shake me up so I
[1:49:04] lose it. I'm not going to lose it
[1:49:05] because there's a life of Christ in me
[1:49:08] and I'm going to in fact I'm going to
[1:49:10] pray for that person so God can touch
[1:49:12] their lives. Amen. That we may be I love
[1:49:15] it. that we may be all bound together,
[1:49:18] you know, as a just a beautiful bouquet
[1:49:20] that God is building for himself from
[1:49:23] all nations, from all every places that
[1:49:26] God has gathered together. You know,
[1:49:28] I've always said that nobody can put all
[1:49:30] of this together. I mean, we have
[1:49:32] different interest. We love different
[1:49:34] things. We eat different foods. We dress
[1:49:37] differently. We talk different
[1:49:38] languages. Who can do this? Who is it?
[1:49:42] It's God in the purpose of himself
[1:49:45] building what he wants to build. And

[1:53:09] kind heavenly father, we thank you,
[1:53:10] Lord, once again for expression of
[1:53:13] yourself to us, Lord. It's a quickening
[1:53:16] power, Lord. It goes beyond even our our
[1:53:20] thoughts, our minds, down into the heart
[1:53:23] of the matter where we really live.
[1:53:27] Lord, may we have an everlasting
[1:53:30] benefit, Lord, for having been in the
[1:53:32] service tonight,
[1:53:33] Lord. May you just continue to develop,
[1:53:37] Lord, is you you said in your word
[1:53:41] that I am the vine, ye are the branches,
[1:53:44] and the branches bear the fruit. Lord,
[1:53:47] may we we be that life expressed. Lord,
[1:53:53] it can only come from the branch that
[1:53:55] has everlasting life. Lord, this world
[1:53:58] is desiring to see love expressed. Yes.
[1:54:02] And the only real true love is in the
[1:54:05] bride of Christ.
[1:54:07] Lord, may you continue to develop that
[1:54:09] love in us, Lord. May we draw ever
[1:54:11] closer to you, Lord, as we bind our
[1:54:14] hearts together, Lord. We we pray that
[1:54:17] you
[1:54:18] just continue to be with those that are
[1:54:21] apart from us, Lord. The sick, the
[1:54:23] needy, the absentees. Even in this
[1:54:26] service tonight, Lord, there's many we
[1:54:28] can look around and say, "Oh, how I miss
[1:54:30] them. I desire that they be in the house
[1:54:32] of God. Help us, Lord." Yes.
[1:54:38] Lord, may your word continue to benefit
[1:54:40] us throughout the week as we just
[1:54:42] endeavor to serve you and draw closer to
[1:54:44] you. Provide for our needs. Go with us.
[1:54:48] Give us traveling mercies on the roads,
[1:54:50] the highways, the byways, on the job,
[1:54:52] wherever it may be. Lord, we trust in
[1:54:54] you. And as a songwriter said, Lord, I
[1:54:58] can't even walk without you holding my
[1:55:01] hand. May it be our comfort. Lord, give
[1:55:03] us strength. We pray as we go from here.
[1:55:06] We just have a a joy within. Lord, we
[1:55:09] ask these things in the lovely name of
[1:55:11] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:16] Amen. God bless you. Man, just uh
[1:55:20] remember those that are out and if you
[1:55:22] didn't see somebody, just pray for them
[1:55:24] that the Lord will give them an
[1:55:26] opportunity for them to be able to come
[1:55:28] to church. Amen. I believe there's
[1:55:30] enough if there's enough love within our
[1:55:32] hearts, God can do anything. Amen.
