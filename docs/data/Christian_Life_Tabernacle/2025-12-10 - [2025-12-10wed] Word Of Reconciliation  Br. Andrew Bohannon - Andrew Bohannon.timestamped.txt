[18:42] [singing] name. I'm so glad that I can
[18:45] say I'm one of them. Oh, hallelujah. I'm
[18:49] [music] one of
[18:52] the one.
[18:55] I'm so [music and singing] glad that I
[18:57] can say I'm one of

[19:21] house of the Lord? Amen. I want to just
[19:23] sing that song if um uh let your word be
[19:27] born in the manger of my heart.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know what key we would try that
[19:32] in, but um
[19:37] it's [music] calling for Eflat. Th those
[19:39] that know the uh the verses, [music]
[19:42] brother Paul Fontaine wrote this song.
[19:44] And so it's I believe he wrote this song
[19:48] and it's just a a wonderful song. We'll
[19:50] try to we'll try to sing this.
[19:55] It was [music] a tiny simple stable
[19:59] [snorts] albe [singing]
[20:06] [singing and music]
[20:08] for a king to be born.
[20:13] He didn't [music and singing] choose
[20:14] some place special
[20:17] to reveal his [music and singing]
[20:19] majesty.
[20:21] So I know if I give him control,
[20:26] he'll be born [music and singing] in me.
[20:31] And the word
[20:35] be [music]
[20:37] in the manger of my heart. [singing]
[20:42] Let it live in me.
[20:45] Let it fall
[20:48] [music]
[20:49] live inside [singing] this house of gra
[20:54] and boldly [music and singing] every
[20:56] day.
[20:59] Let your word be born
[21:03] in the manger
[21:06] of my heart.
[21:11] will [music] outwardly out nothing,
[21:16] not much to behold,
[21:20] but lightly
[21:24] [music] for his word.
[21:28] Let every shield this vessel
[21:33] let him have his way [music]
[21:37] from glory unto the glory.
[21:41] You change me day by day.
[21:46] You let me fall
[21:49] [music]
[21:52] in the manger of my heart.
[21:56] [music]
[21:57] Let it live me.
[22:00] Let it start
[22:03] [music]
[22:05] inside this house of clay
[22:09] and [music and singing]
[22:10] it
[22:15] &gt;&gt; let's all stand as brother Angel comes
[22:18] in the name
[22:20] of [music]
[22:21] our
[22:26] will [music]
[22:28] Another day,
[22:30] a much to [music] behold,
[22:35] my life
[22:37] [music]
[22:39] for you.
[22:42] [music]
[22:44] I'll just shield this vessel.
[22:47] Oh, we let you have your way
[22:50] [singing and music]
[22:52] from glory
[22:54] to glory.
[22:56] You change me day by [music and singing]
[22:58] day.
[23:02] Let your [music]
[23:04] word [singing] be born
[23:07] in the manger of my [singing] heart.
[23:11] [music]
[23:12] Let it live.
[23:16] Let it start [music]
[23:20] with
[23:21] his house
[23:26] every day.
[23:29] Let your word
[23:33] in the manger
[23:36] of God.
[23:42] Amen.
[23:44] So your desire tonight, let your word be
[23:47] born in my heart. Amen. [music]
[23:49] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a greater desire
[23:51] that you could have tonight. Amen.
[23:55] Why don't we just bow [music] our hearts
[23:56] together?
[24:00] Heavenly Father,
[24:02] Lord, here we are once again, [music]
[24:04] Lord, in the house of God, Lord, feeling
[24:08] [music] your presence, Lord,
[24:11] knowing it was you that has called us to
[24:13] this place, Lord. And
[24:16] Lord, we [music] met here believing that
[24:18] you have something for us, Lord. And
[24:22] Father, we recognize our inability,
[24:26] Lord, but we're looking to [music] you
[24:28] because we're a needy people, Lord. And
[24:31] Father, you're
[24:33] [music]
[24:34] you're our heavenly father. And we pray,
[24:36] God, to you.
[24:39] Feed us the bread from heaven tonight,
[24:41] [music]
[24:42] Father. as we just want to yield
[24:44] ourselves, Lord. We ask that you [music]
[24:46] would bless us around your word, Lord,
[24:49] and feed our hungry souls. We commit the
[24:52] needs of your people, Lord, desiring
[24:54] your blessings. So, [music] we commit
[24:55] this from the beginning to the end. Pray
[24:58] in Jesus Christ. Amen.
[25:02] Amen. [music]
[25:03] We certainly appreciate the musicians
[25:05] and the music, the songs. It's created
[25:07] an atmosphere.
[25:09] So grateful for that.
[25:12] How many are happy to be in the house of
[25:13] the Lord?
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it's uh something we don't
[25:20] want to take for granted because one of
[25:21] these days it's going to be a reality.
[25:23] This is going to be the last time.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, while we're here, we know
[25:26] there's some important business that God
[25:28] wants to do in each one of our lives.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I [snorts] had this little
[25:34] thought and by the help of the Lord, we
[25:35] won't keep you long, but it was on a
[25:37] thought, word of reconciliation. And
[25:39] we'll turn right to the scripture
[25:41] reading uh in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[25:45] You know something brother David said a
[25:46] couple weeks ago, and while you're
[25:48] turning there, I'll just mention this.
[25:50] It's just uh bubbling on my heart. He
[25:53] made this comment. He says, "Know what's
[25:55] influencing you and where it come from."
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's very important
[26:01] aspect of the Christian walk. Amen. What
[26:04] influences
[26:06] me
[26:08] will infect it will affect or it could
[26:10] infect how you influence others.
[26:14] I think that's such an important
[26:16] recognition every day. You know what's
[26:18] influencing me because it's going to
[26:20] affect someone else. Amen.
[26:24] And the little subject that I have on my
[26:26] heart also that's connected with word of
[26:28] reconciliation is under his influence.
[26:33] So the scripture reading that we're
[26:34] taking here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5,
[26:37] we'll start with
[26:39] verse 12.
[26:48] For we commend not ourselves again unto
[26:50] you, but give you occasion to glory on
[26:54] our behalf, that you may have somewhat
[26:57] to answer them which glory in
[27:00] appearance, but not in heart and not in
[27:03] heart. For whether we be beside
[27:07] ourselves, it is to God. Or whether we
[27:10] be sober, it is for your cause.
[27:14] For the love of Christ constrainth us,
[27:17] because we thus judge, that if one died
[27:20] for all, then we all are dead.
[27:25] and that he died for all, that they
[27:28] which live shall not henceforth live
[27:31] unto themselves, but unto him which died
[27:35] for them and rose again.
[27:38] Wherefore henceforth
[27:40] know we no man after the flesh, yay,
[27:44] though we have known Christ after the
[27:46] flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no
[27:51] more.
[27:53] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[27:56] is a new creature. Old things are passed
[27:58] away. Behold, all things are become new,
[28:02] and all things are of God, who hath
[28:05] reconciled us unto himself by Jesus
[28:08] Christ, and hath given us the ministry
[28:12] of reconciliation.
[28:14] Amen. We trust the Lord will add a
[28:16] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[28:18] may have your seats.
[28:20] We'll also read if you want to turn with
[28:22] me to Isaiah chapter 6.
[28:30] You know, I think that uh if you get a
[28:33] chance, go back and listen to what
[28:35] brother David preached on the battle for
[28:37] influence. I I I was so blessed. I went
[28:40] back and listened to it because, well, I
[28:42] got so much more out of it. But we're
[28:45] just going to try to follow in line with
[28:46] what he preached then and what the
[28:49] brothers had preached. And you know,
[28:51] maybe coming in from a little bit of a
[28:52] different angle. You know, it's the same
[28:54] word. Amen.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; In chapter 6 and verse one, it says
[28:58] this, "In the year that King Uzziah
[29:00] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[29:05] throne high and lifted up, and his train
[29:09] did fill the temple."
[29:11] Well, I'll just stop right there for a
[29:13] minute because can you imagine?
[29:17] Can you imagine seeing this sight that
[29:19] Isaiah saw? The Lord lifted up high. Oh
[29:24] my. To think
[29:26] what that could do to a person.
[29:29] You know what kind of influence
[29:31] &gt;&gt; that would have on a person. You know,
[29:34] it it can it can do something for you.
[29:39] Above it stood the seraph. And each one
[29:42] had six wings. And with twain he did
[29:45] cover his face, and with twain he
[29:47] covered his feet, and with twain he did
[29:50] fly. And one cried unto the another, and
[29:54] said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[29:57] hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[29:59] glory. And the post of the door moved at
[30:02] the voice of him that crith, and the
[30:05] house was filled with smoke. Then I Then
[30:09] said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone,
[30:14] because I am a man of unclean lips, and
[30:17] I dwell in the midst of a people of
[30:19] unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen
[30:22] the King, the Lord of hosts."
[30:26] My, just to think what that vision did
[30:29] for Isaiah. When he saw the the king of
[30:32] glory lifted high,
[30:35] he it recognized himself a sinner.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; And not only that, but he recognized
[30:40] that he was amongst a people that were
[30:42] unclean. Yeah.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; And then flew one of the seraraphin unto
[30:50] unto me, having a live coal in his
[30:53] hands, which he had taken from the tongs
[30:55] off the altar, and laid it upon my
[30:58] mouth, and said, Lo,
[31:02] this had touched thy lips, and thine
[31:05] iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is
[31:09] purged.
[31:10] Woo, that' get somebody excited. Amen.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; I mean to go from one contrast to the
[31:16] other.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; I mean you think about that when a
[31:19] person comes to a place where they can
[31:21] really see the Lord and repent of their
[31:24] ways and ask, "Well, I'm undone."
[31:27] &gt;&gt; But God can take something
[31:30] &gt;&gt; that would place on your lips and
[31:32] cleanse your iniquity. Oh my.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, you think about that now. Now you
[31:38] watch what the difference that it made
[31:41] in his life.
[31:43] He said also I heard a voice of the Lord
[31:46] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[31:50] for us?
[31:52] Then said I here am I send me. Oh my I
[31:56] just I just thank God for these examples
[31:59] because you know when you recognize that
[32:01] you know we've been commissioned to go
[32:03] into all the world
[32:05] &gt;&gt; you know this commission is an honor.
[32:08] It's a sacred thing. you know, when when
[32:11] brother David was preaching about the um
[32:14] the grace and the mercy and you know,
[32:16] it's it's it seems like there's a an
[32:19] invitation for an enlistment. Come,
[32:22] come. You know, the world is pulling.
[32:24] They're calling for recruits to fight in
[32:27] their battle, but God is calling
[32:28] recruits for his battle.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; You know, which which kingdom are you
[32:33] going to give your influence to? Which
[32:35] kingdom are you going to be influenced
[32:36] by? There's two spirits that are now in
[32:41] this world today that are asking and
[32:44] crying out, calling out, will you give
[32:47] your opinion? Will you give your uh, you
[32:50] know, whatever uh gift you've been
[32:52] given, whatever time you've been given,
[32:54] whatever resource you've been given,
[32:57] whatever hands that you've been given,
[32:58] whatever eyesight you've been given,
[33:00] wherever the places that you've gone,
[33:02] the experiences you've had, will you put
[33:04] that towards our kingdom? Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; There's influences out there trying to
[33:11] pull you that direction.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; What influences? What is influencing me?
[33:16] And where is that influence coming from?
[33:19] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a time where we
[33:20] recognize, you know, I didn't come to
[33:23] this place on my own.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; You know, it's the call of God. There
[33:29] was a craving in my heart, a desire to
[33:32] know God,
[33:34] &gt;&gt; you know, and I prayed, "Oh God, just
[33:37] like Isaiah, oh God, I woe is me. I
[33:40] don't want to be like this.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like this. I don't
[33:44] want to talk like this."
[33:46] &gt;&gt; I recognized that I was being influenced
[33:48] by something I didn't want to be bound
[33:50] to anymore.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; But then there was a desire.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Where was that influencing come from?
[33:55] The inside. Something must have been
[33:58] planted there
[33:59] &gt;&gt; way before I got here.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden that that hunger and
[34:05] that thirst was now starting to
[34:07] influence. I don't really like this too
[34:10] much. This is not really satisfying.
[34:12] This is not scratching the itch.
[34:15] I need something more.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; I can't stand this condition that I'm
[34:20] in. Oh, God.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[34:27] Well, we just try to relax oursel a
[34:29] little bit. Get out of the way here.
[34:36] Praise the Lord.
[34:40] You know, Brother Brandham said this in
[34:42] a message called testimony,
[34:46] and it's done me so good because, you
[34:48] know, when we're walking in this world
[34:51] as Christians, we want to be battler
[34:53] trained. We want to be equipped because
[34:56] every day there's an enemy that's out to
[34:59] get you. He's got traps. He's a lot
[35:01] smarter than me and you. But we have a
[35:04] word.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; We have a word that exposes the devil in
[35:07] every one of his tricks, every one of
[35:09] his tactics. Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; He says this in testimony says, I'm not
[35:16] a preacher. Anybody knows that. I'm not
[35:18] a preacher. But it's made up in a
[35:21] spiritual form of watching things and
[35:23] seeing things move and forewarning
[35:26] people and things about what's going to
[35:28] come to pass. And it's just it's my
[35:30] makeup. I can't help that no more than
[35:33] you can help your makeup. He says, "But
[35:36] God has put us each one in the body
[35:40] to do a certain thing. And I watch every
[35:44] little move, every objective, every
[35:47] motive because everything is governed by
[35:51] governed by spirit. Amen. There's
[35:54] everything is governed by spirit.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; All right. This is a simple principle,
[36:00] but it goes for everything.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Everything is governed by spirit,
[36:05] motive, and objective. If whatever
[36:08] you're facing, you can say, "Okay, where
[36:10] where is the motive and objective and
[36:13] the spirit behind this
[36:15] &gt;&gt; in everything?"
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, this church
[36:20] is put here for a purpose. There is a
[36:23] spirit behind this church.
[36:27] Certainly, the spirit behind your home,
[36:30] everything, every behind every building,
[36:32] behind everything, there is a spirit
[36:34] motive and objective. this church comes
[36:37] here [snorts]
[36:39] to greatly exalt some human system or
[36:43] something then its motive is not right.
[36:46] But if you are here to try to achieve
[36:49] something for the kingdom of God, then
[36:52] the motive and objective
[36:55] is both is right. And if the motive if
[37:00] the motives is directed that way, you
[37:03] know, I think it's it's a wonderful
[37:06] time, amen, to consider the influences.
[37:10] What what is motivating? You know, if if
[37:13] you're a young person and you're
[37:15] striving to be somebody in the world and
[37:18] you feel I got to get educated, I got to
[37:20] go to school and I, you know, grind
[37:22] away, but realize there's a motive and
[37:24] an objective behind that. There's a
[37:26] spirit trying to draw you away from the
[37:29] Lord. You know, education is fine, but
[37:32] don't put your trust in it
[37:34] &gt;&gt; because there's no salvation in that.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; There's salvation in the Lord. Amen.
[37:46] back in second Corinthians. I wanted to
[37:50] reread that because that's really where
[37:53] my inspiration lays.
[37:57] You know to think that
[38:00] all things are of God who hath
[38:02] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[38:06] and given to us the ministry of
[38:08] reconciliation.
[38:10] You know when you think about this
[38:13] message,
[38:15] &gt;&gt; this message is Christ. Amen. And when
[38:18] you look and you see that great pillar
[38:20] of fire, you see the the pillar of
[38:23] cloud, you know, I believe we've seen
[38:26] visions in the word of God come to
[38:28] manifestation in this hour.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; It should affect us. It should influence
[38:34] us like it did Isaiah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; It should absolutely thrust us into a
[38:40] recognition. Who was that up there in
[38:43] that cloud? It was the king of glory. It
[38:47] was absolute authority and power.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; This is what has happened in our day. It
[38:54] should cause us to recognize I'm under
[38:57] the the opaces of redemption.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of full restoration,
[39:03] full authority and power.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And I got to I got to, you know,
[39:09] Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I got to
[39:11] pay bills. I got to keep time. You know,
[39:13] we get to this thing where we're so
[39:15] influenced. But I don't want us to lose
[39:17] the bigger picture.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get caught off track and
[39:22] be influenced and be earthbounded.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just to have our minds so set on
[39:28] the next event or the next, you know,
[39:31] uh, great job opportunity or what this
[39:36] education's going to provide for my
[39:38] future. Well, I want to tell you that
[39:41] the influence of redemption tells you
[39:44] you got a home. You got a future.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; You can put your confidence there.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I go to prepare a place for
[39:52] you that where I am, you may be also."
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to let that influence me.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want that to have full dominion
[40:00] in my life.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Though I'm going through the struggle.
[40:04] Life's a struggle. You get certain bills
[40:07] paid and then all of a sudden my knee it
[40:09] just is giving out on me. You know, you
[40:13] get to where you know certain situations
[40:15] in the family start leveling off and
[40:18] then all of a sudden here comes another
[40:20] trial.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Here comes another in issue
[40:23] circumstance.
[40:25] But oh my, just to think that we can be
[40:27] influenced by the redemption claim
[40:31] calling us to perfection here at the end
[40:33] time. Hallelujah.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; You know what a word of reconciliation
[40:40] that has come in this day to reconcile
[40:43] us to the nature that we were we had in
[40:46] Christ.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He had a sinless nature and he's
[40:50] calling us. He He's saying be reconciled
[40:53] to God.
[40:58] Reconciliation is a process of restoring
[41:02] friendly relations
[41:04] after a conflict by addressing
[41:09] past wrongs, making amends, and building
[41:12] trust, and leading to a harmonious and
[41:15] combatible state.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Reconciliation.
[41:20] You know, you might not know what it's
[41:23] like to to have a conflict with a loved
[41:26] one. You might not know, but ever you've
[41:29] been through it and you've come on the
[41:32] other side and reconciliation
[41:34] has happened, then you can really know
[41:37] what he's talking about, what Christ
[41:39] really did for us.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; We were gone. We were lost.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; There was an influence that sucked us
[41:46] away from God. It's called sin. And
[41:49] there was a great chasm. But Christ, he
[41:52] bore our shame. And it was by his blood.
[41:55] It was by his to his atonement that he's
[41:58] reconciled us in Christ.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And now he's giving you the word of
[42:03] reconciliation.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you've been empowered today. G.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; You've been given his spirit.
[42:11] And the same reconciliation that
[42:14] transpired with you and God, now he's
[42:17] saying, "I've given you this word of
[42:18] reconciliation. Go out into all the
[42:21] world. Rec. This word of reconciliation
[42:24] is for you to take.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Go affect your your your world.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Let this spirit influence you to redeem
[42:34] others
[42:35] &gt;&gt; to this word." Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful
[42:39] &gt;&gt; to think that God called you as an
[42:41] individual, a young person, things might
[42:44] be going at school, going ary, and this
[42:46] person's mad at Johnny and Johnny, he
[42:48] threw rocks at uh Frank, and all of a
[42:52] sudden, you're there, and you have the
[42:53] word of reconciliation in your heart.
[42:56] Say, you know what? Hey, you know what?
[42:58] Let's let's let's talk it over.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; You know, you'd be surprised what just a
[43:04] little bit of communication will do.
[43:06] just talk it over.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; You know, he probably didn't mean that.
[43:10] Hey, Johnny, come over here. Hey, Frank.
[43:13] Hey, you remember the last time when we
[43:14] won the the, you know, fifth grade
[43:17] championship football or whatever? Hey,
[43:19] y'all were friends. What happened? Hey,
[43:21] but you know what? This whole thing
[43:23] actually and you talk it over. I don't
[43:26] know all these things, but you know what
[43:28] it's like. You're human. You have human
[43:31] relationships. You have situations in
[43:34] business. Every day the devil's there
[43:36] influencing people's minds. They're
[43:38] going completely insane.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; This world is going completely insane.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And it's having an effect on our minds.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; But I want to stay anointed with the
[43:48] spirit of redemption.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of reconciliation that
[43:53] come to us
[43:54] &gt;&gt; to give us life to know him is life.
[43:59] My,
[44:01] you know, reconciliation is to end a
[44:04] disagreement or a conflict with somebody
[44:07] and start
[44:09] and the start of a good relationship
[44:12] again.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. It sounds like
[44:16] restoration.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I love restoration.
[44:21] My Cuz God promised restoration. He
[44:24] said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord."
[44:27] you know the canker worm, the palmer
[44:29] worm, you know, the devil has come and
[44:31] thrown different wedges, you know, but
[44:35] God's saying, you know what, be ye
[44:37] reconciled. I've given you power. No,
[44:39] I'm that that person, you know, they,
[44:43] you know, but God has called you, God
[44:46] has called me with the word of
[44:48] reconciliation.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I want to be yielded to that
[44:53] influence of the spirit of
[44:55] reconciliation.
[44:57] Amen. Is that your desire?
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It's my desire.
[45:02] Brother Brand, we'll [clears throat]
[45:04] quote Paul here in Ephesians chapter 2.
[45:06] He says this in verse 13.
[45:09] Ephesians chapter 2 and 13.
[45:17] Paul said this. He says, "Now, but now
[45:20] in Christ Jesus, ye were sometimes were
[45:23] a far off, made nigh by the blood of
[45:25] Christ, for he is our peace. He hath
[45:29] made both one and broken down the middle
[45:32] wall petition between us, having
[45:34] abolished in his flesh the eminity, even
[45:38] the law of commandments contained in
[45:40] ordinances. For to make in himself of
[45:44] twain one new man, who make peace, and
[45:49] hath he had that he might reconcile both
[45:54] unto God in one body by the cross,
[45:58] having slain the enmity thereby,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; and came and preached peace to you which
[46:04] were a far off, and to them that were
[46:08] nigh.
[46:10] For through him we both have access by
[46:14] one spirit unto the father. Well, I
[46:17] think that's wonderful.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful. He slew the
[46:21] immunity.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we we can walk with a
[46:25] different fresh attitude. We can walk
[46:27] with with with a encouragement. I have
[46:30] the grace and mercy of God that's it's
[46:33] it's reconciled me to God. It's it's
[46:35] broken down the middle wall petition and
[46:38] now I could go face to face with God.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the desire of the
[46:44] believer. I want to see God face to
[46:46] face. You know, I don't need a
[46:48] secondhand revelation. I want to go to
[46:50] God. I want God to speak to me. I know
[46:52] that he's broken down the middle wall
[46:55] petition by the blood of Christ.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This facetoface encounter creates
[47:01] an influence.
[47:03] Matter of fact, once you get that face
[47:05] to face encounter, it's an absolute.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take it from you. When you
[47:11] get down on your knees and God speaks to
[47:13] you, his promised word to you, it's an
[47:16] absolute. No one can change that. You
[47:18] can live by it. You can put your heart
[47:20] and soul on it. You can say, "God, I'm
[47:23] not moving from this place.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; This is your promised word, and you made
[47:27] it alive to me.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand right here. Nothing
[47:31] else matters. Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I'm governed by that spirit that came
[47:39] &gt;&gt; and spoke to my heart.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He changed things.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; It influenced me to live different, to
[47:45] talk different, to think different. It's
[47:47] still influencing me.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; It's still perfecting me. I'm still on
[47:53] his will. I'm still on the potter's
[47:55] wheel of his grace and mercy.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's not done with us yet.
[48:02] reconciliation, the process of restoring
[48:06] friendship.
[48:07] You know, Abraham was a friend of God.
[48:10] And you know what? When they started,
[48:12] you know, when Abraham did what God said
[48:15] do, he said, "Separate." Then he spoke
[48:17] to him again.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what I want to do. God,
[48:21] you spoke to me about this and this. I
[48:23] know you you're waiting on me to obey
[48:26] your word.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] Lord, reconcile me to your word. I want
[48:33] it. I want it all.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; You know those secrets that of the your
[48:41] future, God can whisper to you just like
[48:45] Abraham because you have a restored
[48:47] friendship by the blood of the lamb.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You know, it's so amazing by this word
[48:58] of reconciliation. And the prophet can
[49:00] say something as simple as you're being
[49:02] reunited with another nature. Your first
[49:05] nature influenced you to do things that
[49:08] were wrong. Influenced you to do things
[49:11] that were for yourself. Amen. But then
[49:14] you come into a reality where God makes
[49:16] known his nature and his character. And
[49:19] then you say, "Wait a minute. Eternal
[49:22] life, which is the gift of God, is to
[49:24] live for others.
[49:26] You know, my heart's desire is to live
[49:28] for you.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I serve God by serving you.
[49:34] The only thing that makes me special is
[49:37] that I've received his grace
[49:39] &gt;&gt; is his love. We're the subjects of his
[49:43] love. That's what makes you so special.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; It's his blood that was precious. But he
[49:49] looks at you as more precious. You think
[49:52] of yourself and you think I'm not
[49:54] precious like the blood of Jesus. But I
[49:57] want you to be under the influence of
[49:59] reconciliation.
[50:02] It was for he the joy that was set
[50:05] before him. He was looking at you when
[50:08] he was under that
[50:11] that burden. If there be any other way,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; But you were the object
[50:20] &gt;&gt; of his joy. You were the object of his
[50:23] love.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to do it because
[50:26] there's no way for you to be reconciled
[50:29] unless I lay my life down, but I will
[50:32] take it up again."
[50:35] What a wonderful God we have to be
[50:38] reunited with another nature.
[50:42] Brother Brandham said this in invisible
[50:44] union. He said, "No sir, no writing of
[50:47] divorcement. He dies. The nature of the
[50:50] world has to die. Every speck of him has
[50:53] to die. And you have to be reunited
[50:55] again with another nature.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you know tonight that by the
[51:01] reconciliation plan of God's word that
[51:04] you can be reunited with another nature?
[51:07] &gt;&gt; You might be pushing and punching and
[51:09] clawing at it, but you know it's a
[51:12] promise.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; You'll be reunited with another nature.
[51:15] Let the word of reconciliation influence
[51:19] you in you to receive this promise
[51:21] tonight. It's God's promise.
[51:27] God has power to fulfill his word.
[51:36] Amen.
[51:40] Brother Brandham said this. Oh, I love
[51:42] this so much. It just
[51:45] I thank God for reconciliation.
[51:48] He says this in just once more Lord in
[51:50] 60 63 he says now
[51:55] you might be tonight you'll accept that
[51:58] salvation but it's already paid for. The
[52:01] debt has been cleared up and the devil
[52:04] that put you in the pawn shop Jesus came
[52:07] and redeemed you and opened up the
[52:10] doors.
[52:12] Why? Thank God that the doors are open.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; You might think about something that
[52:16] you're facing tonight. Whatever it is,
[52:19] something might come to mind. You're
[52:21] like, I've been dealing with this thing
[52:23] and enough already. I want this to be
[52:26] done. Jesus has opened the door to that
[52:30] &gt;&gt; tonight. He's here
[52:32] &gt;&gt; now. This is the instruction. He says,
[52:34] "The only thing you have to do is walk
[52:37] out
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and claim your liberty."
[52:40] Well, I I I thank God that the word of
[52:42] reconciliation is just that simple.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Resist the devil and he
[52:51] will flee."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Before that says, "Submit
[52:56] yourself therefore to God."
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee. This
[53:00] word of reconciliation says if you just
[53:03] walk out on it, if there's something
[53:06] that's harming you in your relationships
[53:09] and you want to feel like, God, I I need
[53:13] reconciliation.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; You walk out on that past and you walk
[53:16] into the future by this word of promise.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; God, your spirit has anointed me.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; You can do like it says even Jesus said,
[53:26] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[53:30] You can say that
[53:32] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord is upon me. The
[53:35] word of reconciliation is in your heart
[53:38] and in your mouth.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you can claim your
[53:43] God-given right.
[53:46] Ain't that wonderful?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to receive from God
[53:54] that the debt you have the receipt from
[53:56] God that the debt is paid. Jesus said in
[54:00] his last words, "It is finished."
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Every redemptive blessing was completely
[54:07] finished.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; The great wrath on sin. When he became
[54:13] sin for us, it was the debt was settled.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan has no more power. Only he
[54:22] can bluff with it.
[54:24] If he can bluff you into it, all right,
[54:28] you have to have it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; But legally, he has no right at all.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Every power that he has was taken from
[54:38] him at Calvary.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; That's where the price was paid. He is
[54:43] nothing but a bluff.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; If you want to listen to his bluff,
[54:47] well, all right, but you don't have to.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You are free tonight.
[54:53] Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; What a word of reconciliation. The
[54:56] devil's been bugging you and bothering
[54:58] you about something. You can take this
[55:00] word of reconciliation. Say, "It was
[55:03] settled at Calvary."
[55:05] &gt;&gt; You're just bluffing me, devil.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; My
[55:15] second Corinthians
[55:17] 5 and we'll read 16- 21 again. I won't
[55:20] be long. I'm trying to be a little bit
[55:22] shorter these days, but
[55:24] you feeling all right,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; sir.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, henceforth we no more know
[55:31] after the flesh. You know, I think
[55:34] that's something. The scripture says,
[55:35] "Wherefore,
[55:37] henceforth know we no man after the
[55:40] flesh." Yeah, I know some of these words
[55:43] for me is kind of hard to understand.
[55:44] And I guess with the old English, you
[55:46] know, certain words kind of seem
[55:48] confusing, but the way I'm reading it is
[55:50] just don't know man by the flesh,
[55:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; You look at a man and you say, "Man,
[55:54] that that guy is tall. That guy is
[55:56] really he uses his arms a lot when he
[55:58] talks or or whatever. That guy, you
[56:01] know, when he talks, he spit in my face
[56:02] or whatever it is." But don't know man
[56:05] after the flesh.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; You see, we want to look behind the veil
[56:10] and see what's motivating him. What is
[56:13] his objective? What's the spirit behind
[56:16] that?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't want to give our time
[56:21] to things that are
[56:23] spirits from the dark world.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; You know, like you shared the gospel
[56:28] with them after they've rejected you,
[56:30] it's time to take your shoes off and get
[56:32] the dust off of them. It's time to take
[56:35] your your your influence somewhere else.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; You know, don't cast your pearls before
[56:40] swine. That's right. This is the word of
[56:42] reconciliation. We want to redeem the
[56:44] time.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; You know Samson had a great secret but
[56:49] he gave that secret. His secret was the
[56:51] word of God. You have the word of
[56:53] reconciliation in your heart.
[56:56] Man,
[56:58] my don't know no man after the flesh.
[57:02] You know, we're called to discern the
[57:04] spirit
[57:06] &gt;&gt; of the man, not the man.
[57:10] Discerning the spirit is what is his
[57:12] objective? What is his motive? What is
[57:13] he trying to accomplish?
[57:18] &gt;&gt; What's influencing you? What are you
[57:20] trying to achieve? What are you trying
[57:22] to accomplish?
[57:23] What am I trying to accomplish? These
[57:25] are all times to take inventory. Our
[57:28] time here on this earth, we can say it's
[57:30] short. It's been said it's like a vapor
[57:32] in the wind. It's here today. It's gone
[57:35] tomorrow.
[57:37] so short that I want to redeem the time.
[57:40] I want to use my influence for the
[57:42] kingdom of God to serve God with joy.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; I've been redeemed.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; We want to have that attitude. You know,
[57:51] I got the word of reconciliation.
[57:55] I'm packing it. It's by the grace and
[57:57] mercy of God. My to think how much power
[58:01] you have inside of you.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; True.
[58:05] It's a sacred virtue.
[58:08] You know, the church of the living God
[58:09] has the ability to impart life.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful. You have that. Just
[58:16] here to stir it up and remind you what
[58:19] our calling is. Amen.
[58:22] We have known Christ after the flesh.
[58:25] Yet now, henceforth know we no more. You
[58:28] know, I think that Paul, you know, when
[58:30] he he says, you know, we've known him in
[58:32] the flesh. Well, he never met him in the
[58:34] flesh,
[58:35] &gt;&gt; he he met him after he returned back to
[58:37] the pillar of fire,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; But, you know, we know him by
[58:41] revelation.
[58:43] You know, if any one of you, you never I
[58:45] don't know if anybody met Brother
[58:46] Brandham that's in this audience
[58:48] tonight. I haven't met him,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; but my no man know no man after the
[58:53] flesh. It's by revelation that we know
[58:56] him.
[58:58] It's by revelation that this promise of
[59:00] reconciliation is to you.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; My how do you become a new creature
[59:13] by grace? Are you saved? Through faith.
[59:17] He says, "Therefore, if any man be it in
[59:19] Christ, he is a new creature. Old things
[59:22] are passed away. Behold, all things are
[59:24] become new, and all things are of God,
[59:26] who hath reconciled us to himself by
[59:29] Jesus Christ, and hath given us the
[59:32] ministry of reconciliation,
[59:34] to that God was in Christ, reconciling
[59:37] the world to himself, not imputing their
[59:40] trespasses unto them, and hath committed
[59:43] unto us the word of reconciliation. Now
[59:46] then, we are ambassadors for Christ. And
[59:50] as though God did in beseech us by you,
[59:55] we pray you in Christstead,
[59:58] be ye reconciled to God. For he hath
[1:00:01] made,
[1:00:03] for he hath made him to be the sin for
[1:00:06] us, who knew no sin, that we might be
[1:00:08] made the righteousness of God in him.
[1:00:12] Well, I I think that if there was ever a
[1:00:14] trade to be made, if there was ever,
[1:00:17] hey, you got a Porsche, I got a Pinto,
[1:00:20] or some people probably don't know what
[1:00:21] a Pinto is, but a Ford Focus.
[1:00:25] Someone has a Lamborghini and you like
[1:00:27] that thing. Hey, we're going to make a
[1:00:28] trade, you know. But what we had was
[1:00:32] filth, impurity, lawlessness.
[1:00:36] What what we had the influence of the
[1:00:38] world and the love of the world. And yet
[1:00:41] here he was.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; My unrighteousness, your
[1:00:45] unrighteousness, your sin is become
[1:00:48] righteousness because of the work of
[1:00:50] Christ. Amen. Oh, I think that's so
[1:00:53] wonderful.
[1:00:55] You know, I think about
[1:00:57] even Job,
[1:00:59] you know, speaking of the effect of the
[1:01:01] vision that Isaiah had. And Job, you
[1:01:04] know, he went through such a difficulty.
[1:01:06] There was so many influences that were
[1:01:08] influencing in his walk with the Lord.
[1:01:11] And had he known that there was a
[1:01:13] meeting, had he known that there was a
[1:01:15] conference between Satan and God, and
[1:01:17] that he was going to be put to the test,
[1:01:20] do you realize you're being put to the
[1:01:22] test every day?
[1:01:24] The devil knows you better than you know
[1:01:26] you. He's had 6,000 years to study man,
[1:01:29] and he's kind of figured you out. He's
[1:01:32] figured me out. But one thing he can't
[1:01:34] touch is that soul. because it's been
[1:01:36] sealed
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; until the day of redemption. But he he
[1:01:40] can access your flesh. He can torment
[1:01:42] you in your mind for a season.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Think about Job going through it, you
[1:01:49] know, one storm after the other. Took
[1:01:51] his children, took his cattle, took his
[1:01:54] livelihood,
[1:01:56] and then took his health. When he's
[1:01:59] down, he's he's getting low. I just
[1:02:03] don't know, man. The battle is raging
[1:02:05] hot. I don't know how much more I can
[1:02:07] take of this. Then his friends come by
[1:02:11] supposed to encourage him. They got
[1:02:13] their influence. Man, Job, you must be
[1:02:16] doing stuff that's wrong.
[1:02:18] You must be a secret sinner. What are
[1:02:21] you doing, man? You're making a shame, a
[1:02:24] mockery, all you got influence.
[1:02:28] There's people in your life that got
[1:02:29] influence,
[1:02:31] you know, and then
[1:02:34] his wife comes to him. Hey, Joe, you're
[1:02:39] looking pretty miserable. Why don't you
[1:02:41] just curse God and die?
[1:02:44] What an influence. What a pool. What a
[1:02:47] test.
[1:02:49] But Job, in the midst of all that,
[1:02:53] there was another influence that struck
[1:02:55] him by the word of Revelation. and he
[1:02:57] saw the vision of the Messiah.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now I know
[1:03:04] my I know my redeemer liveth." You You
[1:03:08] don't think that your trial is any
[1:03:10] different. Your trial is actually for a
[1:03:13] purpose.
[1:03:14] I believe that if we'll let God
[1:03:17] work through our trials and our
[1:03:18] difficulties, keep leaning onto him,
[1:03:21] keep trusting him, the struggle, the
[1:03:24] conflict, the test, the trial, God's
[1:03:26] bringing it
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; for a word of reconciliation.
[1:03:31] There's nothing too hard for our God.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; My,
[1:03:39] what a powerful word of reconciliation.
[1:03:44] to see that and then say caused him to
[1:03:47] speak.
[1:03:49] I know my redeemer liveth. That's what
[1:03:52] the influence of revelation does. It
[1:03:53] causes you to speak. You it causes you
[1:03:57] to do things differently to think
[1:03:59] different ways. like I'm not holding to
[1:04:01] this the the light of this world, the
[1:04:04] candle of this world, the the affections
[1:04:07] of this world, how much stuff I can
[1:04:09] accumulate or how easy I can make it or
[1:04:11] how comfort I could be in this world or
[1:04:14] how much entertainment I can have is I'm
[1:04:17] influenced by a king that I saw high and
[1:04:21] lifted up. Now I want to do like those
[1:04:23] saraphin they were saying holy, holy,
[1:04:26] holy. They they were flying with
[1:04:28] reverence.
[1:04:30] Amen.
[1:04:31] Reverence, holy.
[1:04:34] Oh my. To think that we can do the same
[1:04:37] thing,
[1:04:38] you know, and be in action.
[1:04:42] Isaiah said, "Here am I. Send me."
[1:04:47] I just feel like the word of
[1:04:48] reconciliation does that to us as
[1:04:50] believers. Lord, send me. I want there's
[1:04:54] people and situations in my family
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; in my extended. We're coming into
[1:04:59] Christmas where we have an opportunity
[1:05:01] to influence others.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I want to have the right attitude
[1:05:06] concerning my call my position. You
[1:05:08] know, as we travel this road, we got
[1:05:11] Christ in us. Christ in us can do more
[1:05:14] than we can by ourselves. That's right.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You know, when you're when you're going
[1:05:19] to your family event or your work
[1:05:21] situation, the work having a festival,
[1:05:23] just you making your state your stand,
[1:05:26] say, you know, I don't partake in that.
[1:05:27] God changed my heart. Doesn't have to be
[1:05:30] a big testimony.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't even say nothing.
[1:05:33] Just the fact that you don't entertain
[1:05:35] their jokes or you don't partake in
[1:05:37] their their dainty morsels in their
[1:05:40] lavish uh wineries or whatever. You're
[1:05:44] making your stand. You're showing what's
[1:05:47] influencing you. Redemption has
[1:05:49] influenced me.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Another word for reconciliation. Another
[1:06:00] meaning is is to restore harmony and
[1:06:03] trust after conflict or hurt. a joint
[1:06:06] process involving honest acknowledgement
[1:06:08] of pain, genuine remorse,
[1:06:11] accountability, and a shared commitment
[1:06:13] [music] to changing harmful patterns to
[1:06:16] build a healthier future, going beyond
[1:06:20] an apology to actively rebuild the bond.
[1:06:23] You know, I just tell my family
[1:06:25] recently, I'm interested in having a
[1:06:28] deeper fellowship. I'm interested in
[1:06:30] having a greater connection. You know,
[1:06:33] that's why we're here on earth as a body
[1:06:35] of believers. If I can't have deeper
[1:06:37] connections with my family at home, how
[1:06:39] are we going to have it in the house of
[1:06:40] God?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's just time to to
[1:06:43] to to to be able to express ourselves in
[1:06:46] communion to communicate. That's what
[1:06:49] communion is,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; right? We want to have a heartto-he
[1:06:51] heart. You know what, brother? You know,
[1:06:54] when you made that statement, you know,
[1:06:56] you said thus and thus, you know what? I
[1:06:59] I tell you after you said that I felt so
[1:07:01] empowered and so emboldened. I went to
[1:07:04] this person at my job and I told him the
[1:07:06] things that you influenced me to say and
[1:07:09] you know what it changed my whole world.
[1:07:10] Now I go to work with a joy in my step.
[1:07:13] You know I had this thought that that
[1:07:15] person was against me but you know I
[1:07:17] just went to him and talked to him and
[1:07:18] it was settled. A word of
[1:07:21] reconciliation.
[1:07:23] That's what we have the power to do for
[1:07:24] one another. We want to influence each
[1:07:27] other's lives like this. It's simple,
[1:07:29] but yet it's so hard.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Just like brother Tom said when he was
[1:07:34] ministering sometimes, sorry, is hard.
[1:07:38] But I believe that God, he wants us to
[1:07:40] do the simple things in life. You know,
[1:07:43] we know the seals have been revealed and
[1:07:45] the mysteries. I love that. But let's
[1:07:48] let it have an effect. Let the vision of
[1:07:50] all these inspired. We want to live a
[1:07:53] humble, sweet Christian life. When we're
[1:07:56] wrong, we want to admit it. We want to
[1:07:58] go to God and say, "God, give me the
[1:08:00] boldness. Give me the courage to walk in
[1:08:02] humility. If I'm wrong, please come to
[1:08:04] me, please.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to have no
[1:08:08] trouble at the river.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; We should be able to come to one another
[1:08:12] in sincerity and say, you know what?
[1:08:15] This is what happened. And you know
[1:08:16] what? Did you mean to make me feel
[1:08:18] little? Did you mean to humiliate me?
[1:08:21] Did you? We want to have the liberty of
[1:08:24] the spirit to come to one another and
[1:08:26] talk it over.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; We're a family of God. We're a body. How
[1:08:30] are we going to affect those that are
[1:08:32] out there to come in here if there's
[1:08:34] fractions?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; How are we going to do it? We need to
[1:08:38] let the love of Christ constrain us to
[1:08:40] go to you. I'm sorry. Did I do something
[1:08:43] to you? I didn't mean to hurt you.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; You're a believer. I'm a believer. It's
[1:08:50] the grace and mercy of God has brought
[1:08:52] us TOGETHER SO WE CAN FIGHT TO NOT with
[1:08:55] each other but against the enemy in our
[1:08:57] lives in our loved ones.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; We want to see the Holy Ghost empower
[1:09:01] our children to live an overcoming life.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; To conquer the enemy and the blind,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; you know, forgiveness and reconciliation
[1:09:15] are not the same thing.
[1:09:18] You can forgive somebody, but that's not
[1:09:20] reconciliation.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Someone's done you wrong, you can
[1:09:24] forgive them, but it takes another level
[1:09:28] to have reconciliation. God has given us
[1:09:30] the word of reconciliation.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; You know, reconciliation takes
[1:09:36] collaboration.
[1:09:38] You're going to have to talk.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to talk about
[1:09:42] things that that hurt.
[1:09:45] That's not easy. But by his grace,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; by his mercy, I can do all things
[1:09:50] through Christ Jesus who strengthens me.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You know, if we can't teach by our
[1:09:56] actions as fathers, mothers, brothers,
[1:09:59] and sisters, if we're not living it, how
[1:10:02] are our children going to believe us?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts]
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; We got to be partakers of the very fruit
[1:10:10] that we're talking about. That's what
[1:10:12] this restoration and reconciliation came
[1:10:15] to do is to give us his life.
[1:10:23] My
[1:10:26] Easter Seal brother Bram says this. What
[1:10:28] is the Messiah?
[1:10:30] What is the Messiah?
[1:10:33] Messiah is anointed one.
[1:10:36] Now, if he was the Messiah, being the
[1:10:39] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[1:10:42] word of God to be the redeemer and the
[1:10:45] anointed one and God raised up that
[1:10:48] body, his bride is the anointed one for
[1:10:51] this day.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; It's raised. It's already raised with
[1:10:55] him in the resurrection because these
[1:10:57] two are one.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I thank God for that quote
[1:11:02] because you know what? There's a lot of
[1:11:04] curiosity that people have about this
[1:11:06] quote. But what I want to focus in on is
[1:11:09] the anointing is to fulfill the word of
[1:11:11] God
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; You know, the word of reconciliation has
[1:11:16] come to restore you back to fellowship
[1:11:18] with God.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And now God has chosen you to go into
[1:11:25] all the world and to reconcile the world
[1:11:29] to Christ. How did God do it to you? How
[1:11:32] did God do it for you? Was it your good
[1:11:34] deeds? Was it you feeding the poor? Was
[1:11:36] it your prayers and different things?
[1:11:38] No. It was by the blood of the lamb.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God that came to us.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a wreck. I was a wreck.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; But I'm in his hands now.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; I've accepted his pure word.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And now I can go.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the word of God. The bride is
[1:12:02] anointed. The anointed one for this day.
[1:12:06] Oh my. I thank the Lord for that. Praise
[1:12:11] the Lord. We're going to try to speed up
[1:12:12] a little bit here because I want to try
[1:12:14] to turn a corner. Maybe we won't be but
[1:12:17] another 15 or 20 minutes. Everybody
[1:12:20] feeling okay? Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; If we are going to fulfill the word of
[1:12:28] God to go into the whole world
[1:12:31] under the influence of his redemption,
[1:12:35] you know, I think that it's very
[1:12:37] important. Brother Matthew read this
[1:12:39] quote and I went and listened to how
[1:12:41] brother Brandham said it. You know, I
[1:12:42] think it's important when you listen to
[1:12:44] a minister preach the word of God, I
[1:12:47] think that it's important for you to go
[1:12:49] back
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; as you write in the quotes or whatever
[1:12:52] is if God preached your heart, go listen
[1:12:54] to how the prophet said because you want
[1:12:56] to catch the spirit of the messenger
[1:12:59] because it was Christ. And I'm not
[1:13:01] saying that brother Matthew didn't say
[1:13:02] it in the right spirit. It's just a a
[1:13:04] practice that I do. And I would
[1:13:06] encourage you to do the same because
[1:13:08] sometimes we get one another's spirit,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; right? But we want the spirit of Christ.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; So I went back and I listened to this
[1:13:16] and I thought my when he said religion
[1:13:19] is a covering but salvation is liberty
[1:13:23] is freedom. That's what he said.
[1:13:25] Freedom. So I went back and listened
[1:13:26] [clears throat] it for myself. And then
[1:13:28] I went and listened to it more of it and
[1:13:30] more of it. And I'm like praise God. You
[1:13:34] know I thank God for salvation.
[1:13:37] You know, but salvation,
[1:13:41] you know, religion covers, but he said
[1:13:43] salvation uncovers.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Wow. I don't A lot of us don't want to
[1:13:49] be uncovered. I know I don't. But that's
[1:13:52] what salvation does.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; It exposes us.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The things that are not like Christ.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; But praise God. This is like a hospital.
[1:14:01] This is where we come. God, use the
[1:14:04] instrument in instrumentality of your
[1:14:06] word. Let your Holy Spirit come and cut
[1:14:09] those things out of my life. Burn them
[1:14:11] out because I just want to see Christ
[1:14:13] reflecting in me.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; in you and me.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; I need God to deal with my heart so I
[1:14:23] can see him in you
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; and me. Amen.
[1:14:28] In this message called absolute and
[1:14:31] absolute
[1:14:33] 63 and 1201 he says now every great
[1:14:37] achievement is tied to an absolute. You
[1:14:40] cannot run life without an absolute.
[1:14:44] Well okay if we're being influenced in
[1:14:48] the world and there's a lot of spirits a
[1:14:50] lot of motives and a lot of objectives
[1:14:52] going everywhere. If you cannot run life
[1:14:56] without an absolute,
[1:14:58] this is pretty important. We need an
[1:15:00] absolute.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; You cannot make an achievement without
[1:15:06] an absolute
[1:15:07] [snorts] if it's for it's the final
[1:15:10] typost.
[1:15:12] It's the hitchrack at the end of the
[1:15:14] journey. It's a place where you're tied
[1:15:18] to something.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Well, we need this in life. And I,
[1:15:24] [snorts] you know, the word of God gives
[1:15:26] us vision. It gives us revelation, gives
[1:15:28] us overcoming
[1:15:31] says,
[1:15:33] but I think as a Christian, we ought to
[1:15:35] be tied where we know it is right. See,
[1:15:40] so you got to be tied to something that
[1:15:42] you know is right, where it's right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:15:46] brother David's question was, "What's
[1:15:49] influencing you and where did it come
[1:15:51] from? You know this quote is saying you
[1:15:54] have to know where
[1:15:57] we know it's right.
[1:16:02] Not that we're right
[1:16:06] per se, but we know is right.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a whole, you know,
[1:16:12] when you find out you're wrong, all of a
[1:16:14] sudden sometimes we're like, I'm not
[1:16:15] even a Christian now. I might as well
[1:16:18] forget it. No. No. That's not the way it
[1:16:21] is.
[1:16:22] This is right. I'm wrong.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, let my heart line up with this
[1:16:26] word, the revealed word of the hour.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I know where it's right.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] You can't run life without an absolute.
[1:16:38] Amen. You got to be tied to an absolute.
[1:16:41] He says in 42 he says then when Moses
[1:16:44] met him in the burning bush then he said
[1:16:46] I am which remainth the same three
[1:16:50] yesterday today and forever still the
[1:16:52] same God and Moses met him in the
[1:16:55] burning bush. He was that light and when
[1:16:58] he led the children of Israel out of the
[1:17:01] wilderness he was the angel of the
[1:17:02] covenant that Moses by faith saw. He
[1:17:06] forsook Egypt, esteeming the reproach of
[1:17:08] Christ's greater greater treasures than
[1:17:11] of Egypt. By faith, Moses saw that that
[1:17:15] was Christ, the anointing. Amen. You
[1:17:18] know, I think that's that was Moses
[1:17:21] absolute when he came in contact with
[1:17:23] the pillar of fire.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to come in contact with
[1:17:28] that pillar of fire. You might not see
[1:17:30] it with your eyes, but you know when
[1:17:32] you've come into his presence, you are
[1:17:34] changed. Yes sir.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[1:17:38] things are new. And for Moses, that
[1:17:41] event, that transaction, that
[1:17:44] circumstance where he came into his
[1:17:46] presence, it become an absolute.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; That's where he got his commission here.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's where we need to point back to
[1:17:54] God. It was at that time. From that
[1:17:56] time, sir,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; that's where I got my commission.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; He anointed me from there.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; GL. I got a job to do.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; He's reconciled me.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I could point down and say that is an
[1:18:10] absolute.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I've changed.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; My We might sing that. Close the church.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; But praise God, he's made a change in us
[1:18:22] and we can point back. Now I got an
[1:18:24] absolute. I didn't do it myself.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; It wasn't like seven steps of this and
[1:18:29] seven 10 steps of that or 12 steps of
[1:18:32] this. No, I met him. He changed me
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; from that time.
[1:18:38] I'm under that influence. It's governing
[1:18:40] me. It's leading me. I got a future.
[1:18:45] Amen.
[1:18:51] You know, skip a little bit here. Now,
[1:18:55] you see, we're not a divided people.
[1:18:59] We've got to be in unity.
[1:19:02] Because each one of us is holding a part
[1:19:04] of God
[1:19:06] and we must come together and then the
[1:19:09] pillar of fire is manifested in the
[1:19:11] wholeness in its fullness of it.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And when his church sets together in
[1:19:16] heavenly places, then the fullness of
[1:19:18] the power of God is in his church. Each
[1:19:21] one of us holding spiritual gifts,
[1:19:23] spiritual offices coming together brings
[1:19:25] the pillar of fire back again. Well,
[1:19:28] that gets me excited. You know, when we
[1:19:31] all come into this unity of the faith,
[1:19:33] when we harmonize and there's nothing
[1:19:36] holding us back, the pillar of fire can
[1:19:39] come in here.
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Like, I want to see more of the works of
[1:19:44] God in your life. I I want to see
[1:19:47] deliverance. I want to see the healings.
[1:19:50] We've been waiting for the
[1:19:52] manifestation. We see it. We hear about
[1:19:54] it. I want to see more of it. And by his
[1:19:56] grace, we will.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] He says, "Now we find that Paul the rest
[1:20:04] of his life, he had a typost. He had met
[1:20:08] God face to face and was commissioned by
[1:20:11] God." That was a typost. What an
[1:20:13] absolute. And that ends all argument.
[1:20:15] That's the end of everything for Paul.
[1:20:17] All strife and everything was gone. Oh
[1:20:21] my. Do you see how important it is to
[1:20:23] have an absolute to know that God had
[1:20:25] met you and from that time? You're under
[1:20:29] his government. You're under his power.
[1:20:32] You're in his kingdom. Oh, I think
[1:20:34] that's wonderful. And it makes you do
[1:20:36] things when you've got a Christ-C
[1:20:38] centered life like Paul, you ordinarily
[1:20:41] wouldn't do. How many can testify to
[1:20:43] that? There's things that I normally
[1:20:45] wouldn't do, but because the power of
[1:20:48] that influence of having an ab absolute,
[1:20:52] I don't go to these places anymore. What
[1:20:54] did it?
[1:20:56] The absolute. The encounter. Amen. Oh
[1:21:00] my. He straightened me out.
[1:21:04] What straightening he had to do on me?
[1:21:07] Oh my. Just think about it. The pro the
[1:21:11] progression of the believer.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, when you come to that
[1:21:14] meeting place, it's not over.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; You're just getting started.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; You're just on the journey.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; You're just starting to travel on.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Now, he had a purpose in saving me. He
[1:21:28] had a purpose in saving you.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And I am determined by his will to do
[1:21:34] his will.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; My sometimes we get so confused on
[1:21:38] what's my part, God? Well, you said your
[1:21:41] word. Now, I'm going to do your will.
[1:21:43] Amen. Because he's given me the word of
[1:21:45] reconciliation. I can do this because of
[1:21:47] what's influencing me, the spirit of
[1:21:49] God. Amen.
[1:21:52] Brother Brown said in the message, "What
[1:21:53] is the Holy Ghost?" He said, "What did
[1:21:55] he come in you for?" Have you ever asked
[1:21:59] the question, "What is God coming into
[1:22:01] you for?" Young brothers, sisters, what
[1:22:04] does the Holy Ghost come in you for?
[1:22:07] save you, make you feel good, have joy
[1:22:10] and peace. Yes, he did. He gave you
[1:22:12] that. He says,
[1:22:15] "What did he come in for me? Was to
[1:22:17] continue the works of God."
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; The word of reconciliation, the works of
[1:22:24] God want to be continued through you
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; more and more. God puts a desire in your
[1:22:30] heart. You see somebody, you're like,
[1:22:31] "Ah, my heart's going out to them." What
[1:22:34] is that? the word of reconciliation.
[1:22:37] You believe because God did that for
[1:22:39] you. You God did it for me and he's
[1:22:42] putting something in my heart. Still
[1:22:44] small voice saying, "Go reach out to
[1:22:46] that person." Word of reconciliation
[1:22:48] influencing you. You know what? God's
[1:22:51] working on the other end of the line.
[1:22:53] Just stay faithful. Amen.
[1:22:56] I always do what is pleasing to my
[1:22:58] father. I come not to do my own will,
[1:23:02] but the father that sent me. Amen.
[1:23:06] That's that's the testimony and the cry
[1:23:08] of the believer.
[1:23:11] My we're going to have to skip some of
[1:23:12] this now in order to keep my word in 15
[1:23:15] minutes
[1:23:22] my
[1:23:26] you know
[1:23:29] there's a difference between a Christian
[1:23:31] and a Holy Ghost fil Christian
[1:23:34] you know there is you know some people
[1:23:37] make a claim on Christianity and by
[1:23:40] their fruits you know them, right? And
[1:23:42] there was a question asked, well,
[1:23:44] someone makes a testimony and say
[1:23:45] they're influenced by God and his
[1:23:48] kingdom and salvation and things like
[1:23:50] that, and they're like, is he is he
[1:23:51] really saved? You might have that
[1:23:53] question in your heart. Is he really
[1:23:55] saved?
[1:23:56] What do what are you saved from?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You know, your fruits actually show. And
[1:24:04] so when you see the nominal world, they
[1:24:08] raise your hand if you believe that
[1:24:10] Jesus is the Christ and everybody raised
[1:24:12] their hand. You know, you make okay,
[1:24:15] next thing is is you profess with your
[1:24:16] mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, you're
[1:24:19] saved.
[1:24:21] Well, if you go off and live like
[1:24:23] devils, what salvation is that?
[1:24:27] You know,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; it's like still lying, still cussing,
[1:24:31] still drinking, smoking, chewing, all
[1:24:33] those different things. That ain't
[1:24:34] salvation.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's religion.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I thank God there's a real
[1:24:42] Holy Ghost baptism
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; that cleanses us. We don't have to have
[1:24:47] a religious act.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; It's a life that's bubbly and like a
[1:24:51] fountain.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted to leave you with this
[1:24:56] example and
[1:24:58] try to close in five minutes.
[1:25:02] This is an example of being under the
[1:25:04] spirit that has inspired me and made me
[1:25:07] weep because I realize how far from it I
[1:25:09] am. And it's largely because I've been
[1:25:12] influenced by another kingdom. And you
[1:25:15] know, thank God that he's given us a
[1:25:18] thinking man's filter that we can renew
[1:25:20] our mind day by day. We can go to the
[1:25:22] storehouse and we can feed and God can
[1:25:24] give us spiritual food in due season
[1:25:27] that he can uncover these kind of things
[1:25:29] that are influencing our actions. But I
[1:25:31] say I want this word to bring
[1:25:34] reconciliation
[1:25:36] of the spirit of Christ so that I can
[1:25:38] live a closer walk with the Lord and
[1:25:41] that it can affect you, it can influence
[1:25:43] you and the world that I come in contact
[1:25:46] with. Amen.
[1:25:49] So, I was hanging around. Brother
[1:25:51] Brandham talks about this uh woman who
[1:25:54] has a husband that's not a believer, but
[1:25:57] they were at at the local pub, a bar,
[1:26:01] and they were hanging around there. And
[1:26:03] the first thing you know, one night came
[1:26:06] out up a question about church and about
[1:26:09] Christians. And one of the old drunks
[1:26:12] sitting there says, "There ain't no such
[1:26:13] a thing as a Christians anymore."
[1:26:17] And there is no such a thing. All a
[1:26:19] bunch of hypocrites.
[1:26:22] You know, spirits don't die, you know.
[1:26:25] So, every time they see you, no doubt
[1:26:27] the same narrative is going on.
[1:26:33] And this is out of questions and answers
[1:26:36] 1964 on August 30th.
[1:26:39] But he says, "Call themselves Christian.
[1:26:42] There's no such."
[1:26:45] One of the drunks raised up and said,
[1:26:46] "Just a minute. There's one that I know
[1:26:49] of."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You know, just thinking about the
[1:26:52] unbeliever testifying of you.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You know, you go out there, your
[1:26:57] influence is so strong that they're
[1:27:00] testifying of you.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. That's under the
[1:27:05] spirit of reconciliation
[1:27:08] that your life is so declaring to the
[1:27:11] world that even the world's testifying
[1:27:14] of the life that's dwelling in you and
[1:27:17] the fruit of reconciliation is alive and
[1:27:20] well. Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Says, "Wait a minute. There's that I
[1:27:27] know about. Who is that? It's my wife."
[1:27:32] See, she had become salty and was
[1:27:34] catching it all the time. And he was
[1:27:37] catching it all the time. Your labor of
[1:27:39] love is not in vain. You stay a
[1:27:42] Christian. You live like a Christian,
[1:27:44] talk like a Christian, walk like a
[1:27:46] Christian. Your labor of love is not in
[1:27:49] vain. God is using you as a witness and
[1:27:52] an example.
[1:27:54] Amen.
[1:27:57] says
[1:27:59] if he said, "Well, I bet if she's put to
[1:28:02] the squeeze," he said, "No, she's still
[1:28:05] a Christian. I'll prove it to you."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Said, "I'll tell you what we'll do.
[1:28:09] We'll go home and we'll and I'll show
[1:28:12] you whether she's a real Christian or
[1:28:14] not." Said, "Let's let's go let's go up
[1:28:17] home and now let's really be drunk.
[1:28:20] We're going to act like we're really
[1:28:22] drunk." Well, when I started reading
[1:28:24] this quote, I started thinking, man, can
[1:28:27] you imagine if one of your loved ones
[1:28:29] come home just was all drunk, carnal
[1:28:33] mind be like, what are you doing?
[1:28:36] Don't even come here like that. I mean,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; I I' I've been influenced this religion.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get out of here with that
[1:28:45] nonsense.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; You're all drunk and under the influence
[1:28:48] of intoxic. You too once were
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; like that. Oh my, what a sobriety we
[1:28:56] should have.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; But I bet if she was put to the squeeze,
[1:29:03] you know, you're going to be put to the
[1:29:04] squeeze. People think, well, the world
[1:29:06] there's going to be a squeeze on the
[1:29:08] economy and we're being put to the
[1:29:09] squeeze. You know, there's people
[1:29:12] watching you. You're going to be put to
[1:29:13] the squeeze. But just realize there's
[1:29:17] people watching.
[1:29:19] And God's using it.
[1:29:24] He says,
[1:29:26] "And she set the chairs all and his
[1:29:28] guest, you know, and tried to make them
[1:29:31] just as welcome as they could be." Well,
[1:29:35] huh.
[1:29:38] Thank you. Thank you, Lord, for renewing
[1:29:40] my mind because that's not my approach
[1:29:42] on this matter.
[1:29:44] I I'm sorry. I just didn't think I would
[1:29:47] be welcoming that kind of fellowship.
[1:29:49] But this woman, she had the word of
[1:29:53] reconciliation.
[1:29:55] It was in her heart.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to fix us up some supper.
[1:30:08] And so they she went to fixing some.
[1:30:13] We want ham and eggs.
[1:30:16] He didn't He knowed that they had it. So
[1:30:21] they fixed up ham and eggs. And when he
[1:30:24] got to the table, he looked at them and
[1:30:27] picked them up from the table and slam
[1:30:29] the stuff on the floor. You know, I
[1:30:31] don't like eggs like that. Come on,
[1:30:34] boys. Let's get out of here anyway. Like
[1:30:37] that.
[1:30:41] my
[1:30:45] and they went out and sat down like that
[1:30:48] and you know she come out and said dear
[1:30:51] I'm sorry I didn't fix them I'll fix you
[1:30:54] some more for you
[1:30:57] my
[1:31:00] Lord give me that spirit of
[1:31:02] reconciliation
[1:31:05] [snorts]
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; oh nonsense you know I don't want that
[1:31:08] that way the first place just carrying
[1:31:11] on like that. And they went out there
[1:31:13] and sat down and act like they were all
[1:31:15] drunk and he heard her in there kind of
[1:31:18] snubbing to herself. Sing a real low
[1:31:21] voice. Must Jesus bear the cross alone.
[1:31:26] All the world go free. There's a cross
[1:31:29] for everyone. There's a cross for me.
[1:31:32] This consecrated cross I'll bear till
[1:31:35] death shall set me free. One drunk
[1:31:38] looked at the other said,
[1:31:41] "She's a Christian.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; She's got it."
[1:31:46] Oh my. And that little that little woman
[1:31:50] led her husband plus those others to
[1:31:52] Christ that night.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; See why? See, just a real sweet. Just
[1:31:59] remember, he knows all about it.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of the word of
[1:32:05] reconciliation.
[1:32:08] Lord bless you as we invite the
[1:32:09] musicians to come.
[1:32:14] You know, I'm asking the Lord to soften
[1:32:17] my heart and as we prepare to turn the
[1:32:19] service to brother Matthew and maybe we
[1:32:22] can sing that song if you know it.
[1:32:24] Soften my heart, oh God.
[1:32:27] Is that your desire?
[1:32:30] Have the spirit of Christ lead us to
[1:32:32] reconciliation.
[1:32:34] Amen. This is this is every day is
[1:32:36] Christmas, but we're coming into the
[1:32:38] season where the world, you know, they
[1:32:40] have their mind thinking about God. I
[1:32:44] think it's a great opportunity if we
[1:32:45] have the word of reconciliation on our
[1:32:47] heart and let his spirit influence us
[1:32:50] for somebody else. Amen. Why don't we
[1:32:53] stand together?
[1:32:57] Let's have a word of prayer.
[1:33:00] If the Lord spoke to you something and
[1:33:02] it's on your heart and you just want to
[1:33:05] just ask the Lord in your heart, say,
[1:33:07] "Lord,
[1:33:09] it's my desire that your word would be
[1:33:11] fulfilled in my life." You just [music]
[1:33:13] want to make it known by the uplifting
[1:33:16] of the hand. And he sees your heart. He
[1:33:19] knows your desire. [music] Let's go to
[1:33:22] him together. Father,
[1:33:25] Lord, we thank you for your eternal
[1:33:28] word. Lord, we thank you for the life
[1:33:31] that's in the blood that speaks out and
[1:33:34] Lord, it's influencing us to better
[1:33:37] things. Lord, more grace to know,
[1:33:39] [music] God, more mercy.
[1:33:42] Lord, I pray God that Lord, as your
[1:33:45] presence draw [music] near to us, Lord
[1:33:48] Jesus, that you would, oh God, grant
[1:33:50] this touch that they're desiring by the
[1:33:53] uplifting of their hand. And Lord, I
[1:33:56] ask, oh God, that you would [music] fill
[1:33:57] us with all your goodness, Lord. We want
[1:34:00] to be about your business, Lord. And we
[1:34:03] pray, God, that Lord, in our weakness
[1:34:05] and our shortcomings, [music]
[1:34:07] Lord, we cleave to the cross. And may
[1:34:11] your grace, oh God, give us opportunity
[1:34:13] [music]
[1:34:14] to tell others, Lord, how the cross has
[1:34:18] reconciled us. And Lord, we're not what
[1:34:22] we ought [music] to be, but we're not
[1:34:24] what we used to be. And Lord, I just
[1:34:26] commit the people to you, desiring your
[1:34:29] richest blessings upon [music] them as
[1:34:32] we commit ourselves to you in Jesus
[1:34:34] Christ's name.
[1:34:36] Amen. Let's sing this together.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; soften my heart with your [music]
[1:34:49] open my eyes
[1:34:52] to see. [music]
[1:34:56] Fill me with understanding
[1:34:59] [music]
[1:35:03] soften my heart to [music] reason.
[1:35:11] [music] My heart
[1:35:14] will
[1:35:18] open my eyes
[1:35:21] to see. [music]
[1:35:25] Fill [singing] me with understanding.
[1:35:33] Soften [music and singing] my heart to
[1:35:36] be.
[1:35:42] And I want [singing] all
[1:35:45] [music] that you have
[1:35:50] for [music] me.
[1:35:56] Jesus
[1:35:59] [music]
[1:36:00] and you
[1:36:05] glory.
[1:36:06] [music]
[1:36:13] Open my arms.
[1:36:20] Open [music] my heart to receive.
[1:36:29] I want [singing and music]
[1:36:34] you.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let my heart be
[1:36:45] And don't let [music] my heart be
[1:36:53] let [music] my [singing] heart be
[1:37:01] [music]
[1:37:07] soft in [music and singing] the ground.
[1:37:15] Don't let my heart [music]
[1:37:17] be.
[1:37:22] Don't [singing] let my heart [music] be
[1:37:30] [music]
[1:37:31] with your spirit.
[1:37:37] the ground of my heart
[1:37:44] [music]
[1:37:45] and I follow
[1:37:50] that [singing]
[1:37:50] you have
[1:37:54] for me. [music]
[1:38:00] Oh Jesus,
[1:38:01] tell us all [music]
[1:38:04] that you
[1:38:09] for me [music]
[1:38:16] and [music] open my eyes to standing.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; in my heart to receive.
[1:38:31] [music]
[1:38:33] I want all
[1:38:37] that [music] you have
[1:38:41] for me.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I want all that he has for me.
[1:38:51] Amen. And I [music] appreciate that word
[1:38:53] about being influenced. Amen. I believe
[1:38:56] that's all our hearts desires. We want
[1:38:58] to be influenced by [music] the Holy
[1:38:59] Ghost. Be influenced by the word. You
[1:39:03] know, as he spoke on the ministry of
[1:39:05] reconciliation, reconciliation also
[1:39:08] means atonement.
[1:39:10] And [music]
[1:39:10] it's by the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:39:13] produces the atonement. We have we have
[1:39:16] a ministry. And the scripture says, "If
[1:39:18] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:39:20] light, [music] we have fellowship one
[1:39:22] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:39:24] Christ cleanses us from [music]
[1:39:27] all our sins." What a ministry we have,
[1:39:30] a ministry of atonement. If it wasn't
[1:39:32] for the message of the hour, where would
[1:39:34] we be?
[1:39:36] [music] We'd be in darkness. We'd be
[1:39:38] lost
[1:39:40] without a hope. But God sent a ministry
[1:39:43] [music] of reconciliation, of atonement,
[1:39:46] which is a purging. It's a cleansing.
[1:39:49] And that's [music] God's provided way.
[1:39:50] If we're going to be cleansed, if we're
[1:39:52] going to be purged, it it it means a
[1:39:54] restoration, being restored back to
[1:39:56] favor. That's what the message of the
[1:39:58] hour was. It was sent to to [music]
[1:40:00] restore us back to our rightful
[1:40:02] position. And as our brother ministered
[1:40:05] about that should have an influence. It
[1:40:07] should have an effect on our lives. And
[1:40:09] that story he told there at the end I I
[1:40:11] I uh was just thinking about that you
[1:40:14] know there there's an influence by
[1:40:16] external situation you know you can come
[1:40:19] into a situation or something like that
[1:40:22] moment where those those men came home
[1:40:25] and and they were they were creating an
[1:40:28] atmosphere and they were creating
[1:40:29] something that would maybe influence her
[1:40:31] externally into [music] into a a result
[1:40:34] or into a decision or to a reaction. But
[1:40:38] she had she had something else inside of
[1:40:40] her influencing her. She wasn't going to
[1:40:42] be influ let let that external influence
[1:40:45] change the influence that she had on the
[1:40:48] inside. And I say, Lord, that's what I
[1:40:50] want. I want I want to be influenced by
[1:40:52] the Holy Ghost. [music]
[1:40:53] You know, I and he he mentioned the
[1:40:55] scripture um resist the devil and you
[1:40:58] flee, but you got to submit yourself to
[1:41:00] God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And that's a choice.
[1:41:04] That's a choice. Uh, and I it made me
[1:41:07] think of, you know, a lot of people
[1:41:08] submit themselves [music]
[1:41:10] to the things of the world or they
[1:41:12] submit themselves and they make a choice
[1:41:14] [music] to drink alcohol or to do drugs
[1:41:17] and and I I I couldn't help [music] but
[1:41:19] think about it, but under the influence
[1:41:22] [snorts]
[1:41:22] there. There's a lot of people that are
[1:41:24] under the influence. [music] They get
[1:41:25] pulled over because why? They're driving
[1:41:28] under the influence. And [music] once
[1:41:31] you've made the decision and you've come
[1:41:33] under the influence,
[1:41:36] you're under the influence. You can try
[1:41:38] that. You can try to fake it, [music]
[1:41:41] but they got all these sobriety test and
[1:41:43] they're like, "Sorry, buddy. You're
[1:41:45] under the influence." [music]
[1:41:47] And you could try to fake it all you
[1:41:48] want. And I say, "You know what? If
[1:41:50] we're so filled with the Holy Ghost, I
[1:41:51] want to be so under the influence of the
[1:41:54] Holy Ghost that I'm not faking it. It's
[1:41:56] in the way that I walk. [music] It's in
[1:41:58] my reaction. It's in the way that I talk
[1:42:00] and people can see the the hope that
[1:42:03] lies within you. Why? Because we're
[1:42:04] under the influence. [music] It made me
[1:42:06] think about my brother David's testimony
[1:42:08] one time. He he uh he was down at the
[1:42:11] park down the street and he got to
[1:42:12] reading his Bible and the presence of
[1:42:14] God came by so so near. He he kicked off
[1:42:17] his shoes because he was in the presence
[1:42:19] of of Almighty God and he was weeping
[1:42:21] and he was there in the presence. He
[1:42:23] come under the the the influence of that
[1:42:25] pillar of fire and a cop come on by and
[1:42:27] he asked him, "Are you drunk?" And he's
[1:42:29] like, "Well, you know,
[1:42:31] this isn't that which you suppose, BUT
[1:42:34] THIS IS THAT WHICH WAS PROMISED." WHY?
[1:42:36] BECAUSE HE HAD COME UNDER the influence.
[1:42:38] I say, "Oh, God, I want to be so under
[1:42:40] the influence of the Holy Ghost, Lord,
[1:42:42] that it affects [music]
[1:42:43] my decisions and my actions." And and
[1:42:46] and not just on on Sunday and Wednesday,
[1:42:48] but Lord, every day when I wake up, may
[1:42:51] I make a decision to come under the
[1:42:53] influence of the message of the hour.
[1:42:55] come under the influence of that
[1:42:56] atonement of that blood because what did
[1:42:59] that atonement do for them children of
[1:43:01] Israel?
[1:43:02] They they applied the blood
[1:43:05] and what did it do? They got their staff
[1:43:07] in their hand. They got their shoes on
[1:43:10] their feet
[1:43:12] and it was time to go on an exodus.
[1:43:13] [music] Amen.
[1:43:15] I say that's where we're going. We're
[1:43:16] under the influence of an exodus. Amen.
[1:43:19] I I uh just so appreciate the [music]
[1:43:21] word. Why don't we just say a prayer of
[1:43:23] dismissal? Ask brother David to come and
[1:43:26] just pray a prayer of dismissal before
[1:43:28] we go. [music]
[1:43:30] Amen.
[1:43:44] Let's just go before him.
[1:43:47] Gracious father, we're so thankful for
[1:43:49] your word tonight. It's [music]
[1:43:51] truly grabbed our hearts and it's drawn
[1:43:54] us close to you. And Lord, we in you
[1:43:58] move and have our being. You're the
[1:44:00] reason we breathe. You're the reason we
[1:44:02] rise in the morning, [music] Lord. And
[1:44:04] those who may not even understand it,
[1:44:06] it's only your goodness and grace that's
[1:44:08] influencing their lives. There's not one
[1:44:11] person that sets on this earth that
[1:44:13] doesn't benefit from your love and
[1:44:15] grace, [music] Lord. And may we so
[1:44:17] declare it to others, Father. Lord, may
[1:44:20] we be the willing mouthpiece to speak of
[1:44:22] a grace that found us when we were
[1:44:25] nothing, Lord. And Lord, built us up
[1:44:27] when we were broken. And Father, that
[1:44:30] you were alive and well and ready and
[1:44:32] able and willing, Lord. And [music]
[1:44:34] Father, we thank you for our brother
[1:44:36] Andrew. We ask that you'd bless him,
[1:44:37] Lord. And Lord, just continue to reveal
[1:44:40] yourself to him. And Lord, may we be so
[1:44:43] willing to Lord to be the influence,
[1:44:46] Lord. And Lord, the power of prayer that
[1:44:48] we have to come before you and move upon
[1:44:50] your heart with the petitions that we
[1:44:52] have. Lord, may we recognize the part we
[1:44:55] play, Lord, that there's something that
[1:44:57] you put inside us to declare itself and
[1:45:00] to give a voice, to give you
[1:45:02] preeminence. And Lord, may we yield to
[1:45:05] you that you can move and have your
