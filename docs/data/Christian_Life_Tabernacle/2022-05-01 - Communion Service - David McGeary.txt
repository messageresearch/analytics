Communion Service
Br. David McGeary
May 1, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

worship me [Music] [Applause] and i'll be just one moment and i apologize for having used my phone my written notes are in another bible um by originally sorry i'm a bit nervous i'll probably cry um we wanted to give this testimony for a while but then we've been hearing such wonderful things from everyone from camp lately just um and timing happened actually this past week something else that just added to my own testimony that i felt um with the opportunity that i had to be here tonight that i would go ahead and give it um i actually wanted to start with a scripture uh it's in joshua chapter one uh it's a very familiar passage uh to many of us uh starting with verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper without wherever so out where there's life without goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee i think there's whoever thou goest and as many of you know me um for the past six years i've been in college in and out living on campus and working for the most part and i just really want to first of all think full congregation for um many of you i know personally have prayed for me and kept me in your hearts over the years and just really supported me throughout that time always wonderful to come back to home church where you know you're loved and where you're supported and where you can take the pressure off and just really be in the house of the lord with fellowship and i just want to praise the lord for he's been so faithful and kept me throughout all of that and really for for blessing me with um a significant provision all that i've really needed uh in those six years especially um as some of you know from my undergrad experience i was very blessed to receive a terry scholarship which was a full ride which doesn't just cover tuition like some full rides it covered everything it covered books it covered all my fees even it gave me the extra stipends so i didn't have to work through that undergrad experience and so that was just a huge blessing and there was an interview process for going into it and there's actually two interviews you have to do and after the first one even just through the university selection coming out of that interview there was just just a piece about it because i knew that compared to all those other students in there i knew that i had something else behind me and i just knew that i had others praying for me for for what that was and and i i almost didn't i almost kind of died at first i was like i didn't want to feel arrogant and say like oh you know what i've got this just because of of the work i'd done but i just somehow kind of felt the lord and it was just you know this is this is going to be something that he's going to reward me with and there's something that he's he's behind me in it and something else right before my graduation about three weeks before my graduation there was actually a surprise i was three weeks away from graduation and doing my degree audit my professor's office which is just a process you have to go through to kind of say you're actually ready for graduation you've completed all your hours and there was um a moment where he's checking it and somehow like i my current job at the time is actually to help other students with their scheduling but somehow i missed it as well but i had 15 hours worth of credits that i had not completed they're all election hours elective hours i should say um so i completed everything for my degree but those elective hours and i almost broke down at my professor's office but just kind of was trying to breathe and just say okay i don't have housing i don't know if i can still have my funding i don't know how this is going to work out um but that day i kind of just went home cried a bit i called my mom said hey i'm going to be here for another semester um i immediately called housing called um and let my my advisor know um through the scholarship and it was still covered i was able to find housing i was able to take that extra time um and it turned out to just be god's timing and just that time i was like you know this may not be what i was expecting i was expecting to graduate three weeks but you know there's a reason why these other months are going to happen and so i was just kind of trusting the lord in that and later that semester i was able to get an internship um with a um didn't county courthouse museum that's up there it allowed me to take that time to really get that experience which led me to go to grad school it was just god's timing in that as well and then and of course once i actually made the decision to go to grad school it's like okay where and i was looking into different programs i wanted to go to and baylor ended up being my first choice now saying okay i don't have any student debt which is awesome but i'm going to try to go to a private university for my grad school how am i going to pay for that and so again i was just kind of trusting the lord so you know you've provided me this far i know you can do it again and just a few weeks after my acceptance i was offered a two-thirds tuition scholarship and it just kind of again felt right and the lord was just providing it so many mighty ways and um and then just this semester kind of just trying to finish thing everything up trying to kind of just direct things and um kind of work through the last pressure is okay you know like then like i'm fully graduating now just the transition to like possibly moving back home where i was going to be a job search and everything like that and just trying to figure out how i could how could pay for it all because i have worked two jobs through grad school just provide for myself down in waco and i was just trying to figure out how it all work of course i want to be here for jenna's wedding and for my family this summer i wanted to be able to make sure that i could also put my my shoulder to the wheel and this past monday i randomly got an email in my account saying to check my baylor account that there was a message and and usually that means okay there's some kind of fee you have to pay for there's something extra and so i wanted to check and make sure everything's gonna be good of course because my own graduation now is about two weeks away i didn't want that to mess with anything and a friend of mine had even actually been having some issues with something that had happened to her so i was just like you know i'm gonna go and call the financial aid office and i call them because i was just looking at the amount my count saying i don't know about this i don't know what this is necessarily but they confirmed that it was real and that it was that it was there and it was and then it was um it actually was not if a fee that i was going to have to pay was actually credit in my account and tomorrow is when it'll come through and it's just a it's actually a tuition grant for about three and a half thousand dollars that just randomly that i was kind of just one of the lucky people to get and it's just a total answer to prayer because i'm gonna be able to end my semester job at the at the um universities museum and i'm being able to quit my other job and move back here without having to worry about anything so the lord has just been so good and i can and i can just and i just can't say enough um and then just briefly on a more personal level uh throughout that time in college of course there's a lot of pressure a lot of things that if anybody has been through the collegiate experience knows it's difficult and of course being on my own especially for majorly for the first time i was dealing with a lot of questions about personal identity and some social anxiety and some actually some severe depression at the time and um and even this semester especially um just kind of actually from here to the testimonies but then also some of the really great preaching that's that's been things have been said it's just been a real real blessing to me personally and um i can just really praise the lord for relieving me of that as well and i'm still just going to claim the victory and just keep walking forward in it as well and uh but just how perfectly the word kind of dovetails i had another scripture uh in second timothy uh chapter one and verse seven for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which has given us in christ jesus before the world began now it's made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel and so i just in total um he just brought me through so much his personal growth him and in the word and everything else that that um i can just only say good things and i just want to thank everyone for your love and support throughout all this time and it just again just kind of want to walk forward and just testify of that and um to keep keep looking for the wonderful things god is going to keep doing because i know that he's providing for me and had that personal experience and i also just cover prayers going forward for a job search in the future especially towards the end of the summer as i move forward and and i just want to encourage anybody else like when he's your reason to live he'll provide he'll do it all that you need your personal healing you're providing financially safety it's brought me through having covet myself right before one of my semesters and february ice storm that was in 2020 that was kind of a rough period as well but he provided and he's just been wonderful so thank you praise the lord amen his ways are past finding out amen when you think you that's the end of you you don't know what to do he will come through that's his promise to us amen amen father of life sitted on your throne of grace it's only by your mercy we are saved oh [Music] oh [Music] also [Music] [Music] jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] jesus christ [Music] we're amen this evening to be able to come into your presence we ask you to bless us this evening we pray in jesus most precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen i'd like to read that scripture that our sister testified to in joshua 1 9 that has always been i guess uh one of the scriptures that's always kept me going i just felt i'd like to read it again have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wherein ever so thou goest father thank you for your word we ask you to bless it in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated for a few moments for i'm not going to be long we're just going to go right into the communion service uh i was kind of asked a question if you wanted to know where i what i where i read from this morning it was uh in 311 1956 god using his gifts and someone asked me where that quote was that i uh mentioned and brother brown tells the story in here it's beautiful he dramatizes the story of blind bartimaeus and how that barnabas came to the city that one day to beg and he he went to his normal place that he would sit and and beg and asked for alms uh to help him because he was blind in his family and he tells the story about his good wife and his daughter and and uh i i don't know nobody can make something come so alive like brother bran o'connor i when he says i can just see him coming now i really think he was just seeing him coming now you know just a way about it but he noticed that there was nobody there that day and uh so he he's talking how the crowds weren't there as they usually were in other words the people were off somewhere and and so he he goes on him and he comes to this part and he's talking about he said he comes down he says and he begin to think settling in the warm sun he gathered up his ragged coat around him which he could not afford a new one and he was the provider for his family and he thought of his family first before himself any real true dad will do that and husband any christian will think of others before himself every christian tries to put god first his family second his number third i've tried to make that a practice in my own life isn't that the way to be and i see him sitting there it was a good time he said to kind of no stirring up and down the street everything seemed to be quiet for a long time i don't know where everyone's at today but seemingly there's no one here and he snuggles down there in the warm sunlight and he begins to kind of think things over i do i just get away sometimes and i drive my car out way out into the country and i get back in the woods and turn off turn the key off and just go out and sit down on the log somewhere and just think things over get alone i said every christian ought to do that just get some place down and think things over and then take the time to put things into perspective and and and look at all what you're frustrated about and all that you're worried about and then how heavy the load is that you have on him you know the scripture says cast your cares upon him for he cleareth to you and then and another place he says my burden is light you know my loads like my burden is easy it's not a heavy thing it's not grievous to serve god and you just take the time and and get along with them and and think it over and and and settle down and and just and just run run run your life through your own eyes and sit back and look at yourself and i i found out that when i take time to look at myself i find out that many times i'm guilty of the very things that i'm frustrated about other people you know i think about oh such and such is so impatient and then the little bit i start thinking about it i said well look at me i'm really impatient with them it's not their problem it's my problem and and just that time together alone and you know he he made a promise and you know we know the promises in the scripture and and we read the scriptures and we kind of sometimes they become mechanical to us and we take them back into history and we take them into the future but they're actually uh the word of god is actually where you're at you know what i'm saying it's it is excuse me i've graduated the big bottles one time i told them i said well i'm gonna quit preaching when i run out of water i was preaching a meeting someplace i used to do a lot of those and i came out and they had five bottles of water on the platform so i guess they were okay with what what i was preaching but but the word of god is for for where you're at because we're the people that think in beginning and end and time and future but everything in god is right now there's no way that he he he can be eternal without it being right now in fact i i love what he said the color of your eyes the color of your hair the stature that you were in he saw it then he said he may not have been a million years until it manifested but it was going to manifest because he thought it and part of the things that when i was talking this morning is that i believe that god has a plan and and uh and i'm a builder and and uh we've we had the privilege of building many things and remodeling many things and and and i've uh i've been on many jobs i've been supervisors of jobs and charge of all the electrical different things in my uh the the years that i've been working and i remember one thing that we always wanted to do is we we wanted to see the plan you know um a lot of times we'll come to the brothers will get together to work and somebody will walk up to me and they say what's the plan what's the plan well uh that's what i want to do is i want to see the blueprint and it'll okay and you know you just don't look at the blueprint somebody just doesn't hold them up and say well here's the blueprints does anybody want to see the blueprints well just come to me and i will hold up a piece of paper and they're all rolled up about this big about that big around and also here's the blueprints and you could say well i've seen the blueprints but you got to study the blueprints because in studying the blueprints you see the plan you you see the the plan of what what has been planned out all the way from all this dirt that you're seeing out there all that's planned out every every height of everything is measured off the satellite at the so many degrees of sea level 612.3 uh there's a mark out here of of our building it's like 6.3 that's 613.3 above sea level and our whole lot out here is all graded by the level of the sea and you say why because the sea is the most level thing there is now it might be tossed in turns in waves and everything but that's not cause but when everything settles down and all the winds are blown and and all the trials and all the storms and everything are gone that sea will lay flat and there's nothing flatter all level is leveled by the sea because those of us that know that have been a construction water always goes to the lowest place and then when it hits the lowest place if there's any place higher it'll level itself out it'll find till all the water in all the places everywhere is all the same level if you build up a dam you have to raise it higher than the level of the water then that water will seek the next opening the next opening the next height the next place it'll wind its way from the high places to the low places until it's all level and you know and i got to thinking about brother george in this level you know he just he wants everything balanced and that's the way it is with god all his word is level it's balanced it can be built on it can be built on that's the thing about it and and as we have this plan out here we have to have certain places higher than other places because we've got to get the higher so the water will seek that that place out there that it'll become level and it'll come off our ground but everything that is precision and and laid out and and part of this beautiful part of getting away with god and getting alone with god it allows you to make contact with the plan of god for your life and i don't mean your carnal life and i tried to make that a little bit clearer this morning of course you'd always like to do a better job than you do but but there the the when we talk about the will of god in our life and the plan of god in our life it isn't the plan for this guy it's the plan for this inside person amen when he put it in motion and he thought and and one of the greatest examples of that to me is is is both moses and paul you know paul was out doing his thing and all of a sudden the lord knocks him up and says paul it's hard to kick against the prick you know he said and he says who are you i'm lord he says i'm going to show you what things you're going to suffer for my name's sake you're going to take this gospel to the gentiles now here's somebody that had a completely something different going on i mean you talk about a 360. it's really a 180 but we always called it a 360 growing up another about face a complete reverse a complete change of directions it's because he came in contact with the plan of god for his life and the places paul did and the things that he did he could never imagine those he would have never dreamed he would have been on a ship you know and the storms would rise out he never dreamed the places that he would be the prisons the things he would suffer the power and miracles he would see the homes that he went into the church that was built at ephesus and and and all the churches corinthians and even the church in rome and all the things that were possible because he entered in to the plan of god and i believe that we're promised that a book of acts will follow this bride a book that that she will write a book of acts and and the the and we know it's not our acts it's the acts of the holy spirit it's god using and the scripture says that he departs gifts to everyone and we're talking this morning about that when god can use the gift that he placed in you not not us always using the his gift but god using the gift that he placed enough for his kingdom and the real key to that is that getting alone and that getting out on the log and sitting there and thinking it over and even beginning to wonder what are the possibilities of the things that you can do for the kingdom of god could god use you i believe he can amen i believe he can do exceedingly and abundantly above that which you or i could even ask or think i believe you could go beyond what we perceive as limitations i i i honestly believe that that we're just starting to see him and we have seen and i believe that god has been with us but i believe there's a different manifestation that that he wants because we've glorified him i believe like any husband and wife relationship i believe that he wants her to be a partake of all his glory he wants to share himself and the things that he does and that's why he said the works that i do you shall do also and and what did he do he came in contact with the plan of god and and we can always come up with the reason why we can't but i honestly say this with all my heart because it's always something that's really been burdened on my heart is is that that spirit of nicola atheism took that away from the people and it wasn't the preachers that caused nickelodeonism nickelodeon means a conquered laity it was the people giving up their plan and allowing people to form plans for their life and and i hope you can take it individual because so many people i hear it over and over again they fight depression they they fight uh the the spirit of self-esteem that they they fight such those negative things and the prophet of god said never have a negative thought he says get those negative thoughts out of your head but if if you if you'll just sit back and consider the source i i like that little saying i i i liked it when i when i saw the first time i saw it was on a little kid and it was one of those bracelets that says god don't make junk you know and i saw it on one guy that i saw and he had and i said yeah that's right i said god don't make junk but i'm not so sure that he made you you know something else has made you what you are now so if you get back to god you know what i mean that that's when things come together so i want to encourage you to realize and take it seriously that no matter how old you are now we teach our kids stuff in third and fourth and fifth grade now that is just unheard of you know what i'm saying your kids come home with math and reading assignments that and and homework that i don't know if most of the adults can do don't ask grandpa to help with your homework that's for sure you know what i mean but if if they can do that right and the world is training people they actually sit back and they look at things and they say we don't have enough doctors and then they go to schools and they do aptitude tests and they find out how many people can be doctors and then they take your score and they give it to a counselor and the counselor brings you in and says oh have you might be considered a degree in the medical field they're actually doing stuff like that you might think that you're freer than you really are but they are socially engineering this country and where do you think the social engineering's starting is starting in grade schools you know if it's starting and teaching there's differences between colors the skins there's differences between things there's all these different things there is no difference in any man we are all born sinners i never read the bible and found a yellow sin a red sin a green sin a white sin a black sin you know sin is sin i don't care where it is and god's a healer he didn't die for this group or that group or that group and so if if satan is socially engineering do you understand what i mean by social engineering they teach certain things they direct certain things they present certain things they have different types of school so that they can get society to work the way that they feel it could work well if satan is a perverter then god doesn't social engineer god spiritually engineers he's the creator of heaven and earth and he's departed in you certain gifts certain attributes certain things that are unique to you alone that he wants to use to bring to pass his will his purpose and his accomplishment and he wants us to be a part of it and so he's growing us to a place of maturity building up our faith growing in faith so we can finally come to the place in life to realize that that that god never intended us just to kind of walk in groping darkness hoping one day that we find our way but but he's actually sent to us in this day a pillar of fire the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel where he took them out of the land and led him across the desert and in and built the country and and laid down the laws and did what he had to do in in order that he could manifest to christ and then that the same lord went out and sent the spirit and the spirit went into the ground and now it's come up through justification sanctification and it's entering into maturity where it actually it's in that maturity which is the word of god the s-o-n and that seed now comes back into the full life and the full purpose for which that it was planted for now that's not the church that's the individual what makes you a church is your loved one for your other what makes you a church is not the doctrine we follow it's the love that you have one for another and the care that you have one for another and the desire in your heart to serve one another and because even the scripture teaches us that charity starts at the house of god and so if all of us we want to move up together so there's things we've got to do we've got to apply the token to our life and your young people i'm real proud of you you've you've testified you've went better to clean things up in your life to get those things out of your life you want to be delivered you want the holy ghost you want that that third person brought to life a lot of people can be anointed with the holy spirit but only the elect can have the third man resurrected okay and then that person starts to find the will of god and moves in and fulfilling a purpose you want to see god move where it's not one guy moving but he's got a many member body all carrying out oh what's that music going to be what's that symphony going to be you know what that symphony is going to be it's going to be he's the same yesterday today and forever he lives what he did he's doing today the works that he did he's now doing through his bride so let's keep pressing the mark let's do our part in praying for service uh you're maybe at church a few hours every week we come to a few services together but i certainly believe that we can take it to a much higher level but it's i can't do it you understand each of you has got to take yourself to a higher level and if you keep pursuing that i believe it'll be marvelous so let's have our communion the brothers go get the bread and the wine level let's stand together and turn for our communion reading uh this time so we don't feel it's just one account in the scriptures over to matthew the 26th chapter and i'll just read a little bit of the story here starting at the 26th the 20th verse of the 26th chapter of matthew and the 19th well that's just like the 18th first because it's such a good story and he said go into the city the 18th verse the 26th chapter of matthew and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciple and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover and when the evil was come he sat down with the twelve and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you should betray me and they were exceedingly sorrowful and begin every one of them to say unto him lord is it i and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto the man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born then jesus which betrayed him answered and said master is it i and he said unto him thou hath said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i send you i will not drink neither forth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it it knew with you in my father's kingdom amen aren't you glad you're in the kingdom of god amen let's bow our heads in prayer our gracious wonderful heavenly father lord it's our time of communion lord in our time of communion is a time of reflection just like our prophet said would like to go out and turn off the engine and just walk out and sit on the log and just think things over get alone father this is a time when we can measure ourselves against the word we can look at our lives and we can see if there's anything within us that needs repentance to make right if we have any thoughts towards a brother or sister that is not correct and not right or whether we've gossiped or whether we've had just a spirit that looks more like a cactus than a lily lord so we we take this time as a time of reflection not just a ceremony but lord is a time of communion it's a time of remembrance of the sacrifice that you pay it's a time of the blood that remitted our sins and the stripes that healed us and the bread that represents the bread of life the words of life that we can live by father is just a time that we stop and realize what's important and we realize father that if we seek first the kingdom of god all else will be added unto us so fathers we take this time of communion this time of reflection this time of self-examination this time of purposing to make things right in our life father we we take this time to come up higher to clean our house to find our coin to to sell our fields for the buried treasure we take this time father to dedicate our thoughts to you with the great desire that we could be a more profitable servant we ask you to bless this to us now in jesus name we pray heavenly father we take this bread that is broken representing a many-membered body father and we that that word has been departed to each of us in gifts and then measure and father we thank you for it we thank you for what you did at calvary oh god i would hate to be groping in the darkness of the world not knowing what my end would be but your goodness through this bread of life your word which you are meet indeed father has opened our eyes that we can see that there's soon a time of departing and a kingdom that's waiting for us we ask you to bless it to us heavenly father this wine father that we know as we've been taught is the representation of your blood and that the life is in the blood and the life spilled out on the ground father to re show us that even this world would be redeemed again and made new father and recreated back to its original place and purpose and heavenly father this blood also is life for the life is in the blood and that that life can return back upon the believer that wine also represents the stimulation of that life returning onto a believer father that they might carry out your plan in their life father may this communion heal us raise us to a higher level make us closer to you for we ask it tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated so [Music] to come as you feel [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause]

[Music] the presence [Music] is [Applause] hallelujah [Music] amen let's open our bibles too the gospel of saint john the 13th a chapter of the gospel of saints john and now before the feast of the passover this is uh the gospel of saint john the 13th chapter the first verse now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put it into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father hath given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he raised us from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girdeth himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with catal wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord dost doubt wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knoweth not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not doubt hath no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet but is clean every with and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garment and was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you you call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if ye do them amen that is a promise i can say that's thus saith the lord amen you can't say thus saith the lord unless what it is the say of the lord and he said if we would do this if we would have this attitude one towards another if we would humble ourselves and love one another even to the place that we'd wash one another's feet brother branham explained that scripture one place he said he knew brother brahms explaining the scripture what i do is not now thou knowest not but here no after he said because jesus knew it would come the time that men would no longer kneel down and i believe he said in the dirt to lead somebody to the lord and that's how humble you have to get to lead someone to the lord is to just get down right down to where their feet need washing and be their servant and if we can be like that you'll be happy you won't be happy wash one another's feet god bless you we'll be back for his worship amen if you have to go after foot washing feel free to go if you have to go now we understand so god richly bless you as we have foot washing [Music] do [Music] [Music] you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
