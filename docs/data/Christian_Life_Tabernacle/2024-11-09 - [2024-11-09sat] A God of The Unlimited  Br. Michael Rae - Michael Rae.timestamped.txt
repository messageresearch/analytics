[1:11:11] you believe that and he's here with us
[1:11:14] to touch you and to do for you what you
[1:11:18] have need of uh you know this is uh Our
[1:11:23] Guest we we called it our dedication
[1:11:26] service a a chance for us to show our
[1:11:30] Thanksgiving to the Lord for the new
[1:11:33] facility that we had we we didn't
[1:11:38] necessarily want to build a church but
[1:11:41] we were forced to you made us build it
[1:11:44] it's your
[1:11:46] fault but you know we were putting in
[1:11:49] the little Fellowship Hall we were
[1:11:51] putting about 345 people in there on
[1:11:54] Sunday and the only person in town we
[1:11:57] wouldn't invite to church was the Fire
[1:11:59] Marshall
[1:12:01] so uh but everybody's been
[1:12:04] gracious and you know it it was referred
[1:12:08] to last night and we also often refer to
[1:12:13] churches as a
[1:12:15] lighthouse a a beacon set on a hill um
[1:12:20] the the def uh the purpose of a
[1:12:23] lighthouse I I thought it was
[1:12:25] so wonderful and I just like to think
[1:12:29] because we're not really dedicating the
[1:12:31] building it's like a lot of other Church
[1:12:34] buildings and in the lighthouse is a
[1:12:36] building it's a structure that sits high
[1:12:40] but within that Lighthouse is a
[1:12:43] light and it's the flashing forth of
[1:12:47] that
[1:12:48] light that gives the lighthouse its
[1:12:52] purpose so if it didn't have the light
[1:12:55] if there wasn't a signal going from the
[1:12:59] lighthouse it would just be an oblique
[1:13:02] it would just be a tall building it
[1:13:04] would just be a structure but what makes
[1:13:07] it a
[1:13:08] lighthouse is that something is shining
[1:13:12] forth and the purpose of the lighthouse
[1:13:16] it's it is it's to Aid or to
[1:13:21] serve in navigation
[1:13:25] in other words to navigate you many
[1:13:27] times will call your
[1:13:30] Navigator because you want to know where
[1:13:33] you're going and how to get there and
[1:13:36] that's what a lighthouse is it's a
[1:13:39] navigator and it it it it it gives
[1:13:42] directions it's a warning of
[1:13:46] Hazard so this is the purpose so you sit
[1:13:49] here tonight the Lighthouse of God and
[1:13:53] you have a purpose and you you you're
[1:13:56] you're uh you're to to show the way and
[1:14:00] you're to uh warn of Hazards and you're
[1:14:05] your the lighthouse is there to uh
[1:14:08] establish
[1:14:09] position it lets you know where that
[1:14:12] you're at it establishes position and
[1:14:15] guides them to their
[1:14:19] destination amen just think that's what
[1:14:21] we're here for and the theme of our
[1:14:25] Service uh this meeting is to be about
[1:14:29] our father's
[1:14:31] business so you know so the lighthouse
[1:14:35] has a purpose and this is the business
[1:14:38] that we're to be about we have a
[1:14:41] commission to be the light and there's
[1:14:45] many scriptures that in the in the Bible
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:50] refer uh to light and uh and the the
[1:14:55] light of the believer the light of the
[1:14:57] world and in Matthew for example it says
[1:15:00] you are the light of the world a city
[1:15:04] that is set on a hill cannot be hidden
[1:15:08] you are the light of the world you are
[1:15:11] the one that shows the direction you are
[1:15:13] the one that leads the destination you
[1:15:16] are the one that keeps from ha Hazard
[1:15:19] you are the one that shows people their
[1:15:21] position who is that that's you and
[1:15:24] these are responsibilities that we can
[1:15:26] no longer Sher these are
[1:15:28] responsibilities that we must take up
[1:15:31] that we we're commissioned to be about
[1:15:33] our father's business this isn't about
[1:15:36] just living a life so you can get a
[1:15:41] reward this is about a bride that is
[1:15:43] going to take on the mind of
[1:15:47] Christ and look upon the needs of others
[1:15:50] above the the needs of themselves it it
[1:15:53] says in the Psalms it says your word is
[1:15:57] a lamp to my feet and the light of my
[1:16:03] path it it says for the Commandment is
[1:16:07] is a lamp and the law a light reproof of
[1:16:12] instructions are the way of
[1:16:15] life amen that's what the word of God
[1:16:18] does for us Jesus spoke to them again
[1:16:20] saying I am the light of the world he
[1:16:24] who followeth me shall not walk in
[1:16:28] darkness but have the light of
[1:16:33] life amen that's what we desire is the
[1:16:37] light of life and as we read last night
[1:16:40] in Mark the disciples uh went to seek
[1:16:44] him he had done many miracles in their
[1:16:46] midst and they caught their attention
[1:16:49] and so Jesus got up early and he went
[1:16:52] out to pray and to be
[1:16:56] alone and it says when and when they had
[1:16:59] found him they said unto him all men
[1:17:01] seek for
[1:17:03] thee you know when people are hungry for
[1:17:05] what you
[1:17:07] have amen all men seek for thee and he
[1:17:11] said unto them let us go unto the next
[1:17:15] towns that I may preach there also for
[1:17:20] therefore cameth I forth and that's what
[1:17:24] our commission is to go into all the
[1:17:27] world and so we want to be about our
[1:17:30] father's business and I thought last
[1:17:32] night was so
[1:17:35] wonderful because you can't be about the
[1:17:38] father's business without the
[1:17:40] father and you've got to know
[1:17:43] what his business is and we heard last
[1:17:47] night that you have a God that that
[1:17:51] knows all things he's omnipresent he's
[1:17:54] omnis
[1:17:56] there there's nothing that he can't do
[1:17:58] he he offered to supply you every need
[1:18:02] that you have need of every uh there
[1:18:06] wasn't a challenge that he couldn't make
[1:18:09] and and our brother spoke this he said
[1:18:11] the angel of the Lord has come to drive
[1:18:14] us in to the presence of God to the
[1:18:19] present tense God and and that's our
[1:18:22] heart's desire through these meetings we
[1:18:25] we didn't want to come to these meetings
[1:18:27] and say all right everybody come with
[1:18:29] your need list you know I need this I
[1:18:32] need that I need this but we wanted just
[1:18:36] to lay all of our wants and all of our
[1:18:40] desires at his feet and just take a
[1:18:44] moment to
[1:18:47] listen just listen to the word of God
[1:18:52] the word of God will bring you into a
[1:18:55] divine presence where you will
[1:18:58] absolutely know beyond a shadow of a
[1:19:01] doubt that he keeps his word and that
[1:19:05] every promise in this book is yours and
[1:19:09] so as the word as the word of God has
[1:19:11] preached to you tonight let it pull
[1:19:15] you let it lead you let it guide you let
[1:19:20] it make known to you the unlimited
[1:19:23] possibilities of a present tense God
[1:19:27] that can do for you exceedingly and
[1:19:31] abundantly above what you can ask or
[1:19:35] think and if you could walk from this

[1:27:46] building the sanctuary the church butter
[1:27:48] David is just beautiful and I know
[1:27:51] behind all the walls and the jip rock
[1:27:52] and all of that is thousands of feet of
[1:27:55] wire and all the different connections
[1:27:58] and cabling and infrastructure and I
[1:28:00] know there's love buried in these
[1:28:02] walls I mean you're walking on Love
[1:28:05] Actually you know it takes incredible
[1:28:07] amount of effort from a body to be able
[1:28:09] to do this and so we just pray that the
[1:28:12] Lord just descends and continues to use
[1:28:14] as Brother David said may this place
[1:28:16] this Sanctuary this body of Christ be a
[1:28:18] lighthouse until the Rapture takes place
[1:28:22] I mean but I but David I just had wrote
[1:28:24] and I'm trying I'm going to I'm racing
[1:28:26] here more I'm very conscious of the time
[1:28:28] but but David I did want to say you you
[1:28:31] have one of the biggest hearts that I
[1:28:33] know and I was thinking about just even
[1:28:36] your name as the Lord even considered
[1:28:38] David a man after his own heart and
[1:28:41] brother brandham he says he said
[1:28:43] somebody he was talking about his
[1:28:45] services and how he they were saying
[1:28:46] maybe you need to recall your tapes he
[1:28:48] says because I'd preached being baptized
[1:28:51] in the name of Jesus Christ he says I
[1:28:52] ain't recalling them' he says I'm making
[1:28:55] more this is brother brandham he says
[1:28:57] that's right making more that's is the
[1:28:59] Bible if they don't like what we did
[1:29:01] yesterday just watch what we're going to
[1:29:02] do tomorrow he said that's a thing to do
[1:29:05] see just keep on going there's no end of
[1:29:07] it because it is of the lord it's God he
[1:29:09] says you know what God did God looked
[1:29:11] down out of Heaven he said David you're
[1:29:12] a man after my own heart David wasn't
[1:29:15] ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he
[1:29:18] loved God and he was happy so Overjoyed
[1:29:21] till he didn't think about human
[1:29:22] Prestige I thought but David that's just
[1:29:25] like you amen we're going to just serve
[1:29:29] God we're going to serve him we're going
[1:29:30] to give our heart to him we're going to
[1:29:32] do everything we can for this gospel
[1:29:34] that's just like you butter David you're
[1:29:35] a man after God's Own Heart and so we're
[1:29:37] honored to be able to be just be here
[1:29:39] with you and support the work here in
[1:29:41] what little way we can and all the
[1:29:43] effort that was in for these meetings I

[1:29:47] snicker

[1:30:11] me amen why don't you turn to your
[1:30:13] Bibles this this evening without any
[1:30:15] further
[1:30:16] delay we're going to turn to numbers
[1:30:19] 13 I have quite a bit of scripture there
[1:30:22] to read so I'm not going to have you
[1:30:23] stand this whole time but I'll just read
[1:30:26] a little bit uh maybe the scripture I'd
[1:30:28] like to speak from and then I'll go back
[1:30:30] and go to the beginning so numbers
[1:30:40] 13 familiar scripture maybe for many as
[1:30:43] it's a scripture where the spies are
[1:30:45] going to be going into Canaan land and
[1:30:48] and Moses is speaking to the people so
[1:30:51] maybe just in a bit of a summary as we
[1:30:53] lead up to there Moses is is going to
[1:30:55] pick a man out of each tribe and he goes
[1:30:57] through each each name and actually I
[1:30:58] was going to read them but for the sake
[1:31:00] of time I will not but I was just
[1:31:02] cognizant as every person from each
[1:31:04] tribe was mentioned and named and as it
[1:31:06] went through each one I thought my how
[1:31:08] each one would have been so Keen or
[1:31:10] would have been so thrilled and honored
[1:31:11] to be called as they were passionate I'm
[1:31:13] sure to to get into the promised land
[1:31:15] they had their own desires and burdens
[1:31:17] and and such to possess what God had
[1:31:19] given them and and and scripture names
[1:31:22] him specifically
[1:31:24] but only two out only two out of that
[1:31:27] whole list actually had it in them I'll
[1:31:30] be cognizant of that as we go through
[1:31:31] the service but at verse 17 Moses said
[1:31:34] Moses sent them to spy out the land of
[1:31:36] Canaan and said unto them get you up
[1:31:38] this way Southward and go up into the
[1:31:40] mountain and see the land what it is and
[1:31:42] the people that dwelleth therein whether
[1:31:44] they be strong or weak few or many and
[1:31:49] what the land is that they dwell in
[1:31:50] whether it be good or bad and what
[1:31:52] cities that they dwell in whether in
[1:31:54] tents or in strongholds and what the
[1:31:56] land is whether it be fat or lean
[1:31:59] whether there be wood therein or not and
[1:32:01] be you of courage and bring of the fruit
[1:32:03] of the land now the T now the time was
[1:32:06] the time of the first ripe grapes I can
[1:32:09] say that Moses must have been very
[1:32:10] keenly interested in what the land held
[1:32:13] he wanted to know if there was wood if
[1:32:15] there was no wood if it was a fat land
[1:32:17] or a lean land he wanted to know what
[1:32:18] tents were there what strongholds were
[1:32:20] there he wanted to know what resources
[1:32:22] were in the land all right so they went
[1:32:24] up searched the land from the Wilderness
[1:32:26] of Zin unto reob and as the men as the
[1:32:29] men come to hamath and they ascended by
[1:32:31] the south came up to Hebron and he went
[1:32:33] I'll just go through the scripture there
[1:32:35] in 23 he says and they came to the brook
[1:32:36] of eshkol and cut down from th a branch
[1:32:39] with one cluster of grapes and they bear
[1:32:41] it between two upon a staff and they
[1:32:43] brought of the pomegranates and of the
[1:32:45] figs and the place was the brook of
[1:32:47] eshco because of the cluster grapes
[1:32:49] which the children of Israel cut down
[1:32:51] and they returned from searching the
[1:32:52] land after 40 days
[1:32:54] and they went and came unto Moses unto
[1:32:56] Aaron and all the congregation of the
[1:32:57] children of Israel under the Wilderness
[1:32:59] of pan to cadesh and brought back word
[1:33:01] unto them and unto all the congregation
[1:33:04] and showed them the fruit of the land so
[1:33:07] they'd come back Moses had wanted to
[1:33:08] know what the resources lay in the land
[1:33:10] how good it was or how bad it was and
[1:33:12] now they've come back with proof and a
[1:33:14] little bit of evidence of grapes and
[1:33:15] pomegranates and figs and now they're
[1:33:17] going to show them and they told him and
[1:33:20] said we came under the land this is all
[1:33:22] 12 of them obviously that are gathered
[1:33:23] here with thou sent us and surely it
[1:33:26] floweth with milk and honey and this is
[1:33:29] the fruit of it so they agreed with
[1:33:32] wholeheartedness surely it floweth with
[1:33:34] milk and honey it was abundant it was
[1:33:36] full of resource it was it was full of
[1:33:38] goodness it was a fat land it it had so
[1:33:40] much goodness in it and here is the
[1:33:42] fruit or I should say a a taste or a
[1:33:45] foretaste of
[1:33:47] it
[1:33:50] nevertheless immediately after they now
[1:33:53] just mentioned what the land contained
[1:33:56] and I'm sure there was more that could
[1:33:57] have been said as they were glowing with
[1:34:00] with with what was there but somehow the
[1:34:02] immediate verse or immediately following
[1:34:04] that they said nevertheless here they
[1:34:06] put an immediate
[1:34:11] limit nevertheless the people be strong
[1:34:14] that dwell on the land and the cities
[1:34:16] are walled and very great and more over
[1:34:18] we saw the children of anak there Giants
[1:34:20] and the amalekites dwell in the land of
[1:34:21] the South and the Hittites and the
[1:34:22] jebusites the the amorites dwell on the
[1:34:24] mountains and the Canaanites dwell by
[1:34:26] the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and
[1:34:29] Caleb stilled the people before Moses
[1:34:31] and said let us go up at once and
[1:34:34] possess it for we are well able to
[1:34:40] overcome amen you may have your seats
[1:34:42] tonight may the Lord bless the reading
[1:34:44] of his word
[1:34:47] tonight you know humanity is
[1:34:49] transfixed maybe even
[1:34:52] driven with with all of its desires and
[1:34:54] such is focused quite heavily on
[1:34:56] resource or I should say resources you
[1:34:59] know Wars are are fought and uh and such
[1:35:03] you know Spain went to America and and
[1:35:05] found gold they were looking for
[1:35:07] resource you know England and France
[1:35:09] Rome all the con many of the conquests
[1:35:11] that that have happened over time most
[1:35:12] often there's some sort of commodity to
[1:35:14] plunder some some sort of uh desire they
[1:35:18] have maybe they're Limited at home and
[1:35:20] so they're going to to obtain something
[1:35:21] that they don't have Greece one of their
[1:35:24] big battles that Greece fought was
[1:35:26] because they were limited in their own
[1:35:27] natural resource and so resources of a
[1:35:30] land are are vital to any country many
[1:35:33] of the African nations they were
[1:35:35] colonized just because of their
[1:35:36] resources and man went in to try and
[1:35:38] Conquer and take of the minerals and and
[1:35:40] and take from the land and so it's
[1:35:42] mankind who has searched through all
[1:35:44] time it's got Wars its conquests that
[1:35:46] have been waged for
[1:35:49] resource thousands and hundreds of
[1:35:51] millions of dollars have been mobilized
[1:35:53] to take take over lands to take over
[1:35:55] countries because they have something
[1:35:57] that they don't so without the proper
[1:36:00] amounts certain resources your economy
[1:36:03] suffers growth suffers you become
[1:36:05] vulnerable you can't build as such that
[1:36:07] you need other kingdoms can come in they
[1:36:10] can develop more they take over and
[1:36:12] anybody on a side note maybe some of the
[1:36:14] younger well not so younger maybe
[1:36:16] there's an old strategy uh computer game
[1:36:19] of the old times called Age of Empires
[1:36:21] anybody ever know that oh my am I that
[1:36:25] old oh you had to go get gold and stone
[1:36:28] and food and wheat and all this kind of
[1:36:29] thing you had to build your Empire up
[1:36:31] you needed resource if you didn't do it
[1:36:33] you wouldn't build it was impossible and
[1:36:36] so the American Revolution even the
[1:36:38] fight for Freedom the independent the
[1:36:40] war of independence looked like for you
[1:36:43] it was the fight for freedom but
[1:36:44] actually from Europe they viewed the war
[1:36:46] as a very different story Europeans saw
[1:36:49] the conflict as a battle over control of
[1:36:50] lucrative trade routes and commodities
[1:36:52] of the East and West Indian
[1:36:54] they didn't even see your Independence
[1:36:55] they didn't really actually care all it
[1:36:57] was was about Commodities and resource a
[1:36:59] different Viewpoint of that England
[1:37:00] wanted to retain its control of the
[1:37:01] colonies to reap the benefits of the
[1:37:04] natural resources here of America and so
[1:37:07] man is concerned with resources because
[1:37:10] they're limited this Earth is limited in
[1:37:13] its
[1:37:14] resource and resource limits man gets so
[1:37:16] concerned in it so therefore it's
[1:37:18] desirable for Renewables who's familiar
[1:37:21] with that everybody should be
[1:37:24] everybody wants a renewable resource
[1:37:25] because it's never ending and therefore
[1:37:27] it doesn't deplete and it can keep going
[1:37:29] and because it sees man sees a possible
[1:37:31] limit and so it's trying to figure out
[1:37:33] how how can I find something that is is
[1:37:36] Unlimited in his resource Amen Brother
[1:37:39] David pretty much quote almost could
[1:37:41] have quoted my title a God he quoted I
[1:37:43] think God of unlimited possibilities I
[1:37:45] was going to title it tonight maybe
[1:37:47] tapped into unseen resources but pick
[1:37:49] your pick your title whichever one you
[1:37:51] want but tonight we're going to speak
[1:37:52] about a god of the limited amen am me
[1:37:55] our brother Tom was tap dancing all over
[1:37:58] a little bit last night that's okay so
[1:37:59] we'll just swing a different little
[1:38:00] Direction so we'll just go part two of
[1:38:02] Last Night how's that and he'll take
[1:38:04] part three tomorrow so man's ever
[1:38:06] hunting ever hunting for more potential
[1:38:09] and looking for untapped areas that he
[1:38:10] can find something to ensure he does not
[1:38:13] run out in fact they're so Keen that
[1:38:16] they that on on on a resource they make
[1:38:19] create movies they create books they
[1:38:21] there there's super abilities that man
[1:38:23] craves for that that can manifest a an
[1:38:26] unending or a supernatural power that
[1:38:29] will never ever
[1:38:31] end you know they want some
[1:38:33] superhero you
[1:38:36] know limited is restricted in
[1:38:40] size of amount or extent it's few small
[1:38:43] or
[1:38:44] short I'm an adjective I should say a
[1:38:47] synonym kind of guy so relative or
[1:38:50] similar words I'm going to read them
[1:38:52] fast catch a few of them limited means
[1:38:54] restricted or finite B bounded little
[1:38:57] narrow in short supply meager it's
[1:38:58] scanty it's sparse it's insubstantial
[1:39:01] deficient inadequate insufficient
[1:39:03] poultry poor misery basic rudimentary
[1:39:06] patchy sketchy minimal cramped and
[1:39:08] small just in case you needed a couple
[1:39:12] it's limited I can tell you the world is
[1:39:14] limited in its abilities its resources
[1:39:17] and it's its ability to fulfill what
[1:39:19] mankind requires and we're creatures of
[1:39:22] limitations we have limited
[1:39:25] time that's we're we're constrained by
[1:39:27] limitations I can tell you we know that
[1:39:30] because you have limited time and you
[1:39:31] have limited
[1:39:32] money so we're very well of the
[1:39:35] limitations on our planet and everything
[1:39:37] it constrains us because if you know I'm
[1:39:39] sure a few of us would love un unlimited
[1:39:41] time and unlimited money yeah indeed I
[1:39:43] got one over
[1:39:46] here but our human mentality we we tend
[1:39:49] then to measure everything because
[1:39:51] that's just the way're we're we're we
[1:39:53] live live in a world of limitations and
[1:39:54] we have scales and units of measurement
[1:39:56] and and and so we got you know from
[1:39:58] micro to macro and small medium and
[1:40:00] large and we have all these different
[1:40:01] scales of graduating sizes and such
[1:40:04] because that's just how we work man's
[1:40:06] mind is is based on limitations and and
[1:40:08] limits and so we we put these things
[1:40:10] because you know we care about
[1:40:13] measurement you bet you care because if
[1:40:15] someone said you know what I'll give you
[1:40:17] hundreds or billions of dollars which
[1:40:19] one would you want well you care about
[1:40:22] measurement right there
[1:40:23] like well can I go with billions yeah
[1:40:26] because it's a unit of me unit of
[1:40:28] measurement that you care about amen and
[1:40:30] so God
[1:40:31] though is not a
[1:40:34] man God ain't no restricted to any
[1:40:38] measurements man un like us we tend to
[1:40:40] look at God though because of our our
[1:40:42] world because of measurements because we
[1:40:44] weigh in you know pounds and tons and
[1:40:46] all these kind of thing we then tend to
[1:40:48] look at God Through The Eyes of our
[1:40:50] limited Humanity all right and so we
[1:40:53] then do tend to put a measurement on him
[1:40:55] or restrict him by our own me our own
[1:40:58] barriers of our mind but God is a god of
[1:41:00] No Limits and I know that's hard for us
[1:41:03] to comprehend because we we we live in
[1:41:05] the realm of limits but unlimited is
[1:41:07] what our God is he means he's not
[1:41:09] restricted in terms of numbers or
[1:41:11] quantity or extent it's having the
[1:41:14] greatest possible amount or number and
[1:41:16] in fact unlimited is inexhaustible it's
[1:41:19] Limitless it's boundless it's unbounded
[1:41:21] it's immense it's vast it's great it's
[1:41:23] extensive it's immeasurable incalculable
[1:41:26] Untold unfailing Everlasting infinite
[1:41:28] endless never ending I'm talking about
[1:41:30] your God whose bottomless measureless
[1:41:32] inestimable Cosmic unrestricted
[1:41:34] unconstrained uncontrolled unrestrained
[1:41:37] unchecked unhindered unhampered
[1:41:38] unimpeded unfettered unbridled uncurved
[1:41:41] unconditional absolute full utter
[1:41:44] Sovereign Supreme and
[1:41:46] omnipotent that's your
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:41:51] God I can tell you when whoever put that
[1:41:54] in Webster they were writing it just for
[1:41:56] this service so that I could Proclaim to
[1:41:58] the devil my God is a god of the
[1:42:01] unlimited my God is a goddess of supreme
[1:42:03] the unrestricted the unconstrained and
[1:42:06] no man controls your
[1:42:10] God there is actually no unit of
[1:42:13] measurement even in the concepts of man
[1:42:17] that belong to God
[1:42:23] you know that's actually hard for you
[1:42:24] and I to maybe understand because we
[1:42:26] have big needs and small needs it
[1:42:28] doesn't exist to
[1:42:31] God God's like it's a
[1:42:34] need you have a prayer you have a
[1:42:36] concern you have a have a circumstance
[1:42:39] there there's no way to God doesn't look
[1:42:40] at little he doesn't look at big he
[1:42:42] doesn't look at your a to a toothache
[1:42:44] and a Cancer and be like well that's
[1:42:45] huge to me I don't know if I can handle
[1:42:47] that I mean the toothaches no problem
[1:42:49] but the cancer I don't know how I can do
[1:42:51] it no God is unlimited meaning he
[1:42:53] doesn't have a unit of measurement for
[1:42:55] your need it means he looks at your need
[1:42:58] whether it's a toothache or a cancer he
[1:43:00] says well all things are
[1:43:05] possible because Jesus said looking upon
[1:43:08] them saying with men it is impossible
[1:43:10] but with God for With
[1:43:13] God all things it didn't say 99% of
[1:43:18] things it didn't say just a limited
[1:43:20] amount of things it's a limited addition
[1:43:22] of what I can do I can only do so much
[1:43:24] no he can do all
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:30] things brother bam said now when the
[1:43:32] Brethren receive the sign receive the
[1:43:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this
[1:43:37] is the summit this is all of it but
[1:43:39] Brethren he said that's wrong there is
[1:43:42] no Summit to God's
[1:43:44] power don't put God in your mental box
[1:43:47] don't put some scale of measurement on
[1:43:49] my God my God's unlimited if you want to
[1:43:52] live with a limited God you go right
[1:43:53] ahead but not my
[1:43:56] God he said we move on and on and on
[1:43:59] it's the unlimited resources of God has
[1:44:02] never been tapped
[1:44:08] yet it's never been tapped yet through
[1:44:11] the thousands of years of believer after
[1:44:13] believer as they've moved on and on in
[1:44:15] their experience and they've gone into
[1:44:17] Heavenly places his love his Joy his
[1:44:20] peace his outpouring has never been
[1:44:23] tapped
[1:44:26] yet he said God has never tapped yet
[1:44:28] blessings and powers that we know
[1:44:30] nothing about he said well Lord I need a
[1:44:34] little bit more do you have a little bit
[1:44:35] more for me he said I'm sorry what is
[1:44:37] that I'm unlimited what do you desire
[1:44:40] tonight what is your need tonight he's
[1:44:42] the god that can feel your need yeah you
[1:44:44] can sink into the stars for all I care
[1:44:47] my God will fulfill
[1:44:49] it he says it's never been ever even
[1:44:52] revealed to our Arch Angels is laying
[1:44:54] just ahead for his church that will
[1:44:56] believe for Eye Has Not Seen Nor Ear Has
[1:44:58] Not Heard neither has it entered into
[1:45:00] the hearts of man what God has for them
[1:45:03] in
[1:45:09] store he's an unlimited
[1:45:11] God
[1:45:13] Amen so here is Israel sitting at Kadesh
[1:45:18] at a critical Junction point and God had
[1:45:21] finally led him to a place where they
[1:45:22] were getting to the peak really of what
[1:45:24] lay
[1:45:25] ahead here was 12 men sent which had
[1:45:28] good intentions desires to go into the
[1:45:30] land glory to God we're going in the
[1:45:33] promised land can you think of that
[1:45:35] moment do you want to be a
[1:45:38] spy would you like to go on the promised
[1:45:40] landine would you like to go as Moses
[1:45:42] started to choose each one like my glory
[1:45:45] to God I get to be the first one to
[1:45:48] taste of the fruits think of that moment
[1:45:52] there you there was important even named
[1:45:53] them off of the tribe of Simeon it was
[1:45:55] shaad of the tribe of Judah it was
[1:46:01] Caleb trouble lay ahead the unknown lay
[1:46:04] ahead burdens lay ahead uncertainties
[1:46:06] lay ahead change was ahead much lay
[1:46:09] ahead all of that was part of obtaining
[1:46:11] their promise part of accessing the
[1:46:15] resources there was resources of
[1:46:19] abundance but there was a little bit of
[1:46:21] work to do they had to start to get in
[1:46:23] they had to get in the promised land
[1:46:25] they had to cross over they had to spy
[1:46:26] it out they was they were just they were
[1:46:28] scratching at the surface of what worked
[1:46:30] needed to be done to even get there but
[1:46:32] it was
[1:46:34] there and they told him and said we came
[1:46:36] into the land that th sent us and surely
[1:46:39] surely it floweth with milk and honey I
[1:46:42] mean I can imagine the conversations as
[1:46:43] they were going in their little groups
[1:46:45] and going into different areas of the
[1:46:46] land and some were looking at the Giants
[1:46:48] but I can imagine the conversation that
[1:46:50] Joshua and Caleb had at all times was
[1:46:53] only and always about what the land had
[1:46:56] look at this this is more than what even
[1:46:58] Moses said he said it was flowing with
[1:47:00] milk and honey but it's abundant this is
[1:47:02] Limitless I mean look at this land it's
[1:47:04] fertile look at the trees look at the
[1:47:06] wood look at this oh sorry that's a a
[1:47:08] cat wow that doesn't matter that cat
[1:47:09] Fortress will go down oh my there's
[1:47:11] Giants whatever we can do those but look
[1:47:12] at the milk and
[1:47:16] honey oh but someone else is saying well
[1:47:18] look at the figs oh my goodness it's
[1:47:20] sons of anic that are here I know but
[1:47:22] did look at the fig trees and no no did
[1:47:24] you see that City no I'm try trying to
[1:47:26] look at the resources that God has for
[1:47:28] us I can't get my eyes off of what Satan
[1:47:30] thror in front of
[1:47:35] me 10 out of those 12 came back with the
[1:47:40] testimony of
[1:47:44] nevertheless I'd never want my testimony
[1:47:47] to be
[1:47:50] nevertheless in this context
[1:47:53] the people are
[1:47:55] strong Giants are in the
[1:47:58] land and there then Caleb Still the
[1:48:02] people and they rebutted back and
[1:48:05] confessed openly and
[1:48:08] unabashedly that there's just no way for
[1:48:10] us to do this there's no way for us to
[1:48:14] obtain the resources that God has for
[1:48:19] us numbers
[1:48:20] 13:31 and it says but the man went up
[1:48:23] with him and said we be not able to go
[1:48:26] up against the people for they are
[1:48:29] stronger than
[1:48:31] we i i i i h I actually just struggle
[1:48:36] with comprehending after all that they
[1:48:38] had gone through after all the
[1:48:40] circumstances that they had went through
[1:48:42] mana and quail they' gone through Egypt
[1:48:44] and all the plagues that had come across
[1:48:46] and God had brought them out with a
[1:48:47] strong hand they went through the sea
[1:48:49] Red Sea that parted and here they had
[1:48:51] the audacity to throw it in God's face
[1:48:54] and say we are not able wait a second
[1:48:58] what we has anything to do with it
[1:49:00] anyway did you open the Red Sea did you
[1:49:02] bring Mana down from heaven did you
[1:49:04] bring Quail did you bring the the plague
[1:49:06] of death and boils and and Li and frog
[1:49:09] did you do that well no I didn't so what
[1:49:12] part of we are you having to do with
[1:49:13] anything about the promised
[1:49:16] land they got they got questioned up and
[1:49:19] they got muddled up in their brain and
[1:49:21] somehow felt that they had something to
[1:49:23] do with it you got nothing to do with it
[1:49:26] all you got to do is walk in it and
[1:49:28] believe that your God is more than able
[1:49:32] that's why Caleb could have nothing to
[1:49:34] do with Caleb he said we're able to
[1:49:36] because my
[1:49:42] God it missed the point completely
[1:49:46] wasn't to do with them any at all and
[1:49:49] they'd been looking at the flesh
[1:49:53] and disregarded the
[1:49:54] resource within their own Camp the
[1:49:58] pillar of fire had been with them all
[1:50:01] this time can you imagine a pillar of
[1:50:05] Fire by day and a pillar of cloud by
[1:50:09] night and then they come back and be
[1:50:11] like no it's impossible and the pillar
[1:50:13] of fire is in their
[1:50:17] midst and then they decide to choose a
[1:50:22] captain
[1:50:24] I I I know I know you you just glaze
[1:50:25] over the scripture but can you imag
[1:50:28] imagine Moses who's LED them who left as
[1:50:32] he looked out of the window and and
[1:50:34] disregarded all of Egypt's pleasures and
[1:50:36] money and fame and glory and looked at
[1:50:38] the Mudders and said I'd rather be there
[1:50:41] and bear the reproach and stepped out of
[1:50:43] it took the reproach walked down with
[1:50:46] the children of Israel right out of
[1:50:47] Egypt and they're like you know what
[1:50:49] we're just going to get a new captain
[1:50:53] that's what they
[1:50:55] say let's make us a captain and let us
[1:50:59] return unto
[1:51:05] Egypt it's better to be back in bondage
[1:51:09] and oppression of a man-made
[1:51:13] system critical
[1:51:17] error because they put a limit on God
[1:51:20] and His abilities
[1:51:24] I wonder
[1:51:26] unfortunately that's not just happening
[1:51:28] back in the children of Israel's
[1:51:30] day that's not just way back in numbers
[1:51:34] but I don't know about you but where I
[1:51:36] come from that's still
[1:51:38] happening they've sojourned they've gone
[1:51:41] a long way they've seen God move God's
[1:51:43] done incredible miracles in their midst
[1:51:46] and they've walked in it and they come
[1:51:47] to the point Suddenly It's like wow I
[1:51:49] just can't do this anymore and turn my
[1:51:52] face and they turn their backs on this
[1:51:54] God that's moved and delivered and and
[1:51:56] and helped them through certain
[1:51:58] difficulties and such as say nah we
[1:51:59] don't want him anymore and they go back
[1:52:01] to their
[1:52:02] wallow still happens
[1:52:06] today but I'm glad the story don't just
[1:52:08] end
[1:52:10] there cuz I don't identify with the 10 I
[1:52:14] identify with the two all right because
[1:52:17] identify with the two that were able to
[1:52:19] see that their God was more than able
[1:52:22] and their eyes were on the
[1:52:24] unlimited possibilities of what lay
[1:52:27] across the river am man that's where
[1:52:30] identify they wanted they' seen their
[1:52:32] God move and they wanted what the land
[1:52:34] had that's my type and my hero is Caleb
[1:52:38] they wanted what that land had and they
[1:52:40] said I don't know what it's going to
[1:52:41] take but my God's able and I'm just
[1:52:43] going to put my eyes on it and walk day
[1:52:45] by day I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:52:47] through tomorrow I don't know how I'm
[1:52:48] going to get through this situation I
[1:52:50] don't know how I'm going to get through
[1:52:51] cancer I don't know how but my God has
[1:52:54] got my healing just over in that
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:04] land because in Romans it says for whom
[1:53:06] he did for no he also did predestinate
[1:53:09] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:53:11] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:53:13] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:53:15] predestinate them he also called and
[1:53:18] whom he called them he justified is
[1:53:20] anybody identifying with this scripture
[1:53:23] anybody here cuz I'm pretty sure this is
[1:53:25] the scripture that Caleb would
[1:53:26] identified with amen who he justified he
[1:53:29] called D he justified he justified them
[1:53:31] he also glorified what shall we say to
[1:53:34] these things if God before us who can be
[1:53:38] against us amen that's a Caleb
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:48] people in this day in this AG
[1:53:55] I can't really want to don't really want
[1:53:56] to jump my jump my notes but there's a
[1:54:00] land Without Limits and I'm saying
[1:54:03] Dallas it's time to
[1:54:07] conquer Israel sat there they sat they
[1:54:09] looked across at the joy that was set
[1:54:11] before him and limited God's ability I
[1:54:13] can't even imagine of thinking and
[1:54:15] looking at that actually even tasting
[1:54:17] not just grapes but they had figs and
[1:54:19] pomegranates and they could they even
[1:54:21] tasted
[1:54:23] but there's a barrier
[1:54:25] there you know it's terrible when you
[1:54:27] see somebody they've
[1:54:32] tasted and you're like you know you know
[1:54:35] what's terrible when someone's achieving
[1:54:36] lower than their abilities anybody ever
[1:54:38] had experienced that and somebody's
[1:54:40] they've got so much so much uh potential
[1:54:43] and you see it in them but they're not
[1:54:46] they're not pressing towards it or
[1:54:47] they're not trying to develop it and
[1:54:48] you're just like come on it's just it's
[1:54:51] just there if just put a little effort
[1:54:53] in it put a little diligence in you you
[1:54:55] can do more and it don't want just burns
[1:54:58] you you're like I wish I had those
[1:54:59] abilities myself cuz I
[1:55:01] would No No's ever thought that
[1:55:10] before know there was in Second Kings
[1:55:13] there were there was a city under
[1:55:16] siege and there were some lepers that
[1:55:18] sat out on
[1:55:20] the out of the uh City
[1:55:23] City they had nowhere to go and inside
[1:55:26] the city there had been sieged and
[1:55:28] people there was no food as famine they
[1:55:29] were even eating their own children
[1:55:31] terrible situation as they had been
[1:55:33] encompassed I Believe by the syrians I
[1:55:35] think it was resources were gone limited
[1:55:40] isn't even in the in this in the picture
[1:55:41] in the scope it's bare gone nothing
[1:55:44] non-existent and here they were sitting
[1:55:46] in there these little Le these lepers
[1:55:48] and they're sitting there and the
[1:55:49] scripture says why sit here we die so
[1:55:53] they're having a conversation and little
[1:55:55] did they know and I'm just trying to
[1:55:57] work through with some time here little
[1:55:59] did they know that inside a prophet had
[1:56:02] prophesied of something that was going
[1:56:04] to transpire he said that barley and
[1:56:06] such would go at a certain price and
[1:56:08] there was a doubter in their midst and
[1:56:09] he said that's not impossible that'll
[1:56:11] never happen because he's looking at the
[1:56:13] circumstance not at the word that was
[1:56:15] being issued by a prophet he said oh and
[1:56:18] so he doubted but little did they know
[1:56:20] that had transpired and they're sitting
[1:56:21] there outside the gate and they're
[1:56:23] saying what should we do if we go inside
[1:56:25] we're going to die and and there's
[1:56:27] nothing there but if we go to the
[1:56:28] syrians camp we're going to die but
[1:56:30] maybe per Adventure they are going to
[1:56:32] just maybe have compassion on us maybe
[1:56:35] they'll give us a morsel and maybe throw
[1:56:37] us something because we're lepers and
[1:56:39] they don't want to touch us so hey why
[1:56:40] don't we go down there what if we just
[1:56:42] sit here and do nothing we
[1:56:45] die all right and behind them was a
[1:56:48] prophecy a word spoken and so here they
[1:56:51] go well all right let's get up from our
[1:56:54] chair let's go and do something we never
[1:56:56] done before let's go and just take a
[1:56:58] step of faith and go in a direction that
[1:57:00] I've never thought of I'm just going to
[1:57:02] because if I sit here I
[1:57:04] die all right so here we go all they go
[1:57:08] they back up their who knows what their
[1:57:10] little bed roll or something like that
[1:57:13] walking towards a Syrian Camp unaware of
[1:57:15] what it transpired but here God had
[1:57:18] moved on the scene the god of the
[1:57:21] unlimited and he had moved and put it
[1:57:23] and and made it so that they thought
[1:57:25] there was an Army coming someone had
[1:57:26] hired an army and off the syrians went
[1:57:29] and unbeknownst to them they were
[1:57:32] walking into
[1:57:37] abundance how do you know that you don't
[1:57:39] need to get up from your chair today you
[1:57:41] need to step out in faith because God's
[1:57:44] got some abundance for
[1:57:47] you he's not just a god of Second Kings
[1:57:50] he's a god of today because of his
[1:57:52] Second Kings in Hebrews 138 that means
[1:57:54] it's in your hand to step out and say
[1:57:57] well Lord maybe I'm like a leper maybe
[1:57:59] I've been sitting in sin all day long
[1:58:01] and I'm just sick and
[1:58:03] tired get
[1:58:06] up get
[1:58:08] up let you die but God my God has some
[1:58:14] resources for

[1:58:42] mock
[1:58:44] me what excuse was worth it what
[1:58:47] excuse would have been worth them
[1:58:50] staying here
[1:58:53] and unbeknownst to them riches
[1:58:58] Untold no
[1:59:01] excuse was
[1:59:03] worthwhile I tell you no excuse is
[1:59:06] worthwhile when the god of the present
[1:59:09] that is unlimited is in our midst today
[1:59:14] no excuse for you to sit in your place
[1:59:16] where you're stagnating in your
[1:59:18] spiritual walk or you have a need no
[1:59:21] excuse is worth sitting there Reach Out
[1:59:24] And Touch the
[1:59:25] [Applause]
[1:59:32] Lord w why should I sit here in the muck
[1:59:35] of sin lost and wretched as a leper why
[1:59:38] sit here in the med mediocre life of a
[1:59:40] message child with no experience of your
[1:59:43] own hanging on your coattails of your
[1:59:45] mommy and daddy why sit here Bound by
[1:59:47] some doctrine of man some Twisted idea
[1:59:49] of the message that they got holding you
[1:59:51] back why sit here bounded by some malice
[1:59:55] or hurt that's in your heart past some
[1:59:57] past circumstance why sit
[2:00:00] here when the god that has what you need
[2:00:04] is
[2:00:10] here and they were sold out they were
[2:00:13] willing to
[2:00:16] die they actually got up with the
[2:00:20] expectation that I might
[2:00:24] die and that's exactly what it
[2:00:27] takes to get up with the full
[2:00:31] expectation I'm dead to
[2:00:35] myself and when they came to that
[2:00:38] place then they stepped into another
[2:00:42] realm they stepped and started tapping
[2:00:45] into the Unseen real of the resources of
[2:00:48] God
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:00:54] I can tell
[2:00:55] you when they got there oh my
[2:01:01] goodness going from
[2:01:04] Death To
[2:01:08] Life come on they thought they were
[2:01:11] going to die and they start to look in
[2:01:13] here wait a second you mean there's no
[2:01:15] syrians around here you mean there's
[2:01:17] gold and there's garments and there's
[2:01:18] food and they start stuffing their face
[2:01:21] because it's Joy unspeakable and full of
[2:01:23] Glory it's peace that passes all
[2:01:25] understanding they start drinking it in
[2:01:28] and taking and say oh my goodness they
[2:01:29] take some and they went and hit it they
[2:01:31] hid it behind here they came back
[2:01:34] they're like this is
[2:01:36] amazing and then they said wait a second
[2:01:40] we can't do this we need a
[2:01:44] share we can't just sit here and enjoy I
[2:01:48] need to share it I need to get out there
[2:01:51] I need to tell this world that God sent
[2:01:53] a prophet and he's restored me to my
[2:01:57] [Applause]
[2:02:03] position
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:07] amen think of that moment they're like
[2:02:10] you mean this is all for
[2:02:12] me this is all me every bit of this is
[2:02:16] for me every promise in the book is mine
[2:02:21] every chapter every verse every line I
[2:02:25] am trusting in my love my God Divine
[2:02:28] it's mine yes it is I don't have to
[2:02:31] share with
[2:02:33] nobody you do but it's still all
[2:02:36] yours I'll just go to your prophet and
[2:02:38] say that's a
[2:02:47] paradox but Brown says choose you this
[2:02:49] day you who you'll serve
[2:02:54] said the words been preached signs has
[2:02:57] been done the Holy Ghost is here the
[2:02:59] hour has come for a decision made
[2:03:00] amongst the people he said what more can
[2:03:03] God do send it down with signs and
[2:03:04] wonders discernments proved it
[2:03:05] scientifically put it on a picture sent
[2:03:07] it across the world thousands times
[2:03:09] thousands
[2:03:10] witnessing he said they arose in the
[2:03:12] middle of the night started down towards
[2:03:14] walking by faith towards the host of the
[2:03:16] syrians and God honored their faith
[2:03:25] he said it didn't only save their own
[2:03:27] life he says but it saved the whole
[2:03:33] city he says there's a lot of sick
[2:03:35] people with heart trouble to berler lot
[2:03:38] was bound in chairs he says why don't
[2:03:41] you tonight why do you sit there till
[2:03:44] you die the hour has come for you to
[2:03:49] make a decision now
[2:03:54] he said God can't do no more about it
[2:03:56] it's up to
[2:03:57] you you got to make the
[2:04:01] decision I pray you'd sit in your Pew

[2:04:05] and you start just rolling that one in
[2:04:06] your heart why sit here till we die why
[2:04:10] sit here till I die in this state I'm in
[2:04:13] I'm dead why I tell you the devil's
[2:04:16] going to give a thousand different
[2:04:18] excuses he's going to pour it on you but
[2:04:20] I'll tell you you just need to get up
[2:04:23] because life abundant is just down that
[2:04:36] way you know what that happened to the
[2:04:40] doter he doed it he doed God's word he
[2:04:44] doed The Prophet's message and he got to
[2:04:47] the door the gate and he must have seen
[2:04:50] the people at a fra of time pouring out
[2:04:53] heading out into the riches of what God
[2:04:55] had gave them and then he got trampled
[2:04:58] and
[2:05:00] died they don't pay it doubt just
[2:05:05] believe just
[2:05:07] believe and Satan has tried to Siege
[2:05:10] this bride he's tried to hold her bound
[2:05:12] God has loosed though a word that has
[2:05:15] broken down the Walls there's no more
[2:05:17] Siege on the name of Jesus Christ amen
[2:05:19] it's not bound up by some trinitarian
[2:05:21] doctrine that has been there through the
[2:05:23] down Through the Ages but he's brought a
[2:05:25] word in this day to unleash the riches
[2:05:27] of his glory and tell you what he where

[2:05:34] name there's power in his name I can
[2:05:36] tell you ages gone by they didn't have
[2:05:38] that they were Bound by a demon of
[2:05:40] trinitarianism but God in this day
[2:05:42] there's no more Siege on that no more
[2:05:45] there's no more Siege on some Merit or
[2:05:47] action that you must do something you
[2:05:48] must whip yourself you must pay a
[2:05:50] Penance you must do this this you must
[2:05:52] do that no more it's Grace unmar
[2:05:57] [Applause]
[2:05:59] Grace I tell you there's
[2:06:02] resources you know that people are still
[2:06:05] bound to
[2:06:06] that still bound to
[2:06:13] that BR says once he gets Beyond once
[2:06:15] you get Beyond The Sound Bearer sound
[2:06:17] Bearer he said then it's Speed Unlimited
[2:06:20] you can fly free he says in the church
[2:06:21] chur and you sitting here tonight you're
[2:06:23] struggling and struggling when you come
[2:06:25] up to that sound Bearer those planes
[2:06:27] Rattle and shake and bounce around and
[2:06:29] it's he said that you're struggling
[2:06:31] God's up pulling you and showing you
[2:06:32] things he says if you can ever get past
[2:06:35] the sin barrier of unbelief if you can
[2:06:38] just press past all the doubt all that

[2:07:00] sound barrier of sin barrier of unbelief
[2:07:04] he says oh is it true Did you does it

[2:07:09] saved are you asking that question well
[2:07:12] I'm going to answer it for you could I

[2:07:35] door tonight without the filling of the
[2:07:37] Holy Spirit where you got 50 miles of
[2:07:39] Elbow Room ain't no devil in left or
[2:07:43] right
[2:07:45] sir I said it's time to break
[2:07:49] through look to the one that Caleb
[2:07:51] looked
[2:07:52] do can we make it over is that land mine
[2:07:56] can I obtain the life yes can I have
[2:07:59] Liberty
[2:08:04] yes you know the human
[2:08:07] being we got limits man man is so keen
[2:08:12] on trying to get past them man they pump
[2:08:15] Them Bodies full of pills and this
[2:08:17] protein powder this lifting weights and
[2:08:20] this they're just trying to get a little
[2:08:21] extra out of their out of their body
[2:08:24] they're trying to do mind exercises so
[2:08:26] that their memory can go a little
[2:08:27] further because they don't want to get
[2:08:29] dementa earlier so they're they're
[2:08:30] trying to make sure what can I do to
[2:08:32] extend the limit because there's a
[2:08:34] limit right
[2:08:37] here if I can just get another year we
[2:08:40] can get the life expectancy one more
[2:08:42] year another five
[2:08:44] years they craving and there's potential
[2:08:47] in here with
[2:08:49] limits you know
[2:08:52] hey I'm I got a lot of potential in here
[2:08:56] too I'm not going down
[2:09:00] there and some of you young men you do
[2:09:02] you pump your weight you do whatever and
[2:09:04] you're trying to trying to find the
[2:09:06] potential inside your being and some
[2:09:08] attain it most do not most do
[2:09:13] not indeed but potential is the latent
[2:09:17] qualities or abilities that may be
[2:09:21] developed veled and lead to future
[2:09:23] success that latent means it's existing
[2:09:26] but not yet developed or manifest it's
[2:09:30] hidden or
[2:09:31] concealed so there's a concealed quality
[2:09:34] or a hidden quality within it's lying
[2:09:37] dormant or it's hidden until
[2:09:40] circumstances that are suitable for
[2:09:42] development or
[2:09:44] manifestation all right you know and God
[2:09:47] wants to show through the scripture that
[2:09:49] there's greater there's something in
[2:09:51] side greater than just the human flesh I
[2:09:54] mean and a lot of times through the
[2:09:55] scripture God uses men and women to push
[2:09:58] past the limits that are not capable by
[2:10:01] this human body and so we can go into
[2:10:03] scripture and we can read about Samson
[2:10:05] who by all man's rights didn't have
[2:10:07] anything as far as strength but God
[2:10:10] stepped in in the moment and anointed
[2:10:12] his flesh and something greater beyond
[2:10:16] the limitations of this
[2:10:20] manifested amen how about
[2:10:24] Solomon say wow he was so wise not human
[2:10:29] wisdom but God stepped in and poured out
[2:10:34] a wisdom From Another Dimension from an
[2:10:37] unseen realm and dropped it into with
[2:10:40] Solomon's being and Solomon then exuded
[2:10:44] beyond the limitations of
[2:10:49] this Daniel dream and visions and such
[2:10:52] and different ones through scripture
[2:10:54] type after
[2:10:56] type something changed mary caught the
[2:10:59] word of God in her hour and It produced
[2:11:02] something beyond the limits of
[2:11:09] man see when God steps on the scene God
[2:11:12] don't care about your
[2:11:15] limitations man strives for it man does
[2:11:18] all it can for it he tries to put you
[2:11:21] this course and that and the other but
[2:11:22] God has the ability to go
[2:11:25] beyond in an unlimited place so
[2:11:28] unlimited that someone like Sam could
[2:11:30] have Samson could have strength to slay
[2:11:32] hundreds and hundreds of Philistines and
[2:11:34] they marveled they're like how on Earth
[2:11:35] can he do that because
[2:11:37] God simple when God steps in God has is
[2:11:41] the god of the unlimited and so God now
[2:11:43] has put his life into flesh and I want
[2:11:46] to just talk now as Mary then received
[2:11:49] the word and as an incubator
[2:11:51] then brought forth God came forth and
[2:11:54] poured himself into flesh and so now God
[2:11:57] was giving an example if I create I'm
[2:12:01] going to create flesh my body that I
[2:12:03] created not man not from Mary not from
[2:12:06] Joseph but from God spoken word that she
[2:12:09] then incubated and he poured his life
[2:12:11] into it he says now I'm going to step
[2:12:16] into Earthly measures and I'm going to
[2:12:18] show what God can do amen and to give
[2:12:23] you and I and Humanity an insight into
[2:12:28] the
[2:12:29] unlimited of God and so now he steps and
[2:12:34] yes he wept he got tired his strength
[2:12:38] withered he had to go to sleep he
[2:12:41] probably got a cut in a bruise struck
[2:12:43] his toe he bore he was a human he bore
[2:12:49] that but one day
[2:12:53] he stepped into a
[2:12:57] wedding I just know God must have been
[2:12:59] just
[2:13:01] excited because he
[2:13:05] knew
[2:13:07] today I'm going to give Humanity a taste
[2:13:11] of my
[2:13:13] unlimitedness thank you oh there's no
[2:13:16] more wine the wedding's a catastrophe
[2:13:19] everything's ruined our reputation is
[2:13:20] over over oh Mak do you think you can do
[2:13:27] something do you think I can do
[2:13:31] something and God in his
[2:13:34] Simplicity steps into a little chamber
[2:13:37] and at the Finger of God at the word of
[2:13:41] God water pots that were water turn into
[2:13:45] wine I can tell you there's no human
[2:13:47] ability that could do that but in human
[2:13:50] flesh because God life embodied that he
[2:13:53] could speak a word and change water to
[2:13:58] wine he probably had a little smirk on
[2:14:00] his on his face as he knew this was the
[2:14:03] beginning of my unlimited
[2:14:10] nature the
[2:14:12] latent the concealed or hidden quality
[2:14:16] began to now
[2:14:18] manifest why because eternity
[2:14:21] combined with the
[2:14:23] Mortal remove the
[2:14:26] limits just walk with me on this one
[2:14:29] come on get to the end of my service
[2:14:31] eternity inside the Mortal breaks
[2:14:34] through the limits of
[2:14:36] humanity come on the flesh is limited
[2:14:40] but when it's struck with the with the
[2:14:42] eternity inside it went beyond the
[2:14:44] abilities of this
[2:14:48] flesh yeah my touch can go so far far my
[2:14:51] eyeballs can see so far maybe I can see
[2:14:54] 100 yards maybe a glimmering little
[2:14:55] candle it starts to get limited or I
[2:14:58] hearing in this Dimension I can only
[2:14:59] hear someone whisper from the back I
[2:15:01] couldn't hear you cuz I'm limited in my
[2:15:04] flesh but when God life dropped in and
[2:15:07] he started to walk
[2:15:10] Hallelujah he sat down at the well with
[2:15:13] a little
[2:15:15] lady and she had a
[2:15:17] thirst man she had a thirst but human
[2:15:22] consumption of
[2:15:25] water she tasted it but it didn't quench
[2:15:28] it and she went to this husband and this
[2:15:31] husband and this husband and this need
[2:15:33] and this pleasure and that and she's
[2:15:34] trying to taste she's trying to take it
[2:15:36] in and her Humanity could not get
[2:15:38] quenched but then the one the son of man
[2:15:41] Steeps on the scene he says but if I
[2:15:44] give you water you'll never thirst again
[2:15:48] why because eternity had stepped into
[2:15:50] flesh and he said I got something
[2:15:52] greater than the limits of this Earth I
[2:15:54] can give you not this water but I can
[2:15:56] give you living water and you'll never
[2:15:59] thirst
[2:16:00] [Applause]
[2:16:03] again can you think of that
[2:16:06] moment that she started her Source was
[2:16:09] now filled and guess
[2:16:12] what she became rivers of Living Water
[2:16:18] and she tore into the city come see a
[2:16:21] man who told me everything I was it
[2:16:24] started to flow out of her because what
[2:16:26] had happened she had partaken of the
[2:16:29] same eternity and she now was Living
[2:16:31] Waters herself and sharing it saying I'm
[2:16:35] changed here's the
[2:16:37] Messiah something happens something
[2:16:40] happens when you get in contact with
[2:16:45] eternity how about the little woman that
[2:16:48] had to touch his garment
[2:16:53] that little lady tapped into another
[2:16:56] realm she was
[2:16:58] clambering my if I could which I won't
[2:17:02] but she tore through the crowd if I had
[2:17:04] time I'd have you all pour out into this
[2:17:06] aisle and i' tear straight through
[2:17:08] you cuz that's what she had to do she
[2:17:11] was tearing through she's like I don't
[2:17:12] really care about you all I'm getting
[2:17:14] through that's
[2:17:15] right she thought her human touch she
[2:17:19] knew by faay the Viking reach him
[2:17:22] something will change my need will be
[2:17:25] met the circumstance I live in if I can
[2:17:28] reach into another realm yeah it wasn't
[2:17:31] this come on it wasn't this it was Faith
[2:17:36] she was tapping into another realm I
[2:17:39] need to reach him I need to touch him
[2:17:41] but it's her faith that tapped in and
[2:17:44] the limits of her body the limits of her
[2:17:47] touch pressed past into another
[2:17:49] dimension and God's virtue passed from
[2:17:53] him to her and she was
[2:17:55] [Applause]
[2:18:02] healed brother Brown says the doctor's
[2:18:06] limited God is unlimited the doctor he
[2:18:10] can work with two senses what he can see
[2:18:13] what he can feel only his two senses he
[2:18:16] can declare that will declare anything
[2:18:18] but God has
[2:18:21] untapped
[2:18:24] resources
[2:18:26] Hallelujah I wonder if we can just bring
[2:18:28] it to
[2:18:30] today how
[2:18:33] about there's something happened in the
[2:18:35] building a healing it's a lady sitting
[2:18:38] here right here in the audience kind of
[2:18:40] heavy set lady she's got her hands up
[2:18:42] her eyes are closed and she's
[2:18:45] praying she's got a bowel trouble and a
[2:18:47] back trouble and she's praying for God
[2:18:49] to heal her she sitting right here
[2:18:51] wearing glasses a dark suit right at the
[2:18:53] end of this row you got your hands up

[2:18:57] right ra ra raise your hands I don't
[2:18:59] know you or strangers go home now you
[2:19:02] touched the border of His Garment you
[2:19:06] touched him because I'm 20 ft from you
[2:19:09] but you touched him the high priest that
[2:19:11] can be touched by the feeling of our
[2:19:14] infirmities if it can happen to that
[2:19:16] lady in that meeting surely you can also
[2:19:19] reach by faith in another realm and tap
[2:19:23] into the resources of the god of the
[2:19:25] unlimited don't limit to God to's 1950
[2:19:28] 1960
[2:19:30] 19658 don't limit him there don't let
[2:19:32] your puny mind of time limit God to 58
[2:19:36] he's got a 2024
[2:19:44] Saints how about
[2:19:47] Martha you know one of my most favorite
[2:19:49] lines of scripture is when she says even
[2:19:56] now Lord You're the resurrection in
[2:20:00] life do you believe Martha yes Lord I
[2:20:03] know he'll rais but even now even
[2:20:12] now one could speak she was speaking to
[2:20:16] one that could reach into the regions
[2:20:20] I'm sorry but our human limitation ends
[2:20:23] at
[2:20:25] death but she was speaking to one who
[2:20:28] could go far beyond the Realms of this
[2:20:31] life he could tap into another dimension
[2:20:34] even now Lord I know you're the
[2:20:36] resurrection and
[2:20:38] life though he said believe that is
[2:20:40] Martha though he were dead yet shall he
[2:20:42] live yes Lord I believe even now and at
[2:20:45] the word of God by a name spoken it
[2:20:50] reached and pierced into another
[2:20:52] dimension and penetrated far to wherever
[2:20:55] Lazarus was and cried
[2:20:58] Lazarus come
[2:21:00] forth Lazarus I know where he was but he
[2:21:03] must have got the call and said I'm
[2:21:05] actually due back on
[2:21:07] Earth because
[2:21:09] one that could Pierce into another
[2:21:12] dimension that could tap into the
[2:21:14] unlimited Martha's Faith believed on the
[2:21:17] resurrection and he said don't worry
[2:21:19] Martha I can speak it and I'll call him
[2:21:25] back all right I'll jump
[2:21:30] ahead who lives in
[2:21:35] you who's Holy Ghost
[2:21:39] filled
[2:21:42] okay so then whose life lives in
[2:21:49] you what did he say
[2:21:51] Moses why Cry To
[2:21:53] Me
[2:21:54] Speak Hallelujah you know one thing that
[2:21:57] you have that's unlimited I'll tell you
[2:21:59] your
[2:22:01] words some people use less and some
[2:22:03] people use more but I can tell you you
[2:22:05] could talk 24 hours a day 365 you have
[2:22:08] pretty much got a limited words and by
[2:22:10] your confession Hallelujah instead of
[2:22:12] using them words for who knows what else
[2:22:14] you could speak and continually confess
[2:22:16] the word of God and those words reach
[2:22:19] into the eternities and tap into another
[2:22:21] realm and reach the unlimited resources
[2:22:23] of God say God I've got a son I've got a
[2:22:26] daughter I've got a need I've got a
[2:22:27] circumstance I'm going to use my words
[2:22:31] to confess what your word said I'm going
[2:22:33] to put it on my lips and the unlimited
[2:22:35] resource you gave me I'm going to use it
[2:22:38] to profess the finished
[2:22:41] [Applause]
[2:22:47] work habac says and the Lord answered me
[2:22:49] and said write the vision and make it
[2:22:51] plain upon the tables that he may run
[2:22:53] that readeth it for the vision is yet an
[2:22:55] appointed time but at the end it shall
[2:22:57] speak and not lie though it t wait for
[2:22:59] it because it will surely come it will
[2:23:02] not t behold his soul which is lifted up
[2:23:05] is not upright in him but the just shall
[2:23:10] live by
[2:23:15] faith I wonder tonight who's a Martha
[2:23:21] that needs to cry out even
[2:23:26] now my Limitless God even
[2:23:30] now but BR says when a man when a man
[2:23:33] once catches that vision of the
[2:23:35] invisible God and know that he's always
[2:23:38] present oh you say brother Michael you
[2:23:39] pasted that quote in after last night
[2:23:42] that's wrong that was already in my
[2:23:44] notes so God knows that you needed to
[2:23:47] hear it twice
[2:23:51] when a man once catches that vision of
[2:23:52] the invisible God and know that he's
[2:23:55] always present as you heard last night
[2:23:57] there's something that stabilizes that
[2:23:59] man's thinking it stabilizes his actions
[2:24:02] and in the time of distress and trouble
[2:24:05] it still make him look upward and above
[2:24:08] the things that are happening around him
[2:24:10] because he's looking at the Unseen he's
[2:24:12] looking at the god of the Limitless amen
[2:24:16] yet by promise he says now how Abraham
[2:24:18] how not only did he see the UN and the
[2:24:20] reason he believed it was because it God
[2:24:22] said it he said and if we be dead in
[2:24:24] Christ we are Abraham's seed and if the
[2:24:26] spirit that was in Christ dwells in US
[2:24:29] it does the same thing it takes every
[2:24:31] Divine promise of God that's in the
[2:24:34] Bible and calls it present
[2:24:38] tense
[2:24:40] Hall amen because in my notes he said
[2:24:44] because that present God is unlimit is
[2:24:47] Unlimited in his resources to meet every
[2:24:50] one of your needs you say well brother
[2:24:53] Michael you're just copying your dad no
[2:24:56] the Holy Ghost is saying again to
[2:24:58] confirm to you I heard and now I'm
[2:25:01] meeting your
[2:25:06] [Music]
[2:25:08] need you know there was a man named
[2:25:14] Legion this was a
[2:25:18] duel because here
[2:25:22] Satan had done everything and he started
[2:25:25] pouring on demon after demon and whether
[2:25:30] it was a lie or whether he stole I don't
[2:25:32] know what he did and one Spirit came
[2:25:34] upon him and then another Spirit came
[2:25:36] upon him and it just continued to evolve
[2:25:39] and to grow and to grow until this man
[2:25:42] was a complete bundle of
[2:25:46] demons think about
[2:25:48] it and Satan he must have put his
[2:25:52] shoulders back and buttoned up his coat
[2:25:55] and said there there is a picture
[2:25:58] there's a picture of what I can
[2:26:01] do this is the epitome of my
[2:26:06] power and he watched with Glee as he
[2:26:09] went raving and spitting and cutting
[2:26:11] himself through the tombs of the dead
[2:26:14] and Satan stood back and said look what
[2:26:17] I can do look at my power
[2:26:28] but then the same
[2:26:31] God that had proved
[2:26:33] himself
[2:26:35] already gets off a
[2:26:38] boat tired he's tired he'd been
[2:26:42] preaching Healing The Sick meeting the
[2:26:44] needs he steps onto the
[2:26:48] shore and Satan says says oh yeah it
[2:26:53] Showdown and he sends that demon Laden
[2:26:56] man right to the feet of
[2:27:01] Jesus and those demons they know who's
[2:27:06] God they fall down and they start to
[2:27:10] scream
[2:27:11] out scream out and call and worship
[2:27:14] don't send this out and they start to to
[2:27:16] manifest
[2:27:18] themselves and in
[2:27:22] flesh is now in a
[2:27:26] duel between a limited devil and an
[2:27:31] unlimited
[2:27:33] [Applause]
[2:27:35] God everything the devil could pour on
[2:27:39] he poured on this was his moment to
[2:27:41] shine this is his time to say all right
[2:27:44] this is what I can do here's my Showcase
[2:27:47] of my power of the darkness that I can
[2:27:50] contain and a little humble man that he
[2:27:59] thought at the Finger of
[2:28:02] God loose
[2:28:06] him it wasn't some super duper prayer
[2:28:10] service it wasn't I'm calling Heaven
[2:28:12] down and I'm casting you out no no God
[2:28:16] just said leave him
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:28] the unlimited God yes
[2:28:30] sir nothing nothing could stop Legion
[2:28:35] from his freedom at that moment nothing
[2:28:38] the limits of Satan were so on display I
[2:28:42] pray you hold this in your mind the
[2:28:44] epitome of his power was so limited at
[2:28:46] that moment because God was going to
[2:28:48] show you and I there's nothing he can do
[2:28:52] that is more or more greater than the
[2:28:54] power that God had when God in flesh
[2:28:58] stepped on the
[2:28:59] [Applause]
[2:29:02] SE come on I can tell you when Legion
[2:29:05] was free I can tell you the Devils were
[2:29:07] holding on tight come on don't let him
[2:29:10] go don't let him go Satan saying hold on
[2:29:13] boys hold on let him
[2:29:16] [Applause]
[2:29:18] go Legion Broke
[2:29:21] Free he tore off he said Glory I'm free
[2:29:26] because an unlimited God stepped on the
[2:29:34] scene so then what's your need tonight
[2:29:37] my God the unlimited the omnipotent is
[2:29:41] here tonight I don't care if you say
[2:29:44] well brother Michael I'm a legion well
[2:29:46] I'll tell you this that's the limits of
[2:29:49] Satan's
[2:29:50] the unlimited
[2:29:52] God
[2:29:57] let
[2:30:00] [Applause]
[2:30:07] Hallelujah don't leave tonight don't
[2:30:10] leave
[2:30:12] tonight my goodness I can tell you
[2:30:15] Legion had the
[2:30:17] opportunity this is your moment Christ
[2:30:20] is coming on the scene the unlimited God
[2:30:22] is coming your way I can tell you he was
[2:30:25] not going to miss that
[2:30:29] moment you
[2:30:32] know and the Devils would tried their
[2:30:35] level best but he was a seed of
[2:30:38] God I don't care how hard the Devils
[2:30:41] tried to run this direction and pull him
[2:30:44] and took a war nothing the seed was
[2:30:48] being beckoned yes by the master and it
[2:30:52] called him and it drew him whether he
[2:30:54] liked or not down to the seat of the one
[2:30:57] that could save him if you're a seed of
[2:30:59] God I don't care what devil thinks I
[2:31:02] don't care what he says I don't care
[2:31:04] what doubt he cast in your mind you're
[2:31:05] getting drawn in because you're a seed
[2:31:08] of God and his word starts to call and
[2:31:11] beckon you to his
[2:31:14] feet Hallelujah
[2:31:18] [Music]
[2:31:20] one
[2:31:23] man I got to skip
[2:31:26] this you know when you approach him
[2:31:29] right when you approach him right it
[2:31:33] unlocks the resources of God approach
[2:31:36] him wrong and you get no response it's
[2:31:41] important barus cried out son of David
[2:31:43] have mercy on me and God met his need
[2:31:47] another little lady cried out son of
[2:31:49] David
[2:31:50] he didn't didn't even answer her didn't
[2:31:53] didn't say a
[2:31:54] word oh Lord I help
[2:32:01] me approach to the
[2:32:05] word is
[2:32:09] vital you know after she said Lord help
[2:32:13] me she worshiped she says I need you and
[2:32:17] then she humbled herself amen
[2:32:20] yes cuz he said even dogs he says yes
[2:32:25] Lord she humbled herself to the word
[2:32:27] whatever the word was saying she said
[2:32:29] yes
[2:32:31] Lord
[2:32:33] unlocked actually unlocked the healing
[2:32:36] for her
[2:32:37] daughter so as a parent as a loved one
[2:32:40] as a mom as a dad we approach the word
[2:32:43] with the right respect with the right
[2:32:45] right approach the right attitude the
[2:32:46] right mod the right objective we
[2:32:48] approach him Lord whatever your word
[2:32:50] says I just need you to unlock the
[2:32:53] resources for my daughter that's all she
[2:32:56] cared for that's all she
[2:33:02] desired I'm going to shift years a
[2:33:04] little
[2:33:09] bit what in a
[2:33:11] moment when now that life that lived in
[2:33:15] flesh deity in flesh God in morphe
[2:33:21] came down and now hung on
[2:33:25] Calvary because there's a barrier
[2:33:28] there's a limit that you and I couldn't
[2:33:32] go into his
[2:33:35] presence and God broke that Veil The
[2:33:38] Flesh Veil so that you and I could now
[2:33:41] approach and enter in
[2:33:44] boldly I preached on it year a little
[2:33:46] while back but I was just pondering a
[2:33:48] little when how that priest he was the
[2:33:51] only one that could go in once a year
[2:33:54] that's all just him and how everybody
[2:33:56] would have looked at him and just
[2:33:58] yearned if I could just go into the
[2:34:00] presence of God if I could just be the
[2:34:04] high priest oh just a taste of that shuk
[2:34:06] kind Glory I could have a morel of that
[2:34:10] mana and the priest did everything
[2:34:14] required everything was ready everything
[2:34:17] was ready for the S of bringing in the
[2:34:19] blood and the atonement and he walk in
[2:34:22] and everybody would be hushed
[2:34:25] yearning oh what would that be like to
[2:34:29] step into the Shana presence of
[2:34:33] God but your God said I yearn for that
[2:34:37] too so I'm going to step down and I'm
[2:34:40] going to break the
[2:34:41] veil so that you can step in and come
[2:34:45] into my presence and you too can face on
[2:34:49] the Mana Living Word of God you too can
[2:34:52] come into and you can let the veil close
[2:34:54] behind and it's just you and
[2:34:58] [Music]
[2:35:06] me you know we put a mental
[2:35:08] limit on the blood of
[2:35:12] Calvary because we get limited in our
[2:35:14] mind as we're humans of
[2:35:17] measurement and we can run this
[2:35:20] sometimes into the Realms of
[2:35:23] sin and we measure
[2:35:25] sin we measure it bad this is this is a
[2:35:29] white lie that's not a white lie you
[2:35:32] know that's just a little false that's
[2:35:34] almost all truth but a little false but
[2:35:37] that's so that's kind of less sin and
[2:35:39] that's more sin you he murdered but he
[2:35:42] only gave a white lie I'm sorry but to
[2:35:45] God it's all
[2:35:47] sin if White Lies were on the SC jaale
[2:35:49] of things low and just minor sins well
[2:35:52] then Eve had a very minor
[2:35:55] sin really at the end of the day she
[2:35:57] just just teeny little bit she doubted a
[2:36:00] little
[2:36:01] bit and that caused the world to go into
[2:36:03] chaos so I'm telling you there's no unit
[2:36:04] of measurement in sin for God it's just
[2:36:06] all wrong all sin but somehow we
[2:36:09] classify things and then so those that
[2:36:11] have grave sins you know somehow that
[2:36:12] merits the deepest deepest regions of
[2:36:14] hell and sins that are so bad you yes
[2:36:17] there are sins you can cross the line
[2:36:18] indeed but that's not I'm going but
[2:36:20] butam says if the truth of gospel has
[2:36:21] been presented to you in such a way that
[2:36:23] you have to see it and because of
[2:36:25] popularity or something else you turn
[2:36:26] your back to it and walk away and don't
[2:36:29] want to see it that's where you cross
[2:36:31] the line for he disbelieves willfully
[2:36:33] after he has received the knowledge of
[2:36:34] the truth there remaineth no sacrifice
[2:36:36] for sin but that's so that's a different
[2:36:39] but I want to talk about even our
[2:36:40] measurement where even David you know we
[2:36:42] can look at David and all his sin and
[2:36:43] that all adultery that he committed and
[2:36:45] lusted after a woman plotted to to to
[2:36:48] mask the sin POS IAH so that he was the
[2:36:50] dad and then that didn't work so then he
[2:36:52] plotted a murder and then indeed did
[2:36:54] have Uriah murdered and we just look at
[2:36:56] that and say oh dear goodness David that
[2:36:58] is uh that's at the
[2:37:00] top brother Brown says and the prophet
[2:37:02] said
[2:37:03] surely he says Grace you'll not
[2:37:07] die you'll not die David he says Grace
[2:37:10] has saved you it was Grace to David that
[2:37:13] saved him if it hadn't been for Grace
[2:37:16] where would we be isn't that right
[2:37:19] sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One
[2:37:21] Sovereign Grace from a sovereign one he
[2:37:23] said it twice Sovereign he says what can
[2:37:26] Sovereign Grace can only be given from
[2:37:28] one that's Sovereign and God is
[2:37:31] Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace
[2:37:33] therefore being Sovereign Grace don't
[2:37:35] have to ask nobody it don't have to be
[2:37:38] like hey should I should I let them
[2:37:40] should I let them off the hook should I
[2:37:41] cover their sin should my blood atone
[2:37:43] for that no he don't have to ask nobody
[2:37:44] no question he just says my grace
[2:37:49] he says it does what it wants to it
[2:37:51] isn't that wonderful it don't have to
[2:37:52] ask can I do this or shall I do that can
[2:37:54] I must I will I doesn't do it it does it
[2:37:56] itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he
[2:37:59] can save the violence he can save the
[2:38:01] worst he can save the impur he can save
[2:38:03] the immoralist he can heal the sick is
[2:38:07] hallelujah that's the blood of Calvary
[2:38:10] that tore back the veil and shed it on
[2:38:12] the cross he said there's
[2:38:14] nothing it's Unlimited in its Grace
[2:38:18] Hallelujah
[2:38:23] you say well brother Michael I still
[2:38:25] feel that it's I'm unsavable in that
[2:38:29] sense all right I'll just level you
[2:38:33] up manasse in the scripture began to
[2:38:36] rain at 12 for 55 years he says to have
[2:38:40] the longest
[2:38:41] rain in Israel he came from a believing
[2:38:43] home he had a good daddy Hezekiah did
[2:38:45] right in God's eyes he repaired altars
[2:38:48] he followed the ways of David Hezekiah
[2:38:50] was faithful he had a heart for God it
[2:38:51] was a solid home and Manasseh grew up in
[2:38:54] this home this good message believing
[2:38:56] solid home he believed there or manasse
[2:38:59] was born there and often in those types
[2:39:02] of homes often young ones that have
[2:39:05] grown up in the message we see that they
[2:39:07] will go off and they will go off and
[2:39:09] sometimes it isn't like the sin is even
[2:39:11] intensified those that are raised in the
[2:39:13] message and they go off into sin well
[2:39:15] Manasseh he was it was all the Heathen
[2:39:18] altars he started to repair Hezekiah
[2:39:19] died Manasseh grows up takes rain at 12
[2:39:22] and he starts to repair all the Heathen
[2:39:24] altars his father tore down he removed
[2:39:26] and destroyed the altars of God the
[2:39:28] Groves and high places he put altars for
[2:39:31] all the host of Heaven he he put away
[2:39:33] the altars he said you you name it he
[2:39:35] made an altar for all the gods he made
[2:39:37] an altar for this God for that God for
[2:39:39] that he basically walked over the
[2:39:41] testimony of his daddy
[2:39:45] right undoing all that his ancestors
[2:39:47] done before him if I could say this he
[2:39:49] was destroying the testimony of his
[2:39:52] family that was that was before him that
[2:39:54] that what they had held up and he set up
[2:39:56] Gods to bail and such in the house of
[2:39:58] the Lord desecrating the Holy Temple in
[2:40:00] the very place where God was worshiped
[2:40:02] is there any I would say is there
[2:40:04] anything different than someone coming
[2:40:05] today sitting in the house of the Lord
[2:40:08] boldly living a sinful life no
[2:40:11] different he influenced Israel to sin he
[2:40:14] helped counsel countless soul to sin
[2:40:16] encouraged joyously LED his country to
[2:40:19] sin tremendously before God and
[2:40:24] then he even allowed his own children to
[2:40:27] be
[2:40:29] sacrificed the
[2:40:32] unthinkable I'd
[2:40:34] say no different than maybe sending our
[2:40:36] CH children into the fires of this world
[2:40:38] and allowing the garbage that's
[2:40:40] presented before them and willfully
[2:40:41] subjecting them to the Fashions and gods
[2:40:43] of this world into the fire not a lot of
[2:40:46] different and this is what Manasseh did
[2:40:48] in the natural
[2:40:49] and even if you think this Abomination
[2:40:51] did not satisfy Manasseh he was the very
[2:40:54] glutton for iniquity he used
[2:40:55] enchantments and dealt with famili
[2:40:57] familiar spirits and deal with the Devil
[2:41:00] by seeking all kinds of Supernatural
[2:41:01] witcheries and
[2:41:03] wizardries and if that wasn't enough 2
[2:41:06] Kings 21:16 says and moreover Manasseh
[2:41:09] shed innocent blood very much till he
[2:41:13] had filled Jerusalem from one end to the
[2:41:18] other but besides his sin wherewith he
[2:41:20] made Judah to sin and doing that which
[2:41:21] was evil in the sight of the Lord and I
[2:41:24] could say heaping up Mountain on
[2:41:26] mountain of foul sin after foul sin and
[2:41:29] I might say that maybe manasse would be
[2:41:31] the compound of every sort of wickedness
[2:41:33] I don't know if there was even more of a
[2:41:36] person that was more evil that could
[2:41:38] have done any more than manasse so I
[2:41:40] don't really care I'm talking to
[2:41:41] somebody here that might be saying
[2:41:43] somehow that your sin or your state of
[2:41:45] being is at the max and I just don't
[2:41:47] know God could ever save me May maybe
[2:41:49] I've crossed the line you're here that
[2:41:51] tells me you haven't crossed the line
[2:41:53] and so there is manasse here here and if
[2:41:55] you ended there in Second Kings then the
[2:41:57] prophets were sent out to him and
[2:41:59] different ones that judgment was going
[2:42:00] to come and 2 Kings 2:20 2 Kings 21:10
[2:42:04] says the Lord spake to his servants to
[2:42:05] prophets and they said we're going to
[2:42:07] bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah
[2:42:09] and more and whosoever heareth both his
[2:42:11] ears shall
[2:42:13] tingle God is bringing
[2:42:16] judgment and you can read 2 Kings 21 and
[2:42:19] you can see a life in a trail of evil
[2:42:21] all the way through of the most
[2:42:24] wretched that will make your ears even
[2:42:26] tingle of the judgments that God put
[2:42:27] down on
[2:42:30] him and you would think that's terrible
[2:42:33] of all
[2:42:34] terribleness but if you didn't ever jump
[2:42:37] up into 2 Chronicles you only got half
[2:42:40] the
[2:42:41] picture because Manassa through all that
[2:42:44] sin and shame and something his daddy
[2:42:46] had told him maybe come back to his mind
[2:42:48] maybe has a had had a little devotion
[2:42:50] with him one day and he talked to him of
[2:42:52] a limitless God he says manaso our God
[2:42:56] is Jehovah he is God he's capable of the
[2:42:59] impossible he can move mountains he can
[2:43:01] part Red Seas he can bring Mana when
[2:43:03] there was no food he can give he just
[2:43:05] would go through the Miracles and
[2:43:06] wonders of God All Through the Ages and
[2:43:08] he would teach him Manasseh God's the
[2:43:11] god of the impossible he can do all
[2:43:12] things don't ever don't ever limit
[2:43:17] Jehovah a man
[2:43:20] as he's in Affliction
[2:43:23] now the scripture says he brought them
[2:43:26] to a Syria manasse among the Thorns they
[2:43:29] bound him with FEDS carried into Babylon
[2:43:31] and when he was in Affliction when he
[2:43:33] was in Affliction he besought the Lord
[2:43:37] his
[2:43:37] God and humbled himself greatly before
[2:43:41] the god of his fathers and prayed unto
[2:43:44] him and he was intreated of him and he
[2:43:46] heard his supplication and brought him
[2:43:49] came to Jerusalem then manasse knew the
[2:43:52] Lord he was
[2:43:54] God Hallelujah the limit unlimited power
[2:43:59] of the blood I don't if God can do that
[2:44:02] and pardon and save and keep manasse
[2:44:05] through all that he did do not tell me
[2:44:08] whatever you've done is worse than that
[2:44:10] that's in scripture at the highest peak
[2:44:13] of evil to tell you God's blood can
[2:44:17] cover all sin
[2:44:19] [Applause]
[2:44:27] don't limit this token
[2:44:30] blood don't put a limit on what it can
[2:44:35] do God did not go through all that in
[2:44:38] scripture I'm going to come down to a
[2:44:41] close God did not go through all
[2:44:43] scripture and to show of his unlimited
[2:44:46] nature and the resources that you can
[2:44:48] take tap
[2:44:49] into just to leave it
[2:44:54] there God didn't do that just to walk
[2:44:56] and be like yeah this is what I can
[2:44:58] do though he was doing that but he
[2:45:01] wasn't stopping
[2:45:03] there because that same unlimited
[2:45:08] resource at Calvary and that spear
[2:45:11] pierced his side and his blood was shed
[2:45:14] and the spirit left him it was going
[2:45:16] somewhere
[2:45:20] it wasn't staying there with him he had
[2:45:22] somebody a bride in his mind that he
[2:45:26] says I need to deposit my unlimited
[2:45:29] nature
[2:45:31] into that's the greater plan Saints it
[2:45:34] this doesn't end at scripture we got to
[2:45:35] bring it right to here right to now the
[2:45:38] same unlimited resource lays within you
[2:45:41] and in me amen you said well brother
[2:45:43] Michael that God in flesh veiled yes
[2:45:45] brother Bram says now the same word that
[2:45:47] the prophet spoke the same word that was
[2:45:49] made flesh that same word dwells in the
[2:45:52] church therefore we don't compromise
[2:45:54] that word we stay right with it if it
[2:45:56] don't we don't compromise the same word
[2:45:58] living in you we'll produce the same
[2:46:04] thing sir why was God so focused why is
[2:46:08] the scripture so everywhere through
[2:46:10] scripture it's it's F it's Union it's a
[2:46:12] bride it's a virgin womb it's a pure
[2:46:14] bride it's a church unadulterated we we
[2:46:16] can see this all through scripture it's
[2:46:18] because because it's bringing to
[2:46:19] realities God there's something that
[2:46:21] he's wanting to to to to unite with he's
[2:46:25] wanting to deposit something in it it
[2:46:27] must be the right one I tell you the
[2:46:29] wrong woman and the right okay let me
[2:46:31] back up there are Potentials in a woman
[2:46:33] and Potentials in a man and when they
[2:46:35] come together those potentials can
[2:46:38] manifest all right but bring the wrong
[2:46:40] man on the wrong woman and you got chaos
[2:46:43] but bring the right man and the right
[2:46:45] woman it becomes perfect in God's eyes
[2:46:47] and it can bring together or manif EST
[2:46:49] am the potentials that lay inside all
[2:46:53] right so God is in is so
[2:46:56] concerned that his bride is being united
[2:47:00] the potential in her is not a corrupted
[2:47:03] hybrid
[2:47:10] potential but random says God has never
[2:47:15] changed he's determined to do something
[2:47:18] and nothing going to stop him he'll do
[2:47:21] it the gene that God put in you you
[2:47:24] might not see it you might not feel it
[2:47:27] you might not be able to hear it but
[2:47:29] there's a resource inside
[2:47:32] you that's waiting to come in
[2:47:35] connection with the
[2:47:38] groom and that unseen potential laying
[2:47:40] inside your soul it requires life or
[2:47:43] light I should say that would that could
[2:47:45] was triggered at Calvary to strike the
[2:47:47] seed Within amen and that manifestation
[2:47:50] that seed Gene of God that's in there is
[2:47:52] a potential and it's waiting to be
[2:47:54] unlocked by the word of this hour amen
[2:47:58] that's what the that's why it's so
[2:47:59] critical to see and to see the word
[2:48:02] revealed in this day and age because God
[2:48:04] placed inside of you a potential a life
[2:48:07] that's sitting there a seed that's
[2:48:08] sitting there but it can't be unlocked
[2:48:10] it's latent until a certain time period
[2:48:13] when the word gets manifest in this day
[2:48:15] and Strikes you
[2:48:21] amen that's what this message is it's
[2:48:24] the removal of all limits that's what
[2:48:27] the loosening of these seals are it's
[2:48:29] God removing the limits it's not God
[2:48:32] saying this God's limits but he's
[2:48:35] revealing or opening the what his word
[2:48:38] can do I should say it's opening what
[2:48:40] you the revelation of what he is he's
[2:48:43] always been unlimited but Through the
[2:48:45] Ages only Luther saw the just to live by
[2:48:47] faith we Wesley only saw well it's saved
[2:48:50] by grace but in this day God tore off
[2:48:54] the limits of Revelation and said I'm
[2:48:56] going to pour in this day a word so that
[2:48:59] you can see yourself as
[2:49:03] [Applause]
[2:49:04] unlimited that's what this message is
[2:49:07] it's so you know who you are so you can
[2:49:10] tap into the same
[2:49:16] life but it required a minor
[2:49:19] it required deep exploration it required
[2:49:22] a prophet to be to the mighty Angel to
[2:49:25] descend and give him an open book so
[2:49:27] that he could then present it to you and
[2:49:29] I oh my goodness I pray we get it
[2:49:32] tonight you have the unlimited resource
[2:49:35] of God deposited inside of
[2:49:39] you he removed the barriers the fingers
[2:49:42] of the false doctrine of the false
[2:49:44] prophet loosing and releasing all of the
[2:49:46] different constraints freeing the trap
[2:49:49] that Luther was under tearing the seal
[2:49:51] off that Wesley was under Pentecost was
[2:49:54] in a barrier but God was removing it
[2:50:01] all God this day says I'm
[2:50:05] done I need her to know who she
[2:50:08] is I need her to be free from all
[2:50:13] limitations I need her to know because I
[2:50:16] need her to get a little bit I need her
[2:50:18] to get Rel released from
[2:50:21] Gravity loser was kind of bound down he
[2:50:24] didn't have it all Wesley was also bound
[2:50:26] down Pentecost a little bound down but
[2:50:29] in this day this hour you and I have
[2:50:32] been given a word so you can see wait a
[2:50:35] second is that what God did all this for
[2:50:37] he came he typed himself all the way
[2:50:39] through in Joseph and in David and all
[2:50:41] that so he could reveal himself of who
[2:50:43] he is so then I can see that I'm part of
[2:50:45] him so that I can say if it's his life
[2:50:47] in me that I'm like him if he's a
[2:50:49] resurrection I also have Resurrection
[2:50:51] inside of me that's why yes that's why
[2:50:54] that's why this word came to tear the
[2:50:57] [Applause]
[2:51:01] limits I'm not a god of some Catholic
[2:51:04] Idol I'm not a god of Sanctified living
[2:51:06] just or just a god of gifts and healings
[2:51:08] and tongues I'm a God desirous of a
[2:51:12] bride I need to bring her back to Eden
[2:51:15] Beauty
[2:51:19] I'm just going to lift her vision a
[2:51:21] little so she can see herself as
[2:51:28] unlimited that's why these final seal
[2:51:30] these seals were
[2:51:34] broken it was a secret till
[2:51:39] now but brand said musicians you better
[2:51:44] come I might have you sit here for a
[2:51:46] little bit
[2:51:49] but if you make your way I I say at home
[2:51:50] you put the pressure on me
[2:51:52] so but Brown says well end on this I was
[2:51:55] thinking that the natural man went out
[2:51:57] at the Unseen of his
[2:51:59] eye and pulled an atom down out of the
[2:52:02] sky and split that atom in two that
[2:52:05] destroys human life and if the natural
[2:52:08] man that knows nothing of God can
[2:52:11] draw amen he says this knows nothing of
[2:52:14] God and cannot know nothing of God
[2:52:15] except he be converted then his soul
[2:52:17] becomes alive with with the supernatural
[2:52:19] he says if he could do that in the
[2:52:21] natural realm what ought man of God be
[2:52:27] doing so man can split an atom destroy
[2:52:30] human life this is
[2:52:32] 1949 he says what ought man of God the
[2:52:36] man of God be doing friends he says the
[2:52:38] church is far behind let's pray my God
[2:52:41] that we'll move his church up the
[2:52:43] natural man with natural resource is
[2:52:44] getting greater results than people that
[2:52:47] call themselves Christians let's press
[2:52:48] into the Unseen the blessings are yours
[2:52:51] they're there for
[2:52:53] you I thought Lord
[2:52:57] 1949 so then I did a little
[2:53:00] research and in
[2:53:02] 19499 man
[2:53:04] indeed with vision and the splitting of
[2:53:07] an
[2:53:08] atom that creates a very large large
[2:53:11] emission of energy bomb think bomb and
[2:53:15] brother BR is saying how can natural man
[2:53:17] be doing this
[2:53:19] we should be the spiritual man we're way
[2:53:21] behind this there's power there in fion
[2:53:24] magnitudes of
[2:53:31] Power Man was tapping into God's
[2:53:34] laboratory splitting breaking apart and
[2:53:39] destroying but there's a greater
[2:53:43] method I loved it so I'm just going to
[2:53:46] love preaching it right here right now
[2:53:48] there's a greater method that man has
[2:53:50] been unable to harness they've tried
[2:53:53] since the for about 100 and something or
[2:53:55] 1930s or something like that they've
[2:53:57] been trying to harness fusion fusion is
[2:54:01] the combination of two small particles
[2:54:04] joining to one and the magnitude of
[2:54:07] power that comes out of fusion is almost
[2:54:11] Limitless in fact man even considers it
[2:54:14] Limitless that's Fusion but they can't
[2:54:16] figure out because it's actually the
[2:54:18] Collision they need so much energy for
[2:54:21] Fusion okay it's the same process fion
[2:54:25] doesn't happen naturally in the world
[2:54:28] man has to do it man has to create
[2:54:30] division man has to create a bomb that
[2:54:33] splits but naturally in this world
[2:54:36] Fusion happens where it happens
[2:54:38] naturally in the Su n on the sun that's
[2:54:42] what's powering the sun is Fusion it is
[2:54:45] a power unlike no other in the Stars and
[2:54:48] I thought well there must have been in
[2:54:50] 49 brother Brandon was looking saying
[2:54:52] where's where's the spiritual man but in
[2:54:55] 1963 I said oh my goodness Fusion began
[2:54:59] to happen as a bride was starting to
[2:55:02] unite and collide with the s o n of God
[2:55:06] and a power was getting released in this
[2:55:09] day so that a unlimited power was
[2:55:13] released into his bride
[2:55:20] the sun's massive gravitational force
[2:55:22] naturally includes induces fusion and
[2:55:25] without that force a higher temperature
[2:55:26] is needed man cannot do
[2:55:32] it but it happens in the
[2:55:36] stars I thought Lord that's what's
[2:55:39] happening right here it's Fusion it's a
[2:55:43] bride being fused with the groom
[2:55:50] amen fision that's for man but Fusion
[2:55:55] this is she this bride in this last day
[2:55:58] an unlimited bride in resources she's
[2:56:02] now tapping into she's become part of
[2:56:05] the
[2:56:10] source if you're part of the
[2:56:14] source then what's inside you
[2:56:18] then what are you capable
[2:56:20] of
[2:56:23] [Music]
[2:56:24] [Applause]
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:29] speaking it's like you're almost a
[2:56:32] Super
[2:56:36] Woman not no super Wonder Woman of this
[2:56:41] world you have to realize that natural
[2:56:44] inspiration of the of Darkness Taps into
[2:56:47] a realm and if they're tapping in that
[2:56:49] then what is happening it's called God's
[2:56:52] super lady is being
[2:56:55] manifest you say well brother Mark I
[2:56:57] don't really feel how am I ever a
[2:56:58] Superman how am I a superwoman well
[2:57:01] because you walk out on a street of
[2:57:04] every filthy demon is throwing every bit
[2:57:06] of wickedness your way and you bow your
[2:57:08] head and you deny it I sat in a plane
[2:57:12] with all filth and garbage on every
[2:57:13] screen around me I just said oh God
[2:57:16] where are we living I put my a lay buds
[2:57:19] on that's the power of God because you
[2:57:23] sisters reject the power of an enemy to
[2:57:25] Adorn yourself with garments fit for
[2:57:27] Destruction that is an Abomination to
[2:57:29] God and live in Purity and no makeup and
[2:57:31] no jewels and all this because you men
[2:57:33] are men not cowering to the ideals of
[2:57:35] weakness and Jellyfish standard because
[2:57:37] you sisters stand up to head stand under
[2:57:39] headship submitting to the word as help
[2:57:42] meets not swallowing this girl power or
[2:57:44] any power but it's God power in you and
[2:57:46] me because young people won't let the
[2:57:48] perversion of Hollywood and music and
[2:57:50] fith and entertainment that's a super

[3:21:44] sickness and not not just people being
[3:21:48] prayed for because oh I hope I I need to
[3:21:52] get well or I need the Holy Ghost you
[3:21:54] know where you find the holy ghost in
[3:21:56] your
[3:22:00] closet that's where you find it when
[3:22:03] you're really hungry and you're really
[3:22:06] desperate but I wonder tonight if
[3:22:09] there's one Among Us that's a
[3:22:13] Believer and you have a sickness
[3:22:17] you have a
[3:22:20] disease and you'd like the
[3:22:23] Saints to pray for
[3:22:25] you and you believe that if the Saints
[3:22:28] pray for you that you'll be
[3:22:34] well that's a simple
[3:22:38] challenge now maybe there's nobody sick
[3:22:41] amongst
[3:22:42] us maybe nobody's suffering with a
[3:22:45] disease and I say I thank God for that
[3:22:49] but I'm not afraid to challenge that
[3:22:51] sickness if he's in on your
[3:22:57] life so I just want to say if if you
[3:23:00] that it's right there before
[3:23:02] you you can either say I I've got this
[3:23:05] problem or I'm
[3:23:07] sick and I I believe that the ever
[3:23:10] present God that these brothers preached
[3:23:14] has unlimited resources
[3:23:17] to deliver me from that
[3:23:21] sickness then I'd say the same thing you
[3:23:24] for you tonight if you know you're not
[3:23:27] saved and you know you don't have the
[3:23:30] Holy Ghost not I want more of God or I
[3:23:33] want to come up here and repent and say
[3:23:36] I'm sorry oh God I'm so sorry for
[3:23:38] everything I didn't know you want the
[3:23:41] everpresent
[3:23:43] god to come into your life life and
[3:23:47] change you amen and you think that if
[3:23:51] you were willing to make that
[3:23:55] step and come and ask the brothers to
[3:23:57] say would you pray for
[3:24:01] me but if you know there's a Holy
[3:24:04] Spirit and you know better then just go
[3:24:08] home and apply the
[3:24:14] token that's what you need to do you
[3:24:17] need to go apply the token get rid of
[3:24:20] the music get rid of the games get rid
[3:24:22] of this just go apply the token and the
[3:24:25] Holy Spirit will
[3:24:27] come that's not what I'm talking
[3:24:30] about we've deluded the real challenges
[3:24:34] down if you've got a
[3:24:37] devil and you know you have a
[3:24:40] Tormentor then God's church can deliver
[3:24:43] you from that torment amen if your
[3:24:45] backslid
[3:24:47] then read your Bible and pray
[3:24:50] fast and take care of that
[3:24:54] yourself but we've played
[3:24:57] Church we've covered it up with music
[3:25:00] and songs and everything and it's time
[3:25:03] that we come face to face with our own
[3:25:08] [Music]
[3:25:12] mirror so I hope there's not any anyone
[3:25:16] in here that has a physical
[3:25:21] Affliction but if you do I believe the
[3:25:25] men that have preached this gospel
[3:25:27] believe that God could heal
[3:25:30] you and I'd like to invite
[3:25:34] you to be prayed
[3:25:37] for if you know you need it if you don't
[3:25:42] Hallelujah I would rather have well
[3:25:45] people than S
[3:25:47] people if you've all got the Holy Ghost
[3:25:51] I would rather be dwelling with people
[3:25:52] that have the Holy Ghost than people
[3:25:55] that
[3:25:56] don't but you see the challenge of this
[3:25:59] word is we've got to start getting
[3:26:01] honest with
[3:26:05] ourselves we've got to start getting
[3:26:08] honest with our
[3:26:10] conditions and honest with our heart's
[3:26:13] desire I love what our brother said he
[3:26:16] says that power is within us have you
[3:26:20] tapped the
[3:26:22] life that's within you amen I pray
[3:26:26] tonight that you'll make a determination
[3:26:29] in your
[3:26:30] heart that you and the one and
[3:26:35] only
[3:26:37] powerful omnipotent God that we heard
[3:26:42] about that you enter into Fellowship
[3:26:49] that's all my heart's desire is that you
[3:26:52] know
[3:26:53] him in the fullest of his glory and
[3:26:57] that's what Peter said without faith
[3:27:00] it's impossible to please God for We
[3:27:03] must believe that he is how many believe
[3:27:06] he is and that he's
[3:27:10] here and that he's a
[3:27:13] rewarder of that them that diligently
[3:27:16] seek him when are we going to start
[3:27:19] grabbing our
[3:27:23] reward quit paying for your
[3:27:27] sins take everything he's
[3:27:30] got he loves you so very very very much
[3:27:37] brother Ron it's nice to have you would
[3:27:38] you come dismiss our service in prayer
[3:27:41] please
[3:27:48] take him with you he's
[3:27:56] here before brother Ron prays I just
[3:27:58] want to say that we have leftovers from
[3:28:01] the
[3:28:03] barbecue it's going to be put out for
[3:28:05] you we want our guest to go over and eat
[3:28:08] feet first and if you eat it all up then
[3:28:11] the Home Folks can go home but there's
[3:28:14] some leftover barbecue some left over
[3:28:16] sandwiches maybe some leftover desserts
[3:28:20] that's for that carnal man that's trying
[3:28:22] to kill you

[3:28:27] spiritual food that was delivered here
[3:28:29] tonight and know that you can
[3:28:33] live in the
[3:28:35] presence of the omnipresent God and
