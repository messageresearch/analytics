[17:16] i have to start looking to my right god
[17:18] bless you god bless you
[17:20] good morning you know it's um
[17:25] it's interesting as you look at the news
[17:27] you hear all the noise that's going on
[17:29] in the world it's
[17:32] you know first thing that pops into mind
[17:33] is all the division that's going on
[17:35] you know everybody dividing around
[17:37] certain things but
[17:39] you know what's interesting is we've
[17:40] been taught that that is
[17:42] we're actually living in a time of
[17:44] unifying
[17:45] a uniting time not a dividing time
[17:48] you know what's happening really is
[17:49] people are being
[17:51] unified into bundles and ultimately
[17:54] they're being unified against the word
[17:56] you know but there's another uniting
[17:59] going on
[18:00] which is what we're interested in here
[18:02] this morning so i've been thinking a lot
[18:04] about
[18:05] unity you know if you remember a few
[18:07] weeks ago we read psalm 86 where the
[18:09] scripture said that unite my heart to
[18:11] fear thy name
[18:13] what's interesting is that's also the
[18:14] opening scripture that brother branham
[18:16] uses
[18:17] when he preaches that sermon a uniting
[18:19] time and sign
[18:20] which is just a fabulous message i would
[18:23] encourage you all to
[18:25] listen to that or read that it couldn't
[18:27] be more appropriate
[18:29] to the day and the hour that we live in
[18:31] but you know i was looking thinking
[18:32] about
[18:33] unity and i was looking at psalm 133
[18:35] which we'll go ahead and read this
[18:37] morning
[18:38] and it says in verse 1 it says
[18:42] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[18:45] for brethren to dwell together
[18:48] in unity you know and that word unity is
[18:52] only really used three times in the
[18:53] scriptures
[18:55] this is one of those three times it's
[18:58] you know
[18:59] he describes this as uh what's
[19:01] interesting is when david's describing
[19:03] unity he attaches that
[19:04] to the oil in verse two that runs down
[19:08] aaron's beard you know and and in
[19:11] in ephesians 4 paul uses the word unity
[19:14] several times
[19:15] he says in verse 3 endeavoring to keep
[19:19] the unity of the spirit
[19:22] in the bond of peace so once again
[19:24] describing unity
[19:26] as an attribute or a characteristic of
[19:29] the spirit of god
[19:32] and then down in verse 13 he speaks of a
[19:34] time when
[19:35] we all come in the unity of the faith
[19:39] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[19:41] unto a perfect man
[19:43] unto the measure of the stature of the
[19:45] fullness of christ
[19:47] so the few times in the scripture when
[19:49] that word unity is used
[19:51] it's not around unity of knowledge or
[19:53] unity of belief
[19:54] or unity of you know cause or
[19:57] unity of doctrine but it's around the
[20:00] unity of the spirit
[20:02] and unity of the faith and there is no
[20:04] unity outside of that
[20:06] amen you know it's real i always like to
[20:09] look at webster to see how he describes
[20:11] a word and it's always amazing to me
[20:14] that the definitions
[20:15] that are used there unity is described
[20:18] as three things first
[20:20] the quality or state of not being
[20:23] multiple or
[20:24] oneness a condition of harmony
[20:29] or accord and the quality of state of
[20:33] being made one
[20:35] unification so you could have unity and
[20:38] oneness unity and accord all of them are
[20:40] the same thing in the scripture
[20:41] but there's one time in acts chapter 2
[20:44] where it says and when the day of
[20:45] pentecost was fully come they were all
[20:47] with one
[20:48] accord in one place and it's at that
[20:51] time that unity
[20:53] that the spirit of the lord was present
[20:56] the two
[20:57] are connected one to another with true
[21:00] unity the spirit of the lord
[21:02] and unity paul says it this way again in
[21:03] ephesians 4 he says there is one body
[21:06] one spirit even as you are called in one
[21:09] hope
[21:10] of your calling one lord one
[21:13] faith one baptism one god and father of
[21:18] all who is above all
[21:19] and through all and in you all unity
[21:23] our unity where everything comes
[21:25] together in him
[21:27] as paul says again in ephesians 1 that
[21:28] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[21:30] times
[21:32] he may gather together in one all things
[21:35] in christ both which are in heaven and
[21:38] which are in earth
[21:39] even in him if that isn't the definition
[21:41] of unity
[21:43] i don't know what is that's the only
[21:45] unity i could ever
[21:46] hope for not getting wrapped around a
[21:48] cause or wrapped around some other
[21:51] thing like knowledge or teaching but
[21:53] unity with him
[21:55] you know just a couple things that
[21:56] brother branham said in the uniting sign
[21:58] in time
[21:59] i just would like to go ahead and read
[22:00] then we'll go ahead and read psalm 133
[22:02] together he says now you see where we're
[22:04] living
[22:05] the uniting time when we see these
[22:06] things being united
[22:08] oh why we fail to see these things
[22:12] you can look in here in the scripture
[22:14] and see where that he promised that
[22:16] what he would do now we see it coming to
[22:19] pass
[22:20] we see in the church what he promised to
[22:22] do we see it coming to pass
[22:24] we see the nations coming together we
[22:26] see the isms uniting together we see the
[22:29] churches uniting together
[22:31] it's uniting time it's the hour of
[22:34] uniting that's the spirit of the age
[22:36] we've got to unite everything you talk
[22:39] about
[22:40] has got to be organized even the
[22:42] government won't receive it
[22:44] it's like you could be reading out of
[22:46] the newspaper from today right
[22:49] but in the but one thing he does say and
[22:51] the church and the bride and the word
[22:52] is becoming so one until the very word
[22:56] itself
[22:56] is working out the works of the
[22:58] bridegroom
[22:59] amen you see it i uniting not no more
[23:03] join the church not more of this but
[23:05] flee from
[23:06] everything and tied to jesus christ
[23:09] see it's the uniting time god uniting
[23:12] his bride
[23:12] together bringing it back just exactly
[23:16] uniting the words of his promise so it
[23:19] says in verse 1
[23:20] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[23:23] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[23:25] let's read that together just a very
[23:26] short psalm
[23:27] three verses
[23:31] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[23:34] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[23:37] it is like the precious ointment upon
[23:39] the head
[23:40] that ran down upon the beard even
[23:43] aaron's beard
[23:44] that went down to the skirts of his
[23:46] garments
[23:47] as the dew of hermann and as the dew
[23:50] that descended upon the mountains of
[23:52] zion
[23:52] for there the lord commanded the
[23:54] blessing even life
[23:56] forevermore amen
[24:00] amen praise the lord amen you may be
[24:02] seated key of f
[24:04] as the brothers come to take up the
[24:05] tithes and offerings we just pray a
[24:07] blessing upon those

[52:42] let's open uh first in matthew chapter
[52:45] 24
[52:46] a very familiar scripture reading we're
[52:48] going to read from verse 1.
[52:52] matthew 24 it says and jesus went on and
[52:55] departed from the temple and his
[52:57] disciple came to him
[52:59] for show him for to show him the
[53:02] building and the temp
[53:03] of the temple and jesus said unto them
[53:09] there's a lot of pages just flipping
[53:11] sorry i went too fast
[53:15] and jesus said unto them see not
[53:18] all these things verily i say unto you
[53:21] they shall not be
[53:23] left here or stoned upon another that
[53:26] shall not be
[53:27] thrown down and they sat upon the mount
[53:31] of olives and the disciple came unto him
[53:33] privately
[53:35] and saying tell us what shall these
[53:37] things be
[53:38] and what shall the sign of thy coming of
[53:42] the end of the world and jesus answered
[53:44] and said unto them
[53:46] take heed that no man deceive you for
[53:48] many shall come in my
[53:50] name saying i am christ and shall
[53:52] deceive many
[53:54] and and ye shall hear of wars and rumors
[53:58] of wars
[53:59] see see see see the eb not
[54:03] be trouble for all these things must
[54:05] come to pass
[54:06] but the end is not yet foundation shall
[54:09] rise against
[54:10] nation and kingdom against kingdom
[54:13] and there shall be famine and pestilence
[54:16] on the and on and the earthquakes and
[54:19] diverse places
[54:20] and all these things are the beginning
[54:23] of sorrows
[54:25] it says then shall they deliver
[54:28] ye thee up to be afflicted and shall
[54:30] kill you
[54:31] and ye shall be hated of all the nations
[54:34] for my name's sake
[54:36] and then shall many of many be offended
[54:40] and shall betray one another and they
[54:42] shall hate one another
[54:44] and many false prophets shall rise and
[54:46] fall
[54:47] false and shall rise
[54:50] and shall deceive many and because the
[54:53] iniquity
[54:54] abound in the love of many shall wax
[54:56] cold by ye
[54:58] that shall by he that shall endure unto
[55:00] the
[55:01] end the same shall be saved
[55:04] amen let's also open in luke's chapter
[55:07] eight we're going to read verse 1 to 15.
[55:12] luke chapter 8.
[55:23] first one to 15.
[55:26] satan he came to pass afterwards that
[55:29] he went through he went throughout every
[55:33] city and village preaching and
[55:35] showing the glad tiding of the kingdom
[55:38] and 12
[55:39] and 12 were with him and certain woman
[55:43] and a certain woman which has been
[55:45] healed of
[55:46] of evil spirit and infirmities
[55:49] mary called uh
[55:52] magdalene out of out of whom
[55:56] when seven devils and joanna
[55:59] the wife of khushar ohed steward
[56:03] and susana and many others which
[56:06] ministered unto him
[56:08] of their substance and it says and when
[56:12] much people were gathered together
[56:14] we came to we came to him out of every
[56:17] city he spake
[56:18] by a parable a soul went out to sow his
[56:21] seed
[56:22] and he sold some and and he says and
[56:24] some fell on the wayside
[56:26] and some fell on the some and andy was
[56:29] throwing
[56:30] down and and the flower of the air
[56:33] devoured it
[56:34] and some fell on up on the rock as as
[56:38] as the as soon as it was sprung up
[56:42] it withered away because of its life of
[56:45] the lack of moisture
[56:46] and some fell among the tones and the
[56:48] tones sprung up
[56:49] with it and choked it and others fell up
[56:52] on the ground
[56:53] and sprung up and bare fruits and a
[56:57] hundred fold
[56:58] and when he had said these things he
[57:00] cried
[57:02] he had he that has an ear let him hear
[57:05] his disciple asked him saying
[57:07] what it what might this parable be he
[57:10] said
[57:11] and he said unto unto it in giving them
[57:15] in in giving to know
[57:17] the mystery of the king and he said unto
[57:20] it unto you it is given to know the
[57:22] mystery of the kingdom of god but
[57:24] others it in the parable but not to
[57:28] others
[57:28] in the parable that seeing they might
[57:31] not see and hearing they might not
[57:32] understand
[57:34] now the parable is this the seed is the
[57:37] word of god
[57:38] those those by the way side
[57:42] are there that hear the word and come
[57:44] and come
[57:46] then cometh the devil and taketh away
[57:50] the word out of the heart lest they
[57:52] should believe
[57:53] and be saved they they on the rock
[57:58] are they which when they hear
[58:01] receive the word of god with joy
[58:05] and those have no roots which
[58:08] for a while believe in the time of
[58:10] temptation fall away
[58:13] that which fell upon the torns a day
[58:16] which
[58:16] when they hear when when they have heard
[58:20] go forth and choke and choke with the
[58:23] cares
[58:24] and reaches and pleasures of life and
[58:26] bring no fruits
[58:28] to perfection but
[58:31] but that one that on the on the good
[58:34] ground
[58:35] they which in a honest and good heart
[58:38] heard the word and keep it and it brings
[58:41] forth
[58:42] fruits with patience amen you may have
[58:44] your seats
[58:46] let's also turn to one more scripture
[58:48] reading in john chapter 12
[58:50] we're going to read from verse 20 to 24.
[58:54] john chapter 12 verse 20 to 24.
[58:59] and it says and there and there were
[59:01] certain greeks
[59:02] among them that came up to worship
[59:05] to worship at the feast and the same
[59:08] came therefore to philip which
[59:11] was of said
[59:14] bethesda of galilee and the desire him
[59:17] saying
[59:18] we would see jesus philip cometh and
[59:21] tell andrew
[59:22] and andrew andrew and philip tell jesus
[59:24] and jesus
[59:25] answered and said unto them the hour has
[59:28] come that the son of man must be
[59:30] glorified
[59:31] it said verily verily i say unto you
[59:34] except the corn of wheat fall
[59:36] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[59:41] but if it die it will bring forth much
[59:44] fruit
[59:46] just want to go back to that first
[59:49] parable
[59:50] we we we read in luke chapter 8
[59:54] and no doubt you know i begin to
[59:58] even look and identify some of the
[1:00:01] conditions
[1:00:02] with our own condition and just
[1:00:06] to give you i want to speak this morning
[1:00:08] it's just a very simple thought
[1:00:11] my title is the same life the same life
[1:00:16] and and and this is uh
[1:00:19] speaking uh with reference to a harvest
[1:00:23] time
[1:00:24] or the time of reaping so the same life
[1:00:27] and with reference to a time of reaping
[1:00:31] so we could see and and we know
[1:00:35] that as we read the scripture as we look
[1:00:38] in the bible
[1:00:39] we see that god has established patterns
[1:00:41] in the nature
[1:00:42] to teach us gaza has established
[1:00:45] uh he established laws and things
[1:00:49] in the nature that we can learn of we
[1:00:52] we speaking of the harvesting of the
[1:00:55] planting
[1:00:56] we can say this morning that you cannot
[1:00:58] sow
[1:00:59] oranges and expect to rip lemons
[1:01:02] you cannot sow mango and expect to rip
[1:01:05] apples or you you know you cannot go and
[1:01:08] and sow peaches and expect to
[1:01:10] rip bananas uh that would be very
[1:01:13] confusing
[1:01:14] uh but god has established it in a way
[1:01:16] that whatever seed was so
[1:01:19] the expectation of the harvest is the
[1:01:21] seed that was sown
[1:01:23] coming into maturity and and and and the
[1:01:26] seed that went into the ground
[1:01:28] is what's manifested in the fruit and so
[1:01:31] as jesus said here very
[1:01:32] rarely i said to you it's like the
[1:01:34] corner with fallen the ground they abide
[1:01:35] alone
[1:01:37] and dies is abide alone but if it dies
[1:01:39] it will bring forth much fruit
[1:01:41] so we begin to establish to to try to
[1:01:44] find out that you know
[1:01:45] that if if if there's going to be a
[1:01:48] harvest
[1:01:49] then god is going to have a seed
[1:01:52] that was planted is going to reap what
[1:01:54] he planted
[1:01:56] that god is going to have a harvest
[1:01:58] there's going to be a harvest is going
[1:02:00] to come and plant and
[1:02:02] and rip of that which he planted and
[1:02:04] also
[1:02:05] we are told you know even as brother
[1:02:07] mike mentioned it this morning
[1:02:09] you know i just been uh reading and
[1:02:11] listening to the message of harvest time
[1:02:14] and things that there's also a gathering
[1:02:16] together
[1:02:17] a binding together of the tares there's
[1:02:20] a binding together of the terrors that's
[1:02:22] going to happen the scripture speaks
[1:02:24] you know the the the master came and
[1:02:26] planted the seed and he said that then
[1:02:28] at night when everybody went to sleep
[1:02:30] that the enemy came into the field and
[1:02:33] he saw
[1:02:34] tares and then the next day or when the
[1:02:37] the two begin to to come up it says that
[1:02:40] the the workers came and told the
[1:02:42] masters
[1:02:43] you know we know that you planted the
[1:02:45] seed but we went in the field and we
[1:02:47] noticing that there are terrors
[1:02:49] everywhere it said that we don't know
[1:02:51] who planted it they said
[1:02:53] and the master said the enemy must have
[1:02:55] done this and then they said well should
[1:02:57] we go out
[1:02:58] and and unplug all the tears and
[1:03:00] everything it says
[1:03:01] no don't do it yet this is not the time
[1:03:04] but there will come a time where this is
[1:03:06] possible
[1:03:07] in other words at the younger age when
[1:03:10] the seed is still young
[1:03:11] at that young play age where it's just
[1:03:14] still coming up it's still just like a
[1:03:16] blade and
[1:03:17] we're still in that particular stage
[1:03:20] it's a very tender plant and you
[1:03:22] shouldn't disturb it
[1:03:24] you should leave it alone but he said
[1:03:26] there's going to come a time
[1:03:27] after the seed is mature after the seed
[1:03:30] is coming to the knowledge of what it is
[1:03:33] after the seed has recognized its
[1:03:35] position
[1:03:36] and what it was planted for after the
[1:03:38] seed is manifested and put forth of
[1:03:40] his fruit and it could be seen and he
[1:03:43] said when you come at that time and you
[1:03:45] remove the tear
[1:03:46] the seed will be able to handle it and i
[1:03:49] want to say this if you
[1:03:50] just to launch out from here the the
[1:03:52] word of god we live in the end time and
[1:03:55] barbara
[1:03:55] says this is the harvest time you know
[1:03:58] perhaps there's a time where
[1:04:00] you know uh uh people believers had a
[1:04:04] hard time and
[1:04:05] you know they couldn't take out this and
[1:04:08] you know the
[1:04:09] the one who didn't know really what the
[1:04:11] word is and when they're still at the
[1:04:12] younger age and
[1:04:14] it's hard for them to separate it's hard
[1:04:16] for them they have battle with this and
[1:04:18] they have battle with that and
[1:04:20] and they fight and all all all their
[1:04:23] life
[1:04:23] all they seem to do is fighting to find
[1:04:26] an identity
[1:04:27] but there comes a time where the seed
[1:04:29] has to come to maturity
[1:04:31] when it comes to maturity when the word
[1:04:34] comes forth
[1:04:35] when the word is spoken to it it's able
[1:04:37] to let the terror to fall
[1:04:39] it's able to remove the tear off of it
[1:04:41] why because it's been strengthened by
[1:04:43] the word of god
[1:04:44] it's received something and it's grown
[1:04:47] into strength
[1:04:48] and he has the ability has come to a
[1:04:51] place where parabanum says that
[1:04:52] the church will come to such a place
[1:04:55] where they'll be able to discern the two
[1:04:57] spirits within the framework of the
[1:04:58] church
[1:04:59] where they'll be able to accept the holy
[1:05:01] spirit
[1:05:02] and to withstand the devil spirit
[1:05:06] and and that's where we are tonight
[1:05:08] that's where we are this morning we have
[1:05:10] to have come to a place and
[1:05:12] where the word says when where even when
[1:05:15] instruction goes forth and
[1:05:16] when we are corrected by the word the
[1:05:19] word inside of your heart
[1:05:21] has to have been mature to the place
[1:05:23] where you can stand that
[1:05:25] to a place where you can say i receive
[1:05:27] it if the word says don't do this i
[1:05:29] won't do that
[1:05:30] if the word said don't go here i won't
[1:05:32] go there why because i
[1:05:34] am a mature believer i have received the
[1:05:37] word i've been feeding on the word
[1:05:39] i've been receiving the word i've been
[1:05:41] staying on the word
[1:05:43] god is backing all the green out of me
[1:05:45] and i'm in such a place where
[1:05:47] what the father desire is what i desire
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:51] this is not the time for struggling or
[1:05:54] or trying to figure out do i really want
[1:05:56] to serve god or do i
[1:05:58] this is the end time my brother my
[1:06:00] sister this is the harvest time
[1:06:02] there is no more time this could end at
[1:06:05] any time
[1:06:06] we we not promise that there's going to
[1:06:08] be a tomorrow and then another day
[1:06:10] another day
[1:06:10] the scripture says today when you hear
[1:06:13] his voice harden out your heart
[1:06:15] this is the last calling this is the
[1:06:18] last time
[1:06:19] that this world and i want to just be
[1:06:21] specific the world
[1:06:23] as a cosmos this is the last time it
[1:06:26] will hear the gospel of jesus christ
[1:06:28] this is it this is after this there's
[1:06:31] not another
[1:06:32] age there's not another coming there's
[1:06:34] not another something coming
[1:06:36] you are the last manifestation on the
[1:06:39] planet
[1:06:40] of the word of god if god is intending
[1:06:43] to do
[1:06:43] anything he will do it by the people
[1:06:45] that are presently on the earth
[1:06:47] right now receiving his word
[1:06:51] so the word now the scripture says in
[1:06:53] isaiah 8 and 7 it says
[1:06:56] the day that i saw in the wind they
[1:06:57] shall reap the whirlwind
[1:07:00] and so we we this brings us to a place
[1:07:03] where we have to realize it says
[1:07:05] that it's it was god's law that
[1:07:08] everything will bring forth
[1:07:09] after its kind that it would bring the
[1:07:13] and the purpose is for the likeness to
[1:07:15] be manifested
[1:07:17] and and you know i could just drop back
[1:07:18] to what we spoke last time
[1:07:20] uh you know the the holy spirit the
[1:07:23] brooding on the seed
[1:07:25] was so that the image of the the one who
[1:07:28] was doing the brooding
[1:07:29] will come into full manifestation and
[1:07:31] and and it was
[1:07:33] nothing else the full maturity is when
[1:07:36] the one who's doing the brooding he's
[1:07:38] looking at his seed
[1:07:39] and he's seeing himself
[1:07:42] so and so we find out it has to come to
[1:07:46] that place
[1:07:47] the seed has to move and get to that
[1:07:49] place
[1:07:50] where it's manifesting the exact seed
[1:07:53] that went into the ground
[1:07:54] where you can look at the fruits and
[1:07:56] recognize what seed is planted
[1:07:59] so prophetic says that genesis is the
[1:08:02] seed chapter he he he specifically
[1:08:06] speaks about
[1:08:07] that every seed that was to be planted
[1:08:11] every seed that was to be manifested or
[1:08:14] be brought into harvest
[1:08:15] had to be planted in genesis it says
[1:08:19] every place you look at the book of
[1:08:22] genesis
[1:08:23] it speaks it says last evening we had
[1:08:25] been speaking about the two
[1:08:27] uh that last two evening about genesis
[1:08:29] the chapter
[1:08:30] he says where god planted his seed and
[1:08:33] satan planted his seed it said
[1:08:36] that that and the balls are growing
[1:08:39] together
[1:08:40] and it says and ever since it's soon
[1:08:43] it shouldn't be the harvest time whether
[1:08:45] harvest will be
[1:08:46] ripped whether whether harvest will be
[1:08:49] ripped but
[1:08:50] but we just have to to if we just have
[1:08:52] to be two or three weeks
[1:08:54] of good revival that was gonna come uh
[1:08:57] here to go into some of these things so
[1:08:59] now he's speaking here
[1:09:01] saying that those seed had to be planted
[1:09:03] and it's gonna come a time
[1:09:05] where the harvest will be manifested so
[1:09:07] i was looking
[1:09:08] at this so it's important now you begin
[1:09:11] to realize
[1:09:12] this book of genesis everything well
[1:09:15] in regards to predestination was spoken
[1:09:19] into here
[1:09:20] everything in regards to what the seed
[1:09:23] was capable
[1:09:24] or not capable of doing was spoken here
[1:09:27] every plant what it was going to bring
[1:09:29] its ability
[1:09:32] the lack of ability everything that he
[1:09:34] should or should not do
[1:09:35] was spoken in here so and then when god
[1:09:39] said let her be
[1:09:40] god was only calling for what the seed
[1:09:44] that he predestinated on to bring forth
[1:09:47] what he planned for it to bring
[1:09:50] in other words god couldn't look at the
[1:09:52] the mango seed and call it to bring
[1:09:54] apple that will be against his own word
[1:09:58] that would be against his own plan that
[1:10:00] will be against his own
[1:10:01] thinking when he said when he planted
[1:10:04] that seed
[1:10:05] and he qualifies that seed as an apple
[1:10:07] seed
[1:10:08] when the word went forth and said let
[1:10:10] her be such
[1:10:12] that qualification brought that fruit to
[1:10:14] bring forth
[1:10:15] everything that god intended for it to
[1:10:17] bring
[1:10:19] and and and it was that way so when he
[1:10:22] called forth
[1:10:23] and and the reason and the only thing
[1:10:25] that could respond to the call
[1:10:27] was the seed that god planted
[1:10:32] god was not calling for the devil's seed
[1:10:34] as the prophet said that the devil
[1:10:36] planted his seed
[1:10:37] yes he planted it but what god said let
[1:10:40] her be
[1:10:41] it was only calling for the seed that he
[1:10:43] planted
[1:10:44] and i tell you my brother my sister the
[1:10:46] rapture is not for those
[1:10:48] that god didn't plant on this earth the
[1:10:51] rapture is not for the world
[1:10:53] the rapture is for a selected group of
[1:10:56] people
[1:10:56] that god planted here in the evening
[1:10:59] time
[1:11:00] that when the word will go forth those
[1:11:02] will receive it
[1:11:04] and those will believe it and those will
[1:11:06] manifest it
[1:11:07] and those will be taken out of here god
[1:11:10] is not a god of confusion
[1:11:12] we we can't battle within ourselves oh i
[1:11:15] just want to make it
[1:11:16] you're going to make it because god
[1:11:18] spoke that you're going to make it
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:22] we we we don't battle the world in a
[1:11:25] sense where
[1:11:26] oh i if i can do this i'll become the
[1:11:28] seed
[1:11:29] no you are already the seed the the
[1:11:32] battle within your heart
[1:11:34] is for you to give of your own self is
[1:11:37] for you to die
[1:11:38] accept the grain of wheat goes into the
[1:11:41] ground
[1:11:42] and dies then he abides alone but when
[1:11:46] if he dies it will bring forth much
[1:11:48] fruit
[1:11:49] the only way to bring food is to die the
[1:11:52] only way to bring the harvest
[1:11:54] is for the plant to go down to die and
[1:11:57] then it will bring forth the fruit
[1:11:59] so then god knew we can say this then
[1:12:02] god knew
[1:12:04] the seed that he planted and he knew in
[1:12:06] which generation
[1:12:08] he was going to call the harvest so god
[1:12:10] knew what harvest will come in the first
[1:12:12] church age
[1:12:13] he knew what harvest he will have on the
[1:12:15] second church age
[1:12:16] he knew not necessarily the harvest but
[1:12:19] it will know
[1:12:20] you will know the state or the condition
[1:12:22] of the seed that he had planted in all
[1:12:24] those ages
[1:12:25] because we can look at this as the the
[1:12:28] bride tree we could say
[1:12:30] it started off when god planted it and
[1:12:32] it was moving forward
[1:12:33] so we find out that devil saw a seed and
[1:12:36] god so is he
[1:12:37] and the prophet speaks to us and he
[1:12:40] tells us
[1:12:40] that it was always the two spirits
[1:12:43] manifesting themselves
[1:12:45] since the beginning when abel was here
[1:12:48] kane was here
[1:12:50] when when esau was he was jacob was
[1:12:53] there eso was here
[1:12:54] when moses was there janice and chambers
[1:12:57] were here
[1:12:58] when jesus was here judas was here so it
[1:13:00] was always the two
[1:13:02] and and the prophet now speaks now it's
[1:13:05] not
[1:13:05] i want you to realize this he's not
[1:13:08] attributing this
[1:13:09] other seed as just the complete
[1:13:12] worldliness
[1:13:13] but is in fact calling them that they
[1:13:16] are
[1:13:17] within the framework of the church
[1:13:21] i want you not to see where it's leading
[1:13:23] the it's leading us
[1:13:25] he's not saying well this is the world
[1:13:27] they're much of unbeliever and
[1:13:28] everything no he's saying
[1:13:30] this is this two spirits are within the
[1:13:32] framework of the church
[1:13:34] and it qualifies it by saying one is an
[1:13:37] intellectual the other is by revelation
[1:13:40] or by the spirit of god
[1:13:42] so therefore brother and sister that's
[1:13:44] why we have to be careful i tell you
[1:13:46] this
[1:13:46] the nature of the seed is to always grow
[1:13:50] forth
[1:13:51] the seed never stops to grow the moment
[1:13:54] the seed stops
[1:13:55] life is gone out of it
[1:13:59] the the seed is always calling i was
[1:14:03] thinking about what what i'm talking
[1:14:04] about
[1:14:05] uh the reverend lily said yeah he is in
[1:14:07] the muck in the mud
[1:14:09] in the pond and in the very depths and
[1:14:12] covered by all kinds of stuffing
[1:14:14] and everything but he said within the
[1:14:16] bottom where he cannot even see the sun
[1:14:20] there is something within a seed that
[1:14:22] the sun is calling
[1:14:24] an invisible calling not something that
[1:14:26] you can see or apprehend with your eyes
[1:14:28] and also
[1:14:29] an invisible calling that's happening
[1:14:32] and as the sun is calling
[1:14:33] the the line is pushing the lid is
[1:14:36] pushing the lid
[1:14:37] is pushing the lid is pushing why
[1:14:39] because the sun is calling
[1:14:41] and it's coming into a full
[1:14:42] manifestation why because
[1:14:44] it's been called and if we are being
[1:14:48] called this morning
[1:14:49] there has to be a struggle within our
[1:14:51] lives within our hearts
[1:14:53] that wants to see god today that wants
[1:14:56] to see god tomorrow
[1:14:57] that's not satisfied with this it's not
[1:14:59] satisfied with this other condition
[1:15:01] why because something is calling and i
[1:15:04] have to respond to that call
[1:15:08] but i'm says this it says he speaks
[1:15:11] about being a topologist that says
[1:15:13] i'm a topologist and i like the types
[1:15:15] and the shadows
[1:15:16] because if i know what the shadow looks
[1:15:18] like
[1:15:19] then if i have some conception of
[1:15:22] and then he says then i have some
[1:15:24] conception of what the reality looks
[1:15:26] like
[1:15:28] it says so without an education i had to
[1:15:31] go
[1:15:32] to the shadows the old testament to see
[1:15:35] what
[1:15:35] to see it foreshadowed the new and
[1:15:38] everything in the old testament speaks
[1:15:40] to calvary everything you are completed
[1:15:44] in christ you are not saved because you
[1:15:47] are you've packed the crucifix you are
[1:15:49] not safe because
[1:15:51] you go to church you are not safe
[1:15:53] because you know
[1:15:54] your your your
[1:15:58] your catechism or your textbook
[1:16:01] you are not safe because you know the
[1:16:03] bible
[1:16:05] now i want you to see where it's taking
[1:16:07] this you are saved
[1:16:09] because you know the person jesus christ
[1:16:13] to know him is life not even to know his
[1:16:17] word
[1:16:18] is life but to know him the person
[1:16:21] is life there's only one way to know him
[1:16:24] and that's to be born again of the
[1:16:27] spirit
[1:16:27] of god and i want to say this
[1:16:30] the world out there is moving into the
[1:16:34] condition that it is
[1:16:36] because there is something within their
[1:16:38] heart that's calling for the things that
[1:16:40] they're manifesting
[1:16:41] and i want to say this most of them they
[1:16:44] can't even help it
[1:16:46] they're just being moved into a
[1:16:48] condition oh they don't like this they
[1:16:50] move into it they don't like this they
[1:16:51] move
[1:16:52] they don't know that they're being
[1:16:53] brought together into the fulfillment of
[1:16:56] the prophecy
[1:16:57] of the end time condition and i want to
[1:17:00] say this if they're moving like that
[1:17:02] with no knowledge of the scripture or
[1:17:04] for anything
[1:17:05] how much more we this morning we have to
[1:17:08] understand that when we see that
[1:17:10] condition out there
[1:17:11] that we by the word of god by the
[1:17:13] revelation that we have received
[1:17:15] we need to be moved into another
[1:17:18] condition
[1:17:20] we can't stay where we are we cannot
[1:17:23] just be satisfied with what we see
[1:17:25] we cannot this message was not sent for
[1:17:28] us to gather this morning and say
[1:17:30] that god sent a prophet god sent and he
[1:17:33] did miracle when the prophet was here
[1:17:35] and yet we are we have within our midst
[1:17:37] people that need healing
[1:17:38] that need to be saved and all those
[1:17:40] things the reason why god sent the
[1:17:42] prophet
[1:17:43] was so we can recognize who he was but
[1:17:46] in recognizing him
[1:17:47] that the same god will move this morning
[1:17:50] and fulfill the word for the things that
[1:17:53] he has promised for this hour
[1:17:57] god didn't allocate his word or his
[1:17:59] power
[1:18:00] and say that i will extend my power but
[1:18:03] it will only stop at william branham
[1:18:05] the the scripture tells us that the
[1:18:07] power was given to the church
[1:18:10] to them that believe he has given them
[1:18:12] power
[1:18:13] to become sons and daughters and last
[1:18:15] week we read how he says
[1:18:17] that everything that was in christ
[1:18:19] everything
[1:18:20] that god took that and he poured into
[1:18:22] christ for what to continue his work
[1:18:25] the life is known by its manifestation
[1:18:28] a life can only be told by what it looks
[1:18:31] like
[1:18:32] a life can be told only when we see its
[1:18:34] action
[1:18:35] that's when we know what kind of life it
[1:18:38] is
[1:18:40] he speaks and he says
[1:18:44] he says he says that's been born
[1:18:47] again with the spirit of god and so
[1:18:51] and then he tells us again that we live
[1:18:54] in one of the most intellectual age
[1:18:58] where you you look at the church
[1:19:00] condition and what they fail
[1:19:02] is because everything was taken
[1:19:05] and received with intellect the the that
[1:19:09] wanted god to move only according to
[1:19:11] their understanding
[1:19:12] they wanted to see things only operates
[1:19:14] within the understanding of the mind
[1:19:17] in other words by setting up those
[1:19:18] things they stopped the move of god but
[1:19:21] when i'm saying they set up camp
[1:19:23] and the spirit to move away from them
[1:19:25] and yet they remain on the camp
[1:19:28] that's why we have the methodist camp
[1:19:30] the baptist camp and all this camp
[1:19:31] and we want to be careful that as an
[1:19:33] individual we don't set up camps
[1:19:36] we want to make sure that as individual
[1:19:38] we move with the word of god
[1:19:40] the first church was moved by the word
[1:19:42] of god it was a bunch of people where
[1:19:44] god told them
[1:19:45] go here he picked up and he went why
[1:19:48] because the spirit spoke to him to do
[1:19:50] that
[1:19:51] and that god has never changed it's the
[1:19:53] same today
[1:19:54] he moved upon the prophet he told him
[1:19:56] where to go and where not to go
[1:19:58] and that same god can do the same thing
[1:20:00] this morning
[1:20:01] and today if we will yield to him
[1:20:08] we can't hide behind the word and say
[1:20:11] well i believe the word
[1:20:12] i believe the word with no spirit moving
[1:20:15] at all
[1:20:16] the spirit is sent to move upon the word
[1:20:19] and take the word and make it life
[1:20:24] we say we believe the word but yet the
[1:20:26] actions are not matching what the word
[1:20:28] says
[1:20:29] we say we believe the word but yet what
[1:20:31] we bring what we come into
[1:20:33] is not what the world is calling us to
[1:20:37] so we find out that that it it
[1:20:40] it's such a an intellectual age
[1:20:44] you look at men's invention but but
[1:20:47] randy spoke the other day about
[1:20:49] you know how they they're coming from
[1:20:51] the airplanes and
[1:20:52] and the horse and buggy and how they
[1:20:54] move forward to the airplanes
[1:20:56] all the way up to the arsenal you look
[1:20:59] at
[1:20:59] science cars that drive themselves you
[1:21:02] can just sit in there and enjoy
[1:21:04] you can get any kind of bed you wanted
[1:21:06] that will memorize how you want to sleep
[1:21:08] and just set everything up
[1:21:10] and touch you exactly where you want to
[1:21:11] be touched and everything and set up the
[1:21:13] right temperature for you
[1:21:15] we have all kinds of things but yet
[1:21:17] within our condition
[1:21:19] we have this is the most confusing time
[1:21:21] that's ever been on the planet
[1:21:24] we have all kinds of doctors all kinds
[1:21:26] of things but yet this is the sickest
[1:21:28] time that we've ever seen
[1:21:30] all kinds of diseases that men have no
[1:21:32] idea
[1:21:33] so how can they progress so much on one
[1:21:35] hand and then go
[1:21:37] so down on the other why it's meeting
[1:21:39] the condition
[1:21:40] of what's promised at this time
[1:21:44] and so therefore when that's happening
[1:21:47] there has to be a people
[1:21:49] coming into a life i'm not talking about
[1:21:52] a preaching role
[1:21:53] an understanding of a set of mind no i'm
[1:21:57] talking about a life
[1:21:59] because we're not interested in just
[1:22:00] preaching i can preach here we can enjoy
[1:22:03] and all of that that's wonderful and the
[1:22:06] devil will not do anything
[1:22:08] but if somebody can stand up this
[1:22:10] morning and
[1:22:11] move into that word and take it and
[1:22:14] manifest it
[1:22:15] that's what causes trouble
[1:22:18] the devil is not moved by our intellect
[1:22:20] or ability to quote quotes and
[1:22:22] scriptures
[1:22:23] the what the devil is afraid of is men
[1:22:25] and women
[1:22:26] that can manifest the christ of this
[1:22:28] hour that can manifest the word of god
[1:22:31] promised for this time
[1:22:32] and that's the kind of people we want to
[1:22:34] be
[1:22:37] so and then we read this last time it
[1:22:40] says
[1:22:41] this so the same life will produce the
[1:22:44] same fruit
[1:22:45] and we wear this last time so if the
[1:22:48] life
[1:22:49] if the life that's in us is the life of
[1:22:51] christ
[1:22:52] it will produce christ now
[1:22:55] and this just came to me and and i hope
[1:22:58] you know i can bring it out that's the
[1:23:00] way i see it
[1:23:01] now i i don't believe this is
[1:23:04] a condemnation this is a promise
[1:23:09] this is not condemnation this is a
[1:23:11] promise
[1:23:12] and why this is a promise i'm speaking
[1:23:15] about harvest time
[1:23:17] during the harvest before the harvest
[1:23:19] can come
[1:23:20] there's just a little seed there but if
[1:23:23] adam says the stage is as it speaks
[1:23:25] about the stages of the seed
[1:23:26] there's a time where all the seed is
[1:23:29] just a blade
[1:23:31] and if you can come to the blade and say
[1:23:34] oh this is a tomato tree
[1:23:36] a person will look at you and say you're
[1:23:38] crazy
[1:23:39] it doesn't look anything like it it
[1:23:42] moves into
[1:23:43] from the sea but from the blade it will
[1:23:45] move into a tassel
[1:23:47] what lacking the very identification of
[1:23:50] what a tomato tree looks like
[1:23:52] or what an apple tree looks like anyway
[1:23:55] but yet
[1:23:55] it's the seed
[1:23:58] yet it's the seed so therefore we don't
[1:24:01] judge one another
[1:24:03] just because you see somebody the way
[1:24:05] they dress and everything
[1:24:06] then you attribute them yes they are
[1:24:08] christian they know no no no no no
[1:24:10] what you want to know is is there
[1:24:12] something in there
[1:24:13] is there a desire inside there that's
[1:24:16] looking for the manifestation
[1:24:19] of what's been placed inside because it
[1:24:22] can go through all kinds of stuff
[1:24:24] that's why when we look at and i'll say
[1:24:26] this oftentimes the devil takes the sons
[1:24:28] of god
[1:24:29] and he dresses them in all kinds of
[1:24:31] worldliness
[1:24:32] one that if you're not careful you'll
[1:24:34] look in the world and say there's no way
[1:24:36] god can save that
[1:24:40] oftentimes we miss the program of god
[1:24:42] because we let our mind go first
[1:24:45] i tell you god will take the most
[1:24:47] fanatic worldly person
[1:24:49] and those are the ones most of the time
[1:24:51] that go to god
[1:24:53] why because there's something that the
[1:24:54] devil is trying to hide behind there
[1:25:00] what we're interested in is something
[1:25:02] within the heart of a person
[1:25:04] that wants to move to justification that
[1:25:07] wants to go through sanctification
[1:25:09] that wants to move into the baptism of
[1:25:11] the holy spirit
[1:25:12] that want to have the love of god shed
[1:25:14] within the heart
[1:25:16] that's the progression that we are going
[1:25:18] into we're now
[1:25:19] going backwards and the scripture says
[1:25:22] that
[1:25:23] these signs shall follow them that
[1:25:25] believe
[1:25:26] so it begins with the belief i believe
[1:25:28] with all my heart i heard that word
[1:25:30] something touched within my heart you
[1:25:32] may have absolutely
[1:25:34] no criteria no display of any
[1:25:37] spirituality
[1:25:39] but within your heart god is starting a
[1:25:41] work
[1:25:48] so that's why it's so important that we
[1:25:51] recognize that
[1:25:53] i was i was thinking about just this
[1:25:56] life
[1:25:57] the life because i believe it's every
[1:26:00] christian's desire
[1:26:02] to see that life come to manifest it
[1:26:05] and why the life you know
[1:26:08] lately with all this covert 19 stuff
[1:26:10] going on
[1:26:11] you know i i was reading just got
[1:26:14] interested in what they call
[1:26:16] uh plasma therapy and we know that you
[1:26:19] know as
[1:26:19] even from the scripture i just don't
[1:26:22] think i have time probably we to
[1:26:23] read all of them but brahmana tells us
[1:26:25] that the life is in the blood
[1:26:27] the life is in the blood life is in the
[1:26:30] blood so
[1:26:31] so i just began to look so basically
[1:26:33] what they call the plasma therapy the
[1:26:36] plasma therapy is used
[1:26:38] for people what they do is they've take
[1:26:41] the life or the blood of the people
[1:26:43] who have recovered from certain
[1:26:45] illnesses
[1:26:47] and they take that blood from that blood
[1:26:50] they're able to inject it to a sick
[1:26:52] person and this
[1:26:53] and those things contaminate the person
[1:26:56] who's sick
[1:26:57] and he received this antibodies that
[1:26:59] came from this other person
[1:27:01] and he's able to fight the disease i
[1:27:03] thought about the blood of jesus this
[1:27:05] morning
[1:27:06] i thought about the blood that's been
[1:27:08] made available to the church
[1:27:10] i tell you we are not overcomers because
[1:27:12] we overcame
[1:27:13] we are overcame because the blood the
[1:27:15] life that we have received
[1:27:17] there's a blood that came by the word of
[1:27:19] god there's something that's a power
[1:27:22] that came by the word of god
[1:27:24] there's something we have received a
[1:27:26] plasma from the father
[1:27:28] that came into your sick body that came
[1:27:30] into your sin body
[1:27:32] and when you receive it it brought
[1:27:34] deliverance to you
[1:27:37] and i tell you this morning if the blood
[1:27:40] brought you deliverance
[1:27:42] if the blood brought you salvation hang
[1:27:44] on to it
[1:27:45] it's going to continue that's not the
[1:27:47] end of it
[1:27:48] the sun is coming it's going to keep
[1:27:50] going it's going to keep going
[1:27:52] it's going to keep going until it
[1:27:54] manifests at the very rapture that he's
[1:27:56] looking for
[1:28:00] the treatment we have received that's
[1:28:02] what the prophet told us
[1:28:04] we didn't get and get some antibiotics
[1:28:06] shot or
[1:28:07] some malaria tablets or something we
[1:28:10] have received the plasma of god
[1:28:13] the blood of jesus christ to wash us for
[1:28:16] a moment uncleanness
[1:28:17] to make us whole he says the blood is
[1:28:20] the bleach
[1:28:21] why what does the bleach do but i'm
[1:28:22] going to explain it says
[1:28:24] you take something you take off you take
[1:28:26] a a blue color or something
[1:28:29] it's a composition of molecule
[1:28:32] he goes down into just chemistry again
[1:28:35] well you know
[1:28:36] perhaps it's c2 and 4 5
[1:28:39] and this and this but he said when you
[1:28:41] drop it in there
[1:28:43] it tears all of that apart and
[1:28:46] brings it back to its original and it
[1:28:49] disappears
[1:28:50] so it's the composition that makes the
[1:28:52] color it breaks away the composition
[1:28:56] so this blood when you dip your sin into
[1:28:59] it
[1:28:59] it takes whatever composition of that
[1:29:01] sin is when it's dropped in this blood
[1:29:04] it breaks away the composition
[1:29:07] it's the most powerful thing that there
[1:29:09] is on the earth
[1:29:11] oh i tell you if the world could use of
[1:29:13] this remedy it will not be in the shape
[1:29:15] that it is today
[1:29:19] so he speaks in the message to talk and
[1:29:21] he says
[1:29:22] but prove i i'll just just try to
[1:29:26] summarize so i can move forward
[1:29:27] he says but but he says but prove
[1:29:30] that the man is in the image of his
[1:29:33] creator
[1:29:34] therefore that man that man when an
[1:29:37] animal died
[1:29:38] and the blood was broken the cell was
[1:29:41] was was broken
[1:29:43] it says the life the life
[1:29:46] the life is in the blood cell when when
[1:29:49] the blood cell was broken
[1:29:51] the blood broke up it says the worshiper
[1:29:54] had to take the chemistry of
[1:29:56] the blood and put it upon the door
[1:30:00] so it could it could be seen with a
[1:30:02] literal
[1:30:03] eyes because the life was in the animal
[1:30:06] was in the because the life that was in
[1:30:08] the animal could not come back upon the
[1:30:11] man
[1:30:12] not having a soul therefore it's
[1:30:15] it would only mix it would only it
[1:30:18] wouldn't mix with the soul of a man
[1:30:20] an animal life won't come back upon the
[1:30:22] human being
[1:30:24] it continues on he says now our
[1:30:26] sacrifice today
[1:30:28] not only an ordinary human being
[1:30:31] but it was god himself that was
[1:30:34] identified in flesh here
[1:30:36] upon the earth when the blood cell broke
[1:30:39] not only did the soul of man did the
[1:30:42] soul of men or the spirit of man
[1:30:45] but god himself who was identified in
[1:30:48] the man
[1:30:49] returned back upon the believer
[1:30:52] that's the promise we have so if you're
[1:30:55] not
[1:30:56] manifesting not yet you keep pressing in
[1:30:58] that direction
[1:31:00] you keep looking in that direction time
[1:31:03] is no more we don't have time
[1:31:06] we don't have time to play churches we
[1:31:08] don't have time to just come and gather
[1:31:10] we don't know what's happening the world
[1:31:12] don't know what's happening next
[1:31:17] so so it says the blood he returned back
[1:31:21] upon the believer
[1:31:22] in the baptism of the holy spirit that's
[1:31:24] the talking that god requires today
[1:31:27] the token of today that we have to have
[1:31:30] must be the holy spirit that's required
[1:31:33] the talking
[1:31:34] with we've approved it says we'll prove
[1:31:36] it
[1:31:37] to you by the scripture without the holy
[1:31:40] ghost you do not
[1:31:41] display the token
[1:31:45] without the holy spirit you can't have
[1:31:46] the token all you're gonna have
[1:31:49] is intellect and self-will
[1:31:54] and for anybody here that's been living
[1:31:58] on earth for more than 40 years
[1:32:00] you realize that self-will will run out
[1:32:05] when you're young you still feel strong
[1:32:07] you feel like you can do it you can do
[1:32:09] it
[1:32:10] but there comes a point where you need
[1:32:11] help when you begin to realize that
[1:32:14] i cannot do it on my own i need somebody
[1:32:16] to help me
[1:32:18] i cannot understand this i need somebody
[1:32:20] to help me
[1:32:21] praise god there's somebody here this
[1:32:23] morning to help you
[1:32:24] praise god there is a spirit here
[1:32:26] willing and looking
[1:32:28] for those for those who are waiting for
[1:32:30] his appearing
[1:32:31] for those who are wanting to press into
[1:32:33] this kingdom god is making it available
[1:32:36] this morning
[1:32:38] so it says the the scripture without the
[1:32:41] spirit you do not display
[1:32:43] therefore it shows um it shows that
[1:32:46] that that you you have the and then you
[1:32:48] you identify yourself with the sacrifice
[1:32:51] god has sent you back to the they send
[1:32:53] you back the token
[1:32:54] to show that you've accepted it until
[1:32:57] that's done
[1:32:58] no matter how good you are know how much
[1:33:01] you know or how um
[1:33:04] how a college prophet or a good person
[1:33:07] teacher whatever
[1:33:08] it might be you are absolutely not
[1:33:11] recognized
[1:33:11] until the token shows until the talking
[1:33:15] so now if i could just bring it back
[1:33:19] uh to what we want to say this morning
[1:33:22] when
[1:33:22] when when we speak of a life
[1:33:26] when we say a life i i just
[1:33:29] got this definition i thought it would
[1:33:31] probably help me just summarize what i'm
[1:33:33] trying to say
[1:33:35] so a life is the sum of a sum of
[1:33:38] distinguishing phenomena
[1:33:40] or organism especially it speaks about
[1:33:43] metabolism or growth
[1:33:45] or reproduction or adapt adaptation of
[1:33:49] environment of
[1:33:50] environment so a life you know
[1:33:53] it's something that expresses uh it's a
[1:33:56] combination of things that expresses
[1:33:58] something
[1:33:59] a a life of something life is just not
[1:34:02] breathing
[1:34:04] it's just not breathing and eating it's
[1:34:06] a combination of things
[1:34:07] uh a life of something shows it's known
[1:34:11] by its characteristics
[1:34:13] so the life is a combination of things
[1:34:15] and and
[1:34:16] and as he says here it's distinguished
[1:34:19] uh uh a a life of one is different from
[1:34:22] another
[1:34:23] we're living but we are known by
[1:34:24] differently the life of human is not the
[1:34:27] same after life and animal
[1:34:28] they're both alive but it's different
[1:34:30] lives as the prophet
[1:34:32] said you couldn't take an animal and put
[1:34:33] it upon the man so
[1:34:35] it was different so barbara says this
[1:34:37] this morning it says
[1:34:38] in the message unconditional covenant he
[1:34:40] says listen
[1:34:41] you are the covenant people of god
[1:34:44] god tore christ apart at calvary
[1:34:50] making the covenant swearing by himself
[1:34:53] he took the body upon up into heaven
[1:34:57] which will return someday but the spirit
[1:35:00] he gave it back
[1:35:01] to lead the church
[1:35:04] the same life that was in christ jesus
[1:35:08] in the church tonight by the holy spirit
[1:35:12] doing and acting and performing the same
[1:35:14] thing that he did
[1:35:15] when he was here on earth you are
[1:35:17] receiving it
[1:35:19] he says you've got the covenant it's
[1:35:21] written
[1:35:22] to you so by god you can fail
[1:35:26] to make the devil mad sure sure that
[1:35:29] he says you can't fail that makes the
[1:35:31] devil mad shoot us
[1:35:32] when you realize who you are so yeah yes
[1:35:36] the prophet
[1:35:36] is setting it up in a way to to make
[1:35:40] sure that we
[1:35:40] understand that this covenant and this
[1:35:43] life
[1:35:44] has been given to the church it's made
[1:35:47] mad available for the church
[1:35:49] it's been given to you god swore by
[1:35:51] himself
[1:35:52] he'd done all that he could and this
[1:35:54] morning what he wants us to do
[1:35:56] is to receive it it's to believe it it's
[1:35:59] to seek for it it's to want to see the
[1:36:01] manifestations of it
[1:36:05] or just skip some here it says
[1:36:08] but it says now if you are if you are
[1:36:11] if you are believing right if you just
[1:36:14] confess it from your lips
[1:36:17] don't die don't do much it won't do much
[1:36:21] good
[1:36:22] but from your heart if you believe that
[1:36:25] jesus christ is the son of god
[1:36:27] you can't live the same life you once
[1:36:31] but
[1:36:31] you once lived if you believe
[1:36:34] with all your heart that jesus jesus
[1:36:36] christ is god
[1:36:38] he's saying that there's absolutely no
[1:36:40] way you can live the same life you lived
[1:36:42] before
[1:36:43] you can't you have he says
[1:36:46] if you have ever get the true view of
[1:36:50] calvary
[1:36:51] now if you are just taking the the
[1:36:54] half-hazard way
[1:36:55] you just you're just filling yourself
[1:36:57] but when you re when you really get to
[1:36:59] view
[1:37:00] of what jesus was oh my i like to preach
[1:37:04] on the deity the supreme
[1:37:06] deity of jesus christ if you could ever
[1:37:08] realize
[1:37:09] how he was what he did for you
[1:37:13] for for you men and women your heart
[1:37:16] will rent
[1:37:17] within you it says you will be willing
[1:37:20] to throw
[1:37:21] everything to throw away every trash in
[1:37:23] the world
[1:37:24] to live for him to live so that's why
[1:37:27] i'm saying this morning
[1:37:28] what the the the only time
[1:37:31] this becomes a condemnation is when we
[1:37:34] have the wrong
[1:37:35] view about what this is all about
[1:37:39] the only time this becomes a
[1:37:41] condemnation
[1:37:42] is if we're looking at it from the wrong
[1:37:45] side
[1:37:45] if we see what he had to go through what
[1:37:48] he laid down for our sake
[1:37:50] what it did for us everything that he
[1:37:52] laid down
[1:37:53] oh it causes something within your heart
[1:37:56] to live and say
[1:37:57] i can't believe somebody did all of this
[1:37:59] for me i have to embrace it i have to do
[1:38:02] everything to show my appreciation
[1:38:05] when the devil is just looking at you
[1:38:06] well you know
[1:38:08] all if all that's preached is well as
[1:38:10] long as you live out there
[1:38:11] you that way you're going to go to hell
[1:38:13] and all those things you're not calling
[1:38:15] out for anything
[1:38:17] are you doing it just throwing stones
[1:38:20] what you need
[1:38:21] is a gospel that will call that kid and
[1:38:24] tell him
[1:38:25] the life you live in is not the life
[1:38:27] that's within you
[1:38:28] you've been called to live better than
[1:38:30] what you're doing right now
[1:38:31] that is within you something that wants
[1:38:33] to serve god
[1:38:34] that's within you a seed that's calling
[1:38:36] for the reality of god
[1:38:38] the only thing you're doing right now is
[1:38:40] satisfying it with the trash of the
[1:38:42] world
[1:38:42] and one day you're gonna wake up and
[1:38:44] come face to face to him
[1:38:46] and you will not be the same anymore oh
[1:38:49] i tell you when that kid meets him one
[1:38:51] day
[1:38:52] oh i tell you all the things all the
[1:38:54] words you've been speaking will come
[1:38:56] into plain view
[1:38:57] you will realize what has been missing
[1:38:59] all along
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:03] it's the same life it's not a different
[1:39:06] life
[1:39:07] it's not a condemnation life well but
[1:39:10] random says i used to think god was mad
[1:39:13] at me
[1:39:14] god is not mad at you the devil wants to
[1:39:17] present it as
[1:39:18] there's some great enmity between you
[1:39:20] and god no the only enmity exists is
[1:39:23] between his seed and god's seed
[1:39:28] so now just want to go on now
[1:39:32] so we said it's the same life
[1:39:38] but when i'm as we read the scripture
[1:39:40] here
[1:39:41] just want to come to a place here we
[1:39:44] read in john chapter 12 and
[1:39:46] specifically verse 24 it says verily
[1:39:49] verily i say unto you
[1:39:51] except a corner with a kind of wheat
[1:39:54] uh falls into the ground and dies he
[1:39:57] abides alone
[1:39:59] but if it dies it will bring forth much
[1:40:01] fruit
[1:40:02] now just wanna
[1:40:05] lay down something here now we know that
[1:40:08] jesus was the fulfillment
[1:40:10] of all the old testament prophecy so he
[1:40:13] came
[1:40:14] what the prophet had spoken to him he
[1:40:16] was the seed that was spoken of
[1:40:18] in genesis we understand the scripture
[1:40:20] says that the seed of the woman
[1:40:22] will burst the serpent head it was that
[1:40:24] seed the prophet isaiah
[1:40:27] cried out the virgin shall conceive he
[1:40:29] was that seed
[1:40:30] and as we spoke about those two spirits
[1:40:32] being together
[1:40:33] the the seed of the enemy always looked
[1:40:36] to kill
[1:40:36] or to persecute the seed of god right
[1:40:39] from the beginning
[1:40:40] it came into able to try to kill him to
[1:40:42] stop the seed that didn't stop right
[1:40:44] there
[1:40:45] he killed it god raised up another one
[1:40:47] it came and then he did it again god
[1:40:49] raised up another one
[1:40:50] so since the beginning this seed was was
[1:40:54] even as he says about isaac he says that
[1:40:56] the promised son was really not isaac
[1:40:58] but it was christ
[1:40:59] because he was speaking concerning the
[1:41:02] world seed of abraham
[1:41:04] so now we take all of that we come back
[1:41:07] into the new testament now jesus christ
[1:41:10] is born
[1:41:11] so he's the word that that has been
[1:41:14] promised now he's come to a place
[1:41:16] where he has to go into the ground so
[1:41:19] now he speaks he says
[1:41:20] here he is now i want you just to
[1:41:23] dramatize a little bit here
[1:41:24] he has his ear he's the promised seed
[1:41:28] all the power is within him everything
[1:41:31] that
[1:41:31] all the world needed is within him all
[1:41:34] of that is within him
[1:41:36] now he's realizing that i have to go
[1:41:38] into the ground
[1:41:40] and rise again otherwise i abide by
[1:41:43] myself
[1:41:45] otherwise it's just going to be me in
[1:41:47] order for me to reproduce myself
[1:41:49] i have to go into the ground is by
[1:41:52] presenting the law of reproduction
[1:41:54] that this has to go into the ground in
[1:41:56] order to come back up
[1:41:58] so now he's here showing what he's about
[1:42:01] to do
[1:42:01] so he comes and he realized that here i
[1:42:04] am this is the very man
[1:42:05] who was promised from the beginning so
[1:42:07] he comes
[1:42:08] and he reads a scripture in uh uh john
[1:42:11] 12
[1:42:11] it speaks to job 20 24 how he must die
[1:42:16] so the seed goes and now he dies at the
[1:42:20] cross
[1:42:20] and the seed is planted
[1:42:24] and all i tell you the devil thought he
[1:42:27] got him
[1:42:29] he thought because the scripture speaks
[1:42:31] about how all the righteous men came
[1:42:34] off since abraham they came in when they
[1:42:36] died
[1:42:37] he took the sting of death and he stung
[1:42:39] them and he kept them down and jacob
[1:42:42] came
[1:42:42] same thing all of them david came and
[1:42:45] all of them as they were coming it was
[1:42:47] just holding them and holding them
[1:42:49] and holding them and so now the answer
[1:42:52] to
[1:42:52] all the prophets prophecy was here on
[1:42:55] the scene
[1:42:56] and now here he is the thinking is just
[1:42:59] like any other man
[1:43:00] but he knows exactly what he's doing in
[1:43:03] fact as he's speaking this word
[1:43:05] they have no idea what he's talking
[1:43:06] about
[1:43:08] so he comes and now is crucified and he
[1:43:11] goes into the ground
[1:43:13] and after three days oh it was the
[1:43:16] harvest time
[1:43:17] it was a time for those seed that went
[1:43:20] into the ground to be resurrected
[1:43:22] in other words his death made a way
[1:43:25] so that god could take of that spirit
[1:43:28] come back on the pentecost
[1:43:30] and distribute it to 120 that was
[1:43:33] sitting there waiting for him
[1:43:34] involvement for the promise of the
[1:43:36] father
[1:43:37] so now he comes and moved from one man
[1:43:39] into 120 in one day
[1:43:44] now but madame says this and i thought
[1:43:46] this was so wonderful i was
[1:43:48] fellowshipping with
[1:43:49] matthew just looking for this and and
[1:43:51] and
[1:43:52] he was able to find it for me so this is
[1:43:54] in the message the act of the holy
[1:43:56] spirit it says
[1:43:57] now they say having they say we was
[1:44:00] having a great time
[1:44:02] it says that report came back like the
[1:44:04] brother neville said a while ago
[1:44:06] i just kind of puffed up apostles and so
[1:44:09] forth
[1:44:10] they had some things uh something to do
[1:44:12] about it right on
[1:44:13] and when it went again and it was hard
[1:44:15] and preaching the gospel and peter and
[1:44:17] john
[1:44:18] ignore and unlearn and passed up to the
[1:44:20] get called beautiful now listen to this
[1:44:22] it says my the devil said well
[1:44:26] now they're going just out and they're
[1:44:28] going just out there preaching
[1:44:30] so it won't hurt anything
[1:44:35] it says then all these people believe in
[1:44:37] preaching
[1:44:38] everything so if it's just believing
[1:44:41] and preaching this morning the devil is
[1:44:44] okay
[1:44:46] that didn't work him up from bad he just
[1:44:48] lay down and he said i got it
[1:44:51] but listen to this but when they passed
[1:44:54] to the gate called beautiful
[1:44:56] they laid they lay them in the holy
[1:45:00] ghost said
[1:45:01] peter that man came that man can be
[1:45:04] healed
[1:45:05] he's got faith when he perceived he had
[1:45:08] faith to be healed he says
[1:45:10] stand up on your feet now i want you to
[1:45:13] realize this
[1:45:15] peter and john perceived
[1:45:18] that that man had something within him
[1:45:22] that could be healed something that
[1:45:24] could be changed
[1:45:25] he has a seed within him that could be
[1:45:28] called out
[1:45:29] something for him to receive what we
[1:45:31] have to offer
[1:45:32] so he says when he perceived that he did
[1:45:35] listen to this
[1:45:36] and and he's and when they they spoke to
[1:45:39] him
[1:45:39] he says stand up on your feet and he
[1:45:42] picked him up
[1:45:45] listen to this he picked him up and held
[1:45:47] him
[1:45:48] till his ankle bone received strength
[1:45:52] and i want to tell you this morning this
[1:45:54] is what we don't do most of the time
[1:45:56] we hear the word we go back to sleep we
[1:45:59] hear the word
[1:46:00] we go back to sleep i want to say like
[1:46:03] our pastor said
[1:46:04] we need to go out there and hold
[1:46:06] somebody's feet
[1:46:08] hold his hand let the world come to
[1:46:10] manifestation
[1:46:12] they knew that that person believed and
[1:46:14] if you believe for your child or for
[1:46:16] whatever
[1:46:16] you have there has to be some action to
[1:46:19] show that i believe this
[1:46:21] you can't just say i believe i'll just
[1:46:23] go to sleep no you keep calling on them
[1:46:26] you keep talking to them you keep
[1:46:28] bothering them
[1:46:29] you keep telling them until they had
[1:46:31] enough of you
[1:46:34] until they have enough of you they
[1:46:36] either get in or get out
[1:46:38] until they have they just can't stand it
[1:46:40] anymore and just say i'll just come
[1:46:42] anyway
[1:46:44] what we do is we let go too fast
[1:46:48] we don't hold we don't stand up and wait
[1:46:51] for the light to strengthen
[1:46:52] the scripture didn't say that when he
[1:46:54] spoke the man began to work no
[1:46:56] in fact as he stood up he was wobbling
[1:46:59] him they helped him up and they just
[1:47:01] hold him
[1:47:01] they just hold him until his legs got
[1:47:04] straight to stand on his own
[1:47:07] we need to do is to take the week in our
[1:47:10] meeting
[1:47:10] just hold them up you keep believing you
[1:47:13] keep believing
[1:47:14] just keep holding them just keep
[1:47:16] preaching to them just keep preaching to
[1:47:18] them
[1:47:18] one day they're going to walk on their
[1:47:20] own
[1:47:23] we have such a cut and dry attitude it
[1:47:26] is
[1:47:26] or it's not oh that's that can be god
[1:47:29] that oh that's how no that's not what we
[1:47:32] are called to do
[1:47:33] we are going to preach the word and
[1:47:35] preach it out
[1:47:36] and preach it out until the ankles gain
[1:47:39] strength
[1:47:43] and i want to say this this was not the
[1:47:46] end of it
[1:47:47] so as the god he got strengthened his
[1:47:49] uncle ankles
[1:47:50] and received strength and away he says
[1:47:53] he went limping and jumping
[1:47:55] and praising god he says you know what
[1:47:57] that caused more trouble
[1:47:59] than all the preaching that ever been
[1:48:02] done
[1:48:05] we need something that can cause more
[1:48:07] trouble than just the preaching
[1:48:11] we need something that's going to cause
[1:48:13] the devil to lose his mind
[1:48:15] we need something that can cause the
[1:48:17] trouble in the kingdom of the devil
[1:48:20] and what is that that's when a life
[1:48:22] comes to the manifestation
[1:48:23] so now it was just not one it became
[1:48:26] 120.
[1:48:28] they came the same in fact the scripture
[1:48:30] says
[1:48:31] they were ignorant and unlearned now
[1:48:34] this man
[1:48:35] was not a hidden person it was somebody
[1:48:40] the priest knew about the past i knew
[1:48:42] about
[1:48:43] this was not some hidden something you
[1:48:45] know i tell you well
[1:48:46] you know my son today was sick and and
[1:48:49] god healed him
[1:48:50] you know somebody people can have all
[1:48:52] kinds of doubt
[1:48:53] well you know i i don't know much and
[1:48:56] you know
[1:48:57] and you can let intellect can play into
[1:48:59] it and everything and all that
[1:49:01] but this was a public display
[1:49:04] of power of god doing it and it caused
[1:49:08] confusion
[1:49:09] and so many began to flock why because
[1:49:12] they knew that man he stood there every
[1:49:15] day
[1:49:15] asking for for begging for for little
[1:49:18] might and everything
[1:49:19] and when that happened it caused all
[1:49:20] kinds of chaos they went and grabbed
[1:49:22] them and asked him
[1:49:23] by that pride what power have you done
[1:49:25] this oh i tell you it's time for
[1:49:28] testimonies
[1:49:29] let's do this says the same jesus the
[1:49:32] same one that you took
[1:49:34] that you planted into the ground god has
[1:49:36] raised him up
[1:49:37] that life is no longer just one life
[1:49:40] it's manifested into 120.
[1:49:44] amen and i want to say this that's not
[1:49:47] the end of it
[1:49:48] because remember jesus did not appear by
[1:49:51] himself
[1:49:52] to the people saying look at me
[1:49:55] i'm raised no
[1:49:59] the proof of his resurrection was his
[1:50:02] life
[1:50:03] living within the disciples doing the
[1:50:06] same wonders and signs that he did in
[1:50:08] the beginning
[1:50:09] doing the same in fact they looked at
[1:50:11] the same characteristics of life
[1:50:13] they just looked at it the first thing
[1:50:15] that came out of mind that was like
[1:50:17] this must be christians this must be the
[1:50:20] followers of the man that we crucified
[1:50:22] why because their life was testifying of
[1:50:25] what they received
[1:50:26] oh my brother my sister in this end time
[1:50:30] we have received something but one of
[1:50:33] them says that this
[1:50:34] is the harvest time it talks about the
[1:50:36] seed
[1:50:37] he says now when the the church
[1:50:40] died if you were going the church ages
[1:50:43] it says
[1:50:43] into the dark ages the church was
[1:50:45] crucified
[1:50:47] the word the scripture says it was the
[1:50:50] christ himself was rejected
[1:50:53] so they took him in the dark ages and
[1:50:55] killed christian and all of that
[1:50:57] and that part of adam says that but in
[1:50:59] the harvest time
[1:51:00] that life is coming back and the same
[1:51:04] quickening power that came down on the
[1:51:06] day of pentecost
[1:51:08] that same quickening power has come at
[1:51:11] the opening of the world in this time
[1:51:15] we have received the same quickening
[1:51:17] power to do what
[1:51:18] to vindicate the same life that the
[1:51:21] disciples had
[1:51:22] now this is not so we can come here and
[1:51:25] manifest pentecost and the gifts and
[1:51:27] everything
[1:51:27] no this is to manifest the promise that
[1:51:30] god said
[1:51:31] that i will restore like adam as it was
[1:51:34] in the beginning
[1:51:36] so yeah we all we go past way pentecost
[1:51:39] all the way into what was in the mind of
[1:51:42] god in the beginning
[1:51:47] where a man is able to stand by that
[1:51:50] quickening power
[1:51:51] and bring things into existence
[1:51:55] we have seen that quickening power and
[1:51:58] that's the life
[1:51:59] i want to just say this this morning
[1:52:02] that's what we are called
[1:52:04] to move into it's
[1:52:07] been given to us it's our inheritance
[1:52:11] don't let anything stop you short of
[1:52:13] that
[1:52:15] revival is to keep the life
[1:52:18] to continue to keep that life the moment
[1:52:21] you stop
[1:52:21] and you get satisfied that life will
[1:52:24] leave you
[1:52:25] you become a camp but the life of god
[1:52:29] is moving and we want to move with it
[1:52:32] if the musician could come this morning
[1:52:50] when i asked you tonight this morning
[1:52:52] what is the harvest time
[1:52:55] what is the harvest time
[1:53:01] i just began to see so many connections
[1:53:04] and for the sake of time i'll just
[1:53:06] mention
[1:53:07] some of them in excuse me
[1:53:21] the harvest time is when the seed that
[1:53:25] was so come
[1:53:26] into the full manifestation of what was
[1:53:30] sown
[1:53:32] it's the time where
[1:53:35] the word is here to bring the seed
[1:53:38] to maturity
[1:53:42] it's the time where the seed is now able
[1:53:44] to stand
[1:53:45] the correction when when the
[1:53:48] the tears comes and it has to be pulled
[1:53:51] out of you
[1:53:52] the seed is mature enough to stand there
[1:53:54] and say
[1:53:56] let it be according to thy word why
[1:53:59] because the seed is
[1:54:00] fully matured all that it desires
[1:54:04] is to see what was planted in it it
[1:54:06] seemed the manifestation
[1:54:08] and it's no longer interested in the
[1:54:10] terror that's close by
[1:54:11] it wants the terror picked up it's when
[1:54:15] the spirit
[1:54:15] is bringing the same life that was in
[1:54:18] christ
[1:54:18] into the believer it's when the word is
[1:54:22] bringing forth the manifestation of true
[1:54:24] sons and daughters of god in the end
[1:54:26] time
[1:54:28] it becomes everything you look at
[1:54:31] everything that brahmana see preach you
[1:54:33] begin to realize
[1:54:34] he was preaching about harvest time
[1:54:37] there's a man here to turn on the light
[1:54:40] he that is in you is greater who is this
[1:54:44] mighty god unveiled before us
[1:54:46] christ in the mystery of god reveal it's
[1:54:49] the harvest time it was the time for it
[1:54:51] he's been he's telling you listen there
[1:54:53] was something that was planted
[1:54:55] now it's the fruit time the master is
[1:54:58] interested in the fruits
[1:55:00] and is not interested in the fruit that
[1:55:02] we can produce by our old self remember
[1:55:05] the the branch has to be plugged into
[1:55:07] the vine
[1:55:08] so the same life that's in the vine can
[1:55:10] go into the branch
[1:55:12] the branch is not given to produce its
[1:55:14] own life no
[1:55:15] it's the life that comes from the vine
[1:55:17] that produces the fruits
[1:55:19] so it's the word here to bake all the
[1:55:23] greens
[1:55:24] the unbelieve in the seeds because it's
[1:55:26] time for harvest
[1:55:28] it's the same life in the vine the same
[1:55:31] life
[1:55:32] that's been manifested in the branches
[1:55:35] and the word is here to bring forth
[1:55:38] fruits
[1:55:39] unto perfection how can we attain to
[1:55:42] that perfection
[1:55:43] by the life by the life
[1:55:48] if you could stand this morning
[1:55:53] i want to say this harvest time
[1:55:57] is adoption time
[1:56:00] [Music]
[1:56:07] it's an adoption time
[1:56:11] it means that the seed has to have been
[1:56:14] grown
[1:56:15] and gotten to a place where you know
[1:56:18] i was thinking about christ the seed
[1:56:20] that went into the ground
[1:56:23] before pentecost it had to be brought in
[1:56:26] such a place
[1:56:28] where it even confessed by its own mouth
[1:56:31] it says father let it not be my will but
[1:56:34] your will
[1:56:35] where it had to die to itself so that
[1:56:38] the
[1:56:39] this this this seed can come into
[1:56:42] the full maturity was mentioned even it
[1:56:44] says hear him but here he comes and he's
[1:56:47] about to die he says
[1:56:48] let it not be my will but your will why
[1:56:51] because
[1:56:52] in that was the father's desire
[1:56:54] manifested
[1:56:55] and we come into maturity where when we
[1:56:58] lose our own desires when it's not just
[1:57:01] about what we want what we want to see
[1:57:03] oh you know if this is not the way i
[1:57:05] want it then it's not right and
[1:57:06] no i just want the will of the father i
[1:57:09] just want to know what he wants me to do
[1:57:11] i just want to be at the place where
[1:57:13] he's called me to be
[1:57:14] when you get to that place then you're
[1:57:16] coming into
[1:57:17] because the father desires to see the
[1:57:19] fruits
[1:57:20] so he can take it and use it for his
[1:57:23] table
[1:57:24] let's just bow our heads this morning
[1:57:27] our gracious father we're so thankful
[1:57:29] this morning father
[1:57:31] lord for the life they've made available
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:36] lord i can raise my hand this morning i
[1:57:38] said i desire of thy life more than
[1:57:40] anything
[1:57:42] lord i prayed this morning that you just
[1:57:44] pour it upon us
[1:57:46] lord so we may grow stay in this
[1:57:48] presence of the sun
[1:57:50] and have all the greens taken out of us
[1:57:52] we can come into the maturity that
[1:57:54] you're looking for
[1:57:55] in the perfect image lord help us father
[1:57:59] let us not be slack but let us press
[1:58:01] forward lord and
[1:58:03] continuing to eat the word to drink and
[1:58:06] to stay in the word and to let the
[1:58:08] spirit move upon us so we can bring the
[1:58:10] things that you desire lord
[1:58:12] lord we love you and ask those things
[1:58:14] knowing that you are faithful to give it
[1:58:16] to us
[1:58:17] if you place the desire within our heart
[1:58:19] if you made a way that we can have it
[1:58:21] lord we hear asking that you may give it
[1:58:24] father like the scripture says that
[1:58:26] it's the time for harvest it says but
[1:58:28] let that that you may go to the lord of
[1:58:30] harvest and pray that he may send
[1:58:33] workers into the field and your prophet
[1:58:35] said that he was the lord of harvest
[1:58:37] obviously he knew
[1:58:38] that he needed workers and why go ask
[1:58:41] him it says well
[1:58:42] that's your program even the things that
[1:58:45] we have need of that you already know
[1:58:47] you want us to come and ask so this
[1:58:49] morning we ask father that you pour your
[1:58:51] spirit out upon us
[1:58:53] father fill us with your word lead us
[1:58:55] and guide us on all truth and
[1:58:57] righteousness
[1:58:58] father let our heart burn for you more
[1:59:00] than anything lord
[1:59:01] father that if we we believe that the
[1:59:04] more we burn for you the more the
[1:59:06] desires of the world will follow
[1:59:07] us the only reason why we stole hunger
[1:59:11] for the world
[1:59:12] world is because father we haven't
[1:59:14] really been burning that much for you
[1:59:16] but we asked this morning that you just
[1:59:18] increase your fire within us
[1:59:20] no the the things of the world may fall
[1:59:22] off
[1:59:23] we love you lord and we ask these things
[1:59:25] from our heart in the name of jesus
[1:59:27] christ we pray
