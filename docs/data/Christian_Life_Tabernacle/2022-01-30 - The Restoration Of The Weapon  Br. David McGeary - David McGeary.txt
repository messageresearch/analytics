Description:
The Restoration Of The Weapon
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: January 30, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

in his presence this morning man we certainly want to welcome everyone and our visitors amen thank you for being here we're going to invite brother mike for our psalm reading this morning god bless you good morning every once in a while when you're reading the scriptures you come across some words that are unusual they're words that you know maybe we don't use anymore in the english language don't you know probably most people don't really know what they mean you know most of the time we all do it we read right past the word and we just sort of assume what it means you know we think because of the context it means one thing or another and we just let it pass on by there's an example one of those words in psalm 30. and it begins in verse 1 i will extol thee oh lord i will extol thee you know and this is david speaking that word extol is probably not a word that any of us use probably nobody would really understand what you're saying if you used it in regular language you know i suppose that when we read that we sort of breeze right by it thinking that you know it's just praise and you know the question becomes do you really know what you're reading when you read it you know sometimes we'll simply assume what it means and perhaps miss out on the message that's hidden in that word you know the words in scripture are not random they aren't just casually thrown out there to fill out space on a page the scripture says that holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost and history has shown that the hand of god has very carefully directed the construction of his word in the scriptures through the ages so every word is divinely appointed even the ones that are odd you know that word extol is only used four times in scripture three of those times are by david in the psalms and this is the first time right here that word is ever used and you know i've shared with you before more often than not the first time a word or phrase is used in the scripture there's a clue to what it means you know that word extol in the hebrew actually means to raise up to lift up kind of like a heave offering but you know this is this is more than just our version of praising the lord this is not something you do with your lips this is an action that hebrew word is literally taking an object and lifting it up and putting it in your highest place to extol you know when we read the scripture that says i extol thee oh lord do we do we take him and lift him up into our highest place not on sunday morning in a song service but on tuesday morning with your walk this is not something you verbalize this is not something you say with music or sing with a song or lift up your hands and suddenly you're extolling the lord but it's where you take him and you put him in your highest place this is an effort this is a an action when the music stops and you go home do you put him in your highest place you know psalm 30 verse 1 says i will extol thee o lord i will lift you up because thou has lifted me up you see the difference this is more than just praise it's because you have taken me and you have lifted me up now i take you and i lift you up i will extol thee oh lord this is something that you can only do if you have first experienced his hand lifting you up this is not something you can casually walk into a church service and do you have to have first experienced his hand reaching down and taking you and lifting you up to a higher place before you could ever begin to lay hold of him and lift him up to your highest place you know david knew a little bit about being raised up from nothing and put in a higher place you know it says in second samuel 7 8 as the prophet is speaking to him thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheep coat from following the sheep to be ruler over my people israel and it was at the time in second samuel five where he finally had laid to rest all his enemies and found himself in a place of kingship when he had previously been on the run living among the sheep and then he had another king offer him tribute and build him a house of cedars for nothing and it was at the dedication of that house that psalm 30 is written it says i will lift you up oh lord because you have lifted me up he knew something about the hand of the lord taking him from nothing and raising him up you know the very last time that word extol is used comes from kind of a surprising place did you know that king nebuchadnezzar actually wrote a chapter of our bible and it's in daniel chapter four that entire chapter is a writing of king nebuchadnezzar writing scripture and it's an experience that he had with the lord you know the story that he became lifted up with pride and there came a point in time where god struck him down where he was living as a wild man among the animals had lost his mind was eating plants and living among the beasts and you know they had to cast him out of the city but there came an hour where god came by his way and lifted him back up and raised him back up and put him back on his throne and it was there that he wrote daniel 4 37 now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven somebody who had experienced the hand of god picking him up and putting him in a higher place now he could take the lord and put him in his highest place the very king of babylon i will extol thee oh lord not something you sing not something you say no matter how loud you say it but it's something you do and it's something you can only do if you've experienced his hand lifting you up what a wonderful reminder funny what a little word will do if you don't breeze by it so maybe let's read psalm 30 this morning it's just a short chapter i will extol the o lord starting in verse 1 i will extol thee oh lord for thou has lifted me up and has not made my foes to rejoice over me o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the great thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is light weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved lord by thy favor thou has made my mountain to stand strong thou didst tie thy face and i was troubled i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication what prophet is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall the dust phrase thee shall it declare thy truth hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper thou hast turned for me my morning into dancing thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee forever [Music] when he calls [Music] power [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is

hearts and our minds of the great resurrection that's coming [Music] and though the world mocks and says that we've lost our minds we have a promise let this mind be in you that was in the lord jesus and we ask that you'd grant that to us this morning we asked these things this morning in the precious and wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles and you'll turn with me to ephesians the sixth chapter of the book of ephesians and and we'd like to read a scripture found in um ephesians the 6th chapter and the 12th verse in the scripture in ephesians the 6th chapter and the 12th verse reads as follows for rewrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places amen our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in your precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated we'd like just to have a little sunday school this morning it's certainly nice to be back in the house of the lord and good morning to you all i i hope you miss me as much as i missed you you know that that would be nice but so you know sir being out seeing my mother and many of you know my mother's 99 years old now and you know she if i go buy a loaf of bread she wants to give me a dollar to pay for it you know and uh she's always uh want me to pay me back for everything but we were able to put in a new dishwasher for and and fix the door handle and fix the gate and put a light in the shed and put a motion detector light out in the new porch light and so we're there doing things for but you know she does so well it's it's it's really remarkable and she won't even let me help her down the steps you know i can do this and and we went we didn't go fishing this trip but we went fishing uh one trip with my mom and she walked all the way out to the pier with us all the way and she held the fishing pole and she fished out this there with us for about eight hours and you know i i'm thankful to the lord for that very few people in their 70s have their mothers with them you know i lost my father i guess 12 years ago or so and but i'm thankful for it but yet knowing that this can't go on forever you know it's you have to sometimes look at the things that you're facing and there's uh something that they refer to a lot in the world today and it's called denial uh you know they will call somebody and they'll say well they're in denial another they've they refuse to look at it the way that it really is and they'll they'll stand there and they'll be in denial they don't recognize that they have a problem and many times before you can help people is they've got to come to the conclusion that they have a problem you know if you don't have a problem then you certainly can't have help but if you recognize that you have a problem and you desire to have help then uh that's what you're resting in you're resting in the fact that that uh that there's help and uh if you know and i i i really uh being out in california which is a very different place than texas is of course i they still have uh masked mandates and you got to wear a mask everywhere and and they still have a lot of lockdown procedures and still seem to be dealing with covet in a much different way than we're dealing with it but i begin to look and think of the great effect that this plague and i thought it was strange that our government referred to it as a plague they called it one at one time they called it the china plague and and that wasn't correct because it was satan's plague that's who it is all sickness is of the devil but it was sent for a purpose and a reason and and uh and and seeing the far-reaching effects of what that it did and i think one of the strongest effects that it had everybody talks about the economical effect and you know the economy effect and the effect on the supply chain and the effect on being able to get things and the effect on prices and they all talk about the carnal effect of the plague but it was the spiritual toll that the plague took that was greater than the carnal toll and not just our church through this time period we have lost uh members uh from our congregation uh different things have transpired and but churches in general have lost a tremendous amount of people this is the first time in our nation's history that more people don't go to church then go to church so you no longer can be called a christian nation when the majority of the population doesn't go to church anymore it's almost down to only 40 percent so because that's a a quite a shift and so we begin to understand that things are shifting things are changing we know that man has a great desire to survive and they always argue and fuss over their method to survive and many people feel that what's going to have to happen is that the world is going to have to come together as one great community and there's going to have to have something that rises up and governs the world together in order for the world together to fight plagues how many knows plagues are coming they're coming how evident is the reality of plagues just think two years ago a around this time it just started coming and it wasn't by the end of this month in the beginning of february i believe that we only had 10 people allowed in church and they had shut everything down restaurants were closed people were going to stores and and taking everything off the shelves many of you remember the great run on toilet paper that's how smart man is you know what i mean and uh it and so it just came and everybody was in lockdown the police showed up here at our our church to find out if we had more than people here somebody called because they saw some cars in the parking lot and the the policeman came in and of course we invited him to stay but he didn't feel that he could i said well you don't have to be on the street there's nobody out there and i and as far as i'm concerned you're a lot safer in the house of the lord than you are out out there uh you know sometimes we forget that uh part of it but there's been a a great event that's happened and sometimes it's hard for us to stand back and look at it from afar and realized what has just transpired and what what has just swept over the land and the world and what was the purpose behind it in other words what was satan trying to accomplish you know i know we don't take that in to thought much and that's what why we want to play uh 20 minutes 21 minutes of a message called the conflict between god and satan and also we'd like to read a few statements from the contest so there there had to be something that satan was trying to accomplish by sending this virus or whatever uh you want to call it or this circumstance this situation and after there there had to be something that that he was trying to accomplish or get at now so we know where the battle is don't we the battles where it's in the mind and so we know that there's a message that was preached called the greatest battle ever fought and i went back and i started reading through the titles of the messages in 1962 and i thought this is a a prelude if i could say this 1916 is the prelude of the sermons being preached before the opening of the seals and and and so god was preparing his children if i could say it that way by the word of god for a great event that was going to take place and he preached messages like the paradox you know something that is seemingly unbelievable but yet it's real he preached messages like perseverance and the greatest battle ever fought wisdom versus faith the contest the conflict between god and satan so many of uh forsaking all he preached so many messages that the uncertain sound so many messages that indicated that there was a battle coming there and that's what he's talking about the greatest battle ever fought so you know so much of what our messenger preached to us is prophecy it's preparation god always gives warning before judgment and so he began to preach a lot of 62 if the prophet of god is talking about like wisdom versus faith you know it indicates battle it indicates strife it indicates the fact that you're going to have to pre uh pursue you're going to have to persist you're going to have to you're going to have to fight the good fight of faith and soak it if i know we're sitting back here yeah i guess it would be now what 60 years later is that where how far we are from 62 22 right so we're years later but there's something that we always forget about god's word that god's word is eternal and it doesn't change the only thing that changes is man changes man is always trying to adjust to what's around him and and so this this great uh 60 years later we really find out the things that were preached are coming to pass and you know we think about it how many years was it before the lord came that isaiah said a virgin shall conceive you go back hundreds of years 800 years i i think is some scholars say so many of the things that were preached before he ever arrived in fact there was such a distance between the times the prophecies were given in bethlehem oh little bethlehem the things that were spoken and the things that were prophesied and the things that he said he would be there was so much time in between and society and education and civilization had changed even though the promise had not changed that it became unrecognizable when it showed up so much so he even said i have not come to do i come to fulfill every jot every tittle every prophecy that was made with search the scriptures in them you say you have eternal life but every single one of them spoke of me so really he he was a fulfillment of the law and the prophets but there had been such a space of time such a change in the civilization such a change in the education such a change in the economy that and people became more involved in prosperity and and the things that they could learn and the advancements that they were making and the political system that had come upon them with the roman empire and all those things that the fulfillment of the scriptures became blurred to their vision and i think that a lot of what's transpiring now it's been a while since the message was given the warning was given that we've had marriages and and and and children and we've grown in age and in time and many have come and gone and but yet the one thing that always remains the same is god's word so this morning this message to me is these two messages stood up for me because we were just finishing the sermon does god ever change his mind about his word and in other words that's the one thing about god's word and so this morning when we when we look at it you say well do you have a title uh for uh your sermon then i i thought if i would have a title i would call it the restoration of the weapon the restoration of the weapon and so let's just listen to a few statements before that we listen to the 21 minutes of this tape so this is called this quotes that i want to read to you here is from the message a contest so you are in a contest you may not think you are but you are you are involved in a battle the greatest battle that was ever fought you are in the battle of your mind so there can you imagine we just heard now let's let's just look at how scary the description of this enemy is he's the ruler of darkness it's spiritual wickedness in high places principalities and powers rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness in high places what a description there isn't no little guy this is a scary dude and what is he after you think what is he after what is he trying to get a hold of what is it that he's trying to captivate because that's what he is he's a captivator that's why the lord came to what set us free so you sit back and you think what is satan after he's after your mind he wants to get this thing that's inside of you and make it think the way he thinks you're gonna think the way i think else you're gonna fail you're gonna get sick you're not gonna ever have nothing you're never gonna have that ferrari you've always wanted no you don't think he's after his mind because the greatest battle was preached 60 years ago and we forgot you know what one of the curses of satan is they no longer wish to keep god in their consciousness so they're seared with the hot iron he's after your children's mind just think of the stuff i i just saw it the other day that i don't know who makes emojis i didn't know what emoji was i thought it was a soft drink it's like the sister who went to the chinese restaurant and said oh they have a wee fee here i've never eaten wefi before but they they have a pregnant man and some other thing why why they're after your mind look what's going what's the battle in school they have the unicorn you know because they have books everything what are they after they're after your mind it's it's okay to be homosexual it's okay to have the same sex marriage it's okay to do this and it's it's okay to do that what are they battling for they're battling for your mind and what are they trying to make it they're trying to make it difficult for you to stand up and fight against it i thought uh brother my psalm was so perfect in the exhortation this morning with god's word no you don't think about your mind just go about your way see that's to me what satan's purpose of the plague was was to get people out of the house of god to get them out of fellowship to get them out of why because the word corrects the air the word is what battles the battle and so if he could isolate you if you can decide that you don't need to come to church together if it's too dangerous come to come to church you want to know something people are just getting sick just the same well i'll tell you it's too dangerous to eat nowadays half the food's hybrid it's poison it's producing a bunch of mush that's the saith the lord but you see what he's after he's after our minds because after our thought process he's after our thinking come what do we call that we'll get to it let's just listen he said spiritual wickedness in high places now isn't that funny you can't see spirits you can only see the effect of the spirit how many times have you heard this expression have you lost your mind way because people are now questioning the thought process and the faculties that go into the decision-making have you lost your mind well i say have you lost your spiritual mind have you lost your eye sav have you lost your gold trident fire have you lost your white raymond i'd like to draw from that this is paragraph nine in the contest preached in i think it it's december 31st in 1962. for a 15-minute context rather i want to call it the contest a contest is a test of strength so what do you think he really sent this plague for to test the strength of the church to test the strength of their mind how many people without reason you tell me why people believe that he can sit there and eat and i can put a mask on standing up and he's safe everybody buys it i pity a person who's driving down the street in their car that they took out of their garage that they came out of their house into their car out of their garage is in driving down the street with two face masks on and a shield [Music] you know why they've lost their mind or may i say it this way they are coming into one mind doesn't god want us to be in one mind and one accord what do you think the enemy wants one mind one accord and it's a test of strength are you going to bow no i'd rather be a shadrack a mesh acting than the bed eagle i want him to sing the song shadrach meshach and abednego and david we don't want to go in the fiery furnace we want to avoid it oh he's got lots of ways you can put on a religious coat cover up the cowardness and let them take your mind but let me not forget this to remind you once again of this scripture let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus it's a test of strength and we were we have the test of strength we have the test of strength you have to you might not want to believe it but your strength in god's word is going to be put to the test because satan is a liar he's the father of all lies and he's an unbeliever he even tempted the lord of glory because he didn't believe it's the strength he goes on to say the indians used to have a contest of strength they called the tug of war and they used to pull one another through the fire he says but i want to speak for these minutes quickly upon the greatest contest there is it's between the church and satan i want to talk about the greatest contest there ever is it's between you the church and satan satan's after your mind god's after your mind and what's the curse of lady elsia it's what luke warm lukewarm is the mixture a lukewarm mind is a mixture between god's mind and satan's mind he says now this great this is paragraph and this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and satan was kicked out into the earth and then he become an enemy to god's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull god's people across fire or in to his fire he's using all his strength all his strategy to pull you into his fire you know what he wants to make you servants in his kingdom all you are if you're in his hands is a block builder in satan's eden that's what the children of israel represented in bondage building a pharaoh kingdom and nowadays man is in the same bondage but they're building a kingdom to satan satan's eden the god of this evil age and before he can do that he's got to get your mind to his cause you can't get away from it you can be in denial but i understand that and then it goes down paragraphed elk he said and i know that's an old saying that people that it's an old saying and it's not so old neither but people don't believe in demons in this day i mean do you really consciously understand there there are real demon spirits we know of at least two hundred thousand thousand that were released and they re give you rivers euphrates to battle against who the bride is that feast of the trumpets i think that's in feasts of the trumpets isn't it just think of that so there's actually demons assigned to you to captivate your mind and to bring you into servitude to the king of the air the prince of this world now that's some scary stuff can you imagine you know you just think you're getting a great college degree you know what i mean you think you're you're you're doing all this stuff you got all this accomplishment you look back and say i got this house and i got this car and i got this and i got this money in my bank and i've done so well and i've got a little piece of paper on the wall that says i'm a master look if you've got that paper on the wall to you you might be a master of one i'm all for masters and doctorates and all those things are all wonderful but to me that's a lot of boredom that's a lot of hours reading it's a lot of hours sitting listening and it's usually about 12 years of your life but when it's all said and done what does it profit the man if he gaineth the whole world and loses his soul now i'm not trying to promote ignorance because there are some people that i've seen that are so dumb i wish they would have spent some time in school and i look at him and i think what are you thinking how do you think but let's just say he said they say there's no people say they don't believe in demons today but but the thing to do to my opinion is know your enemy and know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to meet him now how does he appear as an angel of light he's the kind priest he's such a good guy the prophet said he's a slicker he doesn't have horns in a pit a pitchfork and a fork and tongue he's a snicker surely you won't die you'll be god you'll be smart it'll be wonderful because you're going to meet him and know him know his know what his strength is then train for this contest when you meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him and so you train for the contest now so with that in mind that we need to train for this enemy and we need to know what his strength is and what his tactic is then we can understand how is it and what method does he use to try to captivate our minds sounds like a science fiction movie doesn't it or a horror movie but he is he's trying to shoot his a spiritual electrodes [Music] into your mind and get your thinking try to get fear is him getting your mind doubt is him getting your mind anxiety all these things are just satan trying to captivate your mind so let's just stop here for a moment and turn to the message and they'll play it on the board protests the conflict between god and satan the conflict the contest the strength and work and in this little portion he's going to talk about what satan uses and what god uses and do you understand that i believe that this virus and what's going on in the world politically and everything is now a great move of satan to get people's minds we think he's after our soul no if he gets your mind he has your soul what did he do he got people out of church cut off the lifeline of god's word and then he was able to get their minds you tell me how people that have a revelation of this message can all of a sudden lose their mind something transpired so let's listen and you we've already stood for our scripture reading so if you want to turn in your bibles to the scripture that the prophet of god is going to use is joshua 24 14 and 15. as we listened to just 21 minutes of this and we could go on farther on this but we want to quickly move into our small little point this morning as we listen to this foundation so remember as you listen to this satan's after your mind that's what the greatest battle is for your mind he wants to plant whatever seed he can in your thinking so let's just listen for this next 21 minutes and i hope this helps you this morning but you know i mean it yeah you know like paul said though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and understand all the mysteries and have not charity it profiteth me nothing and if i could say it this way we know what the mind of christ is right let every man look on the need of every other so what is it profit if we if we have all these great understandings of all these mysteries and don't have the mind of god's word so amen i just trust this is a blessing i i i thought well i could just read these but i don't think there's any better way to have it said than to hear the messenger say it so god bless you 21 minutes it's not long try to stay awake try to listen try not to worry about your water bill it'll be there when you get home okay so hang tough for 21 minutes now we want to turn for just a few words tonight out of the bible found over in the book of joshua 24 14th verse and 15th verse i want to read from his word listen close to his word joshua 24 14-15 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we'll serve the lord amen lord bless the reading of his scriptures i have some notes here that were like talk just a little bit from and i want to take a text tonight to call it the conflict the conflict between god and satan and just our teach it like a sunday school lesson but i've got several scriptures laying here um in eden god knew his enemy and all the attacks of his enemy a god is the infinite god and the infinite god is the perfection of the perfections he knew all things before they ever was and therefore if this infinite god could have looked forward and did and seen the end from the beginning and knew that he would have children on this earth his own blessed children don't you believe that he would provide for them the best that he could provide would not you tonight to your children that was helpless little fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything that you can to provide the best that you can or able to provide for those children because you are a father a parent and if that being the the what i would say the the trueness and the thought of an earthly parent in parenthood originated in god because he was the first parent don't you think that god seeing what satan would be what satan would do he gave to his children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them to knowing what the enemies attacked would be god fortified his children we take the war when a general goes out to meet another general in war and uh this general if he's a real true citizen of this nation that he represents and he surely would be to be a general and uh the first thing he studies the enemy's attacks he knows what he's going to do how he's going to work because he kind of went over and spied out we got spies everywhere you know there's american spies in england there's american spies in france there's america and the german spies here and is no matter how friendly we are we still got spies and we're spying out some kind of a nuclear weapon then we find it take it back to the country then what it is they get ready when war does come they know how to attack their enemy and if we know god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy is going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the very first thing that god equipped his children was being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat satan any time any place anywhere on any conditions now he wouldn't say i'll give him something here and then a few years later i may study out something better to give them and uh then after a few years later like we in military force old bow and arrow and sledge rock hammer and then the next was a after the bow and arrow come the musket and after the musket come the springfield and and now the atomic weapons and things see we keep growing more but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite god now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of a attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture amen what was it the word amen the word that's what defeats satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing that there is the word and we find jesus on earth just to prove this was the best equipment when satan come and hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never just reached over with his power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that god gave in the garden of eden his word and said it's written amen it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's god's vest and look where it is it's not just for a one or two in a church it's for every one of us every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and jesus proved it when he come so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy when the all-out warfare comes into battles and uh setting a rate then there's only one thing a real soldier can use a real christian soldier that's thus saith the lord amen walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that nothing thousand may fall at you right in ten thousandths at the left but it won't come naughty just remember that god made this statement and give this to his children that's the best that's ever been yet satan in eden when he first come to these attacks to attack the person knowing the children of god was fortified with this word satan attacked the word see he never attacked the bee he attacked the word first amen look at that sneaker lizard what he does today the first thing he can't lay it on saying well that's not a good person that's a good person see but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get him to deny that word amen that's the only thing he wants to do get you to deny that word so satan tried to to attack the word in the garden of eden so he had to have something now that he could use to to the human being would look better than that word see he had to have something that would look better to the human being than word and you know what he used reasoning just what would say common sense so that's what he used and he succeeded amen so that's what he's used all along but god can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when god makes a decision it has to ever remain that way amen and satan took reasonings and took the reasonings and attacked the word and shook eve off the path that's right by reasonings human reasoning now the only way he she could uh got to disbelieve god's word it had to be appealing and satan knows how to make reasonings appealing it has to appeal to you and sin is very appealing and there's only one sin and that's unbelief so it's really appealing satan makes sin so appealing to you just stop in here for a few minutes i've often thought as a young man and read about uh different nations and the morals of the country and i'd heard different people tell me about especially down in france down in the place called pig alley and how that um the people were so immoral well i thought if i ever go in there i'll see them people down there women coming out you know rip a baits with such a old haggy look you know and mean and i went down in big alley the first night me and three more ministers brother what a surprise we got now satan's too smart for that he isn't going to produce something like that but some of the prettiest girls i ever seen in my life was there appealing certainly sin is appealing and attractive satan hasn't got a fork in hooves [Music] and like that he is an old john barley corn out with coat hanging up and ears hanging down he's a slicker appealing sin isn't just rude like you think it is it's very appealing therefore we have to watch it close we'll just get to that in a little bit i thought of something else so uh how satan makes it looks so real it's appealing to them but if they would have just stayed fortified with the word let the word be their fortress then see if they've been fortified they've been behind the word the word would been in front of them always thus saith the lord thus saith the lord thus saith the lord right or left thus saith the lord like those angels down there that day when isaiah met in the temple he thought he was getting along pretty good a fairly good preacher the king liked him real well but the king was taken from him one day and he knelt at the altar and fell into a vision and saw angels with wings over their faces or their feet and flying with two wings a singing holy holy holy lord god almighty amen see every which away they went ezekiel saw the picture of the vision this way the spirit of god was moving it had the face of an ox this way it had the face of a line and everywhere it went it had a face every where it went it was 45. the word of god there's no way around fortified all the way around everywhere thus saith the lord just saith the lord you're walking you're talking your business you're associating everything but the word of god first amen so i believe i'll go tonight and um this little dance this won't hurt anybody could you take thus saith the lord with you i believe if i could pull this little deal it oh it's just a little bit shady but could you say thus saith the lord with it always take him first keep fortified for he is our fortress it's strange but do you know you have to ignore before in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny god's truth first before you can believe the devil's lie amen do you ever think of that you have to deny the truth first before you can believe a lie amen right after the night eve got from behind it and lost the battle as soon as eve satan was standing out there shooting these targets she said but the lord said and then he shot again she said but the lord said so then he shot again another way but the lord said but satan raised up back there said but wait just a minute if the lord did say that let me just tell you something you see you're not wise like god you don't know right from wrong but if listen wouldn't you love to be wise like god why eve said it yes i i i believe i would maybe something like that i believe i would like to just know all the wisdom of god i like to know what's right and wrong i don't know it well i tell you now she said but but the lord said well but surely you know he's a good god he won't do that see right there she broke the hole through so he could shoot right there she made the wrong stop right there stopped a little bit now let me say something to you christians down here don't you never stop one second for the devil don't stop to reason it out when you start to reason it the devil comes right in you cannot reason god you cannot understand god you've got to just believe god okay i can't explain god nobody can i can't explain many things but the only thing i just believe it because he said so amen now there's none of us can explain it don't try to explain it don't get with these unbelievers and say well now look your pastor out there junior i hear him pray for the sick now y'all crazy down there there's no such thing as divine healing say all right there isn't for you then you're an unbeliever and just walk right on it's just for believers don't well you all say you got the holy ghost there's no such thing as holy ghost said it isn't for you than it is for me so you don't read don't try to reason it hasn't got no reasoning you just believe it you don't reason a thing because remember the only way that you can accept god is by faith amen not by reasons not by understanding not able to explain you don't explain nothing you believe something amen not what you feel jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it amen that's right you just believe what god said i can't explain to you how the how could a the greatest miracle i could think of is a man who is like take a pig and tell that pig you know you're no more pig you are a lamb and he becomes a lamb that'd be hard to believe well it's the same thing takes place when you become converted from a sinner to a christian see it changes your own opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you and it brings you into another life and gives you another spirit that bears forth another record see then your old life has to die and the new one has to be born again and then see you're no more the creature you was at all that's when you become behind the blood fortified with the word don't try to explain nothing just believe it and go on lord i believe savior raise my faith in thee till it can move them out amen the heart i believe for all my doubts are buried in the fountain that's good isn't it but we we just wanted to brush on that for just a second so that we we under we understood that this is what the conflict is in the battle in your mind right is what god said versus what reasoning common sense and earth what's he trying to get you to do to think the way that he thinks i thought this one statement was was pretty uh phenomenal if if i could just grab it here for you again real quick it says now the only way that he she could have got to disbelief god's word is it had to be appealing satan knows how to make reasoning appealing in other words he knows how to make reasoning make sense it only makes sense it makes sense now do you remember what the very first tactic that he used to do surely he's a good god he won't do that you know they forget the mark of the beast all those good people out there surely they're good people they love the lord surely god's not going to judge him because they cut their hair surely god's not going to judge him because they paint their faith surely god's not going to judge him because they wear pants and they wear shorts and they put on bikinis and they go mix bathing together he's such a good god the same lie that he told in the beginning did you hear what he said he said satan used that in the beginning and it worked and because it's worked he's used it ever since now god but knowing right what was coming in other words god knowing what we would be up against what did he do i could just run around this church right now what did he do he restored the weapon what did he send elijah for to restore back the faith of the children he knew what the battle was going to be he knew what he was taking him to he knew that he was gonna pull him across the fire he knew that he was gonna build an eden that he was gonna become the god of this evil age he knew that people would be worshiping him thinking that they were worshiping god blind miserable poor wretched naked and not know it how are they going to fight how are they going to fight this he came in beast after beast he took him to the dark ages now he's got his mark and he's putting it on his forehead i know people that go to other churches that's fine but what they don't know is they're sitting under trinitarian doctrine that allows them never deceive jesus as a kinsmen redeemer what did jesus defeat satan with the word he didn't use anything else but the word who really when you look at it what what this why did he open the seals the seals was nothing but the revealing of the son of perdition it showed him from his journey after the resurrection all down through the church how he took the church captive how he built systems how he took god's mind from the people what the battles for the battles the battles for him he that's why he he fortified him he fortified him in in the in the word because he knew he knew about the warfare that was coming so now we're in this warfare we're in this battle and i'd like just to close again reading a few more statements from the the message the contest now the contest is a test of strength right it's a test of uh of of strength so uh it's like taking our brother here he's a uh he gave up a famous basketball career he could have probably made the nba all-stars we might as well make it sound good right brother you know he had a college scholarship he's a son of god either went on to perfection no matter what he does but he gave that up but we could use basketball for an example now if he was playing basketball against silas here that wouldn't be much of a contest for you would it how would you like if that was your game every day you know what i mean i mean that would wouldn't prove you're a basketball player it'd prove you're like some kind of psycho bully that's no test of strength you know what i mean it's like you know it it would be no test of strength for me to get in the boxing ring with uh uh brother chris harris you know who benches 450 pounds and okay that would that would be no strength come on chris i mean i mean it wouldn't be a contest right it wouldn't be it wouldn't be anything i mean if the basketball hoop was only this tall you know i could dunk it but it makes a difference when it's 10 feet tall and i ain't no web you know you know who he is i'm glad you don't he was only four foot eight or five foot two and could dunk it so but i want to point out something to you is that if it's going to be a battle in a test of strength you understand then there's got to be if it's a test of strength then it's got to be equally it's got to be an equal challenge i read the article about uh professional athletes and and and why that there's such a a a desire in them to compete in the olympics and every year the olympics becomes a political thing we're going to boycott the olympics we're not going to send our athletes you know like the athletes don't care they want the test they want the challenge of proving that they're the best they train for it they train for the challenge they change for the contest they they train to for so that they can have the proof of the ability that they possess and with with with a basket only four feet tall and uh fighting uh uh a a little fella there's no challenge in that there's no contest in that there's no way to prove that you have any ability that you possess any talent that you have any strength that you're up for the challenge they say pro golfers now are becoming bored with the sport because there's not enough challenge in for it anymore they're tired of low scores those guys they they have a certain score and they hit 12 14 18 points below it that they they say we need a way to make it more difficult more challenging because there's no longer a test there's nothing there to push them to the next level if you knew you were going up against somebody that was all league and all national and really good you'd study him you'd look at his move you watch his game that's what the pros do right they go there and they look at he says that's what a general does he studies the tactics let me ask you honestly how many of you have studied the tactics of the enemy lately how many of you got out of your car in the parking lot starting to head to the school and say i wonder what satan's going to throw on me today what's his tactics what's it been to use how is he going to meet me where's his trap it's there but then without the challenge without with with without if i could say this in equal and opposite strength there becomes no test of strength so in the arm wrestling between our brother and our little brother there would be no test of strength there now me and silas might be a test of strength i want you to understand that now let's go back to what we heard god knew in the beginning what the attack of the enemy would be so he provided for them the very best that he could in other words he provided for them something that would bring them to the same strength level of whom that they were battling because if he didn't they would fail so he had to restore back to the believer their weapon which was the weapon that he gave them in the first place but they had left that through reasoning they kept reasoning the word out they kept reasoning parts of the word out they kept tearing pages of the bible out because they didn't fit the days of miracles have passed that was for them there's no such god doesn't care whether you do live a certain way he doesn't care about this they drank in the bible you know what i mean they did this tearing pages out why the new age bible now is no bigger than this i had a man tell me we don't read the old testament well the old testament is the description of jesus how can you throw out the old testament and he said search the scriptures because they would speak about me in other words it's just like these people they say they do it but if they read it they wouldn't be doing what they do how can you throw out the old testament when jesus said search it they've left the what they've left the word so in closing this morning we see if i can find i'd like to say this in closing this morning because i want you to understand that about this battle that we're in now and how he knew it was coming and how it's destroying the church how it's how people are falling away because they got out of fellowship they got out of hearing the gospel why why church why preachers it's not you can listen to tapes at home and you know i believe it and i believe in us listening to tapes together and i believe in you reading your bible and i believe in us reading it together but we come to be so that the holy spirit can bring us in remembrance of those things which were sad so you can hear the word of god to fight your battle a body fitted and joined together but when you break away from the body and say you're no more of the body then that body's no more speaking to you and what starts to happen in your mind reasoning because there's not a present tense spirit challenging your thinking challenging your life choices exposing this the enemy that is after your mind that's what he's after he's after the way you think you get a thought going you get thinking going you come to church you come to church as an honest believer listening and you've got all this stuff going on in your head the preacher comes out he don't know what's going on in your life but also he's got this word and so he starts preaching the word he starts pointing to you what the word said he starts talking about the message reminding you who you are now you've got a voice against the voice and what would he say this is the voice of god to you this is the voice of the last day it was to restore in you the weapon not a watered-down version but the spoken word was the original seed something that would hit that gene part of you that's god in you and bring you to the battle it never was the escape of the war people and that brother graham said he said oh once you become a christian the devil no he says i know there's a devil i fight him every day well let's just close with this this morning and i i i trust that it will finally bring to you what the point of it is that we are in it it's on it's his tactic this virus has caused everybody to start rethinking everything reinvent reasoning reinvent thought reinvent our country reinvent the world reinvent rethink we've got to rethink this no you don't have to rethink you've got to quit thinking that's your problem you think too much you ever meet everybody overthinks everything i'm the worst person to know if you overthink everything because i make random statements and you'll dwell for days what did he mean by that what did he think about this did i do something wrong you can't remember how many apologies i get i'm thinking what did i offend you now i'm running around what did i do what did i do oh my goodness what did i say did i do it again i know i couldn't i can't imagine what it is and i'm always i'm in all in this thing why because reasoning breeds what reasoning it is the plague it was to get us to rethink everything rethink divine healing rethink laying on of hands well the only ministries that that uh really grew during this pandemic was the brothers who had six foot arms how long is your arm because i need someone to lay hands on me you know i i might be saying it lightheartedly but how many ever considered that satan's trying to get changed the way you think he's succeeding he's succeeding in the message these guys falling away was well instrumented by satan he knew they weren't believers he knew they didn't have seed but the scripture said they'll come in amongst you but there are spots in your feast and then they fall back and what's all they got to say reason reason reason reasoning try to figure the cloud out try to figure this out try to figure to figure that out try to figure all these things things out but now listen to this now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word he's going to study our strategy with the word now that's what he's going to fight right he never attacks you as a person he attacks the word what if the prophet god said satan's whole journey is to discredit god's word it can't be the same that it was 2 000 years ago we're not the same the word can't be sane we progressed the word has to be progressed you don't think they think the word got to progress how many bibles are there now the new living hippie bible you know the the new you know the new living this the the old traditional the mild traditional the bible without any of these or the outs you know the there's the what they call the female bible where every place is she instead of he god's neither male nor female how ignorant can man be oh you don't think you're ignorant where do you think you've learned everything you know from some other ignorant man before you and the only reason he's teaching you anything to begin with is so you can keep his kingdom going he's got the whole world tied together now we always wondered how is satan going to rule the earth science education everybody has got a phone and has got their face in it i saw a news thing where something on youtube went to 10 billion what do they call it hits is that what it's called a hit views 10 billion views i i forget that's five times the number that means every person on earth has heard it five times [Music] i bet you everyone in here knows the baby shark and the mommy shark and the daddy shark you know what the best part about the whole song is is the truth of it run oh you don't think he's getting our minds why do you think he came back to restore the weapon now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word and now satan studies that all out so perfectly tell when he come to eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason with the word now i hope you get this right here to reason with the word now you never want to reason with god's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you can't figure out god so god is the word and it's made to believe here eat this box of kleenex for me well it's not made to eat you know eat eat this pen it'll make you sick it's not made to eat it wasn't made that way i mean can i can that set in god never made it to where it could be reasoned he never made it where it could be figured out he never made it where you could take your mind and make any sense of it because the word of god doesn't make sense why did he choose me you've heard my testimony but you don't know my life i can't testify how bad my life was because the scripture says don't even speak of those things which are done in darkness it's not made to reason he says it's only made to believe the only way you can get it to work is to believe it you can't figure it out it don't make sense it just don't make sense it's made to believe and that's our strength so if it's going to be a test of strength he had to restore our weapon because that is our strength it's the only way we're going to be able to fight them just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind and we just take the word so we see that the word isn't made to be thought through there's no elements in it that connect with the mind and now we can see when men have taken the word and connected it with their mind what did they come up with 900 different denominations three gods two gods all kinds of stuff because the word is not made to reason it's only made to believe it because he said it you can't even figure out how is he going to do it i don't know but he what said so so in this great hour that we're living in where satan's after our minds trying to get us to think all this stuff out god is trying to restore back to us our weapon he says what is it this is paragraph 30 out of the contest and the paragraph i just got finished reading was paragraph 15. what is it it's actually a power god is a power and satan is satan reasoning is a power so if you take reasoning you take the power that reasoning gives you and those who have good reasoning and can reason begin to have power over other people's minds reasoning is contagious so if i'm after your mind and i come with reasoning and you accept my reasoning now you are going to pass on my reasoning what's the reason you guys do this and you track it all the way back to the beginning and you'll find out it was someone that didn't know nothing in the first place oh you re you did do you hear me reasoning's the plague that's what came with coven 19 reasoning insane reasoning nuts insane the whole world's gone insane reasoning came up with it all kinds of reasonings but what was the answer to colvin 19 i've got it it's the word of god it is but what did he want to do he wanted us to forsake ourselves assembling together we did everything we reasoned it out we thought well we'll be a good neighbor we'll just let you know we'll just abide by them for we which we thought was just a couple weeks and everything and time we finally figured out they're pulling one over on us separating us from one another separating us from fellowship don't worry if the lord allows us to build the new church we will have a quarantine area you're not allowed in it i've already seen what god's done for you so you can't get away with no excuse like that what is it it's actually a power god is a power and satan and satan is satan if you don't believe in the devil when i first got started i run headlong into him every day don't tell me there's no devil because i know better i have to fight with him every day so i know there's a devil and you must be trained when you meet him not trained in psychology not trained in education but trained by the holy spirit god's power in his word to make it manifest know your enemy you must be trained in god's power to make it manifest you know that's corinthians ii corinthians 3 16. let me just read that to you for a a quick uh reading here real quick 3 16. did i get it second corinthians yeah 3 16. well i thought it was second corinthians 3 16. maybe not well it's not i must have wrote it down wrong but anyway the scripture says that we we fight spiritual wickedness in high places and like oh i just got to have that scripture i don't know what i did with it where are you my scripture i know you're here somewhere i i wrote it down here uh well typical i'm not totally senile yet but i'm getting close but he says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so it's the revealed word that is the power the spirit word is the power that we've got to be trained in the power of god's spirit to make the word manifest i don't know if i can let that sink in but you've got to be trained in knowing that there's a power a spirit in the word it's the spirit power in the word to make it manifest so we're not trained by the word alone as letter we're trained with i sav that we can see the power of god's word making it manifest god allowed satan to do what he's doing so he could make his word manifest he allowed satan to do what he could do so he could provide a challenge of strength to the church to prove that she was this elect lady to prove to you that you're a christian that you're a believer that you can say no you can't be deceived he can't talk you into anything this eve will not listen the spirit killeth he said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the the spirit that makes the word real how many know and see how real this message is he says now i i would like to stand here now and lay into that and go back through the bible and show you man back there this paragraph 31 who come face to face with how in the contest against the enemy they fortified themselves by the word of god noah had an experience of it and he knew that god told him it was going to rain and the contest was on between science and the word of god science says it can't happen god said it will amen you don't think there was a battle going on in noah's mind the same thing exists today it will happen it does happen there is a devil jesus cast them out and he gave his church authority to do so cast out devils in my name he cast seven devils out of a pretty woman one day he said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walks in dry places returning back then bringing seven other devils with him now let's just put the devil and use another word there reasons he brings seven other reasonings how many times god told us not to do something we know it's not right we know what the word said and then he gives a reason and you cast that reason out and here he comes with seven better reasons all these other little voices oh you got to look back at the history of it you know and and and this and i i'll just say it like this it's just like this brother ram told the story of the guy who picked up the snake because it was cold and he put the snake in his pocket and when he got warm and everything he reached in his pocket to let the snake out and the snake bit him and he said snake i saved your life why did you bite me and he said you knew i was a snake when you put me in your pocket but what took place poor little snake he's cold i'll put the steak in my pocket surely he'll appreciate all that i've done for him you invite a thief into your house you know he's a thief and in your mind you think you're going to reform him he'll rob you he's a thief to begin with he was made a thief and the only way he won't become a thief is when he hears the word of god and it transforms him from a thief from a pig to a lamb but until the miracle he's a thief let us read on the same thing exists today but jesus cast the seven deals out he said and when an unclean spirit is god on mount he walks in dry places returning back and brings back seven other devils with him now that goes to show that if a man was claimed of devils there was something was in him had gone out a devil had gone out now when the devil moved out that gives god an opportunity to move in so when he goes out let the holy spirit come in don't just leave it there see reasoning that's where he starts reasoning right there all you don't need anymore i'm gone don't worry about me and it's him doing all the talking if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're going to be worse off than ever but get that place where satan once lived in occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of god and then you'll have the strength of god's word in you manifested and cast out devils cast out reasoning every time you hear the word devil remember reasoning goes with it because that's his tactic that's what he always uses i'm talking this morning about the restoration of the weapon the respiration of god's thinking in his children this eve has got to get the same weapon that that eve had and use it she's got to stand against the reasoning so he's back disguised himself as the great medical deliverer of the world people say oh we're all in this together no we're not i ain't joining your pot my safety does not lie in this cd what is it center of d does he cdc yeah i got a good thought for that crooked devil center let the holy spirit come in don't just leave it there you'll be worse off than ever but get that place where satan once lived and occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of god and then you'll have strength of god's word in you manifested and cast out devils the contest is on the evening lights are shining god's holy spirit is present and now it's just about three minutes until time that the whistles are going to blow it'll be midnight how many remembers he called this age three minutes to midnight let's leave the building and go our different places and our homes and meet outside and meet the world let's not go as we have in former times let us go in the power of his resurrection let us go with the same power that raised him from the dead where was that power where was the power that raised him from the dead it was in the scripture that said i shall not let my holy one see corruption jesus went to the grave knowing that the word said that he would not let his holy one seek corruption that's why he could say destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up why because it was spoken it is written that's what he's trying to restore to you tomorrow this morning that's what he's trying to restore to the pride that's what he's trying to give back to her he's trying to give her back her weapon not theology not just the history of malachi 4 5 not just the understanding of the mysteries but the power to be resurrected let's go on the power of his resurrection let's go in the name of jesus christ with a banner lifted high with faith in his word to handle the two-edged sword with the shield and the full armor of god on to meet the enemy because he's getting stronger and more powerful every day and as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against him who's the standard of god this morning who does he raise up to stand against him he raises up his elect and what can he give her to defeat him the same thing that's worked from the beginning the atom of his word he restores back to her the weapon he's getting stronger he's been getting stronger and more and more powerful every day as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raise it up a standard against him if we have to come to the end of these things and the mysteries of god has been completed with us we're looking for more strength a rapturing strength to meet a worse force because he's gaining strength we have to meet a worse force you're not going to fight the same old devil he's a new devil and new power and new strength and new strategy and new reasonings this morning we're just looking at what he's just done we're looking at his tactics and look what he says that'll rapture the church and take her into glory we must have it let us meet security with a challenge like we are the servants of the living god like shadrach meshach and abednego of old we will not bow to the devil of this world and take back this thing that we've talked about let us press the battle no other age is as dark as this age no other age is as deceiving as this age but god is restored back to us our weapon so we can meet the challenge of strength he's gained more power we gain more power how does it give us that power by revealing his word to us pray for revelation he reveals the power to you i hope that clock's not right that's what happens when i don't go to church for a long time i just got to preach but anyway god bless you this morning i hope you see the fight i hope you see the battle god bless you [Applause] amen god bless
