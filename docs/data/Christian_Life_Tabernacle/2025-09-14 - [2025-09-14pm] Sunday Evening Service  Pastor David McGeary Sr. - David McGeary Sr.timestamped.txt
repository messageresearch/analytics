[25:29] Father, may we start
[25:31] living, believing, and thinking
[25:34] supernatural.
[25:36] Father, that what you've placed with us,
[25:39] you've freely given. You've told us to
[25:42] freely give. Father, may we let all
[25:45] those that we come in contact know the
[25:48] joy and peace of your love, the victory
[25:52] of your cross, the forgiveness of your
[25:55] blood, the filling of your Holy Spirit.
[25:58] We ask you to bless us in Jesus' name we
[26:01] pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your
[26:04] Bibles, let's turn over to uh I'd like
[26:08] to read Psalm of 43.
[26:15] Psalm 43. I I I thought this was a very
[26:20] uh beautiful little psalm
[26:23] and u talking about why should you be
[26:27] cast down. Huh? Just think if God be for
[26:31] you, who can it be against you? you
[26:33] know, um it says, "Judge me, oh God, and
[26:39] plead my cause against the ungodly
[26:43] nation. Oh, deliver me from the
[26:47] deceitful and unjust man. For thou art
[26:53] the God of my strength.
[26:56] Why dust thou cast me off?
[27:00] Why go I mourning because of the
[27:04] oppression of the enemy?
[27:07] Oh, send out thy light and thy truth.
[27:12] Let them lead me. Let them bring me unto
[27:17] the holy hill and to the tabernacles.
[27:21] Then I will go unto the altar of God.
[27:26] unto God my exceedingly joy. Yay, upon
[27:30] the harp I will praise thee, oh God, my
[27:34] God, why art thou cast down, oh my soul,
[27:39] why art thou disquitened within me? Hope
[27:43] in God, for I shall yet praise him who
[27:47] is the health of my continents and my
[27:51] God. God bless you. You may be seated.
[28:00] Well, it looks like we ran off quite a
[28:02] few this morning. Amen. So, I guess that
[28:05] we're getting down to rapturing numbers
[28:08] around here.
[28:10] Uh so, that's okay. That's okay. Uh you
[28:16] know, you you got to if there's only one
[28:18] going, it's me. So, there might be one
[28:20] or two spots left. You just you got to
[28:23] do your best to get them. But but that's
[28:26] okay. I'm sure that uh uh you know, I
[28:29] mean, the cowboy game got over early.
[28:32] I'd expect some people to be in here
[28:35] thanking the Lord. I you know, but uh
[28:38] you know, that's how things go. Uh so
[28:41] what we want to do is we want to pick up
[28:43] to where we left off this morning and
[28:46] finish this portion of tape. Now this
[28:50] this portion of tape is very significant
[28:55] in the life of brother Brandham and and
[28:58] what I hope that you can see through
[29:02] what's going on what he's preaching
[29:05] about is the struggle that he is going
[29:11] through
[29:13] trying to find the will of the Lord for
[29:16] his life. the the questioning, the
[29:20] personal questioning of what's
[29:23] transpiring in his positioning
[29:27] and what that he's going through and and
[29:31] uh and and he begins to speak about how
[29:36] he doesn't know what's going on or what
[29:39] to do or how to go forward, you know,
[29:41] and to me that's comforting because we
[29:45] go through those things And you'll hear
[29:48] him in this message talk about sweating
[29:52] it out, how he's got to sweat it out.
[29:54] And those things are marvelous.
[29:57] The thing we know being on this side of
[30:00] history, this was preached in 1962,
[30:05] pretty soon the the messages serves as
[30:08] this the time. And these messages and
[30:11] these visions are starting to weigh
[30:13] heavy on them. He he explains what how
[30:17] his nature has brought him to the place
[30:21] that he just can't seem to settle down.
[30:25] You know, he'll talk about that
[30:27] nervousness about all those things. And
[30:30] so I I think it's important that we
[30:33] grasp this along with what he he's
[30:37] talking about is is the future and the
[30:42] the future for the church. So he's
[30:46] almost at the place that we are talking
[30:49] about where do we go from here?
[30:54] Okay. So as as we and then you'll see
[30:58] the questions he asks, the things that
[31:02] come up to him, the things that he he
[31:05] witnesses, you know, uh how that the
[31:09] light seems to be dimming down, how that
[31:11] the revival, how that he's beginning to
[31:14] feel the pressure of the door shutting
[31:18] and he wants to know, you know, what he
[31:20] can do. He you'll notice that he will
[31:24] sense and he expresses this. He senses
[31:28] that there's a predestinated people to
[31:32] receive what he's preached. So you you
[31:35] understand, let me just give you a
[31:37] little outside history. Around this
[31:40] time, Brother Brennan's biggest
[31:41] supporters were the full gospel
[31:44] businessmen. Brother Carl Williams kept
[31:47] that door open to him. And many of you
[31:50] know we've had Earl Williams here. Uh
[31:52] you know Earl Williams is a very very
[31:54] close friend of mine and and I got to
[31:57] very many wonderful testimonies. But
[32:00] what was happening is is that
[32:04] the full gospel business and begin to
[32:06] start leaning
[32:08] and we're supporting and were excited
[32:13] about Amy Simple McFersonson's
[32:16] ministry.
[32:18] And so now here, Brother Brandham's
[32:21] preached against a woman preacher. He's
[32:24] poured his heart out and now they're
[32:26] attracted
[32:28] to her type of ministry. And so all
[32:34] these things are going on. He's
[32:35] wondering what's his future, you know,
[32:37] and he makes a statement. And I'd like
[32:40] to maybe read this statement because I I
[32:44] I wanted to I thought it was a very um I
[32:50] I hope that I I can find it here. Um
[32:56] he says now what now what I think
[33:01] would be this brethren and I'd like in
[33:04] the church now my ministry the best of
[33:08] my thinking four things can be done and
[33:12] it might not be either four but that's
[33:16] the only outlook I can think of if the
[33:20] one that spoke to me down at the river.
[33:25] This is all that was left for the
[33:28] gentile
[33:30] church. And so this is where he's come
[33:33] to. If what the angel spoke to me at the
[33:35] river is that your message for will
[33:39] forrun the coming the second coming of
[33:42] the Lord, then this
[33:45] ministry is all that is left for the
[33:49] gentile church.
[33:51] And so now he's going to go because he
[33:54] doesn't know where this is taking him.
[33:56] We know where it's taking him. It's
[33:58] taking him to Tucson, Arizona, where
[34:01] he's going to climb a mountain and he's
[34:04] going to get a sword in his hand and
[34:06] he's going to know this is the king's
[34:08] sword and he knows the seals are now
[34:11] going to be opened up.
[34:13] uh a brother brought to me uh a a
[34:16] wonderful
[34:18] uh understanding how that they were uh
[34:22] they were uh listening to running from
[34:25] the presence of the Lord. Brother Chris
[34:28] shared this with me and he said in that
[34:30] message, Brother Brandham looked out at
[34:32] the people and he says, "I'm not running
[34:34] to Nineveh."
[34:37] Okay? In other words,
[34:40] I'm going to deliver the message. And
[34:42] then he went on to preach marriage and
[34:44] divorce and many of the sermons that
[34:47] that followed that he was now pouring
[34:51] out his heart. So, he's in a balance.
[34:53] What am I going to do? What am I
[34:55] supposed to do? Where's my ministry
[34:57] going forward? I've been doing
[34:58] evangelism. I've been praying for the
[35:01] sick. I've I've been going to meetings.
[35:03] I've been having altar calls. But that's
[35:06] not what I'm called for. what I'm called
[35:08] to for is to go get the word of the Lord
[35:10] and bring the word of the Lord and say
[35:12] thus sayaith the Lord. So he's fixing to
[35:15] go into that and and to the seals. But
[35:18] if you can understand the struggle
[35:21] because I believe not only is the
[35:23] message doctrinally correct but I and as
[35:28] I said before it's a life lesson. You
[35:31] understand you learn how things work by
[35:35] listening to it. how how actually life
[35:40] itself operates and and what it takes.
[35:45] Like he said, we get impatient. We get
[35:48] ahead of God. We get all things messed
[35:51] up and then we've got to wait till the
[35:54] work catches up. In other words, God's
[35:57] got a time to do things. So,
[36:01] this this this is really good. It's very
[36:04] intimate. It's very I think the the the
[36:09] picture behind it is that brother Bram's
[36:12] having a men's meeting. Most of it is
[36:14] the men of the church and they're
[36:17] deciding whether they want to build a
[36:19] church. Now brother Bram's pouring out
[36:21] his heart. He said the reason he built
[36:23] the church, remember this morning, was
[36:26] because of the the people needed a place
[36:29] to go. this burden's falling on him and
[36:32] you'll see him unfold the burden, the
[36:35] vision and all the things that take
[36:37] place. So this is the last 34 minutes of
[36:41] what we played this morning. And you say
[36:44] why
[36:45] why this now? Well, I believe this is
[36:48] all orchestrated by the will of God.
[36:52] I I just believe that and I believe that
[36:55] this circumstance
[36:58] and I I hope that you can accept this
[37:02] for the way it's on my heart.
[37:04] Many of the circumstances that our
[37:07] prophet comes into, the church comes
[37:10] into, not the same exact instances,
[37:15] but the struggle, the temptations, the
[37:19] battle, and and and so he laid the way.
[37:24] So if we suffer with him, so many of the
[37:27] things, the pressures and the demons and
[37:31] the things that fought him because he
[37:35] believed the message are the same things
[37:38] that come after us because we follow the
[37:42] message. I hope you understand that. And
[37:45] he said that he said, "Satan's desire to
[37:47] sift thee of sand, but I have prayed for
[37:50] you." So we're we're we're in good
[37:52] hands. So I hope you enjoy this. It's
[37:54] wonderful. It's very enlightening. And
[37:57] we know the answer to the question, of
[38:00] course, is that he goes on, opens the
[38:02] seals, receives the third pole, and goes
[38:06] on to deliver the message of the hour.
[38:10] Um, which still today stands as the
[38:15] unadulterated word of God. People say,
[38:18] "Well, Brother Brandon's been gone for
[38:20] 50 years." Well, the truth is the truth.
[38:24] It was the truth in the beginning. It'll
[38:26] be the truth in a hundred years. If if
[38:29] it took a hundred years, God didn't come
[38:31] back from a hundred years. God's still
[38:32] not a trinity. Baptism in Jesus' name
[38:36] still the way. Being filled with his
[38:39] spirit is still the way that a believer
[38:42] comes. The blood is the only thing that
[38:44] still forgives your sins.
[38:47] None of that changes. the truth of God's
[38:50] word will never change. Amen. So, we
[38:53] just trust that we you believe this and
[38:56] enjoy this and and and so you kind I
[39:02] give my heart this morning. And so,
[39:05] we're going to start
[39:07] going forward
[39:09] now that we've went back,
[39:13] right? And we went back. We established
[39:16] where we're going to go forward on of
[39:18] what we're going to go forward with,
[39:21] where we want to put our efforts as a
[39:24] body. And we want to be in service for
[39:29] the lost, for the sick, for the dying,
[39:33] for the needy. We want to be focused
[39:37] where we can, our hand can reach. And
[39:40] not where our mouth can reach, but where
[39:42] our hand can reach. Oh, to be God's hand
[39:46] extended, reaching out to fallen man.
[39:51] Amen. So, God bless you this morning or
[39:54] this evening as we finish up this uh
[39:57] first half of uh out of the message uh
[40:03] called and we're going to start on
[40:04] paragraph 55. And I I I just trust
[40:08] you'll be as blessed as I was. Thank
[40:10] you.
[40:12] Now what I would think would be this
[40:15] brethren
[40:17] at like in the church here now I the my
[40:22] ministry
[40:24] has the best amount of thinking four
[40:27] things that can be done and it might not
[40:30] be either four that's the only outlook I
[40:32] can think of if that one has spoke to me
[40:35] down there on the river if this is all
[40:38] that was left for the gentile church
[40:40] which we realize In Revelations, it says
[40:43] one, two, three chapters to the church.
[40:46] The church goes up in the fourth
[40:48] chapter. It does not return anymore to
[40:51] the 19th chapter. That's after the
[40:53] tribulation period
[40:55] &gt;&gt; when God calls out the Jews. That's
[40:57] right. And like Enoch, he went up before
[41:01] one drop of rain ever hit the earth. It
[41:04] was gone. Then the tribulation set in.
[41:07] See, Noah was in the ark before any
[41:10] tribulation set in. Lot was out of Sodom
[41:14] before any tribulation set in. See, and
[41:16] the church will be gone before any
[41:19] tribulation period. Now during the
[41:21] tribulation that will be the sleeping
[41:24] virgin will be hunted down by the dragon
[41:30] spurts water from his mouth which it
[41:32] means multitudes and people armies
[41:34] that'll search down and take this woman
[41:38] uh uh remnant of her seed and will kill
[41:41] her. Now
[41:44] that will be in the tribulation period
[41:46] but the church will go home. Now, if
[41:51] if that take would take place tomorrow,
[41:54] it wouldn't hinder some miskeeping on
[41:56] today. Let's make today count. Now,
[42:01] what I think down there, if that angel
[42:05] that said those words to me said, as
[42:08] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[42:12] first coming of Christ, see, your
[42:15] message
[42:17] has to take this message and it would
[42:21] forerun the second coming of Christ.
[42:24] Well, if this has been it,
[42:27] and we're real real close, brethren,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; because the hour and the light of the
[42:34] message just about gone out. Did you
[42:37] notice when Pentecost fell and those
[42:39] brothers was filled at Pentecost with
[42:41] the Holy Ghost, it wasn't hardly any
[42:44] time until the message had be to dim
[42:47] down and they begin to set up churches
[42:49] the whole port for Christ, expecting him
[42:51] to come. Well, that's the same thing is
[42:54] taking place today. If the scripture is
[42:56] true, I will restore, sayeth the Lord,
[42:59] all that the palm of worm and cake of
[43:01] worm has eaten. Now,
[43:05] if that be it, if that is the message,
[43:09] and God forgive me, I I do not know if
[43:12] that's it, then the time is close to
[43:15] hand really because the message is over.
[43:18] And the other night I was dreaming that
[43:20] I went to have discernment where a great
[43:23] host of my friends are gathered,
[43:26] thousands of them in a meeting. There's
[43:28] a fellow come got me and Billy usually
[43:31] comes gets me because he don't talk to
[43:32] me. This man just talked to Blue Street
[43:35] and before I got over there all the
[43:37] anointing was gone from me for it. And
[43:39] then I said, "Well, I'll just go over
[43:40] there and and preach the message of
[43:43] telling those people, don't fool those
[43:45] denominations and so forth and come out
[43:47] like this." And when I got to the
[43:49] platform, that had left me.
[43:53] I don't know what it meant, but I was
[43:55] going on.
[43:57] I just don't know.
[44:00] It could be the end of my road. It could
[44:04] be the coming of the Lord.
[44:07] It could be the change of the day. It
[44:10] could be the coming of that mighty one
[44:12] if it's to be another besides what's
[44:14] already come. It could be that
[44:17] all those things we'd have to draw from.
[44:21] It would be and as I stand here tonight
[44:24] before God and you, brethren, I don't
[44:26] know. I couldn't tell you. If I did, I'd
[44:29] tell you. Or I wouldn't mention bring
[44:31] anything up like this. If I didn't know
[44:32] which way if I know which way the thing
[44:35] was going, I' i'd say it. But I don't
[44:38] know. I can't tell. I'm going right now
[44:40] on meetings without one speck of
[44:41] leading. I'm going because I don't want
[44:44] to set up there. I I I like to get out
[44:48] in the woods as well as anybody.
[44:52] If I'm wrong in this, God forgive me.
[44:56] There's three things could happen to me.
[44:59] It's either the end of my road and let
[45:03] this other one come on. I've opened up
[45:05] the road for him to take over. Remember,
[45:08] the one that comes to preach will be on
[45:12] the word restoring the faith of the
[45:14] children back to the fathers. It could
[45:17] be the end of my role.
[45:20] It could be
[45:22] that he's changing my ministry back into
[45:25] evangelism for overseas.
[45:29] Or it could be that he's not going to
[45:33] call me anymore for an evangelist and
[45:36] he's taking me into the wilderness
[45:38] somewhere to anoint me
[45:41] to send me forth
[45:44] like the promised one is to come. I
[45:46] think
[45:49] that could be any of those things.
[45:52] I cannot go on the way I've been going
[45:56] because I'm the people
[45:59] has believe me I I have to say this I
[46:01] said before man the people many times
[46:05] regard me as being a prophet I do not
[46:09] regard myself that no sir I do not I
[46:12] have I don't say that to be humble I say
[46:14] that to be truthful I do not regard
[46:17] myself to be a prophet of the Lord I I
[46:22] that honor. I believe that the Lord has
[46:25] used me and little special things to
[46:29] help maybe lay a foundation
[46:32] for a prophet that will come. But a
[46:35] prophet doesn't operate the way I
[46:38] operate. Now you know that a prophet
[46:42] isn't an evangelist
[46:45] and an evangelist isn't a prophet.
[46:48] A pastor isn't a evangelist, then a
[46:52] evangelist isn't a pastor.
[46:54] But God has set in the church, first
[46:57] apostles, then prophets, then teachers,
[46:59] then pastors, and so forth. God set them
[47:02] in the church and God gave them an
[47:04] office. But the morning when I laid that
[47:07] cornerstone because, now if you're
[47:10] spiritual, you get it.
[47:13] because of the cry of the people.
[47:16] If you could break that out or take the
[47:18] book and read it, it said, "Do the work
[47:21] of an evangelist."
[47:24] Didn't call me to be evangelist, but
[47:27] said, "Do the work of an evangelist, for
[47:29] the time will come when they will not
[47:31] endure sound doctrine,
[47:34] but for heap themselves together
[47:36] teachers having ancient ears, and shall
[47:38] turn from truth to fables."
[47:41] See, quoted that scripture and told me
[47:43] where to find it. Said it three times.
[47:46] And I got the Bible and turned to where
[47:48] he told me and there it was. And now you
[47:50] know about the two buckets of the
[47:51] Pentecostal oneness and the Pentecostal
[47:53] assemblies. I never crossed them. I
[47:56] planted their own trees right where they
[47:57] were because I think they're both wrong.
[48:00] But out of it, I was at the cross at the
[48:04] harvest.
[48:06] God respects anybody who's sincere.
[48:09] Peter said that he perceived that God
[48:12] was no respected person. All nations
[48:13] calling when on the house of Cornelius
[48:16] when they received the Holy Ghost like
[48:17] they did at the beginning. See God is no
[48:20] respective person. We see a person
[48:22] deeply and sincerely he can be sincerely
[48:24] wrong. But if he is sincerely, God will
[48:26] lead him to the light somewhere. He'll
[48:28] come to it because God's obligated to do
[48:30] that. And we think about the coming of
[48:33] the Lord being such a a great thing and
[48:35] the message no more than it went. And
[48:37] remember, there's a predestinated group
[48:40] to be here when the Lord returns. And it
[48:42] might not be over a dozen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; We don't know. It might be 100 million,
[48:48] might be 10,000.
[48:50] But if the predestinated
[48:52] will hear the message and believe it, if
[48:55] it's the message sent of God, which we
[48:57] believe it to be. Now,
[49:00] here we are then, right up here to the
[49:02] end of the time when if God did call me,
[49:06] now listen, this is not to be repeated.
[49:08] If he did call me to be his prophet,
[49:12] then I'm certainly not holding the
[49:13] office of one. Prophets don't
[49:16] evangelize.
[49:18] A prophet hides himself in the
[49:21] wilderness alone with God until he gets
[49:24] exactly directly what God wants him
[49:26] doing. and he stomps right out and gives
[49:28] his message and back into the wilderness
[49:30] he goes again.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; He's not an evangelist holding meetings
[49:35] and getting cooperations and all these
[49:38] things like evangelists do. He don't
[49:41] teach like evangelist. He has thus
[49:44] sayaeth the Lord and that's it and
[49:45] that's all. He gives it out and let the
[49:49] chips fall where it will and then way he
[49:51] goes again.
[49:53] Nobody knows where he's at. is in
[49:54] isolation somewhere. Now I cannot or if
[49:59] he's called me to be that I cannot be an
[50:02] evangelist
[50:04] and if he's called me to be evangelist I
[50:07] cannot be a prophet.
[50:09] Now you get what I mean?
[50:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. I've done
[50:14] reverently when he told me first about
[50:16] be holding people's hand and praying for
[50:18] them then know the secret of their heart
[50:20] and all these different things. And
[50:21] brethren that's infallible. You know
[50:23] that's to be the truth. Every one of you
[50:25] knows that. See, and how he told me it
[50:27] would blast across the world. And it's
[50:28] done it just exactly. Every nation under
[50:31] the heavens has everywhere. Newspapers,
[50:36] tape recordings everywhere. I don't know
[50:38] how it's ever done it, but throughout
[50:40] all the world, letters coming in and
[50:42] people from way down and pileing in the
[50:44] pot and tops back in there. How those
[50:47] missionaries is crowded back in there
[50:49] with those tapes and giving that
[50:51] interpretation of the word. And uh we
[50:52] hear from all over the world around the
[50:55] world. Now the the church is
[50:58] predestinated universally everywhere.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Be two in the bed, two in the field.
[51:02] See, take one and leave one. Now,
[51:07] as I have done the work of an
[51:09] evangelist,
[51:11] and here's my plea. If that is pleasing
[51:14] to God and I've done the work all right,
[51:17] trusting I have pleased him, asking
[51:20] forgiveness for all my mistakes,
[51:22] then he may be calling me from the field
[51:26] of evangelism
[51:28] to be his prophet.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Then if it is, I'll leave evangelism.
[51:35] But if he calls me to be a prophet, I
[51:38] cannot be an evangelist.
[51:40] If I'm to be a basis, I cannot be a
[51:43] prophet.
[51:45] I'm mixing the two offices. That's where
[51:48] I've always fussed about standing on the
[51:51] platform. It's never been good,
[51:52] successful. God has used it, but I've
[51:55] never thought it was his direct will.
[51:57] It's been his permissive will. Stand on
[52:00] the platform. A vision or two will knock
[52:02] you out almost. See? And then if you
[52:06] tell this person how to straighten
[52:08] himself up and what to do and then the
[52:11] next person stands there, he's expecting
[52:13] the same thing and you can't tell him
[52:15] unless something tells you to tell him.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And then the other people feel like
[52:20] you're a traitor or a backslider or a
[52:23] demon or something because you don't
[52:25] tell them what they want to know. See,
[52:28] that's not the office the way a prophet
[52:30] operates. A prophet stays back here till
[52:32] he stomps right into the hospital or
[52:34] wherever he's going with thus sayeth the
[52:36] Lord and say it and stomp back out
[52:38] again.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; He's no evangelist at all. He don't hold
[52:41] meetings and discuss things. He's got
[52:43] the word of the Lord for whoever he sent
[52:46] to.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; If he's sent to the White House, he
[52:48] stomps right up in front of the White
[52:50] House. It's thus sayeth the Lord.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; If it's to the governor of the state,
[52:55] whoever it is, it's thus sayeth the
[52:57] Lord. That's right.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; You don't fool around with a group of
[53:00] churches trying to get them to come in
[53:02] and take the word and preach these
[53:04] things like evangelists. He's not an
[53:05] evangelist.
[53:07] So you see, brethren, that's the reason
[53:08] I don't call myself a prophet.
[53:11] I'm not even in the office of one. See,
[53:15] now you understand what I mean. Now,
[53:16] there'd be a lot going on like that for
[53:18] a long time, but I hope to not take too
[53:20] much of your time until I get a little
[53:22] bit of this word I want to read tonight.
[53:24] Now, here's what I'm doing.
[53:28] I have never felt that I should live in
[53:31] Indiana.
[53:33] I'm a I'm a rambler.
[53:36] I don't I'll go one place I think I'll
[53:38] go over here and I'll settle down here.
[53:40] This is it. I can't do it. Want to go
[53:44] somewhere else. I think I'll go over
[53:45] here. Want to do it? My wife calls me.
[53:49] What's that song they sing about?
[53:52] Restless winds. You've heard it. I guess
[53:54] most all of you hear him saying, "Well,
[53:56] that's what she calls me. Restless
[53:58] winds." About time I get here, I think,
[54:00] boy, I just got to get home. I got to
[54:02] see the wife and kids. I just got to go
[54:04] to church once more and preach. I get
[54:06] here, come down, preach once, kiss my
[54:08] wife, and hug all the kids, get out the
[54:10] yard to cut the grass, and the airplane
[54:11] goes over. I stop, wipe the sweat off my
[54:14] face, and
[54:17] I want to go with him somewhere else. I
[54:19] got to go. Well, I think I got to go
[54:21] down there. And I I go down there. I
[54:24] preach there a while.
[54:26] Look around.
[54:29] There goes another one over. I got to go
[54:31] with him. See, there's no settling down
[54:33] place for me. I just can't do it. I'm
[54:36] restless,
[54:37] shifting place to place. Something I
[54:41] can't help it. It's something in me and
[54:45] I know that I must do it. Now, at the
[54:48] church is in its present state.
[54:51] I'd feel horrible to walk away from here
[54:54] and think of all you man sitting here
[54:57] that I believe I'll spend an eternity
[54:59] with over glory land. We got fine man,
[55:04] fine material, solid sound people. Just
[55:09] recently there's a revival broke out in
[55:11] the church here amongst the people. The
[55:13] spirit come among them begin to give
[55:15] gifts.
[55:16] I watched it as if he go off into
[55:18] fanaticism. Every time you start moving
[55:21] that way, the spirit check it. Bring it
[55:22] back here. I don't praise the Lord. See,
[55:25] if you just hold your place there,
[55:27] that's fine. See, now
[55:31] what my thoughts is is this is if it
[55:35] could be possible that when I start
[55:37] going somewhere,
[55:39] I don't know where I'm going, but I
[55:42] can't sit still. I ain't going to stay
[55:44] here.
[55:46] I just can't do it. I got to move
[55:48] somewhere.
[55:50] and I probably won't stay there, but a
[55:52] few days be moving somewhere else. I got
[55:55] to go somewhere. I don't know where I'm
[55:56] going. Neither did Abraham know where he
[55:59] was going.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; He just crossed the river and started
[56:02] off.
[56:04] That's all. I feel that what we ought to
[56:07] do here in this present time, I believe
[56:10] that we need a church. I think I think
[56:14] the house of God. You say, "Well, what
[56:16] put all that money in it if the Lord is
[56:18] going to come?" Well, what good is going
[56:20] to do to keep the money if the Lord
[56:21] comes? See, if the people designated the
[56:24] money for the church, it's our duty with
[56:27] 100% vote here and I took that night to
[56:29] build the church. So, build it. I'd say
[56:32] build it. Yes, sir. I've never expressed
[56:34] this before, but I want to do it before
[56:36] you man. Didn't want the women here
[56:38] because one less this way and that way.
[56:40] I'm trying to tell you the reason I want
[56:41] to do it. I think if the Lord's coming
[56:44] next week, let's start the church this
[56:45] week.
[56:47] Certainly, let's show him. Let's stand
[56:49] at our post of duty. Yes, sir. And then
[56:52] if we uh when the church is built up,
[56:54] why say if he's what if he's 10 years
[56:56] from now, what if he's 20 years or what
[56:58] if he's 100 years? Whatever it is, when
[57:00] he comes, that matters not. We know
[57:02] he'll be coming for us before that time
[57:04] because we can't live it out 100 years
[57:06] more. You'll be coming for us, but we
[57:09] got to leave partings behind us. And I
[57:11] thought this, why not then let the
[57:13] church board you're speaking to them
[57:15] now. Build that church. Put it up here.
[57:18] Make it nice and a nice place where the
[57:21] people can come. I'd suggest brother
[57:24] Neville be the pastor of the church. As
[57:26] long as the church suggest him being
[57:28] pastor. That's the vote of the church.
[57:30] As long as he holds a post of duty and
[57:32] stays with the faith, wants to come,
[57:34] feels the leading of the Lord, then the
[57:36] leading of the Lord for him to stay. If
[57:38] the congregation votes the same, then
[57:40] I'd say each one of these men out here,
[57:42] these other man like brother Chris and
[57:45] brother Jr. all them, as long as they
[57:48] feel their duty at that post and they're
[57:50] associated here together, you can't go
[57:52] down and meet with the Methodist, you
[57:55] have no fellowship with them,
[57:57] &gt;&gt; the Baptist,
[57:58] &gt;&gt; you go talking about speaking in tongues
[58:00] in the baptism of Jesus name, they kick
[58:02] you out that quick.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:05] You sit around there, you'd be like a a
[58:07] dove amongst a bunch of crows. You would
[58:09] have no fellowship at all. You're d I
[58:12] ain't making fun of Methodist and
[58:13] Baptist. Now remember that. I'm not
[58:15] saying that. I'm just drawing a
[58:16] comparison. And many of those Methodists
[58:18] and Baptists are a good man, godly man.
[58:22] But I'm talking about the fellowship.
[58:24] There's brother, what's his name back
[58:26] there tonight? The evangelist sitting
[58:28] back there. Brother JT Parnell, brother
[58:31] Beer, lead us brother sitting here. Some
[58:34] of many of you here man of God calling
[58:37] in your life. You can be doing
[58:39] something. Just don't sit around. Let's
[58:41] do something. You don't get but one soul
[58:44] saved. Get that one saved.
[58:47] Each one of us. Now I think this church
[58:50] if you man would when you build this
[58:53] church make this like your headquarters
[58:56] and like brother Neville here being like
[58:58] the senior elder among him. See, and
[59:02] sometimes you get a question that you
[59:04] can't discuss out with your church out
[59:07] there, then bring it in here to brother
[59:10] Neville and you all discuss it together.
[59:12] If you can't come to any decision, I'll
[59:15] be coming by pretty soon. Then we'll all
[59:17] come together with it and and then in
[59:20] there, get training in your own groups,
[59:23] other ministers, man that you see that
[59:26] has a calling in their life for the
[59:27] ministry. Train them young man. bring
[59:30] them in here to the elder. All of you
[59:32] set together in a ministerial meeting
[59:35] and there teach the deeper things of
[59:37] God. Don't go on the bad end. Keep
[59:40] someone who you can have confidence in
[59:43] to be kind of like a a leader for you.
[59:46] And then sometimes if you don't see it
[59:48] just exactly way he does go. That's all
[59:50] right. You're in the faith anyhow. Just
[59:52] move along. Maybe when we come together
[59:54] then all of us together we are pray the
[59:56] discernment of God come down and he'll
[59:58] give it just exactly what it is. you see
[1:00:00] and let us know just how to do it and in
[1:00:02] there churches can go here and training
[1:00:04] up a group of ants and if I'm in
[1:00:06] evangelistic work somewhere there's
[1:00:09] places I can place them worldwide
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; what if I was in India go back to India
[1:00:15] there I'd say to these people maybe
[1:00:17] you'd have thousands of them stay there
[1:00:19] for a week or two and they see the
[1:00:21] ministry they love it they believe it's
[1:00:23] a truth they come out of heathenism
[1:00:25] there I've got and maybe in two three
[1:00:27] weeks when it's only there two nights
[1:00:29] and maybe 100,000 converted to Christ,
[1:00:32] nowhere to go the next day, take a plane
[1:00:34] and start back to Rome, then to the
[1:00:36] United States, leave them just like
[1:00:39] sheep put out among wolves. What if I
[1:00:42] had a group of men, young man trained in
[1:00:45] the message?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, just say now wait a minute. Before
[1:00:51] I leave here, we're going to set in
[1:00:54] order these churches. I'll have a man
[1:00:57] who already telegram him. He got the
[1:00:59] money. They're on the road here right
[1:01:01] now to take over this. A good man, his
[1:01:06] two or three young men with him who will
[1:01:08] be his helpers and assistants and a
[1:01:10] church of this faith can be set there
[1:01:13] which will be a outpost in India,
[1:01:16] outpost in Germany, outpost in
[1:01:18] Switzerland. While right now we should
[1:01:21] had them all around the nation where
[1:01:23] I've been.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the message then from there
[1:01:26] comes another from another comes
[1:01:28] another. See what I mean?
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:01:32] tomorrow night or day after tomorrow
[1:01:34] night you'll see Max and Boz come down
[1:01:36] here which is my friend. You'll see just
[1:01:38] what one little crippled up Swede
[1:01:43] did over there and Tanzanica.
[1:01:47] He went in there and Matson Bose is a
[1:01:50] good man but he don't believe the faith
[1:01:52] that we believe.
[1:01:54] I've tucked him right out and tuck him
[1:01:56] and this tied him to such a place in the
[1:01:57] scripture. I say, "Matson, you're my
[1:01:59] friend. Now you're not going to jump or
[1:02:01] run. We're just going to stand here and
[1:02:02] hold one of his hands as Christian
[1:02:03] brothers and talk." See, now lay the
[1:02:06] message right to him. And he just stand
[1:02:07] there and say, "Brew Brandom, you you
[1:02:09] sure right." I said, "Now imagine, you
[1:02:12] don't believe that or you'd accept it."
[1:02:13] Well, Random, I believe what you say is
[1:02:16] the truth. Then why don't you accept it?
[1:02:18] See, just burn it right down to him and
[1:02:20] he then as soon as he gets away, he's
[1:02:22] gone.
[1:02:23] See, but just watch what that man did in
[1:02:27] his missions over there. Just one man.
[1:02:30] Course he can send right back to Chicago
[1:02:32] and pick up Burton and all the rest of
[1:02:33] them. Send them over in there like that
[1:02:34] and start to work doing. Now they're
[1:02:36] getting up into the tens of thousands
[1:02:39] of one little revival. Not a man with
[1:02:42] gifts, just a man who had enough courage
[1:02:45] to go there and start.
[1:02:48] What could have been done under this?
[1:02:52] have been ranking in the millions.
[1:02:55] Sure, we've lost that time. That's what
[1:02:58] my suggestion would be. Now, remember,
[1:03:01] in doing this, you'll find out there may
[1:03:04] be times that you'll disagree with
[1:03:06] brother so and so. You'll disagree over
[1:03:08] here. And remember, as long as you get
[1:03:10] to the spot you say, "Well, because he
[1:03:12] don't believe it just like me, I ain't
[1:03:14] going to have." Then, there's something
[1:03:15] wrong with you.
[1:03:18] It's not wrong with the other fella.
[1:03:19] It's something wrong with you. When
[1:03:21] brethren who are trying to hold together
[1:03:24] is one thing we Brandhams nine of us and
[1:03:28] we fight like pet dogs
[1:03:32] but after all when we got through
[1:03:33] fighting we were still Brandhams.
[1:03:36] One know the other was a Brandon. I know
[1:03:38] he was a Brandon. He knowed I was a
[1:03:39] brand. See but we fight. You did that in
[1:03:42] your family but they're still your
[1:03:43] brothers.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. We might differ.
[1:03:47] That's all right. But we're still one.
[1:03:50] We're one in Christ. We believe this
[1:03:52] message and let's stay with it. And I
[1:03:54] think that's the thing to do to keep on
[1:03:56] carrying on until Jesus comes. And
[1:03:59] that's what I wanted to say in that
[1:04:01] manner. And I believe if you'd have like
[1:04:04] see, you've got to be enthused with it.
[1:04:07] If you're not enthused, then there's
[1:04:09] something wrong.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. You've got
[1:04:12] let's not say, "Well, last month I was
[1:04:15] pretty well enthused, but I don't know."
[1:04:17] See, then there's something wrong
[1:04:19] somewhere. You got to be enthused all
[1:04:20] the time.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; See, and just keep punching. It's the
[1:04:24] devil trying to get you. Like I always
[1:04:26] liked uh our last president, Mr.
[1:04:30] Eisenhower. Uh I had a great admiration
[1:04:33] for uh General Eisenhower.
[1:04:36] Uh he said when we were fighting, he
[1:04:40] said there's many times we picked up a
[1:04:42] shell and throw it into the gun and
[1:04:43] pulled a hammer on it and let her fall
[1:04:45] and it snapped. It didn't go off. said
[1:04:48] we didn't surrender. Said we might have
[1:04:51] put in another one and it snapped two.
[1:04:52] Said we didn't give up. Said we kept on
[1:04:55] snapping until the one went off.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the way to win the
[1:05:00] war.
[1:05:01] Keep trying. Throw a shell in and pull
[1:05:03] it.
[1:05:05] You got a purpose, a target to hit. And
[1:05:08] if it don't go off, throw it out and
[1:05:10] throw another one in and try it again.
[1:05:12] Throw it in and try it again till one
[1:05:14] goes off. There's one of them. And
[1:05:16] there's the live. One of them will go
[1:05:18] off. So that's what we got to do. Just
[1:05:21] keep firing away, firing away until
[1:05:25] something happens.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; What am I doing?
[1:05:29] I'm firing away now. I'm going out here
[1:05:33] leading a responsibility.
[1:05:37] Millions of people looking at you. What
[1:05:39] you going to do? What's the next move?
[1:05:40] Some thinks I'm dead. Some thinks this.
[1:05:43] Even that government all good. They said
[1:05:44] I was trying to commit suicide.
[1:05:46] Everything see out around the country
[1:05:47] and everything.
[1:05:49] See, but you got all that to contend
[1:05:51] with. Then you got the burden of the
[1:05:54] people. And just imagine what if God
[1:05:56] would place on you that you know the
[1:05:57] heart of the people that you're talking
[1:05:59] to. Think about that.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:06:05] brethren, maybe I know you have burdens,
[1:06:07] but you don't understand. And besides
[1:06:10] that, here you've got the responsibility
[1:06:12] here. You say, "Well, that ought to be
[1:06:14] easy for you, brother Bram. Anything to
[1:06:16] do, God just tell you, no, he doesn't. I
[1:06:18] sweat it out just like you do and a
[1:06:20] whole lot harder."
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Sure. I have to sweat it much harder
[1:06:25] than you do. And there's going to be
[1:06:26] more required of me where you have to
[1:06:29] answer for a church, where you have to
[1:06:31] answer for your family, or maybe just
[1:06:33] for yourself. See, there's millions of
[1:06:35] souls I got to answer for. I got to know
[1:06:38] my moves. And if Satan's knocking you
[1:06:41] for one soul or a few souls that you'll
[1:06:43] catch, what about how your millions are
[1:06:44] setting in order? How many more blast is
[1:06:47] he throwing in there? See, so you got a
[1:06:50] whole lot to remember rather than that.
[1:06:52] No wonder I get nervous sometimes. Sure.
[1:06:55] But now I'm punching away right now. I
[1:06:59] throw a shell in it that fires. There it
[1:07:02] is. But if it don't fire, I won't quit.
[1:07:05] I'll throw that one out as a thud and
[1:07:06] try another one. One of them's going to
[1:07:09] go off. That's all there is to it. One
[1:07:11] of them's going to fire somewhere. Then
[1:07:13] I'll I want to be on the target. So when
[1:07:16] it does fire, I'll hit the object that
[1:07:18] I'm shooting at. And I you know what I
[1:07:20] mean? I'm sure they there's something
[1:07:22] somewhere. I'm leaving for these
[1:07:23] meetings just plunging out. None. I
[1:07:26] don't aim to teach these great things I
[1:07:29] teach you people. You remember what that
[1:07:32] dream that I got? interpretation was go
[1:07:34] back and store up food.
[1:07:37] Where was the storehouse? This
[1:07:40] tabernacle.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Where is there anything like it in the
[1:07:44] country around here, anywhere that will
[1:07:46] compare with the message that we have
[1:07:48] now? Of course, our little brother share
[1:07:50] the title along here. These other little
[1:07:51] churches are us.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; We're one. Where would you go to to find
[1:07:56] it?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Sure. It's comparison anywhere.
[1:08:00] You go right out in denominational
[1:08:01] creeds, you'll go right out await in the
[1:08:03] name of the Lord Jesus. You'll go right
[1:08:04] out a way in these other things. See,
[1:08:07] and here's where the food's been stored
[1:08:08] up.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Well, one message that I preach here to
[1:08:11] you all, look, I've been preaching from
[1:08:13] one to six hours to you on a message.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Well, if I had to use one of those
[1:08:17] message, I'd take a week to take it.
[1:08:19] Just a little bit here and a little bit
[1:08:20] there. See, because it's been stored up
[1:08:23] here. It's on tapes. It'll go worldwide
[1:08:25] on the tapes where people in their
[1:08:27] houses. them tapes will fall right into
[1:08:29] the hands of the predestinated of God.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He can direct the word. He'll direct
[1:08:33] everything just exactly to its course.
[1:08:35] That's the reason he sent me back to do
[1:08:37] this. Store up the food year. He forbid
[1:08:40] me to go overseas. Brother Argu said,
[1:08:43] "Well, come go. You got one night, but
[1:08:45] we'll take you a tourist trip all around
[1:08:46] over the country." The way I seen
[1:08:48] Brother Fred and Brother Banks trying to
[1:08:50] go. I said, "I wouldn't go that way."
[1:08:53] See, it showed that there was something
[1:08:55] else. I pressed right up to the mark.
[1:08:59] Now I'm going to don't know which way to
[1:09:00] go, but the amination lay all around me.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Has it called me back to the evangelism?
[1:09:07] Has he called me to foreign
[1:09:08] missionaries? Has he called me to be his
[1:09:10] prophet? I'm at a pastor somewhere.
[1:09:12] Whatever I'm to do, I'll just keep
[1:09:14] throwing shell in and pulling a hammer
[1:09:15] on him. One of them will go off.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; But I'm just not going to stand and look
[1:09:20] say, "Lord, you put the shell in the
[1:09:22] gun. I'm going to put the shell in the
[1:09:23] gun. Do the pulling myself. Let him do
[1:09:25] the fine. He's the one to take care of
[1:09:28] that. Let me just keep moving on. I when
[1:09:30] I go on this meetings now, I'm just
[1:09:32] going out. I don't know. I I may not say
[1:09:36] one thing about these message like a
[1:09:38] preacher. I may not even have one night
[1:09:40] of discernment. I don't know. I'm just
[1:09:43] going not knowing what I'm going to do.
[1:09:45] I couldn't tell you. I'm just going. And
[1:09:48] that's all. And that's what you have to
[1:09:50] do. You got something in mind. The
[1:09:53] people here wants a church. Build it as
[1:09:56] quick as you can. Get it up. Get your
[1:10:00] teachers and name things. You brother
[1:10:01] not your little churches and you want to
[1:10:04] you're doing a work. God will reward you
[1:10:07] for that. Go out there, preach. Do
[1:10:09] everything you can. Let all of you get
[1:10:11] together, you bunch of men, and have
[1:10:13] meetings and talk on deep things in the
[1:10:15] scripture and pray. Don't don't just
[1:10:18] come here together unless you come for
[1:10:20] prayer meeting alone. do your praying in
[1:10:22] secret. Stay out in the places. Go into
[1:10:25] your rooms. Hide out somewhere and just
[1:10:27] kneel down and just stay before God and
[1:10:30] stay there. Then if you find out look
[1:10:32] like something's moving up or you're
[1:10:34] just going and you find out it gets a
[1:10:36] little bit off the word and be careful.
[1:10:39] No matter how good it looks, stop right
[1:10:42] there. A wrong spirit struck you because
[1:10:45] the message of this day is to the word.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Don't see if you say, "Oh my brother, I
[1:10:51] tell you so and so, while so and so
[1:10:53] stood the other night, this that thing
[1:10:54] take place like this." Watch it.
[1:10:57] Watch it close. Don't renounce nothing.
[1:11:00] Just wait and see how it acts and then
[1:11:02] bring it up to the word and see how it
[1:11:04] compares with the word. Then if it
[1:11:06] compares with the word and everything's
[1:11:08] fine, thank God. And just keep moving on
[1:11:10] and see long as it stays in the word.
[1:11:13] That's my opinion what I think you
[1:11:15] should do. Brother Neville,
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Ronald, Brother Crease, and
[1:11:19] Brother Beer, and all you brethren here,
[1:11:22] Juny, wherever you are, and the rest of
[1:11:24] you, brethren, God richly bless you.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I see Terry, Lynn, Charlie Cox, David,
[1:11:34] a lot of you young men here, God anoint
[1:11:37] you.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] My I would like to pick up a handful of
[1:11:43] you be evangelism and set you somewhere.
[1:11:45] See, knowing that you've come up, you
[1:11:47] can stand and know the message and study
[1:11:51] to prove yourself. You feel a call in
[1:11:53] your life. I see two or three young men,
[1:11:56] four or five sitting on a roll back
[1:11:58] here. And and like that, you're a young
[1:12:01] man. I'm getting old. Brother Neville's
[1:12:03] getting old. We're middle-aged man. If
[1:12:06] time rolls on, we're going to walk off
[1:12:08] the scene. That's why you've got to fill
[1:12:10] our shoes. See?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And so you see that maybe in that day
[1:12:16] even it'll be growing greater if there
[1:12:18] is a tomorrow.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But while there is a today, let's work
[1:12:21] while it's day. Tomorrow may never come.
[1:12:23] If it does, let's be ready for it. See
[1:12:25] what I mean?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Now that's what I would think to you.
[1:12:30] Wouldn't it be wonderful to see a
[1:12:32] brother up there from Utica,
[1:12:36] brother Grace, all you other brethren
[1:12:38] here come together, meet, come into a
[1:12:42] place, you ministers, set together and
[1:12:45] discuss things. You've got to have
[1:12:47] fellowship somewhere. You've got to have
[1:12:49] something to come together to kind of
[1:12:50] get together about. You all come
[1:12:53] together as a group of men and believe
[1:12:54] one with the other and like that and
[1:12:56] discuss these problems and sit out maybe
[1:12:59] once a month just ministers alone let
[1:13:01] you meet somewhere in one of your
[1:13:02] churches sit there and discuss it and
[1:13:05] talk it each one of you pastors and
[1:13:07] evangelists and whatever you are and
[1:13:08] then if some great problem comes up you
[1:13:10] can't settle then if I'm called on the
[1:13:13] field of evangelism I don't know that I
[1:13:15] will be if I will be you know I'll be
[1:13:17] coming back constantly all the time and
[1:13:19] then if you get those things then when I
[1:13:21] come back here. Well, we'll meet
[1:13:23] together and just stay down there. One
[1:13:25] of you has a calling in your life. We
[1:13:27] won't have like private interviews and
[1:13:29] things we've been having. We'll just
[1:13:30] come right together and stay there till
[1:13:32] we have thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And if you can get the preacher straight
[1:13:36] and him going, right? Look what he's
[1:13:37] going to do. He's going to influence us,
[1:13:40] it would take care of the hundreds of
[1:13:41] these things that we're just beating at.
[1:13:44] You see, you got to get it a system,
[1:13:47] God's system. like uh Jethro said to
[1:13:50] Moses, "Well, you can't beat out all of
[1:13:52] them." Or, "And God put elders out
[1:13:56] there, 70 of them, and tuck the spirit
[1:13:59] was on Moses and put them up on those 70
[1:14:02] elders, and they prophesied."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; And it didn't weaken Moses a bit and
[1:14:07] strengthened him.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He had just as much prophecy in him as
[1:14:10] he did before they took the spirit off
[1:14:11] of him that prophesied. See, he just
[1:14:14] separated the son of Moses. let them
[1:14:16] judge the smaller things. And but when
[1:14:18] it comes to the major things, you come
[1:14:20] in with them and help them like that.
[1:14:22] That's the way that was God's way back
[1:14:23] there. That was God's way in the in the
[1:14:26] early church age. And I believe it's
[1:14:28] God's way now,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; right? For us to do it. So, let's do it.
[1:14:34] Just quit talking about it and do it.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; That's all we can do it by the grace of
[1:14:38] God. Don't you believe it?
[1:14:41] I
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Oh, I've done tucked my time
[1:14:44] up.
[1:14:53] I hope that was encouraging and
[1:14:55] enlightening.
[1:14:57] You know, you you look back and you
[1:15:00] think, "Well, did that ever come to
[1:15:02] pass?" You know, God brought it to pass.
[1:15:07] You know, I was a young man of
[1:15:12] 18 years old and God brought this
[1:15:15] message to me in California. He found
[1:15:18] men all over to do exactly what he said.
[1:15:22] So God carried out the word just the way
[1:15:26] it was spoken. And for the ministers
[1:15:29] here, you know that we've raised up
[1:15:31] ministers here and we've trained them
[1:15:33] and we've kept them in the word and
[1:15:35] we've sought those people out. So God's
[1:15:38] word is happening and it's going to
[1:15:41] happen.
[1:15:43] Nothing stops God. You understand? It's
[1:15:46] going to carry on. It's it's going to go
[1:15:48] forward. You know, the important thing
[1:15:51] is I think what he said. He says when
[1:15:53] something comes up, he said don't speak
[1:15:55] out against it. Don't get all wait on
[1:15:58] it. See if it lines up with the word.
[1:16:01] You know, let it judge. And you know
[1:16:03] what you find out? You find out that a
[1:16:06] lot of times things correct themselves.
[1:16:09] Good men love God full of the spirit of
[1:16:12] God that they might head out somewhere
[1:16:15] for a while trying to do God a service,
[1:16:18] thinking it's the right way to go. But
[1:16:20] you know, if they're real brethren, he
[1:16:22] said the spirit will correct it. He'll
[1:16:24] come talk to them. He'll bring them
[1:16:25] back. He'll bring them back to the
[1:16:27] middle of the road. We've got to have
[1:16:29] that confidence, you know, but you
[1:16:31] don't, he goes on later in this sermon,
[1:16:34] he talks about you don't, someone comes
[1:16:35] into a town, he does a little thing,
[1:16:37] everybody gets out a pole and pushes him
[1:16:40] in the hole, you know what I mean? Or
[1:16:42] points out his mistake and tries to run
[1:16:45] him down. You know, there just so much
[1:16:48] of the right attitude that I thought was
[1:16:52] expressed. I mean, I hope you felt that,
[1:16:54] too. the right Christian attitude, the
[1:16:57] right thing, doing the right work and
[1:17:00] and
[1:17:02] I don't have a message. This is my
[1:17:05] message.
[1:17:07] And I think that
[1:17:10] we can all follow this together. Don't
[1:17:12] you feel that in the right spirit and
[1:17:15] the right thing? So, you just have to
[1:17:18] you and I think what you got to do is
[1:17:20] you got to really ask yourself, what am
[1:17:22] I feeding on?
[1:17:25] you know, what what what's what are we
[1:17:27] feeding on? What's being brought to us?
[1:17:30] You know, what what is it that satisfies
[1:17:33] our soul? And and I'll tell you a this
[1:17:37] little portion we listen to is food. It
[1:17:40] really makes you think, really makes you
[1:17:43] look at yourself, you know, and you
[1:17:46] know, it's easy when somebody's always
[1:17:50] telling you, "Oh, you're the only
[1:17:51] elected. You're the bride. you're the
[1:17:53] best in the world, you know, you're
[1:17:56] you're secure, you're going to heaven
[1:17:58] all the time. You forget looking at
[1:18:00] yourself,
[1:18:02] you know, and I thought the other day, I
[1:18:04] thought, you know, Lord, I've almost got
[1:18:06] so predestinated that I don't even
[1:18:08] believe there's a hell,
[1:18:12] you know. I mean, there's no no fear of
[1:18:14] God,
[1:18:16] you know, no fear of of, you know, no,
[1:18:20] and no, you know, what if this isn't
[1:18:24] right? What's the consequences?
[1:18:26] You just get to the place you think, I'm
[1:18:28] elected. I'm the bride. I'm the chosen
[1:18:31] one. I'm predestinated. My name's on the
[1:18:34] Lamb's book of life. If and you create
[1:18:37] an attitude about yourself
[1:18:41] and then you don't you don't even you
[1:18:44] don't even think there's any reprisal.
[1:18:48] You don't even think there's hell. I
[1:18:50] even got in my soul. I said, Lord, I
[1:18:52] wonder do I even believe in hell
[1:18:53] anymore?
[1:18:57] And you know, do I even fear
[1:19:00] God anymore that I'm not really
[1:19:02] consecrated like I should be? And and
[1:19:05] you know the fear of God is the
[1:19:09] beginning of wisdom.
[1:19:12] It'd be like saying if you don't fear
[1:19:14] God,
[1:19:16] you're an idiot. Maybe that's not a word
[1:19:19] you can use here, but I don't you know,
[1:19:23] my dad would say you're a numb skull.
[1:19:27] You know what I mean? So I I just think
[1:19:30] it's it's it's getting back
[1:19:34] to the fear of God, to the full
[1:19:38] confidence in the message, to living it
[1:19:40] and knowing that this is our food and
[1:19:43] that we ca we don't have to be afraid of
[1:19:45] any group, any man, anything because we
[1:19:50] have a vindicated
[1:19:52] absolute that is more than life for us.
[1:19:56] So I I I hope that that the spiritually
[1:20:02] you understand what today
[1:20:06] was
[1:20:07] for my life, for this church is we're
[1:20:12] trying to turn a corner and get back
[1:20:17] on the way forward
[1:20:19] to the right things, the right mental
[1:20:22] attitude, the right love one for
[1:20:24] another. And I think it also parallels
[1:20:28] perfectly with the political environment
[1:20:32] today. And I'll just say this,
[1:20:36] when this great tragedy took place,
[1:20:41] I begin to read the commentaries and and
[1:20:44] and
[1:20:47] the hatred
[1:20:50] between the two opposing sides.
[1:20:54] And you know, you automatically in your
[1:20:57] nature, you're always going to
[1:21:01] go to the one that mentions God and
[1:21:05] mentions the Lord Jesus and and you know
[1:21:10] and and all the things that they the
[1:21:12] principles that they stand to and all
[1:21:15] that. And then when you really look at
[1:21:17] the word of God, you know, Satan comes
[1:21:19] appearing as an angel of light
[1:21:23] and they the scripture says they will
[1:21:26] kill you thinking that they're doing God
[1:21:30] a service. So now you have people with
[1:21:33] political power
[1:21:36] who feel that they're morally right.
[1:21:40] They're the ones they've got the will of
[1:21:43] God on their side.
[1:21:46] and and their viewpoints
[1:21:49] are now vindicated by God,
[1:21:55] you know, and and and you can sit there
[1:21:58] and say all you want and and they say
[1:22:00] it, oh, the reason the bullet didn't
[1:22:02] strike him because God wanted him to be
[1:22:05] president.
[1:22:08] We know that the kingdoms of the rule
[1:22:11] world are ruled by the enemy.
[1:22:14] He's only just what Jesus said to
[1:22:16] Caesar. You're only there because my
[1:22:18] father allowed it.
[1:22:21] You understand?
[1:22:23] And the deception
[1:22:26] is that it appears as an angel of light.
[1:22:30] So we think that here's this group of
[1:22:32] people that's got our values. They're
[1:22:34] standing against homosexuality. They're
[1:22:36] standing for this. Oh, they must be for
[1:22:39] this.
[1:22:41] Don't let that deceive you.
[1:22:44] Uh-uh. Those are the people that are
[1:22:46] going to turn around
[1:22:49] and and and they're the ones that going
[1:22:51] to decide what's real churches. So, if
[1:22:55] you think everything's so spiritual, you
[1:22:58] know who our president's pastor is?
[1:23:02] Dana White, I think her name is, right?
[1:23:05] Dana.
[1:23:06] Paula.
[1:23:08] Isn't that deceiving? Paula White. Our
[1:23:13] president's got a a woman preacher for a
[1:23:17] pastor.
[1:23:20] It just fits right back into every
[1:23:21] prophecy the prophet of God said, a
[1:23:24] woman,
[1:23:26] right? It's all there. So, don't don't
[1:23:29] be deceived
[1:23:31] and and and get caught up in in all all
[1:23:37] this. You know, Fox News isn't the voice
[1:23:40] of God to the United States.
[1:23:44] You know what I mean? Neither is NSNBC,
[1:23:47] the voice of the devil.
[1:23:50] You know what I mean? It's got nothing
[1:23:53] both. It's all wrong.
[1:23:56] the whole thing, the whole politics, the
[1:24:00] whole education. You know, I someone
[1:24:03] told me the other day they're leaving
[1:24:04] the country because they they don't want
[1:24:07] to be in America. Well, it ain't
[1:24:09] America. It's the devil.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And he's everywhere.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And he's coming.
[1:24:21] You We should have realized how
[1:24:23] important it is to make the rapture. You
[1:24:25] know what happens if you don't make the
[1:24:27] rapture? Are you going to be lost? No.
[1:24:31] But the beast is going to seek you out
[1:24:32] and devour you and kill you.
[1:24:38] What a choice.
[1:24:41] I'll just miss Sunday night. I'll not
[1:24:43] you guys. I'll just miss Sunday night.
[1:24:46] I'll I I won't go to communion. I won't
[1:24:49] go to footwashing because I've got a
[1:24:52] back door. You know, it's called the
[1:24:54] tribulation where I'll lay my life down.
[1:24:59] That ain't a real wise choice.
[1:25:03] You know what I mean? You don't know
[1:25:05] what you would do. You have to remember
[1:25:08] everybody that gave their life for this
[1:25:10] gospel had a special anointing
[1:25:14] put on them
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; by the the beast, the ox beast. He gave
[1:25:19] them a special anointing that allowed
[1:25:24] them to lay their life down. Without
[1:25:26] that anointing, they wouldn't have laid
[1:25:28] their life down. Now, we have a special
[1:25:30] anointing to make the rapture.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going to give up this
[1:25:35] anointing to hope I get an anointing
[1:25:38] that allows me to lay down my life. I I
[1:25:41] don't think that's real wisdom. Do you?
[1:25:44] You've got a chance. And let's take the
[1:25:47] chance we've got. So, um, I don't know
[1:25:52] where I'm going to go from here. So,
[1:25:56] I'm probably preach Sunday. I played
[1:26:00] tapes this Sunday because I felt that it
[1:26:02] was absolutely
[1:26:05] the Lord that brought me to it. And and
[1:26:11] when I I told many brothers, I I I'm
[1:26:15] going to preach how to out of taking
[1:26:17] sides with Jesus. I thought I was going
[1:26:20] to preach from where he took the
[1:26:21] scriptures, but I didn't know what what
[1:26:24] was laying in front of it. And so I
[1:26:27] think I think we're on tune. I think
[1:26:30] we're back on track. I hope we are. If
[1:26:33] you you may have always been on track,
[1:26:35] just waiting for me to get on track.
[1:26:37] Well, I hope I'm back and you keep me on
[1:26:40] track,
[1:26:42] right? By staying in the word. What did
[1:26:45] he say? Get alone in your closets. Get
[1:26:47] alone and pray. Seek the Lord. Seek what
[1:26:49] you can do. Ask God what you can do for
[1:26:51] the kingdom. Don't be be courageous.
[1:26:54] Remember he told them, "Be courageous.
[1:26:56] Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to
[1:26:58] stand up and testify. Don't be able to
[1:27:01] Don't be afraid. Satan's trying to get
[1:27:03] us to cower down, you know, and if we if
[1:27:06] we are that last voice, then we've got
[1:27:10] to be the voice of the voice,
[1:27:13] not a different voice. It's got to be
[1:27:16] together with the voice. So, let's put
[1:27:19] our in Let's remember
[1:27:22] anybody that's a part of this message is
[1:27:24] our brother. We support them. If they
[1:27:28] got a little difference, we've been
[1:27:29] taught that's fine. They're working for
[1:27:32] the right thing. God will not lose a
[1:27:35] one.
[1:27:37] And I could take you through the
[1:27:39] scriptures where you, you know, Rahab
[1:27:43] the harlot, you know, she she heard the
[1:27:47] gospel from unbelievers. You could go
[1:27:50] all down through the scriptures where
[1:27:52] people heard the gospel from
[1:27:54] unbelievers.
[1:27:56] And and so it doesn't matter what they
[1:27:58] Paul put it this way. He says, "Some
[1:28:00] preach for envy, some for lucer, some
[1:28:03] for strife, but nevertheless, I praise
[1:28:06] God for the gospel is being preached,
[1:28:08] and there's a predestinated seed out
[1:28:11] there." And I think the right attitude
[1:28:14] towards any promise of God brings it to
[1:28:17] pass. And the right spiritual attitude
[1:28:20] creates an atmosphere that the word of
[1:28:23] God can flourish in. So, let's let's
[1:28:26] just continue to go forward. keep me in
[1:28:29] prayer and um and uh um you know and um
[1:28:37] there there's just a lot of things that
[1:28:39] I could point to in there that tie right
[1:28:41] into what we're doing. Many of you
[1:28:43] ministers have come and know that we've
[1:28:46] been training you up just what the
[1:28:48] prophet of God said to do. So what he's
[1:28:52] taught has been happening
[1:28:55] and I hope that you realize that you're
[1:28:58] a part of something. I'm 75 years old be
[1:29:01] 76 this I can't continue on forever.
[1:29:06] And that's why it's so important that we
[1:29:10] lay this foundation of staying with the
[1:29:14] message of the hour because I've seen so
[1:29:17] many go around. I remember brother Tim's
[1:29:21] dad used to take the film because we
[1:29:23] didn't have video, we didn't have phone
[1:29:26] and set that film up and show it. I
[1:29:29] think the first time I saw the film in
[1:29:31] the church here, his dad showed it to us
[1:29:34] running the old real and real projector.
[1:29:37] We've come a long way.
[1:29:39] You understand? But we can't go forward
[1:29:42] until we're enthused
[1:29:45] and 100% set that God's got a way of
[1:29:49] doing things. And he revealed it. And I
[1:29:52] know you caught this in there. He says,
[1:29:54] "Well, if I'm not the one, I'm the one
[1:29:56] to come." And and that was in 62. And
[1:30:00] I'm just going to come out with thus
[1:30:02] sayaeth the Lord. If you look back, it's
[1:30:04] exactly what happened. He became that
[1:30:08] prophet with thus sayaeth the Lord. And
[1:30:11] he didn't care what anybody thought. He
[1:30:13] let the chips fall where they may.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He preached Oh, he
[1:30:19] preached the rapture. He preached, you
[1:30:22] know, he just preached them all. You
[1:30:23] know, doing God's service without it
[1:30:26] being his will. Uh, you know, seed is
[1:30:29] not air with the shucks. Well, it just
[1:30:31] gets you excited thinking about the
[1:30:33] message he just poured down there with
[1:30:35] thus sayaith the Lord and and who is the
[1:30:38] beneficiary?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; We are. What's our reward for hearing
[1:30:43] it? The resurrection. So, God bless you.
[1:30:46] We'll have Billy come lead a song. Close
[1:30:49] in prayer. And thank you for coming out
[1:30:51] tonight. And those of you that are
[1:30:54] laying home streaming, uh,
[1:30:59] I hope your jammies are comfortable and
[1:31:02] your coffee is warm.
[1:31:04] Amen. And I I I hope that, uh, you know,
[1:31:09] your feet are propped up real nice and
[1:31:12] you got your clicker and you're turning
[1:31:15] the volume up and it's really, really
[1:31:18] nice. I I hope the best for you.
[1:31:21] Amen.
[1:31:23] Because uh
[1:31:26] there's hard times coming.
[1:31:29] So you better start toughening up. And
[1:31:33] all these wonderful people that came out
[1:31:35] tonight, they sacrificed. So I know that
[1:31:38] God's got a special blessing coming for
[1:31:41] you and you'll be glad that you did. So
[1:31:45] God bless you. I hope you know I love
[1:31:47] you. I hope the love of God is apparent.
[1:31:50] And I hope our love for the word is what
[1:31:53] keeps us together in unity and in
[1:31:56] service for the Lord. So brother Billy
[1:31:58] comes
[1:32:01] this brother Billy's just a proof of
[1:32:04] God's word.
[1:32:06] I told brother Billy I said I came to
[1:32:09] him I said brother Billy I think that
[1:32:11] you've got a call to preach. You know I
[1:32:13] didn't see him for three weeks.
[1:32:17] I'd come up and go where's Billy? And
[1:32:19] there's Billy. He He wasn't married.
[1:32:22] Yeah. You weren't married then, were
[1:32:24] you? You see, it took Jida to get him
[1:32:26] straight.
[1:32:28] Anyway, off he'd go, you know, just not
[1:32:31] just like, you know, but the Lord got
[1:32:34] him, rrestled him down. He's done a
[1:32:37] wonderful job for us, hasn't he? We've
[1:32:39] had brothers go out from here and start
[1:32:42] churches. Aaron's in in in in Phoenix,
[1:32:45] you know, doing the Lord's will. Has a
[1:32:47] church. It's really growing. Uh God's
[1:32:49] blessing him. We've had other brothers
[1:32:51] leave here. You know, it don't matter
[1:32:54] why they leave. God's got the reason for
[1:32:56] it. He He'll make somebody leave and you
[1:32:58] don't even know why. But at least
[1:33:00] they're out there preaching the gospel,
[1:33:02] preaching this message. You know,
[1:33:04] there's people that can't stand me no
[1:33:06] matter. So, even though I'm such a
[1:33:07] lovely guy, you know what I mean? They
[1:33:10] just that's personalities. But the
[1:33:12] gospel doesn't have a personality. The
[1:33:14] go this message has the personality of
[1:33:16] Jesus Christ. So that's what's
[1:33:18] important. So God bless you. Let's fight
[1:33:20] the good fight of faith. Let's go
[1:33:23] forward. Let's be strong. Let's serve
[1:33:25] God with all our hearts. Amen. Billy
[1:33:27] Billy.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; You are my strength when I am weak.

[1:39:27] everything in order. If we only watch
[1:39:30] the path and follow, he'll certainly
[1:39:32] guide us to the promised land. Amen.

[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; You know, I thank God for the word
[1:39:51] today. And why don't we just go to him
[1:39:54] in prayer?
[1:39:56] Heavenly Father,
[1:39:58] Lord, here we are, oh God. Just so
[1:40:00] grateful, Lord, that Lord, you had this
[1:40:04] in mind for us today, Lord, to

[1:40:10] season and time, Lord. And that you were
[1:40:13] so mindful to store up food for us,

[1:40:33] look to you every day, Lord, to
[1:40:37] make it special, Lord.
[1:40:43] Lord, we don't want to, Lord, take it
[1:40:46] for granted ever, Lord.
[1:40:51] Men have laid their lives down, Lord,
[1:40:54] following after your example, Lord. And
[1:40:57] Lord, help us, Lord, that
[1:41:03] we would redeem every moment, Lord, for
[1:41:06] you, Lord, that this word can take on
[1:41:10] flesh again, Lord. Not looking to
[1:41:13] someone else to do it, but Lord, what
[1:41:15] will you do in me, Lord? We thank you
[1:41:18] Lord for the inspiration of our pastor
[1:41:21] and thank you for directing us Lord to
[1:41:24] this reality once again. Father we pray
[1:41:27] your blessings upon those who have lost
[1:41:30] loved ones. Brother Jay and

[1:41:46] us and bless our pastor and the
[1:41:49] different ones in the up and cominging
[1:41:50] week. Lord, we're certainly needy of you
[1:41:53] to continue to guide us. So, as we go
[1:41:56] our way, Lord, we ask you go with us.
[1:41:58] Inspire us in your word. And Lord, give
[1:42:01] us appetite, Lord, for more of you.

[1:43:59] morning.
[1:44:05] I was faithful.
