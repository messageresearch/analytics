[18:00] the lord
[18:18] give a quick little testimony i
[18:21] told the lord if he called me up here
[18:22] tonight i would give it so here i am
[18:27] but uh
[18:29] you know in the bible i tried to find
[18:30] the scripture it's in first samuel i
[18:32] know that talks about obedience is
[18:34] better than sacrifice and uh
[18:38] i was going through some things at work
[18:40] i do bodywork for living for those who
[18:42] don't know i was at uh
[18:44] been doing it for 26 years was the same
[18:45] company for six years ford over in north
[18:48] virgin hills
[18:49] and uh things just began to go south and
[18:51] south quicker and faster and it's just
[18:54] the more i prayed god changed my heart
[18:57] changed the things that worked seemed
[18:58] the worst things god the harder my heart
[19:00] grew towards the place and towards the
[19:02] industry period i was ready to just walk
[19:03] away
[19:05] find a whole new job a whole new line of
[19:07] work whatever and um talked to the
[19:10] pastor about it and uh
[19:13] he wasn't crazy about the idea and he
[19:14] let me know
[19:16] but um
[19:18] i said i wanted to talk to him get his
[19:19] input on it and and i mean i was i had
[19:22] an app on my phone and i was looking for
[19:23] different jobs i mean i was even looking
[19:25] to be a forklift driver for like 30
[19:26] bucks an hour that's easy money why not
[19:30] um
[19:32] but he said he thinks you know god gave
[19:34] me the talent to do what i do i should
[19:35] stick with what i'm doing so and it kept
[19:38] coming to my mind this bmw house i used
[19:40] to work at down in arlington kept coming
[19:42] to my home i was like i don't want to
[19:43] work there i don't want to work there
[19:44] again they they pay less than the ford
[19:46] house did
[19:47] and uh
[19:50] i was looking through my app one day and
[19:52] all these forklift jobs that came up gp1
[19:55] collision center i'm like now that's
[19:56] strange why is this in the forklift jobs
[19:58] right
[20:00] so i said all right i'll go ahead and
[20:01] call stuart down there i know the man i
[20:03] went in there cold steward
[20:04] he says man i've been having that ad in
[20:06] the in the in there for like 10 months
[20:08] he goes yeah i need a body man come down
[20:09] and talk to me so
[20:11] went down there and talked to him um
[20:14] and got the job
[20:16] two dollars more than what i was making
[20:18] it forward an hour so praise the lord um
[20:22] and when we was i had my tools this is
[20:24] where i wanted to testify as god
[20:26] sees everything and he is so mindful of
[20:29] everything
[20:32] it's not much some people maybe to me
[20:34] it's just a so mindful man of everything
[20:37] but
[20:39] my tools were in my garage i was using
[20:41] brother david's trailer
[20:43] and i had to get him the trailer back
[20:44] back to david junior that night because
[20:45] he had to get his scissor left back
[20:47] anyway
[20:49] so jerry was with me my brother and he's
[20:51] like uh
[20:52] he was in the truck and he's like man i
[20:54] think i need to get out of the truck
[20:55] something's telling me get out of the
[20:56] truck i said man you're on it's all
[20:58] right dude i know i'll clear the garage
[21:00] he said man something's telling me that
[21:01] i said all right man just get out guide
[21:02] me whatever i start to pull out he's
[21:04] like
[21:07] the string that pulls the garage door
[21:08] down caught one of my tool boxes and was
[21:10] shut the garage door i had to rip that
[21:13] thing completely out of my house and
[21:14] that would
[21:15] the lord knows there's no way i could
[21:16] have afforded that at this time
[21:18] so that's just really what i wanted to
[21:20] share
[21:21] and just thank god and give him the
[21:22] praise and the glory and the honor and
[21:24] then today i was thinking you know the
[21:25] worst thing about leaving that place and
[21:27] going to where i'm at now is we don't
[21:28] have ac well my boss told me today that
[21:31] uh next friday we're getting our air
[21:33] conditioner stuff put in so praise the

[31:39] amen isn't he wonderful
[31:42] well this is a testimony service so
[31:46] matthew's going to host our service that
[31:49] i wanted to
[31:52] testify we're good i think
[31:54] musicians
[31:57] if matthew needs you he'll call you back
[31:59] up again
[32:03] well you know you go through
[32:05] journeys in life have everybody been to
[32:08] a journey
[32:09] a journey is when
[32:11] something takes forever
[32:14] and you just work on it and you work on
[32:17] it and you work on it and finally
[32:20] one day you get
[32:21] a little bit of victory
[32:23] and
[32:25] so
[32:26] in
[32:28] may of
[32:30] 2015
[32:33] we sat down
[32:35] with the architect
[32:37] and began
[32:39] drawing a plan
[32:41] for our new church and
[32:44] we felt we needed one
[32:46] and we worked out several different
[32:50] situations and
[32:52] worked through some drawings and finally
[32:55] got to something that we felt that it
[32:58] wouldn't be too expensive to build
[33:00] and it would be nice and then
[33:03] we presented our
[33:04] plan to the city
[33:07] in about 2017
[33:10] and then we had our first meeting with
[33:12] the city in
[33:14] 2018
[33:16] they agreed
[33:18] and from that day on we've been on quite
[33:20] a journey
[33:23] everybody the city manager changed the
[33:26] city engineer changed the development
[33:29] director changed
[33:33] the
[33:34] public works director changed
[33:36] the inspectors changed everything
[33:38] changed
[33:39] but finally after a long struggle this
[33:42] tuesday we finally got our first permit
[33:52] and
[33:53] the so the
[33:55] the building process is is in two parts
[33:59] one's what they call the public works
[34:02] and which and the grading permit which
[34:06] is the groundwork the parking lots the
[34:09] sewer the water
[34:10] all those things are first
[34:13] then after we have the fire laying in
[34:16] and the fire hydrants in
[34:18] they give us the building permit to
[34:20] start building
[34:22] the building so
[34:23] as they would say you can't go vertical
[34:26] till the fire
[34:27] lanes in so we're starting that it's
[34:30] going to take a lot of cooperation
[34:33] from all of us
[34:34] parking the deacons or have
[34:37] worked out a parking plan
[34:40] that includes parking down the street at
[34:43] the church down the street and we'll
[34:45] give out all the
[34:47] stipulations who parks there basically
[34:50] if you can walk
[34:52] 150 yards you'll end up parking down the
[34:55] street
[34:56] if you're under 30.
[34:59] anybody 40 and over they can park out
[35:03] here if they have children
[35:05] and
[35:07] some people smiled at that
[35:09] i hope you're not giving anything away
[35:11] here you know i didn't think you were
[35:13] there yet
[35:15] so we'll arrange that we'll put notices
[35:18] up and all that so
[35:20] the main thing we need is
[35:23] to watch our children because we're
[35:26] going to have equipment in the back
[35:28] it's muddy
[35:29] we're sawing out concrete we're taking
[35:32] off so all the kids can't run back there
[35:34] and play ball the way they used to so
[35:37] parents watch your kids
[35:38] if not they're going to be getting in
[35:40] your car with concrete
[35:42] all over them and all those things so
[35:45] that's all the
[35:46] news
[35:49] the other part of my testimony is is
[35:52] that
[35:53] he saved me
[35:55] back in around 1967
[35:58] 68
[35:59] and he hasn't let go of me
[36:04] i'm not what i want to be
[36:06] i'm not what i should be
[36:08] but i'm not what i used to be either and
[36:12] and that's a
[36:13] that's a thrill
[36:15] to my soul there's many a times
[36:18] i thought that
[36:20] he was going to let me go
[36:23] there's many of things i've done that he
[36:25] should have let me go
[36:27] but he promised me he wouldn't
[36:30] and he said if i started to work in you
[36:33] i'll finish it
[36:34] until the end
[36:36] and we had a good camp this year
[36:39] the lord blessed
[36:42] many people
[36:44] and
[36:45] all i can say is the best way to keep
[36:48] the fire
[36:50] burning
[36:51] is to testify about it
[36:54] the best way to keep your flame burning
[36:58] is to share it with other people
[37:01] that's why the prophet of god said if
[37:03] you can't do anything else tell them how
[37:06] your candle got lit
[37:10] amen because if if
[37:12] if it doesn't
[37:15] if you don't keep sharing it
[37:17] it dies out
[37:19] in your life and the best way to keep a
[37:21] fire going is to fan the flames
[37:25] and so uh tonight i i know that sister
[37:29] kelly's gonna testify she's been burning
[37:32] to testify
[37:33] she called me and let me know she's
[37:35] going to testify
[37:38] she said i want to testify
[37:40] so i'm going to invite matthew up he'll
[37:43] say what he wants to say and then sister
[37:45] kelly you'll be the first one to testify
[37:48] okay
[37:49] yeah and then uh i know brother tommy's
[37:52] gonna say a little testimony andrew and
[37:55] then anybody else
[37:57] just raise your hand
[37:59] wave your hand and if you don't get
[38:00] noticed just jump up and start
[38:02] testifying amen right
[38:06] that's one thing we have is the liberty
[38:08] of the holy spirit
[38:10] and
[38:11] there's no big eyes here there's no
[38:13] little news there's no we were all
[38:15] purchased for the same price there's
[38:18] none of us that have done one thing for
[38:20] our salvation
[38:22] i didn't do the choosing
[38:24] he did the choosing and if he chose you
[38:28] i respect any decision he makes now i
[38:32] have to be honest there's a lot of
[38:33] people i've met i wouldn't have chosen
[38:37] and
[38:39] and that's why he didn't put me in
[38:41] charge right
[38:43] right and there will be a lot of people
[38:45] there that you'll be surprised
[38:47] but believe me they'll be just as
[38:49] surprised to see it
[38:52] so do you love them tonight
[38:55] amen you're ready to talk about the good
[38:57] things of god you're ready to testify
[39:00] what he's done for you amen we don't
[39:02] have to hurry let's just rejoice in the
[39:05] lord anybody can testify
[39:07] and we just might call on somebody and
[39:09] have them testify
[39:11] and if they don't have a test a
[39:13] testimony what that means is you put
[39:16] them on the top of your prayer list
[39:20] because they need to get close to god so
[39:22] they have something to testify about
[39:24] well anyway god bless you i just want
[39:26] you to know that i love you all with all
[39:29] of my heart those of you that are

[39:39] and many of you there's people that i
[39:42] haven't seen in two years now

[39:54] back together thank you so god bless you
[39:57] brother matthew if you want to sing
[39:58] songs have the musicians back
[40:01] and invite the first the only thing
[40:03] commands you have for me
[40:05] is that you have sister kelly
[40:07] testified first
[40:09] other than that however this spirit
[40:11] leads it's not that the spirit's not
[40:12] leading
[40:13] oh i i want i'm so anxious to hear a
[40:16] testimony amen all right
[40:18] god bless you praise the lord why don't
[40:20] we just go ahead and stand it's always
[40:21] good to read the word as we just start a
[40:23] little testimony service
[40:25] just read out of first peter 3 15 i've
[40:27] always i like this scripture and it
[40:29] always whenever you're going to testify
[40:31] and say something about the lord the
[40:33] scripture
[40:34] comes to my remembrance
[40:36] so i just want to read that first peter
[40:39] 3 15.
[40:43] i love to hear the pages turning
[40:58] and they are turning
[41:01] it's okay
[41:03] i don't know why it is so many times in
[41:05] service when a minister might say turn
[41:07] in your bible to romans i'm like i know
[41:09] romans is in my bible somewhere
[41:13] i think hopefully we've all experienced
[41:15] that before first peter
[41:17] 3 15 says but sanctify the lord god in
[41:20] your hearts
[41:22] and be ready always
[41:24] to give an answer to every man that
[41:26] asketh you a reason
[41:28] of the hope that is in you with meekness
[41:31] and fear
[41:32] amen let's also just read john
[41:35] chapter 15
[41:37] verse 26 and 27.
[41:44] amen that's what we're doing this
[41:45] evening is we're giving you a an
[41:47] opportunity
[41:51] to speak of that hope that lies within
[41:53] you
[41:54] and then
[41:55] john 15
[42:00] verse 26
[42:05] says but when the comforter has come
[42:08] whom i will send unto you from the
[42:09] father
[42:11] even the spirit of truth which
[42:12] proceedeth from the father
[42:15] he
[42:16] shall testify of me yes
[42:19] and ye
[42:20] also
[42:21] shall bear witness
[42:23] because ye have been with me from the
[42:26] beginning
[42:27] amen you can go ahead and be seated
[42:31] my that's inspiring right there
[42:33] we have something to testify about
[42:36] and i just love how it says because
[42:38] you've been with me from the beginning
[42:40] we have a message that took us back
[42:42] before there was ever a stardust
[42:45] created that we are with him so before i
[42:47] get excited let's just call sister kelly
[42:49] up
[42:51] that she can testify of what god has
[42:53] done
[42:55] we're certainly looking forward to that
[43:12] so i you know the lord's been good to me
[43:14] he's
[43:16] given me two very beautiful boys
[43:19] there's
[43:21] no way i could thank him enough for that
[43:23] both of them are very special they
[43:26] they're they have gifts they they have
[43:28] lit up our lives
[43:31] so
[43:32] when no mildest is 21 he's wayward um
[43:36] that's not going to be for long i'm just
[43:37] telling you that it's not going to be
[43:39] long
[43:40] um
[43:42] i knew all the different scriptures
[43:44] when he was born we did not know
[43:47] and it didn't seem anyone around us knew
[43:49] that our children are promised like it
[43:51] could go either way you just better hope
[43:53] you know and
[43:54] like we heard a lot of different input
[43:56] from very well-meaning people like just
[43:59] you know do everything right if you'll
[44:01] if you will you know be very very
[44:03] dedicated while he's little
[44:04] you know that's the children who stay
[44:06] that's the ones you know so we're like
[44:08] trying to be dedicated and we're you
[44:10] know and
[44:11] time went on we're trying to be
[44:12] dedicated
[44:14] we were saved you know full of the holy
[44:16] ghost but um
[44:18] when he got to be a big
[44:20] huge teenager you know when things
[44:22] didn't go right
[44:24] i began to search for myself what does
[44:26] the word say about our children what
[44:29] what happens to abraham seeds kids
[44:32] that's what i want to know and i began
[44:34] to find
[44:35] okay it's everywhere it's literally
[44:38] everywhere it's literally full proof
[44:41] that our children are promised
[44:43] so like isaiah 54 13 i have a great big
[44:46] plaque on my wall i had a sister paint
[44:48] it for me and i said i want you to put
[44:50] levi and christian
[44:52] on that in pain
[44:54] and it says
[44:55] and all thy children shall be taught of
[44:57] the lord and great shall be the peace of
[44:59] thy children
[45:01] well when you have a great big teenager
[45:03] they do not have peace
[45:06] it's a very difficult portion of road
[45:08] very difficult for parents
[45:10] and for the child
[45:13] so that word peace is big and i thought
[45:15] you know someday my kids are gonna have
[45:17] their that's mine
[45:19] my children will be will have peace
[45:21] and the only way you're gonna have peace
[45:22] is in the lord so
[45:24] i knew the different ones
[45:26] i played
[45:27] i played the prodigal brother branham
[45:29] and he said
[45:30] that mama and daddy you know he said
[45:32] they i see him they got in the floor
[45:35] which he doesn't say they're praying but
[45:36] we can figure that out he said they
[45:39] they're getting in the floor and they're
[45:40] they're restless and they're saying
[45:42] lord watch over where you know watch
[45:44] over my boy the boy had gone
[45:47] and he said that ain't that night after
[45:50] the parents got on the floor the angel
[45:52] of the lord visited that boy in the
[45:54] pigpen
[45:56] and said wake up you go home
[45:58] and he said that's what happened how the
[45:59] prodigal came home
[46:01] he also says in adoption number two
[46:03] paragraph 16 he says you you mothers
[46:06] you know
[46:08] he said your children you know i don't
[46:10] care how wayward and i always hang on to
[46:11] those words i don't care how wayward
[46:14] that boy or that girl is
[46:17] you know their promise to you so
[46:20] that being said so this this year in
[46:22] january
[46:23] i was
[46:25] climbing in bed
[46:27] and all of a sudden
[46:28] i just
[46:30] saw it was a little six minute uh
[46:32] youtube clip
[46:33] it was some it was a different brother a
[46:35] different church i'd i don't even watch
[46:37] those and it but i'd seen it like months
[46:40] prior
[46:41] and then this came back to my memory him
[46:43] saying you don't have to worry about
[46:45] your children
[46:46] and i thought yeah i wonder what else he
[46:48] said i came from and then right then
[46:51] in my room
[46:52] brother david was standing there
[46:54] and he said
[46:56] you don't have to worry about your
[46:58] children
[46:59] because he's doing all the worrying for
[47:01] you
[47:03] well when that had actually happened was
[47:05] a prayer line like two years before in
[47:07] our first meetings we were here it was
[47:08] something brother david literally said
[47:09] to me while i was standing there for
[47:11] prayer
[47:12] so those two things and i thought okay
[47:14] i'm not
[47:15] the lord's dealing with me i'm not thank
[47:17] i'm not thinking this the lord's telling
[47:19] me i don't have to worry
[47:21] so i came to church that sunday
[47:23] and this is again about a week or two
[47:24] before brother jason watkins was here
[47:27] and brother david was up there and uh he
[47:29] said
[47:30] okay this is a disclaimer this is not
[47:32] about your children he said i will
[47:34] always stand with you
[47:36] god's going to give you your children
[47:38] and he said it's his reward to you they
[47:42] are your inheritance
[47:44] in that moment
[47:46] i then remembered that scripture that
[47:48] says lo children are a heritage of the
[47:50] lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[47:52] reward
[47:54] and the lord just dropped the veil he
[47:56] just showed me levi and christian are my
[47:58] reward
[47:59] and brother david had said you all have
[48:02] to go back and find it he said um that's
[48:04] your reward for serving him and i
[48:07] thought well that's so simple i didn't
[48:08] have to like
[48:09] you know get to church an hour early for
[48:11] a hundred years and just your different
[48:12] things
[48:14] because literally we heard it all we
[48:15] heard it all and so
[48:18] your reward for serving him and you know
[48:20] troy has word you know worried and
[48:21] worried and
[48:23] i know he's told me many is the time he
[48:24] has bowled over his steering wheel in
[48:27] his van and cried out lord save my boys
[48:32] okay so
[48:33] about you know about two years ago
[48:36] christian told us you know he was 15 he
[48:38] said i don't mom i just don't i don't
[48:41] feel that i believe the message
[48:44] i thought okay i can do two things and
[48:46] go one of two ways i can argue i can
[48:48] negotiate i can
[48:49] [Music]
[48:50] give him books i can
[48:52] or i can believe god and i can pray
[48:54] so i chose
[48:56] the latter
[48:57] we moved on we moved on but then the
[48:58] lord
[48:59] after brother david said that that
[49:01] sunday in january
[49:03] i started going okay that's my reward so
[49:05] i
[49:06] got in the floor and i said
[49:09] i said lord
[49:10] i believe you're gonna save my boys
[49:13] but i said what could you do with
[49:14] christian's life if you saved him before
[49:17] he was 18. i said would you would you do
[49:19] that for me
[49:20] i know i can't ask you for a certain
[49:22] time
[49:23] i realize that's your business i
[49:26] i know that i you know i love you i'll
[49:28] always serve you but i don't know that i
[49:30] could
[49:31] make it without him i don't i don't
[49:32] think
[49:33] i could have my other arm blown off and
[49:36] make it
[49:37] and so about a month later
[49:39] the lord saved christian
[49:41] and when he came home
[49:49] and when he
[49:51] came home from the oklahoma camp and he
[49:53] told me about it
[49:55] and
[49:55] his whole little face was beaming with
[49:58] joy and he said mom i didn't know i
[50:00] didn't know god loved me
[50:01] and i
[50:02] realized he was you know telling me
[50:04] something so i said so you do now like
[50:06] he
[50:07] he showed you that he loved you you felt
[50:09] that he loved you yes and he said mom i
[50:12] have joy and i have a peace now and he
[50:15] has been a completely hundred percent
[50:17] different human being in our home
[50:20] but one thing i prayed when i asked for
[50:22] him i said
[50:23] you know what could you do in our home
[50:25] like you will change it to instead of
[50:27] two against two it'll be three against
[50:29] one
[50:31] and i was like you could you could
[50:32] change the dynamics in our home what
[50:34] could you do with his brother
[50:36] what could you do in the young people
[50:38] what could you do in our church what
[50:39] could you do in in the world if he was
[50:41] saved at 17
[50:43] and i said and i was weeping saying all
[50:45] this of course he can go prodigal of
[50:46] course he can come back later and we can
[50:48] sit and wait
[50:49] you know
[50:50] but i asked him what would you do with
[50:52] that and
[50:54] so my my thing is
[50:57] that when the lord said lo children are
[50:58] in heritage of the lord and the fruit of
[51:01] the womb is his reward i did not know
[51:04] what that meant
[51:05] and now i do
[51:06] and so now when i pray i don't even
[51:08] really ask for levi's soul i just say
[51:10] lord watch over your word to perform it
[51:14] just watch over your word to perform it
[51:16] that's all i ask and
[51:17] uh he's going to do that for me and i
[51:19] know that it will not be long
[51:27] it's my
[51:29] victory is mine wolf victory today
[51:33] is my
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:55] [Applause]
[52:05] is
[52:18] oh
[52:33] foreign
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:54] well praise the lord i think that's a
[52:56] beautiful segue for somebody else to
[52:58] testify
[53:00] and i could certainly testify of what
[53:02] god did in the the oklahoma meetings
[53:05] that we were in
[53:07] and so uh there was a few uh young men
[53:10] that were there that
[53:11] uh the god did something for and so i
[53:14] figure we'll just start with brother
[53:15] christian
[53:17] i don't know how this ended up in my
[53:18] hands
[53:20] i wanted i wanted to testify though um
[53:23] so
[53:24] during our february meetings i was still
[53:26] in a mindset mom said that i didn't
[53:29] believe the message but i didn't just
[53:30] not believe the message i hated it for
[53:33] all it stood for for all it was for all
[53:35] it made people do to me and my life and
[53:37] my brother and i just couldn't get past
[53:40] that it was it was stopping everything
[53:43] from coming to pass and i knew that's
[53:45] what i needed to be i knew i was part of
[53:47] the bride but i just couldn't
[53:49] do it
[53:50] like if god could let all this happen
[53:53] does he even care about me
[53:55] i felt forsaken for so long
[53:57] anyway so in our february meetings i
[53:59] just decided i was like well now i have
[54:01] all these christian friends now i can't
[54:03] quit church so i kind of have to hang
[54:05] out so i can be friends with them or
[54:06] else they'll disown me right i have to
[54:08] be in anyways
[54:10] so
[54:12] but we're talking with some friends and
[54:13] i see john telling somebody that he'll
[54:15] see someone at pawnee camp
[54:17] and i was like what i was like no you're
[54:18] not you're not going there and he was
[54:20] like
[54:21] he was like yeah we're good he's like
[54:22] i'm gonna try to go so i said i just
[54:24] said in the spur of the moment i'll go
[54:27] i didn't realize it was the lord
[54:29] anyways
[54:30] um so we ended up going and we got our
[54:32] own hotel we did everything we were just
[54:34] like yeah it's gonna be such a vibe but
[54:36] it was it was the lord
[54:39] every part of it was the lord
[54:41] anyways
[54:42] so
[54:44] we got through some services and the
[54:46] lord's dealing with my heart and their
[54:48] hearts as well
[54:49] and
[54:51] by saturday morning
[54:54] hi
[54:55] um
[54:57] by saturday night
[54:59] by saturday morning i should say rather
[55:01] i just decided that i don't care what it
[55:03] costs
[55:03] i'm going to go back i don't care what
[55:05] my brother says i don't care what my
[55:07] friends say i'm just going to keep going
[55:10] because this is what i meant to be this
[55:11] is who i am
[55:13] anyways and i had dealt with identity
[55:15] problems forever because i was avoiding
[55:18] what i was
[55:20] anyways
[55:24] so i was saved
[55:26] and i was like now i have to tell
[55:27] everybody
[55:28] i have to tell all these friends that i
[55:30] made that were in the church actually
[55:31] but they didn't believe as well and we
[55:33] had our little group and we're like yeah
[55:35] the message blah blah blah blah blah
[55:36] blah blah blah blah blah anyways
[55:39] so i told them they asked me they're
[55:40] like yo what's this about and i was like
[55:43] it's for me i was like it's for y'all
[55:45] too
[55:45] but it's for me
[55:47] [Applause]
[55:53] anyways so i'm on this new christian
[55:54] walk and it's amazing every day
[55:57] every day i'm just so happy and i know
[55:59] what i'm supposed to do and if i mess up
[56:01] i get right and i continue with my walk
[56:03] with the lord
[56:04] because i can't be hung up by it anymore
[56:08] we're called to go forward
[56:11] and so i'm praying and i have this new
[56:13] prayer list of things i want to pray
[56:14] about and see god do
[56:16] so i'm praying for all the lost souls
[56:18] that i've met outside of church and i'm
[56:20] praying for

[56:24] about it because
[56:27] we need it yeah um

[56:37] and so we go back from louisiana camp
[56:40] and like
[56:42] god answered my prayers and so that's

[1:05:39] in the past i have been like
[1:05:42] battling so much
[1:05:44] like in my head
[1:05:47] because like
[1:05:49] satan has been
[1:05:52] like putting terrible things in my head
[1:05:54] like
[1:05:56] hurting myself for no reason or like
[1:06:00] giving
[1:06:01] me
[1:06:02] like
[1:06:05] giving me terrible fears
[1:06:09] and
[1:06:11] i've been struggling with this since i
[1:06:13] was like around 11
[1:06:15] and it would like it was terrible
[1:06:19] and just me coming up here and telling
[1:06:22] my testimony is is a testimony itself
[1:06:27] and
[1:06:31] i don't know where to start
[1:06:34] um
[1:06:35] so
[1:06:37] my mom was telling me about the camp and
[1:06:40] i told her that i wasn't going and
[1:06:42] that's final like i wasn't going i was
[1:06:44] way too scared
[1:06:46] and
[1:06:49] but my dad didn't want me to go anyway
[1:06:52] and i had i just had a lot of homework
[1:06:55] and i was
[1:06:56] but my aunt
[1:06:58] my tia nena she kept
[1:07:00] telling me
[1:07:02] oh magda
[1:07:03] sister mug that
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:07] she kept telling my mom or insisting to
[1:07:10] my mom that i had to go because she had
[1:07:12] a dream of the services at camp that
[1:07:15] beautiful dreams about the camp
[1:07:17] and she just kept telling my mom that i
[1:07:19] had to go over and over
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:23] i
[1:07:25] right when i told my mom that i didn't
[1:07:27] want to go i felt my heart
[1:07:30] i felt my heart sank and like i felt
[1:07:32] like i was doing a terrible decision
[1:07:35] and
[1:07:39] i changed my mind last minute
[1:07:43] and so i went to camp i was very nervous
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:48] i'm when i was at camp i made so many
[1:07:51] friends and
[1:07:54] like
[1:07:55] god has blessed me with very good
[1:07:57] friends
[1:07:59] and i've never had any friends that were
[1:08:01] so close to god and
[1:08:05] i'm just so thankful for them
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:10] i never like
[1:08:12] understand any preachings
[1:08:15] i i would always have to ask my mom what
[1:08:17] the preaching was about but like at the
[1:08:19] camp i understood everything
[1:08:22] and like every preaching
[1:08:24] and
[1:08:26] like every time we we would pray after
[1:08:28] the preaching and i would always be
[1:08:31] shaking
[1:08:33] like in a bad way
[1:08:35] and
[1:08:37] the last time i was shaking i i was
[1:08:39] shaking a lot and the brothers they put
[1:08:41] their hands on my head
[1:08:43] and i just started shaking worse
[1:08:46] and believe she was right next to me
[1:08:48] putting her arm right around me
[1:08:51] and um
[1:08:55] then i
[1:08:56] i stopped shaking
[1:08:59] and i just started shouting praising the
[1:09:01] lord
[1:09:04] and i felt this peace and i felt so
[1:09:07] happy
[1:09:10] and
[1:09:12] i
[1:09:13] i opened my eyes and there was four
[1:09:15] sisters around me behind me
[1:09:18] and
[1:09:21] they were comforting me they were
[1:09:24] thanking god with me and
[1:09:27] they helped me get up and i just fell to
[1:09:29] the floor because my knees were numb
[1:09:32] and
[1:09:33] i couldn't even feel my feet touching
[1:09:35] the floor that's how numb they were
[1:09:38] and
[1:09:39] so we waited so my feet got better and i
[1:09:42] stood up i looked around the church and
[1:09:44] there was no one there no one except for
[1:09:47] the four sisters
[1:09:49] and i was like wow how long have i been
[1:09:51] here that explains why my knees are so
[1:09:53] numb
[1:09:59] and
[1:10:03] um well
[1:10:05] they just we all went to go eat lunch i
[1:10:07] went to go eat lunch with my friends and
[1:10:10] i just felt satan coming back to my head
[1:10:14] and put like worse
[1:10:17] and i did i didn't tell anyone i i
[1:10:20] wanted to keep it to myself i
[1:10:24] it was just terrible
[1:10:27] and
[1:10:30] i'm so excited to tell y'all
[1:10:37] um sorry
[1:10:40] so i just kept it to myself and
[1:10:44] it was already time to go
[1:10:47] and we were in the van and we were
[1:10:50] like
[1:10:51] we were singing we were
[1:10:54] laughing so much
[1:10:57] um
[1:10:59] but then like
[1:11:01] they start my
[1:11:02] my friends started telling their
[1:11:04] testimonies
[1:11:06] and i cried a little from happiness
[1:11:08] because their testimonies are
[1:11:11] and
[1:11:13] every time a like someone would tell
[1:11:16] their own testimony i would
[1:11:18] like the
[1:11:19] the voice inside my head got worse and
[1:11:21] worse and i was just battling more and
[1:11:23] more
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] right when the last girl was telling her
[1:11:31] testimony i just closed my eyes and i
[1:11:34] was facing the window
[1:11:37] and
[1:11:39] right when she was halfway done
[1:11:41] i didn't understand a word she was
[1:11:43] saying and
[1:11:46] i was just struggling so much
[1:11:51] and
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:11:53] then they were done and they started
[1:11:55] singing again
[1:11:57] and
[1:12:00] then i bursted out crying and
[1:12:04] because it was everything
[1:12:07] um
[1:12:09] um
[1:12:12] i just bursted out crying and the girl
[1:12:15] next to me
[1:12:16] i'm sorry i forgot your name
[1:12:19] um she put her hand on my on my arm
[1:12:25] and i started shaking terribly and i
[1:12:28] started twitching
[1:12:30] and like my hands made a form like this
[1:12:33] but i was i couldn't control it
[1:12:37] but i was like trying i was trying to
[1:12:38] cover my face
[1:12:40] i just
[1:12:41] didn't want anyone to see me
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:49] and then
[1:12:50] she said sister
[1:12:52] turn off the radio
[1:12:54] we're gonna pray for zoe
[1:12:57] and i my eyes are closed the whole time
[1:13:01] and
[1:13:02] i remember feeling arms go all around me
[1:13:04] like this
[1:13:05] they were all praying for me they were
[1:13:07] circling around me we were all in the
[1:13:09] highway during this
[1:13:13] and
[1:13:16] i just started yelling that i
[1:13:19] i was i couldn't do it anymore and
[1:13:23] everything was too hard
[1:13:28] and
[1:13:29] i was just going to give up
[1:13:34] and right at that moment while that was
[1:13:37] happening
[1:13:38] i kept getting a video in my head that
[1:13:41] or like an image that kept telling me to
[1:13:43] like jump out the van in the highway
[1:13:47] opening the door and jumping out
[1:13:52] and
[1:13:55] they they were listening to everything i
[1:13:57] was saying and then they started praying
[1:13:59] again

[1:19:46] amen praise the lord well
[1:19:49] we'll just open up this opportunity to
[1:19:52] any of the youth
[1:19:54] that were at camp that want to testify
[1:19:58] if you want to maybe lift up your hand
[1:20:00] all right come forward sister
[1:20:03] anita you'll be next is there another
[1:20:05] one
[1:20:08] praise god we're going to be here all
[1:20:10] night
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:24] okay
[1:20:25] so basically
[1:20:26] before camp
[1:20:28] it was about a month before camp
[1:20:31] brother matthew came back from oklahoma
[1:20:33] camp and he preached a sermon on that
[1:20:35] wednesday night and i went up for prayer
[1:20:37] and i just had a desire for just more of
[1:20:40] god in my life i knew that
[1:20:42] i had the holy ghost and it was a
[1:20:44] revelation in my heart but i just wanted
[1:20:46] to be more
[1:20:48] visible in my life and i wanted other
[1:20:50] people to see me like see god in me so i
[1:20:53] went up for prayer and
[1:20:55] he spoke directly to me and i believe it
[1:20:58] was god
[1:20:59] just speaking directly to me and he just
[1:21:01] said
[1:21:05] i actually have i've written down what
[1:21:07] he said but i wanted to say that till
[1:21:08] the end he basically just told me that
[1:21:11] you know
[1:21:14] there's people in your life that
[1:21:16] you know you should have witnessed too
[1:21:17] and there's people in your life right
[1:21:19] now that you should be witnessing too
[1:21:21] and god wants you to do that
[1:21:23] and it was just so amazing to me
[1:21:26] because i i just been caught i've been
[1:21:28] feeling called for about like a year now
[1:21:30] just to be more of a witness and
[1:21:33] i just wanted more of that in my life so
[1:21:35] i was just so blessed by that and then
[1:21:38] my i wasn't even actually i wasn't even
[1:21:40] planning on going to camp until stellar
[1:21:43] talked to me like a week and a half
[1:21:44] before camp and i just like
[1:21:46] yeah i want to go just all of a sudden
[1:21:48] so i got in right away without any
[1:21:50] problems
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:53] then i was like okay so i need to be
[1:21:55] expecting something for camp so
[1:21:57] my prayer for camp was just that
[1:22:01] and my prayer before this like before i
[1:22:02] even knew i was going to camp was just
[1:22:04] like okay i know
[1:22:06] i'm going to witness to my friend or my
[1:22:08] friends the whole world
[1:22:11] but i just wanted
[1:22:15] god to be more visible in my life so
[1:22:17] that they could see god through me so
[1:22:18] then when i did testify they would know
[1:22:21] that it was god because they could see
[1:22:22] my life
[1:22:25] and i just wanted more of that in my
[1:22:27] life and i was going to camp for that
[1:22:28] and for my mom and i just i was
[1:22:31] expecting so much and
[1:22:33] the
[1:22:34] night before camp i read this from the
[1:22:36] unchangeable god working in an
[1:22:38] unexpected way it says if you've got the
[1:22:41] holy ghost take a hold of it like jacob
[1:22:43] did and hold
[1:22:44] hold to it until the positive results
[1:22:47] come amen believe it friends if you will
[1:22:49] do an unexpected place how much more
[1:22:51] should he do it tonight in an expected
[1:22:53] place when we're expecting to see it
[1:22:54] happen
[1:22:56] so like that was my quote camp
[1:22:58] kind of and i would just read that
[1:23:00] before the services and there's other
[1:23:02] things too that
[1:23:04] i was reading and god confirmed it to me
[1:23:06] but
[1:23:07] so i was just praying that all through
[1:23:09] camp and
[1:23:11] friday night i kind of just got that
[1:23:12] confirmation that
[1:23:14] god was in me and that i had the holy
[1:23:16] spirit but i just and so that was just a
[1:23:18] piece that i knew that
[1:23:20] if i had that confirmation god was going
[1:23:22] to give me more of him and it was going
[1:23:23] to be something tangible in my life that
[1:23:25] i could share with others so i went
[1:23:28] through the prayer line on saturday
[1:23:30] night
[1:23:31] with jordan
[1:23:33] and we went through it together
[1:23:35] and
[1:23:36] so i just went through and i was like
[1:23:39] okay i'm gonna go through for my mom i
[1:23:41] know that god can give me what i desire
[1:23:43] for myself but i'm going through from my
[1:23:45] mom
[1:23:46] and i know that god will bless me
[1:23:51] sorry
[1:23:53] and so
[1:23:55] i got to through the prayer line and i
[1:23:57] just accepted everything that i was
[1:23:58] praying for
[1:24:00] and so i sat down and jordan sat next to
[1:24:03] me and she grabbed my hand and
[1:24:05] i just started
[1:24:07] breaking down and praying and crying and
[1:24:10] just asking god to
[1:24:15] meet my desires and to heal my mom and
[1:24:18] just other things in my life
[1:24:20] and
[1:24:21] so after she just stayed and prayed with
[1:24:23] me and held my hand and just kept
[1:24:25] praying with me
[1:24:27] and after she prayed with me
[1:24:30] i hugged her
[1:24:32] and then
[1:24:34] it was
[1:24:35] it was just god talking through her i
[1:24:37] know it was and
[1:24:39] she was so anointed and she just started
[1:24:41] talking to me and she was like
[1:24:44] she said other things but the main thing
[1:24:46] that stood out to me was
[1:24:48] if you stand for god he'll stand for you
[1:24:50] he'll stand for your family he'll stand
[1:24:52] for your mom
[1:24:53] you just have to stand for him and she
[1:24:55] didn't know what i was going to camp for
[1:24:57] i never told her but
[1:24:59] it was just so perfect and like
[1:25:01] i knew that if i obeyed god and told my
[1:25:04] friends about what he'd done for me then
[1:25:06] he would
[1:25:07] bless me and heal my mom and do other
[1:25:09] things in my life that i wanted
[1:25:12] so i just took that and that was like
[1:25:15] that was like what i got from camp and
[1:25:18] sunday morning service i was just
[1:25:19] praising him for what he'd done for me
[1:25:21] and confirming everything for me
[1:25:23] and then
[1:25:25] sunday in the car ride um
[1:25:29] we were just giving our testimonies like
[1:25:31] zoe said and
[1:25:32] i realized um
[1:25:35] when we were telling the testimonies
[1:25:36] that she wasn't
[1:25:38] okay like she just seemed like
[1:25:42] she needed something or i don't know i
[1:25:44] had the feeling that maybe she didn't
[1:25:45] get like what she came to camp for or
[1:25:48] something and
[1:25:49] so we i didn't i left it alone though i
[1:25:51] didn't know if she was tired or
[1:25:52] something and
[1:25:53] then we started singing and then i saw
[1:25:55] her she was sitting right next to me to
[1:25:57] the right of me
[1:25:59] and
[1:26:00] um
[1:26:01] she started shaking and like she said
[1:26:03] and i told sister laura i said turn off
[1:26:05] the music we're going to pray for zoe
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:09] i just
[1:26:10] told was telling the whole van that and
[1:26:12] so i laid my hands on her i was just
[1:26:14] telling everybody to lay
[1:26:15] their hands on her and i just started
[1:26:17] speaking
[1:26:19] like it was just god in me just speaking
[1:26:21] and
[1:26:24] it was so it was so amazing it was just
[1:26:27] the presence of god came down
[1:26:30] and it was just so powerful and
[1:26:33] so proud of all the girls in that fan
[1:26:35] and just
[1:26:37] what's what god's sorry
[1:26:40] what god's doing in their lives too
[1:26:45] and
[1:26:45] after she got her victory it was just
[1:26:48] it was like god confirmed it all over
[1:26:50] again and it was like that moment that's
[1:26:52] like that's what i went to camp for it
[1:26:54] was like i went to camp for god to move
[1:26:57] visibly in my life
[1:26:59] and that was
[1:27:01] that was an answer to my prayer
[1:27:04] and so
[1:27:05] that was just so amazing and
[1:27:09] so i was just rejoicing and then
[1:27:12] saturday i mean sunday night was just
[1:27:14] amazing and i just felt so much freedom
[1:27:17] that i've never felt in my life and
[1:27:20] it's so amazing and
[1:27:22] so last night
[1:27:24] i decided to read
[1:27:26] because i had written down what brother
[1:27:28] matthew had told me
[1:27:30] whenever i went up to prayer like a
[1:27:31] month ago and i was like oh i should
[1:27:34] read like what he had told me because i
[1:27:35] knew like that night that it was god
[1:27:37] talking to me so i was like oh i better
[1:27:39] write this down
[1:27:40] and i'll read to you what it said
[1:27:42] what
[1:27:45] and he said
[1:27:46] you have a purpose in my life
[1:27:48] i'm you have a purpose
[1:27:50] no
[1:27:51] you have a purpose in your life just
[1:27:53] like esther god placed you in your
[1:27:55] family with your group of friends with
[1:27:57] your life experiences for a purpose and
[1:27:59] he said
[1:28:00] you're holding back on telling some
[1:28:02] friends about god god might be waiting
[1:28:04] to bless you until you do this
[1:28:06] go up to a friend and say you know what
[1:28:08] you're such a good friend to me that i
[1:28:09] want to tell you about the best thing
[1:28:10] that ever happened to me
[1:28:12] and monday i told my friend everything
[1:28:14] that happened to me at camp and i just
[1:28:17] i'm just waiting for god to
[1:28:19] move on her i can't
[1:28:21] do anything but tell her like what god
[1:28:23] did for me
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:35] i want to read first corinthians chapter
[1:28:37] 12
[1:28:40] verse 12.
[1:28:44] if they can put that up there for me
[1:28:47] but
[1:28:49] i just lord put this
[1:28:52] scripture on my heart before we started
[1:28:59] for as the body is one
[1:29:01] and have many members
[1:29:03] and all members of that one body being
[1:29:06] many are one body
[1:29:08] so also is christ
[1:29:10] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:29:12] into one body whether we be jews or
[1:29:14] gentiles whether we be bond or free and
[1:29:16] we've been all made to drink into one
[1:29:18] spirit
[1:29:19] for the body is not one member
[1:29:22] but many
[1:29:23] if the foot shall say because i am not
[1:29:25] the hand i am not of the body
[1:29:28] is it therefore not of the body and if
[1:29:29] the ear shall say because i am not of
[1:29:31] the i am not of the body is it therefore
[1:29:32] not of the body
[1:29:35] if the whole body or an eye where where
[1:29:37] would be the hearing if a whole we're
[1:29:40] hearing where would be the smelling
[1:29:42] but now hath god set the members every
[1:29:45] one of them in the body
[1:29:47] as it hath pleased
[1:29:50] him
[1:29:52] praise the lord i love to see god using
[1:29:56] every single part of the body
[1:29:58] and i think if you just start to open up
[1:30:00] your heart
[1:30:01] and say lord
[1:30:02] use me i'm going to surrender my all or
[1:30:04] that you can use me god has a purpose in
[1:30:06] your life
[1:30:07] amen sister anita if you want to testify
[1:30:17] praise the
[1:30:18] lord okay
[1:30:21] so
[1:30:21] with me um
[1:30:24] i remember before camp i had this
[1:30:26] question in my mind what does it mean to
[1:30:28] fully surrender
[1:30:30] like how do you do that
[1:30:32] and so i remember i was talking to noel
[1:30:34] i think the night that brother matthew
[1:30:36] preached because i couldn't go to sleep
[1:30:37] because i was so happy about what god
[1:30:40] had done for me that service
[1:30:41] but then
[1:30:43] she asked me what are you expecting i
[1:30:44] was like i want god to do something that
[1:30:47] he's never done for me in my life
[1:30:50] so i went to a camp with that
[1:30:51] expectation and then thursday night the
[1:30:54] service was preached
[1:30:56] and something was like go get prayed for
[1:30:58] because prior to that i was in class and
[1:31:01] i remember a couple of years back um
[1:31:04] i went to get my blood drawn
[1:31:06] and my
[1:31:07] the doctor came up with the results that
[1:31:09] i may be pre-diabetic
[1:31:12] and then
[1:31:13] when i was really young i was like no
[1:31:14] i'm not i didn't claim that and then
[1:31:18] we were in class that week i think was
[1:31:20] last week and we did the finger printing
[1:31:22] because i'm in a medical assistant class
[1:31:23] so we do experience on each other my
[1:31:26] blood sugar was really high
[1:31:28] and i was like lord
[1:31:31] i need your blessed insurance in my life
[1:31:33] right now
[1:31:34] i remember back i would build this devil
[1:31:37] and i'm gonna rebuke it now and so
[1:31:40] that friday morning i went into the
[1:31:42] prayer line and i got prayed for and i
[1:31:44] said lord
[1:31:45] i believe that you had done something
[1:31:47] for me and i'm gonna take this healing
[1:31:55] and i remember prior to that before that
[1:31:57] i i had to say to myself i was like lord
[1:32:00] for that confirmation of that healing
[1:32:02] i want you to say this statement
[1:32:05] about my healing and now know that
[1:32:08] indeed you have healed me
[1:32:10] so service had gone by and then it was
[1:32:12] all the way towards the end of the
[1:32:14] service and the word the statement had
[1:32:16] not been said and two brother team who
[1:32:18] it was praying he was like lay hands on
[1:32:20] another have your own prayer line and i
[1:32:22] just began to pray i poured out
[1:32:24] everything that i had and he said that
[1:32:26] exact statement
[1:32:27] and i began to rejoice because i knew
[1:32:29] what the lord has done for me
[1:32:33] but that wasn't all i was like lord i
[1:32:36] still want more
[1:32:37] there has to be there has to be more i
[1:32:39] still want more
[1:32:41] so even before the prayer line i was
[1:32:43] kind of like i was scared
[1:32:45] i was like i don't know where this fear
[1:32:46] is coming from
[1:32:48] you know i went through the prayer line
[1:32:49] but one thing i noticed even after the
[1:32:50] prayer line i still feel like i didn't
[1:32:53] fully surrender
[1:32:54] and something was just like something
[1:32:56] needed to come out like something needed
[1:32:58] to come out
[1:33:00] so i went to sleep and i couldn't that
[1:33:03] night after the prayer line i couldn't
[1:33:05] sleep
[1:33:06] like i tried all that i can do
[1:33:09] i tried playing some music with my
[1:33:10] airpods nothing i couldn't sleep
[1:33:13] and then that morning when i woke up i
[1:33:15] was really shaky like you know there was
[1:33:17] like that fear like that panic or like
[1:33:19] anxiety that was trying to attack me for
[1:33:21] service i just put on my clothes and i
[1:33:22] began to walk and it kept on getting
[1:33:24] worse
[1:33:25] and then at the door i had asked a
[1:33:27] couple of dickens to pray for me but
[1:33:28] again it was like just like i just need
[1:33:30] prayers i can get through the service
[1:33:32] and go home
[1:33:34] and then when the service began they
[1:33:36] started singing victory is mine but i
[1:33:38] couldn't form the words to say victory
[1:33:40] is mine
[1:33:41] because i didn't feel really free so
[1:33:43] when somebody was beginning to sing
[1:33:45] especially i walked outside
[1:33:46] and i walked out my counselor followed
[1:33:48] me because i told her i wasn't feeling
[1:33:49] good
[1:33:50] and it was an anxiety attack that began
[1:33:52] attacking me that panic attack
[1:33:55] everything and then that's when brother
[1:33:57] joe adams when he was he was standing on
[1:33:59] the other side of the building he came
[1:34:00] over and he began to pray
[1:34:07] and at that moment i could hear that
[1:34:08] spirit saying i want her
[1:34:12] i came to say it all over again i want
[1:34:14] her and then what's the joy adam said
[1:34:16] why it's like because i know that she's
[1:34:18] a walking testimony
[1:34:20] that's why i want her
[1:34:21] and it's me i was like i don't want this
[1:34:23] spirit in me
[1:34:25] i want to be free
[1:34:27] and so we prayed out and exposed every
[1:34:29] single thing from the chat from the time
[1:34:32] i was a child growing up exposing every
[1:34:34] single thing that has ever attacked me
[1:34:36] off and i felt really free
[1:34:38] that god has indeed delivered me
[1:34:49] and that morning i had written something
[1:34:51] in my journal like that service because
[1:34:52] i couldn't even open my bible to read it
[1:34:54] i'd written something inside of it and
[1:34:56] i'm going to read it
[1:35:00] it was like dear lord i believe that you
[1:35:02] did something for me this camp
[1:35:04] lord i rebuked that devil that would try
[1:35:06] to bring any fear in me
[1:35:08] having me bound
[1:35:10] father let your word come and speak to
[1:35:12] me this sunday today lord thank you for
[1:35:14] all that you've done for me may the
[1:35:16] service on this last day really speak to
[1:35:18] me my needs whatever you have for me
[1:35:21] lord cleanse me to every worldly fiber
[1:35:23] is burnt out of me
[1:35:28] and that's my testimony
[1:35:30] and i just went back in i was just
[1:35:32] rejoicing and i remember at the end of
[1:35:34] the service
[1:35:36] where the angel spencer said the lord
[1:35:39] assuming to give it each and every young
[1:35:41] person another chance
[1:35:43] and that time i was like i'm gonna claim
[1:35:45] that i'm gonna i'm gonna claim that god
[1:35:47] did something for me and i'm gonna stomp
[1:35:49] on that devil's head and let him know
[1:35:52] that god did something for me
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:36:03] and so
[1:36:04] i remember i got back home you know even
[1:36:06] after the amazing evening service he
[1:36:08] came back he was trying to battle me
[1:36:09] he's like you really didn't get that
[1:36:11] deliverance i was like yes i did
[1:36:14] i got that deliverance and he kept
[1:36:16] inviting me all day monday and yesterday
[1:36:18] it was even worse even today
[1:36:21] and i was like i was trying to rebuke i
[1:36:23] was like you know what instead of trying
[1:36:25] to say the devil is putting this thing
[1:36:26] in my mind he's doing this let me just
[1:36:28] start praising the lord for what he's
[1:36:29] done for me
[1:36:33] and so this afternoon this afternoon i
[1:36:36] went to pick up my brother and so as i
[1:36:38] was he had gone inside and i stayed in
[1:36:40] the car for a little bit and as i was
[1:36:42] walking in the house
[1:36:45] i looked at my phone and it was a
[1:36:47] notification from lifeline
[1:36:49] and it said you are free
[1:36:51] and to me that was my confirmation i was
[1:36:54] like god is really mindful
[1:36:56] and so i clicked on it says the price
[1:36:58] that was paid and the bondage of satan
[1:37:01] was broke god put it back into the hands
[1:37:03] of man a way back to what he was looking
[1:37:05] for
[1:37:06] he had to weep no more hit when he broke
[1:37:08] the backbone of satan there at calvary
[1:37:11] the backbone of sin and sickness and it
[1:37:13] brings every mortal being on earth back
[1:37:15] into the presence of god with the sins
[1:37:17] forgiven hallelujah our sins are
[1:37:19] forgiven no one can satan black herself
[1:37:22] from god there's a highway made there's
[1:37:24] a telephone sitting there there's a line
[1:37:26] to glory brings every person in reach of
[1:37:28] that line if a man is full of sin it
[1:37:31] connected him on central he can be
[1:37:34] forgiven of that sin not only that but
[1:37:36] his sin is paid off or you don't have to
[1:37:38] say i'm not worthy sure you're not you
[1:37:41] could never be better where the one took
[1:37:43] your place you are free you don't have
[1:37:45] to wonder anymore you don't have to be a
[1:37:47] pleasure seeking men out there on the
[1:37:49] earth for there is a fountain filled
[1:37:51] with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins
[1:37:53] where sinners plunge beneath the flood
[1:37:55] lose all their guilty sins you don't
[1:37:57] have to be lost there's a highway and a
[1:37:59] way and it's called a way of holiness
[1:38:01] the unclean don't pass over it for he
[1:38:03] comes to the mountain first and then he
[1:38:05] enters the highway
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:13] oh i just love that boy praise god for

[1:38:26] the message of the hour to redeem his
[1:38:28] bride and that's what you do you take

[1:41:44] when the lord does something for someone
[1:41:46] he's obligated to do it justice
[1:41:53] he delivered me from that fear that i've
[1:41:56] been dealing with

[1:42:40] god is so good
[1:42:42] and he's so wonderful to us praise his
[1:42:44] wonderful name
[1:42:46] prayer changes things
[1:42:48] prayer changes things amen
[1:42:51] hallelujah another
[1:42:53] which i know some sisters put up their
[1:42:55] hands
[1:42:56] sister jordan
[1:43:01] so my testimony is kind of about ella a
[1:43:04] little bit
[1:43:07] so
[1:43:08] um you know
[1:43:11] i don't even know what i'm gonna say
[1:43:13] sorry um but like
[1:43:15] i just been asking god to move in my
[1:43:17] life personally like
[1:43:19] with my friends and stuff it's good to
[1:43:20] see
[1:43:22] the lord working in other people but i
[1:43:23] want to see him working in me
[1:43:25] and
[1:43:26] i know brother david talks about like
[1:43:27] that still small voice that's guiding
[1:43:29] you and
[1:43:31] stuff like that and i almost didn't go
[1:43:33] to camp because of an exam
[1:43:35] and
[1:43:36] my teacher said i couldn't take it early
[1:43:38] and i couldn't take it late
[1:43:40] and then she got bronchitis so it got
[1:43:42] moved
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:58] so
[1:44:00] ella told me
[1:44:01] she was going and i got so excited i
[1:44:03] don't know why i was like i was going to
[1:44:05] camp i want to go to camp like i really
[1:44:07] want to go to camp
[1:44:08] and so
[1:44:10] that
[1:44:11] saturday night before we went to the
[1:44:13] like saturday night service we ended up
[1:44:14] sitting by each other
[1:44:16] and the whole time we were about to go
[1:44:17] to the prayer line
[1:44:19] and i was like lord i want to be right
[1:44:20] by ella like the whole time i just
[1:44:22] wanted ella right behind me the whole
[1:44:24] time and i didn't know why
[1:44:27] and so
[1:44:28] i didn't really go to camp with anything
[1:44:30] exactly on my mind so i was just praying
[1:44:31] for other people praying for my friends
[1:44:34] and so
[1:44:35] we would get separated and then we'd get
[1:44:37] back together and so after the prayer
[1:44:39] line i went through and i didn't have a
[1:44:41] single thought in my mind just like
[1:44:43] thank you lord for all you've done
[1:44:45] and so immediately after we sat down
[1:44:48] i just started praying with her and just
[1:44:50] so much just came in my mind you know to
[1:44:52] say to her
[1:44:54] and after all that
[1:44:56] it was like
[1:44:57] just let me use you how i want to
[1:44:59] you don't have to look for anything big
[1:45:01] you know you might not
[1:45:03] go out and sing or you know tell it you
[1:45:06] know but just let me use you how i want
[1:45:08] to use you and that will be more
[1:45:10] beneficial than you just doing it on
[1:45:12] your own
[1:45:13] and so i was so thankful that the lord
[1:45:15] likes still using me and so then we came
[1:45:18] home sunday night
[1:45:19] and the ministers had been preaching
[1:45:21] about how your dances are like it comes
[1:45:23] after victory and so
[1:45:26] um
[1:45:27] sunday night we were
[1:45:29] singing um
[1:45:30] just call him up and i was like lord i
[1:45:32] want to praise you for my victory
[1:45:34] i want my victory dance and just sitting
[1:45:37] in my seat
[1:45:38] such a presence came over me and i just
[1:45:40] started dancing for the lord and i got
[1:45:42] my victory so i'm thankful for that
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:50] i tell you what the devil made me do a
[1:45:52] lot of crazy things when i was out in
[1:45:54] the world
[1:45:55] and so i figured you know what if i gave
[1:45:58] the devil that much when i was out there
[1:45:59] serving him
[1:46:00] why can't i give my altar when i'm
[1:46:02] serving the lord i want to give him
[1:46:04] everything
[1:46:05] give him my voice give him my hands give
[1:46:07] him my feet give him my mind whatever it
[1:46:09] is that's wonderful to hear god using
[1:46:11] each one of you in such a mighty way is
[1:46:13] there another one that was at camp
[1:46:15] praise the lord
[1:46:16] i didn't plan on testifying but i want
[1:46:18] to give this to the glory of god
[1:46:20] i went to camp not really having
[1:46:22] anything specific in my mind just
[1:46:24] knowing because i've gone so many years
[1:46:26] that like just knowing that when you're
[1:46:27] in the presence of the lord he's gonna
[1:46:29] do something for you so i just went with
[1:46:30] like an open mind
[1:46:32] an open heart um
[1:46:34] one thing like that i was struggling
[1:46:36] with a lot is like feelings of
[1:46:37] unworthiness and like i believe i have
[1:46:40] the holy ghost but i would just maybe
[1:46:42] like not live up to where i knew i could
[1:46:44] live and then i would just start to feel
[1:46:46] so unworthy um i think it was i don't
[1:46:49] even remember what service it was but
[1:46:51] um i didn't even need a warm-up service
[1:46:53] like the first service that we got there
[1:46:55] i just um
[1:46:57] renounced that and i um just resurrended
[1:46:59] my life to god again and just felt like
[1:47:02] a peace and just knowing that i'm not
[1:47:04] the person who
[1:47:06] is doing this on my own just surrender
[1:47:08] everything to him and he'll live through
[1:47:10] me and i just um got that peace
[1:47:12] um but there was still something on my
[1:47:14] heart
[1:47:15] like john testified i'm so happy to see
[1:47:17] like what god did for him and with
[1:47:19] christian and just watching that change
[1:47:21] and then when they got back from camp
[1:47:23] but
[1:47:24] for me like i had another burden on my
[1:47:26] heart for for israel
[1:47:29] um because he yeah he just hasn't been
[1:47:31] going the right way and
[1:47:33] um so i went up to the prayer line for
[1:47:35] that
[1:47:36] because i already felt like god gave me
[1:47:38] what i needed and i just that was like
[1:47:40] the thing that was on my mind in my
[1:47:42] heart so
[1:47:43] i went up to the prayer line and i went
[1:47:46] through and i already like i felt like i
[1:47:48] had faith
[1:47:49] so like i went through and i didn't
[1:47:51] think i didn't think of it and i was
[1:47:52] like praise god like i you know i
[1:47:55] believe that
[1:47:56] um
[1:47:57] well
[1:47:58] after camp so camp goes by the services
[1:48:00] were amazing and also i just want to
[1:48:02] insert here that brother ron said
[1:48:04] something that kind of spoke to what i
[1:48:05] was talking about about unworthiness he
[1:48:07] says the devil wants you to feel
[1:48:10] unworthy because he knows the power you
[1:48:12] have like like camp was a lot about that
[1:48:15] about like us stepping into what god has
[1:48:17] for us and not like listening to the
[1:48:19] devil's eyes and
[1:48:21] yeah so anyways so fast forward camp is
[1:48:24] over and we were supposed to leave on
[1:48:26] sunday afternoon
[1:48:28] um but like one of my friends had the
[1:48:30] idea like why don't you just stay the
[1:48:31] extra day
[1:48:32] so um i ended up staying
[1:48:35] and coming back monday but that sunday
[1:48:37] night there was like a fellowship at a
[1:48:39] brother's house
[1:48:41] from the church in louisiana
[1:48:43] and like it was amazing we were just
[1:48:45] worshiping the lord and then at one
[1:48:46] point
[1:48:48] um we were just all singing and then
[1:48:51] a brother comes in and he kind of like
[1:48:53] has a serious face like his mood is
[1:48:54] immediately just he walks in it's just
[1:48:56] like you can tell like what's happening
[1:48:58] and he says if you need something from
[1:49:00] god
[1:49:02] now is the time the waters being stirred
[1:49:04] outside and they were having a prayer
[1:49:06] line in the front yard
[1:49:08] and i just
[1:49:09] i felt like i had what i needed but in
[1:49:11] the moment when he said that i was like
[1:49:13] i'm just gonna go out again and so i
[1:49:15] went to the like i went to the prayer
[1:49:17] line that was outside
[1:49:18] um and then
[1:49:21] i kind of stepped out to pray with a
[1:49:22] friend and then i came back and
[1:49:24] i just had israel on my heart again
[1:49:27] and i was thinking to myself like maybe
[1:49:30] like when he said that like if you need
[1:49:32] something from god
[1:49:34] that waters me right now i said maybe
[1:49:36] god had me say an extra day for this
[1:49:38] purpose like
[1:49:39] to claim that right and the two brothers
[1:49:42] that were playing praying in the prayer
[1:49:43] line like praying for people they know
[1:49:45] israel personally and they've like seen
[1:49:47] his life and so when i go up there and i
[1:49:49] tell him like what i'm praying for
[1:49:50] brother joe adams is like
[1:49:52] i know him and i know like he just kind
[1:49:54] of spoke really encouraging words and
[1:49:57] um i was thinking about the another
[1:49:59] testimony that i've heard where there's
[1:50:01] another sister praying for her brother
[1:50:02] and then that night he
[1:50:04] like runs into service in his pajamas
[1:50:06] and gives his heart to the lord and i
[1:50:08] was just thinking to myself like if god
[1:50:10] can do that like he can do that for for
[1:50:13] israel he can do that for anybody and i
[1:50:15] just had faith
[1:50:16] about it i just i
[1:50:18] really didn't have any doubt i just kind
[1:50:19] of wanted to like nail it in there and
[1:50:21] so like uh brother joe adams said um may
[1:50:25] you find it even as you said
[1:50:28] right and then i come back from um yeah
[1:50:30] so i was just like amen and
[1:50:33] even though
[1:50:35] like even though we don't feel it he's
[1:50:37] working and i just believe that like
[1:50:39] it'll be as
[1:50:40] as he said as i he said according to
[1:50:43] your faith like let it be as you said
[1:50:44] and i and i just claimed that and i just
[1:50:46] wanted to say that and give glory to god
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:54] you ask anything in my name
[1:50:58] i will do it
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:01] go ahead brother
[1:51:08] um god bless you
[1:51:10] um
[1:51:13] well
[1:51:14] when i went to camp um
[1:51:16] kind of like my sister said i kind of
[1:51:18] just went for like my friends and stuff
[1:51:20] i didn't really have like anything on my
[1:51:22] heart or like
[1:51:24] i just went for my friends
[1:51:27] hoping that because for the longest time
[1:51:29] i didn't have a lot of friends to be
[1:51:31] honest
[1:51:32] i just went to church a lot of them have
[1:51:34] to go inside of my car afterwards and
[1:51:37] just sit there and be like oh god's not
[1:51:39] giving me any friends why should i go
[1:51:40] outside and be like oh
[1:51:42] go worship and stuff but
[1:51:45] i remember
[1:51:47] um the pastor was
[1:51:49] talking and he was like oh
[1:51:51] you go to church and you worship god and
[1:51:53] then
[1:51:54] through
[1:51:55] listening to what
[1:51:57] what
[1:51:58] god has to say then
[1:52:00] friends and everything would follow
[1:52:01] after
[1:52:02] she was like i was like you know what
[1:52:04] i'm just gonna try i'm gonna
[1:52:06] go to start like praising the lord you
[1:52:08] know
[1:52:09] i'm gonna pray i prayed and praying a
[1:52:11] lot for my mom my family
[1:52:13] and for some reason just felt like
[1:52:15] nothing was working i saw
[1:52:17] my brother i really look up to him i i
[1:52:19] don't tell him this a lot but
[1:52:21] i see him and i'll say he's praising the
[1:52:23] lord i see him anita
[1:52:26] and i see a lot of other people and it's
[1:52:28] just like how come i can
[1:52:31] i can't do
[1:52:32] like i feel like i'm doing it but like
[1:52:35] i feel like it's not real
[1:52:37] i'm just faking everything
[1:52:40] and
[1:52:40] a lot of times the devil will be like oh
[1:52:43] like when you do have like you feel
[1:52:45] something god did something for you it's
[1:52:47] just like oh no that was a feeling
[1:52:49] i've been to
[1:52:50] last year i think it wasn't like a camp
[1:52:53] it was just like i think it was just the
[1:52:54] easter meetings we stayed in like a
[1:52:55] hotel
[1:52:56] um i was watching um like everybody go
[1:53:00] to the prayer line and everything and i
[1:53:01] was just like
[1:53:02] for some reason the devil kept on
[1:53:03] telling me that oh oh they're just doing
[1:53:05] that all because of emotion it's not
[1:53:07] real
[1:53:09] i would just sit there be like oh you
[1:53:10] know i don't have to go over there and
[1:53:12] just fake it so i just sit down and just
[1:53:15] i just didn't think it was real
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:18] um this camp um i went
[1:53:23] um again i was just going for the
[1:53:25] friends
[1:53:26] but when i was inside of the camp um one
[1:53:29] of my
[1:53:30] friends was like oh
[1:53:35] one of my friends was like oh
[1:53:38] well actually before this when i was at
[1:53:40] church like the pastor was like oh go
[1:53:43] beyond the camp and i really was like
[1:53:44] you know let me pray before i leave and
[1:53:46] just see like i didn't unders to be
[1:53:49] honest i didn't really understand what
[1:53:50] he meant by go beyond the camp just like
[1:53:52] let's let me pray and see like what god
[1:53:55] can do so basically for me to go beyond
[1:53:57] the camp let me just try to do something
[1:53:59] i wanted to get something out of this
[1:54:00] camp experience
[1:54:02] so when i did go um
[1:54:04] one of my friends told me oh
[1:54:07] that for this camp i really want to
[1:54:08] change
[1:54:09] um his name was ben by the way um
[1:54:12] and eventually like towards the end of
[1:54:14] camp i thought he was just like one of
[1:54:15] those laid-back people he got baptized
[1:54:17] and i was just really moved by that that
[1:54:19] god can move through somebody
[1:54:22] and i just feel like god really moved to
[1:54:24] me this
[1:54:25] this time going
[1:54:27] i went to the prayer line thinking that
[1:54:29] nothing was going to happen eventually
[1:54:31] same as last year i went through and
[1:54:34] seeing all those people while i was in
[1:54:35] the prayer line going through i saw like
[1:54:38] all these people coming out like crying
[1:54:39] and bald i just i just thought it was
[1:54:41] all fake again the devil was telling me
[1:54:43] it was all fake
[1:54:45] um but when i got there when i
[1:54:47] eventually got through the prayer line
[1:54:48] what i felt just it wasn't fake
[1:54:52] i knew it was real i knew something was
[1:54:54] happening
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:55:01] i just want to thank the lord even
[1:55:03] seeing some of my friends like christian
[1:55:05] and
[1:55:06] um
[1:55:08] seeing christian and um
[1:55:10] john testify just
[1:55:13] i
[1:55:13] i never thought that would happen
[1:55:16] but it's really it's really it's really
[1:55:18] great to see
[1:55:20] so i'm just like i was like you know if
[1:55:21] they can do it let me come up and test
[1:55:23] drive seeing my sister testify really
[1:55:25] moved me again
[1:55:26] and you know it just see me being here
[1:55:29] like i'm not really if you know me i'm
[1:55:31] not really like
[1:55:32] i don't like crying in front of people
[1:55:34] i'm usually laughing half the time
[1:55:38] but
[1:55:40] you know i just really felt obligated to
[1:55:42] come up and tell you guys my testimony
[1:55:44] since i did see everybody else saying
[1:55:48] [Applause]
[1:55:49] and i just wanted to thank you guys
[1:55:52] and i guess that's it
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:56:00] yep he can tell you it's fake all he
[1:56:02] wants but when it becomes real
[1:56:04] you got the real thing
[1:56:06] he's the one that's fake
[1:56:08] he just flat he just flaps his gums he's
[1:56:10] just a liar he's just a bluff
[1:56:13] oh my praise god
[1:56:15] well this
[1:56:16] this this might be dangerous but i want
[1:56:18] to say this and i'm going to direct it
[1:56:19] towards towards those youth that were at
[1:56:21] camp
[1:56:23] but if if god if you feel something on
[1:56:26] your heart to say something and you
[1:56:28] don't
[1:56:29] you're going to regret it
[1:56:31] and so this i'm going to give you an
[1:56:33] opportunity to raise your hand right now
[1:56:40] well
[1:56:42] i mean she's she just
[1:56:44] she's she's
[1:56:45] she's excited over there
[1:56:49] i have to say something like that
[1:56:50] nobody's been fighting me about it so i
[1:56:53] just i just know i have to say something
[1:56:54] so
[1:56:56] the lord placed like a scripture on my
[1:56:58] heart which is isaiah 59
[1:57:00] 19-21 which is
[1:57:03] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:57:05] from the west and his glory from the
[1:57:07] rising of the son when the enemy shall
[1:57:09] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:57:11] lord shall lift up the standard against
[1:57:12] him and the redeemer shall come to zion
[1:57:15] and unto them
[1:57:17] that turn from transgression and jacob
[1:57:19] saith the lord as for me this is my
[1:57:21] covenant with them saith the lord my
[1:57:23] spirit that is upon thee and my words
[1:57:26] which i have put in thy mouth shall not
[1:57:28] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[1:57:30] mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth
[1:57:32] of thy seed seed saith the lord from
[1:57:34] henceforth and forever
[1:57:38] so
[1:57:39] for camp i just i really just wanted
[1:57:42] a revelation of my freedom in christ and
[1:57:44] like
[1:57:45] i know i have the holy spirit and i know
[1:57:47] that the lord has delivered me from
[1:57:49] a lot of things and certain things and
[1:57:54] but there would still like come like
[1:57:57] thoughts of like doubt or like the devil
[1:57:58] would come and be like i'm going to get
[1:58:00] you again or i'm going to get you to do
[1:58:01] something again
[1:58:02] and even in my dreams and different
[1:58:05] things like just tormenting me
[1:58:07] and
[1:58:10] so god confirmed to me of that
[1:58:12] revelation and
[1:58:13] it was really unexpected for me because
[1:58:15] usually everyone is an expectation for
[1:58:18] saturday night and he did it for me
[1:58:20] friday night and i was just i was so
[1:58:23] blessed and i was just rejoicing in the
[1:58:24] lord
[1:58:25] and even afterwards the devil would come
[1:58:27] and like
[1:58:28] tell me like you know it was all
[1:58:29] emotional you're just you know he didn't
[1:58:31] really get anything
[1:58:32] and i just pray all night and
[1:58:35] in the morning
[1:58:36] all of those doubts and all those
[1:58:38] questions kind of went away and so i
[1:58:40] just want to testify you know the lord
[1:58:42] is good and he's faithful and he keeps
[1:58:44] his promises
[1:58:46] [Applause]
[1:58:56] praise the lord we'll go ahead and come
[1:58:58] up here
[1:58:59] come on up wait everybody wants to be
[1:59:01] able to see you come on up
[1:59:03] you got you got something to talk about
[1:59:06] go ahead
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:11] hey
[1:59:12] we're all like the woman at the well
[1:59:14] come see a man we we got something to
[1:59:17] talk about
[1:59:18] god bless you soon
[1:59:21] god bless you
[1:59:25] but i just wanted to testify that
[1:59:28] the lord touched my family
[1:59:34] so um
[1:59:37] my brothers have been such um
[1:59:40] had such a burden on my heart for my
[1:59:42] brothers
[1:59:45] and
[1:59:48] uh since the quarantine
[1:59:51] they have been slipping away i can see
[1:59:53] it in their lives
[1:59:56] just slowly backsliding and
[1:59:58] seeing your family
[2:00:01] in sin is so so painful
[2:00:05] and
[2:00:06] i never just spoke out about it i never
[2:00:10] like corrected them because
[2:00:13] my voice i've just been so silent
[2:00:16] and
[2:00:17] um
[2:00:20] but
[2:00:21] during camp
[2:00:23] um it was saturday night
[2:00:26] i there was a prayer line
[2:00:29] and i wanted to to go in the prayer line
[2:00:32] for them
[2:00:33] but something told me to wait and just
[2:00:35] to get my heart where i get my spirit
[2:00:37] right
[2:00:38] and um
[2:00:40] so i decided to wait and i worshiped i
[2:00:43] praised
[2:00:44] and usually when i sing i sing with like
[2:00:47] just sound nice with the church to you
[2:00:49] know be in harmony sound good you know
[2:00:52] but that service i truly i
[2:00:56] i
[2:00:57] had a desperate cry
[2:00:59] like they say bright blind bartimaeus he
[2:01:01] had a desperate cry and the lord heard
[2:01:03] him and i truly poured out my heart i
[2:01:06] sang with all my heart
[2:01:08] um
[2:01:09] i stayed until my voice was hoarse to my
[2:01:11] i couldn't sing i couldn't sing no more
[2:01:15] and um
[2:01:16] and i just saw my brother go up my older
[2:01:18] brother and go up in the line and just
[2:01:21] seeing that just put a spark in my heart
[2:01:23] and i praised i said lord because that's
[2:01:25] what i was praying for just something
[2:01:26] something small it doesn't matter lord
[2:01:28] just something anything to push him
[2:01:30] towards you and he went in that line and
[2:01:34] i believe he received something
[2:01:36] and um
[2:01:38] i wanted i still wanted to go and i
[2:01:41] thought my heart kept telling me to wait
[2:01:43] so i kept praising and worshiping and
[2:01:45] worshiping and worshiping and my um i
[2:01:48] saw my little brother go on the line and
[2:01:50] i said okay now i have to go i have to
[2:01:52] go so i went up to him i went up in the
[2:01:55] prayer line and there is this brother
[2:01:57] brother ron spencer
[2:01:59] he uh
[2:02:00] he has a spirit of discernment
[2:02:03] and he he spoke to me he pulled me aside
[2:02:06] and he said he saw angels all around me
[2:02:09] and that just opened my eyes to how
[2:02:11] spiritual this really all this is like
[2:02:13] how real
[2:02:15] and i've never like
[2:02:17] rejoiced and praised like like danced
[2:02:20] for the lord
[2:02:21] but
[2:02:22] my heart was lit up with joy and i truly
[2:02:26] worship and praise god
[2:02:28] and
[2:02:30] that's i have another testimony like my
[2:02:34] heart has a song in it now
[2:02:36] like i have a praise
[2:02:39] i no longer care like what how i praise
[2:02:42] or what people think
[2:02:44] my voice doesn't sound good i was keep
[2:02:46] singing i'll keep singing
[2:02:52] i'm just so so grateful and thankful and
[2:02:55] thankful that the lord touched my
[2:02:56] brothers ariel was baptized and that
[2:02:58] that just touched me tremendously
[2:03:00] because
[2:03:01] he was there was a point where
[2:03:04] you you couldn't see you can't there's
[2:03:06] no like i don't know there's no
[2:03:08] there's there was no hope but there's
[2:03:10] always hope there's always there's
[2:03:11] always always something and the lord
[2:03:14] just gave me something to hold on to
[2:03:16] and i believe for my brothers i'll stand
[2:03:18] in that junction for them
[2:03:20] that they both will completely receive
[2:03:23] the lord
[2:03:24] and
[2:03:25] please keep praying
[2:03:32] [Applause]
[2:03:36] god bless you
[2:03:38] if i'm going to do this right i have to
[2:03:40] start from the beginning so let's go
[2:03:42] back to 20
[2:03:49] 2018 let's go back to 2018
[2:03:51] that's far enough
[2:03:53] i mean
[2:03:55] we when we went to camp
[2:03:57] those years we went for the boys we
[2:04:00] didn't
[2:04:00] we didn't go for the word we
[2:04:03] you know the first time i remember
[2:04:04] brother billy
[2:04:06] like
[2:04:07] i have i don't tell him enough but i'm
[2:04:09] going to give him his flowers right now
[2:04:11] but
[2:04:12] one day he came to the house
[2:04:14] and he talked to my parents and said i
[2:04:16] want to take
[2:04:18] your kids to church this is when we
[2:04:19] first started coming here and he brought
[2:04:21] us here and camp was around the corner
[2:04:24] and uh brother billy had a burn on his
[2:04:26] heart for us to attend camp so
[2:04:28] he made a way for me and my brother to
[2:04:30] attend
[2:04:31] and at that time if you knew me there
[2:04:33] was one thing on my mind and one thing
[2:04:34] only
[2:04:35] basketball that's it
[2:04:37] no god no nothing just sports that's all
[2:04:41] i cared about
[2:04:42] i went to camp
[2:04:43] i watched people
[2:04:45] act a fool
[2:04:49] to me it didn't make sense like when
[2:04:51] everybody would get up to to clap or to
[2:04:53] praise or raise their hands and sing i
[2:04:55] did it because you know the dude left
[2:04:56] next to me did it so i was like well you
[2:04:58] know let me look spiritual too
[2:04:59] hallelujah
[2:05:01] but
[2:05:03] you can't fake that
[2:05:05] you don't know what you're asking for
[2:05:07] so
[2:05:08] there i am just going through the
[2:05:09] motions going through everything
[2:05:12] and in that moment
[2:05:14] the minister said something
[2:05:17] if you know my favorite is lebron and he
[2:05:20] said well he calls himself a king
[2:05:23] but he's not my king
[2:05:25] and i said have i made him a king
[2:05:27] without knowing that
[2:05:28] i made him a king
[2:05:30] and
[2:05:31] in that moment i can honestly say the
[2:05:33] work of the lord began in my life at
[2:05:35] that moment
[2:05:36] and it kept going
[2:05:38] so much so
[2:05:39] i would sacrifice i used to sacrifice
[2:05:41] coming to church to go to tournaments to
[2:05:43] go to games
[2:05:45] i started sacrificing my games and
[2:05:46] tournaments to come to church
[2:05:49] i realized
[2:05:51] that there's more importance in me being
[2:05:53] here
[2:05:53] and present than me being playing sports
[2:05:56] out for a team
[2:05:57] they may need me but god needs me more
[2:06:00] in fact the prophet said you can't make
[2:06:02] it without me
[2:06:04] all of them got to get there and i'm a
[2:06:06] part of that
[2:06:08] and the lord just kept working he kept
[2:06:10] working and working and working and
[2:06:13] brother david he would always throw
[2:06:14] these like slight comments at me like he
[2:06:17] he never forced me out into anything but
[2:06:20] he would throw like jabs
[2:06:22] he asked me one time he said would you
[2:06:23] give it up for god if god asked
[2:06:25] i answered yes but in my heart i knew i
[2:06:27] wasn't but i said yes and
[2:06:31] my junior year in high school
[2:06:34] the seniors leave and the seniors
[2:06:37] the season's over we go to playoffs we
[2:06:39] broke the school record and district
[2:06:41] records and they left and i cried i felt
[2:06:45] sad inside because i watched the people
[2:06:46] that i played basketball with who became
[2:06:48] my brothers leave and go to the next
[2:06:49] level and i was there well with my
[2:06:52] teammates that were still there and my
[2:06:54] dad gave me a comment he said son you'll
[2:06:56] cry for basketball
[2:06:58] you'll be sad for basketball your mood
[2:07:00] will change for basketball but for your
[2:07:02] own salvation you don't shed a tear
[2:07:04] nothing
[2:07:05] i said wow these hurt
[2:07:10] i started i started to feel it and that
[2:07:12] burning desire came in my heart and in
[2:07:14] 20 and i think it was 2018 2019 when you
[2:07:17] took us to pawnee camp wouldn't it i
[2:07:19] think so
[2:07:20] i had a burning desire in my heart i
[2:07:22] said god if you don't give me the holy
[2:07:23] ghost
[2:07:24] i'm gonna stay at that altar i'm not
[2:07:27] leaving if i gotta sleep there i'm
[2:07:28] asleep there but i'm not getting up till
[2:07:30] you give me something
[2:07:32] i would watch everybody else cry i'm not
[2:07:34] an emotional person
[2:07:36] even at funerals
[2:07:38] i feel the pain inside but you i don't
[2:07:41] cry i'm not a crier it's just not in my
[2:07:42] nature
[2:07:43] but i said lord everybody else cries
[2:07:46] something got to be wrong with me
[2:07:47] because if they're crying and i don't
[2:07:48] cry something's wrong
[2:07:50] i thank god for the chaperones and the
[2:07:52] work that they do for the sacrifice for
[2:07:55] getting us to camps it's more than just
[2:07:57] taking us there but they're present in
[2:07:59] the moment they're with us i went to the
[2:08:01] altar brother
[2:08:02] andrew glover was preaching and i i got
[2:08:05] on my knees and i prayed i tried i
[2:08:07] forced i tried enforced and forced
[2:08:09] myself to cry and not a tear came i said
[2:08:11] lord something's wrong
[2:08:13] like i i want to give myself to you but
[2:08:17] i can't i just can't i don't know what
[2:08:19] it is
[2:08:20] i don't know what spoke to brother
[2:08:21] cosman i don't know what it was
[2:08:23] but there i was praying
[2:08:25] brother cosmic comes around he puts his
[2:08:27] arm around me and all he said was oh god
[2:08:30] that was it i became a baby in that
[2:08:32] moment
[2:08:33] that i felt a peace like you can't even
[2:08:36] describe what kind of peace that was
[2:08:39] and right then in that moment i started
[2:08:40] to realize there was more value in me
[2:08:44] going division one in god's school
[2:08:46] than going division one in the world
[2:08:49] you can have the fame you can have the
[2:08:51] money you can have all that without god
[2:08:53] you have nothing
[2:08:56] god just kept working and working
[2:08:59] one day
[2:09:00] i got the chance i got the
[2:09:02] scholarship to go to penn state and go
[2:09:04] play basketball over there i had the
[2:09:06] opportunity
[2:09:07] one day i'm i'm on my way i'm on my way
[2:09:09] there they already planned for for me to
[2:09:11] take a flight to go over there to visit
[2:09:12] the school and everything
[2:09:14] and the next day i walked to my coach
[2:09:17] and say coach i'm giving it up i don't
[2:09:18] want to play anymore i want to serve the
[2:09:20] lord
[2:09:21] at your age why are you worried about
[2:09:23] your salvation at such a young age
[2:09:25] this is the same coach that i had we
[2:09:27] prayed every game
[2:09:28] we did the lord's prayer held hands in
[2:09:30] that moment he said why would you worry
[2:09:32] about salvation at such a young age i
[2:09:34] said if i go tomorrow young don't mean
[2:09:36] nothing
[2:09:37] it's now all you have is now there's no
[2:09:39] tomorrow yesterday's gone present tense
[2:09:42] god is what we serve
[2:09:44] i said lord i'll give it all to you i
[2:09:46] don't know what it is but i'll give it
[2:09:47] all to you but even then there was
[2:09:51] the love i had for the word of god
[2:09:53] beginning then just kept growing and
[2:09:56] growing and growing see the scripture
[2:09:58] says grieve not the holy spirit whereby
[2:10:00] you are sealed until the day of your
[2:10:01] redemption but i would always hear that
[2:10:04] when you get the holy spirit you become
[2:10:05] this perfect person that there's no
[2:10:07] wrong in you you'll never commit a fault
[2:10:09] you'll always be just there won't be
[2:10:11] times where you start to take a step
[2:10:13] back but you wouldn't grieve something
[2:10:15] that makes you perfect
[2:10:17] that's that's that part
[2:10:18] grieving it and it condemning you make
[2:10:21] making you get back to the altar repent
[2:10:23] give it all up again it's a constant
[2:10:25] thing paul said i died daily not one
[2:10:27] time
[2:10:28] that started becoming a reality in me i
[2:10:30] said lord
[2:10:32] what are you doing to me
[2:10:35] then fast forward to now i i watched
[2:10:38] myself
[2:10:39] i sacrificed so much to make sure i was
[2:10:42] at camps to make sure i was at any any
[2:10:46] special event service i made sure i was
[2:10:48] there i can tell you god never
[2:10:50] disappointed so much so this year i have
[2:10:53] class with jordan that same class with
[2:10:55] that same teacher
[2:10:58] she asked that she said well do you
[2:11:00] think she'd let us take the class to
[2:11:01] take the test early i said
[2:11:03] well whether she does or not that's kind
[2:11:04] of doing me i'm not going to be here so
[2:11:09] so she asked she asked her and she says
[2:11:10] no no i can't i can't i said well i'm
[2:11:13] going to be at church you sure you can't
[2:11:15] change it he's like no no i can't i said
[2:11:17] well
[2:11:18] i'm going to see when i get back
[2:11:20] church is more important to me than
[2:11:22] than taking the test
[2:11:24] grant is an important test but i just
[2:11:26] felt there's something more important
[2:11:28] than that
[2:11:29] then that thursday i find out she's sick
[2:11:31] she sends us a text and says well i have
[2:11:32] bronchitis and some other diseases or
[2:11:34] i'll be i won't be in class i said lord
[2:11:36] you work in mysterious ways but thank
[2:11:38] god
[2:11:41] thank god for that
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:44] and then we go to camp we're in the van
[2:11:47] i'm listening to marriage of the lamb
[2:11:49] when i say listening to going beyond the
[2:11:52] camp and then jules is listening to
[2:11:53] another sermon
[2:11:55] and we all stop simultaneously and
[2:11:58] started fellowshipping about how much we
[2:12:01] are not up to par
[2:12:03] with what god requires of us
[2:12:05] there is a space brother brandon says
[2:12:07] it's the worst space for a believer
[2:12:09] where you think you're living right
[2:12:11] you think you're where you're supposed
[2:12:13] to be at and you're far from it
[2:12:15] there i was i was honest with myself and
[2:12:17] then when i said lord i'm nowhere near
[2:12:20] where i'm supposed to be
[2:12:22] he said he gave us back what adam
[2:12:23] forsook but
[2:12:26] i don't i'm not living up to that
[2:12:27] standard
[2:12:29] so what's the what's the issue what's
[2:12:30] the problem
[2:12:31] and i
[2:12:33] i can't i can't explain to you but the
[2:12:36] expectation that i had in that moment
[2:12:38] for what god was going to do at camp
[2:12:41] i can't describe it to you
[2:12:43] we we sat there the first service
[2:12:45] thursday night i left early i didn't eat
[2:12:47] breakfast i missed a lot of meals during
[2:12:49] camp because i wanted to be in church
[2:12:50] early take that time to spend it with
[2:12:52] the lord feed on the word and make sure
[2:12:55] that i got what i came for
[2:12:58] first service that can testify to it
[2:13:00] brother donnie he felt like he stabbed
[2:13:02] each of us
[2:13:04] everything we talked about in that car
[2:13:06] he hit from beginning to end and they
[2:13:09] just kept going and going and going
[2:13:13] now it's just a prayer line night i see
[2:13:16] ariel sitting down
[2:13:18] we are all walking to get into the
[2:13:20] prayer line
[2:13:21] in my heart this is the first time
[2:13:23] saying it to anybody in my heart i said
[2:13:25] lord touch him
[2:13:27] i didn't understand everybody else this
[2:13:29] is the moment people have where you meet
[2:13:32] god
[2:13:33] you can say it's emotion you can call it
[2:13:35] what you want but when you when the
[2:13:37] waters are stirred
[2:13:38] you you can't sit still you're going to
[2:13:40] miss it
[2:13:41] i said lord do something for him
[2:13:44] i i just closed my eyes i
[2:13:46] walked through the prayer line
[2:13:48] and after i got done
[2:13:50] you know everybody you know i just i've
[2:13:52] realized i've grown and understood that
[2:13:55] my nature
[2:13:57] isn't to be one that cries all the time
[2:13:59] or to be so
[2:14:01] i can't explain it but i know when god's
[2:14:03] done something for me i went through the
[2:14:05] prayer line i go to the altar and i'm
[2:14:07] praying
[2:14:08] and as i pray i see daniel
[2:14:11] come next to me and he's bawling like a
[2:14:13] baby like he's crying saying oh god i
[2:14:15] give it all to you
[2:14:18] i know a little bit of what's going on
[2:14:19] in his life
[2:14:21] you're about to go to college the the
[2:14:23] that life of college and everything to
[2:14:26] hear him at that altar praying like that
[2:14:29] i said lord you are working
[2:14:32] put my arms around him started praying
[2:14:33] for him
[2:14:35] i got up i went back to my seat then i
[2:14:37] see ariel walk in that line i said
[2:14:40] hallelujah god's gonna do something
[2:14:41] great for him and i watched god work
[2:14:44] and throughout every single service
[2:14:48] i kid you not it's almost like
[2:14:51] i could tell you verbatim what was said
[2:14:54] everything that was said went down and
[2:14:56] sunk on the inside see
[2:14:59] i've had i have her sister brother david
[2:15:00] quite frequently a lot of questions more
[2:15:03] so
[2:15:03] but one thing brother david always tells
[2:15:05] me he says in the midst of everything
[2:15:08] you can come to somebody and say well i
[2:15:09] can't i saw this person do this this
[2:15:11] person do that but what did he do for
[2:15:12] you
[2:15:13] you got to have something that god does
[2:15:15] for you you can't always be preaching
[2:15:16] somebody else's testimony they want to
[2:15:18] hear what god did for you what's good is
[2:15:20] it to say god is alive but in your life
[2:15:22] it's not seen
[2:15:23] something's wrong
[2:15:24] so then when i said lord
[2:15:27] what have you done for me what is it
[2:15:28] that you've given me and brother ron
[2:15:30] said something
[2:15:31] and it hit me
[2:15:32] he said me in this cancerous body that i
[2:15:35] have
[2:15:36] if i can serve god a hundred percent
[2:15:39] how much more you i said lord
[2:15:43] that's
[2:15:44] he's he's walking and he's death is in
[2:15:46] front of him
[2:15:47] yet he gives everything he has to god
[2:15:51] everything i said lord am i not giving
[2:15:54] it all to you
[2:15:55] i felt so
[2:15:57] unworthy isn't the word but i felt like
[2:16:00] ashamed of the person that i had been
[2:16:02] i'd been running from a calling in my
[2:16:04] life
[2:16:05] that i felt since i was a kid
[2:16:07] i ran and i ran and i ran and i ran and
[2:16:10] sometimes in my mind now i still think
[2:16:12] i'm running but i can't run from it when
[2:16:15] god calls you to do something he will
[2:16:17] show you that's your calling
[2:16:19] i used to think well i i i'm not the
[2:16:21] best person to do this this that and the
[2:16:22] other in the third but then a brother
[2:16:24] told me a quote he said god doesn't call
[2:16:27] the equipped he equips the cult
[2:16:30] wow now i really can't run
[2:16:32] like
[2:16:34] i can but brother david tells me all the
[2:16:35] time so what one of these days you're
[2:16:37] gonna you preach this priest down like
[2:16:39] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:16:40] yeah that's that that's that's cool
[2:16:42] that's cool
[2:16:43] but in that moment i realized
[2:16:46] everybody wants this ministry
[2:16:49] but there's souls that are out there
[2:16:51] and the highways and byways that nobody
[2:16:54] is looking out for
[2:16:56] we i said something to her brother i
[2:16:58] said
[2:16:59] what good does it do for us to have this
[2:17:01] holy spirit and to have this message and
[2:17:03] not share it
[2:17:05] we're selfish you say you're a messed
[2:17:07] believer you say you have the life you
[2:17:08] have the power
[2:17:09] but what good and then brother donna
[2:17:11] reagan speaks about it you have a bottle
[2:17:14] it's not the bottle it's the contents of
[2:17:15] the bottle but what good does the bottle
[2:17:18] do if it's not given to somebody it's a
[2:17:20] constant refilling if somebody's in need
[2:17:21] of water you have a cup full of water
[2:17:23] praise the lord but give it to him
[2:17:25] and we have the living waters of life
[2:17:28] and we keep it to ourselves something's
[2:17:30] wrong
[2:17:31] there's people out there that are in
[2:17:33] need of this and in that moment at camp
[2:17:36] god spoke to me he's always done i went
[2:17:38] to prayer line i said god if you just
[2:17:40] tell me this one statement i'll know
[2:17:42] it's you
[2:17:43] time after time he says it you're called
[2:17:46] i'm like well that's not good enough i
[2:17:47] need something else
[2:17:49] but you're gonna always need something
[2:17:51] else until you step into what it is
[2:17:52] god's called you to do and you do it
[2:17:55] my testimony to you
[2:17:57] god gave me a blessed assurance
[2:18:01] that when he tells me to do something
[2:18:02] and i do it he's right there to put his
[2:18:04] foot right behind to confirm that that's
[2:18:07] what god wants me to be doing
[2:18:09] i watched just how much this youth
[2:18:11] changed in a moment
[2:18:14] in a moment from one way to another
[2:18:17] you want that to keep going keep feeding
[2:18:20] it's an experience it's amazing it's
[2:18:24] you can't even explain it but if you
[2:18:26] don't feed that experience you're going
[2:18:28] to let the devil rob it from you
[2:18:30] that's what we don't want to happen we
[2:18:32] want to keep pressing and pressing
[2:18:33] forward and keep going and going we have
[2:18:35] to see a rapture somehow so we got to
[2:18:37] feed god bless your saints
[2:18:39] [Applause]
[2:18:46] if the pastor lets us we'll just go on
[2:18:48] all night so
[2:18:50] we're
[2:18:50] we're here we're here amen
[2:18:53] hey man well
[2:18:54] our sister's standing so right after her
[2:18:56] testimony we'll have brother gregory
[2:18:58] testify
[2:18:59] go ahead and come on up that way
[2:19:01] everybody can see you sister
[2:19:04] we don't want no one getting any cramps
[2:19:05] in their neck
[2:19:09] god bless you
[2:19:12] god bless y'all
[2:19:14] try not to be long but
[2:19:16] um
[2:19:19] since i was four i was introduced to
[2:19:21] many spirits that had
[2:19:23] that have taken a hold into my life
[2:19:27] and
[2:19:28] it was very hard for me to
[2:19:31] shake it and get rid of it but for the
[2:19:34] most part for most of my life i really
[2:19:36] didn't try to
[2:19:37] i just felt like
[2:19:39] because those spirits came at me at such
[2:19:41] a young age
[2:19:43] i
[2:19:44] i just feel like it grew on to me
[2:19:46] and the way i felt throughout
[2:19:49] the past like 10 years is that
[2:19:51] this is just who i am and
[2:19:54] you know like the devil would speak to
[2:19:55] me in my mind and i would just i would
[2:19:57] hear it as my own voice
[2:19:59] as if i was speaking to myself and i
[2:20:00] would just hear evil things and evil
[2:20:02] whispers and it was just
[2:20:05] i didn't it came to a point where i
[2:20:07] didn't even think it was the devil it
[2:20:08] was just me
[2:20:11] and i suffered for a long time in
[2:20:14] silence and i never had the strength to
[2:20:18] talk to anyone
[2:20:20] and i thank god for my father because
[2:20:23] he
[2:20:24] speaks to us about the word of god every
[2:20:25] single day
[2:20:27] and has always encouraged us to look for
[2:20:29] more and to seek the word of god in the
[2:20:31] kingdom of the lord because
[2:20:33] it will do great things for you and i've
[2:20:34] seen him moving his life and my family's
[2:20:36] life in
[2:20:38] i just didn't think
[2:20:40] i just didn't think i was worthy of
[2:20:42] holding such greatness and such
[2:20:46] like grace and mercy that he has in
[2:20:47] other people's life because since i was
[2:20:50] so young this is all i've known all
[2:20:52] these evil things that have come in
[2:20:54] contact to me
[2:20:55] and i knew how to get i knew that if i
[2:20:57] just prayed or if i just
[2:20:59] went to meetings or went to prayer lines
[2:21:01] would get away but i was never strong
[2:21:03] enough to confess even to myself even to
[2:21:05] the word of god to even to god that this
[2:21:07] is what i'm dealing with that i have
[2:21:09] these spirits taunting me it was just
[2:21:12] i just began to live with it and i would
[2:21:15] go through prayer lines and it would
[2:21:16] just speak it into my heart
[2:21:19] and it came to a point where i just felt
[2:21:21] like well if this is just how i'm living
[2:21:22] then i just might as well stay this way
[2:21:24] like
[2:21:25] you know i just kept wearing you know i
[2:21:26] just kept
[2:21:28] trying my best to act godly and look
[2:21:29] godly because you know rather be safe
[2:21:31] than sorry
[2:21:32] but
[2:21:34] it was just really hard for me
[2:21:37] to open up and talk about these things
[2:21:39] because i just didn't feel like no one
[2:21:40] would understand me
[2:21:42] and once again i just felt like it was
[2:21:44] me like i
[2:21:45] it came it was really bad
[2:21:47] it was really dark bad place and i grew
[2:21:50] up with it
[2:21:52] i didn't know anything else
[2:21:55] and i couldn't speak to anyone because i
[2:21:56] was so ashamed
[2:21:59] of myself
[2:22:01] i just didn't feel worthy
[2:22:05] by any means but
[2:22:09] you know i just kept
[2:22:11] pushing on i guess i just i
[2:22:13] there was times where i would feel like
[2:22:15] god was would speak to me to try to get
[2:22:17] me out of this place but
[2:22:19] i would run away from the word of god i
[2:22:21] would run away from reading my bible
[2:22:22] listening to tapes and all these kinds
[2:22:24] and just trying to feed my heart to get
[2:22:26] out of the place that i was but
[2:22:29] and then there was other times where i
[2:22:30] just felt like he wasn't speaking to me
[2:22:32] and that gave me more
[2:22:34] confidence i guess to stray away and
[2:22:36] just not even try because again i didn't
[2:22:39] feel like i deserved salvation or that i
[2:22:41] deserve grace or anything of that matter
[2:22:45] but
[2:22:45] i just want to say just before i even
[2:22:48] get deeper that if you are suffering in
[2:22:50] silence
[2:22:52] to just speak to someone
[2:22:54] just speak to someone
[2:22:57] because it's not a good place to be no
[2:22:59] matter how small the issue is it's not
[2:23:02] it's not an inconvenience for god
[2:23:05] so
[2:23:06] just find someone to speak to and get it
[2:23:08] off your chest at least because
[2:23:11] i want to let me i went 11 years since i
[2:23:13] was 4 years old and more events and just
[2:23:16] horrible things just kept piling on to
[2:23:18] my trauma and i couldn't
[2:23:21] i just couldn't shake it away
[2:23:24] so this year for camp
[2:23:27] i just i was talking to noel i think it
[2:23:29] was right before we had practice
[2:23:31] that thursday and i just asked her what
[2:23:33] she was expecting and like she said for
[2:23:36] a revelation and reassurance and then i
[2:23:38] told her that i just wanted deliverance
[2:23:40] and i wanted healing and disclosure
[2:23:44] what
[2:23:45] has started my trauma and
[2:23:48] so i can just be delivered completely
[2:23:49] from everything that was traumatizing me
[2:23:51] because i was just so tired
[2:23:54] of living that way and and
[2:23:59] it was just a long time of darkness that
[2:24:01] i just didn't see myself being out of it
[2:24:04] i just didn't i just didn't feel
[2:24:07] like the lord loved me enough to help me
[2:24:11] and
[2:24:12] in my own small ways i've tried to pray
[2:24:14] myself
[2:24:16] out of this life but it was just i just
[2:24:18] did it
[2:24:19] it wasn't working but
[2:24:21] it was
[2:24:22] now that i look back it's the small
[2:24:24] things that even brought me here
[2:24:26] the
[2:24:27] daily devotions with my family
[2:24:30] just friends
[2:24:31] like our youth just speaking to you and
[2:24:35] you know them randomly randomly coming
[2:24:36] up to you and saying i'm praying for you
[2:24:38] and
[2:24:39] stuff like that
[2:24:40] just people reaching out and being kind
[2:24:43] and
[2:24:44] i just thank god for our youth
[2:24:47] and for our pastor of course and just
[2:24:50] anyone who has ever touched me because i
[2:24:52] would i don't think i would have been
[2:24:53] here
[2:24:54] today i don't think i would have and if
[2:24:56] i didn't go to camp i probably would
[2:24:58] have never spoken up to the
[2:25:00] people who were praying
[2:25:02] for me but i just
[2:25:04] um
[2:25:06] so as the
[2:25:08] days went on we were at camp and the
[2:25:10] sermons were speaking to me and i could
[2:25:12] just feel myself
[2:25:13] wanting to just come in contact with god
[2:25:16] even if it was just for a minute or for
[2:25:18] a second i just wanted change in just
[2:25:20] some kind of way and i just knew that
[2:25:22] i just knew that it was mine and i
[2:25:25] couldn't
[2:25:26] and no one could take it away from me
[2:25:28] since i was young my father would tell
[2:25:30] me that
[2:25:33] god gave me to him
[2:25:35] and that no one could ever take me away
[2:25:36] from him so the same way i came from god
[2:25:38] i would go right back
[2:25:40] and i would hold that resource but then
[2:25:42] again i never really felt that that was
[2:25:44] mine to claim because i didn't feel
[2:25:46] worthy so i just kept that into my heart
[2:25:49] throughout the meetings and as i went up
[2:25:52] there for the prayer line
[2:25:54] i was just praying
[2:25:55] and praying and as i was we were walking
[2:25:57] up there i could just feel and i could
[2:25:59] hear the devil just trying to
[2:26:01] come to me and discourage me and tell me
[2:26:03] you know you're not going to get it
[2:26:04] you're just going to walk through and
[2:26:05] it's going to be fine and you're just
[2:26:07] going to
[2:26:08] go back to where that you're living in
[2:26:09] that moment i just told god i just said
[2:26:13] if i
[2:26:14] let me walk through that prayer line
[2:26:17] and feel something
[2:26:18] even if i don't shout or if i don't
[2:26:20] dance let me just feel something that i
[2:26:22] know that you're still with me even if i
[2:26:24] don't if i'm not delivered to not at
[2:26:26] least
[2:26:27] at least i know that you're next to me
[2:26:30] or anything i just wanted to feel
[2:26:31] something of god whether he was little
[2:26:33] or not
[2:26:34] so i was i was walking through the
[2:26:36] prayer line
[2:26:37] i didn't even get to like the
[2:26:39] second
[2:26:40] minister i just broke down out of school
[2:26:42] screaming like get him out of me get him
[2:26:44] out of me get him out of me i just
[2:26:45] couldn't i just i was just i just been
[2:26:48] tired for so long
[2:26:50] of suffering in such darkness and having
[2:26:52] no one to speak to
[2:26:55] and um
[2:26:57] going to the prayer line and they had
[2:26:59] brought me in the back and they were
[2:27:00] praying for me and
[2:27:03] even even in that moment i could just
[2:27:05] feel
[2:27:06] the darkness that was inside of me
[2:27:09] just trying to keep a hold on to me and
[2:27:12] just trying to remind me of my trauma
[2:27:14] and the traumas that i was going through
[2:27:15] just kept playing back there was even
[2:27:17] some that i had just pushed away because
[2:27:19] i had the tendency of going through
[2:27:21] things just pushing it back because i
[2:27:23] just
[2:27:24] there was just no reason to keep
[2:27:26] thinking about them but
[2:27:28] they were praying for me they're telling
[2:27:29] me to speak and confess to what you're
[2:27:31] going through and i was trying and i was
[2:27:33] trying
[2:27:34] to speak and it was just really hard for
[2:27:36] me to get those things out and i
[2:27:38] remember everything vividly um
[2:27:40] i could
[2:27:42] go relive it again but it was just
[2:27:45] i just kept trying to speak it out and
[2:27:46] go through and there was things that i
[2:27:48] had went through that i had again pushed
[2:27:49] back that was starting to come back
[2:27:51] throughout that throughout that moment
[2:27:55] and i just remembered i just remember um
[2:27:57] brother matthew
[2:27:59] telling me to look at him and i
[2:28:01] and again i was struggling once again
[2:28:03] but he got me to look at him and then he
[2:28:05] told me
[2:28:07] he told me to just speak the name of
[2:28:09] jesus
[2:28:11] then just leave it up to god and
[2:28:14] i
[2:28:15] again i was just so tired
[2:28:20] i was just so tired
[2:28:22] and i just i knew that i just couldn't
[2:28:25] go through this type of life i just
[2:28:26] couldn't go through that life again
[2:28:28] and again i had told
[2:28:30] i told god to just let me feel him for a
[2:28:32] little bit so it was already a blessing
[2:28:33] that i was going through that prayer
[2:28:35] with the other ministers in the back but
[2:28:37] it was
[2:28:38] that those that hour in the back was
[2:28:41] such a battle
[2:28:43] itself and he just told me to be the
[2:28:45] name of jesus and i just kept
[2:28:47] we were there for a while we were there
[2:28:49] for a while trying to
[2:28:51] help me out and
[2:28:52] after a couple of minutes of
[2:28:55] struggling with me i
[2:28:57] i just felt all this weight lifted off
[2:29:00] my sweaters
[2:29:01] all of the darkness that the darkness
[2:29:03] that i was in i just saw light
[2:29:05] immediately
[2:29:07] i just want to thank the lord because i
[2:29:09] don't think if i didn't go to camp i
[2:29:10] would have received what i came there
[2:29:12] for
[2:29:14] and i just know that i am destined for
[2:29:16] heaven and i am destined for god
[2:29:25] [Applause]
[2:29:31] yeah so
[2:29:33] if you're sitting or you're suffering in
[2:29:35] darkness find someone you can even speak
[2:29:37] to me
[2:29:39] and
[2:29:41] we'll just we can just get through this
[2:29:42] together because once again the youth
[2:29:44] itself we've grown tremendously through
[2:29:46] the past week
[2:29:48] and if god can move in four days
[2:29:52] you know we don't know how much time we
[2:29:53] have left on this earth we could be a
[2:29:54] year
[2:29:55] or a week but if he can work in four
[2:29:57] days and i promise you he could work in
[2:29:59] a month if he comes in a month
[2:30:01] and even through this service
[2:30:03] just
[2:30:04] keep pressing on and keep pushing on
[2:30:07] and believe in god that he will help you
[2:30:09] and if you feel yourself in that
[2:30:10] darkness just reach out to someone
[2:30:13] and reach out to god read your bible
[2:30:15] listen to sermons do anything everything
[2:30:17] you everything the devil tells you you
[2:30:19] can't do that's right that you shouldn't
[2:30:21] do
[2:30:22] that you should put that put away for
[2:30:24] later
[2:30:25] do it go against him cast him out
[2:30:29] just stand by god because he'll stand
[2:30:31] with you and even if you don't feel like
[2:30:33] he's with you he's with you and he'll
[2:30:35] always be
[2:30:37] i just want to thank
[2:30:39] thank the lord once again for delivering
[2:30:40] me from
[2:30:42] that place that i was in
[2:30:44] and i now know where i'm supposed to be
[2:30:46] yes and i know that the devil can't
[2:30:48] pluck me from amen
[2:30:50] [Applause]
[2:30:56] hallelujah
[2:30:58] oh praise his wonderful name
[2:31:01] hallelujah
[2:31:04] my goodness oh you don't know how
[2:31:06] excited i am to hear that testimony
[2:31:09] our god is real
[2:31:12] oh my i said something that's been
[2:31:13] burning on my heart is is is i would
[2:31:15] encourage you at at some time if you
[2:31:17] can't listen to oneness of unity i
[2:31:20] believe brother branham preaches that in
[2:31:21] 54. and he talks about how he said you
[2:31:25] know the problem the problem of it is
[2:31:27] and he talks about even billy graham he
[2:31:29] says he has a message to get everybody
[2:31:31] delivered or repented he said but the
[2:31:33] problem is he doesn't have a message to
[2:31:34] get people filled up
[2:31:36] and he said the problem is is we're
[2:31:37] getting people repented and cleaned up
[2:31:40] he said but but what it is is you can
[2:31:42] the evangelist might come along and and
[2:31:44] you know cast the spirits off of you and
[2:31:46] get you all cleaned up and everything
[2:31:47] but then that spirit wanders and he
[2:31:49] comes back with seven words he said but
[2:31:51] we but oh i might as well just read it
[2:31:53] won't be long be just just just one
[2:31:54] little quote i had a lot more but but we
[2:31:57] ain't got time for that
[2:31:59] but he says
[2:32:00] he said and i say tonight that a greater
[2:32:03] than solomon is here
[2:32:04] it's the person of christ it's the holy
[2:32:06] ghost performing and working producing
[2:32:09] in the human life just as he did here
[2:32:11] god made you a place that you that could
[2:32:14] be emptied now you can't just polish the
[2:32:16] old life you can't give the old
[2:32:18] life a facelift
[2:32:20] she has got to die
[2:32:22] and a new life be born in her she don't
[2:32:24] need some manicure or what it is you put
[2:32:26] on your lips the woman you know do and
[2:32:29] you know to make her look better she
[2:32:30] don't need a hair curling she don't need
[2:32:32] a lip stuff the church needs a birth and
[2:32:35] a feeling of the holy ghost amen and i i
[2:32:39] i'm just rejoicing to see the work of
[2:32:42] god delivering and and now i say to each
[2:32:44] one of you continue in that and be
[2:32:46] filled with the holy ghost it's for you
[2:32:49] amen is there somebody else that just
[2:32:52] can't sit still
[2:32:54] well you you've been waiting a while
[2:32:56] and then brother gary can't sit still go
[2:32:58] ahead
[2:33:04] try to get did this the best i can
[2:33:05] without crying but um
[2:33:08] so before camp i uh i was so busy with
[2:33:11] school and i couldn't
[2:33:13] go and you know
[2:33:16] they're just
[2:33:17] like the last couple months i felt just
[2:33:19] lukewarm and like
[2:33:22] i just was going i just feel like i was
[2:33:24] going to like the
[2:33:25] motion that church you know just like
[2:33:28] ben said raised my hands because other
[2:33:30] people were and you know i was just
[2:33:34] you know i just felt lukewarm and i
[2:33:36] didn't fall even like when i would pray
[2:33:38] i just felt like
[2:33:39] god was distant and
[2:33:41] um
[2:33:42] before i camp i
[2:33:46] i just
[2:33:47] was like lord you know i have so much on
[2:33:49] my plate and
[2:33:51] you know i
[2:33:54] i don't know if i'll
[2:33:55] be able to make it and so like it was i
[2:33:58] think
[2:34:00] the
[2:34:01] week before
[2:34:02] i um
[2:34:04] i just
[2:34:06] you know
[2:34:08] i just
[2:34:09] i resolved in my heart to go
[2:34:12] and
[2:34:14] that first night um
[2:34:17] i didn't quite enter in until probably
[2:34:19] friday
[2:34:20] uh friday the first service
[2:34:23] there were so many things that stood out
[2:34:25] to me brother andrew
[2:34:27] probably the
[2:34:28] three things he said one was i think
[2:34:31] when there's two sides fighting for you
[2:34:34] god and satan then that must mean that
[2:34:36] you're
[2:34:38] worth something and then
[2:34:40] the other one was there must be
[2:34:42] something about you getting up whenever
[2:34:45] satan tries to
[2:34:47] bring you down so much and that really
[2:34:49] you know
[2:34:50] stood out to me because
[2:34:52] you know these past couple months i um
[2:34:54] he's been really
[2:34:56] trying to
[2:34:57] pull at my heart you know
[2:34:59] saying you know this isn't for you you
[2:35:01] know you don't have the holy ghost and
[2:35:03] i um
[2:35:06] i was really struggling this past couple
[2:35:08] months
[2:35:08] even up to camp night the first night i
[2:35:11] uh
[2:35:12] i was just like
[2:35:14] lord you know why am i here like i'm not
[2:35:17] i didn't really come expecting anything
[2:35:20] um
[2:35:21] the first night
[2:35:24] and
[2:35:24] then whenever the weekend came and they
[2:35:29] brother um ron spoke you know he every
[2:35:32] time i
[2:35:33] every time i get
[2:35:34] to watch him preach you know i get so
[2:35:37] emotional because like that man's
[2:35:39] fighting like
[2:35:41] so much and i i just
[2:35:46] it's always sitting there you know just
[2:35:49] listening to him preach and um
[2:35:53] and then whenever the
[2:35:55] purl line
[2:35:57] came
[2:35:59] i uh they were like all right we're
[2:36:01] going to start the pro line right now
[2:36:02] and i was like one of the first ones
[2:36:04] there and
[2:36:05] i was like all right lord like i don't
[2:36:08] like past you know
[2:36:10] i would go through and all i would get
[2:36:12] was like maybe a
[2:36:14] cry you know bawl my eyes out and then
[2:36:16] like brother donny i think this past
[2:36:18] fall he preached going back home
[2:36:20] so like i would get the victory and then
[2:36:22] money came like it was like satan just
[2:36:24] like gave you like a sucker punch in the
[2:36:26] face and was like you thought you had
[2:36:28] something
[2:36:31] so i was like
[2:36:32] all right lord like i mean
[2:36:34] i don't want this to be like any other
[2:36:36] you know
[2:36:37] weekend
[2:36:38] i want to get something and so
[2:36:40] i went through there
[2:36:42] and i um
[2:36:43] [Music]
[2:36:45] i was just like lord i hand
[2:36:47] all my problems to you everything that i
[2:36:50] you know struggle with i hadn't put all
[2:36:52] in your hands and i
[2:36:54] you know i had all these
[2:36:56] people in my heart brother christian and
[2:36:59] everyone else they've been on my heart
[2:37:01] for a long time and i was like lord you
[2:37:02] know i need you to do something and
[2:37:06] i uh
[2:37:08] i went through and like
[2:37:12] i
[2:37:14] i got through like maybe
[2:37:16] five people and i um
[2:37:26] i felt something
[2:37:34] probably never felt
[2:37:37] in my life
[2:37:44] i just like immediately like
[2:37:47] got numb and like
[2:37:49] my legs and my
[2:37:50] arms and everything and
[2:37:53] um
[2:37:55] i probably stood
[2:37:57] about
[2:37:58] i don't know
[2:38:00] 45 minutes to an hour in the chair just
[2:38:02] like
[2:38:03] restless and
[2:38:05] i could still hear people like praying
[2:38:07] and stuff i just
[2:38:08] couldn't move and i couldn't um
[2:38:11] i was just like
[2:38:13] just super still
[2:38:15] and then
[2:38:17] brother chris you know
[2:38:19] he came up to me and he was like are you
[2:38:21] okay dude and i just was like
[2:38:24] staring at him like i couldn't even talk
[2:38:26] i was so out of it
[2:38:29] and i uh
[2:38:32] i
[2:38:33] i was like lord you know
[2:38:37] i really
[2:38:38] i really feel like
[2:38:40] he touched me that night and
[2:38:42] i um
[2:38:44] like
[2:38:45] i don't know like i felt
[2:38:47] a joy like come over me like never
[2:38:49] before at peace
[2:38:51] and you know
[2:38:53] by the way it's my mom's 40th birthday
[2:38:56] and
[2:38:57] i just want to
[2:38:59] i just want to
[2:39:01] say that you know she prays for us
[2:39:05] a lot
[2:39:23] she's asked for
[2:39:40] because um
[2:39:41] even the night whenever
[2:39:43] i got back you know the song came in my
[2:39:46] heart
[2:39:48] when god ran
[2:39:50] by i don't know if you've heard it um
[2:39:53] i just like kept playing over and over
[2:39:54] my head and
[2:39:57] i uh
[2:39:58] i really think that he
[2:40:01] ran to me that night
[2:40:03] and the prayer line
[2:40:10] and so you know i just want to
[2:40:12] um
[2:40:13] encourage
[2:40:14] kelly and
[2:40:16] everyone else that
[2:40:18] it doesn't matter how far they stray and
[2:40:21] um
[2:40:22] god will
[2:40:26] bring them back
[2:40:28] because um
[2:40:30] you know i dealt with so much
[2:40:32] stuff in my past and
[2:40:34] i uh even this past couple months you
[2:40:37] know i was
[2:40:38] battling a lot and like i said i would
[2:40:40] just
[2:40:41] lukewarm and people would come up to me
[2:40:43] like you know what happened to you like
[2:40:45] you used to be
[2:40:47] all like into service and
[2:40:50] um clapping and praising god and you
[2:40:52] just look like
[2:40:55] a different person and
[2:40:57] they weren't talking about the good and
[2:40:58] i was like
[2:41:00] okay well
[2:41:01] i mean and i would just go on and then
[2:41:04] um
[2:41:06] i uh
[2:41:09] but
[2:41:12] going to camp like i
[2:41:15] i knew i needed the
[2:41:17] holy ghost and
[2:41:19] i was just like lord you know
[2:41:24] i would ask for stuff and then
[2:41:27] you know
[2:41:28] i felt good in the presence of god but
[2:41:30] then once
[2:41:32] i would go back home and then it's like
[2:41:34] the devil just
[2:41:35] attacked me and
[2:41:37] i um
[2:41:39] you know i
[2:41:40] struggle with
[2:41:42] you know
[2:41:43] so many things in my past and
[2:41:47] i just didn't get rid of those things
[2:41:50] and i uh
[2:41:53] i was just like lord you know
[2:41:57] i need this to be a different
[2:41:58] circumstance i need you to touch me
[2:42:01] forever
[2:42:02] and so
[2:42:05] um
[2:42:08] i
[2:42:12] i just you know went
[2:42:13] through there that night and then
[2:42:16] brother
[2:42:17] ron
[2:42:18] uh
[2:42:19] preached and he's made a comment i think
[2:42:22] ben
[2:42:23] already said something about how you
[2:42:25] know if i can
[2:42:26] do what i'm doing whenever i'm fighting
[2:42:28] um how much more you and that really you
[2:42:31] know encouraging me
[2:42:33] um because i know i'm not fighting as
[2:42:36] hard as he's fighting but yet you know
[2:42:40] it doesn't matter you know
[2:42:44] what we're going through god always
[2:42:47] hears the cries of
[2:42:48] those that are praying for you and
[2:42:52] you know it doesn't matter how far they
[2:42:53] stray god will
[2:42:55] god will pull them to himself
[2:43:00] even the
[2:43:01] fact that i'm here today i um
[2:43:04] i wouldn't get really nervous to
[2:43:07] even like talk to people and everything
[2:43:09] and
[2:43:12] i um
[2:43:14] i was like lord you know
[2:43:16] i wouldn't even really be
[2:43:18] like
[2:43:19] talk to people or like want to see them
[2:43:21] or like even be their friend and stuff
[2:43:23] which i mean i guess people that know me
[2:43:26] think that i'm pretty friendly but i
[2:43:28] felt like you in these past couple
[2:43:30] months like i've been so like
[2:43:32] you know just to all to myself and alone
[2:43:35] and everything and then i saw christian
[2:43:36] you know these past couple months and i
[2:43:38] was like
[2:43:39] man i don't know what's going on with
[2:43:41] that dude but
[2:43:46] oh my
[2:43:48] god he received something at that camp
[2:43:50] and i was like
[2:43:52] i need to step up my game or something
[2:43:56] because if he
[2:43:58] if he came back praising in church and

[2:45:15] crying and praying that god do something
[2:45:17] for them
[2:45:19] and so like as soon as he came out i
[2:45:21] just started
[2:45:22] praising god for

[2:45:32] i just you know thank god for
[2:45:35] what he's doing in our youth and michael
[2:45:38] and
[2:45:39] you know i felt like you know after camp
[2:45:41] i was talking to him in the parking lot
[2:45:44] sunday night and we just got to talk and
[2:45:45] i was like
[2:45:46] you know even god touching him you know
[2:45:48] that's even
[2:45:51] a miracle in itself
[2:45:53] um
[2:45:54] because you know
[2:45:58] i just thank god for
[2:46:01] each one that he's touched and i know
[2:46:03] that those that are out there you know
[2:46:06] it don't matter how far they go you know
[2:46:08] they can
[2:46:09] they can run as far as they want to but
[2:46:11] you know god will get them
[2:46:13] some way or another and
[2:46:16] it doesn't matter
[2:46:18] and i'll testify that it doesn't matter
[2:46:21] you know
[2:46:22] i'm praying for each one that you know
[2:46:25] they'll come back and they will come
[2:46:26] back
[2:46:27] because god has his seed out there that
[2:46:29] he
[2:46:31] that he knows which
[2:46:33] who those are
[2:46:35] and you know i
[2:46:39] i just think um
[2:46:42] thank them for you know
[2:46:46] even when god you know
[2:46:49] even though i didn't come expecting much
[2:46:50] at camp you know
[2:46:52] i um
[2:46:54] i came out receiving you know
[2:46:57] a lot more than i even expected going to
[2:46:59] camp
[2:47:01] i didn't
[2:47:02] like i said i didn't really expect
[2:47:04] much at camp
[2:47:06] [Music]
[2:47:08] but
[2:47:09] i know that god
[2:47:11] you know came by my way and
[2:47:14] came to my seat
[2:47:17] and i know that he
[2:47:18] filled me with his spirit and
[2:47:21] thank y'all
[2:47:30] i feel 18 years old
[2:47:35] you know
[2:47:37] sister louise's testimony i that that
[2:47:40] moved me
[2:47:42] and it moved me because
[2:47:46] that was a true definition of salvation
[2:47:52] that's what that's what it's like
[2:47:55] to be saved
[2:47:58] the darkness goes away
[2:48:01] the
[2:48:02] burdens lifted off
[2:48:05] and now you feel a part
[2:48:08] of something
[2:48:10] and it's so wonderful
[2:48:13] and you know i don't want to stop the
[2:48:15] testimony service because
[2:48:18] a christian's testimony never stops
[2:48:24] sunday night we preached a little sermon
[2:48:26] and
[2:48:28] the campers were in here but
[2:48:31] we called it the second part of easter
[2:48:35] and
[2:48:38] it's so important that you testify
[2:48:41] it's so important
[2:48:43] because
[2:48:44] it's not
[2:48:46] clenched
[2:48:48] until you testify
[2:48:50] you know what i mean it's not sealed
[2:48:53] into your own self
[2:48:56] until you finally
[2:48:59] can speak it
[2:49:01] and know you're speaking it for yourself
[2:49:04] nobody can take that from you
[2:49:07] you know and and and i want to say
[2:49:10] what
[2:49:11] we're experiencing here
[2:49:14] is
[2:49:16] not us
[2:49:18] it's him
[2:49:20] it's him working
[2:49:22] and the most beautiful part about it is
[2:49:25] is this is an intellect
[2:49:29] you know
[2:49:31] everybody knows about jesus
[2:49:33] everybody reads the bible
[2:49:36] but when you hear
[2:49:38] people
[2:49:39] come up
[2:49:40] and say i was in dark places
[2:49:44] and god delivered me from a dark place
[2:49:47] i had a mental battle and now i see
[2:49:50] clear
[2:49:51] there's stuff going on in my life that
[2:49:53] tells me he's alive
[2:49:56] and
[2:49:59] even when jesus rose
[2:50:02] on easter
[2:50:05] he said the reason i suffered in rose
[2:50:08] that you
[2:50:10] could go to the world
[2:50:13] and preach repentance of sin and
[2:50:15] deliverance
[2:50:16] beginning at jerusalem
[2:50:19] and
[2:50:20] my heart's thrilled about that don't
[2:50:23] stop
[2:50:24] it's the only way to keep your fire
[2:50:27] alive is tell somebody
[2:50:29] if it means so much to you
[2:50:31] tell somebody and i appreciate it so
[2:50:34] much our sister
[2:50:36] expressing that
[2:50:38] share that i'll tell you another thing
[2:50:39] that really
[2:50:41] moved me
[2:50:43] is
[2:50:45] how each person in the body talked about
[2:50:48] somebody else in the body
[2:50:51] that touched them or said something to
[2:50:53] them
[2:50:55] and we're a body
[2:50:57] fitted and joined together
[2:50:59] every part supplying the need
[2:51:02] to the other
[2:51:04] you know it it it's it's not a one-man
[2:51:07] show
[2:51:08] it's not a preacher show it's
[2:51:11] him
[2:51:12] showing us
[2:51:14] through us
[2:51:15] how much he loves us
[2:51:17] and we just want to keep that i know i'm
[2:51:20] not going to close the testimony service
[2:51:22] i'm just gary i think wants to say
[2:51:24] something back there and
[2:51:26] and
[2:51:32] i'll tell you what we'll do we'll sing a
[2:51:34] song
[2:51:34] and anybody that has to go
[2:51:37] can slip out
[2:51:39] and then anybody else that wants to stay
[2:51:41] and testify can stay and testify
[2:51:44] i might even give my testimony
[2:51:48] starting at the beginning
[2:51:54] come on
[2:52:00] i'll try to be quick but
[2:52:03] you know it just seemed like he just
[2:52:04] done so much i'm so happy
[2:52:08] you know
[2:52:09] i'll just start by reading the scripture
[2:52:11] real quick
[2:52:12] it's in
[2:52:14] matthew chapter 18
[2:52:16] verse 10.
[2:52:24] it says take heed that ye despise not
[2:52:26] one of these little ones for i say unto
[2:52:29] you that in heaven their angels
[2:52:31] do always behold the face of the father
[2:52:33] which is in heaven
[2:52:35] for the son of man has come to save that
[2:52:37] which was lost
[2:52:38] how think he if a man have a hundred
[2:52:40] sheep and one of them be gone astray
[2:52:44] does he not leave the 99 and go with
[2:52:47] into the mountains and seek that which
[2:52:49] has gone astray
[2:52:51] and if it
[2:52:52] so be that he findeth it verily i say
[2:52:55] unto you he rejoices
[2:52:56] rejoiceth more
[2:52:58] of that sheep than of the 99 which
[2:53:01] went not astray
[2:53:03] even so
[2:53:05] it is not the will of your father
[2:53:08] which is in heaven that one of these
[2:53:10] little ones should perish
[2:53:14] you know
[2:53:15] sister jordan just said something uh
[2:53:18] earlier that was
[2:53:20] just really spoke to me there in the
[2:53:21] back when
[2:53:22] when she said you know
[2:53:24] you know he wants to use us in his way
[2:53:28] and um
[2:53:31] you know the whole reason that i
[2:53:33] i had wanted to go to camp
[2:53:35] um
[2:53:37] for the youth was for you guys
[2:53:40] you know i signed up to be a counselor
[2:53:42] and
[2:53:43] you know
[2:53:45] to stay
[2:53:46] you know on the camp with the with the
[2:53:49] youth and
[2:53:50] you know in the trenches and
[2:53:52] you know
[2:53:54] i've spent
[2:53:56] you know quietly many hours with some of
[2:53:59] these
[2:53:59] young men up here
[2:54:01] some that are even not here as maybe
[2:54:04] kelly could testify of
[2:54:08] you know because i love him
[2:54:17] you know when
[2:54:20] you know as a couple weeks back even
[2:54:24] had gone over to sister kelly's house
[2:54:26] and brother troy's to
[2:54:29] you know speak to levi and
[2:54:31] you know we
[2:54:34] talk on and off
[2:54:36] and um there was a situation where
[2:54:39] we hadn't talked in maybe eight months
[2:54:41] or so and i just went by
[2:54:46] i went by to see him you know and um
[2:54:50] i brought him a gift just to break the
[2:54:52] ice
[2:54:53] and uh told him you know i'd
[2:54:56] gotten him a little something because
[2:54:58] you know he had
[2:55:00] they were like some discs i don't know
[2:55:02] if anyone has ever played disc golf or
[2:55:04] anything like that but
[2:55:06] he had had some discs and he'd come over
[2:55:07] to my house and
[2:55:09] he'd left them and my kids were playing
[2:55:12] with them and threw them over in the
[2:55:13] neighbor's yard and the dogs ate them up
[2:55:15] so
[2:55:18] so just to break the ice had been on my
[2:55:19] heart to to do that for him and so
[2:55:23] you know i went by and seen him and
[2:55:27] you know he he even made the comment you
[2:55:29] know it
[2:55:32] you know i thought if it if it meant
[2:55:33] enough to you you'd do something like
[2:55:35] this
[2:55:37] and so
[2:55:39] you know
[2:55:40] we were just talking and really i'd
[2:55:43] you know let let him do most of the
[2:55:45] talking
[2:55:47] and
[2:55:49] you know when it got down to the end i
[2:55:51] just said you know what
[2:55:54] in the past several years i've seen a
[2:55:56] lot of people go i've lost a lot of
[2:55:58] friends
[2:56:00] but i don't want to lose anymore
[2:56:04] and i really felt like it spoke to him
[2:56:06] we hugged it out he unblocked me off his
[2:56:08] phone and
[2:56:11] you know
[2:56:13] but you know i just
[2:56:16] you know i just
[2:56:18] humbled myself to go and apologize to
[2:56:20] him
[2:56:24] you know because i loved him
[2:56:26] and so you know we went to the camp this
[2:56:29] year and
[2:56:30] you know i never didn't even know if we
[2:56:32] would have the opportunity to go back
[2:56:34] after what happened in 2020 you know and
[2:56:37] so to be back on the grounds was a lot
[2:56:39] of nostalgia you know and to
[2:56:43] be with my
[2:56:44] the youth and
[2:56:46] with everything that happened with
[2:56:48] christian michael and
[2:56:51] at pawnee i didn't get to be a part of
[2:56:52] that situation you know there there were
[2:56:54] times when i took the youth to pawnee
[2:56:56] and
[2:56:58] you know
[2:57:00] but um
[2:57:10] there was kind of a
[2:57:12] i always i only say this because
[2:57:15] i want the youth to know that something
[2:57:17] happened for me too
[2:57:19] you know we
[2:57:21] you guys think maybe we don't have mind
[2:57:23] battles or we don't go through things
[2:57:25] but we might battle just as
[2:57:27] just as hard as you guys
[2:57:29] even though i do believe that you guys
[2:57:31] have a tougher road than us
[2:57:34] but
[2:57:34] um
[2:57:36] so you know i'm
[2:57:38] being a deacon in the church and
[2:57:40] you know been already here ten years now
[2:57:42] and
[2:57:44] um i was just mind battling during the
[2:57:46] week
[2:57:47] of camp or being even at the camp that
[2:57:49] you know that
[2:57:52] satan's just telling me you don't have
[2:57:54] the holy ghost
[2:57:55] you're a deacon but you don't have the
[2:57:57] holy ghost
[2:57:58] and you don't you don't have no fruits
[2:58:02] you don't there's nothing special about
[2:58:04] you
[2:58:07] so
[2:58:08] you know
[2:58:10] it was all the way to saturday morning
[2:58:12] now and
[2:58:13] there was kind of a situation or i'll
[2:58:15] call it an opportunity
[2:58:18] after service where a couple brothers
[2:58:19] were witnessing to a brother and
[2:58:23] i was just standing there quietly
[2:58:25] a lot of times i do you know
[2:58:29] you know maybe afraid to speak you know
[2:58:32] a lot of times you
[2:58:34] you know you wonder if it's patience or
[2:58:36] if it's
[2:58:37] laziness
[2:58:40] and so
[2:58:42] we were standing there and i was
[2:58:43] listening to the brothers speak to him
[2:58:44] and i just thought
[2:58:48] everything they're saying is right on
[2:58:50] point
[2:58:51] everything they're saying is
[2:58:53] things that work i've seen it work so it
[2:58:56] wasn't anything anyone was saying
[2:59:00] but he
[2:59:02] it just
[2:59:04] rose up anger he just got upset about it
[2:59:08] and
[2:59:10] i don't know something in me
[2:59:13] just hurt for him
[2:59:16] i can't explain it
[2:59:18] and so as he walked away
[2:59:22] i just followed him and i went we went
[2:59:25] behind the
[2:59:26] u-haul and
[2:59:29] i didn't say anything great
[2:59:31] you know i didn't say anything
[2:59:34] out of the ordinary
[2:59:36] really i just listened
[2:59:41] i said what's what's wrong what's going
[2:59:42] on you know
[2:59:46] why are you so mad
[2:59:50] and he began to tell me things and i
[2:59:52] just listened i just let him talk i just
[2:59:54] you know i just tried to show him love
[2:59:56] when i didn't have you know when you
[2:59:58] don't i don't know him you don't have to
[3:00:01] you know because that was done for me
[3:00:04] you know i had somebody call me when i
[3:00:06] was a young brother sitting in the
[3:00:07] single brothers section
[3:00:09] and i hadn't come to church for a little
[3:00:10] while and he called me and i'm like
[3:00:14] why do you care
[3:00:18] and so
[3:00:21] i just began to speak to him and he went
[3:00:23] and he began to soften and
[3:00:25] [Music]
[3:00:26] we began to cry in each other's arms and
[3:00:29] not even really knowing this brother to
[3:00:31] be honest with you
[3:00:34] but just because i loved him
[3:00:38] and so
[3:00:40] you know
[3:00:41] as it went on
[3:00:42] i just said hey i'm going to get
[3:00:43] something to eat you want to go with me
[3:00:45] and we went to the
[3:00:47] you know we went back and sat down and
[3:00:49] ate and
[3:00:52] you know fellowshipped and you know the
[3:00:54] brothers that we were talking with could
[3:00:55] see that this counting has changed and
[3:00:59] and from that moment on
[3:01:01] that lying devil spirit that was telling
[3:01:04] me that i didn't have the holy ghost and
[3:01:06] that
[3:01:07] that
[3:01:09] left
[3:01:10] and i had a peace like never before that
[3:01:12] i haven't had in three or
[3:01:14] four or five years
[3:01:16] and
[3:01:18] you know i just felt like it was
[3:01:21] i proved that i had the holy ghost
[3:01:24] because of love and you know
[3:01:27] many many can
[3:01:29] i don't know how many um
[3:01:31] of you know how much time i've spent
[3:01:33] with your children especially the
[3:01:35] brothers
[3:01:39] you know i mean like grace was saying
[3:01:41] israel spent time with israel israel
[3:01:43] worked with me a little bit last summer
[3:01:45] and
[3:01:46] we got really close and
[3:01:49] you know i've witnessed to him and
[3:01:53] not that he needed witnessing to but
[3:01:56] i just spent time with him i love him
[3:01:57] you know and then
[3:01:59] even um
[3:02:03] you know sister pineal i've never really
[3:02:06] spoke much to her but she came up to me
[3:02:09] i think maybe the wednesday night before
[3:02:11] church and was just asking me if i ever
[3:02:12] talked to her boys or she had noticed
[3:02:14] that i'd talked to her boys
[3:02:16] and i didn't say anything grand i just
[3:02:18] said you know sister i'm working on it
[3:02:25] because i love gershwin
[3:02:28] and i see him go through the prayer line
[3:02:31] and i've seen him make steps i've seen
[3:02:32] him make a move
[3:02:36] we just keep him in prayer knowing that
[3:02:38] god started the work he'll finish it
[3:02:43] and um
[3:02:47] you know i told the brothers
[3:02:50] you know i'm always available
[3:02:53] because i feel like that's the greatest
[3:02:54] thing that you know brother jackson
[3:02:57] instilled in me was
[3:03:00] best abilities availability and so you
[3:03:02] know i just told these boys that
[3:03:05] i'm always available you can always get
[3:03:07] a hold of me
[3:03:08] you know i'll say 24 7 365.
[3:03:12] but
[3:03:14] i'm just i just want to tell the youth
[3:03:16] that you know you're an inspiration to
[3:03:18] us
[3:03:19] and and you guys being on fire
[3:03:22] you know
[3:03:23] i made a move at
[3:03:25] camp and it did something for me and
[3:03:26] then oh my goodness when we came back to
[3:03:28] evening service and brother david was
[3:03:30] preaching on
[3:03:32] you know what he was said he was
[3:03:33] preaching on and then
[3:03:35] you know we just came into service and
[3:03:37] start began to worship and man the songs
[3:03:40] that billy was just selecting just one
[3:03:43] after another was speaking to me and
[3:03:45] man the presence was so thick and i just
[3:03:48] began to rejoice and then
[3:03:51] the spirit fell on my wife and then you
[3:03:54] know she didn't even go to camp
[3:04:01] [Applause]
[3:04:10] i just know that god's so mindful every
[3:04:13] little intricate details of our life and
[3:04:16] you know
[3:04:19] it may seem small but
[3:04:21] brother jackson called me yesterday and
[3:04:23] he's asked me hey how's your going you
[3:04:25] know everyone's just so excited on fire
[3:04:27] and
[3:04:28] i said well you know what
[3:04:31] tommy had dropped me off we were working
[3:04:33] together a little bit and he dropped me
[3:04:35] off and
[3:04:38] you know
[3:04:39] i had a situation last fall with my
[3:04:41] neighbor where
[3:04:43] i had um
[3:04:44] i was mowing and i mowed over his
[3:04:47] water holes and like the metal part i'd
[3:04:50] cut it
[3:04:52] and i never said anything about it i
[3:04:54] never
[3:04:55] you know i never
[3:04:58] i just reasoned it out i just said
[3:05:02] when spring comes i'll get him a water
[3:05:03] hose i'll put a note on his door
[3:05:09] and so when we got to the
[3:05:11] we pulled up to the house yesterday
[3:05:15] he was out
[3:05:16] just fertilizing his yard and i
[3:05:19] started to walk in the house and
[3:05:20] something
[3:05:21] was like you said you're going to make
[3:05:23] that right
[3:05:26] and so
[3:05:27] i said well you know it is spring and
[3:05:30] the way up
[3:05:33] the way i've been feeling this week
[3:05:36] how could i not so
[3:05:38] i just went over there and said hey
[3:05:41] you know i always loved brother
[3:05:43] branham's approach i've just talked to
[3:05:44] him about the weather
[3:05:48] but uh no i just said
[3:05:50] you know
[3:05:52] what what you what you're putting out
[3:05:54] and he said fertilizer i said okay i
[3:05:56] said well hey look
[3:05:57] i think i owe you a water hose
[3:06:00] and uh
[3:06:02] he was like
[3:06:03] i said uh i think last fall maybe one of
[3:06:05] the last times i mowed i i hit your
[3:06:07] water hose
[3:06:08] and he said oh i wonder what had
[3:06:10] happened
[3:06:13] and uh
[3:06:15] he said oh you don't you don't got to do
[3:06:17] that
[3:06:17] i said no i want to and then
[3:06:20] you know we just began to fellowship and
[3:06:22] talk and
[3:06:23] it felt like we talked
[3:06:25] 40 minutes or so but um
[3:06:28] man it was just another burden lifted
[3:06:30] off just another
[3:06:32] just
[3:06:33] doing what he asked me to do even in the
[3:06:35] very small things
[3:06:37] but you'll like i said it wasn't
[3:06:39] anything i did because i reasoned it out
[3:06:43] and just the way
[3:06:44] god had moved in my life this weekend i
[3:06:46] was like there's no way i cannot do it
[3:06:48] and so
[3:06:49] i just wanted to
