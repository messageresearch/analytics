[5:51] amen good
[5:53] morning and Merry Christmas our our our
[5:58] Christmas uh service and time for our
[6:01] young people to uh be with us and and uh
[6:07] have a little program for us and there's
[6:10] no way to measure the amount of work
[6:14] that has gone into this and the effort
[6:18] it takes and uh you'll see by just the
[6:23] size of the of the group of the young
[6:26] people to get them to work together and
[6:28] coordinate and be with one another and
[6:31] tolerate one another why I think that's
[6:35] absolutely wonderful and so we're just
[6:38] going to enjoy what they have for us and
[6:41] we know that uh uh our scripture tells
[6:45] us in Isaiah 9 and6 that unto us a child
[6:50] was born and and he was a mighty God he
[6:54] was a counselor he is a prince of peace
[6:57] he's an everlasting father and we just
[7:00] have this day to celebrate that time of
[7:03] that birth and and I just trust this
[7:06] will be a wonderful blessing to you and
[7:09] and I I just uh I enjoy watching the
[7:13] kids and the talent that they have uh
[7:17] you know it's just it's hard to believe
[7:20] that such beautiful kids grow up to be
[7:22] people like
[7:23] us but uh um you know take care of them
[7:29] and love them you know and this is our
[7:32] greatest commodity is our children uh we
[7:36] want to raise them in the ways of the
[7:38] lord we want to prepare them for the
[7:41] future and as the God has it as each one
[7:46] of us is lives our time on Earth and our
[7:48] taking off the scene these are the
[7:50] people that keep the word of God living
[7:53] and pass on the good things of God to
[7:56] others so let's open with prayer this
[7:59] morning
[7:59] our gracious father we ask you to bless
[8:02] our children we ask you to bless the
[8:04] people father may we enjoy this day and
[8:08] The Fellowship of the word and father we

[8:21] time we invite your presence father and
[8:25] your anointing into this place and may
[8:28] the Simplicity of this
[8:30] time touch the hearts of each one of us

[1:12:45] give everybody in the church a little
[1:12:47] gift and uh uh so we we try to give a

[1:13:05] two or three brothers living in the same
[1:13:07] apartment one calendar it's not calendar
[1:13:11] per person is calendar for household if
[1:13:15] you live in a tent One calendar per tent
[1:13:19] if you live in a trailer One calendar
[1:13:22] per trailer if you live under the bridge
[1:13:25] One calendar for under the bridge so I I
[1:13:29] hope that uh uh uh we don't care where

[1:13:35] please take that gift uh from us and we
[1:13:40] we really appreciate that so uh we're
[1:13:43] just going to have a little message on
[1:13:45] my heart and uh uh uh if and so let us
[1:13:51] stand and we'll turn in our Bibles to uh
[1:13:56] St
[1:14:05] John oh okay uh yeah we wanted to uh
[1:14:09] share something with you this morning uh
[1:14:12] you have that picture can you put it up
[1:14:14] as you know uh brother Matthew and
[1:14:17] brother Darien have been in India uh
[1:14:21] preaching and it started out uh they
[1:14:24] started doing Zoom meetings uh over
[1:14:28] there with a few Brothers uh these are
[1:14:31] all Pentecostal preachers and it
[1:14:34] continued to grow until where they
[1:14:36] almost had 200 people uh zooming in and
[1:14:40] talking so they put together a little
[1:14:43] convention and had a a a several day
[1:14:47] service with these
[1:14:50] uh uh about 200 uh Pentecostal ministers
[1:14:55] and this is a
[1:14:56] picture of some of the 29 brothers that
[1:15:00] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:15:02] Jesus Christ so
[1:15:09] uh and uh so uh they'll be starting
[1:15:12] their travels back home and I'm sure
[1:15:15] there's been many doors open there and
[1:15:17] and a work that the brothers have
[1:15:20] started that they'll continue to help
[1:15:22] these brothers grow and answer their
[1:15:25] questions and and prove that uh what
[1:15:30] what we serve is a living God with a
[1:15:34] word-based message so uh I just think
[1:15:37] that's one I know Matthew got a little
[1:15:39] food poisoning while he was over there
[1:15:41] and and we continue to trust that the
[1:15:44] Lord strengthens him so uh you know
[1:15:48] you're all a part of
[1:15:49] that you know so it it takes a body it
[1:15:53] takes a family and and and so uh each
[1:15:57] one of you will have a little a piece of
[1:16:00] that in your crown so let's turn to St
[1:16:03] John the 3r chapter in the 14th 15th
[1:16:08] 16th 17th
[1:16:12] verse probably the most memorized
[1:16:16] scripture in the
[1:16:18] Bible it says and as Moses lifted up the
[1:16:22] serpent in the wilderness
[1:16:25] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:16:31] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:16:35] not perish but have eternal
[1:16:39] life for God so loved the world that he
[1:16:45] gave his only begotten son that
[1:16:48] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:16:52] perish but have everlasting ing life for
[1:16:57] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:17:01] condemn the world but that the world
[1:17:05] through him might be saved Heavenly
[1:17:09] Father we ask you to bless in your
[1:17:12] precious name we pray amen amen you may
[1:17:15] be
[1:17:21] seated I like uh
[1:17:26] uh
[1:17:28] having services with a theme you know I
[1:17:32] like preaching at Christmas and
[1:17:34] Thanksgiving and Easter and and things
[1:17:38] like that and so uh it's just nice to
[1:17:41] have a time uh to preach about something
[1:17:44] so I have a a a little uh uh thought uh
[1:17:49] it's it's it might start out depressing
[1:17:53] but just hold hold on there and and with
[1:17:56] it a little bit and I I hope it'll bless
[1:18:00] you uh brother Miguel nice to see you
[1:18:03] Paris brother many years been my friend
[1:18:08] come over and with us I guess this is
[1:18:10] the first time in our new building right
[1:18:13] amen so anyways be we had to make it
[1:18:16] bigger because you're singing bless so
[1:18:19] many people they just had to come so we
[1:18:22] appreciate it so very much
[1:18:25] you know at Christmas time A lot of
[1:18:28] times you know the emphasis is on gifts
[1:18:32] and and uh trying to find the perfect
[1:18:36] gift you know and uh so I I told in our
[1:18:41] family I said I I'll buy this but no no
[1:18:44] clothes I don't want no clothes this
[1:18:46] year you know so and uh I'll guarantee
[1:18:51] I'll get
[1:18:52] socks and but you know it it just after
[1:18:56] a
[1:18:57] while you just try to think of what is
[1:19:00] it really that you want or what do you
[1:19:03] need or where are you going to put it
[1:19:07] you know what I mean I don't uh I I'm
[1:19:11] every time I walk into my closet I
[1:19:13] realize this thing's got to be remodeled
[1:19:16] you know and I can't blame it all un
[1:19:19] Lesly she looked at me the other day and
[1:19:21] she Saidi never seen a man in the world
[1:19:23] with so many shoes
[1:19:25] well I don't throw my shoeses away I
[1:19:27] just pile them up and uh they're wore
[1:19:31] out they're beat up you know and what's
[1:19:34] ever the closest to slip into I slip
[1:19:37] into them and uh uh you know if one
[1:19:40] pairs full of mud I just put the
[1:19:42] different pair on and uh so you know you
[1:19:47] you always you just get to the place
[1:19:49] where I don't need anything but but you
[1:19:53] know God so loved us that he gave us a
[1:19:57] gift and so I'd like to preach a a
[1:20:02] sermon
[1:20:04] to um this morning and the title of it
[1:20:08] is a gift for every
[1:20:11] weakness a gift for every
[1:20:14] weakness and we uh we're born in in this
[1:20:22] world and uh we know the scriptures
[1:20:25] tells us that we're born in sin shaped
[1:20:29] into iniquity come into the world
[1:20:33] speaking
[1:20:35] lies and uh but yet our opinion of
[1:20:39] ourselves is pretty
[1:20:41] high uh if you were to ask yourself to
[1:20:45] write a
[1:20:46] resume of yourself uh you would
[1:20:50] immediately go into all the character
[1:20:54] istics of
[1:20:56] yourself that you uh thought were
[1:21:00] important if you go to do a job
[1:21:04] interview you give a resounding review
[1:21:07] of yourself and your abilities I can do
[1:21:11] this I can do that I'm I'm good I'm this
[1:21:15] but you know man has done a lot of
[1:21:18] studies and found out that Human Nature
[1:21:22] has lots of weaknesses
[1:21:25] now we know that we have characteristics
[1:21:28] of human beings that uh one is that we
[1:21:32] seek shelter and we she seek
[1:21:36] companionship and we want to uh uh we
[1:21:39] want to advance and we want to make life
[1:21:44] easier on
[1:21:45] ourselves and and these are are great uh
[1:21:50] characteristics we want to
[1:21:52] multiply uh those those are things that
[1:21:56] are common to human beings no matter
[1:22:00] where they are in the world uh they they
[1:22:04] there certain characteristics that they
[1:22:06] they list in the characteristics the
[1:22:10] anatomy of human beings the physical
[1:22:13] characteristics of how our limbs work
[1:22:15] and how we walk upright and then our
[1:22:19] social
[1:22:21] characteristics how that we're communal
[1:22:24] uh people and uh we strive to work
[1:22:29] together but we learn uh that's another
[1:22:33] characteristics and we learn and so
[1:22:35] those are characteristics but along with
[1:22:39] our humanism we we got a
[1:22:44] nature and our our our human nature
[1:22:48] though it has many great
[1:22:52] positive uh characteristics
[1:22:55] many good incentives and good
[1:22:59] intentions our our nature itself is kind
[1:23:04] of has some flaws in it and a lot of
[1:23:08] times we think of gifts when we talk
[1:23:12] about gifts or we think of abilities you
[1:23:15] know what I mean this person's gifted
[1:23:18] and so we think of their abilities or we
[1:23:21] think of tools you know what I mean
[1:23:23] something that will help us do something
[1:23:27] but I wanted to call call this a
[1:23:32] gift for every
[1:23:34] weakness and uh so you know we we find
[1:23:39] out even though we
[1:23:42] we we seem to do good within ourselves
[1:23:47] we have
[1:23:48] weaknesses and our weaknesses hurt
[1:23:52] us and our enemies
[1:23:55] seek to take advantage of our weakness
[1:24:00] that's what you does even our messenger
[1:24:02] told us when you're you're in a battle
[1:24:05] or you're in a fight you look for that
[1:24:07] weakness and he said every one of us has
[1:24:10] weaknesses and the enemy's got a a
[1:24:13] something coming against us uh uh but he
[1:24:18] said uh uh you know we've got to cover
[1:24:22] that weakness and so we we think in our
[1:24:26] nature and we think of our our thing and
[1:24:30] and even though we kind of look at gifts
[1:24:34] uh things but I thought and we know that
[1:24:37] the greatest gift that was given to us
[1:24:41] was the love of God God so loved the
[1:24:43] world he gave us his only begotten son
[1:24:48] and it and this gift is a gift for
[1:24:52] everything and so just to go over a
[1:24:56] little bit I want to talk a little bit
[1:24:59] this morning
[1:25:01] about our
[1:25:03] weakness and not just one weakness they
[1:25:06] have over they've listed over 50 or 60
[1:25:12] weaknesses in the human being and I want
[1:25:16] to say this morning that we have a gift
[1:25:19] for every
[1:25:21] weakness for every weakness and I'll
[1:25:24] just start listing uh going through the
[1:25:28] list and I'm sure none of this applies
[1:25:31] to any of you here so we're certainly
[1:25:34] talking about all those sinner Devils
[1:25:37] out out there right but we're we're in
[1:25:39] here we're all Angels right and and
[1:25:45] uh we we really have need of nothing
[1:25:50] right I
[1:25:51] mean uh you know the fact that it says
[1:25:54] we're blind miserable naked wretched and
[1:25:57] have need of nothing that certainly
[1:26:00] doesn't mean
[1:26:02] me which is one of our
[1:26:05] weaknesses let's just talk about our
[1:26:08] weaknesses and as you do this I I want
[1:26:11] you to think of what's on my heart this
[1:26:13] morning a gift for every
[1:26:20] weakness okay every Avenue that that
[1:26:24] Satan can get to you
[1:26:28] everything about
[1:26:31] yourself that hurts
[1:26:36] you everything about yourself the
[1:26:40] weaknesses that you have that hurt
[1:26:44] you that keep you from going
[1:26:47] forward that keep you from so many
[1:26:52] things and Rob us
[1:26:55] of so much life and
[1:26:58] joy and I'll just go through some of
[1:27:01] these lists that that different authors
[1:27:05] and have have have listed
[1:27:11] and each one of them has a different
[1:27:14] thing but I think they're all
[1:27:17] great it says this person here puts the
[1:27:20] first list on man's weakness
[1:27:25] is
[1:27:28] being
[1:27:32] cowardliness you know to be
[1:27:34] cowardly you know he says it's it's a
[1:27:38] weakness you know uh where you you are
[1:27:43] gripped by fear and a failure to want to
[1:27:49] Prevail or or stand up or or have any
[1:27:55] toughness you know sometimes we call it
[1:27:58] it being spineless or having no backbone
[1:28:03] or having no
[1:28:05] conviction you you you know what I mean
[1:28:07] not wanting to uh to just uh face it up
[1:28:13] that that that's a weakness that we have
[1:28:17] is human beings were our nature the
[1:28:20] nature that we received
[1:28:24] when we were born and came into this
[1:28:27] world in the very nature that we possess
[1:28:32] has within us a weakness of being coward
[1:28:36] cowardly and and that's why when someone
[1:28:40] goes and has Valor it it's it it's such
[1:28:44] stands out that it it's recognized
[1:28:48] because they overcame a weakness now
[1:28:52] it's given to us to be
[1:28:57] Overcomers and and that's our portion
[1:29:02] and and we need help
[1:29:05] overcoming another uh weakness that man
[1:29:09] has is uh uh is
[1:29:14] selfishness you know uh that great
[1:29:19] uh thing about you know I guess it
[1:29:22] starts real early with children you'll
[1:29:25] have a room full of toys and one child
[1:29:28] will be playing with one toy and some
[1:29:31] you'll be across the whole other room
[1:29:33] playing with a different twin that kid
[1:29:35] will get up and run across the room and
[1:29:37] say that's
[1:29:40] mine to be
[1:29:42] selfish you know to make sure that
[1:29:45] you've got what you need you know what I
[1:29:48] mean uh the lack of ability to share to
[1:29:53] be selfish that's built in our nature we
[1:29:57] we we we get that we didn't ask for it
[1:30:01] uh you know I didn't ask to be born I
[1:30:03] didn't make an arrangement with my
[1:30:05] parents and said I'd like to be born on
[1:30:08] October
[1:30:09] 27th
[1:30:11] 1949 and uh I I would like to you know
[1:30:15] I'd like to have nice head of hair all
[1:30:18] my life no I I picked up the natural
[1:30:22] characteristics of my parents
[1:30:24] be through their genes and and I picked
[1:30:27] up the human
[1:30:29] nature that comes with being a human
[1:30:31] being and in picking up those Natures I
[1:30:35] pick up these
[1:30:37] weaknesses and these
[1:30:39] weaknesses have hurt me
[1:30:43] personally over the
[1:30:46] years and and so it it selfishness is
[1:30:51] one of the weakness you know
[1:30:55] apathy you know built in our
[1:30:58] characteristics uh you know to reject or
[1:31:01] or or or disapprove or have
[1:31:06] contempt of
[1:31:08] others you know it's a it's a human
[1:31:10] nature apathy it is one of the human
[1:31:14] Natures that we have I I thought this
[1:31:17] one was put on the list and I thought
[1:31:20] why you know this should have been
[1:31:23] number number
[1:31:25] one lack of
[1:31:33] concentration to pay attention you know
[1:31:36] what I mean to gather up the
[1:31:39] details you know you know just to take
[1:31:42] the time when someone tells you your
[1:31:44] name just to take the concentration to
[1:31:47] catch it now you know that's my weakness
[1:31:51] and and I have a real good excuse for it
[1:31:53] but I want to say this morning that
[1:31:55] there's a gift for every
[1:31:59] weakness and and and so you know just
[1:32:04] the uh you know to uh and and the thing
[1:32:09] who happens is these things hurt us and
[1:32:12] we use them for
[1:32:14] excuses and and you know and that's why
[1:32:17] when the great message was preach
[1:32:19] perfect strength and perfect weakness we
[1:32:22] start using our weak weaknesses as
[1:32:25] excuses and there's no need for them to
[1:32:28] be excuses because we have a gift for
[1:32:31] every
[1:32:32] weakness and and so you know a distrust
[1:32:36] is another great weakness that our
[1:32:40] Nature has just in our nature our nature
[1:32:43] distrust
[1:32:45] impatience I know none of you suffer any
[1:32:48] of these
[1:32:50] Envy you know resentment
[1:32:55] these are just some of the things that
[1:32:58] uh are are listed
[1:33:02] dependency you you know where where uh
[1:33:06] we we don't want to fear for ourselves
[1:33:08] we want to depend on others and and we
[1:33:12] uh uh and a lot of times that weaknesses
[1:33:16] causes for
[1:33:18] disappointment you know people will let
[1:33:21] you
[1:33:22] down you know uh i i attended I've
[1:33:27] attended several uh uh AAA meetings and
[1:33:32] not because I was an alcoholic but I had
[1:33:35] loved ones and encouraging them to go
[1:33:38] you know a lot of people they don't like
[1:33:41] uh uh oh they'll they'll have an opinion
[1:33:44] or an attitude towards something that
[1:33:47] helps people if someone's somebody's
[1:33:49] going to help somebody to overcome
[1:33:51] alcoholism I'm all for it
[1:33:55] you understand it don't take God out of
[1:33:57] their life I encourage every person to
[1:34:00] do all that you can to overcome but also
[1:34:05] I want you to understand that there's a
[1:34:07] gift for every
[1:34:09] weakness and and I believe Matthew
[1:34:11] brought that out so well last time he
[1:34:13] preached when with alcoholism the first
[1:34:16] thing they want to convince you is once
[1:34:19] an alcoholic always an alcoholic if
[1:34:22] you're an alcoholic you will always be
[1:34:24] an alcoholic well that's because that's
[1:34:26] a weakness but we've got a gift for
[1:34:29] every weakness amen amen and then this
[1:34:34] person list on his list at number 10 is
[1:34:41] stubbornness is one of the
[1:34:44] biggest human
[1:34:46] weaknesses that there is just being
[1:34:48] stubborn and uh you know uh
[1:34:54] that is
[1:34:55] uh I don't know if
[1:34:58] stubbornness has hurt any of you but
[1:35:00] it's hurt me a lot of
[1:35:03] time you know especially in in work you
[1:35:07] know you want to do something certain
[1:35:08] way and you're going to fight it and
[1:35:10] you're going to force it and you're
[1:35:12] going to make it work even though it
[1:35:14] wasn't designed to work you will
[1:35:17] reinvent it you will take it apart
[1:35:20] you'll refix it you'll get it to where
[1:35:23] it work because you're just that
[1:35:28] stubborn and and stubborn's a weakness
[1:35:31] in in our nature well even his children
[1:35:34] will pucker that lip up and you know
[1:35:38] know and uh I I saw a couple grandkids
[1:35:43] giv some grandparents the fits the other
[1:35:46] day and and the kid wanted the most
[1:35:49] ridiculous thing you know what I mean
[1:35:52] and and I thought in my heart I thought
[1:35:54] you know what there's a gift for that
[1:35:57] kind of stubbornness and it's wrapped
[1:35:59] around my
[1:36:06] waist there is a gift for every
[1:36:11] weakness and chastisement sometimes a
[1:36:15] great
[1:36:15] thing and those are some of the ones
[1:36:19] that are common to us but there's other
[1:36:24] sometimes within ourselves is hidden
[1:36:29] weaknesses that are are hard to be
[1:36:32] identified and I thought some of these
[1:36:34] were were Were
[1:36:36] Striking and and I I hope that you
[1:36:40] understand that my emphasis isn't on the
[1:36:43] weakness the emphasis is on the fact
[1:36:46] that we have a gift for every one of
[1:36:50] those weaknesses
[1:36:54] what God's given
[1:36:56] us no matter what came with our
[1:37:01] nature this gift that God has given us
[1:37:05] can is is for every weakness you've
[1:37:11] God and but I thought this was a a a
[1:37:15] great
[1:37:18] weakness
[1:37:22] fantasy you you know giant thoughts and
[1:37:25] little
[1:37:28] actions you know living in a dream world
[1:37:32] you know a fantasy I I've worked with
[1:37:35] lots of guys that I I'll tell you their
[1:37:37] work ethic was a fantasy cuz at the end
[1:37:40] of the day they ain't done
[1:37:43] nothing you know what I mean but they
[1:37:45] think they're moving the
[1:37:47] Earth you you understand it's a weakness
[1:37:50] it's not to be able to perceive the
[1:37:54] reality around you to be living in a fog
[1:37:58] to to uh imagine things that that are
[1:38:02] are there imagination becomes a weakness
[1:38:07] uh uh to men
[1:38:09] uh you know I I I went through a
[1:38:12] terrible time in my life where I just
[1:38:14] thought everybody was thinking about me
[1:38:16] you know what I mean everybody was out
[1:38:19] to get me and it was a big a great big
[1:38:22] gigantic conspiracy the only people I
[1:38:25] believe that's true with is the City of
[1:38:28] Bedford other than that uh uh it you
[1:38:33] just it it it is just something that
[1:38:36] that you you go through it it's a
[1:38:39] weakness that you
[1:38:41] have and there can you imagine there's a
[1:38:44] gift for
[1:38:46] that when you find your mind spinning
[1:38:50] off into things God's got a gift for
[1:38:53] that
[1:38:54] it's beautiful
[1:38:56] negativity you know withdrawal from
[1:39:00] reality and
[1:39:03] avoidance you're letting that
[1:39:05] negativity create in you that you'll
[1:39:09] avoid certain people you'll avoid
[1:39:12] certain things you'll avoid certain
[1:39:14] tasks you just get overwhelmed with
[1:39:18] negativity and you know one of the
[1:39:20] things our our messenger even taught us
[1:39:23] he said never never never never never
[1:39:27] never have a negative
[1:39:29] thought
[1:39:31] negativity is a
[1:39:34] weakness that it it hurts
[1:39:39] you and and just think these weaknesses
[1:39:42] that no wonder he said the day that you
[1:39:45] eat thereof is the day you die not not
[1:39:48] only did the good qualities but the the
[1:39:52] fact that man Adam walked out he was
[1:39:55] positive every morning the sun rose if
[1:39:58] he wanted to move the sun two degrees he
[1:40:01] moved the sun two degrees he named the
[1:40:04] animals he did the you think there was
[1:40:06] negativity in his life no he didn't even
[1:40:09] know what negativity
[1:40:11] was but when that when his nature
[1:40:16] changed then these things begin to come
[1:40:20] up these weaknesses be begin to arrive
[1:40:25] in in our
[1:40:27] nature and we were born with
[1:40:32] them not we didn't have a CH choice to
[1:40:36] pick our
[1:40:37] characteristics and we didn't have a
[1:40:39] choice to pick the
[1:40:41] negativities and the
[1:40:43] weaknesses that come with our
[1:40:46] natures and and
[1:40:48] negativity is is uh
[1:40:54] uh uh one of the great things
[1:41:02] conceit the the definition that he puts
[1:41:05] here I thought was pretty thing he says
[1:41:08] conceit the self-expansion of the
[1:41:21] ignorant you know when you you you you
[1:41:25] think of that you know another one a
[1:41:31] weakness being
[1:41:36] sloppy nobody's sloppy
[1:41:40] right you know uh making hasty decisions
[1:41:45] without proper consider
[1:41:49] consideration leading to regrets and
[1:41:52] sometimes
[1:41:54] irreversible
[1:41:55] consequences sloppiness becomes a root
[1:41:59] cause of my setbacks in
[1:42:04] life being
[1:42:07] sloppy you know not giving due
[1:42:11] diligence not you know making decisions
[1:42:15] sloppy
[1:42:16] decisions you know and and th th th th
[1:42:22] that
[1:42:23] thing we think of sloppiness is well you
[1:42:27] know you don't tie your shoe you don't
[1:42:29] you know you don't tuck in your shirt
[1:42:31] that's sure that's
[1:42:33] exactly amounts to all of it because if
[1:42:37] you have a sloppy appearance and someone
[1:42:40] you know sees those things then it
[1:42:43] creates an
[1:42:45] atmosphere around you and it's hurting
[1:42:50] you it it it it shows there's no
[1:42:54] consideration you know one time I was
[1:42:57] late and like my I I told my dad I'm
[1:42:59] sorry I'm late he says oh it's just
[1:43:01] because you're
[1:43:05] selfish I thought what do you mean yeah
[1:43:07] he says that's just sloppy
[1:43:10] living you know and I I I I didn't you
[1:43:15] know and then I come to to learn he was
[1:43:17] counting on me being
[1:43:20] there I I didn't make a decision
[1:43:24] you know what I mean because I thought I
[1:43:27] could be sloppy because it's my dad but
[1:43:30] because it was my dad I should have been
[1:43:33] even more
[1:43:37] diligent but these
[1:43:40] weaknesses and the thing about it is if
[1:43:43] there's a
[1:43:45] gift for that
[1:43:48] weakness
[1:43:51] then when wouldn't it be
[1:43:54] wise for our own
[1:43:58] self-interest to make contact with that
[1:44:02] gift and to let that gift work if if you
[1:44:06] have a tool you you know have you ever
[1:44:10] had a bolt that you you took a pair of
[1:44:13] channellocks to until it was totally
[1:44:15] rounded off and all you would have to
[1:44:18] done is went and got the end wrench that
[1:44:21] fited no what stubbornness sets in and
[1:44:25] self-will sets in and and conceit sets
[1:44:28] in and ego sets in and and you're going
[1:44:32] to get that thing off and if it won't
[1:44:34] come off you'll just go get a a
[1:44:36] reciprocator saw a
[1:44:41] sawsa and it's just because it's
[1:44:46] sloppy sloppiness is a real problem of a
[1:44:49] church
[1:44:53] they don't care about the
[1:44:56] time they don't care about anybody
[1:44:59] else and you think well who does it hurt
[1:45:02] it hurts
[1:45:04] you it hurts you it hurts your
[1:45:10] testimony let me ask you if if there was
[1:45:13] an appointed time for the
[1:45:16] Rapture 10 a.m. next Sunday morning the
[1:45:21] Rapture would take place how many of you
[1:45:23] wander on in here about
[1:45:30] 10:30 you wouldn't do
[1:45:34] it you wouldn't do
[1:45:38] it I mean you're not late to
[1:45:41] work and let me tell you what work does
[1:45:44] for you it makes you tired it makes you
[1:45:48] sore and it makes you
[1:45:51] old and you'll be on time for that
[1:45:58] Pronto but something that gives you
[1:46:03] life see we don't we we don't understand
[1:46:07] that if if there wasn't a gift for every
[1:46:12] weakness then we would have an
[1:46:18] excuse you understand but now here's a
[1:46:20] gift that God has given for every human
[1:46:24] weakness that we've got we didn't ask
[1:46:27] for the weakness but but yet he gave us
[1:46:31] the gift
[1:46:34] anyway he so loved us see I want you to
[1:46:38] look at the gift different not a gift of
[1:46:41] something that's future oh salvation one
[1:46:44] day I'll be saved no that's not what the
[1:46:47] gift is the gift is a gift for every
[1:46:50] weakness that you have this morning
[1:46:54] warning it's for your
[1:46:56] weaknesses it's not for your strength
[1:46:59] it's the sick that need the
[1:47:04] physician spiritually sick personality
[1:47:08] sick nature

[1:47:16] disregard for any of the reality living
[1:47:19] in fantasy sloppy living

[1:55:51] Reckoning
[1:55:54] oh I don't have to pay this yeah me and
[1:55:57] Les say when we first got married we we
[1:55:59] we bought a refrigerator from
[1:56:02] Sears well we just figured it out we
[1:56:05] would have paid that refrigerator off
[1:56:07] about now because they would let you
[1:56:09] give you a129 a
[1:56:12] month 25 years and you pay that
[1:56:15] refrigerator
[1:56:17] off and that refrigerator cost you1
[1:56:20] 14,000
[1:56:24] but it was just
[1:56:27] a129 and you can afford
[1:56:31] that that's
[1:56:34] extravagance living outside your
[1:56:37] means it's a
[1:56:41] weakness and the scripture says that to
[1:56:44] be content in whatever state you're in
[1:56:48] don't let credit
[1:56:52] take you out of the state that you're
[1:56:55] in don't spend what you don't have
[1:57:00] you're hurting
[1:57:02] yourself and that's going to cause you
[1:57:05] to make
[1:57:07] decisions that aren't good
[1:57:11] decisions I told you this might get a
[1:57:13] little depressing but praise God there's
[1:57:17] a gift for it
[1:57:22] he's got a
[1:57:24] gift to take that burden of extravagance
[1:57:28] away from you that burden of I got to
[1:57:30] have I've got to have I want this I want
[1:57:33] that I need this you don't need nothing
[1:57:36] we know what we all need we need to pray
[1:57:38] and read our
[1:57:40] Bible and pray for
[1:57:43] Revelation he's got a
[1:57:46] gift for every one of these weaknesses
[1:57:49] I'm just hold on I'll get to yours

[1:58:13] here
[1:58:16] jealousy
[1:58:19] stubbornness this one is kind they it
[1:58:22] it's light promises and little
[1:58:27] faith in other words making promises
[1:58:31] lightly and lack of
[1:58:34] commitment to fulfill
[1:58:37] them you want to know the number

[2:00:00] you're paranoid about your future you're
[2:00:02] paranoid about your existence you want

[2:00:10] fragile human being that really no
[2:00:14] longer is able to really reflect Jesus
[2:00:19] Christ in his fullness
[2:00:22] but the gift of God is if you could
[2:00:25] believe that he's a gift for every
[2:00:29] weakness he will make you to become the
[2:00:32] Sons and Daughters of God and then
[2:00:35] you'll say to this mountain be
[2:00:41] moved you know we don't need to make
[2:00:43] light

[2:03:16] everything that we have need of
[2:03:29] vanity Love of
[2:03:32] Money
[2:03:40] impulsive one of
[2:03:42] my
[2:03:44] greatest
[2:03:49] characteristics quick to judge
[2:03:52] quick to
[2:03:54] speak quick to get caught off by
[2:04:00] something just
[2:04:02] impulsive goes back to
[2:04:04] sloppiness it goes back to these things
[2:04:07] there's a gift for
[2:04:10] impulsiveness there's a gift you know
[2:04:12] for those that can't walk by the you
[2:04:15] know you know why they put all those
[2:04:16] little candies and those candy bars and
[2:04:19] all them stupid little stuff around the
[2:04:22] register Tinker Toys and it don't matter
[2:04:26] what it is because people have

[2:04:57] I I tried to say is this is the time
[2:05:00] that there's a
[2:05:01] transformation going on in The Believer

[2:05:07] puzzle of human weaknesses and of human
[2:05:11] nature and of what Society does you know
[2:05:14] what with they've got for all these
[2:05:16] weaknesses they've got
[2:05:18] psychologist and they've got

[2:06:12] name was I thought what is a real guy I
[2:06:15] couldn't stand one of his
[2:06:20] songs you know it's a human
[2:06:25] weakness blind obedience glowing with
[2:06:27] the crowd glowing with the trend not not
[2:06:32] going back and thinking it over there's
[2:06:36] a gift for
[2:06:38] that that hurts
[2:06:41] you what other people think hurts you
[2:06:45] not being able to go forward and and and
[2:06:49] and being paranoid
[2:06:52] and and all these things these are
[2:06:54] things that hurt you do you understand
[2:06:55] that and if it's hurting you the
[2:06:58] scripture says it hurts the whole body
[2:07:02] because when one member of the body
[2:07:03] suffers the whole body suffers
[2:07:07] together and it's given to
[2:07:09] us you get a bad attitude you know what
[2:07:12] the scripture says A little leaven
[2:07:14] leavens the whole
[2:07:18] lump you come in and sit down on the
[2:07:20] preacher and and get all huffed up don't
[2:07:23] think that he don't know it don't think
[2:07:25] that he don't see it if he's anointed he
[2:07:27] sees it he can call it
[2:07:29] out but you want God to deal with the
[2:07:34] heart you want God to bring the
[2:07:38] conviction you know we don't measure
[2:07:41] skirts because we want the Holy Spirit
[2:07:43] to convict you we don't measure how
[2:07:46] tight they are we preach against tight
[2:07:49] skirts we preach pre against high heels
[2:07:53] we preach against makeup we preach
[2:07:56] against jewelry we preach against
[2:07:59] cutting your hair but we don't have a
[2:08:01] rule for
[2:08:03] it why because we want the spirit of
[2:08:06] God if you're caught up with glamour if
[2:08:09] you're caught up with publicity you're
[2:08:11] caught up with how you you look it's
[2:08:14] more important what people think of you
[2:08:16] let me tell you there is a gift for that
[2:08:19] weakness this morning there's a gift for
[2:08:22] every weakness that we have as human
[2:08:25] beings there's a Divine gift for it
[2:08:29] hallelujah thank you for
[2:08:36] Christmas I thought this was an amazing
[2:08:39] self
[2:08:41] elimination killing your
[2:08:43] subconscious
[2:08:48] abilities people eliminate themselves
[2:08:54] you know that little voice that talks to
[2:08:57] you on the
[2:08:59] inside the one that puts you under
[2:09:02] conviction the one that says you know
[2:09:04] better or you should do this people
[2:09:08] eliminate
[2:09:11] that they don't want their conscience
[2:09:14] talking to them you know the scripture
[2:09:16] says you turn your back on God he snares
[2:09:20] your conscience with a hot iron don't
[2:09:24] eliminate that in your
[2:09:30] life it's not it's not bad to argue with
[2:09:39] yourself but people are self-eliminating
[2:09:44] themselves
[2:09:45] complexes
[2:09:47] negativity all these things we list this
[2:09:50] whole list of weakness as we're going
[2:09:52] through you understand they're limiting
[2:09:55] you they're they're they're
[2:09:59] dissolving what that you really are why
[2:10:01] do you think Satan wanted to inject his
[2:10:06] nature into your
[2:10:09] lives cuz that's the only way that you
[2:10:13] can
[2:10:14] get he could get to you because he's the
[2:10:17] father of lies and there's no truth in
[2:10:21] in
[2:10:22] him and every one of these weaknesses is
[2:10:26] a lie of the
[2:10:31] devil they are not what Sons and
[2:10:34] Daughters of God possess
[2:10:39] amen and that's why he
[2:10:44] came I'm only I number
[2:10:48] 24 and I don't want to look in them here
[2:10:52] I want to look right over
[2:10:54] here from whence my help comes from to
[2:10:59] where my victory is over every weakness
[2:11:03] where my victory is over every fear and
[2:11:07] every doubt and every
[2:11:10] LIE there's a gift I thought this was
[2:11:16] strange they call it
[2:11:19] fluke you know when people say well
[2:11:22] that's a
[2:11:23] fluke it's the Indulgence of self
[2:11:29] deception deceiving
[2:11:33] yourself can you imagine that's one of
[2:11:35] our human
[2:11:41] weaknesses you know just I mean you
[2:11:44] think about it you know you you you you
[2:11:47] you you you eliminate your conscience
[2:11:52] and and then you indulge in
[2:11:58] self-deception you know and then what
[2:12:00] follows stuff like that is is uh
[2:12:05] retaliation that's a human weakness to
[2:12:09] think that you got to retaliate for
[2:12:11] everything everything's got to be tit
[2:12:14] fortat that's what Jesus said it was
[2:12:17] said before I say you an eye for an eye
[2:12:19] and a tooth for a tooth
[2:12:21] he says I I say unto you do unto others
[2:12:25] because you'd have them do unto you
[2:12:28] serve god with your whole heart your
[2:12:30] whole mind your whole strength and love
[2:12:33] your neighbor as
[2:12:38] yourself the beauty of the
[2:12:41] Gospel the understanding of the gift

[2:39:51] just appreciated that message wishing
[2:39:54] everybody has a happy
[2:39:57] holiday let's just go before the Lord
[2:40:00] together gracious Heavenly Father
[2:40:02] there's such a reflection on
[2:40:06] what the gift was and Bethlehem and Lord
[2:40:11] a child
[2:40:12] that was born
[2:40:14] and angels to Shepherds proclaiming unto
[2:40:18] you
[2:40:20] father what a glorious mystery that the
[2:40:22] very blood cell the very deity that a
[2:40:25] child could be fitting to receive
[2:40:27] worship Lord and in that mystery we find
[2:40:30] ourselves father that in this
[2:40:33] flesh Lord where there would seemingly
[2:40:35] be such a weakness such a
[2:40:38] helplessness that the very deity of God
[2:40:40] the very Holy
[2:40:42] Spirit could come and dwell in Us by
[2:40:44] that which was made possible at Calvary
[2:40:47] Lord that's why our hearts sink oh how
[2:40:49] we love you father Lord to see that
[2:40:52] you've desired and sought us and Lord
[2:40:55] you've done it all for us the greatest
[2:40:57] gift we didn't do anything to earn it we
[2:40:59] didn't do anything to deserve it but you
[2:41:01] freely gave it to us oh God and you paid
[2:41:04] the price Lord that's what we desire to
[2:41:07] do is show that love forth Lord and the
[2:41:09] actions that we take to others and the
[2:41:11] giving and the Lord the love that shed
[2:41:14] abroad in our hearts that you've shown
[2:41:16] us may it be a true Revelation that's
[2:41:18] lived out father till we meet again be
[2:41:21] with each one Lord those that maybe feel
[2:41:23] forgotten father we ask your Holy Spirit
[2:41:25] would go to them encourage each Heart
[2:41:28] Lord every weakness oh God that that the
[2:41:31] Satan would try to accuse he's the
[2:41:34] accuser father we're looking to Calvary
[2:41:36] now and claiming your righteousness
[2:41:38] claiming your love claiming your
[2:41:40] forgiveness father that you've dressed
[2:41:42] Us in Lord we thank you for that what a
[2:41:45] glorious thing that you've done father
[2:41:46] we love you Lord we're committing every
[2:41:49] everything into your hands and be with
[2:41:50] each one that goes and father may you
