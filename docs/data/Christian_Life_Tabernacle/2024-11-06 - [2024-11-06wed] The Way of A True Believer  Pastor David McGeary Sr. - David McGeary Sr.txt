Description:
The Way of A True Believer
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
November 6, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

and single our hearts and our minds focused on your word we ask you to bless us tonight in this time of Fellowship a time of prayer and preparation for this weekend we just ask you father to be Mighty in our behalf in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen man if you have your Bibles tonight just for a few moments and and uh we're going to uh you know M maybe uh see what we can do to get ready for the meetings I I don't know uh how busy but if anybody has any time tomorrow to come help us uh we certainly could use a lot of help we have some Lumber that needs to be cut up and stacked and Boards moved and and sidewalks swept and and everything to uh to get ready for our guest and uh that's what we're going to have we hope we have guests but we're looking for the most important guest amen so uh and good it it looks good seeing you back there brother Tim being a grandpa I like I like that look amen amen so let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Amos and um we just I want to make a couple comments and um and trust that the Lord will uh be our portion so instead of uh when we read this in instead of uh putting maybe uh Israel there maybe you could put your name there there or put the bride's name there or put the seventh Church age there but listen to what that is spoken hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion war in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he had taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no Jin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and hath not Nothing At All Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people be Not Afraid shall there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it surely the Lord will do nothing but he reveal his secrets unto his servants the prophets Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated he said the lion hath Ro who will not fear the lord God hath spoken and who can be um prophesy you know I went through uh a experience in a way I guess I might say um and it it struck me and uh a lot of times I believe in my personal life that the Lord allows me to uh maybe go down a certain way and uh I I don't quite understand it and then and then things will transpire and things will be sad there or I'll I'll see things and get in this situation and and then it uh it it strikes me and I I will think well you know what am I doing or where's this in the word or or what's transpiring you know what's going on within my own self and I found this in this uh this great uh event that our country's uh just been through this election and and everybody says this is a surprise and that's a surprise but we're talking here and we read out of Amos and we we we talked about Amos last Sunday and when we preached about the way of a true prophet and and uh so let let's put it back in another line of thinking if I could say that instead of the way of a true Prophet the way of a True Believer okay so a way is uh we we say that maybe a person is uh how do you get to a certain place what's the way uh the path that you take you know the way that you go from this spot to that spot and and or you you say you might ask somebody well how did you get there which way did you come you know you're 20 minutes late which way did you come oh you took you took oh you went that way uh that that way don't work you know there's construction that way and and and uh the traffic's backed up that way or somebody say well which way are you going to go to church well I'm going to go all the way down mid CI because they got all the bridges closed so a way is a decision that's made to get from one spot to another okay so uh so when we talk about the way of a true Christian we talk about what path is he taking to get to where he's going and where we're going I hope is we're going for a kingdom okay that's what we're living for uh uh Christianity is is something that is so wonderfully beneficial in itself that when I got converted and the Lord came in my life and I I was under terrible paranoia I I was suffering paranoia very bad that something bad would happen to me the police were going to come get me uh you know I I you know if I I saw certain Vehicles go down the road or certain sounds I would think I would go hide in the closet like like that's going to help me I was going into my closet for the wrong reason you know uh and so uh I was in a condition and uh and and and suffering now so when we talk about the the way of a Christian so the people people uh we should know what we're why we're living for what we're living and now Amos you remember that he went to the the Israel and and he looked out upon him and his complaint was this and we read this quote and I'd like to read it again before I make just a few more statements he says but those God anointed eyes of that Prophet didn't narrow because of the glamour so he went there and he saw a people that had walked away from God and they're very uh now they're more concerned about the world and what the world has to offer they're now working harder for their position in the world their their retirement uh their home uh their automobile uh so cares have come in that uh are having an effect on them it's pulling them they're they're now wanting to have more worldly knowledge and more education uh they want to have more prge and they want to wear nicer clothes and nicer things and and so all the time that they're doing this they're they're slowly giving up little bits of the law a little bit of habits that and traditions that they had uh they quit doing little things they quit washing the pant they they started inviting the Gentile over to their house for meals uh uh they they weren't they weren't uh washing the way that they used to wash and going through through all the ceremonies and you have to remember all those ceremonies in the Old Testament were put there for types they were Shadows of things to come uh they were they were incens and and marking post that were identifying a course and a way that man uh was supposed to uh be going like they they were landmarks uh that kept the people separated from the world and so that was what the law was given for by obedience to the law it was automatically going to separate you from those that didn't keep the law and that's why there was so many uh what we would call Holiness aspects built in to the law be and that man could follow they could actually follow the law intellectually and and of course their nature would fail so God provided a sacri sacrifice in our day he's provided a spirit that takes the desire for sin away and so uh we find out that that's what Amos was doing he was looking out over the people and started to see that they begin to take a different way a different way how they interpreted the law a a different way of what was important to them all of a sudden their attitudes changed their their desires changed the things that were important to them changed and they begin to drift away from God and and so that's what Amos uh came and said he said you you're the people I chose and and that's the first thing that they forgot they forgot their election they forgot that they were chosen they forgot that they were set apart they forgot that God could have set another people apart but he didn't they were who he set apart the blessing could have fallen on somebody else but it didn't it fell upon them they were elected they were chosen and they were separated now a lot then that thing began to get and they they like the fact that they were chosen but they didn't like the fact they were separated you know what I mean so that line begin to get murky now what do we call that line today they were getting lukewarm lukewarm so there was a a and lukewarm is the mixture of hot and cold it's when there's no clear definity in lines of choice so there's not something that's so definitive in your life that it influences the choice that you make so if you don't have that that that choice you know I've me a lot of people that that they're good Christians but they they they run after the dollar you know if there's a dollar there they drop everything and they they they they got to go to the dollar and I went through that real bad one time I remember when I was struggling and and I was cutting timber in the log woods and I got a job offer to work on Sunday and they were going to pay me in one day what I made a month because they had to have a road cut in to a piece of the forest and I remember remember oh I just I had I bent the law I figured it out that I could do that and not sin I studied my predestination and uh so you know I I I it was a lot of pressure on me to and of course the other guys the other loggers they wanted me to go because if if I went everybody would make money faster and and I remember going through that and then I remember remember I said well I'm not going to work on Sunday okay I'm I'm going to have my priority here and I'm not going to to do this and so I just made up my mind and and would the money have helped yeah it helps for a season you understand but I I didn't take the short season I took the long haul you know what I mean and and that is the way narrow is the path but wide is the path to destruction and it's very fluid but narrow is the way it's a narrow way and and I was a young believer and and I I just knew into the message and I really you know wanted to keep everything that was said well it's sad that time takes that away from you and so I remember I didn't do it and and I just didn't do it and and I remember that uh about a year later I was driving and and I thought you know I've been driving on these tires a long time and I looked out and my tires still had a lot of tread on them you know of course all I could afford was those 29 uh dollar specials you know what I mean they good for 20,000 mil and I was getting 100,000 miles I was getting a few extra miles per my gas and and a a lot of little things my electric bills were good and my water bills another it all that money I would have made showed up in another place plus I got more work than I ever could could dream of right next door to me and so you you find out that that that you you end up starting to find out the ways that you're going the the path that you're on uh what where's what's your end goal what is it is that you're trying to accomplish in the way that you're going now Israel began to forget that so this was this was his complaint let's go back to the complaint again and he said this he said his I is narrow it didn't narrow because of the glamour like some tourist but on the moral corruption to a people who was called to be blessed of God so they now weren't looking for their blessing from God you understand they were looking for their blessing from the society and the culture and the civilization that was around them you know okay if we're not careful you know a boom comes in and everybody wants to be a part of this boom and a part of this and a part of that and and you you you you you just got to learn we've got to learn to put on Christian blinders you know what I mean and just keep our eyes on the plow and keep our road going straight and so he said this he said to a people who was called to be blessed of God his eyes didn't look at the glamour they didn't narrow because of the glamour he glamour it was because the indecency and the corruption of the people that had been called to be chosen of God and would act in such a way as that so that's what he said so here's the people that's call that's called to be the children of God and they're acting in a completely different way so what when you act in a certain way you act because of your mind so their mind wasn't right you understand their affections had turned away from God and now their affections were on the things of the world it wasn't God first you know what I mean sacrifice began to drop out of their lives they begin and they begin to uh cut back on their tithing they begin to cut back on their uh offerings uh you know Amos has all this in his gospel that he's preaching and and so they're starting to make they're starting to make financial decisions they're starting to make uh uh uh social decisions they're they're starting to make uh choices based on not their Eternal position in God but based on the present tense that they're in and that is very tough battle because your present tense conditions will put so much pressure on us that it's hard to believe that if we don't do something that there's going to be a result come on us and is and Israel quit looking for God to supply their need they they they they couldn't take the pressure so they and they begin to the Glamour and the social and the climbing and the finance uh begin to get over they they begin to be concerned about how much money they had in the bank they began to be concerned about their pay demment and and all kinds of burdens began to enter in their life that never should been named among them because this is what Amos is telling them I've chosen you above all people I could have chose a lot of people but I chose you and so he goes on to say as we were reading he said and would act that way and then he says he see the corruption the Decay that's what he was looking at that's when he seen all of that it didn't attract him it sickened him at his soul why he was a prophet he knowed what God had promised to bless now this is what Israel is forgetting they're forgetting that God prom promised to bless them you're my children right I will not let you want you're my children I'll provide your every need they they they be so they they begin to come into a state you understand that they're beginning to walk away and so he and this is what he said he said he said and he was a prophet and he knowed what God had he he said he knowed what God had promised to bless and what a blessing was now Israel's forgetting this the blessings now have turned monetary the blessings now have turned social you you understand the the the things that used to Thrill their soul peace Joy longsuffering meekness those things aren't thrilling their souls no more they're they're they're they're slipping into carnality slowly but surely they don't realize it you understand they they don't they don't realize it they're being lulled asleep okay so look at this cuz we know it's a parallel of today and the and he knowed what God had promised to bless and what a blessing was and how the people act with the blessing so he began to see that they begin to act different than the blessing now back to my little experience so we had an election and so we we have this one man that that uh you know he's a Republican and and we have a a lady running well it that's difficult because one scripturally according to the Bible a woman shouldn't be in that position brother random said it was even a shame that she was that they were had police officers out there now that's very unpopular you understand that's almost now you're degrading women you're putting a woman on a lower level uh uh you have no respect for woman who are you to say that a woman should be in the kitchen and bearing children my goodness gracious what kind of old crank nut what are you a woman's got a right over her own body do you know that's not what the Bible says the Bible says the they have power over one another's bodies oh but all this is slipping away from the church they don't even know what the law taught anymore they don't even know what the rules are anymore that's that's all gone politics is gone up and people are uh and the the scripture says a good soldier doesn't entangle themselves in the Affairs of the world and now we've got message of Believers and sisters saying I'm for G and we got brother I'm for Trump oh my you you know what I mean and and and she got an agenda that's you know like way out here and for women's rights and women's to do this and and that and this other guy's over here and he's he's for the rich and oh man he makes a lot of money he's Rich what's the love of money it's the root of all evil so everybody say oh I want a better economy I want more money what do you going to get when you get more money more evil I can take you through scripture I can take you to the church ages I can take you when Prosperity hit in the church age how then the open door came and things began how that they built these communities and how they begin to move away from God because of prosperity Prosperity takes you farther away from God it just does so I I I got into this thinking oh my goodness if we have a woman president and that and she wins man we're at the end what you going to do to this country it's terrible and then all of a sudden I I I find well a a trump one oh now the world's not going to end GE Jesus you you don't have to come so quick we got four more years of prosperity we got four more years that we're not going to have all kinds of things stuck down our throat we got four more years and I thought what a deception that's right right you know it says in Matthew that the last days there shall be many false prophets the prophet of God says that was false anointings that's right that were men that carried anointings that anointed you to think that they were going to do better for you and the other person was carrying an anointing both of them were working for the same purpose and the same goal was to get your eyes off of what you're called to live for that's right so I thought wow I felt such relief you know why cuz man if KLA got it I'd have been on my knees every day I'd have been reading my Bible I'd be studying prophecy if she showed up into that in that Purp dress up there I'd have went through the seals every line by line Page by page I would have searched the 70 weeks at Daniel man I was going to dig in oh my and I thought after I I can go put my shovel away I oh I don't have to worry the economy is not going to crash we're not going to go into oppression we're going to have four more good years years the stock market's going up everybody's investing they've Gone Bananas all the wars are going to end what's the Bible say it says peace and safety then comes sudden destruction what's happened is we become like Israel and we forgot what we were called to be when we got here we're letting all kinds of things influence us you want to be prosperous put God first all else will be added unto you you make a decision for the kingdom God is obligated to bless you but they forgot that who was keeping Israel alive the only time Israel ever got in trouble is when they quit putting God first when they let the law slip they let everybody slip they let things slip and so all of a sudden everybody in the message is so excited because Trump's president you don't think he's got horns in a pitchfork and a fork and tail you just like a male devil bigger than you do a female devil but they're on the same side they're working for the same goal they're the author of confusion they work this confusion be beautifully they pull the the wool over everybody's eyes oh we're in better shape now or we'll be in better shape than we would if they if your spiritually corrupt it doesn't matter who's there come on that's right that's about who's controlling your life I thought in my heart I thought man if that woman livs i' turning off the radio for good I'm never going to listen to another newscast I'm not going to listen to No Talking Heads I'm going to go into my own little world and live in my own little shell well you want to know something that's where I should be all the time so now I got somebody oh I want to listen to him now what one group saying well he's Hitler he's the he's a fascist you know be be afraid be afraid and and and and liar and and the other one's doom and I I didn't hear one of them say God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son I didn't hear one of them say what we need to do is read our Bible Bibles and realize the fact that God fulfilled Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 revelations 10:7 in our day God sent a Prophet by which this nation should live by and we need to return back to the word of God that would have been the truth so alls it is is certain people like certain lives I love the LIE when they come up to me and say brother McGary you're looking thinner than you ever have yes sir I've been working on it yeah you like the flattery you like the L you like the security all of a sudden you feel so much more secure let me tell this is the same Prophet our Prophet said now you go right back over he preaches a message called spiritual Amnesia so he preaches the way of a true Prophet okay he's explaining why Amos had to say the things that he said because he was a true Prophet regardless of what it appeared he only looked at them through the eyes of the word yes now I hope I have that disease I hope I look at you only Through The Eyes of the word that's right I don't care what you think I don't care how you feel the most important thing to me is the word and for you to put the word first because if you do you'll get blessed and I I hate to see people in the same place the same Financial condition the same situation everything's the same in their life because they're caught in a cycle where they never can make that decision to sacrifice everything to put God first and they miss it they miss it it doesn't matter what decision that you make a lot of decisions people make don't even make sense to me why would you do that why would you do this why would you do that I hate to say this but I'll just be honest with you cuz it this I was going to run out and buy lesie a brand new car you can't hardly buy a car without paying several ,000 and so I I was going to trade her car in and so I thought I'd fix it up so I got some dents taken out of it and some scratch in and got it cleaned up and everything and brought it to the body shop then got to the body shop the lady in the body shop says why would you ever want to sell this car it's gorgeous and I got to thinking about it well I wanted to you know do something and then she says well I love my car I thought oh I'm so glad you love your car I just save $50,000 this my thinking's wrong you know what my thinking was right but God was still looking after me because I didn't I wasn't going to make one more nickel on trade in whether the seats were torn in that car whether it was full of d whether it had no tread on its tires I went out and got that car fixed up and cuz something was driving me to fix it up I thought it was to buy a new car but God was ordering my footsteps without me even realizing it and then I thought oh Lord how much am I missing and why am I missing it why all of a sudden that I feel a great relief of spiritual pressure and the pressure of the end of the world the pressure of the soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the idea that I've seen prophecy being fulfilled so fast and all of a sudden a guy gets a landslide election and prophet stops now that's one powerful dude right he can stop prophecy no no nothing stopped when they talk on their speeches the one person gets up says we're one we're going for the other one person gets up we might have lost but we haven't quit fighting we're still going to push what we believe in how can two walk together unless they agree they will never agree America's gone and if you let this guy persuade you all of a sudden things are better because he got elected then you're deceived and if you thought that could that she would be better for the country you're deceived there's only one thing that saves the believer and that's full obedience to the word of God it's putting Jesus Christ first in your life acting like a Christian what Christian principles are and let the love of God be shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost but what happened so what did Amos see so now go he preaches he preaches the way of a true prophet and he establishes Amos as being Vindicated to see and to call out now he goes preaches spiritual Amnesia and he preaches that message and he's telling you what Amos saw and what it was that Amos was calling out and so I'm I want to read just a few statements and close he says and he he makes a few little little statements and then uh we'll just close service and if anybody wants to stay for a few hours I think we might need a little bit of help setting up chairs next door uh and we'll talk a little a few little things but he says this and this is out of spiritual Amnesia and if you could read these two books together it it would really be a blessing so way of a true Prophet is is preached in uh uh June uh well no I think May is 51362 and he comes back and preaches spiritual Amnesia in 41164 he says well when you look at at a city and you look at a people you look at a church and you look at a people that's so far away from God there isn't nothing but to diagnose but sin what is sin unbelief there's so far away from God because they don't believe he's coming soon they don't believe the law matters they don't believe their decisions have consequences they don't search for the way what the Lord would do how they would approach it they don't place the timing of their actions they actually are out of control driven by all kinds of different ideas and Spirits he said so that's sin which is unbelief the wages of sin is death it's dying America's dying this guy is not going to come in and breathe life into America he's just going to make everybody get farther away from God well what would you have done if the other person would have elected well I hope the people that knew prophecy it would drive them closer to God but he ought to drive you closer to God if you have spiritual eyes have if you can see his poisons just a little more easy to eat or maybe not I don't know I just know he's a liar she's a liar Satan's a liar and there's no truth in them it's dying the diagnose proves what it is you see when people get away from God and won't listen to the word you have no more desire for the word then there's one diagnosis to it the soul that sinth the soul shall die unbelief shall separate you from God that's exactly right unbelief separates you from God the diagnosis is we're dying and all of a sudden that struck me what in the world is what was that this relief I felt what's that I I don't want that Satan appears as an angel of Light things will be better now we're not going to go down the tubes yeah you are what's wrong with you David you know better than that what is this relief it's an anointing it's an anointing oh everybody thought we were going in the wrong direction what direction were you going in nobody knows what direction they're going in what direction are you going in let's hope we're going up let's hope we're living for up let's hope we're praying even so come Lord Jesus you know you don't say oh my goodness gracious I'm I'm man I I just got saved from all kinds of trouble and confusion and and everything well you know maybe a little trouble and confusion a little pressure might just do us some good there's no relief here it's the biggest deception is going on and the worst part of it is it's happening right in the framework of this message people are becoming political people are siding with opinions they're siding with agendas and and God's got one agenda build yourself in the Statue of a perfect man if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you it shall Quicken your mortal body so that's what he said he said he says now once one diagnoses so so he he talks about it so what he's saying is now and he preached in this message they've got amnesia he says and another thing that cause it ca that he's talking about Amnesia now he says listen to what causes people to forget where they're going what they're doing where they've been that's what amnesia is it it's a total lack of remembrance of what's you've been through who you've been associated with where you've been working all of a sudden I got hit in the head I had I had a very bad conduct conduction in an accident and I was suffering with amnesia I had just got married and lesie came in the room and I looked at her I said who are you and she said well I'm your wife I went oh no recollection at all we just went through a statue of a perfect man and what does he say he who does not add these things cannot see a far off and forgot where he's come from Amnesia you haven't been through this word journey to forget that you were trying to go for a Rapture what kind of Amnesia has struck us what kind of Amnesia is letting us start to let the bars down and think that we're safe now because the stock market went up well you know the higher things go the farther they fall so listen another thing that causes among the people is getting between two opinions what was this whole election about two different opinions how many people got caught in between two different opinions to be honest we don't have a say in the matter another thing that causes people to get and have amnesia to forget their past forget where they come from forget where they're going another thing that causes it among the people is getting between two opinions that causes Amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your reason the reason I do this why I lost the reason I go to church on Sunday I lost the reason why I listen to tapes I lost the reason why I left my Bible they forgot the reason it astounds me how the prophet of God has covered the condition that the churches in tonight perfectly in his message word by word we we forgot we have an absolute we forgot we have a supernatural discerner the word of God that was preached to us to discern these things for us he said and and you don't know the reasons you've lost your mind you you you can't make you don't know who you are you can identify yourself you can you can walk around eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself you have got your scholarly education same education you had but you don't know where it come from and you don't know who you are and where you belong that's amnesia oh my now what's he talking about spiritual Amnesia so God has people in the last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a Christian means it's again this Amnesia has become among the people and they can't identify themselves they forgot all about it they had forgot his Holiness they have forgot his law the women were living like the rest of the women God's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people A peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name God called his church and separated it from the world for that very purpose amen he gave it a law he and he must be holy and said I am Holy you must be holy holy and without Holiness no man shall see God God said that himself and then he makes this statement he says I want to stop here a minute to say the same thing among our people today that's call themselves Christians their character oh if they would only realize and so I I just think that uh going into these meetings uh if there's something that a theme or something that's on my heart and I would ask maybe you would think about it and pray and meditate with me is I want to be about my father's business okay I don't want to be about the business of the world I don't want to find my place in the world I don't want to find anything the world has to offer I want to be about my father's business and what determines that is not what the world uses to determine success what are you measuring yourself against Israel stopped measuring themselves against the word of God and begin to measure themselves against civilization education and Science and that's how they begin to judge themselves and you know what happens to a Christian when he starts looking around them seeing the success of people seeing this seeing that and oh I've never had nothing I I I can't go on like this forever and and everything and they just get into that place that that what am I I I'm I'm going to do an Amnesia sets in they become uncontent there's not a a steadfast deep seated joy in their heart that nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand and he said the righteous shall not beg bread if I put him first I will not beg bread if I lose my house there's a reason for it if I lose my car it'll work out everything will be B but when you start measuring yourself by the world you have no peace you have no joy because the peace and joy of God surpasses understanding and the prophet of God preached a whole message called lean not to thy own understanding so if I measure Myself by the world I'll be about the world's business a carnal mind is enity against God but a spiritual mind is is joy and peace and happiness so this meeting when you come to this meeting come I with this in your heart nothing no Ambitions no goals no Lord I need this blessing I need that blessing just come and say Lord speak to me amen I want to be reestablished in your business I want to be about my father's business and you allow that to come and you just come and I believe God will speak to you in such a mighty way that you'll find out there's nothing in in this world to hold me here and it I I I I can't tell you what will happen either way but I know one thing God never changes his mind about his word so don't don't get excited and don't get discouraged this whole thing is nothing but a deception God bless you so uh brother Chris do we still we do we have all the chairs set up okay so we'll get some Brothers now let uh and so I hope you got my sermon um so we're if if even you that

Sun okay just remember the sandwiches are free the barbecue is free there's people that are taking out your track cash they're cleaning up your dishes they're setting up the tables for you you know

second string of servers that'll let the first string eat and then we have the Third string maybe that means that the first is better whatever but we'll take care of all the servers we'll have drinks and you say well brother McGary is it going to be chaos yes I've been pastoring for 40 some five I don't know 50 years now it's chaos that's what makes it fun you know what I mean you don't want to have so much order there's no Liberty this goes here and this goes there and this is no we're going to spill water on the floor we're going to dump food all over the counters kids are going to be running around with drinks uh people's going to knock barbecue sauce on you praise God you know what I mean I've got a garment coming a a robe white as snow you know what I mean that's the robe I want I already went through that I'm just confessing so I got into this dress for success thing when I was about 35 years old a long time ago so I went and got me a really nice pair of alligator shoes you know and I had an alligator bike now like that was going to make me money I'm going to buy a pair what do you think this is something like Wizard of Oz you know you get a certain pair of shoes on and you're going to fly into success so I got and so I went and got this suit and I found this material that was from England and it had the Royal stamp on it so this was the material they used for the royal family and I so I G to have a suit made well it I wasn't going to just get a suit I was going to have me a tailored made suit all in my mind thinking that this was going to be successful and I began to hang around with successful people I forgot the scripture narrow is the way to heaven and people that find it but all of a sudden I want to be around all these guys that were making money and liked everything well you know never Dawn them the reason they're making money is they're cheaters they're liars and they're deceivers you'll never be successful the way they'll be successful cuz you're not willing to pay the price so I got this beautiful suit I finally wore it to church well first of all I found out there wasn't one Christian that could tell the difference between penny loafers and alligator shoes so that didn't matter to them a belt was a belt and the best I got out of a compliment oh you got a new suit yeah is that all you can say this is Royal wool well I forgot the real wool that I was supposed to have so there I go so we go out to eat and here comes a sister nice real Christian sister and she has a jar of baby food and it's some sort of orange banana squashed baby food she dropped it right in front of me it hit the floor and came all the way up my suit up and then down this side it only took one service for that suit to make the Rapture cuz it was gone ruined and the only success I got from all those clothes was a lesson from the Lord you don't dress the outside man for Success you dress the Inside Man and he promised that you would be successful okay so the church will be hot and the church will be cold the sound will be loud and the the sound will be soft some of the instruments will be louder than other instruments I know everybody's like going to a little Le game I thought you know every parents looking only at their kid nobody cares what you're doing or what your kids's doing they're not there for your kid they're there because they think they're little Johnny is going to make a major league player they already see him in the majors fatten 300 let's get real it's not going to be perfect but if you're perfect in your heart and you're perfect in your motivate objective then a lot of this other stuff just don't matter if you complain where the Deacons sit you here you would probably complain at the wedding supper when am I sitting way down here for you you sound like the sons of zebon who were arguing about who got to sit where sit down wherever you're put be happy you're alive you know what I mean you'll be shouting Hallelujah in Hallelujah Square let's get rid of all the complaints let's get rid of all the what's perfect let's get rid of everything I noticed we CH somebody gave us some

don't let nothing bother you okay and I'll settle the issue the pastor has supreme authority if I think the fork should be on the right side instead of the the left side and I put the forks on the right side I don't care what the etiquette book says Let It Go Let It Go there's bigger fish to fry they're Sinners to be saved do you understand if I got purple flowers and yellow flowers and you

if you help people if if you if you do what you can do and then we'll certainly love uh you and God will love you for it and I'll tell you something you can never do one thing for God that he doesn't reward you hundredfold in this life and the life to come so you know that's what somebody said to me the day they said oh the only reason he got elected because of his policies he's an evil person but his policies are real good and the guy said well yeah that's kind of like you you know you're kind of a rough person but your gospels right so I thought okay that's what's important the important thing is we have an absolute we have a messenger it don't matter about me it don't matter about anything we have an absolute we have a word let the love of God be shed in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so if you want to spend a few minutes praying you don't have to do it here I know I took a lot of time but if you would uh pray for the meeting pray for yourself pray that you could come in with a

opinions he warned us about the political environment and where we put our trust and where we put our hope and Lord we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that our Angel to our age told us that his coming was overdue and that he could come at any minute or any time and even the Lord himself speaking to each of us individually said thou fool What If thy soul is required of you this night Lord and
