great big [Music] God and Lord we can't comprehend how you can come in the presence of man and not only be here where you can be felt make an impression upon us and but Lord you said that you would be in us as a prophet of old said who is [Music] man that God would even consider him or the son of man Lord that you could visit us in a way that Lord it brings life to us Lord we just ask tonight this your overwhelming presence can come in a Great and Mighty way Lord that we can have faith and believe on behalf of these requests have been made mention Lord even those that are upon our own Hearts we know your word you're a discerner of the very thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord even when we come with stammering lips and don't know how to pray on every behalf or every situation Lord but you

children that you wouldn't turn away but Lord a needful helpless child Lord we are nothing we can do nothing in our flesh Lord it it's weak we know the battle is in the mind but Paul reminds us let

then you cleaned us up and you molded us in made us into something that you desired and you put your own Glory upon it Lord and nobody can buy it back oh I'm so grateful for that yes it's yours father we the purchase of the price of Calvary Lord and we rest in that this evening and we're so grateful for that father we just ask that you would bless us tonight and help us understand what our faith is in our faith is not in a hope so or in a might be but our faith is in the revealed word of God that it will happen exactly the way that you said it would we trust in that in Jesus name we pray amen amen we're going to continue this evening and listen to another 40 minutes uh from the message uh I I believe it's um God's power to transform or God's transforming power I keep getting them mixed up and so the the purpose of what that we're uh doing is we want to build our faith we're going to have to have faith in a measure that we've never had it before and we've got to uh totally understand where that you're standing and so this message really explains what's transpiring all around you and if you can see what's transpiring around you and who that you are and in your election is going to build your faith because if he started a work in you he'll finish it to the end and all the father hath given me will come so and our scripture that uh we read was in Romans and you remember in that scripture I'm sorry I can't read it but he said be ye not be not uh be ye transformed and not conformed and so this is God's power to transform you and no matter how bad this world is he has the power to turn you into what he wants you to be and to fulfill his promise in you and so we're happy to play the message I don't believe you can separate the message from the messenger I believe it with all my heart that our Salvation is tied to receiving God's word for the age that we live in so let's just have a prayer we'll start playing the message you may be seated uh is is this the what is this the paragraph we're starting on right here uh 145 is that correct okay I so we're starting um and and which message is it power of transformation okay so I know you can look it up on your devices and Mark your quotes and follow along so Lord richly bless you uh let's pray our father as we listen to your messenger may it speak out to us today as you are so describing the very realm that we're living in and father May our faith Touch the Hem of your garment and father may we set our wings like evil and Rise Above father the great Victory we ask it in jesus' name God bless you may be sa now watch the first thing he done you tell me when you think we got enough here cuz I stop on this anywhere K went out from the presence of the Lord there he made his mistake and there's where you'll make the mistake there's where I'll make the mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of God Cain went from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of not on the East of Eden see how religious it was went around to the east side east side and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch and Enoch buildt a city see civilization he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch and Enos was born aod and Aid be uh and aod be took unto him two wives the name of the one was Adra and the name of the other was zela and Adra bar jabel and the father of such dwelt in tents and of such that has cattle and his brother's name was jubil I guess ju ubl he was the father as such as handled the harps and organs see music sign coming in and Ze also bear tuban an instructor of ever um uh a r t i f i c e r a brass and iron in other words kind of molding putting it together and uh the sister of tub tuban was naam and liik said unto his wives adri and Zella hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slay a man to my wounding and a young man to my heart if can shall be a ventage seven times truly liic 7 s folds Sevenfold now notice as soon as they went out from the presence of the Lord they started building cities they started making instruments they started in science they making brass and iron and playing music and so forth see see now where did it come from who went out king the serpent seed understand it Cain went out and notice he went out from the presence of the Lord and started working in science now look where he's Still Working Science Education cities culture it's of the devil who started it the devil who is it on today the devil atomic bombs and things to destroy us we live in it we have to live here we're a being we have to here but God's Great civilization won't have any of that in it see and science is taking is taking the natural things and perverting it to do things that it wasn't intended to do and so is scientific religion it takes a word of God and makes a church organization out of it instead of doing the things that it's supposed to do they said the days of Miracles is passed the Bible said he's the same yesterday and forever there is no such a thing as Divine Healing go ye into all the world and preach the gospel ever creature these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink that they think that won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover well all nations everybody Every Creature oh I am with you even to the end of the Earth into the the world Cosmos the whole thing into the consummation these absolutely there and now see they take signs and say oh well as long as we gather together in johar church and we become this a good straight member we pay our uh see it's it's not saying oh there is no such a thing as God you heard my tape on the false Christ in the last days see not the false Jesus Satan know better than that see but false Christ Christ means the anointed one and they're actually anointed Anointed with what the Holy Spirit to do signs and wonders and they do it but see when it comes down now we're in the last age not back in the Pentecostal age there we're over here in the last age in the first age begin with the word which was Christ and the last age has to end with the word which is Christ and these other things is Shucks and so forth explained is just carriers of the word to serve its purpose until it comes into the full statute see of what the original Green was now 25th verse and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said she has appointed me another seed and instead of Abel whom Cain slew and to Seth and to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enus and then man be to call on the name of the Lord see how that serpent seed went off into science education cities music and great things and education and Science and so forth but the seed of the righteous one who it was see Eve didn't have a seed you know that the woman doesn't have a seed female she has an egg but not a seed but she appointed a seed see appointed for God's appointment she took the seed the great seed course from the woman was that God gave seed God appointed her a seed instead of the one that Cain slew that the enemy death Serpent's Seed slew God's seed in perversion there you see God appointed to the woman a seed which is Christ see to bring back The Original Seed again you see it and so you see the perversion brought death through education and intelligence and what we call today science and religion and so forth it brought death but she appointed him the SE and then man be to call upon the name of the Lord it begin to come back to the word again see and remember follow that seed as we track it in a few weeks on this serpent you follow that it switches right through the scripture watch it and two Vines grow right together as you heard my message on the vines they come right up together and so close together that it would almost deceive the very elected if possible in the last days when they come to the Head it puts forth a grain just like a wheat but it isn't a wheat see it isn't it's a shf yet now see there's civilization education I think I've got about 10 more scriptures you see WR down there but I think not to go through that but we understand by this that education science and civilization is of the devil right it isn't of God it is of the devil now I don't say you shouldn't have it no certainly not a little later on I can would prove that that God just like you wearing clothes you women Us Men We wern't supposed to wear clothes in the beginning but see we live in this age we do we must wear clothes see it's appointed to us to do that we must wear them but in the beginning we didn't have to see because we knew no sin but now we have to now we have to have a moiles now we must go places and visit and so forth in automobiles in science and so forth but it isn't of God it is not of God education but there God's form of Education civilization science is in its original condition it goes beyond this what we're doing now look they take uh uh certain things and put certain things together and it makes a chemical that will destroy now leave them in their right position they're all right put them together you're all wrong see see it brings death and when you try to take the word of God and put it in religion of this world you bring death to yourself it kills the subject see what I mean it kills the person you say well now look you believe in god oh now you don't have to believe that you you you are church right then that's the boom that kills a it kills a subject you've got to let everything fall aside and take the word only stay right with that word don't leave when God said so that's just what it is I don't care what education can prove in the days of Noah they could prove there was no water up there in the skies but God said there was coming some down and he come that's right they say today there's no fire out there to fall but watch it fall one day how we go to do this and do that watch God do it he he said it would do it and that seed will take a hold somewhere glory to God the only thing he's looking for today is a beding ground somewhere it can bed it'll start in somebody it'll pervert it spray it like it at Eve it started in Eve for her to bed forth and bring forth sons of God not Sons of Satan but she was a betting ground and it fell in the wrong place so will the word fall in an unbeliever or doubter or skeptic true you don't make a church member out of never a son or daughter of God you tell them what their hair girl they laugh in your face they tell them to do this or that man do it they laugh in your face it's not sons of God it's a wrong betting ground yet they're holding the seed see the false anointed ones they're anointed yes with the Holy Spirit speak in tongues and do signs and wonders but it's of Satan Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have not I cast out devils and work great Mighty works and wonders in your name he said depart from me you workers of iniquity what is Iniquity David said if I conceive iniquity in my heart God will not hear me see iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but won't do it it's iniquity see you know these your St with the word of God but for the church sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of God and do what the organization says well I don't know my church says we should do it this way and I believe it this way and you right before you that you shouldn't do it that's iniquity depart from you you that work iniquity look at the great St Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 He said though I speak with tongue of men and angels you that want somebody wanted to lay on to that that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost Paul said though I speak with tongues like men and angels and have not charity like you all have here I'm nothing see you can speak with tongues yes because it's a word a preacher can take this word and go forth and preach it and say that word and that word will grow but the preacher could be a hypocrite himself it's a word see but the true living creature of God take all of the purpose word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out and you add something else with that you got a perverted plant if I start out here with a wheat and put a a cuckle bur with it and in breed him together if it could be done so over the pollen and put in that I got a wheat cuckle be see it looks like a wheat yet it's a CLE it ain't genuine life it can't reproduce itself again it'll come forth but it can't reproduce itself a a a donkey can breed to a m horse and she'll bring forth a mule but that mule can't breed back to a mule it's a hybrid let every word bring forth of its kind see it can breed once and the church can come as organization once but it can't rebreed itself it brings out another organization Lutheran can't breed the Lutheran it brought out a Methodist and Methodist brought out a a Pentecostal see it can't rebreed back because it's dead it can't start a Revival where did God ever start a Revival in an organization look over your history he never did it's the organization forms behind the Revival when Luther the man of God came forth to the message of justification behind him come the Lutheran Church they could never could build up then God sent a man by the name of John Wesley there come a Revival behind that what they do organize it never could re ring itself again see it's sterile Hallelujah but the word of God shall ever endure that's right it'll bring forth this time here come a Pentecost along you can't look what it done organized it can't rebreed itself they can have old Roberts and everything else all over the country it cannot do it it'll hang right back to that old natural breed of the mule it cannot no matter how many CS it has is still how many of the spiritual um Affairs it has and whatever it has is you you're adults you know what I'm talking about no matter how many husband and wives it has and whatever more how many little sisters it builds up out here and little churches and organizations it cannot read a Revival it's finished it crossed up to the world from the word of God and it cannot reproduce itself again God raise up some other something and start his word moving on if it organizes it'll die too right it cannot reproduce itself because it's a hybrid correctly look at your hybrid corn today they say that's the best corn it's it's a killer it's what's killing you your lives wasn't made for your bodies wasn't made for that your bodies was made for the original grain that's the reason your fathers and mothers and so forth live longer that's the reason they were tough man 70 80 years old was rough and tough see they lived on the Natural Things watch these old mountain man out here live on deer and and the original grains put a man in here in a city here he comes along a big SLO but about 35 40 years old soft certainly H get off the subject don't no but I'm trying to get it over to you that's civilization what we call culture culture you hear so much about that uh you ever hear what my estimation of culture was it's a man that ain't got nerve enough to kill a rabbit but can eat a belly full of after somebody else kills it so that's what I I I I think a culture is it's it's right we don't God don't come there a culture of man into God you don't civilize him into God he's born a seed of God from God always was God and can never be nothing else but God you're not cultured into it now how he has his kind of eeden and by deformed seed Satan has made his great e even in great Eden now what is it culture science beautiful churches High Steeples fine polished preachers education d a d PhD LL D doctor of literature doctor of divinity doctors every time he's pronounced that it just takes him that much farther from God the St in PL away and the congregations don't want somebody St there and use their words to hit H and tote and carry and fetch they don't want that they want some beautiful something that's the same thing Kean had on his mind or daddy at the beginning offered flowers and fruits of the land when God wanted sacrifice a man with the revelation of God it was blood not a pear or peach or Plum or whatever it was or ocot as they say now it was a blood that brought us out of the Gard of being a a degraded blood a woman that let the seed of the wrong person be planted in the womb and start it now we find to prove the messeng is is timely what I'm speaking to you about to Pro it look at the days of high breeding today trying to make a prettier species look at high breeding look in the plant life here last summer as this summer it was I had a little wild flower you showing me out there a few minutes ago come on my mind little wild flower I had in a bed there I had to water that thing twice a day to keep it alive it was a hybrid but it originated from another little yellow flower which was put together but something else to make this flower and that little guy stood out there when you could dig 10 feet in the ground and couldn't find even a enough marer to spit see it was it was it was just living in the dust and it was just this pretty and it didn't have to be watered it was original it wasn't hybrid it was nothing mixed to it it was genuine flour and this is something mixed with it had to water it and pet it and baby it see this you didn't no bugs got on it we had to spray it and everything else to keep them flies and gats and things on off like you don't kill them you don't have KN when come near you oh that's a real genuine born again Christian you can temp him with anything you want to he's still a Christian tempt her wherever you want to be she's still a Christian little lady from one of your brothers here some of your people their Church wrote me a letter today said Daddy don't want me to go to baseball or basketball game brother BR We Believe said was 12 years old said brother BR we believe you have the word of the Lord and what you tell us now said I kind of think Daddy's wrong but said what you say I'm going to bleed now sweet little girl see I thought well I said honey look if you are a Christian you're a Christian anywhere no matter where you at you're still a Christian but I said you see on the basketball floor what Daddy's thinking about you hear them kids swearing and carrying on like that I still believe you'd be a Christian but you see Daddy's more advanced in life than you are see I said now you're 12 years old you said you had a little sister four now she wants you to cut paper dolls oh go on I ain't got no time to cut paper doll see you're a far Advan in little sister uh that's where the church ought to be today further advanced in the word of God not Methodist Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterian but advanced in the word the Sons and Daughters of God all right all right the message being timely proved by science by his science and research you see they have tried to pervert everything make a different seed make a different something make it prettier look at our sisters I remarked a while ago about how pretty they look oh you might stand them up out here in a World's contest with some of this Glory swan or some of these strip teasers and things over here in California they miss it a million miles but they M ain't on that book of Fame it's on the Book of Life see a Meek and a humble spirit is a great treasure to God and the Bible said for for our women to Adorn themselves with a Meek and humble Spirit subject to your husband and sweetness that's what's a great price and sign of God that's right not all this year that's what they done they Max Factor has be beautified women outwardly which is of Satan all that stuff is of the devil do you know that certainly it's all of the devil I remember my little wife when she's pretty and young she didn't wear makeup no she come up I baptized her in the name of Jesus when she's little KNE dresses like that but now she's getting old she said I'm just getting so wrinkled I said you know as you get older my eyes get dimmer I remember the way you was and I remember KN in my heart what you're going to be some with a quiet and sweet spirit that you have God will get us together you know around that's that then would never be changed then so why but you see in the days of Noah when the sons of God saw the daughters of man were pretty they taken unto them women for wives see the sons of God saw the daughters man because they were sexy and and dressed like that they they lusted for the women and they went for them see um thankfully but you sons of God seen beyond that H that women make themselves see but what is it it's all pretty it's a high breeding take some of them wased your face a you wouldn't know what you had see that's right maybe enough dier to find a bus all and and nasty and honoring and filthy and run around with other men I don't care what my wife I I respect loyalty in anymore when I was a little boy I always said if a negro woman wanted to be I shed the last drop of my blood to keep her that way I respect what's right a right thing I've tried to live that all my life I was young then now I'm old I haven't changed my ideas a bit see sign in the same pattern Eve did he also has done to the church pervert her over he carried out his plans today through his hybrid Church his modern Eden that we have today we're living in a scientific Eden Satan's Eden a scientific Eden if you want to turn to it now Isaiah 14:12 I quote it to you if you want to if you want 12 and 14 Satan said in his own self I will exalt myself above the most high you'll have a kingdom that he be even the sons of God would worship him and that's just exactly what he's done he's done it through church religion like he started in the beginning religion he's done it also as the prophet Paul seen in 2 Thessalonians the second chapter he he heads up in E his great scientific Eden in this day in scientific and education civilization and has made himself and will finally head up in ecumenical council where all churches will have to bow to him and see what it is it's that Spirit of delusion working among the people sons of God which were made in the image of God and Daughters of man which was made in the image of man has taken them under falsehood like he did Eve and has formed himself through his own gimmicks of Science and education and culture to he's got himself a modern scientific death Eden where God by his word spoke and he had a Eden without death no science no education like we have today or no civilization You See It Now understand it now he's got his Eden look all the churches worship Him second Thessalonians said that man who calls himself God sitting in the temple of God all upon the Earth shall bow down and worship Him whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the earth see it's a modern Eden now what's he done himself he's moving himself Rome this final great eating edting place you see why the pope come over here the other day you know what all them 13s that happened then he spoke 13 words had 13 taking communion uh uh SP uh in Yankee Stadium which is 13 everything was 13 and our nation's number is 13 prayers in 13 chapter of Revelation 13 stripes 13 stars 13 bars 13 numbers on the coins 13 stars on the co everything's 13 and a woman here comes the Pope the head to the woman the false Antichrist to the false bride of science which our world our American Eastern World here Western world has led the world in science comes to her in his scientific church and now the whole prence is bwing to him on 13 this everything is a 13 our whole nation everything else is 13 A Woman's World see here we are we got it it turned into a woman's world the Garden of the Eden but it'll be God's world someday notice now also the uh these prophets and things is foretold it and now all again has come like it was before God moved upon the Earth it's become a spiritual chaos certainly it had here notice the second eent type closely to the first to deceive almost to take the elected notice now I'm going to compare here just a few minutes I'm going to have to stop because it's 11:00 and um so listen these two Edens how this Eden has tried to type just like Satan did at the beginning to Eve in the real Eden the first Eden just watch them type together now see we got now everybody understand clearly a scientific Eden we're living in see now it wasn't God's Eden God's Eden doesn't come with Science Education culture it comes by the word calling all these things as though they were not notice in the Garden of Eden that's just compar now notice the man and his wife head of in the Garden of Eden the pair was naked and didn't know it is that right and God's Eden the pair was naked and didn't know it now they are naked again and don't know it Revelations 3 the lady of seean church because Thou Art naked miserable poor wretched blind and don't know it now in God's Eden they were naked and didn't know it and now in Satan's Eden they by science and education they're naked again and don't know it what a perversion look at today look at man trying to wear his wife's underne clothes and she's trying to wear his clothes and he's trying to let his hair grow like hers and she's cutting hers off like his oh my man try to be women women try to be man a perversion that's the same thing the church is doing same thing the lady of see and age notice the reason that they didn't know they were naked in the beginning there was a holy spirit Veil them from nakedness they didn't know it the Holy Spirit was over their eyes they seen nothing but their brother and sister LW they didn't know they were Holy Spirit now the spirit of unholiness un cleansiness and lust has veiled him education science why it's scientific where shorts is cooler the Indians teach you better than that they wrap up in a blanket to be air conditioned see and put on them see education has absolutely come back to a Time the very thing that they think that brought to culture and civilization has put them back in ignorance again worse than there was in the first place schooling education look at schools look down there at University other night them boys how many babies is born but them young ladies there to them young ladies each year at the University you think you said this is Street trash and them boys them 21 Jewels they call them with lipstick on and and hair banged and rolled up on curlers and hanging out they say that dirty neck filthy you say well that's a street C is it it's students of the University they got on a big drunk the other night and they didn't know what to do and so to have kicks drinking and adultery and everything like that wasn't enough for him they broke the bottles and run the women's door and knock on the door to come punch them in the face cut one girl's eye completely out and lot them disfigured for life you think they let that out two of the boys right up down the street and two young married women sitting on a on the steps and they insulted the women their pops pick them up put them in jail Dean come down there and the whole thing striving on that university only works got there said them's my kids you turn them loose you turn them loose there you are civilization education leads to death and chaos and hell should listen to that stuff notice now he just had to take a little peep to see what the world looked like you know a lot of times we have to just wear a little bit of this or you know me you have to take a little bit of Peep to the now St John 1 John 2:15 the God said if you love of the world or even the love of the world the love of God's not even in you the things that's out there are dead you're circumcised cut off from it you don't want the things of the world you're dead they're dead you don't want anything dead is rottenness smells How could a living for something want something is filthy like that you're alive in Christ the word makes you alive man I think of it this day that we're living in called education you can't get in the pull pit let she got a doctor's degree and so forth it reminds me of a chaplain one time coming out of the army said he said brother BR first world war said chaplain said a sergeant come out and said chapain you ride out Battlefront out Aron out there from L FR you know and said I went out towards the arone forest and said he take a number of so many tanks have been blowed up it says on Easter morning said just got through I walk through as the nurse and she's giv those wounded boys American Rose one American boys grab that R just scream and cry cuz they know it come from home it was from home that's where I think we do the word oh God here comes from home see so I see him pretty up in my heart and said went out there and said and the the captain went on out to take a number of how many tanks have been destroyed and things like that said the holy spirit said go over to that little rock he looked around and said sold that mustard and chlorine gas and said just burn all the leaves off the trees one the living thing left and here it was Easter he said what Easter what a Easter well not even grass on the ground not nothing and said something attracted into a rock you pull the rock over to there's a little Easter flower under be kept under the rock all poison gas and oh God keep me under the Rock of Ages till all this poison pass let me Bloom and that land on her we could stop right here if you wish to because I got so much I never get to it anyhow to of things so maybe I can come back again and get it to you oh I just got through preaching the other day a thinking man's filter you all read that produces a holy man's taste think Breen whatever you do think Ephesians 5:26 and there said and we talk about the word of predestinated you see that stumbles so many am it's God's word he uses it for we're predestinated by the word of God and it uh and that we when you're predestinated well it has to happen because it is a God God chose you because he know what you do from the beginning don't let the devil spray you with education and poison and stuff like that you have to be modern you have to be this you don't have to be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God if you're born of the word you do notice that spray of you take a seed a good seed and you spray it it'll it'll kill it and when they spray this denominational stuff over the top of you it'll ruin the influence of the original word if they tell you have to do this all the other girls do it the other man do it don't you believe that it'll ruin God's influence of his word upon you you know that our text says don't be conformed sprayed but be transformed the seed that's in you people of the day act like they don't even believe there is a God do you know that they act like that now I don't want to call them fools but they act like it for Psalms 141 says the fool is said in his heart there is no God you shouldn't call a person a fool but they certainly Act like they are because they don't they act like there is no God this word is just ignored look here the other day they called me room to watch Billy Paul I believe there some of them had said there was a a religious program on the television we don't have television won't be one in my home never but there was a if you want them that's up to you but God told me not to do it and uh when we moved in our rent from this sweet old sister up there she had a television because they had to have it for to rent her house and I let him look at a religious program so they were they called and said there was a gospel singing on and you talk about a bunch of Ricky up there act like they call themselves gospel singers it was a discredit to Jesus Christ to see the way he kind of shaking themselves and and these Ricky fied haircuts and everything you know it just it just look it just look like is a mockery came of such a person religious indeed certainly but he had the wrong seed in him and therefore it brought forth the serpent seed Satan had hissed over this seed of Eden and that's what brought forth the king he put his poison upon him he Kain knew the perfect will of God he knew the perfect will of God Kain knew it why but he refused to do it he proved then to be the serpent seed when he seen the perfect will of God he refused to do it he had seen God vindicate Abel's message he know that was the will of God he seen God vindicate Abel's message and what did God say to him and he just he said do the same do worship like your brother and and you'll do well but you see he seen the perfect will of God but he didn't want it he want to add something to it and these theologians see this Bible they read it but they don't want to do it see it shows the serpent seed yet seen it Vindicated and and so simply before the people but it seems like it's so hard for people to Humble themselves to the word of God don't you all find when you're talking you women to girls about wearing long hair and they say why you got your hair long see why you wear your skirts down long you go talk to them they kind of give you the shoulder isn't that right see they know that's right if there if there's any lady in them see they know that's right but you see they can't humble themselves to that that's what see how Cain did he couldn't humble himself to the Vindicated word of God he couldn't do it oh even the Pentecost glory to God hallelujah I cut my hair and speak in tongues that shows right there there something wrong the seed's bringing forth something different a seed cannot a seed of God cannot bring forth a bob haired woman it cannot do it just can't do it because the Bible said so it can't do it now it seems so hard to Humble to God's word notice this in Genesis 46 and 7 Miss reading off some scripture here do as Abel did he said if you see what your brother said go ahead and do what Abel did do the same kind of a service that he did and and I'll bless you if you don't sin layeth at the door now sin is unbelief if you don't do as Abel did you seen I Vindicated him and made him right now if you don't do that then it shows that it's sin unbelief lays at the door see and today they see what God vindicates they see what God's doing they see all these things happening they know about it God showing his signs in the heaven above and on earth below and all these things like that they see what's taking place but they won't do it see Satan serpent seed smart come out of seminaries educated to the spot every word every Everything stand up hope it just is correct and every word has to be exactly their grammar has to be right and everything like see sure they can't humble themselves oh Gody like that see they just can't do it they don't they just can't do it now if not sin lies at the door unbelief then he become willfully disobedient and when you know to do good and doth not to you it's sin if you know what's right and you don't do it see then he become will prisent after the word had been Vindicated then he crossed the separating line then he was ousted from Eden when he cross there's a line that where you just go so far and if you go any further over on the other side you're out you know that don't you there's a line if you don't believe it you read Hebrews 1026 that's the scripture I was referring to there see for if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin that's New Testament that right if we sin willfully After we receive the knowledge that's been preached to you read to you proved to you and to receive the knowledge of the truth and you go ahead and unbelieve will y there's no more sacrifice for sin but a fearful looking to the far ignation who shall Devour the adversary is that right you can cross that line like the children of Israel did in their Journey coming through the Wilderness Israel did the same after they heard Moses message and seen it Vindicated listen to a false prophet it said oh now look children we're all the same we should marry one one another and we should do this and Moses had told him different and seen God Vindicated because bam seemed to be a more uh uh instructive man than Moses was see he come from a great nation where his great people and is all organized together the land of Moab great armies and great things that the people of them days would have feared here come a prophet now a prophet anointed one false anointed one see come down to a anointed one look how close and taught the people and many of them went after that don't you never forget that went after the thing that wasn't the word the Vindicated proven word don't let someone come in here and tell you something different watch what God vindicating and proving now then people look back say Moses god appeared in the skies and the man spoke into existence fleas flies frogs took out of existence BS and diseases opened up the Red Sea and we come and F us Mana Out of Heaven oh that's our Prophet but here come another Prophet down glory to God I'm Prophet too say now you all I tell you I I you understand I use better grammar than Moses and I'm this way and that way see so forth and the first thing you know they fell apart and every one of them perished right in the wilderness not one of them lived they never they won't be in heaven not one of them Jesus said they said our fathers eat man in the wilderness see Pentecostal is right really come through all the experiences they my fathers eat man in the wilderness he said and there are everyone dead death is eternal separation they'll never rise again although they've been through all these experiences figured he speaking they spoken tongues and danced in the spirit and everything but when it come to the showdown between the word between two prophets one of them on the word and the other off the word both of them Prophets You Understand say Amen one on the word and the other off the word both of them prophets proven to be prophets but one was with the word see false anointed ones in the last days one prophets both of them prophets one on the word one one Vindicated by the word and the other was not Vindicated by the word Cain and Abel again see the two false false and true all right but every one of them rotten in the wilderness and perished their souls are dead and gone and they are right in the path of Duty going to church and the Very things that God ordained them to do but accepted a false teacher who wasn't Vindicated by the word to be proven to be right yet he was the doctor Divinity and whatever more you want to call about a real Prophet but wasn't proved spiritually by the word and by the signs of God and they perished in the wilderness righteous honorable religious people died and will never be in heaven see where we got to walk understand don't lay it look same as in the times Noah seed word erected a floating transformation from the Earth to the the sky it sound crazy to the people to have a little cult like Noah had and he told him said thus sayith the Lord God has spoken and there's coming a rain science and the educated and religious of that they say look that old quack he's getting old his mind slipping see but he was right because he was a Vindicated prophet and then at the end time his message was truly Vindicated what would he do he transformed from the Earth to Glory by Arc of the word that he was preaching it was transformed the scientific spre rotted the rest of them in the Judgment they had rotted up on the Waters of the Judgment of the flood what are people trying to do today in this great scientific age of Education the Eden Church restored again to its Eden scientific condition instead of the word word are they exalting the word of God is people trying to exalt the word of God are they trying to exalt themselves which is it wonder the church is form seed knowledge program has caused the whole race again by scientific to be scientifically ignorant of the word of God scientifically ignorant of the word of God that's a big mouthful isn't it but they are they can't be it was when Jesus came the day that Jesus came them man know that word of God just Bel letter didn't they sure but they were ignorant of who he was when they seen God on the wings of a d perform and do just exactly what he said he would do and he done just what the word said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but he did just as the word said he would do and they were scientific man in them days but scientifically ignorant to willfully sin lust and blinded they need God's word to show her to show her nakedness in Revelations 3 said I counsel the to buy from me Sav that your eyes might be open that you might see your nakedness the sav is God's word the healing of the eyes that brings you from natural things of the world and transforms you by the power of God into his presence then you see you say I once was lost now I'm found I was blind but now I see It'll be different that's what the church's call is today is our counseling to come by of me Saad for your eyes that you might be Anointed with my Sav and then you'll see let the Holy Spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there that a healing comes from the inside let that healing come from the spirit it's in you if it's a genuine Spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a son or daughter of God but the genuine Spirit can come up a a cuckle bir seed the rain can fall Upon A cuckle and it'll make it live just as same as it falls upon a wheat and make that live but by their fruits you know them we're a fruit tree of God bearing his word Jesus said let a man deny himself and follow me let him deny his education deny his knowledge deny his degrees take up his cross and follow me a lot of stuff in there amen we'll we'll go over some of it again uh Sunday
