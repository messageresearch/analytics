[34:56] amen let's just bow our heads father
[34:59] we ask you to bless the word to us this
[35:01] evening
[35:02] as we fellowship around the word of god
[35:05] coming out of great meetings
[35:07] fathers we just our hearts are thrilled
[35:10] and we're just
[35:11] asking you to stand in your word tonight
[35:14] and bless the people in jesus name we
[35:17] pray
[35:18] amen
[35:19] amen if you have your bibles
[35:22] let's
[35:24] turn over to the gospel of saint john
[35:28] the 14th chapter
[35:30] and
[35:34] the
[35:36] 19th
[35:37] and
[35:38] 20th verse and
[35:41] so
[35:43] it's going to be hard for me to match
[35:44] the meetings but
[35:46] the only match for the meetings is the
[35:49] word itself
[35:51] amen did you hear when the prophet of
[35:53] god said
[35:54] it just thrilled me he said
[35:56] the only thing that can draw the oil
[36:00] to the wick and make the light
[36:04] is the spirit himself
[36:07] amen so
[36:09] we're just going to fellowship
[36:11] we're going to kind of read some
[36:14] quotations out of the message
[36:17] sirs would we see jesus
[36:20] the one that was preached and let me see
[36:23] if i can get the date
[36:25] so the brothers can
[36:27] find it and um
[36:30] it's the one that's i believe is
[36:32] preached in phoenix
[36:34] uh
[36:36] yeah it's it knows the one that's
[36:38] preached in dallas texas
[36:41] 6
[36:42] 64
[36:44] 0304
[36:45] dallas texas we'll read some statements
[36:48] and just have a wonderful
[36:50] time of fellowship and the lord will try
[36:52] to move right on this evening
[36:54] 14th
[36:56] chapter the 16th birth
[36:58] i will pray the father
[37:01] and he shall give you another comforter
[37:06] that
[37:07] he may abide with you forever
[37:10] so he's going to provide something that
[37:14] will give us comfort now i'm going to
[37:17] approach this just
[37:18] from a little different
[37:20] viewpoint of it
[37:22] just being a feeling or a sensation
[37:26] or an anointing okay that is all
[37:30] still true that you feel the presence
[37:33] but there's i want to talk about another
[37:35] aspect
[37:37] of that and what we're talking about is
[37:40] seeing jesus
[37:41] isn't that what kind of the consensus
[37:44] was after the meeting everybody wants to
[37:47] see the lord
[37:48] visibly in our midst or tangibly in our
[37:51] midst well how are we going to do that i
[37:54] think brother brown really
[37:56] shows that to us in this message
[37:59] he says so he's going to give us a
[38:01] comfort
[38:03] even the spirit of truth
[38:05] whom the world cannot receive
[38:09] because it seeth him not
[38:13] so the world can't receive it because
[38:17] they can't see him
[38:19] they see it
[38:20] him not
[38:22] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[38:26] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[38:30] so if the world can't see it
[38:33] there is something that
[38:35] we're going to see
[38:38] okay so this is what he's saying as he
[38:40] unfolds the world can't see it they
[38:42] can't believe it but you will be able to
[38:46] see it
[38:47] by this comforter
[38:50] that i give you and what is the thing
[38:52] that we're supposed to do in this age
[38:54] what's one of the three things
[38:57] eyes have
[38:58] right that we might see gold tried and
[39:01] fire
[39:02] white raymond
[39:04] so
[39:05] so now we're we're just talking here
[39:07] about the eyes have something that god's
[39:10] going to give us in this age that allows
[39:13] us to see
[39:15] because that's what we're crying out for
[39:18] we want to see jesus we want to know
[39:20] god's in our midst we want to see him
[39:23] working well there's a way that
[39:26] that
[39:27] that it transpires
[39:29] and i i there's no way that
[39:32] uh in my infinite mind that i'll really
[39:35] be able to express it so if you let this
[39:38] comforter uh
[39:40] open it to you individually
[39:44] he says they don't know him but he shall
[39:46] be in you i will not leave you
[39:49] comfortless
[39:50] i will come to you
[39:53] so this is part of the comfort i'm
[39:56] trying to break away
[39:58] from the idea that the comforter is a
[40:01] one-time
[40:03] anointing
[40:05] or an experience that you say i've got
[40:08] the holy ghost
[40:10] well that's good because you have the
[40:13] holy ghost you should be able to see him
[40:17] when he comes without this spirit you
[40:20] won't be able to see him when he comes
[40:24] and remember that was the reason we
[40:27] wanted our lamps trimmed because he said
[40:30] if you
[40:31] if you don't have your lamps trim when
[40:33] he's at hand
[40:35] you won't see him
[40:37] i'm sorry to keep you going i should
[40:39] just read it but it it excites me
[40:43] a little while
[40:45] yet a little while and the world
[40:49] seeth me no more
[40:54] but ye see me
[40:57] because
[40:58] i live
[41:01] you see me
[41:02] because i live we a lot of times we just
[41:06] jump over to the ye shall live also
[41:09] but you're not seeing them because you
[41:12] shall live also you're seeing him
[41:14] because he what
[41:16] he lives so he's got to have a way that
[41:20] he lets you
[41:22] see him
[41:24] because the world can't
[41:26] but you can so you've got something in
[41:30] you that allows you to see him that they
[41:33] can't see
[41:34] okay so that's beautiful and ye shall
[41:37] live also amen lord bless his word
[41:41] you may be seated
[41:47] so this is just to encourage our faith
[41:50] because without
[41:52] faith we know it's
[41:54] impossible to please god
[41:57] and god was
[41:59] saying when i come to earth
[42:01] will i find faith now
[42:04] we're not talking about power
[42:07] or demonstration
[42:08] maybe i could put it in this context for
[42:13] tonight's service when i come to earth
[42:15] will i find people that can see me
[42:21] and recognize me
[42:23] and see what i'm doing
[42:26] and have i sab
[42:28] if that's what he's saying will i be
[42:30] able to find people that are in tune
[42:32] with me
[42:33] because i am going to come
[42:37] to promise i'll not leave you
[42:39] comfortless i will come again to you
[42:42] that now he's saying when i make that
[42:45] coming
[42:46] will there be a people
[42:49] that sees it
[42:54] or
[42:54] and if they they see it
[42:57] they believe it now the world can't
[42:59] believe it
[43:01] they see it
[43:02] or they see something
[43:04] but because they don't know what it is
[43:07] they disbelieve it and the minute you
[43:10] disbelieve it then your eyes are
[43:13] darkened
[43:14] and so
[43:16] so we're we're talking about
[43:19] our meetings
[43:21] and
[43:22] what it generated in us
[43:25] well what it generated in us was an
[43:28] enthusiasm
[43:30] and an excitement that god is going to
[43:33] be moving in our midst
[43:35] and the things that we were praying for
[43:38] the things that we are asking for are
[43:41] are we're anticipating to see those
[43:44] things coming to pass
[43:48] that's good i hate to live with no hope
[43:52] or no expectation
[43:55] or
[43:56] with a
[43:58] blinders on
[44:01] that when god come in or mixed
[44:04] we wouldn't
[44:05] recognize them
[44:07] and so
[44:08] we understand and this is what we want
[44:11] to just read and fellowship together
[44:14] that
[44:15] we want to seek god
[44:18] we want to see god we want to see the
[44:20] lord jesus made tangible
[44:23] in our midst
[44:26] so if it's tangible enough
[44:30] that
[44:31] it becomes
[44:33] reality to us
[44:36] in other words we can see it
[44:39] we can touch it
[44:42] we can know it
[44:44] and yet
[44:45] it still remains
[44:49] untangible
[44:51] to somebody else
[44:53] so we have seers
[44:56] and unseers
[44:59] i guess i guess that's a word
[45:02] and unseer the word for that i think is
[45:05] blind right
[45:08] so we have those that spiritually have
[45:10] what
[45:11] eyesight and then we have those that are
[45:14] blind who in other words got to do
[45:17] something
[45:19] in their midst because they cannot look
[45:23] to the unseen
[45:26] now remember that we're talking about
[45:30] because we're talking about he said i'm
[45:32] going to go away
[45:34] and the world they won't see me
[45:38] but i'm going to come to you
[45:41] in an
[45:42] unseen form
[45:47] i'm going to come in an unseen form so
[45:49] i'm going to be there
[45:51] and it's not going to be seen with the
[45:53] natural eye it's only going to be seen
[45:57] with
[45:58] the eye of revelation
[46:01] so in other words it it's not going to
[46:04] be
[46:05] anything that's generated
[46:09] within the natural part of man
[46:13] but god's going to supply
[46:16] a spirit
[46:20] or like some of these glasses that they
[46:23] have in the world that you can't see it
[46:26] and then you put the glasses on and it
[46:28] does something with the colors and then
[46:30] you see it so he's going to give you i
[46:33] sav
[46:36] that's going to make you
[46:39] to be able to see what is unseen
[46:44] so that's what you look to
[46:47] you look for an unseen
[46:51] present
[46:52] presence something that's not in the
[46:55] realms of seed taste touch smell feel
[46:58] or emotion
[47:01] it takes a what a sixth
[47:05] sense
[47:07] and that sense
[47:08] comes from
[47:10] revelation
[47:15] okay now we so many times
[47:19] think that revelation is a conclusion
[47:23] that we've drawn
[47:25] from our thought process
[47:30] the scriptures fall in line and and you
[47:33] get it and all of a sudden you say okay
[47:35] that that really looks i see that
[47:39] well
[47:40] just because you see your own conclusion
[47:42] doesn't mean it's a revelation
[47:46] a revelation is given because it's
[47:49] something that you can't see
[47:52] or understand in the natural
[47:57] now that's god's gift to you
[48:01] that's how he's going to give you
[48:03] comfort
[48:04] not by a sensation not by a run or shout
[48:09] well i'm going to give to you something
[48:12] that's going to allow you to see me when
[48:16] i come
[48:20] now we saw that manifested didn't we
[48:23] he's here
[48:27] oh
[48:28] wonderful
[48:29] so let's just walk through it for maybe
[48:31] the next 30 minutes and just lift our
[48:34] faith up because that's what we want to
[48:37] do is we want to see jesus
[48:40] so we want to know what are we looking
[48:43] for
[48:44] or
[48:45] how does he
[48:47] and so he comes
[48:50] god does everything by promise
[48:56] right so peter said it's by these
[48:58] exceedingly
[49:00] great and precious promises
[49:03] that we become partakers
[49:05] of divine nature
[49:09] so the ability
[49:12] and the grace and the mercy and the eye
[49:16] salve and the comfort that god is going
[49:20] to give you is to be able to
[49:23] understand
[49:25] that's what seeing means
[49:27] understand the way he works
[49:31] and the way he reveals himself
[49:35] because
[49:37] it's not
[49:39] if i i just don't know how to say this
[49:43] so correctly but it's not us
[49:48] anticipating
[49:51] a certain end
[49:54] and then calling that him
[49:59] okay in other words he could be there
[50:02] doing something and it not be what
[50:05] you're expecting
[50:09] you understand so in this message i
[50:12] can't go through at all
[50:13] but in this message and he speaks it
[50:17] in in also in in
[50:19] 63 and different places he said the
[50:22] reason they missed jesus is it wasn't
[50:26] what they expected
[50:31] right they already had a preconceived
[50:34] idea
[50:36] of
[50:39] what he was going to do
[50:41] so because they they they had a
[50:44] preconceived idea of what he was going
[50:46] to do or how he was going to do it or
[50:50] how he was going to come they missed it
[50:55] but how did he come he came exactly
[50:59] according to what
[51:02] he
[51:03] promised
[51:07] god is only seen
[51:11] in his promises
[51:14] you're not going to find him outside of
[51:16] his what
[51:18] word
[51:19] because he's revealed in his word
[51:23] he's
[51:25] so in other words you could see an
[51:27] outcome
[51:30] and not see him
[51:35] now pretend i'm invisible
[51:38] how many can do that
[51:42] terrible that we're so bound by eyesight
[51:44] right all right i'm invisible
[51:48] and
[51:54] you don't see me
[51:56] right
[51:58] but this car guitar moves from here
[52:04] to here
[52:11] now you see that the guitar moved
[52:15] but we just don't want to see
[52:17] that the guitar moves
[52:20] our revelation that we're looking for is
[52:23] what moved it
[52:25] how did it move
[52:27] what caused
[52:29] this
[52:30] result
[52:32] that's what spiritual isaf
[52:35] is going to give us
[52:38] right so if
[52:41] if i
[52:43] so if i
[52:44] promised you i was going to move that
[52:46] guitar
[52:47] from there to there
[52:50] there would have to be
[52:53] a way that you could
[52:55] recognize
[52:57] that it moved from there to there so
[53:01] why did it move from there to there not
[53:04] because i carried it or you saw me carry
[53:07] it but because i promised it
[53:16] so you could say how did that guitar get
[53:19] from there to there god promised it
[53:23] so when i find it there i know i saw him
[53:31] because you can only see him in his
[53:33] promises
[53:38] all right so let's talk about
[53:40] some of the fathers of our faith
[53:44] noah
[53:46] noah didn't need to see rain
[53:50] to know that he had spoken to god
[53:58] you understand
[53:59] in other words god
[54:01] promised him it was going to rain he
[54:03] knew he spoke to god
[54:07] he didn't need to see rain to know that
[54:10] he spoke to god
[54:16] he didn't need that
[54:18] he knew he spoke to god
[54:21] he knew what that that conversation that
[54:25] he had with god was real
[54:29] so he knew
[54:31] that and i don't know what no one knew
[54:34] or how it was going to flood or it's
[54:36] going to rain or what his conception of
[54:38] rain was but when it rained
[54:41] noah
[54:43] saw
[54:44] god
[54:46] in
[54:47] the rain
[54:52] he saw the hand of god
[54:54] he saw god moving so it was a promise no
[54:58] one knew that he saw but when he saw the
[55:01] rain
[55:02] now god became tangible in the rain he
[55:06] could sit in the rain and say this
[55:09] is god i'm touching i'm feeling i'm
[55:13] seeing god
[55:17] because god revealed in his word why is
[55:20] that important to us
[55:21] because if we know the promises
[55:26] then that's where we look for him
[55:31] we look for him in his promises we look
[55:34] for him to become tangible
[55:36] in his word
[55:39] amen
[55:41] abraham
[55:43] didn't need to see a change in sarah
[55:46] to know he talked to god
[55:53] i i imagine he had all kinds of
[55:55] imaginations how it was going to come to
[55:58] pass
[56:00] in fact he even tried sarah's program
[56:08] right
[56:09] maybe this work and so
[56:12] in one sense
[56:14] we come up with ways for god
[56:18] to do things
[56:19] okay
[56:20] but this is our comfort
[56:24] a little while the world won't see me
[56:27] but you shall see me
[56:32] because i go to the father and
[56:35] he he will lead you and guide you into
[56:38] all righteousness you shall see me
[56:41] because i live in other words the
[56:43] comfort is that god is going to open
[56:49] the eyes and the heart of his elected to
[56:54] see him when he is
[56:57] manifesting himself in the fulfillment
[57:01] of the word
[57:05] that's my comfort
[57:09] in others i don't have to figure out how
[57:11] he's going to do it
[57:13] but he promised me
[57:16] that he would let me
[57:18] see him
[57:22] in the fulfillment of his promise
[57:29] to riot
[57:30] so mary didn't need
[57:33] to
[57:34] talk to be with a man she didn't need to
[57:38] have anything she she said i'm not
[57:40] having him in with any man she said that
[57:43] what shall
[57:44] be conceived in you shall be of the holy
[57:46] spirit
[57:50] she didn't need anything
[57:52] she said let it be done according to thy
[57:56] word
[57:57] so when it transpired in her
[58:02] she knew that she'd seen
[58:04] god
[58:08] god is going to take the imagination
[58:12] away from us
[58:14] when we know how
[58:16] to see him
[58:21] he he brings
[58:24] god interprets his word by what
[58:27] bringing
[58:28] it
[58:29] to pass
[58:33] that's how he interprets his word so
[58:36] that how he interprets a promise to you
[58:41] is by bringing it to pass and what he
[58:45] allows you to see
[58:47] is him
[58:49] bringing it to pass
[58:51] not according to your
[58:55] understanding
[58:56] or not according to your expectation
[59:00] what the promise is you shall see me
[59:06] because i live
[59:08] you'll see me
[59:10] because i keep my word
[59:13] you shall see me because i interpret my
[59:17] word and bring it to pass
[59:20] because you are my elected because you
[59:23] are my chosen because you have i sav
[59:27] because the comforter came to you
[59:31] and put a pair of spiritual glasses on
[59:33] you you shall see
[59:38] me
[59:39] when i'm there
[59:42] fulfilling
[59:44] the word
[59:46] think of that
[59:50] so
[59:51] we've got a promise
[59:53] so when we see these great and precious
[59:56] promises to coming to pass we can see
[59:59] god
[1:00:00] let's just read a few statements and
[1:00:03] and
[1:00:04] and because
[1:00:07] that's what we want to see he's seen in
[1:00:09] the fulfillment of what he promised
[1:00:15] right
[1:00:16] so you know what he promised
[1:00:20] when you
[1:00:21] when you ask for something
[1:00:24] and when it comes to pass you know it's
[1:00:27] him
[1:00:30] right you say oh this i i
[1:00:32] i read this promise
[1:00:35] and i believed it
[1:00:37] and i'm looking in expectation
[1:00:41] for this to come to pass
[1:00:43] you see
[1:00:45] we look for
[1:00:47] the specific
[1:00:49] manner
[1:00:52] but that's hid from the wise and prudent
[1:00:57] what's revealed
[1:00:59] is how he brings even what you asked for
[1:01:03] to pass according to his divine will
[1:01:10] he never just does it to do it
[1:01:15] prophet of god says god's got a purpose
[1:01:17] in everything he does he has a purpose
[1:01:21] in healing you
[1:01:27] just think of that
[1:01:28] it's not just a blanket god's a healer
[1:01:32] i get well
[1:01:33] you can get well and still miss god
[1:01:41] you want to know why what's what's
[1:01:44] coming to pass i want to see him
[1:01:49] i'm not looking for a
[1:01:52] a prescription
[1:01:54] promise
[1:01:58] or a letter promise
[1:02:00] i'm not looking for me to take an
[1:02:02] experience that i have and then go find
[1:02:06] a scripture or a saying
[1:02:09] to attach that feeling or experience to
[1:02:16] we're moving up
[1:02:20] these are sons and daughters of god now
[1:02:24] who are walking in the promises of god
[1:02:27] who only are looking for him in his word
[1:02:31] not looking for him in emotion not
[1:02:33] looking for him in experience they're
[1:02:36] looking to what did he say
[1:02:39] would transpire in my age he send me a
[1:02:43] comforter that's going to let me witness
[1:02:46] it
[1:02:51] so i'm not testing myself
[1:02:58] i don't create a test
[1:03:01] of my faith
[1:03:08] all right if i don't get healed by
[1:03:09] december 22nd
[1:03:13] no
[1:03:15] no
[1:03:16] no
[1:03:18] i got a promise
[1:03:20] god promised me that i would see it
[1:03:23] when it happened
[1:03:25] and no it's him
[1:03:29] did noah need reigns
[1:03:33] did abraham need to change in sarah
[1:03:36] did mary need any type of experience
[1:03:39] prophet of god said she believed the
[1:03:41] word of god without one single sensation
[1:03:46] or seeing any sign
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:50] of it whatsoever
[1:03:55] she wasn't looking for a program
[1:03:58] she was looking for the comforter
[1:04:02] the spirit's promise
[1:04:06] to us
[1:04:08] that when he brings it to pass
[1:04:10] you would see it
[1:04:16] that's the comfort that we have
[1:04:23] that's the comfort he's not going to
[1:04:26] leave me out
[1:04:28] i call you friends
[1:04:31] because a friend knoweth
[1:04:34] what he does i didn't quote that
[1:04:36] scripture
[1:04:37] very well but that's the scripture that
[1:04:39] that we understand what he's saying
[1:04:42] you're going to see me when i come
[1:04:46] and fulfill
[1:04:48] my word amen
[1:04:51] sirs we would see jesus
[1:04:53] what did jesus point him to
[1:04:55] when he came and they asked him
[1:04:59] he pointed them to a promise
[1:05:02] that was going to be fulfilled
[1:05:05] and if they could see it that's where
[1:05:08] they would see him because he only shows
[1:05:12] himself in his promises
[1:05:16] we don't have to make the promise come
[1:05:19] to pass
[1:05:23] now i'm going to read a few things
[1:05:26] because a lot of people get confused
[1:05:29] about healing
[1:05:30] but
[1:05:33] this is what he says
[1:05:36] this is paragraph 11
[1:05:39] on page two
[1:05:41] of sirs where we see jesus
[1:05:44] he says now healing
[1:05:47] is of god alone
[1:05:50] can can we find that and put it on the
[1:05:52] board
[1:05:54] um
[1:05:57] i don't know if the date helps you or or
[1:05:59] not but
[1:06:04] what happened
[1:06:09] okay we got crashed software
[1:06:14] it don't matter
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:19] you can go home and read it yourself
[1:06:22] and i'm not a very good reader but you
[1:06:24] read it yourself and now healing is of
[1:06:26] god alone
[1:06:28] god alone
[1:06:31] has purchased
[1:06:33] for us our healing
[1:06:37] now
[1:06:39] we don't know how
[1:06:42] but he purchased it
[1:06:47] now listen to our part
[1:06:50] it's up to us to do everything that we
[1:06:55] can
[1:06:56] in our life
[1:06:59] and in every way
[1:07:01] that god has given us
[1:07:04] for our healing
[1:07:08] people put themselves in a test
[1:07:12] if i take medicine i don't believe it if
[1:07:15] if i go get an operation
[1:07:18] he said do everything that you can
[1:07:24] okay why
[1:07:26] because when he comes
[1:07:30] you understand
[1:07:31] and performs it
[1:07:34] he promised you that you would see
[1:07:40] it that you would see it's him
[1:07:48] you do everything that you can to have a
[1:07:50] child you do everything that you can to
[1:07:52] get better you take everything that man
[1:07:55] has got to offer
[1:07:56] but when god comes
[1:07:59] and does the work
[1:08:01] according to his promise
[1:08:04] he promised that you would have
[1:08:06] something in you
[1:08:08] that could see it
[1:08:12] oh that's maturity
[1:08:17] you're not setting yourself up for
[1:08:19] failure
[1:08:22] you're not
[1:08:23] you're not saying if i had faith i
[1:08:26] wouldn't take this medicine because god
[1:08:29] healed me no
[1:08:31] when god heals you he promised you he'd
[1:08:34] let you know
[1:08:39] you don't need
[1:08:41] to see anything
[1:08:44] when you believe that god healed you
[1:08:48] i just don't want to miss it when he
[1:08:50] does it the way he does it amen
[1:08:54] am i making myself clear
[1:08:57] okay
[1:09:00] he said
[1:09:02] but it's god that heals
[1:09:04] if god calls you to go home tonight
[1:09:08] there isn't enough medicine in the world
[1:09:11] that will keep you here
[1:09:14] there is nothing going to keep you here
[1:09:18] and if he determines
[1:09:21] you to stay on earth
[1:09:24] no matter how many physicians say you're
[1:09:27] going tonight you're not going
[1:09:32] so it's just all
[1:09:35] up
[1:09:36] to
[1:09:37] god
[1:09:39] hallelujah
[1:09:40] so my quest
[1:09:43] isn't what god's gonna do
[1:09:46] or what's up to god or how that he's
[1:09:49] going to do it i just want to see him
[1:09:52] when he does it
[1:09:58] and how am i going to do that i can
[1:10:01] identify it by the
[1:10:04] word
[1:10:06] oh
[1:10:08] if we could get
[1:10:09] as simple
[1:10:11] brother abraham talks about why god
[1:10:13] wrote the bible just the way he wrote it
[1:10:16] just the way he said it
[1:10:19] so let's just
[1:10:21] go on
[1:10:22] god is life
[1:10:24] life eternal in the beginning was god
[1:10:27] he wasn't god at first
[1:10:32] he wasn't god
[1:10:33] at that time
[1:10:36] because god in the english word god
[1:10:38] means object to worship and there wasn't
[1:10:41] nothing to worship him
[1:10:43] he was the eternal just the eternal one
[1:10:47] there was no moon
[1:10:48] no stars no angels no nothing
[1:10:52] but in the beginning
[1:10:54] that we call
[1:10:56] god our father was attributes and in him
[1:11:00] was attributes to be father in him was
[1:11:02] attributes to be god in him was
[1:11:05] attributes to be son
[1:11:07] in him it was attributes to be savior in
[1:11:10] him it was attributes to be
[1:11:12] a healer and all these things that we
[1:11:15] see now
[1:11:16] is just displaying his attributes
[1:11:20] so what are we seeing
[1:11:23] we're seeing it come to pass
[1:11:27] the moon the stars in this
[1:11:30] is what
[1:11:31] god being father creator that attribute
[1:11:34] coming to pass
[1:11:36] so we see it as
[1:11:38] god because we have the promise
[1:11:42] and the comforter
[1:11:45] and the isab
[1:11:46] the world jesus is what
[1:11:49] science
[1:11:52] poor people
[1:11:54] they can't see god
[1:11:56] but god gave you a comfort
[1:12:00] that when you look at it you see god
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:04] when they look at it they see some latin
[1:12:07] name and try to figure out how far away
[1:12:09] it is
[1:12:11] remember the little boy in the boat
[1:12:14] we're just going to go through this
[1:12:15] quickly
[1:12:17] all these are sermons within themselves
[1:12:19] now if you were in his thinking
[1:12:22] at the beginning
[1:12:25] if you've got eternal life
[1:12:28] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:12:30] eternal life had
[1:12:33] no beginning
[1:12:35] had no end
[1:12:36] so if you have eternal life you were an
[1:12:39] attribute of god's thinking
[1:12:42] before there was anything but him
[1:12:48] okay so if that's all true
[1:12:52] and he knows what his thoughts were
[1:12:54] towards you
[1:12:55] he knows what
[1:12:57] your determined end is
[1:13:00] we're not worried about that
[1:13:05] you understand that's not what we're
[1:13:07] looking for
[1:13:10] we're looking to see him present tense
[1:13:14] in our midst
[1:13:17] fulfilling his promises and his word
[1:13:23] we're laying to rest
[1:13:26] our future
[1:13:29] because that way we're trying to see him
[1:13:32] in the future
[1:13:34] or we're trying to see him
[1:13:37] in the past
[1:13:38] but we're missing what he's doing what
[1:13:41] now
[1:13:43] i want to see him now so we know
[1:13:47] that he is
[1:13:49] in our midst
[1:13:51] fulfilling
[1:13:53] everything that he promised to do
[1:13:57] he's moving the guitar
[1:14:01] okay my prayer is
[1:14:04] and my promise is
[1:14:07] that the comforter
[1:14:09] will let me see
[1:14:11] that the guitar has been moved according
[1:14:14] to his
[1:14:16] word
[1:14:17] and i recognize it
[1:14:19] as
[1:14:21] god
[1:14:25] so if we're going to start looking for
[1:14:27] him where are we going to look for him
[1:14:31] in his word
[1:14:32] in his promised word
[1:14:34] we're not we're not creating a situation
[1:14:39] that he has to come
[1:14:41] according to
[1:14:43] your
[1:14:45] specifications
[1:14:49] and then
[1:14:51] call it god
[1:14:57] we don't have to do a thing
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:03] he said pray for isaac
[1:15:06] that thou mayest see
[1:15:12] were we able to get something there
[1:15:15] okay now let's read paragraph 14.
[1:15:19] your form
[1:15:21] your shape
[1:15:23] and what
[1:15:25] you're
[1:15:26] in now
[1:15:29] your form your shape what you're in now
[1:15:33] is just
[1:15:34] a negative
[1:15:37] when you come up
[1:15:39] to around 20 22 years old
[1:15:44] you were
[1:15:45] a negative
[1:15:47] and death develops the picture
[1:15:51] to the positive
[1:15:53] oh
[1:15:54] man
[1:15:58] this is just a negative
[1:16:02] right a negative's like you know you
[1:16:03] have a telephone pole and the light
[1:16:06] shining on the pole and you've got the
[1:16:08] shadow
[1:16:09] he said the shadow's the negative the
[1:16:11] shadow tells you there's a telephone
[1:16:14] pole
[1:16:15] somewhere
[1:16:19] okay so he's saying that this is just a
[1:16:23] negative so this is telling us there's a
[1:16:25] body somewhere
[1:16:27] well what develops the negative is death
[1:16:32] we're not afraid of death
[1:16:34] all's death for us is is
[1:16:38] if we were to go that way is a promise
[1:16:40] being fulfilled
[1:16:45] oh
[1:16:46] death where's your sting oh grave
[1:16:50] where's your victory i have a crown laid
[1:16:52] up for me
[1:16:55] oh that's beautiful isn't it
[1:16:59] that's when this earthly tabernacle be
[1:17:02] dissolved we have one all
[1:17:05] ready waiting
[1:17:09] so you see the things that were taking
[1:17:11] off the table
[1:17:15] to worry about
[1:17:18] to look for
[1:17:21] we know the rapture will come
[1:17:24] we know we'll be a part of it
[1:17:27] we know our names are written on the
[1:17:29] lamp book of life
[1:17:30] we're looking for his soon appearing
[1:17:35] but we want to see him
[1:17:37] tangible
[1:17:39] in our midst
[1:17:41] we want to see him fulfilling
[1:17:44] all the prophecies and signs that he's
[1:17:47] spoken about us
[1:17:52] and about what he promised
[1:17:58] that's
[1:17:59] the comforter promised us
[1:18:02] that we would see
[1:18:04] i will come again
[1:18:06] and you
[1:18:07] shall
[1:18:08] see me
[1:18:10] i will send you the comforter
[1:18:12] he will not leave you comfortless
[1:18:16] but i will come again
[1:18:18] and you shall see me
[1:18:26] that's all i'm looking for
[1:18:28] i'm looking for
[1:18:30] him to reveal
[1:18:32] himself
[1:18:33] performing his word
[1:18:36] in the hour
[1:18:37] i'm
[1:18:38] living
[1:18:40] just a few more statements and we'll
[1:18:42] close this evening
[1:18:45] this
[1:18:47] he says
[1:18:48] this
[1:18:50] just the display
[1:18:53] now it shows
[1:18:56] what's being
[1:18:58] done
[1:19:01] like god becoming god when he created
[1:19:04] angels
[1:19:06] so he's showing what's being done
[1:19:09] okay i i hope that i can only read it
[1:19:12] and hope that it comes to your heart
[1:19:16] he become son when he created jesus
[1:19:19] christ
[1:19:21] he becomes savior when jesus died
[1:19:25] he become healer when he was wounded for
[1:19:28] our transgressions with his stripes we
[1:19:31] were healed
[1:19:33] see
[1:19:34] he you see what he's doing he's doing
[1:19:37] all these things he's fulfilling his
[1:19:39] word
[1:19:40] he said
[1:19:42] all these things are attributes of god
[1:19:45] just so that in
[1:19:48] the end the bible says jesus said you
[1:19:53] will know that i am in
[1:19:57] that i am in the father and the father
[1:20:01] in me
[1:20:02] and i in you
[1:20:04] and you and me that's god becoming
[1:20:09] tangible that's how you know he's
[1:20:11] tangible because you see him
[1:20:16] in what he promised
[1:20:18] now all of you are a strong enough
[1:20:20] message to believers to take this right
[1:20:23] to malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. revelations
[1:20:27] 10 7.
[1:20:29] thank you all right
[1:20:30] we've seen god fulfill his word
[1:20:33] that was god be tangible
[1:20:36] but along with that
[1:20:39] there's many other personal promises in
[1:20:42] your life where he becomes personal to
[1:20:46] you
[1:20:47] and you see him
[1:20:51] it's god becoming tangible
[1:20:54] your own wife
[1:20:56] you and your husband
[1:20:58] is just a shadow a negative
[1:21:02] of god and his wife the church
[1:21:07] see it's just god's attributes being
[1:21:10] displayed
[1:21:12] in shadows and types
[1:21:14] like the old
[1:21:16] testament in the new testament
[1:21:18] then in the end it all winds up god
[1:21:22] tangible
[1:21:24] god in christ
[1:21:26] tangible made flesh
[1:21:30] dwelt among us
[1:21:31] and in the great millennium to come
[1:21:34] god
[1:21:35] in the form of christ
[1:21:38] sits upon the throne of david and the
[1:21:40] church his bride husband and wife
[1:21:42] together
[1:21:43] why
[1:21:45] it's the
[1:21:46] most
[1:21:47] it's enough to set your heart of the
[1:21:49] believer on fire
[1:21:52] in these great hours
[1:21:54] that we're living in when all hope
[1:21:58] and nations and everything else is
[1:22:01] crumbling
[1:22:03] on us
[1:22:04] under us
[1:22:05] we got a kingdom that we are
[1:22:08] baptized into
[1:22:11] this
[1:22:12] kingdom
[1:22:15] so what do you have
[1:22:18] now
[1:22:19] can you imagine
[1:22:20] not seeing this world crumbling apart
[1:22:26] that all your hope is in buildback
[1:22:28] better
[1:22:30] or the great new deal
[1:22:33] or the great society
[1:22:38] many more things can we
[1:22:41] talk about
[1:22:44] that everybody's promising us it'll get
[1:22:47] better
[1:22:50] wait a minute
[1:22:53] it don't matter
[1:22:54] if it gets better
[1:22:56] because my comforter is going to let me
[1:23:00] see
[1:23:01] when he's here
[1:23:06] i will come again
[1:23:07] the comforter is going to let me see
[1:23:11] his appearing
[1:23:14] it's going to open my eyes that i see
[1:23:17] i see him i see it i see him in the
[1:23:22] failure of the world
[1:23:25] i see him i see his word i see him
[1:23:29] it doesn't matter what anybody promises
[1:23:32] we say this but let me see
[1:23:34] jesus
[1:23:36] how do i see him
[1:23:41] in the fulfilling of his word
[1:23:44] that's what i want to see
[1:23:48] let me see
[1:23:49] the promise
[1:23:53] and then let me see you
[1:23:55] fulfilling that promise
[1:23:58] that's what makes them tangible
[1:24:01] how many believe god's doing all kinds
[1:24:03] of things
[1:24:05] so that's why he counseled us by of me i
[1:24:09] sav that thou mayest what see
[1:24:13] pray for revelation pray for sight
[1:24:17] not for theology
[1:24:21] not for a greater vocabulary
[1:24:24] to express and understand the mysteries
[1:24:28] but to literally see him
[1:24:31] fulfilling his promise
[1:24:35] then you can say
[1:24:37] that
[1:24:38] is god
[1:24:41] that's him
[1:24:42] i've seen them tangibly
[1:24:45] the world don't see it
[1:24:49] they have nothing in them to see it with
[1:24:53] but you have something to see it with
[1:24:55] why because he gave you
[1:25:01] the eyes to see
[1:25:04] glory
[1:25:05] paragraph 20.
[1:25:08] now i'm sure to any believer
[1:25:10] it would be the most thrilling thing in
[1:25:13] his heart
[1:25:14] a confirmation of his faith
[1:25:18] that if he could actually see
[1:25:22] and know
[1:25:23] that he was standing in the presence of
[1:25:27] jesus christ
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:31] that's what thrills our heart
[1:25:33] that we're actually standing in the
[1:25:35] presence of jesus christ so
[1:25:38] he now we're looking to the unseen right
[1:25:42] i haven't lost my mind have i
[1:25:44] okay so if you see that guitar
[1:25:50] go from there to there
[1:25:55] you're standing in the presence
[1:26:01] of jesus christ
[1:26:03] if that was the promised
[1:26:06] word
[1:26:09] the world don't see it
[1:26:12] they don't feel it
[1:26:14] but how do you know it's him
[1:26:18] because he gave you something to see it
[1:26:21] with
[1:26:22] that's your comfort
[1:26:24] i see it
[1:26:26] i see him bringing it to pass i see the
[1:26:29] word i see malachi 4 5. you know why you
[1:26:32] see malachi 4 5 the comforter let you
[1:26:35] see it
[1:26:36] he promised that you would see him when
[1:26:39] he came
[1:26:42] and all the other scriptures luke 17 30
[1:26:46] and those great scriptures
[1:26:48] they met
[1:26:49] i think it would be the most astonishing
[1:26:52] thing
[1:26:53] that any person any believer could think
[1:26:56] of
[1:26:57] is
[1:26:58] to know
[1:26:59] and no positive
[1:27:02] that keeps standing right in the
[1:27:05] presence of the lord
[1:27:07] jesus christ his solemn judge his
[1:27:11] redeemer
[1:27:12] and will be his judge
[1:27:14] at the end of judgment
[1:27:18] and let's just go turn if we can
[1:27:21] now
[1:27:22] in
[1:27:23] in closing
[1:27:26] over to
[1:27:29] paragraph 99
[1:27:35] he says but notice
[1:27:38] he only comes to those who are looking
[1:27:41] for him
[1:27:44] he will only heal tonight those who are
[1:27:47] looking for him to heal
[1:27:51] he will only save those who are looking
[1:27:55] to be
[1:27:56] saved
[1:28:01] he's only looking
[1:28:03] he's only the only ones that are going
[1:28:05] to see him are those who are looking for
[1:28:08] the fulfillment
[1:28:10] of the promise
[1:28:14] they're not giving god a plan a
[1:28:16] fulfillment plan
[1:28:19] everybody wants to give you a retirement
[1:28:21] plan
[1:28:23] everybody wants to tell you how to
[1:28:24] invest your money
[1:28:26] everybody's got a program
[1:28:28] god's got one program that's his word
[1:28:32] now let me say this over and over again
[1:28:35] because i want you to know where your
[1:28:37] comfort is
[1:28:38] your comfort is that he promised
[1:28:42] to let you
[1:28:44] see it
[1:28:50] you're not going to miss it
[1:28:53] my sheep hear my voice another they will
[1:28:56] not follow all that the father hath
[1:28:58] given me will come
[1:29:02] that's what takes all the big eyes and
[1:29:04] the little yous out of it
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:08] you're a part of what he's doing
[1:29:11] by him showing you that his words coming
[1:29:15] to pass don't you don't have to look for
[1:29:17] some kind of work to go do
[1:29:21] all you do is look for the promise
[1:29:24] when we pray for somebody
[1:29:27] we pray for somebody under one
[1:29:30] auspices only
[1:29:33] he said
[1:29:34] if we lay our hands on the sick they
[1:29:37] shall recover
[1:29:38] what do we do we lay our hands on the
[1:29:41] sith
[1:29:43] we don't give them a date
[1:29:47] we don't give them a method
[1:29:50] we don't give them the circumstance in
[1:29:52] which we can see and understand
[1:29:56] we know one thing and one thing only we
[1:30:00] fulfill the word
[1:30:01] when he brings that word to pass he's
[1:30:04] going to let us see it amen
[1:30:07] hallelujah
[1:30:09] and we're going to praise him for it
[1:30:14] satan is the author of confusion
[1:30:20] he keeps wanting to get us to have a
[1:30:22] part of it
[1:30:24] our only comfort is
[1:30:27] he said he would come
[1:30:29] to fulfill his word
[1:30:31] and he told me i would see it
[1:30:36] so i can what
[1:30:38] wait on him and
[1:30:40] rest
[1:30:43] let's just go
[1:30:44] and then
[1:30:46] read these last few paragraphs
[1:30:49] and
[1:30:50] it's beautiful and i hope this all
[1:30:53] lays it out paragraph 110 he's telling
[1:30:57] the story of the woman at the well
[1:31:00] so we know the message he's saying would
[1:31:02] you want to see jesus
[1:31:05] so now he's going to tell them this is
[1:31:07] promised in the last day the son of man
[1:31:10] so if you're going to see him you're
[1:31:12] going to see him fulfilling
[1:31:15] what he promised
[1:31:18] and the son of man ministry was promised
[1:31:21] for our day
[1:31:22] so they're sitting there
[1:31:25] we weren't there
[1:31:28] we some of us were born
[1:31:31] some of us weren't
[1:31:33] but it wasn't the promise that we would
[1:31:36] have to see him
[1:31:38] then
[1:31:40] the promise was we would see him where
[1:31:43] we are
[1:31:48] every word that pertains to you
[1:31:51] god is going to let you see
[1:32:00] so pick a promise
[1:32:02] your children
[1:32:04] god's going to let me see it come to
[1:32:06] pass
[1:32:07] when how i not my problem wasn't
[1:32:10] abraham's problem abraham didn't need to
[1:32:12] see and change in sarah to know that god
[1:32:15] spoke to him
[1:32:19] he built baby furniture
[1:32:21] he testified
[1:32:23] oh sarah how do you feel
[1:32:26] praise god
[1:32:28] i know god spoke to me i know he's going
[1:32:30] to let me see it

[1:32:41] paragraph 110 he said
[1:32:45] you have said right
[1:32:46] you have had
[1:32:48] five
[1:32:49] and the one you're living with now is
[1:32:53] not yours
[1:32:54] now what is god doing
[1:32:57] he's letting
[1:32:59] her
[1:33:00] see
[1:33:01] the
[1:33:02] messiah
[1:33:08] that's

[1:33:15] today
[1:33:17] however you're fulfilling your word
[1:33:19] not going to worry about tomorrow
[1:33:22] the evil of today is sufficient
[1:33:25] i want to see you
[1:33:28] i promise to see you
[1:33:34] now watch this woman notice
[1:33:37] and her
[1:33:38] in that condition
[1:33:42] i'm
[1:33:43] i'm staying too long too long
[1:33:46] her in that condition
[1:33:49] knowed more about the real
[1:33:52] bible
[1:33:57] the real bible
[1:34:00] the real bible is jesus bringing his
[1:34:04] promises to pass and his elect seeing it
[1:34:08] that's the real bible this book blinds
[1:34:12] people
[1:34:14] but his spirit
[1:34:18] right
[1:34:20] because i live
[1:34:22] you shall live also
[1:34:24] in other words what are you living in
[1:34:27] you're living in the present
[1:34:29] reality
[1:34:31] of seeing jesus fulfill his word and
[1:34:35] giving you eyes out
[1:34:42] no more about the real bible than a big
[1:34:44] bunch of preachers does today
[1:34:47] as soon
[1:34:49] as he sees she might have thought
[1:34:53] that it was just a man seeing her
[1:34:56] condition
[1:34:58] she wanted wanted to get smart with him
[1:35:01] or something
[1:35:02] and she said i have no husband
[1:35:06] he said that's also right
[1:35:08] you've had five
[1:35:10] and the one you're with now is not your
[1:35:13] husband
[1:35:14] quickly
[1:35:16] that predestinated seed laying in her
[1:35:20] heart caught fire
[1:35:26] hasn't your
[1:35:27] seat caught fire
[1:35:30] right now watch this story
[1:35:33] okay the predestinations caught fire
[1:35:36] she turned and said sir i perceive that
[1:35:38] thou art a prophet
[1:35:41] we ain't had one for 400 years you know
[1:35:46] we know oh dallas
[1:35:49] don't miss this
[1:35:53] we know
[1:35:54] we're looking for a messiah
[1:35:59] who is called the christ
[1:36:02] and when he comes
[1:36:04] this is what
[1:36:06] he is going to do
[1:36:09] this will be a sign
[1:36:11] jesus said
[1:36:13] i am he
[1:36:15] that speaks to you
[1:36:17] what did he do
[1:36:19] for that predestinated seed
[1:36:22] let
[1:36:23] them
[1:36:24] see
[1:36:26] who
[1:36:27] it was
[1:36:28] fulfilling his word
[1:36:31] sirs we would see jesus
[1:36:34] we can say that today
[1:36:36] sirs
[1:36:39] or
[1:36:40] everybody in here
[1:36:43] we are promised
[1:36:44] that we would see jesus
[1:36:47] sirs
[1:36:48] we
[1:36:51] would see jesus
[1:36:53] how about if i took the word wood and
[1:36:56] put the word will.
[1:36:59] sirs brethren elected
[1:37:03] predestinated we will
[1:37:05] see jesus
[1:37:07] tangible
[1:37:08] in our hour
[1:37:18] i am he that speak it with you
[1:37:22] upon that
[1:37:23] she dropped the water pot and into the
[1:37:26] city she went
[1:37:27] said come see a man who told me what
[1:37:30] i've done
[1:37:32] isn't this the very messiah
[1:37:35] and the bible said that they believed
[1:37:37] jesus because what the woman said
[1:37:41] now that's
[1:37:44] the way
[1:37:45] he identifies himself
[1:37:48] as being messiah
[1:37:51] not because of the way he dressed
[1:37:56] by his education
[1:37:58] by the fellowship card
[1:38:00] or by his honor among men
[1:38:05] god was in him
[1:38:08] manifesting
[1:38:09] the word
[1:38:11] that
[1:38:12] he
[1:38:13] promised
[1:38:18] you can't see him without a promise
[1:38:23] you can't look for him
[1:38:25] unless you believe the promise
[1:38:28] and if you believe the promise
[1:38:30] all you have to do is wait
[1:38:33] because he promised he would let you see
[1:38:36] it
[1:38:37] come to pass
[1:38:42] that is beautiful
[1:38:45] he promised
[1:38:47] he would let you see it
[1:38:49] come to pass
[1:38:51] abraham
[1:38:53] believed god
[1:38:55] and believed god was able to perform
[1:38:58] that which he promised
[1:39:01] mary
[1:39:02] believed god
[1:39:04] and believed god was able to perform
[1:39:07] that which he promised
[1:39:09] abraham
[1:39:10] i mean noah believed god
[1:39:14] and did everything according to his
[1:39:16] instructions because he knew god would
[1:39:19] let him see it
[1:39:21] come to pass
[1:39:23] that's our comfort
[1:39:26] don't judge yourself
[1:39:35] look
[1:39:39] he preached that you know
[1:39:44] look and see
[1:39:47] you've got a promise
[1:39:49] let's just close
[1:39:52] down he said in john 5
[1:39:56] 39 search the scriptures
[1:39:58] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:40:00] life but they are are that testify or
[1:40:04] tell you
[1:40:06] who
[1:40:07] i am
[1:40:10] okay the promises tells you who he is
[1:40:16] so that's how you know who he is
[1:40:21] same yesterday today and forever my
[1:40:23] brother my sister
[1:40:25] you're a lovely audience
[1:40:28] you could talk all night
[1:40:31] you see what jesus was then
[1:40:35] he was manifested
[1:40:37] he was god manifested in a man
[1:40:40] called jesus christ
[1:40:42] which is the son of god
[1:40:44] promising
[1:40:46] as it was in the days of noah
[1:40:50] every other
[1:40:52] sense
[1:40:54] said exactly
[1:40:56] so shall it
[1:40:58] be
[1:40:59] at the coming
[1:41:00] of the son of man
[1:41:03] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:41:06] forever old church
[1:41:08] don't
[1:41:10] is does that stare
[1:41:13] but believe
[1:41:14] on the lord jesus christ sirs
[1:41:18] we would see jesus
[1:41:20] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:41:22] forever
[1:41:24] would you like to see him
[1:41:28] sir
[1:41:29] how
[1:41:30] would you look for him
[1:41:34] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:41:36] forever he'll do
[1:41:39] the same
[1:41:41] no man could come
[1:41:43] up here
[1:41:45] he said now a man could come up here
[1:41:49] with nail scars in his hands
[1:41:52] blood and smoke and oil running out of
[1:41:55] them
[1:41:57] that
[1:41:58] wouldn't make it any hypocrite
[1:42:01] can do that certainly
[1:42:04] but what
[1:42:05] it is
[1:42:07] is the manifestation
[1:42:09] of this
[1:42:11] promised
[1:42:12] word
[1:42:16] that's what we want to see
[1:42:21] he was god anointed prophet
[1:42:24] he was he was
[1:42:26] the god prophet
[1:42:29] he was what all the prophets was
[1:42:32] it was in him
[1:42:34] plus the rest of what god was
[1:42:37] god was in christ reconciling himself to
[1:42:41] the world he was god emmanuel
[1:42:44] the fullness of the god
[1:42:47] made known to us
[1:42:49] in
[1:42:50] the
[1:42:51] person
[1:42:53] of his son jesus christ the second
[1:42:57] attribute
[1:42:59] of god
[1:43:04] the second attribute of god
[1:43:09] that's a statement
[1:43:11] so what was the first attribute of god
[1:43:15] god himself amen
[1:43:19] in the beginning was the word
[1:43:23] right
[1:43:24] and the word
[1:43:25] was with god
[1:43:27] and the word was god and the second
[1:43:30] attribute
[1:43:32] was that word
[1:43:34] being manifested
[1:43:42] the first attribute
[1:43:44] was all that god was
[1:43:47] the second attribute was the expression
[1:43:50] of all that god was
[1:43:56] that would be a wonderful sermon
[1:43:58] wouldn't it
[1:43:59] but i just believe it
[1:44:02] now notice he's alive today
[1:44:05] he is not dead
[1:44:08] he is alive
[1:44:10] he said a little while
[1:44:12] and the world cosmos the world order
[1:44:16] will
[1:44:17] see me
[1:44:19] it's double e
[1:44:20] see
[1:44:22] me
[1:44:24] no
[1:44:25] more
[1:44:27] yet ye shall see me
[1:44:30] for i
[1:44:32] is a personal pronoun i will be with you
[1:44:35] even in you till the end of the world
[1:44:39] and at the end of the world when these
[1:44:42] scriptures is to be fulfilled
[1:44:47] what are you going to do
[1:44:49] you're going to what see
[1:44:53] because the comforters is going to let
[1:44:55] you see
[1:44:56] he promised he would come and he
[1:44:59] promised you would see
[1:45:02] so a lot of times we always think that
[1:45:05] the holy spirit as some sort of
[1:45:07] sensation
[1:45:11] but many will come in that day and say
[1:45:13] lord lord didn't i do this and he said
[1:45:15] depart from you you were iniquity i
[1:45:17] never knew you
[1:45:19] and yet here's a little woman with the
[1:45:22] predestinated seed and she sees
[1:45:27] the fulfillment
[1:45:29] of the scriptures and that's what's
[1:45:32] accounted to her
[1:45:34] for righteousness
[1:45:37] abraham saw god
[1:45:41] and it was imputed to him
[1:45:44] for righteousness
[1:45:52] because
[1:45:54] all the way down
[1:45:55] it's he said i'll be with you even in
[1:45:59] you till the end of the world
[1:46:01] or at the end of the world when these
[1:46:04] scriptures is to be filled all the way
[1:46:07] down
[1:46:08] it's been god
[1:46:10] who we believe
[1:46:11] on in luther's age
[1:46:14] who
[1:46:16] god who shouted in wesley's age
[1:46:20] god who spoke in tongues in the
[1:46:22] pentecostal age he is coming right down
[1:46:26] before
[1:46:28] the promise some comes
[1:46:31] to prove his scriptures
[1:46:33] all scriptures has got to be
[1:46:37] fulfilled
[1:46:38] sirs we would
[1:46:43] see jesus
[1:46:47] sirs we will
[1:46:49] see him
[1:46:50] amen lord let me see
[1:46:53] give me i said let me don't doubt
[1:46:56] give me revelation i'm looking for you
[1:47:00] in the fulfillment
[1:47:02] of your word every promise in the book
[1:47:04] is mine
[1:47:06] every chapter every verse
[1:47:08] every line god bless you let's stand
[1:47:10] together
[1:47:11] amen
[1:47:16] you don't need to clap i just read the
[1:47:18] book
[1:47:19] you know i i really i guess that's the
[1:47:22] prophet's reward right you say what the
[1:47:24] prophet said but
[1:47:25] it it's i appreciate it i i and i know
[1:47:29] you love me and i love you
[1:47:31] but
[1:47:33] we are
[1:47:34] following the fulfillment
[1:47:39] of
[1:47:40] what the messenger
[1:47:42] prophesied
[1:47:44] that's what we're seeing
[1:47:46] we're seeing the words that he spoke or
[1:47:49] the message that he spoke becoming
[1:47:52] tangible because god's letting us see it
[1:47:56] come to pass
[1:47:58] and he'll let us see the rapture come to
[1:48:00] pass
[1:48:02] it's our promise to see
[1:48:04] i i hope i made that clear with my
[1:48:08] inability but
[1:48:10] um so
[1:48:11] let's just
[1:48:14] bow our heads
[1:48:15] if you have something you'd like to ask
[1:48:17] them
[1:48:18] ask in faith believing
[1:48:22] say lord here's the promise
[1:48:26] that i'm looking
[1:48:29] for you to bring to pass
[1:48:33] i'm not going to give you a way to
[1:48:34] fulfill it
[1:48:36] i'm just trusting
[1:48:39] that when you fulfill it i will see it
[1:48:42] therefore i'm looking for it because you
[1:48:47] promised that i would see it
[1:48:51] you promised me that i would see
[1:48:55] the fulfillment of the promise in my day
[1:49:02] lord let that sink in
[1:49:05] somehow father
[1:49:08] so i'm looking
[1:49:10] to see you
[1:49:15] abraham i guess looked
[1:49:17] many years
[1:49:19] noah looked 40 years
[1:49:24] i don't know the time between
[1:49:28] mary and all that transpired
[1:49:32] but i know all these great believers
[1:49:35] they needed not one evidence
[1:49:38] to know that they talked to
[1:49:40] god and lord when i hear a promise i
[1:49:43] believe i've talked to you
[1:49:46] and you've talked to me
[1:49:48] now all i'm asking father
[1:49:53] is i'm
[1:49:54] looking
[1:49:56] for the fulfillment
[1:49:59] and you promised me i would see it
[1:50:02] and it wouldn't pass me by
[1:50:05] and i rest in that
[1:50:07] so if you have a desire in your heart
[1:50:10] with faith well you just say lord
[1:50:15] i believe that you're going to fulfill
[1:50:17] it
[1:50:18] and i'm looking
[1:50:20] to it
[1:50:21] and i believe that that's my comfort
[1:50:25] is that you said i would see it come to
[1:50:27] pass
[1:50:28] and i'm resting right there
[1:50:30] and that great simplicity

[1:56:12] lord you brought a message across from

[1:56:21] that our mental conception puts the
[1:56:22] scriptures together and we start to
[1:56:24] figure it out lord everything that we
[1:56:26] know and everything that we believe
[1:56:28] comes from you
[1:56:29] lord and we thank you for that we thank
[1:56:31] you for giving us a written word but
[1:56:32] allowing that written word to become
[1:56:34] life

[1:56:41] another greater because we know that
[1:56:43] it's you

[1:56:58] routine and ritual

[1:57:07] your many blessings lord
