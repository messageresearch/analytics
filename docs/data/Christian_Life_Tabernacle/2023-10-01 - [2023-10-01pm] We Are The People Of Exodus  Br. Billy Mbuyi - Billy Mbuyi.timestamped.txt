[14:04] testimony but
[14:06] but I know that God is going to touch
[14:08] someone today
[14:10] so by the grace of God one thing that
[14:14] I'm I feel myself truly blessed is when
[14:17] when you are surrounded by Elders by
[14:19] parents
[14:21] um
[14:22] that who are there to bless you along
[14:24] with the fellowship of brothers and
[14:26] sisters and I truly find myself very
[14:29] very fortunate that I am in the midst of
[14:32] bride it truly makes a big difference so
[14:35] by the grace of God my mom
[14:38] um who is here with with us in states
[14:40] she she God has added a one year in in
[14:44] her life and my mother-in-law who is
[14:45] there back home in India God has added
[14:49] year in her life as well so I give glory
[14:51] to God the testimony I'm going to give
[14:53] today is
[14:55] is
[14:57] uh what has happened in in the life of
[14:59] my mother-in-law back back in India so
[15:02] uh she was going through uh through this
[15:04] back pain
[15:06] and uh progressively was getting little
[15:09] more intense and
[15:12] um
[15:12] when she did go to doctor doctor did
[15:15] suggest I mean like a typical form of
[15:17] treatment
[15:18] XYZ you start with this and it doesn't
[15:21] go well we might have to do a little
[15:22] more aggressive and then final State
[15:24] we'll do surgery so as Dr laids out she
[15:29] comes back home started taking the
[15:30] medication so forth and so on but the
[15:33] pain was increasing day by day it was
[15:35] getting a little worse so
[15:38] um and it was coming to the point where
[15:39] she was not able to do her day-to-day
[15:41] activity uh walking bending down like a
[15:45] ideals like day to day activity
[15:47] one night she was reading a message and
[15:52] I believe it was the future home
[15:54] and at the end
[15:56] um uh and and no no way I'm glorifying
[16:00] my brother Bruno the glory I'm giving it
[16:04] to our one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[16:07] so what happens is uh in that um prayer
[16:11] meeting brother Brennan is praying and
[16:14] um he points out to a lady and he says
[16:18] you who is sitting at the back uh in the
[16:21] corner you have a bone issue
[16:26] except your healing and my mother-in-law
[16:30] she says exactly same place right in the
[16:34] corner and at the back in the corner and
[16:38] at that time she as she was telling me I
[16:42] was like so encouraged and I says you
[16:44] know like I has to share this what
[16:46] happened was uh
[16:48] um it was I think 11 or 11 30 at night
[16:50] when she was reading that message so
[16:53] immediately
[16:54] she had this conversation with the Lord
[16:57] and she said Lord I do accept this
[16:59] blessing this is for me and she accept
[17:02] the blessing and as the biblical verse
[17:05] it says that when we pray that we must
[17:08] pray
[17:10] and believe that it has already happened
[17:13] and it shall come to pass she woke up I
[17:17] um and it happened like four or five
[17:19] weeks ago and uh she woke up next day
[17:22] the pain was absolutely gone and she was
[17:26] able to go to church that day and uh she
[17:30] she testified there and on behalf of her
[17:33] I'm testing mine here that our God is
[17:36] real all we have to do the only
[17:38] ingredient is we just have to believe
[17:42] God bless you all
[17:48] amen
[17:50] that's the work of the Lord
[17:52] and he does it with his own word and his
[17:54] own way he's Sovereign however he wants
[17:56] to do it we just we look forward to that
[17:58] amen I want to sing the song tonight
[18:00] that's why we praise him because we can
[18:03] see him in our life every day amen

[26:57] amen praise God that's a testimony
[27:02] all right man we're gonna invite brother
[27:04] Mark David to come and have a special at
[27:06] this time and also the Sunday School 10
[27:09] to 12 ages are released at this time as
[27:11] brother Mark David comes in
[27:29] we're actually going to sing the same
[27:32] song we already sang which is coming
[27:34] down
[27:35] so a couple of weeks ago
[27:38] and I was just thinking because uh you
[27:40] know you go to the doctor and the doctor
[27:42] will say this is the diet that you
[27:43] should eat if you don't want to have
[27:45] this you don't want to have that don't
[27:46] eat this don't eat that don't eat that
[27:48] you know so in my mind you know I'm
[27:50] trying to follow that you know regimen
[27:52] okay I want to stay healthy you know I
[27:54] don't want that
[27:55] and most of the time you know we starve
[27:58] ourselves we wouldn't eat that and you
[28:00] know I was just thinking in my mind it's
[28:01] easy enough to you know do all these
[28:04] things but then the world when I look at
[28:06] the world look at even the phones that
[28:08] we have in our hand we eat so much out
[28:10] of the world
[28:11] that we get so full that we're unable to
[28:14] heat the word of God and so I sit down
[28:16] and I look at myself and that thing just
[28:18] kept condemning me and sometimes you
[28:20] know I just sneak up on my phone like
[28:21] when my kids would say that easy on your
[28:23] phone and you know and I just started
[28:26] talk that I guess that thing started
[28:28] talking to me you just eat so much from
[28:30] the world even just scrolling just
[28:32] looking at that yes you might not think
[28:34] it's a big deal
[28:35] but it just had it beating me up so much
[28:37] and so I started singing that song
[28:39] inside of me just out of the ring and
[28:40] say come on down come and eat from the
[28:42] Fountain of Life and you know sometimes
[28:45] I would say oh I want to do that and
[28:47] sometimes you just find yourself it's
[28:49] you say why is it hard for me to just
[28:51] eat from that let me I just want to eat
[28:52] that water and eat and get filled in the
[28:55] heat from this world
[28:57] so you know for the past couple of weeks
[28:59] that song would just come to my head
[29:00] coming down to master call it coming
[29:02] down
[29:03] so I was coming to the church this
[29:05] morning I even sang it out in a car and
[29:07] I told my wife is this how we sing it in
[29:09] church she said yes this is how we're
[29:11] saying it in church and so you sang the
[29:14] song today and I'm like I don't need to
[29:17] sing it again but I'm going to sing it
[29:18] one more time
[29:20] [Applause]

[29:28] of God are fed he invites his choosing

[32:45] or whatever the devil might be throwing
[32:47] their way if it becomes a burden on your
[32:50] heart and you bring it before the Lord I
[32:51] know that he'll listen to the desire of
[32:53] your heart amen and that's not because
[32:55] we say so but that's because the word of
[32:57] God says so when we put our faith in
[32:59] that Amen

[36:01] [Music]
[36:11] perfect guilty because I was inspired by
[36:15] our pastor buddy David when his
[36:17] testimony I give his testify here about
[36:19] uh
[36:20] when he was taking uh when he was in
[36:22] pain and taking pain like medicine for
[36:26] five times so I was sitting there in the
[36:29] corner and I know like I was going
[36:30] through something so that is how I got
[36:32] inspired went to to write this problem
[36:35] with my
[36:37] with the testimony of body David so
[36:40] in the February I was having some sort
[36:43] of
[36:45] belly pain like stomach pain and stomach
[36:47] burn and I don't know why it was it was
[36:50] getting termite me going and going on
[36:52] and
[36:53] so I thought it was just something
[36:54] simple but uh he stopped making me sound
[36:57] comfortable that's I couldn't even
[36:59] go for four or five hours without eating
[37:01] have to constantly keep eating and
[37:04] eating if I don't eat it was very very
[37:07] bad like he put me to wait uncomfortable
[37:10] even when I was at work I couldn't stand
[37:13] outside go outside every school too hard
[37:15] I had to have something
[37:17] important about something
[37:19] so I contacted my seven at something
[37:22] when when I start praying you know when
[37:25] you pray God always answer
[37:28] and he come to me and said hey you are
[37:30] healed you are not sick is that said all
[37:33] you are healed sometimes you hear all
[37:35] those things like they say look when you
[37:37] have that said that time was me I had it
[37:39] I said I was here
[37:41] so I I didn't stop there I keep
[37:44] questioning myself like what I'm Healed
[37:46] why if I keep hitting why if I'm here
[37:48] like it's not supposed to be fitting
[37:51] sorry the way up Beauty
[37:53] so
[37:56] one day I come here buddy David it was
[37:58] just like you know when somebody telling
[38:00] something like they don't listen and
[38:03] that's why I was here like I feel like
[38:05] it was just like you know somebody
[38:07] yelling at me like hey I told you hit so
[38:10] by David said you can go to a doctor and
[38:11] Doctor telling you you are sick but look
[38:13] the perfect picture the reality of what
[38:15] God's seeing you and that was me I feel
[38:17] like that was me God was talking to me
[38:19] so I went to see him after church like
[38:21] hey buddy David when he was talking I
[38:23] felt like that was me
[38:25] this morning it was just me
[38:27] and he just said hey
[38:29] Bay Hill I said amen and I walked home
[38:32] and I thought was fine and they keep
[38:35] telling me so I have to write my private
[38:37] care reference me to G I have to work
[38:39] for three months
[38:40] then why waiting for film I'm like you
[38:42] know what I'll give the time to God and
[38:44] I'll see what it's going to do and I'll
[38:46] pray for the doctor that will concert me
[38:48] because I went to different doctors that
[38:50] could know exactly what was going
[38:52] so I went to the doctor and he checked
[38:55] me and they find out like I always have
[38:57] H pylori that was like that was the
[39:00] bacteria that was making that into that
[39:03] so he prescribed me three antibiotic and
[39:07] another mate that was calm being the
[39:09] stomach burn
[39:10] and I came back home it was a lot I had
[39:14] to start taking full time a day and to
[39:17] me was just like waiting
[39:19] I have to start eating almost part-time
[39:21] every single time I take that I started
[39:24] taking one six a.m and going all the way
[39:26] down to 9 00 PM so that was too much
[39:30] then another problems tie again and I
[39:33] wasn't understanding why the problem
[39:34] happening and after urinating I would
[39:36] get tired I don't know why I was getting
[39:38] tired I'll get super tired and my how
[39:41] bouncing like very fast and I had to sit
[39:44] down who I have to it was just very bad
[39:47] but
[39:48] I know I was here but uh tell me about
[39:51] the time but maybe again spoke again
[39:52] like so many times you guys want quick
[39:55] quick results
[39:57] so I end up understanding like there is
[39:59] a difference between miracle and the
[40:01] healing Miracle when they pray for he
[40:04] can heal instantly but healing is the
[40:06] process like it coming up where God
[40:08] bring you to but at the end of the day
[40:10] you get healed
[40:11] so that's why my mind stopped body
[40:14] because I had that so I had a stomach
[40:16] problem and I have urinal problem that I
[40:18] don't know why it's coming
[40:20] then I keep placing it was just like I
[40:23] want to go to play a line I want to go
[40:25] this but there was something that kept
[40:26] coming up you know
[40:29] said hey if you have white attitude your
[40:33] permission comes the past
[40:34] and I said this is let me just reason
[40:37] why God told me because if I go looking
[40:39] for another person to pray for me I
[40:41] doubly
[40:42] so that wouldn't be good so I just tell
[40:45] where I was
[40:46] and I started taking medicine the face
[40:48] of face week
[40:50] I told my wife I have found medicine
[40:52] here
[40:53] there is one missing that letter j
[40:57] was you know everybody knows the name of
[40:59] Jesus by one side of medicine clean by
[41:03] Jesus healed I said this medicine will
[41:05] clean me but Jesus will heal me
[41:08] so I took all this medicine was the
[41:10] longest two weeks of my life I've never
[41:12] been such a fan getting tired I could
[41:15] not walk I would have like a mind body
[41:18] like if you walk the bike for because if
[41:19] I walk I'll get dizzy I could not stand
[41:22] for a long time I never know how I was
[41:24] walking but
[41:25] it was essentially like really bad so
[41:28] and
[41:30] while I was getting tired I was taking
[41:32] medicine I was playing taking medicine
[41:34] playing taking medicine playing I always
[41:37] fake every single time I take medicine I
[41:39] was playing I was playing four or five
[41:40] times a day and when I get tired I ask
[41:42] my wife to lay a hand on me to pray for
[41:44] me
[41:45] and that was keep going on in two weeks
[41:48] I decided to stop all the medicine even
[41:50] the one that they prescribing for us to
[41:52] take after six months and I stopped that
[41:54] medicine I was like no this is too much
[41:55] I have to stop
[41:56] when I went back to the doctor to check
[41:59] bike and it was her assistant and she
[42:02] looked me she's like there's something
[42:03] wrong I said what's going on it's like
[42:06] you lost weight you don't supposed to be
[42:07] losing weight like this it's like did
[42:10] you attend to love so I say no right in
[42:11] it I was actually healing four times I
[42:14] was like there's something wrong here
[42:15] it's like there is something you can go
[42:17] to colonoscopy it's one of other um
[42:20] that's that would put the camera in you
[42:22] to check your stomach
[42:23] I said no
[42:25] as I'm knowing about that because God
[42:26] healed me I took with five I took four
[42:29] and one was just so hit me so I went
[42:32] back home there was way too worried
[42:33] about me they said we're gonna send you
[42:35] to see this kind to check if it's
[42:36] something going on all this time I had
[42:39] the urine problem was kept going on that
[42:41] was like I started focus on like just
[42:43] making me uh terminate me
[42:45] so I went to check the CT scan
[42:50] didn't find anything
[42:52] so I was healed by for the stomach
[42:54] problem
[42:55] for the hearing problem so they sent me
[42:57] to her doctor
[42:58] I went to my doctor they won all the
[43:01] testicle they won every single test they
[43:04] never find anything
[43:06] so they looked me back a doctor looked
[43:08] me in my eyes say Joe there's nothing I
[43:11] can do for you you can hardly go home
[43:13] and hope things get better or you need
[43:16] to talk to somebody
[43:19] that was the time I
[43:23] I know who I talked to
[43:24] you know when you say you go to a doctor
[43:26] they're telling you they're gonna do
[43:28] anything for you but you stay sick and
[43:30] you realize you've been to that time
[43:33] I went back home
[43:36] it was not bothering me but I went back
[43:38] home I said
[43:39] I hold it up to somebody
[43:41] he knows what I'm going to
[43:44] now let's keep going on keep going and
[43:46] at that time I didn't have my bodies in
[43:49] your wedding I had to attend
[43:51] all this thing all the battle was going
[43:52] on I always had a lot of battle from
[43:54] them I didn't know them why not
[43:57] so one time I was sitting and by the one
[44:00] I was talking he said hey if you cannot
[44:02] move your hair hum you said I cannot
[44:04] move my arm I'm just waiting that I do
[44:07] it's not going to happen
[44:08] if he cannot move your arms side the
[44:11] more I'll move
[44:12] if we can not keep saying the next day
[44:15] okay I always been talking about it
[44:17] Darien by the intestinal morning hey how
[44:19] is going I said I've been just walking I
[44:22] don't know why I'm hogged I'm just
[44:24] walking after I read this the scripture
[44:27] have been just walking
[44:29] then I go to another different doctor I
[44:31] keep going to the doctor every single
[44:33] doctor doctor
[44:36] and I got tired suggesting a doctor I
[44:39] said and nobody want to say doctor
[44:41] cannot do anything for you
[44:43] so one time I had another appointment to
[44:45] go see a dog another doctor
[44:47] so I just sit myself I'm like you know
[44:50] what
[44:54] and that's why probably they cannot find
[44:57] anything
[44:58] so I just have to leave them alone
[45:01] and stay here in the wedding of my
[45:03] manifestation to happen and keep praying
[45:05] for my healing
[45:07] as soon as I just said that the Judgment
[45:09] stuff
[45:10] nah I start going to urine and coming
[45:13] back I was not getting tired anymore and
[45:15] now it's like getting when I get tired
[45:16] I'm like you know what I'm gonna go walk
[45:18] outside it's so exciting I'll see you if
[45:20] I'm going pass out outside let me just
[45:23] go walk outside let me take a walk then
[45:25] I will go walk I will go walk I'm like
[45:28] let me just next day I'll get tired the
[45:30] devil come up with me I'm like I get
[45:33] back through my couch I said you know
[45:34] what the next day I'm gonna go to the
[45:36] gym
[45:37] pass out again
[45:39] when I go to the gym I start working my
[45:42] hands shaking shaking I come back I
[45:45] think that I'll be fine I'll go back
[45:47] instead I'm Healed so if I if I fail I
[45:50] would say I only confess that people
[45:51] like I'm healing so we'll see what's
[45:53] going to happen
[45:54] when I went back again
[45:56] I keep hiking working out and nothing
[45:59] happened
[46:00] and everything goes away
[46:02] and my primary care was like we're gonna
[46:04] send you to reality you want to go I
[46:06] don't want to go
[46:07] but I want him again to confirm like I
[46:10] was healed
[46:11] when I went to the office I explained to
[46:14] him he looked at me like this he's like
[46:16] hey we just go home and we hope things
[46:20] get better exactly the same thing the
[46:21] other doctor told me it's about go to
[46:23] omohai and see if they'll find anything
[46:26] I went back home yeah but it didn't
[46:28] shake me a bit I know like I was here
[46:31] event
[46:33] I go back again they went to perform the
[46:36] MRI whatever they did and I come back
[46:39] again and didn't find anything
[46:41] I didn't know what happened I didn't
[46:42] know I was a sickness I don't know what
[46:45] I know God healed me I don't have that
[46:47] no more
[46:48] and I just want to thank God for that
[46:50] event
[46:57] amen you know the devil always tries to
[47:00] put fear in you
[47:02] and that's why healing is a process
[47:04] because you walk into those footsteps of
[47:06] healing by using the word of God thank
[47:08] you Lord for the testimony that we heard
[47:10] tonight that's just all stand
[47:13] as we just turn our hearts to the Lord
[47:15] and just invite our pastor by the
[47:18] ability to come out at this time but I'm
[47:20] no longer a Slave To Fear
[47:22] I'm a Child of God because now I have
[47:25] access to the promised land
[47:28] it's my inheritance and if the devil
[47:30] gives me something that's not of gods I
[47:32] can say take it back devil that's not
[47:34] mine
[47:35] I'm only supposed to inherit joy peace
[47:38] happiness all these things that God
[47:40] wants us to have but if it's fear it's
[47:42] not mind devil and you walk towards a
[47:44] vision of a perfect body
[47:47] that's the image that he wants us to
[47:48] walk into
[47:50] in an image that could transform us from
[47:52] this from this from this place let's
[47:55] just sing this house we're just invite
[47:57] her passionate about the ability to come
[47:58] to him you unravel me
[48:03] with the melody
[48:07] you surround me with the song
[48:15] of
[48:17] Deliverance for my
[48:21] enemies
[48:23] to all my fears
[48:29] [Music]
[48:40] I am a child
[48:46] I'm no longer
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] slave to free

[50:46] [Music]
[50:58] I am a child of God
[51:03] amen you believe you're a child of God
[51:06] Amen one of the characteristics of the
[51:09] children of God is they have no fear
[51:12] they have no fear to what the devil can
[51:14] do why because they know whose father
[51:16] they are they know that they have the
[51:19] Heavenly Father God is their father
[51:21] therefore he has everything under
[51:22] control let's just buy our heads our
[51:24] gracious father we're so thankful to be
[51:26] gathered once again in your house Lord
[51:28] to hear the testimony coming out of your
[51:30] children Lord and father we come here we
[51:33] know that in each vessel represented in
[51:35] this room you are doing a work Lord and
[51:38] we may not see it we may not understand
[51:40] it but by faith and by the scripture we
[51:44] know that you are working everything for
[51:46] our good Lord you are the secret
[51:48] Gardener as of Pastor said this morning
[51:50] that you were behind and making all
[51:53] things all right and taking us out of
[51:55] circumstances and changing circumstances
[51:57] and situations some that we've gotten
[52:00] ourselves you come and pick us up and
[52:02] get us out and further you doing all
[52:04] that you can because your promise will
[52:06] not fail you are the same yesterday
[52:09] today and forever and we hear Lord to to
[52:12] just show our appreciation and our love
[52:14] to have a Gods such that you are oh God
[52:17] and one who never sleeps no Slumber he's
[52:20] at the work of his children and trying
[52:22] to do all that he can by his promise
[52:25] that he will bring them forth be with us
[52:27] we pray bless this communion service
[52:29] we're committed to you and we ask that
[52:31] you show us Grace once again for the few
[52:33] words we're going to say in the name of
[52:35] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[52:37] amen it's good to be gathered once again
[52:40] in the house of God our communion
[52:42] service
[52:43] will try not to be too long
[52:47] um let's open our Bibles first scripture
[52:49] in Hebrews 13
[52:52] verse 11.
[53:02] message for
[53:03] the bodies of those beasts it says whose
[53:07] blood is is brought into the sanctuary
[53:10] for the high priest for sin
[53:12] are burned without the camp
[53:16] wherefore Jesus also that it might
[53:19] sanctify the people
[53:21] with his own blood suffered without the
[53:24] gain
[53:25] let us forth he says let us go forth
[53:28] therefore unto him without the camp
[53:31] bearing his reproach for a year we have
[53:36] no continuing City but we seek one to
[53:39] come
[53:40] amen let's also turn in Exodus chapter 3
[53:44] we'll start from the first verse it says
[53:47] now Moses kept the flock of Jay through
[53:51] his uh his father-in-law the priest of
[53:55] median and uh
[53:57] he had led the flock to the backside of
[54:00] the desert and came to the mountain of
[54:02] no God even to Horeb and the angel of
[54:06] the Lord appeared unto him in the flame
[54:08] of fire
[54:09] out of the midst of the of the uh Bush
[54:13] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[54:17] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[54:21] and Moses said I will go now turn aside
[54:25] and see this great sight
[54:28] why the bush is not burned now remember
[54:30] when he preaches the message Exodus he
[54:34] said his approach was very important
[54:38] because if he had just seen that and
[54:40] gone and said well this is amazing and
[54:43] and approach it with an intellectual
[54:45] side to go and take the leaf and said
[54:47] I'll take you to the lab and go examine
[54:49] it and see why it's not happening he
[54:51] would have missed it
[54:53] so so I want to say that the approach to
[54:55] the word of God and the promise is very
[54:57] important we don't approach it by
[55:00] intellect so we can learn and know
[55:02] things that we don't know we as our
[55:04] Pastor said this morning the approach is
[55:06] to learn and to come knowing that this
[55:09] is the word of God this is the promise
[55:12] that he has made if I come believing
[55:15] that this is God I'm going to get God's
[55:17] result but if I come thinking it's just
[55:20] intellect all I'll receive is intellect
[55:22] but if I come believing that it's God
[55:24] speaking to me then I will receive the
[55:27] reward
[55:28] and and so in verse 4 it says and when
[55:32] the Lord saw that he had turned aside to
[55:35] see God called unto him out of the midst
[55:38] of the Bush and he said Moses Moses he
[55:41] said here I am here am I
[55:43] and he said draw not nigh Heather put
[55:47] off thy shoes from from off thy feet for
[55:51] the place whereof thou standeth is a
[55:53] Holy Ground
[55:55] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[55:58] father
[55:59] the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and
[56:02] the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face
[56:05] for he was afraid to look upon God and
[56:08] the Lord said I have surely seen the
[56:11] Affliction of my people which are in
[56:13] Egypt and I have heard the Cry by reason
[56:17] of the Taskmaster and I know their
[56:20] sorrows so God knows what's going on he
[56:24] he there's nothing hid before him
[56:26] whatever is happening in your life he
[56:28] knows every details he he sees
[56:30] everything it says and the Lord said I
[56:33] surely have seen the Affliction of my
[56:35] people which are in Egypt and I have
[56:37] heard their Cry by reason of the
[56:39] Taskmaster and I know they're sorrowed
[56:41] and I've come down to deliver them out
[56:44] of the hands of the Egyptians he said
[56:47] and to bring them up out of the land
[56:50] unto a good land in the Lord and the
[56:53] large and unto a land flowing with milk
[56:56] and honey unto the place of the
[56:59] Canaanite Heights of the head sides of
[57:01] the amorites and the parasites
[57:04] parasites and of the hivites and of the
[57:07] genocides it says now therefore Behold
[57:10] The Cry of the children of Israel has
[57:13] come unto me and I have also seen the of
[57:16] the oppression wherewith the Egyptian or
[57:19] Christ them it says come now therefore I
[57:22] will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou
[57:25] mayest bring forth my people
[57:28] to bring forth my my people the children
[57:32] of Israel out of Egypt let's just bow
[57:34] heads father we ask that you bless your
[57:36] word to us in the name of Jesus Christ
[57:38] we pray amen you may have your seeds
[57:47] we surely can say
[57:51] as you you you
[57:56] look at the world and you look at things
[58:00] around us one of the things we could be
[58:03] certain of is that here there's no
[58:06] continuing City
[58:08] that everything will come to an end you
[58:13] you look at Men's great invention you
[58:16] know
[58:18] in the computer World there was what was
[58:21] if you look at what they brought up to
[58:24] be the first computer it was amazing it
[58:26] seems like that was the end of it but
[58:30] yet years later man built something that
[58:32] was better than what they built before
[58:35] and you can look at in the nature but
[58:39] when I'm well speaking he said we we
[58:42] look at cities and we look at countries
[58:44] and no doubt we know that those cities
[58:48] are built on top of other cities that
[58:51] existed before
[58:53] you know men will cling to to try to
[58:58] keep their lives by exercise but
[59:00] whatever they can do and to try to live
[59:03] and and then as they get older they get
[59:06] feeble they get weak and then eventually
[59:08] they die
[59:10] you can look at uh when I even ask a
[59:14] question how can it be that men with
[59:16] such a great invention and great things
[59:18] that they do today but yet we have more
[59:21] diseases than we did before we have more
[59:24] sicknesses than what we had before we
[59:27] had more deaths than what we had before
[59:29] more hatred more everything but yet we
[59:32] are progress we are claiming to be
[59:34] progressing
[59:36] come on
[59:38] you look at nature itself will show you
[59:42] the the you you look at Seasons and
[59:46] there are more hurricane than they were
[59:47] before and more floods than they were
[59:50] before and you know I was telling my
[59:52] wife I said pretty soon we'll be paying
[59:54] wind Insurance because it seems like you
[59:58] know that's how it started how did
[59:59] people come to pay flood insurance well
[1:00:02] that thing never existed before unless
[1:00:04] until they looked and they noticed a
[1:00:06] pattern and then all of a sudden it
[1:00:09] became attached to insurance so we have
[1:00:11] a lot of wind that blows and I'm like I
[1:00:14] guarantee you in a couple of years time
[1:00:16] will be paying wind insurance
[1:00:19] it it just shows that nothing that men
[1:00:23] does will last forever and it's
[1:00:26] pointless when we take our efforts and
[1:00:30] put it into What man does and we look at
[1:00:33] even how we spend our time what we put
[1:00:36] our effort in and you you just have to
[1:00:39] look at it long enough uh perhaps not
[1:00:42] necessarily just your lifetime but just
[1:00:44] look at mankind history and realize that
[1:00:47] it will come to nothing the scripture
[1:00:50] says that all things that man does is
[1:00:52] Vanity
[1:00:53] it will give you pleasure for a season
[1:00:56] and then after that it's nothing you
[1:00:59] know you you'll think oh I like this you
[1:01:01] eat it you eat it and then just right
[1:01:03] after you finish eating it it becomes
[1:01:05] terrible you don't want to see it
[1:01:06] anymore
[1:01:08] why because it's not made to last
[1:01:10] forever
[1:01:12] and we can certainly say that the only
[1:01:14] thing that will last is the word of God
[1:01:17] uh the only thing that would produce a
[1:01:20] consistent result is the word of God if
[1:01:24] we truly are looking for a permanent
[1:01:28] City one that could be stand forever
[1:01:30] stand against every season stand against
[1:01:33] every uh obstacle stand against every
[1:01:37] wind and every flood or whatever the
[1:01:41] only city we can find is the city that's
[1:01:43] built by the word of God
[1:01:45] and it's not the word of God means mixed
[1:01:48] with men's you know like this we have
[1:01:50] today and we'll take a little bit of
[1:01:52] here and then mix it with our own
[1:01:54] intellect and come up with a product
[1:01:55] that we can easily consume that also
[1:01:58] will produce death because he has to be
[1:02:01] the pure word of God that will produce a
[1:02:04] pure group of people
[1:02:06] so as we read I I was thinking in light
[1:02:10] of even what our pastor spoke on uh this
[1:02:14] morning and and the things that has been
[1:02:17] spoken
[1:02:18] um the scripture says in Exodus chapter
[1:02:21] 6 and 1 it says then the Lord said unto
[1:02:23] Moses it says now shall thou thou see
[1:02:27] that I will what I will do to pharaoh it
[1:02:31] says for with a strong hand will I let
[1:02:34] them go and will with a strong hand
[1:02:37] shall I shall he drive them out of the
[1:02:40] land he says and God spoken to Moses
[1:02:43] saying unto him he says I am God I am
[1:02:46] the god I am the Lord it says and I have
[1:02:49] appeared unto Moses unto Isaac and unto
[1:02:52] Jacob it says by thy name God Almighty
[1:02:56] but by my name Jehovah was I not known
[1:02:59] to them and then he says and I have also
[1:03:02] established my Covenant with him to give
[1:03:05] them the land of Canaan the land of the
[1:03:08] pilgrimage wherewith there were there
[1:03:11] were strangers it says and I will also I
[1:03:14] will also hear I I have also hear the
[1:03:17] groaning of the children of Israel whom
[1:03:19] the Israelites kept in bondage and I
[1:03:22] have I remembered my Covenant now I want
[1:03:25] to say this and perhaps for just few
[1:03:27] minutes I know uh we we we have
[1:03:30] communion I want to speak on we are the
[1:03:34] people of Exodus we are the people of
[1:03:37] Exodus to to every Exodus there had to
[1:03:41] be a group of people that were called to
[1:03:43] that Exodus to every Exodus there had to
[1:03:47] be some prepared group of people that
[1:03:50] would hear the word and accept the word
[1:03:52] and walk into the word of God in order
[1:03:55] for them to experience what God was
[1:03:57] speaking and our Exodus is not us
[1:04:00] choosing God our Exodus is by promise
[1:04:05] our Exodus is by promise and it's
[1:04:08] there's a promise in the word of God for
[1:04:12] every season that a people has been
[1:04:14] living on Earth this uh we can look at
[1:04:17] the Bible and I want to say this as we
[1:04:19] read in Exodus this uh children of
[1:04:22] Israel there God made a promise to the
[1:04:25] Father Abraham and and if you read it
[1:04:28] you realize that this was before there
[1:04:30] was not even a thing as a nation of
[1:04:33] Israel before they can come on the same
[1:04:35] God is speaking to Abraham and he's
[1:04:37] saying that that your descendant or your
[1:04:40] children will be in bondage for 400
[1:04:43] years and and afterwards I will bring
[1:04:45] them out with a mighty hand and and and
[1:04:48] and they were here because God gave a
[1:04:52] promise there were a people of a promise
[1:04:56] so it was a promise given to Abraham
[1:04:59] that your seed will go unto bondage
[1:05:01] therefore when they find themselves they
[1:05:03] were fulfilling the very promised that
[1:05:05] God made to Abraham and but God also
[1:05:08] promised that he will take them out of
[1:05:10] bondage by a mighty hand and bring them
[1:05:13] to a land that he had promised that he
[1:05:15] would give them the land that never
[1:05:17] belonged to them to begin with they
[1:05:19] didn't do anything to deserve it they
[1:05:22] didn't do anything to be good for it it
[1:05:24] was just God's word given to them
[1:05:27] so when we look at in the first Exodus
[1:05:31] it was God is giving this promise and it
[1:05:34] was for his own sake
[1:05:35] or because God knew that he he was to
[1:05:39] have a son come out of Abraham and the
[1:05:42] son was going to be a royal son and and
[1:05:45] he couldn't have him with the people in
[1:05:47] bondage that he knew that there was to
[1:05:49] go in bondage but he knew that the time
[1:05:52] will come when I will bring them out so
[1:05:54] I can fulfill the promise to say that
[1:05:57] out of Israel I called my son
[1:06:00] when God gives a promise it's not for us
[1:06:03] it's for his own sake we are beneficial
[1:06:06] of that promise we reap benefit of that
[1:06:09] promise but it's for his own sake what
[1:06:13] is the namesake means when you go read
[1:06:15] that word it means it's to protect one's
[1:06:17] reputation
[1:06:19] it's one acting in accordance with his
[1:06:22] re with his revealed character to uphold
[1:06:25] the honor of his Revelation so when God
[1:06:29] gives his Revelation it's not for us to
[1:06:31] wonder when he's going to happen is it
[1:06:33] really going to happen how is it no he
[1:06:36] who gave the promise he has a reputation
[1:06:39] to protect he has to have a Believer
[1:06:42] ready to receive the promise he has to
[1:06:44] have someone ready to perform that
[1:06:47] promise the way he said he would
[1:06:51] so we see in the first Exodus God who
[1:06:55] give a promise in the Genesis 15 12 and
[1:06:58] 14 it says and it says and when the sun
[1:07:01] was going down a deep sleep fall upon
[1:07:04] Abraham and lo and an aura and a great
[1:07:08] Darkness upon uh fell upon him and he
[1:07:11] said unto Abram he says no or surety
[1:07:15] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:07:18] land that is not theirs
[1:07:20] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[1:07:23] afflict them for them 400 years and then
[1:07:27] he says and also that Nation whom they
[1:07:30] Shall Serve I will judge and afterwards
[1:07:34] shall they come out with a great
[1:07:36] substance
[1:07:37] what is he doing God fulfilling his own
[1:07:41] promise God bringing a people a people
[1:07:44] that's not even represented on the face
[1:07:47] of the Earth yet but yet there was a
[1:07:49] promise for them let me say this we
[1:07:51] didn't come here by men's idea or by how
[1:07:54] we think we like the message this is the
[1:07:57] promise of God before you were even
[1:07:59] represented here on Earth there was a
[1:08:02] promise made in heaven that in the last
[1:08:04] day I will have a people upon the Earth
[1:08:06] that will bury my name they will bear my
[1:08:09] characteristics they will believe the
[1:08:11] message they will manifest the product
[1:08:13] of the message and I have given my
[1:08:16] promise and I will come to do it
[1:08:23] so in the second Exodus we we find out
[1:08:27] that it was after men fall in the Garden
[1:08:30] of Eden and God came in the garden and
[1:08:34] he said that the seed of the woman shall
[1:08:37] bruise the Serpent's head
[1:08:39] and the scripture would say in numbers
[1:08:42] 24 17-19 and said I have seen him
[1:08:47] I have seen him but not now I shall see
[1:08:51] him but not now I Shall Behold Him it
[1:08:55] says but not nigh they shall come a sore
[1:08:59] out of David out of Jacob and the
[1:09:02] scepter shall rise out of Israel and
[1:09:05] shall Smite the corners of Moab and
[1:09:08] destroy all the children of saith
[1:09:11] it says in the Edom shall be that a
[1:09:13] possession Seer shall be a possession
[1:09:17] for the enemy of Israel shall do
[1:09:20] vanishly
[1:09:22] and then he says out of Jacob shall come
[1:09:25] he Thou shalt have dominion and shall
[1:09:28] destroy him thy reigneth of the city
[1:09:33] in Psalms 2 and 79 and it says I will
[1:09:37] declare I will declare the decree the
[1:09:40] Lord it says has said unto me thou are
[1:09:44] my son this day I have begotten thee ask
[1:09:48] of me and shall I shall it says and I
[1:09:51] shall give Thee the hidden for for
[1:09:53] inheritance and the other most part of
[1:09:56] the year for that possession what was he
[1:09:58] this is a son before he's even born
[1:10:01] before Mary was on the picture before
[1:10:03] anything he's proclaiming that they
[1:10:05] shall come one for the second Exodus and
[1:10:08] it says I'll give you the ever the Earth
[1:10:10] for inheritance I'll give you all those
[1:10:13] things I the shelter shall be on thy
[1:10:15] hand and and ye shall possess all things
[1:10:18] and and then he says it gives all this
[1:10:20] promise he says Behold a child shall be
[1:10:23] given and uh one shall be given and the
[1:10:26] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:10:29] but yet it's not even born
[1:10:31] what was he it was God speaking the
[1:10:35] words of Exodus before people can be
[1:10:37] even manifested on the face of the Earth
[1:10:42] so now
[1:10:43] we come down to the Third Exodus and I
[1:10:46] want to say this we know we are here by
[1:10:49] God's word that there was to be a
[1:10:52] promise for the Fulfillment of malachite
[1:10:54] 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 and 7 in this
[1:10:59] generation God promised that those
[1:11:01] things shall come to pass
[1:11:04] so just like he did in the first Exodus
[1:11:06] he did in the second Exodus we are here
[1:11:09] standing here or gathered here because
[1:11:12] those scriptures have been fulfilled in
[1:11:14] our time
[1:11:16] and the scripture says in John 14 and 20
[1:11:19] it says and that day ye shall know that
[1:11:21] I as I am in them I am in my father now
[1:11:25] what is he saying and let me say this
[1:11:26] oftentimes we look at it or we think
[1:11:29] well I am in my father and my father and
[1:11:31] I now now he's telling us the same way
[1:11:34] that the father came and fulfilled his
[1:11:36] promise in the Sun the same way that I
[1:11:40] am in my father what was he he came from
[1:11:42] the father he was to go back in the
[1:11:44] father he was there and the father dwelt
[1:11:47] in him he says that in that day ye shall
[1:11:50] know what the unity of the father and I
[1:11:52] was because I and my father will come
[1:11:55] and dwell in you
[1:11:57] what is it it's the Exodus and let me
[1:12:00] say this the word of God is given to you
[1:12:03] and I to cause an exodus in our lives or
[1:12:06] when you receive the word I'm not
[1:12:08] talking about when you try to understand
[1:12:10] with your mind no when the word is
[1:12:12] receiving the heart when we come to
[1:12:15] church and the word is preached when you
[1:12:17] receive it in your heart it causes a
[1:12:19] separation it causes an exodus from the
[1:12:23] things that you find yourself is calling
[1:12:25] you to move out of the things that you
[1:12:28] are in into the things that God is
[1:12:30] calling you for
[1:12:34] it's not given for us to sit here and
[1:12:37] just
[1:12:39] debate and and talk and and and and and
[1:12:42] spew out the Revelation that we have
[1:12:45] received off of it it's given for an
[1:12:47] exodus it's given for a change it's
[1:12:51] given to call out it's given to cause a
[1:12:54] conflict and let me say when you receive
[1:12:56] the true word of God in your heart it
[1:12:58] causes a conflict
[1:13:01] something within your heart things that
[1:13:03] you should you you you used to love
[1:13:06] because you receive the word of God in
[1:13:08] your heart it starts to kick everything
[1:13:10] else out it starts to kick the last out
[1:13:13] and the love of the World Health and it
[1:13:15] says to keep that out and kick that out
[1:13:17] you find yourself the very things you
[1:13:19] used to enjoy you don't enjoy anymore
[1:13:21] why because you are in an exodus
[1:13:25] a conflict the word of God is a conflict
[1:13:29] creator
[1:13:31] it's not given to sympathize with the
[1:13:33] world it's not given so you can abide
[1:13:36] and and find a way to commingle it and
[1:13:38] have it there and have the world there
[1:13:40] now it's given to kick out the trash to
[1:13:44] kick out the things of the world and to
[1:13:46] take you and to pick you up out of
[1:13:48] automatic the mud and all the things and
[1:13:50] to place you as a son and the daughter
[1:13:52] of God to bring out the characteristics
[1:13:55] of one who's going somewhere
[1:14:04] so now
[1:14:06] people call by my name he said
[1:14:12] and he's doing it in the middle of Chaos
[1:14:18] is doing it in the middle of turmoil
[1:14:22] in the middle of sickness and depression
[1:14:25] and all kinds of things
[1:14:27] the word of God is their calling
[1:14:30] the word of God is there to bring you
[1:14:33] into the realization the way you're
[1:14:36] going the world cannot take you there
[1:14:39] where I'm calling you there's nothing in
[1:14:42] the world that can satisfy Our Calling
[1:14:45] where I'm trying to make you what I'm
[1:14:47] trying to make out of you you cannot get
[1:14:50] it by feeding into the things of the
[1:14:52] world
[1:14:53] the word of God proclaims that
[1:14:58] and I want to say this you cannot come
[1:15:00] in contact with that word and remain the
[1:15:03] same
[1:15:07] we can
[1:15:10] we can't truly with sincerity with
[1:15:14] everything within our hearts and and and
[1:15:17] come tonight or come day after day and
[1:15:20] come and receive the true word of God
[1:15:23] and Remains the Same
[1:15:26] every time you hear it it strikes your
[1:15:28] heart and it calls out for sins and it
[1:15:32] tells you about the land that you are
[1:15:34] growing in he the word is given to
[1:15:36] prepare you for the place that you are
[1:15:39] going
[1:15:41] it's putting you in preparation to the
[1:15:43] place through the location to the place
[1:15:46] where God is calling you to be
[1:15:49] yeah and I want to say this everything
[1:15:51] that happens in your life
[1:15:54] is for that one purpose
[1:15:59] I can't believe and this happened praise
[1:16:02] God you are an exodus person now
[1:16:05] remember I said yes there is no
[1:16:07] continual City because if we're not
[1:16:09] careful our effort and our Viewpoint of
[1:16:12] what's happening to us can be twisted
[1:16:15] you can look and and we put our effort
[1:16:18] and we try to build cities and all of
[1:16:20] that things that will crumble the
[1:16:22] scripture says store up your Stranger In
[1:16:24] Heaven A people of Exodus remember
[1:16:26] Abraham knew that it was a stranger in
[1:16:29] the pilgrim he never stayed one place
[1:16:32] where he thought it was his home
[1:16:36] he was always there waiting for God's
[1:16:40] instruction instruction for him to move
[1:16:42] to another place and the people of
[1:16:44] Exodus are in the same condition they
[1:16:47] hear the word of God and they hear and
[1:16:50] whatever is happening they put it in
[1:16:52] perspective with the word and they know
[1:16:54] that God is taking them somewhere
[1:17:05] let me say this
[1:17:07] but when I'm saying the message
[1:17:10] the Third Exodus
[1:17:13] he says
[1:17:16] now we've had many Exodus paragraph 55.
[1:17:21] we've had many Exodus of course
[1:17:24] but I'm speaking
[1:17:26] on the time that God called an exodus a
[1:17:30] separation from where they were
[1:17:34] at the present time here God is making
[1:17:38] ready to fulfill his Divine promised
[1:17:42] word
[1:17:43] and then he says that he might give to
[1:17:46] Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and
[1:17:49] hundreds of years had passed but yet God
[1:17:53] never forgot his promise
[1:17:56] in its it says in the seasons the due
[1:18:00] season God always makes his promise
[1:18:03] right
[1:18:04] oh my brother my sister that that's the
[1:18:08] the foundation upon which we are built
[1:18:10] we we hear because God made a promise to
[1:18:14] us and and we know that there's one
[1:18:16] thing that God cannot do is to lie if
[1:18:19] God made a promise in the first Exodus
[1:18:22] and he brought it to pass if he made a
[1:18:24] promise in the second Exodus and he
[1:18:26] brought it to pass how much more is he
[1:18:28] obligated in the third accident to make
[1:18:31] a promise and to bring it to pass
[1:18:34] let me say this to you you are sitting
[1:18:36] here because you are a promised person
[1:18:40] and let me repeat that you are sitting
[1:18:42] here because you are someone who have
[1:18:44] received a promise if you didn't receive
[1:18:47] your promise you would have been out
[1:18:48] there you would have been in the world
[1:18:50] you would have never heard this message
[1:18:52] you hear it because there's a promise in
[1:18:54] here for you
[1:18:56] let me say this this promise protected
[1:18:59] your grandfather it protected your
[1:19:01] father it protected all of him why
[1:19:03] because you had to come and hear it
[1:19:08] when you were about to die the promise
[1:19:11] said this is not the time you have not
[1:19:13] come to it yet when something was about
[1:19:15] the promise was protecting you bringing
[1:19:18] you so you can be the recipient and let
[1:19:21] me say this no one can take your place
[1:19:23] if God wrote it for you you're gonna
[1:19:26] receive it
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] we act like we are the ones seeking the
[1:19:33] promise and not realizing that the
[1:19:36] promise is hunting us he's protecting us
[1:19:38] walking us around and breaking away
[1:19:41] making a way why because the promises
[1:19:44] got your name on it
[1:19:52] and I want to say this regardless of the
[1:19:56] opposition
[1:19:57] now
[1:20:00] now I wonder why did God have to harden
[1:20:03] Pharaoh's heart just answer that
[1:20:06] question why did God have to harden
[1:20:09] pharah's heart he could have just said
[1:20:10] well I'll kill him you go and you get
[1:20:12] out I'll say I'll just live in the way
[1:20:15] no God wanted to turn up the heat he
[1:20:18] wanted to leave you without any doubt he
[1:20:22] wanted when we come in this end time
[1:20:24] generation when we pick up the scripture
[1:20:26] when we read about it we know we are
[1:20:29] serving a certain God who never fails in
[1:20:33] his promise who's the same yesterday
[1:20:34] today and forever when he speaks it
[1:20:37] happens
[1:20:38] yes
[1:20:42] oh yeah
[1:20:46] you know I I talked about myself being
[1:20:48] Moses I'm like God please don't you know
[1:20:50] just just give me the problem it's like
[1:20:53] no
[1:20:54] I need to raise up if you ever had
[1:20:57] someone who's trying to solve the
[1:20:58] problem for you but then he's raising up
[1:21:01] the heat and you're trying to beg him
[1:21:02] please don't just let's just finish it
[1:21:05] off it's like no I'll raise up the heat
[1:21:08] bring up the match oh hardness hard I'll
[1:21:10] have him do this I'll have him do that
[1:21:12] but then I'll show you what kind of God
[1:21:15] I am
[1:21:21] he wanted his promise without a shadow
[1:21:24] of a doubt he wanted when you receive
[1:21:28] his word you don't have to worry about
[1:21:30] nothing you don't have to question it
[1:21:33] you don't have to think it you just take
[1:21:36] it as it is and know he done it
[1:21:39] just like he did it with Moses just like
[1:21:42] he did it with Jesus he's here The
[1:21:45] Exodus does not start until God himself
[1:21:48] is on the same
[1:21:54] thank you
[1:21:57] you have communion so
[1:22:03] he says therefore
[1:22:06] you can rest assure
[1:22:08] now he he done the same thing with
[1:22:10] Abraham you know he he gave him a
[1:22:13] promise he tried Abraham for 25 years he
[1:22:15] gave him the promise and then Abraham
[1:22:17] was rejoicing on the promise then God
[1:22:19] tells him now I want you to kill the son
[1:22:23] 25 years
[1:22:26] and and now this I mean what he says
[1:22:29] God wanted to be double sure
[1:22:34] double sure is the word that he uses
[1:22:36] double sure all right what we have
[1:22:39] received has been tested it's won the
[1:22:42] victory it's already overcome what we
[1:22:45] have received is an overcoming word that
[1:22:48] we just need to apply
[1:22:52] it's true in every season every time
[1:22:55] every time it's coming it's won the
[1:22:57] victory
[1:23:01] and now don't forget the principle if he
[1:23:03] done it he's going to do it again
[1:23:08] now he says he wanted you to he wanted
[1:23:11] you to rest assure that what God has
[1:23:15] promised in the Bible is going to do it
[1:23:18] it says just no need of trying to think
[1:23:21] anything else
[1:23:23] or say well the prophet was maybe was
[1:23:27] wrong or could have happened this way
[1:23:30] that in this way look almost impossible
[1:23:32] and then he says and look how simple he
[1:23:37] does it he says I have come down I have
[1:23:39] heard the cry I remember my promise I've
[1:23:42] come down to do it he says I'm sending
[1:23:45] you he says you do it he says you do it
[1:23:48] I'm going to be with you certainly I'll
[1:23:52] be with you he says my never never
[1:23:54] failing present presence will be with
[1:23:57] you wherever you go don't be afraid I'm
[1:24:01] coming I'm coming down to deliver now
[1:24:04] God has come down why is he shaming you
[1:24:10] government
[1:24:11] God has come down what is he sending you
[1:24:14] because he needs a vessel
[1:24:17] he needs someone that will stand he
[1:24:20] needs someone to believe his word but
[1:24:22] when I'm says in the first Exodus that
[1:24:24] God came down he went in the form of a
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:28] when we take the God's words and we go
[1:24:30] it's us God going in the form of a man
[1:24:39] and I said I'm coming down to deliver he
[1:24:41] says I'm sure the spiritual mind catches
[1:24:44] it catches that see I'm sending you I'm
[1:24:48] sending you to bring my people to an
[1:24:51] exodus he says I says I called them out
[1:24:54] and I'll be with you but when I'm says
[1:24:57] what is he doing he's sending you the
[1:24:59] same way the father sent him how did the
[1:25:02] father understand them the father who
[1:25:03] sent them went in him
[1:25:08] other
[1:25:09] don't be afraid no I I want to say this
[1:25:13] you know and forgive me if my kind of
[1:25:16] mind is going too far I thought it's
[1:25:20] amazing you know
[1:25:23] yeah we are humans and
[1:25:26] we when God makes a promise and no doubt
[1:25:30] from our human mind it should be
[1:25:32] something that seems impossible
[1:25:36] right
[1:25:38] okay
[1:25:41] so God gives us
[1:25:44] Our Daily Bread
[1:25:46] how many believe it but some don't
[1:25:51] God gives us
[1:25:52] the very Breath of Life nobody can
[1:25:54] manufacture the breath but go out there
[1:25:57] ask how many believe
[1:25:59] that the Breath of Life they have is
[1:26:00] god-giving God gives us good health how
[1:26:03] many believe that
[1:26:06] so if God has to make you believe it has
[1:26:10] to do something for you it must be
[1:26:13] something that you cannot do something
[1:26:16] that's outside of your thinking realm
[1:26:18] right so yes obviously when he says it
[1:26:21] to you human you must look at it and say
[1:26:24] oh that's impossible right in other
[1:26:27] words it's not God because he's got God
[1:26:29] God's character he's only he has things
[1:26:31] he can do that no one else can do so
[1:26:34] when he comes and he says well I'll take
[1:26:36] you out of your bondage I'll take you
[1:26:38] out of your sin I'll take you out of
[1:26:40] your depression I'll take you out of the
[1:26:42] sin that's binding you obviously where
[1:26:45] you are you've tried all that you can
[1:26:46] you know it's impossible you know it's
[1:26:49] impossible but he looks at it on the god
[1:26:52] side he knows I have the power to do it
[1:26:54] and the reason he's doing is so you can
[1:26:57] know that he is God
[1:27:00] that's right
[1:27:04] the scripture says ask abundantly
[1:27:10] why do you go ask God things that a man
[1:27:13] can do
[1:27:18] so if we want to use this godship and
[1:27:21] and look at it for who he really is then
[1:27:24] we must have you we must be in
[1:27:26] expectations of things however many
[1:27:29] years we try we'll never get it
[1:27:33] he says he'll give you a body change
[1:27:36] he says he'll take you into Rapture so
[1:27:39] those are things that it doesn't matter
[1:27:41] how much we try we'll never figure it
[1:27:43] out so when we come to God he's the
[1:27:46] Creator when he does things how did he
[1:27:48] move Israel how he says out of Israel
[1:27:50] will I call my son he moves the world he
[1:27:54] changes circumstances brings War here
[1:27:57] that's not over here that that's God's
[1:28:00] attributes that's him so when it comes
[1:28:04] to your sicknesses and the doctors have
[1:28:05] said you can be healed you can be healed
[1:28:08] you can't be he says okay bring it to me
[1:28:10] I will show you who I am my
[1:28:12] characteristic is to date things that
[1:28:15] people cannot do and do it for you
[1:28:18] Hallelujah
[1:28:23] we don't believe it because we don't
[1:28:26] understand it
[1:28:27] I mean we believe it not because we
[1:28:29] understand it but we believe it because
[1:28:31] we know who promised
[1:28:36] and he specializes in things that you
[1:28:40] cannot do that no doctors can do no one
[1:28:43] else can offer that for you when you
[1:28:46] come to him he wants to show that it's
[1:28:48] God and he says he does things that no
[1:28:51] one else can
[1:28:57] man God bless you I know we have
[1:28:59] communion I don't want to go through
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:11] I feel like I've been sold sure
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:21] he must be getting at me for something
[1:29:23] I'm just getting excited
[1:29:27] isn't that the truth
[1:29:29] amen we've seen that song you know God
[1:29:32] Specializes in things thought impossible
[1:29:36] I like that double sure
[1:29:38] double sure
[1:29:41] amen just for you just think of that
[1:29:44] you know that's what he said in proving
[1:29:47] his word it didn't he said that God made
[1:29:51] the promise so now he had to
[1:29:53] predestinate somebody to be there that
[1:29:57] he could bring that promise to pass in
[1:30:00] for his name's sake and I I'll tell you
[1:30:04] I wrote that down I have to go preach
[1:30:06] this this weekend and I thought you know
[1:30:09] what I'm going to do I'm going to sit
[1:30:10] down and listen to Billy's tape and I'm
[1:30:13] going to try to practice that the best I
[1:30:16] can you know what I mean and uh
[1:30:19] that with the
[1:30:21] kick and and bring some of those things
[1:30:24] uh together but I I just think it's it's
[1:30:28] true
[1:30:29] at the end I there's just so much what
[1:30:33] he said there that just bubbles up
[1:30:34] inside of me because
[1:30:37] I I I
[1:30:39] just to give you a little something
[1:30:41] that's on my heart that
[1:30:44] because that we're going forward I've
[1:30:47] just got this thing burning in my heart
[1:30:49] about
[1:30:51] this running from the presence of the
[1:30:54] Lord
[1:30:55] and and this helped me put this thought
[1:30:58] together it hasn't matured
[1:31:00] in my heart but we know that our faith
[1:31:03] is in the presence of the Lord
[1:31:05] how many knows that that we say it's the
[1:31:08] the word of God but it's not this letter
[1:31:11] do you know what I mean it's not I
[1:31:14] believe that what this says you know
[1:31:16] what I mean because that's the intellect
[1:31:18] side but like our brother said tonight
[1:31:20] our our faith is in the fact that God is
[1:31:25] present with us to bring that to pass
[1:31:28] and so our faith is in in that presence
[1:31:33] and we we preach that here but I'm
[1:31:36] beginning to feel that that's what we're
[1:31:39] running from
[1:31:40] you know we're running because he said
[1:31:42] the reason that that that uh
[1:31:47] uh Jonah ran is because he didn't feel
[1:31:50] it would come to pass
[1:31:53] he was afraid just like what you said he
[1:31:55] was a he was afraid it wouldn't come to
[1:31:58] pass but God's got to make sure it comes
[1:32:00] to pass you know it's got to happen and
[1:32:03] and so we we keep talking about a
[1:32:06] Revival but we don't want a Revival
[1:32:09] inside these walls
[1:32:12] we want a Revival outside of these walls
[1:32:16] like the young man that brought his
[1:32:18] daughter up to church this morning he
[1:32:22] had the elbow she broke her elbow and
[1:32:26] and she seems to be well I I went to
[1:32:29] pray for her and I thought well where's
[1:32:31] the cast and it's something about the
[1:32:33] elbows not healing right and and I and I
[1:32:36] walked away I thought that girl don't
[1:32:38] have to have that operation
[1:32:40] there's something not right about that
[1:32:42] you know what I mean that of course you
[1:32:45] want to say I think she needs to get a
[1:32:48] second opinion but but that's where you
[1:32:50] want to see God
[1:32:52] you know and you got it you if if he
[1:32:55] brought you're right he'll go with you
[1:32:57] because that was the promise I'll be
[1:33:00] with you even in you till the end the
[1:33:03] works that I do shall you do also and
[1:33:06] even greater than these work because I
[1:33:08] go into my father right and so when all
[1:33:12] that can start to become a reality to us
[1:33:15] that just like he said like the god that
[1:33:18] we have is
[1:33:20] is there
[1:33:22] he's got to make those promises come to
[1:33:25] pass in somebody's life
[1:33:29] else their words
[1:33:33] they're just thoughts they're just
[1:33:35] written words and that's never what
[1:33:38] God's been it's always been the word of
[1:33:42] God made flesh
[1:33:44] the word of God made flesh so he was the
[1:33:47] word of God made flesh so we could be
[1:33:50] the word of God made flesh the most
[1:33:52] beautiful part
[1:33:54] about I guess and I can't say it that
[1:33:57] way because every part of brother
[1:33:58] Graham's Ministry is beautiful to me not
[1:34:01] just the words he preached and the
[1:34:03] revelations that he brought but it was
[1:34:07] that he was that mature first fruit that
[1:34:12] stood there and once again we saw
[1:34:16] the Lord Jesus manifested in flesh we
[1:34:21] saw what it was that Jesus did on Earth
[1:34:25] for us
[1:34:27] even though he suffered he suffered we
[1:34:31] have to suffer with them even though the
[1:34:33] prophet went through all collect he went
[1:34:35] through he had that love that compassion
[1:34:39] that faith in the word of God and it
[1:34:43] wasn't for him yeah
[1:34:46] and I I believe in if I'm mistaken
[1:34:50] forgive me but I believe when they kept
[1:34:52] brother Billy Paul tells the testimony
[1:34:54] about brother Branham in the car if he
[1:34:57] wanted him to do something and he made
[1:34:59] mention it wasn't for me and he took his
[1:35:02] hand over and he put it over on on
[1:35:05] sister media and God's buried her life
[1:35:08] see it was a life that was so lived for
[1:35:12] others
[1:35:13] you know be checked that shoe remember
[1:35:15] and he saw that man with the coat and he
[1:35:17] stayed on the platform for hours and
[1:35:20] even the very last part of his ministry
[1:35:22] he he he his he what he was preaching
[1:35:26] was it was preached out of so much love
[1:35:29] because the people were going into such
[1:35:32] a bondage okay and and and and being
[1:35:35] Carried Away by everything and maybe you
[1:35:39] don't know this in the church history
[1:35:40] but when brother Brown was preaching his
[1:35:42] ministry all the Full Gospel businessmen
[1:35:45] and all the doors that people were
[1:35:47] opening to they were all starting to
[1:35:50] turn towards Catherine Coleman
[1:35:53] you know what I mean and wanting what
[1:35:56] she was offering they wanted the new
[1:35:58] sensation on the Block and they were
[1:36:01] leaving the word of God and and yet he
[1:36:05] he's his call was because he wanted to
[1:36:08] get these people ready for a rapture
[1:36:13] amen this I'll say it again and I hope
[1:36:16] it sinks in this is not a staying
[1:36:19] message this is a leaving message the
[1:36:22] message and the word of God is not to
[1:36:25] prepare you how to cope with every day
[1:36:29] and how to live life down here and back
[1:36:32] and and how that God will build a hedge
[1:36:35] around you so you can live here easily
[1:36:39] so you've got all these preachers
[1:36:40] preaching about God's going to build a
[1:36:42] hedge and he's going to prosper you and
[1:36:45] you can bless you and you're you know
[1:36:48] you're going to have power and and all
[1:36:50] these great things and like this is
[1:36:52] going to be a great Invincible Army I
[1:36:54] don't want to be a great Invincible Army
[1:36:56] through the to through the tribulation
[1:37:00] I want to leave
[1:37:03] and here he's just he's just preaching
[1:37:06] you know it's it's it's getting ready to
[1:37:08] leave I'm getting ready to leave that's
[1:37:11] what what's going on we're getting ready
[1:37:14] to leave and he had all those things yet
[1:37:16] he had such that love and compassion to
[1:37:20] tell the people the truth
[1:37:24] and I think that's a a beautiful thing
[1:37:28] that God proved double proved his word
[1:37:32] that it's true he sent a message and he
[1:37:35] put something in you to receive it that
[1:37:37] you would know that what that you have
[1:37:40] will get you out of here you believe
[1:37:43] that with all your heart
[1:37:45] amen amen I guess the brothers would go
[1:37:48] prepare for communion and
[1:37:52] and uh
[1:37:53] we'll we'll turn in our scriptures in
[1:37:57] our Bible for communion service and
[1:38:00] trust that the Lord will
[1:38:03] be a blessing to us
[1:38:05] and uh
[1:38:07] so is everything ready Brothers for
[1:38:10] communion already so we're grateful for
[1:38:13] that let's go ahead and stand this
[1:38:15] evening
[1:38:20] doesn't that sermon like that just make
[1:38:23] you want to do something for God
[1:38:25] it really does it sets my heart on fire
[1:38:28] I want to I want to do something for the
[1:38:31] Lord what can I do for the Lord
[1:38:33] well do what he asks you to do
[1:38:37] go into all the world
[1:38:41] and preach the gospel
[1:38:43] Lay Your Hands on the set you say
[1:38:46] Brother David can sisters lay their
[1:38:48] hands on the sick certainly
[1:38:51] they can
[1:38:52] amen there's a way to do it a humble way
[1:38:55] to do it but you can take a sister by
[1:38:58] the the hand a sinner Girl by the hand
[1:39:02] you can tell them about the good things
[1:39:04] of God and God can certainly use you
[1:39:07] there's neither Bond or free male nor
[1:39:09] female Jew or Greek but we are all
[1:39:11] Christ's and Christ is God
[1:39:14] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:39:16] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:39:19] Lord Jesus the same night in which he is
[1:39:22] betrayed took bread
[1:39:23] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:39:26] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:39:29] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:39:33] of me and after the same manner also he
[1:39:36] took the cup when he had slept
[1:39:39] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:39:44] my blood this Duty as often as ye drink
[1:39:48] it in remembrance of me
[1:39:51] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:39:54] drink this cup
[1:39:56] Ed Show the Lord's death till he come
[1:40:00] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:40:03] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:40:05] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:40:09] and blood of the Lord
[1:40:11] but let a man examine himself
[1:40:14] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:40:18] drink of that cup
[1:40:19] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:40:22] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:40:24] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:40:28] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:40:30] sickly among you in many sleep for if we
[1:40:33] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:40:38] judged let me read that again for if we
[1:40:42] would judge ourselves
[1:40:45] we should not be judged
[1:40:48] what an attribute for communion what a
[1:40:51] time just to take an honest look at
[1:40:54] yourself and take an honest look at
[1:40:56] yourself repent in your heart
[1:40:59] discern your heart your modes and
[1:41:01] objectives make it right and then eat of
[1:41:04] that cup and drink it that that breath
[1:41:07] eat it that bread
[1:41:09] for when we are judged we are chastened
[1:41:12] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:41:14] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:41:18] brother when you come together to eat
[1:41:20] Terry one for another and if any man
[1:41:23] hunger let him eat at home that he come
[1:41:25] not together unto condemnation and the
[1:41:29] rest will I set an order when I come
[1:41:33] amen let's press
