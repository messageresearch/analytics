foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign we just opened our service this morning it's a special morning this morning we have lots of mothers in our congregation and we're so happy for all the gifts they got her placed within our midst you know a mother is a special a special position [Music] shows the attribute of God and it makes us happy because we're all here by that so we just want to congratulate all the mothers this morning that the Lord just gives you strength that you use the leadership of the Holy Ghost to instruct you to lead you to continue to just pull from the attribute of God and we're just blessed what a blessed day amen that's just about our heads as we just open our service this morning precious Heavenly Father [Music] lord it's by your grace and mercy that we all could gather this morning in a place like this [Music] it's not by something that we've done or accomplished Lord it's truly by your grace alone that you called every single heart this morning individually from different countries or different cities or different places different black backgrounds Lord to unite your bride together in one place the Lord where we can sit together around Heavenly places in Christ Jesus eating around your word Lord knowing that you would come and dine with us in a generation like this and so Lord our hearts are grateful this morning we're happy we're rejoicing the Lord is our moments that we feel happy and we know that you're doing something special in our manslaughter Lord to all the mothers and Lord all that you've done for every one of us Lord we ask that special blessing upon him Lord that you just be with them that you give them a recognition day-to-day to know Lord all their hard work and all their efforts and all the things that they've put into the Lord that you would reward them Lord not on this side maybe but on the other side Lord because we know that's where our treasure is Lord where we would be able to walk on streets of gold fellowshipping with the very creator of our hearts and of our souls it's a privilege this morning to be able to sit in your present and know that this is where we find pleasure we asked this morning that you would be over your service Lord that you'd speak to us Lord that you'd be Lord with the hearer and the speaker Lord and to your songs and Lord you just give us a day of rest a day of a Rejuvenation to be able to just leave out of this place encouraged to know that you are here Lord and you truly walked with us you talked with us you showed us the way and then now we could be on fire for you we commit the service now into your hands we love you we praise you blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen man you may turn around and if you see a mother behind you in front of you tell her happy Mother's day God bless you Amen brother Mike if you want to comfort Islam reading this morning happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers you know a couple of nights ago several of us brothers were out kind of sitting and having Fellowship around the word and uh brother cosmon's backyard and we were talking about you know the patterns of God in the scripture you know we got to talking about that first Adam who uh you know that first Son of God who so represented his character and his attributes and how he willingly set aside his position you know out of an act of love to go pursue that which was lost and you know that one who had chosen a path of intellect who had chosen a path of experience who had chosen the path of a new idea over the word and yet he laid everything aside to go and get and restore her you know and in that pattern we see both the character of God represented in his son but we also see that pattern of the Salvation work that he would be about from the very beginning you know I was thinking about that as I was reading psalm 74. there's a verse in there that says this it's in verse 12. it says for God is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the Earth that's that's his work that's what he's about working salvation in the midst of the Earth and he's been doing this from of old the very oldest of time you know the very purpose for this Physical Realm is so that the Unseen might be made manifest so that that which is not seen could be seen you know it's it's kind of significant that as soon as God created this Physical Realm immediately and said it was good by the way immediately a chain of events begins is set an emotion where he can begin to demonstrate his work of redemption right off the bat the whole purpose for the Physical Realm is for him to be about a Salvation work you know he it's the very purpose of this realm it's his work you know and as we were fellowshipping brother Matthew read a quote I don't know what it is I'm sure he'll share it at some point in time but something that brother Branham said in so many words was is that God needed someone to fall he had need that there be someone that fall and require Redemption you know and he had somewhere he had to have some situation arise so that that unseen part of him in the Physical Realm could be seen for God is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the Earth this is a project he's been working on from the very dawn of time you know as we read Psalm 74 this morning we'll just kind of read the first part of that it speaks the of the work of the enemy you know that's against the people of God and against the work of God you know it says in verse 4 thine enemies Roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs similar to what Peter said in First Peter 5 8 we have an adversary that's walking about like a hungry lion seeking whom he may devour you know there's constantly he's raising his voice constantly sending out evidence and arguments and signs and reasons in the midst of his people why they should not be a part of this salvation work trying to keep them from being a part of this ancient project he speaks in verse 5 and 6 about how there used to be a time when people had great honor and great respect for the things of God contributing to his work being a participant in what he was doing and it was great respect in that and now you know there's a great effort in the world we live in to discredit the things of God to dare to tear down his work and his word to try to distract us from the Salvation work that he's about and that we're a part of you know I was thinking about that as is reading Isaiah 5 it says woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter in it if that doesn't describe the day that we're in we're all that was once honored and respected is now reviled and discredited and destroyed and all which was once looked at as evil is now lifted up as an example of heroism and good you know more than ever alternative lifestyles are being presented as alternatives to being a part of the Salvation work another idea another perspective another experience another way and all of them Trends whatever you want to call them all of them effort to try to show evidence that he's not about a Salvation work in the Earth but he which began a good work in you shall perform it isn't that right it says this in verse 2 of Psalm 74 remember thy congregation which thou Hast purchased of old same phrase in verse 12 it says that my God is for God is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth and then in verse 2 it says remember thy congregation which thou has purchased of old not five years ago not 20 years ago of old purchased in other words that there's a people a congregation somewhere in the Earth who were bought and paid for way back when he began his salvation work all this Physical Realm is doing is making known his unseen salvation work by presenting purchased and bought people as evidence of his salvation work all the way from the beginning it says when somebody begins a construction project like the one we had out here all the materials were bought and paid for and set aside ready to give evidence that there was a work about to be done and somewhere in the earth there's a people that are those building materials to give evidence of his unseen salvation work in this Physical Realm you know how many can say that there are evidence of God that he's working an unseen salvation work in the Physical Realm you know I was reading that and you know in spite of all the experiences and arguments the ideas the trends the alternative Lifestyles that would try to disprove the fact that he's about a Salvation work I don't know about you but I'm looking at a room full of evidence that he's about a Salvation work from of old and he's been waiting for a period of time to show forth the evidence that he's been about the work and the evidence is in this room so as we read Psalm 74 together I just got such a blessing out of that especially in this time of construction that we're about we're just going to read the first 12 verses of Psalm 74 this morning starting in verse 1. let's read that together oh God why hast thou cast us off forever why do thine anger smoke against the Sheep of thy pasture remember thy congregation which thou has purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou Hast redeemed this Mount Zion wherein thou has dwelt lift up thy feet unto the Perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary thine enemies Roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their incense for signs a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers they have cast fire into thy Sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land we see not our signs there is no more any Prophet neither is there any Among Us that knoweth how long oh God how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name forever why withdraw us thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom for God is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth amen amen God bless you wanted to sing this song today

be if it was not for mothers you you know you you think about the role there's a moderate place you know oftentimes I think about the encouragement you know you you may go through life and and you seem to not have a way to avoid trouble amen but mother is always there to take care of you man it seems like when the world forsake you mothers is always there to encourage you I mean when you are at the lowest you don't know I mean you are the worst that there is out there but mother is always there to find a way to encourage you and man the the bathe you when you're young and they give you food and they do all of that and and we we would not be what we are today without the mother say man we certainly want to recognize all our mothers and those and all over the world and who want to recognize we want to as the scripture would say you honor your father and mother we certainly want to honor others today when I remember whether David and pray that the Lord will bring him back safe to us amen I know there was some that were graduating this week and some that will be graduating in the future so certainly I want to congratulate them too amen certainly in your journey in your life whatever Endeavor whatever you're graduating in we pray that the Lord will be with you if one advice I could give you is whatever you do do it for the Lord amen that's the only thing that you would benefit whatever you achieve just achieve it for him amen it's my son Jonathan birthday today and sadly it's born on Mother's Day so he certainly it's a double blessing amen amen God bless you let's stand and open our Bibles this morning and we're gonna speak a little bit and hope that the Lord will give us words to speak that will be of a blessing to you let's open our Bibles we're going to read two places we'll read Revelation chapter 3 and we'll start from verse 14. it says unto the angel of the Church of laodicea writes this thing saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works I know that I know that thou are neither cold nor hot I would that were called or heart it says so then because thou are lukewarmed neither neither cold nor hard I will spew thee out of my mouth because that saith I'm rich and increased with good and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked our counsel need to buy me to buy of me gold tried and Fire that thou may have be rich and it says and and white Raymond Remnant that thou may have be closed and that the shame of the nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that that may have seen it says as many as I love I chase him be zealous therefore and repent it says behold I stand at the door and I knock and if any man hear my word my voice and open the door I will come in I will come in I will come into him and will sup with him he and me now I want to say this this is an open calling it's not through a specific it's open we're unseen it's because it was rejected by the church now he's calling forth to all that will listen to his word all that will hear his word it says to him not overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in a strong he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches before you be seated let's open a book of James chapter chapter 4 chapter 4 and verse 3. let's start from verse 3 it says ye us and receive not because ye ask amiss and that ye may you may consume it upon your lust he says ye adulterer and adulteress know ye not that friendship of the world is enmity with God who soeth therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God now I want you to see what he's letting you know there's no way you can mix these two things he's wanting you to be to have an understanding the the moment your your goals your objectives your desires are turned towards the world or the achievement of the world you are bringing yourself in a position where it's you you are in enmity with God you are being the opposing of what God is Desiring after you it says do you think that the scripture saith in vain spirit that dwelleth in US lust to Envy it says by ye give ye giveth more but he giveth more grace wherefore he said God resists the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now I want you to see this he's not doing saying do do one thing you do two things they're submitting to God and the resisting of the devil is what brings the result the two of them it says draw nigh to God and He will draw night to you he he doesn't say just sit back and relax and and everything will come to you no it says you draw nigh you make an effort you do all that is in your power to do you advance you call upon him you you show your desire you got under desperation you do that for God God will show himself to you and then he says he will draw an eye unto you cleanse Yourself clean your hands I just said God cleans your hand he said you clean your hands it says you clean your hands ye Sinners and purify your heart Ye Ye double ye double-minded amen you may have your seats this morning so I I wanna as we read to hear I I just before I can get into I want to continue we left off last time but before we we continue as we read the scriptures I I just want to uh point this out as an outset so we we are we we have this understanding I want to say this we we have been called in this generation to be Overcomers uh don't don't ever look at your life and look at yourself this morning and say well I I'm here to just contend and fight and fight and see if I will overcome no you are called to be an Overcomers the overcoming is your possession your overcoming is something that's been given to you the overcome is an ability that God is laid within your hands it's not something that we come and we wonder am I ever going to overcome is this really going to go away am I really going to be what God wants me to be no God has placed every uh uh possession God has placed every uh uh every part of his word available to you so that you can take his word and overcome it's not a matter of will I he wants you to overcome he's made a way for you to overcome and his major review Overcomer and we can only overcome if we follow the path that is laid before us so he wants says to be motivated he wants us to be engaged he wants us to look for it to seek for it you you you don't ever get an unmotivated person and trying to get him to to do something that require motivation no we we within ourselves we have when we read the word of God when we come in contact with the word of God the word of God has to motivate us the desire that lies within us for us to move forward and as we read last time we'll read it again he's not trying to just push you through no he's warning you when you read the word of God you consider your situation you say that I have been made to overcome I'm not made to dwell in the setting that I am now I'm going to take the word of God and overcome so we as we said the scripture will tell us that they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not so they love not the lives unto death now I want you to to think that and because oh I was so much happy with the tape that we listened on Wednesday that the perfectionist because he overcame for us he offered what was required for us to be clean he offered what was needed the very sacrifice God himself making a law God himself requiring Perfection and the prophet comes behind and says God cannot require Perfection unless God himself can offer perfection oh I love of that kind of God we we are not here fighting ourselves and trying to prove something for ourselves no we are here to take what he has already done for us so if he requires Perfection he offered Perfection now we may be perfect he offered a perfect word he offered a perfect sacrifice that whosoever will come and will believe what was given to him that he may walk with confidence in his heart that job that I have done what the Lord has asked me to do and therefore I am perfect what made job perfectly wasn't that he didn't commit any sin he didn't do any wrong but what made him perfect the prophet will tell us is because what God required for sin job offered it what what God required for for for the wrongdoing job offered it and when he offered it he can stand there with a clear conscience knowing that I have done what the Lord is required of me so therefore it's the blood that says before us it's the blood that's been offered for us and by the word of their testimony God wants you to have a testimony this morning let me say this this is not a religion of our grandfather and our fathers where we come we say well God sent a messenger our parents believed it then we come behind we believe it and we say well we follow just what they told us and everything God is not a respecter of person God is not here saying that because your parents believe you are accepted in God wants to have a personal relationship with you yeah and we we have to move into these things with uh and with a clear understanding because oftentimes we come and we say well the Lord sent the prophet and he dealt with the prophet and he did this with the prophet that's wonderful but that's not good enough the same God who walked with the prophet the same God who operated in the prophet if he doesn't come and operate in you it's useless then then you you just believing to nothing we are believing unto salvation we are believing unto the things that we have need of so when we say God did with the prophet we come with an understanding now what he did with the prophet he's going to do it with me when we say the prophet was the first fruit is with an understanding oh my people get offended when you say it was the first fruit when you say that God dwelled in the prophet and he did this and he did that when you say that it was him when he turned the back that was Jesus Christ manifested but what they're failing to understand is that's the same thing he's wanting to do with you [Applause] I understand then there's a Ministry of the Prophet where he can see things and and call things that were not and and be able to see over the other side but the very same God who walked with him he's here this morning he's here this morning not to do less to do the same thing that he did with the messenger so therefore when we read this we say oh God came and he talked to him God came and he told him this God came and he changed what he wanted to preach it was not for the sake of the Prophet it was for your sake so it can come with boldness this morning and say oh if God has ever done one thing one way he's obligated to do it with every believer that comes along oh my and I want to say this to that the prophet will tell us to overcome that we need to recognize the devil and every single one of his strengths now this word is I I I I was looking it up it's so important because when he says to recognize that he therefore it doesn't necessarily mean to engage the devil to recognize the devil something is happening you see him and you recognize that this is him it's a warning through you in order for you to be guarded by the word of God it's a warning to you to see the pattern of his doing so you can look at the world around you you can see what's happening out there and saying that I am recognizing that this is what the word says will happen at the end time and I'm recognizing the pattern of the devil therefore I need to be equipped with a word because remember it says recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks but at the same time to recognize the greater we see that is in you that him that is in the world in other words the word is telling you that God has equipped you for you to overcome the devil don't ever put it on somebody else don't ever put it on the next sermon don't ever put it on somebody saying something Supernatural don't ever put it on the preacher put it on yourself and say that I have been equipped to overcome and and I want to say this regardless of your challenges this morning regardless of what we got through never ever think that the word is not enough to solve your problem because that's the trick of the enemy to cause you to doubt your weapon and then disarm you so he can get to you but oh my if you can recognize this morning that wherever I come in contact with God ordained me to come in contact with it and by ordaining me his place in me something that will overcome my situation you will be overcoming but oftentimes some happen we think I need somebody I need this I need that no it's within you it's within you for you to stand if you need encouragement we'll give you encouragement but it's within you to stand and say this is my house this is my home this is a body that God gave me and whatever is happening here he must have given me the power to overcome him so as we said last time if I could just as a way by way of a background to just get quickly to what we want to say this morning the the the the prophet will tell us that this is an evil age and Satan is the God of this evil age and you will say this is Satan's Eden that we are living in and that he brought that he built it through knowledge civilization and education that he made all the things that we see if you can excuse me he says that's the time and that's the time that we're living in and everything around us as we said is the work of Satan and it's designed to keep you distracted and away from the word of God and I would say this that's why religion can never work Satan is the creator of religion so he takes the word of God he takes what God has given he removes the sincerity out of it he removes your commitment out of it he removes every part of it that can help you and he leaves you with an empty shell oh I believe in God everybody believes in God oh I'm a Christian everybody's a Christian the question is what kind of question are you God sent a messenger there's a law that I'll take that believes God send a messenger but you see that's not come because we believe God sent the prophet that's that's full but that's not good enough what is that God done for you how is that God touching your life how is it guiding your life how is he changing you how is he walking with you what effect does he have on your life [Music] and so everything around us is designed to keep you distracted his design he's designed to keep you defeated into the things of the world and I want to say this and for most of us I want to say this he's designing to keep you chasing a carrot that you will never obtain everything is an opportunity oh you can become this you can do this you can do this well if you can't just want to do this you can combine all three you can do this and we keep chasing and you get to this it's not good enough and you get to this you think oh now I finally made it man creates something that just invalidates your job completely we we are not made to be successful like the world and if we keep going after that we will never win we will never be Overcomers in that because it's designed to keep you chasing something that you will never obtain and I want to say this as long as there is no desire in you to obtain your predestinated Victory you are in good terms with the Devil as long as life for you for me when I wake up is how am I going to get to braid I'm going to eat the next day and that's good enough for me and no spiritual motivation on something on I I was talking with the brothers where when I when I travel and and you realize it mostly and people have Ambitions you know they want to create and do big things in and when you get to a country to a place where there's two there's so many opportunities you want to just take all that you can and I say this I said it's important as Believers we have to understand that your job is not your purpose God didn't create you so you could just have a job feed your family and go on and build houses and do this and make more money and save more and do all of that we heard it I believe couple of Wednesdays ago when brother Paul preaching came here he said the the man says I will beat build a bigger barns because I have more money I have more debt God came behind it says you fool tonight I will require of your soul so we need to come with an understanding that your first purpose on Earth is for you to be worshiping God is for you to be pleasing to God your job is only a position in some place that God placed you so you can witness about him we have that backwards we do all that we can to get a dollar let me say this God can change your job but your position will never change he can place you here and say well you know I have a need of you because I have somebody here that I need you to talk to he can move you whenever he wants so you as a child of God you have to rely on God to know that if he's doing this he's doing it for my good where I end up in this world is not what matters to me what matters to me is I have fulfilled the purpose for which I have placed I've been placed here on Earth and don't don't let the dollar becomes your chasing or what you desire to become and I want to say this that the enemy's desire was to build a better Kingdom the Michael he since the beginning he just seemed to have it he wrapped him the wrong way that God will come in will take you and he will place you up in some position and and him who seemed to have been doing a lot seemed to have not been given that position he he didn't he wanted to exalt himself above the stars of God that has been his purpose so everything that he created everything that we see around the world everything that we encounter every day works to that same purpose that he had in the beginning he hasn't changed so we we can look at something and think it's an opportunity it's the devil always wanting to worship himself put himself above the stars of God his goal is to build the faithless kingdom of people that don't rely on God that rely on him and as long as we don't desire the reality or the real thing of God Satan is okay with us it's fine you're not burning for something you're not Desiring or working towards a goal and objective to see God Prosper to see God save your family to see God save people to see God move in our midst to see God accomplish and fulfill the purpose that he prayed us here you don't have that in your heart Satan is good with it and I want to say this we we once to be he wants you to be without faith but we understand the Bible will tell us that without faith we cannot please God without faith because the scripture says they now come to God must believe that he is and there is a rewarder of them that seek after him so without faith there's not even a connection between you and God let me say this there is not enough religion there's not enough psychology there's not enough men working that we can generate to be pleasing to God it's only by faith it's only by The Word of Promise I want you to be God wants you to acknowledge and and I had this I want to say this but what I'm says it's an age of deception it says it's not even that it's sinful it says people who live clean life they don't do any wrong they don't do this they don't do that but still haven't got it so when we talk about the deception and what the devil is after it's important we realize that to what extent that's why I'm so happy for the message of the hour because it's here to show the devil at every degree that he walks in so we we cannot just come here and be satisfied say when I go to church and I do this and I do that and be satisfied no you have to be in the will of God you have to be in the message that is sent for the time you have it says is to let the life consistently flow in you the moment you get cut off you start to die you start to wither you start to go you become that like that that chunk of tree that he talks about that was floating in the water but it was rotten why because it was cut away from the life of the source of the life itself and I want to say this but God made a provision for your Victory because it says in his word in every generation God has a predestinated people that will hear his word God as a people today and I want to say it and he knew that when he was send his word into the end time you will hear it and you will accept it he knew what effect the word will have upon you he knew when you hear the voice of the messenger when you will come and you will play that tape and you'll hear the message and you will hear the preacher preaching that word something within your heart will identify with what he's doing that's your identification in the end time so if there's nothing inside of you that for the word of God then you will never achieve it because I want to say this remember there's a lot of people that hear the same same thing that you hear and it means nothing to them the prophet says this in a message the God of this uh God who is rich in Mercy paragraph six he says you can talk to people sometimes on the street and talk to them about the Lord they like they laugh right at your face think about it and then he says well you're supposed to do it anyhow but listen there is no man can come to me except my father draw him first it says God has to do the drawing then it has to do the drawing to do the drawing there has to be a life and all that he had given me will come listen to this it says he made a provision for who for those who wants to be redeemed now he he yeah he is he's saying it's not just saying that for those that were going to be redeemed no for those who wants to be redeemed and then he made a provision for those who wants to be healed and then because he did this it makes him a rich in Mercy has he always been re being rich in Mercy and they must be if you refuse it there is nothing left but judgment because sin must be judged so we we cannot come not come swooning and laid upon God and say well because God didn't do God is not against you for being a sinner God is not against you from being what you are or what you were born and whatever the world did of you but God is condemning you because when he sends you away for you to get out you didn't use it so this morning I I want us to understand that the provision is there but there is a partner we need to be playing the provision the saving is there the healing is there the Deliverance is there but God wants us to get under a certain condition he wants us to approach him with a sincerity in our heart he wants us to come under a certain directive that he has provided in order for us to obtain what is given us so in other words but the prophet will tell us that God is a free he made us a free moral agent he's not going to take you by the neck and say you're going to do this you're going to do this no but inside of you he's placed something that he knows to the truth said that when you hear his word you're going to want to do it oh I'm so glad I want to do it let me say this choice is not a bad thing all you need to do is choose him use your choice for him say that he chose me I'm choosing him he died for me I'm giving my life for him oh don't look at choices and oh my God it's so terrible no oh let me tell you this at the end the celebration will be for what he has done for us I was a sinner but he made a way for me to accept him and I had chosen him now let me say this Dutch is your identification for this overcoming power without that you are no different from the person that's walking down the street at least he knew he plays something that desired to see him come to your life hey this is going to be a little bit lengthy but let me let me read this but when I'm speaks in the audition Church Hage listen to what he says here it says in paragraph uh 360 and one it says Revelation 3 21 to him that overcomes our grant to sit with me in my turn even as I overcame and set with down with my father in his throne it says now why it says what are we to overcome he says this is this is the normal question to ask here but it's not the actual thought that the of of this verse for it is not so much what what we are to overcome but how we overcome it says this is logical for this does it matter it does it does it matter match what we are to overcome as long as we know how to overcome now I love this this is inclusive this is not uh it's accounting for your special circumstance because the devil is designed he specializes in making you unique to everybody yeah your circumstance doesn't match anybody in the Bible your circumstance no yeah that woman at the well but you you have gone a little bit further than that you have done this but here's the prophet telling you it doesn't matter what it is and and brothers and sisters in order for the word to be helpful to us we have to take it as a prophet gives it to us we cannot try to add our own interpretation or our own mind or our own deduction so here he's saying it's not what you overcome so it doesn't matter this morning what the need is what I need to know is how am I going to overcome it and we overcome by the word of God the word is sufficient for all our needs oh I tell you this the devil always tries to make that insufficient and every time he comes he wants you to find something else he wants you to leave the word and go because he knows the moment to leave the word you are no longer under protection so you keep telling him like you've told him before I am not moving whatever circumstance I'm in I'm still standing on God's word nobody has ever been sick with us good the word will do it let me say this the word is the only thing that will create bring into existence the prophet will say this it says all isn't it so something it says I find it strange children of God who were created to be at the image of God who are created to speak into existence things that are not he will say I mean I'm paraphrasing it he says they were made to call things that were not as though they were and to call things that are as though they were not God giving you the ability to change your circumstances yeah and let me just jump ahead and it's okay I guess I'll say this that's what Jesus did the prophet tells us this he said you with your faith you have you have been given the power to create your own world and live in it in other words when Satan offers you a word that's full of problem you take that you create a new word out of it you said I will not take the sickness that you're giving me I will create healing in myself you you say I'm not saved I take the word and create saving with it that's what the children of God are made to do [Music] we are not made to lose our minds and go under what am I going to do now what's the word for if God brought their creation by the word how are the children of God going to bring in terms of circumstances no we want uh we want to go read the the seven steps to uh fixing ourselves the 10 steps to the deliverance and the 12th step two how to fix our relationships what are you doing what are you doing don't walk away from the only thing that can save you right say the word is good enough well no matter what say the word is good enough no matter what you bring it to me I have the word to change it and give it back to you you'll be that and I say this that's the extension of God's word when you go out into the world somebody brings you their trouble you're not supposed to head to the trouble you take the trouble and create a new word for them [Music] [Applause] why you have been given the power and I say this morning use it don't walk around and people somebody comes with frustration and oh my you it's easy to just pile on it they say I know I know me too that's what we often do but if you could just stop one moment and say listen I have been given a power to create a new world to create a new circumstance to change the atmosphere I can take that I can take you your requests I can take whatever you're going through it and speak the word and we'll create something new for you that's the power for children of God oh my and now he says we'll continue tonight so just forgive me I'm still on the introduction and then he says a quick look at those scriptures which were involved in the Lord Jesus Christ overcoming will bring you out the truth of the position Matthew 4 says wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptation Of Satan by the word and by the word alone now who could have just said by the word he wants you to be certain it's by the word and by the word alone don't add anything to it don't take it away that's what we do all the time the word is given to you you add a little bit and you do you know you make it and then it doesn't work you wonder why it didn't work the word is given to you you take away and you wonder why it doesn't work take it as he gave it speak it like he's giving it to you don't add anything don't say my circumstance is special no he said it is good enough [Music] it says in each of this three uh major trial that correspond exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden now he sums it up everything Brothers if you could put it I'm okay with it just put it he says in he says the lust of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life it says Jesus overcame by the word so he's telling you as humanly as we can speak all of our our trials all of our Temptations are included in this three so he's he's sum it all up he says if I add All That You Are everything they'll ever come across all that you can come across he says he overcame by the word Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word so the the the the the the the what we need to capture from what he's saying here is that they really what the devil's final uh uh uh conclusion of you what he's trying to do to you it's just trying to get you to move from the word nothing else if it could just get you to move off the word if we can just get you to if we can introduce just a little bit of that way you could say I don't know if the word will do it that's enough for him but oh if we can stand steadfast unmovable on the word of God and know that whatever my situation is God is overcome for me and then I says and Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word so whether it be this side or that side it's too by the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now it says let me say this to you let me say that the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that we can uh that we can if we are Overcomers because the word can fail people move and they they are okay to stand up on things that the devil can you use at any time I don't want to build my life on that you know why people are afraid that if you say something and you don't have the move and everything then it's not right that's not true if what we are saying is the word then we have nothing to worry about then I'm not putting myself out there I'm putting the word I don't I'm not building a reputation for myself I'm putting the word and if we are wrong we humble ourselves to the word so the word becomes the center thing of our Gravity the things that moves Us in and out and and we can walk oh my the children of Israel when God called uh Joshua to come and re and and take the children of Israel past Jordan the prophet will tell us that the word had to go first he says that the priest God will line up the priest and they will have them put the the their Ark of the Covenant and the children of Israel will send a certain distance why because he never wanted them to be confused who was doing the work he won and he says the priest's feet will touch the water first with the Ark of the Covenant on there and as they touch the water the water will be parted and you will go in you will pick up a revelation a stone under there something that is hidden under there that you will keep as a memorial of what God did for you no today we want to run before the word we want to do this with the word we want our own reputation to go that's not going to work what God wants us to do is to let the word go before us because it's the word that overcomes for us he says so let me say this he says this now notice again how Jesus overcame the world system of religion when it was repeatedly repeatedly budget by the Theologian of his day he constantly applied the word he expect the the respect only what the father given him to speak there was not a time when the world was not uttered utterly in confusion in confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God it says in his own personal life contending with himself I want you to listen to this Jesus contending with himself he overcame by obedience through the word of God you say Jesus contending with himself yes brother remember we said last time the high priest of your confession everything that you go through he had I thought about the Garden of Gethsemane yeah he is but when I'm calls it is the greatest victory he said father I see your plan but is there a way that I could step aside from the word and let this God pass by me but he said nevertheless let it be not my will but your will be done so after he contended with himself he placed himself right back in the word he said your will be done in other words he was stripped of any power any other means by which any other ability any other because if he went by his own ability you wouldn't have never been able to come in so he had to use something that when he gives it to you you can do the same thing and the only thing that could do that was the word he says this in Hebrews he says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered our prayers and supplication was strong crying it is unto him that was able to save him from Death from from death and and and and heard uh and heard in that in that he feared he says though he was a son yet Elaine obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto them that obey him says what was he obedient to the word of God it's so simple but yet we miss it a million miles when Matthew was talking to him last time he mentioned we have but when them will say yes Jesus after his strip of all things he goes through the cross by a prophecy of a backslider prophet that's what he uses you couldn't find one no because it wasn't about the prophet it was about the word if that Prophet spoke by God inspiration it didn't matter it was the word of God so let he goes to show you that it doesn't matter how low it is God will still honor his word don't we have enough proof don't we have enough to walk to walk why do we step aside why do we struggle with ourselves why do we wonder why do we go aside here is proving over and I can go over and over again and continue to hammer the same he's keeping saying it's the word don't get the emotion don't we'll concentrate on this don't concentrate on that come back to the word come back to the word why because that's the overcoming formula blueprint that we have been ended on now listen to this it says now paragraph 366 it says 360-6 it says now down there will be no one person who will sit on the turn with the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fasting your perseverance no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting on that throne that's why I spend a little bit of time just trying to show it's not what we come up with it's not anything it's where you will beat into the word you will say as simple as that and then it says it says it will be granted only through the word bride word bride it says as the Throne of the king he shared with the queen because she is United went to him so only they who are off that word off that word even as he is off that word will share the throne and let me say this it's important we realize why this is very important that we overcome by the word because remember part of the sitting of the turn the prophet will tell us this Throne is only given to the Overcomers and and and the only way to overcome the the purpose for the overcoming is God is trying to build a character in you that is fit for you to be sitting on the throne if you don't ever overcome then you don't have the character it says character doesn't come by uh uh uh it's not a gift it's a it says character it's something we gain by going through something it's an experience it's something that you you go through God is not looking for some uh uh uh uh a baby to sit upon the throne he's looking for a mature bride somebody with an understanding somebody who knows what it means to be defeated but it means he knows what it means to be overcomer you you you're not gonna sit on the throne with no idea what it means to be overcome then those that you're going to be judging will come back and say tell me when you overcame do you know what it means to be in my situation so it has to take somebody who has been in the situation of those that will come before the throne and that has also been on the other side to say I know what it means to be in your situation but I used to work to overcome it we look for the adoptions of sun and adoption is only based on characters obedience to the word there's no place where it says well if you just been good it should have been this no it's always attached to the obedience to the word it's not looking for a baby to sit on the throne God is looking for immature bride someone who's battle tested somebody who knows who has the scars who knows what it means to go through battle and Gary as it says it says and if the children and then if children then Heirs of God and join that with Christ if we be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together I reckon that the suffering of the present time is not whether to be compared with the glory that we shall be revealing US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him it says you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering oh my not a free gift is made through suffering and then he says character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule now we understand the requirement for the throne is we need some character development and that's why the surgery say thank you not strange this trial affection that comes upon you but to punish you it's not God is mad at you but it's molding you into something God is wanting you to sit on the throne and let me say this the more the trial the more you need it so you have to be on the throne every time what if we were to look at everything that happened to us and says my I'm getting close to the throne I'm just saying you see what human Minds does to you they always thinks you're the opposite way you always mean I must have done something wrong I must have done something wrong I might sit down what if you can look at your sins hey oh I'm getting to the throne this is the path that he stating before me he's getting ready for that place I will use this experience for somebody who will need it this is for me to go through so I can help somebody else this is for me to go through so when I sit on that Throne I am a righteous judge I can just be I can judge people righteously be righteous if you have no idea what righteousness means or if you've never been through it oh my isn't the word beautiful and then it says and since he put us to share even is thrown on the same basis that he overcame and sat down with his father's Throne then we have to overcome to situa not there's no other way around it's the only way we have to overcome to sit with him and it says and the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that will be revealing us when he comes it says oh what treasure are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation we this Christian life is not called to be a bed of ease where everything is good and we get along just fine and someone speaks you understand oftentimes somebody could say something that they didn't mean any harm and somebody gets offended it's full of valleys and mountains and all those things but you have to understand that the totality of those things is so that God will place you will build you up so you could be ready for what he has to do if the musician could come we read this last time the prophet said see God could not push you through a little pipe put you out on the other end and then say blessed is he not overcometh now that makes more sense right now so sometimes you have to go all the way around to say the same thing you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respect to God we'll continue this afternoon but when I'm says this I want to end with this it says now Jesus told us how to do it to overcome means to stand a test that's right like the sense of all dead like Jesus did amidst of all the enemy he stood the test it says everything he was tested against he stood he stood it and the face of sickness he became a him being the Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought back life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the what he says why by the word says you destroyed this Temple and I'll raise it up again in three days the word said so see in the presence of death he defeated it he overcame death in the presence of hell and he defeated hell and overcame it yes he says in the presence of the Grave he overcame the grave of why all by the word in humility it says oh my there's a real man there's one to make your example he defeated everything overcame it you know the world has a very skewed definition of a man is one who can provide his own bread and who can work until his fingers fall off and do everything by himself and don't help him if your help him isn't you know his men would comes a little bit down and he just needs to be you know like a just like a brick you know never get tired never do anything never Desiring but let me say this a real man to God is one who completely relies upon God for everything how many believe Jesus was real man we read it here he relied on God 100 percent 100 percent what is that even equal to you like he woke up he wanted to take breath he relied on God I mean I don't even know how to get it in my own life but in everything it did he relied on God but one of them says in perfect Faith he relied on what God made him what the scripture said he was three of us rely 100 percent of God now if we're going to be Overcomers we need to really take a deep look within ourselves because we are in the battle and and the reason why we may not be making progress as we should is because of this little things and I'm not here trying to preach the seals and the opening and the whole because all of that if he doesn't translate into this it's not needful if this cannot solve our human problems one with another to cause us to sit down and talk our differences over to cause us to look at one another differently to cause us to solve our human problem how are we going to get over there what are the seals for this is done so it could be translated into that power remember we read brahmanam says he spoke it was the wisdom of God and it was confusion to them I think we need to speak confusion to the world but it tells you something you speak something totally different that creates a new something and the whole confused about it the word is made to swallow up remember there was nothing everything that existed came from the word it was given Jesus came to take your sin so he can give you righteousness and in doing that he imparted some of that same attribute to you you have a problem swallow up your problem bring out some righteousness out of you it's somewhere in there I believe by the word of God it's somewhere if it wasn't in there you wouldn't have been sitting here this morning you're sitting here because it's somewhere in it's calling out and we'll get to that tonight it's calling out and often time it's good enough for the word we fill it up with all kinds of things we fill it out with our own knowledge where the works and whether this and with that we're failing to understand that it's calling out for more of God foreign I say this morning let the world take preeminence in our lives isn't that the purpose why he revealed himself those are not three separate purposes he reveal so he can come and have preeminence by having praying preeminence then he can take us right back to what we were in the beginning God bless you it's all standing this morning [Applause] amen amen let's just sing night this morning oh and life is [Music] oh when you're down oh and on Earth's face [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my God [Music] that's where your face [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] and he's gone you make them right inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
