for the opportunity to bring them to you we ask you now to be our portion in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight let's turn in our bibles real quick over to malachi and read a little scripture and just going to have a time of a fellowship this evening and and and as peter would say we want to stir up our our faith and our pure minds by way of remembrance and uh just uh uh it's always good to go back and and know your purpose and and what it is we're doing here and why that we're here and and why that were chosen and elected so let's read this great scripture found in malachi the fourth chapter and the fifth verse and and in malachi 4 and 5 it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you you may certainly be seated tonight we know that um the promises that we live in today that god promised us to send a a message or a prophet to this age and and as we heard that and we watched it and we focused on it we begin to see that god truly vindicated that this messenger was a messenger sent from god and it was the fulfillment of scripture and so and we realized that there was a purpose that god had in sending a prophet for one because the prophet's especial made person he's built a certain way he's he has uh a way about him that that god made him that god could speak to him and move him he has a a built-in uh uh i don't want to wish i had a uh better vocabulary but he has a resistance built in in him to the uh influences of man and of the world there's a way that he's made that he's kept separate so that god can speak to him he's got an acute sense for uh the spirit and and and because of that gift in the way that he's made god can use him to deliver a message or what we would call a prophecy we oftentimes refer to this as the message of the hour but i sincerely believe that we could call it the prophecy of the hour that that god was prophesying and and speaking of things that are soon to be it wasn't just a a message like something that we would gather a fact or we would gather some information and then the information was given to us that we could make decisions and we need those messages those are good you get a lot of messages in the mail you get a lot of messages nowadays on your phone uh people call you up i just got a message today that one of you stayed at the marriott hotel and because one of you stayed there they wanted to give me a free vacation because you must have given them my name and i i thank you for that but i'm really not interested in and uh something that's free from a place that i've always had to pay there's got to be there's got to be a catch somewhere and so but we're not talking and and i'll just want to lay this down just a little bit tonight as we just have a little bit of of fellowship so we're not talking about a message that was a message of fact or of information we're talking about a message that's a message of prophecy in other words they've told us of things that were going to be it told us of the conditions that were coming it told us of what to expect it told us of the decline it told us of a decline of morals and the decline of man it told us of the conditions and atmosphere that would start to surround us okay it wasn't a message of fact it was a message of eyesight it was a light it shall be light in the evening time it was the message so that the path to glory you shall surely find that the message and the prophecy was sent that the son of perdition could be revealed and that the enemy would be would be uh exposed in every one of his tricks and and that's what a overcomer is an overcomer is someone that recognizes the enemy in every one of his tricks and if you didn't have the prophecy of the trick or the prophecy of the deception then you would never perceive it or look at it and sometimes that's what we've been talking about is we can't let the message become what we call academia or or a bible study so to speak or or just study in the history of it we have to understand that the message that was sent for us and stored up for us was living prophecy just like the old testament those prophets they prophesied and they prophesied and they prophesied in the scribes and everybody wrote them down and they referred back to them but they never understood them as something that one day had to come to pass and that's what jesus rebuked them for he said you search the scriptures because in them you think they have you have eternal life but they are which have been testifying of me and so we have a great witness so great a cloud of witness around us because we've seen the things that have prophesied come to pass so many things that we've noticed lately when we go back and read we almost are astounded because there they're spoken and there they're spoken many times we've sat together uh here in the assembly and we've played a a portion of of something that brother branham had preached and it seems so revel uh relevant to the moment that we're in it's so descriptive of where that we are so not only was he describing the time and prophesying of the time and of the condition and of the world at the same time he was also prophesying of a church he was prophesying of a believer he was prophesying of sons and daughters that would come upon the scene he was prophesying of what uh of what that he would have formed he said in the lady osea age he says behold i stand at the door and knock. if any man opens it up i will come in with him and i'll sup with him and i'll eat the evening meal with him in other words i will break bread with him and he is the bread that came down from heaven so can you base so he's saying if if you open up and you enter into this fellowship with me i will share myself with you amen that's what communion is he says my uh it's it's meat indeed and and bread indeed it's life the word of life so the very communion that he promises is the communion of himself with you and he prophesied of a union he prophesied of a union that would take place an invisible union it's not invisible to us it's only invisible to the unbeliever in other words it was an invisible union to those that didn't recognize it or didn't know the day or didn't know the hour do you know jesus was invisible to the scribes and pharisees he was invisible to them they didn't see him as being the son of god they didn't see him act as being the savior they didn't see him as as having resurrection life and that he was going to pay the price at calvary in order that this eternal life that he possessed that could now be transferred and shared with man that they could rise to they didn't see it the messenger said if they would have seen it they would not have crucified him but they were blinded to him and and that's what the scripture said their eyes were blinded in this case man's blind miserable poor wretched and naked so in other words this union that's fixing to take place between the the the christ the uh the savior the the son of god the second adam and this union that he is going to have with this eve is prophesied but yet it's invisible you can't show somebody something that they don't see the scripture says can the blind uh lead the blind won't they both fall in the ditch so they don't know but it's it's given to you they asked jesus why do you speak in riddles why do you speak in parables he says because it's not given to them to know these things he says that with their lips they do worship me but their hearts are are far from me and so we find that today so again we say this because it's important to us that we understand the privilege that we are participating in and and what it is that's been prophesied to us that we're going to be a partaker of because it not only did it prophesy the con condition of the world but it and the positioning of the world it also prophesied of the positioning of the bride and the message of the hour came to position the bride into a condition and into a place that made them uh ready and and and able i like that word and able to participate in a transformation from this life to the next and and it had to be we read the quotes uh to a sunday morning that that it's that the church has got to pull itself up into faith and so we we looked that that there there had to be a restoration of faith now when we talk about a restoration of faith this statement moved on my heart for the next few minutes as we just fellowship because this faith is prophesied to you i will restore saith the lord i will restore back the faith of the fathers the hearts of the fathers i'm going to give this the children of this gospel the children of the ministry of elijah i am going to give them this same faith that the fathers had the faith that said silver and gold have i none but that which i have i give to you the faith that that wrote the book of acts the faith that saw the spirit move uh upon cornelius and elk and saw the spirit move upon the centurion that that saw the the spirit of god through the words of men produce wonderful results and so we realized that this faith that uh is it is being restored to us that it's given to us to understand faith in a different light than it it's been perceived before it faith so many many times it's it is something that we struggle to get because we don't understand it but you you are believers and so we want to talk just a few little things about faith tonight and uh uh just to make it uh encourage us is the the word that we say because satan always wants to tell us we don't have faith because with faith all things are possible and he also always wants us to think that there's something that we have to uh produce and it the prophet of god talks about uh a farmer that went out and he takes a seed and he takes the corn seed or what seed it might be and he plants it and and he he he sits there and he plants the seed he says now he doesn't go out the next day and dig it back up to see if it started to grow he he doesn't go back and and dig it up to find out if uh if it's got any uh sprouts or or anything he lets the seed do its work you understand so the word of god will do what it said it would do you've just got to let it do its work because it's a promise so in other words god said that he'd call out a people he'd separate out a people he said he'd restore back the faith of the fathers to them you can't take that seed and hurry it along you can't take it up and open it up and say i know you're in there hurry up come out you can't sit out there in the field with a picture and pour in water and a hair dryer and you're gonna make it know if the seed is built in the power of transformation is in that seed if it if it's just let it do its work and so you have to understand that the message of the hour was a seed it was given to you it was it's a free gift of god that was given to you the preacher can't make it work he can't force you up to a higher ground he can't do it's going to work just exactly according to god's time it is not going to fail god's word is not going to fail every promise that he's spoken will come to pass so you have to understand faith is something that moves now i'd like to this statement it struck me it said and if i could read it here he says he says i am that i am he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i in myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god was in him the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest now understand this when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest as you are a believer now we get so far ahead of the program when the word of god came in you right then that was a manifestation of a promise it didn't mean the word of god would come in you and now you're going to do all these works and all these works and all these things the very fact that the word came to you was a fulfillment of prophecy it was a manifestation my sheep hear my voice another they won't follow all that the father hath given me will come blessed are the ears of those that hear the truth look when the word came to you and the lord came into your life that was a manifestation that was a planting of a seed that meant that that seed was now going to continually work towards what it was planted for and so he goes on to say this it's manifest as you are a believer see a believer is the faith of god that moves in you now this is something that i think that is so important that we comprehend faith is not a stationary belief it's not stationary another i believe this and i believe this and i believe this and i believe this this is what we believe that was the curse of dogmas and doctrine it became a stationary belief i said this is what we believe we don't look here and say i believe that uh william branham was a prophet of god and and that belief stays there in history as a stationary belief no because it was more than that because the spirit that manifested the message is the same spirit that manifests the believer if it's a faith is something that moves it's it's not a concept that's agreed upon faith moves it it moves and the reason it moves is because it moves to manifest it it moves it moves to fulfill all the word of god is promise all the word of god is promise it's the promised word of god it's the promise of a resurrection it's a promise of the kingdom is a promise of a deliverance it's the promise of healing it's everything that god said that he would do it it's a word of promise i promise you i promise you i promise you i'll not leave you nor forsake you but i'll come again i promise you i'll send a comforter i promise that i'll be there i promise you a spirit that will bring you into remembrance and the art take no thought for what you say for the spirit will be there to help you its promise its promise its promise its promise and that's what peter said he said by these exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature it's moving it gets moving faith is the the the belief he says he says and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you it's god moving in you to fulfill what was prophesied of you did you know your deliverance is prophesied you're an overcomer you might battle lust in this lustful world you you might battle against the styles and the the way that the peop women are dressed and and the things that are out there you might battle against music because it's designed to to catch that emotional beat you might battle against all kinds of things but you don't measure yourself by the things that you're battling you measure yourself by the promise to overcome you measure yourself by the spirit of god that's moving in you to fulfill that overcoming remember faith moves it's not stationary it's not a belief it's a moving being it's the spirit that moves in you to fulfill the prophecy that god spoke of you you were with him in the beginning your name was written on the lamb's book of life i love this promise i go to prepare a place for you if it were not so i would not tell you i would not prophesy for you so if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you that where i am you may be also that's a promise now how does god fulfill that promise he fulfills that promise by sending his spirit which his word and his spirit are the same thing just the devil that tried to chop him up and that worked moving in you to fulfill that promise because somebody has got to fulfill that let me tell you it's not word till it comes to pass you say wait a minute he said let there be light right so when that was manifested now we knew what that light was it's got to come to pass it's got to manifest that faith has got to manifest faith is a gift of god lift any of us through both faith isn't he isn't brought on by what we do faith is given to us so you can understand that the minute that that word came in you the minute that word came to you that was the beginning of the manifestation of the prophecy concerning you you could have been as dark as a goose lost is all get out because the scripture says you didn't choose me i chose you you didn't seek me i sought you look the minute that he sought you the minute he started dealing with your heart that was a manifestation of the word of god my sheep know my voice another they won't follow he was moving so that was the faith of god moving it wasn't okay now i i believe he was a savior i believe in some stationary bible no wonder this the word of god said the letter killeth because the letter is stationary right isn't that what you call a letter it's put on what stationary see my whole message is vindicated no you understand it's not stationary that's not what we believe in we don't believe in a dead letter we don't believe in a in a in the doctrines we don't believe in crude creeds we don't believe in something that's spoken and laid there's dead we believe in a resurrected spirit which is the spirit of jesus christ alive in our presence moving in our life to fulfill what he has prophesied and spoken of and i believe he's here doing that in the hearts of his elect [Music] now you might resist it but it won't be for long you might resist it and you might get some chastisement but he's not going to lose one all that the father hath given me will come because we understand that faith is something that moves and then he says if we just read a little bit he said he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce faith could produce when he knew what he was now if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then you know who you are ask what you will and it will be given to you now so we're we're talking about this moving faith how many understand what i'm trying to say this is a moving faith faith is the spirit moving faith is a revelation faith is the revelation of the spirit moving look in other words if you're sick can you and you read the promise of god and you know that god's a healer and that quickens you what you've got to recognize is not the substance not the stationary promise you've got to make witness and understand the spirit that's moving to bring that promise to pass that spirit's here to bring that to pass in me but as long as we're looking at old promises instead of resurrected promises i i i heard a commercial today damn it it it it just struck me it it it put me in mind of what that was on my heart yeah the commercial said thompson party of four and it was somebody in a restaurant calling out for people to come in and eat and the advertisement was those are the old days you know and that's and you can't look at the promises of god as something that's in the past the promise is nothing without the spirit bringing it to pass god promised in the scripture malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 we saw the spirit move and bring that to pass and so when when we begin to look at a spirit that's moving a faith that's moving if it's not something it's moving in you it's moving in you to get you to a place it's moving in you to perfect you it's moving in you to prepare you for a rapture it's moving in you to move out the unbelief that spirit of faith is working from god it's the spirit of god moving you sometimes that spirit corrects you praise god i recognize that as being the moving spirit the moving spirit of god is faith god does nothing without faith faith the only way that god accomplishes anything so in other words god only accomplishes things by his spirit moving so now we we we talk about substance of faith so if we know that faith is the spirit moving then how does that become a substance to me if you're being convicted by the spirit that's the spirit moving on you to bring you to repentance to correct you that it's done by the spirit so he makes this statement here he says now this same bible is the same god's word so this bible's the same god's word in other words this the word of god's been the same through every age it's been if men's eyes were opened and it was god's timing in the days of justification the days of sanctification in the days of restoration of the gift man would have come but god allowed in this day for the i sav to come upon the believer that they would see the spirit of god present with his church moving them to rapturing condition they would understand that the word of god the spirit of god is coming now to fulfill what was prophesied to the believer in this age the spirit's moving so he says this the same bible is the same god's word everybody read malachi 4 5. everybody had an interpretation of it but one day the spirit moved and we saw that spirit moving in flesh and because that spirit moved in flesh that same spirit that was moving on the prophesier with the same spirit that moved on you to receive the prophecy you couldn't have two spirits different spirits working it had to be the same spirit so before there could be a message there had to be a hearer before there could be a shepherd there had to be somebody to shepherd before that there could ever been a bride there had to be a lamb's book of life look he said it's the same word and when you can receive the substance that perfect faith the substance that this promise that god made is yours now what is the substance you can't look past the spirit the substance is you taking ownership of the promise that's the substance of faith taking ownership you know excuse me my eyes really got open to that when when uh you know well brother jackson helped me uh to see that understanding of what it means to take ownership because every time we meet he's got a list of things he wants people to take ownership of so somebody's supposed to have the ownership of the baptistry they're supposed to wash it and clean it and keep it filled so somebody owns that they've taken ownership of that they've heard the message they've heard the word they understand that's their responsibility they take ownership of that somebody else takes ownership of this and somebody takes ownership of that in others it becomes your responsibility you take ownership the substance of faith is taking ownership of the promised word not not always for miracles you know he never said i come to restore back the miracles he came back to restore back the ownership of the word of god you've got to take ownership of it you're not going to drive a car that you don't take ownership of or any other example we could use understand that the substance of faith because when you take ownership you you you say the substance that this promise that god made is yours the substance is that the promise that god made is yours you take ownership of that problem promise and when you take ownership of that promise the spirit of god comes to to move to fulfill that because you've accepted as prophecy right prophecy says this will happen so when you take ownership of that you it becomes the substance of it you begin to take ownership he says watch now he said to us if ye abide in me and my word abide in you in other words you've taken ownership of it i now take this promise to be mine now you say well wait a minute that's that seed you don't go see if it's working you don't go see where the results are you let it take its course you let the spirit of god bring it to pass you leave it alone you've taken ownership of it you've planted it just like when you plant that flower just like when you plant that something in your garden you plant it and you know that that seed has been created from god that in its time in season it's going to break forth and create a vine and have squash or watermelon or tomatoes or whatever the minute you planted it you accepted the result you took ownership of it and when you accept the seed of god in your heart and you take ownership that this promise is mine that promise within itself by the spirit of god will produce all you have to do is take ownership that's the substance this is mine he says that's your position then you can ask what you will it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer recognize you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position now you must believe what you asked for if you are a believer recognize yourself as a believer recognize that these things are for you you don't have to know the results you don't have to figure it out you don't have to have any signs or manifestations you don't have to be on a time clock you simply have taken the ownership of it that's the substance because it's not a stationary gospel once you take the seed the transformation of that seed is a moving spirit in your life it begins to move towards the promise sometimes it's got to take weeds out of your life sometimes it's got to take unbelief out but you understand once that you see that word and you see that promise first of all the spirit the word comes to you that's the first manifestation faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god you hear it you don't produce it you accept it you take ownership you say i accept this promise that it pertains to me now let it the spirit have its way let it move it will move it will do what he said he would do it cannot fail it can it it'll happen you don't you don't have to look for results you just have to know that you've taken possession you've got to know that faith is a moving spirit is not a stationary object faith is continually moving continually moving faith is moving towards the resurrection faith is moving toward the rapture the faith that was restored by malachi 4 5 to the elect lady is a faith that's moving like the magnet it's sweeping the people up it's taking them to the promises of god it's fulfilling everything that he said preparing them for rapturing condition so we see that that great faith and and and we'll kind of close with with that tonight and because you know then you can go back and he says this so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean the substance of faith now what's the substance the taking ownership of the promise when a man lives by the fact that he's taken ownership of the promise now he's letting the spirit move to bring that to pass he's not bringing it to pass jesus said i can do nothing without the father showing me you you don't have to produce the result you planted the seed the spirit will move that seed will come to pass when you walk with that kind of substance this is what he's talking about a people that take possession of the promise they possess the enemy's gate by taking the possession of the promise and closing any thing that anybody would say that's what abraham did god promised him a son he took possession of the promise regardless of the circumstances and what was attributed to him for righteousness get this because it's the same thing that's attributed to you for righteousness that the god that made the promise was able to perform that which he promised hallelujah that's simple why do we get the mirror in the picture why do we get the flesh it's all promised it's all what he said you've just got to have the substance that it's yours i am a part of this bride prove it he said so well i am to know you're a snake so what this is a first snake that's going to be raptured i don't care what you say my my righteousness is his filthy rags anyway he's the one that performs it if the spirit gave it to me if i heard it and i had ears to hear the substance of my faith is not the works i produce the substance of my faith is accepting the ownership that it was that's what he said the substance of faith is you saying these promises are yours all he wants you to do abraham tried to do it himself and we have the middle east i i don't think that's what we got right abraham tried to botch it every way he could he lied picture that poor king he's an upright man i like how brother branham says it here comes 85 year old sarah into town little old granny and here's this king and he says oh she's fair and beautiful beyond imagination because a promise has transformation in it do you hear me a promise has the transformation in it you accept the promise you're accepting the transformation that goes with promise promise has transformation in it and he lies he says who's this beautiful woman my sister liar liar he flat out lied and the king preps for wedding and everything at least celebrating everything he goes to sleep and the angel lord comes to me says you're dead he says why am i dead i've always lived upright she's your dead man you might as well go measure your casket you're out of here you're history why what did i do you're going to marry another man's wife he told me it was his sister yeah you better go have him pray for you why why the power was in the promise the transformation was in the promise the keeping power was in the promise all you have to do is take possession of it not only that the king went he he's went and had him pray for me he prayed for him then the king dumped all kinds of treasures on it you tell me that program i like that program don't you you accept the promise you think he did it once he did it again but what was imputed to him for righteousness the substance we act what we're lacking remember he said they didn't have the faith to make the promise work because they didn't accept it as being theirs oh church do do we want to move up higher do we want to get in rapturing faith then we've got to recognize ourselves because he says when you when he says when you have faith and walk by faith i mean the substance of faith when you walk by the acceptance of the promise letting the spirit of faith move to manifestation he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there's now you're getting in to bride material see you're getting in to rapturing condition and then because faith and love is a relationship we won't stay there but we'll move to this last statement tonight because we're talking about a faith that moves now how many understand that we are getting ready for the rapture there's nothing else on the agenda for us and i preached last sunday the only reason that god promised to restore the faith and the works that i do you shall do also is because by these works you know that that spirit is moving and that's what gets you into rapturing condition because if it doesn't manifest then what is it it's letter but if you start seeing the resurrection life manifesting itself in your life you see the resurrection power doing signs and wonders you see the resurrection power healing you see the resurrection power delivering what you're seeing is as you're seeing those promises fulfilled and you're seeing the spirit do it if you can't see the spirit moving that's what the world couldn't do they couldn't save william branham standing there as a man and then know that when he called out the people and the discern their thoughts and intents of the heart turned his back to the audience raised the dead that wasn't william branham that was the spirit of god deity veiled in flesh moving fulfilling a promised word that same spirit has got to move in you in the eye so as we gain evidence and experience and see these things maybe you're battling cigarettes why not see the power of the resurrection deliver you from them cigarettes that's just as great as raising the dead hallelujah maybe you got bitterness in your heart towards somebody maybe you got just a problem just talking you know being a listener is just as bad as being a talker takes two of them to make it gossip wouldn't it be the power of the resurrection starting to deliver you from burdens delivering you from depression delivering you from selfishness delivering you from lustful spirits delivering you from anger delivering you that's the same power of the resurrection because that's being delivered from death that's the same thing as resurrection it's wonderful and the more you experience that the more it becomes real to you okay and the more you say is that important jesus sent him out sent him out and told him go pray go do this what was he trying to do if i could excuse my expression but he was almost prepping them and instructing them to what was going to come he wanted them to get used to the understanding of the spirit moving of them seeing what he said come to pass god wants you to begin to take possession of the promises so you can see what he said coming to pass if you can see the small things then you'll have faith for the actual transformation of your soul and your body so now as we're going down this line and and wanting to say this because this is what the prophet of god said was to measure the advancement of the church i'll see just how advanced my church is on what we believe in see just how advanced the people are how they're ready to take the sword and walk out in the front line and say doesn't that sound familiar anybody remember a message front line worker to walk out on the front line and say i challenge you satan i challenge you you can't make me disbelieve anymore what are these things done for so that the people will believe it is the word it's where that shows that i'm preaching to you the truth the word the word made flesh made flesh in you made word made life in you made life in me that the advancement of the church when they can take this moving faith of a promise and know that that same promise is given to the unbeliever and you can bring that promise to him knowing that the spirit is moving through you to bring that promise to pass go into all the world preach the gospel lay hands on the sick and they shall recover put the gun bullet in the gun fire the gun do it accept it is yours accept the commission is yours accept that god will stand behind your testimony accept that god will stand behind your word and bring your word to pass oh we're living in a wonderful glorious time of the spirit moving in his people to perform every promise how advanced is this church that they can take the promises of god and walk out on the front line and say satan i challenge you i challenge this grip you have in my life i challenge this fear that's in my heart i challenge this depression he's the same he's wonderful he loves us it's a love affair he reached down in the muck for us to prove us he loves us he brought his word to us the first sign of the manifestation of the word remember evidence of election happened even before you realized who you were that was all part of the manifestation of the word of god church the holy spirit the presence of god the person of god is here to move into this church and i don't mean this local church his church to do and perform every promise he promised for this age i believe it's manifesting time lord richly bless you the musicians would come brother billy come let's stand together and let us just bow our heads in prayer and and ask yourself do you believe the word of god says the spirit's moving so ask yourself do i want to be a part of that move do i want to get involved in that move do i want to examine myself and position myself and take my position in the move of the spirit lord what would you have me to do the prophet of god said it's like a man that's hired to do a job he said he just doesn't go sit around in the barn he goes ask his employer what would you have me to do what can i do i want your faith moving in me i want to go on the front line i want to stand shoulder to shoulder i want to be involved in the movement of the spirit of god i'm tired of being in and out and up and down i'm tired of not having any vision i'm tired of letting my flesh defeat me i'm going to take the overcoming promises of god and apply them to my life [Music] lord you're not
