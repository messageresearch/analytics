[4:27] Let's bow our heads and hearts.
[4:30] Heavenly [music] Father, Lord, we're

[5:17] hearts, Lord, asking that you would just

[5:57] is in us than he that is in the world,
[5:59] Lord. And we look to your promised word
[6:02] this evening.
[6:04] Just asking, Lord, that you do above and
[6:07] beyond what we could ask or think. We

[27:42] Let's [clears throat] open our Bibles in
[27:45] uh a book of Psalms
[27:48] uh uh Psalm uh 103.
[27:52] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[27:57] Psalm 103,
[28:01] we're going to start on verse uh 8.
[28:06] Verse 8.
[28:13] The word of the Lord says, "The Lord is
[28:14] merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
[28:18] plenches in mercy. He will not always
[28:21] chide, neither will he keep his anger
[28:24] forever. He had not dealt with us after
[28:27] our our sins, nor to water us according
[28:30] to our iniquities. For as the heaven is
[28:34] high above the earth, so great is his
[28:37] mercy toward them that fear him.
[28:40] [snorts]
[28:40] &gt;&gt; As far as the east is from the west, so
[28:42] far has he removed our transgressions
[28:45] from us.
[28:47] Like like as a father peerth his
[28:49] children, so the Lord peerth them that
[28:51] fear him. For he knows our frame. He
[28:55] remembers that we are dust.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank
[29:01] you, Lord, for uh this opportunity that
[29:04] you give us to come back and worship
[29:06] your name, Lord. Father God, certainly
[29:09] our bodies are tired, Lord. Our minds
[29:11] are tired, Lord, but we want to please
[29:14] you, Lord. And father, come and speak to
[29:17] us, Lord. And help us, Lord. Help me to
[29:21] put myself aside, Lord, that you may
[29:22] come and speak through my lips, Lord.
[29:25] Close my mouth to anything that is
[29:26] contrary to your word, Lord. And open my
[29:29] mouth to all truth and righteousness.
[29:31] And Father, that your people may be
[29:33] helped, Lord. Father, for that's that's
[29:36] the purpose of the preaching, Lord, to
[29:38] bring your children closer to you.
[29:40] Father, we [snorts] ask you for
[29:42] everything that you've done for us. We
[29:44] we thank you for everything you've done
[29:45] for us. We thank you for Calvary, Lord.
[29:48] We thank you for that sacrifice because
[29:51] without that sacrifice, we would be
[29:53] completely lost eternally, Lord. But now
[29:56] there is a bridge between this earth and
[29:59] heaven. Thank you for everything that
[30:02] you've done for us, Lord. And help us,
[30:04] Lord. Reveal your word to us one more
[30:06] time, Father. For we ask it in Jesus
[30:09] Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated.
[30:13] Hallelujah.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Pray for me.
[30:17] Too many eyes looking this way.
[30:21] God bless you. So, uh I I uh I
[30:26] appreciate brother uh David giving me
[30:29] the opportunity to speak. It's an honor
[30:31] to speak before the bride of Jesus
[30:34] Christ. Amen. It's not like you are a
[30:37] politician and you're trying to somebody
[30:39] to vote for you. He already voted for
[30:42] me. [laughter]
[30:44] So I don't have to convince anyone
[30:47] because he voted for me.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I chose you before the
[30:52] foundation of the world."
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And this morning we learned that we are
[30:56] children of the prophecy.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; What he has spoke of us, that's what we
[31:00] are.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; We we we just we just marching onto
[31:06] Zion.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And the victory belongs to the Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this um uh I I would like to
[31:13] speak a little bit about the mercy of
[31:15] the Lord and his grace. And I I would
[31:18] like to speak a little bit about um
[31:22] Abraham's
[31:24] attitude
[31:25] after communion.
[31:29] So uh we we find Abraham having
[31:33] communion with God in Genesis chapter 14
[31:36] after Abraham went into battle,
[31:40] &gt;&gt; right? Abraham, you know the story.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Uh Abraham had a nephew and and both of
[31:47] them received blessings.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram says sometimes
[31:52] blessings do not mean you get closer to
[31:54] God. Lot got very much blessed,
[31:57] &gt;&gt; but because of those blessings that he
[32:00] received, he went into the world.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; He set his tent towards Sodom and
[32:05] Gomorrah.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; He did not get there right away,
[32:09] &gt;&gt; but slowly and surely he got there.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; And then and then the enemy came and of
[32:15] course you think the enemy is is trying
[32:17] to destroy you. Well, wait until you are
[32:20] grafted by him.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; You know, cuz we have a great enemy,
[32:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Without Jesus, we're nothing,
[32:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:29] &gt;&gt; And Satan will destroy our lives.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; So, so uh uh you know, Lot was in Sodom
[32:34] and Gomorrah.
[32:36] Some kings came in and and and took over
[32:39] the city and then they took Lot captive
[32:41] with them
[32:43] &gt;&gt; with a with a kids
[32:45] &gt;&gt; with a wife with everything
[32:48] &gt;&gt; and and somebody escaped and went and
[32:50] told uh Abraham or Abraham and said,
[32:52] "Abraham,
[32:54] your nephew has been captured with the
[32:56] rest of the people."
[32:58] And you know, Abraham had the attitude
[33:00] of his father because if you if you read
[33:03] the the Bible, it says that God was his
[33:06] father.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; You know, right? If you go back go back,
[33:10] his father was Adam and then it says and
[33:13] and Adam was a son of God.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; So So Abraham had the attitude of his
[33:20] father, an attitude of mercy. When when
[33:23] when Lot was lost,
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Abraham did not say, "Well, good for
[33:27] him. He deserved what he No,
[33:30] &gt;&gt; he had a he had a different attitude.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know what I'm going to
[33:34] do, but I'm going to go and get my
[33:36] family."
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to go and get what God
[33:40] gave to me.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, the blessing the
[33:46] blessing came Brother teaches us that we
[33:48] have to separate ourselves from
[33:50] everybody, right? to receive a blessing
[33:52] from the Lord.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; But yet God is merciful.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; And even when people get away from the
[33:58] Lord,
[33:59] &gt;&gt; you know, Abraham was a son of prophecy.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM HAD A PROPHECY ABOUT HIS SON.
[34:06] Isaac was that son of prophecy that that
[34:10] that Elohim spoke to Abraham about. And
[34:14] and Abraham and Abraham believed for 25
[34:16] years about that prophecy.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] But we we have here Lot. Lot is a
[34:24] relative of Abraham.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; But Lot decided not to follow the
[34:29] message.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; You know what? Abraham had a big pencil.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; You know what pencils are for?
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but you to make circles.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] Yes, we we are too fast to pull to put
[34:51] people out.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; We message believers are
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is my first time.
[34:58] Probably we my last. BUT WE ARE WE ARE
[35:00] TOO FAST TO PUT PEOPLE OUT, BROTHER.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; You know, we're like, "Oh, well, you
[35:05] don't believe like I do. You don't do
[35:06] this the way I do." YOU'RE OUT.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE NOBODY
[35:11] to put anybody out. I'm nobody to put
[35:12] anybody out.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; The only one that can put me out is God.
[35:17] The only one that can put anybody out of
[35:19] the blood is God.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; I am under the blood and you are under
[35:24] the blood.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says even the prostitutes
[35:27] on the street are under the blood.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; When brother Bram was in that in that uh
[35:32] little place, you know, little
[35:34] restaurant, he thought it was a
[35:35] restaurant, but turned out it wasn't.
[35:37] [laughter]
[35:38] Right. And that old lady tried to try
[35:41] to, you know, flirt with him and he's
[35:44] like, "Ma'am, I'm a preacher. Have you
[35:47] heard of William Abraham?" She's like,
[35:49] "Yes, well, I'm him." And you know the
[35:52] story before he went to that lady, he
[35:55] was condemning her
[35:57] &gt;&gt; know and and God told him, "Look, look,
[35:59] Billy,
[36:00] &gt;&gt; get behind the door.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you something."
[36:04] &gt;&gt; And the Lord showed him how merciful God
[36:08] is.
[36:09] You know there is a blood that is
[36:12] covering as long as the bride of Jesus
[36:13] Christ is here there is mercy
[36:17] &gt;&gt; there is a mercy seat
[36:19] &gt;&gt; and that mercy seat is in the heart of
[36:21] the believer.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So do not be TOO FAST TO PUT
[36:25] ANYBODY OUT [laughter]
[36:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MY God is rich in mercy
[36:30] &gt;&gt; and you have the same God that I do.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's one something that our
[36:34] God is not poor on is mercy.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. His His mercies
[36:41] &gt;&gt; are new
[36:42] &gt;&gt; every morning.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; See, this is Sunday night already,
[36:46] &gt;&gt; but don't worry, tomorrow morning,
[36:48] &gt;&gt; his mercies are going to be brand new.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So, we have Abraham here. He goes, he
[36:57] fights for his nephew.
[37:00] Imagine that. He goes and fights for his
[37:03] nephew. And after he fights for his
[37:06] nephew, brother Ram says in in in in the
[37:08] message, "Who is this?" Mechisedc preach
[37:11] in 1965
[37:13] paragraph 105 says, "Notice after the
[37:16] battle was over, Mechisedc served his
[37:18] victorious child communion.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Communion.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Think of that
[37:25] &gt;&gt; part of himself." Now we want to see
[37:27] here in type here is in view the
[37:30] communion after the battle he gave
[37:33] himself because the communion is part of
[37:35] Christ
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and after the struggle is over after
[37:39] you've done got after you you've done
[37:42] got yourself wipe out then is when you
[37:44] partake of Christ
[37:46] &gt;&gt; become part of his being. You get it?
[37:49] &gt;&gt; So if you have a battle if you're
[37:50] struggling with something you fight it.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Don't don't give up.
[37:56] Amen. Because when you fight,
[37:59] &gt;&gt; God is with you.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself promised, "I will
[38:03] not leave you.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; I will not forsake you. I be I will be
[38:08] with you."
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Until when?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Until next Sunday.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Until the next revival? No. Until the
[38:16] end?
[38:17] &gt;&gt; So, you're fighting A BATTLE.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; KEEP FIGHTING THAT BATTLE. THERE WAS a a
[38:22] a prophecy spoken about you.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that prophecy says that you
[38:28] are the overcomer.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know that sometimes we feel
[38:32] like we're losers, but we're not.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; We're overcomers.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; When we are rich, we're overcomers. When
[38:38] we're poor, we're overcomers. When we're
[38:41] healthy, we're overcomers. WHEN WE ARE
[38:43] NOT FEELING TOO WELL IN OUR HEALTH,
[38:45] WE'RE OVERCOMERS. AMEN. When things are
[38:48] going great, we're overcomers. WHEN WE
[38:50] HAVE PROBLEMS AT HOME, WE ARE
[38:52] OVERCOMERS. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL
[38:55] THROWS AT YOU, YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER
[38:58] BECAUSE A PROPHECY WAS ALREADY WRITTEN
[39:01] ABOUT YOU.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NOTHING THE DEVIL CAN DO.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS NO DEMON IN HELL THAT CAN
[39:09] STOP THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU WANT TO HAVE COMMUNION WITH
[39:17] GOD, YOU GOT TO STRUGGLE IT. YOU GOT TO
[39:19] FIGHT IT. YOU CANNOT GIVE UP.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother says, "Jacob wrestled all
[39:25] night and wouldn't turn his and wouldn't
[39:27] turn him loose until he bless him."
[39:30] Amen. So sometimes the problem with with
[39:33] us in in this age is that we give up too
[39:36] fast.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; We give up too fast. Oh, YOU ARE ASKING
[39:42] GOD FOR a blessing. YOU ARE ASKING GOD
[39:44] TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. Don't give up.
[39:45] Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; You want the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[39:48] DON'T GIVE UP TOO FAST.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; You're looking at your situation. You're
[39:52] looking at your troubles. Well, now it's
[39:54] time to start looking at the word of
[39:56] God. Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Battle for life. Battle
[40:04] for life. And after the battle is over,
[40:07] then God gives you out. Then God gives
[40:09] you of himself.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; That is his true communion. Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; The little bread and wafer just
[40:15] represents it.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't take it unless you've
[40:18] wrestled it out and become part of God.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you are going through
[40:24] a wrestling time and and most of the
[40:26] time, you know who we wrestle against,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; that's the person that we wrestle the
[40:34] most.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham says the one
[40:37] that always gets on the way
[40:39] &gt;&gt; is William Branham. The one that is
[40:42] always trying to disbelieve the word is
[40:44] William Branham.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; So the one that's always on the way is
[40:47] Sergio.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[40:50] &gt;&gt; The one that's always struggling to
[40:52] believe it's me.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; So I have to battle with myself and I
[40:56] have to tell the devil, you know what,
[40:58] devil? There was something written about
[41:00] me. Brother Abraham says the THE THING
[41:03] ABOUT JESUS IS THAT HE BELIEVED the
[41:05] word. WHEN JESUS WAS GOING DOWN, YOU
[41:08] KNOW, WHEN JESUS DIED, HE WENT TO THE
[41:10] DEEPEST part of hell, right? WE WAS
[41:13] GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN
[41:15] AND DOWN. HE WAS NOT A SINNER, BUT HE
[41:18] WAS SIN
[41:19] &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING THAT WITH SIN CAN ENTER INTO
[41:21] GOD'S PRESENCE. SO, HE COULDN'T GO UP.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. BUT
[41:26] THEN THE BIBLE SAYS, BUT THEN HE
[41:27] REMEMBER
[41:29] &gt;&gt; HE REMEMBER IN THE BOOK IT'S WRITTEN
[41:32] ABOUT ME.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It doesn't matter how low you are.
[41:37] It doesn't matter how low YOU'RE GETTING
[41:39] INTO. WHAT HELL YOU'RE GETTING IN.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Remember this
[41:45] &gt;&gt; in the book
[41:48] &gt;&gt; in the book
[41:49] &gt;&gt; is written about me.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; So he stopped
[41:55] &gt;&gt; and he's like [clears throat]
[41:57] the keys are mine.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; The keys are mine. That's why when
[42:06] brother Ram had that that that brother
[42:08] had that dream about those people that
[42:10] were in in jail, right?
[42:12] Huh? There was nothing that could that
[42:15] could get get him out.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; But brother Rama spoke the word.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Spoke the word
[42:21] &gt;&gt; and and and and and and THE BARS OF HELL
[42:24] HAD TO GET LOOSE.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Had to break UP SO THAT GOD'S CHILDREN
[42:29] CAN GO FREE.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; NOW THAT WORD WAS ALREADY SPOKEN. THE
[42:33] JAIL IS ALREADY OPEN. AMEN. The
[42:36] earthquake already came. AMEN. ALL WE
[42:40] HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Don't be like Johnny Crow. You
[42:44] know what I mean?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Remember, at this time, the communion
[42:53] had never been instituted. Not until
[42:55] before the death of Jesus Christ,
[42:56] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[42:58] year later. But MelkiseDC after his
[43:01] child Abraham had had won the victory,
[43:04] Melkisedc met him and gave him wine and
[43:07] bread, showing that after this earthly
[43:10] battle is over, we will meet him in the
[43:13] heavens and take the communion again.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; It'll be the wedding supper. I will not
[43:18] drink no more of the wine or eat of the
[43:20] fruit until I eat and drink it with you
[43:24] a new in my father's kingdom. Is that
[43:26] right? Amen. Notice again, MelkiseDC
[43:30] went to meet Abraham before he got back
[43:32] home. What a beautiful type. Here we
[43:35] have Melkisedc meeting Abraham before he
[43:38] got back home after the battle.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; So you going through a battle is a good
[43:44] sign.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Said, "Oh, brother, I'm I I'm going
[43:48] through some battles."
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Well, don't give up.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Shake yourself a little bit.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Huh? Maybe slap yourself a little bit.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; You know what I MEAN? BUT GET UP,
[44:02] &gt;&gt; DUST YOURSELF OFF, AND KEEP GOING and
[44:05] keep GOING BECAUSE IN THE BOOK IS
[44:08] WRITTEN ABOUT YOU.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the type of communion THAT
[44:15] WE HAVE WITH OUR GOD.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT REALIZE SOMETIMES THAT WHAT WE
[44:20] HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS THE REVEALED WORD
[44:23] OF GOD, THE BLEEDING WORD. OH, WHEN I
[44:26] HEARD that this morning, I was like,
[44:27] "Oh, man."
[44:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; THE BLEEDING WORD OF GOD, THAT WORD IS
[44:33] STILL BLEEDING. THAT BLOOD [screaming]
[44:35] STILL HAS POWER TO SAVE THE LOWEST OF
[44:40] SINNER. THAT BLOOD STILL [screaming] HAS
[44:42] POWER TO TRANSFORM ANYBODY.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SATAN
[44:48] HAS PLACED IN YOUR BRAINS. IT DOESN'T
[44:51] MATTER WHAT SATAN PUTS IN YOUR HEAD, IN
[44:54] THE BOOK. STILL WRITTEN ABOUT YOU.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I I get emotional.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting emotional.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Or maybe I should forgive you for not
[45:10] getting emotional. It works both ways.
[45:13] You know,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; it works both ways.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; You know, we can all be like, "Oh, I
[45:22] don't know what I'm going to do." You
[45:24] know what you're going to do.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do
[45:28] &gt;&gt; when we meet Jesus. When I see him face
[45:30] to face. Oh, brother.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I'm going to do, but
[45:34] I'm going to do something. I'M GOING TO
[45:35] BE LIKE, "HEY, I'M [screaming] HERE.
[45:37] HEY,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; you know, I'm loud.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; So, if anybody's going to see him,
[45:44] brother."
[45:48] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Oh, well, the brother want
[45:49] to see him. That's fine with you. I'm
[45:51] going to scream cuz I want him to hear
[45:53] me.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Like that little girl that was waving
[45:55] her flag, right? Remember the king was
[45:58] passing by AND SHE WAS, "HEY, KING, I'M
[46:00] HERE." AND THEN THEN the the little girl
[46:02] stayed behind from the class and she was
[46:05] crying and the teacher couldn't find
[46:06] her. And the teacher WENT BACK AND SHE
[46:08] WAS HIDING THERE ALL SAD. SHE SAID LIKE,
[46:10] "WHY YOU CRYING? DID YOU FLAG YOU WAVE
[46:13] YOUR FLAG?" "YES." "Did you say the
[46:15] words?" "Yes." "So why you crying?" He's
[46:17] like, "Because I saw the king, but he
[46:18] didn't see me." Uh-huh.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. My word,
[46:22] the word of God says that he saw me.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; That he saw me even before I was formed
[46:29] in my mother's womb.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Then we we find a we find Abraham once
[46:38] again in Genesis 18.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; And then when we find him in Genesis 18,
[46:43] now Abraham is 99 years old.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc who is God. Amen. and the the
[46:49] great the the the great shepherd uh the
[46:52] high priest,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; the king of kings, the king of peace.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[46:58] &gt;&gt; He met him first when he fought the
[47:00] first battle. But now Abraham is
[47:03] fighting another battle. Now Abraham is
[47:05] fighting a battle within himself because
[47:07] this time Abraham is 99 YEARS OLD. HIS
[47:10] WIFE WERE 100 YEARS OLD. HIS WIFE or or
[47:13] his wife is what 10 years younger than
[47:15] him.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; So both of them are very old.
[47:18] You know what I mean?
[47:19] &gt;&gt; There was no hope for Sarah to have
[47:22] children.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But yet, if you read the the previous
[47:25] chapters, the Lord told that the LORD
[47:27] TELLS ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM, YOUR WIFE SARAH,
[47:30] WHO is 89 years old, is going to have a
[47:33] kid from you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And what did Abraham do? He laughed.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Why did Sarah laugh? Because she was
[47:45] part of Abraham.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you haven't read your
[47:51] Bible, go back and read it. Maybe I'm
[47:52] lying to you.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[47:57] &gt;&gt; You know, put me to the test.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Put the word to the test. Brother says,
[48:02] "Give it the word test."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't pass the word test, I
[48:06] don't care if it pass the Pentecostal
[48:07] test or the Baptist test or the Lutheran
[48:10] test or the Catholic test. It has to
[48:12] pass the word test.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] Hallelujah. Abraham laughed. But the
[48:18] Lord said, "YOU KNOW WHAT, ABRAHAM? NO
[48:20] MATTER WHAT YOU believe or not is what I
[48:22] say
[48:23] &gt;&gt; because Abraham was a child of the
[48:26] prophecy."
[48:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but that preaching this
[48:30] morning,
[48:31] &gt;&gt; come on.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; It got in my head, brother.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; But you know what else it got in my
[48:37] heart?
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Because I was like, "Hey, that's me.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; The one in the mirror is me." You know
[48:44] what I mean? When you look at that
[48:46] mirror,
[48:47] &gt;&gt; when I look at that mirror, I cannot see
[48:49] Sergio.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, Brother said, God has no
[48:55] feet. God has no hands now. But you are
[48:57] his feet. You're his hands.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are Jesus.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Miss Jesus Christ. [laughter]
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we have we find Abra
[49:06] Abraham here in in in uh in memory. And
[49:10] now he is in the evening time just
[49:14] waiting,
[49:16] chilling,
[49:17] thinking
[49:18] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden there comes three
[49:21] figures
[49:23] &gt;&gt; from far away
[49:26] but somehow he recognizes one.
[49:29] [snorts] you. It reminds me always
[49:31] always reminds me of the story of
[49:35] the story of uh Peter in in in the in uh
[49:41] the the book of Fox's book of martyrs.
[49:44] It it reminds me when when Peter when
[49:46] Peter uh was about to be caught, the the
[49:49] the saints uh deliver him through a
[49:52] window and he was about to escape the
[49:54] city and and and when he was about to
[49:57] get to the gates of the city, he he sees
[50:00] a figure coming his way and he kind of
[50:03] recognizes that figure.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; He's like, I know him.
[50:08] I've known, you know, you know how you
[50:10] like you see somebody from away like I
[50:12] think that's my dad. I think the way he
[50:14] walks, you know, just the way he's like
[50:17] this or I don't know. He recognized like
[50:20] if you're a child, you recognize him.
[50:22] Like the closer he got, you figure out,
[50:27] well, that's Jesus.
[50:29] He said, Lord, where are you going?
[50:33] And and and it says in the book and
[50:35] Jesus answered him, I am going back to
[50:38] be crucified again. Peter said, "Okay,
[50:41] Lord, if you're going to be crucified
[50:42] again, I'm going to be crucified with
[50:44] you."
[50:45] &gt;&gt; But he recognized him.
[50:48] Isn't it amazing? John in the island of
[50:50] Patmas when he sees that great vision,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; he sees that great man coming from the
[50:57] light that was in the midst of the
[50:59] church age the church you know the the
[51:02] candlesticks
[51:06] when he is looking at that picture and
[51:08] that great vision that he describes he's
[51:11] describing Jehovah
[51:13] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean the one that that
[51:15] that Jeremiah saw Ezekiel the great
[51:18] light He's describing the great Jehovah.
[51:22] [snorts]
[51:22] &gt;&gt; But as this person character walks
[51:25] closer to him,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; he begins to recognize him.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Wait a second. Wait."
[51:33] &gt;&gt; But Jehovah,
[51:35] [snorts]
[51:35] &gt;&gt; but he's getting closer to me.
[51:41] I was I rested on your bosom.
[51:45] Hallelujah.
[51:47] [snorts]
[51:47] &gt;&gt; I s with you.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; I slept with you
[51:51] &gt;&gt; on the streets of Jerusalem.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; He recognized that wasn't just Jehovah.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And he fainted.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; When you recognize who he is,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; that's when you recognize who you are.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That's when you recognize who you are.
[52:10] Right.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; The angel told brother Arab, brother,
[52:14] the angel told him, William Brham,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[52:19] Christ of the New Testament.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; But you need you need to have fellowship
[52:24] with him.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Communion with him.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Abraham was having.
[52:29] Communion. He sees this this character.
[52:31] He recognizes this character and then he
[52:35] invites him to come and eat with him. He
[52:38] has fellowship with him.
[52:40] And as he's having fellowship with him,
[52:42] this this this uh uh character Elohim
[52:48] does the work of the son of man, a
[52:51] prophet. He begins to discern the
[52:54] thoughts and intentions of their hearts.
[52:57] He even discerns the thoughts and
[52:58] intentions of the lady that was in in
[53:01] the other on the other room,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Sarah. She laughed.
[53:06] He said, "Why did she laugh?" So, I
[53:08] didn't laugh.
[53:11] See, God wasn't kill going to kill her
[53:13] because she laughed, but he was going to
[53:15] kill her because she said, "You're
[53:17] lying."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; You know, that's the difference.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; You may you may doubt the word, but
[53:24] don't tell God that he's lying cuz he
[53:26] doesn't lie.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and and as he
[53:31] having he's having communion and then
[53:33] you see the two the two angels walking
[53:36] away but Abraham stays with Elohim
[53:40] &gt;&gt; and as Elohim is walking away Elohim
[53:44] says my son Abraham is going to teach
[53:48] his children and his grandchildren to
[53:51] walk after me.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to teach them my
[53:53] commandments, my statutes.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Can I hide anything from Abraham?
[54:02] Oh brother.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And he did it. He revealed the word to
[54:08] him.
[54:10] [snorts]
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Are we Abraham's seed
[54:15] &gt;&gt; or what?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; We have the revelation.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; We can boast about it.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Like, well, we
[54:25] have to be humble. Well, humbly boasting
[54:27] about it.
[54:29] We have the revelation of the word of
[54:31] God.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil make you feel sorry
[54:34] for yourself because you believe this
[54:36] message.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Sister, don't let the devil MAKE YOU
[54:39] SORRY BECAUSE YOU have long skirts and
[54:41] long hair and no makeup odd.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Brother, don't make the devil MAKE YOU
[54:48] FEEL SORRY. ESPECIALLY IF YOU YOUNG MEN,
[54:50] DON'T make the devil make you feel sorry
[54:52] because you you never had a girlfriend
[54:53] yet.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; No. No. Don't worry. God has somebody
[54:58] for you.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He spoke it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, look at me. I'm not that great
[55:04] looking and I have a beautiful wife.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Blessed be in the name of the Lord.
[55:10] So, believe the word.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wow." What? To many to the old
[55:14] people doesn't mean much, but to young
[55:16] people that means a lot.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean, sister? You don't
[55:20] have to be showing yourself to anybody
[55:22] over there. God has something somebody
[55:24] very special for you.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; You know brothers, you don't have to be
[55:28] looking outside anywhere. There is
[55:30] nothing good outside.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; There is nothing good outside the
[55:34] kingdom of heaven.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to be looking at
[55:37] anybody over there. As a matter of fact,
[55:39] if you have a little girlfriend over
[55:40] there, caught up with her because that
[55:42] is not God's will.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's going to get me in troubles,
[55:46] but that's all right. Let me get in
[55:48] troubles a little bit for the word of
[55:50] God and save you from a life of pain.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Blessed be the name of the
[55:57] Lord.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; So, let let me go back here if I can.
[56:01] Hallelujah. And and and and then we find
[56:04] we see Abraham, he's he's talking to
[56:06] Elohim. And as he's talking to Elohim
[56:09] and Elohim tells him what he's going to
[56:10] do in Sodom and Gomorrah. Then what does
[56:13] Abraham do?
[56:16] What is the attitude of Abraham?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; An attitude of mercy.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Imagine that.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; It is an attitude of mercy. I hope I
[56:28] hope we we get the same attitude.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we have the same attitude. The
[56:32] attitude of mercy,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; not an attitude of of well, if you're
[56:35] out there, well, that's good for you and
[56:37] you know, if the rapture comes and you
[56:40] stay behind, well, I'm sorry. No, no,
[56:41] that's not the attitude of a believer.
[56:44] The attitude of a believer is I'm going
[56:45] to ask mercy.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to ask God to
[56:48] save them.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask God to bring them
[56:51] &gt;&gt; in.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham did.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, you mean to tell me
[56:56] you're going to destroy the United
[56:57] States of America?"
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You mean to tell me you don't pray
[57:01] for America anymore? No. But I pray for
[57:04] the saints in America. Said, "What if
[57:07] there's 50 50 uh righteous men? Would
[57:10] you destroy them?"
[57:12] And and he he he begins to make business
[57:15] with God.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Make a bit with God.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; 50 50. Give me 50. Well, what if I don't
[57:24] find 50? Well, 45. Give me 45. Can you
[57:26] give me 45?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; 25. 30. 30. Can you give me 30?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; He's been with God.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we supposed to be
[57:36] doing, brother. Save my family, Lord.
[57:38] Say save my cousins. Say, "My grandma,
[57:41] my my my grandpa, my son, my daughter,
[57:44] my brother, my sister. Bring them in,
[57:46] Lord. Bring them in, Lord. If you don't
[57:48] want to bring the whole family, at least
[57:49] bring half of them." Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Just bring them in, Lord.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; You know, it sounds like it sounds, you
[57:56] know, but we lack that.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; We lack that.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; You see, when people don't say amen, you
[58:04] know, you're saying what is right.
[58:08] That's right.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not really sorry.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; It's me. I cannot be another person.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You you you have
[58:18] to be yourself.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Because God created you that way.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you if you can sing,
[58:24] praise the Lord.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And if you cannot sing but you love to
[58:27] sing, praise the Lord.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; God made you that way.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; So So just praise God no matter what.
[58:34] Say, "Lord, I brother, I don't have a
[58:36] voice to sing." Well, just praise him.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Praise him with everything that you
[58:40] have.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the only thing you can do is
[58:42] whistle, well, whistle for Jesus.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just brother says here in in in
[58:48] the message, uh, hearing, recognizing,
[58:51] and acting on the word of God. I'm going
[58:54] to try to finish, brother. [snorts]
[58:55] Watch what happened in in the days of
[58:57] Lot. There was lot down there in Sodom.
[59:00] will well settle down intellectually
[59:03] become the one of the big men of the
[59:07] city. The judge setting gates and judged
[59:10] the people. His wife belonged to all
[59:12] societies there was in the city and his
[59:14] daughters and all of them married among
[59:15] the celebrity, intellectual, highly
[59:17] educated, smart, witty and Abraham lived
[59:20] in a tent under an oak tree. But one day
[59:23] they both got a visitation.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You know that both groups got a
[59:29] visitation. We got a visitation from the
[59:32] angel of the Lord,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? Through the
[59:35] seventh angel messenger,
[59:38] &gt;&gt; you know, and over there they got their
[59:40] visitation. And they've got two great
[59:42] revivals. One great revival of the
[59:45] Baptist church and another great revival
[59:47] of the Pentecostal church. Billy Graham
[59:50] preaching to the Baptist people. Oral
[59:52] Roberts preaching to the Pentecostals.
[59:55] One got very intellectual. The other one
[59:57] gave got very powerful and emotional.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; We got the message of the hour.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? SO EVERYBODY GOT
[1:00:05] their visitation.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody got their visitation.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; You have family. I have family who got
[1:00:12] THEIR VISITATION BUT THEY REFUSED THEIR
[1:00:14] VISITATION.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that God cannot
[1:00:17] save them because my God is rich in
[1:00:21] mercy
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; and is slow to anger.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was an
[1:00:27] intellectual preacher went down and
[1:00:29] preached and called him out. Look, look
[1:00:31] at the message. Come out, he said to
[1:00:33] Lot. And he would never been called out
[1:00:36] if he had not been for the mercy of
[1:00:38] Abraham.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Do you have mercy?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Do I have mercy?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; If we are Abraham's seed,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; we got to have mercy.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Stop putting people out. That's right.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus never asked you put people out.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Did he tell you to do that?
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; No. He tell you, He told us this
[1:01:01] morning, preach the revealed word of
[1:01:05] God, and the revealed word of God will
[1:01:09] forgive the sins of the people.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; That's what we were told this morning.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; At least that's what I understood.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; So I need to preach the word that came
[1:01:20] from the seventh messenger, the seventh
[1:01:23] angel messenger,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; right? And that revealed word when is
[1:01:27] when people hear it, sooner or later
[1:01:30] they will come in.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's in God's
[1:01:34] time. Here is Lot. If if if if uh really
[1:01:38] quick if you go with me to uh Genesis
[1:01:40] 18,
[1:01:42] [snorts]
[1:01:45] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:00] Genesis 19
[1:02:06] verse 15.
[1:02:08] And when the and when the morning arose,
[1:02:10] then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
[1:02:13] Arise, take thy wife and thy two
[1:02:16] daughters which are there, lest thou be
[1:02:19] consumed in the iniquity of the city.
[1:02:22] And while he lingered, the man laid hold
[1:02:25] upon his hand. That's very interesting.
[1:02:27] When I read that, I I never paid
[1:02:30] attention to that until I heard brother
[1:02:32] Graham.
[1:02:34] But I'll tell you what what I heard
[1:02:35] brother Graham said. Then I was like,
[1:02:36] "Oh,
[1:02:39] and upon the hand of his wife, and upon
[1:02:41] the hand of his two daughters, the Lord
[1:02:44] being merciful unto him." Why was the
[1:02:47] Lord merciful unto him? He was in Sodom
[1:02:49] and Gomorrah. He deserved no mercy.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He deserved to die with the rest of the
[1:02:54] people.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; But there was a little man,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; huh? Out there,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; that he that Lot did not want to have
[1:03:02] anything to do with his father because
[1:03:04] Abraham was his father. He raised him.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM WAS LOT'S DAD.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LIKE ANY SPOILED CHILD, HE'S
[1:03:12] LIKE, "I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO
[1:03:14] do with you." WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, NO
[1:03:16] MATTER HOW FAR YOU GET AWAY FROM MOM AND
[1:03:18] DAD, THERE IS A PRAYER THAT IS ALWAYS
[1:03:22] GOING TO REACH YOU.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ABRAHAM DID.
[1:03:26] HE PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND
[1:03:29] BEGGED AND BEGGED. AND EVEN THOUGH HE
[1:03:31] never mentioned LOT'S NAME, GOD KNEW
[1:03:34] THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT WAS
[1:03:37] IN IN ABRAHAM'S MIND.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD SAID TO THE ANGELS, "LOOK,
[1:03:41] LOOK GUYS, WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE, I
[1:03:44] mean, this is me, okay? Not don't like
[1:03:46] what quote." No, no. This is me thinking
[1:03:48] out loud, OKAY? GOD SAID TO THE ANGELS,
[1:03:50] YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE,
[1:03:52] you you guys make sure of something.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Do not touch anything. Do not destroy
[1:04:00] anything until Lot is up.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother.
[1:04:08] That's after communion.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's the attitude of communion. When
[1:04:13] you have communion with God, when you
[1:04:15] realize who you are, you realize that
[1:04:17] you can go before the throne of mercy
[1:04:19] and beg for mercy, not for yourself.
[1:04:22] Because in the book is already WRITTEN
[1:04:24] ABOUT YOU.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU MADE [screaming] IT.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY MADE IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT
[1:04:31] YOU. JUST KEEP GOING. KEEP ASKING FOR
[1:04:33] MERCY FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. THE THE ONES
[1:04:35] THAT YOU DON'T SEE HERE, the ones that
[1:04:37] you know they're away FROM THE LORD, ASK
[1:04:39] for them. BEG THE LORD FOR THEM TO BRING
[1:04:42] THEM IN.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:49] And and verse 16. And while he linger,
[1:04:52] the men laid hold upon him, his hand,
[1:04:55] and upon the hand of his wife, and upon
[1:04:57] the hand of his two daughters, the Lord
[1:04:59] being merciful unto him, and they
[1:05:02] brought him forth, and set him without
[1:05:05] the city. Hallelujah.
[1:05:08] And it came to pass when they had
[1:05:11] brought him them for abroad that he
[1:05:14] said, "Escape for thy life. Look no
[1:05:17] behind thee, neither stay thou in all
[1:05:20] the plain. Escape to the mountains lest
[1:05:22] thou be consumed.
[1:05:24] Amen. Why? Hallelujah. He said, you you
[1:05:29] you you go, you run. Run for your life.
[1:05:33] Run for your life. Why? Why? The angel
[1:05:35] said, because I can do nothing.
[1:05:39] If you keep reading, the angel said, I
[1:05:40] cannot do anything until you get out of
[1:05:43] here.
[1:05:45] and and uh just to to finish
[1:05:52] brother says uh
[1:05:58] says and the angel said that morning to
[1:06:01] Lord after he had given the message he
[1:06:02] said hasten come he hither for I can do
[1:06:05] nothing till you has come hither.
[1:06:08] I want you to notice this because we
[1:06:10] have cut short here on account of the
[1:06:12] prayer line. Do you notice what the
[1:06:14] angel said?
[1:06:17] I can't do nothing till you come hither.
[1:06:20] What was it? It was a message of
[1:06:21] deliverance. And before one speck of
[1:06:24] fire could fall from heaven, Lot had to
[1:06:27] get out of Sodom.
[1:06:30] And I hear that and then I then places
[1:06:33] Lot in a different level. And I'm like
[1:06:35] when I heard the the I think there's a
[1:06:37] message I I don't know if I have the
[1:06:39] quote right here. Yes. Is the church
[1:06:41] will the church go before tribulation?
[1:06:43] Preaching 58.
[1:06:46] When I heard these one the first time, I
[1:06:48] stopped the tape because I was like,
[1:06:50] what did brother Ara just said?
[1:06:53] You know what I mean? Cuz I was like,
[1:06:55] brother Ram is placing replacing Lot
[1:06:59] with Noah and the bride.
[1:07:04] My God can do anything.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He he doesn't ask
[1:07:10] for my opinion,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He he he saves anybody he wants to save.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He saves the holiest men
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; and the vilest of sinners
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; cuz that's my God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And before one drop of rain fell
[1:07:30] from heaven, Noah went into the ark. And
[1:07:33] before the atom bomb can strike this
[1:07:35] nation, the church will go in the
[1:07:36] rapture to meet the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; The angels are ready. He says,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; "The angels are ready for you and for
[1:07:45] me.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; There's a homecoming party waiting for
[1:07:48] us.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know if you want to make
[1:07:50] it there, but I want to make it there
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; cuz I love parties. I love cake.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I I love to have communion. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; I love to have communion with the
[1:08:01] brothers and talk about Jesus and talk
[1:08:04] about this glorious message and talk
[1:08:06] about my Lord cuz brother Brown says he
[1:08:09] likes us to boast about him.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; When you speak about him, he makes
[1:08:13] himself present.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; When you speak about him, he shows up.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So do not give up.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Do not give up. Do not give up.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Number one. Number two,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; do not give up for your children.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Pray for your children. It doesn't
[1:08:29] matter if they're away. It doesn't
[1:08:31] matter if they're in drugs, if they're
[1:08:33] out there in an alley. God can bring
[1:08:35] them FROM ANYWHERE. CUZ GOD SENT his
[1:08:38] angels to bring LOT OUT OF SODOM AND
[1:08:42] GOMORRAH. He can do anything.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says God had a need to
[1:08:50] go to Samaria.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a need to GO TO SAMARIA. WHY?
[1:08:53] Because there was a little woman there
[1:08:55] waiting for him. Nobody wanted to have
[1:08:58] anything to do with that woman because
[1:08:59] she had an ill fame.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew that in THE BOOK WAS
[1:09:06] WRITTEN ABOUT HER. [laughter]
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; IN THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT HER. And
[1:09:11] he had a NEED TO GO INTO THAT LITTLE
[1:09:13] TOWN. WHY? BECAUSE THERE WAS A
[1:09:15] predestinated seed that WAS GOING TO
[1:09:18] SPRING UP ONCE THE RIVERS OF ETERNAL
[1:09:21] LIFE FLOW THROUGH HER. AND BROTHER and
[1:09:24] sister, THE RIVERS OF ETERNAL LIFE
[1:09:26] [screaming] ARE FLOWING THROUGH US.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; MAYBE MAYBE RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU SEE ME,
[1:09:33] you don't really see any any leaves on
[1:09:35] me. You know what I mean? Maybe I'm just
[1:09:38] you see just the the little branches
[1:09:40] there and they look like they're dried
[1:09:41] up. But don't worry, they're not dried
[1:09:43] up. The waters of life are PASSING
[1:09:45] THROUGH. THE SAP IS ABOUT TO COME UP.
[1:09:48] I'M ABOUT TO GIVE FRUIT. Every believer
[1:09:51] is ABOUT TO GIVE FRUIT BECAUSE THE WAR
[1:09:54] OF GOD spoke about it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:09:57] tells you. It doesn't matter what THE
[1:09:59] DEVIL TELLS ME. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
[1:10:01] SERGIO SAYS. ONLY MATTERS WHAT HIS word
[1:10:03] says.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Let us stand up.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I am an emotional person.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Some people are not emotional. That's
[1:10:16] all right. That's the way God made you.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[1:10:20] [snorts] Some people never leave lift
[1:10:21] their hands,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; never clap. It's all right. Don't worry.
[1:10:27] One of these days, you're going to raise
[1:10:29] your hands
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; and you're going to clap
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; and you're going to cry.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You don't know why, but all of a sudden,
[1:10:36] you're going to feel a fire
[1:10:38] in your belly, and your chest,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be like, "Oh, what
[1:10:42] is this? Oh, I don't know what is it,
[1:10:44] brother, but it feels good." And you're
[1:10:47] going to feel forgiven. And you're going
[1:10:49] to feel a load lift up from you. And
[1:10:52] brother, that day,
[1:10:55] that day, you're going to scream and
[1:10:56] shout. That day, the brother's going to
[1:10:58] be like, "Calm down. What's wrong with
[1:11:01] you?" NO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going on in here.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I was lost. I WAS HEAVY LADEN. I
[1:11:11] COULDN'T EVEN RAISE MY HAND. BUT NOW I
[1:11:13] KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN FORGIVEN. I KNOW
[1:11:15] THAT I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED. I KNOW
[1:11:18] THAT IN THE BOOK IS WRITTEN ABOUT ME.
[1:11:21] [screaming]
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I KNOW THAT I WILL MAKE
[1:11:23] IT.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Father God, we thank you for your word,
[1:11:27] Lord. We thank you for your presence
[1:11:29] among us, Lord. Father God, Father, if I
[1:11:32] said anything contrary to your word,
[1:11:34] Lord, may not be placed in in the
[1:11:36] believer's hearts, Lord. Father God, but
[1:11:39] my my my my uh I like to encourage them,
[1:11:42] Lord, to to to for them to continue to
[1:11:45] move forward, Father God. Father, we are
[1:11:47] your children. We were predestinated
[1:11:50] before the foundation of the world,
[1:11:52] Father. The blood of Jesus Christ bought
[1:11:54] us. We were purchased with a with a
[1:11:57] payment of blood, Father God. And we
[1:11:59] thank you for that, Lord. Father, bless
[1:12:02] each one of your children this place,
[1:12:03] Lord. If anyone is was thinking about
[1:12:07] giving up, Lord, help them not to give
[1:12:09] up. Help them to continue to move
[1:12:11] forward, Lord. Father God, if anyone is
[1:12:14] praying for their children, Lord,
[1:12:16] praying for their loved ones, praying
[1:12:17] for their wife, their husband, praying,
[1:12:20] Father God, for their parents, for their
[1:12:22] siblings, Lord, Father God, I pray that
[1:12:24] you help them to believe. I pray that
[1:12:27] they be like Abraham and keep asking for
[1:12:29] mercy, for mercy, for mercy until until
[1:12:33] that manifestation comes, Lord, and
[1:12:35] their children and their loved ones and
[1:12:37] their spouses and their siblings come to
[1:12:39] you, Lord, because there is nothing
[1:12:42] impossible with you, Father God. And you
[1:12:44] gave us a word, a word of salvation,
[1:12:46] Lord. And we are the bride of Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ, Father God. If there is a queen
[1:12:51] in heaven, Lord, it's the bride of Jesus
[1:12:53] Christ. And that queen can speak to the
[1:12:56] king and the king will grant her desires
[1:12:59] for she only speaks while the king
[1:13:02] speaks. The spirit and the bride say
[1:13:05] come. They speak the same thing. Lord
[1:13:07] help us father God and bless us Lord.
[1:13:10] Bless us tonight Lord. We thank you for
[1:13:12] everything you've done for us in Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:13:30] My my
[1:13:33] man, I didn't know brother Serg was a
[1:13:36] ball of fire,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; but I certainly appreciate that. Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's what the word does
[1:13:43] to you. You know, when God moves in your
[1:13:45] heart, you can't help but express it.
[1:13:47] You know what I mean? Amen. I so
[1:13:49] appreciate that. He he said one thing
[1:13:51] that really touched me tonight and and I
[1:13:54] just want to say before we move to
[1:13:55] communion. You know it's it's when you
[1:13:58] have fellowship that you have the
[1:14:01] ability to intercede for others.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; It it's within the fellowship the
[1:14:05] communion you can sit there. It was
[1:14:08] after the communion that Abraham could
[1:14:10] sit there and start talking about Lot.
[1:14:13] And I believe us that are gathered here
[1:14:15] we we have that communion with him. And
[1:14:18] I believe we can uh uh look out to those
[1:14:22] that of of your family members and of
[1:14:24] the church bodies and we can certainly
[1:14:26] inc
[1:14:31] I I realize if you don't have
[1:14:33] relationship it's hard for you to ask
[1:14:35] but if you know you can come and in the
[1:14:37] sea then you know father I I I know you
[1:14:40] love me like Jesus would say I know you
[1:14:42] hear me but I'm not asking for myself
[1:14:45] but I'm asking for these that are
[1:14:46] standing here. Amen. Let's turn to our
[1:14:49] Bibles to our uh scripture of uh
[1:14:52] communion tonight. Certainly, God bless
[1:14:55] brother Sergio. I certainly enjoy that.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:59] uh communion scripture uh 1 Corinthians
[1:15:02] 11:23
[1:15:06] [snorts]
[1:15:09] said for I have received of the Lord
[1:15:11] that which I have delivered unto you
[1:15:14] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:15:16] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:15:19] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[1:15:22] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:15:25] broken for you Please do in remembrance
[1:15:28] of me. And after the same manner also he
[1:15:32] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[1:15:35] "This cup is the new testimony in my
[1:15:37] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[1:15:40] it in remembrance of me. For as often ye
[1:15:45] eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
[1:15:48] show the Lord's death till it comes.
[1:15:51] Wherefore whatsoever shall eat of this
[1:15:53] bread and drink of this cup uh this cup
[1:15:56] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:15:58] of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[1:16:00] But let every man examine himself, so
[1:16:03] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:16:05] that cup. For eat for he that eateth and
[1:16:09] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[1:16:11] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[1:16:15] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:16:18] cause many are weak and sick among you
[1:16:21] and many sleep. For if we would judge
[1:16:24] ourselves, we should not be judged. When
[1:16:28] we are judged, we are chasteed enough
[1:16:31] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:16:33] with the world. Wherefore, my brethren,
[1:16:36] when ye come together to eat, tar one
[1:16:39] for another, and if any man hunger, let
[1:16:42] him eat at home, that ye come not
[1:16:44] together unto condemnation, and the the
[1:16:47] rest will I said in order when I come.
[1:16:51] Amen. Let's just pray over the bread and
[1:16:53] the wine.
[1:16:58] Our
[1:17:02] gracious father, we can certainly sir
[1:17:05] within our hearts that this has been a
[1:17:07] special day.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Father, you you spoke to us. You open
[1:17:10] our hearts and our mind, Lord, to see
[1:17:13] your word that what we do even in
[1:17:16] communion, Father, the true forgiving
[1:17:20] and the true communion are happen with
[1:17:22] the revelation that you've given us. And
[1:17:24] father we pray even as we pray for this
[1:17:27] bread and this wine which is just a
[1:17:29] symbolism of what you have done father
[1:17:32] as we eat of this body your prophet said
[1:17:35] that there's healing and communion lord
[1:17:37] and father we would remember our pastor
[1:17:40] and sister Leslie even right now and say
[1:17:42] father that you would touch the bodies
[1:17:44] and heal them oh god
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; father we understand that it's within
[1:17:48] the communion that we have with you that
[1:17:50] we can even intercede for others the
[1:17:52] word was not given for us to keep it for
[1:17:55] ourselves, but to share it with those
[1:17:57] that are lost. And I need you, Lord.
[1:17:59] Take this bread, Lord, and let it become
[1:18:01] a word, Father, part of us, that we may
[1:18:04] become one with you in taking it, Lord.
[1:18:06] And and of the wine, Father, let it be
[1:18:09] the representation of that stimulation
[1:18:11] of revelation, Lord. And which is the
[1:18:14] very bloodline of what we heard today
[1:18:16] that Father, you took away our sins and
[1:18:20] everything that we had done, all the
[1:18:21] wrong that you have we had done. Lord,
[1:18:23] you washed it away. You gave us a clean
[1:18:26] slate and you brought us right back into
[1:18:28] the beginning in the image of what you
[1:18:31] had worked on. [snorts] We're so
[1:18:33] privileged people, Lord. And we ask that
[1:18:35] as we take it, Lord, Father, let our
[1:18:37] revelation grow in you, Lord. And let us
[1:18:39] be renewed, Father, in you to know that
[1:18:42] everything is done, oh God. We remember
[1:18:45] those that couldn't be here, Father.
[1:18:47] Remember to be with them where they are,
[1:18:49] Father. May you give them the
[1:18:50] opportunities, Lord God, that they may
[1:18:52] be assembled with us the next time. We
[1:18:54] commit everything to you and we pray one
[1:18:56] for another. Father, if we've done
[1:18:58] anything that's not pleasing to you, let
[1:19:00] the blood of your son wash us of all
[1:19:02] uncleanness. Father, like the scripture
[1:19:04] says that we may not come together for
[1:19:06] condemnation, but we may come to rejoice
[1:19:08] and be one with you for what you have
[1:19:10] done. We love you and we ask this in the
[1:19:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray.
[1:19:15] Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May have your seats.
[1:19:18] Amen. And you may come when you're
[1:19:19] ready. The musician can come.
[1:28:23] down from me.
[1:28:30] Oh, ever livinging
[1:28:33] story.
[1:28:37] My God and
[1:28:40] Savior came
[1:28:44] and Jesus
[1:28:47] was his name.
[1:28:50] Bold in a manger.
[1:28:56] Oh, and to his own a strangeanger,
[1:29:04] a man of sorrow,
[1:29:08] tears, and I
[1:29:11] go.
[1:29:13] [music]
[1:29:17] Oh, how I love him.
[1:29:23] How I adore
[1:29:27] him.
[1:29:29] My breath, my son shall be
[1:29:37] my all in all
[1:29:42] the great creatator. [music]
[1:29:46] [singing]
[1:29:48] He became
[1:29:50] my savior.
[1:29:54] and all thy [singing and music]
[1:29:57] fullness.
[1:30:00] Oh dwell
[1:30:02] in [music and singing] him.
[1:30:06] Oh, what kind [chant]
[1:30:14] of [music and singing]
[1:30:18] [music] Oh, that
[1:30:23] of God
[1:30:27] faithful
[1:30:28] hope inside. [singing]
[1:30:31] Oh, God's gracious.

[1:33:43] John chapter 13
[1:33:46] says, "Now before the feast of the
[1:33:48] Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:33:51] was come and that he should depart out
[1:33:53] of this world unto the father, having
[1:33:56] loved his own which were in the world,
[1:33:58] he loved them unto the end." And supper
[1:34:02] being ended, the devil having put into
[1:34:05] the heart of Judas his Scariot Simon's
[1:34:07] son to betray him. Jesus knowing that
[1:34:11] the Father had given all things unto his
[1:34:14] hand, and that he was come from God, and
[1:34:17] went to God, he raised from supper, and
[1:34:21] laid aside his garment, and took a
[1:34:23] towel, and girded himself. And after he
[1:34:26] had poured water into the basin, he
[1:34:29] began to wash his disciples feet, and
[1:34:31] wiped them with the towel which
[1:34:34] wherewith it was gathered with.
[1:34:37] went. Then he came to Simon Peter, and
[1:34:39] Peter said unto him, Lord, thou thou
[1:34:42] wash my feet. Jesus answered and said
[1:34:44] unto him, What I do, thou knowest not
[1:34:48] now, but thou shalt know hereafter.
[1:34:51] Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never
[1:34:54] wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I
[1:34:56] wash thee not, that has no part with me.
[1:35:00] Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my
[1:35:03] feet only, but my hands and my head.
[1:35:07] Jesus said to him, "He that is washed
[1:35:10] needeth not save to wash his feet, but
[1:35:13] is cleaned every width. And ye are
[1:35:15] clean, but not all. For he knew who
[1:35:18] should betray him. Therefore he said, Ye
[1:35:21] are not all clean." So after he had
[1:35:23] washed the disciples feet, and taken his
[1:35:26] garment, and was set down again, he said
[1:35:28] unto them, "Know ye what I have done to
[1:35:31] you, ye call me Master and Lord, and ye
[1:35:35] say well, for so I am. If I then, your
[1:35:38] Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
[1:35:41] ye also are to wash one another's feet.
[1:35:44] For I have given you an example that you
[1:35:47] should also do as I have done unto you.
[1:35:51] Verily, verily, I say unto you, the
[1:35:53] servant is not greater than he than his
[1:35:56] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[1:35:58] than him that sent him. If you know
[1:36:01] these things, happy are ye if you do
[1:36:04] them.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the gospel was given
[1:36:06] for. Whatever is given to us that we may
[1:36:09] go and share with others. Amen. God
[1:36:12] bless you as the sisters go to the place
[1:36:14] and we'll meet after the footwashing.
[1:36:16] Amen.
