amen amen would like to welcome all the saints of god in the house of god this morning amen i trust you're excited to be here the man who want to welcome brother trevor and sister anne from brother uh nate and bryan's church we're certainly glad to have you with us and then god bless you manager invited by mike for our song reading this morning good morning there's a there's a phrase that the the world often uses when there's a time of crisis or an uncomfortable situation and they make the statement we have a situation be a crisis like a hostage situation could be a financial situation could be a health situation or a job situation but it's it's generally uh uncomfortable or requires some form of crisis management in order to respond to that if we look at psalm 48 this morning there's another kind of situation it says in psalm 48 verse 2. that will start in verse 1 great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situations amen the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king this entire chapter speaks about the situation of zion and how she is situated and positioned you know and as we've mentioned in maybe some of our other psalm readings david speaks of zion many times it's uh it's the place where god dwells with his people on the earth and it's always referred to as she as her effeminate it says in verse 2 beautiful for situation you know while the situation in the world might be unwelcome zion is beautiful because of her situation amen you know the word describes her as beautiful because of how she's arranged how she's positioned you know if you look at chapter 48 you know first of all it says in verse 2 the joy of the whole earth you know it isn't that the whole earth rejoices in her or has joy with her but if there's any joy found anywhere it's all there in zion think about it there's nowhere else where you can find a joy at best everything else is a cheap imitation that temporarily occupies us from the reality of the joyless world that we live in but all the joy in the earth is here in zion beautiful for situation and why is there joy there it says in verse 11 what's the source let mount zion rejoice because of thy judgments they rejoice they have joy because of his word what else about his situation it's the place where the great king resides in verse 2 it is the city of the great king you know it says in verse 3 god is known in her palaces for a refuge you know is there a people this morning that know him has he been a refuge for you beautiful for situation is zion just one more verse 8 it says as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god something else about zion's situation is here that somebody sees the manifestation of what was spoken it's where hearing becomes seeing it's where word becomes flesh beautiful for situation is zion you know the other thing is is that she's situated in a position that's visible she has manifestation men can see her it says in verse 4 for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marveled they were troubled and hasted away jesus describes it this way in matthew 5 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid you know and the reaction that men have to this zion is they marvel at it they're troubled at it you know when the situation calls for fear she has joy when the world calls for crisis management she has refuge when times are dark and confused and it seems like you can't believe anything you hear she has clarity and focus and guidance because of his judgments beautiful for situation you know and men don't know what to do with her you know because she won't fall into the narrative of the day of the hour she doesn't get caught up in all the crises of the age but she has joy beautiful for situation do you have a situation this morning do you have a zion situation you know i i pray that we do it's a place of joy it's a his dwelling place it's where the great king is it's where the word becomes flesh let's read in psalm 48 this morning about the situation of zion let's read that together starting at verse 1. great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marveled they were troubled and hasted away fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god god will establish it forever selah we have thought of thy loving kindness o god in the midst of thy temple according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers thereof mark gee well her bullworks consider her palaces that you may tell it to the generation following for this god is our god forever and ever he will be our guide even unto death

you're exposed now brother hallelujah that thrilled my soul amen you have to teach me some of that if it can be taught i don't know if it'll be taught you love the lord this morning didn't god wonderful he he really is wonderful i just like to have say a little testimony before we uh we pray uh you know we we had time constraints with the city and our our time frame ran out so we had to reapply to the to the city to keep going forward with our new sanctuary and so the resolution came up before the city council and so they read the amendment to extend our building process and they took the vote on it and it was the fastest resolution ever passed in the history of the city of bedford so i thought that was pretty good they just got up they read it one guy said that's a no-brainer i second another guy's second and they voted and it was done in about 30 seconds and then they all stopped and they said this is the fastest thing that's ever got passed through the city of bedford i said well i sure wish you'd speed up the building part of it but maybe by god's grace it'll go for we certainly welcome all our visitors this morning to that are here with us and but most of all we trust the lord is here with us that he's in your heart and we just hoped this morning that you can feel his love and know that he loves you let's go to him in prayer this morning our gracious heavenly father as we approach your word this morning father it is beyond our physical capabilities or our mental capabilities father to open your word and to speak of you in any light that's worthy of your greatness but lord we humbly approach you and ask that you would stand between the lips of the speaker and the ear of the here and that in that place father you administer yourself to each heart that you would look across this assembly this morning you alone knowing the needs knowing the battles father knowing the questions that are in the heart and father you take a moment this morning to stop at each seat to pass by each child the young and the old father and just reach your hand out they give a touch from you lord for one moment with you can change life forever and ever we're needy of you this morning lord our vocabularies run short when it comes to describe you our minds father run out of room when it comes to explain you but if your spirit would come today by divine revelation and that quickening power you can deal with each heart and that's what we asked this morning father help us not inject our own selves but may you father have the preeminence we commit this service into your hand this morning father may it be a blessing to us all in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you let's turn it to deuteronomy this morning and the 16th chapter of the book of deuteronomy and the first three verses and this morning were ministering out of the message called god's chosen place of worship and this is the next sermon in the line of sermons that we've been following we've just been going from each sermon to the next sermon and trying to draw out little nuggets and for where that we are so we hope this morning that this is a blessing we encourage you to go back and study it and listen to it for yourselves along with your other study and we trust it'll be a blessing so he says observe the month of abi and keep the passover unto the lord thy god i'd like to emphasize first of all that first word observe so that's a commandment observed it says and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of that the lord thy god brought the fourth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you it's certainly wonderful to study god's word and so this morning we realized that there's lots of questions within the framework of the scriptures we have questions on our hearts we have things that we cross we hear people say things and our minds are stirred up our hearts are stirred up but we we know one thing for certain that if there's a bible question then a bible question has to have a bible answer if if you have a history question and you have a question about history you consult history so a history question gets a history answer and a math question gets a math answer and so a bible question has to have a bible answer it has to have something that comes from the scriptures to answer and it can't be just an answer that man provides it's got to be an answer that god provides so man might provoke the question but god is the only one that can answer it so a bible question can only be answered by the lord and that's the thing that burns in our heart and so there's a kind of a bible question wrote into this scripture it says observed in this month the passover because this is the month april that you were brought out and he said take up a flock of lamb and uh offer that lamb but offer this in the place he says the place which the lord shall choose to to place his name there and so our question in is where is that where is that place so in order to answer that bible question and if you're commanded to do something you certainly want to do it and i and i think this is a great uh question because i believe what we all want to worship the lord and so if we our hearts desire is to worship the lord then there there's got to be a way that that we can worship them and so the scripture says here he says in a place i place my name he says now if it's a bible question then we should have a bible answer and it should not be able to come from a group of man or any certain fellowship or from some educator or from some denomination it should come straight from the scriptures where god's meeting place is of worship and surely being god there is a meeting place somewhere that he meets now so being god there's got to be a place that god meets and we want to we want to if we just say that in in our heart as we just read a few statements but god desires to meet with man this morning not only does he want you to worship him but he doesn't just stand afar off and so your worship with god isn't something that is here and we just throw it up into the sky and that's kind of our idea of worship i think sometimes uh we've changed the meaning of worship to praise and talk we just he prays on somebody and and acculates and and many times people speak things of people and and the greatness that they have and and the wonders they are i hear people talk about athletes sometimes of how awesome they are and how they do this and how they do that i'll tell you how you judge how awesome somebody is is how they stand at the judgment seat uh that that proves who's awesome and who's not awesome you know uh a guy that can't pass the word test i don't think has got as much awesomeness as we think he does but they speak to these people and they they praise them and they they put accolades on them and oh he's the and they've never met them that they've never met them so uh if i could just try out maybe just set as we go forward this morning that we're trying to separate what true worship is from just praise and and and singing we love to sing i love to sing i i i didn't understand a word the brothers were saying this morning but i liked every minute of it i like the spirit of it i i like the enthusiasm i i know they were talking about god coming and the brother would keep singling and i kept looking up he's calling god down amen that that's what that puts we desire we enjoy doing that our sometimes our children they sing songs about the lord and maybe they don't fully comprehend it all but they they want to sing they want to worship they they want to be a part and those things are all good but we're talking about something that's so much deeper and more intimate the the gods of god in the worship we're talking about god participates in it part of the worship it's it's a it's a greater union than it's ever been before so it's a a marvelous thing he says and so god has a place that he meets so there there's a meeting a a meeting is a coming together of two parts okay you've got to have a a this meeting and so this meeting that god wants to have with his people uh he's the provider of that place so okay if we could just really get this in our thinking to this morning of really what it means a place uh you know it's a place that you go to a meeting place if we set up a meeting we say well i'll meet you at starbucks or i'll meet you at uh uh denny's i don't think anybody meets anybody at denny's anymore but uh someplace that that you say that you meet so you you you place a place there and then you say i'm going to meet you there you know each of us should have a meeting place with god we're we're encouraged to go into our closets we're encouraged to find a place that that we we uh pray so we set aside a place for the meeting place but so there's there's got to be something that's set and so somebody's got to set the appointment someone's got to choose the place and set the place and if you want to have lunch i love the lunch uh uh thing when we decide we're gonna have lunch together well where do you want to meet and you go through this and you go through that and you list four or five places and then you come up with a choice and and and then you decide okay this is where we're going to meet in this case god chose the place he chooses the place he chooses the meeting place now god told them before they established the temple and whatever they did i will choose the place of my worship and i will put my name in it and that's the only place that god would ever meet anybody was by his own choosing now in other words he's just not going to meet you in the place you picked look he's the one he's only going to meet you in the place that he chooses he's the one that makes the choice he's the one that that that picks the spot he says he and he says he chooses his place and where he chooses his place he puts his name the second verse here tells us that he would put his name in the place that he had chosen for the people to worship him in now the thing of it is we want to find out where that place is now why why do we pick a place you understand god's got a reason and a purpose that he chooses the place to meet now you're not going to go to a place that you're not comfortable in you're not going to go to a place that that that you don't have rest in and peace in you know you've meant uh just in such a carnal natural type but it's like we we go to these places sometimes and we say well let's meet here at this place and we've never tried that place before so we walked in and and we sit down and we're having we we've decided to meet here and fellowship here and the food's bad and the place is smoky and and the music's too loud everything you you you wouldn't go there but if you knew that ahead of time you would never pick that place as a meeting place so god knows what ground he can meet a man on he can't meet a man on a foul ground he can't meet a man in a a place that's not clean he can't meet a man in a place that that there's things that's going on that makes him uncomfortable or that he's not welcome he's not gonna set up in a meeting place where if i can say it this way he can't be himself he can't be what he is so he's not going to set up this meeting place on your grounds he's not you're not inviting him he's inviting you amen he's the author of the meeting you have not chosen me i have chosen you he's the one that can send the invite to the meeting and he says i will meet you you are invited to come you are invited to come meet me but you've got to come meet me on in the place that i provided for you to meet me because i know that place may i say it like this i can function in that place as a pastor we we have meetings you know people want to share something with me or they want to tell something with me now a pastor will never work from hearsay you know collect if you if you want to meet me don't send your wife with the message or don't send it by the way of gossip you know good don't don't send it some other way that's a way of a coward you know i i've done it a few times myself where i've been embarrassed something i did so i i bought something or something so i send leslie to bring it back go take this back i'm too embarrassed to to go do this or i don't want to face that person you know i mean i don't want to admit i'm wrong so i just fix that send my wife you know i mean unless they go go take this back for me you know what do i tell him well don't tell him i made a mistake but but you understand when god picks a meeting and he picks the place after we we have meetings and sometimes if the place isn't right you're just uncomfortable you can't talk maybe someone wants to talk about something that that's life-changing and you know the music pounding and the you know the people are all there and it's all loud and everything and you're trying to concentrate and and everything and it's just it it's just not a place to me now can you think that god might understand that he might understand that he wants to control the atmosphere of the meeting he so he chooses the place he says i'm going to meet man i'm going to choose the place now god told them before they established the temple or whatever they did i will choose the place of worship and i'll put my name in it and that's the only place that god would ever meet anybody was by his own choosing he chose his place and where he chooses his place he puts his name so that's what we so so we we know that we have a a bible answer here that there there might be uh uh different ideas and and all kinds of of different ways that we think but god chose where he would put his name and there's all kinds of different religions look there's uh uh as a brother testified at the a men's breakfast and and i really encourage your brothers if you can break away on a saturday morning to come out and and make it out to the men's breakfast it's a wonderful time of fellowship but the brother was testifying he says i tried everything he said i even went to utah for for four years and lived with the mormons to to be a mormon and and to try this and to try that and you can try a lot of things but you finally know when you've met god you know when it gets the right place and and and and so he he would uh every other religion that they they can't point to a tomb that's empty they can't point to a resurrected christ and so our great question a lot of time is how do we know that our god is risen well we might know it personally in ourselves but god's got a way of showing that he's alive he's got a way of play making it known that he is capable of choosing the place of worship and i like this statement because it's such a beautiful statement he says but christianity was established by jesus christ and there is an empty tomb he was the only man that ever stood on earth and lived and said i have power to lay my life down and to raise it up again and he did it and he lives today now that's a great statement folk if we say he lives today it would be a great bible question to say how do we know he lives today and we know he lives today because we have a bible answer that proves that he lives today and it says and we know he lives because he is with us and proves himself by physical signs and wonders that he promised that he would do to show it amen he promised how that he would show it he promised how that i will show that that i'm alive because i'll do physical signs and wonders to prove that it's so look when we talk about signs and wonders signs and wonders are to prove that there's a living resurrected savior that's alive and he cares about us he thinks about us he's mindful of us and so we know that christianity then is the the answer to what's truth of all of all that's out there there's only one faith that can prove that their founder if we could use that word or that their gospel is alive and resurrected amen i like that because i want i want to know that what i'm basing my eternal destination on israel i i wanna i i like the feeling that i have i know i have a personal revelation i've known for beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's meant me that he saved me i i feel that in my soul i feel it in my heart but i love when he proves it i love when he gives me that exclamation point i love when he shows he's standing there and he's working on my behalf and he's out there ahead of me doing things for me exceedingly and abundantly even above what i can ask or think that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he's real and he's the same in other words what he what was testified of him when he was alive he's doing those same things today proving that he's the same today and he'll be the same tomorrow boy that takes a lot of pressure off me i like a god that takes the pressure off yeah because satan's putting it on he said he said i have to listen to letting off the pressure satan puts it on god lets it off blessed be the name of the lord he says now if god chooses a place it behooves us then to find out what he said about it where it is i want to find it because truly i want to worship him that i think that's something that's really in the heart of a believer that you want to worship him i want to know where that place is i i i want to know what he said about it i know i want to know where it is and i want to find it now if i if i knew what he said about it that would be good and if i and and if i knew where it is that would be good but i want to find it now this morning if if we could say that that's that's it's we're required to observe this place and we're required to worship him and and so i think too many times that we approach christianity too casual like it like we can go about it any way that we want to or we can have any approach to it we want to or any other is something that we can lay up and lay down and walk to and walk away from but but that's not what worship is this is something that it's a meeting it's a face to face it's a one-on-one it's it's something that becomes personal between you and him and you know uh when you want to have a real meeting with somebody you don't invite in a lot of hearsayers and a lot of eavesdroppers and and a lot a lot of uh gossipers you know people that are gonna say things and spread things uh in political world they call it people that leak things out you don't want you don't want that you want this to be a private intimate place because this is worship worship is meaning that's when you're worshiping is when you're having a meeting when you're having that one-on-one when you're having that love affair going on because that that's that very personal relationship between you and him so you want to find out where it is is because you want to worship him now we sing praise together but your personal worship is you worshiping him and you want to know what you're worshiping and i just think this is such a tremendous statement he says you don't know what to do until you know how to do it you don't know what to do until you know how to do it and and so we we know that god so god chose this place of worship and he was going to identify it by putting his name there so if we know where he put his name then we know where that place is and if we know where that place is then we can find that place we can go to that place we can find out about that place we can find out where it's at and we can go there and find it if we know where that place is where he put his name and and what this place is then we can go there if we know where that is then we can go there and find it and so you say is this the place well this place is called christian life tabernacle i don't think that's where he put his name we come here to fellowship we come here to learn of him we come here to be corrected we come here to praise him and to encourage one another amen there is a church natural and there is a church a church natural and there is a church spiritual and this is a church natural but within this church natural is a church spiritual and then that worship god must worship him in spirit and in truth so even within our midst here there is a place here it may be within this place but god still has a place if you could picture it like a room or or a building or a certain thing that's got borders or boundaries around it that's what makes it a place and he's got a place and he says and god and he placed his name in that place that's where his name is amen and so we can simply find that he says god has not chosen to put his name in any denomination i want scripture for it i know they claim he has but he hasn't he cannot put his name in many places because he said he would put his name in one place in the place that i have chosen to put my name that's where you worship me and that one place each one of our denomination wants to say that they are that place but it's contrary but where did he put his name amen not titles right he didn't put it in titles he didn't put it in uh uh you know some sort of mystical uh place that it doesn't exist it it it it's a place now we find out that jesus said i came in my father's name and you receive me not i believe that's john 5 43 then the name of the father must be jesus that's right the name of the father is jesus jesus said i i carry my father's name i come in my father's name and you receive me not then his name was jesus now so we realized that god didn't choose to put his name in a temple he choose to put his name in a man this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in now do you understand he's fulfilled one half of the meeting you understand this is my son i put my name in him and i'm pleased to dwell there so i'm dwelling in the place of the meeting this is where i chose to put my name not in that temple over there not in a priesthood not in a system or an organization i chose to dwell in a man that's where i am so if you're going to meet me you've got to come to the place that i chose to meet hallelujah so we know that you can't have the meeting without him being there i've been in those type of meetings go tell my wife then and then the wife go tell my husband and you're like some sort of mediator well that's not what you said the first time that no no she changed your mind no that ain't a meeting meetings face to face you'll never get anything resolved it's got to be steadfast anchored so he said i'll be there i'll be there now it's up to you to come you want to worship then you've got to come you've got to come to the meeting i've picked the place just like in the greatest battle ever fought where there had to be a battle there had to be a battle where the two places were going to meet where the two enemies were going to meet where god was where satan was going to battle man and god was going to battle on the behalf of man they said okay we've got to have a meeting place there'll be a place that i'll be and there's place for that satan will be and that battleground was the mind there's got to be a plate that you meet well god just wants to have a meeting with you so he places his name in his son this is my beloved son even before he was born the angel of the lord came down and said call him jesus he'll be emmanuel god with us god's with us in christ so he picks this place and he comes down and he's in that place now why him one because he's without sin there's nothing there that keeps him from being there he's clean he's without blemish he's a perfect sacrifice he's perfectly submitted to the will of the father so god finds somebody a man because god wants to meet with man so man can't meet in a realm that he's not living in you can't you can't make contact with something until it comes into your realm you can't make contact with uh uh some sort of alien unless that alien comes in to your realm or you go in to his realm and please don't come and tell me that you went up into some alien realm because god chose to condem sin he chose to create a place of worship the firstborn the beginning of the creation of god his son the only begotten of the father so he picks a place and he says now i'm meeting you in this place this is the place i chose to meet this is where i put his name he'll be emmanuel which means god with us so god's gonna meet man in christ that's where we become new creatures is in christ jesus so god's picked his meeting place and there he is and now he's identifying he's the place i can not do these works unless the father shows me i do nothing in myself but it's the father that's in me that does the works what was he proving he was proving this is the place that i've chosen this is where i put my name this is the this is the uh uh identified uh place that i've put my name and that i'm dwelling now so this is my meeting place so our meeting place is in christ jesus that's the place and the name was placed in a man not a church not a denomination not a creed but a man he chose to place his name in jesus christ and we find out that then he becomes the place of god's worship where you worship him now that's half the story it's the other half i like [Music] because this is beautiful look he said even before he was born his name was called jesus it was so important it was given to his mother by the angel gabriel that his name would be called jesus son of god what he was and that's what he was there we have it then it's then is it there we have it then this is it alone it is for him alone him alone's god's chosen place of worship god's place chosen god chose to meet man was not in a church not in a denomination but in a creed not in a creed but in christ that's the only place that god will meet a man and he can worship god is in christ that's the only place no matter if you're methodist baptist catholic protestant whatever you might be there is only one place that you can correctly worship god that is in christ so there's no other worship is accepted outside of that but we're not talking about group worship we praise as a group we worship as an individual because you've got to have something that you're worshiping him for you don't know how to do it until you really know what it is so we know this place is christ yes it's it's jesus christ that man that was here had that name placed in him and from that place he put out the invite come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i will give you rest come unto me my yoke is easy and my burden is light come worship have i been with you so long and you know not who i am he who hath seen me have seen the father i am the temple of the of god god dwells in me i'm not even doing the work he's doing the work i don't do nothing until he shows it to me first which one of you can convict me of sin who was he he was emmanuel he was god god came down to man to reconcile man to be reconciled with the father in christ jesus now why is this place so in in beautiful and important to us because one we're not worthy now all of us here want more of god that's why you come this morning all of you want to learn of him because he said come learn of me and we we we all want to express ourselves but but no matter how good you are you are you still battle your flesh because the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these two are contrary one to another even paul says i die daily i bring my flesh into subjection so no matter how much you want to be a christian you still got your nature you still got your flesh you still got the things that satan can tempt you with the lust of the eyes the pride of life you don't become a christian and satan goes away he lets you know every day that he believes he can still get you and he only has certain realms that he can approach you in that's the five senses that's how he contacts you feel taste touched male hearing he attack and then he has the emotional side of you the emotions you know excitement and love and conscience and and all the things that aren't physically tangible but yet you feel them has anybody ever felt embarrassment well i've been embarrassed when there's nobody within 100 miles i remember something i said or i remember something i do and i almost look around to see if there's anybody noticing those are all things you feel in that realm those feelings in our emotions many times we we praise god from those realms those realms of the census are stimulated by atmosphere i i read quite an interesting article one time about you know i i never understood why everybody wanted to watch scary movies and they they say it's a real thing with i'm not picking on teenage girls at all but teenage girls like to go and get scared to death why is that because it's an atmosphere that affects those emotions and and being emotional that they they and being emotional beings they're moved on and dealt with more through the emotional side than they are the physical tangible side maybe like a fella is so they're given to those atmospheres there's given to what's created in an atmosphere to experience the these emotions and these feelings and act and this realm of senses and so that satan uses those and so he uses those senses and he uses those emotions to plant something in your mind and then to get you thinking about it and considering about it and reasoning that's why god said i've only got one place to battle i'm going to give you the best weapon and i'm going to put this weapon in your mind and it's the word because he is the word that's what this place was this place was the word of god no matter where you are young person no matter where you are middle-aged person no matter where you are elderly person it doesn't matter the answer to life is god's word [Applause] now let's go back to this meeting place this place is pure it's holy it's without sin it's the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world so this place of meeting god chose to to meet was in his sacrificial lamb a type of the passover also a type of the passover was the death angel when that death angel went over egypt and was going to travel for egypt god provided a place that they could go into a place that they were safe from the death angel and if they went into that place and they entered into that place it didn't matter what they were wearing it didn't matter who they were related to if you were in that place you were safe just like rahab that's right get them into this room get them into this place hang that scarlet friend which was a type of the same sacrifice that was placed in egypt that's how they knew to hang that thread because they had the blood on the post and if they knew the blood on the post kept death away they told her hang this scarlet ribbon out we know what that means hallelujah they knew the power of that blood they knew the power of that place they understood what that ribbon stood for when they marched around that city every one of those people knew why they were there they knew what they come out under they come under the shed blood of that lamb put on the doorpost they knew they were safe in there now here's god he picked the place and he's dwelling there this is the mediator between god and man there's one there's only one mediator between god and man it ain't saint teresa it ain't mary he don't have a secretary he's the mediator what do you have in a meeting hallelujah you have a mediator if you have a lawsuit god has a lawsuit against us we broke his law and the penalty of breaking the law is death so you've got to you've got to have a place so god invites you to a meeting but you've got to have a mediator so god picks this place this place that he creates now this place invites us god's already made his choice he's already dwelling there he says here i am now i want to meet you i'll meet you in here but we can't go in there i'm a skunk he'll know me he'll know what i'm thinking he'll know how my mom my mind wanders he knows how easy i'm tempted he knows how hot i get he knows i fail i'm a failure there's no good thing in me how am i gonna go in there and come face to face and meet this almighty god that's because he created a place that we could go into and meet him and leave our flesh at the [Music] door because i paid a price because i put the blood over your life because i threw everything that you did in the sea of god forgetfulness i'm inviting you as the mediator as a place of worship i'm inviting you to come in and meet my father that's this place now paul described it i want you to understand it's a place it's a place you can come with all your faults all your failures all your weaknesses all your mind battles but because he's the mediator he is the one that invited you to this meeting you didn't schedule it he scheduled it he sent the invite to you well you're yet a sinner he sent the invite he found you wherever you were he went through your life he come down your life's path he come to the place he came knocking on your door behold i stand at the door and knock if you will open up i will come in and mediate with you [Music] [Applause] this beautiful place it's here but we don't go in but listen what he says about this place paul trying to speak to this place the this place is the only place that you can correctly worship god and that's in christ he says he says so now in christ therefore he says romans 8 and 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit now we we misinterpret that so many times another jesus says i'm inviting you into this meeting despite your flesh [Music] i know you got flesh i know you got thoughts i know you've got feelings but i'm inviting you to leave that flesh at the door [Applause] don't walk in here according to the flesh [Applause] i put the blood on your flesh i paid for that now you've got something to worship him for now you have a ground to meet him on [Music] now you have something that's real you accepted his invite by the word you don't prepare to get there i love it when we want to go out and eat and then we kind of measure up how we're dressed to pick the restaurant well i'll tell you how you pick the restaurant not how you dress it's how much money you got in your wallet you can show up in blue jeans in a t-shirt and give the mater d a hundred dollars he'll give you a table you don't care that's all the things that will stand in between us in the meeting that we've got to lay down because we can't walk according to the flesh you can't walk into that meeting according to the flesh because he's not going to meet you on the basis of your flesh he's going to meet you on the basis of your divine inheritance and the fact that you're his son you're his daughter your name is on that book he recognizes of who you are and that's who he wants to meet he wants to meet his children he don't care well you were yet a sinner he died for you he knows you're battling your flesh he knows you're trying to get sin out of your life he knows you're trying to perfect he knows if you're trying to purge you wouldn't be there for the meeting if you weren't [Applause] he knows you want the meeting so he provided a place that you could come just as you are [Music] he provided it a place that you're free to come into with all your weaknesses all your shortcomings all your troubles all your sicknesses he says i'll still meet you when they offered a lamb couldn't have a blemish on it this lamb had no blemishes so he was the perfect sacrifice and everybody that was underneath that sacrifice was saved is that right and it's just like she says what we can make we can differ upon creeds we can differ upon man-made theories we can go to the methodist church you can have to be a methodist a baptist a presbyterian a catholic a catholic but once you're baptized into christ and become a member of his body there is no differences the middle wall of partition is tore down and you are free because you're in christ jesus and you are worshiping god in spirit and in truth when you are in christ jesus it's god's plan for you to worship him in christ jesus no differences i i i just i wanted to do this i thought about it all night long and oh i'm going to do this and then i thought it might not work but i i thought i was going to get maybe brother jomon here and then okay maybe brother manuel and and okay and then get brother hoel and and and if maybe five or six or seven different brothers from different countries uh different ethnicities to different ones and and so we could recognize all the difference and then i thought well i'll assign him a denomination right so you know maybe brother manuel would be methodist and and uh you know maybe brother dylan would have been disciples of christ all different all appear different all have different ideas maybe different taste and food maybe different styles of dress everybody's different but once you come into him there's no difference no differences [Applause] we've all entered into through the same door i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto this meeting nobody comes to the father but by me i'm the meeting place and before you can walk into that meeting you've got to accept what he did for you [Applause] amen he provided the wedding garment when someone tries to come in there without the garment he goes and says hey how did you get in here you didn't come through me and let me say this you cannot worship him with condemnation there is no condemnation in that meeting place he provided a place that we do not have to feel condemnation when we go there to meet him free from condemnation if you've accepted that i'm the mediator the lord speaking i set this meeting up i know my father can't meet with you in the condition you're in the thoughts that you have in your mind the weaknesses that you have you would perish in his presence but i he chose me because i so loved you that i laid my life down for you i'm the mediator i'm the patersionary i'm the one that allows you to come into the father and talk and have a meeting with the father because i'm the place that he came in and i made a way for you to come in there oh now we're not walking according to the flesh but we're coming in by the spirit lord i don't deserve to be here but my master and my lord arranged this meeting and he said i can have this meeting with you and i can come in here and worship you with a pure conscience because if your conscience condemns you god is greater than your heart if your heart condemns you he is greater than your heart i can come in here because he told me my name was written on the lamb's book of life [Applause] and i was predestinated to have this meeting that's the only place he meets you is in christ denominations will crumble and fall nations will pass away but he will remain forever no other place that a man can find to worship god that god will speak back to him a lot of people have one-sided worship but remember what we preached last week after the mountaintop the juniper tree after the juniper tree the cave and what takes place in the cave the steel small voice what is a cave it's a cliff in the rock a place that you can go and you can hear from god oh satan's a finger pointer you can't go in you can't go in here let me give you the list of all the thoughts you had last week man wow you're unbelievable how are you gonna go in i've been invited how can i go in there because it's a place that was made and created with everything within it that allows god to be there and me to be there at the same time it's a special created place and it's called christ jesus our lord oh my a place i can leave my flesh oh it's i got so much more i'm just gonna skip because you have the wonderful book we understand in that place the death angel couldn't come amen there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby a man must be saved we know that in acts 4 12 before he baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ they were telling him and this very one that you crucified he has made lord and savior and nobody there's no salvation outside of him he's the wake the truth we know that that's where he's dwelling but i'd like us to jump because uh if i could do that this morning and and you can go back and and it just it's just so beautiful so how many things that the prophet of god brings out that we want to understand why it's so important for us to have this meeting with god so we know the place of worship is jesus christ himself that place is his spirit that places his nature that places his love that and that's the only thing that we can enter in by is by his love he so loved us that he laid down his life for us that he covered our sins that he paid the price for him that he threw him in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more if you don't accept that a hundred percent for yourself you will walk in there with condemnation and he cannot be worshipped with condemnation because there's no condemnation in christ and if you're trying to worship god full of condemnation your worship can't be received and he receives worship from no other place but through him and that's what we know so our great question is is how do we get into there how do we get into there by one spirit we're baptized not a second third person not an emotional experience but by one spirit that's the spirit we're baptized with what was his spirit i will never leave you i will never forsake you i will not leave you comfortless but i'll be with you even in you till the end if you cast your cares upon me i careth for you if you confess your sins i am just and faithful to forgive you that's the spirit of god amen how are you born again by accepting his spirit his nature not an anointing you accept his promise you accept what he said you accept what he did for you you let that love come into your heart that the love of god might be shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit when they're in that upper room that that presence that come down it bore witness to his word they didn't receive anything that they hadn't heard they didn't receive anything that was promised my good friend doug mchughes he's gone on to be with the lord many of him you know him from his testimony i love that man and i can honestly say that man loved me because he's a christian he would have loved me despite myself look he said david brother ben told me this he said brother doug he said you can fast until you're as skinny as a toothpick you can cry until there's no tears left in your eyes you can pray and kneel on your knees all night long until they're raw he said you can shout and cry out till you have no more voice but god will never do any more for you than what he said he would do god keeps his word and if he ever does one thing one way he does it the same every way when you accept his spirit when you totally accept with nothing you've done no nothing you bring but you come just as you are and you lay yourself down and say lord i'm accepting what you've done for me i'm accepting the spirit that forgives me i'm accepting the spirit that will instruct me i'm accepting the spirit that'll lead me and guide me into all truth and righteousness i accept your spirit i take this leadership into my life i don't have a thing except for what you promised me and what you give me and i accept this word and i'm taking on the baptism wherewith you were baptized with in other words i'm taking on the nature that you have i'm taking on the judgment that you have i'm going to do things the way you do things i'm giving my life to follow you and when i fail i'm going to cry out abba father and you're just and faithful to forgive therefore i can come with that spirit that approach may i use the word that attitude lord jesus i'm entering into this worship place to meet your father based on your word no righteousness i bring i'm coming in here based on what you said what you said you did for me what you said was no longer laid to my charge who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect and when we can humbly come before him with that place that's how we enter into that place of worship we come through the spirit that he is and he is the word what's going to happen if you have this meeting can you put up paragraph 90. and i'm closing right here brother trevor will be ministering for us tonight so i command you all to come back for some reason i know that won't work because he commands us to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he commands us to take communion he commands us to do foot washing and we don't do that so obviously my command's not holding no weight but and it ain't even communion sunday i just want to make sure you know that you've entered in to that place paragraph 90. god had a certain place he meant he met abraham and there abraham worshiped all down through the testament now let's listen to these next words closely and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him all right he's made all these promises he's got to meet you meet you there he has no other place to worship what's another word for worship union fellowship becoming one with the promise for our day the worship of our day is the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride it's the coming together as one word husband and wife bride bridegroom they become one you are christ you are messiahs you are the word so now he says when you have this union and you come into this meeting and you have this fellowship in this place what is the result of that meeting what is the result of you meeting face to face with god that's why he said no preacher has a right to be in the pulpit until they've been on the back side of the desert and they've met him face to face paul said i didn't come to you with enticing words and the wisdom of man but i came to you with the power and demonstration of the holy spirit because he said and now he's interpreting his word that i have a message to the gentiles he's interpreting that word in me now listen this is the most beautiful two paragraphs i hope it excites you and he promised and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him his promised word was interpreted in abraham through abraham because abraham meant him in the place that god chose to me did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you are written epistles of god read of all men not what you claim but what god does through you [Music] will speak out louder than anything you could claim god said these signs shall follow them that believe that speaks through you [Music] through you how can it speak through you because you've come face to face you've met them you've been in there you took the invite you've came into christ and he said if you come into me the works that i do you shall do also because you're going to meet the same god i'm at amen that's who he's inviting us to the same god that i meant the same god that came in me i was spotless but because i was spotless i was able to lay down and make a way for spotless you to come into his presence and meet him that now through my sacrifice and my words and my promises in other words he said all that the father hath given me will come every promise i made because i laid my life down for you he will keep every promise i made to you and that will live through you if you've had the meeting he says i just want to read it again the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that we're living in you will be a written epistle of god read of all men everybody is going to see that you are the fulfillment of what he promised in the day not what you claim but what god does through you we can lay down the claims and let them speak speak yes here we are we've met them written epistles my life speaks of my experience but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim god said these signs shall follow them that believe that speaks through you he spoke of this age what would be now the believer of this age has to believe this what he promised today just the same as they had back into the ark to be saved they had to come into the ark to be saved go out of egypt to be saved they have to come into christ to be saved now into the word message that he's the same yesterday today and forever how do you get in it by baptism by baptism of what water by the holy ghost one spirit we are baptized into one body and his promised word he will you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you what you are doing what he promised to do the church that follows him will be so much like him until the people will know it what did they say these are ignorant and unlearned men but they've been with that guy that did all the miracles now what are they doing they're doing the same thing you see he's not in a church he's not in a doctrine he's in a place that he created that you can come into because he provided it what a beautiful relationship we have with the lord jesus i think of all the years i spent as a catholic all the candles i lit the plastic statues all the times i confessed my sins to the priest i just thought mine and one day i got an invite and i didn't want to go in there i knew i was dirty i i i i use some forms of drugs and i didn't want to give them up i tried to figure out ways i could be a christian i used to go around saying you know jesus used to smoke you know that worked for a while jesus had long hair all that stuff worked but you want to know something he never quit inviting me i never quit calling and pretty soon i wanted it more than i wanted that just like them just like the man he wanted what that man had and every time that says he said i want some of what you got joe he said okay let's go he'd walk out there he'd climb over the fort he walked out in the middle of the pig pen he kneeled down and that guy get up there and he looked at them boots and these are 900 ostrich boots i'm not i'm not putting them things in no pig pen and you look at the slacks you know man this is top-notch wranglers you know and i've got a diamond d shirt on and i got a stetson hat on all wrapped up with all kinds of worldly stuff but one day he didn't care he was going to climb over that fence and he was going to go in there already and then that great mediator spoke up you don't have to you just have to be willing to okay and uh i'll tell you i was suicidal i called my mama said mama i'm i'm i think i'm just gonna kill myself i'm so miserable inside and i don't know why i got the best drugs on myself i got money in this i got all this things i got everything i'm popular with the people and why am i so miserable why can't i find rest and here's this voice come unto me all ye that are heavy laden i will give you the rest i will give you the peace yes i will set up the meeting with the father just come as you are i made a place that you could come just as you are you don't have to make the preparations i've already made the preparation i prepared the place i made it so you could come in dressed any way that you are wealthy poor smart stupid stupid people have a better chance than smart people we never confess we're stupid well i just finally realized i'm one of the smartest people in the world i was smart enough to take his invite but i didn't do that by my strength i did it by his grace and his mercy but understand this place that if we enter into that place he promised us that he would interpret his word through us and that he would live his life out through us and isn't that our heart's desire this place that he made that he put himself was christ jesus if you haven't met him his invites to you if you've read about him you've seen him moving but you haven't found that personally ask him lord will you lead me to this place will you come and make this real to me will you set up a meeting between me just the way i am in the father that he can speak back to me and what do you think he said when i finally went there on that rooftop and i read that bible and that spirit came down and said your sins though there many are forgiven go and disbelieve no more thank you lord amen always remember i remember just i remember how i felt i felt i could i well the prophet of god said you're free and that's how i felt i felt free and now i want to come back to that place i want to lay down my religion i want to lay down my doctrines and my philosophies and everything i've learned all the things i know about the godhead and the laying on the hands of the sick and those things will do if god so permit but i want to walk out of my flesh leave my flesh at the door walk into his promise and have a face to face meeting with him again that he can interpret his word in me and he promised it he will do it that could never forget it's all about him it's all about what he provided for us not what we do for him he's done it all right let's stand together and brother billy is going to lead us in worship we're going to do something a little different we have three baptisms but we're going to go ahead and worship we're going to pray for anybody that needs to pray for we'll close the service and then we'll have a baptismal service afterwards for whoever wants to stay so we're not going to hold you through the baptism and like we normally do we want to do something but these people that are coming to be baptized they have a desire in their heart to have this meeting and to have their sins remitted and that they can enter in to this place of fellowship because there's no other place that god accepts or will meet man except in christ jesus let's bow our heads and pray our heavenly father this place you so created it you so made it you so designed it that we could come in just as we are the only thing father is is we have to accept the invite accept the word accept the spirit take that spirit that you had into our heart walk in their father and sit down and listen for that still small voice and lord you'll speak and bring your word to path oh i'm i'm thrilled father i'm thrilled in my heart because i know what you have in store for them that love you the scripture says it hasn't even entered into the hearts of men the things that god has prepared for them that love them but father you've gave us a glimpse through the revealed word of the hour you've given us a glimpse of the messenger father you put that sheaf in that wave offering out in front of us you sent that eagle swooping down a cross to give that eliezer cry lord and it caught our attention [Music] and you invited us to fly into the heavenlies lord and i know that we all got parts of our lives that we don't like we've all got things that we need to improve on we all got things in our memory that we've done that we wished we never but father to think that you've invited us into this place knowing all that and you made a provision that we could enter in and come and meet with you and you could talk to us we could talk it over with you you could say father i'm sorry that i'm so weak would you please strengthen me father these bad decisions just seem to sneak up on me and they catch me like a snare i don't even see it and then i find myself all entangled lord i don't want to do that i want to grow in your word father i want to be able to see satan and every one of his tricks i want to be able to take your word and live by it for men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god father i want to worship you with my life amen not with my voice because you said that you living through me that my actions would speak louder than any word that i could say and you promised in this day that men would know it that they could look upon a believer and be able to say there's something different about that man there's something different about that person they've meant something they've come in contact with something that's changed them father you said in your bible that those people that see that would inquire of us what is our hope lord and we can tell them about a meeting place we can tell them about a place that you came to that we could come to also and then christ jesus we could come face to face with our creator and receive resurrection and eternal life father i know i wasn't capable of even beginning to express it in its depth but father all's i can do is express it with words but you can bring it into a reality i can talk about the meeting father but you can make the meeting and i ask that you make it for every heart [Music] i would ask father if there's anyone this morning that's sick in their body and they would like to raise their hand [Music] father maybe they have a loved one like our brother's steph and his believe it's his mother's brothers in a hospital or my good friend harold brown they took him to the hospital for observation lord and you know i want to eat fish with him again lord i've got friends that their children are outside lord and i know they want to come in but they they just don't know how to navigate through the circumstance and lord i already believe your hands moving but father i pray that we wouldn't lose any of our children this morning father those that have raised their hands for themselves and for others father you had a meeting place for sickness and it was your stripes at calvary and you said that by those stripes we are healed then father we come to that meeting place that you provided your stripes to accept our healing this morning father those that need deliverance this morning and they'd like to lift their hands and say lord i'm so carnal you only come across my mind on the weekends lord i get so involved in things i have no time for you and i'd like to lift my hand this morning and say lord i want to have more meetings with you you've provided a place that i could come to in christ jesus you provided a spirit that i could meet you under a spirit of forgiveness and a spirit of love and lord i want to become acquainted with that spirit and come in that spirit i want to leave my flesh and my problems at the door and i want to walk into your presence and i want to cry abba father i worship you lord i praise you lord i really want to grow in you this morning lord i want to make the right decision according to your words no matter what i've done no matter what i've sowed no matter what i said i would do lord a bride doesn't make one step until she has thus saith the lord father we know that's your word lord i pray for myself this morning i don't mean to be selfish but i pray for these people that i love because you said that my office could mediate whose sins are forgiven they are forgiven and what's bound we can bound and we can lose and this morning father i pray that you accept us all this morning with our hearts desire to become deeper christian that you would interpret your word through us and we surrender ourselves to that this morning in jesus precious and holy name in the presence of jobs oh would you let a spirit just come close to yours [Music] is [Music] if there's anyone here this morning that thinks that

[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] god bless you nice to have all of you that have stayed for the baptismal service to once again watch people come and ask god to change their lives and to do something for them whether would you like to say anything right now no the water's cold but uh it is death by the way so therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus in whom you have crucified both lord and christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this upwards generation amen my brother the word of god said to go into all the world preaching the gospel and baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and by divine revelation and the keys to the kingdom peter knew that that name was no other name where a man could be saved save the name of the lord jesus christ the scripture commends us that all things that we do to do in the name of the lord jesus we know that there's no other name greater than the name of jesus so according to god's word our brother we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] he has a son and daughter if it makes you feel any better okay you can our gracious heavenly father lord this young sister wants to be baptized in your name lord in her heart she knows it's the right thing to do and she wants to follow in the way that's your way so according to the commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel and to baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost peter with the keys to the kingdom and divine revelation knowing that that name was none other than the name of the lord jesus christ we baptize our sister in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] you've got a wonderful testimony that you want to say a few words um yeah so when i go baptized it was in 2013 and um i got baptized in the names of like the father the son and the holy spirit so it was just like the name as um instead of like the name and the church that i got baptized in they gave me the identification card and then um i knew that it was the true baptism was that the church that i was going um in and then um when i came to the u.s i was like i need like a place where to worship and then i went to um this church called ancient but i just didn't feel like i had a community in there so i was like god just show me where uh i would like worship and just deepen my relationship with you then i came across people um who wanted me to do bible study with them and then we talked about baptism and what it should be but like the way they taught it to me was just different from everything and then i have a brother who lives in goma where i'm from and he's been listening to the message like the audience of brother branham and then i asked him about baptism and he sent me the audio so that i could just listen to them myself who was like i don't want me to like tell you things i just want you to hear like from yourself and then um he gave me the audio regarding baptism and i was like oh no i can't believe that i go baptized like this way and i've been like holding you know to eat thinking that is the right one when it's not the right one so i was like yeah this is um the right baptism that i want to like um get baptized in and yeah i asked him so what should i do i feel like i'm ready to do it the right way this time and then he gave me the number of um someone from jeffersonville and then because he didn't have like any contact with somebody here in texas then the person in jefferson will give my number to brother teddy from this church and then yeah so that's how i got to come here and yeah my time here like i've been blessed and i'm just so happy to be here and to just know the truth and yeah all i ask is just for god to strengthen me and to help me just to dwell in his house forever and my yes of today like the true baptism bas for like all my life yeah i just yeah i'm so happy and so grateful for everything the word of god promises to give you the desire for your heart amen and lord we know the true revelation of baptism what the name was the place you placed your name the place of worship and the baptism that comes with that place of worship is in the name of the lord jesus christ father to fulfill your word amen and the heart desire of our sister we baptize her in the name of the lord jesus christ all right [Music] oh uh orlando uh found chris sleeping in the pavilion behind the church he had just got put out on the street from our friendly uh law enforcement officers and so anyway he found his way here and orlando put him to work and started working for us and the lord has just been dealing with his heart and now he wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and and so we just are grateful for that in god's moving so last week we had a wonderful opportunity uh to baptize andre and and uh and you know the pools opened whosoever will amen so we just pray that the promise that of receiving the holy spirit follows that by the spirit of god our brother's life comes subject to the word of god and that we can see the redeeming power of god manifested in his life chris according to god's word and the commandments to go into the world and preach the gospel lord you heard the gospel through a man that met you in the back of this church and he told you the good things of god and when you entered into a fellowship and made yourself present and then you decided to come and be baptized so we carry out your request and the promises that you receive the gift of the holy spirit that the token can come across your life and and the blood redeems you and cleanses you from all unrighteousness with this great hope and this great promise and knowing the power of god to transform we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ these are truly people from the highways and byways amen so you know god can do it seemingly abundantly above what we can after saying amen to him this is brother danny these are one of the brothers that brother joseph and aunt gordon and chris harris and the other brothers that have gone down into dallas and they met him at a a homeless camp in dallas and they shared the gospel with them and they felt the love of those brethren and wanted to come in greater contact with the things of god they've come to several services and they also want god to do something that could change their life and just do something uh wonderful cosmon has been helping these brothers and doing a great work and we certainly appreciate that we also want to thank uh silas burns for washing the baptistry for us and cleaning it up you know it takes us all doing the part one to hear one to testify one to help and we're doing these great things so we're feeling the promise of god's word trusting that the lord will keep his promise to danny and fill him with the holy ghost and provide everything that he needs for his life to find direction and purpose do you believe god can do that [Music] i'm a witness of it so we appreciate it our gracious heavenly father lord you know this man's heart lord you also know the price that you paid for him the suffering that you went through that he could come to this pool father if you made a promise that he confessed his sins and he'd be sincere in his heart and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would give him your spirit to lead and guide him into all truth and righteousness with this promised father and with the commission to observe and keep your word knowing that we are to baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost knowing that those were titles but we knew what the name was and that name was the lord jesus christ god's provided place of worship the only place that god meets a man we baptize our brother in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you kids everybody just keep praying that many more that want god will find their way to the pool god bless you amen amen let's all stand and sing a song for dismissal amen in the name of jesus in the name of jesus oh and we have the vetoes oh it's in the name of jesus believe the name of jesus will have to and please we stand in the name of [Music] jesus in the precious name of jesus [Music] [Music] help me please i cannot today [Music] today [Music] you
