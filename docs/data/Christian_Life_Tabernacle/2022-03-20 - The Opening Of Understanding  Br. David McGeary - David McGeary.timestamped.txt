[11:39] good morning welcome house of the lord
[11:40] this morning beautiful day outside the
[11:43] first day of spring
[11:45] uh we've got many things to be thankful
[11:47] for amen
[11:49] this is our
[11:51] this little
[11:52] gathering this morning is a little slice
[11:54] of heaven this side of the
[11:57] the great divide
[12:01] i was reading this morning
[12:03] in the book of galatians chapter 5
[12:06] and paul says
[12:08] brethren
[12:10] ye have been called under liberty
[12:13] only use liberty
[12:15] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[12:17] the flesh but by love serve one another
[12:21] amen
[12:23] amen
[12:25] it's a trying time i know we're all
[12:27] burdened
[12:28] but this is the place we can lay down
[12:30] our burden amen we can leave here
[12:33] with freedom
[12:34] we're going to read psalm 125 this
[12:36] morning
[12:38] this kind of uh
[12:40] reflects the
[12:42] world events a little bit
[12:44] and maybe in our daily lives even
[12:50] i pray to be a blessing to all of us
[13:00] you know this uh this gathering this
[13:02] morning
[13:05] uh reflecting on this is is not our sole
[13:07] purpose is to try to come together
[13:10] with christians of
[13:12] we like to call it like precious faith
[13:13] and
[13:15] and praise the lord and lift up his name
[13:17] and
[13:18] and just benefit one another by being
[13:20] here
[13:22] we're actually called
[13:24] to a ministry
[13:28] and i like to think of this as
[13:31] just our recharging station
[13:35] we get built up here
[13:37] and sure we have prayers answered we
[13:39] come in reverence because the lord has
[13:41] met us here this place has been set
[13:43] aside and sanctified and it's a house of
[13:46] prayer it's a house of praise and
[13:48] worship
[13:51] and those that don't know the lord can
[13:52] find the lord here
[13:55] he finds they find the lord here because
[13:57] we brought him here
[13:59] this this place
[14:01] it'll burn just like the rest of the
[14:02] world
[14:03] it won't be preserved we won't come back
[14:05] and hold meetings here
[14:07] there will be a new jerusalem
[14:10] but we're thankful for this place we set
[14:12] aside
[14:14] but let's get filled up so we can go
[14:16] discharge that battery by preaching the
[14:18] gospel living a life amen
[14:21] so i hope the psalm 125 can reflect that
[14:25] this morning
[14:27] because we do put our trust in the lord
[14:29] let's read it together psalm 125
[14:33] they that trust in the lord shall be as
[14:35] mount zion which cannot be removed but
[14:38] abideth forever
[14:40] as the mountains are round about
[14:42] jerusalem so the lord is round about his
[14:45] people from henceforth even forever for
[14:48] the rod of the wicked shall not rest
[14:51] upon the lot of the righteous
[14:53] lest the righteous put forth their hands
[14:55] into it
[14:56] do good o lord unto those that be good
[14:59] and to them that are upright in their
[15:01] hearts as for such as turn aside unto
[15:04] their crooked ways the lord shall lead
[15:07] them forth with the workers of iniquity
[15:10] but peace shall be upon israel amen
[15:12] let's bow our heads
[15:14] dear gracious and kind heavenly father
[15:16] we thank you lord for the reading of
[15:17] your word we thank you for this

[15:22] and mighty way lord and just soothe our
[15:24] spirits calm our nerves lord may we

[15:36] the final lines
[15:39] of the final chapter
[15:42] of the greatest love story
[15:44] that's ever been told
[15:47] and lord it's hard to realize
[15:50] that you chose us lord

[15:55] with so many great
[15:58] messengers and
[16:00] lord servants and heroes of bible faith

[43:39] we want to say that we love you
[43:41] and we appreciate the grace that you've
[43:44] placed in our lives father
[43:47] how you've taken us from the sheepfold
[43:50] and
[43:51] made us partakers of your kingdom today
[43:55] father we just asked you this morning we
[43:57] could have a time of fellowship around
[43:59] your word
[44:01] that we'd be blessed and that you would
[44:04] be our portion this morning
[44:06] father we ask you to forgive us our
[44:08] trespasses and our shortcomings
[44:11] father bringing to your remembrance the
[44:14] great price that you paid
[44:16] we ask you to increase this morning our
[44:19] desire and love for you we ask these
[44:22] things this morning in jesus precious
[44:25] and holy name we pray
[44:27] amen
[44:28] amen well you're getting your bibles out
[44:31] this morning and turning to colossians
[44:35] we'd like to welcome all of our visitors
[44:37] and here we have
[44:39] a few out sick and then we have others
[44:41] that are out
[44:43] at the meetings in oklahoma and we
[44:47] certainly would like for all them to be
[44:49] blessed this morning but those of us who
[44:52] are here we can have a wonderful time in
[44:54] the lord amen
[44:55] and i'm sure some of those people are
[44:57] streaming and so we're grateful to have
[44:59] them today
[45:01] just before we start in our scriptures
[45:04] we have this little form that we
[45:07] put out back
[45:09] and the purpose of this is for us to
[45:12] kind of get an idea
[45:14] of what kind of children that we have
[45:18] for sunday school
[45:19] so we have we're trying to figure out
[45:21] how we can get some sort of sunday
[45:23] school started somehow
[45:25] so if you could just list your children
[45:27] or their ages and
[45:30] and just fill that out we can get a feel
[45:32] for how many uh
[45:35] we people we'd have to accommodate
[45:38] and so we're we have two uh
[45:40] possibilities one is gonna we'll have
[45:43] sunday school in the evening and the
[45:45] other we'll have sunday school earlier
[45:48] on sunday but the lord
[45:50] after richly bless you on that portion
[45:53] so let's turn in colossians this morning
[45:55] as
[45:57] we're just going to have a little bible
[45:58] study this morning
[46:02] kind of go through some
[46:06] wonderful
[46:07] statements as we've been studying this
[46:10] message the rising of the sun
[46:13] and if i had a title for this morning i
[46:15] would like to call it the opening
[46:18] of understanding
[46:20] the opening of understanding or you can
[46:23] make it personal the opening of my
[46:26] understanding or we can make it as a
[46:29] body the opening of our
[46:31] understanding but we'd like just to have
[46:33] it the opening of understanding so if
[46:37] you would turn with us to galatians
[46:39] i mean colossians excuse me
[46:42] and we'll read in the
[46:45] first chapter of colossians starting
[46:48] with the ninth verse and
[46:52] you know i believe that
[46:54] paul he was an apostle but i believe he
[46:56] was an evangelist i believe he was a
[46:59] teacher
[47:00] i believe he was a prophet
[47:03] uh i think he just kind of in
[47:05] embellished all of the
[47:08] traits of all the fivefold ministry
[47:11] but i think here's that kind of shows
[47:14] his pastor heart
[47:16] he says for this cause
[47:19] we also
[47:21] since
[47:22] the day we heard of it
[47:25] do not well let me just read the verse
[47:27] before so you could kind of get the
[47:29] background of it
[47:31] he's talking about
[47:33] ephrath our dearly fellow servant
[47:36] who is for you a faithful minister of
[47:39] christ who have declared unto us your
[47:43] love in the spirit so now this is paul's
[47:46] response to that
[47:48] remark
[47:49] for this cause we also
[47:52] since the day
[47:53] we heard it
[47:55] do not
[47:56] cease to pray for you
[47:59] and to desire that ye
[48:02] may
[48:04] might be
[48:05] filled with the knowledge of his will
[48:10] in all wisdom and spiritual
[48:13] understanding
[48:16] that ye might walk worthy
[48:18] of the lord unto all pleasing
[48:22] being fruitful
[48:23] in every good work
[48:25] and increasing in the knowledge of god
[48:30] strengthened with all might
[48:32] according to his glorious power
[48:36] unto all
[48:37] patients in long-suffering
[48:40] with joyfulness
[48:42] giving thanks unto the father
[48:45] which hath made us
[48:47] meant to be partakers
[48:50] of the inheritance of the saints
[48:53] in light
[48:54] who have delivered us from the power of
[48:58] darkness
[48:59] and has
[49:00] translated us into the kingdom
[49:04] of his dear
[49:06] son
[49:06] heavenly father bless your word to us in
[49:08] your precious name we pray amen god
[49:12] bless you may be seated
[49:17] uh
[49:18] we're just going to kind of go through a
[49:20] back over a little portion of service
[49:22] that we
[49:24] played here last sunday night
[49:26] and we won't um
[49:30] we won't uh
[49:32] play this portion again but we'll just
[49:34] pull up
[49:35] different paragraphs and put them on the
[49:37] screen
[49:38] and talk about it
[49:40] as i was
[49:42] um looking at my sermon this morning and
[49:47] how i was trying to put it together
[49:50] an old friend of mine came to mind
[49:52] after brother don ruttle
[49:54] and don ruttle would told me he says you
[49:57] know i preach
[49:58] like a beagle
[50:00] he said i go down and i find a trail and
[50:02] i go down this trail for a while and he
[50:04] said then i'll come back around and go
[50:07] down this trail for a while so we might
[50:10] kind of be like a beagle this morning
[50:13] going down different thoughts and
[50:15] different
[50:16] things together
[50:17] but we just hope that there's little
[50:20] nuggets
[50:23] in the framework of the word this
[50:25] morning
[50:26] that will bless your heart and increase
[50:29] our understanding
[50:31] because i think it's a wonderful thing
[50:33] when we understand things and our
[50:35] understanding grows
[50:38] one of the things we understand about
[50:40] the word of god is that
[50:43] you you can't
[50:44] do anything you can't go forward if you
[50:47] don't know what you're doing
[50:50] you you understand and so we understand
[50:55] what we're doing here this morning i
[50:57] thought brother tim's comments were so
[50:59] beautiful
[51:01] we're not
[51:03] just here this morning to go to church
[51:07] we're here because we believe that
[51:10] there's
[51:11] a
[51:13] condition
[51:14] or an event
[51:16] that is rapidly coming to the church
[51:20] and it's the resurrection
[51:22] of the saints
[51:24] it is a rapture
[51:27] that we are anticipating that any day
[51:31] now could take place
[51:33] and
[51:34] paul mentioned to it here
[51:37] spiritually he made this statement who
[51:40] hath delivered us from the powers of
[51:43] darkness
[51:44] and have translated us into the kingdom
[51:47] of his dear son
[51:49] so we have spiritually apprehended that
[51:52] kingdom
[51:54] in other words we're not under the rule
[51:57] of darkness
[51:59] but we are now sitting in heavenly
[52:03] places in christ jesus
[52:06] but yet we're still here
[52:09] and i think all of you
[52:13] know the effects of being here
[52:16] some of us are our body doesn't get out
[52:19] of bed as quick as it used to and all
[52:21] the things we did as young men are now
[52:24] showing up in our joints and
[52:27] of course some of you are young so you
[52:29] can only imagine what we're talking
[52:31] about but we we have a hope
[52:34] and that hope is that one day soon we
[52:38] will be young again
[52:40] amen and that not only will we be in
[52:43] that kingdom spiritually but we'll be in
[52:46] that kingdom physically
[52:48] and so we we want to understand
[52:52] after and have our knowledge of god
[52:55] increased and our understanding
[52:57] increased so that we can fight this
[53:00] fight and that we can be good soldiers
[53:03] and we can stand uh every while of the
[53:07] devil
[53:08] and uh that we will know him at every
[53:12] one of his tricks and
[53:14] we could stand fast in the knowledge of
[53:18] the lord and so we approached
[53:21] this this morning and there's some
[53:24] wonderful nuggets as we're approaching
[53:26] easter we may
[53:28] get through this message by easter but
[53:31] this was an easter message
[53:33] and we understood what easter is what
[53:36] gave us hope
[53:39] many a great man has died for a great
[53:42] cause
[53:43] and has went into the grave because he
[53:47] he laid his life down for others he laid
[53:49] his life down for his country he laid
[53:52] his life down in service for the
[53:55] uh his king
[53:56] but never has there been one that has
[54:00] risen
[54:01] from the dead
[54:03] and jesus said they don't take my life
[54:05] from me i give my life free i lay it
[54:09] down and i will take it up again
[54:12] even in this world today there's a place
[54:14] where there's a tomb
[54:16] and the people have this great hope that
[54:19] one day
[54:20] that their
[54:22] their prophet messiah or whatever
[54:25] how they view him will rise up and they
[54:28] have a horse there ready for him to ride
[54:31] and
[54:32] at the end uh and
[54:35] what a
[54:36] what a great faith
[54:39] i mean i admire
[54:41] their
[54:42] their
[54:43] uh
[54:44] faith but
[54:46] uh
[54:46] i'm disappointed because
[54:49] i know that they've they've missed
[54:52] the great thing that god's done
[54:56] and they're living in hope
[54:58] and not in possession
[55:01] we possess
[55:03] the resurrection
[55:05] if the same spirit that was in christ
[55:07] jesus dwell in you it will also quicken
[55:11] your mortal body you are not looking for
[55:14] something that is a hope you are not
[55:17] looking for something that is down the
[55:20] road you haven't missed anything you're
[55:23] right in god's time you're right in
[55:26] god's season god's got you where he
[55:29] wants you and we have the great hope
[55:32] because that he's given us the foretaste
[55:35] he's given us the earnest he he's placed
[55:38] the same spirit that was in him in us if
[55:43] this same spirit dwell in you it will
[55:46] also quicken your mortal body
[55:49] and so you can sit back this morning
[55:51] knowing that you've received something
[55:54] that is eternal
[55:57] and if you have eternal life you've
[55:59] always had eternal life god had you in
[56:02] his mind in the beginning he knew what
[56:05] you would be here he knew the color of
[56:07] your eyes the color of your hair the
[56:09] statute
[56:11] he knew all those things
[56:14] that's why all he foreknew
[56:16] he did predestinate
[56:18] amen and so we're we're grateful
[56:22] for that this morning
[56:24] and if you
[56:26] don't have that spirit
[56:29] then
[56:30] there's been a way made for you
[56:33] to have that spirit
[56:35] there's been a way made for you
[56:38] so you don't want to sit here this
[56:40] morning
[56:41] and to judge yourself uh short
[56:45] we preached i believe it was last sunday
[56:47] night don't sell yourself short
[56:50] if if you're lacking in your life or you
[56:53] have a problem in your life you have a
[56:55] habit in your life there's been a way
[56:59] made for you
[57:01] that you can obtain
[57:04] that which
[57:06] you desire
[57:07] and that's why the preaching of the word
[57:10] is what it is it brings you under
[57:11] conviction it it causes you to be
[57:14] stirred up it creates in you and you
[57:17] feel that conviction
[57:19] that is really your spirit telling you i
[57:23] don't want this
[57:25] in my life
[57:27] this doesn't make me feel good this
[57:29] doesn't do anything for me i want to be
[57:32] free from that that's what the
[57:33] conviction of the holy spirit is is i i
[57:37] don't want to be under this i want to be
[57:39] delivered
[57:40] and so we thank god for conviction every
[57:43] child when he's chastised you know don't
[57:47] don't think it's terrible when you're
[57:48] chastised if you're chastised of the
[57:50] lord you can thank the lord that he's
[57:53] dealing with you now
[57:55] if if you if if i preached against
[57:58] something maybe alcohol or or drinking
[58:00] or something like that if you're a
[58:02] drinker and you don't mind it don't
[58:04] bring you under conviction
[58:08] you know what i mean i heard it all my
[58:10] life oh jesus drank wine
[58:13] you know if jesus was here today he'd
[58:16] drink beer they don't understand that
[58:18] nazarite vow they don't they don't
[58:20] understand that life that's set aside
[58:23] above the norm and that's what we're
[58:26] talking about we're talking about a
[58:27] people in this generation that's called
[58:31] above average
[58:33] we're talking about a people that is not
[58:36] going on on a nominal scale is not going
[58:40] on a denominational scale but wants to
[58:43] soar into heavenly places that wants to
[58:47] be
[58:48] what he was
[58:51] the works that i do shall you do also
[58:54] that's where our heart is resting this
[58:57] morning that he's the same yesterday
[59:00] today and forever so we just want to
[59:03] kind of go through just a few statements
[59:06] uh with you and
[59:08] and
[59:10] as we we we talked you know a lot of
[59:12] times people want to know
[59:14] uh is
[59:16] are certain things important
[59:19] or not
[59:21] and so i i'd like just if the brothers
[59:24] would
[59:26] maybe uh put up here a starting
[59:29] paragraph
[59:31] uh
[59:32] a 163 and
[59:35] and i just want to take this little
[59:38] section here this little trail like i
[59:40] said like kind of like the beagle this
[59:42] morning and discuss this little portion
[59:46] of scripture with us this morning that
[59:48] our understanding
[59:50] might be just increased a little bit
[59:53] you know and so we and that's what we
[59:55] want we want our understanding open
[59:58] and so he says here in
[1:00:01] in this
[1:00:04] uh
[1:00:05] scripture
[1:00:06] here
[1:00:08] he's talking about and he's talking
[1:00:10] about the scripture in saint john 5 24.
[1:00:14] and
[1:00:15] and if we would just read that real
[1:00:18] quick saint
[1:00:19] john
[1:00:20] i believe it is 5
[1:00:22] 24.
[1:00:34] it says verily verily i say unto you
[1:00:37] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:00:40] him that sent me have everlasting life
[1:00:44] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:00:48] is passed from life unto death
[1:00:52] is passed from death unto life excuse me
[1:00:56] and uh so
[1:00:58] uh
[1:00:59] so as we begin to look at that
[1:01:02] we begin to see that it doesn't mean so
[1:01:05] much that heareth my word
[1:01:08] because anybody can hear the word
[1:01:11] but the real meaning of heareth means to
[1:01:15] understand my word
[1:01:17] he that understands what i'm saying
[1:01:20] and my sheep hear my voice
[1:01:23] and another
[1:01:24] stranger they will not follow look in
[1:01:27] other words we understand what he says
[1:01:31] and there's a way by which understanding
[1:01:35] is given to us
[1:01:37] and it's not the way of man
[1:01:40] man who wants to increase your
[1:01:41] understanding of their of what their
[1:01:44] system is what their world is what their
[1:01:47] society is what their culture is and
[1:01:50] remember education
[1:01:52] science and civilization is of the devil
[1:01:57] it only came here through the fall
[1:02:01] in the garden you were just born into
[1:02:04] this world you were born in sin shaped
[1:02:07] in iniquity and you came into this world
[1:02:10] speaking life
[1:02:12] you came into this world with if i could
[1:02:15] just
[1:02:16] because of lack of vocabulary and
[1:02:18] education i would say you came into this
[1:02:21] world with animal instincts
[1:02:25] and so man wanted to
[1:02:29] conform everybody so they educated them
[1:02:33] and they started to teach you manners
[1:02:35] they started to teach you this and the
[1:02:37] way we do this and the way we do that
[1:02:40] and it's very difficult to separate from
[1:02:43] traditions in ways that you have
[1:02:46] to separate from the traditions of men
[1:02:50] but we are separating from the
[1:02:52] traditions of men because we're not
[1:02:55] under the culture of man anymore we're
[1:02:58] under the culture of god's word
[1:03:00] and i i've said this before
[1:03:03] culture god's word doesn't conform to
[1:03:06] culture
[1:03:07] culture conforms to god's word
[1:03:11] so it doesn't matter if your ancestors
[1:03:14] have taught you things for years and
[1:03:16] years and years when god's word comes
[1:03:18] along
[1:03:20] there's a choice that has to be made
[1:03:24] and believe it or not that was the great
[1:03:27] battle because the the jews were under
[1:03:30] the traditions of their fathers and
[1:03:33] jesus came and was giving them an exodus
[1:03:36] out of the law
[1:03:38] into the leadership of the spirit and
[1:03:41] grace
[1:03:44] and it wasn't easy
[1:03:47] to make that transformation
[1:03:50] neither this morning
[1:03:53] is it easy for you
[1:03:57] to make the transformation
[1:03:59] from flesh
[1:04:01] to spirit
[1:04:04] from hearing
[1:04:06] to understanding
[1:04:09] another it's not by nature
[1:04:12] that we want to move higher
[1:04:15] or move into a place that we've never
[1:04:17] been before or that we want to grow our
[1:04:21] nature is to set up camp
[1:04:26] find some water science find some food
[1:04:29] find some shelter and stay put
[1:04:33] but we've got to go beyond the camp
[1:04:37] and we we set up camp as we go a long
[1:04:41] life journey
[1:04:42] spiritually
[1:04:44] people started maybe in the basic
[1:04:46] fundamentals and then they moved on into
[1:04:49] uh like the the journey from
[1:04:52] justification
[1:04:53] it wasn't hard it was hard for people
[1:04:56] that came out under luther
[1:04:58] which soon denominated and had every
[1:05:02] characteristic of the catholic church
[1:05:06] except for going into the box
[1:05:10] and confessing the sins and doing
[1:05:12] penance
[1:05:15] everything was almost identical
[1:05:18] and then when wesley came
[1:05:21] and the revival of sanctification moved
[1:05:24] on it was very difficult for people who
[1:05:27] had set up camp in justification to move
[1:05:30] on to sanctification
[1:05:34] and when the pentecostal
[1:05:36] blessings fell
[1:05:38] okay and and that's all that we would
[1:05:41] describe it is the restoration of gifts
[1:05:46] it was difficult for people to go move
[1:05:48] into praying let me tell you what the
[1:05:51] old saints did people started praying
[1:05:54] and when they prayed and they called out
[1:05:57] to god
[1:05:59] they received the spirit of god that's
[1:06:02] right
[1:06:03] they called it the baptism of the holy
[1:06:05] spirit
[1:06:07] it was to them they looked back in the
[1:06:10] scriptures
[1:06:11] and related it to the feeling of the
[1:06:14] spirit that took place at pentecost
[1:06:18] and where that they spoke in tongues
[1:06:22] and men began to pray for that
[1:06:25] and as they prayed for that they began
[1:06:27] to feel that spirit
[1:06:30] move into their lives
[1:06:34] and they had a real experience with god
[1:06:38] because they were
[1:06:41] dry
[1:06:43] and formal
[1:06:45] and they were without leadership
[1:06:48] their leadership was based in their
[1:06:51] dogmas
[1:06:52] and their denominations and their
[1:06:55] traditions they went to mass they went
[1:06:58] to church they sang choir hymnals they
[1:07:00] baptized they already had what they
[1:07:03] believed there was no life
[1:07:08] so when the spiritual blessing came
[1:07:13] and they experienced that
[1:07:16] the early
[1:07:19] church of the restoration of the gifts
[1:07:22] they the only place they had to go was
[1:07:24] door-to-door
[1:07:27] they would go explain it in the
[1:07:28] scripture and they'd go to talk to
[1:07:31] somebody and they sit down and they
[1:07:32] visit with them and they tell them about
[1:07:34] this experience and it actually went
[1:07:37] forth the way the gospel is supposed to
[1:07:39] go forth from faith to faith
[1:07:44] because they experienced it
[1:07:48] and they would share with them look what
[1:07:50] happened to me we pray and this we felt
[1:07:53] the spirit of god fall upon us and we
[1:07:55] lifted our hands and we praised god and
[1:07:58] we spoke in tongues but it wasn't long
[1:08:03] until it denominated too
[1:08:08] tongues became the evidence of the holy
[1:08:10] spirit
[1:08:11] they divided into jesus name baptism
[1:08:14] oneness trinitarians
[1:08:17] and different things they begin to
[1:08:18] follow the same pattern
[1:08:22] because it's always hard
[1:08:25] to move up
[1:08:27] and to keep moving
[1:08:30] so
[1:08:30] we don't want to be comfortable this
[1:08:32] morning
[1:08:34] we want the word of god to flap its
[1:08:36] wings over our nests
[1:08:38] and force us to fly into the heavenlies
[1:08:45] so we want
[1:08:47] understanding this morning
[1:08:51] and i'm going to try not to get excited
[1:08:53] and i'm going to try not to get
[1:08:54] evangelistic i'm going to try to stay
[1:08:56] calm
[1:09:02] because this gets me excited
[1:09:05] so let's just read here
[1:09:07] so you're talking about
[1:09:11] understanding you know as you could go
[1:09:12] to the down the street and meet a drunk
[1:09:15] right and say did you know god hell yeah
[1:09:17] i heard the preacher so because he says
[1:09:20] now
[1:09:24] he says he that understandeth my word
[1:09:28] he that is an eagle
[1:09:31] so we've already cut the beginning of
[1:09:33] separation of understanding
[1:09:35] so i hope that you would see that
[1:09:38] understanding is what separates you
[1:09:46] he says he says out in this 1603 he says
[1:09:51] ask
[1:09:52] in the marriage in divorce case the
[1:09:54] other day
[1:09:55] when the holy spirit told me that
[1:09:58] i came and said it just the way he told
[1:10:01] me and many of you
[1:10:03] remember the sermon marriage and divorce
[1:10:06] because there was a great
[1:10:08] controversy and there still today is a
[1:10:12] great controversy about marriage and
[1:10:14] divorce that is always one of the
[1:10:17] greatest problems
[1:10:19] in the church so i'm not talking this
[1:10:21] morning about any of your marriage
[1:10:22] situations at all wherever you are
[1:10:26] whatever your situation is from this
[1:10:29] moment on go a hundred percent
[1:10:32] with god
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:36] he says when the holy spirit had told me
[1:10:39] that
[1:10:40] i'd come and said it just the way he
[1:10:42] told me
[1:10:43] and some minister lady gave me a sharp
[1:10:45] little balling out
[1:10:47] see she said i guess you take the place
[1:10:51] of god
[1:10:53] i said no ma'am
[1:10:57] said well you told them their sins is
[1:11:00] forgiven
[1:11:01] said
[1:11:02] where
[1:11:03] said only god has power
[1:11:06] see another pharisee
[1:11:10] now the pharisees were void of the
[1:11:13] understanding of the motive and
[1:11:16] objective of god's word they could read
[1:11:19] the letter of it but they had no
[1:11:21] understanding of what it said what it
[1:11:24] meant
[1:11:24] or what god was trying to tell them in
[1:11:27] the word of god
[1:11:31] and paul summed it up like this the
[1:11:33] letter killeth but the spirit gives life
[1:11:39] so okay so we want our understanding
[1:11:42] increase this morning how that the
[1:11:44] spirit
[1:11:45] gives life
[1:11:48] so we'll just read it said
[1:11:52] he said i said
[1:11:55] okay you see that you might know that
[1:11:59] jesus told peter
[1:12:02] and the apostles after he had the
[1:12:05] revelation of who he was now
[1:12:08] this is a i just want to settle on this
[1:12:10] just for a quick moment
[1:12:13] and we'll try to move quickly
[1:12:15] a lot to cover
[1:12:17] he said
[1:12:18] he said blessed art though
[1:12:22] son of jonah
[1:12:24] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:12:27] you
[1:12:28] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:12:31] revealed it
[1:12:33] upon this rock
[1:12:35] i will build my church
[1:12:38] and the gates of hell
[1:12:40] cannot prevail against it
[1:12:43] now you understand so there's something
[1:12:46] that god can give the believer
[1:12:49] that keeps the gates of hell prevailing
[1:12:52] against them
[1:12:54] and and i want to tie that down to
[1:12:57] understanding
[1:13:01] and where that you could understand it
[1:13:03] so he said it was by this revelation
[1:13:06] that peter had by divine revelation
[1:13:10] something that you received from god
[1:13:14] is what anchors you to a spot that the
[1:13:17] gates of hell cannot prevail against you
[1:13:21] it's when you lack understanding
[1:13:26] that the doorway is open
[1:13:30] for
[1:13:31] something to be
[1:13:34] infused
[1:13:37] into your thinking
[1:13:40] because man seeketh after understanding
[1:13:45] that's what
[1:13:47] god eve
[1:13:50] was reasoning
[1:13:54] pilgrims and i
[1:13:56] i give unto you the keys
[1:13:58] whatever you bind on earth it'll be
[1:14:01] bound in heaven
[1:14:03] what you
[1:14:05] and what you loose on earth
[1:14:07] it will also be loosed now he says
[1:14:10] that's
[1:14:11] that divine revelation
[1:14:14] of the word made flesh
[1:14:17] now
[1:14:18] just if we just sit there for a second
[1:14:22] another word jesus
[1:14:24] told when peter got the revelation
[1:14:28] of who that he was
[1:14:30] he says now that you have the revelation
[1:14:34] or the understanding of who that i am
[1:14:38] so by divine revelation peter knew that
[1:14:42] jesus was the son of god
[1:14:47] now what did the jews say that he was
[1:14:50] carpenter's son
[1:14:54] is this not jesus of nazareth isn't his
[1:14:57] father a carpenter
[1:14:59] but peter saw that this
[1:15:02] was the lamb of god
[1:15:06] who was going to take away the sins of
[1:15:08] the world
[1:15:10] so
[1:15:13] so it was by
[1:15:15] this understanding
[1:15:19] another word for revelation
[1:15:22] by this understanding
[1:15:25] that
[1:15:27] that the word
[1:15:29] was made flesh
[1:15:32] now isn't that what we're here this
[1:15:34] morning because we believe
[1:15:36] that this is a time
[1:15:39] where the bride is going to be made
[1:15:43] flesh word
[1:15:49] that's what we're looking for
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] john said hearing is the love of god
[1:15:56] made perfect
[1:15:57] that as he is
[1:15:59] so are we in this world
[1:16:02] isn't that our desire we say it to be
[1:16:05] more like jesus we sing it
[1:16:08] but we understand we just don't want it
[1:16:10] all in our mind
[1:16:14] but we want our flesh to be quickened
[1:16:20] this
[1:16:21] peter now
[1:16:22] has this understanding
[1:16:25] right he has this revelation of who he
[1:16:27] is so now that he had that understanding
[1:16:32] this is why peter could go out and say
[1:16:35] he said that was divine revelation of
[1:16:38] the word made flesh
[1:16:40] if it was flesh in that day by the sun
[1:16:44] the groom
[1:16:45] its flesh today by the bride
[1:16:51] see
[1:16:53] now this is this is just lays here
[1:16:56] so beautifully simple
[1:16:59] he said if it was made flesh in that day
[1:17:03] in the groom
[1:17:08] so now he's pointing
[1:17:11] he had a divine revelation peter did
[1:17:14] peter went out and baptized
[1:17:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ by
[1:17:21] divine revelation
[1:17:24] it was divine revelation that caused
[1:17:27] peter to baptize the way that he did
[1:17:32] now without understanding you read the
[1:17:35] scripture and you say oh it says father
[1:17:38] son and holy ghost that would be the
[1:17:40] natural way for someone to take that
[1:17:44] word and interpret it
[1:17:47] but with understanding
[1:17:52] and that's what peter had
[1:17:54] he had an understanding so the
[1:17:57] understanding
[1:18:00] of the revelation of who he was
[1:18:03] manifested in his flesh
[1:18:06] caused him to baptize the way that he
[1:18:09] baptized so him baptizing
[1:18:12] the way he baptizing was the revelation
[1:18:16] now put into action in word flesh
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:23] you see what i'm saying
[1:18:26] so if it was flesh in the groom
[1:18:30] then it's got to be flesh in the bride
[1:18:33] so if it was if that's exactly what
[1:18:36] happened then
[1:18:38] and then he said who's that whosoever
[1:18:41] sins you remit
[1:18:43] to them they are remitted
[1:18:45] and whoever sends you retained to them
[1:18:48] they are retained let's just turn to
[1:18:50] that real quick it's
[1:18:52] uh matthew
[1:18:56] 16.
[1:19:06] it don't matter does it if we just take
[1:19:08] a second and just lay these things right
[1:19:10] down
[1:19:11] in god's word and and have a a real
[1:19:13] study
[1:19:15] of his word so that we know
[1:19:18] uh
[1:19:19] we're
[1:19:20] we're solid in that
[1:19:28] and he said unto them
[1:19:30] and that can you know the scripture
[1:19:31] before some say that thou art john the
[1:19:34] baptist some elijahs and others jeremiah
[1:19:37] are one of the prophets
[1:19:41] that's man's thinking
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:45] peter is going to get an understanding
[1:19:49] of the word
[1:19:51] he said unto them but whom say ye that i
[1:19:55] am
[1:19:56] and simon peter answered and said thou
[1:19:58] art the christ the son of the living god
[1:20:02] how would you like to been there
[1:20:08] yeah we
[1:20:10] doubt our christ
[1:20:12] the son of the living god
[1:20:15] oh no
[1:20:16] man when it struck peter
[1:20:21] i imagine that that he shouted glory and
[1:20:25] praise he worshiped
[1:20:28] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:20:30] living god i see it i understand it
[1:20:34] i've got it
[1:20:37] another peter
[1:20:39] what just happened to you
[1:20:43] the enlightenment of your understanding
[1:20:45] what just happened to you
[1:20:47] is what's going to make
[1:20:50] the flesh become word
[1:20:57] something's got to happen
[1:21:04] let's read as we go
[1:21:06] he says
[1:21:08] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:21:10] blessed art doubt
[1:21:14] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[1:21:17] not revealed it unto thee but my father
[1:21:21] which is in heaven
[1:21:23] and i say unto you that thou art peter
[1:21:26] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:21:29] church and the gates of hell cannot
[1:21:32] prevail against it
[1:21:34] he said watch this is this this
[1:21:36] statement he said now the catholic
[1:21:38] church picked up on
[1:21:40] on that and it taketh their priest
[1:21:43] but that was carnal
[1:21:47] but now watch what the carnal part they
[1:21:50] turned it into a
[1:21:52] sacrament
[1:21:54] or a ritual
[1:21:56] really the revelation is
[1:21:58] the word being made flesh
[1:22:04] he said
[1:22:05] watch
[1:22:06] it is spiritually revealed
[1:22:13] watch it was spiritual revealed word
[1:22:17] that
[1:22:18] did it
[1:22:20] it was a spiritual revealed word that
[1:22:24] caused peter
[1:22:27] to do what he did
[1:22:31] same thing with marriage and divorce it
[1:22:32] was spiritual revealed word
[1:22:36] that caused the messenger to do what he
[1:22:39] did it'll be spiritual revealed word
[1:22:43] that will cause you to do what you do
[1:22:52] it's the only thing that's going to move
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:55] the only thing that's going to change
[1:22:57] you
[1:22:58] you can see oh maybe i'll accidentally
[1:23:01] jump ahead i was going to try to follow
[1:23:02] some notes for a change in my life
[1:23:09] but it's the only thing that's going to
[1:23:10] allow you to rise above
[1:23:13] the battle you have in your flesh
[1:23:20] it was spiritual revelation
[1:23:24] it was it was the spiritual revealed
[1:23:27] word that did it
[1:23:28] that's the reason he told them to
[1:23:31] baptize in the name of the father son
[1:23:34] and holy ghost he knew they knew who he
[1:23:37] was
[1:23:41] see yes
[1:23:43] it was this he didn't go out and baptize
[1:23:46] what he said
[1:23:50] but because he had spiritual
[1:23:52] understanding of the scripture
[1:23:55] that scripture now became flesh
[1:23:59] and was manifested in the very actions
[1:24:03] of his life
[1:24:08] that's why people in pentecost today
[1:24:11] what we've got today those real
[1:24:14] bill real genuine
[1:24:19] people who know that the experience of
[1:24:21] god's word they're starving in their
[1:24:24] churches
[1:24:28] i have some good uh
[1:24:30] you united pentecostal preacher friends
[1:24:34] and can i say and talk with the brother
[1:24:37] uh
[1:24:38] one time we just had a wonderful time of
[1:24:40] fellowship
[1:24:42] and the church was dividing between
[1:24:44] those that wanted to keep the traditions
[1:24:47] of dress
[1:24:48] and
[1:24:50] didn't want to go modern
[1:24:53] and there became the old-fashioned and
[1:24:55] the modern
[1:25:00] that's sad
[1:25:03] because the words never change
[1:25:07] and the experience has never changed
[1:25:10] it's the understanding of it
[1:25:14] that's changed
[1:25:16] they've lost the spiritual revelation
[1:25:19] and understanding of god's word
[1:25:25] yes sir
[1:25:28] and so you come up
[1:25:31] with the attitude
[1:25:34] is
[1:25:35] what difference does it make
[1:25:39] but remember
[1:25:41] we've been talking about the dynamic
[1:25:43] power of the holy spirit the dynamic
[1:25:46] power of the holy spirit starts through
[1:25:50] divine revelation
[1:25:58] i've watched it all my life especially
[1:26:00] when i first became a christian when i
[1:26:02] was a hippie
[1:26:05] i can't tell you how many guys i went
[1:26:07] down to the bay with
[1:26:10] who got all worked up
[1:26:12] and was going to walk on water
[1:26:19] now that's just an emotional workup
[1:26:23] you know how many people i've seen
[1:26:27] don't just take somebody that's death
[1:26:30] or take somebody who's blind
[1:26:32] and think they're going to perform some
[1:26:34] sort of ceremony over them
[1:26:38] speak in tongues shake them do something
[1:26:41] and cast that
[1:26:43] spirit out
[1:26:47] jesus even said some of these spirits
[1:26:49] aren't even moved without much fasting
[1:26:52] and praying
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:57] and having an experience that's not
[1:26:59] grounded in the word
[1:27:02] that they're just children in the gospel
[1:27:05] they're all emotional worked up and just
[1:27:08] because they've read something in the
[1:27:10] scripture with no understanding
[1:27:12] whatsoever
[1:27:17] they're going to go work it up
[1:27:19] they're going to go perform it
[1:27:24] that's why they crash
[1:27:29] how many people have tried to
[1:27:31] impersonate
[1:27:32] and their car wrecks
[1:27:34] a long life's journey
[1:27:38] you can't compare yourself to anybody
[1:27:40] else you sit there and base your
[1:27:43] experience on your experience and your
[1:27:46] revelation with god's word
[1:27:49] we are not a denomination
[1:27:52] we are not a group and we may not all
[1:27:54] believe the same thing or have the same
[1:27:56] understanding but you better know your
[1:27:59] lord and savior
[1:28:05] and so we we understand that so what did
[1:28:07] he say he said it it was the spiritual
[1:28:11] revealed word that did it
[1:28:16] spiritual revealed word that had him
[1:28:19] tell the church
[1:28:22] spiritual revealed word it's got to be
[1:28:24] the spiritual revealed word in you
[1:28:30] that's going to bring you
[1:28:35] to a level
[1:28:37] that the works that i do shall you do
[1:28:40] also
[1:28:41] we'll just move quick so is it necessary
[1:28:46] so the question came up of water baptism
[1:28:49] is it necessary
[1:28:51] and
[1:28:53] so
[1:28:54] why is water baptism necessary this is
[1:28:56] now we're going down another trail
[1:29:00] why is water baptism necessary
[1:29:04] well there's no name
[1:29:06] given under heaven
[1:29:08] wherein a man must be saved
[1:29:11] than the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:29:15] i am the way the truth the life
[1:29:18] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:29:21] now
[1:29:22] i know there's a lot of
[1:29:24] religions in the world and i know this
[1:29:27] whole spirit and christianity today is
[1:29:30] oh the hindus are all right no the
[1:29:32] hindus are lost
[1:29:36] oh you're judging
[1:29:39] no
[1:29:40] i didn't say they were lost
[1:29:43] jesus said he was the way the truth the
[1:29:45] life
[1:29:47] so you say well what do you do about all
[1:29:49] those hindus i'll tell you exactly what
[1:29:51] you do all the father hath given me will
[1:29:55] come
[1:29:58] you can rest in that
[1:30:02] my sheep know my voice and another they
[1:30:05] won't follow i don't know the time
[1:30:08] i don't know when i don't know how but
[1:30:11] the way i know
[1:30:17] and there is no other way
[1:30:22] and i'm not ashamed of that paul said
[1:30:25] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:30:27] christ because it's the gospel that's
[1:30:30] the power of god unto salvation
[1:30:34] you can't take the gospel out and expect
[1:30:37] to have the spirit
[1:30:42] you get all kinds of nonsense
[1:30:48] you know
[1:30:50] the charismatic movement that was just
[1:30:52] the spirit on hippies
[1:30:57] sorry i hope that didn't offend anybody
[1:31:01] but i was one
[1:31:03] and i'm still trying to get rid of a lot
[1:31:05] of it
[1:31:07] but i'm going trying
[1:31:10] but we get so soft
[1:31:13] we want such inclusion
[1:31:18] that we toss the word of god out
[1:31:22] come out from amongst them my people and
[1:31:25] be ye separate amen
[1:31:29] how can two
[1:31:31] walk together unless they agree
[1:31:36] it's hard to come out of a church
[1:31:40] when all your friends are there and all
[1:31:42] your kids friends are there and
[1:31:44] everything's there and you know in your
[1:31:46] heart the man ain't right you know in
[1:31:48] your heart the church ain't right you
[1:31:50] know in your heart the doctrine ain't
[1:31:52] right
[1:31:56] you think it's easy to move up with god
[1:31:59] no
[1:32:02] you think it's easy today
[1:32:05] for us
[1:32:07] to move up higher
[1:32:09] we're fooling ourselves
[1:32:12] i've never seen a time in my whole life
[1:32:15] where the church has been spending the
[1:32:17] last
[1:32:17] 15 years patting one another on the back
[1:32:20] saying pete
[1:32:22] you're redeemed you're saved you're this
[1:32:24] you're that
[1:32:26] well let's start putting it into the
[1:32:28] flesh
[1:32:30] let's start moving up
[1:32:34] let's just unquote
[1:32:36] the scripture the work said i'll do
[1:32:38] shall you do also let's do the works
[1:32:48] so
[1:32:49] we we see it now so why is it important
[1:32:52] i just like to go to paragraph
[1:32:55] 182
[1:32:58] and we'll just take a nugget out of this
[1:33:00] and move quickly on
[1:33:03] salvation
[1:33:04] alone
[1:33:06] goes in the name
[1:33:08] of jesus christ
[1:33:12] whatsoever you do in word or deed
[1:33:15] do it all in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:20] there
[1:33:21] is not another name no church
[1:33:24] no hierarchy no title
[1:33:27] no nothing else
[1:33:29] yet he is the rosa sharon he's the lily
[1:33:32] of the valley he's the morning star he's
[1:33:35] alpha omega the beginning and the end
[1:33:38] jehovah jirei jehovah raphae jehovah
[1:33:40] massey all these
[1:33:43] he is all those things but yet
[1:33:45] there is not salvation in any of those
[1:33:50] titles
[1:33:56] jehovah no salvation rose of sharon yet
[1:34:00] he is
[1:34:02] no
[1:34:04] he is
[1:34:05] no salvation father son and holy ghost
[1:34:08] no salvation only the name of jesus
[1:34:11] christ and the bible said
[1:34:14] that repentance and remission of sins
[1:34:17] must be taught in his name beginning at
[1:34:21] jerusalem and in the utmost parts of the
[1:34:24] earth
[1:34:26] let's just turn to that
[1:34:30] because so
[1:34:32] that's luke
[1:34:36] the 24th chapter
[1:34:40] so what we're talking about now is we're
[1:34:42] talking about our understanding being
[1:34:45] increased
[1:34:46] so i work
[1:34:48] how are we approaching this this morning
[1:34:50] we're bringing things out
[1:34:52] and we hope that you're seeing oh
[1:34:56] i'm getting some understanding oh
[1:34:59] we're trying to demonstrate in the flesh
[1:35:03] what it means when god increases your
[1:35:07] understanding or opens your
[1:35:09] understanding what does it do for you
[1:35:12] first of all the truth sets you free
[1:35:20] right
[1:35:22] it lets you hear his voice
[1:35:27] anybody can read this bible
[1:35:31] but it's those whom the spirit is
[1:35:33] opening their understanding
[1:35:35] let's just read the 45th verse of luke
[1:35:40] 24.
[1:35:47] you know this great story don't you
[1:35:50] is people walking on the road
[1:35:54] to emmaus
[1:35:57] with jesus with them
[1:36:02] and them not seeing it
[1:36:06] why because what
[1:36:08] they were blinded
[1:36:10] but now look
[1:36:12] at the way
[1:36:14] it transpired
[1:36:17] remember it was spiritual revelation of
[1:36:20] the word that
[1:36:22] did it
[1:36:28] any
[1:36:29] and
[1:36:30] yeah and this thing said that
[1:36:33] he
[1:36:35] he's you know he
[1:36:37] the 44th verse it's a hard one he said
[1:36:40] in them
[1:36:42] these are the words which i spoke unto
[1:36:44] you well i was yet with you
[1:36:48] that all these things must be fulfilled
[1:36:50] which were written in the law of moses
[1:36:53] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[1:36:55] concerning me
[1:36:59] i don't think they still got the picture
[1:37:02] and then he says here he says then
[1:37:05] opened he
[1:37:07] their
[1:37:08] understanding and that they
[1:37:11] might understand the
[1:37:14] scriptures
[1:37:18] the opening of understanding
[1:37:23] is the key
[1:37:25] to moving forward
[1:37:29] pray for revelation
[1:37:31] the church never understands the
[1:37:35] importance of revelation they traded
[1:37:38] revelation for dogma they traded
[1:37:41] revelation for church teaching they
[1:37:44] traded revelation for tradition god
[1:37:47] cannot move you forward without
[1:37:50] increasing your understanding
[1:37:57] you'll never get it
[1:38:00] you can't stay camped out
[1:38:04] quit looking back
[1:38:06] quit looking at your back life look
[1:38:08] forward let him show you something and
[1:38:10] walk in it
[1:38:21] and he said and then he said after their
[1:38:24] understanding he said on them
[1:38:26] thus it
[1:38:29] thus it is written
[1:38:32] and thus it behooves christ to suffer
[1:38:38] that is
[1:38:40] fabulous
[1:38:41] why did christ have to suffer why did it
[1:38:44] behoove him
[1:38:47] in other words
[1:38:49] he's saying there
[1:38:52] this is what was written of me
[1:38:56] father let this cup
[1:38:58] pass me
[1:38:59] but nevertheless
[1:39:01] thy will be done
[1:39:05] he agonized in the garden
[1:39:09] until he sweat blood
[1:39:13] but i want you the process that's taking
[1:39:16] place in him
[1:39:18] because this is the way god works
[1:39:20] god increases your understanding now it
[1:39:24] behooves you
[1:39:26] am i going to take the path of
[1:39:28] understanding in revelation
[1:39:34] is it necessary
[1:39:36] is it important
[1:39:39] or am i going to listen to oh shirley it
[1:39:42] doesn't make a difference
[1:39:48] cut the voices out
[1:39:53] cut the influences out
[1:39:56] this is the age of voices this is the
[1:39:59] age of finger-pointing
[1:40:01] and everything
[1:40:02] but it's just this simple
[1:40:06] he said it behooved
[1:40:09] christ to suffer
[1:40:11] and to rise
[1:40:13] from the dead the third day and that
[1:40:16] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:40:19] be preached in his name
[1:40:22] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[1:40:25] and ye are witnesses of these things
[1:40:29] behold i send you the promise of my
[1:40:32] father upon you but terry in the city of
[1:40:35] jerusalem
[1:40:37] until ye beat endude with power from on
[1:40:40] high
[1:40:42] now let's just read this he said
[1:40:45] and that's the scripture you say
[1:40:48] do you think it makes a difference
[1:40:53] yeah it makes a difference
[1:40:56] because remember
[1:40:57] john only preached
[1:41:00] repentance
[1:41:04] john couldn't preach remission
[1:41:07] because up until calvary
[1:41:09] the only thing that could be preached
[1:41:12] was repentance
[1:41:16] repent
[1:41:19] that's all they did
[1:41:22] repentance
[1:41:24] will not take you further
[1:41:29] because
[1:41:30] jesus at calvary remitted
[1:41:33] their sins
[1:41:35] in other words
[1:41:37] they're gone
[1:41:38] before calvary only repentance after
[1:41:42] calvary thrown in the sea of god's
[1:41:44] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[1:41:47] so you're not just preaching to repent
[1:41:53] but you're also got to understand that
[1:41:55] there's remission
[1:41:57] and that remission only comes in one
[1:42:00] name
[1:42:02] that's why baptism in the name of the
[1:42:04] father
[1:42:07] and the name of the son and the name of
[1:42:09] the holy spirit which isn't even how the
[1:42:11] scripture reads
[1:42:15] but with no spiritual understanding you
[1:42:17] end up with three gods
[1:42:22] and that never makes any sense
[1:42:27] there ain't a theologian in the world
[1:42:30] that can sit down and defend the trinity
[1:42:34] in the scriptures
[1:42:39] and when you have a clear understanding
[1:42:42] of the godhead
[1:42:44] they try to talk about the blood water
[1:42:46] blood these three
[1:42:47] agree in one
[1:42:49] but the other ones these three are one
[1:42:54] i am
[1:42:55] the lord god amen
[1:42:59] you'll never you'll never get
[1:43:01] okay and i
[1:43:03] you know before my conversion i was a
[1:43:05] catholic catholic started the trinity
[1:43:10] it wasn't started at the day of
[1:43:11] pentecost
[1:43:13] it was started by the catholic church
[1:43:16] and what do they have they have a vicar
[1:43:19] instead of christ they have a man that
[1:43:22] they believe sits in the seed of christ
[1:43:25] and he was the one that started baptism
[1:43:29] in the name of the father son and holy
[1:43:31] ghost all things that you do do in the
[1:43:34] name of the lord jesus christ except
[1:43:36] baptism
[1:43:46] i mean it doesn't
[1:43:48] it doesn't make sense
[1:43:53] oh i've had them hold up the egg
[1:43:56] it's a shell
[1:43:58] it's a yoke
[1:44:00] and it's a white
[1:44:04] yeah
[1:44:06] nobody eats the shell but a chicken
[1:44:09] that ain't eagle food
[1:44:12] a lot of people separate the white out
[1:44:15] and only eat that
[1:44:18] and they take the yoke
[1:44:20] but in the beginning was the word
[1:44:23] and the word was with god and the word
[1:44:26] was god and if you take god you've got
[1:44:29] to take his word
[1:44:36] you just
[1:44:38] you know
[1:44:40] it's just it's so simple
[1:44:42] but without understanding
[1:44:45] when jesus hung on the cross
[1:44:48] he said my my god
[1:44:50] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[1:44:53] wait a minute
[1:44:55] i thought he was god
[1:44:57] i thought he was the second person
[1:45:05] how did he have the father wait it was
[1:45:07] the holy spirit that that overshadowed
[1:45:10] mary
[1:45:11] they get on this beagle trail you know
[1:45:14] why they all have the mark of the beast
[1:45:16] i mean the
[1:45:17] baptism didn't mean to say that in the
[1:45:19] name of the father son and holy ghost
[1:45:22] because they're all daughters of the
[1:45:24] great harlot
[1:45:29] that's what unites them all
[1:45:35] but i didn't want to go there
[1:45:38] but it makes a difference
[1:45:42] because there was no remission of sins
[1:45:45] till after calvary and that's what
[1:45:47] they're preaching that go into all the
[1:45:50] world can preach every missions of sin
[1:45:52] in my name
[1:45:54] preach the remission of sins in my name
[1:45:58] that's why all the places in the book of
[1:46:00] acts that they ever baptized they
[1:46:02] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:46:05] christ they baptized in jesus name
[1:46:09] was until the nicaea council that they
[1:46:11] ever baptized that way
[1:46:17] and so the
[1:46:18] so that's why we see the importance of
[1:46:21] baptism
[1:46:23] because of the fact there wasn't
[1:46:25] remission of sins till after calvary
[1:46:29] and that's what the gospel is
[1:46:31] and then just working our way to a close
[1:46:33] here now
[1:46:34] let's just drop down to paragraph 78.
[1:46:43] what a question
[1:46:47] and he said
[1:46:48] now
[1:46:50] the next thing
[1:46:52] will you believe
[1:46:54] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:46:57] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:47:03] and when this
[1:47:04] new
[1:47:05] eternal life dwells in you
[1:47:07] it's a potential the question is will
[1:47:10] you believe
[1:47:13] you know what
[1:47:14] belief is belief is faith
[1:47:17] faith has two parts
[1:47:19] first of all it's acceptance
[1:47:23] a pardon's not a pardon until it's
[1:47:24] accepted
[1:47:26] as a pardon
[1:47:27] he can do everything that he said he did
[1:47:30] for you but until you accept it and tell
[1:47:33] you you can't keep looking back and
[1:47:35] saying oh i'm so bad i'm so terrible i
[1:47:38] did all this i'm no good i can never get
[1:47:41] any closer to god and drag this mistake
[1:47:45] whatever you made in your life pull
[1:47:47] yourself all down life's journey with
[1:47:50] this thing
[1:47:52] it's like remember the crow
[1:47:56] i think they call it johnny crow or
[1:47:58] something
[1:47:59] he was tied by a string
[1:48:01] the farmer caught him and he drove a
[1:48:04] stake in the ground tied a string on him
[1:48:08] and he would only go as far as that
[1:48:10] string would let him
[1:48:15] but one day
[1:48:18] some other crows came by
[1:48:21] and said hey you know you've been set
[1:48:23] free
[1:48:25] there's been a proclamation all crows
[1:48:28] are free
[1:48:30] and they cut the string
[1:48:34] and he was so
[1:48:36] used
[1:48:38] in his mind
[1:48:39] in his habits
[1:48:41] in how far he would venture in life how
[1:48:44] far he would venture in god
[1:48:46] how how far okay he would move up he was
[1:48:50] so used to that string holding him down
[1:48:53] where he couldn't go any higher with god
[1:49:00] that's all the farther he went even when
[1:49:01] he was set free
[1:49:04] he never accepted
[1:49:07] the strings been cut
[1:49:10] well you were yet a sinner he died for
[1:49:14] you
[1:49:15] he did not go to the cross
[1:49:17] hoping
[1:49:19] you would believe on him
[1:49:23] he didn't hang there and say oh i hope
[1:49:26] there's some people out there that'll
[1:49:28] believe in me
[1:49:31] i love that song when he was on the
[1:49:33] cross i was on his mind
[1:49:38] he died for his own
[1:49:41] he died to redeem his own
[1:49:46] he even he even spoke this i thought it
[1:49:48] was a a great uh
[1:49:52] a scripture
[1:49:54] it's a luke 10 20.
[1:49:57] if you don't mind just turning to luke
[1:49:58] 10 20
[1:50:00] real quick
[1:50:04] just trying to
[1:50:05] just lay a few things to bless us this
[1:50:08] morning
[1:50:17] so you know the story he sends them out
[1:50:20] and they do all these signs and wonders
[1:50:21] they come back in luke 10 20. she says
[1:50:26] and he said unto them in luke 18 i
[1:50:29] beheld satan as lightning falling from
[1:50:31] heaven
[1:50:33] behold i gave you power
[1:50:35] to tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:50:39] and over all the power of the enemy
[1:50:42] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:50:49] right but listen
[1:50:51] notwithstanding
[1:50:54] in this
[1:50:55] rejoice not
[1:51:01] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:51:06] that is the best description
[1:51:10] of the prosperity movement
[1:51:12] the faith movement the pentecostal
[1:51:15] movement they're all rejoicing because
[1:51:18] they have power over
[1:51:21] devils
[1:51:24] but he said don't rejoice in this but
[1:51:27] this is an understanding they don't have
[1:51:33] but rather rejoice
[1:51:40] because your names
[1:51:42] are written
[1:51:44] in heaven
[1:51:45] rather rejoice because your name's on
[1:51:48] the lamb's book of life that's why the
[1:51:50] gospel of this age came to give you
[1:51:54] understanding that your names are
[1:51:56] written on the lamb book of life before
[1:51:59] the foundation of the world and he came
[1:52:01] to die for his home all that the father
[1:52:04] hath given me will come
[1:52:11] and so in closing this morning as we
[1:52:16] talk about these
[1:52:18] great things
[1:52:20] and we'll read this just for a moment
[1:52:26] he says in verse
[1:52:28] 191
[1:52:31] now when you get the dynamics
[1:52:34] you have been quickened from mortal to
[1:52:36] immortality
[1:52:39] right isn't that the promise if you have
[1:52:41] this spirit
[1:52:43] this spirit will quicken you
[1:52:45] he that believeth on me and has my
[1:52:48] spirit he shall never die
[1:52:51] amen
[1:52:54] do you understand that
[1:52:57] oh death
[1:52:59] where's your stain
[1:53:01] oh grave where's your victory
[1:53:03] i have fought a good fight
[1:53:05] i've ran a good race
[1:53:07] i'm waiting for the crown that's laid up
[1:53:10] for me
[1:53:14] put it to rest already
[1:53:17] this isn't our home
[1:53:20] it's getting so bad
[1:53:23] most of the christians i know don't even
[1:53:25] want to stay here anymore
[1:53:31] but it makes you
[1:53:33] when the get the dynamics
[1:53:35] you have been quickened from mortal to
[1:53:38] immortality
[1:53:40] it makes the whole body come into
[1:53:42] subjection to the word
[1:53:44] it'll make you act different
[1:53:47] look different
[1:53:48] live different
[1:53:50] it just
[1:53:51] makes you
[1:53:53] different
[1:53:55] galatians 5 and 16.
[1:54:04] this i say then
[1:54:06] walk in the spirit
[1:54:09] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:54:11] the flesh
[1:54:12] for the lust
[1:54:14] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:54:18] and the spirit
[1:54:20] and the spirit
[1:54:22] and it is against the flesh and the
[1:54:25] spirit against the flesh
[1:54:27] and these two are contrary one to
[1:54:29] another
[1:54:30] so that you cannot do the things
[1:54:34] that ye would
[1:54:37] oh that is battle time
[1:54:43] the spirit makes your flesh come under
[1:54:45] subjection
[1:54:47] you better be ready for the battle you
[1:54:50] better be ready for the mind battle
[1:54:52] because it makes you different when
[1:54:54] you're called out now you're different
[1:54:56] you're different than the world kids in
[1:54:59] school you're different you're wearing
[1:55:00] dresses they're running around in gym
[1:55:02] shorts
[1:55:05] don't you ever
[1:55:06] let a gym teacher a principal or anybody
[1:55:10] ever get you to put those gym clothes on
[1:55:13] you go get me
[1:55:15] i'll sit in their office i'll explain to
[1:55:18] them god's word and i'll challenge their
[1:55:22] morality
[1:55:24] to this gospel
[1:55:28] you don't got to compromise
[1:55:35] we had a sister one time
[1:55:38] she loved music
[1:55:40] she got a full-ride scholarship
[1:55:43] to
[1:55:43] you
[1:55:44] texas christian university which believe
[1:55:47] me is just a name
[1:55:51] just like baylor ain't no baptist
[1:55:53] college
[1:55:57] it might be where the baptists get money
[1:56:00] and they might have a little teeny
[1:56:02] little program you put there but if it
[1:56:05] was a real baptist college sorry for any
[1:56:08] of you that are going to baylor
[1:56:09] or wherever you're going
[1:56:13] but if it's a real baptist college they
[1:56:15] would be leading people to jesus christ
[1:56:17] every day
[1:56:20] but they're not baptist after john the
[1:56:22] baptist
[1:56:25] i don't know what they're after
[1:56:36] so we're on this great question
[1:56:40] of believing
[1:56:43] and accepting
[1:56:45] so we see here that it makes you
[1:56:47] different
[1:56:49] that's where the battle comes in
[1:56:52] because the flesh is warring against the
[1:56:56] takeover of the spirit
[1:57:02] right because the spirit's going to
[1:57:05] bring this body
[1:57:06] into subjection to the word how does it
[1:57:10] work how does it take place by spiritual
[1:57:12] revelation that's what does it god
[1:57:15] increases your understanding you see
[1:57:18] what's right and now you've got to take
[1:57:21] that understanding and bring this flesh
[1:57:24] under subjection
[1:57:27] the flesh don't want to go under
[1:57:29] subjection
[1:57:31] i love believing the word
[1:57:36] but oh
[1:57:39] this guy resists it
[1:57:45] i don't mind turning my cheek the first
[1:57:47] time
[1:57:50] but it's almost impossible for me to
[1:57:53] turn my cheek the second time
[1:57:57] and the scripture tells me jesus
[1:58:01] he opened not his mouth
[1:58:09] you know i always want to say or at
[1:58:11] least i want you to know i know
[1:58:13] that you're doing me wrong
[1:58:21] i want you to know i've got you figured
[1:58:23] out
[1:58:27] it's so hard to sit there and say don't
[1:58:29] say a thing
[1:58:33] just
[1:58:34] let it go
[1:58:36] i'm in control
[1:58:38] be christ-like
[1:58:43] no i want to tell them they need to get
[1:58:44] saved
[1:58:46] you disagree with me you need to get
[1:58:48] saved that's what you need
[1:58:50] you need to see it my way
[1:58:53] oh the battle's there the battle's on do
[1:58:55] you understand you we're all talking
[1:58:57] about moving up right we're all talking
[1:58:59] about getting higher with god we're all
[1:59:01] talking about getting close to the lord
[1:59:03] we're all talking about doing the works
[1:59:04] that he do you think you're going to get
[1:59:06] to that place without a battle
[1:59:10] you think you're going to get to this
[1:59:11] place without bringing this flesh into
[1:59:14] total subjection you know what religion
[1:59:17] is religions are covering
[1:59:22] people cover up the flesh with religion
[1:59:25] because they don't want to bring it into
[1:59:27] subjection
[1:59:31] because it ain't easy
[1:59:35] and no man hateth himself
[1:59:39] but he loveth himself and he nourishes
[1:59:41] himself and he protects himself it's not
[1:59:44] easy
[1:59:46] it's a battle
[1:59:48] the battle just begins
[1:59:52] it's tough
[1:59:54] it's hard
[1:59:58] we got religion
[2:00:00] we put on malachi 4 5.
[2:00:03] we put on revelations 10 7. we put on
[2:00:06] luke 17 30.
[2:00:08] we've got we've got the doctrines that
[2:00:10] nobody else has got we don't need to put
[2:00:11] on doctor we need to put on him
[2:00:18] you want to grow higher
[2:00:20] it ain't going to happen
[2:00:21] without you getting this flesh
[2:00:24] into subjection
[2:00:26] it ain't going to happen as long as
[2:00:28] bitter and sweet is flowing out of the
[2:00:30] same fountain
[2:00:33] not going to happen
[2:00:37] no wonder he said when you get the
[2:00:38] spirit it's in potential
[2:00:42] why is it impotential because there's a
[2:00:44] battle that's got to be won there's a
[2:00:46] flesh that's got to be overcome
[2:00:50] there's got to be a desire will you
[2:00:52] believe it will you accept it
[2:00:56] because that's what faith is is
[2:00:57] acceptance faith is a possession
[2:01:00] will you take the promise will you
[2:01:02] accept it and by this promise yes amen
[2:01:07] not by your might
[2:01:12] not by power not by might but by your
[2:01:14] spirit saith the lord
[2:01:17] will you take that promise of god's word
[2:01:20] that promised you that this flesh to
[2:01:23] come into subjection and take that flesh
[2:01:27] and go to war with yourself
[2:01:36] it out
[2:01:39] you got to possess the gates of your
[2:01:41] enemy
[2:01:42] you got to be perseverant
[2:01:46] you got to speak the word
[2:01:49] and go forward
[2:01:52] you got to come out of the nest
[2:01:54] out of the chicken yard
[2:01:57] you got to flap your wings
[2:02:00] that's what it is it's a great battle
[2:02:03] you say why is it important i'd just
[2:02:04] like to bring this real quick to 93 and
[2:02:07] 94 and then we're done
[2:02:12] it says
[2:02:13] here he says
[2:02:14] now
[2:02:15] how can you claim to have that spirit
[2:02:19] and throw yourself away
[2:02:22] from the word
[2:02:33] you're quickened by something
[2:02:35] else
[2:02:40] for it will quicken your mortal bodies
[2:02:44] to the word sure it will
[2:02:48] but you gotta fight for it
[2:02:52] you can't run without it
[2:02:56] you can't run without understanding
[2:02:59] understanding of the word is what gives
[2:03:03] you
[2:03:03] the revelation and the power of god's
[2:03:07] word to overcome you can't run without
[2:03:11] it
[2:03:12] that's why you've got to be baptized in
[2:03:14] the name of the lord jesus christ you
[2:03:16] can't run without it you can't get any
[2:03:20] higher your expansion in god's word will
[2:03:23] not grow
[2:03:25] that's right
[2:03:26] you've got to get out everything that's
[2:03:28] not word
[2:03:32] you've got to pray for understanding of
[2:03:34] everything the opening of your
[2:03:37] understanding
[2:03:40] you want to move forward in the lord
[2:03:41] everybody will raise their hand you've
[2:03:43] got to have your understanding open lord
[2:03:47] open my understanding let me look let me
[2:03:52] live
[2:03:57] you can't run without it you'll sputter
[2:04:00] if you don't believe all of it
[2:04:05] it can't be part water impart gasoline
[2:04:10] in order to reach its full potential
[2:04:15] it's got to have all word
[2:04:18] it's got to have understanding of the
[2:04:21] word may you increase in the
[2:04:23] understanding and the revelation of
[2:04:26] god's word
[2:04:28] may our understanding be opened amen
[2:04:32] because
[2:04:33] that's the
[2:04:35] that's what happens paragraph
[2:04:39] 207
[2:04:41] he said the sun
[2:04:43] pulls that little plant
[2:04:45] that's drinking from god's fountain
[2:04:49] see it can only drink from one thing
[2:04:53] you pour oil down that little seed one
[2:04:56] time it'll kill it that's right
[2:04:58] you pour straight water old water that
[2:05:01] ain't no good
[2:05:04] and contaminate it it'll stunt
[2:05:07] the growth
[2:05:10] you know what's wrong with the church
[2:05:11] world today
[2:05:14] there's good people in those
[2:05:15] denominations
[2:05:17] but they're not getting pure word and
[2:05:20] their growth has done it and they're
[2:05:22] starting to understand their growth
[2:05:24] stunted you know what we need in this
[2:05:26] day we need real witnesses of god's word
[2:05:29] that'll go out and tell them there's a
[2:05:32] message that's been delivered that shows
[2:05:34] us the way to quickening power
[2:05:39] can you believe people buy the gospel
[2:05:43] you send me money
[2:05:45] and god will bless you
[2:05:50] here are the people they want to go out
[2:05:52] there and make everybody rich and
[2:05:54] wealthy
[2:05:55] and but there's one scripture they never
[2:05:58] quote
[2:05:59] god came to the poor in this world rich
[2:06:01] in faith
[2:06:02] ho ho that scripture don't fit in their
[2:06:04] program
[2:06:06] because they've learned to do everything
[2:06:08] with money
[2:06:12] jesus told them go out don't take extra
[2:06:15] shoes don't take no money in your purse
[2:06:22] you don't think we need understanding
[2:06:25] we need our understanding opened
[2:06:32] because it's the understanding
[2:06:34] the s-o-n
[2:06:36] that pulls the flower
[2:06:39] it gives you understanding what's oil it
[2:06:41] gives you understanding but real good
[2:06:44] soft rain water amen no man-made
[2:06:48] chemicals in it just comes from the
[2:06:50] heavens above and watch that little
[2:06:53] plant there's no water will grow that
[2:06:56] like rain water you put chlorine and
[2:06:59] stuff in it
[2:07:00] like you tried to dose us up with
[2:07:03] and the first thing you know it kills
[2:07:05] the plant
[2:07:08] christianity is dying
[2:07:11] i don't care what you say this nation is
[2:07:15] christianity's dying
[2:07:19] they won't preach against homosexuality
[2:07:21] homosexuality
[2:07:23] is a steaming spirit
[2:07:27] and it can be cast out
[2:07:33] the soldier boy
[2:07:36] amen
[2:07:37] the demon spirit
[2:07:40] god never did brought homosexuality
[2:07:44] to control the population
[2:07:47] you can't help who you love
[2:07:51] what a lie of the devil first of all
[2:07:55] it's not love
[2:07:57] it's pure perversion
[2:08:03] and i know a lot of believers whose kids
[2:08:05] have gone
[2:08:08] but you know what
[2:08:11] god didn't do it
[2:08:14] if the devil did it
[2:08:16] god can pray him back
[2:08:18] god can heal him god can deliver him
[2:08:21] god's still god he's the same yesterday
[2:08:24] today and forever
[2:08:28] you can't pour all this stuff into the
[2:08:31] church
[2:08:32] and expect the church
[2:08:34] to walk in his image
[2:08:37] it's amazing judas portrayed him with a
[2:08:39] kiss
[2:08:42] you can't you can't
[2:08:44] start accepting this stuff and then you
[2:08:46] feel bad like you're not a christian
[2:08:49] because you're preaching against it i
[2:08:50] don't preach condemnation i don't preach
[2:08:53] hatred i preach deliverance in the name
[2:08:55] of the lord jesus christ
[2:08:58] i preach sin is sin
[2:09:02] whether i do it or anybody else do it
[2:09:05] sin is disbelieving god's word all these
[2:09:09] other acts are attributes of disbelief
[2:09:15] i'm not ashamed of that everybody's
[2:09:17] telling me oh brother mcgary don't
[2:09:19] preach
[2:09:20] on the internet because you're streaming
[2:09:22] now someone will get a hold of it all
[2:09:25] the people in lgbq zd or whatever you
[2:09:28] call yourself i want you to know jesus
[2:09:31] christ can deliver you from the demon
[2:09:34] that has you in this walk of life
[2:09:41] the kingdom of god did not come in word
[2:09:43] only
[2:09:44] but it came in power and demonstration
[2:09:47] of the holy spirit
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:09:51] and the only thing that's going to put
[2:09:54] that power and demonstration to the
[2:09:56] church is when the church is willing to
[2:10:00] have their understanding opened to what
[2:10:03] god's got for him
[2:10:06] and it's a war against the flesh
[2:10:11] and just to settle this question now
[2:10:14] about
[2:10:18] the son of god to be revealed again
[2:10:21] in the bride in the last day
[2:10:24] the quickening power has got to come
[2:10:27] quicken them out of these dead
[2:10:29] denominational creeds to a living word
[2:10:33] of a living god
[2:10:37] then i want to read this because i want
[2:10:39] us
[2:10:40] we need this quote in this church
[2:10:47] and this is on the final subject of
[2:10:49] does it matter
[2:10:52] does the way you live matter does the
[2:10:55] way you think matter
[2:10:58] does what's quickening you matter
[2:11:02] there was a lady came by
[2:11:05] now you know what kind of shoes people
[2:11:07] wore
[2:11:08] 35 years ago
[2:11:11] there was a lady come by
[2:11:13] had on a great big pair
[2:11:16] like
[2:11:17] they wear today
[2:11:18] spiked heeled shoes
[2:11:22] we call them high heels
[2:11:27] and i'll preach against weiner tight
[2:11:29] dresses
[2:11:33] if you can see the form i guess i'm just
[2:11:35] gonna preach it
[2:11:37] but if you can see the form of your
[2:11:40] backside your dress is too tight
[2:11:49] there's a lady come by now you know that
[2:11:51] kind of shoes they wore 35 years ago
[2:11:55] there was a lady come by and she had a
[2:11:57] pair of these big
[2:11:59] pair like they wear today spiked
[2:12:02] heeled shoes
[2:12:04] and she come by and i said wait a minute
[2:12:07] sister you can't walk that highway with
[2:12:11] that
[2:12:12] and i said you can't do that
[2:12:15] and she said
[2:12:16] ah she said look around at the rest of
[2:12:20] the women said
[2:12:22] don't believe him
[2:12:24] he's a madman see
[2:12:26] don't believe him i'll show you i can be
[2:12:29] justified sanctified and filled with the
[2:12:32] holy ghost
[2:12:33] and still walk that
[2:12:36] i just let her go
[2:12:39] couldn't do no more about it
[2:12:41] couldn't stop her
[2:12:43] she jumped up on the highway
[2:12:45] and she looked back at the sister and
[2:12:48] said see
[2:12:49] i told you and she started to run up
[2:12:53] you know as the bible said in isaiah the
[2:12:56] fifth chapter
[2:12:58] that they would
[2:12:59] have
[2:13:00] outstretched necks
[2:13:05] they'd have to
[2:13:06] they're
[2:13:07] they're pitched over see mincing
[2:13:11] they have to
[2:13:13] to twist mince as they go
[2:13:17] making tinkling with their heels see the
[2:13:21] daughters of zion in the last days
[2:13:26] whoever thought that was high heels
[2:13:28] whoever thought that when you got here
[2:13:30] on your heels and you lifted your back
[2:13:33] up
[2:13:35] it caused you to pitch forward
[2:13:38] and make your neck out
[2:13:42] it's a spirit
[2:13:45] i see them all the time in here
[2:13:48] if you sisters love one another
[2:13:51] when you see a sister show up
[2:13:54] go talk to her
[2:13:57] we don't wear stuff as that
[2:14:00] and i know
[2:14:01] i i've been
[2:14:04] in different countries
[2:14:06] we're wrapping up tight is
[2:14:09] natural
[2:14:10] we're high heels is what everybody wears
[2:14:14] it's just like if you come from a
[2:14:16] culture where everybody wore hats
[2:14:20] you know we don't cover our heads in the
[2:14:21] sanctuary our hairs are covering
[2:14:24] no i'm not talking about these little
[2:14:27] head things you put on you know i'm
[2:14:28] talking about these beanie hats that
[2:14:30] look out here
[2:14:33] you understand but everything is back to
[2:14:35] the understanding of god's word
[2:14:39] and so that she said i'm just going to
[2:14:41] run up this highway
[2:14:42] so she started up the highway
[2:14:45] just as hard as she could run and after
[2:14:48] a while the road got narrower
[2:14:51] and
[2:14:52] narrower
[2:14:58] let me tell you where we are church
[2:15:01] getting narrower and narrower the church
[2:15:03] ages got narrower and narrower all right
[2:15:06] it got down to where it could be
[2:15:08] if two if one in a million could make it
[2:15:13] peter described it as only eight
[2:15:15] souls
[2:15:17] saved in the day
[2:15:19] it's getting
[2:15:20] narrower so the narrower the road grows
[2:15:23] the more our understanding has to
[2:15:25] increase
[2:15:27] he said
[2:15:28] and it got
[2:15:31] narrower and narrow and she started
[2:15:33] reeling
[2:15:34] mincing like that and off she went
[2:15:39] and mother said the horriblest screams
[2:15:42] that i ever heard
[2:15:44] in my life
[2:15:45] was that woman falling into those flames
[2:15:47] and smoke
[2:15:49] going down like that said i turned
[2:15:52] around and said see
[2:15:56] she just obeyed everything but one word
[2:16:00] see
[2:16:01] everything but one word sure pentecostal
[2:16:04] women can be saved sanctified and filled
[2:16:08] with the holy ghost
[2:16:10] and then fail
[2:16:12] absolutely
[2:16:14] man shall not live by bread alone
[2:16:17] but by every word that proceedeth see
[2:16:21] and she
[2:16:22] failed it
[2:16:24] and as i said see she would have went on
[2:16:28] in all right
[2:16:30] but she failed to listen
[2:16:33] tell her what was ahead
[2:16:36] and he's wrote the gospel
[2:16:39] by the disciples apostles
[2:16:41] the doctors of the apostles and prophets
[2:16:43] and full forth and they won't
[2:16:46] listen
[2:16:51] the only way you'll ever have your
[2:16:53] understanding to increase
[2:16:55] is to listen
[2:16:58] and i hope you understand
[2:17:00] that it's by understanding
[2:17:03] that god empowers you
[2:17:05] it's by revelation it's not a hope so
[2:17:10] oh i hope i get the power i hope i get
[2:17:13] the baptism it's a promise
[2:17:17] and when you understand the promise
[2:17:21] and the promise is wait
[2:17:25] don't try to go
[2:17:27] don't just run out preaching the gospel
[2:17:30] wait
[2:17:32] until i come
[2:17:34] and i give you something that will help
[2:17:37] you
[2:17:38] that the gates of hell
[2:17:40] won't prevail against it
[2:17:43] and that's why the sheaf wave has been
[2:17:46] waived in this last day according to
[2:17:48] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations
[2:17:53] 10 7 to increase our understanding to
[2:17:56] reveal the son of perdition that we
[2:17:59] might know the truth
[2:18:01] because the truth is what sets us free
[2:18:04] and the truth will keep us going forward
[2:18:06] and god bless you this morning you
[2:18:08] stand for the building
[2:18:30] amen
[2:18:31] you enjoy the word this morning
[2:18:33] amen praise the lord amen thank you
