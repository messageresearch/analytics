Description:
Melchisedec: Kinsman Redeemer
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: May 23,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

i'm a little nervous so y'all just pray for me i can speak in front of crowds as long as it's not at church i had something happen this week and it wasn't a big thing it was a little thing but to me it was a big thing and satan has been he's been fighting me all week about it telling me that it really didn't happen it wasn't that big of a deal nobody was going to believe me you know how satan likes to fight you he fought me all night so i learned that when he fights me like that it's something i probably should do so um just want to tell you what happened a couple of months ago i have a photography studio i'm sure you all know that a couple of months ago i had a client call and they wanted to do corporate headshots for a bank for all the officers of the bank so we talked i took her information she said she would call me back i saved her number and my notes in the phone so i would remember if she called back how much i priced her and all that so a couple weeks ago she called back they set up time they came they did the head shots um when i shoot in the studio i always shoot tethered it's where you have a line going from your camera to your computer and um that's so that they can see the images as we take them and they can choose which one they like the best um when i do this the images do not save to my camera they save to my hard drive so there's no backup it's all on my hard drive so that's what i did we did the session and i went back to work at my other office a few days later i went in the studio i had to get these pictures together and i was getting ready to work on the images and i got an email from the bank's corporate office asking me when they would be getting them um and i told them i was working on them right then and i'd be emailing them to them later that evening and i sent the email and let her know that and when i went to pull up the images the folders were blank my heart sank completely sank the images were gone and this was officers of a bank and you don't just call them up and have them come back in because they're busy and all of that and it wasn't a big thing to anybody else but to me i was going to have to call them and have them come back in and i spent about two hours just searching back and forth back and forth in every place i could imagine for these images and they were not there so i was going to call them and tell them basically what had happened and i was going to have to have them come back in and when i went to pull up the number in my phone it wasn't in my phone the number was gone so i'm really feeling desperate at this point and i didn't i didn't know what had happened i just i just knew they weren't there and so i googled the bank's phone number and i called and it rang and rang i looked it was after four o'clock so they were closed and gone so i i texted the the lady who had referred them to me and asked her to please call me that i needed somebody's cell number so i could call them and she didn't reply um so this went back and forth for about two hours and i couldn't find them they were not there so at this point i just stopped and i put my head down on the table and i just prayed to god and i told him that he knew where those images were and that i didn't i told him i knew he could put him back in those folders and i just asked him if he could please take those images from where they were and put them back where i needed them to be that i would just be so grateful so i meant he's just helped me too many times for me to not know that he could help me now um when i finished praying i just sat up i took a deep breath and i just went okay one more time lord and i opened the folder and all of the images were in the folder and that's that's i kind of kind of lost it at this point and had to stop and walk around and thank god for a minute and call david and tell david what had happened and he thought i'd hurt myself or something but um i just knew that god had confirmed to me that whatever our needs are no matter how small they are or seem to be he's there to help if we just call on him i thought about what brother kyle said when he got up gave his testimony a few weeks ago and he said i've done my part lord now i'm trusting you to do yours and i just want to give him thanks and praise him for it [Applause] amen he's certainly mindful of all things that concerns us amen [Music] cleanse [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] at this time [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh and he came with grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh his hands is [Music] [Music] amen if he wasn't alive we'd sure be here in vain wouldn't we be no purpose for us to be here but we've got a great hope and if this life was our only hope then we of all people would be most miserable but to know that we have hope of eternal life is a great wonderful thing so let's approach him this morning heavenly father our hearts are thrilled that [Music] we are approaching your throne that you've sent forth grace and mercy that you've invited us to your great chamber that we could lay our petitions at your feet and make requests of you and father they you laid a blood sacrifice for all our unrighteousness lord that you look at us through the shed blood of the scripture says we have a mediator the lord jesus that makes petition on our behalf and lord we're so grateful for that this morning lord no doubt that we think that we have certain needs and certain things that we feel that we would like to come to pass but lord we have a confidence that you know what we have need of even before we ask and father that you'll supply that need we pray father that you bring to us the understanding and the revelation when we [Music] don't see the things that we desire happening but then you come along and show us you had us on your heart all the time that you did what was best for us and our eternal existence we asked this morning that you would continue to do that for us father you help us this morning in this time of fellowship with the children of god we just ask that you would bless us again in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning amen we have a a baby dedication this morning and so we're going to uh dedicate jude byerly this morning amen and uh uh jude is uh the brother of james and and a lot of people think that maybe it's the james the son of ebony but it was it was the brother of jesus and because mary went on to have other children and so he i would say he was very connected and we always know this is probably one of the most known and compelling things of james that he wrote he said beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints and don't we find ourselves in that place today that's what we're trying to do we're trying to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints and and we wanted to mature and grow into the christians so that's our prayer for him this morning so brother kyle this says corinne if you were here and you would bring the little fella in let's all sing it this morning as they come oh bring them [Music] foreign [Music] so this is dalia's little brother here this morning and uh and uh we're here to educate him he's a a bright little uh wait would you and heidi come up and pray with us also ask you it's kind of the extended family here and look at those big eyes first time for me to see him up close so give me a second hey man hey man so families are certainly meant to be together so we certainly love the lord this morning we're going to ask kyle to dedicate his son back to the lord then we'll pray together and and just a wonderful time just to find little fella here and and i don't know if the lord carries we're going to need some preachers so it'd be great amen so kyle would you just ask the lord and dedicate your son sis go ahead and lay your hand on him and pray for him also we'll just dedicate him to the lord today amen dear heavenly father lord we just come before you with thanksgiving and joy in our hearts for the gift that you've given us lord just it thrills us to have the have jude lord join our family lord just the the joy that he's already brought us lord just as his introduction in scripture is a servant of jesus christ lord may that be his testimony as well lord may everywhere that he goes lord he be led of you lord may at the appointed time lord the seed that's in his heart lord just be brought to life by your spirit guide and direct him give them your leadership lord where our hands as parents fail and where we can't do the things for him lord may you protect him and watch him just bless him abundantly lord me you light his footsteps lord may he always stay true to this word of the hour lord we love you we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen our gracious father you've heard the prayer of this father as he dedicates his son back to you and father we know that you have a plan for his life for the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord father we ask you to encamp your angels about him that you keep him father father may you give him revelation and father may he grow up a proper child and lord we just know that it's so wonderful to see you just multiply and grow a family lord god we just ask that they prosper that they be in good health father that they serve the community father that where they dwell and we ask you all these things in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you see us god bless you yeah you can shake your hand god bless you amen thank you brother pal jude let me shake your hand buddy all right wait god bless you amen amen you love the lord this morning you better take that from me before i drop it or something amen well let's just uh continue on this morning in our bible thank you musicians this morning and uh we're just going to just look a little bit more into the message who is this melchizedek and the first uh last sunday we preached on malkiesa that dak the beginning of our existence so that was the title of last week's sermon and i'll give you the title of this sermon at the end of it and you know to do that so let's stand this morning and uh and we'll we'll turn in in the gospel of saint john and we know the scriptures that brother random read are in the book of uh hebrews but we're just want to read this again uh this morning it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehendeth it not father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you amen we've at the building on what that we preached or we studied if we could this is just bible study we've just came to uh a young people's uh revival and uh and and that was the purpose we want to as as our young people come up we want to introduce them to the baptism of the holy spirit introduce them to the movement of the lord and and have them become front-line soldiers amen helping in in this great battle but i thought the other night i i was driving i was over here at the church just studying and and i was driving home and i i said in my heart i said lord i don't want just to have a young people's revival i want to have a revival that makes me a young person amen i want to have a revival that's going to change this body amen so we want to do that and and we know we wouldn't be gathered here this morning if we all hadn't heard the great eagle cry we've had people through the years uh come visit uh i gotta introduce my friend brother dan back there make sure everybody knows he's here with us god bless your dan it's lindsey's dad so anyway we're happy that he's with us this morning but i've seen people come over the years and and they'll walk into the household of the lord and they'll feel the presence of god and and they'll see the people worshiping and they they want to enter into that right away they feel that but then they might see the picture of the pillar of fire up here and then they they wonder well maybe these people are a little strange well uh hallelujah i mean we are uh we're oddballs we know that but but uh when it comes to the fact that there that god had sent us a message there's a reluctance there to receive that and of course we always would encourage them to study it out see if it's in the word of god see if it's solid and it's it's steadfast in the word of god and many times they can't over come that thought that that god could use a man in our day and they want to stop the work of god at jesus and but jesus had a work to do and so but we're here this morning because we all have this one thing in common that we've heard the scream of the eagle that we've heard his voice we've seen that it's true and so we have found that it's in god's word that he nourishes his people and and that's what we want to do we want to grow up as not every service has to be a service that would i would say would be exciting you know there's a lot of things even in school many of you have graduated this year there's classes and subjects and things you've got to go through that are just boring yeah you know what i mean i i got a lot of amens on that that that's true and you know and like when you take a degree in in in school and i didn't get a degree i uh i didn't even graduate from high school but that's okay i went to another school called hard knocks and but if you can go to school i think that's a a wonderful thing but i would find out that they would teach things that i never thought was necessary you know why do i want to know this and why do i need to know that and why do i need to know that but later on you find out that the pieces of the puzzle come together so this morning we want to approach this like a bible study this morning okay we have the message that our prophet brought us and and he was bringing things out to us because there will come a time when we will need to hold on to these foundations of the scripture no other foundation can a man lay than that which has been laid which is christ jesus and now you have to understand that we the church begin to fight the enemy right from the beginning when the lord jesus showed up on the scene he was born of a virgin as prophesied many people never believed that but yet it came to pass the angels testified in the sky to the shepherds three wise men came seeking his sign there was the slaughter of the infant's to fulfill the scriptures he fled into egypt all this great things begin to come to pass and we begin to see that that god had a great plan in his mind and so we begin to talk about this as it comes down to our day and so we we took the book of maltese deck and it when i begin i thought of this message i thought well brother branham just began to preach this message and and he had just got done preaching the great subject of marriage and divorce and and then so this message was uh maybe not so significant you know an evening message and then i i i realized that something fantastic had happened in marriage and divorce that in in the message marriage and divorce spiritually what had taken place is that any claim that the enemy had to the bride was annulled okay so now the bride steps out completely free from the old man husband and you know that's what brother branham taught in marriage and divorce i'm talking to you today like uh uh your college students i'm not a college professor but in the lord you're mature so that that's what marriage in divorce taught us it wasn't about life's circumstances of marriage and divorce and who married who and and all that it was a greater thing that went all the way back to the garden of eden and so it was decreed that the records were clean and now this bride being a marriage and divorce being preached this great message comes forth and it's really a tremendous message and so we begin to do it so we're just going to go back through real quick and and read a few statements as they place them on the board and so we saw in paragraph 31 and if you want to pull this up on your phones and and do that you can this morning turn your ringers off if it's possible and and so we we saw here he said there's much dispute about this person and this subject he says i think it behooves us to break into it and find out who this is and so i i like that it behooves us to break into it so another he's saying we're going to break into something and and so that excites me right there it's just not a message he's trying to kill time with he he says we need to break into us it it behooves us and then we saw again in the 32nd verse the description of this person and the this the person is eternal so we read in the beginning was god right so really first john where we read there those first few verses is the description of melchizedek amen okay and so he says he says he had no father he had no mother he had no time he ever began he had no time he ever ended and ever who it was is still alive tonight because the bible said here that he had neither father nor mother beginning of days ending of life so it would have to be an eternal person is that right amen and eternal person so it could only be one person that's god because he's the only one that's eternal and so now we begin to see this great unfolding here he says now the thing that i contend is that he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal now god changing himself into person that's what he was no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of days now we we know that god hath never given anybody a revelation of the trinity no because you can't even worship god for something that he's not okay so if you're going to really worship the true god you've got to worship him for what he really is and so god never gave a revelation of the trinity to anybody the trinity is a man made a man-made conception of them trying to perceive this person so command looked at it from this standpoint trying to figure it out well they took this book that was sealed the mysteries were sealed in it so they took this book without the key or or the revelation of the mystery and they try to look at this person and figure it out by reading these scriptures and so they read over here and then they read over here and they they come up with this and they they saw spirit and they saw man and they're just trying to put it all together and so they they they come up with it and they they in their thinking they said well there's got to be god the father god the son and god the holy ghost there's there's got to be there's three people that did this and but they never understood god amorphy now brother branham said it was god amorphy in other words the same person changing his mask or changing his form and so we we we we went through these things and we're just uh going we're gonna just take this so he said it was the same person all the time so if we looked at paragraph 40 we would read it like this and he says that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us e morphe brought out so he could be seen and now that same god is the holy ghost the father son holy ghost not three gods three offices three acts one god so we see that that that was what it was so it's this one person now so we go drop back down again and we'll we'll just walk through this he says it in the 42nd paragraph he said it's like a sculpture that has created a work but he doesn't want to show it yet so like if you commissioned a painting or and and you've seen it and you've seen uh where uh somebody had commissioned an artist to do a painting they paint our president and so he'll get his presidential portrait made and they cover it up and then when uh it comes time to unveil it for the public they go there and they have it on a stand and everybody gives speeches you know what i mean and then they pull the blanket off of it the cover off of it and everybody can see the painting for the first time well i'll guarantee you the subject of that painting had already seen it okay but it's unveiled to the public for the first time and so he's trying to he he's pointing something out to us he says so we're talking about delving into who is this malchester at well what brother brahm's doing he's laying it out here and he's saying to us who this melchizedek is has been covered up but i'm in this service brother branham speaking if you give me the liberty to play that part he says i'm going to pull the cover off of it today and let you see who he is i'm going to unveil this mystery to all that would desire to see it or to whomever he'll show it to and reveal it to it and so he goes to pull the cover off he says that's what the bible has been this is uh right up below a little paragraph 42 sculpture mask it over and that's what god has done in this age it's been hid all these things has been hid and is supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says that there will be re revealed in the latter times it's like the sculpture that keeps his piece of work covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is that's what what the bible has been it's been the work of god's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its seven-fold mysteries and god promised in this day the age of this lady will see a church age that he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing god amorphy what a glorious thing every time you read this book and you hear a morphe don't read it in more faith because that word keeps throwing you so put the definition of the word in there god changing form god changing mass in the pillar of fire god changing in a man called jesus god changing in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god amen so we see that it's been covered up so one of the things that we know that that we've been taught is that in the beginning we know that that this great person god if we could go over to paragraph 46 that now in the beginning god dwelt alone now so we we understand this that god dwelt alone so to this that's in our minds if you could use your imagination thinking of god dwelling alone so in other words god is all time and all space there's nothing but him so he can't be seen he can't be handled he can't be touched amen can you see this air that's in between here no he it's he's invisible he's beyond comprehension he's he he's just god out there all by himself so the the first thing that he is he he's alone and and and what he has in him he he's alone with his attributes as i spoke to mourning is his thoughts there was nothing just god alone and he had thoughts there was nothing but god alone and he had thoughts right and so as we we studied this out a little bit and if we we jumped ahead a little bit and we saw that that god was a god and that he wanted fellowship so that's what god did we we we read up there in the paragraph right before that paragraph 44 and he said god came down and became flesh and died the death in christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship so but we cut we take this we're not going to talk about that part of it but we're going to say god loves fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time was for fellowship god dwelt alone so god dwelt alone but he wasn't even god because god's an object of worship so just picture this god dwelling alone and first thing he had to do is become god so he created seraphims angels to worship him that made him an object of worship now i'm just trying to make this transition to what that i want to say or what we want to talk about so god had thoughts so in his thoughts he wanted to have fellowship so he had to he had to in his thoughts say how am i going to move and and make something that i can have fellowship with okay so he wants to have fellowship so in his plan he's going to have this fellowship so the first thing that god does is he creates the stage that his act is going to unfold so brother brown said god was emorphy like somebody in a play changing his mass so god is going to unfold himself so the play that god is writing in this great place it's called the revealing of self or the revealing of god or god creating fellowship whatever you want to title the great play the place got to have a stage so god begins to create the stage he says first of all let there be light and then he creates the heavens and he creates the earth and and what does paul come back and says he says the invisible things of god are clearly seen in the visible things around us our messenger comes up and other bible writers have said the same thing you know don't ever get yourself so narrow-minded to think that brother branham was the only person in the world that brought out any bible truth you'll miss you'll miss his ministry completely you know other men wrote about the bible being in the stars branham accepted everything that was truth you understand that he read the same bible that we read but there was things that were hid is that right so you know so like the church ages people get all upset because they go get charles larkin's book and charles larkin historically laid out the church ages well that never threw me that was history you know what i mean he looked at it and he saw the ages he saw history he laid it out and he said that's true i can use this foundation to show the church age messengers comes out this is an acceptable thought pattern of man but when you want to make everything exclusive to brother branham then you're bestowing honor upon him that and that's what he said he says a messenger needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which god bestowed upon him can we know the honor that god bestowed upon him the honor that god stole on this messenger was to open the seals and reveal the hidden mysteries this paul even says that these things were made known by god and man wished not to retain god in his knowledge and was given over to a reprobate mind god's given men opportunity to see him all down to the ages but man chose man over choosing god so it doesn't shake me that other people have uh have brought out truths and brother branham read their books and took some of the things that they said saw that they were true saw that they were a vehicle from which he could deliver his message but the thing about it is his message is only to an elect people so a lot of people have read this message and won't even ever see what we're talking about this morning okay so you don't you don't have to say you know if he reads somebody else or somebody else says something you don't have to keep saying oh that's exclusively brother branham you understand what's exclusive to brother branham is exclusive to you you're the only one that sees it you're the only one that hears it amen that's where the exclusivity lies so he creates the stage you understand now he's going to unfold this act in in the great stage that he he he's forming so the first thing that we realize that god did that he dwelt alone with his attributes and and we we saw him do this was that he formed himself towards a person i want to hold that there so if you come look here maybe we could just we we've read this to you before 46 that he dwelt alone with his attributes and and he he wanted to express himself so paragraph 55 we could go read this he says now notice his attributes then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed so that was just this great eternal unseeable untouchable unknowable god yes sir okay that's what he was we didn't even know he was god nobody knew he was god nobody could even think about him because if they could think about him they would have been god so it's just this god secondly he says all in one without being expressed and then when he expressed secondly he became then the word and and then he goes on to thirdly he says and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us look i just want to take a moment this morning to talk about why that god formed himself into a person okay why did he become a person he could have become something else but he became a person because he was going to create persons yeah i i know that might be so simple but to bear with me you know remember i have no education so i've got to explain stuff so i can think about it in other words we weren't we we were created in his image but the image that we were created in was not a fleshly image like we think god became a person in other words he had a personality he had attributes he became a person because he was going to create persons so he wanted fellowship so he became something you understand that that he could fellowship with so he knew he was going to create persons so in the in his plan he says i'm in i i'm going to create persons people that i can talk to people that i can become one with you you understand so that that's what it is so he wanted somebody he could talk to somebody could express them to somebody that could exceed receive his expressions can somebody that that that what was uh that he could unite with if i could use the word and connect with so he became a person because he was going to create persons so he made us in the image of the the person he made us persons so that's what we're made in the image of we're made in the image of the person that's my prophet of god come and said jesus had the personality of god the hardest thing for us to do this morning is to take this earthly body out of the picture because every time you start thinking you're always you always are looking at yourself through this flesh okay it's hard for us to comprehend our existence before this flesh so everything we have everything that we deal with is based on these five senses and these emotions that's what we call our person but there's another part of our person right and that's an inward man if we could say it that way we we trying to describe it it it's so important for us to create the separation between our flesh and our emotions and the part of us that's god and so we we refer to that as as the word seed the seed of god that's in us because we call it seed because it hasn't grown into any form of maturity so we can't comprehend it as christ in us the hope of glory we just keep wanting to leave it seed and i'm saying it's time that it moves from seed form to fruit form it can't remain a seed forever there's got to be something that sets us free from ourselves and the only thing that can set us free from ourselves is divine revelation now may i say this early pentecost thought that the anointing of the spirit and the restoration of gifts was the freedom from the flesh and it wasn't it was an outpouring of the blessings of god the restoration of gifts it was rain okay and that fell on the what the justin the unjust and so they rejoiced and they shouted and it moved men to live right and to live holy i wish that we could all live as a holy and dedicated life as our early pentecostal fathers of our age they fasted they prayed they sought god they hungered and they thirst they didn't know what they were hungering for they didn't know what they were thirsting for there was a call in their heart we want more of god now they thought that the outpouring of azusa street was the answer to that prayer he said but it wasn't the rain that they were praying for he says really it became an unrighteous partaking of god by men that work didn't have the right motives didn't have the right objectives took the spirit of god the move of god the gifts of god used it for merchandise and it it simply became infected with humanism and eventually showed its true color by denominating so the answer to what the true cry was was not a an anointing rain but it was a teaching reign care was an unveiling and a revealing of the truth of the word of god it was going to take the false evidences out it was going to take the the ideas that man had of the godhead of what salvation was the book of life so in other words there were so many things that had to be taught okay and another word for taught is what revealed and accepted can then put the revelation and and the acceptance of it in your heart it allows you to now separate yourself from your flesh and start to make contact with that inner man and not spend your whole life trying to govern this flesh paul said i set up my body he said i bring it under subjection that i might move higher into the higher calling leaving those things which are behind behind pressing for a higher calling so this message was not just something to bring your your mortal bodies into subjection he gave us his spirit to do that but then he wanted to quicken to you the revelation of himself or he wanted to reveal to us or uncover for us or pull the blanket off the whole plan of god so we could see where he was so he dwelt with himself alone right so what did he want he he so he was going to create a person you know and so he wanted to create this person and we won't go into uh excuse me we could go into so much about about uh the attributes and but we've we've covered that so many times so he created a person so he could become one with this person right he wanted somebody that he could that was worthy to justify i know that probably went okay so he is not going to send his son right and if i hope some of you have went back and and and read over some of the statements in here you know what he where he said before there you you ever were born he said that he sent jesus uh his son down to die for you you know what i mean so that right that in his that's what he did he's going to send his son to redeem we won't go into that that outside of that unfolding but another if he's going to send somebody to justify then this person has to be worthy to die for so you were worthy to die for because your name was written on the lamb's book of life so he gave you a credential you're not going to pay top dollar for something that's bogus has anybody ever done that well i have you know you buy a coke tray or something or a coke bottle you know what i mean and you think man this original 1909 coke bottle and you go there and you get home find out they didn't make coke till 1912. you know what i mean so you understand god's not going to die for something that's bogus okay he's only going to die for something that's his okay so we i i'm trying to bring this without just jumping up and getting too excited so i'm gonna stay calm so he you know so it had to be somebody that was worthy to die for worthy to justify in other words justify was what like you never did it in the first place you have to understand that you already had to be worthy else he wouldn't have justified you and and uh you know and i keep looking through here because there's so many places he said he said here and this is in paragraph 69 it says but you look and clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of god you can't be the word unless you're a thought now i know a lot of us are got all predestinations pushed down in the future let me say this we do not understand predestination we are breaking into predestination we we understand the benefits of predestination we understand the security of predestination but we do not fully comprehend our pre-existence because that would empower you jesus understood his pre-existence he said i came from god i go to god he says he says that proves the predestiny of god you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stam temptation we went through this you had to bypass the theophany anyway see he said see you had to be first you had to be something so you bypassed that theophany does everybody understand theophany should i stop one moment and try to explain the theophany body all right that's it it's not very complicated in fact it's a little simple and i think that why that we miss it so let's go over to uh paragraph 89. we'll just read here so you kind of get the idea of theophany if this gets long please feel free to leave without without regret you know what i mean or anything he says there was a prophet 89 there was a prophet named moses and one day called him and one day god called him and wouldn't let him go over the land and he died on the rock and the angels took him away and buried him there was another man an eagle didn't even have to die he just walked across jordan and god sent chariots down and this robe of flesh he dropped and raised and caught the everlasting prize all right we're talking about this theophany 800 years later 800 years later on mount transfiguration here stood those two man moses's body had been rotten for hundreds of years but there he was in such a form till even peter james and john recognized him amen if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of god expressed here on earth you've got a body waiting after you leave this world there they was standing on mount transfiguration in their theophany okay there they were standing there in their theophany for they were prophets to whom the word of the lord came to so he goes down he says now let's notice another prophet one time by the name of samuel he was a great man he had taught israel told them they shouldn't have a king and and have i ever said one thing to you in the name of the lord but that it hadn't come to pass that to know everything you always said in the name of the lord come to pass he was a prophet so three or four hundred years later or whatever that time frame was on the internal side it was different than on the natural side the king got i i said that part it's on the board brother ben said the king got in trouble that was before the blood of jesus christ was ever shed he was in paradise and the witch of endor called for somebody to come and console saul and when the witch saw him standing she said i see god rising up out of the earth and after the man had been dead buried and rotten in the grave kerry was standing there in that cave with his prophet robon he was still a prophet amen why did you call me out of my rest see you become an enemy of god watch him prophesy tomorrow by this time you will be with me he still was a prophet though he was gone from this body see he had become here and was part of the word and he entered from the flesh body life back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world he entered into the theophany okay which was the word you did it there's where all believers go when they turn from here well i'm off track now okay so god in his great plan right he had a body for you is that right okay so that's the body we didn't know that body remember we bypassed that body we didn't come in contact with that body we didn't know that body even existed remember he said oh i just thought we went and played on the harp nobody knew okay and and you know brother graham talks about the man remember that got hit by the car he was still there you don't die when you die okay he talked to the body and explained the body like tv waves he's trying to get he's using these things you understand he's trying to use earthly things to express something that that's eternal trying to express a dimension that doesn't have the limitations express that dimension but trying to use something for us to be able to grasp it with so he says it's like tv waves they're going through the room right now there's people here images that are right here if you if you had the receiver [Applause] you could see them now brother branham had that receiver remember he was sitting on the couch in the vision ken his wife told him don't worry he got picked up and and lifted her over the log and and all all those times so he said there's right that's why the prophet could go back and look when he prayed for that little girl and raised her from the dead he said how could he raise her up from the dead he said because he knew her name was on the lamb's book of life we can stay in this book for months and so he's trying to express it to you it's not something fleshly we just can't separate man cannot loves this flesh so much that they didn't even want to accept the fact that this isn't the body you're going to get and he all through this book he says that over again if this body be dissolved if this body be dissolved if this body be dissolved we have a theophany okay we have the body that god had in his mind in the beginning that we would live in but we didn't get that body you understand we bypass that body adam bypassed that body now i know you're going to ask the question well i thought he was male and female he was and and god had adam in his mind and in adam he had both of those attributes in one okay but god didn't create adam from his thinking to a theophany body you understand he went from god's thinking into a earthly body he bypassed that and he went into an earthly body okay because so that earthly body could be what tempted and that's what god told them as long as you don't partake of sin this earthly body will do you but god knew adam would fall and i mean these are all things we've gone over but i just hope they can start growing in us he said god created eve to fail because adam couldn't fail because he was a part of the original creation now i'm just going to close this up this morning because like i said i realize right now it's going to take a long time to preach this but as long as you want to hang in there we will grow with it you hear that we'll grow with it so it so hit that he adam bypassed that and that's what he said he said but we we we we had come first he said and so we read we read down here in paragraph 69 he said but you see in order to stem temptation you had to bypass the theophany so you bypass the body that he had prepared for you before the foundation of the world okay that body is and where does that body lie it's in the thinking of god it's in the plan of god it's there because he thought it it exists because that body exists in him right let's go back to first john in the beginning was the word the thoughts of god right the the uh the attributes of god and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god another word that is the person that the all-encompassing alone god did he formed himself into a person the word not two one the untouchable unseen unknowing invisible no way to even even know he is god covering all things a fountain of many color uh this great invisible i am the i am all of a sudden conforms himself into a person the word word person that person was god that person was with god that person was in the beginning in the beginning was the word the first works in the bible are as in the beginning god now the revelation comes farther because they've seen jesus christ in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and this game was in the beginning with god that was the word that person was god in theophany or body form not flesh form body form how many wants your same body back no i'm going to be a lot better looking over there i don't want this body bat praise god right so all right now listen he says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made you understand that that theophany was made by him that's the body so when moses showed up it wasn't in this fleshly body it died it was in the body that was made for him in the beginning before the foundation of the world so what they did is that they didn't get a fleshly body they were standing there like a projected picture into this fleshly dimension so that they could sit there and they could recognize them they could see them they had bodies but they weren't fleshly bodies they were theophany bodies you couldn't kill them again i hope that kind of gives you a little touch of of of what that uh of of what that uh of what that he was right because you couldn't kill this person he said the true revelation of matt this paragraph 95 now the true revelation of malchezadet comes into view what he was god the word before he became flesh god the word god the person melchised because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see he had father and mother he see see i had father and mother you did too jesus had father and mother but this man had no father he had no mother jesus had a time he started this man didn't jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life and in him was life and the life was the light of men this man couldn't because he was life and it's the same self same man all the time i hope god reveals it to the self same person we're going to finish now if if i can bring myself to do it so let's go now back to paragraph 55 he says now notice his attributes and then we talked about that he says he says saint john the first chapter and the first verse notice this right so we just did that okay in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word and when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting to where melchizedek is that th that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god you understand there's melchizedek they're that mysterious person the empty s all eternal space god forming himself into a person that person was his thought express the name of that person was melkisha dad he was the prince of salem we'll get into that tonight there's that great person this one person the god became the person why because he wanted to express himself the word is an expression before he expressed himself he became a person because he was going to create people people that were worthy to be justified people that could be cleansed people that could receive his word they were created to be justified they were created they were worthy in the beginning oh i'm getting to it hallelujah okay so he says that's where he was and and he said that was before he became flesh right but he became he came became flesh because we were in a fleshly condition so he had to wipe our flesh record clean and we just read that remember he came into the church so he could clean it up and dwell in it he said his first being he said now we're getting where melchizedek is this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the words was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hold that there for notice now we're talking about melchizedek before he became jesus he said you don't hear about melchizedek anymore because he became jesus but we we've got to know this person ever to really understand what it was that was done for us he said he says first spirit he says god supernatural all right the great eternal that's the god we couldn't touch or feel or anything secondly he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany called the word a body a person god created himself a person with bringing us all his attributes in one in the word in a theophany form a body form a person god became a person because he was going to create persons so he became something that he could fellowship with you he created you a person god can't fellowship with a dog he can't fellowship with a horse now we call it fellowship but you can't become one with them you can't unite with them they'll obey you they'll respect you you can train them but there wasn't something you could have a union with so god became a person because he was going to create persons that he could become one with they had to be worthy enough for him to give his life for they had to be where he could cleanse them he could fill them he could unite with them he he said we're about this is the state this is paragraph 57 then this is the state he was in when he meant abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of a theophany that's what the theophany is it's the body that the word took form in so when abraham appeared he was in that body that god had in his mind when when uh samuel was there he was in that body because this earthly body to be dissolved you have one waiting for you and so so now we go back to paragraph 64. now we're going to wrap around the corner and we're going to um close this thought up he says now god in this stage in its stage of creation later formed into flesh jesus he says from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be in the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make it itself it's just spoke out amorphy just spoke out god changing so the first what the the great all world all eternal god changes himself into a person that he takes on the theophany form in other words the body that he prepared him for himself he takes on this great form so he out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoken out changing god changing from an eternal into a person the word something that can speak talk touch don't think of the word as text can you get that out of your mind it's not text the bible is not the word it's a record of the word but without revelation the record kills but with the spirit the record gives life so we automatically say word we think what bible oh we've made this sacred so sacred that we let it cut us off from the revelation that the person hid himself in text form but man can't see it it has to be what revealed so you have to be able to see the person that was in the beginning with god they wrote all about that and then he became flesh and they wrote all about that and everybody drew their conclusions from what man wrote and they were never able to come and meet the person and they created all kinds of schools of thought called denomination and man would have never figured it out and they never will figure it out because god does not give revelation for something that he's not but he promised in the last days that this same word spirit would return in this day and reveal himself [Applause] but when he came to abraham he wasn't in a fleshly body he was in a recognizable form because god created that in the beginning to be a person because he wanted to have fellowship let's close up he says abraham when abraham met him he was melchizedek okay he says he said let's go back to the 64th verse later in the form of bless you jesus what from the great beginning spirit he came down the word a person the theophany the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out amorphy later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to test taste death for all of us sinners it's hard to go past the flesh isn't it and to understand there was a realm before that where we existed right your name was on the book he knew you then a realm that you bypassed but is still there for you i i got to close because i'm just it's starting to get blow up he says when abraham meant him he was melchizedek here he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end right every son of god son of abraham every son of faith right we're the children of abraham not the fleshly seed but the what seed the faith seed all the children of faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want you to watch how we have to come so we talked about that why we bypass this this is where i want you to catch this morning the beauty of this he he says so we see him revealed here in ruth and boaz as kinsmen redeemer how ha how he had to come in flesh now here he is revealed in kinsmen redeemer so he says here he appears to abraham he says abraham see me this is what you're going to become okay this this is what the body that i really had in mind for you so here is revealing of the kinsmen so who was melchizedek the title of this message is melchizedek kinsman redeemer he wasn't redeeming this flesh he was our nearest kin to our theophany that's where we were in him that's where our word body was that's where abraham's body was samuel's body was that's where the body was he wasn't redeeming this flesh he was the kinsmen redeemer of that body the word body from the beginning the other body we have he came to redeem us back to that body not redeem this body oh hallelujah jesus that's where the redeemer was that's where our kinsman was so the kinsmen had to be the nearest kin okay he was the nearest kin because he was the only one that was in that theophany form he was the first kin he was the first kin to abraham that's why abraham was able to go to that body jesus not yet being born that's why samuel was able to go to that body because melchizedek was the kinsmen redeemer the word is what redeemed you before the foundation of the world that person that one person that's our redeemer that's our kinsmen jesus was the lamb he took on the form of sin that person our kinsmen took on the form of sin offered himself as a sacrifice from our sin he says i have power to lay my life down and take it up again i do nothing unless the father who is in me melchizedek who is in me this person that is in my form this union who was it i don't want this body back i don't want this body redeemed you say well we take on a fleshly form again yes it'll be a glorified body that this word body can dwell in no sin no death no sickness but we keep thinking in our mind that he's here to redeem all the sin that's in this flesh and all the sorrow that's in this flesh and all the stuff in this flesh and one day i'm going to be free from all this and still have this no we're our minds are blocked by our bodies that's why he said the kingdom of god is within you that you can't comprehend the beginning or the end but he knew there would be a time amen when this would be opened up to us and we'd be able to see it yeah we'll be able to go back and begin to understand this plan of god unfolding the stage of the church ages the the acts of the apostles the act of the first age the second play act the second church age the third act the third church age all the way down to the final act where he comes down and it's it's like these theaters they have what do they call them living life theaters or something like that you go to branson and see and they show the great performance the mighty angel coming down hallelujah you know here he comes the mighty angel setting his foot on the land and sea the axe unfolding unfolding the seventh messenger angel coming up starting to reveal who the real kinsmen is the real kinsman redeemer was the word that you heard from and i know i didn't get into hearing from your theophany but maybe we'll touch on that a little bit tonight but the things begin to to come to pass now we all understand wait a minute it's never been about this body this is just the hickey in time this is just the bypass i bypassed that so if i bypassed it what does redeemer mean to bring back so the kinsman was to bring us back melchizedek was the nearest kin to the body that came from him he was the nearest king to our real body he was the nearest kin to what what was really in god's thinking and only the nearest kin could be the redeemer that's right and so melchizedek was our kinsman redeemer he showed abraham this is the body you'll have i'm going to go redeem you back to this body and how many uh i i know we sit back in and paul says if this earthly body be dissolved paul's caught up into the third heaven he said if this earthly body be dissolved oh we've got one waiting for us that's the one he came to redeem for us melchizedek was our kinsmen redeemer why was he our kinsmen because if we ever had eternal life we always had to turn off if you were in his thinking you had to be in his thinking so what is he redeeming us back to he's redeeming us back to god's original thinking amen oh it's a beautiful book it's a beautiful love story melchizedek our kinsmen redeemer he says here comes the full view of boaz and ruth our kinsmen redeemer i know it might take a while to set in but get the book we'll read some more quotes this evening as we uh fellowship on some more things that and just go through and read some more statements but i just wanted to bring that out this morning that you you see where we were how we were in the beginning how we were in our thinking we see how god made himself a person how he made a body this is the body that we could fellowship with god in how we unfold this plan so his attributes could come and now he's back redeeming the word melchizedek the person made flesh melchizedek made flesh the word melchizedek made flesh god becoming now a person deck the word becoming flesh veiling himself in a person to be our redeemer to bring us back to the word that we were in the beginning melchizedek our kinsmen redeemer so you understand all that a theophany body is is that god didn't create this body this body was born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies this body was the product of sin get over it amen you don't want to be this ugly shell of a person you are anyway it's subject to everything i want to be what he wants me and billy covered that wednesday night all about god had a plan for your existence and he he he had a plan i don't i don't need to go over all that again with you but if you could understand that this is just a just a little space of time so he can manifest his attributes of healing and and you were created so he could do that but he's not redeeming you back to this he's redeeming you back to that original theophany body the body that was prepared for you before the foundation of the world the body that moses was in the body that samuel was in the body that elijah was in the body that peter in them saw there with melchizedek when he was glorified on mount transfiguration that's what our kinsmen redeemed us back to our kinsmen was dwelling in jesus christ the great theophany person of god oh i just hope it thrilled you the way it thrills me this morning anyway it's late so go get some lunch and and grab your who is this melchizedek book or put it on your tablet and then we'll come back at five o'clock and read a few more pages in a few more chapters so our first sermon was melchizedek the beginning of our existence our second sermon and then we touched a little bit on what we bypassed and then our second sermon is melchizedek kinsmen redeemer and if we can start moving and let me say this in closing i believe with all my heart that god is trying to move our minds to the supernatural do you understand that we're too carnally bound and the carnal mind is enmity with god but the spiritual mind is life he's trying to move us to more of a spiritual understanding and more into the supernatural realm amen not just for a taste and glimpse of miracles but the understanding of the true existence and true spiritual realm of the true spiritual believer let's stand together this morning brother billy will dismiss us in prayer oh i like the sound of it melchizedek kinsman redeemer amen let us pray amen we'll let everybody that has to run to the restroom uh hurry up and do that and then as soon as it's still we'll say a prayer okay let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord i'm too frail of a human being without the vocabulary but father i'm glad that you didn't make it enticing words but father you made it revelation and i pray father i know we've got high school students and and in so many different levels of thought and spiritual growth and some people are in such battles with the flesh others are in a great battle trying to find peace and where they belong and father where they should settle in and what their purpose is and they are tossed about and [Music] and by nature we go to and fro lord because this is in our home and just the fact that we're eternal beings creates such a such a confusion for us in this dimension but lord to have it revealed to us that you've already performed the kinsmen sacrifice to bring us back to the theophany that we really were created to dwell in that gives me such comfort to know that the great high priest of our salvation as he's described the king of righteousness the king of peace the high priest melchizedek [Music] was our kinsman to bring us back to that original state he came here veiled in flesh he became jesus in the form of jesus to be our kinsman redeemer lord it's it's beyond comprehension [Music] that you would do that for us father we can't even get the understanding that we have a whole another body waiting for it oh death where's your victory oh grave where's your stain i have a crown of righteousness laid up for me i fought a good fight i ran a good race now i'm gonna go get the body that i've longed to live in the one i saw when i was caught up into the third heaven the one i saw you in lord in that great pillar of fire [Music] lord i i trust it can just open deeper to us forgive us of our weakness the lord i trust that every person in this room this morning will realize how much you love them how that you long to give them their hearts desire and if they could just turn to you this morning and whisper a prayer lord you talked about our sister this morning how you brought her pictures back father wherever they had went they had to exist somewhere [Music] and you can even go in the electronic world and bring them back father you said there'd be wars and rumors of wars and now our wars are cyber wars and and not just with tanks and guns and bombs but we war against principalities and spirits and spiritual wickedness and high places lord and the battles different electronic and cyber and all these different wars that are going on but lord we've been redeemed and we're grateful father i pray that every heart would be ever more grateful and turn to those things in jesus wonderful name we pray father hear my prayer you know my heart you know what my desire for the people is father i want it to be more than just a temporary excitement i want it to be a concrete security father that when they wake up in the morning they say this body aches but the one that's calling me doesn't and i thank you for

[Music] on [Music] history [Applause] turn his face away [Music] oh behold the man i [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is amen god bless you thank you for staying for the baptism after you open our bibles and return to the book of acts and we read in the 37th verse of the scripture it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do now peter had the keys to the kingdom remember he said and peter said unto repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation amen we're we're thrilled when our children are baptized my grand daughter kaylee being baptized it's always good to see young people that want to participate in the law there may be challenges ahead in life is we know our children grow up from teenagers and then teenagers to young adults and they begin to fight the fight of life but just this little act today god said that she had a promise and we believe that one day that promise will meet up and it'll become a reality in her life so we're happy that she's doing this today amen according to the word of god and the scriptures this that told us to go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost peter with the keys to the heaven and a divine revelation carried out that commission by baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ so according to the revelation brought to us in our age and the word of god we baptize you kaylee in the name of the lord jesus [Applause] christ now has come to eat baptized today he came to me the other day and he said brother david he said i thought about that five minutes you know the five minutes on before after the rapture on the one side and then the five minutes on the other side and he had tears running down his cheek he says i want to be on the five minutes on the other side [Applause] in in life they say that people become most successful when they have a a goal to reach in sales training when they have new people they say picture something in your mind that you want to buy if someone was selling pots and pans or vacuum cleaners whatever they said if they knew they were working towards something they were always more successful and i remember matthew started his business because he wanted to buy an airplane ticket to go to a see a friend i don't know if it was his friend's wedding or what but he had a goal and i thought now here's a man that has a goal you understand he wants to live because he wants to be on the other five minutes amen are we living for the resurrection are we living for the rapture that's really what we want to set our hearts on fire we're just not living because it's right we're living because there's a reward for them it hasn't even entered into the hearts of men the things that god has prepared for them that love them oh church what a wonderful kingdom we have coming so our brother wants to make sure he's there so we're getting he's going to be baptized and receive the seal the baptism of the holy ghost the seal unto the day of his redemption amen our gracious heavenly father our brother joseph has come to be baptized father the word of god pricked his heart and he wanted to know what should i do to make sure i make the rapture and the word of god spoke to his heart to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so father carrying out the great commission the commandment that the lord jesus gave to us father seeing peter carry out this commission actually in the flesh performing that which he was commanded to do we take our brother and we baptize him in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] god bless you thank you very much uh service tonight at five o'clock whoever feels led to come back god bless you [Music] hey man let's stand and sing that as a dismissal my troubled soul oh why is [Music] oh [Music] oh he cares for you [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] my [Music] foreign [Music] oh and when trials [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] mighty name of jesus praise the lord [Music] my days are in its faithful head [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so
