[15:48] they asking for the Lord to certainly
[15:50] touch her amen people really suffering
[15:54] amen amen but I believe these requests
[15:57] are not being read so just we know
[15:59] what's going on but it's because we
[16:01] believe that we serve a living God one
[16:03] who can come by and and answer to the
[16:06] needs of his people he's not his power
[16:09] is not lost and he's not short in what
[16:14] he can do we certainly believe with all
[16:16] our heart that we can bring this before
[16:17] him amen we want to remember our Pastor
[16:20] David and sister lesle and if you have a
[16:23] need upon your heart tonight why don't
[16:24] you just lift your hand up to him just
[16:27] within your heart and remember this
[16:29] names and as they'll pray for the needs
[16:31] just open your mouth and just speak to
[16:35] him and pray to him and just say Lord

[16:41] that are taking the offerings if you
[16:42] come brother Matthew if you could just
[16:44] come and take this Nam before the Lord
[16:48] [Music]
[17:03] there's been a lot of serious needs that
[17:05] have been made
[17:08] known but God sees those uplifted hands
[17:12] I believe there's people that have been
[17:13] praying for
[17:16] answers we need God to move on to the
[17:20] scene brother brandham said
[17:23] that God led the children of Israel into
[17:26] a
[17:27] trap so that he could show his
[17:30] power there's people here that feel
[17:32] trapped tonight and they're on the cusp
[17:35] of making
[17:36] decisions and going and doing things
[17:40] that they need a real Supernatural in
[17:43] intervention from God just to move on
[17:46] the scene whether it be
[17:47] for sickness or family members or
[17:50] marriages or decisions let's just go
[17:54] before a God
[17:55] who knows every need in here Heavenly
[17:58] Father
[17:59] [Music]

[18:03] that when we don't know what to do or
[18:05] where to go that we can come to

[18:15] blueprints before the foundation of the
[18:17] world that when we would come into
[18:18] situations and feel trapped that you
[18:21] would lead us through and it was an

[39:52] looked out after us and you drew us to
[39:54] an appointed time father you've always

[39:58] Mercy Lord you've been longsuffering to

[40:30] there's not even at our best could we do
[40:32] anything that would have eternal value
[40:35] Lord but through man you could do great
[40:37] things you could tear down those things

[40:58] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[41:01] turn with me in your Bibles we had a
[41:03] thought come upon our heart and we'll
[41:06] give the title up front I was studying
[41:10] and identity was a prevailing theme in
[41:12] my heart and so was restoration and I'd
[41:16] written down identity restoration that
[41:19] was hyphenated was two words i' two
[41:21] separate thoughts and it was today that
[41:27] actually came together as identity
[41:30] restoration and so by God's grace we're
[41:32] going to just Minister a little bit on
[41:34] identity restoration and I pray that the
[41:36] Lord would just Inspire the thought to
[41:38] you as it just inspired to me as it gave
[41:40] it to me I I was blessed in Hebrews 138
[41:43] we know the scripture very well Jesus
[41:46] Christ the same yesterday today and
[41:49] forever that's right God bless you just
[41:52] ask the Lord to bless the reading of his
[41:54] word you could be
[41:56] seated this this scripture is one that
[41:59] in our day we've come to know as the
[42:01] very
[42:02] signification of of Jesus Christ proving
[42:06] himself in our day as he did when he was
[42:09] here on Earth this scripture is is
[42:12] packed full of more than we could ever
[42:15] unpack because it's Jesus Christ the
[42:18] same yesterday today and forever it
[42:22] would be at it at that proclamation of
[42:24] the scripture there's probably uh one
[42:27] other person that knows that better than
[42:29] message Believers and that's the devil
[42:31] because he was reminded of it that he's
[42:33] defeated when that scripture was taken
[42:36] by a prophet in our day he would stand
[42:38] with such Authority that Jesus Christ
[42:41] was there present with him doing the
[42:43] same works that he did when he was here
[42:45] in his Corporal body that Jesus Christ
[42:48] was alive the same yesterday today and
[42:51] forever that his identity has not
[42:53] changed that if he did something then he
[42:56] has to do it the exact same way now if
[43:00] there was a reproach for Jesus Christ
[43:02] then there has to be a reproach for him
[43:04] him now he lifted him up out of history
[43:07] and it it was put on display Jesus
[43:10] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[43:12] forever it' be in 1950 at the Houston
[43:16] Coliseum where uh brother Bosworth would
[43:20] would come to the podium and he would
[43:22] present a challenge that Jehovah Gyra of
[43:25] the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of
[43:27] the new that there was no difference in
[43:29] Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus
[43:32] Christ the identity that who Jehovah was
[43:35] was Jesus Christ and I this was a
[43:39] challenge that was actually intended to
[43:41] give to brother brandham as being that
[43:44] there is no Divine healer uh that Divine
[43:47] Healing was not something for our day
[43:50] that it had expired that it was
[43:52] something for the apostolic age but it
[43:55] wasn't today
[43:57] that was the past
[44:00] and the wisdom of brother bosor being a
[44:04] a steward of the word in one question he
[44:06] challenged is Jehovah of the Old
[44:09] Testament Jesus Christ of the new and
[44:12] that was the challenge that was given
[44:15] and at that time that's when brother
[44:17] Brandon would go to the platform under
[44:18] an invitation and the pillar of fire
[44:21] would be made manifest at brother
[44:23] brother bram's head I believe we have a
[44:25] photograph of that just a put it up I
[44:27] know we have the photo on the wall but
[44:29] if you put it up on the screen I believe
[44:31] they'll be able to also see that online
[44:33] but this is the picture that was taken
[44:36] brother Brandon would testify that that
[44:38] pillar of light was the same one that
[44:40] came to him when he was born he was born
[44:43] of a peculiar
[44:45] birth there was a a demonstration that
[44:48] God was present in our day that's right
[44:50] the same Pillar of Fire that met Saul on
[44:53] the road was the same Pillar of Fire
[44:55] that declared itself in our our day and
[44:58] we while that photo was taken by eyes of
[45:01] Fe faith we now Proclaim that that same
[45:03] Pillar of Fire is here because where the
[45:06] word is it's anointed word Jesus Christ
[45:10] is the anointed word so if he was then
[45:14] the anointed word Pillar of Fire present
[45:16] then Jesus Christ is now the same Pillar
[45:19] of Fire present where the word is the
[45:22] anointing is there's not there's not a
[45:25] separation in True Word
[45:27] and the
[45:29] anointing letter is dead without The
[45:33] Spirit Well my Christ my Jesus Christ is
[45:36] not dead so he's
[45:39] alive the same yesterday today and
[45:42] forever and when that scripture is read
[45:44] our hearts should
[45:46] Rejoice if you could just catch that if
[45:48] that was the only thing we left here
[45:50] tonight with that Jesus Christ is the
[45:53] same yesterday today and forever it
[45:54] would be enough it was enough for
[45:57] healing campaigns it was enough for
[45:59] unbelievers to receive something from
[46:02] God because God was proving his word and
[46:05] he still proves his word to be the
[46:07] same the devil's defeated by this by
[46:10] this scripture this one scripture
[46:13] Satan's
[46:15] defeated amen so what are the seven
[46:18] Redemptive names of Jesus Christ Jehovah
[46:21] Gyra my provider he's the same Jehovah
[46:25] shama you are present with me
[46:27] Hallelujah pres now present with me he
[46:32] has not changed he's still Jehovah shama
[46:35] I don't feel him he's present with
[46:37] me where two or three are gathered
[46:40] together in his name there he is in the
[46:42] midst he is here we can we can Proclaim
[46:46] that on the authority of God's word he's
[46:49] here he's Jehovah shama Jehovah Shalom
[46:53] you are my
[46:54] peace oh my when I should be
[46:58] distressed this is the one that could
[47:00] sleep in the boat he he proclaimed we're
[47:03] going to the other side you're going to
[47:05] the other side if they could have rested
[47:07] on the word of who was in it the Prince
[47:09] of Peace was in the boat they could have
[47:12] if he was resting they should have known
[47:13] we can
[47:15] rest and he's the Prince of Peace
[47:18] there's no reason we could be dis we we
[47:21] should not be
[47:22] dismayed we could be confounded by
[47:25] things but we can't be dismayed his
[47:26] peace is with us amen Jehovah Nissi you
[47:31] are my victory this isn't something
[47:33] we've done by ourselves by The Works of
[47:35] our hands or or of man but it's his
[47:38] victory our boast is in the Lord Jehovah
[47:41] Roy you are my shepherd he's the one
[47:44] who's leading us Jehovah siku you are my
[47:48] righteousness I'm thankful for that one
[47:51] he's your righteousness it's not your
[47:53] righteousness it's not your works
[47:55] there's nothing you can do our our Merit
[47:57] even though he may wash us and make us
[47:59] righteous and separate us from the
[48:01] things of the world it's not our
[48:03] righteousness he's our righteousness I I
[48:06] Proclaim that he's my righteousness the
[48:08] reason I could stand behind this Pulpit
[48:10] is not because David McGary has any
[48:12] Merit in him it's because he's my
[48:17] righteousness Jehovah Rafa you are my
[48:20] healer who can who can testify Jehovah
[48:24] Rafa I was sick and you healed me I I I
[48:27] had a broken bone the doctor could said
[48:29] it but you're the Healer you're the only
[48:32] healer
[48:35] amen yes we see that in the beginning
[48:39] was the word and the Word was
[48:41] God and the Word was made flesh and
[48:45] dwelt amongst us so Jesus Christ the
[48:47] same yesterday today forever as the word
[48:50] is present here with us doing the same
[48:52] thing and that
[48:54] word if you catch the anoint in of the
[48:57] word even as the earth was formed
[49:00] there's one way that God works he's a
[49:02] Bruder he he the Holy Spirit brooded out
[49:05] over the word the Earth to Quicken to
[49:07] life the seeds that were already in it
[49:10] okay so Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[49:12] by the word of God that word is not
[49:15] changed it was the same word that formed
[49:17] the world and if it required the Holy
[49:20] Spirit to Quicken and anointed to bring
[49:21] it to pass we don't just set in word
[49:24] only but we need the the inspiration and
[49:27] the power of it to come and Quicken The
[49:29] Word Alive to us in our
[49:32] lives Jesus Christ was the anointed word
[49:35] there's there's just not there's no
[49:36] separating the two there there's not for
[49:39] the True Believer um we while the word
[49:44] can be carried in unrighteousness that
[49:46] is not something we're capable of that's
[49:49] right you you have to be aware that yes
[49:52] people can take a word uninspired and
[49:54] that's why it's not effectual but with
[49:56] faith fath see the word of God profited
[49:59] them nothing not being mixed with faith
[50:01] in them that Hur it but faith is a gift
[50:03] of God so you've been given Faith to
[50:06] receive the word there's something in
[50:08] you that cries amen with you can't help
[50:12] it that's a gift of God in you and
[50:17] recognize that that is something that
[50:19] he's doing in you declaring back a
[50:21] mirror of the word in you reflecting
[50:23] back saying amen that's a fellowship
[50:26] that's a commun Union we have with him
[50:29] now as much as the word is there to
[50:31] declare itself there's always something
[50:33] that rises up and tries to take the
[50:36] identity away from the word oh that's
[50:39] for another day that's you know we can
[50:41] go through there's things given to us in
[50:43] as examples and this one came to me as
[50:46] we were looking it's in Luke uh 2
[50:49] chapter verse 48 and that when they saw
[50:52] him they were amazed his mother said
[50:54] unto his son why hast thou dealt with us
[50:57] Behold thy father and I have sought thee
[51:01] Sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[51:04] it ye sought me which not that I must be
[51:09] about my father's business so right then
[51:12] there was an identity theft trying to
[51:14] take place okay the the the identity
[51:18] theft alert went off the Holy Spirit
[51:21] quickened a response the word corrected
[51:24] the eror and he said wait a second
[51:27] I'm not the identity you're saying I am
[51:31] know ye not that I must be about my
[51:33] father's business I'm not the son of
[51:39] Joseph right that was identity
[51:44] theft right I'm the son of Jehovah I'm
[51:48] the Son of God I'm Jehova made manifest
[51:52] I must be about my father's business and
[51:55] you have to recognize that the Earthly
[51:57] identity Now by all means that was his
[52:00] Earthly identity everybody who he grew
[52:03] up with I mean the parents that raised
[52:05] him that was his Earthly identity it and
[52:09] think of this he wasn't raised by his
[52:12] father in that way a natural father so I
[52:16] I believe that is the calling that we
[52:18] all have is we all have a Heavenly
[52:20] Father you could say Jesus Christ in
[52:22] some ways was deprived of a natural
[52:24] Earthly father I mean it wasn't his
[52:28] blood
[52:30] father it wasn't yet he could know his
[52:34] heavenly
[52:35] father and that all of us can know I it
[52:39] reminded me just now of Matthew uh dealt
[52:42] with somebody who hadn't met their
[52:43] father one time and uh he had received a
[52:47] phone call out of the blue and and his
[52:49] response to him you know they were kind
[52:51] of bitter they they I think they asked
[52:52] him are you my
[52:54] father and he's like no I I I don't
[52:57] believe I am and they hung up the phone
[53:00] and and uh and I believe Matthew said
[53:02] well Jesus Christ knew his father and it
[53:05] was the answer to that but what we want
[53:07] to recognize is our identity is not an
[53:10] Earthly identity is the point okay it
[53:13] doesn't matter if you know who your
[53:14] father is or not of this Earth it
[53:17] doesn't matter that your home situation
[53:19] the the the the new birth establishes
[53:24] your
[53:25] identity you're not not the product any
[53:28] longer of a fleshly union that that's
[53:31] not your identity your your identity is
[53:34] a Son of God and all things have passed
[53:38] away and all things have become new
[53:40] that's right amen amen we're thankful
[53:42] for that yes your your Earthly identity
[53:46] is not your identity that is identity
[53:51] theft thank you Lord that's someone
[53:53] trying to tell you you're defined by
[53:55] something you're not and put something
[53:57] else on you that's not you now what is
[54:00] the proof of our identity let's look at
[54:02] Luke 4 verse 17 and there was delivered
[54:06] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[54:09] and when he had opened the book he found
[54:11] the place where it was written the
[54:13] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[54:15] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[54:17] the poor he hath sent me to heal the
[54:19] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[54:21] the captives and recovering of sight to
[54:24] the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[54:26] that are bruised to preach the
[54:28] acceptable year of the Lord hallelujah
[54:31] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:33] and forever that is still being
[54:36] done that gospel that's opening blinded
[54:39] eyes is still being preached today the
[54:41] blinded eyes of our understanding of who
[54:44] we are is still being open and it was a
[54:47] word identity we want to be able to take
[54:50] the word and recognize our position in
[54:52] the word just as Christ could take the
[54:54] word and it could be an anointed word to
[54:56] him in its hour in its season this is
[54:58] your identity this word if anybody ask
[55:01] you who you are it's right here there's
[55:03] not another place that you find who you
[55:05] are besides this right here anything
[55:08] that tells you who you are besides this
[55:10] Bible's a
[55:11] lie right let every man's word be
[55:15] alive you know they'll testify to you
[55:18] you know it's the Deep fake the Deep
[55:21] fake is this the Deep fake was this
[55:24] being born in sin scenario that we were
[55:27] put in that's trying to proclaim a
[55:29] different identity and it's fake you
[55:31] know how you know it's fake it doesn't
[55:34] last it's not Eternal it's done away
[55:36] with and there's going to be no record
[55:38] of it only the name that was written in
[55:41] the Lamb's Book of
[55:42] Life we're thankful for
[55:45] that you know there's something when the
[55:48] word of God identifies you as a son it
[55:52] it positions you and it's I'm with him
[55:57] you know you it's no longer uh your
[56:00] boast you know all of a sudden what's
[56:02] important to you is that he's identified
[56:04] himself with you and that becomes very
[56:07] real to
[56:09] you and nothing can take that away Jesus
[56:12] Christ revealed himself to me Lord no
[56:16] one could stop
[56:18] it and he just you you didn't put me in
[56:21] you can't take me
[56:23] out he didn't come to you and say should
[56:26] I reveal myself to David McGary
[56:30] Jr I think he did you wrong is that okay
[56:35] no but in his Sovereign elective
[56:37] love he provided a a a channel through
[56:41] Calvary the price that Calvary paid that
[56:44] his presence could come and and and Open
[56:47] the eyes Sir of a of a blind kid to the
[56:51] reality of the love of Jesus
[56:53] Christ and now what's my identity I'm a
[56:56] Son of God I I I remember you know
[57:00] there's and that becomes a that's our
[57:03] only boast that's our only boast is
[57:06] Jesus Christ there was a footage I seen
[57:09] of one time it was George Bush when he
[57:12] was president he was in a in a foreign
[57:14] country and he was being surrounded by
[57:17] Bodyguards of the foreign uh country he
[57:19] was in and he was being ushered into a
[57:21] back room and there was one of his lead
[57:24] bodyguards his chief bodyguard is trying
[57:25] to get to him he's fighting his way to
[57:27] him and the other bodyguards cut him off
[57:30] they don't number one they're probably
[57:31] doing their job they don't know who this
[57:33] guy is but there came a point where
[57:34] George sees what's going on he sees the
[57:37] commotion and he walks back and he puts
[57:40] his hand on that bodyguard
[57:42] shoulder and says he's with
[57:44] me
[57:46] andall that settled it he went behind
[57:49] the closed door with
[57:51] George and there comes a point in your
[57:53] life where it has to become very real to
[57:56] you who's with you and that experience
[58:00] of him putting his hand in your life and
[58:02] touching it is the only way there's not
[58:06] another way you have to know Jesus
[58:08] Christ for yourself
[58:11] personally and it is it it's a lie of
[58:14] the devil that tries to substitute that
[58:17] experience with anything else I I don't
[58:20] care how it is there's not a formula
[58:22] we're not saying you jump you shout you
[58:24] speak in tongues but knowing that you
[58:26] met Jesus Christ is the
[58:28] must and and what happens when you meet
[58:31] him I don't care I don't care if you
[58:34] roll on the ground I don't care if you
[58:36] cry I don't care if you dance I don't
[58:38] care if you run but you'll do
[58:41] something I mean I blinded eyes don't
[58:44] come open and you go and no one knows
[58:47] around you that your eyes came
[58:51] open I mean really I that ain't a joke
[58:55] so if he's Jesus Jus Christ and he's
[58:58] opening blinded eyes it's our spiritual
[59:01] eyesight that becomes open and the
[59:02] effect of that passing from from
[59:05] Darkness to light is what the new birth
[59:09] is it's to know Jesus Christ for
[59:11] yourself it's not some denominational
[59:14] Pentecostal understanding of you must
[59:16] speak in tongues it's you must know him
[59:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[59:21] amen so Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[59:25] by the word of God
[59:26] and the the hearing of the word of God
[59:28] accomplishes exactly what it always has
[59:31] accomplished it will prick the heart
[59:33] okay it's in our day it was the word of
[59:37] God that came to turn the hearts of the
[59:38] children back to the faith of the
[59:39] fathers so this is an accomplishment of
[59:42] Jesus Christ the anointed word the same
[59:44] yesterday today and forever turning the
[59:47] hearts of the children back to the faith
[59:49] of the Pentecostal fathers no different
[59:52] it's the same word performing the same
[59:55] thing what was it that on the road to
[59:57] emus did not our hearts burn within in
[1:00:00] us as he spoke with us along the way so
[1:00:02] the way that God operates is the same
[1:00:05] that the way he's always operated your
[1:00:07] identity is made known by the word of
[1:00:10] God by by the effect that it has on the
[1:00:13] seed Gene of God in you that's right it
[1:00:17] it doesn't have the same effect they
[1:00:20] can't receive the
[1:00:22] word
[1:00:24] amen yeah so the word declares who we
[1:00:28] are in 1 Corinthians
[1:00:31] 13:12 it says for now we see through a
[1:00:33] glass Darkly but then face to face now I
[1:00:37] know in part but then I know even as I
[1:00:41] am known for now we are looking in a
[1:00:43] mirror that gives only a dim or a
[1:00:45] blurred reflection this is a an
[1:00:48] amplified I'm reading it but you could
[1:00:49] have it up there but when Perfection
[1:00:52] comes we shall see in reality and face
[1:00:55] to face
[1:00:56] so a perfect word has
[1:00:59] come it there was a time where reformers
[1:01:01] and people grasp at what the image of
[1:01:03] man of God must be and what his calling
[1:01:06] was for us but now there's a perfect
[1:01:08] word that comes that declares us to be
[1:01:10] the Spotless bride of Jesus Christ we're
[1:01:13] no longer grasping at something Darkly
[1:01:15] this this word was a mirror people
[1:01:17] looked at it and they said and they
[1:01:19] probed at it and they said could this be
[1:01:21] me could this be me is this for me is
[1:01:23] this for my day and we had in our day
[1:01:26] day a Vindicated word that came and said
[1:01:28] it's all ours we are now seated in
[1:01:31] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are
[1:01:34] the benefactors of a completed work at
[1:01:36] Calvary there was an identity theft that
[1:01:38] took place throughout the ages there was
[1:01:41] and this is where the restoration comes
[1:01:43] in the the identity of the church had
[1:01:45] been broken down it had been taken from
[1:01:48] the church the church didn't even know
[1:01:51] who it was there was a church nominal
[1:01:53] that was carrying the name of Christ
[1:01:55] wanting to have the identity of Christ
[1:01:57] going by his name and it wasn't Christ
[1:02:01] it was in name only and it was dead it
[1:02:05] was dead it was the brother Brandon one
[1:02:08] place refers to it as a dead corpse
[1:02:11] without the Life of Christ in it it was
[1:02:13] just in it was just a body dead body
[1:02:16] without the Life of Christ in
[1:02:20] it in 1 John 3:
[1:02:24] 9-12 who whoever is born of God do not
[1:02:28] commit sin for the seed remaineth in him
[1:02:31] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:02:34] God in this the children of God are
[1:02:36] manifest and the children of the devil
[1:02:39] whosoever doth not righteous is not of
[1:02:43] God neither is he that loveth not his
[1:02:45] brother that's an original
[1:02:47] identification of the Life of Christ
[1:02:49] right there the very Love Of Christ if
[1:02:52] it's not in you you're already defeated
[1:02:56] loveth not for this is the message that
[1:02:58] ye heard from the beginning that we
[1:03:01] should love one another not as Cain who
[1:03:05] was of the wicked one and slew his
[1:03:08] brother and whereof wherefore slew he
[1:03:12] him because his own Works were evil and
[1:03:15] his brothers
[1:03:17] righteous but what's the identity of a
[1:03:20] True
[1:03:21] Believer and anything that you want to
[1:03:24] establish they do it I think and in
[1:03:26] title research if you're going to go buy
[1:03:28] a piece of property identity is always
[1:03:30] established in going back to the
[1:03:32] beginning all right I think if you're
[1:03:34] going to do dog breeding they want to
[1:03:36] see you know how far can we go back to
[1:03:38] see the the parents if you want to know
[1:03:41] what something's identity is you go back
[1:03:44] to its origin to where it's from from
[1:03:46] the beginning and from the beginning the
[1:03:49] gospel is love one
[1:03:53] another amen
[1:03:58] I just
[1:03:59] uh see if I could find
[1:04:04] it
[1:04:06] amen this is uh I will restore in
[1:04:11] 57039 Jesus said this will all men know
[1:04:15] that you're my disciples when you have
[1:04:18] love one for the
[1:04:21] other Pentecost had that I'm speaking
[1:04:25] Pentecost meaning the first group of the
[1:04:27] Apostles and the disciples they had that
[1:04:30] Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy they
[1:04:32] sold everything that they had for the
[1:04:34] furthering of the church there they was
[1:04:37] so together till even when one heard the
[1:04:40] other died they said let us go and die
[1:04:43] with him such a
[1:04:46] feeling and and that's when Lazareth
[1:04:48] died and he was they heard he died they
[1:04:51] literally were of the compassion in the
[1:04:54] mind if he if it's time to die let's go
[1:04:57] die that's the the love that was there
[1:05:01] was not manufactured it wasn't contrived
[1:05:03] they were their hearts were knit
[1:05:05] together and that brother brandom says
[1:05:08] now Jesus spoke of this and said Paul
[1:05:11] did rather and said let Brotherly Love
[1:05:14] continue that was the first church but
[1:05:16] something taken place and there was a
[1:05:18] fellow come in by the name of the Palmer
[1:05:21] worm and when he began to eat on that
[1:05:23] vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very
[1:05:26] sap line of it because it don't make any
[1:05:30] difference how smart we are how much we
[1:05:33] think we know how much we want to be
[1:05:35] different from somebody
[1:05:37] else and as long as that brotherly
[1:05:40] feeling isn't among us we are fighting a
[1:05:43] losing battle that's right we can't win
[1:05:47] there's no way for us to
[1:05:50] win
[1:05:52] that's because by their love one for
[1:05:57] another is how we're known your identity
[1:06:01] and who we are is by the love of Christ
[1:06:04] being a shed abroad in our lives if that
[1:06:07] isn't there you've lost your identity
[1:06:10] there's been a there's been something
[1:06:13] come in and Rob you of your identity and
[1:06:16] God is a restor the the gospel is that
[1:06:20] we have identity restoration services
[1:06:23] available to us g i i had a notification
[1:06:26] from the IRS that says someone is using
[1:06:28] your identity so I had to look
[1:06:31] into is someone following taxes under
[1:06:35] and what what do they do prove to me who
[1:06:37] you are where do you live what's your
[1:06:39] name what's your social and and you can
[1:06:42] look it up if someone steals your
[1:06:43] identity there's services that that's
[1:06:45] available to you called identity
[1:06:48] restoration they're going to help you
[1:06:50] prove who you are and they're going to
[1:06:52] help you I
[1:06:53] guess have the other guy lose his fake
[1:06:56] identity who's trying to use you but the
[1:07:00] the gospel provides you the only true
[1:07:03] identification that you have there and I
[1:07:06] believe especially when I was a teenager
[1:07:08] I remember for myself wondering who I
[1:07:10] was that was a very real question I was
[1:07:12] going through changes I didn't know who
[1:07:15] I was I was in travail there was a real
[1:07:18] desire to know who am
[1:07:21] I and there's no other place you could
[1:07:23] find that outside of this present truth
[1:07:25] this
[1:07:27] gospel but the fruits of it there has to
[1:07:30] be
[1:07:35] love and there there's things
[1:07:38] that happen in our lives I think that
[1:07:41] decare that that fake identity okay you
[1:07:45] have an enemy you have an adversary it's
[1:07:47] yourself and it does things that we know
[1:07:51] are not becoming of a Son of God and
[1:07:54] it's important to recognize that's not
[1:07:57] who we are and there's a there's a
[1:08:00] program that God uses to cut away those
[1:08:03] things let's read it together in Hebrews
[1:08:06] 12:
[1:08:13] 5-13 and ye have forgotten the
[1:08:15] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:08:18] unto children my son despise not thou
[1:08:21] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[1:08:24] thou art rebuked of him him for whom the
[1:08:26] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[1:08:29] every son whom he receiveth if ye endure
[1:08:32] chastening God dealth with you as with
[1:08:36] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:08:40] CH chasteneth not but if you were
[1:08:42] without
[1:08:43] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:08:47] then are ye bastards and not Sons
[1:08:51] furthermore we have had fathers of the
[1:08:54] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:08:56] them re reverence shall we for not much
[1:09:00] more be subjection to our father of the
[1:09:02] spirit and live for there verily few
[1:09:05] days of chastening us after his own
[1:09:07] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:09:12] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[1:09:15] no chastening for the present seeth to
[1:09:18] be joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[1:09:21] afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable
[1:09:22] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:09:25] are exercised therein wherefore lift up
[1:09:29] the hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:09:32] knees and make straight paths for your
[1:09:34] feet lest that which is laying be turned
[1:09:36] out of the way but let it rather be
[1:09:41] healed I want to look at verse 13 in the
[1:09:45] Amplified I had to do this just to take
[1:09:47] in the the breath of that and cut
[1:09:50] through and make firm and plain and
[1:09:52] smooth straight paths for your feet yes
[1:09:55] make them safe and upright and happy
[1:09:58] paths that go in the right direction so
[1:10:01] that the lame and halting limbs may not
[1:10:05] be put out of joint but rather may be
[1:10:08] cured so that scripture saying hey there
[1:10:11] may be something that's not in place but
[1:10:14] there's a formula that God uses to
[1:10:18] correct it it's by the pruning it's by
[1:10:20] the chastening it's by the taking the
[1:10:22] word and cutting away those things and
[1:10:24] the word of God to a Son of God causes
[1:10:29] change a Son of God when presented with
[1:10:32] the word of God and he's found in in
[1:10:36] outside of the the proper place of of a
[1:10:39] son it corrects his
[1:10:41] path it it's that is the genos of God in
[1:10:46] you as a Son of God you're the only one
[1:10:48] who can take that correction
[1:10:53] because that's the one thing Cain
[1:10:55] couldn't do is repent he was presented
[1:10:58] with the opportunity the very beginning
[1:11:01] of the work of Salvation is
[1:11:03] repentance and it takes a revelation to
[1:11:06] repent God has to reveal to you your
[1:11:09] frame otherwise it repent is not this
[1:11:11] dry work make a list but when God
[1:11:14] reveals to you your air and your way
[1:11:16] that is the the only way to bring forth
[1:11:19] the repentance is so repentance as a as
[1:11:22] the first work of Salvation is a
[1:11:24] revelation of God
[1:11:26] but let's look at what causes this
[1:11:29] identity restoration to take place in
[1:11:31] Romans the 2 chapter verse 14 through6
[1:11:34] 16 for when the Gentiles which have not
[1:11:37] the law do by Nature the things
[1:11:39] contained in the law these having not
[1:11:41] the law are a law unto themselves which
[1:11:44] show the work of the law written in
[1:11:46] their hearts their conscience also
[1:11:48] bearing witness and their thoughts the
[1:11:50] meanwhile accusing else excusing one
[1:11:53] another in the day when God shall shall
[1:11:55] judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[1:11:57] according to my gospel this is the the
[1:12:00] Fulfillment of Joel where he said that
[1:12:02] he would pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:12:04] Flesh and that he would take out the
[1:12:06] Stony heart and give them a new heart
[1:12:08] and that now you have a gentile
[1:12:10] people I could just go ahead and ask if
[1:12:13] there's any Jews in here but there's no
[1:12:15] one here that I don't believe is trying
[1:12:18] to use the ticket of being a a lineage
[1:12:21] of a Jew to get in I'm a gentile
[1:12:25] I believe we all are Gentiles after the
[1:12:29] flesh okay but this is the gospel Romans
[1:12:32] 2 verse 29 but he is a Jew which is one
[1:12:36] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:12:39] heart and in the spirit and not of the
[1:12:41] letter whose praise is not of men but of
[1:12:44] God so what does the word do it causes a
[1:12:47] separation what is the circumcision the
[1:12:49] word is the same yesterday today and
[1:12:51] forever and it's still a discerner of
[1:12:53] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:12:54] heart where's the work of God taking
[1:12:57] place by the word in the heart if
[1:12:59] there's not a piercing of the word that
[1:13:02] that that goes all the way into the very
[1:13:05] core of who you are and
[1:13:07] says this is who you are as a Son of God
[1:13:09] and declares everything else to not be
[1:13:12] your
[1:13:13] identity so it's regardless of
[1:13:18] what the Gentile flesh identity is I'm
[1:13:22] not going to argue with that I'm going
[1:13:23] to agree I'm going to say you know what
[1:13:25] what you're right I can't prove to you
[1:13:28] my lineage as a Jew I actually have no
[1:13:30] claim but by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:33] and by Calvary I've been made a partaker
[1:13:36] of his righteousness when the Devil
[1:13:38] comes to to you with an accusation of
[1:13:40] who you are as a sinner you say that's
[1:13:43] right I'm a sinner but by the blood of
[1:13:45] Jesus Christ I've been redeemed I'm now
[1:13:48] identified with Jesus
[1:13:51] Christ you can't lay charge to God's
[1:13:54] elect
[1:13:55] you but you can condemn this flesh you
[1:13:57] know what psychology does and what man
[1:14:00] does and don't be drawn off sides a good
[1:14:02] soldier does not entangle himself with
[1:14:04] the Affairs of the world the world will
[1:14:06] agree upon the problems of sin and sin's
[1:14:09] condition they're very good at giving it
[1:14:11] names articulating it they'll they'll
[1:14:13] give you a psychological disorder
[1:14:15] they'll do all sorts of things and
[1:14:17] they're pretty astute at recognizing the
[1:14:19] symptoms of sin and we don't have to
[1:14:21] adhere to their uh way of dep in things
[1:14:25] but often it's foolishness to disagree
[1:14:28] with the with the
[1:14:31] fall but what we have is we have the
[1:14:34] formula for Redemption repent be
[1:14:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:14:39] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost that's what makes you a new
[1:14:42] creation in Christ Jesus it's no longer
[1:14:45] anything of our worthiness of this flesh
[1:14:47] of the of the symptoms of this flesh but
[1:14:49] when you've passed from Death unto life
[1:14:51] the reality of that is so much greater
[1:14:54] than any temp temporal carnal hindrance
[1:14:57] that we we have a new
[1:14:59] identity I could not make myself a Jew
[1:15:03] if I wanted to but by the blood of Jesus
[1:15:05] Christ I have an identity now of His
[1:15:08] True Image Romans 8:29 for whom he did
[1:15:11] for know he also did predestinate to be
[1:15:14] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:15:16] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:15:19] Brethren so the promise of the word is
[1:15:21] that it will conform you to his image
[1:15:24] that you're predes destinated to be the
[1:15:26] manifestation of Jesus Christ and we're
[1:15:28] living now in the fullness of that
[1:15:30] there's not a partial image being
[1:15:32] declared but we are to be the very image
[1:15:34] of Christ declared in this day The Same
[1:15:38] Spirit of Jesus Christ inside of you
[1:15:40] will do the same works that he
[1:15:42] did Luke 24:30 and it came to pass as he
[1:15:46] sat at meat and this is something that I
[1:15:50] strikes me this is the effect of the
[1:15:52] breaking of the bread of the word to us
[1:15:54] as it came to pass he sat with meat with
[1:15:56] them he took bread and he blessed it and
[1:15:58] he break it and gave it to them and then
[1:16:02] in Luke
[1:16:04] 36 so he's breaking the bread and as
[1:16:08] they thus spake Jesus himself stood in
[1:16:10] the midst but with just backing up I'm
[1:16:13] going to just labor on that just a
[1:16:15] moment I I jumped ahead bear with me but
[1:16:18] it was in that breaking of bread and how
[1:16:20] he broke the bread that their eyes were
[1:16:22] opened and they knew okay and and that
[1:16:25] is the same way that God's worked in
[1:16:26] this day it was by a a prophet's message
[1:16:30] we we spoke at the beginning that he
[1:16:32] would come and you would start to to
[1:16:34] through the church ages start to say
[1:16:36] what the false Vine was and what the
[1:16:38] true vine was and it was so we could
[1:16:41] recognize our day who we are in our
[1:16:43] position there there was things that had
[1:16:46] uh claims and false claims that had been
[1:16:49] made upon the name of Jesus Christ then
[1:16:52] those things had to be stricken off and
[1:16:54] it's only by the breaking of that bread
[1:16:57] and that word that your eyes become
[1:16:59] opened and you know him there there was
[1:17:02] a there's a present truth that you have
[1:17:04] to receive that opens your eyes so you
[1:17:07] can recognize your day in its message
[1:17:09] there is an end time way of Salvation
[1:17:12] and and it's very important to
[1:17:15] understand that there's not another
[1:17:19] program because if you think there's
[1:17:20] another way of Salvation then you're not
[1:17:22] convinced and concerned
[1:17:25] you think that there's other ways in
[1:17:27] there's a white Throne judgment and no
[1:17:29] one wants to be there that's right that
[1:17:33] that's when that you know we that's
[1:17:35] something yet to be
[1:17:37] revealed we there's no pre- knowledge of
[1:17:40] how that
[1:17:41] transpires you're you're you're at that
[1:17:45] time allowed to enter in and there's no
[1:17:52] guarantee the Judgment that could be be
[1:17:56] pronounced even you know our hope and
[1:17:58] what my desire is is in that day as we
[1:18:01] stand as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:03] there's those that we say this one has
[1:18:04] done good to
[1:18:06] me when I was in need they said a kind
[1:18:10] word they did this I believe in myself
[1:18:13] this is just Dave McGary Jr speaking not
[1:18:16] having a a full understanding but I
[1:18:18] believe is as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:20] we're representing his attributes and
[1:18:23] just as he and his ction and his
[1:18:25] Sovereign Grace has called you and and
[1:18:28] manifested salvation to you that's a
[1:18:30] time when the bride stands in that
[1:18:32] position of authority and imparts of
[1:18:34] Grace and a Salvation to those that
[1:18:36] didn't deserve
[1:18:38] it and we get to reflect the very
[1:18:40] attributes of Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ and that's to be revealed we
[1:18:45] don't know that hour but I wouldn't want
[1:18:47] anybody to think that's a way to go the
[1:18:50] the only way of Salvation is in this
[1:18:52] day's God's provided place and that's
[1:18:54] Jesus Christ and we haven't received
[1:18:57] another gospel we've received Jesus
[1:19:01] Christ that's right over in Luke 24:
[1:19:07] 36 and this is I think is another level
[1:19:10] of Grace and as they thus spake Jesus
[1:19:13] himself stood in the midst of them and
[1:19:15] said unto them peace be unto you but
[1:19:18] they that were but they were
[1:19:20] terrified and AF fright and supposed
[1:19:22] that they had seen a spirit and he said
[1:19:24] unto them why are you troubled and why
[1:19:27] do thoughts arise in your
[1:19:30] hearts the word was still Discerning the
[1:19:34] very thoughts and Tents of the heart
[1:19:36] behold my hands and my feet that it is I
[1:19:39] myself handle me and see for a spirit
[1:19:42] hath not Flesh and Bones but as ye see
[1:19:45] me have
[1:19:47] and God's
[1:19:50] intent is to reveal himself in flesh
[1:19:55] that's right your flesh that people can
[1:19:58] see and know and inquire what is the
[1:20:01] Hope Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:20:04] today and forever and you have that
[1:20:08] calling to say look and see isn't this
[1:20:12] not what the scripture said would would
[1:20:14] take place and Faith declares
[1:20:19] that you know when their eyes became
[1:20:21] opened they knew them and I believe it
[1:20:24] has effect it reminded me of John Ryan
[1:20:27] and how he proclaimed I'm Healed I'm
[1:20:29] Healed I'm
[1:20:31] Healed
[1:20:33] but the faith that we have is the Royal
[1:20:36] Seed of Abraham this is in the end time
[1:20:38] signed seed that's the faith that's the
[1:20:41] Royal Seed of Abraham that's the kind of
[1:20:43] seed that takes God's word that's the
[1:20:45] thing that'll bring the that'll bring
[1:20:48] the bride that is the thing that'll meet
[1:20:51] Christ he is the word and if the church
[1:20:53] is swed with something else besides the
[1:20:56] word it can't go to meet him he hasn't
[1:20:59] got a freak body with a fungus on it
[1:21:02] he's got a perfect body and he is the
[1:21:05] perfect word and the church will be
[1:21:07] sewed and believed in the perfect word
[1:21:11] the perfect word and the perfect word
[1:21:13] will unite together as one flesh and be
[1:21:16] one body as the husband and the wife is
[1:21:19] amen I'm not amening myself but amen
[1:21:22] means so be it I believe it amen
[1:21:29] you know
[1:21:31] that's the type in an identity to me
[1:21:35] that becomes real is the identity that a
[1:21:39] wife has with her husband and that's the
[1:21:42] identity of a that reflects who the
[1:21:44] husband is is in the in the bride and
[1:21:48] young men that you you have to recognize
[1:21:51] that those things when you go to seek a
[1:21:54] life it's declaring you who you
[1:21:57] are and that's what Christ has done is
[1:22:01] he's made a way the moon reflects the
[1:22:04] sun in his absence as his Heavenly bride
[1:22:09] you are his
[1:22:11] reputation what you're adorning yourself
[1:22:14] with the way you conduct yourself you're
[1:22:18] reflecting who your husband is and now
[1:22:21] we've been made a partaker of his grace
[1:22:23] it's it's it's not that we're anything
[1:22:25] without him we're only anything by him
[1:22:28] so this isn't like our boast is that
[1:22:31] we're walking around with a hotty
[1:22:33] attitude that I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ but we recognize
[1:22:38] that as he was so I am we've been made a
[1:22:42] partaker of his righteousness and the
[1:22:45] the same way he was on this Earth we've
[1:22:47] been made a partaker of it maybe in
[1:22:50] suffering maybe in a lot of things but
[1:22:52] the the thing I'm thankful for of his
[1:22:55] righteousness I don't have to accept
[1:22:58] anything less than his righteousness
[1:23:00] being born out in my life and if there's
[1:23:03] something being reflected I know that
[1:23:05] the love of Christ in me the love I have
[1:23:07] for him is enough to put that under my
[1:23:10] foot and to win the victory there's
[1:23:12] victory in the love of Jesus Christ
[1:23:14] there's victory in that relationship
[1:23:17] that that is still where the victory is
[1:23:19] is in the Divine love of Jesus Christ
[1:23:22] and when you recognize that while you
[1:23:24] were yet a sinner he loved you and he
[1:23:26] died for you and he was willing to
[1:23:28] identify himself with
[1:23:31] you when you're in the mud you take a
[1:23:34] look at the woman at the well they even
[1:23:36] marveled that he would be talking to
[1:23:38] that woman of ill repute now imagine as
[1:23:41] the word comes and discerns her heart
[1:23:42] and her life and it's speaking to her
[1:23:45] this could have been written a different
[1:23:46] way and it could have been and he told
[1:23:48] her the one you're with now is not your
[1:23:50] husband straight away she ran away and
[1:23:52] said how dare you tell me
[1:23:55] that I'm not living
[1:23:56] right
[1:23:58] no there's some that have that response
[1:24:00] to the word it tells them to clean up it
[1:24:04] tells them not to put on earrings yet
[1:24:07] they'll wear their earrings it tells
[1:24:08] them not to cut their hair but they'll
[1:24:10] cut their hair I don't wear shorts I
[1:24:13] honestly think they're stupid I got the
[1:24:14] worst sunburn in my life in
[1:24:17] shorts I I'll never wear them again I
[1:24:19] found I could swim just as good in a
[1:24:21] pair of pants that's right but the
[1:24:24] gospel told me that that's a woman's
[1:24:27] undergarment and that's for a if
[1:24:30] you go look for it just go look up BSS
[1:24:33] the big sister Society you'll find a
[1:24:35] quote for it that's right and there's
[1:24:39] probably some brothers running around in
[1:24:40] shorts who think they've got a right to
[1:24:42] to tell a sister that her shirt's too
[1:24:45] short and you're wearing her
[1:24:48] panties sorry that's a little hard but
[1:24:52] the point is when the words corrective
[1:24:54] and it's hard as a Son of God it causes
[1:24:58] a correction doesn't cause an attitude
[1:25:01] and and we're we're not reformers but by
[1:25:04] the nature of Christ you know how the
[1:25:07] word
[1:25:08] responds right so when the word comes
[1:25:10] and it challenges you the right response
[1:25:13] is Lord forgive me as iron sharpen at
[1:25:16] iron maybe I could do better now in the
[1:25:18] word of God we're not sitting under
[1:25:20] Lords who trying to represent their
[1:25:22] influence on our lives and we're not
[1:25:24] under a ministry that's putting on Upon
[1:25:26] Us Grievous things and the Commandments
[1:25:28] of men that are too Grievous to Bear but
[1:25:30] this is the law of the Gentile where
[1:25:32] there's something written upon the heart
[1:25:34] and it's being put on display a
[1:25:36] testimony that Jesus Christ is alive of
[1:25:38] well of my life that's right and that is
[1:25:41] an intimate personal relationship with
[1:25:43] you and Christ and and rejoice that when
[1:25:47] the word comes and it corrects you it's
[1:25:49] able to make an effectual change because
[1:25:51] in in the life of an unbeliever they
[1:25:54] don't don't
[1:25:55] repent and
[1:25:58] so by the word things are
[1:26:02] discerned and we should pray for one
[1:26:04] another for people to have a true
[1:26:06] Revelation but this gospel has a
[1:26:08] mark and it's a mark of righteousness
[1:26:11] not of a not of an adhering to works
[1:26:14] because I don't care how much you think
[1:26:15] you're subscribing to the letter of the
[1:26:17] law it has to be by the spirit of it and
[1:26:20] then it's really put on display and the
[1:26:22] gospels to have that born out
[1:26:25] let's just have the musicians come look
[1:26:28] for a time to stop what I hope we
[1:26:31] understand is that our identity is in
[1:26:34] Christ that we don't have another place
[1:26:36] for us to to be restored we don't have
[1:26:38] another place that we want to seek after
[1:26:40] to find Comfort but the only place that
[1:26:43] we have is in Jesus Christ we're
[1:26:45] positionally placed in
[1:26:51] him let's just go ahead and stand
[1:26:53] together
[1:27:07] I want the only identity that I'm
[1:27:08] declaring to be Jesus Christ the same
[1:27:10] yesterday today and
[1:27:12] forever I want to give him my whole
[1:27:14] heart all my being all my mind I don't
[1:27:16] want none of
[1:27:18] me if I if I want him to be able to
[1:27:21] declare himself alive
[1:27:25] he's the only hope this world's
[1:27:27] got there's places that I can go that
[1:27:30] maybe none of you
[1:27:32] will people come across my path and I
[1:27:35] may be the only chance they have to see
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ
[1:27:39] okay and if I allow this David
[1:27:42] McGary to
[1:27:45] live can't offer him any hope but if
[1:27:48] he's
[1:27:49] dead and Jesus Christ is alive in me
[1:27:55] then he could prove himself the same
[1:27:56] yesterday today and
[1:27:58] forever and I know you can go with me
[1:28:01] and before our father and ask him to do
[1:28:04] only what he can do to identify himself
[1:28:08] with us the
[1:28:10] same that his love for us hasn't
[1:28:13] changed same love that drove him to
[1:28:16] Calvary is the same love that's here
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:20] tonight that he can still open blinded
[1:28:23] eyes
[1:28:24] we still break the bread of
[1:28:28] life and that he's present with
[1:28:32] us let's just pray Heavenly
[1:28:36] Father we know you're here because your
[1:28:38] word declared you to
[1:28:40] be Lord and in
[1:28:43] faith we say that's the truth regardless
[1:28:46] of whether we feel you or not you're
[1:28:49] here Lord and where you are you're the
[1:28:53] light
[1:28:54] Darkness has to flee where you are
[1:28:57] blinded eyes are open and where you are
[1:28:59] good things
[1:29:01] happen father we believe you're here
[1:29:03] because we have a present
[1:29:05] truth you sent by a
[1:29:07] prophet Lord and that's what we've
[1:29:09] gathered around is that body
[1:29:12] word Jesus
[1:29:14] Christ Lord I ask you'd meet each
[1:29:16] person's desire according to your
[1:29:19] word Lord that they would give you their
[1:29:22] whole heart their whole mind all that
[1:29:24] they are be nothing held back lord in
[1:29:28] possessing all things it's because our
[1:29:30] identity is in Jesus
[1:29:33] Christ you're the only reason we can
[1:29:35] possess the gates of our
[1:29:36] enemy Lord so may you be so real to us
[1:29:39] now we
[1:29:40] pray in Jesus
[1:29:43] name things that are to be brother
[1:29:46] Brandon would say now then if it was
[1:29:50] Jesus was the fullness of God manifested
[1:29:54] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:29:56] bodily therefore when he came to the
[1:29:59] Earth and was manifested in flesh you
[1:30:03] were here in him then because he was the
[1:30:07] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:30:10] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:30:13] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:30:15] amongst us the word was made flesh
[1:30:18] therefore you walked with him you were
[1:30:22] in him when he was on the Earth birth
[1:30:24] you suffered with him you died with him
[1:30:28] you was buried with him and now you're
[1:30:31] risen with him and manifested attributes
[1:30:34] of God setting in Heavenly places
[1:30:37] already raised resurrected to New Life
[1:30:40] and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:30:42] Jesus oh that means so much nowadays
[1:30:46] that means so much to us to see yourself
[1:30:49] positionally placed in Jesus Christ now
[1:30:53] if we are those attributes of God we
[1:30:57] cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by
[1:31:01] denominationalism we cannot live by the
[1:31:06] world we must live by the word because
[1:31:10] the Bride is a part of the bridegroom
[1:31:13] like any wife is a part of her husband
[1:31:16] therefore we must be the word bride and
[1:31:20] what is that word word bride the
[1:31:25] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:31:28] a Creed or denomination but a living
[1:31:31] article of God a living attribute of God
[1:31:34] displayed to the world the attributes of
[1:31:37] God in the formation of the Bride that's
[1:31:41] to be expressed in this hour that we're
[1:31:44] now living amen let's sing this together

[1:36:36] living
[1:36:41] because
[1:36:43] hallelujah what a wonderful word amen
[1:36:46] every day you work up the word of God
[1:36:49] tells you something different it tells
[1:36:51] you your mind belong to me you're not
[1:36:55] what your job calls you you're not what
[1:36:58] people call you you are mine you belong
[1:37:00] to me amen I like that brother renham
[1:37:03] says the only book that tells you where
[1:37:05] you come from who you are and where
[1:37:08] you're going everything else tries to
[1:37:11] figure it out and you know they try to
[1:37:12] paint it in a different picture and you
[1:37:15] know they'll tell you they'll make you
[1:37:17] understand why you're depressed and why
[1:37:18] you're supposed to be depressed but this
[1:37:21] takes the depression away
[1:37:25] you know everything else will try to
[1:37:27] make sense of whatever you're going
[1:37:29] through no this tells you like it is you
[1:37:32] are a sinner it saves you from sin into
[1:37:35] righteousness of God oh my I like that
[1:37:38] quote in the formation of the Bride in
[1:37:41] the end time the Lord Jesus himself
[1:37:44] making himself known you know it's
[1:37:46] amazing because you go through I don't
[1:37:49] know who I was talking to we have so
[1:37:52] much education about this religious
[1:37:55] world and and we get so full of the way
[1:37:58] things are supposed to be and then you
[1:38:01] hear the message it just breaks all of
[1:38:04] those principle away everything you've
[1:38:06] been told is a
[1:38:08] lie I was born a sinner I'm trying to
[1:38:12] please God the more good I do then I'll
[1:38:15] get to heaven I'm forgiven for my sin
[1:38:18] then I need to make sure I don't sin no
[1:38:20] more
[1:38:23] those that the father have given me will
[1:38:28] come didn't die for the sin of the whole
[1:38:30] world only those that the father had
[1:38:33] given me and he says the the World Hears
[1:38:37] when they speak but they don't hear when
[1:38:39] I speak because they're not mine but you
[1:38:43] when the word speaks something within
[1:38:45] your heart receives the
[1:38:48] word the children of disobedient they
[1:38:51] cannot receive it because there's
[1:38:52] nothing to do with them but the children
[1:38:55] of obedience when they hear it something
[1:38:58] within the heart basically said father I
[1:39:00] want to obey that word I want to leave
[1:39:02] that word I I want to everything that
[1:39:05] that word says I want to
[1:39:07] be your very
[1:39:10] identification you have not chosen me
[1:39:12] but I have chosen you you didn't make
[1:39:16] yourself Christian I made you a
[1:39:18] Christian you didn't choose what family
[1:39:20] you were born in and how you were going
[1:39:22] to come in all of Dad if you didn't
[1:39:25] choose that how are you going to choose
[1:39:28] God you didn't choose the natural you
[1:39:30] didn't choose the spiritual he makes all
[1:39:33] of that happen that's right and all we
[1:39:36] are as the children is we love the
[1:39:38] father's word as Jesus said don't you
[1:39:42] know I must be about my father's
[1:39:44] business what is the father's business
[1:39:46] the word of God whatever he says is what
[1:39:49] we believe Amen to walk by it amen
[1:39:52] that's the desires of our heart
[1:39:55] that regardless of what we're going
[1:39:58] through what situation we find ourselves
[1:40:00] in when we hear it let's just the
[1:40:03] heartbeat of God begin to beat in you
[1:40:05] let it overcome all that's around you
[1:40:09] let and that you may Surrender Your Life
[1:40:11] to that word and become one with that
[1:40:14] word that's what we desire above all
[1:40:16] things not that we can have some
[1:40:18] position somewhere or be known someplace
[1:40:21] no but we may be exactly what the
[1:40:24] identification is at the end time the
[1:40:27] word of God manifested for the age that
[1:40:30] we are living in Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:32] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:40:35] hasn't changed is the same yesterday
[1:40:37] today and forever let's just bow our
[1:40:39] heads our gracious father we're so
[1:40:42] thankful Lord
[1:40:46] and Lord your word is true
[1:40:50] Lord your word is our righteousness
[1:40:53] father
[1:40:55] father father when it speaks there's so
[1:40:58] so much peace that it brings in our
[1:41:00] hearts
[1:41:02] and father it doesn't matter what's
[1:41:04] going on and every time we hear that
[1:41:06] word it just brings the calmness and the
[1:41:10] peace in our heart and to know that
[1:41:12] everything will be
[1:41:15] okay Lord because we believe as our
[1:41:18] brother spoke that your word has the
[1:41:20] power of transformation Lord and
[1:41:25] father we know that when you spoke it
[1:41:27] within it was the very power that
[1:41:29] created the world in
[1:41:33] existence Lord that when we hear it even
[1:41:36] tonight Lord it that same power is in
[1:41:39] existence to bring us in line with the
[1:41:43] very very things that you have spoken
[1:41:45] about us
[1:41:46] Lord no doubt when we look into the
[1:41:49] mirror Lord we see the shortcomings and
[1:41:52] inability it is
[1:41:54] Lord but father your Prophet came in
[1:41:57] this evening time and he said that we
[1:42:00] were tricked into that
[1:42:02] marriage but father even before we were
[1:42:05] shown down here before we came down here
[1:42:07] Lord and your Prophet said that you put
[1:42:10] the wedding ring of predestination on us
[1:42:14] that we would come already married Lord
[1:42:16] that the second wedding was not if the
[1:42:19] second marriage was not even to be
[1:42:21] counted it was a lie of the
[1:42:24] devil and the word of God in this end
[1:42:27] time came to break that cloud of lies

[1:42:32] caused and to make us realize who we
