[15:47] turn around and shake the hand of
[15:49] somebody and tell them god bless you
[15:51] welcome to the house of the lord amen
[16:09] good morning
[16:11] a little bit of a uh
[16:13] thin crowd this morning it must be
[16:15] summer
[16:16] vacation
[16:18] i know that we've got some meetings
[16:19] going on in amarillo i know we got of
[16:22] course we want to remember the mcgeary's
[16:23] as they are
[16:25] enjoying a significant event in their uh
[16:27] mother their grandmother's life so
[16:30] just pray that the lord will be with
[16:31] each and give them safety on their way
[16:33] home and on their journeys we want to
[16:35] turn to psalm 119 this morning we're
[16:36] going to go ahead and pick up
[16:38] starting in verse 105 and
[16:41] you know as i was reading that
[16:42] there was a statement that david made
[16:44] which
[16:45] sort of caught my attention at least
[16:48] it's in verse 11.
[16:50] it says this
[16:51] thy testimonies
[16:54] have i taken as in heritage
[16:57] forever
[16:59] for they are the rejoicing of my heart
[17:03] thy testimonies
[17:05] thy word
[17:08] have i taken as in heritage
[17:11] forever
[17:14] i thought that was an interesting choice
[17:15] of words
[17:17] that david used
[17:19] you know and it struck me the approach
[17:21] that he took a heritage
[17:24] inheritance
[17:26] is something that's typically given
[17:30] handed down
[17:32] and yet
[17:34] david says that he's taken
[17:37] taken
[17:39] the word his testimonies as
[17:42] and heritage
[17:44] you know webster defines heritage as a
[17:47] property that descends from an heir
[17:51] something transmitted
[17:54] by or acquired from a predecessor
[17:59] something possessed as a result of one's
[18:02] natural situation
[18:04] or birth
[18:07] it's an inheritance
[18:09] something passed down something given
[18:11] the person that's receiving it
[18:14] you know
[18:15] typically has to do nothing to receive
[18:18] it
[18:19] it's just because of who they are
[18:22] they receive it
[18:26] and
[18:26] yet david says i have taken it
[18:31] as
[18:32] an heritage
[18:35] there were two things that caught my
[18:36] attention with that first of all
[18:40] he's describing his inheritance his
[18:42] heritage
[18:44] as the word
[18:46] and second
[18:49] he's taking it
[18:51] that way
[18:53] taking the word as his inheritance
[18:59] you know when the
[19:00] lord told the children of israel
[19:03] back in exodus
[19:05] 6 8
[19:06] about this land that he was giving them
[19:08] as an heritage as a possession
[19:12] he said i will bring you in unto the
[19:14] land concerning that which i swear to
[19:16] give it and i will give it you for
[19:19] inheritage
[19:22] i am the lord that land wasn't heritage
[19:25] it was it was an inheritance
[19:28] a defined position
[19:30] a very specific possession
[19:34] but they still had to take it
[19:38] as
[19:39] an inheritance
[19:42] the entire book of joshua
[19:45] describes them taking
[19:47] their inheritance
[19:51] something that belonged to them all the
[19:52] way since genesis 12 7 when the lord had
[19:55] promised it to abraham
[19:58] but it wasn't until
[20:00] they looked at that as their inheritance
[20:04] as their possession
[20:07] that they were able to take it
[20:09] even though it was always theirs
[20:12] even though the word was always true
[20:14] it wasn't until they actually began to
[20:17] receive it to take it
[20:19] as something that belonged to them
[20:23] were they able to
[20:25] receive it
[20:29] you know david said in
[20:32] verse 11 here thy testimonies thy word
[20:36] have i taken
[20:38] as in heritage
[20:41] you know it's one thing to believe the
[20:43] word is true
[20:45] but it's quite another to say it's mine
[20:49] it's my possession
[20:50] it's my inheritance i have a right to it
[20:55] isaiah 54 17 is a familiar scripture to
[20:58] all of us it says that no weapon that is
[21:00] formed against thee
[21:03] shall prosper in every tongue that shall
[21:05] rise against the unjudgment thou shalt
[21:08] condemn
[21:09] we all believe that that's a wonderful
[21:11] verse
[21:12] but very rarely do you hear someone
[21:14] finish the verse
[21:18] it says that
[21:19] this is the heritage
[21:22] of the servants
[21:24] of the lord
[21:26] that's the important part not only is it
[21:28] a promise
[21:30] but it's your possession
[21:33] see the thing is is there's a difference
[21:35] between taking something that's just
[21:37] offered
[21:38] a gift
[21:40] and something that is yours to begin
[21:42] with
[21:43] there's an empowerment there's a
[21:45] boldness there's no there's no
[21:48] you know reluctance to take it at all oh
[21:51] that's mine
[21:53] as opposed to is that for me really
[21:56] right there's a difference
[21:58] somebody gives you a gift it's like you
[22:00] shouldn't have for me real i'm not
[22:02] worthy of that
[22:04] but if it's yours to begin with oh there
[22:06] it is
[22:07] you see the difference
[22:09] take it as and heritage
[22:12] you know that's why it is you know the
[22:14] thing is when it's your thing
[22:17] your possession
[22:18] no matter what evidence is presented no
[22:21] matter what argument is put before you
[22:24] no matter what the voices say
[22:26] you cannot be removed from the fact but
[22:29] that's mine
[22:30] no more than they can with your house
[22:33] that's my house doesn't matter what the
[22:35] evidence says doesn't matter what the
[22:37] voices say that's mine
[22:39] see that's why it is whenever
[22:42] the devil comes against someone the
[22:44] first thing he tries to do is tell you
[22:45] well the word is true but that's not for
[22:48] you
[22:49] separate you from your inheritance
[22:51] because the moment you realize that
[22:53] that's yours
[22:55] no voice can shake you from the fact but
[22:57] that's mine amen
[23:00] taking
[23:01] thy testimonies
[23:03] as in heritage
[23:04] look at the approach
[23:06] that david took
[23:08] it struck me as you know even the news
[23:10] you've got this
[23:12] you've got this stunning development
[23:14] going on in in the ukraine where you
[23:16] have this tiny nation
[23:18] that's able to withstand one of the
[23:20] largest militaries in the world
[23:22] why
[23:24] because they know their possession
[23:27] they're giving everything for it
[23:29] and they're able to overcome an enemy
[23:32] that would seek to dispossess them from
[23:34] what they know is theirs
[23:37] taking the word
[23:39] as an heritage
[23:41] you know the thing is is there's nothing
[23:42] you can do to deserve it
[23:45] there's nothing you can do to you know
[23:47] become qualified for it it's already
[23:49] yours
[23:50] but do you take it as in heritage
[23:54] or are you
[23:55] naming something else as your
[23:56] inheritance
[23:58] you know my inheritance is this worldly
[24:00] thing or this
[24:02] whatever the case may be it's the word
[24:05] but you got to take it as such
[24:07] you've got to receive it as such
[24:09] that's mine
[24:11] oh there it is
[24:12] right
[24:14] you know
[24:15] the scriptures are full of examples of
[24:17] the inheritance that we have
[24:19] ephesians 1 is a great place to start
[24:22] it says in verse 11 in whom christ the
[24:25] word
[24:26] we have obtained an inheritance being
[24:28] predestinated
[24:30] according to the purpose of him who
[24:32] worketh all things after the council of
[24:34] his own will that whole chapter that
[24:36] whole book is about the inheritance
[24:38] that's already yours
[24:40] you know even brother branham compared
[24:42] the book of ephesians to the book of
[24:43] joshua which was the book where someone
[24:46] took the inheritance that was already
[24:48] theirs
[24:49] first peter 1 3 and 4 talks about how he
[24:53] has begotten us again to an inheritance
[24:55] incorruptible
[24:57] and undefiled and that fadeth not away
[25:01] reserved in heaven for you what what
[25:03] does not pass away what does not fade
[25:05] away the word
[25:06] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[25:09] word
[25:10] shall not pass away
[25:14] you know you can't make yourself worthy
[25:15] of it
[25:17] it's already your possession no more
[25:18] than you can make yourself worthy of the
[25:20] home that you have or the car that you
[25:22] have or
[25:23] whatever's in your pocket
[25:25] and it just was i was struck by the
[25:27] approach that david took
[25:29] to thy testimonies the word i have taken
[25:33] thy testimonies as in heritage oh it's
[25:36] mine there it is
[25:38] and i would encourage you this morning
[25:40] is you know we read this and you know
[25:42] certainly as we hear the word this
[25:43] morning to approach it from the
[25:45] perspective if i'm learning about the
[25:46] inheritance that's already mine
[25:49] tell me more it's mine
[25:51] you know use it
[25:52] don't let anybody tell you otherwise no
[25:54] matter what the evidence says
[25:56] take the word as your inheritance
[25:59] let's read that portion this morning
[26:01] we'll just read those few verses
[26:02] starting in 105
[26:05] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[26:08] light unto my path i have sworn and i
[26:11] will perform it that i will keep thy
[26:13] righteous judgments i am afflicted very
[26:16] much quicken me o lord according unto
[26:18] thy word except i beseech thee the
[26:21] freewill offerings of my mouth o lord
[26:24] and teach me thy judgments
[26:26] my soul is continually in my hand yet do
[26:29] i not forget thy law the wicked have
[26:31] laid a snare for me yet i aired not from
[26:34] thy precepts thy testimonies have i
[26:36] taken as an heritage forever for they
[26:39] are the rejoicing of my heart i have
[26:41] inclined mine
[26:43] to perform thy statutes always even unto
[26:46] the end
[26:56] hey man god bless you you may have your
[26:58] seats

[49:24] hear it anymore so she caught a third
[49:26] doctor in and like there was three of
[49:28] them just putting stuff on my chest and
[49:30] like you know i was like

[58:06] on the throne a book written
[58:09] within and on the backside sealed with

[58:20] and to loose the seal thereof and no man
[58:23] in heaven no man on earth
[58:26] neither under the earth was able to open
[58:28] the book needed to
[58:30] look there there on and i wept much it
[58:34] says because a man but no man was found
[58:36] worthy to open and and to read
[58:38] to read the book needed to look thereon
[58:41] it says and one of the elders
[58:44] said unto me whip not

[59:26] taken the book the four beasts and the
[59:28] four
[59:29] the fourth and twenty elders fell down
[59:32] before the lamb
[59:34] having every one of them of them harps
[59:37] and golden vials full of orders
[59:41] of it says odors which were the prayers
[59:43] of the saints and they sang a new song
[59:46] saying thou are worthy
[59:49] to take the book
[59:51] and to open the seals thereof
[59:53] thou it says for thou has was slain and
[59:57] has redeemed us back to god

[1:00:07] and every nation

[1:00:11] unto our god kings and thou has made us
[1:00:15] unto our god kings and priests that we
[1:00:16] shall reign on the earth and i beheld
[1:00:19] and i heard a voice of many angels
[1:00:22] round about the throne and the beast and
[1:00:24] the elders and the numbers of them was
[1:00:28] ten thousand
[1:00:30] times ten thousand and ten thousand of
[1:00:33] ten thousands it says and thousands of
[1:00:36] thousands
[1:00:37] it says saying with a loud voice worthy
[1:00:40] is the lamb
[1:00:41] that was slain that was slain i was
[1:00:44] slain to receive power and reaches and
[1:00:47] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:00:49] and blessing and every creature which we
[1:00:52] which were in heaven and on the earth
[1:00:55] and under the earth and such as such as

[1:01:01] that are in them

[1:01:36] word to us this morning as we look to
[1:01:38] you we ask that you may just speak to us
[1:01:40] lord in the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:42] christ we pray amen man god bless you
[1:01:44] have your seats
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:47] i
[1:01:49] every believers of this message that
[1:01:52] verse of the scripture means so much to
[1:01:54] us
[1:01:55] because it tells us of what is it that
[1:01:58] we have been called to
[1:02:00] and just go over again it says and the
[1:02:03] elder said unto him whip not behold the
[1:02:06] lion of the tribe of judah and the root
[1:02:09] of david has prevailed to open the book
[1:02:12] we realize that he has been found worthy
[1:02:15] because he was the one who gave his life
[1:02:18] and now he was coming to take the book
[1:02:21] and i would just want to concentrate on
[1:02:23] the verse here we said
[1:02:25] as we read here
[1:02:27] it says
[1:02:29] aimed on verse 9 and it says and they
[1:02:31] sang a new song saying thou are worthy
[1:02:35] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:02:38] thereof
[1:02:39] for thou were slain and has redeemed us
[1:02:42] to god
[1:02:43] by the blood out of every kindred tongue
[1:02:47] and tongue and people and nation
[1:02:49] i want to
[1:02:50] take for title this morning just for a
[1:02:53] few minutes we try not to be too long
[1:02:56] a new song that's my and and and my
[1:02:59] inspiration is
[1:03:01] the song of the redeemed
[1:03:04] and i trust you part of the redeemed
[1:03:06] this morning
[1:03:07] i trust you understand that you are part
[1:03:09] of those that have been called out to
[1:03:11] the from the world we are part of those
[1:03:13] that have been redeemed we have been
[1:03:16] we are part of those that the lamb
[1:03:19] shed forth his blood and he has brought
[1:03:22] us out of this world he's brought us
[1:03:24] into a place and he's given us his song
[1:03:27] a new song to sing
[1:03:29] and that we have been called
[1:03:33] and i can say this morning we have not
[1:03:35] been called to sing like the world sings
[1:03:38] but we have been called to sing a new
[1:03:40] song
[1:03:41] and i want to say this you you have to
[1:03:43] realize as he's saying this a a new song
[1:03:46] is the description of what just has just
[1:03:48] happened a description of what took
[1:03:51] place here comes this lamb and he gave
[1:03:54] his life and he was slain before the
[1:03:56] foundation of the world and now the
[1:03:58] action actually takes place and he shed
[1:04:01] he shed forth his blood and verbanim
[1:04:03] gives such a
[1:04:05] a a a vivid description of what's
[1:04:07] happening it talks about how that
[1:04:10] when i look and there was no one worthy
[1:04:12] no one found worthy to even look upon
[1:04:14] the book and and what was happening and
[1:04:17] he says then one of the elders says weep
[1:04:19] not for the lamb is worthy and then he
[1:04:21] says and i look i look upon the throne
[1:04:23] it says then it was the lamb he says he
[1:04:26] was there was still shaking because he
[1:04:28] has just given his life and he was there
[1:04:30] a bloody lamb he said and then he came
[1:04:33] forth and he took the book and when he
[1:04:35] died when he taken the book what ranam
[1:04:37] says that john was crying and then he
[1:04:39] says someone told him he says well john
[1:04:41] was crying because he thought he was not
[1:04:43] worthy that john was not worthy of
[1:04:45] course john was not worthy of course no
[1:04:48] one was found worthy but when amanda
[1:04:50] says no but i believe john was crying
[1:04:52] because he knew the importance of that
[1:04:54] book
[1:04:55] he knew that if no one took that book
[1:04:58] everything that
[1:04:59] god had died for everything that had
[1:05:01] been done was going to be lost and
[1:05:03] therefore john was crying because he
[1:05:05] understood the importance that by taking
[1:05:08] that book everything was going to be
[1:05:10] brought back in the condition it was
[1:05:11] before and i believe as there are
[1:05:14] believers of this message we are called
[1:05:16] to understand these things because this
[1:05:19] is the revelation of what we are living
[1:05:21] for this is a revelation of what we are
[1:05:24] here for
[1:05:25] now uh
[1:05:26] just if i for as an introduction i would
[1:05:30] like to say this morning you know the
[1:05:32] the we are we are called to be reminded
[1:05:35] of the time that we are living in
[1:05:38] we we as believers we always have to be
[1:05:41] reminded of the glorious times that we
[1:05:44] are living in you know prabhanam says
[1:05:47] this is the greatest age of all the ages
[1:05:50] he says that if there was a time i was
[1:05:52] asked to be to come forth in a time it
[1:05:54] says i wouldn't pick any other age but i
[1:05:57] will come to this age you know because
[1:05:59] as as we are sitting here it's important
[1:06:02] we understand the greatness of the age
[1:06:05] and it's important that we also take the
[1:06:07] benefit of the age
[1:06:09] because if we don't understand the
[1:06:11] greatness of the age then we don't know
[1:06:13] how to uh to live the moment that we
[1:06:16] have been given if you don't understand
[1:06:18] the importance of something then it's
[1:06:20] hard for you to give your all to
[1:06:22] understand it
[1:06:23] it becomes hard for you to uh to make
[1:06:26] sure that you get all that you need to
[1:06:28] get for that particular age so believers
[1:06:30] of this message it's important it's
[1:06:33] important that we are always reminded
[1:06:35] that the time we are living in to know
[1:06:38] that this is the time where god is
[1:06:40] trying to bring his people back to the
[1:06:42] beginning where god is here for the
[1:06:45] promise of the restoration where god is
[1:06:47] here to do what he promised he will do
[1:06:49] in the end time
[1:06:51] now we understand here we are we could
[1:06:54] say uh uh uh the this is a a very
[1:06:58] troubling time for the unbeliever
[1:07:01] we and we have been told that the
[1:07:04] the situation out there we are promised
[1:07:06] it's never going to get better it's
[1:07:08] going to get worse and worse
[1:07:10] it's a very uh uh worst time for the
[1:07:13] unbeliever and we are even told that
[1:07:15] it's only going to get worse and worse
[1:07:17] this is the best time that the world
[1:07:19] will ever be in
[1:07:22] we understand that as we move forward it
[1:07:24] will only get worse and worse so we can
[1:07:27] see and understand that that's true
[1:07:29] that's uh a promise in the scripture and
[1:07:32] and the scripture also tells us that sin
[1:07:35] will continue to abound
[1:07:38] oh my you you you hear and you see the
[1:07:41] things that's happening out there you
[1:07:43] you hear those things out there
[1:07:45] some of them the they cannot even enter
[1:07:47] the ears or the understanding anymore
[1:07:50] uh you you get to a place where men
[1:07:53] don't know what's a man or what's a
[1:07:55] woman the definition of what a woman is
[1:07:57] is lost
[1:07:59] people debate what a woman is
[1:08:02] it's a
[1:08:03] crazy you that the cup of iniquity is
[1:08:05] filling up it's going to get worse and
[1:08:07] worse and that we don't have to worry
[1:08:09] about it but as a believer i want to say
[1:08:12] to us this morning god has also chosen
[1:08:15] this time to be the greatest time that's
[1:08:17] ever been in the in mankind's history
[1:08:21] you say well how about the cross because
[1:08:23] barbados calls it the greatest event
[1:08:24] that's ever happened and i'm here to
[1:08:26] tell you the cross happened the cross
[1:08:29] happened and god gave his life the
[1:08:31] resurrection happened so we can have the
[1:08:33] time that we have today
[1:08:35] without the resurrection we wouldn't be
[1:08:37] where we are so it's not a matter of
[1:08:40] comparing but it's a matter of
[1:08:41] understanding that god is building up
[1:08:44] upon what he did on the resurrection day
[1:08:47] is building up from the life that he has
[1:08:49] given us he hasn't stopped there he's
[1:08:51] bringing us somewhere
[1:08:55] and we can also say that this is the
[1:08:58] culmination of the plan of god what he's
[1:09:01] been working on since the beginning of
[1:09:03] time so as sin abound as all of this is
[1:09:06] about the devil is coming and trying to
[1:09:08] reap heaven and god is saying i will
[1:09:11] wait until the devil brings this world
[1:09:14] unto his feet until the devil takes the
[1:09:17] whole world and he makes it his until he
[1:09:19] owns the fairy world until
[1:09:22] his eden is at the very best i will wait
[1:09:25] until he does that then i will come to
[1:09:27] bring my promise to pass
[1:09:31] he didn't say well i got to do this
[1:09:33] quickly otherwise the devil is going to
[1:09:35] mess it all up no he lets him do
[1:09:37] whatever he wants to do you want to pour
[1:09:40] it in pour it in pour it in pour it in
[1:09:42] are you done you've poured it enough i
[1:09:44] was thinking about even what our pastor
[1:09:46] was talking about with the uh elijah or
[1:09:49] standing on mount carmel oh he let them
[1:09:52] he says just go ahead and they dance and
[1:09:54] they did all that they needed to do and
[1:09:56] all of that but when it came time he
[1:09:58] came he says now i want to show you that
[1:10:01] this is not a fluke i want you to take
[1:10:03] barrels of water and put it upon and
[1:10:06] pour it on they got it so wet that they
[1:10:09] were convinced that is there's no way
[1:10:11] that fire is going to light it up
[1:10:13] but it was at that time that god decided
[1:10:16] to bring his word to come to pass and
[1:10:18] i'm telling you the same showdown is
[1:10:20] happening today god is waiting for the
[1:10:22] devil to pour it on and pour it on and
[1:10:25] put on that he won and after he's done
[1:10:27] all of that god showed up and said i'm
[1:10:29] going to call my bride in this
[1:10:31] particular time
[1:10:34] what a glorious time we are living in we
[1:10:36] should never forget these things
[1:10:39] we are not like any other churches we
[1:10:42] are not like pentecost we are we live in
[1:10:45] a time where god has taken all that was
[1:10:48] good about any other church you add the
[1:10:50] first the second the third the fourth
[1:10:52] you take all of them you combine all of
[1:10:55] them together god has done that plus
[1:10:58] more
[1:11:02] oh we live in the time where it's
[1:11:05] important for us to seize the moment of
[1:11:07] the hour that we have been given
[1:11:09] it's not a time where we behave just
[1:11:11] like any other people and we conduct
[1:11:14] ourselves just as we have to seek that
[1:11:16] which has been given to us we have to
[1:11:19] look for the manifestation of it we have
[1:11:21] to hunger for it we have been given
[1:11:24] something precious we have to keep it we
[1:11:26] have to protect it you have to keep it
[1:11:28] in our heart we have to look for that
[1:11:30] which was promised to come to pass
[1:11:34] it's our promised land we heard it on
[1:11:36] wednesday it's been given to us now look
[1:11:38] at the children of israel
[1:11:40] being given the promised land but you
[1:11:42] read some of them stayed on the other
[1:11:45] side of jordan
[1:11:47] they looked at it and said oh this looks
[1:11:49] good enough for me huh i'm not going
[1:11:51] over there
[1:11:52] and moses was thinking yeah they are
[1:11:54] joshua's saying well we we're supposed
[1:11:57] to help one another you know because
[1:11:59] we're not going to conquer the others if
[1:12:01] some nations decide to stay behind but
[1:12:03] guess what they look and they was just
[1:12:05] satisfied with what they saw with our
[1:12:07] eyes but the true believer is never
[1:12:10] satisfied with what he says with their
[1:12:11] eyes a true believer want everything god
[1:12:14] has given them
[1:12:16] they want to possess it all
[1:12:19] not just for themselves they want to
[1:12:20] possess theirs they want to help their
[1:12:22] neighbors they want to help the other
[1:12:24] one they want to help the other one they
[1:12:26] want everything that was written about
[1:12:29] them they want to have it
[1:12:31] and i hope you want that this morning
[1:12:33] don't be the kind of believer who's just
[1:12:35] satisfied with a little bit you know i
[1:12:37] don't need to understand much just this
[1:12:40] is enough and you know i don't need no
[1:12:42] if the prophet said it if the word says
[1:12:45] it i want to know it i want a taste of
[1:12:48] it i want to i wanted to be part of me
[1:12:53] that's the kind of belief i want to be
[1:12:54] this morning
[1:12:56] so yeah there you are and
[1:12:58] and it was a time where the lamb has
[1:13:01] taken the book and he has opened it as
[1:13:03] we read the scripture the lamb who gave
[1:13:06] his life and now it was time for him to
[1:13:09] come and to claim his possession it was
[1:13:12] a time for him to to for that which he
[1:13:15] had died for the purpose was to return
[1:13:18] us back to the original position and i
[1:13:20] thought about giving the psalms and and
[1:13:23] the testimonies and everything
[1:13:25] when when god reveals to you something
[1:13:28] when god and i'm saying when you read it
[1:13:31] in the word and it's been opened to you
[1:13:34] god wants us to seek for those things
[1:13:37] he the the reason he shows you is so you
[1:13:40] can hunger for it the reason he opens
[1:13:43] your eyes to see is you can look for it
[1:13:46] and when he does it you got to go for it
[1:13:54] and i hope this morning we are longing
[1:13:56] to see those things and
[1:13:59] now what about them says this and this
[1:14:02] isn't
[1:14:02] a message redemption by power
[1:14:05] if i i'm just setting up the foundation
[1:14:07] so we can get somewhere
[1:14:13] in the message redemption by power he
[1:14:15] speaks
[1:14:16] and paragraph 116. i'll just jump a
[1:14:18] little bit it says
[1:14:20] now we are always pointing out
[1:14:24] we are always pointing out how wicked
[1:14:27] the world is getting
[1:14:28] if you can find it and just post it out
[1:14:30] there especially in 54 redemption by
[1:14:33] power paragraph 116.
[1:14:35] it says we are always pointing out
[1:14:40] how wicked the world is getting
[1:14:43] he says but we fail to see how powerful
[1:14:46] the church is getting
[1:14:49] at the same time
[1:14:51] my brother my sister we're not getting
[1:14:53] weak
[1:14:54] we're not getting fainted and we are not
[1:14:57] losing the battle
[1:14:59] the right today is a lot stronger than
[1:15:01] what the right was ten years ago
[1:15:04] a true believer is much it's it's like
[1:15:08] caleb he says i'm 80 years old i'm old
[1:15:11] he says but i'm here right now even
[1:15:13] though the ages caught up with me but
[1:15:16] at least as far as my spirit is
[1:15:18] concerned i am ready to fight than i've
[1:15:21] ever watched before
[1:15:23] when we receive the word of god
[1:15:26] it creates something in us it creates a
[1:15:28] purpose we become more determined as we
[1:15:31] move along
[1:15:32] now if you find yourself regressing
[1:15:35] something is not right if you find
[1:15:37] yourself losing interest you need to go
[1:15:39] check up but but a true believer it gets
[1:15:42] stronger as is moving forward
[1:15:44] he says we point out how wicked the
[1:15:46] world is getting but we fail to see how
[1:15:49] powerful the church is getting
[1:15:51] at the same time it says she's rising up
[1:15:55] she's standing on the field
[1:15:57] oh she's a little flock but brother god
[1:16:01] is with her
[1:16:03] is that she's going triumphant just as
[1:16:06] certain as christ rose from the dead
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:09] god it says god's church shall never
[1:16:12] fail
[1:16:13] it says the gates of hell shall not
[1:16:16] prevail against it he says showed their
[1:16:19] they'll be against it but they cannot
[1:16:21] prevail the church is going to triumph
[1:16:24] through the blood of jesus christ to the
[1:16:27] victory march he says i'm positive of
[1:16:31] this one thing that god will have a
[1:16:33] church without spot or wrinkle or
[1:16:36] blemish amen i'm so happy about it and
[1:16:39] let me say this when random was
[1:16:41] preaching his message he was not
[1:16:43] concerned that oh i got to be around so
[1:16:46] i continue to preach it so i can
[1:16:47] encourage the people he knew he had the
[1:16:50] word of god and he knew that the word of
[1:16:52] god will perform that which he promised
[1:16:54] he will do
[1:16:55] he knew that when the word will go forth
[1:16:58] as long as there's a believer to believe
[1:17:00] that word remember we are not in this
[1:17:02] church by knowledge because we read the
[1:17:05] book and and because we understand what
[1:17:07] he's trying to say and all those things
[1:17:09] now the members of this church that is
[1:17:11] talking about they are elected members
[1:17:14] chosen elected to be here for the church
[1:17:20] so therefore the word that elected them
[1:17:22] the word that predestinated them to be
[1:17:25] there will keep them stronger
[1:17:27] we'll keep them overcoming will keep
[1:17:29] them growing in other words i'm trying
[1:17:32] to say it's important that we don't sing
[1:17:35] the song of the world
[1:17:40] we
[1:17:41] as believers
[1:17:42] we cannot be preoccupied
[1:17:46] by what the world is going is doing
[1:17:51] our song cannot be
[1:17:53] my goodness i thought it was going to be
[1:17:54] worse it's getting worse again
[1:17:56] a song cannot be
[1:17:58] oh my goodness i don't know how i'm
[1:18:00] going to pay my bills tomorrow
[1:18:02] a song cannot be my goodness this
[1:18:04] sickness i'm not sure when it's going to
[1:18:06] end
[1:18:07] that's not the song we have been given
[1:18:10] that's not the song we have been given
[1:18:12] to sing the song we have been doing to
[1:18:15] sing is the lamb is worthy
[1:18:18] and let me say this to you if the lamb
[1:18:20] is worthy there's nothing that you can
[1:18:23] go through this morning that the lamb is
[1:18:25] not already taken care of
[1:18:30] as believers we have to be aware i
[1:18:33] thought our pastor what he preached like
[1:18:35] last sunday just touched my heart he
[1:18:37] says he talks about your testimony and
[1:18:40] he speaks about your confession we are
[1:18:42] confessing the word as believers but
[1:18:45] what i'm saying is a believer cannot
[1:18:46] have a negative testimony
[1:18:50] it's not part of him
[1:18:52] it cannot come out of his mouth that's
[1:18:54] not who he is now i know the flesh
[1:18:57] presented presents a lot of
[1:18:59] opportunities for us to do that the
[1:19:01] flesh you walk up and the bones are
[1:19:03] aching and you know and all those things
[1:19:06] happening and just getting you ready to
[1:19:08] say something and a kid will just come
[1:19:10] by and just get ready to say something
[1:19:12] and the phone will ring and some all the
[1:19:15] condition around us is calling us for us
[1:19:18] to sing the wrong kind of song but the
[1:19:21] believer's song is not coming from
[1:19:23] outside it's coming from the written
[1:19:25] word that they've been given
[1:19:29] thou are worthy
[1:19:31] imagine you woke up and everything seems
[1:19:33] to just have broken loose and the devil
[1:19:36] is on your case and all of that and all
[1:19:38] you do is just lift your hand and say oh
[1:19:40] i know the lamb is worthy
[1:19:43] i know i'm going through this but the
[1:19:45] lamb is worthy
[1:19:46] i know he has opened the book for me
[1:19:49] i know i seen my name in there i know
[1:19:52] what he has done for me my brother my
[1:19:54] sister the the reason why we are singing
[1:19:57] or sitting here this morning is because
[1:19:59] the lamb is worthy
[1:20:02] and he has done it for you so he can
[1:20:04] give you a song to sing this morning
[1:20:09] what song are you singing this morning
[1:20:13] you know
[1:20:14] it's amazing i was thinking about it i
[1:20:16] thought you know it's amazing the
[1:20:19] description and and the way things
[1:20:21] happen in our life
[1:20:23] i just realized i'll never be able to
[1:20:24] finish or get to where i want to get but
[1:20:26] that's all right
[1:20:28] you know
[1:20:29] the things just happening you know at
[1:20:32] work and you know they'll give you so
[1:20:34] many projects and you're working on and
[1:20:35] everything and and and my goodness you
[1:20:38] put so much effort to get something done
[1:20:40] and it takes you sleepless nights and
[1:20:42] everything and you finish it and and you
[1:20:45] get to where you're gonna talk about it
[1:20:48] or say that it's done and everything
[1:20:50] and and the moment you finish everybody
[1:20:52] all that's great what's next
[1:20:56] five seconds of appreciation
[1:21:00] oh
[1:21:01] how about the other one
[1:21:03] i haven't even started rejoicing i
[1:21:05] haven't even had a chance to real oh i
[1:21:08] believe as believers that's not what we
[1:21:10] need to be
[1:21:11] god does something for you and you turn
[1:21:13] what's next no god wants you to rejoice
[1:21:17] to sing a song of praise
[1:21:19] to tell him how wonderful he is
[1:21:22] god i i was born in sin and shepherd
[1:21:25] iniquity and you got me out of the
[1:21:27] streets and i wouldn't have a life if it
[1:21:30] wasn't for you i'm here because you
[1:21:32] allow me to be in the congregation of
[1:21:34] the saints and oh god my song is a song
[1:21:38] of praise and whatever happens to me i
[1:21:41] know you already sealed me unto eternal
[1:21:43] life and this flesh can die you can get
[1:21:46] sick and whatever happens to it i don't
[1:21:48] care as long as you are with me oh
[1:21:51] that's the kind of song i want to sing
[1:21:53] this morning
[1:21:55] that's the believer's song
[1:21:57] that's what we have been called to sing
[1:21:59] we are not being called to say what the
[1:22:02] world is saying all the economy
[1:22:04] inflation and all of this and now those
[1:22:06] things affects us as human but when all
[1:22:09] is said and done you have to remember
[1:22:11] what your song is
[1:22:17] so i want to say this morning
[1:22:19] though we have the word and the
[1:22:21] revelation
[1:22:23] and is more
[1:22:25] is what's giving us for us to sing
[1:22:29] we are growing in virtue
[1:22:33] and as the bride of the end time
[1:22:36] and perhaps we'll touch on some of these
[1:22:38] things later
[1:22:40] we are not here to get weaker and weaker
[1:22:45] we have not been called to manifest
[1:22:48] darkness
[1:22:50] we have been called to sing god's song
[1:22:52] of praise
[1:22:54] we have been called to manifest the
[1:22:57] mysteries of god in the end time what
[1:23:00] the lamb has done
[1:23:02] oh this lamb is so worthy let me tell
[1:23:04] you my buddy my sister is so worthy that
[1:23:07] no one else was found worthy
[1:23:12] and everything that happens to us goes
[1:23:15] back right to that because if the lamb
[1:23:18] was not worthy then there's a fault that
[1:23:20] could be fined with us but if the lamb
[1:23:22] is worthy then it's accounted for
[1:23:25] everything
[1:23:29] now let me just move on uh we'll get to
[1:23:32] some of these things it says now i was
[1:23:34] uh
[1:23:36] reading and and and
[1:23:38] reading
[1:23:39] what is uh referred to as the song of
[1:23:41] moses
[1:23:42] and and and as a background yes the
[1:23:45] children of israel
[1:23:47] after they've been in bondage for 400
[1:23:49] years
[1:23:50] now
[1:23:50] the promise was given to them through
[1:23:52] abraham that your children will go on to
[1:23:55] bondage for 400 years and but then i'll
[1:23:57] bring him up with the mighty hand and
[1:23:59] everything and all the things and now i
[1:24:02] want just to set the scene for you i
[1:24:04] want you to imagine here they are and
[1:24:07] and standing there before the red sea
[1:24:09] and the enemy's coming and god opens the
[1:24:13] red sea and and they walk through the
[1:24:15] land and the tri-land and they go over
[1:24:18] to the other side and then when they
[1:24:20] cross over to the other side this is
[1:24:22] referred to the song of moses now i want
[1:24:25] you as you listen to this i want you to
[1:24:27] take it in reference of what god has
[1:24:30] just done for them
[1:24:32] listen to me a song is just not words
[1:24:36] that someone puts together and
[1:24:38] everything its song has to be a
[1:24:40] reflection of a work that's been done a
[1:24:44] song is something that you are
[1:24:46] testifying of what god has just done a
[1:24:49] song is you identifying with the works
[1:24:52] that was just done for you
[1:24:54] and so yes what moses is singing now in
[1:24:58] exodus 15 if we can start from verse one
[1:25:00] it says then sung moses and the children
[1:25:03] of israel this song unto the lord it
[1:25:07] says in this fig saying i will sing unto
[1:25:10] the lord for he had triumphed gloriously
[1:25:14] the horse it says the horse and his
[1:25:17] rider has as he drowned into the sea
[1:25:21] it just happened right it says now you
[1:25:24] can see he says the lord is my strength
[1:25:26] and my song
[1:25:28] and he has become my salvation he just
[1:25:30] did it
[1:25:31] it says and he is my god and i will
[1:25:34] prepare him an inhabitation
[1:25:37] my father's god i will exalt him all the
[1:25:41] heard about the god of moses of isaac
[1:25:43] and and of jacob and all the things all
[1:25:46] its mighty acts and everything now they
[1:25:49] could say those things but yet it had
[1:25:51] not become a song for them yet that
[1:25:53] could repeat those things but yet he had
[1:25:56] not become a reality yet all but once
[1:25:58] god makes it a reality it becomes your
[1:26:01] song
[1:26:04] god gave me a song this morning i want
[1:26:07] to praise you like the people that
[1:26:09] i want to sing like moses said give me a
[1:26:12] song to say do something in my life
[1:26:15] change me bring about the change that i
[1:26:18] need bring about the revelation that i
[1:26:20] need so that i can sing a new song for
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:24] now it says the lord is the man of war
[1:26:28] the lord is his name he says pharaoh
[1:26:31] chariot and his host and he cast into
[1:26:34] the sea his chosen captain are also
[1:26:37] drowned in the right sea the depths have
[1:26:39] covered them it says they sunk unto the
[1:26:42] bottom of the as a stone is that
[1:26:44] somebody that knows about a god like
[1:26:46] that oh the enemy will come to the right
[1:26:49] hand and to the left hand but the lord
[1:26:51] is the man of war
[1:26:53] he says thy right hand oh lord it says
[1:26:56] he's become glorious in power
[1:26:59] thy right hand o lord has dashed a p at
[1:27:03] pieces of in pieces the enemy it says in
[1:27:06] thy greatness in that excellency thou
[1:27:09] has overthrown them that rose up against
[1:27:12] thee
[1:27:13] oh
[1:27:14] my brother my sister
[1:27:16] this is the song of the redeemed
[1:27:19] this is a people
[1:27:21] god is not interested
[1:27:24] let me say this
[1:27:25] god is not interested of praise that he
[1:27:28] had not given
[1:27:32] satan will take that
[1:27:34] god don't want you to come here this
[1:27:36] morning and talk about salvation sing
[1:27:39] about salvation when you have no idea
[1:27:42] what salvation is about
[1:27:46] god don't want you to come here and talk
[1:27:48] about healing and don't know what
[1:27:50] healing is all about deliverance when
[1:27:52] you don't know what deliverance is about
[1:27:54] now he is calling you is he has a song
[1:27:57] but for you to sing it he wants to give
[1:27:59] you the revelation of it this morning
[1:28:02] he's not casting you out he's calling
[1:28:04] you he said you heard them sing you
[1:28:07] heard him shout now come here i'll give
[1:28:10] you the same words so you can sing the
[1:28:12] same song
[1:28:14] oh a song the praise to the lord oh i
[1:28:18] just never finished this it says and in
[1:28:20] thy greatness it says and in thy
[1:28:23] greatness and in our excellence thou has
[1:28:25] overthrown them that rose up against
[1:28:27] thee thou sent ascended
[1:28:30] thou
[1:28:31] sentest forth thy wrath which consumed
[1:28:34] them it's as subtle it says and with the
[1:28:38] blast of thy nostril the waters were
[1:28:40] gathered together
[1:28:42] it says the flow stood upright
[1:28:45] as a hip
[1:28:46] and the depths were were concealed and
[1:28:50] the heart in the in the heart of the sea
[1:28:53] it says the enemy said i will pursue i
[1:28:56] will overtake i will divide this poll oh
[1:28:59] my they already plain of what we're
[1:29:01] gonna do they already talked about how
[1:29:04] they were gonna take them and what they
[1:29:06] were gonna do with them and it says all
[1:29:08] my laces it says i will divide this
[1:29:11] point my lust shall be satisfied upon
[1:29:14] them i will draw my sword my hand shall
[1:29:17] destroy them it says thou didst blow thy
[1:29:21] wing
[1:29:22] it says the sea covered them they sang
[1:29:26] they they sank as they sank as lead in
[1:29:30] the mighty water he says who is like
[1:29:33] unto thee
[1:29:34] oh lord among the gods
[1:29:37] my brother my sister we have a song to
[1:29:39] sing this morning
[1:29:41] if god has never done anything for you
[1:29:44] this is your opportunity this morning
[1:29:46] for him to give you a song so you can
[1:29:49] know him like your parents know him so
[1:29:51] you can know him like the prophet knew
[1:29:53] him so you can know him like no one else
[1:29:56] before
[1:29:59] oh my
[1:30:01] he says
[1:30:03] who is like unto thee oh god oh lord
[1:30:05] among the gods who is like thee
[1:30:09] glorious is glorious in holiness
[1:30:12] fearful in praise doing wonders
[1:30:15] thou stretched it out thy right hand the
[1:30:18] earth swallowed them
[1:30:20] it says thou in thy mercy has led forth
[1:30:23] the people which thou has redeemed it
[1:30:26] says thou has guided them in thy
[1:30:29] strength unto the holy
[1:30:31] habitation he says the people shall hear
[1:30:35] and be afraid
[1:30:39] think about this
[1:30:40] as part of the song
[1:30:42] when god is doing this
[1:30:45] he's doing this now
[1:30:47] but he's already warning your future
[1:30:49] enemies
[1:30:51] think about this
[1:30:53] he's already warning your future enemies
[1:30:55] so when you sing the song the enemy
[1:30:58] hears the song and says
[1:31:00] what kind of god is that oh he said oh
[1:31:02] he opened the right sea and he swallowed
[1:31:04] them now remember when he talked about
[1:31:06] when he came to jericho people in
[1:31:08] jericho they heard those songs they
[1:31:11] heard what god had done with other
[1:31:13] nations they had heard about this
[1:31:15] greatness about all that he could do and
[1:31:18] just by hearing they were fearful before
[1:31:21] even one wall could start
[1:31:24] so when god gives you a song it's not
[1:31:26] for you to keep it for yourself
[1:31:32] you meet someone who's sick
[1:31:35] i know i forgot
[1:31:38] i don't have the power to heal you
[1:31:41] i don't have the power to do anything
[1:31:43] for you in fact i don't even have the
[1:31:45] power to change you
[1:31:47] but i know a god
[1:31:49] and he can come
[1:31:51] and i can speak his word
[1:31:53] you can receive his word and receive the
[1:31:56] same thing that i receive
[1:31:57] that's the song of a believer that's the
[1:32:00] song of the overcomer he has given me a
[1:32:03] song he has put praises on my lips david
[1:32:06] says one place how shall i sing
[1:32:09] if you destroy me
[1:32:11] if these things don't happen what will i
[1:32:13] say if god doesn't save me how can i
[1:32:16] sing of his salvation but oh if he saves
[1:32:19] me i'll let the whole world know
[1:32:24] it says the people shall hear and be
[1:32:28] afraid
[1:32:30] sorrow
[1:32:31] shall be shall take
[1:32:33] hold of the inhabitation of palestine
[1:32:36] they hadn't even gotten there
[1:32:41] they hadn't even gotten there
[1:32:43] already
[1:32:45] the fame of this god had already reached
[1:32:48] and done the work that he was supposed
[1:32:50] to do
[1:32:51] before that's why when he says go go
[1:32:53] forward he says i have taken i have
[1:32:56] taken the land i have taken the land but
[1:33:00] i call you to go so what he wants you to
[1:33:02] do he wants you to understand
[1:33:04] you are not the one that's fighting the
[1:33:06] battle
[1:33:07] he the the very testimony that he
[1:33:10] surrounds you with is the very victory
[1:33:12] that goes with you so all he wants you
[1:33:14] to do is repeat the things that he has
[1:33:17] done so that the things that he has done
[1:33:20] move forward before you to take care of
[1:33:22] what you needed in the future
[1:33:27] i mentioned it last time i preached here
[1:33:29] but there's a thing called the i just i
[1:33:32] don't know where i got it i just it just
[1:33:34] came to me
[1:33:35] it's the wilderness mentality
[1:33:38] and that's always to appreciate the past
[1:33:42] more than the present
[1:33:50] it's
[1:33:51] it's always talking about the past being
[1:33:54] more glorious than the future
[1:33:57] it's always focusing on
[1:33:59] oh i wish i had that i wish this i wish
[1:34:03] that and never having the realization of
[1:34:06] what god is doing
[1:34:08] and what he's going to do
[1:34:13] he says
[1:34:16] then
[1:34:18] the dukes the dukes of eden
[1:34:21] shall be amazed
[1:34:23] the mighty men of moab
[1:34:26] tram it says trembling shall take hold
[1:34:29] upon them
[1:34:31] all the inhabitants of canon shall melt
[1:34:34] away
[1:34:36] fear and dread shall fall upon them
[1:34:40] by the greatness
[1:34:42] of thine arm they shall be
[1:34:45] as still as a stone
[1:34:47] till thy people pass over oh lord till
[1:34:50] the people pass over
[1:34:52] thou it says
[1:34:54] shall pass over
[1:34:55] which thou has
[1:34:57] had purchased
[1:34:58] it says that shall bring them in
[1:35:01] plant them in the mountain of thy
[1:35:03] inheritance we heard about that this
[1:35:05] morning
[1:35:06] in the place o lord which thou has made
[1:35:09] for that for thee to dwell in
[1:35:12] in the sanctuary o lord which thou has
[1:35:15] established
[1:35:16] it says the lord shall reign forever and
[1:35:19] ever
[1:35:20] for the horse
[1:35:22] for the ho for the horse of the philis
[1:35:24] the pharaohs
[1:35:25] went in went in with his chariot with
[1:35:28] his horsemen into the sea
[1:35:31] it says the lord brought again the water
[1:35:34] of the sea upon them
[1:35:36] but the children of israel went on dry
[1:35:38] land
[1:35:40] in the midst of the sea it says and
[1:35:42] miriam the prophetess
[1:35:44] the sister of aaron
[1:35:46] took the trembling in her hand
[1:35:49] and all the women went out
[1:35:52] after her with the trap with the
[1:35:55] trembling
[1:35:57] it says and with a dance
[1:36:00] and miriam answered
[1:36:02] them singing
[1:36:04] yeah the lord yeah to the lord for here
[1:36:07] triumph gloriously
[1:36:09] the horse
[1:36:11] and his rider
[1:36:12] had drawn in the sea
[1:36:15] repeating the same verse
[1:36:17] that's what the believer testimony is
[1:36:21] how do you win somebody to the lord
[1:36:24] when your own testimony or your own song
[1:36:28] is doom and gloom
[1:36:33] oh you know i remember when i was in the
[1:36:35] well
[1:36:36] you know but now i don't do those things
[1:36:38] anymore
[1:36:40] you know
[1:36:42] i i remember this and but you know i
[1:36:45] don't do those things you know if it
[1:36:46] wasn't for the lord as i go by
[1:36:51] i don't mean that kind of song
[1:36:54] i want to hear the song of praise you
[1:36:56] know the song of praise when he started
[1:36:58] even when i was born
[1:37:00] it says even in my mother's womb before
[1:37:02] i was conceived i was still in the world
[1:37:05] but yet there was a desire i was still
[1:37:07] there so i would do this but then i
[1:37:09] won't have peace and this will have well
[1:37:11] it was still the song even in your
[1:37:14] unbelief
[1:37:15] you just didn't know that it was a song
[1:37:18] but when you come to the other side the
[1:37:20] whole song become clear
[1:37:22] now i can see why this happened now i
[1:37:24] can see why that person told me this now
[1:37:26] i can see why this happened over here
[1:37:28] why it's the song of your life and let
[1:37:31] me say this tonight the song that god
[1:37:34] has given you in the same time it's not
[1:37:36] a temporary song it's not a song that
[1:37:39] we're gonna change just here it's a song
[1:37:41] for eternity
[1:37:45] it's it's the only song we're to sing
[1:37:47] forever
[1:37:49] it's the only saying when the angel
[1:37:50] gathers we sing what's up or when they
[1:37:53] redeem it says we'll sing redemption
[1:37:55] stories we'll sing songs that the angel
[1:37:57] have no idea
[1:38:00] they cannot join the song they don't
[1:38:02] know what the song means they just look
[1:38:04] in amazement why because we have been
[1:38:06] given a portion of the course that only
[1:38:10] us can seem
[1:38:17] i'm not even halfway so
[1:38:20] we'll try to end somewhere and then pick
[1:38:21] it up tonight
[1:38:25] now
[1:38:27] what about him says
[1:38:29] he says
[1:38:30] now those egyptian task master
[1:38:33] had drove the people
[1:38:35] to do things that they were burdened to
[1:38:37] do
[1:38:39] and after they looked back in the red
[1:38:41] sea
[1:38:42] they found them
[1:38:44] everyone drowned therein
[1:38:47] no wonder that moses sang a new song
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:52] no wonder moses sang a new song
[1:38:55] he sang in the spirit and miriam picked
[1:38:57] up the tambourine and began to beat the
[1:39:00] tambourine and run down the banks and
[1:39:02] dancing it says oh if that and an
[1:39:05] old-fashioned
[1:39:06] holy ghost meeting i never seen one it
[1:39:09] says that's right and the daughters of
[1:39:11] israel followed her doing the same thing
[1:39:14] they
[1:39:15] had
[1:39:16] overcome
[1:39:20] they
[1:39:21] had
[1:39:22] overcome
[1:39:24] and you are sitting here because you are
[1:39:26] an overcomer
[1:39:28] you are here because you've overcome the
[1:39:30] world you are here because god has done
[1:39:34] something for you
[1:39:36] in other words what that which was just
[1:39:38] a promise in the book that which was
[1:39:40] just written that is going to happen
[1:39:42] when god makes the manifestation of that
[1:39:45] becomes a reality to the believer it
[1:39:48] becomes a new song
[1:39:50] when that which was promised when that
[1:39:52] which was written when god takes his
[1:39:54] word and makes it real to you when it
[1:39:57] takes and it gives you the revelation of
[1:39:59] it not the words of it the revelation of
[1:40:02] it it becomes a new song to you
[1:40:05] amen
[1:40:07] now he says this listen it says
[1:40:10] and the man
[1:40:11] never know
[1:40:13] what is what it is to live a victorious
[1:40:16] life
[1:40:16] until
[1:40:18] he is completely
[1:40:20] overcome
[1:40:22] you know what it is
[1:40:24] you're just singing somebody else's song
[1:40:27] you're just repeating the words that
[1:40:29] somebody else said
[1:40:31] now i know we can go a whole hot
[1:40:33] line right now
[1:40:35] but let's just skip here
[1:40:39] we talk about music we talk about those
[1:40:41] things
[1:40:42] the idea is not so you just
[1:40:44] like the tunes
[1:40:46] the idea is the identification
[1:40:52] the idea is the identification is there
[1:40:54] anything in there that connects
[1:40:57] it's not the beat
[1:41:00] you know i i joke that without the beat
[1:41:02] i can't do anything you know when the
[1:41:04] musicians come up here you know if you
[1:41:07] if you're sitting closer i mean i'm just
[1:41:08] stamping because i gotta get the beat
[1:41:14] but what is your song this morning
[1:41:18] is your song this morning
[1:41:20] is god giving you a song
[1:41:22] if you don't have asked him to give you
[1:41:24] one this morning
[1:41:25] said god i i my song is only halfway
[1:41:29] my song my song is only a quarter i can
[1:41:32] only sing about your salvation but i
[1:41:34] haven't experienced the other side yet i
[1:41:36] don't know what it means to be this and
[1:41:38] i don't know what it means to be a
[1:41:40] positioned son why don't you come this
[1:41:42] morning and just give me a song
[1:41:44] why don't you come this morning and just
[1:41:46] reveal yourself to me why don't you come
[1:41:48] and give me a new song remember the song
[1:41:51] is the same person it's not another
[1:41:54] group that cross over and sing a
[1:41:56] different song no it's the same people
[1:41:58] and one time they would get and one time
[1:42:00] they were not worthy to sing the soul at
[1:42:03] one time they couldn't even answer the
[1:42:05] word the next moment after what the lord
[1:42:08] has done
[1:42:09] it gives them the ability to sing the
[1:42:11] song
[1:42:12] ask him for a song this morning we're
[1:42:15] not here to to call out one another or
[1:42:18] to expose one another that the purpose
[1:42:20] of preaching is not so one can feel the
[1:42:22] shame no but the purpose is so that when
[1:42:25] you don't have when you lack that god
[1:42:28] can come this morning and provide
[1:42:30] whatever we are like
[1:42:32] and and i i just said lord i'm lacking
[1:42:34] this morning
[1:42:35] i need a song to sing
[1:42:38] i need to polish the word of my song and
[1:42:41] i sing it for a while and now it seems
[1:42:43] like i've had it crushed on it and it's
[1:42:45] not coming out perfectly come and clean
[1:42:48] me this morning so the words of the song
[1:42:50] can be more powerful again
[1:42:55] if the musician could come
[1:42:57] we'll just continue tonight i'm sorry
[1:42:59] i've only
[1:43:00] i have 20 pages so there's no way we're
[1:43:02] gonna
[1:43:04] david says in psalm
[1:43:07] it says
[1:43:08] psalm 144 it says
[1:43:10] my goodness
[1:43:13] and my fortress
