[48:16] and the first one in would receive the
[48:18] blessing
[48:24] i'd like to be the first one in
[48:28] but there's no limit to god's benefits
[48:30] tonight
[48:32] everyone here
[48:33] can enjoy those benefits
[48:40] [Music]
[48:41] many needs upon our hearts and lives
[48:50] but brother branham explained to us
[48:52] that man is omnipotent
[48:59] when he's come to the
[49:00] saving knowledge of the lord jesus that
[49:02] is
[49:03] and we pray to an omnipotent god
[49:06] and when those two things meet
[49:09] some of the supernatural is bound to
[49:11] happen
[49:13] so let's bow our heads and realize that
[49:15] whatever we have need of

[1:03:04] hamburgers and hot dogs and everything
[1:03:06] and you can just go down there and
[1:03:07] finish it up after service amen but
[1:03:10] right now we want to feed on something
[1:03:12] else
[1:03:14] you know
[1:03:15] it was
[1:03:17] back in
[1:03:18] i thought you know last november and
[1:03:20] then i got to thinking it was in
[1:03:22] november
[1:03:23] before that so it's been two years
[1:03:26] since we've had
[1:03:28] our meeting
[1:03:30] and you know i remember something that
[1:03:32] was
[1:03:34] i heard a statement that brother branham
[1:03:35] made very
[1:03:37] early when i first
[1:03:39] came into the message
[1:03:42] he said
[1:03:43] the best place to find the lord jesus is
[1:03:46] where you left him
[1:03:50] you know go back
[1:03:52] to where you left him
[1:03:54] and so
[1:03:55] i got to thinking about our
[1:03:57] meeting
[1:03:58] and i thought lord where did we
[1:04:01] leave off at

[1:14:17] we'll take an overall view and then
[1:14:18] we'll take a
[1:14:21] take an individual
[1:14:23] view
[1:14:24] hear the scripture tonight
[1:14:30] luke chapter 6 verse 17 and the bible
[1:14:32] reads and he came down with them he's
[1:14:34] talking about the apostles and they are
[1:14:37] mentioned in
[1:14:39] verses before
[1:14:40] he came down with them and he stood in
[1:14:42] the plane
[1:14:44] and the company of his disciples and a
[1:14:46] great multitude of people
[1:14:49] out of all judea and jerusalem
[1:14:53] came from the seacoast tire and saddam
[1:14:57] which came to hear him
[1:15:00] came to be healed
[1:15:02] of their diseases
[1:15:04] and they that were vexed with unclean
[1:15:08] spirits what does the bible say
[1:15:14] they were healed
[1:15:16] they came with an expectation
[1:15:19] and god met that expectation
[1:15:22] they didn't come to gawk they didn't
[1:15:23] come to look they didn't come just to
[1:15:25] see what was going on
[1:15:27] there is actually a need within them
[1:15:30] and god was able to meet that need and
[1:15:32] they came from all over the place so you
[1:15:34] can look around the room tonight and say
[1:15:36] well we come from all over the place but
[1:15:38] where's jesus
[1:15:39] and i want to say jesus is here
[1:15:43] jesus is here
[1:15:46] your bible my bible says in hebrews 13 8
[1:15:49] jesus christ the same
[1:15:52] today
[1:15:53] forever
[1:15:54] and just
[1:15:56] a quick look at the message brother
[1:15:58] brown says it over three thousand times
[1:16:01] i would say that he's trying to get a
[1:16:02] point across
[1:16:04] that he's just not the god of yesterday
[1:16:07] or a god of the future
[1:16:09] i want to tell you he's a god that is
[1:16:10] here right now
[1:16:12] and he's here to deliver he's here to
[1:16:14] save he's here to heal he's here to do
[1:16:17] exceedingly and abundantly more than you
[1:16:19] can ask or think
[1:16:21] i'm not here to show you or tell you how
[1:16:23] much i know in my gray matter because i
[1:16:24] don't have much great math
[1:16:28] i got a big heart
[1:16:30] and i love the lore
[1:16:33] i love him
[1:16:35] so it's bible says he didn't hear some
[1:16:37] of them he healed them all
[1:16:39] and i would love it from here from gary
[1:16:42] to all the way in the back
[1:16:43] that we could go to the house of god
[1:16:45] tonight with our hands lifted up
[1:16:46] glorifying the king of glory and saying
[1:16:49] that same god that they met on the plane
[1:16:52] is the same god that met me at church
[1:16:55] and delivered us from everything
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] amen we're not playing church we're
[1:17:01] finished playing church we are the
[1:17:04] church and we're going forward we're
[1:17:06] going to show a dying world that god
[1:17:09] interrupts his redeemed
[1:17:10] god interrupts only his seed
[1:17:13] he'll let serpent seed go its way but he
[1:17:16] will not let the elect go their way he
[1:17:18] will interrupt their lives he will meet
[1:17:20] your every need
[1:17:23] how many got a need tonight
[1:17:25] amen remember there's a church that did
[1:17:28] not have a need in laodicea they had
[1:17:30] needed nothing
[1:17:31] blind miserable naked and didn't know it
[1:17:35] needed nothing but we're needy people
[1:17:38] needy of god to interrupt our lives
[1:17:41] take us from a lukewarm person to a
[1:17:44] church that's on fire
[1:17:48] amen i don't believe this
[1:17:53] no i don't get that i don't get that
[1:17:55] as i invited our church the other day
[1:17:57] well if you're looking for that kind of
[1:17:58] church in the wrong church
[1:18:04] all right
[1:18:06] we haven't finished reading the
[1:18:07] scripture yet and you're worried that
[1:18:08] you're not sitting
[1:18:11] i don't know if they had seats where
[1:18:13] jesus were
[1:18:15] i don't know
[1:18:16] they were in the plane nobody robbed you
[1:18:18] know folding chairs
[1:18:21] but they wanted to get to jesus
[1:18:23] amen it didn't matter what situation get
[1:18:26] me to jesus
[1:18:28] they brought the sick the lame the halt
[1:18:29] and god healed them all
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:33] praise the lord
[1:18:35] and they that were vexed with unclean
[1:18:37] spirits and they were
[1:18:39] healed
[1:18:40] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[1:18:43] him
[1:18:45] interrupt us lord
[1:18:48] the whole multitude sought to touch him
[1:18:52] for there went virtue out of him
[1:18:55] and he healed i want you to read that
[1:18:57] with me and he healed them
[1:19:00] and he healed
[1:19:02] them all
[1:19:03] may the lord add his blessing to his
[1:19:05] word you may have your seeds
[1:19:16] how many have ever read that or sang
[1:19:19] that song
[1:19:21] pass me not
[1:19:23] oh gentle savior
[1:19:26] hear my humble cry
[1:19:30] and maybe we've come to meetings and
[1:19:32] we're always with all filled with
[1:19:34] expectations and it seems we should be
[1:19:38] but sometimes sometimes the holy spirit
[1:19:40] needs to deal with us individually
[1:19:44] deal with us personally
[1:19:47] and fanny cosby she sang
[1:19:50] and wrote a little song
[1:19:53] pass me not o
[1:19:55] gentle
[1:19:57] savior can we say gentle shepherd
[1:20:01] gentle jesus
[1:20:03] past me not
[1:20:05] o gentle
[1:20:07] savior
[1:20:09] then if he is here
[1:20:12] and i do believe with all my heart
[1:20:14] or i wouldn't be preaching
[1:20:17] that if he's here
[1:20:19] and he can is doing
[1:20:22] his part
[1:20:23] greg he can do his part
[1:20:26] but we have to do our part
[1:20:29] and our part is reach out
[1:20:33] and touch the lord
[1:20:36] as he
[1:20:38] passes by
[1:20:40] and that's that's pretty personal isn't
[1:20:42] it
[1:20:43] that's pretty
[1:20:44] personal
[1:20:46] so the scripture says they
[1:20:49] came to the plain and the multitude of
[1:20:51] people came from all over judea and
[1:20:52] jerusalem and sighed on by the sea
[1:20:55] they came to meet this jesus and we've
[1:20:57] come to a meeting and had a wonderful
[1:20:59] meeting last night
[1:21:01] and yet we can get lost in the crowd
[1:21:04] we can get lost in the amens and the
[1:21:06] hallelujahs and the glory to gods and
[1:21:09] and i'm i'm one of those people that
[1:21:11] like those things
[1:21:13] but like brother burley said i don't
[1:21:14] need those things
[1:21:16] i just need him
[1:21:19] and
[1:21:20] if he's coming by
[1:21:24] then he deserves the praise
[1:21:26] the worship the glory
[1:21:31] he does deserve it all
[1:21:37] so he's here to maybe interrupt your
[1:21:39] life tonight
[1:21:43] so i just came here a preacher preached
[1:21:46] and
[1:21:48] brother tommy's excitable or something
[1:21:51] i am
[1:21:54] something to be excited about
[1:21:57] but i'm also here because i love him
[1:22:01] and i would want him to deal with me
[1:22:03] just as much as he would deal with you
[1:22:09] see you don't know what i am
[1:22:15] you don't know what it was
[1:22:19] and a lot of us have individual lives
[1:22:22] that nobody knows nothing about
[1:22:25] but jesus interrupted it
[1:22:29] changed me
[1:22:31] changed me
[1:22:33] filled me
[1:22:35] watched over me
[1:22:37] blessed me
[1:22:38] kept me
[1:22:40] and he's still keeping me
[1:22:44] so what he's done for one
[1:22:47] he'll do for others
[1:22:50] and there's as your pastor has said
[1:22:52] there is nothing he cannot do
[1:22:56] we're the ones that limit him
[1:22:58] he's unlimitable
[1:23:01] he's immeasurable
[1:23:03] he's omnipotent
[1:23:05] and we got these big words to explain it
[1:23:07] because we're finite we're trying to
[1:23:09] understand god but he could move on this
[1:23:12] little church right now and we would
[1:23:14] never even have to preach
[1:23:16] if they did it in the old testament
[1:23:18] what's wrong with the new testament the
[1:23:20] glory of god come down in that temple
[1:23:22] when solomon dedicated it and the
[1:23:24] minister couldn't even minister wouldn't
[1:23:27] that be something if all of a sudden we
[1:23:29] started to just get interrupted and we
[1:23:32] started to lift up our own heart and
[1:23:33] lift up our hands and lift up our voices
[1:23:36] and say to your wife or to your children
[1:23:38] honey god's here if he's here let's
[1:23:42] worship him let's glorify him
[1:23:47] i don't want to be an observer i don't
[1:23:48] want to be a part of the crowd that said
[1:23:49] who's those crazy people
[1:23:51] i'll be with jesus any day of the week
[1:23:54] they want to call him a fanatic they
[1:23:55] want to call him bowser bob i'll call
[1:23:57] him king of kings i'll call him lord
[1:24:00] supreme
[1:24:01] he interrupted matthew said matthew you
[1:24:04] come out of that tax
[1:24:06] booth and you come with me interrupted
[1:24:08] james and john and peter and andrew
[1:24:11] he's here to interrupt your life
[1:24:15] so i'm tired of just being a lukewarm
[1:24:17] church member i want to be on fire with
[1:24:20] god i want this message alive i want to
[1:24:23] see the son of man myself
[1:24:26] i don't want it to be an expression i
[1:24:27] want it to be an experience
[1:24:36] i'm sorry
[1:24:39] but i'm not sorry
[1:24:42] i feel like that little woman half the
[1:24:44] time
[1:24:45] i just want to wash his feet
[1:24:48] i don't care about you
[1:24:51] i don't think she cared about anybody
[1:24:53] all she just cared about was jesus
[1:24:56] she didn't care about the pharisees
[1:24:59] actors you know what a pharisee i mean
[1:25:01] they act religion i'm not interested
[1:25:03] acting church acting special meetings i
[1:25:06] want to wash jesus fate
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:10] amen
[1:25:11] she interrupted simon the pharisees home
[1:25:14] his party was over
[1:25:17] she rained on his parade
[1:25:26] hallelujah said he's the one
[1:25:29] cousin he's the one
[1:25:30] he's here
[1:25:32] you mean me in my unsafe state or my
[1:25:34] backslidden state that jesus is here yes
[1:25:38] he's here
[1:25:41] he's here
[1:25:47] brother brown so often said
[1:25:50] he's not 10 feet away
[1:25:52] he's not six feet away
[1:25:55] he's the same
[1:25:57] he's not six feet away
[1:26:02] he's just right here
[1:26:04] can he interrupt your life
[1:26:06] did he interrupt it
[1:26:12] i i i like just being what i am i just
[1:26:14] like i i just like sitting here and
[1:26:17] coming to church and letting everybody
[1:26:19] do everything and i just want to be
[1:26:22] a taker not a giver
[1:26:24] so many takers where's all the givers
[1:26:27] but brown said true christianity is
[1:26:29] living for others that means everybody
[1:26:31] here should be a giver
[1:26:38] so brother branham was trying to show us
[1:26:40] that the son of man himself jesus christ
[1:26:43] was a very present god to
[1:26:45] to interrupt our lives
[1:26:50] oh little lady i wonder if i just turned
[1:26:52] my back and said oh little lady dear
[1:26:55] little lady
[1:26:56] he's not looking at anybody
[1:26:59] little lady sitting here looking like
[1:27:01] this with her hands praying
[1:27:04] you've got a bad hand and she was
[1:27:06] praying
[1:27:07] i'd say the holy spirit interrupted her
[1:27:08] life
[1:27:10] she came to a meeting but jesus came to
[1:27:11] the same meeting
[1:27:13] jesus came to the plane and then god met
[1:27:16] their needs
[1:27:17] i know that jesus christ is here right
[1:27:19] now and i know that he could meet your
[1:27:21] needs
[1:27:22] you say well brother tom i lost my joy
[1:27:24] you can find your joy right now in
[1:27:25] christ jesus
[1:27:27] amen you can find your victory
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:33] yes sir
[1:27:35] you can't find anything
[1:27:37] you got a bad hand
[1:27:39] but do you believe
[1:27:41] that's the question
[1:27:42] do you believe even the little
[1:27:44] introduction we've got on right now
[1:27:46] do you believe
[1:27:48] do you believe my jesus is here
[1:27:50] you believe your jesus is here
[1:27:53] yeah
[1:27:54] he said
[1:27:57] you didn't touch me
[1:28:00] you touched him
[1:28:04] so you don't have to touch brother tom
[1:28:06] you don't have to touch an altar you can
[1:28:07] touch
[1:28:08] him
[1:28:11] here
[1:28:12] just touching jesus
[1:28:14] as the songwriter says this is all that
[1:28:16] really matters
[1:28:18] and your life do you know the song
[1:28:21] and what does it say in your life or
[1:28:22] what
[1:28:24] never be the same when he interrupts
[1:28:25] your life it'll never be the same when
[1:28:28] tom ray got interrupted it would never
[1:28:29] be the same drugs went never be the same
[1:28:31] drinking went never been the same never
[1:28:33] gone back don't want to go back
[1:28:36] never been the same only one more
[1:28:39] and then a songwriter said i want more
[1:28:40] of jesus
[1:28:42] more and more and more
[1:28:44] at utes asked me has there been time you
[1:28:46] didn't want more
[1:28:48] there's never been a time
[1:28:52] never
[1:28:53] been a time
[1:28:54] that i didn't want more jesus
[1:29:02] not a time
[1:29:05] can you turn with me please to psalms
[1:29:07] 38.

[1:29:58] in my flesh because of thy anger
[1:30:02] neither is there any rest in my bones
[1:30:04] because of my sin
[1:30:07] for my iniquities are gone over my head
[1:30:09] as heavy burdens
[1:30:11] they're too heavy for me this is david
[1:30:15] my wounds stink and cr and are corrupt
[1:30:18] because of my foolishness
[1:30:20] i'm troubled
[1:30:22] i am bowed down greatly i go down
[1:30:25] mourning all the day long
[1:30:27] for my loins are filled with lonesome
[1:30:30] disease and there is no soundness in my
[1:30:33] flesh
[1:30:34] i am feeble
[1:30:36] and sore bore and sore broken
[1:30:39] i have
[1:30:40] roared by reason of the disquietness of
[1:30:43] my heart
[1:30:45] lord
[1:30:46] all my desire
[1:30:49] is before thee
[1:30:51] and my groaning
[1:30:53] is not
[1:30:54] hid
[1:30:56] from thee
[1:30:59] all my desires
[1:31:01] all that i longed for
[1:31:04] you know i hope you don't mind if i
[1:31:06] quote songs or psalms or you know david
[1:31:08] when we see the songs
[1:31:10] all i want to see
[1:31:13] is jesus
[1:31:15] all i want to see is
[1:31:18] him in me
[1:31:20] so god sees
[1:31:23] my desire
[1:31:25] god sees
[1:31:27] my groaning and it's not hid from him
[1:31:30] it's not hid from him
[1:31:32] so
[1:31:34] he's a great god isn't he
[1:31:37] isn't he a great god
[1:31:39] how often did you hear that prophet say
[1:31:41] he said i saw you there he says and then
[1:31:44] brother brown break out of it that was
[1:31:45] not me that was him
[1:31:48] that was him whatever he said is that
[1:31:50] true
[1:31:51] he said i saw you i i saw you sitting by
[1:31:54] your bedside you were by your chair and
[1:31:57] you're praying
[1:31:58] god sees everything
[1:32:00] he just wants to interrupt us
[1:32:03] amen we just have to make ourselves
[1:32:05] interruptable
[1:32:09] you know we put up so many walls of
[1:32:11] facades and by the time we're finished
[1:32:14] we got a
[1:32:15] listen our fortresses are bigger than
[1:32:16] this room
[1:32:18] we built up this we built up that we
[1:32:20] built up this he wants to break it down
[1:32:22] tonight
[1:32:23] he wants to break it all down all our
[1:32:26] facades all our
[1:32:28] religiosity all our way he just wants us
[1:32:30] to be real people
[1:32:33] amen
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:41] so touching jesus
[1:32:44] really all that really matters isn't it
[1:32:47] jackson is not brother jackson is that
[1:32:48] all that really matters
[1:32:52] and then a prophet comes down and brings
[1:32:54] it so real that you don't even have to
[1:32:57] think about a jesus of 2000 years ago
[1:33:01] you had a prophet come on the scene and
[1:33:03] bring jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:33:06] today and forever a greater than solomon
[1:33:10] is here he was bringing us to the
[1:33:13] reality that he's not a god of the past
[1:33:15] he's a god of the presence and if you
[1:33:18] would just let yourself get interrupted
[1:33:20] he could change your life in a moment's
[1:33:22] time
[1:33:24] in a moment's time
[1:33:26] but we say we can't do that because the
[1:33:28] doctor said this can't do that because
[1:33:30] of this problem he can do anything
[1:33:33] he can take a woman at the well if he
[1:33:35] can take a mary magdalene if he can take
[1:33:37] a legion he can take you if he
[1:33:39] interrupted their lives he can interrupt
[1:33:41] your life he's the same god

[1:38:46] yep
[1:38:47] and a lot of interruptions
[1:38:50] especially this time this hour this day
[1:39:02] oh my goodness
[1:39:03] yeah the other day i picked up that
[1:39:05] thing i was ready to throw it half a
[1:39:06] mile that was a thousand dollar phone
[1:39:10] computer
[1:39:12] you know it's just when you want to pray
[1:39:16] uh-huh this is when you want to pray and
[1:39:18] then the devil plays your head how do
[1:39:20] you know that that's not a need that you
[1:39:21] got to be praying for
[1:39:23] and you find out it's an advertisement
[1:39:30] craziness
[1:39:32] like i need that
[1:39:34] but we get interrupted don't we
[1:39:37] sure we do
[1:39:41] then you don't answer and then you're in
[1:39:42] trouble
[1:39:45] really big need all of a sudden the
[1:39:46] brothers drive we've been trying to get
[1:39:48] ahold of you for five hours
[1:39:52] the bible says here in genesis 2 verse
[1:39:55] 9.
[1:39:59] genesis 2
[1:40:00] verse 9.
[1:40:03] well we can read verse 8 and the lord
[1:40:05] god planted the garden eastward in eden
[1:40:08] and there he put man
[1:40:10] whom he had formed and under the ground
[1:40:12] made the lord to grow every tree that is
[1:40:14] pleasant to the sight good for food the
[1:40:16] tree of life also in the midst of the
[1:40:18] garden the tree
[1:40:20] of knowledge of good and evil
[1:40:25] let's go to verse 16
[1:40:29] and the lord commanded the man
[1:40:33] saying of every tree of the garden
[1:40:36] thou mayest freely eat
[1:40:39] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:40:42] and evil
[1:40:43] thou shall not eat of it
[1:40:45] for in the day that thou eat is thereof
[1:40:49] thou shall surely die
[1:40:51] that's pretty easy command
[1:40:55] pretty easy
[1:40:56] not even ten commandment one commandment
[1:41:00] just one statement
[1:41:02] just one
[1:41:08] let's turn to
[1:41:10] oh you just flipped the page there to
[1:41:11] chapter three verse one
[1:41:17] so now between now
[1:41:19] what we just read to now god separated
[1:41:21] eve from adam so the commandment was eve
[1:41:24] in him
[1:41:26] come on eve in him
[1:41:30] she had a knowledge
[1:41:34] that was amazing
[1:41:36] because we're going to see a little
[1:41:37] something here
[1:41:40] and now the serpent was more subtle than
[1:41:42] any beast of the field and we've known
[1:41:44] and probably heard much on the fertility
[1:41:46] of satan
[1:41:49] mr the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:41:51] beast of the field which the lord god
[1:41:54] hath made and he said unto the woman yea
[1:41:56] hath god said you shall not eat of every
[1:41:58] tree
[1:41:59] of the garden
[1:42:01] and the woman said unto the serpent
[1:42:04] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:42:07] the garden
[1:42:08] verse 3
[1:42:10] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:42:12] the midst of the garden
[1:42:15] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:42:19] neither shall you what
[1:42:22] where did you where did the lord say
[1:42:24] that
[1:42:26] i want
[1:42:27] was somebody read that before did we
[1:42:29] miss that by reading
[1:42:36] how did she know that she was in adam
[1:42:40] and then adam he knew all things
[1:42:45] you hadn't read where it said that you
[1:42:47] she wasn't she wasn't to eat of it
[1:42:49] but she knew
[1:42:51] if she touched it
[1:42:53] it'd be trouble
[1:42:59] god said you shall not eat neither shall
[1:43:01] you what
[1:43:03] touch it
[1:43:05] lest ye die so there's certain kinds of
[1:43:08] touching
[1:43:11] i want you to take a special note that
[1:43:12] that word touch in the hebrew means the
[1:43:15] nega
[1:43:16] n-a-g-a
[1:43:18] don't touch the tree
[1:43:21] of good and evil now here we are in
[1:43:23] satan's eden
[1:43:28] well brother tom now where are you going
[1:43:30] with that let's just stick with the
[1:43:31] scripture now
[1:43:33] because if god wants to interrupt you
[1:43:35] i'll tell you there's a devil that wants
[1:43:37] to interrupt your life
[1:43:43] he'll want to interrupt you
[1:43:46] and he's now she is saying
[1:43:49] to touch to touch is to die you know why
[1:43:53] she mentions the word touch
[1:43:55] because if you look up the word the
[1:43:57] meaning touch
[1:43:59] it means to take sexual contact
[1:44:09] here she is knowing
[1:44:12] not just to eat of it even just to touch
[1:44:14] it
[1:44:19] and i could so quickly go to today and
[1:44:21] brother braham says in a church age book
[1:44:23] and he brings it down he says we're
[1:44:24] amongst two trees again today
[1:44:28] and i could say to you as eve knew don't
[1:44:31] even touch from the tree
[1:44:33] of good and evil
[1:44:35] don't touch it ah
[1:44:37] where did gaming come from
[1:44:39] tree of life
[1:44:41] where'd your music come from
[1:44:43] tree of life
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:46] where did the entertainment world come
[1:44:47] from
[1:44:48] tree of life no it came from the tree of
[1:44:52] good and evil
[1:44:54] and it has its sexual connotations
[1:44:58] once you touch it listen you can't game
[1:45:01] without rock and roll playing
[1:45:04] or strip down women in the game
[1:45:07] you might as well be honest
[1:45:09] we don't even have to play it which i
[1:45:11] never have i've just seen walking down
[1:45:13] the mall the advertisement on the silly
[1:45:15] windows
[1:45:16] and people say oh it's just a game no
[1:45:18] it's not a game it might have been you
[1:45:20] know x's and y's
[1:45:21] when i was learning a computer in the
[1:45:23] dark ages of the 80s
[1:45:27] and you had an arrow go up and you hit
[1:45:29] that thing going across and you thought
[1:45:34] now you're living it
[1:45:35] you're flying f-15s and
[1:45:40] boy we got quiet all of a sudden
[1:45:42] no god is trying to interrupt your life
[1:45:45] he's trying to get you away from the
[1:45:47] tree of good and evil
[1:45:50] and get you to the tree of life
[1:45:52] because touching him
[1:45:54] will change your life forever
[1:45:59] gaming will be silly
[1:46:02] it's absolutely ridiculous
[1:46:05] that grown men can spend hours
[1:46:09] one two come on i got didn't get an amen
[1:46:12] yet now
[1:46:14] come on come on he wants to interrupt
[1:46:16] your life get you away
[1:46:18] from the tree of good and evil
[1:46:21] come on
[1:46:22] and get you back to the tree of life
[1:46:25] because brother brahman said jesus sent
[1:46:27] his angels
[1:46:29] to run us back
[1:46:33] come on
[1:46:35] to the tree of life
[1:46:37] but everything you pick up now every
[1:46:40] phone you got everything you do is made
[1:46:43] from that tree and that tree's got
[1:46:45] sexual connotations
[1:46:49] and you need to conquer it
[1:46:52] and bring it subject to the holy ghost
[1:47:02] boy are you a holiness preacher
[1:47:05] yeah
[1:47:06] i guess so i hope so
[1:47:08] i hope so
[1:47:09] i don't preach for a favor
[1:47:12] i don't preach for
[1:47:14] you know pat on the back
[1:47:16] i know what i was
[1:47:18] and i know what happened when he
[1:47:19] interrupted me
[1:47:20] and i know what i am today and i don't
[1:47:22] want the garbage
[1:47:24] and so if jesus could just interrupt you
[1:47:26] one more time
[1:47:28] you could put that behind you and you
[1:47:30] can put the cross before you
[1:47:36] hallelujah
[1:47:38] interrupt us lord
[1:47:40] interrupt us
[1:47:42] yes sir they touched him the multitude
[1:47:45] touched him and everyone was healed i
[1:47:47] want every hole with my heart's desire
[1:47:49] when i prayed this afternoon and thought
[1:47:51] on this little subject as the lord was
[1:47:53] opening up lord would everyone leave
[1:47:56] here totally deliberate
[1:47:59] if you're here lord and they all
[1:48:00] gathered on the plane and they came from
[1:48:02] here and they came from north south east
[1:48:05] west and they just wanted to be with
[1:48:07] jesus and touch him
[1:48:10] and he healed them all
[1:48:12] healed them all
[1:48:14] the marvelous remarks and just healed
[1:48:16] them all can you imagine them going back
[1:48:19] to the hometown going back in the
[1:48:20] neighborhood

[1:52:53] crowd would have pushed her away but she
[1:52:55] humbled herself she came behind jesus

[1:53:36] the answer
[1:53:37] and i want to tell you tonight the great

[1:59:44] how much dental do i get
[1:59:47] how much medical do i get you always
[1:59:49] want to know the benefits
[1:59:51] and a lot of times you don't even take
[1:59:52] the job because the benefits aren't very
[1:59:54] good
[1:59:55] come on i'm trying to tell you the
[1:59:57] benefits of christ
[1:59:58] the benefits of christ are unbelievable
[2:00:02] he's a healer he's a savior he's a
[2:00:05] deliverer
[2:00:09] what a benefit
[2:00:10] package oh but i get 75 percent dental

[2:00:34] you sure don't want bags with holes in
[2:00:35] it do you
[2:00:36] make all you can and have nothing at the
[2:00:38] end of the day
[2:00:39] but watch watch how jesus adds to that
[2:00:42] little
[2:00:43] purse of that little cruise that never
[2:00:45] runs dry
[2:00:48] i love that
[2:00:49] because that's me
[2:00:50] my brother's made more money than i've
[2:00:52] ever dreamed of making
[2:00:54] oh now we're getting personal now and
[2:00:56] everybody gets quiet again
[2:01:00] but i just had a little cruise they
[2:01:01] served the lord
[2:01:02] and in serving god at the end of the day
[2:01:05] i my father owns a cattle on a thousand
[2:01:07] hills
[2:01:10] they said why why didn't we do what you
[2:01:12] did
[2:01:13] well it's a good question when you just
[2:01:14] get saved and find out
[2:01:18] they actually think it's in their
[2:01:19] smartness
[2:01:21] right their smartness makes them
[2:01:23] but their benefit package is rotten
[2:01:27] because when they're finished with their
[2:01:28] job there goes the benefits
[2:01:30] our benefits go from here and forever
[2:01:34] amen i get a total healing i get a new
[2:01:37] body i get a city

[2:01:45] nothing
[2:01:46] [Applause]
[2:01:47] you need to talk start talking about
[2:01:49] that future home and forget about this
[2:01:51] home
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:54] oh i got to get a bigger home i got to
[2:01:55] get bigger this guy got to have faster
[2:01:57] car i got to get this i got and when you
[2:01:58] get it what is it
[2:02:00] somebody drives up with a nicer car
[2:02:03] that's right
[2:02:04] that's right i was we were in victoria
[2:02:06] my wife and i one year and and we went
[2:02:08] down and go to the dock and always look
[2:02:09] at all these yachts you know all these
[2:02:10] yachts
[2:02:11] really there's no more sea over there
[2:02:14] come on i don't know what are they gonna
[2:02:15] do with the yachts there's no yachts
[2:02:16] over there the crazy guys they get these
[2:02:19] yachts
[2:02:21] worth millions of dollars right and the
[2:02:23] top dog he's always the guy on the top
[2:02:25] deck slipping his little drink
[2:02:30] but then a bigger boat comes
[2:02:33] man he evaporates
[2:02:37] he's down in the galley somewhere
[2:02:40] hiding because there's another bigger
[2:02:42] boat
[2:02:42] there's always going to be a bigger
[2:02:44] house bigger car bigger this
[2:02:46] but there's not going to be another city
[2:02:48] like our city
[2:02:50] hallelujah
[2:02:54] can you imagine
[2:02:56] come on i always call it a floating
[2:02:59] ice cream cone
[2:03:03] he said tom you are so weird
[2:03:06] the earth is the earth
[2:03:09] right
[2:03:10] everybody flown here
[2:03:12] you fly at what thirty five thousand
[2:03:14] feet
[2:03:14] that's only six miles up on the city
[2:03:17] wall
[2:03:20] you got another
[2:03:21] 1494 miles to go
[2:03:26] pyramid city round earth
[2:03:29] ice cream cone
[2:03:32] just remember
[2:03:34] and he's on top of the city
[2:03:37] the one that's interrupted us
[2:03:40] glory to be to jesus
[2:03:44] he's the lamb in that city where the
[2:03:46] lamb is the light
[2:03:49] he wants to go there with me
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:03:52] have you been that interrupted yes i've
[2:03:55] been that interrupted
[2:03:57] hallelujah
[2:03:59] so every time touching jesus is always
[2:04:02] to do with a beneficial effect
[2:04:05] but it's how you touch him
[2:04:07] a soldier can touch him and have no
[2:04:09] virtue
[2:04:10] but a believer touches him and there's a
[2:04:13] benefit
[2:04:14] amen
[2:04:16] vines explains it a different way when
[2:04:19] you touch him take a hold of him
[2:04:22] come on
[2:04:23] come on that's what i want you to do
[2:04:24] tonight
[2:04:25] not just touch him i want you to take a
[2:04:27] hold of him i won't let you go until you
[2:04:30] bless me come on jacob i won't let you
[2:04:33] go until you bless me i won't let that
[2:04:36] preacher stop preaching until he blesses
[2:04:39] me
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:43] hallelujah
[2:04:49] so vines in the greek then once you
[2:04:51] touch him hold on him
[2:04:53] don't let him go for nothing
[2:04:56] don't let no job make you let him go
[2:04:58] don't let no woman
[2:05:00] don't let no man
[2:05:02] no sir
[2:05:04] i want what jesus gives me
[2:05:06] amen
[2:05:08] well that's a whole nother service so
[2:05:09] i'll talk that on another time
[2:05:12] leave that one to the pastor
[2:05:18] it's your attitude
[2:05:23] it's just your attitude
[2:05:25] uh-huh
[2:05:26] it's your attitude
[2:05:28] how do you want to be touched
[2:05:31] how do you want to be interrupted
[2:05:33] huh
[2:05:35] how badly
[2:05:37] do you want him to interrupt you
[2:05:42] a woman she believed if she just touched
[2:05:44] the hem of his garment
[2:05:46] but the bram goes on to say she's healed
[2:05:52] she just touched him she was healed is
[2:05:54] that right
[2:05:55] it depends on what you think about it
[2:05:58] god sends it to you
[2:05:59] but it's your attitude
[2:06:01] towards a divine gift
[2:06:03] that'll determine what you get out of it
[2:06:10] how'd you come to church
[2:06:13] how did you come to church
[2:06:16] that's a great afternoon we had a great
[2:06:18] barbecue didn't we i'm not great

[2:06:29] i'll preach to him
[2:06:32] everybody else said will he be quiet
[2:06:34] please

[2:06:42] it's our attitude
[2:06:44] man i mean can you imagine
[2:06:47] you know if you're a group of young

[2:06:58] brother david would probably be dancing
[2:06:59] in the air
[2:07:01] everybody came busting through the doors
[2:07:03] with this great anticipation
[2:07:06] changes of preaching changes the
[2:07:08] atmosphere changes everything
[2:07:11] that's why special meetings are special
[2:07:13] and the only reason why they're special
[2:07:14] because you're special
[2:07:16] outside of that it's special meetings
[2:07:17] every week

[2:08:35] he sees your groaning
[2:08:37] he sees your desire
[2:08:39] he wants to interrupt you
[2:08:42] the bible says in isaiah 58
[2:08:44] and 11
[2:08:46] it says and the lord shall guide you
[2:08:48] continually
[2:08:50] the lord shall guide you continually

[2:09:00] it's a dry
[2:09:02] and thirsty land and i can barely make
[2:09:05] it
[2:09:07] really
[2:09:08] come on man
[2:09:10] there's a fountain been opened up in the
[2:09:11] house of david
[2:09:15] my bible says in the lord shall guide
[2:09:17] you continually
[2:09:20] continually and satisfy you in drought
[2:09:23] and in dry places
[2:09:24] and make strong
[2:09:27] your bones
[2:09:29] and you shall be like a watered garden
[2:09:32] and like a spring of water whose waters
[2:09:35] fail
[2:09:36] not
[2:09:37] i want to hear an amen
[2:09:40] amen why jesus interrupted me
[2:09:43] i was in dry places but there was a
[2:09:46] fountain opened up and that fountain now
[2:09:48] is in me and out of my belly flows what
[2:09:51] rivers
[2:09:52] of living water in the good times
[2:09:56] praise his name in the bad times just do
[2:09:59] the same
[2:10:00] these are the benefits
[2:10:03] [Applause]
[2:10:07] hallelujah
[2:10:09] hallelujah
[2:10:13] now
[2:10:15] ephesians church age brother brahma says
[2:10:17] in first takes first john 5 and 11 and
[2:10:20] says and this is the record that god has
[2:10:22] given to us eternal life
[2:10:24] and this life is in his son
[2:10:27] and thus the record
[2:10:29] god's word states plainly
[2:10:32] clearly that life eternal life is in the
[2:10:35] sun
[2:10:36] no other place
[2:10:37] first john 5 and 12 says he that hath
[2:10:40] the son has
[2:10:42] he that has a son is what
[2:10:44] he that has a son has life
[2:10:47] and he that hath not the son
[2:10:50] hath not life
[2:10:52] so now it's life and not life
[2:10:55] how do you know a tree is living
[2:10:58] if you have no leaves on the tree
[2:11:01] what do you say dead
[2:11:03] no fellowship dead
[2:11:05] no throat dead
[2:11:07] come on
[2:11:08] if you can tell a natural tree
[2:11:11] buy it
[2:11:12] by its status
[2:11:14] how about spiritual trees
[2:11:19] oh okay okay we'll leave that but now he
[2:11:21] that has the sun has life saying so the
[2:11:23] tree in the garden
[2:11:25] here's the prophet now saying the tree
[2:11:28] in the garden was jesus
[2:11:33] that's right
[2:11:34] life is in his
[2:11:36] son since this is so the tree in the
[2:11:40] garden
[2:11:41] has to be jesus
[2:11:44] all right then if the tree of life is a
[2:11:47] person
[2:11:49] come on the tree of knowledge of good
[2:11:52] and evil is a person all soul
[2:11:56] it can't be otherwise
[2:11:59] thus one righteous one thus a wicked one
[2:12:03] amen standing side by side
[2:12:07] so now we got the son of man
[2:12:09] versus the man of sin
[2:12:11] stay with me
[2:12:12] we got the son of man
[2:12:14] and now we've got the man of sin
[2:12:16] which tree do you want
[2:12:19] let's take the tree of life
[2:12:23] because we know who wins
[2:12:25] that's right
[2:12:27] devil know who wins
[2:12:29] so now it's the son of man versus the
[2:12:31] man of sin
[2:12:33] one's a tree of knowledge of good and
[2:12:34] evil one's a tree of life but the ram
[2:12:37] said they're two trees
[2:12:38] two persons thus one's the righteous one
[2:12:41] one's the wicked one they're standing
[2:12:43] side by side when in satan's eden
[2:12:46] once again we're back to eden
[2:12:50] but i'm not staying in satan's eden
[2:12:53] i'm being changed by the son of man
[2:12:55] himself
[2:12:57] to another beauty
[2:12:59] called eden beauty
[2:13:01] because i'm eating off the tree of
[2:13:04] life
[2:13:06] hallelujah
[2:13:08] yes sir
[2:13:10] amen
[2:13:12] so
[2:13:12] not only does mark
[2:13:15] take a record of this woman crying
[2:13:17] having a need to interrupting but
[2:13:20] matthew also describes it
[2:13:22] if i could but touch
[2:13:24] the hem of his garment
[2:13:27] so not only thus mark and matthew
[2:13:30] luke also has a look we read and mark
[2:13:32] also says
[2:13:33] if i could just touch his clothes
[2:13:37] who gave her that revelation
[2:13:40] close
[2:13:41] if i could just touch his clothes
[2:13:49] why
[2:13:50] where'd that inspiration come from
[2:13:54] where did your revelation come from
[2:13:57] who told you that malachi 4 was here
[2:13:59] who told you he was luke 17 30. who told
[2:14:02] you it was revelation 10 7 who told you
[2:14:05] revelation 10 5 who told you read

[2:14:10] 10 8
[2:14:11] who told you that
[2:14:12] where'd that come from
[2:14:14] where did peter get
[2:14:16] power to christ
[2:14:18] the son of the living god
[2:14:20] where'd that come from
[2:14:22] that came from the eternal realms of god
[2:14:26] [Applause]

[2:37:57] without god without
[2:37:59] the word without him
[2:38:01] but then jesus came
[2:38:04] then jesus came
[2:38:05] right and he interrupted us
[2:38:08] he interrupted us 12 years of loneliness
[2:38:12] 12 years of being ostracized
[2:38:16] unclean she had any place she had to go
[2:38:18] she had to say
[2:38:19] she had to say gregory i'm clean i'm
[2:38:21] unclean don't come near me i'm unclean
[2:38:24] 12 years
[2:38:26] ostracized
[2:38:28] and alone
[2:38:31] she had to have been a woman of wealth
[2:38:34] because the bible says 12 years she
[2:38:36] spent all she had
[2:38:38] and i you look it up you look it up

[2:39:01] them
[2:39:02] they won't touch them won't do nothing
[2:39:04] but then you come to the word himself
[2:39:07] amen you come to jesus christ the living
[2:39:09] word it changes your life forever
[2:39:14] she had to cry unclean for 12 years
[2:39:18] everything she touched was unclean
[2:39:22] everything she touched so when touching
[2:39:25] jesus
[2:39:26] theoretically
[2:39:28] would have made him unclean
[2:39:30] but you can never
[2:39:32] ever
[2:39:33] make the one that is clean
[2:39:36] unclean
[2:39:40] never
[2:39:41] he's the holy one
[2:39:43] the righteous one
[2:39:45] could never be unclean but she knew if
[2:39:48] she could touch him
[2:39:50] i would be clean
[2:39:52] [Applause]
[2:39:53] [Music]

[2:40:10] thank you brother j you're a good sport
[2:40:12] but can you imagine living and seeing
[2:40:14] all these people that you love
[2:40:17] and you can't go near them
[2:40:18] you can't be around them
[2:40:20] you can't fellowship with them you can
[2:40:22] have nothing to do with them and you had
[2:40:24] to say unclean and clean and clean
[2:40:27] but one day
[2:40:28] after 12 years for me 21 years for
[2:40:32] somebody else maybe 25 years jesus came
[2:40:37] and made
[2:40:40] oh
[2:40:41] [Music]
[2:40:44] everything we touched was unclean
[2:40:47] we touched
[2:40:49] from the tree
[2:40:51] of good and evil
[2:40:53] with its sexual connotations
[2:40:56] you go to a bus stop
[2:40:59] it's unclean
[2:41:01] you go to a mall
[2:41:03] the windows and the
[2:41:05] ads that come on
[2:41:06] come on
[2:41:08] what are they
[2:41:09] unclean you get on your internet and put

[2:51:04] something
[2:51:06] something happened
[2:51:09] and now
[2:51:11] i

[2:51:14] he touched me
[2:51:18] [Music]
[2:51:30] save yourselves
[2:51:32] [Music]
[2:51:49] is
[2:51:51] [Music]
[2:52:26] so
[2:52:32] now
[2:52:36] [Music]
[2:52:45] you know there is an evidence
[2:52:50] that followed
[2:52:52] [Music]
[2:52:53] those that have been touched
[2:52:59] and those that
[2:53:00] touched him
[2:53:02] and that evidence was
[2:53:05] that they should lay their hands on the
[2:53:06] sick yes
[2:53:10] [Music]
[2:53:11] you know we have people here
[2:53:15] that have been battling sickness
[2:53:18] you know it's one thing to
[2:53:21] come under conviction
[2:53:24] because you've been dabbling
[2:53:29] in the world
[2:53:31] but it's another thing to challenge the
[2:53:34] devil
[2:53:39] at the sickness
[2:53:42] you know we have someone tonight that
[2:53:49] asked me to
[2:53:50] pray because their mama sits in a
[2:53:53] wheelchair
[2:53:56] there's others that
[2:54:00] come up time and time again and pray
[2:54:02] because
[2:54:04] they want to see god
[2:54:08] i think it's time we challenge ourselves
[2:54:12] you know
[2:54:14] do you believe this man's got the holy
[2:54:16] ghost
[2:54:19] so we've been asked to go lay our hands
[2:54:21] on someone
[2:54:23] because they don't have no hope
[2:54:32] now what are you talking about
[2:54:38] a lot of difference
[2:54:41] in someone being delivered from
[2:54:43] something they shouldn't be in any way
[2:54:48] then believers
[2:54:52] that know that god
[2:54:54] and are clean
[2:54:56] and they'll go up to that person
[2:54:58] and say you know the doctors say you're
[2:55:00] dead
[2:55:03] but i've come yes
[2:55:06] testify there's life in the camp
[2:55:12] now we ain't playing no more
[2:55:14] right there's deliverance yes sir
[2:55:18] that's right
[2:55:20] you know we don't really know what god
[2:55:24] will do many times it won't do
[2:55:27] but i heard a gospel about standing for
[2:55:29] something yes sir yes sir so alls i know
[2:55:32] is i'm going to take this brethren and
[2:55:34] i'm going to go pray for somebody
[2:55:35] because they asked me to amen amen
[2:55:40] now what do you believe
[2:55:45] do you believe he's the same yesterday
[2:55:47] forever
[2:55:49] do you believe there's resurrection
[2:55:51] power in the camp
[2:55:55] do you believe he can heal yeah the
[2:55:58] liver
[2:56:08] you know i got somebody i love that
[2:56:11] i claim
[2:56:14] the doctors don't know what to do they
[2:56:16] look at her and
[2:56:18] nerves or whatever it is causes her pain
[2:56:22] basically they've said when you hurt
[2:56:24] stay home and when you don't do all you
[2:56:26] can
[2:56:28] how many's tired of that
