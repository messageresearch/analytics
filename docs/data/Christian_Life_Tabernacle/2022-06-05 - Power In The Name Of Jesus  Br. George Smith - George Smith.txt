Description:
Power In The Name Of Jesus
Br. George Smith
June 5, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

would bless it to each heart mage person that's present take a portion home help us lord as we get our hearts and minds ready for the communion service help us now we ask in jesus name amen amen you may be seated it's a privilege to be back and i don't take it lightly that the brother david would give me the privilege to speak to you again it's um it's a privilege tonight we're going to consider a small portion of the word that we've heard before i don't bring anything new we don't have any shortcuts we just have the word and so i want you to open your bibles to chapter two of the book of acts and we're gonna go over this again to see what we might have missed the first time because it's our church this is where it started we're part of that same crowd back there were in this century they were back there in the first century chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire and it sat upon each one of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now this is day 10 of their sojourning here in the upper room and the 120 that were there we're in prayer they're together they're in agreement they're seeking for the fulfillment of the promise of chapter 1 and verse 8. you shall be my witnesses it's going to go to all the world and so forth and it says noise from heaven filled the house tongues of fire appeared on each one and each one was filled with the holy ghost when christ gave him this promise go over there and stay until you have it he didn't give him a colorful picture now this and this and this and this is going to happen just wait you'll know when it happens you know and so the church of jesus christ was launched at jerusalem before that it was just jesus you know praying and and teaching but the church was launched at jerusalem that was the alpha church we are the omega church now this is uh basic and don't be thinking that you know it all just pay attention might be something you didn't know through seven ages two thousand years we've been restored back now to the original by a prophetic message straight from god according to the prophecy of malachi 4. and verse 5 from every nation now that's very interesting they were dwelling in jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven this bible is full of details all you got to do is read it carefully so god's timing is always perfect you don't have to worry he's always on time and i'm sure if we was to take the rest of the night we could start over here and go right through and have testimonies and how god has fulfilled his word and it was always on time so they were gathered in jerusalem from every nation under heaven for the feast of pentecost okay in scripture in leviticus 23 god dealing with the chosen people he instituted seven special feasts now that's not just a supper that's you know several days and um in these seven feasts or celebrations it was throughout the calendar year but on three of the of the seven occasions um all the believing men of the congregation in these countries were required to travel to jerusalem to the temple for this feast okay that was one of their things that they had to deal with exodus 23 14-19 feast of the harvest or the feast of pentecost was a celebration of six days okay so these people traveled they didn't have airplanes they didn't have mercedes they walked or they had animals so they get there in time for the six days and that's why all these people were gathered in jerusalem at that time okay it was exactly during this same week that the spirit descended on 120. so god had this arranged for that to coincide you see he there's no mistakes god isn't the kind like like uh you know brother david these people out here this pile of dirt well let's see if this works and let's try this no he knows exactly what's going to work you know he knows like the guys in the sound booth let's let's see if this works no god knows what he's doing so he's got all these people gathered in town got 120 you know they're up there hiding and when the holy ghost comes on them he allows them to start speaking in languages that all these people would understand look at verse six now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language now what you got to understand these people worship god in hebrew language the same hebrew language they're speaking today written and so forth so they had the language of the church which was hebrew and that was you know the same everywhere but then they were from these other countries and as you can see here at least 16 countries they spoke that language too and here's these hicks from galilee that's what they were they were just you know country people and they come out of there you know speaking in that other language not not the hebrew that everybody knew that wouldn't be a mystery but they're speaking the other language so these people are at least bilingual maybe three and they're speaking that language but in the accent of galilee so verse 8 let's say here how here we every man in our own tongue when we were born because they've been over there for years these these are people that know that language over there and so hey aren't these guys from galilee hicks unlearned you know there could be as many as 16 different languages this is exactly the opposite of what happened at the tower of babel in genesis 11 where there was confusion versus perfect understanding only god can do something like that i can't engineer that you know so while peter had their attention verse 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them now how do you think he did that he didn't have a microphone like this somehow god projected his voice to all those people we're talking thousands you know and they didn't have a nice building they're outside probably uh and he said to them ye man of judea and all you that dwell at jerusalem be it known this day unto you and hearken to my words and he launches into his first sermon could have been 30 minutes i don't know he ends up over here in verse 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly you know without a doubt that god hath made that same jesus whom you guys crucified he made him both lord and christ okay he was led entirely by the holy spirit to speak what he spoke he did not beat them into submission as we've you know seen in other meetings he simply was faithful to the truth that they had just experienced for three and a half years and now the master's gone and never been up there for ten days and boom it happens you know he did not call for an immediate response but verse 37 of chapter two now when these people heard this they were pricked in their heart they were disturbed and they said to peter and the other apostles men and brethren what shall we do in other words we we know what you said is true we believe what you said now how can we be a part of this great revelation that god has given you what can we do about this and that's when he offered them the eternal prescription verse 38. now this isn't years later this is just a few days after jesus spoke to him in matthew 28 19. i want you all to go out there make disciples baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost in red letters a few days later first chance he's got before the public peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and what you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you to your children and those and those and those as many as the lord our god shall call this does not subtract or contradict from the commission of a few days before rather it's a fulfillment or manifestation the revelation of the spoken word fair enough so in verse 41 the small band then they they gladly received his word were baptized in the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls now when i get to heaven look for me i'll be there i'll probably look a little different see today me and the pastor and the songwriter all have the same haircut but it's going to be different over there and so um one of my first questions i want to find peter peter come here where did you baptize 3 000 people there's no river and there's no lake so explain that to me but that'll probably be out of my memory by then so here we have three 000 souls added at the first gospel meeting because god was in charge it's a very simple formula ministry speaks god does the work see i might see something here that's so real to me i can only speak it god has put it in your heart billy graham said i have found that when the gospel of jesus christ is presented with authority quoting from the very word of god he then takes that message and drives it supernaturally into the human heart brother branham says preaching is god's program like we said this morning so we preach honestly god does the work in the human heart so you might not be gifted like peter and these people you know you might not have that kind of gift but your life is preaching every waking moment you are a witness you ladies with your dress and your hair you don't have to blah blah blah just walk through walmart you're preaching those that make fun of you they might not go so well those that say god bless you they received it you know so um from verse 42 through 45 there was a unity of purpose and fellowship uh that was god's program at that point some have tried that same program today and our prophet said it won't work so this idea of controlling a group of people and let's see let's all eat beef today and that's all you chicken tomorrow and no that doesn't work we're individuals you know and so they had things in common and verse 46 they went to church every day and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart okay so they were meeting daily in each other's homes holy ghost fellowship they ate together they remembered the lord now you search and see if you can find it but nowhere in the bible does does it say remember my birth you know christmas and all that no uh luke 22 i believe it is at the last supper and do this in remembrance of me they were remembering his death you see and they were actually having communion every day as often as you do this so forth and that's what we're going to get into in here a little bit in verse 47 and the lord added to the church daily he's always in charge we are only instruments okay ready and willing to be used now instruments you know they have to take a break sometimes sometimes brother david needs to go fishing sometimes i need to go someplace but we're servants brother brahm says i'm just a public servant of god to you the preacher is a public servant we're here to serve now we've got limits of our patience you know but we do try to be nice so we are not managers of god's people the purchase of calvary we're only following these new testament examples because we are bible believers and we've been turned back to the original okay now we're going to look quickly at chapters three and four because this is a six part drama which could be called power in the name of jesus which is jehovah is salvation in act 1 uh chapter 3 verses 1-11 it records the healing of the lame man at the gate beautiful okay this is the golden gate now in jerusalem today there's eight gates into the city that's all there was until 1886 when they started to people started living outside the city and so today it's a city of 900 000 people you know altogether but back then it was walled city and today that eastern gate number eight is sealed because in 1541 there was an effort by the non-jews at the time to prevent that messiah from coming into the eastern gate as scripture declares well jesus doesn't need an open gate to get into right okay you remember this morning we had that we had the level over here i'm watching and so this man was sitting at the gate begging for money and peter and john were going up to the temple at the appointed time the ninth hour which would be about 3 p.m in verse 2 of chapter 3 and a certain man lame from his mother's womb so he never has walked he is totally incapacitated can't even use a wheelchair no he's they have to carry him they laid him daily at the gate asking for money those that entered and when he saw peter and john about to go in just like everybody else going by he asked for alms and peter fastening his eyes on him very certain sternly look on us and he gave heed okay because he's down here begging okay snooner looks at him and um expecting to receive something of them and what peter say look son silver and gold we don't have we're just poor preachers but what we do have we will give you in the name of jesus of nazareth rise and walk and so the fact is that this man had never walked this is a total miracle amen and um and it draws attention and he took him by the right hand so he didn't just stand there and get up and walk no he reached for him get up and walk and um he lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength now if any of you been in the hospital for a couple weeks you know they gotta perform therapy and get you about walking again it gets you breathing right and all that well he's never walked he's never used any muscles and immediately he's he's ready that's a miracle and so he's we he's a walking leaping praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god because they've been seen him there for years and they knew that it was he which had been begging for money uh they were filled with wonder and amazement at the thing which had happened and to him so they're very amazed wow what about this you know and so um that's act one act two remember there's how many people tell you five acts now there's six parts to the drama so act two is verse 11. they're greatly wondering so when peter saw that he had their full attention he preached sermon number two and this is just an open street meeting there they've already been into the temple now they're out here you know they're worshiping god and act three is peter's sermon where he identifies jesus as the i am of israel's history he ties it into the see they didn't have a new testament they were they was barely acting it out they had a bible that was a translation 200 years old done in alexandria it was a more friendly uh user-friendly version of scripture in hebrew and so that's what they knew and he's saying hey this is you know this has happened here's the i am this is the christ of i am of history verses 12 through 26. his title could have been covenants will be fulfilled because over in chapter 3 uh verse 12 let's see what we've got here verse 12 and when peter saw it he answered the people you men of israel why marvel yet this you know this man's walking or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power holiness we'd made this man walk the god of abraham and isaac and jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up see he never missed a beat you guys are the ones that did it i'm going to remind you every chance i get because y'all did it you all delivered him up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but you denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted into you so he he was very smart in how he's doing it and you killed the prince of peace whom god hath raised from the dead where we are witnesses and this same in in his name uh through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know gave the faith which is by him hath given him his perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren i that's a old english word it means i'm sure i walked i am sure that through ignorance you did it as did also your rulers but those things which god hath but those things which god before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath also he had so fulfilled so that would have been his sermon you know act three and that shows that he goes on to show that there's hope for us in the 21st century he says repent therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times are refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he that's god shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you it was just here a few months ago whom the heaven must receive in spanish it says whom he must keep back until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so we're in the age of restoration we're in the time when all this is being done this restoration is being put together and jesus is coming back it's right there in plain language you know so there is hope for us over here and um when we can repent and get in tune get in balance with god's program you see focus on the larger picture until the time of restitution respond restored back to a former state like you that like to restore cars and furniture you're getting it back everything's going to be just just so that's the way god's restoring his bride it's got to be perfect you young young guys that are looking for a bride you're not looking for somebody missing a hand you want you know 100 well that's what god wants he wants 100 bride so um verse 24 of chapter 3 yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these very days you are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god hath made our fathers saying unto abraham and in nice in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed amen unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you jews israel in turning away every one of you from his iniquities so god is in control of all the activities he's got the whole map already laid out you see and so all we got to do is pay attention and get in step i was in the military if you're not in step they're going to throw you out they're going to make you do something else but you got to get in step you see so act four is chapter 4 1-4 and as he spake unto the people the priests and the captains of the temple which knew their bible should have been happy to see a fulfillment and a blossoming out of scriptures no they came upon them they're upset they're being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead see they couldn't handle that resurrection business that's the cornerstone of our whole message it's the resurrection you know and so and they laid hands on them and put them in the prison until the next day because it was already you know sundown how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand so we had three thousand over here now we've got another five thousand without a microphone god is doing things the church is you know taking no evangelists spend the first night in jail for preaching the truth amazing to a very large crowd verse five and it came to pass on the moral that the rulers and elders and scribes and announced the high priest and all these guys many of us were kindred and so forth they got their whole excuse me the whole council together and when they had set them and brought the prisoners in they asked by what power or by what name have you done this how did you guys do this magic trick how did this happen you know we got to know and um so in his defense peter goes through the whole deal we're starting at verse 9. if we this day are examined of the good deed done to the impotent man or by what means he's made whole be it known unto you all and all the people of israel that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you all crucified here it is again whom god raised from the dead thank you lord even by him does this man stand before you whole so he wasn't promoting himself yeah i'm peter i'm the one with the keys and yeah i did this and bless god and i need your money no that's foolishness dallas is full of it yeah it goes worldwide no jesus is the one that did this and this is the stone which has said it not by you builders which has become now the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there's no other name given under heaven by which men whereby they must be saved so god is definitely in control there's no other name never in the name of peter the name of william branham thank you i got people relatives that are in that mess yeah it's in the name of jesus christ everything else is false galatians 1 8 is still the truth if you don't preach what paul preached you're going to hell it's that simple so act 5 is verses 13 through 22 peter and john they're warned they've been released and um they um yeah they were they spent the night in jail and so um they they preached to him again repent their form be converted and um yeah we're in chapter four i'm sorry verse 13 and um they when they saw the boldness of peter and john these are fishermen they knew how to fish how to clean fish how to cook fish how to sell fish they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant but they marveled and they acknowledged that they had been with jesus i hope that every one of us this week will affect somebody out there yeah you're weird but we know you've been with jesus not that you've been with david mcgary no you've been with jesus that's what it was see that's their testimony okay and um so they saw the man that was healed and um so he says in verse 19 whether it be right in the sight of god hearken unto you more than god judge ye we can only speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for which was done so they were scared the leaders were scared of the people they were all on peter's side yeah we saw this we're we're glorifying god for the man was above 40 years old he'd been 40 years being carried every day there asking for money and now he's up jumping around praising god well yeah it's going to attract attention so they were released and acts 6 finishing up here verses 23 through 30 and being let go they went on their they went back to you know the group of believers and reported all that the chief priest and elders had said and when they heard all this they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hath made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them who by the mouth of thy servant david has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up in the rulers and so forth forever truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou has anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined so they knew about predestination whatever happened to jesus well it's we're not going to jump in there and try to kill pilate now all this is ordained it all turned out you just had to wait you see and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that they may have boldness to speak thy word by the stretching forth of thy hand to heal that signs and wonders may be done in the name of thy holy child jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled and they were all filled the holy ghost and they speak the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one soul neither did any man you know have things that possessed to him they had all things in common and great power and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection and so forth so they had this testimony service they had prayer god responded with an earthquake and refilling of the holy ghost and they shared things joyfully you know yeah and they had things in common but this was due to the persecution it was voluntary and it was only in jerusalem so quoting again from this morning as moses went with the judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is jesus christ if the egyptians could have ever got that little simple stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can ever get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he's got the church whipped and there's people in pullman pulpits tonight removing the deity out of jesus christ putting it over here over there and over there and these people are without any power because you take the deity out of the name of jesus christ you got nothing so paul wrote in his letter to the saints in philippi in chapter 2 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth things under the earth that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord that's not just the protestants that's the catholics and all the muslims and all the buddhists one day they're all going to know that we've been preaching the truth so may god bless you for the david [Applause] amen the brothers would go prepare the communion tonight you know it's certainly a great ally you have in the lord you know an ally is somebody who joins with you across our uh world countries will get together and they'll claim that uh they're our ally and uh we have an ally in the lord the one that'll fight our battles for us one that'll guide us direct us you know he he's there for us in and he's there to do for us exceedingly and abundantly even above what we can ask or think and you know it's amazing when we take things out of his hands we've really limited what can take place to our own possibilities and it really it hasn't even entered into our hearts the things that god's prepared for them that love them so way beyond anything that you could even anticipate or expect he can do it better hey man you might i've i've drawn out some pretty good plans for the lord you know and i think we just get in line and follow my plans everything would come out just perfect for me and not one of my plans has ever worked and of course you want people want to blame him you know you know like he said if we would follow it would be a lot easy you know and if we let the word of god speak to us so let stan we're going to have communion and tonight and we're going to turn over into matthew the 26th chapter of the book of matthew and we're going to start a reading here and and you know how brother george likes to go through and explain a drama well they're all here having the paths over and there's somebody at the table is going to betray him and the lord says somebody here is going to betray me tonight and you know the story and their sorrow of their heart and they're all wondering if it's them and they're having this me on them and it says in the 21st verse then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i and he said unto him thou hath said it and judas takes off and now here jesus takes to his disciples and here we institute communion and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood in the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i sand you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it anew with you in my father's kingdom now just think of that verse just for a second how many people don't take communion and yet he says i'm going to drink this with you you drink it here with me i'll drink it with you there you know without communion and foot washing you won't be there it it it's it's just what he said i didn't make that up i'm not enforcing that i don't enforce it but i simply have to say this is one of the things that god commands you to do and if the benefits of it are are are immense amen it's a time to examine yourself it's a time to make things right if there's a time to commit in your heart that if you have that thing that is going on that you're going to make a commitment in your heart you're going to handle it and then he says if you make that commitment you make that vow i'm going to take care of this i'm going to get this right i'm going to go make that right then you can come freely too and that's what communion is as a place for us to examine ourselves it's a place for us to pray one for another it's a communion with him and with one another to communicate to commune to share so you pray for one you pray for the other and it's it's a a wonderful time at this time so that is as we ask the bless the bread us all bow our heads together as we ask the lord to bless us our gracious heavenly father lord we have here the representation of your word the bread of life father that you passed out in remembrance of the great purchase price that you paid for each of our souls our redemption lord that this is meat indeed and life indeed your word it's the light of men it's the hope of life it's it's the bringing us back to our eternal restoration and place that we belong in you we're grateful for this time father to remember that what it was that you sacrificed for us the power that was in the sacrifice by your stripes father we're healed lord so we ask you to bless this communion to us this remembrance to each of our hearts that we're not living for this world we're not looking to be successful in this world we're not looking to stay but we're looking to leave america and father we come into communion with you that you would speak to our hearts and that you have convicted us by your spirits that you would take us away from the things that would hinder us from growing in you and that your light might shine even amongst all that we know that our good works might glorify the father which is in heaven we ask you to bless this communion to us and father the little cups that represent the wine father the stimulation of revelation the life that was in the blood that life returning back upon the believer that by that life they can live and they can overcome that they can express you father and express the benefits and the attributes that you want to share father may we be the vehicles of your expression father amy the candle set up on the hill may we give out the light of the gospel father that others might see that they have hope that it can rise up from the darkest places that can come out of the worst sicknesses they can come out of the deepest depressions mother all things are possible through christ jesus who strengthens us father we ask you to bless this believing to us tonight in jesus precious and holy
