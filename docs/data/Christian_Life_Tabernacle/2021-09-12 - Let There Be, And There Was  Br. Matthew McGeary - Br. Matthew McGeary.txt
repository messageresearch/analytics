it comes why don't we just lift our hands to him heavenly father we love you we thank you lord for your grace and your mercy and we're so thankful lord that we're not dependent upon the weather we're not dependent upon situation trials or tribulations to think that that would affect your outlook towards your brine for lord even though the trials come and the storm might be settling in there's something in us lord that is a sick fence called faith that looks beyond all the looming clouds and the troubled seas of life and we can see the very end lord to know that we're going to spend eternity with you lord and we know that this light affliction on this side lord oh it can't be compared to the glory that you're going to reveal in us oh god father we just trust that this would be another step in that direction tonight you would just come lord and break the bread of life as only you can and speak to your sheep lord to your bride we just love you lord we ask that you'd come now and have preeminence and this service lord for your glory we pray in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord amen if you have your bibles you'll turn with me to genesis and as you're doing that we we uh we're just happy to be with you tonight and we've just been on the road the last couple weeks few weeks traveling and so we just we want to bring you uh greetings from brother ben pruitt uh there and hardy arkansas him and the saints and their greetings and and also brother wendell martin and the assembly there and and pawnee oklahoma send their love and greetings to you and then also of course brother tim pruitt and the saints there evening like tabernacle in louisiana also bring their greetings so we just uh want to bring their love and support to you they're they're our brothers and sisters in christ and i'm i'm thankful that we're not the only flock but we have brothers and sisters all over the world that are fighting and standing for this message with all that's in them amen so we'll just be reading out of genesis chapter one says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light amen you may have your seats also we want to read out of john chapter nine just have a little fellowship with you tonight we won't be long and how many is thankful to have another opportunity to come into the house of god amen praise the lord well if you come expecting expect that your expectations are exceeded if you've come expecting not to get much you're not going to get much but i'm thankful god is not limited by man and man's ability uh because certainly there's nothing in myself that i could do for you that would would uh cause the perfection that god is calling in your life uh but if we're we're looking past the veil and we're looking to the unseen then we know that god can do something for you amen just reading now out of john 9 and we'll just read verse 1 through 5. it says and jesus passed by and saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and jesus answered and said neither had this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him so i want you to focus on that that there here's this man that's in a condition he's born blind and here the disciples are asking jesus why is he in this condition what what caused that was it his own sin or was it his parent's sin but i love the response here by the lord he says that neither hath this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world and also let's just read out of first john 1 5. after reading these portions of scriptures i believe we all can say it was good when they said unto me let's go to the house of the lord first john 1 we'll read verse 5 through seven it says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen now i want to just read this quote to you just to maybe lay a little foundation to where we uh pray that the lord will take us tonight uh the prophet of god is uh this is out of the countdown message he's going to be referring to hebrews 11 3 which says through faith we understand that the word worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things that which do appear and he says you know with all the things did you hear what the scripture said the things that are we see were made of things that was not because it was the word of god who spoke things into existence the world that we are sitting upon today the chairs that we're sitting in the floor that's beneath us the dirt the trees everything is nothing but the interpretation of the word of god when god interprets it when it happens that reveals it let there be and there was let there be and there was and maybe that would be the thought that i want to speak along to you tonight is let there be and there was we know in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and we know that he created the heavens and the earth by the spoken word and and and if you could just maybe see as this uh would maybe unfold their their god is elohim the self-existing one and and there that logos is and from that god is going to say let there be and maybe my if we were there with with him in the beginning and we were standing there and and maybe uh god would say let there be stars and maybe there would be this uh a wonder my the lord has spoken let there be stars and and maybe we might wonder amongst ourselves well what would that look like what would that be but all of a sudden there came stars into existence and we would be able to say oh that's what the father intended when he said let there be stars and there are stars and he said let there be moons and there was moons and and out of out of that very mind of god out of the very thoughts of god this these very thoughts that he had to himself and now he's speaking the word and saying let there be and he said let there be and there was let there be a moon and there was let there be an earth and let there be planets but i thought about these things and and here he said let there be an earth and there was an earth but you know the earth was just maybe this peculiar thing in all of the galaxies because he said let let there be an earth but yet in this creation of earth it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth but it says the earth was without form and it was void am i just thinking of creation let there be my let there be galaxies and let there be stars can can you just think that god's creation stretches from eternity to eternity try to even start in your mind to just just try to to to grasp the creation of god i mean in into and to think that here god is a uh has stretched the heavens he's spoken every star into existence and then tried to compare that to man's efforts just think of a man even trying to count the stars think of man even trying to name the stars oh oh man could could live forever and he would never be able to even exhaust or to name the stars oh my that's what about the droplets in the ocean and every cloud and every blade of grass and every piece of said oh to even to even try to even start to comprehend the mind of god oh his ways are past finding out even that would exhaust all of man's efforts and i'm reminded of the story there that that's told of an old tale about how man had come so far and and you know they they had started to invent things and they had started to to to tap into technologies and electricity and you know they started to go to space and all of these things and you know man just finally told god you know what we got it we we can handle it from here we're pretty good on our own they said you know what we're just getting along just fine i mean we can clone humans we can we can we can clone animals we we're we're pretty much creators ourselves we can do whatever we want you know this little joke goes as it was and god said to the man he said well okay well why don't we just why don't we why don't we just put that to the test why don't why don't we see who can create a man and a scientist they say well this is no problem we we've already done this we we we we can do that we've done this several times and so the showdown went to happen and and god went to get some dirt and the scientists went to get some dirt and god looked at him said no wait a second get your own dirt oh see everything that man has been able to accomplish oh it's only because they are part of this very creation that god has created and i i looked at this quote i thought it was very interesting of this astronomer american astronomer named carl sagan he said to really make an apple pie from scratch you must begin by inventing the universe i thought well that's very well said my what is what is man david would say it like this he would say when i consider the heavens psalms 8 verse 3 and 4 the works of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him oh i just say just look around you want to see god look he's made visible you can see the unseen by the the things that are visible around us you want to see god look at the moon look at the stars look at the very blades of grass that you would you would pass over every single day why it's all his handiwork it's all the very uh imprint of god it's all of all of his creation that if we would just take a little bit of a moment i know we live in the city and it's loud and it's noisy and there's skyscrapers everywhere but uh every once in a while let me just take a little step back and look up sometimes when the the sky is full of clouds and i don't know sometimes i feel like a little a kid gazing up there and just these huge just white billowing uh just white as snow clouds just just hanging up there in my they just oh oh it just looks so wonderful and you can just look up there and say my goodness god is so awesome such a creator but we see what man has done by tapping into the tree of knowledge he's caused destruction and death and and he's covered up god's creation with concrete and he stripped all the minerals out of it and and all the earth is coming into a place of birth pains and the prophet of god said it can't take another one where we're at the very final climax that the next one i'll tell you this this is going to be rent it's going to be purged by fire uh the whole world is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god and we're right here at that climactic point that any moment that that it's going to burst forth and come into a new creation and we're going to be taken out of here and the prophet of god would say this out of there is a man here that could turn out the light which pulling our inspiration from he says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth it might have been a hundred million or billion or whatever it was and how he done it that's up to him to know see not to me but the world well the earth was without form and void and the water was upon the earth and god said moved upon the water and said let there be light now i believe that the sun watch this now now i believe that the sun and so forth was already in existence i believe the moon as it goes on genesis 3 explained but i believe that there here the world was that he was going to use and therefore it it it moved in and there was a fog and a mist all over the earth making it dark and god said let there be light and the darkness faded away and there was a cloudless sky and i believe that's god's way of doing things in the bible the next verse says the fourth verse says and he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day and the darkness he called night and god's word always separates light from darkness see it's the word that does the separating light from darkness so notice that point that he's making there that the earth the sun the moon the stars they were all in existence but we find out here the earth is sitting there and it's it it's without form and it's void and i just want to maybe take some time here and just that word form and void it actually means confusion it means emptiness it means a wasteland or a wilderness it actually means a place of chaos so there was a fog and a mist all over the earth making it dark and when god said let there be light that darkness it faded away but what i want to in taking this time to lay a little foundation here is we want to be able to see a type here that's laying in the scripture where we can actually see the condition of the age we could actually see the condition of an individual or a seed and we could also see the condition of a situation so we can actually see the condition of the age chaos darkness a fog obscurity and then maybe that seed laying there in the earth as as being a son or daughter of god there being this darkness and this fog over their life in a condition that it cannot manifest what it is and then maybe we can move along in our thinking and maybe think about a trial or a test or something you're believing for and it just seems like uh you don't know how it's ever gonna happen or how it's ever gonna be fulfilled and in your mind you're getting weary and you're believing and you feel like time is moving on and and oh it just maybe seems like there's this fog or this uncertainty that is surrounding your your situation but god's word always separates the light from the darkness it's the word that does the separating and i just want to say that the condition is for a purpose well if you can take any strength or any encouragement tonight to know that wherever you're at in life good or bad i want to tell you that the condition is for a purpose go ahead and i don't care what it is you feel like your life is in shambles and you feel like you should never be where you are well maybe that could be true maybe you have ended up in a condition and maybe you made a lot of bad decisions and maybe maybe you ran right through all of the doors that god was putting in your way and he put roadblock after roadblock after roadblock and now you find yourself in a position now where you're actually suffering the consequences of being a disobedient child what i love about god is he says there in romans 8 28 he would say all things work out together to the good for those who are who who love him and are called according to his purpose oh that could give the seed on the inside a true child of god some confidence to know that those i love i rebuke and i chasten but if i can just surrender myself now to your god and know that i've done a lot of things that i shouldn't have done and i realize that i'm suffering some of the consequences of not being obedient to your word but lord god you said that everything works out to the good for those who love you and are called according to your purpose and as paul would go on to say in that very scripture you say what can we say to these things then oh hallelujah the devil wants to try to run you down he wants to try to make you feel like you're insignificant he wants to keep pointing back to your past and your failures and how many times you've tried and you've fallen but oh if we can only say like paul said oh if god before us who could be against us that's what we should say to these things when the devil tries to buff at you and your situation looks dark or you're looking at the condition of the age and it just seems like darkness is all around oh if god before you who can be against you i want you to be encouraged that the condition is for a purpose there is a reason for it and as we just read in our text there in the opening about john 9 what a a wonderful place in the scripture about this man who was born blind even there as this chapter would open up and the disciples would say to jesus they would say what caused this man to be blind was it the sin of his parents or was it his own sin you can even see in the question that these disciples who are following after the lord they're actually wondering in the self showing that this the very condition of this man there's this obscurity or this darkness or this wondering of why would he be in such a condition why would he be this way and i want you to tell you that just as the earth there was this darkness or this was there was this obscurity upon the earth you know many times we find ourselves in situations where we don't know which way to go and i want to maybe encourage you tonight because maybe maybe you're watching your child maybe you're watching your child and the decisions she's making and you're starting to wonder you know why it just seems like like uh where they're at in their life and the decisions that they're making it just it just seems like there's this uncertainty and there's this fog around them and what what are the consequences gonna be what is going to happen and maybe in your in your heart you you're being broken because it seems like they're making decisions and you don't want them to go that way and you you've done your best to instruct and to teach and and with everything in your heart you've been praying and believing and and you just maybe see this this situation and this this fog and maybe this obscurity are surrounding to them and it seems like oh it doesn't seem like which way are they gonna go and you're praying and believing and or maybe you're a young person and you find yourself and and you're now just coming of age and and you're coming to where you're making decisions and you're and you have interest and you have desires and and maybe there's a young person you're interested in or or maybe now you're you're a young man or a young woman and you you have a career and there's decisions that you need to make and there's all of these things that are pulling on you all of these decisions and and all of these distractions and you hear the word saying one thing but you you feel the world pulling this way and and maybe you're in a little uh obscurity and it doesn't have to be sin it doesn't have to maybe be darkness in a way uh that you're living in sin but it could be this just uncertainty and you're wondering which way to go lord where should i live what direction should i go and maybe you feel this just uneasiness and and you're calling out to god and you say lord i need your leadership right now in my life i i don't understand i need to make these decisions should i take this job should i should i move over there lord but it seems like it's taken me out of fellowship and you want to be led i want to encourage you tonight that that condition that situation that you are facing is that the works of god might be made manifest in your life that is the purpose of the condition oh for the believing parent i want you to know maybe you look out and i don't care if it's been one month or it's been five years and you see a fog or you see a darkness that's been setting over your child i want you to know that that purpose that condition is for a purpose because as a believing mother and as a believing father that the works of god might be manifested and that child because you have enough faith for salvation you can have enough faith for your children and now that condition is only persisting that the very word of god the very works of god could be made manifest in your child's life and i say you're coming to a place of maturity where the word is coming to perfection in you because now you are the light of the world and as that word is now taking on flesh you have a right by the scripture to speak the word and say let it be let it be all you might as well get the water and the baptism already because the word is speaking go on and speak deliverance for your children go on and speak healing for your body go on and say let it be because it's not you speaking it's god speaking that's what the message has brought in this end time is a union between god and man once again and we've seen one that come to that maturity that could stand there and speak the word and watch that spoken word materialize right before your eyes and i say god that's going to bribe in this end time to take the word and be able to speak it and watch it materialize [Music] oh we're going back to eden saints this is redemption this is the fullness of redemption oh the very things that are unseen are now being made visible amongst you oh the condition is for a purpose you might not be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel but by faith oh praise god for faith brother billy praise god for faith that can call things that are not as though they are well i think what we ought to do is we ought to start practicing brother moses we ought to start calling things that are not as though they are that's not a scripture laying there just to be glossed over but that's a scripture for the elect in the end time to take that word into their bosom and under the anointing of the holy ghost to take the word of speak speak the word speak and go forward watch that mountain move oh hallelujah matthew 21 would say if you say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done oh my glory to god you know the denominationals pick that up and they use that as just a wonderful figure of speech and certainly oh it can be preached that way and there's nothing wrong with that maybe i might just do that for a moment whatever your mountain is well what is your mountain is it school is it finances is it your marriage is it an education i don't know what your mountain is we can look at that figuratively and it's very applicable but that was not the intention of that scripture to be just left as a figurative example because god always reveals his word by bringing it to pass if you say to this mountain to be plucked up and placed over into the sea god didn't leave that scripture dormant but he actually brought one in the end time who could take that very word and would be facing a storm up on the mountain that was certain death and he would turn around to go down to low ground because that's where safety was that's where life was that was the way to get away from the storm because to stay up on the mountain would be certain death but there was a voice that spoke to him and said turn around and that prophet had been trained he had been tested he had been tried to know that even in the face of death no matter what it is you be obedient to the word of god that's speaking to you you might lose your family you might lose your friends you might lose your job you might lose your car you might lose your health you might lose your life but if god is speaking to you oh to be obedient to that word what profitable man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul and he returns and now he's going to walk right in to the face of that storm now he's there and and he's waiting what to do next he's been obedient and and now the storm is ripping through there and the trees all the tops are about to come off of him and he says i am the god that created the heavens and the earth oh lord is that you is that you that's speaking to me oh what would you have me to do i have created the heavens and the earth i am the voice that calmed the waters i'm the one that stealed the troubled sea you speak to the storm whatever you say it'll be just the way that you say oh hallelujah what was god doing he was now taking a word that had been spoken and laying in the bible but now a mature son that had been predestinated in the end time to pick up that word and come into his position as a son of god and he would be able to speak the word and say let it be let it be let that storm dry up and go this way let the sun shine for four days let it go back let it be and it was why because now there was a son of god standing on the earth again holding the title book deed of redemption fullness of redemption all that adam had lost have been given back man had dominion over the earth again oh let it be and it was god is calling you to this type of maturity he's calling you to this type of perfection oh the scripture would say greater is he that is in you why don't you say it with me greater is he that is in you greater is he that is in you well who is the he the word is talking about greater is he he ain't talking about your mama he ain't talking about your daddy he ain't talking about your brother he ain't talking about your sister greater is he the creator of heavens and earth the same god that was with noah the same god that was with moses the same god that dropped down like a pillar of fire and come upon the word made flesh oh the same god that was with brother branham it's the same god that is in you oh if thou canst believe all things are possible greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh what can the church of god do when they get ahold of that revelation when you realize that elohim god has called you and spoke in his word that a very portion of his zoe life would be in you greater is he that isn't you oh friends who isn't living then it is not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me oh get our ways off the ways of flesh get our ways off the ways of man it's the very word that's calling you to maturity the very word that's calling you to perfection oh hallelujah jeremiah would say it like this in 11 he was sorry for i know my thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end oh you know you're the thoughts of god prophet would say it like this that of god is his own interpreter what i mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you christians here he christians were his thoughts before there was a world and now remember you christians where his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking oh i like that you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in christ amen and god in the beginning that makes you then you see his subject and the whole thing watch this now the whole thing the prophet just boiled this all down we're coming down to a funnel this is all funneling down the whole thing brother this is all funneling down the whole thing is god himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth and that and that's what god is the whole thing oh just like the the disciples would be able to write to write and say oh we touched it we handled the very word of life that was made flesh now god has caught a bride in the end time that now also is the word made flesh you're the very bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh you're the very attributes of god look come on there's no guesswork in it you might not even know who you are you might be wondering who you are but according to the word of god and god's thoughts that have already been spoken concerning you i know my thoughts that i think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring you to an expected look what you are and who you are where you came from and where you are going it's already sealed it's already settled it's already been determined in the thinking of god you might be trying to wonder and to figure out and to wonder well who i am and where did i come from but no there's no chance there's no thinking about it you are the very thoughts of god that have been manifest the very word that has been spoken in the end time but what god's wanting to do is he's wanting to open your eyes that you can actually see what god has spoken concerning you that's the purpose of the message that's the purpose of the prophet that's the purpose of the eagle going out and looking for the other egg that it had that had hatched out in a barnyard that's the purpose of the end time message is to find those predestinated seeds and to reveal to them where they came from and where they're going just as brother billy was ministering as this prophet would climb up into the very mind of god and be able to see even before time began we'd be able to see eternity to eternity and be able to soar out there up into the heavens and bring the very mind and thoughts of god and say you were with me in the very beginning you were with me before the world was ever formed and start to tell you where you came from and then start to identify the condition of the age and start to show us exactly the things and events that are going to transpire and then even go to show you where we're going to and a prophet could stand there and say oh in his humanity being a man he would stand stand there and say well i feel like this is an irresponsible thing to say but i believe i've been to both hell and heaven oh friends we're living with an open book we don't even have to guess what hell is we don't have to guess what heaven is but god has revealed his very secret of his mind to the bride he's left no guesswork all he's asking you to do is believe it and that's what the light is doing now is it shining forth and the spirit of god is moving upon your life to clear away the darkness that that light can strike the sea that you might recognize who you are in the word that's right oh my i just i love this type that we see in the earth because now here the earth is it's without form and it's void but now this this seed is laying there in the earth now think about it all the potentials are in that seed but there's a veil something there's a veil there that is preventing this seed from coming into its maturity there's something preventing the seed from being quickened now it's a seed of god because it's germatized prophet of god goes into that and says you know only only the elect can be reborn because in non-seed there's nothing to quicken so we're not questioning whether your seed you are sons and daughters of god but there has been a veil if you will something that has been stretched before of preventing that sunlight to strike the seed and quicken it to come to life now we can look at the condition of the world what it was in and it says oh there was the earth was without form and void and there's now this cloud and there's this darkness that is over the earth now we could look at that and understand that was in the firmaments or that was maybe natural but if we now take it to the individual maybe it's the veil of your humanity maybe it's the veil of your tradition you know a lot of message believers are in bondage to tradition maybe ought to say that again a lot of so-called message believers are in bondage to tradition they have their wednesday church service they have their sunday church service they have their press play but they're not being changed they're not being quickened they're not coming into an atmosphere and into a presence of god where they are the very life of god being materialized in this earth and now are the light to the world no you're just kind of blending in at your job you're just kind of blending in at your school you're just kind of blending in at the mall and everywhere you go you're just kind of blending in maybe blending in like pentecostals maybe blending in like lutherans maybe just blending in like you have a bunch of tradition but where is the life i wonder if there's not a veil of tradition that you have stretched forth before you and the very word that has been spoken in the evening time which is the light to bring that seed to maturity is being blocked because you feel like you've achieved something in yourself and you've arrived to a condition that you're comfortable with and there's not a thirsting there's not a hungering but the bible tells me those that first and those that hunger they shall be filled i pray that there's something in the child of god that's not satisfied with where they are there's something that's hungering and thirsting and saying i need more i want more i want to go higher i want to go further i want to go deeper all that you have for me lord i want that oh reveal yourself to me lord if there's a veil if there's a veil of tradition if there's a veil of denomination if there's a veil of an attitude come on somebody if there's a veil of an attitude towards the word of god if there's a veil of an attitude towards the man of god if there's a veil of an attitude towards the church if there's a veil of an attitude a towards the song leader if there's a veil of an attitude a torture brother or your sister you are being veiled from the very light of god and light brings life and you are void of the spirit of god moving in your life i say oh god we need something to come we need something to come and rip away the veil that the light of the s-o-n can shine into our souls and quicken that seed to life oh but we're veiled veiled by tradition veiled by humanity veiled by our attitude towards the word veiled by our own ideas oh ain't got to be sinful ideas we can even be veiled by our ambitions we got our life so pre-scheduled god's wanting to move in your life wanting you to to be in fellowship he's wanting to move in your life you're sorry god i'm actually let me see what i got what day i got available um i got school today i got church wednesday i got church sunday all the friends are coming over i know they're on friday um lord i think maybe you what do you got going on next month lord i think maybe let's just see if we can oh come on now oh as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god i think we need to let our ideas and our schedule and the way we got everything so pre-planned well this is what we're going to do after church we're just going to go home and we got it all predetermined and not realize that there's a hungry soul in the parking lot and if you just take a moment and take a chance to listen friends do you realize who you are you are god made flesh and sometimes i wonder after i've gone to a store or i've gone somewhere and i'm leaving i'm like that's it that's all god did when he went to the grocery store i just walked by all these people with needs and i know we can't heal everybody i know we can't talk to everybody but all if we could just be sensitive and say oh god is there a seed here is there something i can say is there something that i can do i'm reminded there in john 5 9 that speaks of jesus that he did nothing but what the father had showed him and the prophet of god would pick that up in the church book and you say this harmony now exists between the bride and the bridegroom she has the mind of christ she knows what he wants done with the word she has the saith the lord or she stands still i think that's one problem that a lot of us have we don't know how to stand still oh god help me help me lord when i don't have thus saith the lord to stand still i think of the the scripture where they the sadducees and pharisees had brought a woman that was caught in adultery and they come and threw her at his feet and said oh what do you say to this woman she was caught in the very act of adultery what do you say about it what do you say about so-and-so did you hear what so-and-so did did you hear about their sin did you hear about their mistakes what do you say about it well you know actually i think you know i kind of saw it coming because you know i could kind of tell you know what they they used to be sitting on the second row in church and then and they started moving towards the back and i started to think you know the first thing that goes the spirit you know and then it's manifested in the natural and oh my we're just so quick we've got our discernment we got our judgment i know exactly what we should do in this situation well the prophet of god said we have the law of moses she's in adultery my will it's there's no guesswork here the word says stoner we're all believers of the word stoner and hear the very word made flesh doesn't even say a word why because he practices what he preaches maybe he's waiting for the vision to unfold maybe he's maybe god's already given a vision he knows i know i'm going to speak this word right when this sadducee comes over here and puts his hand on his shoulder and the lord told me that right at that very moment as that hand goes up i'll go ahead and speak or maybe he doesn't even know what to do yet so he just knows father i don't do anything unless you show me and so he just stoops down he starts writing in the sand you know me and some of the brothers that's what we do now if somebody comes up and starts asking you and saying something about somebody or wanting an opinion and it really doesn't matter just why don't you just go ahead and go i'm just standing still brother i don't want to speak unless he shows me to speak and they keep after him and they keep after him and then oh then god had given him the words to say and he said he who is without sin cast the first tone oh my we got a bunch of stone throwers in the church we got a bunch of people that just want to pick up stones they got a bunch of stones like oh you did what what you you didn't show up to church on sunday i thought you were a bullet you you did what oh come on come on hey i i've been guilty i've been the one that's picked up the whole piano be like you need one you going i'm mad what's that still small voice saying you who's without sin oh what did the scripture say if we say we have no sin we're liars who are we to judge anybody who are we we're all born in sin we're all shaped in iniquity we're all sinners we all needed the blood we all needed the blood of jesus christ oh and when you've tasted it hallelujah it doesn't bring no judgment you could look at somebody in their fault and failure say man i know a god that forgives i know a god of grace i know a god of compassion i know a god that can take your situation he can take that condition you're living in and the spirit of god can move upon your life he can take away all the gloom and the doubt and the eson can shine into your life and change everything forever oh hallelujah that's what we're talking about oh the prophet would say this he'd say when he gets ready to use an individual he separates the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he separates the light from the darkness oh in order for that seed to be quickened it has to receive the light and the light is the manifestation of the spoken word prophet would say this the same message he goes so life is only by the word of god made manifest life comes only by the word of god made manifest as long as it is just in the book like this it still can be questioned and i want to say as long as the word remains on the tapes as long as it remains in the message books it can still be questioned oh i'd like to stop there but maybe we can build towards something but when it's made manifest i'll let the prophet do it but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what is spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word the word said so and then when it comes to past that is life in light light bringing life light brings life you are the word of god the spoken word is the original seed you are the word of god and god sent his word to his word to produce the word oh my talk about multiplication word coming to word praise god look if you if you plant a seed and you put it in the basement this is what the profit goes on next through the next paragraphs here and where a man can turn a light if you plant a seed and put it in the basement or maybe you put it out in the shed i mean if you keep going down there and check on it to see if it's coming to life you're wasting your time because that seed cannot come to its potentials until the light strikes the seed and it's the light that brings life if the seed is germatized the life in the seed is the life of god but it takes the light of his word to bring the life that's in the seed however that went that's the way it went and that's how god ordained it so as soon as the light strikes it it will bring forth life if it's a dermatitis seed or if i can say it like this if there is any life in the seed it will respond to the light oh that's how god always does it so hear the word made manifest in jesus christ he is the light the word made flesh the word manifested is the light so now here is the word made manifest and says i have needs to go by samaria why i have needs to go by samaria because there is a seed there that the light has to strike the seed but the woman at the well she was living in darkness there was a veil around her life there was a fog and there was a mist but now jesus christ is coming because when god decides to use an individual he actually starts to separate the light from the darkness and the esso in the word just it takes that to strike the seed and bring forth the potentials that was planted so here is a predestinated seed of god oh she's had five husbands she's living in sin there's this fog over her life she doesn't even know who she is she she's a samaritan she's half jew half gentile she she's she believes in god but there's this wondering of well we worship in this mountain they worshipping that mountain but her life has all been messed up all the jews wrote her off she had written her the town had written her off she was in violation of the law but now look at this the light hallelujah said i have needs to go by bedford texas because i have to shine upon a seed and now i got to start to discern the thoughts and intents of her heart and perform the messiah sign and the spirit of god is now going to move upon her condition and separate the light from the darkness that is the light that the sea can be struck by the manifested word of the hour and bring forth the potentials that i had in my mind and had spoke before i even put the world into existence oh hallelujah that is what has happened with you oh you talk about a revival talk about a spirit of revival when the word manifested showed up into her life and was able to discern the thoughts and intents of her life and actually separate the darkness away from the seed oh thank you jesus i was in a lot of darkness i was in a lot of bad places oh i was in a lot of sin but god moved upon my life and the spirit of god separated all of the darkness he actually took all of my sins he threw it into god's sea of forgetfulness oh it was a cloudless sky and the s-o-n of god's word shined into my soul and it birthed forth life oh you talk about a revival i told all my friends i told all my neighbors i'm still doing it you talk about a revival here this lady who had been just met the messiah she started to come back to the town and oh my you know what they wanted to do to her don't listen to her don't pay her any mind do you know what she's done oh just just two weeks ago do you know what she did do you know where she's been i want to tell you smear campaigns are nothing new the devil's a master of it he wants to point to your past he wants to point to your failures and he just doesn't want to do it to you he's going to try to tell the church about it he's going to try to tell the world about it but oh you know what i love about that go ahead and tell the world and the church about my past cause the only thing you're doing is helping me tell my testimony oh hallelujah yeah i've been to some unsavory places you can tell me where i messed up here you can tell me where i messed up there but oh there has been a revival that has broke out in my heart and i can stand in the face of my critics i can stand in the face of my enemy say all that be true but god rich in mercy come by my way he separated the darkness from my life and the glorious light of his gospel i struck the predestinated seat of god and now i'm living in revival i can call those things that are not as though they are because i know i come from god i'm going back to god oh let there be and there was oh we're coming into a position where we can speak the word hallelujah just moving towards the close here all the scripture would say ye are the light of the world a city set on the hill cannot be hid oh come on i want to see somebody who's alight oh yeah you can't hide it you can't help it it's fire shut up in my bones oh there's just something in here i got a little rule of mine if somebody's gonna take at least a minute or two to tell them about their day god help me they take a minute or two to tell them about my jesus somebody wants to tell you how their day went and how bad things are tell you about news and tell you about politics all i'm doing is waiting for my cue lord i'm standing still i'm waiting oh god i'm waiting on god oh can you believe how bad the politics are oh yeah can you believe the darkness and how how evil and all the wickedness that's going on in this day but you did you know the bible said in the evening time oh you just like a horse at the gate i'm ready to run there's a revival inside of me let me out let me run let me fly let me soar let me preach let me tell let me testify let me get my eagle claws into something cause i gotta tell you about jesus i gotta tell you about the message of the hour the gospel light that shined into my life he broke up all the chaos he separated the darkness and the only thing left is his very life oh that's a revival hallelujah and by god's grace i'm living in revival oh glory to god now we just we're gonna lay a foundation to close you ever that one i'm gonna lay a foundation to close we're gonna slow down for just a second stay with me because i'm finally to my my opening text the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved now just listen to this word move the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now i'm going to attempt to say this the hebrew way once the word moved is rahoff and it comes from the root word to brood so now i'm going to say it the english phonetic way is rakoff so this word move rakoff is actually means to brood it's used only in the scripture three times and each time it's used it's used in a different manner it's used it means to flutter to move or to shake and as the spirit of god moved this is the same word rakoff that is used in deuteronomy 32 11 that says as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth there's the word moved as the spirit of god moved as the spirit of god fluttereth over her young and spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on their wings i want to say you might not even know or believe that the spirit of god is moving on you but i want you to know that the spirit of god is brooding over your life it's brooding over your family it's brooding over your prayers your prayers have not been forgotten mom your prayers have not been forgotten dead those prayers that you've been praying for and believing for a married couple they are not forgotten but the spirit of god is now brooding over your life he's mindful of those promises he's mindful of those prayers and the spirit of god is moving he he's brooding over your life that's what the spirit of god is doing it wants to move upon you and speak the word to your condition and to your situation that you can be set free that you can be delivered and god the transforming power of god here is a world in chaos and god can move upon a situation and just with one word turn a world of chaos into a garden of eden oh i want to tell you friends start looking at start start taking courage and to call those things that are not as though they are and start drawing from the unseen and maybe in your situation and start calling those things that you're going to receive it that you could speak the word or if the musicians would come we're still laying a foundation for clothes though the prophet of god would say this i just want to to read this quote it blessed me it's just speaking about the spirit of god moving because the spirit of god creates an atmosphere just give me a moment sister i'll be i'll be ready in a moment it's the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere the prophet god says it takes the spirit of god to bring life and that life must not come out of just an intellectual revival it goes to come out of the bible word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in acts 2. well what happened in acts 2 they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized in the holy ghost and power for service came and what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them oh it'll do the same thing when the quickening power strikes you oh it'll be like a sound of a rushing mighty wind and the very tongue of god will set down on you i'm talking about a lick of fire oh a very portion of that very zoey life will come down and set upon you or to produce the same thing exactly it always has it always will be because it's the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere it takes atmosphere to do things that's the reason you men are always taught bring your children here well certainly that's right i was glad to see my daughter rebecca come in and sit down just a few minutes ago some of you see me wink at a woman it was my daughter so she come and sat down i want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and that's why she is here in the meeting that's the purpose of it it takes atmosphere what i'm drawing from this is the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere now the third time this this rakoff is used in scripture is in jeremiah 23 9 it says my heart within me is broken of the prophets all my bones shake jeremiah's heart was broken and he was actually shaking and trembling because israel had now gone off into whoredoms and he said they were adulterers and the very land would have become a wilderness and i want to say as are we looking at this the spirit of god will move in your life he will brood upon your life as a hen would brood over or he will shake you and i want to tell you however it's going to come the spirit of god is going to move upon your condition that he might create an atmosphere and be able to speak the word of god to strike that predestinated seed to bring it to life that's how god always does it but god's word we know comes to a prophet that's what it says in amos 3 7 it says surely the lord will do nothing but what he revealeth his secrets unto the servants the prophet go ahead and play something that way we can close my foundation's getting longer to close let's stand but noah's message was the light of the hour moses message was the light of the hour moses had met the pillar of fire moses was the manifestation of the word that said i will send you a deliver and when that word was now manifested moses became the light and then moses comes down to egypt and because moses was that light god could tell him say let it be fleece and there was he can say let the death angel pass and it was because moses was the light of god and for the sake of time we know the scripture says but it shall be one day which shall be known unto the lord not day or night but it shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be light i want to say it like this that the very manifestation of malachi 4. the very manifestation of luke 17 30 in revelations 10 1-7 that is the light that is the spoken word that has been manifested which is the light to the age look you can fight against it you can bad talk it you can do whatever you want to do but it's already been spoken you've come too late the message has already gone forth it's already awakened the bride oh come on the very light that was shining that said let there be a bride without spot or wrinkle and there was let there be a virgin wound to receive the message and there was let there be a bride that cannot fall and she was oh the word says let there be and there was and here she is oh that light that was shining just as john came to introduce the light the esso in the prophet has come and introduced the bride to the esso in light and now the bride is becoming one flesh with the word and now you are the light amen oh hallelujah oh take the book eat it up thou must prophesy again let there be and there was oh spirit of god move write your word in my heart feel my hope come true [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how [Music] [Music] write

that i do shall he do also in greater works than these shall you do because i go into my father oh the prophet of god at the end of this message there is a man that could turn a light he'd say but in the last days he had nothing he just spoke and said say it'll be there and it was there without anything in it he never had a squirrel there was none there he just said let there be and there was see oh his word is unfallible it has to be fulfilled i'm so thankful that we've seen one that come to maturity and it was just a sheaf wave the word being made manifest was a sheaf wave to the rest of the wheat seed showing you hey i know what i'm gonna be i see an eagle soaring way in the heavens that means that's where i'm going to be i'm going to come back into my position to be able to speak the word and say [Music] let there be and there was amen heavenly father we love you lord we just thank you that we've had an opportunity to come and be able to worship you lord just thank you lord that
