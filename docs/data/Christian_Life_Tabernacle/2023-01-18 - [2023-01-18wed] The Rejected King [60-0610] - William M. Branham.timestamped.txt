[31:18] we're so grateful for that father we ask

[31:25] house of the Lord
[31:27] Lord I ask that your spirit would go by

[31:44] Lord

[31:48] father that they're in the palm of your
[31:50] hand and nothing can pluck them out we
[31:54] trust that this evening in Jesus
[31:57] precious and holy name we pray amen amen
[32:02] God richly bless you just have your
[32:04] seeds for a moment and and uh
[32:10] the this evening we uh just have felt
[32:14] led to uh play an hour of the message
[32:18] called rejected King
[32:20] and uh
[32:22] you know there's
[32:24] some wonderful things but
[32:28] the theme of rejected King is they
[32:31] rejected the leadership that God
[32:34] provided
[32:36] and I think that's a great question that
[32:39] we need to always asking ourselves
[32:41] what's influencing us what's leading us
[32:45] what's causing us to make our decisions
[32:50] and uh and I like what the prophet of
[32:54] God and he made this statement he said
[32:56] in the day of Samuel the people were a
[32:59] great deal like they are in all the days
[33:03] they had come to the place that they
[33:06] wanted to be like other people
[33:09] and that's just the simple a nature with
[33:13] people people want to impersonate each
[33:17] other
[33:19] just think uh
[33:21] that's just our nature you know so we
[33:25] just want to be careful
[33:26] I'd like to read another statement he
[33:28] said we'll listen to it in a second
[33:31] and here comes somebody along saying
[33:33] Jesus is coming on a white cloud
[33:37] no he's coming on a white horse
[33:40] all right
[33:41] we'll just separate
[33:43] we'll get me a group and we're gonna get
[33:47] you a group there you are what
[33:50] difference does it make he's coming
[33:52] anyhow it don't matter how he comes the
[33:57] thing of it is are you ready to go with
[33:59] him when he comes that's the main thing
[34:03] doesn't matter how he comes what form he
[34:07] comes in let's just be ready to go
[34:11] but they'll split hairs on little bitty
[34:14] things and form other another
[34:16] organizations that's just the way the
[34:20] world did it and I remember the brothers
[34:24] they always talk when we have meetings
[34:27] especially amongst my trustee Brothers
[34:30] they'll always say let's keep the main
[34:32] thing the main thing
[34:34] you know let's don't get tracked off
[34:36] let's keep the main thing the main thing
[34:39] for us is we have a guide
[34:42] we have some the word of God that's come
[34:46] to guide us
[34:49] to get us to that coming of the Lord and
[34:53] that rapture
[34:54] and if we'll keep that the main thing
[34:57] and not stray from that so I just didn't
[35:00] want us to go too long without listening
[35:03] to our messenger because when we listen
[35:06] to our messenger we pick up just a lot
[35:08] more than the teachings we pick up the
[35:12] right attitude we pick up the spirit of
[35:15] the word of God there's lots of way the
[35:17] word of God influences us so tonight if
[35:22] we're going to listen to an hour of
[35:23] rejected Kings uh if you have one at
[35:26] your device devices I never like the
[35:30] word device
[35:31] you know because it just sounds divisive
[35:35] you know what I mean but uh so I know
[35:38] you can listen on your phone you can
[35:40] watch on the board uh there's different
[35:43] ways to go but uh we're gonna start by
[35:47] reading uh prophet of God's going to
[35:49] start by reading to us uh first Samuel
[35:52] the seventh chapter no no the eighth
[35:55] chapter and begin with the fourth verse
[35:58] first Samuel 8th chapter beginning with
[36:02] the fourth verse let us read so let us
[36:05] stand as we prepare to listen uh this is
[36:10] one of those messages that is full of
[36:13] little nuggets
[36:15] you know what the world might call
[36:17] one-liners or or just thoughts that are
[36:23] thrown out there but the it's it's to
[36:28] bring us back
[36:31] and and just remember
[36:33] if you're away tonight he wants to bring
[36:36] you back if you've got cold towards the
[36:39] message and the word of God he wants to
[36:42] bring you back and you all have a
[36:46] predestinated identity
[36:48] with the message of the hour
[36:51] you've been equipped to hear it my sheep
[36:56] hear my voice so let us enjoy tonight
[36:59] this portion as as we listen if you have
[37:03] your device we're starting in the 20th
[37:06] uh
[37:08] paragraph 20 and we're going to go
[37:11] through paragraph 85 I believe it's just
[37:15] one hour so let's rejoice in God's word
[37:18] enjoy yourself uh take notes and and
[37:22] listen tonight as we'll pray father
[37:25] bless your word to us tonight
[37:27] Lord we feel led so we know there's
[37:29] something tonight for each person in
[37:32] here may you catch their Spirit father
[37:35] may you catch their heart
[37:37] may they inclined their ear to your word
[37:40] father may go past every distraction
[37:43] father every care of this world and
[37:47] father take the voice of your messenger
[37:49] to speak to that predestinated seed we
[37:53] ask it tonight in Jesus name amen God
[37:57] bless you as you enjoy the voice of the
[37:59] seventh angel messenger your messenger
[38:02] the voice of God to you God bless you
[38:09] now let us turn tonight to for the text
[38:14] if I should call it that in first Samuel
[38:18] the seventh chapter the eighth chapter
[38:20] and begin with the fourth verse
[38:23] first
[38:25] Samuel
[38:27] the eighth chapter
[38:29] and the beginning with the fourth verse
[38:34] let us read
[38:37] then all the Elders of Israel gathered
[38:40] to themselves together and came to
[38:44] Samuel onto Rhema
[38:47] and said unto him
[38:49] behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk
[38:53] not in thy ways
[38:56] now make us a king to judge us like all
[39:01] the nations
[39:05] but this display this please Samuel
[39:09] when they said give us a king to judge
[39:12] us
[39:13] and Samuel prayed unto the Lord
[39:16] and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken
[39:20] unto the voice of the people in all that
[39:24] they say unto thee
[39:26] for they have not rejected thee but they
[39:31] have rejected me
[39:33] that I should not Reign Over them
[39:38] according to all the works which they
[39:41] have done since the day that I brought
[39:44] them up out of Egypt even unto this day
[39:48] or with they have forsaken me and served
[39:50] other gods so do they also unto thee
[39:57] if I was going to title this
[40:00] for a few moments and then we're going
[40:03] to take up our cards for prayer for the
[40:06] sick right where we left off last night
[40:10] and then tomorrow night tomorrow
[40:12] afternoon there will be prayer cards
[40:14] given out another prayer line tomorrow
[40:15] night and Sunday at two o'clock
[40:18] 2 30 prayer cards will be give out at 2
[40:21] then Sunday afternoon for Sunday
[40:23] afternoon service having prayer for the
[40:27] sake
[40:28] I want to entitle this subject tonight
[40:31] the rejected King
[40:36] and I wish we had chairs to accommodate
[40:40] or seat somehow the ones that are
[40:42] standing all around tonight uh this a
[40:45] building
[40:46] but I will try to hurry so that you
[40:49] won't have to stand too long but if
[40:51] you'll just give me your undivided
[40:53] attention for a few moments
[40:57] in the day of Samuel
[41:00] the people were a greedy like they are
[41:03] in all days
[41:06] they had come to a place that they
[41:08] wanted to be like the other people
[41:13] and
[41:15] that is just simply a nature with people
[41:19] want to impersonate each other
[41:23] if you go out and
[41:26] buy a certain kind of clothing or
[41:30] certain automobile
[41:32] paint your steps a certain color in your
[41:35] house or on your steps porch steps watch
[41:39] the neighbor they just can't stand it
[41:42] they've got to be the same you go to
[41:45] church and wear a certain kind of a hat
[41:47] that's a little different next Sunday
[41:49] you'll have a lot of your sisters with
[41:53] that same kind of hat if they can find
[41:54] it
[41:56] somehow another they just want to act
[41:59] like one another
[42:01] and that's a good thing if it's used
[42:05] right
[42:06] if it is used in the right way
[42:10] now but these people in the days of
[42:14] Samuel
[42:15] the prophet
[42:18] they wanted to act like the Philistines
[42:21] and the amalekites
[42:23] and the unbelieving
[42:27] and they because that they've seen their
[42:29] people was a little more fancy
[42:34] and they were a nation of called out and
[42:38] chosen people
[42:40] and they are not supposed to act like
[42:43] the rest of the people
[42:45] God's people is never to act like the
[42:49] world or look like the world or be
[42:51] anything to do with the world
[42:54] you are a
[42:56] separated people the church
[42:59] are called out
[43:01] A peculiar people a royal priesthood a
[43:06] holy nation
[43:08] all together different and set aside and
[43:11] all your actions and habits and ways
[43:14] from the things of the world
[43:18] now may the Lord help us as we study
[43:21] now these people seen how the
[43:24] Philistines were doing how the
[43:26] amalekites and the different ones were
[43:29] acting and they came to samly and said
[43:33] we want to be like damn
[43:37] and it's about the same today
[43:40] uh you just let the world start a
[43:45] certain fashion
[43:46] or or some fad and you find all the
[43:51] people even to many other Christians
[43:53] want to do that same thing
[43:56] they want to act like it
[43:59] you let the boys start cutting their
[44:03] hair a certain way
[44:05] and all the boys want to do it
[44:09] and they got to a place down here let
[44:12] their hair grow out real big and looks
[44:14] like a duck or something sitting on top
[44:16] of their head
[44:18] and I tell you I believe that
[44:22] I I if I was a woman a girl and a
[44:28] boyfriend of mine did like that I'd set
[44:30] him down and shave his hair off
[44:32] it looks to me like that a woman would
[44:35] want a man
[44:37] I'll tell you maybe the woman is so
[44:40] masculine that she wants something
[44:42] feminished but that certainly looks like
[44:43] a woman to me I have all that big bush
[44:47] like a duck or a crow or something
[44:49] sitting on top of their head the big
[44:51] long thing sticking out in the back and
[44:53] I never seen such an outfit in my life
[44:56] now I've seen some preachers like that
[44:59] what in the world is this thing coming
[45:02] to after a while they'll have a
[45:04] beat-neck pastor if you don't watch out
[45:06] what they're doing
[45:08] that's the truth oh the church has to
[45:11] act just like the world it must be uh
[45:14] that was rude and I I don't mean it that
[45:16] way see but I'm just trying to make up
[45:18] I'm trying to drive a nail down so tight
[45:20] it won't come out till the clinch on the
[45:22] other side if it hurts maybe I'll back
[45:24] up just a little bit but it's got to be
[45:27] clinched to make it whole is that right
[45:29] brother Woods he's a contractor you got
[45:32] to make it whole by clenching it and I
[45:35] think a man ought to be a man
[45:38] and a woman ought to be a lady
[45:41] and I think that a Christian ought to
[45:44] act like a Christian and associate with
[45:46] Christians and the Church of the leading
[45:49] God
[45:50] ought to be together with one heart and
[45:51] one Accord and have nothing to do with
[45:54] the world when it comes to their ways
[45:56] and habits
[45:58] but we find it today just like it was
[46:01] then they come to Samuel and they said
[46:04] now you're getting old your hair is
[46:06] getting green
[46:07] and we we just don't know how much
[46:10] longer you're going to stay around
[46:12] and now we want you to make us a king
[46:16] just like the Philistines has got like
[46:19] all the rest of the world is God
[46:21] make us just like damn and displeases
[46:25] holy prophet of God
[46:28] any Prophet if he is a prophet he's for
[46:31] Holiness and righteousness and the
[46:34] things of God he can't stand still
[46:37] he's got to bring it out sometimes it
[46:41] costs his life but he he'll bring it
[46:44] anyhow because God is in the person
[46:48] and the pastor Prophet that really for
[46:51] God if it hurts it just he you don't
[46:54] mean to hurt the people he loves the
[46:55] people but he's trying to save them
[46:57] thing and while this uh Kylie upset the
[47:02] good old Prophet that they thought he
[47:04] was too old to go and we find out he
[47:06] lived for many many years later but he
[47:08] was uh he was a servant of the Lord and
[47:11] in doing that they rejected their real
[47:15] King which was God
[47:18] and that displeased the prophet
[47:22] and he didn't want him to do that now
[47:25] Samuel in our message represents the
[47:28] Holy Spirit now Samuel was the
[47:31] mouthpiece of God and today the holy
[47:35] spirit is the mouthpiece of God and
[47:38] today instead of having all of our
[47:41] different Fang dangles in church
[47:44] God wants us to let him rule
[47:48] not popes Bishops and gentle overseers
[47:52] and doctrines and denominations and
[47:54] everything he sent the Holy Spirit to
[47:57] rule the church
[47:59] but we like the people of old we say
[48:01] well let us be like the rest of them
[48:04] they've got a great organization that
[48:06] says build up our group because we
[48:08] believe this now the Holy Spirit never
[48:11] would have stood still for that no sir
[48:13] the Holy Spirit wants us to have no
[48:15] fancies no boundary lines he wants us to
[48:17] be one in him we are children Brothers
[48:21] God doesn't separate his children he
[48:23] said I'll give this in corn bread and
[48:25] beans and this and ice cream and Pie he
[48:27] doesn't do that let listen starve to
[48:29] death and the other thing he feeds them
[48:31] all at the same table
[48:33] and the Holy Spirit should lead the
[48:35] church but they didn't want it that way
[48:38] they they wanted a king they wanted to
[48:40] be like the rest of the world
[48:42] and when the Pentecostal Church the Holy
[48:45] Spirit first fell about 50 something
[48:48] years ago if they would have just let it
[48:51] alone and let God add to the church
[48:54] daily such as would be saved it would
[48:57] have been like it was an Apostolic age
[48:59] but we had to draw fences we had to be
[49:02] like the rest of we had to if the
[49:04] Methodist is a denomination we must be
[49:06] and here comes somebody long said Jesus
[49:09] is coming on a white cloud no he's
[49:10] coming on a white horse all right will
[49:12] you separate I'll get me a group you get
[49:14] you a group there you are what
[49:15] difference does it make he's coming
[49:17] anyhow and no matter how he's coming the
[49:20] thing of it is are you ready to go with
[49:22] him when he comes that's the main thing
[49:25] it doesn't matter how he comes what farm
[49:27] he comes in let's just be ready to go
[49:29] but they'll split hairs on little bitty
[49:32] things and form another organization and
[49:35] that's just the way the world did it and
[49:38] Good Old Samuel he took it to the Lord
[49:40] and he said Lord what can I do about
[49:43] these matters the people are determined
[49:46] that they must have it just that way and
[49:50] we we must we don't know just what to do
[49:53] about this and the Lord said go right
[49:55] ahead and give him their uh give them
[49:58] their King because they're not rejecting
[50:01] you they're rejecting me to be their
[50:03] judge see people don't want the Holy
[50:06] Spirit to judge them
[50:08] no no you don't want that
[50:10] they want they want some Creed to judge
[50:13] him but they want some church to judge
[50:16] them but they don't want the Holy Spirit
[50:18] and he said go ahead and make him a king
[50:21] so
[50:22] they searched out through the country
[50:23] and down in The Tribe of Benjamin they
[50:28] found a man by the name of Kish who had
[50:31] a son named Saul and they chose him
[50:34] great big handsome looking intellectual
[50:41] giant of a man head and shoulders above
[50:44] any other man
[50:46] wear up high intellectual educated smart
[50:49] shrewd nice looking oh that was just
[50:52] exactly what they wanted something they
[50:54] could show off with
[50:56] that's just about the way the churches
[50:57] is getting you want some great big
[51:00] organization something great big fine
[51:03] Church bigger than the little Mission
[51:05] Downtowner
[51:06] that's just the way it goes and many
[51:09] times they leave the little mission
[51:10] where the spirit is leading to go charm
[51:13] to that because you say I belong to the
[51:15] first church
[51:16] see the same old devil just exactly the
[51:21] same misleading other people
[51:23] the biggest church something to show
[51:25] something big all people like to say
[51:28] that they like to get to a place where
[51:30] they got the finest pasture while they
[51:33] got a pastor that's got four degrees out
[51:37] of uh a Princeton or some great
[51:40] University he's so smart and everything
[51:42] like that he might have all those
[51:44] degrees but in God's side he might not
[51:46] even be enough to make a hog collar
[51:48] that's exactly right but all alone
[51:51] God
[51:53] God chooses man and he is our King
[51:59] God the Holy Spirit was sent to govern
[52:02] the Pentecostal Believers the Holy
[52:04] Spirit Believers the king God was sent
[52:08] to do that now
[52:11] they chose him and he was a great man
[52:14] fine fellow just exactly what they
[52:17] wanted that was the God how they before
[52:20] they are
[52:21] anointed in King they made him Chief
[52:24] Captain just to give him a tryout he was
[52:26] a failure to start with to begin with it
[52:29] wasn't in God's program but however when
[52:32] they chose him
[52:33] find him it was going to make him King
[52:36] Samuel told him he said now go on first
[52:40] if you choose to be have a king and
[52:43] reject God you know what's going to take
[52:45] place
[52:46] here he says what's going to take place
[52:49] he'll call all your sons and daughters
[52:52] to be his servants you will pay a tenth
[52:55] of all you got to feed his army and your
[52:59] fine Vineyards and all your fine cattle
[53:01] to be taken over and everything and
[53:03] that's the way it'll be you'll have to
[53:05] have armor barriers you'll have to have
[53:06] soldiers your daughters will be cooks
[53:08] and confectionaries to feed the soldiers
[53:10] and that's the way it'll be oh that's
[53:12] all right but we want him anyhow
[53:15] we want him anyhow
[53:16] then he called him to a place before
[53:19] anointing Saul King he said I want to
[53:23] ask you something
[53:24] in other words let me put it like this
[53:26] have not I been with you since a child
[53:30] as a prophet
[53:32] have I ever took any of your money have
[53:36] I ever begged you for anything
[53:38] no have I ever spoke to you in the name
[53:42] of the Lord but what it come to pass
[53:45] no that's right Samuel all that you have
[53:49] done has been of the lord well then why
[53:52] don't you let God be your king
[53:55] oh we know that you're the prophet we
[53:57] know that you're the servant of God we
[53:59] know that you speak the truth and we
[54:01] know that you're right you've been the
[54:02] right kind of the judge and everything
[54:03] over us father through the Holy Spirit
[54:05] but still we want the king oh brother
[54:09] when people get their head set on
[54:10] something they're just going on anyhow
[54:13] there's just hardly anything you can do
[54:15] that just got your mind made up they're
[54:17] going to do it whether it's right or
[54:18] wrong well you can stand and preach to
[54:20] people that it's wrong for their women
[54:22] to dress immoral for a man to go and
[54:24] women to go to dances for this rock and
[54:27] roll stuff they'll take right out of
[54:29] there like a home to its wall and a dog
[54:31] to its vomit it's exactly right pay no
[54:34] more attention to it and nothing in the
[54:36] world because they are determined
[54:38] they're going to do it anyhow they say
[54:41] they want it anyhow all right so the
[54:44] after all the warnings have been given
[54:47] then finally they wanted a king any
[54:49] household
[54:51] Saul was anointed king the first thing
[54:54] taking place the enemy slipped in on one
[54:57] side and put the right eye out of a lot
[55:00] of the people of God you know the story
[55:02] it's found your Samuel 8 9-10 put the
[55:06] right eye out that's just what the enemy
[55:09] wants to do that's what the enemy's
[55:11] trying to do tonight put the right eye
[55:13] of God's people out the doors it was a
[55:16] right eye the one is spiritual if he can
[55:18] put the spiritual side out of your eye
[55:21] where you see the natural things and not
[55:24] the spiritual things he's got you
[55:26] whipped right there
[55:28] long as you can have churches and big
[55:31] places and find intellectual dress
[55:33] people and so forth as long as your eye
[55:36] looks like that and don't see the spirit
[55:38] side the enemies got you under his
[55:40] control cause you don't know where
[55:41] you're going
[55:43] Amen brother listen what we need today
[55:46] is an old time Backwoods sin killing
[55:50] Revival the Bible Holy Ghost back into
[55:53] the church again with a power of God
[55:55] over the audience and the people feeling
[55:57] the Holy Spirit
[55:59] that's what we need today and if that
[56:02] would take place every wall of
[56:04] denominational difference to be broke
[56:06] down the Oneness Tunis streness Church
[56:09] of God Pilgrim Holiness nazarenes all of
[56:12] them together would be shouting and
[56:13] eating off the same Apple well they
[56:15] would they would be so brotherly and
[56:18] sisterly there would be not even one
[56:20] thought of it but see we want to pattern
[56:23] after something of the world that same
[56:26] thing got into our nation
[56:28] our nation used to be governed by real
[56:32] true politics
[56:33] Christians that go together and pray and
[56:36] come out anointed and try to govern our
[56:39] nation now it's just this honeycombed as
[56:42] it can be with everything
[56:44] crooked
[56:46] they tell me that Communists is all over
[56:48] the country
[56:50] free thinkers and all them kind of the
[56:53] stuff of organizations rising up and
[56:56] it's just in such a state there's no
[56:57] stop to it and it only shows one thing
[57:00] that the true king the Son of God is
[57:03] coming to take over and reign
[57:05] just as certain as we're in this
[57:08] convention tonight
[57:10] oh if people could only remember no
[57:14] matter how long you stay here on Earth
[57:16] still you've got to meet God you take
[57:19] and make God your king your Supreme Lord
[57:23] many people likes to see receive Jesus a
[57:26] savior oh yes I don't want to go to hell
[57:28] so I I'll take him as my savior but not
[57:30] your lord when he's Lord he's got
[57:33] rulership he comes out in and governs
[57:36] you and controls you but you say Lord
[57:38] you can be my savior but don't go to
[57:40] meddling in my private business I don't
[57:42] go you know these things uh you don't
[57:45] want your private life you don't want to
[57:47] Shredder it all to God and that's true
[57:50] friends and whatever you do when you
[57:52] leave this convention you leave this
[57:54] meeting you go home with one
[57:56] determination that you're going to seek
[57:59] God day and night and live in his
[58:01] presence get away from the things of the
[58:03] world
[58:04] oh yes they wanted this King and when
[58:08] they got the king then the enemy began
[58:10] to put the Eyes of the people out
[58:12] and then they couldn't see where they
[58:14] were going that's the first thing the
[58:16] devil does when he can get a servant of
[58:18] God he blinds into the fact that he's
[58:21] lost
[58:23] that's the first thing the enemy done
[58:24] when they got Samson another judge they
[58:27] put his eyes out where he couldn't see
[58:29] where he was going as soon as the enemy
[58:31] of the Philistines coming upon Israel
[58:33] they put the right eye out so they
[58:36] couldn't see good where they were going
[58:38] the only enemy comes into a church he
[58:40] puts her eyes out to the real facts that
[58:43] the holy spirit is the one who rules and
[58:46] governs the church
[58:48] all discipline is brought by the holy
[58:50] spirit amen
[58:53] well I wish I could say the words that
[58:55] would make you go home to the right
[58:57] place see that it never would leave
[58:59] trench in there
[59:01] God gave the Holy Spirit to rule and
[59:05] govern the church
[59:07] the Holy Spirit
[59:09] now
[59:11] now when this taking place they put the
[59:13] right eye out did you notice that
[59:15] cunning little thing that sold on
[59:18] oh he was a slick article
[59:21] because what did he do he sent out all
[59:24] around over the country pieces of ox
[59:28] that he had killed and said let all the
[59:30] people follow me and Samuel oh my
[59:35] me and Samuel
[59:38] see he put Samuel use Samuel's good
[59:41] reputation to deceive the people and
[59:44] many times today and our leaders does
[59:47] the same thing
[59:48] they put in our churches they say why so
[59:51] and so I found her he believed he did
[59:54] this yes he was a good man but brother
[59:56] Something's Happened since then that's
[59:59] right what happened you methodists that
[1:00:01] used to lay over the power of God all
[1:00:03] night long when Asbury and and and John
[1:00:07] and Charles was here in the United
[1:00:08] States they were called holy rollers and
[1:00:11] put out of the of the real churches the
[1:00:13] big churches laid out there in the
[1:00:15] school houses and the people it preached
[1:00:18] under the power of God until the people
[1:00:20] who fall out in the fore and they throw
[1:00:22] water in their face and Phantom back and
[1:00:24] forth that's that's me I've seen them do
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:29] John Wesley preaching Divine Healing
[1:00:32] one of his little books a man from The
[1:00:35] Angler Church turned a fox into
[1:00:37] foxhounds a loose amongst his
[1:00:39] congregation and John pointed his finger
[1:00:42] in that man's face and said the son will
[1:00:44] not set on your head three times until
[1:00:45] you call for me to pray for you that
[1:00:48] evening the man died with cramps in his
[1:00:50] stomach calling for John to come pray
[1:00:52] for him and today you talk about a
[1:00:54] heating service amongst the Methodist
[1:00:55] people
[1:00:56] some Methodist man was writing a thesis
[1:00:59] on a book or I don't hear some time ago
[1:01:01] about Divine Healing he said there's
[1:01:02] only one false a message that can find
[1:01:04] with you brother Brown I said what's
[1:01:05] that he said one thing that all that
[1:01:09] come to your meeting nearly as
[1:01:10] Pentecostal I said all right well let's
[1:01:12] change it you Methodist sponsor me and
[1:01:14] I'll come to you I said will you start
[1:01:16] in your city well he said of course I I
[1:01:19] said that's what I thought see just
[1:01:21] exactly God will send his message to
[1:01:23] somewhere it will not return to me for
[1:01:26] what
[1:01:27] can't reset which I have purpose God is
[1:01:30] able these stones to rise children to
[1:01:32] Abraham
[1:01:33] but they refer back to some great fellow
[1:01:37] moody or Wesley or some great person
[1:01:39] like that where they sprung up from now
[1:01:41] that's the same trick that assault on
[1:01:44] who will not father Samuel and I
[1:01:48] who will not follow Samuel and I let it
[1:01:51] be well that's just a smooth trick they
[1:01:55] they try to pull but Samuel still he
[1:01:59] told the people not to do this
[1:02:02] but they did it anyhow because they they
[1:02:05] wanted to do it they said they would do
[1:02:07] it anyhow
[1:02:10] and I was just looking here on the
[1:02:11] scripture word said here that
[1:02:14] that Samuel
[1:02:16] when he almost persuaded the people that
[1:02:19] they were doing what was wrong
[1:02:21] and then
[1:02:23] they went ahead and wanted to do it then
[1:02:25] when they got this thing taken place
[1:02:27] then Saul won this Victory and he sent
[1:02:31] out and told all the Hebrews what they
[1:02:33] should look for what the Hebrews have
[1:02:35] done and it really wasn't Saul that won
[1:02:37] the battle it was his son Jonathan that
[1:02:40] won the battle
[1:02:41] then we find again that when this man
[1:02:45] Saul the first thing you know he got
[1:02:47] great then stuck out his chest shortly
[1:02:51] we built this big thing we'd done this
[1:02:53] and when he done it then he got to a
[1:02:56] place he didn't want Samuel's advice
[1:02:59] anymore he died the way he wanted to do
[1:03:01] it and that's what's happened today the
[1:03:04] people has got to a place that they
[1:03:07] don't want to do it the way that God
[1:03:10] wants to do it they want to do it the
[1:03:12] way they want to do it
[1:03:14] that's what's the matter today
[1:03:16] God wants Divine Healing among his
[1:03:18] people
[1:03:20] big high fellow says now wait a minute
[1:03:22] the days of Miracles has passed
[1:03:25] now what caused Saul to do that when he
[1:03:28] got to a place that he took over the
[1:03:30] leading of the people instead of letting
[1:03:32] the uh the Holy Spirit now Samuel told
[1:03:35] him he said now if you'll go ahead and
[1:03:37] have your king and you'll all live right
[1:03:40] and keep God's Commandments and do what
[1:03:42] the Lord says and follow the spirit Saul
[1:03:45] will be able to preach us some mighty
[1:03:46] good messages and he did
[1:03:49] they had no right to disbelieve Samuel
[1:03:52] because Samuel always prophesied the
[1:03:54] truth to him
[1:03:55] he told him what was the truth I said
[1:03:58] now if you just said uh Saul and all of
[1:04:00] you follow the leadings of the spirit
[1:04:01] keep the Commandments of the Lord
[1:04:03] everything will be all right if that
[1:04:05] taken place tonight in every Church in
[1:04:08] the United States there would be a
[1:04:10] Revival start in this nation I tell you
[1:04:13] whiskey joints to be broke up it would
[1:04:16] be it would be one of the most grandest
[1:04:18] thing that this nation's ever known if
[1:04:19] every preacher of all denominations
[1:04:22] would just follow the leading of the
[1:04:24] Holy Spirit and instead of some Creed of
[1:04:27] their denomination
[1:04:28] what some Bishop said or somebody else
[1:04:30] said or somebody else said what somebody
[1:04:33] else said has nothing to do with to it
[1:04:34] God sent the Holy Spirit and he's our
[1:04:37] God he's our leader
[1:04:40] but when they even see the Holy Spirit
[1:04:41] moving they get scared of it they don't
[1:04:44] know what it is it's a stranger to them
[1:04:47] because they're not taught in that line
[1:04:49] they're taught to stop on a certain
[1:04:51] thing if the church believes and they go
[1:04:53] on right like that and go through life
[1:04:54] call themselves Christians and go on
[1:04:57] with the things of the world and then
[1:04:59] when they come to God they say well my
[1:05:01] faith saves me I said to a man some time
[1:05:03] ago I said sir didn't the Lord ever
[1:05:05] continue for that smoking oh he said no
[1:05:09] and I said I have seen you drink myself
[1:05:11] he said but look at your preacher I'm
[1:05:13] going to tell you something I visited
[1:05:16] another man in the room he said my faith
[1:05:18] saves me
[1:05:19] I said but Mister let me tell you
[1:05:21] something now faith without works is
[1:05:24] dead
[1:05:25] and I said the Holy Spirit don't live a
[1:05:27] life like that see and I said you may be
[1:05:31] disappointed I said now the Faith's all
[1:05:33] right but if the works don't follow the
[1:05:36] faith and the Faith's no good and when
[1:05:38] you die it remember it doesn't change
[1:05:40] your spirit
[1:05:42] it only changes your dwelling place and
[1:05:45] whatever type of spirit you got in you
[1:05:47] that's a place it will go to
[1:05:50] and sin can never enter Heaven
[1:05:53] so if you you say well I confess mine
[1:05:56] every night we got a prayer book and
[1:05:58] when we go to church we confess all of
[1:06:00] our sins and turn right back around and
[1:06:02] do them again
[1:06:04] turn right back to the next day God
[1:06:05] forgive me for drinking forgive me for
[1:06:07] committing adultery forgive me for lying
[1:06:09] forgive me for stealing turn right back
[1:06:11] and do the same thing forgive me for
[1:06:13] getting drunk last week you didn't mean
[1:06:14] to drink that much turn right background
[1:06:16] drink it again well that's not that
[1:06:18] shows that something hasn't changed
[1:06:20] inside
[1:06:21] you're trying to paint the outside kind
[1:06:24] of whitewash it but what it needs to be
[1:06:26] done is put in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:28] and washed white instead of white water
[1:06:31] that's that's what the world needs today
[1:06:35] but then we find out then that because
[1:06:39] it Saul took upon himself Samuel was a
[1:06:43] little late one day to offer the burnt
[1:06:45] offerings which is only legal for him to
[1:06:47] do on the inspiration of God and Saul
[1:06:50] said why do we have to wait on him he
[1:06:52] wasn't already to sell he started
[1:06:54] Leading the People himself instead of
[1:06:56] letting God lead the people that's where
[1:06:58] he made his mistake that's where every
[1:07:00] church that's ever been organized yet
[1:07:02] made their fatal mistake I've never seen
[1:07:05] an organization I've I've took history
[1:07:08] I've read all the way from the Preen I
[1:07:11] seen fathers and Josephus and all the
[1:07:14] early historians I've never seen one
[1:07:16] time or a church ever come into a great
[1:07:19] spiritual Revival and fell and got away
[1:07:22] from it it ever rose again
[1:07:25] I want you to show me where is that
[1:07:27] God if they won't follow the light God
[1:07:29] will lay it right up on the shelf and
[1:07:31] let somebody God's able these stones to
[1:07:33] rise children on Abraham
[1:07:36] Luther was a lot of his day but they got
[1:07:39] a group in there that Lutheran Church
[1:07:40] and twisted the scriptures around to
[1:07:42] make it fit their own Theology and the
[1:07:44] first thing you know the Lutheran Church
[1:07:45] was on the shelter Revival was over God
[1:07:48] raised up the Methodist the Methodist
[1:07:50] come out with sanctification had a great
[1:07:52] Revival World sweeping one of the
[1:07:54] greatest the world's ever had in the
[1:07:56] days of of John Wesley and a great
[1:08:00] Revival swept the land but time John and
[1:08:02] Charles and Asbury and all those died
[1:08:05] off we got a new group in there began to
[1:08:07] think a lot about well we ought to do
[1:08:09] this a blood religion and all this kind
[1:08:11] of stuff and the first thing you know
[1:08:13] they begin to bring in all kinds of
[1:08:14] Creeds and things and now of course that
[1:08:16] laying on the Shelf
[1:08:19] oh yes and the Pentecostal has done the
[1:08:22] very same thing that they did just
[1:08:24] exactly
[1:08:26] going away of All Flesh yes you want to
[1:08:29] be like the world don't be like the
[1:08:31] world we are different
[1:08:33] Servants of God are different they're
[1:08:36] born again they're new creatures in
[1:08:38] Christ you have no right to take the
[1:08:41] kings of the world and mix it with
[1:08:43] Christianity
[1:08:45] the Christian robes not made up of
[1:08:47] church made Theology of the Christian
[1:08:49] robes made up of the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost and nothing less than that
[1:08:54] and our life to follow that baptism of
[1:08:57] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:58] makes you live right do right act right
[1:09:00] talk right live right
[1:09:03] that is true
[1:09:05] but then when Saul wouldn't wait on the
[1:09:08] Lord no more
[1:09:10] Samuel turned right away from him
[1:09:11] remember as the first time not the
[1:09:15] second time but the first time that Saul
[1:09:18] took upon himself to take over the
[1:09:20] service of the Lord Samuel turned his
[1:09:23] back on him and walked away from him
[1:09:26] and the first time that the church lets
[1:09:30] their leaders take over to lead the
[1:09:32] people the Holy Spirit gets right away
[1:09:34] from them and the very first time that
[1:09:37] you go and being led by a man instead of
[1:09:39] God the holy spirit will get away from
[1:09:41] you too
[1:09:41] [Applause]
[1:09:43] let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we
[1:09:45] need his leadership and God gave us a
[1:09:48] leader and we don't get it
[1:09:51] you're not long ago I was reading in the
[1:09:53] brother Gene brought it to me I believe
[1:09:55] and one of the magazines about a geese
[1:09:58] leaving Canada
[1:09:59] and they have a leader and if this
[1:10:02] leader isn't a real good leader they
[1:10:04] haven't picked a good one
[1:10:05] he'll take them anywhere take them over
[1:10:07] the mountain way and they'll all die
[1:10:09] you're some time ago a bunch flew up an
[1:10:12] old Gander they didn't know where he was
[1:10:14] going didn't know his directions
[1:10:17] his Instinct wasn't just right
[1:10:19] he flew a bunch of geese all the way to
[1:10:21] England they've never been able to come
[1:10:24] back
[1:10:25] they their nature is the migrant every
[1:10:28] year and they just get together and
[1:10:30] squawk and holler and carry on over
[1:10:32] there in England and they don't know how
[1:10:33] to get back home
[1:10:35] put cinnamon is some of these cold
[1:10:37] formal borgs that we got today get so
[1:10:40] far away from God you don't know how to
[1:10:42] get back you'll never come back by
[1:10:44] Creeds you've got to have inspiration to
[1:10:47] lead your brother and that inspiration
[1:10:49] comes by the Holy Ghost
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:53] yes letter the spirit Sons and Daughters
[1:10:57] of God are led by the spirit of God they
[1:11:00] love the spirit they don't try to say
[1:11:02] now wait a minute in my church so don't
[1:11:03] say Amen
[1:11:05] my church didn't ever raise their hands
[1:11:07] they're very quiet while we'd give our
[1:11:09] pastor chills and fever of somebody
[1:11:11] heart amen we are chilling up once in a
[1:11:13] while find out what would take place
[1:11:16] that's right what we need today is a
[1:11:18] good old heart felt religion let me tell
[1:11:21] you something if a baby is born and that
[1:11:23] baby don't cry
[1:11:25] it don't wind it don't open his little
[1:11:28] mouth and say a thing
[1:11:29] nothing happens what's the matter with
[1:11:32] that baby he's born dead
[1:11:34] I think we got too many still bursts
[1:11:36] today uh in a church father come up and
[1:11:39] say to you believe God the Father
[1:11:40] Almighty creator of heavens and earth
[1:11:41] Jesus Christ his son yes I do will you
[1:11:44] promise to do so and so for this church
[1:11:45] yet he's a little salt shaken a few
[1:11:47] little drops of water get in the right
[1:11:48] hand of Fellowship put him in the church
[1:11:50] that's stillborn babies
[1:11:52] yeah that's right
[1:11:55] what do you happen to a baby when he's
[1:11:56] born if you don't cry as soon as he
[1:11:58] drops into the Earth what's the first
[1:12:00] thing you do to him is pick him up turn
[1:12:03] him over your arm and give him a little
[1:12:05] um what did you call it
[1:12:07] the paddling
[1:12:09] that's right give him a few wraps like
[1:12:11] that and the first thing you know he'll
[1:12:14] go and you got a baby living and that's
[1:12:17] what it needs today in the church it's
[1:12:19] not somebody saying now I know it might
[1:12:21] not be all right to do that little
[1:12:23] sissified thing
[1:12:26] you need a man behind the pulpit that'll
[1:12:29] tell you that'll tell you the pieces
[1:12:31] tell you how to get to squall it up once
[1:12:34] in a while and let God come in here to
[1:12:36] let something take place
[1:12:38] then you're born
[1:12:40] as somebody a baby around your sins and
[1:12:43] say oh well that our our forefathers
[1:12:45] believe that our forefathers our Bible
[1:12:48] said it's right that's what's right's
[1:12:50] our Bible and the same holy ghost that
[1:12:52] fell on the day of Pentecost which we
[1:12:54] all know that that was the birth of the
[1:12:56] new church if that same Holy Spirit
[1:12:58] don't bring the same experience to you
[1:13:00] then you've got a different Holy Spirit
[1:13:01] from what that was
[1:13:03] exactly we don't make you live a
[1:13:06] sacrificial life in a life full of joy
[1:13:09] and pleasure in the baptism of the
[1:13:10] spirit leading you into signs and
[1:13:12] wonders and miracles and things that
[1:13:13] something happened
[1:13:15] Jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:13:19] that believe
[1:13:20] look how they perverted it today when
[1:13:23] man leave here's a good church member oh
[1:13:25] I know he does this oh I know he does
[1:13:27] that but he's a deacon in the church and
[1:13:29] uh he does this and that the other but
[1:13:31] I'll tell you he's certainly when we
[1:13:33] come time for we us to have our
[1:13:35] missionary program never fails to put in
[1:13:37] a 500 check and if we got a repair to do
[1:13:40] oh he's a fine fella then stand there
[1:13:42] with your collar turn around and preach
[1:13:44] his funeral someday over a half-mast
[1:13:46] play say he's gone to heaven
[1:13:48] that's a simple thing let me tell you
[1:13:51] something what we need today is New
[1:13:54] Birth New Life
[1:13:59] what a difference
[1:14:00] a man just said that long ago a preacher
[1:14:03] told me that he had to take a memory in
[1:14:05] his church secretly said he's a good man
[1:14:07] but said he just couldn't stand out
[1:14:09] before that audience and be brought into
[1:14:11] church that I I had to take him into the
[1:14:13] prayer room in the back and take him
[1:14:15] into the church secretly so what do you
[1:14:17] think about that Billy I said I'd have
[1:14:19] turned him now straight George and
[1:14:20] kicked him as hard as I could that's the
[1:14:21] way I'll tuck him in trying
[1:14:24] I was going down to the river here some
[1:14:26] time ago to baptize a woman and there's
[1:14:29] a whole group going along with me and so
[1:14:31] the woman going along there she said
[1:14:33] brother Brandon I said yes
[1:14:35] she said well I finally decided for you
[1:14:38] go down and duck me
[1:14:39] so what's in
[1:14:40] she said you're going to fix me up and
[1:14:43] said induct me aren't you and I said no
[1:14:44] ma'am
[1:14:45] before I do that I said you got to get
[1:14:47] your heart right with God I wouldn't
[1:14:49] baptize you on no conditions you're
[1:14:50] still alive in the world yet you got to
[1:14:52] be dead we only buried dead people those
[1:14:55] who are dead in Christ and ready to rise
[1:14:58] to New Life again and a person make a
[1:15:00] remark like that against baptism is the
[1:15:03] fit candidate for water baptism
[1:15:05] right
[1:15:07] well that's where we go we find out the
[1:15:10] spirit
[1:15:11] Saul said I'll do it myself I know how
[1:15:13] to do it I know as much about as that
[1:15:15] Old fogy Samuel and Samuel had proved
[1:15:18] that he was a servant of God he proved
[1:15:20] that the Holy Spirit was with him for he
[1:15:22] said I'll take you to record this day
[1:15:25] have I ever spoke to you anything in the
[1:15:27] name of the Lord but what come to pass
[1:15:29] have I ever come begged and bummed money
[1:15:32] from you and all these great things no
[1:15:34] they said you haven't done that but
[1:15:36] still we want to have it the way we want
[1:15:37] it see and that's then to see what they
[1:15:40] were getting then now we find out then
[1:15:43] when a man rejects the leading of the
[1:15:46] Holy Spirit you know what God did for
[1:15:48] Saul he'd give him an evil spirit to
[1:15:50] lead him
[1:15:53] how about that
[1:15:56] he give him an evil spirit God gave him
[1:15:59] an evil spirit to lead him
[1:16:01] so when a man rejects the leading of the
[1:16:05] Holy Spirit or any person rejects the
[1:16:08] leading of the Holy Spirit you've got a
[1:16:10] devil on you to lead you
[1:16:12] exactly the Bible
[1:16:14] oh God I wish we could have a Revival I
[1:16:18] wish there could come a time that when
[1:16:20] the Holy Spirit could really get into
[1:16:22] the hearts of the American people again
[1:16:23] that they would see it's him
[1:16:26] hey you want to look say well now look I
[1:16:28] can cooperate this meeting because my
[1:16:30] church don't what difference does that
[1:16:32] make
[1:16:33] what's that got to do with it well I'll
[1:16:35] tell you uh they believe in this and we
[1:16:38] don't believe that as long as they're
[1:16:39] preaching the Bible and the whole Bible
[1:16:41] and the Full Gospel and nothing but the
[1:16:43] truth listen to it as long as you're led
[1:16:47] by the spirit believe in it and God will
[1:16:50] make himself known if a man is led by
[1:16:52] the spirit of God God will make himself
[1:16:54] known to that person
[1:16:56] yes sir God promised to so in doing that
[1:16:59] we know then that the Holy Spirit leads
[1:17:01] the people and God takes care of it amen
[1:17:06] you believe that with all your heart
[1:17:08] certainly we do all right then I'd like
[1:17:11] to say another thing that evil spirit
[1:17:12] begin to lead Saul and it led him and
[1:17:16] today when the holy spirit's rejected it
[1:17:19] once it what will it do you'll get an
[1:17:21] evil spirit to lead you now listen I
[1:17:23] don't want to hurt you but I want you to
[1:17:25] get this
[1:17:27] see
[1:17:28] just as it was in them days so is it
[1:17:31] today
[1:17:33] they don't want the Holy Spirit to lead
[1:17:35] him so they get an evil spirit what
[1:17:37] takes place with the evil spirit the
[1:17:39] evil spirit is won't still eat wants to
[1:17:41] lead them then and now what they don't
[1:17:43] want they didn't want God to be their
[1:17:46] judge
[1:17:47] and people today don't want the Holy
[1:17:51] Spirit to judge them
[1:17:53] that's the reason they turned Samuel
[1:17:54] down because his judgment was of God it
[1:17:57] was scriptural and he didn't want to be
[1:17:59] led by the spirit and they turned it
[1:18:01] down for an ecclesiastical man and what
[1:18:05] did he get an evil spirit to lead him
[1:18:07] now the people today don't want to be
[1:18:09] led by the Holy Spirit they don't want
[1:18:11] the Holy Spirit to judge them now that's
[1:18:14] true friends
[1:18:15] they don't want the Holy Spirit to judge
[1:18:17] you then people said to me a woman said
[1:18:19] to me not long ago I was preaching real
[1:18:21] hard and I was balling the sisters Opera
[1:18:23] cutting their hair and telling it the
[1:18:26] Bible said that she was a prostitute if
[1:18:28] she did so she is unfair to her husband
[1:18:30] and he had a right to put her away just
[1:18:33] exactly what the scripture says any
[1:18:35] woman that'll cut her hair off of her
[1:18:37] head she dishonors her husband the Bible
[1:18:39] said which is her hand and you can
[1:18:41] preach to him that lady met me outside
[1:18:43] and she said let me tell you something
[1:18:45] right now preacher you're sure going to
[1:18:47] ruin your ministry I said any Ministry
[1:18:49] that the word of God will ruin ought to
[1:18:51] be ruined that's exactly right
[1:18:54] he said well she said everybody walk
[1:18:56] away and leave you I said as long as he
[1:18:57] stays with me that's the main thing you
[1:18:59] see let him stay and uh sure they don't
[1:19:04] want the people you don't because they
[1:19:05] want to be like the world they don't
[1:19:07] want women don't want to dress like the
[1:19:09] people of God decent moral well here a
[1:19:13] few weeks ago I went to a Pentecostal
[1:19:16] meeting now you Baptists get ready to
[1:19:18] shouting Presbyterians
[1:19:20] I went to one of the leading Pentecostal
[1:19:22] churches of the United States
[1:19:25] and my associate and I was sitting there
[1:19:27] I was going to have a Sunday morning
[1:19:29] service
[1:19:31] I am one they know that I'm always
[1:19:33] against that kind of stuff and then when
[1:19:36] they let Sunday school out I was sitting
[1:19:37] out there in a parking lot here come the
[1:19:40] Sunday School teachers no no that is
[1:19:42] that ain't the Methodist that's Penny
[1:19:44] calls real shark Bob there and make up
[1:19:47] all of their Facebook like they've been
[1:19:49] eating red beef steak and got all over
[1:19:50] their fingernails and and all out like
[1:19:53] that all that paint manicure on them
[1:19:55] walking out there and here come man my
[1:19:56] age with that big pop hair cutting
[1:19:59] ducktaled in the back like that brother
[1:20:01] if I had a congregation like that I'd
[1:20:03] sure tear them to Pieces brother it sure
[1:20:05] would be yes sir oh they want to go
[1:20:08] stainless now the Holy Roller preached
[1:20:10] and then claimed to be Teddy talk
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] I got a friend a Sunday school teacher
[1:20:18] can I say good morning Reverend Brandon
[1:20:20] and all the that red stuff on the face
[1:20:23] and this Black Pencil over their eyes
[1:20:25] and and all the and dress so sexy like
[1:20:29] and they say well now wait a minute
[1:20:31] brother Brandon that's the only kind of
[1:20:32] clothes you can buy they still sell
[1:20:34] goods and sewing machines so they're
[1:20:36] they're not a bidding excuse for you
[1:20:37] that's right if you're led by the Holy
[1:20:40] Spirit straighten up they don't want the
[1:20:43] Holy Spirit to judge them
[1:20:45] I don't want there's no excuses God
[1:20:47] won't listen to your excuses he wouldn't
[1:20:50] listen to songs he won't listen to you
[1:20:52] you've got to compare with what the
[1:20:54] Bible said
[1:20:55] I think any woman ought to be clean she
[1:20:58] ought to look her best any man ought to
[1:21:00] to look pretty and clean but be decent
[1:21:02] you know if you dress yourself just that
[1:21:05] old clothes that people wearing them old
[1:21:06] shark since woman said to me sometimes
[1:21:09] said brother I don't wear them shorts
[1:21:10] that I wear slacks I said that's worse
[1:21:13] it's worse you know what God said it's
[1:21:17] an abomination in the sight of God for a
[1:21:20] woman to put on a garment that pertains
[1:21:22] to a man
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:24] God is God and never changes he's the
[1:21:27] infinite God if it once made a sickening
[1:21:29] stake and smell before him it still
[1:21:31] makes a stick and stink and smell
[1:21:33] they'll see a woman put on her garment
[1:21:36] pertains to a man he made man man and
[1:21:38] made women
[1:21:41] if he doesn't preach it that way that's
[1:21:43] what the Bible said Zachariah oh they
[1:21:45] don't want that
[1:21:47] one lady said to me said what do you
[1:21:49] think it's wrong for a woman to wear
[1:21:51] some this makeup I said yes sir I do I
[1:21:54] sort of face God never heated me what
[1:21:56] you want you to look like he's a barn he
[1:21:58] had a major Barn I said all painted up
[1:22:00] like that
[1:22:01] if he wants you to smoke it put a smoke
[1:22:03] stack on top maybe some flu so she could
[1:22:05] breathe it out
[1:22:06] but he he give you lungs to breathe good
[1:22:10] fresh air that's what he did it for
[1:22:13] but they don't know but they don't want
[1:22:16] nobody they want Holy Spirit to judge
[1:22:18] him now if you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:19] can still live that way you come to me
[1:22:21] and tell me you got the Holy Ghost
[1:22:22] living like that uh I can't be your
[1:22:24] judge but according to the word you
[1:22:26] misaligned somewhere brother
[1:22:29] that's exactly what the spirit says see
[1:22:32] that's right we need back Holiness again
[1:22:34] brother we need to come back to God yes
[1:22:37] they reject it certainly they do they
[1:22:39] don't want to know how that they don't
[1:22:41] want to uh come out of the jurisdiction
[1:22:44] of the Holy Spirit they don't want the
[1:22:46] spirit to guide them let me tell you
[1:22:48] something ladies I'm not making fun of
[1:22:50] you this is no place for that this is
[1:22:52] the place where judgment goes for and
[1:22:54] judgment has to go right and judgments
[1:22:56] by the word of God looking there was
[1:22:58] only one woman in the entire Bible that
[1:23:01] ever painted her face
[1:23:04] that's right
[1:23:05] one woman and she never painted her face
[1:23:07] to meet God
[1:23:09] she paint her face to meet a man to try
[1:23:11] to Vamp him
[1:23:13] that's right
[1:23:16] Jezebel you know what God did for her he
[1:23:19] fed her to the dogs
[1:23:21] that's right so when you see a woman
[1:23:23] wearing makeup you say that's Miss dog
[1:23:25] meat that's exactly what it is for God
[1:23:27] he fed her to the dogs so that's all
[1:23:29] she's fit for we're dogs he fed her to
[1:23:33] the dogs how many knows that's the truth
[1:23:34] Say Amen
[1:23:36] that's exactly right so you see how
[1:23:38] those Heathen traits get into the church
[1:23:40] is to call some lukewarm son of Kiss
[1:23:43] stands behind the pulpit and is afraid
[1:23:45] of his kneel ticket to preach the truth
[1:23:47] brother let me tell you we need man
[1:23:50] behind a Pulpit and not a bunch of
[1:23:52] theological sissies that's afraid of
[1:23:54] something to say to the people we need
[1:23:56] man of Courage good man filled with the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost that stands there that will
[1:24:01] not preach sissified stuff in Creeds and
[1:24:04] denomination but will preach the gospel
[1:24:06] and shut the hide off of them it's
[1:24:08] exactly right
[1:24:10] right you little old kids in our Junior
[1:24:13] honey don't you do that get you a stick
[1:24:16] and skinny
[1:24:20] look what you raised up out of that
[1:24:22] Junior honey little Marth you know stomp
[1:24:24] her feet and tell her Manny you go shut
[1:24:26] up I ain't gonna do that oh boy good
[1:24:29] thing they didn't have my daddy
[1:24:32] I'm trying
[1:24:34] yes sir
[1:24:35] all this stuff see what you got a bunch
[1:24:37] of juvenile idiots
[1:24:39] just exactly what you got insane just
[1:24:43] said that for insane sound filling up
[1:24:45] with him
[1:24:45] beat next that's why I call it Junior
[1:24:48] deer the Bible said if you spare the rod
[1:24:50] you spoil your son
[1:24:52] that's right God knows what's truth and
[1:24:55] what's best
[1:24:57] Samuel tried to tell Saul that God knows
[1:24:59] what was best but Saul said well the
[1:25:02] people want me that's that's it as long
[1:25:04] as you get somebody to follow him that's
[1:25:06] all he wanted he used Samuel's name and
[1:25:09] get somebody to follow him that's all he
[1:25:11] wanted no they don't want that real true
[1:25:14] gospel they don't want that real truth
[1:25:16] don't want the Holy Spirit to um
[1:25:19] to guide them they'd rather have the
[1:25:22] intellectual pastor see now here's the
[1:25:25] kind of man they want somebody they
[1:25:27] don't what they want somebody that'll
[1:25:28] not tell them it's wrong to do this or
[1:25:30] wrong to do that to quit doing this and
[1:25:32] quit doing that no they don't want that
[1:25:34] but they want a man that's got a
[1:25:36] Theological Seminary experience that
[1:25:38] they can say he's got several degrees
[1:25:39] and he stands up very nicely and he
[1:25:42] dresses very Natalie which is perfectly
[1:25:44] all right but when he gets there he kind
[1:25:46] of does their own interpretation of the
[1:25:48] Bible uh not according to the Bible but
[1:25:50] according to some theological seminaries
[1:25:52] experience instead of a baptism of the
[1:25:55] Holy Ghost down to him to make him shut
[1:25:57] the hide off that's exactly right amen
[1:25:59] tell me a prophet in the Bible it was a
[1:26:01] true Prophet it didn't shut the high at
[1:26:03] all tell me whatever come to pass they
[1:26:06] didn't want to believe him then but God
[1:26:07] give them signs and wonders to follow
[1:26:09] him to make the people to vindicate that
[1:26:11] their Ministry was right it's always
[1:26:13] been that way the Holy Spirit today
[1:26:15] comes right down in the church and said
[1:26:16] these signs shall follow them at least
[1:26:18] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[1:26:20] speak with new tongues take up serpents
[1:26:22] or drink do anything lay hands on the
[1:26:24] sick and they shall recover on the day
[1:26:26] of Pentecost is fully come there's all
[1:26:28] in one place in one Accord selling there
[1:26:29] came a sound from heaven like a Russian
[1:26:31] Mighty Wind it filled all the house
[1:26:33] where they were setting cold and tongue
[1:26:35] set up on them like if far there was all
[1:26:37] filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to
[1:26:38] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:26:39] gave them utterance
[1:26:41] out into the streets they went screaming
[1:26:43] and dancing and acting like drunk people
[1:26:45] Justice and remember you Catholic people
[1:26:48] the Blessed Virgin Mary was among them
[1:26:51] and if she couldn't go to heaven without
[1:26:53] getting that kind of experience how are
[1:26:55] you going to make it
[1:27:00] there she was all full of the Holy
[1:27:05] scratch your shorter Pentacles
[1:27:07] now what do they do today take you bring
[1:27:10] us some old war out later from four or
[1:27:11] five different churches that's had it
[1:27:13] placed it down there and sets in a
[1:27:14] church and called you a member
[1:27:16] their soul that's exactly what he did
[1:27:20] but Samuel wanted to be led of God these
[1:27:23] people go to church on Sunday morning a
[1:27:25] pastor could interpret the word they go
[1:27:27] right back out there and do what they
[1:27:28] want to through the week he tells them
[1:27:30] they go home after he's given the
[1:27:31] interpretation of a few things in the
[1:27:33] church and to say a few Creeds they go
[1:27:35] home kind of a half satisfied consoling
[1:27:37] themselves all my religion is done it's
[1:27:40] all right till next week I'll go down
[1:27:41] again take the communion on Sunday
[1:27:43] morning some
[1:27:45] bread and grape juice and so forth and
[1:27:47] whatever they do and let it go like that
[1:27:49] oh brother
[1:27:51] but now what did Saul do he certainly
[1:27:55] made a great Army he certainly did he
[1:27:58] brought Israel to a great Army he made
[1:28:00] them all with fine polished Spears he
[1:28:03] trained him with them Spears to fight
[1:28:04] just this right real Gallant man he bit
[1:28:07] him all big shields and everything they
[1:28:09] were real polishing trained all to the
[1:28:12] very minute well they were getting along
[1:28:13] fine the rest of the nation looked out
[1:28:15] and said you know Israel's coming along
[1:28:16] pretty good but one day one day God
[1:28:21] don't let it go too long
[1:28:22] yeah
[1:28:23] until one day there came a Challenger
[1:28:27] by the name of Goliath
[1:28:29] folded his arms and Israel shook to
[1:28:32] their shoes were trimming on the ground
[1:28:34] that old Head and Shoulder above all the
[1:28:37] rest of them shook with him too there he
[1:28:39] stood he never seen such a thing the
[1:28:42] spirit had to take over the god of
[1:28:43] Israel had to show its power
[1:28:45] oh yes there'll be a glass somewhere
[1:28:49] we've had one not long ago we've got
[1:28:52] some today I don't understand why we've
[1:28:54] got the greatest intellectual the best
[1:28:56] dressed crowds we've got the best
[1:28:58] theological seminaries some of the
[1:29:00] finest trained man that ever come out
[1:29:01] they've trained choir so they can sing
[1:29:03] How Great Thou Art to archangels
[1:29:06] couldn't compare with him Harley oh
[1:29:08] they're training the very best of
[1:29:09] schools and everything like that knowing
[1:29:11] all about it but when it comes to the
[1:29:13] time of the supernatural they know
[1:29:14] nothing of it baby
[1:29:17] dogs had a challenger out
[1:29:19] the show which was right to show that
[1:29:22] that thing was wrong brother I say this
[1:29:24] with Godly love and respect one of our
[1:29:26] sons of Kish Head and Shoulders above
[1:29:29] all the other evangelists was called by
[1:29:30] mohammer the other day and challenged to
[1:29:32] the word of God
[1:29:34] and trailer these shoes and left the
[1:29:36] ground
[1:29:37] oh my
[1:29:39] what's the matter it was something
[1:29:41] besides theology it had to bring this
[1:29:44] Supernatural power of God into it
[1:29:47] he know nothing about it
[1:29:50] same as it was in the days of Saul but
[1:29:52] listen you True Believers in Christ you
[1:29:55] true Christians that believe in God in
[1:29:57] the Supernatural all the time Saul was
[1:30:00] training this big army and all these
[1:30:01] intellectuals coming up God had a little
[1:30:03] David out there somewhere
[1:30:06] feeding his father's sheep on sheep food
[1:30:10] the word
[1:30:12] not on theological weeds
[1:30:17] he had to be standing by when that
[1:30:19] happened
[1:30:20] oh my they want to give him a seminary
[1:30:23] experience Saul said come here maybe my
[1:30:25] arm would fit you he said take the thing
[1:30:27] off on me well I'll make you a bachelor
[1:30:30] of Art and give you a doctor's degree he
[1:30:32] said I don't know nothing about it take
[1:30:34] the thing off of me but let me tell you
[1:30:37] something I've got this slingshot well
[1:30:39] that's no comparable but look here one
[1:30:41] day a lamb was out there feeding one of
[1:30:44] my father's sheep
[1:30:45] was out there feeding and a lion come in
[1:30:48] and got it and packed it off and I took
[1:30:51] this slingshot and I trusted in the god
[1:30:53] of Israel and I went at him and I
[1:30:55] knocked him down and slew him and
[1:30:56] brought that lamb back
[1:30:59] is that a bear come in and got a kid and
[1:31:01] started off with him one of my fathers
[1:31:03] and I put the rock in a sling shop
[1:31:04] that's a little bitty thing but uh I
[1:31:06] want to answer him I wasn't trusting
[1:31:08] this thing shot but I was trusting in
[1:31:10] the power of the god of the Israel amen
[1:31:13] what is that
[1:31:16] f-a-i-t-h-i-n-j-e-s-u-s that's right
[1:31:18] trusting in the power of the god of
[1:31:20] Israel and I'll knock that bear down
[1:31:22] took the line the little sheep out of
[1:31:24] his mouth and took it back
[1:31:26] he said how much more I'm a Deliverance
[1:31:30] Minister I know what I'm talking about
[1:31:32] listen he's got some little Davids in
[1:31:34] the world today they not be being
[1:31:36] recognized but Sauls that's true but
[1:31:39] there's some little Davids in the world
[1:31:40] that's pastoring and feeding God's sheep
[1:31:43] sheep food and one day a great big
[1:31:45] cancer coming and got one the doctor
[1:31:48] said well he's gone
[1:31:49] but the little David said I don't know
[1:31:51] ain't got very much just a prayer of
[1:31:53] faith but I'm coming after you because
[1:31:54] you're my father's sheep I got faith
[1:31:57] Hallelujah
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:03] that was a paralytic stroke hit one he
[1:32:05] said I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:32:07] it but I'm coming after you you're one
[1:32:09] of my father's sheep
[1:32:11] Hallelujah don't reject the king of
[1:32:14] Israel
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:22] [Applause]
[1:32:28] thank you
[1:32:33] he didn't have very much but he had
[1:32:36] faith in the god of Israel
[1:32:38] I'll tell you they had rejected they had
[1:32:40] all their choirs and trained scholars in
[1:32:42] theology but when it come for the
[1:32:44] supernatural they were stunted they
[1:32:46] didn't know nothing about it why didn't
[1:32:48] David know the Scarlet man because he
[1:32:50] was feeding another Pastor that's right
[1:32:53] he was training under another atmosphere
[1:32:54] one day uh
[1:32:57] a sickness coming and he got one
[1:32:58] father's sheep was going to take it to a
[1:33:00] premature grave these little David said
[1:33:02] I don't know how I'm going to do it they
[1:33:03] said oh nonsense that little slingshot
[1:33:05] um I don't know how to do it but it's a
[1:33:07] promise and I got faith in it so I'm
[1:33:08] coming ahead to that lamb and he brought
[1:33:10] it back Hallelujah
[1:33:13] oh come on
[1:33:16] what we need tonight is to get away from
[1:33:19] all of this man-made Theology and bring
[1:33:22] the key back
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:27] yes sir
[1:33:32] don't you worry
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:34] they were afraid to publish the meeting
[1:33:36] in South Africa Joseph already did it
[1:33:39] when ten thousand muhammads sat there
[1:33:42] and seen a little twisted boy all
[1:33:44] twisted up like that Marvel up to the
[1:33:46] platform not even in his right mind on
[1:33:48] the scene the Holy Spirit tell him who
[1:33:50] he was what happened and what done it
[1:33:52] and when he got through praying he
[1:33:53] straightened up like a man like that 10
[1:33:55] 000 muhammads laid their trophies to the
[1:33:58] ground and accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:34:00] personal savior
[1:34:01] yes sir
[1:34:03] look at Tommy Osborne Oral Roberts men
[1:34:06] who feed the flock on sheep food
[1:34:11] the days of Miracles has not passed that
[1:34:13] says the theologians
[1:34:15] if the days of Miracles just passed the
[1:34:17] day of God has passed
[1:34:18] God is a miracle
[1:34:20] certainly they are sheep food oh my poor
[1:34:25] dejected friend
[1:34:27] the devil might have took you sister out
[1:34:29] down to a place where you never do
[1:34:31] desire to let your hair grow might get
[1:34:33] you to a place where you think that some
[1:34:34] Pastor is nonsense when he's preaching
[1:34:37] you pure Holiness the way you should
[1:34:38] dress some of you man out there it goes
[1:34:41] around and does these things that you
[1:34:43] ought not to do and you man that'll let
[1:34:45] your wife do a thing like that and smoke
[1:34:47] cigarettes I've got little respect for
[1:34:48] you even as a man that's exactly right
[1:34:51] you know a man's ahead of the house

[1:35:02] man's not judged by how many muscles
[1:35:03] he's got that's Beast a man's not judged
[1:35:06] by the brawny muscles but he's judged by
[1:35:08] the begs and the knees of his pants
[1:35:10] where he's been praying that's what
[1:35:11] takes a man a man is character not beast
[1:35:15] but character I've seen man that weighed
[1:35:17] 200 pounds and have an ounce of man in

[1:40:04] wonderful things full of things that
[1:40:07] that that take it and and and and make
[1:40:11] us strong and that's what we want
[1:40:13] we won't we don't want the Holy Spirit
[1:40:15] to lead us
[1:40:17] the Living God
[1:40:19] the spirit move and we want to be honest
[1:40:22] with one another and if we need a touch
[1:40:24] from the Lord we we want to take the
[1:40:28] time to provide the the presence of the
[1:40:32] Lord but maybe tonight uh I I if the
[1:40:36] musicians would come and and um
[1:40:41] and
[1:40:41] we just ask ourselves he said we've come
[1:40:45] to bring you back
[1:40:49] you know so you know we all of us in our
[1:40:53] lives
[1:40:55] go through times that we get we call it
[1:40:58] backslid
[1:40:59] or lukewarm
[1:41:02] or cold and indifferent
[1:41:05] and I I know for a fact I always think
[1:41:08] of what the messenger told us he said
[1:41:11] you know if you don't sit in that
[1:41:12] presence and you don't drink in that
[1:41:15] water
[1:41:17] he said you you're you're wind up just
[1:41:20] like a cactus
[1:41:22] and all that thorn on the cactus is he
[1:41:26] said it was a leaf that got so lack of
[1:41:29] water that it just turned up and got
[1:41:33] sticky
[1:41:35] and the only way to come
[1:41:40] to unwind is to get into the presence of
[1:41:43] the Lord
[1:41:44] and come back to the presence of the
[1:41:47] Lord
[1:41:48] come back to daily devotion
[1:41:51] come back
[1:41:52] come back to what's right
[1:41:55] come back to brotherly kindness
[1:41:58] thinking what the other ones go through
[1:42:00] so let's stand this evening
[1:42:04] but really if you'd pick a song to sing
[1:42:07] and
