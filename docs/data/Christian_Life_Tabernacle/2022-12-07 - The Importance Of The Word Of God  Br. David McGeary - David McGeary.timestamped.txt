[35:39] Lord You're our counselor

[35:51] Lord we've come tonight to
[35:54] Fellowship around your word to
[35:58] have you fulfilled the desire of our
[36:01] heart
[36:03] to meet our needs father as we journey
[36:06] through a world that we're not a part of
[36:12] we're not even from here Lord
[36:15] we're in this world but we're not of it
[36:19] [Music]
[36:22] Lord it pushes us
[36:24] farther away and
[36:27] [Music]
[36:29] wants to isolate us
[36:34] build fences around us
[36:39] but Lord we don't look to the world for
[36:41] our strength
[36:43] we don't look to the world for our
[36:46] living we don't look for the world to
[36:48] our substance father for you promised us
[36:52] that the righteous would never bake
[36:54] bread
[36:55] father and we rest tonight in your
[36:59] your sovereignty
[37:01] in your all supreme power
[37:04] and your Eternal plan we just ask that
[37:08] you would be with us in our fellowship
[37:09] tonight
[37:10] that we could enjoy your word in Jesus
[37:14] precious and wonderful name we pray amen
[37:20] and amen God bless you if you have your
[37:22] Bibles let's turn
[37:25] to the gospel of Saint John and read
[37:29] that first verse and very familiar verse
[37:34] and
[37:35] and uh
[37:37] we just want to have some fellowship
[37:41] most of my thoughts tonight are coming
[37:45] from the sermon uh the spoken word is
[37:49] the original seed and the first few uh
[37:54] pages of that message which is uh
[37:58] a pretty encompassing message
[38:01] it covers a lot of ground and and I was
[38:06] only able to get one or two pages so
[38:10] we might play parts of it as we go
[38:13] around but it just something that's on
[38:14] my heart that I trust will bless you
[38:17] this evening in the beginning was the
[38:20] word
[38:21] and the Word was with God and the Word
[38:25] was God Heavenly Father we ask you to
[38:28] bless your word and your precious name
[38:30] we pray amen amen you may be seated
[38:41] this weekend as many of you know
[38:45] we were had flown to
[38:50] Maryland
[38:52] to Rockville Maryland area to perform
[38:57] the
[38:59] funeral and the graveside services
[39:03] for Brother David Salinas and you know I
[39:08] had a tremendous
[39:10] experience there
[39:13] um
[39:14] you know the service came and you know
[39:17] the Lord will reach out to you and he'll
[39:20] put the scripture on your heart and
[39:24] um and you just you know it's the word
[39:27] so but when I when uh we showed up at
[39:32] the funeral I believe it was in
[39:35] some form of maybe a presbyterian or
[39:41] some form of denominational Church
[39:44] but the exciting part of it is the crowd
[39:48] was absolutely made up probably of 90
[39:52] percent unbelievers
[39:54] and I have to just be honest with you
[39:57] the stimulation of preaching this gospel
[40:01] to people who have never heard it before
[40:05] it was absolutely magnificent
[40:09] and when when you begin to see the word
[40:13] of God just unfold and you see people
[40:17] that have never heard it the majority of
[40:20] them are Catholics and and we talked
[40:23] about the scripture and and God's word
[40:27] not changing and we used our texts from
[40:31] the 24th chapter of Luke
[40:34] and that's the chapter when the ladies
[40:39] approached the tomb and they enter in
[40:43] the Tomb and there's two men they're two
[40:46] angels and they say he is not here
[40:51] why do you seek the living amongst the
[40:54] dead and we took the text that he's not
[40:57] here
[40:58] so where is he
[41:00] and the the hope that we have
[41:04] for eternal life and how that it was
[41:08] never God's intention that man die the
[41:12] first man would have never died
[41:15] of it by sin
[41:19] that death came
[41:20] and but the gift of God is eternal life
[41:24] through Christ Jesus and you know when
[41:28] you go back to the Simplicity of the
[41:30] Gospel what it was that really saved you
[41:33] what it was that really made a
[41:39] difference in you and there's there's no
[41:42] way that uh
[41:45] they would ever receive life without the
[41:49] word of God or faith cometh by hearing
[41:53] and hearing by the word of God
[41:57] and as we looked on to this uh you know
[42:02] is almost like uh having the opportunity
[42:05] to introduce the Bible
[42:08] to people who have always mostly been to
[42:11] masked who the only thing they know
[42:14] about can
[42:16] forgiveness of sins is a confessional
[42:20] and a Hail Mary and and to tell them
[42:23] that there's a sacrifice paid for their
[42:26] sins and that there's a book
[42:28] and this book
[42:30] is the word of God
[42:34] and the prophet of God goes through this
[42:37] in the in the message uh spoken word
[42:41] uh is the Original Seed and we know that
[42:46] uh the the great thing about God's word
[42:49] is God's words
[42:52] Eternal right in other words it it
[42:56] doesn't it didn't have a beginning it
[42:59] didn't have an end it's it's
[43:03] Eternal and and that's why even today so
[43:06] many thousands of years after that Jesus
[43:10] had come so many thousands of years
[43:13] after man had put this in print people
[43:16] can still read this scripture today and
[43:20] have it come to life
[43:21] you can exhaust God's word
[43:25] amen youth you can't study it tell you
[43:28] know it you can't uh uh because it's
[43:32] like a Looking Glass it's it's like a uh
[43:36] if I I just don't have a vocabulary but
[43:39] the word of God's like a portal that
[43:42] allows you to look into things that were
[43:45] you've never seen before open up New
[43:48] Dimensions to you open up new thinking
[43:51] to you open up new possibilities to to
[43:55] you it it's something that's that's
[43:58] beyond and and when you begin to put
[44:01] periods on it and you begin to look at
[44:04] it like it's Academia like it's a com
[44:07] it's a complete work well if it's
[44:10] Eternal it's not a complete work in fact
[44:13] it'll take Eternity for God to reveal
[44:16] himself he's it'll be a continual
[44:19] revelation of of of being there with him
[44:23] so the first thing we know that God's
[44:26] word is eternal so it so when you read
[44:31] the scriptures you never want to read it
[44:33] like a history book you never want to
[44:36] read it like like it's it's Doctrine or
[44:40] like it's teaching but you you need to
[44:42] read the scripture like it's the
[44:44] revelation of his personality it fits
[44:48] him wanting to introduce himself to you
[44:52] to have a greater relationship to have a
[44:56] a to show you things that you've never
[44:59] seen before you know it's not the same
[45:04] old bacon and eggs every morning you
[45:07] know what I mean act and if the same
[45:10] thing you know I had a little bit of a
[45:14] Costco chicken tonight and I ate that
[45:17] Costco chicken and I said you know
[45:19] something I've eaten so much Costco
[45:21] chicken I know what it tastes like it's
[45:24] got a certain taste about it it's got a
[45:27] certain thing I'm so glad that the word
[45:30] of God you never can get tired of God's
[45:33] word amen if you approach it right it'll
[45:37] feed you it'll it'll it'll I don't know
[45:40] how to say it forgive my word but it'll
[45:43] create a flavor for just what you have
[45:46] need of
[45:47] amen it's it's like honey if it's sweet
[45:50] it's it's beautiful even the correction
[45:54] of God's word is sweet because you
[45:57] realize that it saves you from trouble
[46:00] it saves you from disaster it's the
[46:04] tender handed Jehovah leading you and
[46:07] and and and being there for you
[46:11] amen God speaks to you through his word
[46:15] and the reason that he can speak to you
[46:18] through his word today because the word
[46:21] that he spoke is eternal
[46:25] so in other words it covers all time and
[46:29] space
[46:31] I know many of you have started maybe
[46:34] have a Bible that uh you've I hope
[46:38] you've wore out more than one Bible you
[46:42] know but I know when you have a Bible I
[46:44] had my first uh my first Bible that I
[46:47] got that was the Scofield bible they
[46:51] told me that this was the type of
[46:54] brother Brandon the Bible the first one
[46:56] he had well pretty soon it wasn't the
[46:58] complete word anymore because I'd lost
[47:00] pages and I still holding it together
[47:03] and it didn't have a cover and I send it
[47:06] out to be bound again and if and you
[47:10] just don't want to give up on it but
[47:12] pretty after a while it looked like you
[47:15] know I marked in yellow and then I try
[47:17] to Mark him blue and Mark in this and
[47:19] Mark in that and pretty soon you know
[47:22] what it just you looked at it and he was
[47:25] just a mass of color because you thought
[47:28] you read it
[47:31] you know what I mean and you mark it in
[47:33] yellow and then the next time it's new
[47:35] to you and you underline it and then you
[47:38] read it another time in this new to you
[47:40] and you Circle it and pretty soon you
[47:43] ask yourself did I ever read this book
[47:45] in the first place
[47:48] but we know that this is a new book to
[47:50] us
[47:51] it's a brand new book to us and we don't
[47:55] have to Journey outside of God's word
[47:58] we've just got to learn how to read it
[48:02] and you don't read it you read it by
[48:06] listening to it when you read it let the
[48:08] word of God speak to you let the
[48:11] scripture speak to you go to listen hear
[48:14] ye him uh a sermon was preached he said
[48:17] we do all the Talking you know we just
[48:20] got to stop and here he am God speaks
[48:22] back to you in his word you know you a
[48:25] lot of times you'll have a prayer you'll
[48:27] pray and ask God for something
[48:29] and if you're just patient and you read
[48:32] your Bible every day and you pray every
[48:34] day most of the time your answers come
[48:38] back to you through the scriptures
[48:42] because he can't they can't change
[48:46] so that's another great thing we know
[48:49] about God's word is it can't change it
[48:53] can't be improved upon
[48:56] he can't go back and rethink it because
[48:59] he's God and and so if he thought it in
[49:03] the first place it's right all the way
[49:06] through
[49:07] he can't improve on it he can't come up
[49:10] with a new idea because every idea that
[49:15] was the word of God was eternal
[49:18] I mean there's nothing to compare it to
[49:22] there's nobody it's even the scripture
[49:25] says whom among you have counseled God
[49:28] or can say to God why have you done thus
[49:31] or or have done this that's what makes
[49:35] him God he's Sovereign he's in control
[49:38] he can do what he wants to do when he
[49:41] wants to do it and the greatest thing
[49:43] why it's Eternal because when he spoke
[49:46] his word he he he had a purpose in mind
[49:50] so we know that he can't change it it
[49:53] can improve upon it he'll never go back
[49:56] and and go back on it he'll never ever
[49:59] say I didn't mean that
[50:01] right that's right
[50:03] he means what he says
[50:06] and he'll stand behind it if you believe
[50:10] it he'll be there to prove it to you God
[50:13] because the prophet of God said in his
[50:15] spoken words original see he says God's
[50:18] honor
[50:20] his honor he's the Fountain of all honor
[50:23] he said his honor
[50:27] obligates him to stand behind his word
[50:31] and if he could take it back then he
[50:34] wouldn't be God it's okay so we know
[50:37] that that God's uh once it's spoken it
[50:41] can never die
[50:43] it can never die it it it continually it
[50:48] continually goes on
[50:51] it's okay it's Eternal and and so we we
[50:54] realize that it's it's just a lot of
[50:57] people they get to the place they don't
[50:59] understand the word of God they they
[51:02] they don't look at it for for being God
[51:07] you know they've got God up here but
[51:09] this is God in word form if you if you
[51:13] uh if if by the spirit of God and and
[51:17] and that's why a lot of times it's
[51:20] really important that you spend a little
[51:22] bit of prayer before you go into the
[51:24] scriptures and get into the spirit
[51:28] that's where John was he was in the
[51:31] spirit on the Lord's day you know okay
[51:34] and what does it mean to get in the
[51:36] spirit it means to separate yourselves
[51:38] from the burdens of the world separate
[51:40] know that in this scripture God's going
[51:43] to talk to you you're going to find your
[51:46] answers you're going to find instruction
[51:47] all the word of God is given for
[51:50] instruction for reproof and Sunday dies
[51:53] and diverse manners God spoke this
[51:56] through His prophets the spirit of God
[51:58] moved upon him
[52:00] so we really have something in in God's
[52:03] word and and it's beautiful and so you
[52:08] when when you begin to look at what it
[52:11] means that this word is eternal you know
[52:13] uh like the a lot of times the people
[52:16] get hung up by evolution
[52:21] you know they'll they'll say well we
[52:23] went and found a rock
[52:25] that's 20 million years old
[52:29] and you know
[52:32] I I it looks like a rock to me
[52:35] you know I don't know which rocks are 20
[52:37] million years in which rocks aren't 20
[52:39] million years I don't think they do
[52:41] either
[52:42] but you know man's always trying to
[52:44] impress one another so there they say
[52:46] well we carbon dated it and we have all
[52:49] this so that proves that the the Bible
[52:52] is not true
[52:55] did you ever need this because three
[52:57] Genesis 1 1.
[53:03] it's marvelous
[53:05] how the scripture unfolds when you have
[53:09] a message that interprets the word of
[53:12] God to you
[53:14] amen that's what men do men interpret
[53:17] the word of God to themselves
[53:20] God's meaning of God's words never
[53:22] changed
[53:24] amen it's just that man's takes their
[53:26] own thinking but we know that God
[53:29] interprets his word by bringing it a
[53:32] path and and so a lot of a lot of our
[53:35] students a lot of times in school and
[53:38] high school and college they'll get
[53:40] approached and they'll talk about
[53:43] Evolution and they'll talk about uh you
[53:46] know something being solo the Bible says
[53:48] that the world was created in seven days
[53:51] no that's not what the Bible says
[53:55] they just don't read the Bible
[53:58] in fact they jump over the first verse
[54:02] the first verse of the Bible simply says
[54:04] in the beginning God created the heavens
[54:08] and the Earth
[54:12] okay it was all created
[54:17] he created the heavens and the Earth
[54:19] period
[54:21] in the beginning God created the
[54:24] beginning of everything was when God
[54:28] created it not when some some
[54:31] molecule out here bumped into another
[54:34] molecule and they had some Big Bang
[54:37] Theory
[54:40] well where did the you know I mean it's
[54:43] just
[54:44] well they they choose to be ignorant
[54:49] they do they choose to be ignorant but
[54:53] the scripture simply says in the begin
[54:55] God created heavens and earth period
[54:57] everything was created then
[55:01] okay where was it it was in his mind it
[55:05] was in his thinking right and then the
[55:08] very next verse it says and the Earth
[55:11] was without form and void
[55:16] so it was still in thought form
[55:21] it was still in if I could say this in
[55:23] mind form
[55:25] like someone who's got who's like uh do
[55:28] we we've heard like in the message
[55:30] called the Masterpiece where the artist
[55:32] had something in his mind and and now he
[55:36] he he he was going to take this block of
[55:41] stone and and work on it and bring what
[55:45] that he had in mind to life well God
[55:48] didn't need a block of stone he created
[55:51] what he had in his mind and so the
[55:55] scripture just simply says in the
[55:57] beginning God created it he had a plan
[56:00] he had if I could say this a thought
[56:04] and that's what it was the thought was
[56:06] there and when the thought was there
[56:09] that was the creation of God and then
[56:11] the next scripture says and the Earth
[56:13] was without form
[56:15] and void in other words that that proves
[56:19] that it was still in thought form it
[56:21] hadn't taken on form yet
[56:27] we we've let man
[56:31] and Theology and religion and
[56:35] denominations put all the interpretation
[56:38] to the word of God
[56:42] now hold that there
[56:45] we've allowed them to to tell us what it
[56:49] means in the scriptures here and the
[56:51] next verse says and and there was
[56:54] Darkness upon the face of the Earth
[56:57] in other words it hadn't been revealed
[57:00] yet
[57:03] it was without former void there wasn't
[57:05] Darkness like you saw it but it hadn't
[57:08] been made known until some of these
[57:10] revealed to you you're in the dark Until
[57:14] It's Made known you're in the dark so
[57:16] there was Darkness on the earth it
[57:18] wasn't made known yet what the plan of
[57:21] God was what the word of God was was it
[57:24] made known the words always existed
[57:28] it's eternal
[57:31] but there came a time that he decided he
[57:34] would share it with man
[57:38] oh Hallelujah
[57:40] I like that
[57:43] we could go
[57:45] right into the uh three uh uh objectives
[57:50] of God
[57:52] right to reveal himself to have
[57:55] preeminence to bring us back to where we
[57:58] were in the beginning and so it was in
[58:02] darkness it was it was without form it
[58:04] without voice in other words none of it
[58:06] had been revealed yet none of it had
[58:09] been made known yet and that's what even
[58:12] today it's based on Revelation
[58:17] God had to reveal it
[58:20] by bringing it to pass right and then
[58:24] the next scripture says and it's
[58:26] beautiful says and the spirit of God
[58:29] moved upon the face of the waters
[58:33] then he started making it known
[58:36] and however long it took him to do it
[58:41] that was him
[58:43] but nothing's ever contrary to the word
[58:46] of God the word of God is always right
[58:50] in fact the word of God is the original
[58:57] it's it's the original
[59:01] and so we know that it it it's it it's
[59:05] the original and so because it it's the
[59:09] original thing the only thing that's
[59:12] original and genuine
[59:15] is the word of God
[59:18] that's what the original is everything
[59:21] else is a a hybrid from that in other
[59:26] words it's been changed
[59:29] but the word of God is exactly the same
[59:31] so another queen God God's word had an
[59:36] eternal purpose
[59:38] that purpose has never changed it had an
[59:42] original purpose
[59:45] now man tries to change the purpose
[59:49] man tries to change the direction
[59:52] man is so bold that they'll tell you
[59:55] what God meant
[59:58] this is what God meant you know how God
[1:00:02] shows you what he meant
[1:00:04] by doing what he says
[1:00:08] could you imagine us sitting around
[1:00:10] trying to describe light
[1:00:16] well that's the trouble when when the
[1:00:18] scripture says light everybody thinks of
[1:00:21] the Sun
[1:00:23] you would think that Edison was already
[1:00:25] there
[1:00:28] that God had been Franklin and Edison
[1:00:31] there that's not the light he was the
[1:00:34] light of the world
[1:00:36] he said let there be light
[1:00:39] that just wasn't son that wasn't the
[1:00:42] moon of stars that was let there be
[1:00:44] something that was going to reveal the
[1:00:48] Eternal purpose of God let there be
[1:00:50] something that could get Revelation let
[1:00:52] there be something that could open
[1:00:54] something up that would show light he
[1:00:57] was the light of men he was the light of
[1:00:59] the world let there be light in the
[1:01:02] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:01:04] with God and the Word was made flesh
[1:01:08] Glory what a wonderful word
[1:01:12] it had an eternal purpose
[1:01:15] it had an eternal plan
[1:01:19] he's Alpha and Omega
[1:01:22] he's the beginning
[1:01:25] and the end
[1:01:30] the only way you can have a beginning in
[1:01:32] the end
[1:01:33] I only know building
[1:01:36] is you have to have a blueprint
[1:01:41] and as the world was progressing
[1:01:45] God through Prophets
[1:01:48] would
[1:01:49] provide a page to the blueprint
[1:01:53] he would provide the next step
[1:01:57] where do I go from here
[1:02:00] that's for all of us who never read the
[1:02:02] instructions
[1:02:06] you know when they say do this before
[1:02:08] you do that they're usually right
[1:02:12] now I think they make those instructions
[1:02:14] just to get you
[1:02:16] but I don't know their motives and
[1:02:18] objective but I know one thing that God
[1:02:20] has no evil
[1:02:22] his thoughts from good and what he does
[1:02:25] is simple it's simple
[1:02:28] just stay
[1:02:29] with the word so it has a plan
[1:02:34] you are saying so if we could understand
[1:02:36] if we could get in the plan
[1:02:40] then the plan will unfold itself and
[1:02:44] produce the product but you've got to
[1:02:47] follow it step by step like you've got
[1:02:49] to repent
[1:02:51] right that that's the first step uh the
[1:02:55] as we heard last week that the First
[1:02:58] Gospel of the first doctrine that Jesus
[1:03:01] preached was you must be born again
[1:03:04] so look there's a there was a step there
[1:03:07] was a plan we know there was a plan
[1:03:09] sanctification I mean justification
[1:03:12] sanctification filling of the spirit
[1:03:15] everything God's word had a plan but it
[1:03:18] was an eternal plan
[1:03:21] it wasn't a temporary plant it wasn't
[1:03:24] just a plan to get you out of the world
[1:03:27] it was a plan to bring you all the way
[1:03:29] back to where you were in the beginning
[1:03:33] they just follow me through for a few
[1:03:35] minutes this morning and and and the
[1:03:38] word had
[1:03:40] Eternal timing
[1:03:43] every age
[1:03:46] every hour
[1:03:48] every time a Believer came in sometimes
[1:03:51] we wonder well why do they come in so
[1:03:54] late why did God everything's got
[1:03:56] Eternal timing everything's purpose the
[1:03:58] prophet of God explained it like a watch
[1:04:00] where every little part has to move to
[1:04:04] make it he he's got all of that planned
[1:04:10] you know we just keep trying to rebuild
[1:04:12] the watch
[1:04:14] or we don't like the part we're playing
[1:04:18] we don't think our part's important our
[1:04:20] part's important it's important you
[1:04:23] might be going through a trial you might
[1:04:24] be going through a hard time God knows
[1:04:27] that he timed that
[1:04:29] it's got an outcome it's got a purpose
[1:04:32] because if you're part of the word then
[1:04:35] you've got an eternal purpose if you're
[1:04:37] a part of the word you're part of the
[1:04:39] Eternal plan if you're part of the word
[1:04:41] then you're part of the timing
[1:04:44] all the players and and all the and all
[1:04:49] the the players and the people they all
[1:04:53] had their place
[1:04:57] in other words nothing's out of kilter
[1:05:00] as evil as this world is
[1:05:03] and as maddening as it is
[1:05:07] and as morally corrupt as it is it's all
[1:05:11] according to the word of God
[1:05:14] that's right
[1:05:16] and the Lord will have Vengeance on whom
[1:05:18] he'll have Vengeance and he'll have
[1:05:21] mercy on whom he's mercy so we we
[1:05:24] understand that the word then is the
[1:05:27] only thing that's an original and it's
[1:05:29] the only thing that will last
[1:05:35] nothing hybrid
[1:05:37] can last I'd like just to read the book
[1:05:40] I have doesn't have paragraphs so uh
[1:05:44] it's it's in the old book A Spoken Word
[1:05:48] is the Original Seed uh it was preached
[1:05:51] in a 318. he says
[1:05:56] he says now that's why we believe it and
[1:06:00] it is the word of God therefore God's
[1:06:05] spoken word is original
[1:06:09] it's the only thing that's original
[1:06:13] original means the first
[1:06:17] the start
[1:06:20] there's a lot of witness we World call
[1:06:22] it knockoffs
[1:06:26] you know what I mean like uh you've got
[1:06:29] there's a lot of Rolex watches out there
[1:06:32] they look like Rolexes you know they you
[1:06:35] know but they're not Rolexes because
[1:06:38] they're not the original they're a
[1:06:40] knockoff
[1:06:41] everybody wears a knockoff nowadays
[1:06:44] they'll have a knock knock off Louis
[1:06:46] Vuitton or a knock off this that could
[1:06:50] you know I I thought the best knockoff
[1:06:52] was guests
[1:06:54] guess whether it's a knockoff or not
[1:06:59] they're not original
[1:07:03] why is society so based on a fake
[1:07:09] even their life is fake
[1:07:13] I like the idea of aging cream
[1:07:19] that's what I'm gonna go buy me four or
[1:07:21] five buckets of aging cream and I'm not
[1:07:24] going to get old no more
[1:07:25] who believes that stuff that's fake
[1:07:30] you're gonna age I'm sorry
[1:07:35] you're corrupting while you sit there
[1:07:40] it's the truth
[1:07:41] I'm not saying it to be funny I'm just
[1:07:44] saying that that you it lets you
[1:07:47] understand
[1:07:48] that everything that's not the original
[1:07:53] doesn't last because it's only the
[1:07:56] original is the word and that's the only
[1:07:59] thing that's eternal
[1:08:01] so just follow me through for just the
[1:08:03] next few moments I'd like to read this
[1:08:06] he said now why we believe that it's the
[1:08:10] word of God therefore God's spoken word
[1:08:13] is original
[1:08:15] and everything that God created
[1:08:19] spoke into existence is original oh you
[1:08:24] found it wonderful
[1:08:27] okay that's the original
[1:08:31] what God spoke into existence maybe it
[1:08:34] hadn't arrived yet
[1:08:37] you understand what I'm saying we don't
[1:08:41] live we don't look in a rear-view mirror
[1:08:43] we don't follow history
[1:08:46] we have a living savior
[1:08:49] the prophet of God preached leadership
[1:08:51] because he didn't want man to be looking
[1:08:55] back in history and teaching you history
[1:08:58] when he's here to lead you
[1:09:04] well I was fellowship with the brothers
[1:09:06] that command used to say I like the way
[1:09:08] he put it as we are felonyship he said
[1:09:11] we only have what's right before us
[1:09:16] we don't even have yesterday
[1:09:22] leave those things which are behind
[1:09:24] behind and press
[1:09:26] for the higher calling
[1:09:29] so we can't we we can't look back
[1:09:37] so we're just greeting here is the
[1:09:39] original you can't hybrid something of
[1:09:43] his creation he said you can't hybrid
[1:09:46] something of his creation secondarily
[1:09:50] that's the reason Eve could do what she
[1:09:53] did
[1:09:53] with her own seed because she wasn't in
[1:09:57] the original creation
[1:10:00] now he prefaced that because he didn't
[1:10:02] want the sisters
[1:10:04] to to miss it
[1:10:07] all of us are hybrid
[1:10:13] we're born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:10:16] come into this world speaking lies just
[1:10:18] follow this down it's beautiful
[1:10:21] she said she was a byproduct of man not
[1:10:25] in the creation of God God created the
[1:10:28] whole thing and then he took a part of
[1:10:31] his creation and made a helpmate
[1:10:35] that's the reason you can hybrid a
[1:10:39] donkey and a horse
[1:10:41] but it won't
[1:10:43] last
[1:10:47] so what do we have now
[1:10:49] we have the hype bird of Education we
[1:10:52] have the hybrid of science what are they
[1:10:55] doing they're mixing stuff of the world
[1:10:57] they're taking chemicals and and they're
[1:11:00] mixing this and they're mixing ideas and
[1:11:02] they're coming up with what uh what we
[1:11:05] call inventions or or all this other
[1:11:08] stuff but what's the one thing we know
[1:11:10] about it none of it is original
[1:11:16] it wasn't in the original plan therefore
[1:11:19] it'll pass Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:11:22] away but my word will never pass away
[1:11:28] just follow this down because it's
[1:11:30] beautiful is that
[1:11:33] she said that's the reason you can
[1:11:36] hybrid a donkey and a horse but it won't
[1:11:39] last it's death
[1:11:41] but the original has got life
[1:11:45] it comes back
[1:11:48] again
[1:11:51] okay the other has no way back
[1:11:55] you understand they don't have a way
[1:11:57] back
[1:11:58] so you breed something you hybrid
[1:12:00] something you mix it but it can't come
[1:12:03] back in other words a mule which is the
[1:12:05] mixture between a horse and a donkey has
[1:12:08] no way back to becoming a horse or a
[1:12:13] donkey again
[1:12:16] no way back
[1:12:19] anything that's hybrid
[1:12:23] dies
[1:12:25] it's got no life in it it can't last
[1:12:31] eventually it'll uh fizzle out
[1:12:37] because they just can't keep going
[1:12:42] that's why you notice something will
[1:12:43] start
[1:12:44] and it just Fizzles out
[1:12:49] I mean I look at things when I when I
[1:12:51] when the prophet God said that I thought
[1:12:53] about a man is always trying to
[1:12:55] substitute something for the original
[1:12:58] I thought a Cabbage Patch dolls
[1:13:02] well people were killing one another
[1:13:05] in a department stores for a doll
[1:13:10] every little girl had to have that kind
[1:13:12] of baby doll
[1:13:14] why because they hybrid to where they
[1:13:17] don't even want to have children no more
[1:13:19] they're trying to substitute children
[1:13:21] with fake
[1:13:24] it's fake
[1:13:29] that's all Satan's offering you
[1:13:32] cool
[1:13:34] the life Satan has to offer is not real
[1:13:37] it's not original it'll die but just
[1:13:41] follow this thought through he says
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:45] can't come back again I hope you can see
[1:13:48] it now the original has the life so
[1:13:52] that's the reason I think that Cults and
[1:13:56] denominations and organizations die
[1:14:01] history proves they are everyone dead
[1:14:06] they never do rise no more
[1:14:10] they come to a place and they fizzle out
[1:14:15] the Revival goes away
[1:14:19] they just become a system
[1:14:22] they're stuck in it there's no place for
[1:14:24] them to go
[1:14:26] they're dead
[1:14:29] the Catholic church is doing the same
[1:14:31] old thing the same old thing every
[1:14:33] service saying the same prayers same the
[1:14:36] same thing you talk about dead
[1:14:42] whoever believes that you reach God by
[1:14:45] running beads through your hands that's
[1:14:48] how blind that's what happens when
[1:14:51] something's not original that game what
[1:14:53] does a hybrid mean it means mixing
[1:14:56] and so he goes on here he says this he
[1:14:59] says the original has life so that's the
[1:15:02] reason I think Cults and denominations
[1:15:04] and organizations die history proves
[1:15:07] that everyone dead they never did rise
[1:15:10] no more they never will they can't breed
[1:15:14] themselves back
[1:15:19] so the fire
[1:15:21] and the Zeal they started with like
[1:15:24] Luther
[1:15:26] they can't breed themselves back to that
[1:15:31] because it's mixed they mixed it and now
[1:15:36] it can they can't breed themselves back
[1:15:38] they can't get back they can't get back
[1:15:40] what do you think when they're all gonna
[1:15:43] go try to buy oil for
[1:15:45] because they ran out of light they can't
[1:15:48] get back they have no place to go they
[1:15:51] know they're dead and they know they're
[1:15:53] dying and their gospel cannot meet the
[1:15:57] challenge of the hour
[1:16:01] they can't keep their marriages together
[1:16:03] they can't keep their children together
[1:16:06] they can't keep drug addiction out that
[1:16:09] can't keep alcoholism out they even
[1:16:11] can't even keep the thieves out
[1:16:17] they have no safety
[1:16:19] they have no protection
[1:16:21] they call on a God that can't hear them
[1:16:26] because you can only meet God in one
[1:16:29] place
[1:16:30] it's under the shed blood
[1:16:33] and they've got a hybrid substitute for
[1:16:36] the shed blood
[1:16:39] and it'll never work
[1:16:41] do you understand they want to get back
[1:16:44] but they can't get back
[1:16:47] through a hybrid system because the
[1:16:51] system because the hybrid can't
[1:16:54] reproduce itself
[1:16:56] it's the end of the strain
[1:17:01] oh I can't wait I'm going to read this
[1:17:05] and then I'm going to read a few other
[1:17:06] quotes that's going to make me get
[1:17:08] excited
[1:17:10] I'm trying to be calm
[1:17:14] they never did rise no more
[1:17:17] they never will they can't breed
[1:17:19] themselves back got nothing to breed
[1:17:22] with
[1:17:22] they are sterile that's why Eve's
[1:17:26] children
[1:17:28] die
[1:17:33] we've got nothing to get eternal life
[1:17:35] with
[1:17:40] the end of the road
[1:17:43] man has reached the end of the road
[1:17:47] they know it
[1:17:49] there's a gem on every corner
[1:17:53] there's stores full of vitamins there's
[1:17:56] advertisements there's creams there's
[1:17:59] shots there's there's this there's that
[1:18:02] what is it
[1:18:04] they're exploring space
[1:18:07] the Earth is dying
[1:18:10] man's dying everything that's hybrid's
[1:18:14] dying it's dying you see it dying our
[1:18:18] country's dying our artists are
[1:18:22] our politics are dying our Educational
[1:18:26] Systems dying everything's thing you
[1:18:28] don't think education's thing they don't
[1:18:30] have to go to school no more they got a
[1:18:33] machine
[1:18:34] that thinks for them
[1:18:39] oh don't be at a table with anybody and
[1:18:42] give out a fact that you think you might
[1:18:44] have heard
[1:18:45] they're going to Google you
[1:18:50] well ain't no Google gonna hold me down
[1:18:55] I didn't get what I got from Google
[1:19:01] that's right you know what I mean
[1:19:02] Google's gonna end
[1:19:05] well I tell you I think if the whole uh
[1:19:08] I don't know what you call internet or
[1:19:10] Cloud if it crashed I think there'd be
[1:19:12] Mass suicides
[1:19:14] people wouldn't even know how to get
[1:19:16] home
[1:19:18] people drive home every day of their
[1:19:21] life they'll get in their car and
[1:19:22] they'll say navigate home because if
[1:19:24] that crazy woman ain't talking to them
[1:19:26] they don't know how to drive
[1:19:30] that's true
[1:19:31] it's dying
[1:19:34] it's dying do you hear me it's dying
[1:19:37] that's why Eve's children die
[1:19:40] education's dying they can't do it
[1:19:43] they're trying to bail out every loan
[1:19:45] and everything because it's all gone
[1:19:50] it's over
[1:19:52] because hybrid can't bring it back a
[1:19:55] mule can't get back to a donkey I can't
[1:19:58] get back to a horse it it just can't get
[1:20:01] you know a hybrid religion can't get
[1:20:04] back
[1:20:05] right
[1:20:07] now I want you to listen to this
[1:20:09] beautiful thing this is what excited me
[1:20:12] in closing tonight
[1:20:15] and and I just think that maybe we'll
[1:20:18] we'll
[1:20:20] just go uh
[1:20:24] will go on he says
[1:20:28] and this is out of the tape that we just
[1:20:32] listened to the the meanest man I know
[1:20:36] that that was a 127-62
[1:20:41] and uh
[1:20:43] and he's talking about
[1:20:46] uh Jesus here
[1:20:48] perhaps preaching a sermon and uh and
[1:20:54] and trying to get the people to
[1:20:57] understand that he was the way
[1:21:01] the truth
[1:21:03] and the life
[1:21:06] and that no man cometh unto the father
[1:21:10] but by him
[1:21:15] men are putting their faith in religion
[1:21:19] in popes and priests in movements and
[1:21:23] anointings
[1:21:26] but there there's no substitute because
[1:21:29] in the beginning was the word he was the
[1:21:33] original
[1:21:36] he was the what second Adam
[1:21:40] he was what was in Adam
[1:21:45] the life that was in Adam the word life
[1:21:48] of God Adam was the first Son of God the
[1:21:52] Son of God the life that Adam had came
[1:21:54] from God it didn't come from nobody else
[1:21:58] it was the father expressed in flesh
[1:22:02] now the second Adam the first Adam was a
[1:22:05] living Soul the second Adam was a what
[1:22:09] a quickening spirit which means he could
[1:22:13] bring you to life
[1:22:16] oh yeah that's right hey
[1:22:20] that's what he is
[1:22:23] he's not an object of of worship for
[1:22:27] religion
[1:22:30] he's a life-giver
[1:22:33] I am the resurrection and the life I am
[1:22:38] the way the truth no man comes unto the
[1:22:41] father but me in other words I have what
[1:22:45] was the original I am the original in
[1:22:49] the beginning what's the word and the
[1:22:51] Word was with God and the original was
[1:22:54] made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:22:58] to do what
[1:23:02] because we're hybrid
[1:23:06] we can't get back
[1:23:09] we can't breed ourselves back we can't
[1:23:12] religion ourselves back we can't get
[1:23:15] back we're lost the only thing we
[1:23:18] produce is more crime
[1:23:21] more mental illness more diseases
[1:23:26] tell me it ain't true
[1:23:30] we've got more medicines now than we
[1:23:32] ever had why
[1:23:36] I think it is like the who what comes
[1:23:38] first the chicken or the egg I think
[1:23:40] they make the disease and then they get
[1:23:42] a medicine to rip you off
[1:23:48] I think a lot of people if they sit down
[1:23:50] and read the Bible a half hour a day
[1:23:51] there'll be a lot less mental depression
[1:23:54] in this world
[1:23:57] but what is he
[1:23:59] he's the original
[1:24:04] and this was his message
[1:24:06] right
[1:24:08] so he's talking about Jesus preaching he
[1:24:11] says he might as paragraph 34. he might
[1:24:14] have went back to Genesis and began and
[1:24:16] said in the beginning God said let there
[1:24:20] be
[1:24:21] and there was
[1:24:24] and he said let everything
[1:24:27] that I have spoken bring forth of its
[1:24:30] kind
[1:24:31] and it did
[1:24:34] then he might have brought something
[1:24:36] like this saying well now
[1:24:39] to bring forth but yet you can't take
[1:24:42] these seeds and you can't mix them
[1:24:45] together
[1:24:47] you can't get what's called a hybrid
[1:24:49] product beautiful very nice but it isn't
[1:24:54] original
[1:24:57] you you let it go it'll go back to its
[1:25:01] kind again
[1:25:04] in other words it has no life it has no
[1:25:08] future
[1:25:09] it has no hope
[1:25:12] education is fine
[1:25:14] don't don't put your trust in education
[1:25:19] most education gets you to the Grave
[1:25:21] quicker
[1:25:29] killing this world
[1:25:31] a hybrid product can never stand
[1:25:35] the roughness
[1:25:37] and the treatment
[1:25:39] that the original can stand
[1:25:45] why an old Longhorn
[1:25:48] would starve one of your herffords to
[1:25:51] death
[1:25:52] out on the Prairie in the wintertime
[1:25:56] she could make her own way like a deer
[1:25:59] but your hybrid Hereford your hybrid
[1:26:03] Brahma Angus it'd die out there you have
[1:26:07] to Baby them
[1:26:09] right and he he was standing today I
[1:26:13] believe he'd say something like this to
[1:26:16] us
[1:26:16] not only have we hybrid fruit
[1:26:19] animals
[1:26:21] that we've hybrid religion
[1:26:24] it has to be babied and petted
[1:26:27] or it it's not original
[1:26:30] we try to take the word of God and breed
[1:26:34] it into something else and breed it over
[1:26:37] here and it becomes a bunch of uh
[1:26:40] delicate babies that we have to baby and
[1:26:44] they can't take the real word he might
[1:26:48] have
[1:26:49] been saying something like that
[1:26:52] now I want you to I want oh
[1:26:57] he's sitting there saying he might be
[1:27:00] saying something like that
[1:27:03] but it's him
[1:27:06] saying something like that it's him the
[1:27:10] original
[1:27:12] the original word
[1:27:14] the original gospel
[1:27:17] he's preaching the original
[1:27:21] he says he might have said this see
[1:27:24] really your lives are hard bread
[1:27:28] all of us are hybrid
[1:27:31] you understand that so there's got to
[1:27:33] have to be something take place in order
[1:27:36] to get us out of this condition
[1:27:40] we can't religion ourselves out of it
[1:27:45] we can't join together and call
[1:27:48] ourselves the message the elect the
[1:27:52] bride we're the ones that's going
[1:27:57] you can't do it
[1:28:00] you can't
[1:28:02] you can't imagine it
[1:28:07] just follow with me for a second as we
[1:28:10] continue reading
[1:28:13] he says like you can't he says a donkey
[1:28:16] and breed a horse he said the same thing
[1:28:18] with corn it's beautiful
[1:28:21] but Readers Digest and these hybrid
[1:28:24] things are doing the people cancer and
[1:28:27] everything else hybrid chickens they say
[1:28:30] that 20 years it isn't stopped it'll
[1:28:35] happen women can't have babies no more
[1:28:37] they're becoming stronger closing up
[1:28:40] smaller in the hips and then they were
[1:28:43] and can't have the babies leaving leave
[1:28:46] things the way they are
[1:28:51] let God alone that's the way
[1:28:55] with his word leave it like it is don't
[1:28:59] try to add something to it to fit a
[1:29:03] Creed just keep it the way God said it
[1:29:05] believe it that makes a husky strong
[1:29:10] Christian not a baby that has to be
[1:29:13] denominational baby petted around
[1:29:17] a letter from church one denomination
[1:29:20] the other when he puts his name on the
[1:29:24] book in heaven it's settled forever
[1:29:30] it's already been settled let's just
[1:29:32] read this next paragraph
[1:29:36] he says
[1:29:38] so we know it can't go back that's what
[1:29:41] he does when he gives you a new
[1:29:44] birth
[1:29:46] why do you have to be born again
[1:29:50] because you're hybrid
[1:29:56] you can't add him to this life
[1:30:02] you've got to be born again
[1:30:05] now that's not a scary thing
[1:30:10] because if you see it
[1:30:12] you asked for it
[1:30:14] you admit I can't do this I can't make
[1:30:16] it I need something I need you Lord
[1:30:21] I need your life I need your spirit I'm
[1:30:23] at a dead end
[1:30:26] I can't bring myself back
[1:30:29] it's right
[1:30:30] and that's what religion is religion is
[1:30:33] man trying to bring himself back and
[1:30:37] they can't do it the only thing that can
[1:30:40] bring man back is the original it's got
[1:30:43] to be the original
[1:30:46] let's just read it's beautiful
[1:30:49] he says
[1:30:52] he said
[1:30:54] uh
[1:30:58] he says if that settles its Ferry Jesus
[1:31:01] might have said now in order to get back
[1:31:04] to the original God has
[1:31:08] to speak
[1:31:10] again
[1:31:14] in order to get back to the original the
[1:31:18] original word has to be spoken again
[1:31:24] not a different word
[1:31:27] the original word
[1:31:29] so the hybrid has no life in it
[1:31:33] so the only way to get his elected back
[1:31:36] to get his seed back to get those that
[1:31:40] are part of him eternally back is he has
[1:31:43] to speak the original again
[1:31:48] come on
[1:31:50] listen it's beautiful
[1:31:55] that's what he does when he gives you
[1:31:59] New Birth
[1:32:04] what's the new birth
[1:32:07] when he speaks the original to you again
[1:32:12] it's not an emotion
[1:32:15] it's not an anointing that falls on the
[1:32:19] just and the unjust but it's when he
[1:32:21] speaks again the original word to you
[1:32:26] again follow it through now that's what
[1:32:30] he does when he gives you the new birth
[1:32:32] your old life is gone and you're back to
[1:32:36] the original word of the Lord what are
[1:32:39] you back to when you're born to get
[1:32:41] you're back to the original word
[1:32:48] you can have an anointing to not have
[1:32:50] the original word you can be blessed and
[1:32:53] not have the original word that's why
[1:32:55] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:32:57] unjust but that's not the rain is and
[1:33:00] what does it it's the son that does it
[1:33:04] it's the word
[1:33:07] the original word
[1:33:10] and the only way this world would get
[1:33:12] the original word is for God to speak
[1:33:16] again
[1:33:20] let's just read what he said
[1:33:23] he said
[1:33:24] the original word of the Lord if you're
[1:33:27] not you're hybrid into churches
[1:33:29] denominations but when God speaks his
[1:33:33] peace and the Holy Spirit then you're
[1:33:36] back in the original family of God again
[1:33:40] you don't have to be baby then you're a
[1:33:44] rugged Christian who can stand it
[1:33:48] what's the only thing that can bring you
[1:33:50] back
[1:33:52] the original word
[1:33:55] because that the word is the only thing
[1:33:57] that's what
[1:33:58] original
[1:34:02] go to the cross
[1:34:05] to the fiery furnace to the Lion's Den
[1:34:08] or whatever it may be because the word
[1:34:12] of God the word of God the word of the
[1:34:15] Living God is burning in your heart and
[1:34:19] soul
[1:34:20] you know yeah it amazes me how when
[1:34:23] Christians have problems in trouble
[1:34:28] they just it's everybody else's fault is
[1:34:31] it okay it's all this stuff they they go
[1:34:34] into pieces you know there's got to be a
[1:34:36] reason for it
[1:34:38] must Jesus bear the cross alone
[1:34:43] God loves to prove his children
[1:34:46] look at job
[1:34:51] I mean if anybody had the the right to
[1:34:55] turn it in job did
[1:34:58] no but what did he do
[1:35:01] he had the original word
[1:35:05] the original word though the skin worms
[1:35:08] eat my flesh yet I shall see God that
[1:35:12] ought to be the voice on every
[1:35:13] Christian's list though I die with this
[1:35:16] though I suffer this though all the
[1:35:18] devils in hell are turned loose on me I
[1:35:21] don't care what happens I will see God
[1:35:27] I will rise again
[1:35:29] the the storm clouds is no sign that
[1:35:32] God's against you the sun is no shine
[1:35:35] that God's for you the only thing you
[1:35:37] know is what if you're born again you've
[1:35:41] returned back to the original word there
[1:35:46] is no birth without the original word
[1:35:49] there's a sensation there's an emotion
[1:35:53] there's a an anointing all that but on
[1:35:57] the birth
[1:35:58] the real birth only can come from the
[1:36:02] original word
[1:36:10] this is beautiful
[1:36:13] I'm enjoying myself is that okay for
[1:36:15] Jane
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:18] he said
[1:36:20] rugged he said you won't stop
[1:36:25] one thing that rugged word of God stays
[1:36:28] right there when he spoke the original
[1:36:31] voice into your heart
[1:36:34] this Lord
[1:36:36] you are
[1:36:38] mine
[1:36:44] what happened he had to speak again so
[1:36:47] he speaks the original voice into your
[1:36:51] heart your name was written on the
[1:36:53] Lamb's Book of Life if you ever had
[1:36:55] eternal life you always had eternal life
[1:36:58] he put the wedding band of
[1:37:00] predestination over on you there what
[1:37:03] was it he was back again speaking his
[1:37:06] original word back to his children
[1:37:09] because it's the only thing and what
[1:37:12] does he say he says you are mine
[1:37:20] what is the holy spirit the holy spirit
[1:37:23] is God taking possession of what's his
[1:37:34] what does he come back
[1:37:37] he sends the original word
[1:37:43] the original word stood in flesh
[1:37:45] and spoke to the Gentile to the Jews now
[1:37:49] the original word was veiled in flesh
[1:37:51] again why was it redeemed flesh it
[1:37:54] proved
[1:37:56] that Calvary
[1:37:59] the work of Calvary was finished
[1:38:02] and now there was a people that he could
[1:38:06] lay claim to you're my lady you're my
[1:38:09] elected your mind the word of God speaks
[1:38:13] to your heart and says your mind that's
[1:38:16] what God's got to do that's what you've
[1:38:18] got to hear
[1:38:22] that's what he does
[1:38:25] you're mine
[1:38:27] the original he says a rugged the rugged
[1:38:31] word of God stays right there when he
[1:38:35] spoke that original voice
[1:38:39] in to your heart you
[1:38:42] are
[1:38:44] mine
[1:38:48] sorry Satan
[1:38:50] I don't belong to you
[1:38:52] I belong to God
[1:38:56] now he might show me all the things I
[1:38:58] might have to suffer first namesake
[1:39:01] but I don't care
[1:39:03] though the skin worms eat my flesh yet
[1:39:06] I'll see God you're rugged your name is
[1:39:09] on The Book of Life
[1:39:11] what did he tell us
[1:39:13] what did the original word come in this
[1:39:17] day and tell us he told us we
[1:39:21] were
[1:39:23] kids
[1:39:26] were his elected
[1:39:29] the rugged word of God
[1:39:31] why are we you can't take this message
[1:39:34] and make it say anything else other than
[1:39:36] it says
[1:39:39] you don't have to change it
[1:39:42] just stay with it
[1:39:44] pray for Revelation pray that it opens
[1:39:47] it up don't you see that in our
[1:39:50] generation
[1:39:52] we have the original word
[1:39:57] oh I just think of sermon titles the way
[1:40:00] of a true prophet
[1:40:01] a true Prophet doesn't speak his own
[1:40:04] thoughts he only speaks God's thoughts
[1:40:08] the true Prophet stays with the original
[1:40:11] word
[1:40:13] so what were we getting in this day
[1:40:16] we're getting the original word
[1:40:19] because the original word is the only
[1:40:22] thing that can take us out of a hybrid
[1:40:25] condition our hybrid condition
[1:40:31] you we're all hybrid
[1:40:35] what's he doing he's unmixing us
[1:40:42] he's separating all the the stuff out of
[1:40:45] us that's not original
[1:40:49] there's no need to put on a religious
[1:40:52] covering there's no need to act like
[1:40:54] some religious thing
[1:40:56] I got a lot of stuff I got being taken
[1:40:59] out of me praise God
[1:41:02] but he spoke in my heart that I'm here
[1:41:06] and if he's going to do a start of work
[1:41:09] he's going to finish it to the end and
[1:41:12] nothing can pluck me out of my hand he
[1:41:14] told me my name was on the Lamb's Book
[1:41:16] of Life it settled
[1:41:21] I gotta quit worrying about impressing
[1:41:25] the world
[1:41:26] and I've got to get with the Eternal
[1:41:28] Word plan and the Eternal Word plan is
[1:41:33] that God's word seed in me has the power
[1:41:36] to transform me into what I was
[1:41:40] originally in his thoughts in the
[1:41:43] beginning
[1:41:47] and that's what we have today
[1:41:50] we have God speaking again
[1:41:53] the original word
[1:41:56] to produce the original
[1:41:58] Church
[1:42:00] and the original bride what is the
[1:42:03] prophet of God call it the restoration
[1:42:05] of Eve
[1:42:09] back to the garden
[1:42:12] back to where she was
[1:42:15] before she hybrid it
[1:42:18] and I could go on into marriage and
[1:42:21] divorce how he types it there how he
[1:42:23] talks about that old husband being die
[1:42:25] and not having rule anymore all those
[1:42:28] things
[1:42:29] don't war against the flesh
[1:42:33] to try to get yourself out of a hybrid
[1:42:36] condition
[1:42:38] let the word of God
[1:42:43] transform you
[1:42:47] leave those things which are behind
[1:42:49] behind
[1:42:52] he threw him in the sea of his
[1:42:53] forgetfulness lets us throw him in the
[1:42:56] sea as God forgive them and let us press
[1:43:00] to the mark
[1:43:01] of the higher calling amen God bless you
[1:43:05] let's stand this evening
