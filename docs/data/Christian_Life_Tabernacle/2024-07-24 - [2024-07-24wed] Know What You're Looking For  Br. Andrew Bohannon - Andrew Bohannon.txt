here we're all serving a God that's redeemed Us by his blood amen praise the Lord why don't we just bow our hearts as we prepare to open the word of God Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you see Lord every heart here in the need that's behind the Heart Lord we're just wanting to say Lord how we know that Lord in ourselves we're insufficient but father by the call of God by the call of your word Lord we're coming to you Lord you said draw nigh unto me I'll draw nigh unto you Lord I believe that we're hungry and thirsting after righteousness father and Lord we're just committing the people to you Lord the needs that have been spoken the unspoken knes Lord we pray that as we point to something tonight Lord in your Eternal Word Lord that you would come behind it oh God and make it a reality Lord it takes the operation of your spirit oh God to impart life to bring Revelation so we're asking God tonight that you would grant that Lord as you've sent a Vindicated message and a servant Lord that humbled himself to your will and father we have spiritual food Lord we want oh God be faithful to go and feed every day Lord and even as we have this time now Lord we know that we've heard that there's some that had been in accidents Lord how do we know that this may be our last service Lord may we put all our energy and our effort and our Focus Lord may it be Lord that there will be a desperate cry if I don't have another day I got to get what I'm asking for from the Lord may you open our understanding Lord will you give isav Lord will you oh God break back the shackles and the clouds of the enemy Lord that the sh the sunshine of the light of this gospel can shine in Hearts today Lord be lifted up father as we commit all the needs all that we are into thy faithful hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we just have a little thought and um if you want to turn with me we'll just go right into the I was thinking um something that been a theme Paul prisoner and then hearing about the authority of God's word and then you know Delight ourselves in the Lord so I'm just trying to stay in that same channel but if we go to the book of Hebrews and we'll turn to chapter 6 I just as um brother Paul was ministering on Sunday I just thought something that he said he says um about how whenever we miss um seeing Jesus Christ the same yesterday in every scripture and he said something I don't remember the quote but this is how I wrote it down in my notes but it says we with natural thinking miss the whole scriptures of the speaking of Jesus Christ and you know we we want to know our enemy amen so we by natural thinking we miss Jesus Christ the same and as the word of God is preached we know that we must look and see ourselves in the scriptures because Jesus Christ is alive today where is he living in you amen that's the hope of glory so as we go through the word of God look to see yourself in the mirror of God's word amen so we just uh there in Hebrews we'll go to verse we'll start off there in verse 11 in the book of Hebrews chapter 6 feeling good this evening amen praise the Lord verse 11 the scripture says this for we desire that every one of you do show the show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope until the end that ye be not slothful nor followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promise I love that as we we see that there's a desire to show the same diligence of the full Assurance of Hope and I love this because he's connecting that patience and faith are working together to inherit the promises amen so he says for when God made promise to Abraham because he couldn't swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I Will Bless thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise man for men verely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the IM immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled to The Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us for which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into within the veil whether the Forerunner be of us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of melchisedec and one more scripture in Genesis Genesis chapter [Music] 17 we'll start there in verse one one and read to verse 11 and when Abraham was 99 years old and 9 years old the the Lord appeared to Abram and he said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be be called Abraham for a father of many nations I have made thee and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make Nations out of thee and Kings come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be a God and this and God said to Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thy and thy seed after thee in their generations and this is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every Manch child among you shall be circumcised ized and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant between M between me and you amen the Lord added a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know I just got to thinking about you know just the the word's been so precious and it's just been wonderful how the Lord's been opening it up to us and you know as as brother Paul was minister Min and I I thought that was just tremendous course all the Sunday was wonderful and you know I got to thinking about this this you know God promised to give us our heart's desire and he said I believe it was in Psalms 37 if you delight yourself in the Lord and you know really that's that's the Cry of the believer is you know I don't want the things of the world you know they have a pull on us you know we have these two these two natures and they're Waring for attention Waring for affection there's the the natural desire of the man through his mind and you can see something like if I get a good education then I'll have a good job and then I won't have to worry about money but then there's the contrasting is there's a desire of the heart to do what's pleasing to the Lord amen and and that's the the desire to do the will of God and in the will of God God provides for our needs in that place we don't have to worry about food and clothing and shelter but he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and so as we find out that you know as human beings we are in this great conflict we're in a great battle and this battle we just want to be mindful as we're going through as pilgrims of the Cross we're seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God and so the little thought that I had tonight I just maybe just to kind of let you know where we're headed but know what you're looking for a lot of times if you go to a certain place they have these games where it's like you got to find these Clues and different things but you sometimes don't know what you're looking for sometimes they'll give you Clues but all of a sudden you just kind of find yourself not really knowing where you're going right but praise God God didn't leave us without a guide amen God didn't leave us without a witness some examples that have gone before us that we can look to and point to and say God made a way for them how did God do it I want to know what you're looking for what are we looking for sometimes the question it can be in a form of a question what are you looking for but then in another time it can be in a declaration what are you looking for and so it's this this subject kind of came to me because of the the way that you know thinking about the desires of our heart and how they conflict and they battle against the desires of the mind they're at War within us they have a pull a natural pull to pull us into the things of the world but there's another pull I feel the pool of God calling me because this world can't stand that's right and we have to have a sobriety and so there's there's an approach to our desires amen you know there's the natural desire of the man and and then there's the natural desire or the spiritual desire of the heart amen and it's so important to realize if you're if you're pointing to something you you're looking at something the the desires of something they influence your direction they influence your decisions if the devil can dangle some carrot before us and we start looking at it through the lens of our natural mind he will get us hooked on things that all of a sudden will go further than when we want to go and we'll stay longer than we want to be there but praise God that if we'll let that inside something that one that's controlling inside the boiler room if we'll let him lead praise God we'll be free of the bondage and the shackles that the devil always tries to take and Allure our eyes and get us looking at the wrong things but praise God we can look into the word of God and see God has a plan for us he said I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of Peace not of evil to bring you to an expected end and yeah it's just one of those glorious things that we can look into the word of God and see how God he he used our Prophet as an example and I'll be preaching a little bit out of a message called conf confirmation and evidence it was preached in 1962 on June 21st even in the introductory prayer brother brandom just lays out this wonderful thought and I'll just read it to you as he says gracious heavenly father as we come tonight upon the solemn occasion to speak to thy people we realize the great need of the hour praise God aren't you thankful that there was somebody who realized the great need of the hour truly we might think we need this and we might need that but oh God he he brought his word amen and that's what exactly what we needed and he says we realize the possibility of a great outpouring of the spirit we can just approach it in the right way he says so we come in the name of the Lord Jesus to ask mercy and then father we realize tonight again that we have before us the purchase of the blood of Jesus and how we would handle this and it's too much of a job for a human being so we ask Lord that you would let the Holy Spirit Come and minister to each of us and give us of the things that we have need of if our desire be thy will Lord we pray that you will pour out our desires to us tonight amen isn't that a wonderful thing you know it's a lot of times because I think it was even James sometimes we pray and we ask a miss that we would consume those things Upon Our natural lust but my brother brandham stay that the great need of the hour is that we would have the desire for God and God had planted this thirst in a human heart every single one of us in here today has a thirst for God you wouldn't be here if you didn't have that thirst for God but the devil was a perverter of that thirst and he came and corrupted the desires of man to go after the things of the world there's a part of us that is of the world and so we want to recognize this is a great battle Shadow it's easy to look over our shoulder and look back and different things but we want to stay in the Battleground we want to know what we're looking for I'm looking for the Lord to lead amen I'm looking for the Lord to satisfy my desires in paragraph 34 brother Brown says this I'm thinking on confirmation and evidence and he says it seems like man always required confirmation and some sort of evidence he says and so much more as the time and the age and the Skeptics that we're living you know I think this is so wonderful because in this time you think about I mean you can go to any kind of Avenue whether it's through a security breach you there has to be a confirmation now they have these different programs where they have all these different levels of security I got to have this confirmation first before I can know evidently that you're the person that is authorized to come into this portal or or we need to have a confirmation for uh this politician or we need to have confirmation um that the package was delivered Amazon has this thing where they take pictures they have to have they have to produce an Evidence when there is ever a claim that hey this did not show up we made the order we paid the money and we don't have the package but now we're living because there's so many Skeptics there's so many impersonations there's so many things that pervert truth that we are now in this age in this time where we have to have confirmation we want to have an Evidence Hallelujah but there's a corrupt way to seek after evidences but God has made a way that we can have a confirmation and an evidence that really satisfies our heart's desire and we can know what we're looking for God didn't just make it so mysterious he actually made it at the end time that all the secrets and Mysteries of God would be fulfilled in plain view for the the believer today so we know what we're looking for we're looking into the message of the hour We're looking into the face of God so much more is the time the time of age of skeptic ICS that we're living in everything must be confirmed it must be an Evidence to it and the evidence of the confirmation gives us aurity of what we're looking for I mean Believers aren't just going to fall for anything in this hour it can look it can have songs that claim jesus' name it can have all of the the the clothing of a religious individual but by their fruit they are known that's we we're not deceived we are the we are the type we are of the attribute that can't be deceived now we we can make mistakes but praise God God he he comes by our way and gives us a little touch with those nail scarred hands and we say oh Lord that enemy he had me trapped but thank God for the blood I'm wrong Lord you're right amen that's the desire of our heart we want to be right with God we don't want to have nothing in between our our relationship with the Lord and then secondarily once we have that we don't want to be have nothing in between our brothers our sisters we don't have nothing against our neighbor we don't have nothing against our coworker or anybody we don't want to have no guile we want to be free in the spirit we're going to be able to worship him whether at work or in church or going down down the street praise God praise God you know it's one of those things that you know you think about when somebody if if what we're going to be restored to is the Faith of Our Father Abraham and if you know you go out and you purchase a car or a home or something you know there's people that make purch purches on property that they they do it what's called sight unseen they'll just they'll just buy a piece of property because it's a good deal they never even looked at it or anything all of a sudden they just because that's part of their investment strategy they'll go and buy a bunch of deals from auction or whatever and then all of a sudden they have this you know deed it's a title and though they never seen it or anything they have the right to that property amen and you think about it that's what faith is is you know a lot of the promises of God you you don't see with your natural eye but by faith you know that it was purchased that you can have healing you can be saved you might not be able to physically say this is it you you might not be able to give an Evidence to somebody uh with the natural like this is this is it but there's something on the inside that answers back that says I possess this right God has confirmed it to me not just because I seen it in the word of God but God has done something for me I possess something it's a confirmation when someone buys a car it's a confirmation to him that he owns that car because he has the deed or the title in paragraph 36 he says and then if we bought a piece of the ground though we've never seen the ground know nothing about the ground yet we have the abstract deed to the ground it belongs to us whether we've seen it or not it still belongs to us the car belongs to us whether we have seen it or not yet we have the title given to us and we hold it in our possession in our name that that title shows that we own the car the abstract tells we us that we own the property amen oh when Jesus Christ paid the price at Calvary you didn't realize it but you had an inheritance you were already an heir of promise we read the scripture you are the faith seat of Abraham and God when he manifest the son his son Jesus Christ Christ he loosed The Inheritance back to us all he's asking is if you will believe my word take me at my word healing is a part of your inheritance salvation is part of his inheritance Redemption for your family praise God the promise of an endless life amen praise God Hebrews 11 says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen see it's a substance see and he said that it's not something it's not hope most people come with hope but faith is a substance it isn't something that you're hoping for When Faith takes a hold you have a substance you know I I just love how it just the prophet will take it and it anchors because really what it is showing us as Believers that's what's In My Heart Lord I can accept that and I can believe it that way because it resonates it harmonizes with what's in here now but the natural mind can say well I hope I'm I'm Healed we have to fight that enemy when faith has taken a hold it has it you have a substance not just a myth you've got a hold of something you know it nothing shakes you from it it's yours you're positive you got it in your hand you got it it's your possession praise God you know you know the scripture says faith is a gift of God God has given you Faith that's right it is a powerful weapon against the lives of the enemy you know it's uh we just kind of want to testify about something you know one of the things that when I think about faith you know before you ever really started thinking about God and before you even wanted to think about serving God there was something that was a desire in your heart it was for me I didn't want to be the person that I was and but I realized by predestination now that God had planted that something inside of the heart that all of a sudden I can start saying wait a minute I'm not looking to carry on this kind of life i' I'd rather not even live for that kind of life cuz I realize that where that's taking me is into a place I don't like I don't want it doesn't harmonize with something that I feel like is possible I mean it's hard to explain but for the believer you know you know how you're here how you're here tonight to serve God it was impossible but God rich in mercy God who had a all on your life God wanted to show you what his plan was and make you a partaker praise God you know you think about the if if someone was starving and and they were dying they were on the verge you know but if if if what they needed was that loaf of bread and that loaf of bread was standing there but in order to possess it I needed a quarter and we know this if I had the quarter and that represented my healing from starvation my dying if I had that in my possession it would be good as gold because now I know it's just a matter of taking it in but I already have it now and that's the substance that he gives when he makes us a joint air in Christ Jesus when he makes that reality when you come into his kingdom who did that was it just your desire no no it was the call of God but the desire brought you to a reality that I can't go another day without him that's right now that quarter represented the purchasing power so you have purchasing power in the economy of God think about how many people if they're going to buy cars or Properties or businesses or if they're in a market business and they got to buy books or different things can you imagine how happy they would be if all of a sudden alls they lack to be successful in their business was purchasing power oh if I just had a million dollars I would buy $20,000 worth of this and 50,000 of that all of a sudden they would feel they start feeling a little bit looser man the bands are just man my business potential is just increasing praise God but when you have a substance of Faith okay you have power with God praise the Lord they want to shake off all that natural stuff boy it just clogs the channel I'm a witness it clogs the channel but praise God to to know that like what brother Billy was preaching about the authority of God's word God has entrusted you with virtue you have the power to move God on the scene to call him on the scene oh my my he said so that's the way faith is Faith is something that you have you know you've got it and when you receive faith that God is then that God is going to give you this yet your healing might not be there but yet something has anchored within you that tells you that it's going to be all right we we want to know what we're looking for I might not have the manifestation of my healing but I know that God is and God is giving it to me there's there got to be something happen where it anchors in our heart you know it's very simple in many ways we we complicate it because we have a natural mind but God he's the one that chose you you didn't come to this by your choosing now you're here to remain by your choosing but he's the one that Drew you amen then he gave you a new heart he gave you you a new spirit to desire his will oh praise God for the hand of God in our lives M Amen in verse 40 it says this see it's it isn't a myth it's not an imagination it's a substance and anything that is a substance is isn't a myth it's something that you actually got AO a hold of it now there's where many people fail to get healed is they have hope instead of Faith you hope that you will your your kind of imaginary fade because you feel like you are you're you're uh appropriated that but when actually you got a hold of Faith it's a substance it's something real then you hold that that's what brings it I wish I could have that instantaneously faith that I'd like to have I'm sorry I don't have it the only way that I got anchored faith is when he tells me something to do or shows me to do it my well I just think this is something that I needed to hear praise God you know brother brandom he was a he was a very special bird that he could see we're Eagles in here right amen he could see and he can hear directly from God Amen right and that gave him what he called a anchored great faith amen amen I'm sure that if you were in that place where you heard from God daily and you saw Visions like he it would give you great anchored faith he said if he would appear on this platform tonight and say to me go to the presidential graveyard tomorrow morning at 10:00 call George Washington from the dead I'd invite the whole world to come and see it done and watch it done yes sir for I have faith in what he been told me and never because never has he failed to confirm whatever he said to me so I have faith in it believing it that it is the truth because it's a builtup affair down through life since a little boy all the visions of the thousands not one of them has ever failed therefore it is the truth it gives me Faith I got faith in what he says now I've often wondered if sometimes I didn't go beyond the boundaries and say God Give Me Faith to speak to this one to speak to that one to speak to that one now we realize that our lord Jesus being Emanuel never did that for he plainly said in John 5 and 19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing but he sees the father doing not hears the father saying but sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise there's got to be something that happen to make you have the EV this evident evidence this confirmation now if God said you're it's going to rain in the morning it wouldn't be hard for me to make to to to make ready for rain because I know it's going to rain now if we can change that around from seeing a vision or hear the audible voice of God but change it around to the initial way of having faith is by hearing the written word of God we want to know what we're looking for this is the Simplicity of the Gospel to be able to go into the storehouse as individuals God has already invited us to come we can go for ourself we don't need another man to tell us that God has already invited us that's right and we can take the the written word and hold to it God has loosed the promises for us amen amen now when God comes into our midst and proves himself to us in giving the US the Holy Ghost oh I love that that's enough for me amen how many have the Holy Ghost praise God you know what God is so faithful it's it's a simple formula repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost it's that simple you have the right to the promise God has loosed you he's paid the price it's a simple formula the hard part is is the repentance what we think about the the matter well I'm I'm still young I got more time that voice hasn't died that's right that voice is still speaking and the devil uses humans just like God he's seen God using humans and he wanted to do the same thing but I'm here to say that God is faithful to his word if you'll repent and you'll be baptized God will bring an Evidence he'll bring a confirmation now when God comes in our midst and proves himself to us in giving us the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues giving interpretation sending gifts Among Us like that or prophecies that stands at the certain place and says a certain thing and does a certain thing and proves it time after time and it never fails that should build us into a place that would give us a hold on that word that we wouldn't let it Loose it ought to be an Evidence right there as long as God said so that settles it see you know when you think of about because we're living in that time of Skeptics because we're living in the time of impersonations people I just heard a testimony a brother was telling me that people impersonated his business like they just shut his whole thing down on the web and they were copying like the way it was an impersonation and I don't know how many thousands of dollars that they bezzel or whatever you call it but there was an impersonation you know no doubt that Wars against the flesh now they're skeptical the next thing and the next thing well I I got to have now a a greater confirmation that that as you know the different things come through you you you know that's just the age that we live in you know but this is what I love so much is you know though there's a bogus though there's impersonators there's a real genuine that I had to be made off of there's a real Christian just because there's a lot of false doesn't mean there's real Witnesses of the Resurrection Direction that's right amen as sure as there's a false there's got to be a real one that's made off of so there is a real Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit a real Divine Healing a real power of God a real faith in the word and that is the confirmation something that's anchored how glorious it confirms man looks for that it's a natural it's a natural it's natural of a man excuse me God made man that way that's the way God made up a man so therefore making up a man with that kind of makeup God does something to answer to that man's desires aren't you glad about that amen thank God can give you an Evidence God can give you a confirmation we're not a bunch of sign Seekers but we know that God has given evidence so that we can know we're on the wrong road if we're going the wrong way or if we're on the right way we can continue that's the kind of God he is you know as we looked a little bit last time but the Journey of Abra oh my just think about it you know and we just maybe go to uh Genesis 15 and and just thinking about how that you know this this witness that God you know he gave that that promise to Abraham but then he confirmed that promise amen and he did it with an oath but we'll just read a little bit here in 15 uh and paragraph 4 Genesis 15 and four he says and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this is this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine Heir and he brought forth he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou were able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it unto him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of AA and out of the caldan to give you this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it isn't that isn't that awesome you know if we're the fa seat of ab Abraham we want to know what are we going to be looking for how are we going to know hallu he said and he said unto him take me a hepher of three years okay and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took upon him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against the other but the bird divided he not and when the fouls came down upon the carcass Abraham drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low and horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve I will judge and afterwards shall they go out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace and thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation there shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down can I say in the evening time and then it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark and behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those pieces in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham Abram saying unto thy seed will I give this land from the river Egypt unto the Great River the riv euph fores amen and I just think about that God you know this is what he said and I is so special to think about how God told him now this is going to be the way that I'm going to confirm how how is this where how how am I going to know that I'm going to inherit this God wants to give us confirmation of our inheritance and so he lays these sacrifices he was told to him in the middle and all of a sudden at the at the evening time at the setting of The Sun there was this Burning of and this this flame that went between the the sacrifice my think about God coming in between that sacrifice he's saying now that's how you'll know that's what you'll be looking for praise God God coming in a sacrifice oh my he says this in paragraph 52 he says now Faith God told Abraham here he gave him the promise and then God confirmed this promise to him gave him an Evidence by taking an oath before him and the immutable thing is that God cannot lie and not only that when he promised him then beyond that he swore to it now God taking an oath to himself you got to swear to someone greater than you and there was no one greater to to swear to greater than himself so he swore to himself and the promise was unto Abraham and is a conjunction to his seed after him not seeds but his seed and Christ is the Seed of Abraham and we being in Christ The Life of Christ in US makes us Abraham's children and Hees with him according to the promise amen God you you know my heart you know I desire to be identified you you know my desire is to see myself in this word and when you're in Christ you're Abraham's seed praise God you're heir to every promise my my in Galatians chapter 3 just point to another little Paul picks this up and I just thought my goodness thank God for his prophets Galatians chapter three verse five says this he therefore that Minister unto you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by the law The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith even Abraham believed God and it was account accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the the gospel unto Abraham saying in the shall all the nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that can continueth not in all all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them amen and Christ ha redeemed us from the curse of the law being made the curse for us as it is written cursed is every man that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come onto the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disallow or added there unto now to Abraham and to his seed were the promise promises made he said not to thy seeds as of many but as of one into thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant which was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disano that it should make the promise of non-ff for if the inheritant be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefor then serveth the law that was added because of transgression till the seed come shall come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one is the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there be been a law given which could have given life verely righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe amen but that before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which would afterward be revealed therefore the law was our school Master to bring us to Christ and we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under School Master amen for all of the children of God by faith we are all children of God by faith in Jesus Christ for as many of you are baptized unto Christ have put on Christ amen and then 29 it says there and if you be in Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise praise God you know we take the old Old Testament the New Testament we want it all amen you know I got to thinking about the journey and you know you think about Abraham and how God made that Covenant with him and he he gave him this big promise and all of a sudden immediately he goes in to Egypt and you know he he all of a sudden you know maybe with his own thinking he tells Sarah you know hey when we get over there just let them know straight up that you're my sister cuz she was beautiful and all of a sudden you know that the Pharaoh wanted to have Sarah's wife and God had plagued pharaoh and his kingdom because of that thing that he did he had a carnal a natural thinking to preserve his own flesh and this is the thing maybe he wasn't looking forward at the decision I don't know if if he was thinking wait God already said that I would be a father of Nations how can he wipe me out but it's part of the journey it's part of the Journey of Faith and then you think about it then God comes to him and says okay now he goes through and he says now I want you to to separate you know to to you know just further on it's just like us God wants us to separate from the things of the world God wants us to be free to worship him to serve him to honor his word and then I got to thinking about you know after Abraham you know he's you know he's given uh Hagar he's like go ahead and you know and ishma came and then all of a sudden and I believe it's in this uh Genesis 17 but you know Abraham came to a place where you got a name change you know and that's the Journey of the believer there comes a time where you know your name has changed and you're no longer identified with that old man all of that old thinking that old nature but God he wanted to give him something think about it when he was 99 years old he was told that it was going to come from his loins it was an impossibility there was no way that this could have happened in his thinking but because God said so and he believed God he had he had this built up Faith to believe that God would confirm it time and time and time again every time he made a promise God was faithful it didn't necessarily go maybe the way he thought it would but God brought it to pass it's the same for us you know by these exceedingly precious promises we are partakers of divine divine nature to think the deity dwells in within each one of us and but God he wanted to have this token this you know I mean I don't know when I had my son and we were at the hospital and you know the circumcision you know that's that's kind of um you know it's one of those things that you know you know you just kind of you feel for the children but Abraham was 99 and but God he he's like I'm going to give you something that you can have as an evidence that you can know that you know that I'll fulfill my word it might be painful it might be hard you know God gave you a desire God gave me a desire to serve him but we can't serve him by the law it has to be by the heart that God gave us to believe all things are possible despite what we think right true and so he comes to this place now he's got this sign that he can point to and said God he made the promise to me that I would be I would have this and it was a further unfolding of what was promised in Genesis in in in in the garden how that that seedline would come praise God now God's unfolding a little bit more of what his plan was to bring Redemption he's like my okay so now this impossibility is going to come through me but now he can take and he can point to something just listen to how brother Bram talks about this in paragraph 62 he says now so after confirming I wish we had time but I made a promise and God and God gave Abraham the promise then he confirmed it when he gave him circumcision it was a sign it was in his flesh and now I'm speaking to a mixed audience and you regard me as your brother now when Abraham getting old and the Bible says his body was as good as dead he could not look he could look down to the sign in his flesh and know that it was God's token that he would keep his word circumcision look at that evidence says God made the promise Sarah says I'm 90 I'm far past the act of life but when Abraham turned and looked at the evidence that God said this is a token Abraham gave glory to God and being stronger than ever because it was a token a confirmation that God would Grant it to him amen and he promised that his children would soour in a Strange Land for 400 years amen I just started thinking about that and you know we we you know that's the spiritual type the circumcision is to cut away from the worldliness and the world you know and there's more to it than that but I mean if there's some things that are hanging on to you pray God God get that out of my life that's carnal my natural desires brought me to that place but I want you to circumcise my heart circumcise my life I want this token of life that's consecrated and devoted to the Messiah coming into manifestation in my life every time no doubt no doubt every time Abraham looked at it just like each one of us the trans the the change in our life to desire the things of the world to desire the things for godone that didn't come by us right I look back on what I was that wasn't my doing that was God that circumcision of God now now I can look back and I can say you know what that was God and if God started the work he's faithful if he started the work he's going to complete it m you know I got to thinking to is you know you think about confirmation and evidence you know when we look into the scripture we see that Moses you know this he was like okay this is going to be another part of it there your seed's going to sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but then I'll raise up raise him out of that with a mighty hand and Moses came he gave another confirmation that God's word is true and this was the faith seat of Abraham so they can see that God came again through his word by a pillar of fire and a prophet and he gave them the word of God you know and then I believe it was Joshua that was commissioned to take him over to the promised land you know and I believe is you know Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost and Caleb was a type of the believer amen we just want to harmonize with the word of God the spirit of God that he can take us into the Promised Land amen what what is it for us we have to come to a maturity where we can look at our lives and see Christ that's what we're desire we want to look to see the character the nature of God manifesting in our decisions that he can come and harvest us one of these days I mean we look at the world they're they're coming to maturity they're coming to a harvest of a great bomb and a fire but praise God there's a people that are able to cut away cut away from the the things and see God he's uniting us amen thinking about that leadership of God there's a better land that's what Joshua and Caleb were saying come on this is the Promised Land This Is The Inheritance that God gave our Father Abraham there's a better land we don't have to stay in the nonsense we can cross over there's a kades barnea we need to cross over we need to die out to ourselves amen that Christ can be resurrected isn't that your desire it's my desire in 70 it says so they came out of Egypt and they came to a place called Kadesh barnea I believe it was along there Joshua the great warrior them when over they spied out the land and they crossed over Jordan and they went over to the land and came back with an evidence that it was a good land that God's word was perfect and his promises are true he had the evidence the confirmation that the land was there and he had a hold of something and the land was exactly what God promised it to be two men was packing a bunch of grapes and the people could taste and of it and see that the land was good it was a confirmation that God keeps his promise and he says then Israel crossed Jordan and went to the promised land and Joshua divided the lands for them and there was they were in peace they were a nation they had their churches they planted their crops they raised their children they took took them to church and they had happy lives they put fear in all the other nations they were a great people he says they all had to die regardless of the good land they were in and the good fruits that they were eating but they had to die then one day down came the great Chief Captain the Lord Jesus and he began to tell us of another land Hallelujah this doesn't get old to me you know this this is what this is the Cry of my heart and this is what I live every day for to see this come into a reality but God is giving us evidence he's giving a foraste amen he said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I will go and prepare a place for you and come again to receive you unto myself that's where you that's where I am where you may be also and I love this he says in other words like this you have been real loyal to the cause but you have to die but there's a land that a man lives and don't die there's a life after death what a promise to the people oh my to think that this nightmare one day will be over and to think that there will be a life without end I mean it's painful sometimes we want to go to each one's house and have fellowship and different things but one day one day our heart's desire will be made known we'll realize it in Perfection amen but he came to this Kadesh barnea amen he says the Judgment seat was Kadesh barnea he came to Cades barnea Calvary where upon Him bore the sins of the world at Calvary but he crossed also the Jordan that we call Jordan of death he went over into that other land and was dead three days and nights he died Till The Sun quit shining he died till the Earth was so nervous a nervous breakdown he shook the rocks out of the mountains he died and on the third day he rose back again with the evidence that there is a land where a man can live and not die die he returned back from that Land There is a life after death if you didn't know that before this service there is a life after death yes sir now he says to his disciples go I am going to give you an Earnest of this I am going to give you a confirmation of this as they did to Abraham with circumcision but waiting wait up there at Jerusalem until you got the confirmation until you got the evidence they waited and on the 10th day they came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind that filled the building their setting they were filled with the Holy Ghost Tong of tongues of fire sat upon them and they were filled and they began to speak in other tongues and the spirit gave them entance what is it it was the evidence that our Joshua Jehovah's savior had returned turn from the dead and give us the evidence that when we die we live again on the other side confirmation confirming given the evidence of it amen aren't you thankful for that you know when you look back in your life and you see all you were caught up in the bondage of the world the muck and the sin and everything and if God called you into the kingdom of his glorious son and he transferred that unrighteousness all of that sin and the way that we were and then he deposited his own very righteousness by faith amen and we know that we passed from Death to life we know that we've been translated into his kingdom oh if God has done that for us surely he can fulfill the rest of his word to bring us to that place amen amen I thought this was beautiful in paragraph 80 he says now I said unbelief do you do those things because you do not believe if you believe why then you wouldn't do them it's attributes of unbelief and righteousness is the attribute of Faith because you've anchored in that Faith a I just think about it you know if we just point to it you know God has given us faith that he can declare his righteousness in our lives that's something we want to point to today this day the Lord has made that he can declare his righteousness you know that's the drawing card in this hour you know we can point back and say all of the things that brother bandham did but you're the very fruit of this message that's right the attraction is the message the word of the hour is you living moving doing whether you're packaging in a warehouse whether you're mowing lawns it doesn't matter you are the attraction Christ is living in you we want to know what we're pointing at God wants to use Witnesses you know I was thinking about another message brother Brandon preached called path of life and it was in the morning to this this evening service but you know in in the scripture in in psalm 16 it says Thou will show me the path of life and in in thy presence is fullness of joy my think about it we we want to live in that presence of the Lord where there's fullness of joy but he said I will show the the path of life isn't that your desire to see the path of life to know what we're looking for I thought in that message it just helped me so much you know doing carpentry you know most of my adult life and he he began to talk about you know if if he was on the job and you know as as Witnesses and this is the subject matter we're turning to now just as witnesses to go into all the world and preach the gospel he he he said there's an approach you know we want to have witnesses we want to have converts we want we want people to be taken from the shackles of sin and sickness and sorrow but we want to have the right approach to to realize our desires amen and so brother Brown's talking about you know if I go on a job site or something like that and I'm paraphrasing but he's like there was a guy he's over there whacking his thumb and he's hammering away and but now I have this new Advanced I have something that's more advanced than what he's been working he's very skilled he's been doing this all of his life but every now and then he would just you know he would H Hammer his thumb or different things but he now brother Brown saying well this new advancement is this thing where he can slide a tag and so now he's got a nematic of sorts or some kind of different technology and this was back in the 60 I don't even know if they had it at the time but brother brandom's going through he says now if I approach him and say ah you ain't got nothing in it see what I can do and I wonder if that's the way we approach sometimes with people because we've been given so much you know but I want our lives to be effectual for the gospel I want to be able to approach him you know he said you know you get to just talking to them about what they what they have interest in you know the moment that we start getting out of our world and our cares and our concerns and our difficulties and get in someone else's world they begin to to see this there's a something genuine here and if there's something Desiring there that can respond back they'll ask they'll ask amen praise the Lord I'm so grateful for the message amen you know if you want to stand with me I'm going to invite the musicians to come and just wanted to uh share a few things that was on my heart and believe that as we pointed to a few things maybe you maybe say that I don't have this I don't have this evidence I don't have this confirmation in my heart but I desire it I desire a confirmation I I want to know that I'm anchored that that day when my name is called that all the the issues that maybe are unsettled or I don't want to have no questions when I get to that River Jordan and if every heart here would just bow your head and if it's just you and the lord it's just you and the Lord and if you know in your heart you want to say God I want that confirmation I want you to make known to me a substance Faith one that I can take you at your word and know that you can't lie and that you the oath and the Covenant that you made by the promise it is to me and I want oh God something that I can hold to something that'll anchor and you just want to lift your hand and say God will you will you give me this evidence will you give me this confirmation out of the promise of your word I want to see you in my life Lord the desire of my heart is to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today today and forever in my flesh God bless you Heavenly Father Lord you know God on his hearts Lord here tonight Lord just Desiring oh God to do thy will and to serve you Lord and we know that your Prophet Lord pointed to the absolute Lord and we believe oh God even tonight that you're present to make uh shity of your confirmation of your Covenant father we're committing the PE people to you Lord you know the secret things Lord you know the besetting things Lord but right now God I pray that by faith we can look past those things and look to the shed blood of Calvary Lord to know that you God are the Forerunner Lord you're the one that oh God when you went to Gethsemane oh God you you showed the example not my will be done oh God Lord let that same life Echo forth in our lives Lord and may it be oh God that you would find pleasure to oh God fulfill your desire in our heart father as we commit the people pray your faithful hand and touch on them in Jesus Christ's name amen let's sing that song I surrender all

salvation glory glory to his oh that I surrender all oh let I surrender all oh and all to [Music] myor I surrender all hallelujah amen is that your heart desire tonight man did you enjoy the word amen that's what what are you looking for amen I'm looking for his promise to be made true in me I'm looking for his manifestation in my flesh why do I look for that because he has given me the faith to believe that his word is true he has you know the scripture says happy are your eyes for the can see happy are your ears what is that God plac his faith in you so when you will hear the word you will believe and in believing his word he's going to bring the power of transformation in your life little by little it going to walk you up and and bring you into the manifestation of what he desires for you to be the flesh is going to fight that but that's all right but the promise is greater than what the flesh can do you know I thought about a brother just made a statement that just resonated he said Abraham's Journey of Faith and I thought the Journey of Faith look at him it took him to Egypt he made some mistakes it brought out uh Ishmael but the Journey of Faith finally took him to the promised son it didn't matter how many mistakes he made along the way but Faith was preserving him when he made a mistake his life was about to be taken Faith came on the sin and said no I made a promise to this person there's nothing you can do to him he's got to live because there's a promise that's got to come but whatam says that Abraham righteousness was because he judged God to be faithful He Who made the promise he judge him faithful that he's able to produce what he said he will do it wasn't because of Abraham's ability or anything what he said is God made a promise and I believe it and he's going to come to pass and it's going to come to pass as God said it now whatever else happened in between that didn't matter he hang on to the faith he believed God was faithful to bring forth his promise and at the end the promise was manifested and we are children of Abraham by the same faith not a different Faith a faith of those that are called out of sins and you know those
