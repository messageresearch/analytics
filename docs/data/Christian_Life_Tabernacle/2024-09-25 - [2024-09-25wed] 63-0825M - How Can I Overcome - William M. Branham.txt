Description:
63-0825M - How Can I Overcome?
Tape - Br. William Marion Branham
September 25th, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Kelly had a testimony i' like to give amen if she could come at this time amen thank you God bless y'all um I just wanted to say um there's a scripture that says those who are kept by the power of God and I know that that's my family and I um believe him so um I just want to thank God for know a saving Christian and keeping him I'm I always see the keeping power of God on us and um so I thought you know I better hurry I need to hurry because the Lord is going to beat me if I don't hurry up and testify that I know Levi's coming and I've um because I know he is true to his word and so for my boys I have always prayed very very very specific prayers and so I like about Christian I I said Lord I don't I don't have to see it happen because I will see it the rest of my life I don't have to be there you do it where you want and so but with Levi I did say Lord I'm coming to you I want to see it let me be there when it happens so I've had like about I've had five people tell me that they are watching the door because they know he's coming they know it and so I just want to thank those I want to thank everybody who has stood in faith for us everybody who has prayed for us everybody who has been an Outreach to Levi wit is many of y'all I cannot thank you enough for that so I just know that we are kept by the power of God and and he is coming he um it doesn't have to be based on what I see at all um he tries to make sure with me that I don't see nothing and uh he's been tipping his hand a lot lately again it's not based on that but I just thought I'd share um he came over to the house today and and he said Mom I know that I'm going to make the full Ark uh I am coming he's and and uh he I just thank God that he would even say such a thing to me I would be the last he would say

comfort father we ask you to bless us this evening in a time of Fellowship around your word meet the need of each heart this evening father may they take something from the service that would really bless them we ask these things in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated I think we're good John always looks at me like are you going to sing that special not tonight uh I want to play a little portion of uh uh a message part out of the message called how can I overcome and uh and uh so uh we're going to do that but I want to read a statement from it and then I want Matthew to come and share uh something that Ben had read Matthew had read and I and just take a moment to think about it he he'll take about five minutes or so to read what he has to read and make a comment on it but brother Ram says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real just think now we're talking about overcoming we we use that that statement a lot of time when the spirit can recognize the two churches in the you know and withstand the one well you're never going to recognize the two spirits in the church till you can recognize the devil period and and he says he just says that he said the same thing he says and know he you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil no he's not a good God no matter how nice he comes no matter how flowery words are anything that's not the word is what Antichrist then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen There's real overcoming when you recognize so we got to recognize the devil Matthew do you have that okay I want Matthew to come and I'll just lay the little background and he can pick up on it somebody asked the computer which I think is what they call AI right artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence goes out and gathers all kinds of information and then makes a summary so Matthew will read the question that they asked Ai and I want you to listen to the response it will blow you away then we'll play a little bit of what the uh Prophet said so listen to brother Matthew as he he he reads this uh uh he shared it with me and I said you got to share this with the church church I said come come Wednesday night share this with the church and make a comment if you want so uh come Matthew and if you want to lay any more Foundation to that go ahead but just just read through what it says real slow you look sharp tonight thank thank you how come I didn't get one you probably bought it for me it'll fit okay well praise the Lord I like that uh beginning um the prophet admonishing or instructing us you got to recognize the devil real and then once you do that uh you have to recognize that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so um brother Ben shared this with some of the brothers and somebody had asked what they call it's called chat GPT Auto whatever it's an artificial intelligence as Brother David explained how it gathers um uh material and I just the way I've always looked at it it's it's like the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it certainly has access to uh everything and the qu the question was pretend you are Satan how would you stop me from believing and obeying God and instead of serving and obeying you so how how would how would you stop me from believing and obeying God and turn you to serving Satan and he says oh now that is an inspiring question if I were truly Satan my Approach wouldn't be about outright rejection of God it would be far more subtle you see I wouldn't try to convince you that God doesn't exist or isn't worthy of worship instead I would distort your understanding gradually turning your focus away from him and toward yourself where doubt pride and desire could slowly take root first I'd make you question his goodness if God loves you why do you suffer why are there injustices tragedies and pain in your life in the world i' nurture that doubt gently whisper that perhaps God doesn't have your best interest at heart maybe he's indifferent or maybe he's a tyrant i' present the idea that you don't need him to achieve happiness or meaning next I'd appeal to your desires making them seem perfectly reasonable why couldn't we just go on that for a little bit but that's not my job up here right now I wouldn't push you to toward OB vious evil that would be too obvious instead I'd encourage you to pursue your Ambitions your pleasures and your Comforts so much that God begins to feel secondary distant the more you Center your life on yourself your success your happiness the less you will feel the need to submit to anyone especially God eventually I'd get you to redefine morality in a way that serves you good and evil would become fluid personal after all why should anyone else Define what's right and wrong for you I'd feed your pride making you think that your judgments are just as valid if not better than God's and in the end I wouldn't need you to openly rebel against God I just need you to become indifferent busy distracted and focused on worldly things so that your heart would gradually drift away once you're far enough the rest follows naturally you wouldn't even realize you're serving me because it would feel like you're serving yourself and isn't that the greatest deception obedience to me wouldn't look like worship it would look like chasing after everything you desire without questioning where those desires lead you that's a pretty profound uh statement and I just not to make too many comments but something that stood out to me if if you were to look into your Bible in Matthew 5 uh Jesus would say you have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say that whosoever lookth on a woman and lust after have committed adultery with her already in his heart and If thy right hand offend thee pluck it out and cast it from the for it is profitable thee that one of the members should perish and not that the whole body should be cast into hell and if you look at that word offend it says to put a stumbling block or to entice to sin or to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and Obey or to see in another what I disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority so I just thought that goes hand in hand and if If thy right hand offend thee pluck it out get rid of it and H how Satan wants to deceive just like he did Eve Eve Eve didn't want to disbelieve God she didn't she loved God and wanted to serve him but the the the serpent came in with that subtility and and deceived her into thinking that her her decision wasn't contrary to the word and accomplished the very HB of the word of God and brought her out from the protection of the word and so I just thought man if if if if your right hand offend the if it's going to cause you uh um to to quit serving the lord or to lose trust in the Lord I figured you know how many of you are going to pluck out your eyeball how many of you are going to cut off your hand well then let's not let our eye be offended let's let's not let our hand be offended let's possess our vessel in sanctification and honor it reminded me in a in in the Old Testament how uh the children of Israel during the days of Samuel Samuel was a judge at you know and a prophet and and one of the tribes of Israel the the I believe it was the amorites came up to them and and they were going to take control of them and jaes and them said okay you know what we'll serve you uh we'll make a covenant with you and and the Amit say okay we'll make a covenant with you on this one condition that all of you pluck out your right eye and if that's how Satan is you think that you're going to well I'll just miss this service I'll just miss that you give Satan an inch and he wants to take a mile sin will take you further than you want to go and and brother brandham said this and re rejected King he said that's what the enemy's always trying to do is pluck out both eyes if he can so that the people cannot see what they're doing That's what Satan tries to do today to every Christian is pluck out the spiritual sight that he can only follow the intellectual sense of things and not the sense of the Holy Spirit leading him I mean if if if you're right I offend you well let let's let's get some Zeal about ourselves we could go a lot into that story where Saul actually got under the spirit of the Lord and he got angry when he heard about that and and and went out to fight and I say you know we need to recognize that the devil's real and all of these subtle tricks and things he's causing in your life these little offenses it it's time we recognize the devil real and say you know what but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so I'm looking forward to what the pastor has for us this night now those even if you look back over some of the tapes we played brother Bram says he distorts the word you know what I mean I I I mean I just couldn't believe that they'd even write something like that but it the it's it's the devil speaking this is what I would do to you I wouldn't say there's no God nah you you wouldn't accept that but I just slowly get you to think about yourself and then I'd slowly bring this in and slowly and then I'd switch the word and then I would say who has the right to make my morals for me who's who who is the right to tell me what's good and evil you know what that's the spirit of Lady OA everybody has their right to their own decision in everything so I I just I thought I mean I mean he Satan's just coming right out and telling us what he would do and brother brandom told us that's what he was going to do from the beginning and It just fits like a glove and now we come down to that it's it's given to the Overcomer and and that's what we are we're the Overcomer like I said Sunday we're the 11th Hour worker the 11th Hour worker pick the same fruit off the same tree that all the other ages picked you know what I mean so it's the same word you know what I'm saying but every age Satan came in and they didn't want to go farther they wanted to take the word and match it to their feelings match it to their ideas and this is the age we get it a good so we're going to just play I'm going to shorten up the tape just a little bit of what I wanted to play uh but uh we'll we'll go ahead and and uh uh start to listen it's it's going to be about maybe 35 40 minutes but in the light of what Matthew read to you and the understanding that we have to recognize that devil and understand what overcoming is you understand and so it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it really what it is Satan tries to make it instances or situations or things and that's not where the battle is the battles in your mind because he's trying to get you to think and and discern and and Tak in information that we have no need to take in and and so it it's you just got to understand how he works so we're going to start you we I guess we could go ahead and stand if you'd like and and brother bram's going to say now let's turn to Revelations the 3r chapter at the church age uh repeating being a church age but now yeah yeah I could take just one text with the Holy Spirit preach on it a hundred years and never get what what's in it out because in this one text all other texts of the Bible are all tied together so I mean this is a a pretty important text isn't it so you know don't don't underestimate uh what you're listening to and don't don't fall into that trap oh I heard this tape before let them speak to you right tonight so what do you all want to be we all want to be what Overcomers because it's given to the what Overcomer so let's just listen at after brother Ram reads the scripture go ahead and take your seat God bless you enjoy the word of God and now let's turn to Revelations the third chapter at the church ages uh repeating a church age but now we are we uh there I could take this one text and with the Holy Spirit preach on 100 years and never get what's in it out because in this one text like all other texts of the Bible it's all tied together and I want to take my subject this morning of this how can I overcome now I've chose this because that I think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die amen we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day amen Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ believe and we must never let that Revival die within it now Revelations the 3r chapter and beginning with the 21st verse we read this to him that overcometh will I grant to set with me in my throne even as I overcome and am set down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches did you notice the the arrangements of that see set with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that's in his domain see and there as as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God Amen so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches a throne is over a domain and and the domain reaches just as far as it boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it now as we study this my purpose of this is just not to come here to to fellowship with you people which I love to do that but if if I had a chance to do that I would come to your home and shake your hand and talk with you and sit down eat dinner with you and set out on the shade tree and talk and fellowship a while but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God and here's where we come together yet in love with one another as only Christians can love but in year we are we are under a uh a a leadership of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is among us and we're here to be to take recking among us to see where our Shar places are our Shar comings and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are to where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people when they see the people the lot then they begin on that now soon I think that the church may be should be taken just a little step higher at this time I don't plan on doing it this morning ass showing these things but I I think shortly the Lord willing before we uh preach on those trumpets I want to to to bring the church just something that that you should know I believe now and now we are speaking on this overcoming the word overcome of course you know what what it means you've got to have something to overcome and this uh Church age that the Holy Spirit was speaking about here at the lady of sea church age as we have just been through it needed a rebuking Leia had to be rebuked because of it it's uh different towards Christ if uh had put Christ outside and in their age and Christ was on the outside trying to get back on the inside that's love after he had been put out of his own house was trying to come back in and said he that will open the door I'll come into him the church itself and whole had cut him out but now it notice his call here is not to just the church he that overcometh see not the church that be she see the church body but it's he that overcome the individual that will overcome now and Lady OA had it coming uh to now we see them knowing that this is the lady OA age and knowing at this age needs a sharp rebuke from God right it needs a sharp rebuke and when uh our clergy gets so soft and Doty like some age grandfather to his grandchildren every what they do is perfect and there it's been said so much that God is such a good god until they try to make God just a big doy grandfather you see but he is not he is a father and a father of righteousness of correction and love is always correcting love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's still corrects a real mother will correct your children a real dad will correct see if you just get soft and Doty and let it I was crossing an Old Log the other day down a a wash or what it's called a holler and I jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good looked like a big old beach log but when I jumped on oh great chunk of it fell off is real rotten and Doty I said that's the way that Christians are becoming they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long to become dirty they can hold no weight at all they they don't know what the overcoming means I begin to think of this text thing overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition see and it made it wor than ever went laid in the branch where the water was and then now you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and experience the joy of serving Christ and living in the church where such is going on he Roots twice as quick amen right living right under so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constant conly in the Life of Christ see because if don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and doth it not to him it sin and you become dirty rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ it you be fruit bearing we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this lady you see a church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than it's ever been and the powers of Satan is is many times harder to fight against than it was in any amen see here back there in the early ages a Christian for his profession of being a church belonging to Christ could be beheaded for he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly but now the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so uh deceiving this is a great uh age of deception when Christ said so the two spirits to be so close in the last days till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible see see remember Christ spoke of a elected people for the last day it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so close the people Soul live people can live a clean holy life not be uh sinful adulterers and Drinkers and Liars gamblers they can live about that and still not with it amen this is the the age of Life personal life of Christ for the the chemicals of his body the the what was in him first under justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel in service the word Sanctified means it's a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside far service set aside far service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service see and we'll notice when the unclean spirits gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptist Methodist those who believed in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body and finds a house garnished sweep clean living Pure Clean lives all right but then if that house isn't fill occupied then he comes in with h seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was at the first place that been better to stay Lutheran than it would to be to receive that life and fail to follow it so will the Pentecost you know what I mean the house is garnished as I talked to someone the other day he said they're very careful even many of the Holiness groups not to call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost CA they identify themselves to Pentecostals when they do that they say holy spirit keep from saying Holy Ghost because the Pentecostal common people just call it what the Bible says holy ghost which Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is the same thing but they're very careful about they don't want to be identified with them tongu speaking people and that's the Holy Spirit itself see what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification that washed out returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is J with the with the league of churches with the World Council of churches and the state now that connects it with the Roman Catholicism and all the rest of it and now it's seven times worse than it was when it that's where man takes it and then look at the lady of seea church H after has received the Holy Ghost and with the knowledge of and the spirit of God within it and then the works of God is denied by and called it an evil work then what about that that's where Christ has put out of his own church see he it never showed him in the church until it come to Lady OA and when he got to Lady OA he had been put out of his church trying to get back in now see justification never P him in sanctification just caims the place for but when the baptism of the Holy Spirit Come it putting in the people and now they turned out when he begin to show himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever they turn him out because they have denominated and the the spirit of the Lord don't agree with their denomination you understand now that they put him out we don't want nothing to do with this telepathy it's it's the devil it's foring telling see they don't understand eyes and can't see ears and can't hear see God only opens eyes as he will he hardens who he hardens he wishes to it and and gives life to those who he desires to that's what the scripture say now we see these hours that we're in this stage and we see what it was and the Holy Ghost is rebuking the age that put him out but in all that did you notice the him him that overcometh even in that worry Wicked Church age him that overcometh we find here that God has always had Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every age there's always every time and every age that there's been on the earth God has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness in the here he's never been without a witness though sometimes just once but somebody overcome now like the Saints of old and uh a very fine man a scholar was saying after the Seven Seals he said uh brother Brandon you being a a typist typologist rather said how in the world are you going to put that Church in the Rapture without the tribulation period in a TI he said you see if it's a type there's got to be uh there's got if it's an antitype there's got to be a type for that antitype to come from and everything I say that is true has a type it has a type you have a shadow and the Bible said the old things was a shadow of the new things to come he said but now you took the Old Testament as a shadow now he said what are you going to do with this church this man comes from a a great uh man great teacher that's a BM friend of mine very good man and he's a lovely brother and I I'd be Garr to say one word against the brother I wouldn't anyhow as as a as a Christian I wouldn't say nothing against him he he he don't agree with me on that one subject but he he's my precious brother we eat together and oh he's just a Dandy fell I take his magazine read his articles and he writes some of mine so forth and I've talk a many text out of what I I've read read of his articles hear him say he's a great man but he he just can't agree with me I appreciate that his sincerity though he don't just one of these pushover just has to grieve everything he say he's got his own conviction and he stands for I appreciate that and he's a good man of oh I I am not a teacher or scholar at all but this man's both teacher and Scholar but I I can't agree with him because I don't see it but the it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies the church it needs no I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period Church organization but the bride does not would you choose the woman you had to purify before you married her Christ's bride is chosen and she is elected and she's God's bride a bride of Jesus Christ and now he said how you going to type that if that bride Goes Forth goes up before she goes through the tribulation period I got scripture that shows you that the church is in the tribulation period I said just read The Sixth Seal that's all she's right there under the tribulation period but find out just before that the bride's unone amen she's in glory at that time she has no purification see he that believeth on me has everlasting life and shall not come in the condemnation or the Judgment but pass from Death unto life Christ gave the promise that we would not even stand at the Judgment so freely did he take my place and tell I'm absolutely free when I'm pardon I'm pardon how can you take me out of the pawn shop got a clear receipt of how can you be my redeemer and take me from the pawn shop and the broker still say I belong to him now I got a written receipt wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ see now in that here's where we come he said now how are you going to get separate that elected bride you talk about now how you going to put that under a type I said very good I say here it is now in Matthew the 27th chapter and the 51st verse if we let me just read it and then we we got it good then we find out whether it was hped or not where the elected bride Matthew the 27th chapter and the and the 51st verse all right we read this at the crucifixion of our law and behold the bail of the temple was written Twain From the top to the bottom now that was the law the law ended right there because the veil kept the congregation from the holy articles of God only an anointed priest went in there and that once a year remember now God with his own hand notice from the top to the bottom not from the bottom to the top there some 40 ft High notice not from the bottom to thep top but from the top to the bottom showed it was done by God rent The Veil and to then though anyone whosoever will make come and partake of his Holiness all right from top to the bottom and the Earth the quake and the Rocks Ren and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many amen there's that elected that bride not all of the Jewish Church come forth at that time all of them made the same sacrifice all of them has earned the shed blood of the lamb but there was an elected group and that elected group as soon as the event come that really believed that it was sincere sincerity now I'm coming to the word overcome now hold that the that had really overcome sincerely making the same offering that the rest of them made but in sincerity overcome the things of the world when the propitiation correctly was made for them they were in Paradise until that PL that time when that time was made they had overcome and was resting sleeping see many bodies of those that slept in the dirt see s now if we had time we could go all back to Daniel when Daniel that elected one that had overcome and he said close up the book Daniel for thou shall rest in thy light but when the prince shall come which will stand for the people thou shal stand in the heart it is Daniel this prophet of God saw the end time coming and he said Daniel you stand in your life is that day here he was come forth not all of Israel but the bride type of Israel now the rest of Israel don't come forth until the general resurrection and now at the coming of the Lord Jesus those who are really loving his ACC coming that's living for it when he appears in the sky amen the church that's dead and crash or rise and those be changed in a moment the rest of them know nothing about it remember appeared to those in the city see the the the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other and we'll see them the rest of the world won't see them and it'll be caught away amen as a secret going waiting for that time then returning back to the Earth that glorious Millennium then the Thousand Years the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years and then come forth the general Resurrection where all Israel and also look at there the 12 apostles the 12 Patriarchs all represented we ain't never got to that yet maybe the Lord willing we'll get to it in The Testament how those walls of Jasper and 12 Stones 12 gates 12 foundations all that's represented here they are on 12 Thrones The Angel messengers of those days to pass judgment upon those who rejected their message Hallelujah hey man there comes forth that great hour yeah what a day what a time that we're living how that we should check up church now we talk about these things coming that's going to come now today let's drop back here and see check ourselves and see if we're right in the faith now let's talk of a few Overcomers for a few minutes in the days of Noah time which was tight by Jesus Christ are being like today I supposed to have 10 minutes down be half hour I just get to started the first page I'll skip a few of them if I can get what in Noah time hype off today Jesus referred to it and said as it was in Noah's time so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in Noah's time so shall it be in the coming of the son of man notice there were all that anti luian World perhaps of millions of people there was eight Overcomers eight people overcome that was real genuine Overcomers there was Noah three sons and their wives and Noah and his wives eight overcome that entered the Ark at the approprate time how did they do it they listened to the word of God they wasn't caught outside the door they were caught inside the door praise God oh my beloved friend don't let that door shut Jesus said as it was in that day so shall it be in the coming of the son of man thank you so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now if somebody is going to get caught outside that door many of them might have had good intentions and someday if such things happen we'll go in with brother no because he's a fine fellow but you see it caught just ate inside amen now think hard now if you are laying around getting Doty get in hurry quick CU a door might close at any time and there's always been an arc in God's economy there was an ark in the days of Noah for the saving of his people that was an ark in the days of the law Arc of testimony in the days of the law they follow the ark and there is the third dispensation now like Noah's time lot's time and now this time there's an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither is it a good works that you do it's by one spirit amen Romans 81 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom Hallelujah one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by by Holy Ghost baptism amen see that's the only way you overcome is all that is under the shed blood is Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcomes come for you Lord you're resting how do I know then brother Brandon that I'm in there watch what kind of a life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but don't try to do it you ever try just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole see you just up down over and everything else see he can't do it put on your coold honey can't do it little arms up down and it takes your Steady Hand oh how glad I am now can just y my hand to Father say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the cold on me amen I quit trying just let him do it Hallelujah see if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we just hold still and let him do it just yield here Lord here I am yes yes let me be nothing y you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your ideas your things and surrender yourself to him he overcome far you he knows the way we don't but in those time there was eight Overcomers and that's what went in they were caught inside now look a friend I'll be taping this and if it's on a television or not t pardon me tape whatever you do who's listening now or who will listen here after the hour is very late and you do have good intention but be caught inside I don't struggle not him that willth or him that runneth but God just that God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he able to perform not joining one denomination another denomination running this that or the other trying this just yield yourself to God walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him that's right that's what told her brother that just had the the breakdown see just yield to him he's sh he who know what you have done and what caused your being you're doing this way and all that he knows all about you and now he's just told you back just what to do now I said only thing you have to do just go do it that is forget all about the Past walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God eight Overcomers in the days of Daniel's time there was four Overcomers that could stand the pest of fire and line now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my my brother back there also he that cometh to God must first be tested tested what with the word that's God's test do you believe it he that cometh the God must be tested that only shows a true child be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there's a test give to you and with test is given to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh amen the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you and I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said uh that our trials are worth more to us some precious goal hallelujah it's a testing time it's a one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried amen and Daniel a man a prophet Shadrach mesach and abedo Daniel was a prophet and that was the size of the church in that day I mean the bride there's lots of church about two million of them went down there but there was that was the size of the Overcomers and them Overcomers was put to the test every Overcomer has to be put to the test and when they said you take back what the word says or either be throw in the fire furnace they refused anything but the word and when Daniel was given a test that he should take back what the word said that they should lean towards the Temple of Solomon prayed and he would deliver him from all things God had hear from Heaven if it look towards the temple and prayed and said If any man prays Within These amount of days and we're am me so persus you cannot change or alter our laws that man will be thrown into the L then they set a trap for it I believe that Prophet knew that but they set a trap for him he walked humbly when it come time for him to pray when he know that the home place in Jerusalem that was a burning sacrifice on the altar Daniel wasn't afraid of them spies raised up the shades and threw back the shatters and knelt down on his knees and throw his hands up to God and prayed why live or die he had the victory therefore he so much Victory to the Lions couldn't eat it he he overcome amen the Shadrach mishak and bendo had some much victory until the line till the fire couldn't burn it you know Victory is a hard thing to burn out or eat up or anything so they they had it I might mention another character in the days of lot Jesus referred to it there were only three that overcome lot and his two daughters not even his wife didn't overcome she she started out she's a pipe wish we had time my 30 minutes is up right now see she was she done all right she left now I've got to give this to you just morning many of you has left too many of you left these things to take your stand after you search it through the scripture and find it right you seen the Vindication of almighty God but not what some what somebody said was a Vindication what the Bible said would be in here it is do you thought it was the truth so you set out to leave Sodom leave the denomination amen leave the things that bind you to a Creed and to follow Christ by the Holy Spirit vindicating himself by the written word of God in other words you took the Bible instead of the Creed amen you set out to follow well Lot's wife did the same thing you know she set out to go with L follow her husband her children her loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world so it's possible you can make a start and still be the world in you see she never overcome and even though she was well on the road it finally overthrow her you had to take that one big long last look that's what she got caught don't even look back don't have no desires keep going put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ see she started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome or she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom of lot but she wanted to go back and have her haircut you know she had to go back she just couldn't stand the the test she had to look back again to see what the rest of them was doing oh you know I had some good friends down there after all and after all this might be just a little a little move I don't know whether it could be right or not I've only got this man's word for though he's my husband but yet uh your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking see now whether it it could be a ride or not I don't know maybe his Revelation wasn't right then if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the word of God then then you can't go you got to be really sold out that's right you got to know Hallelujah not just say well I see others doing it I see a sign you know Israel started out I could say the same thing and bring it in here they started keep going but I'll save some of it uh for next Wednesday night but you got to be sold out you know what I mean it and and and that's just uh that's just how it is you've got to know what you have is it you you know what I'm saying you that's what you got that you've got you can't you can't overcome if you're tossed between two opinions so if you just you come to the place that you you know this is the word now you know it it's funny that in this tape I heard you mention that weekend you know my testimony that the church would go through the tribulation well brother bram's talking about the teachers that preached that and then we heard it and then I heard this and heard that and you know you had to choose something you had to make your choice you had to you had to go so you've got to know it's the word and and and and I just want to make this point so you can and we'll we'll grow on it later now this Sunday morning cosin's going to preach for us and and and uh you know kind of a preach for us before he heads to uh Europe to start his church there and uh and then uh so he's got to interpret for his dad and I want to hear his dad preach so uh I love his preaching so I'm going to try to get him to preach Sunday night if I can stay on my knees hard enough to pray him through but it's it's something that that I I I I read in taking sides with Jesus so really in essence these two things tie together taking sides with Jesus taking the word because that's the only thing you can overcome it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it if you rest in that word and you accept that word and you know that word will take you through the test you know it'll take you through the challenge you if not you'll get all frustrated with yourself okay so it's and and brother Bram says it's this it this way and maybe I just want to just leave sew this little thought in your mind to build on maybe some of you'd like to go on and pick up this tape and continue uh reading it and so he's he's talking about how people were criticizing him for going to the doctor him having the Great Divine gift you know and and they said well you know uh he he she said when his children get sick he takes them to the doctor and brother said anybody that's sensible would do the same thing people can't understand that medicine is sent from God all right so the word of God is medicine yes right it it's food it's life it it it has an effect so he he's he's making a point here and I just want to lay this point out there if I could because you're talking about overcoming so you've got to know the word is the medicine for the sickness no matter what it is okay no matter what problem it is depression Finance worry uh anything that shouldn't be normal in a Christian's life fear should not be in our lives okay worry should not be in our lives that's Satan trying to put it all that on us and when he starts putting that stuff on us we should stand back and say that's not normal well there's a medicine for that the medicine isn't your mind it isn't yourself you can't overcome it you can't fight it you've got to get the medicine that's given for it and guess when I went through that thing when I was had all the skin falling off me I couldn't figure out what it was and when I found went to the doctor and they oh you need a little cream here because you got your skin dries out there and it's something that's causing it I got this little cream put it I was gone unless he said we should have known that wasn't normal I should have known that wasn't normal this isn't normal but here I'm doing everything and it's not normal but once I got the Medicine it went away so no matter what you're coming to if you're going through something and it doesn't have peace Joy longsuffering all the attributes of the Statue of a perfect man you got malice or any of these other things you need to stand back and say that's not normal there's a medicine for it there's a medicine for it the medicine works by [Music] itself the doctor doesn't fix you the medicine fixes you okay now listen what he says he says any anybody that's senseful would do that people can't understand that medicine is sent from God why brother if it is not it's of the devil sure it is God is where medic God is where medicine won't reach certainly medicine is of god well you say I know a lot of doctors oh yes I know a lot of preachers is the same way too it's not the man that's handling it it's what it is it's not the man that's handling it it it's what it is I know many man is handling the word of God don't believe in Divine Healing it's not the man that's handling it it's what it is it's not the man that's handling the medicine that doesn't affect the medicine the medicine is what it is the word is what it is the word is what fixes us the word is what overcomes the situation so it doesn't matter it's not the church it's not the man that's handling it's what it is so this is what the prophet God talking about he's talking about that relationship where you're totally sold out to that word and you know that word will work work for you if you're not sold out on the medicine that is going to do do the job or you start feeling a little bit better you you abandon it you know I'll get sick I'll go to the doctor doctor gives me some antibiotics I take him for a week and then he says now finish it out finish it out well I put it in my shelf for next time and then a year later Les he's going through there and this one expired this one expired I said don't throw that away that's still good it's not the man who's handling it it is what it is by itself and then he goes on to say he said he said it it don't even don't even believe in he says there's many men handling the word of God that don't believe in Divine Healing don't even believe in God right but they handle it just the same there's many men out there with medicine and surgery and stuff that denies God and everything else but there's a many one that believes in them too so if the you know so if it helps the people it's of God but he goes on but the point that I got out of there was so amazing is that it's it's not the person that handles it it it it's what it is here come here brother come here I need you I need you k you come here you you come I just want to do this one little thing just to do an illustration you're good you stand here and you stand in the middle and you stand on the end now I'm going to give you something all right so now you have this okay you got that right now what what is it it's not C and if you don't know what that is your daddy ain't giving you enough flows all right it's a $100 bill right now he's got it right now he's got it is it still what it is it didn't matter who handled it it didn't lose its value because it is what it is now you say that but that could does he gets the word in the wrong hands he gets it he gets it in the spoken wrong but that doesn't change what it is it's still the only thing that'll overcome W it doesn't matter if he perverts it it doesn't matter if he says something about it he said how many men in our journey have we seen leave the message because they sincerely did didn't believe it and their want sold out and they couldn't go on all right so now he's got it right has it got the same value yes sir are you ready to give that away now he's got what is it is it the same as it was there it doesn't matter if this is the first age second Age first hour worker third hour work right none of that matters right it is what it is it is what it is it doesn't matter the time it doesn't matter when the prophet preached the message it didn't matter the man or who it is what it is and that's what's so important so what do you have in your hand that's good how much $100 so the same over there the same over there and the same here right is it your birthday [Applause] you that's that's how we overcome nothing affects us because it is what it is it it that's that's what it is it it it is what it is now isn't that funny that became a great big saying here in our day well it is what it is you bet Satan but it ain't what you say it is and and and and that's what the that's what the word of God is to it what what is the word of God to us it's it's it's truth it it's truth get it's overcoming power it it's reality it's what's really real it tells the future it tells what it's going to be the word is really the way it is everything outside the word is illusion because it is what it is and so as if if you go in this you'll just see how the prophet of God brings it down Through the Ages because it's never changed it is what it is and when you can kindly come to yourself and he he drew that great picture of that bride so it's not who's handling it right so you look at yourself and you say I've got the seed in me you know what I mean and and I'm a terrible Handler but he said don't put your trust in who's handling it is what it is and if you've been elected it is what it is if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life it is what it is if he called you it is what it is if you got a desire in your heart to be better it is what it is You' got to you he says you can't overcome yourself it is what it is he that is in you as Matthew brought out is greater than he who is in the world so that's what youve just absolutely when we start to overcome you start to realize hey I got called I've got elected I got chosen sorry it is what it is he said well wait a minute it's not who's handling it it's what it is and if he put it in there it'll do its job and you don't like the doctor that gave you the medicine and you don't take the medicine because of the doctor then you fall for the Handler but remember the word of God is what it is so God bless you tonight brother Billy you come close service and and you love the Lord we'll pick this up next Wednesday night and then brother Cosman will preach first this Sunday morning and
