[15:44] Junior, if you could just come and open
[15:46] our service in prayer.
[15:55] [Music]
[16:02] Happy to be in the house of the Lord. Uh
[16:05] my wife talked me out of wearing
[16:07] overalls to service this
[16:09] morning. But uh you know there's a lot
[16:12] of people have gathered this morning
[16:13] around a lot of things. You know,
[16:14] there's uh probably gatherings at
[16:17] hospitals around birth, around death,
[16:20] gatherings of family, and just I just
[16:23] trust that we have a singleness of heart
[16:25] and mind of what we've gathered together
[16:27] for this morning. And if you could just
[16:29] each one of you, let's approach him and
[16:31] give him the preeminence this morning.
[16:33] Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father,
[16:35] we're so thankful for this congregation
[16:37] that's come, Lord, in this assembly.
[16:40] Father, for we believe we've come that
[16:42] you would have the preeminence amongst
[16:43] us. And Lord, you'd have your will and
[16:46] way in this service. And Father, I'm
[16:48] opening my heart to you, asking that you
[16:50] would continue to deal with me, Father,
[16:53] and change me, Lord, and mold me into
[16:55] your image, Lord Jesus. And Father, that
[16:58] in this service, Lord, you know the
[17:00] needs of each one. And there's not one
[17:03] here you're not mindful of. And Father,
[17:05] maybe some came because they were told
[17:07] to or maybe even numb, oh God, that they
[17:10] knew it was the right thing, but just
[17:12] didn't even have faith to claim
[17:13] anything, Father. But Lord, we ask even
[17:16] now, Lord Jesus, that you would just
[17:17] begin to move and raise our faith and
[17:19] our expectation, Lord. And you're the
[17:21] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[17:23] Lord. And your word will accomplish that
[17:26] which you've sent it forth to do. And
[17:28] Lord, you have a bride that's showing
[17:29] forth your glory in this day. that
[17:31] Lord's the very image of your love and
[17:33] your grace. And Father, we're asking for
[17:35] that grace, oh God, to come and make the
[17:38] difference, Lord. That it would be your
[17:40] mercy that once again would come and
[17:42] forgive us of our unrighteousness.
[17:44] Forgive us of our iniquity, Lord Jesus.
[17:46] And Father, may we just find ourselves
[17:48] once again aware of your presence, Lord,
[17:51] that you're here. And you're here
[17:53] because you promised you would be. And
[17:55] where you are, there's good things. And
[17:56] darkness has to flee, Father. And Lord,
[17:59] we just rebuke any hindrance, Lord. And
[18:02] Lord, may we see Jesus, Lord. May we not
[18:04] see the flesh. May we not see carnality,
[18:07] Lord, but may we recognize deity in our
[18:09] midst, Lord. And we just commit this
[18:12] service to you and ask that you would
[18:14] have the preeminence, Father, and that
[18:16] our hearts would be pleasing to you. We
[18:18] ask these things in the precious name of
[18:20] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[18:24] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. I
[18:28] almost showed up in a tunic this
[18:29] morning. So, you could turn around and
[18:31] welcome someone in the house of God.

[43:17] [Music]
[43:30] It is it easy to end up in
[43:35] hell. Heaven built a
[43:38] [Music]
[43:41] barricade. Time brought in the
[43:45] wood and rusted the nails.
[43:49] But there's still something that stands
[43:53] in it your
[43:56] way. There is a cross in your
[43:59] [Music]
[44:02] way. A wall of mercy and
[44:07] grace. There's just one way your soul
[44:11] can be lost. You got to treble the
[44:15] blood.
[44:17] Climb over the
[44:22] cross. No, it's not easy to
[44:28] stray. There is a cross in your
[44:34] way. Hell is getting
[44:37] bigger. The gates open
[44:41] wide. The road gets water every hour.
[44:48] and your easy streets vivid. Just let
[44:53] big slide. You can skip down the
[44:57] lane. Just pickle
[45:02] out. There is a cross in your
[45:08] way. A wall of mercy and grace.
[45:14] There's just one way your soul can be
[45:19] lost. You got to trample the
[45:22] blood. Climb over the
[45:28] cross. No, it's not easy to
[45:35] streng. There is a cross in your way.
[45:39] There is a cross in your way.
[45:45] A wall of mercy and
[45:49] grace. There's just one way your soul
[45:54] can be lost. You got to trouble the
[45:58] blood. Climb over the
[46:03] [Music]
[46:04] cross. No, it's not easy to stand.
[46:12] There is a cross in your
[46:17] way. No, it's not easy to
[46:23] stray. There is a cross in
[46:28] your way.

[59:14] life. It's all joy. It's all peace.
[59:23] Lord, what we would I don't know what
[59:26] we'd do without
[59:28] you. Father,
[59:30] you're you're our whole hope.
[59:34] We just ask this morning that you'd make
[59:38] yourself known to each of us
[59:44] personally, that we could find the great
[59:47] comfort that you have to offer, that we
[59:50] would sacrifice and sell all out for
[59:52] you, Lord. We just ask again this
[59:55] morning that you be with us and you
[59:57] touch
[59:58] us in Jesus precious and wonderful name
[1:00:03] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[1:00:08] morning on our our fellowship Sunday.
[1:00:12] Uh, I I didn't quite bring my overalls,
[1:00:15] but I I did wear a sho I had a shirt and
[1:00:18] tie on, and when I got here to church
[1:00:20] and and and Billy said, "I thought we
[1:00:23] were going to wear shirts." I said,
[1:00:24] "Yeah, I brought one." So, I put it on
[1:00:27] this morning. So, I I'm happy to to be
[1:00:31] here. Would you open your Bibles with me
[1:00:33] to the book of James? Thank you,
[1:00:35] musicians. certainly enjoyed the songs
[1:00:37] and and the singing and and uh uh you
[1:00:43] know uh it's amazing just how when I
[1:00:46] first came into the message and and what
[1:00:49] music was available, how music and and
[1:00:53] things have changed over time and
[1:00:55] different singers have come along. Uh
[1:00:58] but the gospel keeps going forward,
[1:01:01] doesn't it? So we want to turn to the
[1:01:03] Gospel of James.
[1:01:06] the first chapter of James. And we uh
[1:01:11] want to use this as our scripture this
[1:01:13] morning. I I'd like to uh if I have it a
[1:01:18] little title. It's called Believing or
[1:01:23] Living Running or Fighting for the
[1:01:26] Gospel. So believing or living the
[1:01:29] gospel and kind of a sub a thought
[1:01:33] running or fighting. Amen. So we'd like
[1:01:37] to start here
[1:01:38] in James the first chapter and the
[1:01:43] 22nd verse. And in James speaking here,
[1:01:48] he says, "But be ye doers of the word
[1:01:52] and not hearers
[1:01:55] only, deceiving your own selves.
[1:02:00] For if any man be a hearer of the word,
[1:02:05] and not a doer, he is likened unto a man
[1:02:11] beholding his natural face in a
[1:02:16] glass. For he beholdeth
[1:02:19] himself, and goeth his way, and
[1:02:23] straightway forggetth what manner of man
[1:02:27] he was.
[1:02:30] But whose lookketh into the perfect law
[1:02:35] of liberty and continue
[1:02:38] therein, he being not a forgetful
[1:02:42] hearer, but a doer of the work, this man
[1:02:47] shall be blessed in his deeds. For if
[1:02:51] any man among you seem to be religious
[1:02:55] and bridleth not his tongue, he
[1:02:58] deceiveth his own heart, this man's
[1:03:01] religion is in vain. Pure
[1:03:05] religion and undefiled before
[1:03:08] God and the father is this to visit the
[1:03:13] fatherless and widows in their
[1:03:15] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:03:19] from the world. Heavenly Father, we
[1:03:22] certainly ask you to bless your word to
[1:03:24] us this morning in Jesus precious name
[1:03:27] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You
[1:03:31] may be seated this morning.
[1:03:35] not nice to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:03:37] And uh they they're going to have some
[1:03:40] hamburgers and hot dogs. Uh after
[1:03:43] service, they're going to be serve
[1:03:45] outside in the pavilion. They'll also be
[1:03:48] serving in the fellowship area. The we
[1:03:51] have seating in both places for you. And
[1:03:54] and uh so we just hope that you have a
[1:03:57] wonderful time. you know, uh, uh, it's
[1:04:02] it's nice for me this morning to have
[1:04:05] brother Gary and Sister Barbara. I guess
[1:04:08] brother Gary and Sister Barbara, you're
[1:04:10] probably my oldest friends in the
[1:04:11] message now. I think 1971, wasn't it?
[1:04:15] Yeah.
[1:04:16] So, anybody here? Well, not too many of
[1:04:20] you were here before
[1:04:23] 1971, but uh uh I met brother uh Gary
[1:04:28] and Sister Barbara in Montana when I
[1:04:32] first got up there. Uh kind of come up
[1:04:36] uh you know, just a little hippie boy,
[1:04:40] remember? From uh from California.
[1:04:44] And uh we come up up to Montana and they
[1:04:48] had come up and and and we met up there
[1:04:52] and it's uh been a a long road from
[1:04:55] there to here. But he's been on it with
[1:04:58] us all the way, hadn't he? And and
[1:05:01] that's with good. We've been through
[1:05:03] some thick and we've been through some
[1:05:05] thin, but we've never been through
[1:05:07] anything without him because he promised
[1:05:11] that he'd never leave us nor forsake us,
[1:05:14] but he be with us even in us all the way
[1:05:18] to the end. And so, uh, in in my heart
[1:05:24] this morning, uh, I I just wanted you to
[1:05:28] have a a little time of fellowship with
[1:05:31] us because we know that that, uh, we are
[1:05:37] certainly in perilous times. Would
[1:05:41] anybody agree with that? Uh uh it it
[1:05:45] it's certainly times of uncertainty and
[1:05:49] uh uh I I I like the uh uh you know if
[1:05:55] you listen to the news everybody's
[1:05:58] worried about this, everybody's worried
[1:06:00] about that. One side's screaming at the
[1:06:03] other side and and you know we've got a
[1:06:06] simple solution to life. It's called
[1:06:10] take sides with Jesus. you know,
[1:06:13] everybody wants you to take a political
[1:06:15] side, everybody wants to take this side
[1:06:17] or that, the other side. And and there's
[1:06:20] nothing lasting in the world but eternal
[1:06:24] life. And so that's what we definitely
[1:06:27] want to place our hearts in and we want
[1:06:31] to put our emphasis on is eternal life.
[1:06:35] And eternal life is a gift of God, lest
[1:06:38] any man should boast. So life eternal is
[1:06:44] something that God gives us and it's
[1:06:47] something that he wants us to know that
[1:06:50] we have. He doesn't want us to be
[1:06:54] wondering someday if we're going to go
[1:06:57] to the other side and then find out
[1:07:01] whether we have eternal life. I I don't
[1:07:04] want to live I've lived 75 years. I
[1:07:07] trust the Lord gives me another 15 uh uh
[1:07:12] by whatever he has in lot for me, but I
[1:07:15] don't want to live my life all my life
[1:07:18] doing all the things that I do and then
[1:07:21] go up there to find out whether I'm
[1:07:23] going to heaven or hell or
[1:07:26] not. You you you understand? I I don't
[1:07:29] want to live with that
[1:07:31] uncertainty. I I want to get it settled.
[1:07:35] I I I want to I I I don't want to have
[1:07:38] that question weighing over me because
[1:07:42] if I could answer that question now, if
[1:07:45] I could answer that question in my life
[1:07:47] that I know that I possess
[1:07:51] eternal life, not that I'm blessed by
[1:07:54] it, not that I know that it exists, not
[1:07:57] that I know that there's such a thing,
[1:08:00] but I know that I possess it. Amen. And
[1:08:03] I I can see this. I can see that water
[1:08:06] there. I can say it's a water. I can say
[1:08:10] that it's uh that it's uh it will quench
[1:08:14] my thirst. I can know everything about
[1:08:17] it. But I don't want to do that. I I
[1:08:20] just I don't want to just believe. I
[1:08:23] want to live. You understand? And I I
[1:08:27] want to live my life abundantly. And so
[1:08:30] I want to know that I can come to the
[1:08:32] place that this is mine. Now you can
[1:08:35] have yours, but this is mine. I I
[1:08:38] possess this. I drink this. I live by
[1:08:42] this. It's something that I have. It's
[1:08:45] not a carrot that's put out in front of
[1:08:48] me that they say if I live right, if I
[1:08:51] live right, if I live right one day, I
[1:08:54] might just get a chance to sip from this
[1:08:57] and then live under the fear that what
[1:09:00] happens if I didn't do something? What
[1:09:02] happens if I didn't get there? What
[1:09:04] happened when I finally came down to the
[1:09:07] hour and and I've been living for this
[1:09:10] drink and then I I don't get it?
[1:09:15] Well,
[1:09:17] that's that isn't even the kind of God
[1:09:20] that we serve.
[1:09:23] He wanted you to know he purchased
[1:09:26] salvation for you. Everything that you
[1:09:30] could do in your life or you've done in
[1:09:33] your life, he paid the price for it. He
[1:09:37] He He He bought that salvation. He
[1:09:40] purchased it. He paid the price for it
[1:09:44] and and he takes possession of what that
[1:09:47] he
[1:09:48] owns. And so he wants you to know that
[1:09:52] you're his. He wants you to know
[1:09:57] that you have eternal life. And with
[1:10:01] that knowledge of eternal life, you can
[1:10:05] live through any hardship that comes
[1:10:08] your way in this world. That's right.
[1:10:11] Whether it be sickness, whether it be
[1:10:14] trials, whether it be tribulations,
[1:10:16] whether it be the fiery darts of the
[1:10:19] enemy, you know this one thing beyond of
[1:10:22] a shadow of a doubt. There is a crown
[1:10:24] waiting for me. I have run the race.
[1:10:26] There's a reward waiting for me. In my
[1:10:29] father's house are many mansions. If it
[1:10:32] were not so, I would not have told you.
[1:10:34] I know that no matter what besets me
[1:10:38] here, no matter how difficult the
[1:10:41] battle, no matter the pain, the
[1:10:43] suffering, the sickness, whatever comes,
[1:10:46] it's not the end of the matter. The end
[1:10:48] of the matter is eternal life. And I
[1:10:51] have eternal life. I possess eternal
[1:10:54] life. Eternal life was a gift that was
[1:10:57] given to me. It was something that God
[1:11:00] put into me from the beginning of the
[1:11:02] world and the thoughts of the world. And
[1:11:05] so I can say, "Grave, where's your
[1:11:07] victory? Death, where's your sting?
[1:11:10] I have a crown waiting for me. I have a
[1:11:13] reward waiting for me." And it changes
[1:11:18] the the way that you live.
[1:11:22] And so the question is, are we believing
[1:11:26] or are we living?
[1:11:29] You know, we just don't want to be
[1:11:31] believers.
[1:11:35] We want to be livers of the word of God.
[1:11:39] James put it this way, just not hearers
[1:11:43] of the word, but doers of the word of
[1:11:48] God. And so we know that that
[1:11:52] uh we and we recognize the fact that and
[1:11:56] it's hard for us to accept the fact a
[1:11:59] lot of times but even in the age we live
[1:12:02] in. We know that we live in the lady and
[1:12:05] age. And if we would look around and you
[1:12:09] wanted to find we have the political
[1:12:12] world, we have the geographical world,
[1:12:15] but yet the world really is on the
[1:12:19] biblical calendar. The word of God
[1:12:22] determines the world. Not civilization,
[1:12:25] not education, not everything else. What
[1:12:29] what this age is was not determined by
[1:12:32] science. It wasn't determined by the
[1:12:35] universities. It wasn't determined by
[1:12:38] politics. It was determined by
[1:12:41] prophecy. Prophecy
[1:12:44] is modern events are made clear by
[1:12:48] prophecy. They're not made clear by
[1:12:51] politicians. They're not made clear by
[1:12:54] education. They're made clear by
[1:12:57] prophecy. And prophecy told us that in
[1:13:02] this last day, in the day that we live
[1:13:05] in, it would be like under the days of
[1:13:08] Noah. Okay? It would be likened under
[1:13:10] the days of Sodom and Gamora. And so
[1:13:15] prophecy has uh prophecy has determined
[1:13:20] uh uh what the world the condition the
[1:13:24] world's in. the days of Noah, they were
[1:13:27] married and given into marriage and and
[1:13:30] they were divorcing and and living in
[1:13:34] adultery and living in sin and and the
[1:13:37] moral corruption had had be set
[1:13:41] everywhere and so uh the reason that the
[1:13:44] world today I don't even think nowadays
[1:13:47] in the modern and and we're we're not
[1:13:50] talking about your past we don't care
[1:13:53] about your particular individual ual
[1:13:56] situation because most people's
[1:13:59] individual situation is a result of the
[1:14:02] age that they're living
[1:14:05] in. There's actually spirit uh in the
[1:14:09] land uh everywhere to destroy marriage.
[1:14:13] If couples get married, they they
[1:14:16] they're not filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:18] They're not born again. They just fall
[1:14:20] in love and they wonder why that their
[1:14:22] marriage falls apart. It's because
[1:14:24] that's the spirit that's in the land.
[1:14:26] It's the environment that you're living
[1:14:29] in. It's the surroundings that are all
[1:14:31] around you. Every television show, every
[1:14:34] music station, every song, every job,
[1:14:37] all the pressures is all designed by
[1:14:40] prophecy
[1:14:43] to break it down.
[1:14:46] So you you you've got to have something
[1:14:48] to carry you through
[1:14:51] the the the all the uh things that are
[1:14:56] going on with men and women's sports and
[1:14:59] and and uh uh the I think they call it
[1:15:04] the
[1:15:05] LBG
[1:15:09] QTXPZ or or whatever it is. It's it's
[1:15:13] all prophecy.
[1:15:16] They they just didn't come along and
[1:15:18] decide that it was spoken. It's going to
[1:15:21] get to this condition in the last day.
[1:15:25] You're it's going to be in your faith.
[1:15:30] And then you you're going to have to
[1:15:32] accept it. You're going to have to
[1:15:34] include it. You're going to have to live
[1:15:36] with it. You're going to have to respect
[1:15:39] it. You better not preach against it.
[1:15:42] Well, I'll tell you, it's the devil.
[1:15:44] It'll always be the devil. It is a
[1:15:47] perverted spirit. It is a demon that can
[1:15:51] be cast out.
[1:15:56] Someone said, "Well, you're going to get
[1:15:57] taken off of YouTube." Good.
[1:16:01] I don't like YouTube
[1:16:04] anyway. We don't stream for anybody else
[1:16:08] other than our congregation to stream.
[1:16:12] We're not preaching to the world. We're
[1:16:14] preaching to those that have assembled
[1:16:15] here this morning. We don't have a
[1:16:18] worldwide message. We don't have a
[1:16:20] worldwide ministry. We're not looking to
[1:16:23] influence everybody. If you're with us
[1:16:26] this morning and you're visiting with us
[1:16:28] this morning, we accept you as part of
[1:16:30] the family of God. You don't have to go
[1:16:33] to church here to be a part of the
[1:16:35] family of God. You got to be born again
[1:16:38] to be a part of the family of God. You
[1:16:41] got to have the Holy Ghost reigning in
[1:16:43] your heart to be a part of the family of
[1:16:46] God.
[1:16:47] And so we realize
[1:16:49] that because of the
[1:16:52] spirits and the day of
[1:16:55] prophecy and because of the battles that
[1:16:59] surrounds us, even the book of
[1:17:02] Revelations describing the Lady Oia age
[1:17:07] in the book of Revelations, it says to
[1:17:09] him that
[1:17:12] overcomemeth. And so we know that there
[1:17:17] is
[1:17:19] overcoming
[1:17:21] that is a part of life.
[1:17:26] You've got to overcome. Christianity
[1:17:29] never was here. It's a solution to every
[1:17:35] problem. No, it's a way of
[1:17:38] navigating every step of life. Amen.
[1:17:42] It's a way to navigate through the
[1:17:44] spirits of the world. It's a way to
[1:17:48] navigate through the battles. It It's a
[1:17:51] way of discerning the deceptions and the
[1:17:55] lies. It It's a understanding of of how
[1:17:59] to make choices.
[1:18:02] And so we realize and I I'll read this
[1:18:04] from this statement. I think it's a
[1:18:07] beautiful statement. He says, "And I
[1:18:09] believe that the greatest battle that
[1:18:13] was ever fought is now ready to go into
[1:18:17] action. I believe that God has been
[1:18:21] selecting his
[1:18:23] soldiers. I believe he's been dressing
[1:18:26] them, training them, and the battle
[1:18:29] front is now set, getting ready to
[1:18:33] start."
[1:18:34] Now, we understand that. We understand
[1:18:38] that that there was had to be an elected
[1:18:41] group of
[1:18:42] people. There had to be a people that
[1:18:45] was chosen. There had to be a gospel
[1:18:49] that came and called them out and
[1:18:51] separated them because God's word called
[1:18:55] for separation from unbelief from total
[1:18:59] separation from unbelief. Now, it's not
[1:19:03] God asking
[1:19:05] us to separate ourselves from unbelief.
[1:19:10] Oh, please separate yourself from
[1:19:12] unbelief. It wasn't like it wasn't like
[1:19:16] uh this is a a kind of an instruction.
[1:19:20] No, he called for it. So, in other
[1:19:23] words, when God called, he called. He
[1:19:26] said, "Let there be light." He He didn't
[1:19:29] hope light would appear. He he didn't he
[1:19:32] he didn't uh say uh go go find a candle.
[1:19:37] No. When he said let there be light, he
[1:19:40] spoke it. And when he spoke it, what was
[1:19:45] light appeared. So God interpreted what
[1:19:49] light was by bringing to pass what he
[1:19:52] spoke. And so if he if his word called
[1:19:57] for total separation, he didn't say,
[1:20:00] "Now I think it's a good idea that you
[1:20:03] separate yourself." No, he said, "I'm
[1:20:06] calling for total separation from
[1:20:10] unbelief." Therefore, there would be a
[1:20:12] people. There would be somebody that
[1:20:16] would come into existence that would be
[1:20:18] living on this earth that separated
[1:20:22] themselves from unbelief.
[1:20:25] Do you understand the difference?
[1:20:29] And that's where you come in.
[1:20:32] He selected the army.
[1:20:36] He chose
[1:20:38] you. You don't know why he chose you.
[1:20:43] It doesn't make sense why he chose
[1:20:45] you. You couldn't look at any of your
[1:20:48] lives. You couldn't look at your
[1:20:50] background. You couldn't come up with
[1:20:52] any reason in the world that he chose
[1:20:56] you except for his divine sovereignty.
[1:21:00] He didn't have to, but he did. He found
[1:21:04] me in California. Just a LA uh Southern
[1:21:09] California hippie.
[1:21:12] into rock and roll music, you know, hair
[1:21:15] all along and everything like that and
[1:21:19] and you know, just uh you know, just uh
[1:21:22] always, you know, smoking and out of my
[1:21:26] mind and all that stuff.
[1:21:31] It wasn't the ground.
[1:21:33] It was the seed.
[1:21:36] He put the seed there. He planted the
[1:21:39] seed. And he said if he planted it that
[1:21:42] he'd water it, that he would husbandry
[1:21:45] it. He would bring it to pass and he
[1:21:47] would perform the purpose for which he
[1:21:50] planted it for.
[1:21:54] You might have seen me back then. Maybe
[1:21:56] some of you seen the pictures and you
[1:21:59] would you wouldn't have believed it.
[1:22:02] This is not possible.
[1:22:04] But praise God, all things are possible
[1:22:07] with the father.
[1:22:10] He He does it because he
[1:22:16] said and he calls
[1:22:19] you and and you and you weren't perfect
[1:22:23] when he called you.
[1:22:26] It wasn't the point that you were
[1:22:28] perfect. He didn't wait till you got
[1:22:30] perfect to call you.
[1:22:33] Amen. He called you when he decided to
[1:22:37] call you. He knew who he was going to
[1:22:40] call. In fact, he he he he got your
[1:22:43] great greatgrandfather with your great
[1:22:45] great grandmother. He planned it all the
[1:22:48] way down. He knew the hour. He knew the
[1:22:50] time. He knew the place. He knew the
[1:22:53] condition. None of that mattered to him
[1:22:56] because what he speaks comes to pass. If
[1:22:59] he says by word I call for total
[1:23:02] separation from unbelief. I'm going to
[1:23:05] have a people that I'm going to separate
[1:23:08] from unbelief
[1:23:11] and I'm going to train
[1:23:13] them. I'm going to call them and I'm
[1:23:17] going to train them and there's going to
[1:23:19] be a
[1:23:23] battle. And that's the
[1:23:26] way he made it.
[1:23:29] That's the way he planned it.
[1:23:32] So, we find
[1:23:34] ourselves this
[1:23:36] morning in the world around us as it is.
[1:23:43] We're not trying to change the world.
[1:23:48] The world is spoken for what it's going
[1:23:51] to be. It has a different leader.
[1:23:55] It has a different power. It has the
[1:23:58] prince of the air. It has It's his
[1:24:03] world. It's his kingdom. It's his
[1:24:07] Eden. And we're not part of it. We're in
[1:24:11] this world. But we are not of this
[1:24:16] world. Oh, if I to ever get that, not
[1:24:21] only to sink into you as my brothers and
[1:24:24] sisters, but to sink in myself. I am a
[1:24:28] pilgrim. I am a stranger. I am walking
[1:24:32] through a land that is not mine. It
[1:24:35] belongs to somebody else. And the only
[1:24:38] thing that I can do that
[1:24:43] I'm instructed
[1:24:46] to do is to keep myself from being
[1:24:50] defiled by it.
[1:24:55] And it's not easy
[1:24:59] because the flesh wars against the
[1:25:02] spirit and the spirit against the flesh.
[1:25:05] And these two things are contrary. We
[1:25:08] have senses and we have emotions and we
[1:25:11] have all those things around us. But yet
[1:25:14] he that is in us is greater than he who
[1:25:18] is in the world. And that's where we've
[1:25:21] got to lay our trust. We can't let our
[1:25:23] faith waver. We can't let it waver about
[1:25:26] our children. We can't let it waver
[1:25:28] about our spouses. We can't let it
[1:25:30] waver. We've got a God that can change
[1:25:33] things.
[1:25:36] That's right. The word of God says the
[1:25:38] believing spouse sanctifies.
[1:25:44] But if we don't, we let darkness come
[1:25:46] in. We let doubt come in. We let
[1:25:49] wondering come in. So there's a battle
[1:25:52] that's going
[1:25:54] on. And you can't overcome without a
[1:25:58] battle.
[1:26:02] there's if you're going
[1:26:04] to, you know, make it to the
[1:26:07] mountaintop, you got to climb the
[1:26:09] mountain.
[1:26:11] You You know what I mean? That's that's
[1:26:14] the thing. So, it's
[1:26:17] given I I could just read it real quick
[1:26:22] if just to to turn to it and just real
[1:26:26] quick. In in the book of Revelations the
[1:26:29] 3 chapter, it says, "Behold, I stand at
[1:26:31] the door and knock."
[1:26:35] So this morning,
[1:26:38] retrusting that he's knocking at your
[1:26:40] heart.
[1:26:42] And you say, "He's not knocking at your
[1:26:44] mind." He wants something in your heart
[1:26:48] to respond to what Satan puts in your
[1:26:52] mind.
[1:26:56] So God works from the inside out.
[1:27:00] He puts something in you that speaks
[1:27:04] back. He puts something in you that
[1:27:07] stirs you up. It can be conviction.
[1:27:12] You know what I mean? It sometimes it
[1:27:15] it's just oh I I don't know how to
[1:27:18] express it. my
[1:27:20] vocabularies are not great enough. But
[1:27:25] sometimes it's it's just an awareness or
[1:27:28] maybe even like a sense of fear, godly
[1:27:31] fear, where all of a sudden it just
[1:27:34] comes over you. I I just don't think
[1:27:36] I'll do that.
[1:27:40] Why? Because he's working from the
[1:27:42] inside. That's right. Satan is an
[1:27:44] enticer.
[1:27:46] That's right. You know, I mean, he's
[1:27:47] always offering. He's always doing these
[1:27:49] things. So there there's a battle that
[1:27:53] that's
[1:27:54] on. And so he so
[1:27:59] there if
[1:28:00] Satan and we have an enemy, right? Satan
[1:28:04] is like a roaring lion going about
[1:28:07] seeking whom he may
[1:28:09] devour. So you're in this world, but
[1:28:13] you're not of this world.
[1:28:16] So you are an
[1:28:18] adversary to the worldly kingdom. That's
[1:28:22] right.
[1:28:26] You're not subject to it.
[1:28:29] You're not subject to its laws. That's
[1:28:32] right.
[1:28:33] Now, I'm not talking about the laws of
[1:28:35] the land because if you were a Christian
[1:28:40] and you lived
[1:28:41] 100% by the word of God, we wouldn't
[1:28:45] have to have jails.
[1:28:48] There would be no crime.
[1:28:50] There'd be no murder.
[1:28:53] There'd be no adultery.
[1:28:55] There'd be no alcoholism.
[1:28:58] There be no drugs.
[1:29:00] Everybody would come up to a stop sign
[1:29:03] and the person would get up and please
[1:29:06] my brother go first. Oh, thank you,
[1:29:10] brother. Can I help
[1:29:13] you? There'd be no
[1:29:16] pickpockets. It would be, "Oh, I I I
[1:29:20] heard that you lost your your job. Don't
[1:29:23] worry. We're all praying you get a job
[1:29:25] here. We're all going to pitch in and
[1:29:27] take care of you. We'll get your bills."
[1:29:29] You wouldn't have banks. You wouldn't
[1:29:30] have loans.
[1:29:35] No, you you when you if if you keep the
[1:29:37] law of Christ, you keep the laws of the
[1:29:43] land. All the laws of the land was was
[1:29:46] to put demons behind
[1:29:50] bars and then you end up with
[1:29:53] demons warning against demons, you know.
[1:29:57] But so he says this. So there had to be
[1:29:59] a place. There has to be a
[1:30:02] place and this is there's a mutual
[1:30:06] ground, a no man's land that they fight
[1:30:10] here at this place. They just don't one
[1:30:14] fight over here and one down here and
[1:30:19] one run over here. There's a battle
[1:30:23] front where they meet and test their
[1:30:30] powers. Two powers.
[1:30:33] How many know
[1:30:34] that? There's two
[1:30:37] powers. And there's got to be a place
[1:30:40] that they meet where they test their
[1:30:44] powers.
[1:30:47] When David and came and Israel came and
[1:30:51] the Philistines came, they picked a
[1:30:54] valley. I I don't know was it the valley
[1:30:56] of Jezrael? I forget which valley it
[1:30:59] was. And they they met at this place and
[1:31:02] the army stood there and Goliath came
[1:31:06] out and and he was wanted to test
[1:31:11] Israel. He says, "I'm here to test your
[1:31:14] power. Send your champion
[1:31:19] And everybody looked at Saul and
[1:31:22] everybody looked at their warriors and
[1:31:24] they looked at that. You know what? And
[1:31:26] and they didn't know how they were going
[1:31:28] to win that battle. You know why they
[1:31:30] they didn't know how they were going to
[1:31:32] battle? They forgot who their champion
[1:31:34] was.
[1:31:37] And then all of a sudden, a little
[1:31:39] shepherd boy comes out. Oh, he looked
[1:31:42] like a shepherd boy, but you know who he
[1:31:44] really was? He was the anointed king of
[1:31:47] Israel.
[1:31:50] That's who he was. He was God chosen,
[1:31:54] not man chosen.
[1:31:56] Amen. You're God chosen. You're not man
[1:31:59] chosen. I wouldn't have chose any of
[1:32:08] you. Guy told me one time, he said,
[1:32:10] "Everybody is in your church because you
[1:32:12] got mind control over them. I said,
[1:32:16] "Friend, if I had mind control, you
[1:32:19] wouldn't be
[1:32:25] here. If I had mind control and I was to
[1:32:28] pick my congregation, it would be Mark
[1:32:31] Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and and the
[1:32:35] Bass Brothers and and you know what I
[1:32:38] mean? Why fill the seats up with the
[1:32:41] poor of this world?
[1:32:44] Right? I have all multi-millionaires,
[1:32:47] billionaires.
[1:32:49] But God didn't choose billionaires. He
[1:32:52] chose the poor of this world, rich in
[1:32:54] faith. Hallelujah.
[1:32:59] And Israel forgot
[1:33:02] who their champion was. Little shepherd
[1:33:04] boy comes up there. The first thing he
[1:33:07] wants to know, who is this Philistine
[1:33:11] that defies the armies of the living
[1:33:14] God?
[1:33:17] You know what David did? He went back to
[1:33:20] the Red Sea.
[1:33:23] He went back to Joshua.
[1:33:25] He went back to the victory. He went
[1:33:27] back to the son. He went back to all the
[1:33:30] promises that were given in the book. He
[1:33:33] knew a Messiah had to come. He knew that
[1:33:36] this wasn't according to the word of
[1:33:38] God.
[1:33:40] So he went up
[1:33:41] there. He was going to meet
[1:33:44] him. He met him on the
[1:33:47] ground, but he didn't meet him in the
[1:33:50] same power.
[1:33:54] Goliath wanted to meet him with military
[1:33:57] power, might, military strength. David
[1:34:01] was on the same
[1:34:02] ground, the same battlefield, fighting
[1:34:06] the same war, but he wasn't fighting it
[1:34:09] with the same power.
[1:34:13] And we don't fight the battles of this
[1:34:15] world with the power of this world.
[1:34:20] Our victory is in intellect. Our victory
[1:34:23] is in education. Our victory is in
[1:34:26] science. Our victory is faith.
[1:34:31] We overcome by faith in God's word. We
[1:34:35] overcome because God's word's a reality
[1:34:37] to us. That God's word can't fail. It'll
[1:34:40] never fail. It's the same yesterday,
[1:34:43] today, and forever.
[1:34:47] We don't have to back down. That's
[1:34:49] right. You might be smarter. You might
[1:34:52] be more technically advanced. You might
[1:34:55] you might understand psychology better,
[1:34:58] but I don't come to you in the name of
[1:35:00] science.
[1:35:03] I come to you in the name of the Lord
[1:35:05] God of Israel.
[1:35:10] He said, I'm going to put you on my
[1:35:11] spear and feed you to the birds. He
[1:35:14] said, I'm going to chop your head off
[1:35:17] because he
[1:35:19] come in the
[1:35:21] power of the gospel.
[1:35:24] You know why? Because David won the
[1:35:26] battle in his mind first.
[1:35:33] He already had it settled in his mind.
[1:35:37] Shadrach, Meach, Ned.
[1:35:40] Oh, the king said, "You're going into
[1:35:42] the fire."
[1:35:46] I I love those guys. I'm longing to meet
[1:35:50] them.
[1:35:51] They wouldn't eat the king's food. They
[1:35:53] wouldn't defile themselves. They kept
[1:35:56] themselves clean. They kept themselves
[1:35:58] free from all their religions, all their
[1:36:00] foods, everything. And you don't think
[1:36:02] God didn't raise them up?
[1:36:05] They didn't compromise. And they were
[1:36:08] the rulers.
[1:36:11] That's the trouble with us. We think we
[1:36:13] got to compromise to get our job. We
[1:36:16] think we got to compromise for God to
[1:36:18] provide for us. We think we got to
[1:36:21] sacrifice the word of God.
[1:36:24] They didn't sacrifice.
[1:36:27] And they didn't get an ugly
[1:36:29] spirit. Oh, king, you're going to hell.
[1:36:35] You You could have thrown me in that
[1:36:37] fire. You know, they said, "Oh,
[1:36:41] king, live
[1:36:46] forever. You're not my enemy, king.
[1:36:51] live
[1:36:52] forever. Our God
[1:36:55] is able
[1:36:57] to deliver us.
[1:37:00] But if he doesn't, we will not bow down.
[1:37:04] Because they they settled it in their
[1:37:06] mind. They already settled it in their
[1:37:09] mind that they that they were going to
[1:37:11] serve God regardless of the price,
[1:37:14] regardless of the future. the future
[1:37:17] wasn't going to determine whether they
[1:37:19] serve God. They that the future was
[1:37:22] going to be determined by the way that
[1:37:25] they serve God.
[1:37:28] And when you set in your
[1:37:30] heart that you're going to serve God
[1:37:33] regardless
[1:37:35] the future, you'll change the future.
[1:37:42] But if you're navigating the
[1:37:45] future by what you believe and you're
[1:37:48] going to have to make
[1:37:49] adjustments as you go along, I say make
[1:37:53] the adjustments once and for all. As for
[1:37:57] me and my house, we'll serve God.
[1:38:02] You've already got that
[1:38:05] settled. And then come what
[1:38:10] may? Lot of godly
[1:38:14] apostles meant their
[1:38:18] death, hung upside down, beheaded, all
[1:38:22] kinds of things. You think they gave up?
[1:38:24] Do you think they said, "Oh, if God was
[1:38:27] with me, I wouldn't be going through
[1:38:29] this."
[1:38:32] What
[1:38:34] if? I had a saying when I first became a
[1:38:37] Christian. If
[1:38:40] wise, ifs, buts and
[1:38:44] wise. If and buts and wise are all
[1:38:50] Satan's lies.
[1:38:55] Oh, you this is what the but
[1:38:58] or
[1:38:59] if or and
[1:39:02] No, we don't add to. We don't take away.
[1:39:06] We live by God's word. Either we're
[1:39:10] going to be believing
[1:39:11] it or we're going to be living it. A lot
[1:39:15] of people believe it, but when it comes
[1:39:18] down time to live
[1:39:23] it, they won't
[1:39:25] fight. They'll
[1:39:28] run. So, the battle's there. David won
[1:39:31] that battle in his mind. He already done
[1:39:35] it. He says, he says there's a battle
[1:39:39] front where they meet and test their
[1:39:42] powers, where each army test it strength
[1:39:45] against the other army. A mutual meeting
[1:39:49] place. Now,
[1:39:51] don't miss
[1:39:57] this. When this great battle started on
[1:40:01] earth, there had to be a mutual meeting
[1:40:05] place and there had to be a place
[1:40:07] selected for the battle to begin and for
[1:40:11] the battle to rage. And that
[1:40:14] battleground began in the human
[1:40:21] mind. There's where the battle
[1:40:25] started. The human mind was the chosen
[1:40:30] for for the place of the battle where it
[1:40:35] was begin and that is
[1:40:39] because that decisions are made from the
[1:40:44] mind the
[1:40:46] head. Now they never started in some
[1:40:50] organization. They never started in the
[1:40:53] form of some mechanical affair. the
[1:40:56] ground never started there. Therefore,
[1:40:59] that organization can never never do the
[1:41:02] work of God because the battleground
[1:41:05] where you've got to meet your enemy is
[1:41:09] in the mind. You've got to make your
[1:41:13] choice.
[1:41:15] It meets you.
[1:41:20] You don't have a choice.
[1:41:24] You can either
[1:41:26] run or you can fight.
[1:41:30] But it's going to meet you.
[1:41:34] And so many times with
[1:41:37] believers, a situation
[1:41:40] arises, financial,
[1:41:43] medical,
[1:41:44] spiritual,
[1:41:46] social, family, all kinds of battles
[1:41:50] arise.
[1:41:52] You you don't you didn't choose for him
[1:41:54] to rise. You didn't wake up in the
[1:41:57] morning and say, "Oh, God, send me a
[1:41:58] family conflict
[1:42:01] today." You know what I mean? I really
[1:42:03] have been praying that I have it out
[1:42:05] with my
[1:42:08] mother-in-law. No, you don't do
[1:42:12] that. You don't get up in the morning
[1:42:14] and pray for, "Oh, Lord, just tempt me
[1:42:17] today beyond that which I'm able to
[1:42:19] bear.
[1:42:22] No, it meets you.
[1:42:25] Satan is like a roaring lion going about
[1:42:28] seeking whom he may devour. You didn't
[1:42:31] ask for that devil. You didn't ask for
[1:42:34] that lion. You weren't looking for him.
[1:42:39] But he finds you. He studies you. He
[1:42:43] looks for your weak spot.
[1:42:48] But the one thing he can only do, his
[1:42:51] only place of the battleground is your
[1:42:53] mind.
[1:42:58] He starts sewing seed in your
[1:43:06] mind. And you can do one thing. You can
[1:43:10] fight or you can run.
[1:43:14] You can believe or you can
[1:43:19] live but you can't escape
[1:43:22] it. I wish we
[1:43:25] could but you can't. It meets
[1:43:30] you. He says decisions are made in the
[1:43:34] mind the head. There is where Satan
[1:43:37] meets you and the decisions are because
[1:43:42] that's God made it man that way. He made
[1:43:50] you. So when the battle strikes your
[1:43:55] mind that you have to make a
[1:43:59] decision, you can't
[1:44:02] run because if you don't
[1:44:05] fight then and you run from it, you
[1:44:11] don't deal with it. You don't face it
[1:44:14] headto head. You don't admit, I'm going
[1:44:17] through a mental battle. I'm going
[1:44:20] through temptation. My faith is being
[1:44:22] tried. This is the fiery darts of the
[1:44:25] enemy.
[1:44:29] But if you
[1:44:32] run, you've already you you can't win if
[1:44:36] you're
[1:44:38] running and you're not living when you
[1:44:42] run.
[1:44:46] I had a friend one time he decided that
[1:44:49] income tax was unjust and
[1:44:53] unfair. He got so ate
[1:44:56] up with not paying
[1:45:02] taxes that everything he did he did in
[1:45:05] cash.
[1:45:06] Every time he would go to a job, he'd
[1:45:08] work something out where somebody else
[1:45:11] got the money and they could take a
[1:45:12] percentage and give him and he ran from
[1:45:15] the federal government. Wouldn't take a
[1:45:17] surgery, wouldn't fill out any paperwork
[1:45:19] and everything. You think he was
[1:45:21] free? You think he was free from taxes?
[1:45:25] He was
[1:45:27] enslaved to
[1:45:30] taxes. He didn't even realize it.
[1:45:36] running. Run run run
[1:45:38] run.
[1:45:41] No, he died
[1:45:43] broke with
[1:45:48] nothing. And all he could say, I didn't
[1:45:51] pay
[1:45:53] $50,000 worth of taxes. You never had a
[1:45:56] house. You never could buy a new car.
[1:45:59] And you call that living?
[1:46:03] You can't live without fighting.
[1:46:08] You can't overcome without fighting.
[1:46:14] You can
[1:46:15] believe and still run.
[1:46:19] But you can't live without fighting.
[1:46:23] Because in order to live and to sit with
[1:46:25] the father on his throne, you must
[1:46:28] overcome.
[1:46:33] It meets
[1:46:35] you. So I I God made it that way. I I
[1:46:38] I'd like to say this morning, oh, you
[1:46:40] become a Christian, life's a bed of
[1:46:42] roses. Peter said, think it not strange
[1:46:45] the trying of your
[1:46:48] faith. Think it not strange that it's
[1:46:51] going to come against you.
[1:46:53] Think it not strange that you that every
[1:46:57] website out there is blasting the
[1:46:59] message of the
[1:47:01] hour. All
[1:47:04] intellect, all social
[1:47:09] comparison, all
[1:47:15] modernism. Say heaven's not going to
[1:47:17] have one skyrise in it.
[1:47:21] not going to have one
[1:47:23] automobile. It's going to be no
[1:47:25] artificial anything about it. Nowadays,
[1:47:28] they don't even trust you. They don't
[1:47:31] want your intelligence. They want
[1:47:33] artificial
[1:47:35] intelligence. Get
[1:47:41] AI. I I I'll guarantee you some people
[1:47:44] wish they just had a chip they could
[1:47:45] plug in their wife's head, you know what
[1:47:47] I mean? and make her just do that with
[1:47:50] the cook me
[1:47:52] dinner, make my
[1:47:59] bed. What What's happened to
[1:48:03] us? We're
[1:48:06] Christians. We live the word of God.
[1:48:10] We live by faith.
[1:48:12] We don't we don't let those thoughts
[1:48:15] come into our mind.
[1:48:18] We don't we don't care what's going on
[1:48:21] out
[1:48:23] there. I don't care what the internet
[1:48:26] says. I got another
[1:48:29] voice. I got something else that talks
[1:48:31] to me. It ain't a rap star.
[1:48:35] It ain't a radio station. It ain't a
[1:48:37] ball player.
[1:48:41] You tell me how how what does it
[1:48:42] profitth a man if he gains the whole
[1:48:45] world and loses his
[1:48:48] soul? You tell me who's smarter. The guy
[1:48:51] that's got all kinds of jet planes and
[1:48:54] boats and islands and all kinds of money
[1:48:57] and he just worries about how he's going
[1:48:59] to keep it and he needs to make more
[1:49:01] because he's got to show everybody how
[1:49:03] powerful he is and everything. And and
[1:49:05] he's, oh, I give to this university. I
[1:49:08] give to and it's all temporal. It's all
[1:49:11] carnal. It's all going to be done away
[1:49:15] with. And then you've got eternal
[1:49:19] life. What's going to happen to you when
[1:49:22] you die? You know what they do? They
[1:49:24] run. I don't believe in
[1:49:26] God. I don't believe in life after
[1:49:28] death. You think because they don't
[1:49:31] believe in life after death, there's no
[1:49:33] life after death. Who do they think they
[1:49:35] are? God said it's appointed for once to
[1:49:39] man to live and then the judgment.
[1:49:43] So you just tell me. Is it the God of
[1:49:46] the Philistines or is it the living God
[1:49:48] of Israel?
[1:49:51] Is it the words of our Lord and Savior
[1:49:54] or is it the words of of of religion and
[1:49:57] education and science and and this world
[1:50:01] and the newspaper?
[1:50:03] Man, some people thinks Fox News is the
[1:50:08] Messiah. You know, you got to worry
[1:50:10] about a
[1:50:12] fox. The most cunning of
[1:50:16] all
[1:50:19] animals. I think they referred to as a
[1:50:22] sly fox.
[1:50:26] Sorry for all you people
[1:50:31] that he
[1:50:33] says, "God, let none of them miss it."
[1:50:38] See, it's your mind that opens the door
[1:50:42] or closes the
[1:50:47] door and listens to your conscience,
[1:50:52] listens to your memory, listens to your
[1:50:56] affections, but when your mind closes
[1:50:59] itself to these things and lets God, the
[1:51:04] Holy Spirit of the word come in,
[1:51:08] It blows the rest of the stuff
[1:51:13] out. Every doubt is gone. Every fear is
[1:51:18] gone. Every sensation of doubt is gone.
[1:51:23] Every feeling is gone. There's nothing
[1:51:26] standing there but the word of God. And
[1:51:30] Satan cannot battle against that.
[1:51:36] No sir, he cannot battle against it. Now
[1:51:40] we know that's true.
[1:51:47] What's he do? He gets you to open your
[1:51:50] mind. That's all Satan wants to do is
[1:51:54] just get you to reason, just get you to
[1:51:57] think, just get you to compare, just get
[1:52:01] you to consider. What about this? What
[1:52:04] about that? What
[1:52:07] if? But well, and
[1:52:12] why?
[1:52:13] Anything to get you to open your
[1:52:19] mind. And if you open your
[1:52:23] mind, then he gets you to
[1:52:27] thinking. And thinking is another form
[1:52:29] of reasoning. Then you get figuring it
[1:52:32] out. Why do I Why am I sick? I don't
[1:52:35] know why I'm sick. God knows why I'm
[1:52:37] sick.
[1:52:42] God's my healer.
[1:52:46] Well, what happens if he don't heal you?
[1:52:47] If he don't heal me, he wants to take me
[1:52:49] home.
[1:52:50] If he don't heal me, he wants me to v be
[1:52:53] victorious. Paul said, I sought the Lord
[1:52:56] thrice for my healing. And then he spoke
[1:52:59] to me and he said, "My strength is made
[1:53:01] perfect in weakness." You're sick, so
[1:53:04] I'm sick.
[1:53:06] I'd rather be sick in body than sick in
[1:53:09] soul.
[1:53:10] Sickness never measured my salvation.
[1:53:14] Sickness never said whether I had the
[1:53:16] Holy Ghost or not. I believe God. I
[1:53:19] believe he's a healer. Whether he heals
[1:53:21] me or not, he's got a reason for
[1:53:24] everything he does.
[1:53:29] If we had our religion, there wouldn't
[1:53:31] have been one martyr.
[1:53:34] Nobody would ever give their life. If we
[1:53:37] would have had our mental religion,
[1:53:39] Stephen would have never been stoned.
[1:53:45] Oh, wait. God so powerful. How did
[1:53:48] Stephen get stoned? Stephen was happy to
[1:53:51] lay down his life. I see. Oh, his last
[1:53:55] moments when they grab them stones, he
[1:53:58] says, "I see him sitting at the right
[1:53:59] hand of God."
[1:54:05] No. If he he gets you trying to figure
[1:54:08] out life, I don't have to figure out
[1:54:10] life. That's right. The footsteps of the
[1:54:12] righteous are ordered by the Lord. Why
[1:54:15] is my husband going through this time?
[1:54:17] Why is my wife going through this time?
[1:54:19] Why am I having trouble on this job? Why
[1:54:22] am I having you know why you're having
[1:54:22] trouble? You're thinking too much.
[1:54:29] We should all go back to
[1:54:31] kindergarten. Stop, look, and
[1:54:35] listen. They don't probably don't even
[1:54:37] teach that anymore, do
[1:54:40] they?
[1:54:42] Stop. Talk it
[1:54:44] over. Get back with him. Life's a
[1:54:49] battle. You're going to have to live it.
[1:54:53] You're going to have to overcome
[1:54:56] it. I'm almost done. So, all the guys
[1:54:58] can go and get their stuff ready for you
[1:55:02] to
[1:55:03] eat. What did she do? She said, "The
[1:55:07] battle raged when Eve opened up her mind
[1:55:11] to listen to reasoning." That's the flu
[1:55:14] it comes
[1:55:16] in. That's the channel it runs down. her
[1:55:21] reasoning. She in her soul she reasoned.
[1:55:24] The first thing she did was opened up
[1:55:27] her
[1:55:28] mind and when she did, human reasoning
[1:55:31] caught it. Why wouldn't that be a thrill
[1:55:36] and and so you you find out that there's
[1:55:38] there's a this great
[1:55:41] battle. And so your mind's got to be
[1:55:44] set. Your mind's got to know we we Satan
[1:55:48] has tricked us to where we're looking
[1:55:51] out here at
[1:55:53] things. We're seeing the result of
[1:55:56] things and think that Satan does deals
[1:55:59] in the results. He only battles you one
[1:56:03] place right here. How you're thinking,
[1:56:07] he's trying to get you to look at it a
[1:56:09] certain way. He's trying to get you to
[1:56:11] discern it a certain way.
[1:56:16] I know a man he he just he he likes to
[1:56:18] dream dreams and see
[1:56:21] visions, you know, he he he don't like
[1:56:24] the fact that we we just stay with the
[1:56:26] word of God. He wants he wants to insert
[1:56:29] dreams. He wants to insert visions. You
[1:56:31] know, he he wants to say, "I dream that
[1:56:34] and I dream this and I saw this and I
[1:56:36] saw that." It don't matter. I'm not
[1:56:39] saying he didn't see it.
[1:56:42] But if it's not the word of God, I am
[1:56:44] not going to open my mind to it.
[1:56:55] If someone says, "This is the Holy
[1:56:57] Ghost, and that's the Holy Ghost, and if
[1:57:00] you had the Holy Ghost, you would do
[1:57:02] this, you would do that. If I got the
[1:57:04] Holy Ghost, I'm going to do exactly what
[1:57:07] the Holy Ghost wants me to do.
[1:57:11] That's right.
[1:57:14] There's no
[1:57:15] evidence. There's no
[1:57:19] proof. You need that for your mind. I
[1:57:23] don't need it for my
[1:57:25] mind. I know where I was. I know what he
[1:57:29] took me from. I know what he took out of
[1:57:31] me. It's a personal affair. I know he
[1:57:34] loves me.
[1:57:36] Why? I don't know.
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:40] I didn't choose him. He chose me.
[1:57:48] I had nothing to do with it.
[1:57:52] You say, "Why are you there this
[1:57:54] morning?" I I'm guarantee you, you're
[1:57:56] probably all more qualified than I am.
[1:57:59] But he put me here. He'll take me out
[1:58:01] when he's ready.
[1:58:06] You say, "That's awful boastful. If I
[1:58:08] didn't believe that, I'd be a hypocrite.
[1:58:13] There's one thing I do know. I know I
[1:58:15] love you.
[1:58:18] I'm trusting you love me. That's what
[1:58:21] the prophet said makes a good church.
[1:58:24] When the pastor loves the people and the
[1:58:27] people love the pastor, you got a good
[1:58:29] church when they love one another.
[1:58:32] He never said they'll know you by you're
[1:58:34] my disciples by how much dead you raise.
[1:58:39] He said they'll know you are my
[1:58:41] disciples by your love one for
[1:58:46] another. She opened her mind. So what
[1:58:49] does Satan bring? All he's trying to do
[1:58:52] is get in your mind.
[1:58:55] Remember, to get you to think, to get
[1:58:58] you to consider, to get you to
[1:59:01] discern, not to get you to trust. Just
[1:59:04] say, 'Lord, I don't understand
[1:59:06] this. I worked all these years. I was
[1:59:09] faithful. I put in more time than
[1:59:11] anybody, and this happened to
[1:59:14] me. There's no reason for
[1:59:17] it. No
[1:59:19] reason. I don't need to know the reason.
[1:59:21] I know one thing. Nothing can pluck me
[1:59:24] out of the palm of his hand.
[1:59:30] Why am I
[1:59:33] nervous? Are you a
[1:59:36] believer? Nervousness goes with
[1:59:38] it. Anybody who's spiritual is
[1:59:42] nervous. Complexes part of it. Fiery
[1:59:47] darts of the
[1:59:48] enemy. None of that matters.
[1:59:52] We're trying to fix our
[1:59:56] lives. We're trying to fix
[2:00:00] everything. What difference does it
[2:00:04] make? Is it settled in your heart? Do
[2:00:08] you know you have eternal life? Do you
[2:00:10] not have The main thing is to live. I'm
[2:00:12] going to close up real quick. Satan's
[2:00:15] army brings
[2:00:16] disease. That's what Satan is. He's a
[2:00:19] destroyer.
[2:00:22] Go before you think, before you let him
[2:00:25] start talking to you, before you start
[2:00:28] to consider, before you even let him
[2:00:32] say, "Look at your
[2:00:34] life. Look at you. Keep doing the same
[2:00:36] thing. You keep going to the same
[2:00:38] website. You kept doing this. You kept
[2:00:40] doing that. You kept doing that until he
[2:00:43] gets you so looking at yourself, you're
[2:00:45] destroyed."
[2:00:48] You ought to just turn to him and say,
[2:00:49] "That may be true, Satan. But Jesus
[2:00:52] promised me deliverance,
[2:00:56] and I'm praying." That's right. And I'm
[2:00:58] going to ask him to deliver me. That's
[2:01:00] right. I'm going to ask the blood be
[2:01:02] applied to my life. I I I am going to
[2:01:06] overcome because it's given to the
[2:01:09] overcomer.
[2:01:12] So you can pile up all the stuff that
[2:01:14] I've got overcome. It may be a high
[2:01:17] mountain, but I'll tell you something. I
[2:01:19] know somebody who was on top of a
[2:01:21] mountain that I could overcome the
[2:01:23] mountain.
[2:01:26] We give way too much space to the devil.
[2:01:32] And you're never going to fix a mental
[2:01:34] battle with a mental battle.
[2:01:40] You can't use his weapons against him.
[2:01:46] You got to use one thing.
[2:01:49] Your election
[2:01:54] in my father's house. That little boy
[2:01:57] was in the pig pen. He had squandered
[2:02:00] everything he believed, everything he
[2:02:03] lived for
[2:02:04] rout. And finally one day he come to his
[2:02:07] sense. He says, "In my father's house,
[2:02:09] the servants live better than this."
[2:02:13] You know what got him out of that mud
[2:02:15] pit? His election.
[2:02:19] Who he was.
[2:02:22] And when you get tired, Yes, sir. enough
[2:02:25] of the world and you finally say, you
[2:02:29] know something, this is not what I am.
[2:02:35] You say, how did you get saved, brother
[2:02:37] McGary? You know how I got saved? I was
[2:02:40] in a
[2:02:42] house, a drug party in my own house with
[2:02:47] Hell's Angels, with rock
[2:02:50] musicians, with uh movie stars, with
[2:02:55] everybody, famous people, all drinking
[2:02:59] and smoking and and carrying on and men
[2:03:03] with men and women with women, working
[2:03:05] that which was unseemingly. And all of a
[2:03:08] sudden, I sat right there and I looked
[2:03:11] around and it just a room full of
[2:03:14] demons.
[2:03:15] And I stepped back and I shut the door
[2:03:18] and I said one thing. I fell on my
[2:03:20] knees. I said, "God, help me. God, help
[2:03:24] me. I don't know what I am, but I'm not
[2:03:30] this.
[2:03:37] You think I popped up St. Paul?
[2:03:43] Or St.
[2:03:45] Peter? No. I got up and I had to fight.
[2:03:50] I didn't run. I had to fight. Yes, sir.
[2:03:53] I had to live. I had to fight to live.
[2:03:59] But I saw one thing. I saw Satan brings
[2:04:03] disease. Satan's whole kingdom of Satan
[2:04:06] is sickness, death, sorrow, frustration,
[2:04:09] and worry. All of Satan, God is life,
[2:04:12] faith, joy, peace over here. That's the
[2:04:16] two great forces that's coming together
[2:04:18] right now. They're battling. They're
[2:04:21] battling right here in the building
[2:04:22] right now. They're battling day by day
[2:04:25] with
[2:04:27] you. Every force. They're battling day
[2:04:30] by day with you. Every force. You can
[2:04:36] either fight or you can run. You can
[2:04:40] either believe or you can live.
[2:04:44] Satan believes.
[2:04:47] But a Christian lives.
[2:04:58] Satan follows you
[2:05:00] along. That great big kinky priestly
[2:05:03] Goliath trying to scare the liver out of
[2:05:07] you. He follows you around.
[2:05:16] Sorry, my precious brothers.
[2:05:19] Satan's following you.
[2:05:22] He's going to meet you. He's going to
[2:05:25] talk to your mind. He's going to get in
[2:05:28] your head. What are you going to do? Are
[2:05:31] you going to fight
[2:05:35] or are you going to
[2:05:37] run? Are you just going to run till the
[2:05:40] next time?
[2:05:45] The scripture says,
[2:05:46] "Withstand the devil and he will flee."
[2:05:51] It doesn't say
[2:05:53] flee and he'll
[2:05:56] leave. He'll follow you. He'll fight
[2:05:59] you. He'll battle you. He'll question
[2:06:01] you. Do you have the right job? Are you
[2:06:04] doing the right thing? Is this the right
[2:06:10] person? I've been married 54 years,
[2:06:12] right? Can you imagine me waking up?
[2:06:14] Satan say, "You sure you're married the
[2:06:15] right
[2:06:19] one? You think it's funny? He'll do it
[2:06:22] every
[2:06:25] day. Your life's a
[2:06:28] mistake. You're not even supposed to be
[2:06:30] here. You're supposed to be a
[2:06:32] missionary. You're not supposed to be a
[2:06:33] pastor. You're supposed to be an
[2:06:35] evangelist. You're supposed to be this.
[2:06:36] You're supposed to do that." He never
[2:06:37] shuts
[2:06:38] up. You know what would be the greatest
[2:06:41] day in my life? When God takes that big
[2:06:43] spiritual cork and puts it in his mouth
[2:06:46] and throws him into the lake of fire,
[2:06:52] he don't stop so you can't stop.
[2:06:58] He follows you around. He says you
[2:07:03] you're for He says he tries to scare
[2:07:06] living. You're fortified. Amen. with the
[2:07:09] gospel, with the word of truth around
[2:07:11] your loins. Glory, preacher. What is it?
[2:07:14] Helmet of salvation, the shield of
[2:07:16] faith, the sword of waving. It's in your
[2:07:19] hand, Satan. I'm coming to meet
[2:07:26] you. You meet me in the name of science.
[2:07:30] You meet me in the name of culture. You
[2:07:33] meet me in the name of organization. You
[2:07:36] meet me in the name of this, that, or
[2:07:39] the other, but I meet you in the name of
[2:07:42] the Lord God of Israel. I'm coming after
[2:07:45] you. Give way. Even death itself can't
[2:07:49] stand there. Chop a hole right through
[2:07:52] it. That's right.
[2:07:55] Fight.
[2:07:58] Satan's army brings disease, but guard
[2:08:00] armies is commissioned to cast them out.
[2:08:04] There you are. Cast every every time
[2:08:08] Satan throws anything on you unto you,
[2:08:14] God's army is to cast him out. Amen.
[2:08:18] Cast out. That's the very technique that
[2:08:22] God used. Satan, he used the army of
[2:08:26] destru Satan uses the army of
[2:08:28] destruction to disbelieve God's word and
[2:08:32] set him up a better kingdom than Michael
[2:08:35] had. And God cast him out.
[2:08:42] He didn't try to destroy
[2:08:45] him. Jesus always cast them out.
[2:08:51] Cast those thoughts out. Do you trust
[2:08:54] the gospel? Do you trust the message of
[2:08:56] the hour? Is something working on
[2:09:00] you trying to stir up
[2:09:04] doubt? You think I'm ashamed of this
[2:09:10] message? I had the regional
[2:09:16] director of all the assemblies of God in
[2:09:19] western United
[2:09:21] States. When I got done talking to him
[2:09:23] about water baptism, the only thing he
[2:09:26] could say, "Well, I guess there's two
[2:09:28] ways to be
[2:09:29] baptized." I said, "You tell me where
[2:09:32] God ever had two ways of doing anything.
[2:09:37] You can't fight God's word. It's not my
[2:09:40] battle. It's not my word. It's his word.
[2:09:44] He'll do the fighting. It's his promise.
[2:09:47] By the exceedingly great and precious
[2:09:51] promises, we're partakers of divine
[2:09:54] nature.
[2:09:55] We don't have to
[2:09:57] fight. That's right. We've just got to
[2:10:00] live. Amen.
[2:10:02] That's what Satan
[2:10:04] does. Cast them out.
[2:10:07] God's method is casting out the evil.
[2:10:10] Cast down reasoning. Cast down
[2:10:12] superstition. Cast down worry. Cast down
[2:10:16] disease. Cast down sin. Amen. You're
[2:10:20] above it. Resurrected in Christ Jesus.
[2:10:24] Sitting in heavenly places with every
[2:10:26] devil under your foot. If he starts to
[2:10:30] stick his head in
[2:10:32] there, you know you're dead.
[2:10:36] Your life is hid. What is dead? You're
[2:10:39] dead to your senses. You're dead to your
[2:10:42] conscience. Your own human will say,
[2:10:46] "Yes, I guess." Dead to your reasoning.
[2:10:50] Dead to all those things. You are buried
[2:10:53] in the name of Jesus Christ and raised
[2:10:56] with him. And where he is, there you are
[2:11:02] also.
[2:11:07] You
[2:11:09] see, we we get
[2:11:13] away. Battling is a part of
[2:11:16] living. Overcoming is a part of being a
[2:11:20] Christian. It doesn't mean you're not a
[2:11:23] Christian. Life is a constant warfare.
[2:11:26] The spirit wars against the flesh and
[2:11:29] the flesh against the spirit. But
[2:11:32] there's one thing that I could say if
[2:11:34] you would in closing with me, if you
[2:11:38] would read with me in
[2:11:56] Galatians and we've already talked about
[2:11:58] these things. So all the things that
[2:12:01] Satan brings, witchcraft, hatred,
[2:12:04] verence, image, wrath, strife, all those
[2:12:06] things. But this is what he says in
[2:12:08] Galatians 5 and 22. But the fruit of the
[2:12:11] spirit is
[2:12:13] love,
[2:12:15] joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[2:12:20] goodness, and faith, meekness,
[2:12:23] temperance. Against such there is no
[2:12:27] law.
[2:12:28] And they that are Christ have crucified
[2:12:31] the flesh and the affections and lust.
[2:12:35] If we live in the spirit, let us also
[2:12:40] walk in the
[2:12:44] spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain
[2:12:47] glory, provoking one another, envying
[2:12:51] one another. What is to
[2:12:55] live? Another great place to go to if
[2:12:58] you would is second
[2:13:01] Peter. As we read this, as
[2:13:04] we prepare to turn the
[2:13:07] service to
[2:13:13] close. Read with me second Peter.
[2:13:22] And this is from the message statue of a
[2:13:26] perfect
[2:13:27] man. It says, "Simon Peter, a servant
[2:13:31] and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
[2:13:34] that have obtained like precious faith
[2:13:38] with us through the righteousness of God
[2:13:42] and our savior Jesus Christ." Can we say
[2:13:45] that together? We've all obtained like,
[2:13:48] precious faith.
[2:13:51] We all believe this morning. If you're
[2:13:53] not a believer this morning in the Lord
[2:13:55] Jesus, we welcome you to put him to the
[2:14:00] test to read his word and find out if
[2:14:04] he's not a living
[2:14:06] person. Grace and peace be multiplied
[2:14:10] unto you through the knowledge of God
[2:14:14] and of Jesus our Lord. according as his
[2:14:19] divine
[2:14:20] power hath given unto us all things that
[2:14:25] pertain unto life and godliness through
[2:14:29] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[2:14:33] to
[2:14:33] glory and
[2:14:35] virtue. whereby are given unto us
[2:14:39] exceedingly great and precious
[2:14:42] promises, that by these you might be
[2:14:45] partakers of divine nature, having
[2:14:48] escaped the corruption that is in the
[2:14:52] world through
[2:14:54] lust. And besides this, give all
[2:14:59] diligence. Add to your
[2:15:01] faith
[2:15:03] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[2:15:08] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[2:15:12] patience, and to
[2:15:15] patience
[2:15:16] godliness, and to godliness brotherly
[2:15:19] kindness, and to brotherly kindness
[2:15:23] charity. For if these things be in you
[2:15:28] and
[2:15:29] abound, they make you that ye shall
[2:15:32] neither be barren nor
[2:15:35] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[2:15:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:15:42] But he that lackth these things is
[2:15:44] blind, and cannot see a far off, and
[2:15:48] hath
[2:15:49] forgotten that he was purged from his
[2:15:54] old
[2:15:57] sins. Isn't that exactly what James
[2:16:01] says? He's not a doer.
[2:16:04] He perceives himself in a glass or a
[2:16:07] mirror and then goes away and forgot
[2:16:10] what manner of man he
[2:16:13] was. Wherefore, rather, brethren, give
[2:16:17] diligence to make your calling and
[2:16:19] election sure. If you do these things,
[2:16:24] you shall never
[2:16:26] fail. We saw the fruits of the spirit.
[2:16:30] We see the statue of a perfect man.
[2:16:33] These are the things that we live
[2:16:37] by. This is how we handle situations.
[2:16:41] This is how we handle life. We live by
[2:16:44] the fruits of the spirit. We live by the
[2:16:48] virtues of a statue of a perfect man.
[2:16:52] the musicians can come. And I'd like to
[2:16:55] read this in closing and it's paragraph
[2:17:00] 360 of the statue of a perfect
[2:17:07] man. He says
[2:17:10] this. So when you
[2:17:13] surrender your complete
[2:17:16] being, everybody wants to know how do
[2:17:19] you surrender your complete
[2:17:24] being? By
[2:17:26] casting
[2:17:27] everything contrary to the word out. You
[2:17:32] don't go out there and say you're not
[2:17:35] going to sin and you're going to stop
[2:17:38] doing this and you're stopped doing that
[2:17:41] because if he can sew it, it will
[2:17:46] grow. Sin is first conceived in the mind
[2:17:50] and then it drops in to your thinking
[2:17:55] and then you act upon it.
[2:17:59] How do you de bring yourself under
[2:18:02] subjection? Don't worry about your
[2:18:06] flesh. Worry about your
[2:18:09] mind. Get your mind
[2:18:13] clean. The rest will follow. Don't sew
[2:18:16] it. Don't look at it. Don't read it.
[2:18:20] Don't talk about
[2:18:22] it. You
[2:18:24] automatically will come into s
[2:18:28] subjection.
[2:18:31] You don't let them plan it,
[2:18:36] then run away from it. You fight
[2:18:40] it right there.
[2:18:43] You fight it. You fight it in your mind.
[2:18:46] You fight the thought. You fight it
[2:18:49] right there. You fight it in seed form.
[2:18:51] You pluck it out right
[2:18:54] there. If you do the battle
[2:18:59] there, everything else will fall in
[2:19:01] place
[2:19:03] perfectly. You say, "Boy, this ain't
[2:19:05] very deep. This is deeper than you'd
[2:19:07] ever
[2:19:09] imagine." When you surrender your
[2:19:12] complete being, then the Holy Spirit
[2:19:16] just pours through you in these virtues.
[2:19:23] Then you're
[2:19:27] living. How does the Holy Spirit come
[2:19:30] in? Everybody's got it in gifts and in
[2:19:34] power and demonstration. You know where
[2:19:36] all those powers and demonstrations
[2:19:39] start? With the Holy Spirit putting
[2:19:42] these
[2:19:43] virtues, flowing through you in these
[2:19:48] virtues.
[2:19:50] And then you have the right heart to
[2:19:52] pray for the sick. You have the
[2:19:55] compassion to lead the soul to Christ.
[2:19:59] You're not doing it for a demonstration.
[2:20:02] You're doing it because the love of God
[2:20:04] is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy
[2:20:07] Ghost. It's a then people look out and
[2:20:12] say that it's a man full of virtue,
[2:20:17] knowledge, that believes the word,
[2:20:20] temperance, patience, godliness,
[2:20:23] brotherly kindness, full of the love of
[2:20:26] the Holy Ghost. See, there he is walking
[2:20:31] around. What is it? a
[2:20:34] statue that unbelievers can look at and
[2:20:37] say, "There's a Christian. There's a man
[2:20:41] or a woman who knows what they're
[2:20:44] talking about." You never see a kinder,
[2:20:49] sweeter, godlier person. You're
[2:20:53] sealed. The seal shows on both
[2:20:57] sides whether you're going or coming.
[2:21:01] You see the seals just the same. There
[2:21:05] you are. When a man or a woman possesses
[2:21:09] this, then the capstone comes down and
[2:21:12] seals them into the kingdom of God,
[2:21:15] which is the Holy
[2:21:19] Ghost. Then the words coming from
[2:21:22] here manifest itself through each one of
[2:21:26] these beings. See, and makes this a
[2:21:30] complete being, a tabernacle of the
[2:21:33] living God, a walking living example of
[2:21:40] Christianity. What Christ
[2:21:43] was, these people
[2:21:46] are because his life is in
[2:21:51] here. There they are in
[2:21:55] Christ and their life is dead and hid in
[2:21:59] Christ through God and sealed in there
[2:22:04] by the Holy Ghost. 1 Corinthians 12.
[2:22:07] That's right. You reckon yourself dead.
[2:22:11] Then you're born of faith. Then virtue
[2:22:14] and these other things is added to you
[2:22:18] till you're a perfect living image of
[2:22:21] God. That's wonderful. You say, "Is that
[2:22:26] possible?" He spoke
[2:22:28] it. I believe
[2:22:31] it. That settles
[2:22:34] it. You can live this,
[2:22:39] church. Block out the
[2:22:42] negative. Never, never, never have a
[2:22:46] negative thought.
[2:22:48] If there's things in your life you don't
[2:22:50] want to be
[2:22:52] there, Lord, I don't want it there. Help
[2:22:56] me. Help me
[2:22:59] overcome. Jesus looked at that man and
[2:23:01] says, "Does thou believe?" He said,
[2:23:03] "Lord, help my
[2:23:07] unbelief. Help my battle, Lord. Help me
[2:23:11] get my thinking
[2:23:12] right." And you watch.
[2:23:16] He didn't call you to lose
[2:23:19] you. All that the father hath given me
[2:23:22] will
[2:23:23] come. And if he started the work in you,
[2:23:27] he'll finish it all the way to the
[2:23:31] end. As we said Wednesday
[2:23:36] night, when you buy something, you get
[2:23:39] what you pay for,
[2:23:41] right? Well, Jesus paid.
[2:23:44] He paid a price and he's going to get
[2:23:48] what he paid for. He's going to get a
[2:23:50] bride without spot or without
[2:23:53] wrinkle. And he'll wash her. He'll add
[2:23:57] to her. He'll build her. And he'll keep
[2:24:01] her until the day that he takes her
[2:24:04] home.
[2:24:07] You have to decide this morning
[2:24:10] what side of the
[2:24:13] battle do you want to be
[2:24:16] on? I want to serve God. I want to serve
[2:24:20] him better. I want to
[2:24:22] overcome. How do you overcome? You
[2:24:25] fight. I'm not going to run. I'm not
[2:24:29] just going to believe. I'm going to live
[2:24:32] and I'm going to fight. I'm going to
[2:24:34] live by Galatians 5:21. I'm going to
[2:24:37] live by First Peter. My decisions are
[2:24:40] going to be to have those virtues and
[2:24:42] live by those virtues. And I promise by
[2:24:45] the grace of God, I'll be an overcomer.
[2:24:48] You love them. God bless you. Let's
[2:24:52] [Applause]
[2:24:57] stand. What's those
[2:24:59] [Music]
[2:25:00] words? Amen.
[2:25:04] I like this. There is a source in times
[2:25:06] of need. There is a
[2:25:10] source in the time of
[2:25:15] need that gives me
[2:25:19] hope. That brings me peace.
[2:25:29] Every
[2:25:31] day my savior
[2:25:36] stands
[2:25:41] I

[2:26:09] courage. The battle is the Lord.
[2:26:14] When the waters
[2:26:16] [Music]

[2:26:22] name and gives
[2:26:26] me
[2:26:30] I'll be hold my
[2:26:34] [Music]

[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:07] is gone.
[2:27:13] The battle
[2:27:15] is the battle.
[2:27:19] Sing that second verse. Oh, and when the
[2:27:22] water is
[2:27:23] dry, oh, he calls my name.
[2:27:29] Oh
[2:27:33] me on the
[2:27:36] way.
[2:27:37] Oh my
[2:27:40] hand.
[2:27:41] Oh I should
[2:27:44] falter. Oh it makes me
[2:27:49] stand out on the
[2:27:52] water. Oh the Lord you are.
[2:27:58] Oh, leave you tight and
[2:28:01] bold. All your strength is
[2:28:06] gone. And your heart feels
[2:28:11] so
[2:28:13] God. It's greater than the
[2:28:16] [Music]

[2:35:26] just want to have it for the flesh.
[2:35:30] But the spiritual food that we have
[2:35:32] already have, Father, I pray that we may
[2:35:34] go with
[2:35:36] it. Everywhere we will go, Father, that
[2:35:38] we may
[2:35:40] manifest the life of your son, Lord
[2:35:43] Jesus. That's our desire as we still
[2:35:47] here everywhere. Father, we have come
[2:35:50] short. We pray that you may forgive us.
[2:35:54] May the blood just cover each one of us,
[2:35:56] Father. We love you and we commit our
