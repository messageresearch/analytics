[33:37] corinthians chapter three
[33:40] i want to take this opportunity to
[33:43] welcome my father and mother-in-law
[33:45] brother sal and sister margaret
[33:48] so good to have them
[33:50] with us
[33:52] this time they came they brought up they
[33:53] brought a motor home and a car outside
[33:56] so they might be here a while so
[33:58] that'd be all right with us though we're
[34:00] so glad to have you
[34:02] and uh just remember our pastor and
[34:04] sister leslie is there in
[34:06] california
[34:08] with my grandma we know that she's
[34:10] 99 i believe now that when when you get
[34:13] to 99 you start counting the quarter
[34:15] years and the half years my grandma's 99
[34:17] and a half
[34:18] and so we're just so so thankful for the
[34:20] long life that god has given her so just
[34:22] remember them as their way i'm getting a
[34:24] little ring up here brothers if if we
[34:26] can bring down the monitors just to
[34:27] touch
[34:29] second corinthians chapter three
[34:31] we'll read verse three
[34:33] after six
[34:35] second corinthians chapter three says
[34:37] for as
[34:38] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[34:41] the epistles of christ ministered by us
[34:44] written not with ink but with the spirit
[34:47] of the living god
[34:49] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[34:51] tables of the heart
[34:54] and such trust have we through christ to
[34:56] godward
[34:58] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[35:00] to think anything as of ourselves
[35:03] but our sufficiency
[35:05] is of god
[35:07] who also hath made us able ministers
[35:10] of the new testament
[35:12] not of the letter
[35:14] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[35:17] but the spirit
[35:18] giveth life amen you may have your seats
[35:22] i just want to pull from this
[35:25] reading of the scripture a thought
[35:28] this evening the revelation
[35:30] of the new covenant
[35:32] and here in verse 6 you find he says who
[35:34] hath also made us able ministers
[35:38] of the new testament not of the letter
[35:40] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[35:43] but the spirit giveth life and as a
[35:45] subject i've been thinking along the
[35:46] lines of able ministers
[35:49] let's just also read out of hebrews
[35:51] chapter 10 verse 16.
[35:56] i know there's more than three or four
[35:57] bibles in the church
[36:00] feel free to turn
[36:03] put your sword to good use
[36:10] hebrews chapter 10
[36:12] verse 16 it says
[36:14] this is the covenant that i will make
[36:16] with them after those days
[36:19] saith the lord
[36:20] i will put my laws in their hearts
[36:24] and in their minds will i write them
[36:28] and their sins and iniquities will i
[36:30] remember no more
[36:32] my i think we could just stop down right
[36:34] there for a little bit
[36:36] maybe
[36:37] think of the simplicity of the gospel
[36:39] but here the word is saying that that
[36:42] i'm going to make a covenant with you
[36:44] and it says the lord says that i will
[36:46] put my laws into your hearts this is
[36:48] something that he's going to do this
[36:50] isn't something you're going to do by
[36:52] how much you can study and how much you
[36:54] can learn and so how much you can listen
[36:56] and how much you can apply yourself but
[36:58] this is a covenant and this is something
[37:00] that god said that he is going to do he
[37:04] said santa learn i will put my laws into
[37:06] their hearts and in their minds will i
[37:08] write them and their sins and iniquities
[37:11] will i remember no more well i don't
[37:13] know about you that makes me happy when
[37:16] i hear god say look i'm not going to
[37:17] remember your sin and your iniquity
[37:20] anymore i don't know about you but i got
[37:22] a lot of sin and iniquities if you knew
[37:24] the place where i had come from if you
[37:26] knew all the things that i'd done before
[37:27] i met the lord but i want to tell you
[37:29] since i've met the lord i don't know
[37:31] about you but i've had a lot of sin and
[37:33] iniquity in my life even since i've been
[37:35] converted so when i look into the word
[37:38] where where the devil would try to
[37:39] condemn you and your own mind we're
[37:41] trying to condemn you oh and you can
[37:42] look into the word and you can see where
[37:45] it says in their sins and their iniquity
[37:47] will i remember no more i say what a
[37:49] covenant tonight what what a covenant
[37:51] god has made with his people that if
[37:53] you'll just plead the blood of jesus
[37:54] christ i will make a covenant with you i
[37:57] will put my words in your heart i will
[37:59] write them upon the table of your heart
[38:01] and your sin and your iniquity i will
[38:04] remember no more well we got something
[38:06] to be thankful about tonight if there
[38:07] was never another word set tonight maybe
[38:10] ought to just let that start to swirl
[38:11] around in your hearts a little bit
[38:14] that the king of glory
[38:16] the only one that could condemn you
[38:19] the only one that could take the letter
[38:21] of the word and say you're guilty
[38:23] but he took that letter of the word upon
[38:25] himself he said i'm going to make a new
[38:27] covenant with you
[38:29] and your sins and your iniquity i will
[38:31] remember no more
[38:33] oh hallelujah
[38:35] in verse 18 it says now where remissions
[38:37] of these
[38:38] is
[38:40] there is no more offering of sin having
[38:42] therefore brethren boldness
[38:47] to enter into the holiest
[38:49] by the blood
[38:50] of jesus
[38:52] oh can somebody say by the blood of
[38:54] jesus
[38:55] when i see the blood
[38:57] come on we know we know in the old
[38:58] testament the death angel was going to
[39:01] come
[39:02] but god had sent a message with a
[39:03] prophet he said look there's only one
[39:05] way
[39:06] that you're going to escape the death
[39:07] angel there's only one way that you're
[39:09] going to escape judgment that's you got
[39:11] to take the blood of the lamb you've got
[39:13] to strike the the blood on the doorpost
[39:16] and when i see the blood i will pass
[39:18] over you i wonder if you've applied the
[39:20] blood tonight is there a people that
[39:22] have applied the blood of jesus christ
[39:24] to your life
[39:26] then i can say when judgment is passing
[39:28] over look we're living in a world that's
[39:30] just right for judgment all these
[39:32] plagues and all this sickness and
[39:34] everything that you're going on what is
[39:35] it it's judgment judgment has struck the
[39:38] world judgment has struck the land but
[39:40] there's a people by the grace of god and
[39:43] the covenant that he has given to him
[39:45] that have applied the blood of jesus
[39:47] christ and when that judgment comes oh
[39:49] you could just say just pass over my
[39:51] house because the blood of jesus christ
[39:53] has applied i've taken the blood of the
[39:56] sacrifice of the lamb of god it's been
[39:58] applied and your sin and your iniquity i
[40:01] will remember no more
[40:03] oh thank you jesus for the blood
[40:06] thank you for the blood thank you god
[40:07] for the blood that you shed thank you
[40:10] god for an everlasting covenant
[40:15] oh my
[40:16] when i see the blood
[40:18] what did jesus say he said if i be
[40:20] lifted up
[40:22] i will draw all men unto me i was
[40:25] dwelling on that a little bit he says if
[40:26] i be lifted up i will draw all men unto
[40:29] me i want to say it like this if i be
[40:31] lifted up
[40:33] i'm going to draw you unto me if i be
[40:35] lifted up or i'm coming after you
[40:38] look he had you in his mind
[40:41] don't think that that calvary was some
[40:43] just random sacrifice
[40:45] that god veiled himself come down and
[40:47] took on sinful flesh created himself a
[40:50] body and became you to take our place
[40:52] and went to calvary and laid his life
[40:54] there and goes well i wonder who will
[40:55] believe on me
[40:57] i just wonder i wonder if there's going
[40:59] to be a people out there that that can
[41:01] actually catch what i've done that that
[41:03] was the great creator the great elohim
[41:06] the self-existing one and i condescended
[41:09] down and took on the form of man that i
[41:10] might have fellowship that i might take
[41:12] their sin and iniquities upon my
[41:14] shoulders that i would bear it to
[41:16] calvary and that i'd pay the price for
[41:18] your sin and oh would there be a people
[41:22] that would recognize that would there no
[41:24] the god knew who it was dying for
[41:27] he said if i'd be lifted up or i'm going
[41:30] to go draw you to me jackson where were
[41:32] you was it something you did but he said
[41:33] no if i be lifted up i'm going to draw
[41:36] jackson to me if i'll be lifted up i'm
[41:38] going to draw you to me brother if i'll
[41:40] be lifted up i'm going to draw darrian
[41:42] to me why because he had you on his mind
[41:44] when he went to calvary it wasn't by
[41:47] chance that there would be a people that
[41:48] would believe on him but he went to
[41:50] calvary for his pride
[41:54] oh this new covenant
[41:56] it wasn't it wasn't just for some people
[41:58] at random
[42:01] but he had you on his mind
[42:03] he was thinking about you oh if i be
[42:06] lifted up
[42:08] you know they took our lord
[42:12] they lifted him up on a roman cross
[42:16] oh there they
[42:18] tortured him and they beat him and they
[42:20] ran a spear into his side
[42:23] as i thought about that here here the
[42:25] the he came to his own and his own
[42:27] received him not
[42:30] and they lifted him up there on that on
[42:32] that cross and on calvary there he he
[42:35] died the most brutal death and i thought
[42:37] my if i be lifted up and something in my
[42:40] heart started to stir within me i
[42:42] thought my they might have raised you up
[42:44] there lord on a roman cross but oh god
[42:47] let me lift you up tonight lord let me
[42:50] let me lift you up with my life let me
[42:52] lift you up with my praise lord let me
[42:54] lift you up and give you the place that
[42:56] you deserve may i surrender my life to
[42:58] you may i surrender my all to you lord i
[43:01] want to lift you up i want to praise you
[43:03] i want to worship you i want to bring
[43:05] you glory lord let you be high and
[43:08] lifted up oh god
[43:10] oh god because he draw me unto him let
[43:12] me give him glory let me give him praise
[43:15] hallelujah let me worship him in spirit
[43:18] and in truth
[43:19] oh the father seek as such to worship
[43:22] him
[43:23] he's seeking such worship in those that
[43:25] will worship him in spirit and truth
[43:30] well there's only one group of people
[43:32] that can do that don't get quiet on me
[43:35] you might have heard it over and over
[43:36] but you know there's only one group of
[43:38] people that can worship him in spirit
[43:39] and in truth oh sure there's a lot of
[43:41] people out there that can get in the
[43:43] spirit they can run they can jump they
[43:45] can shout they can even have signs and
[43:47] wonders moving them but when they reject
[43:49] to the word they're void of truth
[43:52] god sent a message in this hour to
[43:53] restore truth this is a message of
[43:56] restoration and when god came down by
[43:58] divine promise and veiled himself and
[44:00] the prophet of the age the son of man
[44:02] ministry and brought truth they rejected
[44:05] it
[44:07] just like jesus coming to his own in his
[44:10] own received lot they rejected it
[44:13] but oh there's a little class of people
[44:15] uh a little a little persecuted group
[44:19] uh they're not accepted by the big
[44:21] religions they're not accepted by the
[44:22] big denominational systems out there
[44:25] because when the word came from when
[44:26] everybody else turned them down when
[44:28] everybody else rejected them there was a
[44:30] people that the word was written upon
[44:33] their heart that when that word started
[44:35] to go forth it was talking to you it was
[44:38] speaking to a seed you couldn't explain
[44:40] it you couldn't understand it but when
[44:42] everybody else was walking away from the
[44:44] message when everybody else thought you
[44:45] were crazy when everybody else thought
[44:47] you were a lunatic something inside of
[44:49] you said that's me i can identify with
[44:52] it it's calling me names my name i'll
[44:54] walk away from everything else and i'll
[44:56] follow this word
[44:59] why because that word has been written
[45:01] upon your heart
[45:04] not something that you did
[45:05] but it was something that god did
[45:09] verse 20 says by a new and living way
[45:12] which he has consecrated for us
[45:15] through the veil that is to say his
[45:18] flesh
[45:20] and having a high priest over the house
[45:21] of god
[45:23] the prophet would say in the token
[45:26] testament means covenant
[45:29] the new testament
[45:30] means the new covenant the old testament
[45:34] was the old
[45:36] under the lamb
[45:37] that the life could not come back on the
[45:39] believer
[45:41] the new testament was the lamb of god
[45:42] and his life comes back on us
[45:45] oh thank god
[45:47] blood's life see blood is life in the
[45:50] new testament see
[45:52] life is from the blood of the lamb which
[45:54] means the new testament new covenant
[45:57] that god after those days will i write
[45:59] my laws upon the fleshly tables of their
[46:01] hearts see not upon the stony tables
[46:05] and a lamb's blood
[46:07] which you had to say yeah i'll make with
[46:09] the people and uh uh
[46:11] yeah
[46:13] i got blood over here now what does it
[46:15] say do
[46:16] but upon the tables of your heart see
[46:19] the spirit covenant
[46:21] will i make with the people
[46:23] and it displays his power
[46:27] this new covenant
[46:29] i'm going to write this upon your heart
[46:33] the spirit covenant will i make with
[46:34] this people
[46:36] and it displays
[46:37] his power
[46:39] john 14 12 says that he that believeth
[46:41] on me the works that i do shall he do
[46:44] also and it displays his power i want to
[46:47] tell you there's a power here tonight
[46:50] there is a power in the house of god
[46:52] tonight look there is a new covenant
[46:54] that god has made with his people i
[46:56] wonder if we'll just surrender to it
[46:58] tonight i wonder if we'll just start to
[47:00] understand and start to recognize and
[47:01] say oh god may you just break open your
[47:04] word to me may i catch a greater
[47:05] revelation of what this new covenant is
[47:08] why because there is a power tonight
[47:10] that has been released upon the people
[47:12] then i ask you what do we have need of
[47:14] tonight what is on your heart what is
[47:16] your question
[47:18] there's been a blood covenant made for
[47:19] you
[47:21] look we're not under we're not under the
[47:23] old testament and
[47:25] and rules and regulations and oh i got
[47:28] to do this i got to do this
[47:30] every month or the the priest i got to
[47:32] bring a lamb to the priest and he's
[47:33] going to he's going to slay the lamb and
[47:35] then whenever i do this you know
[47:37] whenever i see it every year i'm gonna
[47:38] have to come in i'm have to make no this
[47:40] lamb jesus christ was slain once and for
[47:43] all for you
[47:45] and it's a new covenant
[47:47] that i'll put my word in your heart and
[47:49] there comes with that that new covenant
[47:51] of power
[47:52] the same works that i did shall you do
[47:54] also
[47:56] now where are we looking for that to be
[47:57] manifested
[47:59] how many are looking for that to be
[48:00] manifested here tonight
[48:04] let's have a let's have an expectation
[48:07] for this new covenant for a revelation
[48:09] of what's god's done
[48:12] look
[48:14] yesterday's gone
[48:17] tomorrow is not guaranteed
[48:20] but you know what we have
[48:22] we got right now
[48:24] we got tonight
[48:26] so i i say it behooves us
[48:28] to take advantage of it
[48:31] maybe
[48:32] maybe your revelation is much further
[48:34] down the road and i commend you for that
[48:36] uh maybe your understanding of the
[48:38] message you have such a a greater depth
[48:40] than i do and i commend you for that but
[48:42] i wonder if we can just humble ourselves
[48:45] in the presence of god tonight and lay
[48:47] down all of our understanding lay down
[48:49] everything that we feel that we've
[48:51] acquired and start to recognize that
[48:53] we're in the presence of the king
[48:55] jesus christ has come and there is a
[48:58] power here tonight in this building that
[49:01] whatever you have need of whatever you
[49:02] would ask for you can have it in the
[49:04] name of jesus christ
[49:07] oh glory to god
[49:10] i want to say you you get out of it what
[49:12] you put into it
[49:17] i was driving down the road today and i
[49:19] i saw this old gentleman and my he must
[49:21] have been like 95 or something
[49:24] and i looked at him
[49:26] and you could tell he was
[49:29] jogging but he wasn't going anywhere
[49:33] he wasn't going anywhere i thought you
[49:35] know it seems like he's hardly doing
[49:37] anything
[49:39] and it struck me i love how god takes
[49:41] the simple things
[49:42] and he said yeah i felt that man had to
[49:46] overcome so much more
[49:47] than everybody else that's running down
[49:49] the street today
[49:51] everybody else might have their youth
[49:52] and they might have their strength but
[49:54] that man despite all the odds it took
[49:57] everything that was within him to roll
[49:58] out of the bed it took everything that
[50:00] was in him to stand up it took
[50:02] everything that was in him you know i'm
[50:03] going to go out there and run today even
[50:06] though it might take me two hours to get
[50:08] out of the house even though it might
[50:09] take me 30 minutes to get down the
[50:11] stairs even though it might take me so
[50:13] much time but i'm going to put some
[50:15] effort into it i'm going to do something
[50:17] because i know it's going to be a
[50:19] benefit to me or if that can be in the
[50:21] natural how much more for our people
[50:23] though you might have to overcome a lot
[50:25] though you might have a lot of struggles
[50:27] though i don't know how much you went
[50:28] through today but oh you might have felt
[50:30] like you couldn't overcome the obstacles
[50:32] but something inside you was driving you
[50:34] that you would come to the house of god
[50:36] oh you might not we
[50:38] i might have had it much easier i have a
[50:40] small drive to come to church maybe i'd
[50:42] overcome so many obstacles but i want to
[50:44] tell you god will bless you for your
[50:46] effort
[50:49] oh and what you put into it's what
[50:50] you're going to get out of it
[50:52] it might not look like much but god sees
[50:54] it
[50:57] you might have showed up and you just
[50:58] feel like you can hardly raise a hand
[51:00] well god bless you for being here
[51:02] i don't know what you've been through i
[51:04] don't know what you've gone through but
[51:05] you're here tonight and when i say if
[51:07] you hear god has something for you
[51:10] there's a power here come on there's a
[51:12] power to be released upon the church
[51:14] that can change you
[51:16] that can deliver you
[51:19] oh we're not here just to play church
[51:23] we're not under the old covenant we're
[51:25] not under the old testament this isn't
[51:26] rules and regulation here
[51:29] but
[51:30] everybody pretty much volunteered to
[51:32] come here tonight
[51:33] except for a lot of the children you
[51:35] didn't have a choice
[51:37] but i commend some of our children if
[51:39] their parents weren't going i bet they
[51:40] had a desire to be here
[51:43] we should encourage that in our children
[51:47] oh i say god raise up young children
[51:48] that are 11 12 13 years old maybe even
[51:52] younger when the parents say you know
[51:53] what i'm going to stay at home tonight
[51:54] maybe say mom can so and so pick me up
[51:57] i want to go be in the house of god i
[51:59] want to go be in the presence of the
[52:01] king i want to go sing to my lord i want
[52:03] to go worship the lord i don't want to
[52:05] forsake the assembly of the saints
[52:07] together let me be obedient to that word
[52:09] because there's been a word that's been
[52:11] written upon my heart and i can't help
[52:13] it there's something inside of me
[52:14] driving me to manifest the word
[52:17] oh that ought to be the approach
[52:19] that ought to be the desire
[52:23] i want to ask you what do you
[52:25] what do you want out of it
[52:28] what have you come here for tonight
[52:32] what type of expectations do we have
[52:35] oh yeah these things are familiar
[52:37] but when you come into the presence of
[52:38] the lord jesus christ
[52:42] i believe it begs the question you know
[52:44] what lord maybe i thought i had it all
[52:47] figured out
[52:48] maybe i've heard i've heard this so so
[52:51] much and so often i've come to so many
[52:53] churches that it's just become religion
[52:54] to me now
[52:57] and sometimes a good a good sobering
[52:59] checkup
[53:01] say you know i've been so busy i've just
[53:04] been so busy with life that i've i've
[53:06] come to the house of god and here i am
[53:07] i'm sitting here and i had no
[53:09] expectations at all i just just came
[53:11] here because of my post of duty but oh
[53:13] if maybe we can start now in our hearts
[53:15] if something can start to well up inside
[53:17] us we can start to think about the
[53:19] things that we need say lord if there's
[53:20] any if there's any sin inside of me if
[53:23] there's any unbelief inside of me lord
[53:25] just start dealing with my heart start
[53:26] speaking to me lord reveal yourself to
[53:28] me reveal your person to me lord i want
[53:30] to be right lord i don't want to be
[53:32] wrong if there's higher heights and
[53:33] deeper deaths which lord i know there is
[53:35] may your word just open up to me may the
[53:38] power of god just be poured out upon the
[53:40] congregation tonight lord may we see
[53:42] your holy spirit move in action
[53:46] i believe with that type of expectation
[53:48] expectation
[53:50] we can receive something from the lord
[53:53] what do you desire
[53:56] look jesus said ask
[53:58] and you shall receive
[54:00] ask that your joy might be full
[54:04] ask look he's telling you right here in
[54:06] his word ask and you shall receive that
[54:08] your joy might be full look you you have
[54:10] not because you ask not and when you ask
[54:12] you don't believe but oh we know that
[54:14] faith come by hearing the word i pray as
[54:17] the word is going forth that a faith is
[54:19] rising up inside of you to go ask for it
[54:24] you know the prophet of god said ask for
[54:26] big things

[54:32] you know my heart's been moved and i
[54:34] want to say i'm rejoicing with the
[54:35] testimony that
[54:37] of sister heidi and how that she come
[54:39] through the the surgery process and she
[54:41] she's doing good and i want to say i saw

[56:14] word
[56:16] we heard it sunday
[56:18] brother jeremy did a wonderful job this
[56:19] this ain't a challenge to you
[56:23] this ain't a challenge to whether you
[56:24] can do it
[56:26] this is a child will you take god at his
[56:28] word
[56:31] if you take god at his word then the
[56:32] challenge is not to you it's to him
[56:36] and god will back it up
[56:38] he'll back it up every time
[56:41] ask for big things
[56:43] prophet of god would say in the presence
[56:45] of god unrecognized
[56:48] he said if we could only do that tonight
[56:49] people
[56:51] if we could only realize
[56:54] that he is appearing to us in these
[56:57] meetings for one purpose
[57:00] that is to release our desires
[57:03] that we have in him to us
[57:07] now i i don't this was 1964
[57:10] june 18th
[57:12] is is that the only place where this
[57:14] this word is relevant
[57:16] oh brother matthew that was just the
[57:18] prophet you know he was appearing in the
[57:19] sign of the son of man to the prophet
[57:20] and that that's just a dead letter now
[57:22] the days of the apostles are over
[57:25] we that that gift's not in the church
[57:27] anymore
[57:28] oh no no i want to read that again
[57:30] because he's the same yesterday today
[57:33] and forever and if we could only do that
[57:36] tonight people if we could only realize
[57:39] that he is appearing to us in these
[57:41] meetings for one purpose that's to
[57:44] release our desires that we have in him
[57:46] to us
[57:49] oh glory to god i pray faith is rising
[57:51] up in somebody now that god is appearing
[57:54] to you tonight
[57:58] hey i'm so glad i'm not standing upon my
[58:01] own word
[58:02] i'm glad i'm not up here by the words of
[58:04] a man i'm glad i don't have to stand up
[58:06] here on a maybe or an if or a probably
[58:09] or it could happen or just by chance we
[58:12] might win the lottery but i'm standing
[58:14] upon thus saith the lord heavens and
[58:17] earth will pass away but my word will
[58:19] never pass away jesus is appearing to
[58:22] you tonight that your desires in him
[58:25] might be released to you i'm telling you
[58:27] ask for big things
[58:31] oh glory to god
[58:33] hallelujah
[58:34] but we've got to recognize his presence
[58:39] and now how you recognize his presence
[58:42] is when the promised word for this age
[58:44] is made manifest
[58:46] not the promise
[58:47] not the promised word of moses age
[58:50] or any other ages
[58:52] the promised word for this age i want to
[58:55] say that revelation is a reality
[58:58] revelation is a reality
[59:02] if i can say it like this it becomes
[59:03] part of you
[59:05] it's part of your identification
[59:07] you become a part of christ
[59:11] you know many times you might not have
[59:13] it all figured out or you might
[59:14] understand it but i was thinking along
[59:16] those lines of that boy who who had
[59:18] never seen a mirror before
[59:21] and he come up into the house there he
[59:22] come into the in a room
[59:24] never seen a mirror before
[59:26] and he kind of looked in the mirror and
[59:28] he waved and the little boy in the
[59:30] mirror waved back to him he went to the
[59:32] left the boy with the way he went to the
[59:33] right and everything that little boy did
[59:36] it imitated him and he came up
[59:39] and finally he got close to that mirror
[59:41] and he caught the revelation he said
[59:43] mama why that's me
[59:46] oh that's exactly what's happened to you
[59:49] that's exactly exactly what the lease or
[59:51] call has done that's exactly what the
[59:53] message has done that's exactly what the
[59:55] seventh angel message has done you are
[59:57] hearing that word go forth and it
[59:59] sounded familiar you're like is that me
[1:00:01] in there
[1:00:02] there's something that's kind of
[1:00:03] familiar and you kind of dodged back and
[1:00:05] forth you kept on wondering and you got
[1:00:07] a little closer and oh as that word
[1:00:09] opened up as it became a revelation you
[1:00:11] said oh my oh god thank you so much
[1:00:15] that's me in there
[1:00:17] that's my identification that's who i am
[1:00:21] oh i'm so thankful
[1:00:23] other people
[1:00:25] they can't see themselves in it
[1:00:29] i mean have you ever been trying to show
[1:00:30] something maybe maybe
[1:00:32] i don't know just they have them
[1:00:34] pictures you know where they it's all
[1:00:36] kind of blurred and everything you don't
[1:00:38] even know what's in it
[1:00:39] but if you can look at it just right all
[1:00:41] of a sudden you look at him like oh my
[1:00:42] goodness
[1:00:44] can you see the mountains and can you
[1:00:45] see the landscape and can you see the
[1:00:46] stream coming through like
[1:00:49] what are you talking about
[1:00:51] all i see is a bunch of white noise
[1:00:54] all i see is a bunch of i don't it
[1:00:55] doesn't make any sense to me it seems
[1:00:57] all confusion and you there's this
[1:00:59] beautiful picture is unfolding to you
[1:01:01] that's the same thing with the word of
[1:01:02] god
[1:01:04] you sit down and you try to walk people
[1:01:06] through it and you try to show them you
[1:01:07] try to say look this is the truth of the
[1:01:09] hour this is what's written in the bible
[1:01:11] and through their denominational way of
[1:01:12] thinking because they've heard it over
[1:01:14] and over their whole lives and their
[1:01:16] priests and their ministers get up there
[1:01:18] stand up and over and over from creeds
[1:01:20] and
[1:01:20] and traditions and false dogmas and the
[1:01:23] only thing they can see is the ways of
[1:01:25] man
[1:01:28] oh but thank god there's a people
[1:01:31] he said i'm going to put my word in
[1:01:32] there
[1:01:34] i'm going to put my seed in
[1:01:36] there the way my word flashes upon their
[1:01:39] heart
[1:01:40] something is gonna say mama
[1:01:43] that's me
[1:01:45] jesus would say
[1:01:47] to peter he would say look flesh and
[1:01:49] blood have not revealed this to you but
[1:01:52] my father which is in heaven have
[1:01:53] revealed this to you
[1:01:55] and upon this rock
[1:01:57] i will build my church i just want to
[1:01:59] say we cannot over emphasize revelation
[1:02:02] uh revelation is what we must have
[1:02:05] because he said that the gates of hell
[1:02:07] shall not prevail over this revelation
[1:02:10] what is the
[1:02:11] revelation is who he is
[1:02:14] and that's what was stripped away from
[1:02:16] the church with the godhead and the
[1:02:18] revelation of the word he's not three
[1:02:23] the holy the holy ghost isn't just
[1:02:25] treading there somewhere we we got a god
[1:02:27] the father up there and then a man jesus
[1:02:29] christ we don't know who to pray for
[1:02:32] no but but but he's been veiled through
[1:02:34] the traditions of man and god has sent a
[1:02:37] message to break those denominational
[1:02:39] vows that you might see him for who he
[1:02:41] is
[1:02:43] and it's upon this revelation
[1:02:46] the lord jesus christ
[1:02:49] that peter with those keys amen and
[1:02:52] brother what must we do to be saved
[1:02:53] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:02:56] the lord jesus christ for there's no
[1:02:57] other name under heaven given where
[1:02:59] which man might be saved but by the name
[1:03:01] of jesus christ everything that you do
[1:03:03] in word or deed do all in the name of
[1:03:06] jesus christ oh it's just over and over
[1:03:08] right there in the word and god has sent
[1:03:10] a message that would strike your heart
[1:03:12] that way and if you're that seed oh if
[1:03:14] there's something inside of you you'll
[1:03:16] say that sounds right to me
[1:03:19] oh glory to god the church is built upon
[1:03:22] that revelation and the gates of hell
[1:03:24] shall never prevail against it look
[1:03:26] there has to become a revealing
[1:03:29] young people there has to come a
[1:03:30] revelation
[1:03:33] it's good to be raised in a good church
[1:03:35] it's good to go to the camps it's good
[1:03:37] to have experiences
[1:03:39] it's good to do these things and to be a
[1:03:41] part of the youth group there has to
[1:03:43] come a revealing or an unveiling of god
[1:03:47] to you personally
[1:03:49] because i want to ask you if nobody
[1:03:51] showed up to this church on sunday what
[1:03:52] would you do
[1:03:54] if nobody else showed up what would you
[1:03:56] do or if everybody walked away from the
[1:03:59] message what would you do
[1:04:01] oh i wonder how many really have a
[1:04:04] revelation of the word
[1:04:08] if our pastor got up and god forbid
[1:04:11] renounce the message and started
[1:04:13] preaching another gospel what would you
[1:04:15] do oh you say oh my no no not me oh god
[1:04:19] oh look it's manifesting time
[1:04:22] oh we've had ones walk with us a long
[1:04:24] time been heroes of the faith have gone
[1:04:27] around the world and preached the
[1:04:29] message and they've been a champion for
[1:04:31] the message but all of a sudden
[1:04:34] one day they start to get up before
[1:04:36] their church or start to sow seeds of
[1:04:37] discrepancy
[1:04:40] seeds of doubt
[1:04:42] and before you know it they've turned
[1:04:44] away from the message and they're
[1:04:46] preaching another gospel
[1:04:50] and all of a sudden oh
[1:04:54] there were people there
[1:04:55] yeah i'm talking about a situation that
[1:04:57] happened there are people here like nah
[1:05:00] i know who i am
[1:05:02] i ain't sticking around for it but you
[1:05:04] know what there's a group of people that
[1:05:06] stuck around for it
[1:05:08] why because they didn't have a
[1:05:10] revelation
[1:05:11] and i tell you we got tonight
[1:05:15] oh you might start doing some soul
[1:05:16] search and start asking yourself do i
[1:05:18] really have a revelation of what the
[1:05:20] message is
[1:05:22] it ain't a dress code
[1:05:24] it ain't the message isn't god sent a
[1:05:26] prophet if the message is god sent a
[1:05:28] prophet you've completely missed it
[1:05:31] you've completely missed the message
[1:05:36] it's more than that
[1:05:39] and i'm telling you we need a revelation
[1:05:41] i say oh god give me revelation lord i
[1:05:44] got tonight lord jesus maybe in my mind
[1:05:46] i thought i had it all figured out maybe
[1:05:48] i know i've been going to a good church
[1:05:50] maybe something in my heart feels good
[1:05:52] about it nor am i starting to think
[1:05:53] about it it's later than we think lord
[1:05:56] and the plagues and the diseases of the
[1:05:57] land and the shutting church doors and
[1:05:59] everything what happens if this church
[1:06:01] ain't here on sunday
[1:06:04] what happens if we can't gather here
[1:06:05] anymore
[1:06:07] what happens if you're just left to
[1:06:09] yourself
[1:06:12] is there a revelation
[1:06:14] is there something that has taken place
[1:06:16] on the inside of you
[1:06:18] that you have met the lord jesus christ
[1:06:22] you know who he is because it's upon the
[1:06:25] rock of that revelation
[1:06:29] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:06:31] it
[1:06:34] the revelation of a good church
[1:06:37] you got a good pastor you got a good
[1:06:40] church you got a good family that's not
[1:06:42] enough to keep you
[1:06:44] nope
[1:06:46] the fact that you you go to church two
[1:06:48] three times a week and and you're a good
[1:06:50] person and and and you tithe and and you
[1:06:53] give to missions nope nope that's not
[1:06:55] that's not gonna save you
[1:06:58] but it's the revelation
[1:07:00] of who he is
[1:07:02] and that's why god had to send a prophet
[1:07:05] because the revelation of who he was was
[1:07:07] so covered up by the veil of traditions
[1:07:09] just like there in the old testament
[1:07:11] under that old covenant oh they were
[1:07:13] just bringing lambs and goats and they
[1:07:15] were sacrificing it and once a year the
[1:07:17] high priest was supposed to take blood
[1:07:19] behind the veil
[1:07:21] right once a year the priest was
[1:07:23] supposed to take the the blood of the
[1:07:24] red effort behind the veil and for the
[1:07:26] sins
[1:07:28] of the nation what was he supposed to do
[1:07:31] he was supposed to sprinkle
[1:07:33] the mercy seat i believe 12 times
[1:07:35] once for each tribe
[1:07:37] and under the old covenant that was an
[1:07:39] atonement a type of an atonement for the
[1:07:42] sins but you know what there wasn't even
[1:07:44] no mercy back there
[1:07:47] you realize in the days of herod under
[1:07:49] roman rule that that the israel and the
[1:07:52] church they were just under the bondage
[1:07:54] of the nation they were just living
[1:07:56] under rituals and and living under a
[1:07:59] man's traditions
[1:08:01] that when the word made flesh came and
[1:08:04] appeared amongst them that they denied
[1:08:06] the word
[1:08:09] oh friends the same thing happened in
[1:08:11] our generation by a divine promise god
[1:08:14] said as it was in the days of noah so
[1:08:16] shall i be in the coming of the son of
[1:08:18] man and malachi 4 5 i will send elijah
[1:08:21] to reten restore your hearts back to the
[1:08:23] faith of the fathers oh he said i will
[1:08:25] send the son of man ministry again to
[1:08:27] you and what did god do he came down in
[1:08:30] a vessel he veiled himself there was the
[1:08:33] word made flesh again proving he's the
[1:08:35] same yesterday today and forever and the
[1:08:38] denominational systems rejected it
[1:08:41] that's why he could stand there and say
[1:08:43] i indict this generation with the second
[1:08:45] crucifixion of jesus christ why because
[1:08:48] the word was on displayed
[1:08:53] oh my
[1:08:55] but thank god
[1:08:57] there is a people
[1:08:59] they got more than a good church come on
[1:09:01] somebody
[1:09:03] they got more than just a good story
[1:09:06] they got more than a man's idea they got
[1:09:08] more than a man's opinion they got none
[1:09:11] other than the lord jesus christ
[1:09:14] oh thank you jesus there is a power here
[1:09:17] tonight come on somebody there is a
[1:09:20] power in the house of god why don't you
[1:09:22] go ahead and ask for big things
[1:09:25] oh thank you jesus
[1:09:27] oh i know we're a little reserved i know
[1:09:29] we're a little setback but why don't you
[1:09:31] just loose yourself a little bit oh come
[1:09:34] on do we need to bring it do we need to
[1:09:35] put a game up here do we need to put
[1:09:37] your favorite uh
[1:09:38] team up here
[1:09:39] that's so they can score a touchdown so

[1:09:43] come on somebody
[1:09:45] do we gotta do we gotta fancy you and
[1:09:47] baby you and pet you
[1:09:51] oh maybe maybe if we give you some
[1:09:53] worldly something to get excited about
[1:09:55] maybe you'll just get a little loose
[1:09:57] yeah man
[1:09:59] i like that it's my favorite show
[1:10:01] brother
[1:10:02] i really get into this stuff
[1:10:05] you know i was thinking about it
[1:10:07] when i was out there in the world you
[1:10:08] know i used to see people carrying on
[1:10:10] and i hate to admit this but i remember
[1:10:11] going out to the
[1:10:13] to the the clubs and the bars you know
[1:10:14] these these people man
[1:10:17] they would be all dancing up and in the
[1:10:19] spirit and doing all that and be like
[1:10:21] how do they do that
[1:10:23] how do they even know how to do it
[1:10:26] i mean everybody's having a good time
[1:10:27] out there but
[1:10:28] i tried to do it and i kind of
[1:10:30] it doesn't look good
[1:10:32] but i found out one day
[1:10:35] they have something that's in those
[1:10:37] places that can stimulate you a little
[1:10:38] bit
[1:10:40] you see all them people out there acting
[1:10:42] a fool you know what you sit on the
[1:10:44] sidelines a little bit
[1:10:49] probably do that too
[1:10:53] of course i could do that
[1:10:56] you'll get so stimulated you're like hey
[1:10:59] what's going on
[1:11:02] i want to come out well come on do you
[1:11:05] do you realize that when jesus said look
[1:11:07] take this cup
[1:11:10] take this cup this is my blood of the
[1:11:13] new testament
[1:11:15] and drink all of it
[1:11:18] not just a portion
[1:11:19] take this cup
[1:11:21] drink all of it
[1:11:23] well you know what's in that cup
[1:11:27] there's stimulation
[1:11:30] there's wine
[1:11:31] what does wine represent
[1:11:34] it's the stimulation
[1:11:35] of revelation
[1:11:37] oh my the prophet of god said hallelujah
[1:11:40] he said that what is what is oil a type
[1:11:42] of in the scripture
[1:11:44] it's a type of the spirit
[1:11:46] and he said what is wine a type of he
[1:11:48] said it's the type of stimulation he
[1:11:50] said that oil and wine is always
[1:11:53] connected together why because it's the
[1:11:56] stimulation of revelation by the spirit
[1:11:59] word that comes to the individual oh no
[1:12:02] wonder that john was weeping there when
[1:12:04] nobody was worthy to take the book he
[1:12:06] was weeping but on the high oh my said
[1:12:09] weep not john for the lion of the tribe
[1:12:11] of judah has prevailed to take the book
[1:12:14] and loose the seven seals thereof oh my
[1:12:17] you want to know what john got
[1:12:19] stimulated
[1:12:21] john god stimulated the prophet of god
[1:12:23] said oh the most sublime act in all the
[1:12:25] scriptures he said john must have saw
[1:12:28] his name in there
[1:12:31] john got so stimulated he started
[1:12:33] screaming he started shouting the joy
[1:12:36] bells oh we're ringing why because he
[1:12:39] saw his name written in the lamb's book
[1:12:41] of life and he said oh and everybody
[1:12:44] heard i john saying blessings and honor
[1:12:47] and glory forever and ever why because
[1:12:51] there was stimulation of revelation i
[1:12:54] wish a little stimulation of revelation
[1:12:56] would break down in the house of god
[1:12:58] tonight that there would be a people
[1:13:00] that's free that would recognize that
[1:13:02] their name has been written on the
[1:13:03] lamb's book of life
[1:13:06] i'm tired of living for the world
[1:13:09] i'm tired of rooting for the rangers i
[1:13:11] really am
[1:13:12] tired of rooting for the cowboys i
[1:13:14] really am
[1:13:16] they're losers
[1:13:18] i want them to win but they're losers
[1:13:21] but oh

[1:13:48] losses
[1:13:50] the greatest champion a champion of
[1:13:54] champions my lord
[1:13:58] and if i read the word right
[1:14:01] he's here
[1:14:04] he's here
[1:14:05] what brother matthew
[1:14:07] jesus jesus is here
[1:14:09] what are you going to do
[1:14:11] are you just going to be pious
[1:14:13] yep okay
[1:14:15] i heard you brother matthew
[1:14:16] i've heard this a million times
[1:14:18] jesus is here amen
[1:14:21] wednesday night
[1:14:23] got to work tomorrow
[1:14:25] jesus is here i know god sent a prophet
[1:14:27] we got the message
[1:14:29] i've heard you try to pump up people
[1:14:30] before
[1:14:31] you're just an evangelist want to be
[1:14:33] brother matthew
[1:14:36] it ain't my words
[1:14:39] you know the problem is there's a
[1:14:40] fleshly veil here tonight
[1:14:43] there's a veil
[1:14:45] that is over the people tonight
[1:14:48] but if for one moment we can lay aside
[1:14:50] our thinking
[1:14:52] and we can start to look to the word and
[1:14:54] the mama that's me part of you
[1:14:57] can look into the word and say you know
[1:14:59] what that is nothing but the truth you
[1:15:02] know when you say the right things
[1:15:04] things happen just like hattie wright
[1:15:06] she said the right thing to the word i
[1:15:09] wonder if there's a people that have
[1:15:10] been gathered together in bedford texas
[1:15:13] that are going to say the right thing to
[1:15:14] the word and watch out something's going
[1:15:17] to happen things are going to start to
[1:15:19] shake things might start to break it
[1:15:21] might be those chains that you've been
[1:15:23] bound for all of your life but oh why
[1:15:25] don't you be like the blind beggar there
[1:15:27] why don't you be like blind bottom ass
[1:15:29] if jesus is here why don't you cry out
[1:15:32] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:15:38] jesus is here
[1:15:39] why don't you be like that woman with
[1:15:41] the blood issue what are you going to do
[1:15:43] if jesus is here what are you going to
[1:15:46] do about it
[1:15:48] i want to ask you is this just another
[1:15:50] good sermon is this just brother matthew
[1:15:53] trying to put some scriptures and some
[1:15:55] quotes to wow the people or is this the
[1:15:57] lord jesus christ veiling himself in the
[1:16:00] bride showing that he's the same
[1:16:02] yesterday today and forever ask for big
[1:16:06] things
[1:16:08] jesus is here
[1:16:10] oh why don't you just worship them why
[1:16:12] don't you praise them why don't in an
[1:16:14] atmosphere like this
[1:16:16] why did you go out and ask for what
[1:16:18] you've been praying for oh glory to god
[1:16:22] hallelujah
[1:16:24] oh
[1:16:25] sirs
[1:16:27] we would see jesus
[1:16:30] sirs
[1:16:32] how many want to see jesus
[1:16:35] sirs
[1:16:37] we would see jesus
[1:16:40] prophet of god said the greeks couldn't
[1:16:41] see him because of his earthly veil
[1:16:45] their god
[1:16:47] veiled
[1:16:48] in that tabernacle of jesus christ
[1:16:52] and they couldn't see him
[1:16:54] the prophet of god would say this
[1:17:00] god veiled hiding himself from the world
[1:17:04] veiled in human beings
[1:17:06] here was god those greeks saying we
[1:17:07] would see jesus
[1:17:18] and jesus said
[1:17:19] a corn of wheat has to fall and die
[1:17:22] look at this angle the prophet takes on
[1:17:24] this time
[1:17:25] maybe sometimes it's hard it's really
[1:17:27] hard to grasp the word we need a
[1:17:28] revelation
[1:17:29] look at the angle he takes on this

[1:19:49] while
[1:19:54] like those messiah love this like those
[1:19:56] disciples
[1:19:58] they couldn't explain
[1:20:00] about eating his body and drinking his
[1:20:02] blood
[1:20:06] they couldn't explain
[1:20:09] eat your flesh
[1:20:11] and drink your blood
[1:20:14] the prophet of god said but see
[1:20:17] they had done died to those things
[1:20:20] oh my
[1:20:22] look friends
[1:20:24] i'm dead to trying to figure out
[1:20:28] all the cases that people want to
[1:20:30] present whether the prophet was here or
[1:20:33] whether the cloud was over here or
[1:20:35] whether the bridge were people i'm dead
[1:20:37] to that
[1:20:38] you're talking to a dead man
[1:20:40] you want to go ahead and present your
[1:20:42] case to me i've done die to all those
[1:20:44] things because the message has
[1:20:47] introduced me to him
[1:20:49] i got
[1:20:51] take
[1:20:52] you want to take beef with john the
[1:20:53] baptist you're going to pay for it
[1:20:57] but john the baptist did his job
[1:21:00] what did you go out there to see i read
[1:21:02] shaken by the wind look all these people
[1:21:05] you know who they got issues with
[1:21:07] the flesh veil
[1:21:09] they can't see the spiritual
[1:21:12] come on
[1:21:14] well john was standing there and what he
[1:21:16] said i he said
[1:21:17] what did it say jesus saw him coming i
[1:21:20] mean john said i see jesus coming
[1:21:22] nobody else saw it
[1:21:24] but the prophet
[1:21:26] he said i saw the pillar of fire uh like
[1:21:28] like a dove come down that who saw it
[1:21:31] there were no other witnesses to it
[1:21:34] john saw it
[1:21:36] you want to take beef with john the
[1:21:38] baptist and say there was no other
[1:21:40] nobody else saw it that's fine but i'm
[1:21:43] like one of those disciples that were
[1:21:44] standing there i happened to be standing
[1:21:46] with the prophet one day and all of a
[1:21:48] sudden while i was standing listen to
[1:21:50] the prophet he said behold the lamb of
[1:21:51] god
[1:21:52] who takes away the sin of the world and
[1:21:55] i said what
[1:21:57] go
[1:21:58] that okay i'm gonna run after him that
[1:22:00] means i'm doing my job
[1:22:02] that's what i'm here for the prophet
[1:22:04] came to introduce you to christ the word
[1:22:07] go ahead you can take all the issue you
[1:22:09] want with the prophet you can say he
[1:22:11] said this wrong he did that wrong that
[1:22:14] vision didn't come to pass but you know
[1:22:15] what he did do he introduced me to my
[1:22:17] lord jesus christ and he took away the
[1:22:20] veil that fleshly veil was taken away
[1:22:23] the veil was wrecked and i can see jesus
[1:22:27] christ standing in our midst
[1:22:29] oh the presence of god is here ask for
[1:22:32] big things
[1:22:34] glory
[1:22:36] hallelujah praise his wonderful name
[1:22:40] oh hallelujah
[1:22:42] praise his wonderful name
[1:22:47] oh i want you to catch something here
[1:22:49] this will be for our benefit
[1:22:52] oh my
[1:22:54] i was thinking about that
[1:22:57] prophet said they've done died to that
[1:23:01] i got to thinking about you know
[1:23:04] didn't matter that they couldn't explain
[1:23:05] it
[1:23:07] guess where they made it to
[1:23:09] they made it to the upper room
[1:23:14] didn't matter
[1:23:16] everything they couldn't explain
[1:23:20] i'm sure
[1:23:21] they talked about it
[1:23:23] i'm sure peter and
[1:23:26] john and then they talked about it
[1:23:28] no no this is what he means like i i
[1:23:30] don't doubt all of them one day said you
[1:23:32] know
[1:23:32] what i don't know what's going on
[1:23:36] all we know
[1:23:38] is he has the words of eternal life
[1:23:41] and i'm just going to follow him
[1:23:44] they couldn't understand it
[1:23:47] so much so
[1:23:50] when jesus said
[1:23:54] you'll deny me
[1:23:55] peter said i'll never deny you lord
[1:23:59] peter didn't even know that that ability
[1:24:01] was in with in him
[1:24:04] and i was thinking about that when he
[1:24:05] denied the lord those three times and
[1:24:07] all of a sudden
[1:24:09] that crowed
[1:24:11] imagine how little he felt
[1:24:13] when all of a sudden those words
[1:24:18] you'll deny me three times
[1:24:21] imagine the guilt
[1:24:23] and the condemnation
[1:24:25] but guess what
[1:24:28] peter made it to the upper room
[1:24:31] maybe you're feeling a lot of guilt
[1:24:34] maybe you feel like you've done a lot of
[1:24:35] things wrong
[1:24:36] maybe you feel like you're not good
[1:24:38] enough for the message
[1:24:40] i got news for the devil
[1:24:42] take a look around they're still here
[1:24:45] they're still here they haven't given up
[1:24:48] why because god put something in him
[1:24:51] that can't give up he said i will write
[1:24:53] my word upon their heart i will put my
[1:24:57] spirit in them
[1:24:58] this is the covenant that i have made
[1:25:01] with you i will remember your sins no
[1:25:04] more you want the holy ghost it's here
[1:25:07] for you tonight you want deliverance
[1:25:09] it's here for you tonight you want your
[1:25:11] family it's here for you tonight you've
[1:25:13] been praying for it for a long time
[1:25:14] sister go ahead and claim it in the name
[1:25:17] of jesus christ
[1:25:18] oh glory to god
[1:25:20] hallelujah
[1:25:22] oh my
[1:25:23] this message isn't an idea
[1:25:26] not man's thinking
[1:25:31] so i just got to my inspiration
[1:25:35] we'll try to
[1:25:38] work towards will close here but i
[1:25:39] believe this will be for a benefit
[1:25:42] we're talking about being an able
[1:25:43] minister
[1:25:49] an able minister of the new testament
[1:25:52] you find out here in acts chapter 18
[1:25:55] there's a man by the name of apollos
[1:25:58] and the word would say this man was
[1:25:59] instructed in the way of the lord
[1:26:02] and being fervent in the spirit
[1:26:04] he spake and taught diligently the
[1:26:06] things of the lord
[1:26:07] knowing only the baptism of john
[1:26:11] now look at the attributes that are
[1:26:13] given to this man
[1:26:15] and he began in verse 26
[1:26:17] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:26:19] synagogue
[1:26:20] who when aquila and priscilla had heard
[1:26:24] they took him
[1:26:25] then and expounded unto him the way of
[1:26:27] god more perfectly
[1:26:29] now just think of this here's this man
[1:26:31] apollos he's well taught in the lord
[1:26:35] he's an eloquent man he's mighty in the
[1:26:36] scriptures
[1:26:38] oh that fervent in spirit he's he's like
[1:26:40] a he's fired up for the word
[1:26:43] he's going around and preaching he's
[1:26:45] instructed in the way of the lord he
[1:26:46] knows what he's talking about
[1:26:48] he knows what he's learned he he's heard
[1:26:50] the witnesses he believes believe that
[1:26:52] jesus christ has come
[1:26:55] he's recognized
[1:26:56] that god has done something
[1:26:59] he's actually been received by you know
[1:27:01] he's preaching the word
[1:27:04] but i want you to point out something to
[1:27:06] you
[1:27:09] apollos only had the mechanics
[1:27:12] he had the word but he didn't have the
[1:27:14] revelation
[1:27:16] of what the word came to do
[1:27:19] he had made a step in the right
[1:27:20] direction
[1:27:22] but he was preaching only the baptism of
[1:27:25] john
[1:27:26] there are many ministers and churches
[1:27:28] today
[1:27:29] that are only preaching that god sent a
[1:27:31] prophet they're only preaching malachi 4
[1:27:34] 5. they recognize that god sent a
[1:27:37] prophet they recognize that he brought a
[1:27:39] message but they haven't recognized if i
[1:27:42] could say this they're not an able
[1:27:44] minister of the new covenant because the
[1:27:46] new covenant came to do something in
[1:27:48] that blood covenant there was life
[1:27:52] he laid down his life he shed his blood
[1:27:54] that the life that was in the blood
[1:27:57] would come back upon the believer
[1:27:59] apollos was just a good baptist preacher
[1:28:03] and there's a lot of good message
[1:28:04] believers there's a lot of good message
[1:28:06] preachers but oh under an able minister
[1:28:09] by the new covenant there is a
[1:28:11] revelation to take the word and bring
[1:28:14] the people into the presence of god into
[1:28:16] a new birth by the baptism of the holy
[1:28:19] ghost
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:21] oh hallelujah oh god let me be that type
[1:28:24] of minister
[1:28:26] let me be an able minister
[1:28:28] oh my hallelujah
[1:28:32] oh he was just a good baptist preacher
[1:28:35] he wasn't able to bring people to the
[1:28:36] new birth
[1:28:39] i want to see new
[1:28:40] births i want to see the presence of god
[1:28:44] i want to see people delivered
[1:28:46] i want to see people changed
[1:28:48] i want to see the word
[1:28:50] living in an action
[1:28:53] that's what gets me
[1:28:54] excited oh my
[1:28:58] so there paul says he's preaching but
[1:28:59] then
[1:29:00] an able minister came to the coast of
[1:29:02] ephesus
[1:29:03] one by the name of paul
[1:29:06] said tell me a little bit about what
[1:29:07] you've been hearing
[1:29:08] how are you baptized
[1:29:10] oh yeah
[1:29:12] well how were you baptized well we were
[1:29:13] baptized on the baptism adjourned
[1:29:16] he said have you received the holy ghost
[1:29:18] since you believe we didn't even know
[1:29:20] there was such a thing
[1:29:22] given and there
[1:29:25] paul baptized them in true christian
[1:29:27] baptism
[1:29:28] not under john's baptism
[1:29:31] not under a baptist or a methodist or a
[1:29:33] pentecostal way of thinking but under
[1:29:34] the revelation
[1:29:36] of the age
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:40] the prophet of god would say this as we
[1:29:41] work towards a close quickly
[1:29:44] out of the token he says but you must
[1:29:46] have the token
[1:29:48] do you hear branham tabernacle do you
[1:29:51] hear a christian life tabernacle
[1:29:53] do you hear christian life tabernacle
[1:29:56] you must have the token displayed
[1:30:00] without it all your believing is in vain
[1:30:05] hear the prophet of the age speak
[1:30:09] all your believing is in vain see
[1:30:13] you'll live a good life
[1:30:15] you'll listen to what the word says
[1:30:18] you'll go to church you'll try to live
[1:30:20] right that's fine but that's
[1:30:23] not
[1:30:24] it
[1:30:25] now i'm talking about being an able
[1:30:27] minister i'm talking about a revelation
[1:30:29] of the new covenant a revelation of what
[1:30:31] the message has come to do it's not a
[1:30:34] way of living it's not a church system
[1:30:37] but the but the the token must be on
[1:30:39] display he said when i see the blood
[1:30:42] that's the token
[1:30:45] well i say take this to heart church
[1:30:49] oh maybe there's somebody here you've
[1:30:51] been wondering all the time whether you
[1:30:52] had it or not
[1:30:53] you don't have to wonder anymore
[1:30:56] why because jesus christ is here
[1:30:59] he's here to take away the fleshly veil
[1:31:02] of all your good works and all your good
[1:31:04] deeds and everything that you've done oh
[1:31:06] he'll just take that all away and if you
[1:31:09] can meet him
[1:31:10] friends there's nothing like being in
[1:31:12] his presence
[1:31:13] if you've ever been in his presence if
[1:31:15] you've ever been on the back side of the
[1:31:17] desert if you've ever been praying there
[1:31:20] and that fire has wrapped himself around
[1:31:22] you
[1:31:23] oh and it'll change you
[1:31:25] it'll make you different
[1:31:27] it'll be a revelation that's so real
[1:31:31] that it's beyond the five senses of your
[1:31:32] flesh it's beyond the church building
[1:31:35] it's beyond your friends it's beyond
[1:31:37] your family it's beyond everything
[1:31:38] that's around you because it's you and
[1:31:41] him alone you and him have become one
[1:31:44] you are bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:31:46] flesh life of his life spirit of the
[1:31:48] spirit you and him are one
[1:31:52] now that's a revelation
[1:31:55] come try to separate me from
[1:31:58] you can't do it
[1:31:59] i'm part of him
[1:32:02] galatians 5 24 says and they that are
[1:32:04] christ
[1:32:06] have crucified the flesh
[1:32:08] with the affections and lust
[1:32:11] that old nature's dead
[1:32:14] i want to just share this in closing
[1:32:17] we're talking about a revelation
[1:32:18] something's changed something's
[1:32:19] different
[1:32:21] but they that are christ have crucified
[1:32:23] the flesh
[1:32:24] with the affections and lust that old
[1:32:27] nature's dead
[1:32:29] does anybody know what it's like
[1:32:32] for the old man to die
[1:32:35] to absolutely die
[1:32:38] where you become a new person
[1:32:42] but something was i often tell my my
[1:32:45] testimony and there's of course no time
[1:32:47] to go into that but but when i was just
[1:32:50] when i was just in that transition
[1:32:52] of receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:32:54] ghost there was this voice that would
[1:32:56] speak and and and it had an influence on
[1:32:59] me in a sway and the only way i've ever
[1:33:01] been to describe it is like i would say
[1:33:03] i heard like the devil or demons saying
[1:33:05] this but you know that never really
[1:33:07] always made sense to me but but i came
[1:33:09] across this testimony
[1:33:11] and and brother branham was talking to
[1:33:13] brother sidney jackson and he's talking
[1:33:15] how many of you have seen the picture of
[1:33:16] the seven uh licks of fire the pillow
[1:33:18] fires taken out there in lake port
[1:33:19] california there's a picture of brother
[1:33:21] random standing at the pulpit and my
[1:33:23] there's just this beautiful rainbow of
[1:33:25] licks of fire that are going across them
[1:33:27] and this personal testimony
[1:33:30] brother sidney jackson is talking to
[1:33:31] brother branham and he says to him he
[1:33:34] says you know if you look close behind
[1:33:36] me on the platform you see that face
[1:33:38] that looks like an old indian chief
[1:33:41] and brother sydney goes well brother
[1:33:43] branham no i've i've really never
[1:33:46] noticed that before
[1:33:48] he said you see what happens he said
[1:33:51] when he said that's my old nature
[1:33:54] and he said your old nature is always
[1:33:56] there to haunt you
[1:33:58] but he said when you receive christ in
[1:34:00] his word
[1:34:01] the revelation of the hour
[1:34:03] he said the holy ghost and fire comes
[1:34:05] down in your soul and burns out your old
[1:34:08] nature
[1:34:10] but this is real important here like i
[1:34:12] said this is a personal testimony of
[1:34:13] brother sidney jackson and he said as
[1:34:15] the prophet was standing there he said
[1:34:18] the holy spirit comes down and burns out
[1:34:20] that old nature
[1:34:23] and he did like that with his hands
[1:34:26] and showed how that old nature
[1:34:29] it's always behind you it's never in
[1:34:31] position
[1:34:32] to make you do those things anymore but
[1:34:35] it always wants to try to insert its pla
[1:34:37] itself into a place of influence again
[1:34:40] oh my that started that that started to
[1:34:42] ring so true with me because i remember
[1:34:44] in my conversion as i was being
[1:34:46] converted and the holy spirit was was
[1:34:48] coming in and taking control there was
[1:34:50] this old nature there that say well i'll
[1:34:52] get you back out in the music i'll get
[1:34:54] you with music and tv oh there's always
[1:34:56] that temptation that old nature is right
[1:34:59] there always trying to attack you always
[1:35:02] trying to pull you back it's always
[1:35:04] wanting to come back into the driver's
[1:35:06] seat
[1:35:10] but let's listen to the words of paul
[1:35:12] and they that are christ
[1:35:15] have crucified the flesh
[1:35:18] this ain't a one-time act church
[1:35:22] if we want to start seeing the power of
[1:35:23] god we want to see the moving of the
[1:35:25] spirit we want to see signs and wonders
[1:35:27] we want revelation to be breaking out in
[1:35:29] the church
[1:35:30] we got to get down to business
[1:35:33] we got to start crucifying the flesh
[1:35:35] with the affections of the
[1:35:36] of lush
[1:35:37] and he says if we live in the spirit
[1:35:40] let us also walk in the spirit if the
[1:35:41] musicians would come
[1:35:45] if we live in the spirit
[1:35:47] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:35:49] we need more than the mechanics church
[1:35:53] it's more than just the letter it's more
[1:35:56] than just the work it's more than just
[1:35:57] going to church
[1:35:59] but we need the spirit to manifest the
[1:36:00] word that we believe
[1:36:02] we got to have the dynamics we got to
[1:36:05] have the holy ghost in action in our
[1:36:08] life
[1:36:08] oh that's what we preached last time
[1:36:10] about peter let me stir you up and put
[1:36:12] you into remembrance of these things
[1:36:14] look we know where we've come from we
[1:36:16] know what god's doing we know what he's
[1:36:17] done in this age but he said i want to
[1:36:19] stir you up that you be established in
[1:36:21] the present truth there is a present
[1:36:24] truth
[1:36:26] and maybe just leaving in on this quote
[1:36:29] in the presence of god unrecognized
[1:36:33] they can just lightly play something
[1:36:35] this is maybe
[1:36:36] a place to
[1:36:38] to end on right here
[1:36:42] look at the day that we're living in the
[1:36:43] presence of god unrecognized
[1:36:47] what's promised for this day
[1:36:50] now you know you know what the fleshly
[1:36:51] veil does
[1:36:54] 1963
[1:36:57] 1965
[1:37:01] is that all we got church
[1:37:04] we just look back
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:07] is that all we have
[1:37:12] look look at the day we're living in
[1:37:15] what's promised for this day
[1:37:17] where are
[1:37:18] we we've moved on up
[1:37:23] the pillar of fire moves
[1:37:27] and the children
[1:37:29] of israel moved with the pillar of fire
[1:37:32] or they went back to egypt
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:36] we gotta move with the word
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:40] lord help me to move with the word
[1:37:43] i'm tired of looking back
[1:37:46] i'm tired of looking back at what the
[1:37:48] word was
[1:37:49] tired of looking about you did it in the
[1:37:51] days of brother branham you did it in
[1:37:52] the days of paul you did in the days of
[1:37:54] moses
[1:37:56] but lord something in my heart
[1:37:59] i want to move with the word i want to
[1:38:02] move with the pillar fire
[1:38:04] when he says look at the day that we're
[1:38:06] living in that's this day
[1:38:08] where are we
[1:38:14] now if i could have all of your
[1:38:15] attention right now

[1:38:49] to pray until i can realize
[1:38:52] that i'm in the presence of god
[1:38:55] and recognize it
[1:38:59] i think that ought to be the thrill of
[1:39:01] the church
[1:39:03] is the presence
[1:39:04] of the holy spirit
[1:39:07] i think that ought to be the thrill of
[1:39:10] the
[1:39:10] church is the presence of the holy
[1:39:13] spirit
[1:39:15] seeing the god that made the promise
[1:39:17] standing among us
[1:39:19] fill his presence and see his word
[1:39:22] and see it vindicated
[1:39:25] it ought to give a faith to make
[1:39:27] cripples walk
[1:39:28] blind see
[1:39:30] death here
