[29:45] to direct our hearts and our lives lord
[29:47] god
[29:49] in jesus name we pray amen
[29:53] we may be seated uh we're gonna invite
[29:56] brother mike for the up some reading
[30:19] you know it's always a little bit
[30:22] intimidating
[30:24] to read psalm 119
[30:28] and uh even the possibility that i might
[30:30] read one
[30:31] psalm 119 for our sunday morning psalm
[30:34] probably has some of us gasping just a
[30:36] little bit
[30:38] we're going to look at the first eight
[30:39] verses this morning if you want to go
[30:40] ahead and stand
[30:43] you know as i was looking at these eight
[30:45] verses
[30:47] it occurred to me that the word is
[30:49] mentioned in every single verse
[30:53] in verse one it's his law in verse two
[30:57] it's his testimonies
[30:59] in verse three it's his ways in verse
[31:02] four it's his precepts
[31:04] in verses five and eight it says
[31:06] statutes
[31:08] in verse six it's his commandments
[31:11] and in verse seven it's his judgments
[31:15] each and every one of these phrases is a
[31:18] description of an attribute of the word
[31:21] of god
[31:23] you know his word is his law his word is
[31:26] his testimonies
[31:27] it is his judgments it is his ways
[31:30] every single verse in fact if you read
[31:32] the entirety of psalm 119
[31:34] almost every single verse with the
[31:35] exception of just a handful
[31:38] mentions his word you know not only does
[31:42] every verse mention his word
[31:45] but every verse here in the first eight
[31:48] mentions
[31:49] david's response to the word
[31:52] or his reaction to the word
[31:55] either some action he performs
[31:59] or some action he desires to perform
[32:02] in relationship with the word
[32:06] you know for example in verse six he
[32:08] says when i have
[32:10] respect to it pay attention to
[32:14] it consider it give it regard
[32:18] look at it four times it says
[32:22] that his desire is to keep it
[32:25] to retain it to hold it to hang on to it
[32:29] to not let it go to believe it
[32:34] twice he describes walking in it
[32:37] having your entire manner of life and
[32:40] your journey be ordered
[32:42] according to the word you know what a
[32:45] prayer
[32:46] you know but notice there's action
[32:48] associated
[32:50] with the word that's the relationship
[32:52] with the word
[32:54] there's one that caught my attention in
[32:57] verse seven
[32:59] it says i will praise thee with
[33:00] uprightness of heart
[33:03] when i shall have learned thy righteous
[33:06] judgments
[33:08] you know and i suppose one could look at
[33:10] that and think it's important
[33:12] you know to learn intellectually the
[33:15] contents
[33:16] of the word to study it as an object of
[33:20] academic study but if you look at that
[33:24] word
[33:24] to learn it's an action
[33:27] it doesn't mean to become knowledgeable
[33:31] but it means to become skilled like a
[33:33] craftsman
[33:34] yes you know any of you that are in the
[33:37] trades or
[33:38] even in a professional career knows that
[33:41] there's a process
[33:42] that somebody goes through to become
[33:44] skilled
[33:46] in that trade in that tool
[33:49] and it involves a number of steps one of
[33:51] it is you know as a
[33:52] as a young person maybe you start by
[33:54] paying attention to it
[33:56] focusing on how it's done looking at
[33:58] where it's used and then
[34:00] then you begin to retain some habits
[34:04] on how different tools might be used or
[34:06] a different job might be performed and
[34:08] then
[34:09] it becomes something that you do every
[34:10] day you keep walking it it becomes the
[34:13] focus of your life
[34:14] and your day and your week and then
[34:17] there becomes a point where
[34:18] you have learned it you're skilled you
[34:20] need no book
[34:21] you need no manual you know when
[34:23] something sounds a little off base
[34:25] you know in something when you've seen
[34:27] this pattern before how
[34:29] this is how you respond one could say it
[34:32] like this
[34:32] as you get to a point where you know
[34:36] what needs to be done what he wants done
[34:38] with the word
[34:40] you know being studious in those
[34:42] situations doesn't necessarily bring any
[34:44] value there's an experience
[34:46] of doing a practice and becoming skilled
[34:49] like a craftsman at no point did david
[34:52] say his action
[34:53] in response to the word was to study it
[34:56] his action was always motion pay
[34:59] attention to it
[35:01] keep it walk in it learn it
[35:04] become skilled in its use
[35:08] jesus said this in matthew 13 52
[35:11] he said then said he unto them therefore
[35:13] every scribe which is instructed
[35:16] skilled unto the kingdom of heaven
[35:20] is like unto a man that is a householder
[35:22] which bringeth forth out of his treasure
[35:24] things new and old you know an
[35:27] experienced householder or the steward
[35:29] of the house
[35:30] he knows exactly how to arrange things
[35:34] to place things just to suit the
[35:36] occasion
[35:37] or to please his master
[35:41] you know just like a skilled craftsman
[35:43] or a skilled householder there's a
[35:46] there's a promise that there's going to
[35:47] be a people that know what he wants done
[35:50] with his word by practice
[35:54] through continuous paying attention to
[35:56] how he
[35:58] uses the word to learn it
[36:01] you know so i thought as i was reading
[36:03] verse 7 when david says i will praise
[36:06] you with uprightness of heart
[36:08] when i have learned your righteous
[36:09] judgment you know
[36:12] that's certainly my prayer that i would
[36:14] get
[36:15] to a place where i become so skilled in
[36:17] the use of the word
[36:18] that i know what he wants done with it
[36:21] i will praise him when i will have
[36:24] learned
[36:25] his righteous judgments so maybe
[36:29] we'll read the first eight verses of
[36:30] that you know obviously you could spend
[36:32] all kinds of time in psalm 119 but
[36:34] that's just kind of what stuck out
[36:35] to me this morning so let's read that
[36:38] starting in verse 1
[36:40] blessed are the undefiled in the way who
[36:43] walk in the law of the lord
[36:46] blessed are they that keep his
[36:47] testimonies and that
[36:49] seek him with the whole heart they also
[36:52] do no iniquity
[36:53] they walk in his ways thou has commanded
[36:56] us to keep thy precepts diligently
[36:59] o that my ways were directed to keep thy
[37:02] statutes
[37:03] then shall i not be ashamed when i have
[37:05] respect
[37:06] unto all thy commandments i will praise
[37:09] thee with uprightness of heart
[37:11] when i shall have learned thy righteous
[37:13] judgments
[37:14] i will keep thy statutes o forsake me
[37:20] not
[37:36] [Music]

[1:04:48] this morning amen praise the lord
[1:04:53] and so god had a way of doing it and
[1:04:55] that was to send a messenger
[1:04:58] and the words those messengers were i
[1:05:00] sav
[1:05:01] that we could see so we want we want
[1:05:05] what
[1:05:06] we're doing to be anchored
[1:05:09] in god's planned word because that's
[1:05:12] where
[1:05:13] faith final resting place is is the word
[1:05:16] of god
[1:05:17] so if we can see this in the message
[1:05:20] we could see it's what god delivered to
[1:05:23] us
[1:05:23] we can take it personally to ourselves
[1:05:27] as coming from the divine throne of god
[1:05:30] that it's the word of god then we will
[1:05:33] begin to understand it can be manifested
[1:05:36] in us
[1:05:36] and we'll go over that this morning so
[1:05:38] let's turn in our bibles to ephesians
[1:05:46] the second chapter
[1:06:00] and let's just um
[1:06:07] start in the fourth verse of
[1:06:10] the second chapter of ephesians
[1:06:16] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:06:22] for his great love
[1:06:25] wherewith he loved us
[1:06:28] even when we were dead in sins
[1:06:33] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:06:36] by grace ye are saved just think you
[1:06:40] were
[1:06:40] quickened with them when you were
[1:06:42] already dead in sin
[1:06:45] i mean that's how great his love with
[1:06:47] was
[1:06:48] he looked right past that that
[1:06:51] in the ages to come
[1:06:59] he might show the exceeding
[1:07:02] riches of his grace
[1:07:06] in his kindness
[1:07:10] towards us through christ jesus
[1:07:14] so he wanted to show this grace he
[1:07:16] wanted to show this
[1:07:18] mercy he wanted to show it to us
[1:07:21] prove it to us for by
[1:07:24] grace are you saved
[1:07:28] through faith and that
[1:07:32] not of yourselves it is
[1:07:35] the gift of god not of
[1:07:39] works lest any man should boast
[1:07:44] now this is a great scripture here for
[1:07:47] we are
[1:07:48] his workmanship created
[1:07:52] in christ jesus on
[1:07:56] two good works
[1:08:00] which god hath before
[1:08:04] ordained that we should walk
[1:08:08] in them father add your blessing to
[1:08:11] the your word in your precious name we
[1:08:13] pray
[1:08:14] amen god bless you may be seated this
[1:08:17] morning
[1:08:22] i'm certainly by
[1:08:25] no means a a bible scholar
[1:08:29] at all or uh
[1:08:32] much of a a preacher as far as
[1:08:36] preaching goes but i do believe that in
[1:08:39] my heart
[1:08:40] it's that the ministry that god's given
[1:08:44] me is
[1:08:45] is that of a pastor and
[1:08:49] and you know what what a shepherd does
[1:08:52] is he tries to lead his sheep
[1:08:55] into fields where they can eat
[1:08:59] you you you you understand that
[1:09:02] it's already created in the sheep
[1:09:06] to eat and to take the food of god
[1:09:09] and turn it in to wool
[1:09:12] in other words it's the sheep's nature
[1:09:15] to bear
[1:09:16] wool and and a shepherd
[1:09:20] he he doesn't really need to
[1:09:25] be much he just needs to take the sheep
[1:09:28] to the field
[1:09:29] and say here's here's the food eat it
[1:09:33] and
[1:09:34] because god made them sheep they will
[1:09:37] automatically start producing wool or
[1:09:40] or uh we wouldn't hope that they'd be
[1:09:44] producing lamb chops but
[1:09:46] uh but so it it it it
[1:09:49] it automatically it is something so
[1:09:53] you have to understand that that my
[1:09:55] heart's
[1:09:56] uh desired this morning is
[1:09:59] to bring you to the things that were
[1:10:02] spoken
[1:10:04] today in our age and
[1:10:07] for the hour that we're living in
[1:10:11] and to have some sort of expectation
[1:10:14] and understanding of what god
[1:10:18] wants for us
[1:10:21] you you understand he has we all just
[1:10:24] read that he has
[1:10:25] mercy and in the ages that come he
[1:10:28] wanted to show us that
[1:10:30] merchant he wanted to show us those
[1:10:32] riches
[1:10:33] he wanted to show us that kindness that
[1:10:36] and that were for ordained to
[1:10:40] to walk in these works and
[1:10:43] so it's a wonderful thing that he has
[1:10:47] taken on the responsibility
[1:10:49] but he also passes a responsibility
[1:10:53] onto the believer and
[1:10:56] and our responsibility if we could say
[1:10:59] it that way is to believe his word
[1:11:03] that's all that's been allotted to us to
[1:11:06] do
[1:11:06] is to believe him we would have all
[1:11:10] believed him was never a question if it
[1:11:13] wasn't for
[1:11:14] the devil and the devil came along
[1:11:18] and he had a plan and god had a plan
[1:11:21] and the devil began to speak his plan
[1:11:24] and he tried to get
[1:11:26] eve to accept his plan and said no this
[1:11:29] isn't true and that's not true and we
[1:11:31] find out that he is a liar
[1:11:34] he's the father of lies
[1:11:37] could you imagine having your testimony
[1:11:40] be there's no truth in you
[1:11:44] you can't speak the truth you know we
[1:11:48] have a saying that some people lie when
[1:11:50] the truth sounds better
[1:11:55] and and uh so we
[1:11:58] as we begin to look at our place
[1:12:02] uh we understand and we we
[1:12:05] put our our our ourself in the place
[1:12:08] that
[1:12:08] that there's there's things that we
[1:12:12] are for ordained
[1:12:15] to be a part of and we want to make sure
[1:12:20] that we catch that understanding
[1:12:25] because the understanding of the world
[1:12:28] and the way the world operates is
[1:12:31] totally different than god's
[1:12:34] understanding of the world
[1:12:36] and the way god operates and what
[1:12:39] man has tried to do is he's tried to
[1:12:42] come in between
[1:12:44] there and see if he can mix them
[1:12:47] together
[1:12:48] well you can't take hot which is the
[1:12:51] true word of god and cold which is the
[1:12:53] devil
[1:12:54] and mix them together because all you
[1:12:56] end up with something that's
[1:12:58] lukewarm and it'll be spilled out of the
[1:13:01] mouths and
[1:13:02] and the trying to mix the world and the
[1:13:05] desires of man
[1:13:07] and the program of satan with the
[1:13:10] with the the plan of god and the word of
[1:13:14] god
[1:13:14] trying to bring them together to some
[1:13:17] sort of compromise
[1:13:18] is what's produced so many different
[1:13:21] denominations
[1:13:23] they're they're they're all man's ideas
[1:13:26] of
[1:13:27] how to blend the two but the two don't
[1:13:30] blend
[1:13:31] they weren't made to blend they weren't
[1:13:34] made
[1:13:35] we weren't made to live in the world
[1:13:38] we're in the world but we're not of
[1:13:42] the world and and
[1:13:45] if we could ever bring ourselves in our
[1:13:48] thinking to the full understanding
[1:13:52] that god is a hundred percent behind us
[1:13:56] to live totally by his word
[1:14:00] and he'll provide all the power
[1:14:03] all the grace all every
[1:14:07] substance that we need to live
[1:14:10] by faith
[1:14:14] of course the enemy don't believe that
[1:14:17] but that's what we
[1:14:18] i want to do we want to grow in our
[1:14:20] faith
[1:14:21] so as we we've been talking a little bit
[1:14:25] and we're going to play 12 minutes this
[1:14:28] morning out of the message
[1:14:30] called proving his word and
[1:14:33] that's the idea that we want to lay down
[1:14:36] is that god it will prove his word
[1:14:41] he'll prove it's true so we understand
[1:14:44] that
[1:14:45] that the word of god a word
[1:14:49] is a thought expressed
[1:14:53] now i've heard people talk i don't think
[1:14:56] they're expressing any thought they
[1:14:58] didn't think at
[1:14:59] all before they spoke but
[1:15:05] but we know that that's what
[1:15:09] we are taught and we understand that the
[1:15:12] word
[1:15:13] is a thought expressed so
[1:15:16] a a thought with god if we could say it
[1:15:19] that way
[1:15:20] in the beginning was god
[1:15:23] there he would he dwelt alone
[1:15:26] but he wanted to have fellowship and he
[1:15:29] wanted to be
[1:15:30] god and he wanted to share what his
[1:15:33] attributes were
[1:15:35] those things we've been over many times
[1:15:38] so god
[1:15:39] in his thinking set forth a
[1:15:42] plan he was going to
[1:15:46] create the heavens and earth he was
[1:15:48] going to make
[1:15:49] man in the image that man was going to
[1:15:52] be
[1:15:53] he was going to have fellowship with
[1:15:56] this man
[1:15:57] man he he had the whole
[1:16:00] vision of what that his plan
[1:16:04] was set within him
[1:16:08] so the first thing god had is a thought
[1:16:11] or a vision he in other words he saw
[1:16:16] what he was planning to do
[1:16:19] it it's like the we are talked a lot
[1:16:21] about the great architecture
[1:16:24] of michelangelo when he had in his
[1:16:27] thought in his thinking
[1:16:30] to make a statue of moses
[1:16:34] and i've been fortunate enough to see
[1:16:36] that statue
[1:16:38] and and i i told you i couldn't help
[1:16:41] myself when i
[1:16:42] got there it's it's in the church of the
[1:16:45] chains
[1:16:46] in uh in rome and
[1:16:50] and we went there and it's kind of dark
[1:16:54] you can't hardly see it but you got to
[1:16:56] put some money in a little machine
[1:16:58] and it turns on the lights and we
[1:17:02] understand that we're being raised a
[1:17:04] catholic and
[1:17:06] so at least i didn't have to light a
[1:17:08] candle
[1:17:10] and and and so we uh
[1:17:14] put in and there was that statue you
[1:17:16] know
[1:17:17] and i i just you know i just
[1:17:20] i'm sure every believer that's ever
[1:17:22] stood in front of that statue
[1:17:23] yelled at it speak
[1:17:28] and and that that kind of means uh
[1:17:32] a lot when i start to look at that great
[1:17:35] uh message the masterpiece
[1:17:39] because he said that within his mind
[1:17:41] it's like an
[1:17:42] architect he he's got something in his
[1:17:45] mind
[1:17:46] and then he goes to build it to
[1:17:49] to build it and so god wasn't a builder
[1:17:54] because he didn't he's a creator so we
[1:17:56] had
[1:17:57] something in his mind and then he began
[1:18:00] to
[1:18:00] create it to create it
[1:18:04] but he said when the it finally came
[1:18:06] into the image of what that he had in
[1:18:08] his mind
[1:18:09] and he was so inspired to see what that
[1:18:13] he
[1:18:14] had thought come into a reality
[1:18:18] that he he he got so inspired he smoted
[1:18:23] with the hammer and said speak
[1:18:26] so the understanding of that was that
[1:18:29] there's something that was in the vision
[1:18:31] in god's mind so he had the vision
[1:18:35] and then he spoke what
[1:18:38] that that thought was he said
[1:18:42] let there be
[1:18:46] light and
[1:18:49] then there was light
[1:18:53] and he said let there be he says the
[1:18:56] first day he did this
[1:18:57] and the second day he did that and then
[1:19:00] he separated this
[1:19:01] and he had this come forth all those
[1:19:04] things were the thoughts that he already
[1:19:06] had in his mind
[1:19:08] then he was speaking them out and
[1:19:11] and he spoke and told what the vision
[1:19:14] or what the thought was
[1:19:17] so when he told what the vision was and
[1:19:20] what the thought was
[1:19:22] that became the word
[1:19:26] because the word was the thought
[1:19:28] expressed
[1:19:29] a virgin shall conceive
[1:19:33] that was his vision and then he spoke it
[1:19:37] and said a virgin shall conceive
[1:19:41] so it was his vision that a virgin would
[1:19:43] conceive
[1:19:44] before he spoke it then he spoke
[1:19:48] that of virgin shall conceive and then
[1:19:50] this
[1:19:51] is the part and then that is made
[1:19:54] tangible because the whole plan of god
[1:19:58] was that god
[1:19:59] wanted to make the things that he was
[1:20:03] the vision that he had the word
[1:20:06] that he spoke he wanted to make it
[1:20:09] real and make it flesh
[1:20:14] that's what he wanted to do so when the
[1:20:17] word comes to pass
[1:20:20] it's made tangible let there be light
[1:20:25] well he knew what light was
[1:20:28] because that was his vision then he
[1:20:31] spoke it
[1:20:32] and said let there be light and when it
[1:20:35] was made
[1:20:36] flesh it became the interpretation
[1:20:40] of what that that thought was
[1:20:43] and it became a reality oh if you could
[1:20:47] see yourselves because you
[1:20:50] are the light of the world
[1:20:55] and this light shined amongst men and it
[1:20:58] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:21:00] word was the light of men
[1:21:03] and it shined in darkness and darkness
[1:21:06] comprehended it not
[1:21:08] right but so you you when we begin to
[1:21:11] see that
[1:21:12] you are the light of the world amen
[1:21:17] whoa that means there's something that
[1:21:21] that what was light light was the word
[1:21:24] manifested it was the word made tangible
[1:21:28] so we understand we become the thoughts
[1:21:32] of
[1:21:32] god what he had in his mind
[1:21:35] what he spoke so he said there would be
[1:21:38] a bride
[1:21:39] he said there would be an elect lady he
[1:21:41] said there would be a church without
[1:21:42] spot
[1:21:43] or wrinkle somebody that word was
[1:21:47] predestinated
[1:21:49] to somebody so i'll just stop here for a
[1:21:53] moment
[1:21:53] and i i know that
[1:21:57] we've got uh you multilingual and
[1:22:02] and people and i know maybe it's hard
[1:22:04] for
[1:22:05] uh some of our
[1:22:09] members that speak different languages
[1:22:13] but you can always go back
[1:22:18] and read it and i hope in the future
[1:22:21] somehow that
[1:22:22] we'll be able to uh
[1:22:29] be able to play it on the screens in in
[1:22:32] the different languages
[1:22:35] that it's in but we're gonna we're gonna
[1:22:37] start
[1:22:38] here just a just like 12 minutes i guess
[1:22:41] is
[1:22:42] all that it is on paragraph 59
[1:22:46] of proving his words he says a very odd
[1:22:49] little
[1:22:49] text three words that i want to speak
[1:22:54] from out of this reading
[1:22:58] you might say that's a very small thing
[1:23:01] three words out of all you read
[1:23:04] a portion of two chapters of the bible
[1:23:08] but i did that for a background to take
[1:23:11] these three words
[1:23:13] proving his word
[1:23:16] so if he had the thought
[1:23:21] and then he spoke it
[1:23:25] well he's got to bring it to pass
[1:23:29] and that that that is got to have
[1:23:32] something that
[1:23:33] anchors in because when he comes
[1:23:37] looking for this lady the select lady
[1:23:40] when he comes looking for his bride to
[1:23:43] harvest her
[1:23:45] and take her and see if she's ripened in
[1:23:49] the maturity
[1:23:50] to be brought into the garner of his
[1:23:53] kingdom
[1:23:54] he's looking for one thing will there be
[1:23:58] faith on the earth
[1:24:01] that's what he's looking for so if we
[1:24:03] could understand that he's got to prove
[1:24:05] his word
[1:24:06] so let's just listen to this 12 minutes
[1:24:10] and then we will uh go on
[1:24:13] a little bit then we'll listen to 17
[1:24:16] more minutes but this is sunday school
[1:24:19] this morning
[1:24:20] we're here to anchor in god's word we're
[1:24:23] we're here to know what the messenger
[1:24:26] said take it into our heart and let it
[1:24:30] build in us and mature us into
[1:24:33] what that we need to be
[1:24:38] how many rick thinks the hour is getting
[1:24:41] late
[1:24:42] amen it's a lot later than uh
[1:24:47] it was before so let's just go
[1:24:50] forward with this uh god richly bless
[1:24:53] you as we listen to this 12 minutes
[1:24:56] and then we'll go a little farther thank
[1:24:58] you
[1:25:01] a very odd little text
[1:25:05] three words that i want to speak from
[1:25:08] out of all this reading you might say
[1:25:12] that's a very small
[1:25:13] thing three words out of all that you
[1:25:17] read
[1:25:18] a portion of two chapters of the bible
[1:25:20] but i i did that
[1:25:22] for a background to
[1:25:25] take these three words proving
[1:25:29] his word
[1:25:32] you know there's a scripture in the
[1:25:34] bible in first thessalonians 5 21
[1:25:38] word is written prove all
[1:25:41] things hold fast to that which
[1:25:45] is good when anything
[1:25:49] is proven it will
[1:25:53] either be proven right or wrong
[1:25:57] and when there's anything in question it
[1:26:00] should be proven
[1:26:03] until you find out what is right and
[1:26:06] then
[1:26:07] as you find what is right it says hold
[1:26:10] fast in other words grip it
[1:26:15] don't turn it loose hold it fast in
[1:26:18] other words
[1:26:18] hold it tight so that
[1:26:22] it will not slip hold
[1:26:25] fast to that which is good after it's
[1:26:28] been
[1:26:28] proven right and anything that's proven
[1:26:33] not right then turn it loose as quick as
[1:26:36] you can
[1:26:37] get away from it don't never hold on to
[1:26:41] the wrong
[1:26:42] thing now it is possible that
[1:26:45] staunch christians find people
[1:26:48] uh hold sometimes hold to the
[1:26:52] wrong thing thinking it is right
[1:26:57] but then these things should be proven
[1:27:01] whether they are right or wrong and it's
[1:27:04] the duty of all of us
[1:27:05] as we are expecting to go
[1:27:09] to heaven when jesus comes
[1:27:12] and it's a minister's duty when any
[1:27:15] question is brought up
[1:27:17] that he solves this out
[1:27:21] and then proves it before the people
[1:27:25] that they might
[1:27:26] understand because no one wants to be
[1:27:29] found
[1:27:30] wrong holding to the wrong thing
[1:27:33] so we have a scripture and jesus said
[1:27:35] all scriptures must
[1:27:36] be uh fulfilled that we should prove
[1:27:40] all things and then hold
[1:27:44] fast or hold tight get a
[1:27:47] death grip on it and don't turn it loose
[1:27:50] hold fast to that which is good
[1:27:55] i remember at school i learned something
[1:27:59] and many of you learned the same lesson
[1:28:01] when you
[1:28:02] have solved a problem worked it out
[1:28:06] you can take the answer and prove it by
[1:28:09] the problem how many ever did that all
[1:28:10] of you of course
[1:28:12] then then you don't have to worry
[1:28:15] whether your answer is
[1:28:16] right or not the problems answer
[1:28:20] has been proved by the problem
[1:28:23] therefore you know you got the right
[1:28:25] answer
[1:28:27] if every one of yours on your slate or
[1:28:29] sheet
[1:28:30] has been proven the problem proved by
[1:28:34] the answer proved by the problem
[1:28:37] then you've got it no one can say it's
[1:28:40] wrong
[1:28:41] you've got to get and if you do your
[1:28:43] work neatly
[1:28:45] and correctly and the way it should be
[1:28:47] done and your answer has been proved
[1:28:49] you can sit back and rest with the
[1:28:51] assurance that you're going to get a
[1:28:53] a on that on that sheet of paper that
[1:28:55] you turn in because
[1:28:57] it's been proven proven by
[1:29:00] the problem now
[1:29:03] there is also an old proverb it says
[1:29:06] prove it i'll believe it
[1:29:10] nah they got a one of our state one of
[1:29:13] our states in the nation
[1:29:15] they have a slogan i'm from missouri
[1:29:18] show me see in other words prove it to
[1:29:21] me
[1:29:22] i'm from missouri but this doesn't work
[1:29:27] always because god
[1:29:30] has in every age fulfilled and proved
[1:29:35] the work that
[1:29:39] he has set out for that age and spoken
[1:29:42] in his word
[1:29:43] and every time that god's word
[1:29:46] has been proven in the age the majority
[1:29:49] has
[1:29:49] turned it down
[1:29:53] so uh prove it and i'll believe it is
[1:29:56] not so
[1:29:58] you can only have faith as god gives you
[1:30:00] faith
[1:30:02] faith is a gift of god every how
[1:30:05] religious you may be
[1:30:06] yet it must take the it might you must
[1:30:09] have faith
[1:30:10] and your faith can only rest if you are
[1:30:12] a christian upon the proven
[1:30:15] word of god amen i remember god allotted
[1:30:18] his word to each agent
[1:30:20] foretold what would happen in
[1:30:23] this certain age that he was speaking on
[1:30:26] now if moses would have come with the
[1:30:28] message of noah it would not work
[1:30:31] if jesus would have come with moses
[1:30:33] message it would not have worked
[1:30:35] or one prophet came with the other
[1:30:37] prophet's message it not a word
[1:30:39] but through his prophets he has revealed
[1:30:41] the entirety
[1:30:42] of all of himself and his plan
[1:30:47] therefore the bible cannot be one word
[1:30:49] added to it or
[1:30:50] one word taken from it so if you prove
[1:30:53] your problem
[1:30:54] by your answer by your problem then why
[1:30:57] not
[1:30:57] prove the the answer that we're now
[1:31:00] getting by the word
[1:31:02] of this age if the bible speaks that a
[1:31:06] certain thing is to happen in this age
[1:31:08] it's in the bible and it will happen
[1:31:10] then if your answer that you're trying
[1:31:12] to tell the people
[1:31:13] if it's proven by the book then it is
[1:31:17] true
[1:31:18] it's true otherwise it isn't now we see
[1:31:22] another
[1:31:23] then you no doubt have heard them say
[1:31:26] seeing
[1:31:26] is believing that's another old proverb
[1:31:29] we have here
[1:31:31] but that doesn't work either it doesn't
[1:31:34] work because
[1:31:35] man can set and look right straight at
[1:31:38] anything
[1:31:39] and they'll not see it the word
[1:31:42] see the english word c has so many
[1:31:46] different meanings to it
[1:31:48] c might mean a body of water c might
[1:31:50] mean to understand c might mean to look
[1:31:52] at it and
[1:31:53] oh there's just all kinds of words you
[1:31:54] can use but
[1:31:56] when you say seeing is believing
[1:31:59] you're mistaken when you understand it
[1:32:01] you believe it
[1:32:03] jesus said except the man be born again
[1:32:06] he cannot
[1:32:06] see the kingdom in other words
[1:32:09] understand the kingdom because the
[1:32:11] kingdom
[1:32:12] is the holy spirit in you so you have to
[1:32:15] understand what this
[1:32:16] is in you the only way you'll understand
[1:32:19] it is compare
[1:32:20] what it makes you do with what the bible
[1:32:22] said it would make you do
[1:32:24] then your problem solved and then he
[1:32:27] is that holy spirit so seeing
[1:32:31] is not believing i can prove that but
[1:32:33] the senses of the body
[1:32:35] see seeing is not believing i can not
[1:32:38] see this bottle of oil
[1:32:40] i could not see it because it's behind
[1:32:42] me yet i have a sense
[1:32:43] of a feeling it tells me i've got it in
[1:32:45] my hand
[1:32:46] hey i couldn't see it's impossible and
[1:32:49] now
[1:32:50] i cannot reach it it's impossible and
[1:32:53] yet i believe it this seeing is
[1:32:54] believing
[1:32:55] this feeling is believing now i'll close
[1:32:57] my eyes
[1:32:58] i neither could see it or feel it but if
[1:33:01] i get it close to
[1:33:02] could smell it i still believe it's
[1:33:04] there so
[1:33:06] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:33:09] for the evidence
[1:33:10] not seen taste felt smell or heard you
[1:33:14] believe it and faith must have a resting
[1:33:18] place
[1:33:18] and anything is contrary to the word of
[1:33:21] god faith
[1:33:22] in god can have no resting place unless
[1:33:24] it's a promise
[1:33:25] of god and there it takes its eternal
[1:33:28] stand but in the face of all these
[1:33:32] undoubting ages and things that we have
[1:33:34] went through and live in today the worst
[1:33:36] of all
[1:33:37] in the face of all this doubt god
[1:33:41] does uh go right
[1:33:44] on proving his words to be
[1:33:48] right as he has in every age
[1:33:52] he unbelief doesn't stop god
[1:33:56] it doesn't hinder him i don't care how
[1:33:58] much the world
[1:33:59] unbelieves it's still going to happen
[1:34:03] unbelief doesn't do nothing
[1:34:06] but condemns the unbeliever
[1:34:09] the unbelief will send the unbeliever
[1:34:13] to hell it'll rob him of every blessing
[1:34:16] god promised him but it doesn't hinder
[1:34:18] god from going right on with the
[1:34:20] believer
[1:34:22] unbelief doesn't stop god it only stops
[1:34:24] the unbeliever
[1:34:26] you say uh the sun is going to shine
[1:34:28] tomorrow i'm going to stop it you're
[1:34:29] trying
[1:34:31] and all right you can't do it god
[1:34:34] has set it in order and said it would
[1:34:35] shine it's going to shine that's all
[1:34:37] he said it would there might be some
[1:34:39] clouds in it but it's still shining just
[1:34:41] the same
[1:34:42] you can't stop god with that he what
[1:34:45] how does he make his word known to the
[1:34:47] people
[1:34:48] first god knowing that there would be
[1:34:51] unbelievers now watch the wisdom of god
[1:34:53] knowing there would be unbelievers and
[1:34:55] how the majority would be unbelievers
[1:34:58] he by foreknowledge predestinated
[1:35:01] a seed forever age that would believe it
[1:35:06] now if you notice in there for each age
[1:35:10] uh goes right on with his word
[1:35:14] everything right on time nothing hinders
[1:35:17] god he goes right on and
[1:35:19] every click is moving just exactly right
[1:35:21] we think sometimes it's
[1:35:22] not going to work right don't you worry
[1:35:24] his clock is timed
[1:35:26] just exactly to the split instant and
[1:35:28] everything's working just exactly right
[1:35:31] when i look around sometime and see
[1:35:32] these rickies and rickettas
[1:35:34] that we got today and on the streets and
[1:35:36] however things going on
[1:35:37] i think oh god wait a minute he says see
[1:35:41] my timepiece is turning
[1:35:44] just exactly right i've got to put you
[1:35:46] up on the same bases i did the first man
[1:35:49] them days i put you on the same bases of
[1:35:51] lutheran on the same basis away
[1:35:53] wesley because you see sin wasn't
[1:35:56] knowing then like it is now
[1:35:58] and when we got more knowledge now than
[1:36:00] we had then
[1:36:01] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:36:03] the spirit of god raises a standard
[1:36:05] against it
[1:36:06] see and now today we've got more
[1:36:09] knowledge
[1:36:10] more understanding so the rivers of
[1:36:13] unbelief is
[1:36:13] flowing in hard but god
[1:36:17] raises a standard against it but
[1:36:19] remember he's
[1:36:20] always the reason that he he
[1:36:23] predestinated these things to happen
[1:36:25] he foretold him by his prophets they
[1:36:27] would happen
[1:36:28] and when the righteous see these things
[1:36:30] confirmed
[1:36:32] then they know it's right regardless of
[1:36:35] what anyone else says
[1:36:36] they know it's right
[1:36:41] you don't want to stop i mean i don't i
[1:36:43] don't know what's wrong with me but i
[1:36:45] just it just keeps opening up
[1:36:49] that you you know let that soak in
[1:36:55] okay because he he proves his word
[1:36:59] in every age and unbelief doesn't stop
[1:37:03] god so how many of you felt just like
[1:37:07] brother branham's felt he says i see all
[1:37:10] these ricketies i see all these kids i
[1:37:12] go oh god
[1:37:14] and he says but wait a minute
[1:37:16] everything's
[1:37:17] right on time
[1:37:20] is that right it's just perfectly
[1:37:24] uh uh perfectly laid out there
[1:37:28] and he says he says and now today
[1:37:32] we've got more knowledge no
[1:37:34] understanding
[1:37:35] so the rivers of unbelief is flowing
[1:37:38] hard
[1:37:38] but god raises up a standard against it
[1:37:42] now where's the standard
[1:37:48] that he's raising up
[1:37:54] you see this is the the thing
[1:37:57] that is a very delicate
[1:38:00] razor's edge line that
[1:38:04] i'm i'm gonna try to express
[1:38:08] just for this moment here it's so
[1:38:12] easy for us to look back
[1:38:15] and say that brother branham was
[1:38:18] that standard and he was
[1:38:22] but he was the first fruit amongst
[1:38:26] many brethren you you understand
[1:38:30] he wasn't the soul standard
[1:38:33] he wasn't the soul marker
[1:38:36] because even that's what the lord was
[1:38:38] that he might become the first fruit
[1:38:40] amongst many brethren because so
[1:38:44] the the he came
[1:38:47] and and he he wasn't
[1:38:52] the message he was the messenger
[1:38:56] the message was the eternal word of god
[1:39:00] that was in god's thoughts in the
[1:39:02] beginning
[1:39:03] but man had perverted god's thoughts so
[1:39:07] much that god had to raise somebody back
[1:39:11] that could bring us back to the pure
[1:39:14] thought of the pure expression of god's
[1:39:17] word
[1:39:17] in the beginning not a new word
[1:39:24] the only thing that made it seemingly
[1:39:28] like it was a new word is because there
[1:39:32] wasn't a predestinated seed there
[1:39:35] to receive it the predestinated seed was
[1:39:38] there to
[1:39:39] receive wesley's message or
[1:39:42] luther's message there was a
[1:39:44] predestinated seed that was there
[1:39:46] that received the restoration of the
[1:39:49] gift but when the seals were opened
[1:39:52] and the third pull and the mysteries of
[1:39:54] god and the furtherance of the
[1:39:56] revelation
[1:39:57] of the godhead and the plan of god there
[1:40:00] was a predestinated seed there to
[1:40:02] receive that
[1:40:04] that's the standard
[1:40:08] that he raised up
[1:40:13] and he says that he says
[1:40:17] he says he god raised a standard
[1:40:21] against it see and now today we've got
[1:40:24] more knowledge
[1:40:25] more understanding so the rivers of
[1:40:28] unbelief
[1:40:29] is flowing in hard but god raised up a
[1:40:32] standard against it but remember
[1:40:34] he always the reason he predestinated
[1:40:38] these things to happen
[1:40:40] he foreordained them by the prophets
[1:40:42] they would happen
[1:40:44] but what did he just say over here he
[1:40:47] said that
[1:40:48] by his foreknowledge he predestinates
[1:40:52] a seed for every age that would believe
[1:40:56] it
[1:40:57] now you've noticed in there for each
[1:41:01] age goes on with his word
[1:41:04] everything's right on time
[1:41:07] so you can see he predestinated a seed
[1:41:10] that predestinated seed is the standard
[1:41:15] let's let's let's just ask ourselves a
[1:41:18] little bit
[1:41:20] are we meeting our obligations are we
[1:41:23] we meet our are are we recognizing
[1:41:26] what our call is in life our
[1:41:30] we don't want to just sit back and be
[1:41:33] lukewarm
[1:41:36] and that's what that's what we were
[1:41:38] preaching is that
[1:41:40] is that if he's foreordained
[1:41:43] it for each age then he's
[1:41:46] he's got something in his plan
[1:41:49] that's made flesh for each age
[1:41:54] and so we realized he says so
[1:41:57] when the word of god is coming to pass
[1:42:02] and and he
[1:42:05] spoke that in in the little section
[1:42:08] that we just listened to when the word
[1:42:11] of god comes to pass
[1:42:13] it stirs the elect into action
[1:42:19] that's what it does
[1:42:22] i wonder how many people
[1:42:26] when they saw the and i know it went
[1:42:30] across the social media platforms and
[1:42:33] many of the brethren's in many churches
[1:42:36] uh
[1:42:36] put it on their uh bulletin board
[1:42:40] and everything of the comments that the
[1:42:44] prophet of god made concerning the woman
[1:42:46] that would rise up in america and
[1:42:50] that he saw her in a purple uh
[1:42:54] address i guess is the
[1:42:57] terminology dressed in in purple
[1:43:00] now you would think that
[1:43:04] they read those things
[1:43:09] but what does she do she goes there she
[1:43:11] shows up at her inauguration
[1:43:13] in purple
[1:43:17] just exactly we we saw we've seen how
[1:43:20] many things
[1:43:21] in this last year or so have we seen
[1:43:24] come to pass
[1:43:25] that people have posted that that
[1:43:28] they've
[1:43:28] they've brought the quotes up about the
[1:43:30] mask and
[1:43:31] going in and and the prophet's vision of
[1:43:35] working with the test tubes and
[1:43:37] looking up and the man-made all those
[1:43:40] things that were seen
[1:43:42] striking the fact that they used the
[1:43:44] word plague
[1:43:46] and and all the things that you you
[1:43:49] would think
[1:43:49] you would begin to realize that really
[1:43:53] there's somebody else in control
[1:43:56] amen if i just want to get under that
[1:43:59] control
[1:44:00] don't you that that's a control that i
[1:44:03] want to get under i want to get under
[1:44:06] and be a part of what it
[1:44:09] is that's happening but don't you
[1:44:12] realize
[1:44:13] something's happening okay young people
[1:44:16] you're old enough to wake up
[1:44:18] and and realize there's something going
[1:44:20] on here
[1:44:24] you know i mean i know you've got your
[1:44:26] jobs i know you go to school all that's
[1:44:28] fine
[1:44:29] but don't let it blind you don't let it
[1:44:32] cover your eyes don't let it
[1:44:34] you know get eye salve that you can see
[1:44:37] that
[1:44:37] that the vision's made clear to you
[1:44:41] you understand that that you're on a
[1:44:44] path and
[1:44:45] things come in your life that are fine
[1:44:47] you've got to
[1:44:48] you you make those but when someone
[1:44:51] comes something comes along
[1:44:53] is trying to alter your path it
[1:44:56] forces you in the valley of decision
[1:44:58] where you've got to make the choice
[1:45:02] and don't think you're going to get
[1:45:05] you're going you're not going to be
[1:45:06] faced with choices
[1:45:11] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:45:14] looking he wants to prove his word
[1:45:17] he's looking for men and
[1:45:20] women that will make their choice
[1:45:24] according to what's best for them
[1:45:27] in the relationship to their god
[1:45:30] and their future and what they believe
[1:45:34] is transpiring
[1:45:38] and so god is going to
[1:45:42] prove everything he spoke
[1:45:46] yeah and and when the word starts to
[1:45:49] come to pass
[1:45:51] it wakes up and it stirs the elect
[1:45:56] it's a wake-up call well i remember
[1:46:00] something about this i mean
[1:46:04] think of it i remember when i first came
[1:46:07] into the message we talked about that
[1:46:10] car
[1:46:13] that would drive itself i was in a car
[1:46:17] the other day
[1:46:18] guy pulled up to a parking spot said
[1:46:20] watch this
[1:46:21] he pressed the button and that car
[1:46:23] packed itself into that parking place
[1:46:26] i said let me out of this thing
[1:46:35] they got the gps technology they've got
[1:46:38] everything you know you know how it is
[1:46:41] in a car you drive you get too close it
[1:46:43] goes b
[1:46:44] b b b b b you know i don't always
[1:46:47] exactly drive in the center of the lane
[1:46:49] you know i'm a little swervy in my old
[1:46:52] age and
[1:46:52] that thing's going off all the time so
[1:46:55] how do you turn this thing off
[1:46:58] but i want you to stop for a moment
[1:47:01] we used to talk about that
[1:47:06] it's here it's
[1:47:09] here but it doesn't shake us
[1:47:12] does it stir us up does it awaken us
[1:47:16] well let me tell you something i believe
[1:47:18] that it's starting to stir
[1:47:20] the elect because there's
[1:47:23] people that are starting to make
[1:47:26] decisions
[1:47:27] for god they realize i've got to get out
[1:47:31] of this slump
[1:47:32] i've got to shake myself i got to get
[1:47:35] the cobwebs out
[1:47:37] i i've got to get a clear vision i've
[1:47:40] got to get back on fire
[1:47:42] i've got to draw an eye unto god
[1:47:47] amen now you can do that without emotion
[1:47:55] and you don't want emotion to be a
[1:47:58] substitute
[1:47:59] for the real actions
[1:48:04] so the real believer starts
[1:48:08] looking for the promises and the things
[1:48:12] that are to come to pass
[1:48:18] when the timepiece goes off you say wait
[1:48:20] a minute
[1:48:23] this lady just showed up in a purple
[1:48:24] dress
[1:48:26] just exactly
[1:48:30] the way the prophet of god said it would
[1:48:31] be yeah
[1:48:35] and then you go back over
[1:48:38] and and just the things we've seen the
[1:48:41] mask
[1:48:41] this the uh i don't have them i probably
[1:48:44] should have wrote a list of them but
[1:48:46] i if not i'll just get sidetracked into
[1:48:49] all the things
[1:48:50] that but my point is is that
[1:48:54] when the believer sees these signs
[1:48:58] coming they look up
[1:49:03] because their redemption is drawing not
[1:49:06] and they ask himself what
[1:49:09] kind of condition
[1:49:12] represents that i'm
[1:49:16] prepared
[1:49:19] what would a prepared believer
[1:49:22] be doing what would a prepared believer
[1:49:27] be thinking what what would be the
[1:49:30] concerns
[1:49:33] on the heart of someone
[1:49:36] that recognized the sign
[1:49:43] because that's what signs are for signs
[1:49:46] are directions
[1:49:48] they're pointing you to something so why
[1:49:51] would
[1:49:52] a messenger from god say i saw a vision
[1:49:55] and i saw them coming i saw a great
[1:49:57] woman coming into power
[1:49:59] and i saw her dressed in purple
[1:50:03] the first woman that
[1:50:06] this far away from the white house
[1:50:11] shows up in purple
[1:50:15] now here's the thing that i kind of
[1:50:18] chuckle in my heart
[1:50:20] if i could say it this way everybody
[1:50:22] says well she's supposed to be beautiful
[1:50:27] well that's so carnal and
[1:50:30] fleshly this woman is beautiful
[1:50:34] to the ungodly to the liberal to the one
[1:50:38] that doesn't believe a woman should be
[1:50:40] at home
[1:50:41] raising children and i'm not against
[1:50:44] women working
[1:50:45] others there's times when you have to
[1:50:47] work the prophet of god
[1:50:48] said that uh he said that them
[1:50:52] them women worked so their husbands
[1:50:54] could get out and preach the gospel
[1:50:56] there's a balance there's decisions that
[1:50:58] you make together
[1:50:59] as husbands and wife there's family
[1:51:02] decisions that
[1:51:03] are not me it's not up to me as the
[1:51:05] pastor to say
[1:51:06] you can play sports you can't play
[1:51:08] sports you do that in your family
[1:51:10] there's family decisions my job's just
[1:51:13] to preach the word of god
[1:51:15] to point you to what the prophet of god
[1:51:18] said
[1:51:18] then you go listen to it all i can say
[1:51:22] is here's the field
[1:51:24] here's the tape you understand here's
[1:51:28] the quote
[1:51:29] but i'm not the enforcer of the word of
[1:51:32] god
[1:51:34] i can tell you sisters don't wear high
[1:51:37] heels
[1:51:39] well you'll have to go through the
[1:51:40] litany of what's high
[1:51:45] okay but you know there's a scripture
[1:51:47] that answers that
[1:51:49] go to the elder women in the church who
[1:51:52] are to teach the younger woman
[1:51:54] you want to know how high high is sister
[1:51:57] coast my wife
[1:52:04] but if you want how high high is
[1:52:08] no i've preached against high heels for
[1:52:10] 50 years
[1:52:12] i still get them you understand
[1:52:16] so what am i going to do put jackson at
[1:52:18] the back door with a hacksaw
[1:52:21] come here a moment sister
[1:52:26] why we'd have a box fuller heals
[1:52:32] and then it would be well did you cut it
[1:52:33] too short i don't know
[1:52:35] you don't but that's not what a believer
[1:52:39] does the believer sees
[1:52:41] the signs and they start looking
[1:52:44] into the word of god for the answer
[1:52:50] they prove the
[1:52:53] word by the problem
[1:52:58] the problems were in ladies we're blind
[1:53:01] miserable
[1:53:02] poor wretched and don't know the the
[1:53:05] problem is it's a moral declare
[1:53:07] the problem is that they're uniting
[1:53:09] together against god's word
[1:53:12] in bedford right here in bedford
[1:53:16] we've been struggling with the city for
[1:53:18] two years
[1:53:21] to get a church built because they
[1:53:24] didn't know their drainage
[1:53:26] systems they don't know where their
[1:53:27] water lines are
[1:53:30] and this piece of property sat there
[1:53:32] dormant for all these years and all of a
[1:53:33] sudden they want to develop it
[1:53:35] and they don't have answers bedford
[1:53:39] never had a bar
[1:53:46] and you had to have 80 percent food
[1:53:49] sales
[1:53:50] now it's they don't even enforce it
[1:53:54] bedford in this year
[1:53:58] is going to have three
[1:54:01] liquor stores
[1:54:06] one's two of them are right on the
[1:54:10] corner
[1:54:11] of where you turn down the street from
[1:54:13] my house
[1:54:16] the old lubies and the old flood ruckers
[1:54:19] are now liquor stores you know where the
[1:54:22] third one is
[1:54:24] it's in the message church
[1:54:32] i thought oh you trinitarian devil you
[1:54:38] you understand what i'm saying
[1:54:42] in other words this isn't the bedroom
[1:54:44] community that
[1:54:45] texas some influences have come in
[1:54:48] the people have come in what do they
[1:54:51] want they want
[1:54:52] bedford is landlocked they want more
[1:54:55] money
[1:54:58] so for the love of money the root
[1:55:02] of evil sets in
[1:55:06] and now they're selling liquor which is
[1:55:09] the
[1:55:10] the moral decay of more young
[1:55:14] women and men
[1:55:18] that allow themselves to come under the
[1:55:21] thing
[1:55:21] let me say you girls don't you ever
[1:55:26] let any guy ever talk to you at all
[1:55:28] about taking a sip of alcohol
[1:55:32] he's trying to impair you
[1:55:39] let alone drugs
[1:55:43] you have to be foolish
[1:55:48] not to understand that something that
[1:55:51] imperish your
[1:55:52] judgment and the way you drive in the
[1:55:55] way you think
[1:55:56] thousands of people are killed under the
[1:56:00] influence
[1:56:01] because children and mothers have lost
[1:56:04] their lives
[1:56:05] because of liquor and our city has
[1:56:08] become so
[1:56:09] sick that they vote to put stores in
[1:56:13] that sell that stuff
[1:56:20] just face it the spirit's taping
[1:56:26] fight just remember he said you're the
[1:56:30] nuts
[1:56:31] that are holding the world together
[1:56:34] you're the oddballs
[1:56:38] you notice the whole spirit i'm sorry i
[1:56:39] got up on this but you notice the whole
[1:56:41] spirit
[1:56:42] of the world today is all conform if you
[1:56:45] don't if you
[1:56:46] if you don't agree with somebody you're
[1:56:48] the oddball guy out
[1:56:50] you can't even express uh you express
[1:56:54] anything it's like it snowed the other
[1:56:58] day so a guy built a snowman
[1:57:00] the neighbor came across the street says
[1:57:03] why isn't it a snow woman
[1:57:10] and then the other person comes and says
[1:57:12] it's got to be a snow person
[1:57:17] i mean that's the way people are kidding
[1:57:21] it's just it it it's lost it
[1:57:25] but the the elect
[1:57:29] as they see the day approaching
[1:57:35] as they see the day of approaching they
[1:57:38] forsake
[1:57:39] not the assembling of themselves
[1:57:40] together we see every sign of the day
[1:57:43] approaching
[1:57:44] and the government is stopping believers
[1:57:47] from assembling together
[1:57:49] poor in canada they're allowed 25 in one
[1:57:52] room and
[1:57:53] 25 in another room
[1:57:58] they're almost to the point they're just
[1:58:00] going to pay the fines and get arrested
[1:58:04] just think of it the
[1:58:08] the the the
[1:58:11] unbelief that is increasing
[1:58:14] but remember unbelief doesn't
[1:58:18] stop god everything's
[1:58:22] right on time but the signs
[1:58:26] wake up the believer for to start
[1:58:29] looking for the promises and the things
[1:58:32] that are to come to pass
[1:58:34] and because they want to find out what
[1:58:37] part do they play
[1:58:40] in the fulfillment of the word of god
[1:58:48] that's what i want to have anchored in a
[1:58:50] heart
[1:58:53] the world getting rotten is right on
[1:58:55] time
[1:58:57] right and
[1:59:00] it got a whole purpose
[1:59:04] god's plan i liked how he he used that
[1:59:09] and and he used that word uh
[1:59:13] as we were listening he
[1:59:16] he used the word he said this he says
[1:59:20] or one prophet come with the other
[1:59:22] prophet's message
[1:59:23] it it would not have worked but through
[1:59:26] his prophets
[1:59:28] he has revealed the entirety of
[1:59:31] all of himself and his
[1:59:34] plan through the prophets he's revealed
[1:59:39] the plan
[1:59:41] so we should be able to look
[1:59:44] into the prophet's message
[1:59:47] because modern events are made clear by
[1:59:50] prophecy
[1:59:51] and understand and see god's plan
[1:59:55] then we should be able to look at
[1:59:56] ourselves and say
[1:59:58] where am i fitting in god's plan
[2:00:04] that's right okay what is what is my
[2:00:09] where am i at and that's why i wanted to
[2:00:13] look at ephesians
[2:00:15] he says for we it's not our works
[2:00:19] not our good doing but by grace
[2:00:22] we are saved that's election
[2:00:29] by by nothing that we've done not of
[2:00:31] ourselves
[2:00:33] but of his love and his mercy towards us
[2:00:37] that it might be shown not of works
[2:00:40] lest we should boast
[2:00:44] but we say praise god
[2:00:47] i see
[2:00:51] i see not the seeing here
[2:00:56] but i see by
[2:00:59] revelation i see because my eyes have
[2:01:03] been
[2:01:04] opened i've received i sab you've
[2:01:06] received i says look at yourself yeah i
[2:01:09] don't deserve it
[2:01:12] i don't know why i see i don't know why
[2:01:16] it's so plain to me i don't
[2:01:19] i don't clean why when i listen to what
[2:01:22] he says
[2:01:23] it it permeates my soul
[2:01:27] and little statements just stand out
[2:01:30] that
[2:01:31] are so vivid
[2:01:34] can i boast no
[2:01:37] it's by grace this by mercy
[2:01:41] not in ourselves lest any of us should
[2:01:43] boast
[2:01:45] not of good works that not of works
[2:01:48] lest any man should boast
[2:01:52] for we are his
[2:01:55] workmanship that's right
[2:01:59] we are his vision
[2:02:05] and made flesh his workmanship
[2:02:10] is the tangible
[2:02:15] flesh reality
[2:02:18] of his word everything he prophesied in
[2:02:23] jesus
[2:02:24] all the vision was what he would be
[2:02:27] me everything that it said how he would
[2:02:30] die
[2:02:31] all those things that were seen in this
[2:02:33] vision
[2:02:34] that were spoken through the prophets a
[2:02:37] virgin shall conceive
[2:02:39] every single one of those who was made
[2:02:41] tangible
[2:02:42] and made flesh
[2:02:45] that was his workmanship nobody else
[2:02:49] could do that
[2:02:50] right but him okay
[2:02:53] we are his workmanship created
[2:02:56] in christ jesus in other words we were
[2:03:00] created in the vision
[2:03:04] we were created in the spoken word
[2:03:09] that's where we are created
[2:03:13] that's where we were predestinated
[2:03:18] undo good works
[2:03:23] boy that takes in other words
[2:03:29] it's taken i believe
[2:03:33] that's all i have to do
[2:03:39] i believe god sent a prophet i believe
[2:03:42] he was the messenger i believe he opened
[2:03:44] the seals i believe this i believe i
[2:03:46] believe that
[2:03:48] what about the good
[2:03:51] works that you
[2:03:56] as an individual were created
[2:04:00] in jesus christ to do
[2:04:04] created in christ jesus unto good works
[2:04:08] which god hath before
[2:04:13] for ordained
[2:04:16] or god hath before ordained
[2:04:20] that we should walk
[2:04:25] in them
[2:04:30] there's got to be a walk somewhere
[2:04:34] right now let's just take a look at
[2:04:38] ourselves for a moment
[2:04:40] we all claim to have heard the scream
[2:04:43] right
[2:04:45] so we all have claimed to flap
[2:04:48] our wings out of the chicken yard
[2:04:52] we place the title upon ourselves
[2:04:55] as the elected
[2:04:59] lady the bride
[2:05:02] of christ that's quite a boast
[2:05:07] now
[2:05:10] i pray god that that boast is true
[2:05:17] you know if something's a hundred
[2:05:18] percent wool you stick the label on and
[2:05:21] say it's a hundred percent wool
[2:05:24] so if we make the claim that we're a
[2:05:27] hundred percent wool i hope you get the
[2:05:29] type
[2:05:32] then that's okay to wear that sticker
[2:05:35] if you are
[2:05:40] now if god created you
[2:05:44] that right
[2:05:48] predestinated you to that
[2:05:50] then he's got to prove his word
[2:05:58] so he's got to be behind you
[2:06:01] but now let's listen to the next 17
[2:06:03] minutes i don't know how late it is but
[2:06:06] yeah we should be out by a little bit
[2:06:09] so let's listen to the next 17 minutes
[2:06:12] that we want to listen to and it's in
[2:06:16] works is
[2:06:20] faith expressed
[2:06:25] so if you believe it
[2:06:29] is that right so if if we believe
[2:06:33] something then we've got to
[2:06:37] it's got to become more of a
[2:06:41] a reality a reality to us
[2:06:45] then than just uh
[2:06:51] leaving it in our head
[2:06:55] see if god would have left it just when
[2:06:57] he spoke it
[2:06:59] and never brought it to pass he would
[2:07:02] have never proved
[2:07:04] his word but when it becomes
[2:07:08] tangible and in the flesh then it
[2:07:11] becomes the word
[2:07:12] truth so in other words so we're not
[2:07:14] just predestinated to eternal life
[2:07:20] but we're also predestinated to fulfill
[2:07:24] the word that was allotted to us
[2:07:29] so we already know there's a lot of word
[2:07:34] or a lot of predestinated people
[2:07:38] that are going to prove that word
[2:07:40] there's already a people that's
[2:07:42] been allotted and placed in the age
[2:07:46] to bring the past tangibly
[2:07:49] and make that word flesh
[2:07:53] look now that's where we have to start
[2:07:56] stepping in
[2:07:57] to the picture and so i just like to
[2:08:00] play this 17 minutes
[2:08:03] of out of the message works
[2:08:07] is faith expressed
[2:08:10] and and i i want you to catch notice
[2:08:13] i i don't have any other vocabulary
[2:08:16] other than when i say i want i mean i
[2:08:20] want the lord to reveal to you so
[2:08:23] um but i don't want to pre
[2:08:27] be presumptuous in any way
[2:08:30] but as we listen to this i believe we're
[2:08:34] starting on paragraph uh
[2:08:39] see if i can find it i don't
[2:08:43] i didn't write it down what paragraph
[2:08:46] gary do you remember what paragraph
[2:08:47] we're starting on
[2:08:49] what we're starting on paragraph 122
[2:08:53] in in the message uh
[2:08:58] works as faith expressed now just
[2:09:01] remember
[2:09:02] think of that ephesian scripture that
[2:09:05] you have
[2:09:09] for ordained good works
[2:09:12] that you are for gain to walk in
[2:09:17] so if you see the sign of the time
[2:09:21] in our hearts we might start looking for
[2:09:24] what those works are
[2:09:26] amen the lord bless you as we listen to
[2:09:28] this few
[2:09:30] moments this is sunday school this
[2:09:32] morning we want to
[2:09:33] we really want to fall in love with this
[2:09:36] message
[2:09:37] and get real serious about it god bless
[2:09:40] you
[2:09:42] jesus said that no man can come to me
[2:09:45] except
[2:09:48] my father draws him first and all that
[2:09:51] the father has given me
[2:09:53] will come to me no man can understand
[2:09:56] who he
[2:09:57] is or how it is except to be revealed to
[2:10:00] you
[2:10:01] by the revelation of god and then faith
[2:10:04] in that you
[2:10:04] act accordingly see here we see
[2:10:08] plainly that god is revealed in
[2:10:11] jesus and only those who were
[2:10:14] foreordained to see it will
[2:10:16] see it amen
[2:10:19] be sure to read this scripture i omitted
[2:10:21] it then that's saint john
[2:10:23] 6 44-46 i omitted it because i thought
[2:10:27] maybe we'd
[2:10:28] uh have a maybe a not enough time to go
[2:10:31] through because that clock up there just
[2:10:33] keeps moving and
[2:10:34] so we uh you notice no man
[2:10:38] no man can come except my father draws
[2:10:40] him first
[2:10:41] and all the father has given me they
[2:10:43] will come
[2:10:44] they'll recognize it no other man can do
[2:10:46] it no other person no matter how good
[2:10:48] who you are it's got to be
[2:10:50] revealed to you then you see
[2:10:54] who jesus christ is
[2:10:57] now here predestinated plan is in plain
[2:11:00] view
[2:11:01] just as other seed the word of god is a
[2:11:05] seed
[2:11:05] and must have the ground prepared
[2:11:10] beforehand if you sowed seed just thrown
[2:11:13] out
[2:11:13] on the ground it would do no good the
[2:11:16] birds would pick it up
[2:11:17] if you throw it among thistles and
[2:11:19] thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon
[2:11:22] jesus parable says so so the ground has
[2:11:24] to be made ready first
[2:11:27] so god in sovereign grace
[2:11:33] prepares a heart first
[2:11:36] he prepared you before the foundational
[2:11:38] world to receive
[2:11:40] him in this age he foreknew you by his
[2:11:43] foreknowledge and
[2:11:44] ordained you to eternal life amen
[2:11:48] therefore he prepared you that's where
[2:11:50] you staggered out of these things and
[2:11:52] staggered into what you have now
[2:11:53] it was god leading you to the place
[2:11:57] where he had ordained for you to be
[2:12:00] if or if this ground isn't prepared
[2:12:04] beforehand it can't grow
[2:12:07] that's reason the seed of faith when
[2:12:09] you're preaching faith see the
[2:12:10] discernments of the lord and see what
[2:12:12] takes place and all the gifts of the
[2:12:13] bible organ
[2:12:14] people work themselves out hallelujah i
[2:12:16] believe it and come up and find
[2:12:17] themselves disappointed
[2:12:19] the ground has to be for ordained
[2:12:23] and you know when it strikes it like my
[2:12:26] little eagle last night
[2:12:28] he knew when he heard that scream of
[2:12:30] that mother eagle there's a lot
[2:12:32] difference between that and the cluck of
[2:12:33] the hand
[2:12:34] because he was an eagle from the egg
[2:12:39] not he wasn't made an eagle right then
[2:12:41] he always was an eagle
[2:12:43] and a christian always was that's
[2:12:48] reasonably divorced when you're divorced
[2:12:50] because you were trapped into it
[2:12:52] see by your first parent adam and eve
[2:12:55] you become a sinner by nature you didn't
[2:12:58] want to be
[2:13:00] but now you heard the gospel and faith
[2:13:03] cometh by hearing
[2:13:04] revelation comes by hearing
[2:13:07] there is a little something inside of
[2:13:09] you another man set right by you saying
[2:13:11] oh i don't believe that stuff
[2:13:13] nonsense i don't believe that nothing to
[2:13:15] that like today on the day of
[2:13:16] pentecostal life said these men are full
[2:13:17] of new wine
[2:13:19] bro well it was a great thing to those
[2:13:21] it was happening to
[2:13:22] why it was god revealing himself
[2:13:28] to the individuals while others laughed
[2:13:31] these were rejoicing
[2:13:33] it was an individual revelation which
[2:13:36] is faith faith it's revealed if it
[2:13:38] wasn't faith then it wouldn't even be
[2:13:40] there
[2:13:40] it was faith just seeds has to have the
[2:13:43] ground
[2:13:44] prepared first therefore all he foreknew
[2:13:48] he called all he called all he for knew
[2:13:52] he predestinated if you want to read
[2:13:54] that romans 8
[2:13:55] 28 34 and also ephesians 1 1-5
[2:13:59] see all he foreknew
[2:14:02] he did call all he called he justified
[2:14:06] and all he justified
[2:14:07] he has already glorified
[2:14:12] there's nothing out of order we think
[2:14:14] there is
[2:14:15] but look in the scriptures it's just
[2:14:17] kidding exactly the way god's word said
[2:14:19] it was
[2:14:20] we see the messages rejected today isn't
[2:14:23] that just what the scripture said they
[2:14:24] would do
[2:14:25] sure all these things are ordained of
[2:14:28] god
[2:14:29] oh it should make you walk happy that's
[2:14:31] our trouble with we today
[2:14:32] so much difference from the christians
[2:14:34] of old when the real
[2:14:35] true revelation of jesus christ being
[2:14:38] emmanuel
[2:14:39] dwelled in the hearts of those men they
[2:14:40] were rugged people
[2:14:42] but today we're padded by the
[2:14:44] nominations of oh i'll tell you they
[2:14:46] ain't got the revelation come over here
[2:14:47] you're depending on their revelation
[2:14:50] if their revelation isn't according to
[2:14:52] the word of god then it's wrong
[2:14:54] mind or anybody else's that's where the
[2:14:56] showdown comes
[2:14:57] the word of god tells which is right and
[2:15:00] wrong
[2:15:01] and you see that to have its ground of
[2:15:03] course therefore
[2:15:05] all he four knew see he already knew
[2:15:07] what was going to happen
[2:15:09] notice jesus said again about the seed
[2:15:12] some fell on rocks others and mixed
[2:15:15] grounds
[2:15:15] see overall his thorns thistles and
[2:15:17] everything else he couldn't grow
[2:15:19] and others on good ground good ground
[2:15:22] good
[2:15:22] soil which has been prepared
[2:15:26] already prepared all the man out here
[2:15:29] he's
[2:15:29] like as the chicken he's looking along
[2:15:31] trying to find he hits into this and he
[2:15:33] hits into that
[2:15:33] but actual while there comes a sudden
[2:15:35] scream from heaven
[2:15:37] he recognizes that right quick that's
[2:15:38] the word of god
[2:15:40] see he knows it because there's
[2:15:42] something in his heart
[2:15:43] that's been told to him revealed to him
[2:15:45] about him
[2:15:47] notice the prophet isaiah said
[2:15:50] a virgin shall conceive
[2:15:53] what a strange thing how a man in his
[2:15:56] right mind could say that
[2:15:58] there'd never been a virgin conceived
[2:16:01] a virgin shall conceive
[2:16:05] now he didn't worry about saying it he
[2:16:07] just said it
[2:16:08] how's she going to do it well that's not
[2:16:10] his business
[2:16:12] it's just to say what god said it was
[2:16:14] going to do god revealed it to him
[2:16:17] showed him the vision revealed it and it
[2:16:19] was right just the same god that told me
[2:16:21] that little baby be born with that man
[2:16:23] who couldn't have a
[2:16:24] the child uh have a girl like others and
[2:16:27] the things
[2:16:27] how it sounds strange when the doctor
[2:16:29] says it can't happen
[2:16:31] but when god says it's going to happen
[2:16:33] it depends on what kind of a word that
[2:16:35] falls in
[2:16:36] remember the prophet stood up there and
[2:16:38] his word went forth
[2:16:39] like god in genesis 1 he said let there
[2:16:42] be light
[2:16:43] let there be this let there be that
[2:16:46] create a man in his own image
[2:16:48] an image of god creating them male and
[2:16:50] female and there was nothing on the
[2:16:52] earth yet
[2:16:53] then we find out in genesis 2 here he
[2:16:55] made man in his own image there's no man
[2:16:57] to till the soul
[2:16:58] after the rest of creation what was it
[2:17:00] it's his words he was speaking it
[2:17:03] and when he spoke he said let there be
[2:17:05] light there might have not been
[2:17:07] light for 800 years afterwards
[2:17:11] might not be no light but he said it as
[2:17:14] long as he said it
[2:17:16] let there be a palm tree let there be an
[2:17:18] oak tree let there be this
[2:17:19] them seeds was forming down beneath that
[2:17:21] water
[2:17:23] that's right and in the season in the
[2:17:26] time in its own season
[2:17:29] it brought forth it can't fail it's
[2:17:31] god's word
[2:17:34] it just can't fail it's been expressed
[2:17:38] now one day god talked to man face to
[2:17:41] face but
[2:17:42] in time of moses when the fire was
[2:17:43] falling they said let god let moses
[2:17:45] speak
[2:17:46] not god we might perish therefore he
[2:17:49] said
[2:17:49] i'll speak to him like that no more i'll
[2:17:51] raise him up a prophet that's the way
[2:17:53] god's system always was now here's a
[2:17:55] prophet standing
[2:17:56] now he's under inspiration he doesn't
[2:17:58] think about his intellectuals well wait
[2:18:00] a minute if
[2:18:00] i'd say that well you know the people
[2:18:03] that think i'm insane
[2:18:05] see that's his intellectual there he's
[2:18:08] listening to satan
[2:18:09] just like eve did as long as the doctor
[2:18:12] says
[2:18:13] that you can't live you can't get well
[2:18:15] you can't do this or that
[2:18:16] as long as you listen to that that seed
[2:18:19] will never fall in that kind of ground
[2:18:20] to do any good
[2:18:22] it can but when something tears all that
[2:18:25] away
[2:18:29] and it falls in that bedding ground
[2:18:31] there's nothing can tear it out
[2:18:33] amen now
[2:18:36] no matter how long it takes it's going
[2:18:39] to happen
[2:18:40] now he said a virgin shall conceive
[2:18:44] did you know it was 800 years
[2:18:47] before that happened god foreknew the
[2:18:50] woman
[2:18:50] who should be what her name was where
[2:18:53] that seed would fall
[2:18:54] into you believe that
[2:18:58] or it did and from a literal womb would
[2:19:01] come forth
[2:19:02] this great miracle god knew about it he
[2:19:05] just revealed it to his prophet who was
[2:19:07] faithful
[2:19:07] and spoke the word without even thinking
[2:19:10] about what it was he just
[2:19:11] said it you never tried to reason it out
[2:19:15] if you kind of reason out what if this
[2:19:17] man this woman or
[2:19:18] this man sitting here or somebody tried
[2:19:20] to reason now i've been crippled all
[2:19:22] these years
[2:19:23] the doctor says is not a possible chance
[2:19:27] well there might not be as far as he
[2:19:30] knows
[2:19:32] that's true but if
[2:19:36] something can tear away them weeds
[2:19:39] if god buys grace not the preacher not
[2:19:42] nobody else
[2:19:43] but god can place into your heart
[2:19:47] a revelation that i'm going to be well
[2:19:50] there isn't nothing going to keep you
[2:19:51] sitting here
[2:19:53] there's nothing can hold you there
[2:19:56] you're
[2:19:56] going to be well but until that does
[2:20:00] happen you're going to sit right where
[2:20:02] the doctor says you're going to sit
[2:20:04] until that happens it has to be
[2:20:07] revealed it's the grace of god that
[2:20:10] reveals it
[2:20:11] now notice god knew the woman it would
[2:20:15] come to
[2:20:15] notice isaiah there was no question
[2:20:19] i said i didn't say wait a minute lord
[2:20:21] let wait just a minute
[2:20:22] what did you say to me a virgin is going
[2:20:25] to conceive
[2:20:26] well not now wait father there never was
[2:20:28] such a thing is that done he didn't
[2:20:30] hesitate
[2:20:31] he just said a virgin shall conceive
[2:20:35] right notice mary no now lord wait a
[2:20:39] minute you know i i never know the man
[2:20:41] this is impossible
[2:20:42] nothing like this never happened oh no
[2:20:45] nothing like this never happened how am
[2:20:46] i going to have this baby i don't know
[2:20:48] any man
[2:20:48] so it can't happen angel you're just
[2:20:50] mistaken i've got an optical illusion
[2:20:54] you know my church says these days are
[2:20:56] gone no
[2:20:57] it'll never fail in such a place as that
[2:21:00] mary
[2:21:00] never questioned she said how can it be
[2:21:03] an old old man
[2:21:04] he said the holy ghost will overshadow
[2:21:06] thee
[2:21:07] that's how it's going to happen she said
[2:21:09] behold the hands made of the lord
[2:21:12] no question see isaiah when god
[2:21:16] produced the word by thought revelation
[2:21:20] into the heart of isaiah it fell into
[2:21:23] the right grounds as a prophet
[2:21:26] that prophet didn't care for any man's
[2:21:28] wisdom
[2:21:29] he didn't care for any man's
[2:21:31] intellectual he didn't care about the
[2:21:33] person of anybody
[2:21:35] he was a dedicated channel to god and
[2:21:37] god spoke in his folk that's all where
[2:21:40] it hurt whether it didn't work sound
[2:21:42] crazy whether it didn't sound crazy
[2:21:43] didn't make any difference to him it was
[2:21:45] god
[2:21:47] not the man and that word went forth now
[2:21:50] it becomes a seed
[2:21:51] it has to fall somewhere if god
[2:21:54] said it there's bound to be a womb
[2:21:56] somewhere for it to fall into
[2:21:58] just as he said all things are possible
[2:22:01] to them that believe
[2:22:02] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:22:04] don't doubt in your heart
[2:22:06] you can have what you saying see there's
[2:22:09] got to be somewhere that's right
[2:22:13] notice now we find that isaiah here
[2:22:17] spoke it
[2:22:18] the virgin mary as soon as the grounds
[2:22:20] has already broke up
[2:22:22] she had been a virgin she hadn't run
[2:22:24] around the grounds have been
[2:22:26] already prepared or predestinated before
[2:22:30] knowledge of god
[2:22:32] even said she's a virgin right then god
[2:22:34] knowed what her name would be
[2:22:37] for her name was on the book of life in
[2:22:39] heaven
[2:22:41] then it was vindicated
[2:22:45] man then to man saw the expression of it
[2:22:48] by the works when it was already done
[2:22:51] now we look back and say sure
[2:22:53] it was done because we see the works
[2:22:55] that was done noah's
[2:22:57] works expressed to man what his faith
[2:22:59] was in god's promise
[2:23:02] now god met noah and he said noah
[2:23:05] it's going to rain i'm going to destroy
[2:23:07] the whole earth
[2:23:08] with water not never had rain that's the
[2:23:11] impossibility
[2:23:13] well now noah god said prepare an ark at
[2:23:16] the dimensions that i'll tell you about
[2:23:18] him being a carpenter and he went to
[2:23:20] work and began to take his foot ads and
[2:23:22] everything to cut the
[2:23:23] boards and fix it up there with the
[2:23:25] of wood and put the pitch in it just
[2:23:27] like he said
[2:23:28] and do you imagine why people thought
[2:23:29] about that man
[2:23:32] they said that man is actually crazy
[2:23:35] because he says it's going to bring
[2:23:37] water out of the heavens and there's no
[2:23:39] water up there but you see noah didn't
[2:23:42] think about that
[2:23:43] his works was expressing to the people
[2:23:46] what his faith was and what god said
[2:23:48] would take place
[2:23:50] that's the reason a genuine christian
[2:23:53] separates himself from everything but
[2:23:55] the word of god
[2:23:57] no matter what the people think what
[2:23:59] anybody else says
[2:24:01] he's separated because he isn't just
[2:24:04] saying that
[2:24:05] if he is it won't be long till his work
[2:24:07] shall be made on
[2:24:08] he'll fall back and slip this way and
[2:24:10] join this and this and start
[2:24:11] you show what he is but if he's a
[2:24:14] genuine
[2:24:16] if the word of god has bedded into him
[2:24:19] then it's going to bring forth its kind
[2:24:21] you'll see that man preparing for that
[2:24:23] great hour
[2:24:24] see that's we know it in
[2:24:31] again i i hate to cut you off but
[2:24:37] i think that's pretty evident that what
[2:24:42] he's telling us
[2:24:44] see we've got to understand
[2:24:49] so much that this is spiritual
[2:24:52] food in due season that
[2:24:56] because he was a prophet
[2:24:59] a prophet is a seer so he could
[2:25:03] see out and and in
[2:25:06] seeing out by the vision he spoke
[2:25:10] what that he saw i mean
[2:25:13] that was just explained to us but when
[2:25:16] he spoke what he saw
[2:25:19] he didn't question it he just spoke what
[2:25:22] he saw
[2:25:23] so the vision that god that gave the
[2:25:26] vision
[2:25:27] already knew who the girl
[2:25:30] was he already knew that there would be
[2:25:34] somebody there to receive it
[2:25:38] you understand he said he had to prepare
[2:25:40] the ground
[2:25:42] well a lot of us in our life have had
[2:25:45] our ground prepared we've been through
[2:25:46] this we've been through that
[2:25:48] we've went through this suffering that
[2:25:50] suffering we went through seasons of
[2:25:52] doubt
[2:25:52] but i just love how he he just kind of
[2:25:56] says
[2:25:56] he says the ground has been
[2:26:00] already prepared or predestinated
[2:26:04] by the foreknowledge of god it's already
[2:26:08] prepared
[2:26:11] so
[2:26:14] i just want to see excuse me a moment
[2:26:21] so i'm so interested in
[2:26:25] my heart of
[2:26:28] the placing and
[2:26:31] the adoption of
[2:26:35] his elect lady in the hour
[2:26:38] that we live in so
[2:26:42] we begin to see as he begins to express
[2:26:46] this so he
[2:26:49] keeps we already know that we've been
[2:26:52] for we're his workmanship
[2:26:56] we're made in christ jesus under good
[2:26:58] works
[2:26:59] and that god hath predestinated
[2:27:02] or before ordained that we should walk
[2:27:05] in them
[2:27:07] so we see we see the the
[2:27:10] the program begin to unfold
[2:27:14] in other words god has the vision
[2:27:17] and and and the word and he speaks
[2:27:21] that word and it's revealed
[2:27:27] to the person that
[2:27:31] he had in his mind that would receive it
[2:27:37] so he knew you i mean that's one of the
[2:27:40] great
[2:27:40] principles that the prophet of god
[2:27:44] laid out to us because we we're going to
[2:27:47] have to have
[2:27:48] that as a solid foundation
[2:27:52] before we take the next step
[2:27:56] we have to know that he knew us
[2:28:01] that he predestinated us and that
[2:28:04] what that his vision was what that his
[2:28:08] word was
[2:28:09] it's now revealed it could only reveal
[2:28:14] to those that were predestinated to see
[2:28:16] it
[2:28:17] other people don't see it but because
[2:28:20] they don't see it it does not make it
[2:28:22] true
[2:28:25] that's why the believer what separates
[2:28:28] himself
[2:28:29] from everything but the revealed word of
[2:28:33] god
[2:28:36] so now it's revealed
[2:28:40] and i like how he used noah here
[2:28:44] if i could bring this to the point that
[2:28:47] i want to make
[2:28:49] this morning that i want to share and i
[2:28:52] want to share it with myself
[2:28:54] he said noah's works
[2:28:58] expressed to man what his faith was
[2:29:02] in god's promise
[2:29:09] now god met noah and said noah it's
[2:29:13] going
[2:29:14] to rain i'm going to destroy
[2:29:17] the whole earth with water now it had
[2:29:21] never rained
[2:29:22] that's the impossibility
[2:29:25] everything with real faith with god
[2:29:29] has that impossibility with it yes sir
[2:29:33] you know what your impossibility is
[2:29:36] it's you amen
[2:29:41] you're the impossibility i can't do this
[2:29:45] i'm no good right you're the
[2:29:48] impossibility
[2:29:50] you look at yourself you don't think i
[2:29:54] can do this
[2:29:55] i i can't do these works i can't do
[2:29:58] these things
[2:29:59] and that's why it's a beautiful message
[2:30:01] was preached called perfect strength
[2:30:03] imperfect weakness he said man's always
[2:30:06] using his excuses
[2:30:08] or he's either trying to use his ability
[2:30:10] but he doesn't understand that
[2:30:12] god's grace is sufficient
[2:30:16] for him
[2:30:20] so that's the impossibility
[2:30:24] so look at the condition we're in
[2:30:27] look at the world condition unbelief
[2:30:29] doesn't stop god
[2:30:31] they're getting more ungodly they're
[2:30:32] getting less of god they're taking god
[2:30:35] out of school
[2:30:36] they're trying to do away with any
[2:30:38] exemptions for churches
[2:30:40] they think they can make it without them
[2:30:42] the prophet of god said they
[2:30:44] don't need revelation
[2:30:49] they've got it all figured out because
[2:30:52] they've got a leader
[2:30:54] that leader just happens to be a doomed
[2:30:58] devil
[2:31:01] but think of it that was the
[2:31:04] impossibility
[2:31:07] now noah said prepare an
[2:31:10] ark of the dimensions that i tell
[2:31:14] you about and him being a carpenter
[2:31:17] he went to work
[2:31:23] that's what we've got
[2:31:27] to start coming to
[2:31:33] you know god can't do anything for you
[2:31:37] until you confess it first
[2:31:42] in other words you've got if you believe
[2:31:44] you're healed
[2:31:45] [Applause]
[2:31:46] it it isn't a secret thing
[2:31:53] you understand you you know that god's a
[2:31:56] healer
[2:31:57] so you the first step is you've got to
[2:32:00] take a step
[2:32:01] if i can say the word what i'm trying to
[2:32:03] expect is if you have a revelation
[2:32:07] there's got to be a step towards that
[2:32:10] revelation
[2:32:11] a work that proves that you believe
[2:32:16] it's going to happen
[2:32:21] now remember success and
[2:32:24] failure launch from the same spot
[2:32:32] if either for whatever place you
[2:32:35] are your next step is either going to be
[2:32:41] success or it'll be failure
[2:32:45] they both take from the same place
[2:32:49] the believer
[2:32:54] when he has a re revealed to him
[2:33:00] now the believer receives the signs
[2:33:05] they see that there is a messenger they
[2:33:07] see it coming to pass
[2:33:09] they see the lady in purple they see the
[2:33:11] plague
[2:33:12] they see the votes things they see all
[2:33:14] these things
[2:33:15] they see the cars they see everything
[2:33:18] that's transpiring
[2:33:20] and it awakes them
[2:33:24] to the promise
[2:33:28] what's promised to me what part do i
[2:33:31] play
[2:33:33] and when she comes to that point
[2:33:36] and they realizes wait i've been
[2:33:38] commissioned
[2:33:42] because this is the restoration of the
[2:33:46] faith of our fathers
[2:33:48] the faith of our fathers was the
[2:33:51] faith to act in carrying out
[2:33:56] the commission
[2:33:59] they weren't afraid to act upon it
[2:34:01] silver and gold have i none
[2:34:05] so they came up the guy bag doms
[2:34:09] peter says i don't have alms
[2:34:14] i don't have silver and gold but i do
[2:34:17] have something
[2:34:18] he confessed it
[2:34:21] because he knew that the lord told him
[2:34:23] the works that i do
[2:34:25] shall you do also so he had that
[2:34:28] faith he had the revelation
[2:34:32] but he still had to say fix your eyes
[2:34:36] upon me
[2:34:37] and perceiving the man had faith he said
[2:34:40] stand up
[2:34:41] and walk there was a
[2:34:45] work that went along
[2:34:49] with the faith in other words
[2:34:52] peter was standing in the spot
[2:34:56] where either he was going to be
[2:34:58] successful
[2:35:01] or he would fail
[2:35:06] he couldn't stand there he couldn't he's
[2:35:08] got to say wait a minute
[2:35:10] if i've got this and i've been
[2:35:13] commissioned
[2:35:14] and it's been revealed to me that the
[2:35:18] works that he did
[2:35:19] i this is what he did i saw him do it
[2:35:24] his spirit's with me i know he's present
[2:35:27] i know this is going to happen but he
[2:35:30] still had to make
[2:35:32] that step he still had to take
[2:35:36] that first step of faith he still
[2:35:39] had to start doing the works that
[2:35:42] showed that he was moving in the
[2:35:45] direction
[2:35:46] of the revelation and plan that was
[2:35:49] going to be brought to pass
[2:35:54] another if if someone is going to
[2:35:57] get well somebody's going to lay their
[2:36:01] hands on them
[2:36:03] or somebody's going to speak the word to
[2:36:06] them because faith cometh by hearing
[2:36:08] hearing by the word of god somebody has
[2:36:11] got to put the work
[2:36:13] of the word of god into action in order
[2:36:16] for it to
[2:36:17] come to pass and i thought that was just
[2:36:20] so beautiful
[2:36:24] how that he said it he says and then
[2:36:26] faith
[2:36:29] he says jesus said no man can come to me
[2:36:32] except my father draws him first
[2:36:34] and all the father hath given me will
[2:36:36] come to me
[2:36:37] no man can understand who he is
[2:36:41] or how it is
[2:36:47] except it be revealed to you
[2:36:51] by the revelation of god and then
[2:36:55] faith in that you
[2:36:58] act accordingly
[2:37:02] so i believe we've come to this place
[2:37:05] that
[2:37:06] the revelation of the
[2:37:09] hour we live in the revelation
[2:37:13] that we have a commission the revelation
[2:37:16] that
[2:37:17] we've we've come to that place
[2:37:20] in our our lives that
[2:37:26] we see where we are the world's getting
[2:37:30] dark
[2:37:31] unbelief doesn't stop god
[2:37:34] but we're that elect lady we're that
[2:37:37] called out one
[2:37:38] we're that last voice we're the ones
[2:37:40] that have the truth
[2:37:44] that now we're from the point where
[2:37:47] we've got to make that step
[2:37:51] to have the work that expresses
[2:37:56] what we believe as long as we remain on
[2:38:00] paper we're no different than any other
[2:38:03] church with any doctrine
[2:38:06] but when we understand that we have a
[2:38:09] god
[2:38:10] not our own selves but we've been
[2:38:13] predestinated
[2:38:15] foreordained we're his workmanship
[2:38:19] we've chosen us for this hour
[2:38:24] to represent
[2:38:27] and bring the past and do the works of
[2:38:30] this restoration
[2:38:32] that you're the one that he's elected
[2:38:37] to do then you'll sit down
[2:38:42] and tell your neighbor
[2:38:46] you know i've been sick for a long time
[2:38:48] but i still believe god's going to heal
[2:38:50] her he's a healer it says right here in
[2:38:52] this word
[2:38:52] i want to confess to you you keep your
[2:38:55] eyes on me
[2:38:56] because i'm going to be healed
[2:39:00] but as long as we keep that in
[2:39:04] enveloped up as long as we keep that
[2:39:08] hidden it
[2:39:11] stays a word
[2:39:15] but an action or
[2:39:18] a step of faith or a move in that
[2:39:22] direction
[2:39:23] now it starts becoming tangible
[2:39:26] and when it starts to become tangible
[2:39:29] now it can grow into its completion
[2:39:33] doesn't care how long it takes
[2:39:36] because now the word is being
[2:39:40] made flesh and so every time you see a
[2:39:44] promise
[2:39:45] you see noah knew it was going to rain
[2:39:49] so he started to work he started to do
[2:39:53] the things that showed he
[2:39:56] believed the promise is coming just like
[2:39:59] us
[2:39:59] we ought to start doing the things that
[2:40:02] show that we believe is coming
[2:40:08] if you care about people at school
[2:40:11] you tell your best friend and and it's
[2:40:14] fine with me if you have best friends
[2:40:16] that aren't christians
[2:40:18] but if they're really your best friend
[2:40:20] they're not going to remain like that
[2:40:21] long
[2:40:25] because you'll share your heart with
[2:40:27] them and you'll either
[2:40:29] move them or they'll dump you
[2:40:35] it's okay can i say it like this so you
[2:40:40] kind of get my
[2:40:41] where i'm trying to say it's worth the
[2:40:46] risk
[2:40:49] because either you're going to be
[2:40:50] successful
[2:40:53] or you're going to fail it's
[2:40:56] launches from the same point
[2:41:02] but if they're a believer they'll
[2:41:05] receive it
[2:41:07] and they'll be baptized if they're not
[2:41:10] they'll reject it and be damned
[2:41:14] but you don't move you're not moved
[2:41:18] by what's on the outside you're moved by
[2:41:20] what's on the inside
[2:41:22] you have the revelation you believe it
[2:41:25] you
[2:41:25] make the testimony you lay your hands on
[2:41:28] the sick
[2:41:29] you go to the person says i believe
[2:41:31] god's a healer
[2:41:32] i'm going to lay my hands on you i
[2:41:34] believe you get well
[2:41:36] you've got to have the work of your
[2:41:38] faith
[2:41:41] if they believe it and they receive it
[2:41:44] they'll rise up
[2:41:45] if they don't don't stop you
[2:41:51] unbelief doesn't stop god it don't stop
[2:41:55] your work it doesn't stop your testimony
[2:41:57] it doesn't stop what you stand for
[2:42:00] it doesn't stop you confessing what you
[2:42:02] believe we are at the
[2:42:03] end time god sent a message to guide us
[2:42:06] out of here
[2:42:09] we believe it moses went down with a
[2:42:13] stick in his hand
[2:42:20] he's had the burning bush god told them
[2:42:24] everything but moses still had to load
[2:42:28] his wife on the donkey
[2:42:30] and head to egypt with the stick
[2:42:35] this is what the
[2:42:39] the messenger says he says moses took
[2:42:43] his stick and went down there
[2:42:47] and took that nation out of a nation
[2:42:50] and he come with a stick in his hand and
[2:42:53] told pharaoh
[2:42:54] let them go
[2:42:57] pharaoh seen in moses the works
[2:43:02] that he had faith in what he
[2:43:06] was going to do or try to do
[2:43:10] he had faith in the promise of god
[2:43:15] that made the promise he went down there
[2:43:19] in the promise of god
[2:43:25] of god that he made the promise
[2:43:29] he went down to take it over
[2:43:34] can you imagine him but moses
[2:43:38] had to take the stick he had to take the
[2:43:41] step of faith
[2:43:42] he had to stand in front of pharaoh
[2:43:47] and say let my people go
[2:43:51] he threw a stick down they called it a
[2:43:55] cheap
[2:43:56] trick see there he was
[2:43:59] standing at the same place
[2:44:02] of success or failure
[2:44:06] but he believed what god said
[2:44:09] moses dick ate him up he said let my
[2:44:13] people go
[2:44:14] but it was the work it was moses coming
[2:44:18] in there with a stick that pharaoh knew
[2:44:21] that this guy believes what he's saying
[2:44:26] what do you believe
[2:44:31] in other words do what does our actions
[2:44:35] and our works express
[2:44:38] if someone you know and you know in this
[2:44:41] condition
[2:44:42] you are going to die or in this
[2:44:46] condition you're going to be
[2:44:47] lost and you have that truth
[2:44:51] in that revelation and you have that
[2:44:54] love of god moving in your heart
[2:44:57] isn't there something that stirs within
[2:45:00] you
[2:45:02] that i've got the faith of my fathers
[2:45:08] you're not obligated to how they receive
[2:45:11] it
[2:45:12] you're only obligated to do the work
[2:45:15] of your faith
[2:45:21] but if fear of failure amen
[2:45:25] or fear of rejection or fear of reproach
[2:45:30] stops you from telling someone god's a
[2:45:33] healer
[2:45:34] to talking to somebody about a being
[2:45:37] delivered
[2:45:38] from drugs about testifying about the
[2:45:40] things
[2:45:41] if the fear of failure stops you
[2:45:47] then you have no work
[2:45:52] and you've got to have a work
[2:45:56] that expresses your faith
[2:46:00] because god's called you
[2:46:04] so he's given us the revelation
[2:46:08] he's given us the signs
[2:46:12] to tell us it's time we move towards the
[2:46:16] works
[2:46:21] you say i don't we're not saying no
[2:46:24] we're not saved by works there's works
[2:46:27] that are for
[2:46:28] ordained that we should walk in
[2:46:32] that's what i'm saying you've got to
[2:46:35] find what those works are
[2:46:39] that you've been for ordained to walk in
[2:46:42] the
[2:46:43] hour the signs point to the fact
[2:46:47] now is the hour and the time
[2:46:52] that i've got to find out what is my
[2:46:55] place in the plan
[2:46:58] and what would you have me
[2:47:02] to do and unbelief
[2:47:06] doesn't stop god every work of god
[2:47:10] is right on time but
[2:47:13] and you have a part that you play
[2:47:17] if we're going to be a body of believers
[2:47:19] and represent this word
[2:47:21] every member's got to be fitted and
[2:47:23] joined together
[2:47:25] all of us have got to be about our
[2:47:27] father's business
[2:47:28] doing what it is in our heart he's the
[2:47:31] great orchestra leader
[2:47:33] he's got every instrument to play its
[2:47:35] part
[2:47:36] and we've just got to rise up and
[2:47:39] recognize now's the time
[2:47:42] that i have the great work
[2:47:46] in my life and maybe you've been on the
[2:47:49] sideline
[2:47:50] maybe you've looked at your past but let
[2:47:53] me say
[2:47:54] the blood of jesus christ cleanses you
[2:47:56] from all unrighteousness
[2:48:00] don't let your past stop you don't let
[2:48:04] anything stop you from a work
[2:48:08] that expresses your faith
[2:48:12] show me your faith without your works
[2:48:15] and i'll show you my faith by
[2:48:19] my works faith and works
[2:48:23] works hand in hand like the old in the
[2:48:26] new testament
[2:48:27] we've just come to the place where
[2:48:31] it's time for us to see the supernatural
[2:48:35] work in our myth not producing it you
[2:48:38] understand
[2:48:39] but we know it's the time of it
[2:48:42] because we've seen the signs of it we've
[2:48:45] seen the positioning of it
[2:48:47] we've seen the place of it it isn't a
[2:48:49] workup
[2:48:50] it's a coming to pass of god's word
[2:48:54] god bless you let's stand this morning
[2:48:56] you love them this morning
[2:48:58] many of you i know have to go but
[2:49:03] we're going to have a little baptism at
[2:49:05] this time so if the brothers would go
[2:49:08] prepare the pool and
[2:49:11] uh get ready for the baptism and
[2:49:14] we're going to baptize uh sister lily
[2:49:17] stefan this morning
[2:49:19] uh and it is really a wonderful
[2:49:22] testimony
[2:49:24] uh he's just how that the lord came to
[2:49:27] her and
[2:49:28] she had three dreams and and
[2:49:31] in and she dreamed to be baptized and
[2:49:34] in one of the dreams she said that i
[2:49:36] baptized her and
[2:49:38] and it just seems like that's coming to
[2:49:40] pass so
[2:49:41] i i love to see god you know we've got
[2:49:44] to the place where
[2:49:45] if someone says they have a dream the
[2:49:46] first thing we don't believe that
[2:49:50] you're young you know god's going to
[2:49:52] start moving supernaturally
[2:49:55] amen prepare your heart for faith
[2:49:57] brother steve are you here and
[2:50:01] all things are possible church let's
[2:50:04] believe for the supernatural
[2:50:06] and and as we go to do this baptism this
[2:50:09] morning if you have to leave don't feel
[2:50:11] bad
[2:50:12] about leaving maybe you have work or
[2:50:14] you're hungry
[2:50:15] or whatever it is but if you'd like to
[2:50:17] stay and enjoy the baptism
[2:50:19] just feel free to stay so god richly
[2:50:22] bless you this morning
[2:50:26] and then i guess we'll let's just say a
[2:50:28] prayer before we go father
[2:50:30] we just ask that you let this word sink
[2:50:32] into the heart of
[2:50:34] each believer may they get along with
[2:50:38] you
[2:50:38] and understand that you predestinated
[2:50:41] them to this hour you've given the
[2:50:44] revelation
[2:50:46] and that you have a expression
[2:50:49] of that revelation
[2:50:53] that they are to show this world
[2:50:56] by the work that you before
[2:51:00] ordained that they should walk in
[2:51:03] father i just pray in my heart that
[2:51:06] every believer here can catch
[2:51:10] that they're a light and no man lighted
[2:51:14] the candle and set it on the hill
[2:51:18] under a basket but they set it on
[2:51:22] a hill that their good works
[2:51:25] might glorify the father in heaven
[2:51:28] i just ask that you grant it and you
[2:51:31] stir
[2:51:32] every heart in here that maybe he's just
[2:51:35] been sitting on the sideline or
[2:51:38] hasn't known their position or their
[2:51:40] place
[2:51:41] father may they rise up and say
[2:51:44] here is your handmaiden here is your
[2:51:48] servant lord
[2:51:49] be it done unto me according to thy will
[2:51:52] i'll bring forth that word in my flesh

[2:57:52] [Music]
[2:58:02] here
[2:58:04] [Music]
[2:58:16] thee
[2:58:21] amen i think they can be seated if you
[2:58:24] would like
[2:58:25] i think you can see on the screen if not
[2:58:28] if you can't you're
[2:58:29] welcome to stand up hi i
[2:58:33] left my glasses so i'm going to read
[2:58:35] this by memory
[2:58:37] the best i can but you know
[2:58:44] when lily
[2:58:47] came to talk to me there was just such a
[2:58:50] sweet presence
[2:58:53] and such a sweet desire
[2:58:56] that and her testimony of how that she
[2:58:59] dreamed
[2:59:01] that she was to be baptized not just one
[2:59:04] dream but three dreams and
[2:59:07] it really let me know that
[2:59:10] this was the lord moving upon her heart
[2:59:15] and i don't know if you've ever got to
[2:59:17] meet her or talk to her much i know
[2:59:19] she's
[2:59:21] in one way shy but in another way just
[2:59:25] has just such a wonderful spirit but
[2:59:28] she's just such a lovely person
[2:59:31] and i'm really excited about baptizing
[2:59:33] her
[2:59:34] this morning i just think you can have a
[2:59:36] wonderful fruitful life
[2:59:38] and and you know we never want to be
[2:59:41] baptized
[2:59:42] because somebody else got baptized or
[2:59:44] it's what all the kids are doing
[2:59:47] so i love it when the lord is just
[2:59:49] moving on each heart
[2:59:51] individually and there's an obedience
[2:59:54] to the word of god and you know it
[2:59:57] doesn't matter
[2:59:59] and this is just for us in general it
[3:00:02] doesn't matter
[3:00:03] what's on your history
[3:00:06] whenever god moves on you if you'll be
[3:00:09] obedient
[3:00:10] from that moment you will reap the fruit
[3:00:14] of that obedience and
[3:00:17] it'll lead you to repentance of your
[3:00:20] past it'll
[3:00:21] lead you into doing things that you
[3:00:24] never
[3:00:24] thought you could do because you're the
[3:00:27] impossible
[3:00:29] so obedience to the word of god's
[3:00:31] wonderful and i just feel that lily is
[3:00:33] doing this according
[3:00:35] to the obedience of god's word and that
[3:00:38] means a lot to me
[3:00:39] i hope you can all hear me
[3:00:42] now when they heard this they were
[3:00:45] pricked in their heart
[3:00:47] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[3:00:50] apostles
[3:00:51] men and brethren what shall we do
[3:00:54] then peter said unto them repent and be
[3:00:58] baptized every one of you in the name of
[3:01:01] jesus christ for the remission
[3:01:04] of sins
[3:01:10] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[3:01:12] holy ghost
[3:01:14] for the promises unto you and to your
[3:01:17] children
[3:01:18] to all them that are far off even as
[3:01:21] many
[3:01:21] as the lord our god shall call
[3:01:25] and with many other words did he testify
[3:01:29] and exhort saying save yourselves
[3:01:32] from this up toward generation and they
[3:01:35] that gladly received
[3:01:38] his words were baptized
[3:01:43] and the same day they were added unto
[3:01:46] them
[3:01:47] 3 000 souls
[3:01:51] he's still calling and you know what's
[3:01:54] so wonderful
[3:01:56] is the promise that our sister is going
[3:01:58] to receive
[3:02:00] when paul went to those people
[3:02:04] and he says have you received the holy
[3:02:06] ghost
[3:02:07] since you believe they said no we didn't
[3:02:11] know there was such
[3:02:12] do you notice the first question he
[3:02:14] asked how were you
[3:02:16] baptized because he would have known if
[3:02:18] they were
[3:02:19] baptized the promise would have been
[3:02:22] fulfilled so he re-baptized them in the
[3:02:26] name of
[3:02:26] jesus christ and they received the holy
[3:02:29] ghost
[3:02:30] so what a wonderful thing that we know
[3:02:33] the word of god is going to be fulfilled
[3:02:35] in our sister
[3:02:36] amen lily according to god's word in the
[3:02:41] great commission
[3:02:43] jesus told the disciples to go into all
[3:02:46] the world
[3:02:48] baptize them in the name of the father
[3:02:51] the son and the holy ghost and by divine
[3:02:55] revelation
[3:02:56] peter knew what that name was
[3:02:59] it was the lord jesus christ and
[3:03:01] according to the scriptures
[3:03:04] we fulfill today the word of god in your
[3:03:06] life
[3:03:07] that god has led you to this pool that
[3:03:10] he can fill
[3:03:11] all his promises in you the
[3:03:13] predestinated seed
[3:03:15] we baptize you in the name of
[3:03:18] the lord jesus christ
[3:03:38] uh i think this song is our dismissal
