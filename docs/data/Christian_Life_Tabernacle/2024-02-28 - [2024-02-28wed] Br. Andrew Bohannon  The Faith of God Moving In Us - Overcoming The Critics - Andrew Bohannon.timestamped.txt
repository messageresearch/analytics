[24:02] is it's just all just to lift up the
[24:04] name of Jesus Christ my sufficiency is
[24:08] not of myself to think anything as of
[24:10] myself but my sufficiency is of God and
[24:13] him alone it is because of him that I

[24:19] abilities in my being I
[24:23] nothing but with him and in him I can do
[24:25] all things through Christ strengthens
[24:29] him today is my
[24:32] birthday um it's the
[24:38] same I mean just just the fact that I
[24:40] can say that and I'm turned 52 today and
[24:45] most my family and people that know me
[24:48] say it's a miracle that I'm still here
[24:50] today and I'm pretty sure I'm not the
[24:52] only one that can say that and uh you
[24:55] know it's also the same day that the
[24:57] cloud the picture of the cloud was taken
[25:00] so that has a very uh personal meaning
[25:04] to me you know when it comes to the
[25:06] message and my place in it
[25:13] um yes God
[25:16] bless
[25:19] um January 16th 2006 is my new
[25:25] birthday um I met the
[25:30] Arthur um Jesus Christ himself at the
[25:34] time I was I was I I I was done with
[25:38] Christianity I was done with church I
[25:40] had studied every religion it is that I
[25:43] could come in contact with and um when
[25:46] they went left I went left and
[25:50] um after my experience in January um one
[25:55] of my first acts of repentance was the
[25:57] return to prison because I was on the
[25:59] run and while I was in prison uh 9 years
[26:03] prior to this this time I met uh brother
[26:06] Rex Taylor and uh brother Johnny Smith
[26:10] in I was in prison again before and uh
[26:14] then nine years later I I returned back
[26:16] to a
[26:18] prison and uh brother Johnny was by
[26:21] himself and he was preaching um the nine
[26:23] years before then I told him I said man
[26:26] I want what you got it was just
[26:27] something about him and brother Rex then
[26:30] you know I just saw something different
[26:33] and so and so that's that's where after
[26:36] my new new birth and I come in contact
[26:40] with the message and
[26:42] uh and I I never find error I've never
[26:47] it's never left me and and it's because
[26:50] of this message that I'm here today it's
[26:53] it's it has kept me it has kept my wife
[26:57] and I together and when when I should
[27:00] when we shouldn't be together you know
[27:02] by only by the grace of God and uh I
[27:05] just just just for a minute just my wife
[27:08] is is the kind of Christian that I want
[27:10] to be like she's the greatest person
[27:13] that I know in the world and uh
[27:17] um and so
[27:20] um I just I was born brown my last name
[27:24] was brown I was adopted um um and uh by
[27:29] my
[27:30] stepdad so I could take on the the last
[27:33] the so I could take on the letters
[27:37] hm
[27:38] um it's just the way it happened
[27:41] wouldn't um so these things that we
[27:44] learn in the I learn they so significant
[27:47] to me because I see you know the numbers
[27:49] um my dad turned 72 this year that was
[27:53] the year I was born in
[27:55] 72 um and and
[27:58] so I
[28:00] um I had a a testim I mean testimon a
[28:04] testim but I had something that came up
[28:06] on my heart that I wanted to share but
[28:09] it was because of my complexes that I
[28:12] developed um about you know I've I was
[28:16] raised a proper child my parents were
[28:18] rich I had everything you could dream of
[28:20] I had to wear shirt suit and tie to
[28:23] school every day in public school I got
[28:25] picked up by kids
[28:28] all all most of my most of my child but
[28:31] once I become got older and uh I begin
[28:34] to realize who I was then it didn't
[28:36] bother me anymore I just let him talk
[28:39] and say I still pop my collar anyway um
[28:44] um and uh and
[28:47] so uh because of that I have is hindered
[28:53] me from you know the way I worship the
[28:56] way I praise SC or telling testimonies
[28:59] and you might say wow I can imagine what
[29:02] it's like if you was really
[29:04] free but but uh you know so I have I'm
[29:09] learning to let that go and just say hey
[29:12] you can think whatever you want to think
[29:14] about me that's right I know who I am
[29:17] God made me I didn't make myself you
[29:21] know so
[29:22] um and so and I I promise God that if he
[29:26] made way for me to make it here today on
[29:29] my
[29:30] birthday um which is I was born in a
[29:33] leap year this is another leap here so
[29:36] I'm just taking a leap of faith
[29:39] by and uh and uh and uh and I told him I
[29:44] said I would tell my little testimony
[29:46] that bit on my heart if he made a way so
[29:50] I had a doctor's appointment last
[29:52] Thursday
[29:54] and they they the doctor denied he
[29:57] wanted to see me so when it came up he
[30:01] was like well what day you want and I
[30:04] thought thirsday cuz that way I ain't
[30:07] got to get up so early I get up at 3:00
[30:10] every morning it don't matter what time
[30:12] what go I go to bed but I be I get up in
[30:14] the morning at the same time but I can
[30:16] go back to sleep and take you know
[30:18] because I'll be up late so you know it's

[32:40] to him not realizing that he called me
[32:43] to tell me something like God was trying
[32:45] to tell me something so on my way from
[32:47] on my way to work every morning I
[32:49] crossed like three train track so this
[32:53] the next morning I went and I crossed
[32:56] one train track nothing I ain't think
[32:58] nothing about it I crossed the next
[32:59] train track and right when I got to it
[33:01] the lights came on and I was like wow

[33:10] just didn't stick I was like man that's
[33:12] God trying to speak but I ain't really
[33:14] so I get to the last train track and
[33:17] right when I get ready to go under the
[33:19] train track the arm start coming down
[33:22] and I went under and the car behind me
[33:25] had to stop and right then you know God
[33:29] said put them peanuts down you know we
[33:32] think you know we think like okay I
[33:35] work I sweep leaves I make peanuts
[33:39] compared to somebody that work at that

[34:14] peanuts and putting peanuts down in my
[34:17] life and and putting peanuts down here
[34:19] and peanuts here and there here and
[34:21] there down and then you know just one

[46:06] together Heavenly
[46:09] Father Lord Jesus as we stand before
[46:12] your purchased bride Lord we lord we
[46:15] know that Lord within ourselves Lord
[46:18] there's no good thing Lord and surely
[46:22] we've come because you said to come Lord
[46:25] you said come unto me all ye that are
[46:28] heavy
[46:29] laden Lord and I'll give you rest Lord
[46:32] and So based on your word of invitation
[46:34] Lord here we are each one of us
[46:37] believing that Lord it was you who spoke
[46:40] it wasn't man it wasn't our thinking but
[46:43] it was your word that drawing us to
[46:45] yourself father and as we come to you
[46:48] tonight Lord we pray that you would take
[46:51] the words Lord that you've planted in My
[46:54] Heart Lord and may you multiply it Lord
[46:57] as Only You Can Do Lord surely a man can
[47:01] do nothing but Lord in your hands Lord
[47:04] you you can do all things and so father
[47:07] we're entrusting to you by the grace of
[47:09] God that when we leave here Lord that
[47:12] you would have nourished Us by spiritual
[47:14] food that was stored up father for the
[47:17] benefit of the believer and for your
[47:20] kingdom Lord that you would be lifted up
[47:22] once again we're committing every need
[47:25] and ourselves to your great hand in
[47:27] Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord
[47:31] how many happy to be in the house of the
[47:32] Lord so good to see each one of you and
[47:36] we trust the Lord will bless you little
[47:38] thought we had on our heart I don't
[47:39] believe we'll be very long but uh we'll
[47:42] just commit ourselves to the Lord here
[47:45] and believe he has something special
[47:48] maybe if you want to turn with me we can
[47:50] open I'm going to go to Proverbs chapter
[47:53] 15 read a few scripture verses and um
[47:57] see if the Lord will help put the
[47:59] thought to your heart I can see the
[48:03] picture but it's really going to take
[48:05] God to anoint us
[48:07] together you know it's I've heard it
[48:09] said brother brandham said that Satan I
[48:11] believe it was in uh Faith versus wisdom
[48:14] he said you know Satan anoints Humanity
[48:17] to disbelieve but God anoints his
[48:20] Believers to believe the word amen and
[48:23] that great battle is Raging within us
[48:28] in Proverbs 15 we'll go to verse
[48:31] 33 we have a few scriptures we want to
[48:34] get to and um kind of bounce back and
[48:38] forth but just trust that the Lord will
[48:39] be your
[48:41] portion so there in uh Proverbs chapter
[48:46] 15 in verse 32 it says he that refuseth
[48:51] instruction def despise his own
[48:54] soul but but he that heareth reproof GTH
[48:59] understanding the fear of the Lord is
[49:02] the instruction of
[49:04] wisdom and before honor is humility amen
[49:09] amen you may have your
[49:12] seats the
[49:15] um brother brandham said in perfect
[49:17] faith I believe it was he said that
[49:19] Jesus Christ overcome by the word of God
[49:22] in humility and as the scripture says
[49:26] there that the fear of the Lord is the
[49:29] instruction of wisdom and before honor
[49:32] is humility I love the wisdom of God to
[49:36] give us what we have need of when he
[49:37] made these promises and there in chapter
[49:40] 16 we'll read a few more verses there it
[49:42] says the
[49:43] preparations of the heart in man and the
[49:47] answer of a tongue is from the
[49:51] Lord all the ways of a man are clean and
[49:55] in his own eyes but the Lord weth the
[49:59] spirits commit thy ways unto the Lord
[50:02] and thy thoughts shall be established
[50:05] the Lord hath made all things for
[50:07] himself yay even the wicked for the day
[50:10] of
[50:11] evil everyone that is proud in heart is
[50:14] in an Abomination to the Lord though
[50:17] hand join in hand he shall not go be
[50:22] unpunished by Mercy and truth and
[50:25] iniquity is purged and by the fear of
[50:29] the Lord men depart from Evil when a
[50:32] man's ways please the
[50:35] Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at
[50:39] peace with
[50:40] him you know that's that's your
[50:43] identification we're reading your
[50:47] identification this is
[50:49] wonderful amen over also in Revelations
[50:53] chapter 3 a very familiar scripture
[50:56] um we'll just read there it says behold
[50:58] I stand at the door and
[51:01] knock If any man hear my
[51:03] voice and open the door I will come in
[51:06] to him and will Su with him and he with
[51:11] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[51:14] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[51:18] also over came and him sat down with my
[51:22] father in his throne he that hath an ear
[51:25] let hear what the spirit saith unto the
[51:28] churches and one more last scripture
[51:31] I I so enjoyed this when I read it today
[51:34] in Daniel chapter
[51:40] 6 J Daniel chapter 6 is you know one of
[51:45] the things
[51:47] that just we're in this great battle and
[51:51] as Brother David was preaching you know
[51:54] he was talking this
[51:56] past weekend and I kind of listened to
[51:57] some of it today again and I was like my
[52:00] goodness it just seems like if I can
[52:02] only catch up you know sometimes you
[52:04] know you're you're just asking and
[52:06] seeking and God's been so merciful to
[52:09] open the understanding but you know he
[52:11] has what he knows what we have need of
[52:13] he knows the season that we're in and
[52:16] he's faithful and uh in Daniel uh
[52:19] chapter 6 verse1 it says and it pleased
[52:22] Darius to set over the kingdom and
[52:24] hundred
[52:25] 20
[52:27] princes which should be over the whole
[52:30] Kingdom and it's one of those things in
[52:33] in verse three it says then this Daniel
[52:36] was preferred above the presidents and
[52:39] the princes because an excellent Spirit
[52:42] was in him and the King thought to set
[52:46] him over the whole
[52:47] realm and there in um paragraph 5 it
[52:51] says this then said the men we should
[52:54] not find any occasion against Daniel
[52:58] except we find it against him concerning
[53:01] the law of his
[53:03] God you know I just thought that was
[53:06] amazing and just like our brother
[53:08] testified today he wants the same
[53:11] experience that he sees resounding out
[53:13] in you and I believe that Daniel was
[53:15] like that he was there was a testimony
[53:19] of the
[53:20] resurrected God living out in in a
[53:22] shadow through Daniel he had an Excell
[53:25] in spirit that other people looked at
[53:27] him and said you know what you know we
[53:29] we could take an occasion but you know
[53:31] what at the end of the day the the thing
[53:34] is is what you're standing for is what
[53:36] people are against it's the word of God
[53:39] right you know and a lot of times you
[53:42] know they had a accusation or they
[53:44] wanted to accuse but then at the end of
[53:47] it it's because no he had an excellent
[53:49] Spirit but it was actually his God that
[53:51] they had a problem with oh my think
[53:54] about the things that you and I stand
[53:56] for that's the big that's the big Todo
[54:00] you know you're just the target you know
[54:03] and but it's really the message that
[54:05] you're packing that they want to
[54:09] attack you know and and uh I just before
[54:12] I kind of launch out on my thought but
[54:14] you know something that was said in uh
[54:17] perfect faith that it just seems to be
[54:20] something that the Lord kind of brings
[54:22] back to me because I want it to be a
[54:24] reality and not just to me because
[54:26] something the prophet said and and I
[54:28] believe it's our possession and so if we
[54:31] just keep preaching it and believe in it
[54:33] then God will make it a reality amen but
[54:36] he says this in perfect Faith he says
[54:38] but and then this is in paragraph 67 he
[54:41] says but as long as you're doing things
[54:43] that are wrong you can't have confidence
[54:45] towards God so you see you can you'll
[54:49] automatically know that you're wrong
[54:51] you'll automatically put yourself back
[54:53] there a sinner by by knowing that you're
[54:56] wrong but when your heart condemns you
[54:58] you
[54:59] know you know you're a Believer let me
[55:03] read that one more time he says but when
[55:05] you when your heart don't condemn
[55:08] you all right you know you're a Believer
[55:11] and there's nothing between you and God
[55:14] you can ask whatever you will and know
[55:17] that it'll be given because it's the
[55:19] word that's given to you just like it
[55:22] was to those disciples now the only
[55:25] thing that you have to do then is have
[55:27] faith in what you are have faith in what
[55:30] the word says you are Jesus had faith in
[55:33] the word of God that he said what he
[55:37] said it is written of me didn't David in
[55:39] the Psalms and the
[55:41] prophets and all of them speak of him I
[55:44] am the bread of life that came from God
[55:47] out of Heaven amen I am the Tree of Life
[55:50] from the Garden of Eden I am all things
[55:54] I am that I am and he knew that with
[55:58] perfect Faith that's what we're looking
[56:00] for that substantives perfect
[56:03] faith and he was the anointed Messiah
[56:08] that the spirit of God was upon him he
[56:11] said now I in myself do nothing but it
[56:16] is my faith in God and God was in him
[56:20] the word made not the word made manifest
[56:24] and when the the word of God comes in
[56:26] you it is manif made manifest for you
[56:30] are a Believer I love this definition of
[56:33] a Believer and I really hope that this
[56:35] anchors down in our heart and it becomes
[56:38] a vision that we live by but he says a
[56:40] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[56:43] in
[56:44] you and I like that he says I like it
[56:47] when you I like to teach it where and
[56:50] how what faith really is amen that's
[56:53] what I want I want what faith really
[56:54] really is I don't want it just to be a
[56:56] concept I wanted something bubbling up
[56:59] like a fountain he said that when he
[57:01] comes he would be that rivers of living
[57:03] water pouring out of us amen surely we
[57:07] got this thing that we're
[57:09] battling but oh my there's something
[57:12] inside that can pour out by a faith of
[57:15] God that's living in US yes oh my that's
[57:19] perfect Faith a Believer is the faith of
[57:22] God that moves in you and that's what I
[57:24] want to speak to you a little bit about
[57:26] tonight is the faith of God that moves
[57:28] in you amen we want to see the faith of
[57:32] God moving in us we don't want to see
[57:34] our fears moving in us we want to see
[57:36] the faith of God moving in US surely
[57:39] we've seen what the experience and the
[57:41] product of what our fear does it brings
[57:43] things into picture just like it did
[57:45] with Abraham Abraham the things he
[57:47] feared brought it to pass so as the
[57:50] enemy is trying to anoint us with all
[57:52] these fears and complexes and doubts we
[57:54] we want to cast him out we want to put
[57:57] him behind us and take this word and put
[57:59] it in our heart and put it on our lips
[58:02] and watch the faith of God come into
[58:04] action that's the way God wants us he
[58:08] wants to take his word believe
[58:11] it expect it to come to
[58:14] pass you know Faith Masters every
[58:17] circumstance why are you in the
[58:19] circumstances you are tonight because
[58:21] there's a faith of God to come and
[58:23] master the situation
[58:25] there's no big problem or little problem
[58:29] to God he says the faith is the
[58:32] victory you have been given access to
[58:36] the kingdom by faith oh my you talk
[58:40] about a dynamite power you talk about
[58:44] this kind of love that creates faith
[58:47] that I'm a part of God's kingdom I look
[58:49] what I was I look I listen to the
[58:51] testimonies what we were some love hand
[58:55] brought us out so that it creates a
[58:57] confidence that God's going to use me
[58:59] right he ain't done with us
[59:03] yet there's more exploits for us to
[59:10] do you know just uh as my title went out
[59:15] I I also want to just talk a little
[59:18] subject about overcoming the
[59:23] critics you know one of the greatest
[59:26] enemies I got and he's my worst
[59:29] critic I look at him every day in the
[59:31] mirror right I walk with him he he talks
[59:36] to my conscience he's there ridiculing
[59:40] me he's a religious guy he'll take the
[59:43] law and try to beat me up with it he
[59:45] does the same thing with you sir so
[59:47] we're fighting a fight of faith and
[59:50] we're trying to let go of the reasoning
[59:52] power and the effect of it in our lives
[59:55] but the only thing that can break that
[59:58] and have the power of transformation
[1:00:00] rise up within us is the love of God and
[1:00:02] the faith in his word
[1:00:05] amen it's by grace through faith are we
[1:00:09] saved
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:14] my praise the
[1:00:16] Lord you know I I was thinking
[1:00:20] about what to share and how to share it
[1:00:24] on my heart and I was at my desk and I
[1:00:26] saw this little paper and I pulled it
[1:00:28] out and I have a little artist that
[1:00:30] sometimes would drop me little nuggets
[1:00:32] and it's such an inspiration you know
[1:00:34] God uses you know loved ones and friends
[1:00:37] to really encourage you you know when
[1:00:39] you feel discouraged or you're going
[1:00:41] through something difficult you know we
[1:00:44] have a way to encourage one another you
[1:00:47] know you're the you're the Difference
[1:00:50] Maker for
[1:00:51] somebody you know the enemy is trying to
[1:00:53] get you so so caught up and me so caught
[1:00:56] up in our daytoday woe is me that we
[1:00:59] can't encourage somebody else but God
[1:01:01] wants to use us he wants to use our
[1:01:05] heart that pulsates with the love of God
[1:01:08] with the faith of God but Oh my he wants
[1:01:11] to keep us looking down down down but oh
[1:01:16] my you know and it's
[1:01:19] um I don't know exactly where she got it
[1:01:22] from but you know it's true and this is
[1:01:26] a little drawing and a little artwork
[1:01:29] but it says wisdom and discouragement
[1:01:33] come from the same
[1:01:36] Fountain words are like a snowflake on
[1:01:39] the beach gone before you know that they
[1:01:42] were there but they leave a permanent
[1:01:45] Mark who you say them to so truly think
[1:01:50] before you
[1:01:52] speak you know I think of the the
[1:01:54] scripture that says out of the mouths of
[1:01:56] babes you know and then it just so
[1:01:59] happens that I was listening to a
[1:02:01] message called the message of the Le
[1:02:04] Sean church and it says this it says
[1:02:06] that's the way it is in my text tonight
[1:02:09] it isn't the paper that it's wrote on or
[1:02:12] it isn't the size of the text but what's
[1:02:15] wrote on it it's the word of the Living
[1:02:18] God it's so essential till all the
[1:02:22] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:02:25] but it shall never pass away see God
[1:02:28] notices every little word that we read
[1:02:31] he knows every little thought that's
[1:02:33] going through your mind every little act
[1:02:36] that we
[1:02:37] do so and I'm kindly
[1:02:41] thinking I'm kind of thinking this and
[1:02:44] many times the church in its looseness
[1:02:47] gets to going or doing things and
[1:02:50] thinking things and taking these just as
[1:02:53] they are are we ought to weigh them so
[1:02:57] what we do and say we ought to think it
[1:03:00] over before we speak it my my old
[1:03:03] southern mamy used to tell me think
[1:03:06] twice and speak once it's the little
[1:03:09] things sometimes that we leave undone
[1:03:12] that means so much to us we get into
[1:03:15] such a hurry to race over things in this
[1:03:19] neurotic age that we live in it would
[1:03:22] behoove us as the church of God tonight
[1:03:25] to stop and wait a minute and see where
[1:03:29] we're at well I thought that was great
[1:03:32] wisdom and I just was so blessed that
[1:03:34] you know it's it's part of our faith to
[1:03:37] to you know when something comes up and
[1:03:40] the battle's on and you're facing your
[1:03:43] schoolmate or someone says something I
[1:03:46] mean it's time to wait on the Lord you
[1:03:49] know we don't have to be an impulsive
[1:03:52] people you know
[1:03:55] he he told me I'll give him a piece of
[1:03:57] my mind that's like our first response
[1:04:01] but he says now why don't we think
[1:04:04] twice you know I mean let's give God his
[1:04:08] due and he says seeky first like hey if
[1:04:12] the scripture doesn't come first and
[1:04:14] that carnal mind's dropping the load on
[1:04:17] us we can we don't have to jump at his
[1:04:20] every beckoning move we can wait on the
[1:04:23] Lord we can say God what is your idea on
[1:04:26] the matter you know that takes time that
[1:04:30] takes waiting on the
[1:04:32] Lord oh but you know we we're living in
[1:04:35] such an age where there's this neurotic
[1:04:38] tensions this nervous tensions it's like
[1:04:41] hey what is your what's your thing on
[1:04:43] this right now like what you you got to
[1:04:46] have an answer now we ain't waiting you
[1:04:50] feel the Press you feel the
[1:04:52] pressure but on my we have another
[1:04:55] source you know we have an advocate with
[1:04:58] the father we can just pause and say
[1:05:01] father was that you oh I think about
[1:05:03] brother brandham when he was over there
[1:05:05] and he was going to Egypt or Palestine
[1:05:08] you know is it he knew who he was right
[1:05:11] but oh he said it's not time yet he said
[1:05:14] wait a minute they're all pulling me
[1:05:16] this way they're all come on if they see
[1:05:18] the sign of the Messiah think about
[1:05:20] where you and me would if he just would
[1:05:22] have taken that thought of somebody
[1:05:25] saying come on come on brother brandom
[1:05:27] but then God said no it's not time he
[1:05:29] said wait a minute and he went to the
[1:05:31] side and he said was that you Lord oh my
[1:05:34] what an
[1:05:35] example my we should take time
[1:05:42] amen faith is a master of every
[1:05:46] circumstance praise
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:56] you know I find that in my own Christian
[1:06:00] walk and I know that everybody who's a
[1:06:02] Christian will go through the battle and
[1:06:05] you know one thing that I take courage
[1:06:07] in is how that you know brother Brandon
[1:06:10] would make a statement and it just it
[1:06:13] changes your whole world you know when
[1:06:16] it becomes your promise when it becomes
[1:06:19] something that you know you you it's
[1:06:22] life to you right all of the sudden you
[1:06:25] know complexes you know
[1:06:29] indifferences things that they just they
[1:06:31] just don't affect you anymore you know
[1:06:34] and I believe that what's God is he's
[1:06:36] maturing us and bringing us to the place
[1:06:39] where he can reflect himself Amen in
[1:06:42] each one of our lives but you know there
[1:06:44] has to be a recognition that God is
[1:06:47] doing it in our lives and we have to
[1:06:50] yield to it we can't just keep going on
[1:06:53] and on the same way things were we have
[1:06:56] to stop yes and I think about the um
[1:07:01] situation and this is out of that same
[1:07:04] message uh the message and this is in
[1:07:06] 1958 you can put it up if you want this
[1:07:09] is uh June 9th the message to the latery
[1:07:12] and church age but he said sometime ago
[1:07:14] in the days of our Noble Abraham Lincoln
[1:07:17] it was told that there was a prisoner in
[1:07:19] the camp and he was sentenced to death
[1:07:21] for a federal crime that he had done and
[1:07:24] some good man went to ask the president
[1:07:26] he says won't you pardon this certain
[1:07:28] man and the President Lincoln as as all
[1:07:31] know him to be a Christian he's the man
[1:07:34] said sir you know the man's just a
[1:07:37] mortal soul and an immortal soul that
[1:07:39] he's going to take from his body would
[1:07:41] you take his life and he begged him for
[1:07:44] mercy and Mr Lincoln fixed he was fixing
[1:07:47] to get out of his Carriage he just wrote
[1:07:50] a little piece of
[1:07:52] paper
[1:07:55] I pardon this man Abraham
[1:07:59] Lincoln and then he he rushed back
[1:08:02] quickly to the prison cell and he said
[1:08:04] sir I have your pardon from the
[1:08:07] president of the United
[1:08:09] States and the Man rushed back quickly
[1:08:12] to the prison and said see oh and the
[1:08:14] man looked at him and he
[1:08:18] said uh if this was a real pardon it
[1:08:21] would be on a great paper with this seal
[1:08:24] and it wouldn't have it would have like
[1:08:26] gold letters and you come and that it
[1:08:29] come from the
[1:08:30] president he said why do you make fun of
[1:08:36] me and know that I am going to be shot
[1:08:40] in the mornings at Sunrise he said I'm
[1:08:44] not making fun of you sir I've got
[1:08:47] Abraham's signature on
[1:08:50] it think of it think of the battle think
[1:08:53] of what's being presented to him he says
[1:08:57] wait a
[1:08:59] minute you're making fun of
[1:09:02] me it has to be a certain way for it to
[1:09:05] be something that will bring my
[1:09:07] Deliverance my pardon my eternal life
[1:09:11] it's got to be something more than this
[1:09:15] Lord he
[1:09:18] says oh he said this is just enough for
[1:09:22] me to believe it and he refused to
[1:09:25] receive it and he was shot the next
[1:09:27] morning now there is a pardon at large
[1:09:33] wrote by Abraham Lincoln to this certain
[1:09:36] person was to be pardoned on this day
[1:09:39] and the firing squad killed him the next
[1:09:42] day and he was tried in federal court
[1:09:45] and here is the decision a pardon is not
[1:09:49] a pardon except it be received as a
[1:09:52] pardon
[1:09:54] and this is God's word that I have read
[1:09:59] just read it's a pardon to those who
[1:10:02] will accept it as a pardon it's healing
[1:10:05] to those who will accept it as healing
[1:10:08] it could be any great blessing that God
[1:10:11] has promised if we will believe it and
[1:10:14] accept it as such no matter what size it
[1:10:18] is what kind of book it's written on as
[1:10:21] long as it's God's eternal etal word
[1:10:25] amen I love that oh my and this is a
[1:10:29] very strange thing when when a man's
[1:10:32] knocking at the door to be in the
[1:10:36] scriptures he
[1:10:38] says I just forget the artist names who
[1:10:41] painted it the famous picture of Jesus
[1:10:44] knocking at the
[1:10:47] door he says I can't call his name and I
[1:10:51] was interested so I looked and his name
[1:10:53] was William uh Holman hunt and it's a
[1:10:57] very interesting I don't know how many
[1:10:59] have seen it but he's standing there
[1:11:01] knocking on the door and he's you know
[1:11:04] leaning in and oh my just it's
[1:11:08] amazing but he says this he says um
[1:11:15] now he says all great pictures before
[1:11:19] they can be hung in the Hall of Fame
[1:11:22] they have to go through the hall of
[1:11:23] critic first and then it just reminds me
[1:11:28] of the church before the church can ever
[1:11:31] be taken to Glory it has to go through
[1:11:34] the world this world of
[1:11:37] criticisms
[1:11:38] criticism and sometimes we try to Sher
[1:11:41] and pull back from criticism well that's
[1:11:45] only testing it's the golden nuggets to
[1:11:48] you it's something that God has
[1:11:50] permitted you to to try you to to bring
[1:11:53] you through a
[1:11:56] 100% pure shining
[1:11:59] gold oh my now we're talking the Hall of
[1:12:04] critics but oh my we got to go through
[1:12:07] it that's the Church of the Living God
[1:12:09] that's the hour we're
[1:12:11] in you know my says but sometimes we try
[1:12:16] to Sherk and pull back from criticism
[1:12:19] well that's only the testing
[1:12:21] amen all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:12:24] shall suffer persecution says the
[1:12:26] scripture so the criticism we welcome
[1:12:31] that because that's what we have to have
[1:12:34] to put us through the fiery trials so
[1:12:36] that this artist when the picture was
[1:12:39] going through the the Hall of critics
[1:12:41] there was one critic said sir I think
[1:12:44] the portrait of Christ is beautiful and
[1:12:47] I think standing at the door this fine
[1:12:50] anticipation of him watching and waiting
[1:12:52] that some one would open but said there
[1:12:55] was one thing wrong that is that you
[1:13:00] haven't got a a latch for him to go in
[1:13:03] at he says and the artist says oh I
[1:13:06] painted it thus my you see in this case
[1:13:12] the latch is on the inside you must do
[1:13:15] the opening Christ does the knocking and
[1:13:18] that's the way it is with every person
[1:13:20] here tonight that's seeking God for
[1:13:22] anything he is knocking at the door but
[1:13:25] you have to open up you are the one
[1:13:28] that's under
[1:13:30] control you are the in inside to O you
[1:13:35] are on the inside to open the door amen
[1:13:39] oh I love that you know you you talk
[1:13:41] about God empowering his church he's
[1:13:44] just sitting there knocking knocking
[1:13:46] knocking and he gives us so many
[1:13:49] opportunities there's so many things
[1:13:51] that we have need of oh my you can't you
[1:13:54] can't even rise in the morning without
[1:13:57] him and he's knocking every morning
[1:13:59] saying I have mercy for you this
[1:14:03] morning oh my no I'm just I'm just going
[1:14:06] through this thing I I'll work it out oh
[1:14:08] my reminds me I was thinking about the
[1:14:11] woman at the well how she when she came
[1:14:14] and she was like well you know woman
[1:14:17] bring me a drink he said she's she's
[1:14:19] looking at him like well you don't have
[1:14:22] nothing to draw with
[1:14:24] like how many times do we do that to God
[1:14:27] like you know you you don't really know
[1:14:30] and you don't have the ability to draw
[1:14:34] out of my
[1:14:37] situation oh my we
[1:14:40] criticize oh my this is
[1:14:43] another quote that he says an identified
[1:14:46] Masterpiece of God you know there and
[1:14:50] this is in paragraph
[1:14:51] 2:19 there's where he become the
[1:14:54] Masterpiece for us just remember all
[1:14:57] Masterpiece pieces before they can ever
[1:15:00] be put in the Hall of Fame they have to
[1:15:02] go through the Hall of critics first the
[1:15:05] critics has to see if they can criticize
[1:15:08] it but when it stands the criticism it's
[1:15:12] took to the Hall of Fame God's son
[1:15:15] passed through the critics of every
[1:15:18] organization
[1:15:19] denomination even till pilate said I
[1:15:23] find no fault in him Judas said I
[1:15:26] betrayed innocent blood and God raised
[1:15:29] him up and he hangs in the great Halls
[1:15:31] of Fame today at the right hand of God
[1:15:34] making
[1:15:35] intercession don't you want to join him
[1:15:38] there don't you want to be a part of
[1:15:40] that amen you can be you're invited to
[1:15:44] be while we're singing this song Don't
[1:15:47] you want to just talk it over with him
[1:15:49] and you know I was listening to you know
[1:15:53] conference with God today and you know I
[1:15:56] believe that's what God wants us to do
[1:15:58] every day and you know in every
[1:16:00] situation I believe he's knocking and
[1:16:03] and he's pleading with us you know
[1:16:05] there's so many things that try to pull
[1:16:08] our affections away from the lovely one
[1:16:12] there's so many natural carnal things
[1:16:14] that is drawing us off sides you know
[1:16:18] but oh my he's worthy of it all he's
[1:16:22] worthy to give everything that we have
[1:16:25] and give him the time I think about you
[1:16:27] know if someone was knocking at your
[1:16:30] door and all of a sudden you know you
[1:16:32] opened up the door and it was that you
[1:16:34] know famous ball player you idolize or
[1:16:37] if it was if you're in you know college
[1:16:40] and it's this awesome Professor that
[1:16:42] teaches everybody that never gets any
[1:16:44] B's or C's you know and you're like wow
[1:16:48] he's come to my house oh you would
[1:16:51] welcome him in you would say Come on
[1:16:54] come check I just got some new coffee
[1:16:56] you know or whatever you like you would
[1:16:59] if he asked you for anything in your
[1:17:01] house you'd be like please hey take it I
[1:17:04] just got a new code hey yeah you're
[1:17:05] welcome to it matter of fact we're the
[1:17:07] same take it oh my but Jesus Christ is
[1:17:10] standing there knocking and he wants to
[1:17:13] come in but see he's not like a man he
[1:17:16] actually coming because he wants to give
[1:17:18] us something he has something for us
[1:17:21] amen he has a message he wants to
[1:17:23] deliver to
[1:17:25] you amen I think that's
[1:17:33] wonderful my we got to go through the
[1:17:35] Hall of critics who who wants to be
[1:17:37] criticized nobody nobody wants to be
[1:17:40] criticized but in the criticism you know
[1:17:43] uh uh uh criticism is not always just
[1:17:46] the
[1:17:47] negative you know these people who are
[1:17:49] the the ones that go through I don't
[1:17:52] know all their responsibility but I can
[1:17:55] imagine you know they go to these uh
[1:17:57] great Galleries and they they're trained
[1:18:00] they're taught they they know like this
[1:18:02] picture it has to have this kind of
[1:18:05] rendering from this kind of artist
[1:18:07] they're trained to discern and know to
[1:18:10] criticize it to the very finest
[1:18:14] detail you know and that's just like
[1:18:17] refining gold yeah you know or looking
[1:18:20] at Gold you have to be able to discern
[1:18:23] the good and the
[1:18:25] bad oh and I thank God for what that
[1:18:28] cloud represents amen oh he when he came
[1:18:32] oh you know there's there's a great
[1:18:35] significance with that cloud he calls
[1:18:38] you he says I no longer call you church
[1:18:41] but I call you bride amen oh my that's a
[1:18:46] criticism I receive amen it's an honor
[1:18:50] God you're not just calling us Church
[1:18:52] Church you're calling us bride that's an
[1:18:55] individual Affair every single one of us
[1:18:58] it's not a church Affair it's a bride
[1:19:01] Affair you in
[1:19:04] Christ
[1:19:08] my you know the devil he knows us better
[1:19:13] than we know
[1:19:14] ourselves he knows our weaknesses he's
[1:19:17] been studying Humanity for 6,000 years
[1:19:21] and he knows what triggers
[1:19:25] us oh
[1:19:27] my but the faith of God when you truly
[1:19:31] are in fellowship with God and you know
[1:19:33] you're his you know that you were with
[1:19:36] him before the foundation of the world
[1:19:39] Amen you know that somehow God Drew you
[1:19:42] to himself and you're in his hands right
[1:19:45] when the criticism
[1:19:48] comes you know what I think it's really
[1:19:51] important sometimes to evaluate
[1:19:54] criticism based on who it comes
[1:19:57] from right you know and that's where it
[1:20:00] gets difficult sometimes when your daddy
[1:20:02] or your mommy or your best friend starts
[1:20:05] saying
[1:20:07] stuff all of a sudden we're immediately
[1:20:09] weighing out that it's the truth and you
[1:20:13] know what that can do if you accept a
[1:20:15] lie as the truth you know what it will
[1:20:17] do it'll cause
[1:20:20] death that's what it did with eeve
[1:20:24] but oh my by faith we
[1:20:26] overcome by faith we overcome
[1:20:29] criticisms it's let every man's word be
[1:20:32] a lie and God's be true heavens and
[1:20:35] earth will pass away but this word will
[1:20:37] not
[1:20:38] fail well if our discernment and our
[1:20:42] hearts could be poured out upon the
[1:20:46] promised word yes sir when the criticism
[1:20:49] comes if hey you know what if there's
[1:20:52] things that are criticisms Love's
[1:20:53] corrective right right you know we had a
[1:20:57] little garage sale this last weekend and
[1:21:00] we were all closed up it was Saturday it
[1:21:02] was early it was like we're done garage
[1:21:04] sales are fun but only for a short
[1:21:07] season you know but a man wanted to buy
[1:21:11] this Mower and this edger thing that I
[1:21:13] had for sale and he came by and all of a
[1:21:15] sudden we got to
[1:21:17] fellowshipping and uh he was telling me
[1:21:19] and I was just blown away at this man's
[1:21:22] bir and I'm like H he you know just real
[1:21:27] real uh just seems like a a real guy but
[1:21:31] he's testifying and saying that you know
[1:21:33] he he lives in um Virginia or somewhere
[1:21:36] but uh he had been applying for a job
[1:21:40] with um I don't loed Martin I believe it
[1:21:44] was and uh he just he' been applying and
[1:21:47] he got
[1:21:48] rejected and then he put his application
[1:21:51] again and he got rejected Reed and he
[1:21:54] put his application again got rejected
[1:21:56] well this had been going on for 12 years
[1:21:58] every year he was putting in his
[1:22:01] application putting in his application
[1:22:04] why is that why do you think someone
[1:22:06] would do
[1:22:08] that he he's an engineer he knows he's
[1:22:11] an engineer right he knows that he was
[1:22:14] made for a job he knows that he's needed
[1:22:17] there he was created to do that
[1:22:21] job oh and and as he's talking to me I'm
[1:22:23] just blown away like h i mean this is
[1:22:27] the kind of potentials that a Believer
[1:22:29] is supposed to have I'm a Son of God I'm
[1:22:32] a Believer my identification is that God
[1:22:35] his faith will live in me in you and
[1:22:38] here he is I just there's something in
[1:22:40] him no matter the rejection no matter
[1:22:43] how many times he was turned down and
[1:22:45] you know what he said every time he went
[1:22:47] they said well he's like well how did
[1:22:49] the interview go he's like well this
[1:22:50] this and this and it was all criticism
[1:22:52] he says so thank you thank you and then
[1:22:55] he said I'm going to go work on it I
[1:22:57] mean just
[1:22:58] simple so I don't need that
[1:23:03] job I mean criticisms actually I believe
[1:23:07] it was even brother brandham that says
[1:23:08] criticisms do me so good if we'll let it
[1:23:13] but we're all so guarded you know I
[1:23:15] think about this uh there's these
[1:23:17] diseases in humanity where your own
[1:23:20] defenses actually fight against your own
[1:23:22] your own defenses it's a
[1:23:25] disorder you know sometimes we get so
[1:23:27] defensive it's actually destroying us it
[1:23:30] Wars against our
[1:23:33] testimony my let's just receive the
[1:23:36] instruction let's let God deal with our
[1:23:38] lives let's clean kick out the trash
[1:23:41] let's let God prepare us for that great
[1:23:44] train ride cuz it's
[1:23:51] coming
[1:23:55] yeah I'll take a minute and just tell a
[1:23:56] little testimony I here on Wednesday and
[1:24:00] Lord moved on my heart and you know
[1:24:02] that's how God does he moves on your
[1:24:05] heart with a burden you know and it
[1:24:07] could be some something very simple but
[1:24:10] I I have come to understand that a lot
[1:24:14] of times when God moves on you it's for
[1:24:17] someone
[1:24:19] else you know he can show you hey this
[1:24:21] is your job and different things but I
[1:24:24] was moved upon for my aunt and it just
[1:24:29] you know it was like a blind
[1:24:31] spot you know sometimes in life you got
[1:24:34] so many things that you can only deal
[1:24:36] with or or focus in on but this was like
[1:24:40] how many know what a blind spot
[1:24:42] is so if you don't drive or don't know
[1:24:45] anything about driving when you're
[1:24:47] driving you're looking at the road ahead
[1:24:49] of you okay you you can't be looking
[1:24:52] behind you cuz that'll cause a crash but
[1:24:54] there are things as you're looking
[1:24:56] because people are around you there's
[1:24:59] areas they call them blind spots okay so
[1:25:02] you don't know that if someone's
[1:25:04] traveling beside you in your blind spot
[1:25:07] so this was the case with my aunt you
[1:25:11] know her husband had been battling um a
[1:25:16] condition and it was started back in
[1:25:18] January and um you know we didn't really
[1:25:21] even go see her anything and I'm just
[1:25:24] you know in my heart I was just like
[1:25:26] Lord why you know I I felt I felt
[1:25:28] terrible but it was all in one moment as
[1:25:32] as we were in service it's like all of a
[1:25:34] sudden she came on my heart and I'm like
[1:25:37] my goodness we just heard two three
[1:25:40] weeks ago that her husband passed we
[1:25:42] didn't even go to the funeral or
[1:25:43] anything and I'm like how did I miss
[1:25:46] it oh my then I I you know I I came up
[1:25:50] here and I asked you know brother
[1:25:51] Matthew to to join with me in prayer you
[1:25:54] know and and I was just burdened like my
[1:25:57] goodness you know you you know then the
[1:25:59] enemy starts coming criticize what kind
[1:26:00] of Christian are you you know what kind
[1:26:03] of you know uh nephew are you you know
[1:26:07] you call you you all the
[1:26:09] criticisms you know and all of a sudden
[1:26:12] you know I just said you know what and
[1:26:14] brother Matthew prayed that the Lord
[1:26:15] would give the word that would bring the
[1:26:18] Comfort or something to that effect and
[1:26:21] you know the Lord made a away within a
[1:26:23] very short period of time I I was able
[1:26:24] to go see her on Monday and I am just
[1:26:28] astounded because just like what we're
[1:26:30] saying here tonight the faith of God
[1:26:32] that moves in you you know when you're
[1:26:35] burdened you you know that God's doing
[1:26:38] something right if we don't try to
[1:26:40] rehearse or pre-arrange I don't even
[1:26:43] remember all the stuff that was said but
[1:26:45] the fact is is that we were there and
[1:26:47] God said he would be there and here he
[1:26:50] was she at the end end of it after we
[1:26:53] prayed and said a few words she said
[1:26:56] this only confirms what I prayed for and
[1:26:59] her heart was
[1:27:01] comforted she was happy she said I'm not
[1:27:05] I'm not over the fact that I lost my
[1:27:08] husband but I now can move
[1:27:12] forward you know and that's what we want
[1:27:14] we want to be God's hand extended and
[1:27:16] that's what he wants to impart to us he
[1:27:19] wants to impart his faith in us so that
[1:27:21] it move us into action amen but we want
[1:27:25] to be humble when we move and that's
[1:27:28] what helps Master the circumstance
[1:27:34] amen I don't know how long I've been but
[1:27:37] it won't be much
[1:27:40] longer you know this is a something out
[1:27:43] of perfect Faith he says
[1:27:45] what he says we're coming now to
[1:27:49] Perfection we're coming to the
[1:27:51] perfection because the people has got to
[1:27:54] come to this in order for the Rapture
[1:27:58] and that's what's holding it away right
[1:28:02] now is waiting for the church to come
[1:28:05] into the perfect raptured Faith look for
[1:28:09] it it means that a lot of Shaving down
[1:28:12] for me it means a lot for you but
[1:28:16] together we make it by the grace of God
[1:28:19] you know I think that that was a comment
[1:28:20] that brother Bram made to Wards his
[1:28:22] closing of perfect faith and I believe
[1:28:25] that's what God is waiting for the
[1:28:26] Perfection to come and we got to be
[1:28:29] looking for it there's going to be a
[1:28:30] shaving down of some things and well I
[1:28:34] don't want to be all guarded up and
[1:28:36] defensive if I got a blemish on me God
[1:28:38] bring the iron of your word let the Holy
[1:28:41] Ghost and fire burn out some wrinkles
[1:28:43] right amen you know there ain't nothing
[1:28:45] to hold me here I mean I I say that but
[1:28:48] let my actions prove it God give the
[1:28:52] anoint my faith anoint the word that
[1:28:55] your spirit can come and energize your
[1:28:58] faith that's what we
[1:29:01] want you know and I think one of the
[1:29:04] things that we go through in the great
[1:29:06] mind battle you know is this criticism
[1:29:11] you're not
[1:29:14] worthy you're not
[1:29:16] worthy you know we when we look at
[1:29:21] ourselves as a believer a lot of times
[1:29:24] that Avenue that channel of memory just
[1:29:29] and we see it like a big old database
[1:29:32] right in front of us you know you're
[1:29:34] this you're this you're this and all of
[1:29:36] that but oh my when the message says you
[1:29:40] never did that in the first place what
[1:29:42] an identification right let that become
[1:29:45] a reality let that faith move on me when
[1:29:49] I'm facing the Goliath I don't have no
[1:29:52] bread I don't have no food but oh my
[1:29:57] when we get into the Habit you know give
[1:30:00] me this daily bread and when we can
[1:30:03] really value that when God brings us
[1:30:06] just a satisfying portion like God you
[1:30:09] spoke to me and it's such a reality I'm
[1:30:12] walking in faith believing
[1:30:14] yes my you know I think about this
[1:30:19] testimony that brother brandham gave in
[1:30:21] conferences
[1:30:22] and um he says this in paragraph 54 of
[1:30:26] conference if you want to put it up he
[1:30:28] says there was an old
[1:30:30] bum was crossing the street and he
[1:30:33] looked like he had clothes that were
[1:30:35] ragged and an old hat that was tattered
[1:30:37] and a young teenage boy and girl were
[1:30:39] coming down the street making love to
[1:30:41] each other and they wasn't noticing the
[1:30:44] poor old fella and they hit him and
[1:30:46] knocked him way back up and smashed his
[1:30:50] him besides beside of a building where
[1:30:53] the fender sideswiped him and the boy
[1:30:56] turned from the girl to see the old man
[1:30:59] and he swung sideways and was crushed
[1:31:02] him on the side of the building the
[1:31:05] emergency was called and they took him
[1:31:07] over to the hospital and the city the
[1:31:09] city hospital and they looked him over
[1:31:13] and his arms were broke his legs were
[1:31:16] broke and they thought that he was
[1:31:20] unconscious and he wasn't even hardly
[1:31:23] breathing so a bunch of doctors they
[1:31:26] thought about other others they had and
[1:31:30] they said we have to hold a little
[1:31:33] conference here now the old man is
[1:31:37] nearly 70 no doubt we know we don't know
[1:31:42] who he
[1:31:45] is now now think about this
[1:31:48] dialogue okay this is reasoning at its
[1:31:51] best and you do the same thing and so do
[1:31:53] I but these doctors are great doctors
[1:31:56] and they're they're going through the
[1:31:58] whole you know thought process and so he
[1:32:02] says
[1:32:03] now he says we don't know who he
[1:32:08] is it'll take us hours after
[1:32:14] hours of our time to operate set his
[1:32:18] bones back again and try to straighten
[1:32:21] him up
[1:32:22] and the old fella doesn't have much
[1:32:25] longer to live and the O and we've got
[1:32:29] others waiting here I just don't believe
[1:32:31] it's worthwhile to do it let's just lay
[1:32:35] him
[1:32:36] back and we won't and we it won't be too
[1:32:40] much longer and he'll be gone anyway but
[1:32:44] the old man was inde dead as they
[1:32:46] thought he was and he turned himself
[1:32:49] over and he says gentlemen
[1:32:52] I've heard every word you said he said
[1:32:55] I'm worth something he said I'm worth so
[1:32:59] much that God gave His only begotten son
[1:33:02] that I would be saved he said I've
[1:33:05] received that message some 50 years ago
[1:33:08] and as passing tracks on the street and
[1:33:11] walking from place to place trying to
[1:33:14] preach the gospel he said I'm worthy of
[1:33:18] something or God wouldn't have never
[1:33:20] saved me
[1:33:23] sure you are angels of God are here I
[1:33:27] don't care what you've done though your
[1:33:30] sins be as Scarlet they'll be white like
[1:33:32] wool though they be red like Crimson
[1:33:36] they shall be white like snow let's hold
[1:33:39] a conference each each one where you're
[1:33:42] at and ask God oh Lord am I worthy am I
[1:33:46] worth
[1:33:47] anything I'm just a little housewife I'm
[1:33:50] just a farmer I just work at a feeling
[1:33:53] station I don't care what you do but you
[1:33:56] see Lord I've been evil I've made three
[1:33:59] or four shows and fail I don't care what
[1:34:03] you've done let's hold a conference
[1:34:06] through your trial he has failed though
[1:34:10] your intellects pass away God God's got
[1:34:15] a burning bush right by the seat here
[1:34:20] tonight he's got the angel that can set
[1:34:24] your heart a
[1:34:26] flame
[1:34:28] amen I love that to think about it
[1:34:32] you're worthy because there was somebody
[1:34:34] that was worthy that paid the price oh
[1:34:38] my if we can ever identify and realize
[1:34:40] I'm a Believer because somebody loved me
[1:34:43] yes somebody thought so much of me that
[1:34:45] he died for
[1:34:47] me when we come into that great
[1:34:49] criticism you say wait a minute devil
[1:34:53] huh you you might have your opinion on
[1:34:55] the matter but I'm going to tell you a
[1:34:57] different opinion and I believe this
[1:34:59] report I'm going to refuse your
[1:35:02] report you know that's what perfect
[1:35:04] Faith does when the Devil comes with his
[1:35:07] accusation you just turn him down yes
[1:35:09] sir turn him
[1:35:14] down
[1:35:19] my praise the Lord
[1:35:23] maybe I'll just
[1:35:25] uh invite the musicians I'm going to
[1:35:27] read this last quote and try to wrap it
[1:35:29] up
[1:35:34] here you know one of the
[1:35:38] criticisms you know when Jesus came he
[1:35:40] was criticized before even his birth
[1:35:43] said you know that had to have been an
[1:35:46] illegitimate birth my he was criticized
[1:35:50] before he got here all the way up till
[1:35:52] the end and the criticism was well huh
[1:35:56] we find no fault in him my but he went
[1:35:58] through the Hall of critics and that's
[1:36:01] what we're going through and this is
[1:36:03] something that uh brother brandham said
[1:36:05] in sir we would see
[1:36:09] Jesus he said could there be anything
[1:36:13] good come out of Nazareth it is a wicked
[1:36:17] City and I think Nathan gave him the
[1:36:20] best answer or or Philip rather gave him
[1:36:23] the best answer that anyone could
[1:36:25] receive he said come and see come and
[1:36:28] see for yourself now look
[1:36:30] it we could have a sermon right there oh
[1:36:34] and that man that doesn't have the
[1:36:36] audacity to come and see
[1:36:39] himself but would stand on the sideline
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:43] criticize how do you know he says old Dr
[1:36:48] Davis that ordained me in the missionary
[1:36:51] Baptist Church One Night in a debate
[1:36:53] with an Infidel he was debating with an
[1:36:56] Infidel and there was an old boy stood
[1:36:59] in the back of the building he come up
[1:37:02] with his hair hanging down his neck
[1:37:04] carving an apple and the Infidel
[1:37:08] said what do you want he said I want to
[1:37:11] ask you a question he said what is it he
[1:37:14] says is this apple sweet or sour he was
[1:37:17] eating the
[1:37:18] apple he said I don't know says I'm not
[1:37:22] eating it and that's just what I
[1:37:25] thought and went back and sat down and
[1:37:28] that settled it
[1:37:30] amen how do you know unless you've taste
[1:37:33] and see the Bible said taste and see and
[1:37:37] the poet said taste and see that the
[1:37:38] Lord is good he is a rewarder of those
[1:37:41] that diligent seek after him not those
[1:37:44] who will stand back and criticize a few
[1:37:48] days ago I heard an article on McCall's
[1:37:50] magazine and how it was criticizing some
[1:37:53] old some of the men on the field praying
[1:37:57] for the sick I was in the city where
[1:38:00] there was an editor lived and I said
[1:38:02] these men might deserve some of that
[1:38:05] criticism especially on the money and so
[1:38:07] forth they might deserve it I'm ashamed
[1:38:10] to say it but they probably do I'm not
[1:38:13] the
[1:38:14] boss but I said I'd like to ask this to
[1:38:18] that editor if these men in their
[1:38:22] mistake are trying to get something done
[1:38:25] for God what is he doing for the kingdom
[1:38:28] of
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:31] God what is and
[1:38:36] when and then when I noticed the
[1:38:40] article that he said AA Allen wrote the
[1:38:43] book on the biting
[1:38:46] devils and so forth Allan never W wrote
[1:38:50] that book brother Allan never and if he
[1:38:54] never checked the article no better than
[1:38:56] that I wonder half of it is authentic
[1:39:00] that's
[1:39:01] right if it wasn't check no more closer
[1:39:05] than that but if someone's trying to do
[1:39:08] something and making
[1:39:10] blunders are you doing
[1:39:14] nothing then keep still on the
[1:39:18] thing they're getting Soul saved
[1:39:23] anyhow so what are they doing they're
[1:39:26] working against it see is I'd rather be
[1:39:30] found making a
[1:39:32] mistake than crying on the sidelines
[1:39:34] criticizing those who are trying to do
[1:39:37] something anyhow I certainly would see
[1:39:40] all right Philip said come and see
[1:39:43] that's the thing come and find out then
[1:39:46] pass your opinion you know and I think
[1:39:49] these are words of wisdom and I think
[1:39:51] that's we can all take from the word of
[1:39:53] God and we can apply it to our hearts
[1:39:58] amen shall We Stand and bow our
[1:40:12] heads can you play that song you are
[1:40:15] worthy of it
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:19] all
[1:40:23] you know as we prepared to turn the
[1:40:24] service over to brother Billy I I would
[1:40:27] just ask you in your heart you know if
[1:40:30] if you felt that God's dealing with you
[1:40:33] and he's been giving you faith and maybe
[1:40:36] something's battering at your faith you
[1:40:38] know because that's what he wants to do
[1:40:40] he wants to attack our faith and he
[1:40:43] wants to try to make us uneffectual for
[1:40:47] God you know there's things that he's
[1:40:50] criticized us on but the devil's been
[1:40:55] lying and you you you know you're in a
[1:41:00] battle but if you would say tonight and
[1:41:04] just by the lifting of your hand if you
[1:41:05] want to say say God let the faith of God
[1:41:10] come into
[1:41:11] me and let it make a difference on these
[1:41:14] you know I don't want a critical
[1:41:17] spirit you know if someone's criticized
[1:41:19] me let me do like the word says to do
[1:41:22] let me wait on you Lord and let me get
[1:41:25] an answer from you God bless you let's
