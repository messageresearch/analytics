[30:08] we love you
[30:34] [Music]
[30:36] we
[30:41] pray to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[30:45] amen amen
[30:49] as we're still standing
[30:53] let's take our Bibles
[30:57] the relief of the Mark chapter this in
[31:00] Mark chapter 10
[31:05] verse
[31:07] will read verse 17 to 24.
[31:15] Mark 10 17.
[31:18] only
[31:20] [Music]
[31:29] and when he was gone forth into the way
[31:33] they came running and kneeled down
[31:35] nailed to him and asked him good Master
[31:38] what shall I do that I may inherit
[31:41] eternal life
[31:47] and Jesus answered unto him why call it
[31:50] thou me good there is none good but one
[31:54] God is good that is good foreign
[32:08] thou knoweth the Commandment do not
[32:10] commit adultery do not kill do not still
[32:14] do not bear false witness defraud no
[32:17] defraud not honor thy father and thy
[32:20] mother
[32:21] [Music]
[32:23] s
[32:25] and the answer and said unto him master
[32:29] all these I have observed from my youth
[32:32] is
[32:36] if the monkey shows over
[32:39] download
[32:44] [Music]
[32:47] and Jesus Behold Him and loved him and
[32:49] said unto him one thing that lacketh go
[32:52] down go thy way sell whatsoever thou has
[32:56] and give to the poor that thou shalt
[32:59] have Treasures in Heaven and come take
[33:02] up that cross and follow me officiated
[33:11] and it was said at the saying and went
[33:15] away went away grieved for he had great
[33:18] possession
[33:21] [Music]
[33:27] did you
[33:30] and Jesus looked around about and said
[33:33] unto his disciples how hard how hardly
[33:36] shall they that have riches enter into
[33:41] the kingdom of God
[33:42] latency
[33:43] [Music]
[33:46] foreign
[33:50] [Music]
[33:55] and the disciples were astonished at his
[33:58] words but Jesus answered again and said
[34:02] unto them children how hard it is for
[34:05] them that trust in the riches to enter
[34:09] into the kingdom of God who prove with
[34:11] us we may have your seats
[34:22] I really like this portion of where
[34:26] Jesus tried to clarify his thought to
[34:30] his disciples
[34:35] because when Jesus told them that it's
[34:38] hard for them to have riches to enter
[34:40] into the kingdom of God
[34:44] the scripture says that his disciples
[34:47] were astonished
[34:49] and Jesus understood the thoughts
[34:54] and now Jesus is is giving them Clarity
[35:01] that in reality is not necessarily being
[35:04] rich which is a problem
[35:08] it's not being reached that makes it
[35:10] difficult to get into the kingdom of God
[35:15] but it's when you trust in your riches
[35:20] that's when it becomes hard to get into
[35:22] the kingdom of God
[35:25] will also take the Book of John chapter
[35:28] 1.
[35:33] John chapter 1 we'll read verse 35 to
[35:36] 39.
[35:43] [Music]
[35:47] again the next day the next day after
[35:50] John stood
[35:51] and two of his disciples
[35:57] and looking Upon Jesus he was he had
[36:00] walked and saith Behold the Lamb of God
[36:03] they do discipline a
[36:07] civilian and the two disciples heard him
[36:11] speak and they followed Jesus Jesus
[36:24] then Jesus turned and saw them following
[36:27] and said unto them what seek he they
[36:31] said unto him Rabbi which is to say
[36:35] being interpreted Master where dwelleth
[36:38] down
[36:50] then they came and saw where he dwelled
[36:53] and Abode with him that day for it was
[36:58] about the tenth hour
[37:01] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[37:04] word
[37:06] I believe we are happy to be gathering
[37:09] the house of God tonight
[37:13] yeah Sunday was a great blessing
[37:19] when Brother David asked me to speak
[37:21] tonight
[37:24] I was still thinking about the service
[37:27] on Sunday
[37:33] where we saw that our bodies and is like
[37:37] a city
[37:40] that we need to build walls to protect
[37:43] it
[37:45] and for those walls that we needed to
[37:48] have doors
[37:52] that need to needed to be shut down
[37:56] and some doors that needed to be opened
[37:59] [Music]
[38:02] and Sunday night about Sunday night
[38:06] my my daughter who's four years old
[38:09] she came she was crying out to me Oh
[38:12] Daddy my stomach hurts my stomach hurt
[38:15] the Paramount
[38:20] I told her
[38:22] close that door
[38:25] femla close that door
[38:38] she said okay Daddy I'm gonna go shut
[38:40] the door
[38:42] we prayed
[38:44] she went to sleep
[38:49] and in the morning she was really happy
[38:52] she said Daddy I'm no longer in pain I
[38:54] shut the door
[38:57] [Applause]
[39:04] and we also saw that we're living in the
[39:07] uh in the world of pressure
[39:11] that regardless of the pressure we have
[39:13] yeah that there's a place that there was
[39:17] someone
[39:20] to whom we can put our pressure
[39:25] that we can get our pressure off of us
[39:29] that it was Jesus Christ
[39:33] that in the choice of trying to get the
[39:36] pressure off
[39:38] that there was two types of people
[39:43] that every time they did wrong they were
[39:47] feelings bad sad
[39:49] they wanted to do good
[39:52] like Paul could say
[39:55] that the good that I want to do
[40:16] regardless of the wrong that they were
[40:18] doing
[40:19] they didn't care
[40:22] and I was I was still speaking on that
[40:36] I'm gonna title the choice of following
[40:39] Jesus and the reward
[40:43] the choice of following Jesus
[40:46] and the reward
[40:50] we know that in everything that we do in
[40:53] life
[40:54] we have a choice
[40:57] we have chosen tonight to be in the
[41:00] house of God
[41:02] there are some that have chosen to
[41:05] follow online
[41:08] and there are others that have chosen to
[41:11] do something outside of the word of God
[41:13] it's always a choice
[41:19] every day every time every moment we
[41:22] have to make a choice
[41:25] and a choice is a decision
[41:29] it's a decision that we take
[41:34] even when we say we have not chosen
[41:38] in reality we have chosen
[41:42] because every time we have to make a
[41:45] choice
[41:46] and every time we make a choice
[41:50] behind the choice
[41:53] there's a recompense there is a reward
[41:57] because the choice is a preference
[42:01] between two things
[42:05] or I prefer one
[42:08] and when you choose
[42:10] it's behind because behind that choice
[42:14] you are waiting for something
[42:28] and the the life is only choices
[42:34] as we saw among as we talked about the
[42:37] doors
[42:38] [Music]
[42:44] today we have all kinds of social medias
[42:47] that take uh most of our time for young
[42:50] and old it's a choice
[42:55] you have the choice to say I'm gonna
[42:57] deactivate the social media
[43:00] continue like this or you have the
[43:02] church to say I'm gonna continue
[43:05] and when you continue on that
[43:09] you you know what the recompense is
[43:14] you know what is it that you're waiting
[43:16] to gain from it it's a choice
[43:28] and tonight we want to speak on the
[43:31] choice of choosing Jesus
[43:35] because we believe it's the best choice
[43:38] that we can ever make in life
[43:43] and Jesus speaks to us about the story
[43:46] of this young man says
[43:50] this young man in in his early life
[43:53] young life was already rich
[43:59] says he had a great reputation this
[44:01] young man
[44:03] what I want to say tonight
[44:19] it was preached October 30th 1965.
[44:26] I will come back to the the extract of
[44:29] that message
[44:31] so I can bring forth my thoughts
[44:36] this young man was already rich
[44:40] he was still young in a young age
[44:45] in life
[44:49] everything that we do no devoted
[44:53] we have to be led by something
[44:57] we have to be led by someone
[45:01] even when we were babies
[45:04] the first step that we took news
[45:10] we were helped by our mothers
[45:14] who helped us take our first steps
[45:17] when we started walking
[45:22] we took the uh we were given the
[45:25] education of our father
[45:29] to show us
[45:42] we have received the education of our
[45:44] teachers
[45:47] to show us how we can live in society
[45:59] this education is no longer the best God
[46:02] don't know the government because in our
[46:05] schools now on different men
[46:10] um
[46:11] they they they
[46:13] teaching they they they're giving wrong
[46:16] information to our children
[46:21] they're giving them a lot of information
[46:23] that's against the word of God
[46:26] what is the the new Society or the
[46:29] actual Society find normal
[46:33] and they want to put it into them the
[46:36] children
[46:38] but glory be to God
[46:41] because
[46:45] if we have enough Faith
[46:48] to believe that we are saved
[46:52] we have to have enough Faith
[46:57] to believe that our family is also saved
[47:04] to keep us to help us keep our children
[47:07] in line
[47:08] to follow the word of God
[47:31] sometimes we are we are subject to the
[47:34] influence of one another
[47:44] sometimes you esteem others to be
[47:46] smarter
[47:48] his way of doing things is better that I
[47:52] would like to to do like him I would
[47:55] like to be like him
[47:59] because in us
[48:03] God has placed the desire for us to be
[48:07] led by something
[48:14] in all those things
[48:17] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:20] we see this young man
[48:23] who received the really good education
[48:28] a good religious education in one
[48:32] education it's good uh education in
[48:36] society
[48:38] he was a great manager
[48:41] he was rich
[48:45] but regardless of all this education
[48:49] regardless of all these instructions due
[48:52] to their short proven satisfy
[48:55] all those things could only satisfy the
[48:59] carnal
[49:02] flashes but we are only not built upon
[49:05] carnal flesh or focused on not that
[49:08] inside of his soul
[49:11] he realized that something was missing
[49:16] he knew that something was missing
[49:22] he was conscious that he was missing
[49:24] something
[49:27] regardless of the fact that he went to
[49:29] church
[49:33] regardless of the fact that he practiced
[49:35] the religion of his parents
[49:38] but something was missing
[49:41] something
[49:49] he knew that he could receive what he
[49:52] was missing from Jesus
[49:56] he had the the right way of approach
[49:59] that you could have he said he came
[50:02] closer to Jesus
[50:04] as we came to church tonight
[50:07] as we come closer to the message
[50:11] he went to Jesus
[50:13] good Master Cafe
[50:17] what would I do to receive what I'm
[50:20] lacking
[50:23] what do I need to do to receive eternal
[50:26] life Jesus
[50:28] Jesus knew that it was religious yes
[50:34] Jesus knew that he he was tied to the
[50:38] religion of his parents
[50:41] sometimes we'll come to church
[50:45] just because we have a friend that we
[50:48] like and that is in church
[50:51] just because we know our parents wants
[50:53] us to be in church
[50:56] just because my wife wants me to come to
[50:59] church
[51:00] just because my husband want me to come
[51:03] to church
[51:05] and we only take religion
[51:14] he was conscious that he was missing
[51:17] eternal life
[51:18] he came closer to Jesus
[51:20] good Master what would I do to inherit
[51:24] eternal life
[51:26] Jesus sent him to his religion
[51:29] oh ten commandments
[51:32] we can say tonight
[51:35] Jesus sent him to his religion
[51:38] he says oh wear long skirts
[51:42] do this do that
[51:48] he said well since my dad takes me to
[51:51] church I did all of those things
[51:55] but it wasn't sufficient
[51:59] the Bible says Jesus looked at him he
[52:03] loved them
[52:05] because it was good
[52:07] it was already good it was something
[52:10] good
[52:11] to follow that religion
[52:15] to believe that there was God behind
[52:18] that religion but if a market but you
[52:21] have to take the next step foreign
[52:46] there is something missing
[52:51] sell all that you have a distribution
[52:54] and distribute everything you have to
[52:57] the poor
[52:58] We Fear then come
[53:01] and follow me
[53:04] and that was the hard thing that was the
[53:07] hardest thing for the young man
[53:10] he looked at all the reaches he had
[53:14] passed
[53:18] reaches it's not just money
[53:21] it was just not the uh uh uh the the
[53:25] material
[53:27] privilege it's sometimes the privilege
[53:30] it is
[53:33] for the young girl it's her beauty
[53:36] it's the riches
[53:41] something that you cannot sacrifice for
[53:45] the word
[53:50] something that you esteem that you
[53:52] cannot abandon to follow the word
[53:57] everyone can know what that thing is
[54:45] sell all that you have
[54:48] deceiving
[55:01] to follow Jesus
[55:04] the foreign
[55:20] it is all
[55:22] now foreign
[55:28] now just religion won't work
[55:38] this Young Ruler here said good Master
[55:41] Suave
[55:47] now remember before I say it only
[55:52] he had been taught to walk right
[55:56] he had a good education
[56:00] he had been taught in business he was
[56:04] rich he was a ruler
[56:07] he had religion
[56:11] but it was confronted with another
[56:14] problem and problem okay
[56:18] and he was confronted and it confronts
[56:21] all of us
[56:23] eternal life
[56:27] religion doesn't give us eternal life
[56:33] religious religion is a covering
[56:39] but it doesn't give us eternal life
[56:46] and yet here and yet him taught with the
[56:50] best teachers there was
[56:54] he was yet lacking something it's a
[56:57] genomics of it and a young man knew it
[57:01] because he said vomit good Master
[57:06] what can I do to inherit eternal life
[57:14] now you you believe Jesus Is God don't
[57:18] you
[57:20] know so he knew the thoughts of the
[57:23] young man
[57:30] he
[57:41] said now in other words
[57:45] keep your religion
[57:48] he said
[57:50] [Music]
[57:52] I have did this since a boy
[57:57] like like a little boy
[58:02] my mama my papa and my priest taught me
[58:06] religion measures
[58:09] but I know in my religion
[58:14] that I still don't have eternal life
[58:18] see
[58:20] because when we choose Jesus
[58:25] the the reward that's behind
[58:29] the instructions it's not uh that is
[58:32] giving us a great
[58:34] instructions
[58:36] he's not giving us wealth in the world
[58:40] Jesus can bless you message
[58:45] but if you only trust in that blessing
[58:50] you are you are you have lost the true
[58:53] purpose
[58:55] because the objective or the goal to
[58:58] follow Jesus
[59:00] the reward that's behind us
[59:04] is it gives us
[59:07] eternal life love we are President the
[59:11] life might be after this Natural Life
[59:18] of the occasions that I had to talk to a
[59:21] few people here
[59:23] to bring to to either invite them to
[59:27] church or to speak them about God
[59:31] you you realize that people have a door
[59:34] come see
[59:36] they only feel like life only stops here
[59:39] comes in apartheid as if there's no life
[59:44] after death
[59:51] you know if we are standing here the
[59:54] both of us don't say today in the same
[59:57] thoughts
[59:58] you you will lose you will always lose
[1:00:02] because
[1:00:10] there is no life
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:14] even my me who was believing that
[1:00:17] there's a life after that if I get to
[1:00:20] the other side and there's no life
[1:00:24] I will realize there's no life
[1:00:29] there is a life
[1:00:32] and you that refuse it before you can
[1:00:35] even get there you already lost
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:53] we know that there's a life after death
[1:00:57] because the right components of the
[1:01:00] reward of following Jesus
[1:01:02] he said he gives us eternal life
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:13] religion won't produce eternal life form
[1:01:17] the forms
[1:01:20] sometimes we have forms according to
[1:01:23] message
[1:01:26] sometimes we walk like uh humble people
[1:01:29] with our head bowel
[1:01:31] it's only a form
[1:01:33] it doesn't give eternal life
[1:01:52] receive the Christ
[1:01:55] in us do not I'm in our souls and to
[1:02:00] have eternal life
[1:02:02] it says the forms
[1:02:05] Sensations
[1:02:07] you feel something
[1:02:10] sometimes I when the word is being
[1:02:12] preached we feel good we sing something
[1:02:17] sometimes when when the the worship
[1:02:21] we feel the presence of God it's good
[1:02:25] it's a good thing
[1:02:27] but it's not what he's talking about
[1:02:31] he said you can be scared
[1:02:35] and feel something
[1:02:38] crying that's good who said that
[1:02:41] Christian shouting that's good
[1:02:43] but that's true
[1:02:46] it's not it
[1:02:50] you are confronted with eternal life
[1:02:59] we are confronted with this thing come
[1:03:02] and follow me
[1:03:09] it's not the uh the wealth that we have
[1:03:34] he probably wanted to make of him a
[1:03:37] Peter so he can go preach
[1:04:00] and the Bible tells us even after he
[1:04:03] rejected
[1:04:06] he continued to
[1:04:09] Prosperity
[1:04:10] he continued to have even more riches
[1:04:13] they don't like benediction so the the
[1:04:17] the the
[1:04:18] material blessings
[1:04:21] it's not a sign that God has accepted
[1:04:24] you
[1:04:26] we are not against the blessings
[1:04:30] we are not against instructions
[1:04:34] but when you when you confide yourself
[1:04:36] or you trust in them
[1:04:40] Jesus said it's hard for you
[1:04:43] to get into the kingdom of God
[1:04:47] this young man prospered
[1:04:51] and when we follow this young man
[1:04:55] the Bible says he prospered so much
[1:05:01] that this young man who was religious
[1:05:05] he get he got to a place where his heart
[1:05:09] was hardened
[1:05:14] that this young man he had a a bad girl
[1:05:18] a poor who was called Lazarus
[1:05:21] who was at this door
[1:05:25] and he was eating up on the up top on
[1:05:29] the
[1:05:30] Upper Floor
[1:05:34] and Lazarus was feeding off of the the
[1:05:37] few things that were falling off the
[1:05:39] table
[1:05:43] that Lazarus was there eating what was
[1:05:46] the food destined to dogs
[1:05:52] and Lazarus had boil all over his body
[1:05:55] it comes
[1:05:58] and because he had nothing to buy some
[1:06:02] medicine to apply on there
[1:06:05] those dogs will come and and they will
[1:06:08] lick his womb so they can help him
[1:06:12] but this young man
[1:06:15] we will see what he became
[1:06:21] in Luke chapter 12.
[1:06:37] Luke chapter 12
[1:06:40] um
[1:06:44] verse 16 to 21.
[1:06:55] and respect and he spoke a parable unto
[1:06:58] them saying the ground of a certain rich
[1:07:01] man brought forth plentifully
[1:07:05] and he taught within himself saying what
[1:07:09] shall I do because I have no room
[1:07:11] wearing to bestow my fruits
[1:07:14] and he said this will this will will I
[1:07:18] do I will pull down my Barns and build
[1:07:22] greater and there will I bestow all my
[1:07:26] fruits and my goods and I will say to my
[1:07:29] soul soul thou has much good laid up for
[1:07:34] many years take thine ease eat drink and
[1:07:38] be merry but God said unto him thou full
[1:07:43] this night thy Soul shall be a required
[1:07:46] of thee then who shall be who shall
[1:07:49] those things be thou has provided
[1:08:08] that he didn't have enough space for him
[1:08:12] to store all his Goods
[1:08:14] he said oh my soul lay down East I have
[1:08:19] many Goods
[1:08:20] I have I trust in my goods
[1:08:24] and God said fool
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:30] your soul will be required of you
[1:08:32] tonight
[1:08:41] we can read that in Luke chapter 16.
[1:08:45] looks up it says Luke chapter 16.
[1:08:58] verse 19 we believe uh
[1:09:07] adventured
[1:09:09] there was a certain there was a certain
[1:09:12] rich man
[1:09:13] which was clothed in in purple and fine
[1:09:16] Lennon and it's the same Rich Young
[1:09:21] Ruler and finally and and subterious
[1:09:24] every day and there was a certain beggar
[1:09:26] named Lazarus which was laid at his gate
[1:09:29] full of sword
[1:09:31] and desire to be fed with the crumbs
[1:09:34] which fell from the rich men stable
[1:09:37] moreover the dogs came and licked his
[1:09:40] swords it says and he came to pass that
[1:09:43] the Beggars died and was carried by the
[1:09:46] angel into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[1:09:49] also died and was buried
[1:09:52] was buried and in hell he lifted up his
[1:09:56] eyes began to begin being in torment
[1:09:59] seeing Abraham afar off and Lazarus in
[1:10:02] his bosom and he cried and said Father
[1:10:05] Abraham have mercy upon me and send
[1:10:08] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[1:10:12] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[1:10:15] am tormented in the flame in this flame
[1:10:19] but Abraham said Son remember that thou
[1:10:23] in thy lifetime received thy good things
[1:10:27] and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
[1:10:31] he is comforted and thou are tormented
[1:10:37] and beside all this between us and you
[1:10:41] there is a great golf fix so that they
[1:10:45] which would pass from hence cannot uh
[1:10:49] you will will pass from hence and you
[1:10:53] cannot neither can they pass out to us
[1:10:56] and would come from the ends
[1:10:59] then he came then he said I pray thee
[1:11:02] therefore father that thou would have
[1:11:05] sent him to my uh father's house for I
[1:11:09] have five brethrens for he may testify
[1:11:12] unto them lest they also come into this
[1:11:17] place of Torment Abraham said unto him
[1:11:20] they have Moses and the prophets let
[1:11:25] them hear them and he said nay Father
[1:11:28] Abraham but if one went unto them from
[1:11:32] the dead they will repent
[1:11:35] and he said unto him if they would not
[1:11:38] hear Moses and the prophet neither will
[1:11:42] they be persuaded though one rose from
[1:11:45] the dead
[1:11:48] so we see the end of this young man
[1:11:56] and his faith was deter his faith was
[1:11:59] determined by the decision he made when
[1:12:02] he was alive
[1:12:03] he had the opportunity to meet God
[1:12:08] he had the opportunity to meet the world
[1:12:11] he made his choice yes sir
[1:12:15] and the choice that he made brought him
[1:12:18] to the place that he was here
[1:12:19] and when he went there
[1:12:22] it was too late
[1:13:20] that they may receive the same calling
[1:13:23] that you have received
[1:13:32] if they make a good decision
[1:13:35] they will not come where you are
[1:13:41] it's a
[1:13:45] choice that we make
[1:13:48] sure
[1:13:50] it's a it's a free moral agent uh called
[1:13:54] a choice we make
[1:13:56] a journey
[1:13:59] says God doesn't impose anything upon us
[1:14:05] God he leaves us as free moral agent we
[1:14:09] can make our own choice
[1:14:16] it's not that God has chosen because
[1:14:19] what you've accepted that you will
[1:14:22] accept
[1:14:23] that the other will not accept
[1:14:27] but it's the God who knows the end
[1:14:30] before the beginning
[1:14:34] that this when this calling will come to
[1:14:37] you then you're gonna accept it then
[1:14:41] he'll elect it is
[1:15:00] that every one of us makes
[1:15:03] and when we make the choice
[1:15:06] we know what to what is waiting to for
[1:15:09] us on the other side
[1:15:11] we know that there was another young man
[1:15:15] in Hebrews 11
[1:15:17] Hebrews 11.
[1:15:21] verse 24-25
[1:15:30] 24 to 27
[1:15:35] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:15:40] refused to be called the Sons of pharaoh
[1:15:43] the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:15:45] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:15:48] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:15:52] pleasures of sin for a season
[1:15:56] esteemed the reproach of Christ's
[1:15:59] greater riches than the treasures of
[1:16:02] Egypt in Egypt for he had respect unto
[1:16:06] the recompense of the reward
[1:16:09] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[1:16:13] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[1:16:17] seeing him who is invisible amen
[1:16:23] we see this other young man
[1:16:26] who was also Rich he had the Activision
[1:16:29] who was smart
[1:16:31] who had uh he had prospered in his life
[1:16:39] Moses can teach wisdom to the Egyptian
[1:16:42] boy is
[1:16:46] Moses was next to take the The Throne of
[1:16:50] Egypt
[1:16:52] presence and Egypt was the greatest
[1:16:55] power on Earth for that time
[1:16:59] in other words if we're talking about
[1:17:01] today
[1:17:04] Moses was predestinated to be the
[1:17:07] president of the United States
[1:17:10] he was he was more richer than the other
[1:17:13] young man
[1:17:15] he had more privilege than the other
[1:17:18] young man
[1:17:22] but when he came across the same Choice
[1:17:27] Moses considered
[1:17:30] but the knowledge of God
[1:17:33] to give himself to God to commit himself
[1:17:38] to God
[1:17:41] he considered that to be a greater
[1:17:43] privilege done everything that he had
[1:17:46] fellas
[1:17:48] Moses to make the choice for him to go
[1:17:51] and work in the mud but
[1:17:55] Moses made the choice for him to be
[1:17:58] marked or someone
[1:18:00] they they mocked him
[1:18:06] who was closest to the throne Jack said
[1:18:10] you have accepted to go and to be in the
[1:18:13] mud to accept
[1:18:15] you you accepted or you agree that the
[1:18:18] one who was yourself
[1:18:22] and beat up on you because of Jesus
[1:18:27] because of the message
[1:18:30] because of the word
[1:18:34] Moses considered that it was nothing
[1:18:40] sometimes in life
[1:18:42] in our own environment
[1:18:46] sometimes they make fun of you
[1:18:51] I remember when I was still in school
[1:18:55] there's a friend who told me it is I'll
[1:18:59] tell you something
[1:19:02] I was 17 years old he didn't ask what
[1:19:05] you said
[1:19:07] he says you know you didn't really go
[1:19:10] through youth alone
[1:19:14] you went from uh being a child to being
[1:19:17] an old man
[1:19:19] because you're thinking
[1:19:21] your way of doing things
[1:19:24] it's not like you're a young man
[1:19:27] for him it was monkey it was a way for
[1:19:30] him to mock me down there I looked at
[1:19:32] him I said glory to God
[1:19:35] you know what that means
[1:19:38] when you will have your your sadness of
[1:19:42] being young come see me I will educate
[1:19:46] you
[1:19:48] says
[1:19:54] paragraph 109.
[1:20:01] sometimes when you little boy in school
[1:20:04] that figure
[1:20:07] little boy will say bad words
[1:20:11] and they want you all to say them
[1:20:16] you little girls
[1:20:19] the little the little girls will say bad
[1:20:22] things
[1:20:24] and I want you all to say them who did
[1:20:28] no more you say no I'm a Christian
[1:20:33] Express The Gospel movie and they say
[1:20:36] and they say hey big you know
[1:20:41] they go on like that
[1:20:44] you see
[1:20:46] stand up
[1:20:49] let's say I'm glad to be that foreign
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:21:18] we see that we saw the end of the other
[1:21:21] young man
[1:21:33] because of the choice that he had to
[1:21:36] make it was hard
[1:21:39] but it was the right choice
[1:21:41] it was the best choice
[1:21:44] it was what was needed to be done the
[1:21:48] Bible tells us
[1:21:50] in Deuteronomy chapter 34 think I said
[1:21:53] five to seven
[1:21:57] that when Moses was ready to die do you
[1:22:01] remember God himself
[1:22:04] took Moses from all the people
[1:22:07] remembers of secondary so he can take
[1:22:11] care of the burial of Moses without a
[1:22:14] witness some person no one saw it
[1:22:19] no the the Bible says no one knew how
[1:22:23] Moses was buried
[1:22:25] but glory be to God
[1:22:27] as we have a prophet
[1:22:32] he saw how Moses was buried you know he
[1:22:36] tells us
[1:22:38] don't
[1:22:40] ethical country to be in a leadership
[1:22:43] paragraph 124
[1:22:46] he did dollar people he says in the
[1:22:48] Bible
[1:22:51] you know there was a rock that led that
[1:22:54] that that that went with Israel
[1:22:59] and when Moses got ready to die
[1:23:03] he stepped Upon This Rock
[1:23:07] and this rock was Jesus you remember
[1:23:12] when Jesus was talking
[1:23:14] and in Saint John chapter 6 well it said
[1:23:20] a father ate manner in the wilderness
[1:23:23] and he said
[1:23:27] my father gave you that manner
[1:23:31] and he said yes they ate manner that's
[1:23:34] right
[1:23:35] they are all and they are all everyone
[1:23:38] dead but enough powerfully continue
[1:23:41] because they wouldn't keep going on
[1:23:46] small see they were they says they were
[1:23:49] everyone dead
[1:23:51] but he said and the bread of life that
[1:23:54] came down from heaven the predict you of
[1:23:56] the from Heaven from God
[1:24:00] our Father drank from Iraq
[1:24:04] Moses smoked a rocky
[1:24:09] and they said and the water came forth
[1:24:14] he said I am that rock that was with him
[1:24:18] and look
[1:24:20] when Moses died
[1:24:24] he stepped upon that rock
[1:24:27] you know what happened
[1:24:32] the Bible says that the Angels came and
[1:24:37] got him
[1:24:38] the people of Israel
[1:24:42] they didn't know how Moses was buried
[1:24:45] remember
[1:24:46] but Moses got on the Rock
[1:24:51] and Jude 1 9 tells us
[1:24:54] that even the devil even
[1:24:59] that's the body of Moses with the angels
[1:25:03] they just said to Wikipedia but God took
[1:25:07] care of the body of Moses
[1:25:12] until many a hundred years later
[1:25:18] Moses could be seen coming forth next to
[1:25:21] uh Elijah
[1:25:24] on the Mount of transfiguration
[1:25:30] because he made the right choice
[1:25:33] because he chose Jesus
[1:25:38] and he had the reward that was needed
[1:25:43] eternal life
[1:25:45] and to follow Jesus
[1:25:48] to choose Jesus
[1:25:51] we saw the story of John the Baptist
[1:25:54] couldn't appreciate when he preached
[1:25:58] John had disciples
[1:26:03] today had disciples
[1:26:30] to get ready my second coming
[1:26:33] John who had his disciples
[1:26:38] he presented Jesus to his disciples
[1:26:44] as this message is presenting us Christ
[1:26:49] as this message is presenting to us the
[1:26:52] word God said discipline conditions
[1:26:57] when his disciples heard John say that
[1:27:00] this is the Lamb of God
[1:27:02] they didn't think about it you know
[1:27:29] what are you looking for
[1:27:31] he didn't make it says master
[1:27:34] who
[1:27:35] where do you dwell where's your Dwelling
[1:27:38] Place
[1:27:41] where is your Dwelling Place
[1:27:45] when we make a choice
[1:27:48] we have to look for
[1:27:51] we have to find a place where he's
[1:27:54] dwelling
[1:27:56] and when we find where he's dwelling
[1:27:59] consider discipline as the two Disciples
[1:28:03] of John
[1:28:05] we're gonna dwell with him at that place
[1:28:09] to abide with a means to stay there
[1:28:13] it means you're not you're not leaving
[1:28:16] that place anymore
[1:28:21] and God he abides in the message of the
[1:28:25] hour
[1:28:27] God dwells in his words
[1:28:31] and if we want to have eternal life if
[1:28:34] you don't have a fellow bushes and if we
[1:28:37] have to make the right choice tonight
[1:28:41] is to abide in the message
[1:28:51] that may this word tell us something
[1:28:53] that's hard
[1:28:58] and where do you dwell
[1:29:02] if it if he gives us courage
[1:29:05] that where do you dwell
[1:29:08] we want to dwell where he does
[1:29:11] we want to make the choice
[1:29:14] because we know
[1:29:17] but if we dwell with them
[1:29:20] that is
[1:29:23] that we will receive the reward
[1:29:27] that is behind making that choice
[1:29:31] to receive eternal life
[1:29:38] my brother my sister
[1:29:49] some have made the choice many years ago
[1:29:52] those who some had made a choice one day
[1:29:59] but one they made a choice one day and
[1:30:02] then the next day the backslided Let's
[1:30:04] do laundry
[1:30:06] and then the next day they felt like
[1:30:09] they had to make a choice again
[1:30:11] and then another day they felt like they
[1:30:13] need to go back
[1:30:19] Master where do you dwell
[1:30:26] when we go where he abides where he
[1:30:28] dwells
[1:30:30] when we when we dwell in the message
[1:30:34] when we dwell in the word
[1:30:38] that it may be Tempest
[1:30:42] that they may be tornadoes
[1:30:44] that there may be difficulties we know
[1:30:49] that when will you abide with them
[1:30:52] we'll have a recompense
[1:30:54] immensely but foreign
[1:31:02] it's not easy
[1:31:05] it's not always easy
[1:31:08] but God wants that we may abide there
[1:31:13] that we may stay there
[1:31:19] that we may maintain in the choice that
[1:31:23] we have made
[1:31:43] you don't have to continue Did we tell
[1:31:47] them
[1:31:47] I'm staying here
[1:31:57] there is a power of transformation
[1:32:02] when you are weakness regardless of who
[1:32:06] you are
[1:32:08] abide there
[1:32:11] don't be discouraged
[1:32:14] well there
[1:32:39] I
[1:32:46] have no place in the world
[1:32:53] that's the choice that we have to make
[1:32:58] that's what God is calling us to
[1:33:02] to choose Jesus
[1:33:06] the reward is certain
[1:33:09] yesterday's other things they can tell
[1:33:12] you but if you choose this we're going
[1:33:16] to give you such and such but sometimes
[1:33:19] we choose and then at the end they're
[1:33:23] not giving you what they told you to
[1:33:24] promise you
[1:33:25] but one thing is certain
[1:33:29] God has promised something
[1:33:32] he always brings it to pass
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:37] when you make the choice to choose you
[1:33:40] make the choice to follow him
[1:33:43] if you abide where he abides
[1:33:48] and Assurance he said he will give you
[1:33:51] eternal life he will do it
[1:33:54] it's not it's not depending on you
[1:33:59] what all God has asked you to do is to
[1:34:03] make the decision is to choose
[1:34:06] as soon as you choose
[1:34:09] and you choose it without your heart
[1:34:14] you said I'll follow this message to the
[1:34:16] end
