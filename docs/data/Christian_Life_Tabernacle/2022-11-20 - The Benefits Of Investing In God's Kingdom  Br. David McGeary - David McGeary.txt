pray in Jesus name amen I bless you amen Let's uh we'll just uh read maybe one scripture uh that we read this morning found in uh let me see if I can find it here found in the Matthew the sixth uh chapter and the 33rd verse Matthew 6 33. it says seek ye first in Matthews 6 33. it says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the moral shall take thought of the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen men you may be seated tonight so just a a few of us uh here tonight and uh so there was a lot of out there that decided not to invest in the kingdom and others they're not feeling well they're sick and so brother Paul wrote me and today and thanking him for the message but said his family's sick all at home and they have the flu and we know the flu is goes around and the weather changes and different things take place but so we talked about investing uh this morning the need to invest in we tried to bring it out in a way that we might catch it uh like we talked about a tank of gas and uh you you notice something uh amazing about a vehicle it'll run full speed full strength full power till it uses that last drop and then it's just cuts off and we're that way you know what I mean with everything will be thinking good but if we're not careful our tank runs out so we have to continually be investing in the kingdom of God fill in our tanks you know what I mean doing those things but we want to talk a little bit more tonight about what the kingdom of God is and the benefits of the Kingdom or we might call it the benefits of investing so there's things that come along so this is what the prophet of God said Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world so he's not talking about investing in the world he was offered the kingdom of the world so he was offered all the kingdoms if he would fall down in worship so we understood that those kingdoms were all the things that controlled the people of the Earth do you know there's a political Kingdom people that are just involved in politics and others you know a lot of us that grew up maybe in sports or or you know as young people playing sports and things like that we understand that Sports is a world you know people are influenced and controlled by Sports they did a study in Dallas Fort Worth a few years ago on productivity now I don't know how they do a a report on productivity but I think that they they studied uh lots of factories and what that they produced and they studied sales of how much was sale sold that's how they can determine productivity how many Builders are buying Lumber who's buying this who's buying that what supplies are buying restaurant supplies and everything so they they studied this great study on productivity and what they found out is that productivity in Dallas Fort Worth went down 18 percent every time the Cowboys lost really I mean why if the world the world doesn't even realize they've lost you know what I mean in their productivity is going to go down to zero but it it uh the worlds are the things that control people I believe that our messenger said that there's more spent on makeup I I think he referred to it as Max Factor or or makeup then is spent spent on medicine now that's a lot of face paint you know what I mean can you imagine that many people that are unhappy with the way that they look that they're trying to paint a different face on themselves that's miserable you know what I mean that that's misery but I remember that we let a sister to the Lord one time and and uh she she gave me her her testimony and everything she said I I makeup was such a part of my life that I didn't feel I was completely dressed until I had my makeup on you know what I mean it it that it had so much uh control that she had to go in and adjust her appearance she couldn't go out and face anybody till she put on a face that that she felt was what she wanted to look like now I I mean men didn't used to wear makeup but it's got so bad now that you go to places and I I sat in a restaurant and a guy come up to me and he had makeup on and you know I asked him I said what's the deal you know I mean what would you do if someone's going to serve your feet and get some stuff on you know what I mean and his lips are a little red I mean uh you yeah I I don't get it I'm sorry you have to bear with me I mean that's just about as whacked out as can be and he had nail polish on you know and and uh and it's because and so my boys explained it to me uh they said they they call that a metro man a metro I'm never gonna say I live in the Metroplex again I mean you understand what I'm saying so these are obvious things of the world you know what I mean worldly things that are standing out but what the world is it's Spirits right because we don't fight against we fight against powers and principalities in high places spiritual wickedness right in high places these are the kingdoms these were the things that Satan was going to have control over the population over the people that's how he ruled over the people with spirits and and through these Spirits he would actually get them to do what what he wanted him to do and by them doing what they were doing the powers that he had control over them to do what they were doing they were worshiping him and not knowing it so Satan offered all this influence and all this power to Jesus if he would worship him he offered him the kingdoms so there was more than one kingdoms and we know what a kingdom is it's a power so the kingdom of God is a power and so we were reading this he said and he said Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world it was his kingdom if it was his kingdom his delegates would fight so that's when he told pilate he says if you know if my kingdom was of the world my armies would be here to defend me but my kingdoms not of this world well how many archangels do you think had their Sworn Sword strong you don't think God's got an army remember he told the gehaza he said look around son there's more with us than there are with them and he said them skies and the hills were filled with chariots you know what I mean uh you know just think of that God's got a whirlwind he's got a pillar of fire right he came down and destroyed the whole Army of Egypt so God had armies Jesus had armies he could have beckoned all of Heaven if he wanted to but he had to make a way for you to come into the kingdom you understand he had to make an entrance for us to come into the kingdom through his blood through his sacrifice he made us away that we could come in and take be partakers of the Kingdom so what does he say so he said they would by kingdom was up by King of this world they come fight he said but my kingdom is of above see the kingdom of God is not an organization so not just the religious organization like the United States is is God's kingdom isn't the order and the power of the United States that's what the United States claims its claims that we're the greatest nation on Earth well let me tell you that's a lie the bride is the greatest most powerful Nation on the Earth remember we are not a religion we are a people that's who we are we're a people we're ordained elected chosen people so if you're part of this you're part of it you're part of a people you're fitted and joined together matched up by God to to produce a a a a body and it's not it it's not a system it it's not run by man it has a head and it has a king and our King is the Lord Jesus Christ so the kingdom of God is not it it doesn't have the laws of man the rules of man the the social structure of man it has a Heavenly structure our Heavenly structure is just the opposite of the worldly structure right the worldly structure is the more popular you can be uh the the more powerful you can be and the greater you are the more power you have are our our systems completely upside down the more humble you can be the more trite contrite you can be the more giving you can be the more lovable you can be the more power you have just the opposite there are actually two parallel universes running of the the True Vine and the false Vine remember one sold good seed and the enemy came in and sowed another seed and they grew up together so both these kingdoms are growed up together and we know by many sermons that was preached that this worldly Kingdom will try to come in and wrap its Vines around the the true fruit and deform it and I I I was just trying to think of the name of that sermon that uh brother Branham preached that he went through that in such a detail of the the deforming power of the Kingdom well it it'll deform a Son of God and a daughter of God but to those that are of the world it literally captivates him they're they're actually controlled by that spirit and and it does but so we know what the kingdom of God is he's the kingdom of God is not a system or an organization or a government he says that can make a great thing I added some description there it's the power of God that's what the kingdom is it's the power of God the holy spirit in the human life so that's what the kingdom is it's not it's not something that we're going to it's something that we possess now we have the kingdom so because you possess the kingdom now you have that that Kingdom Life takes on form in a place called heaven so we don't want to mix up where we're going with what gets us there the kingdom of God is what gets you there you've already entered in to the kingdom of God you already possess the power the same power that you possess of this Kingdom it is the life the Holy Spirit the kingdom is the holy is the power of God the holy spirit in an individual amen do you believe that so I thought tonight that we talked about investing and uh they need to invest I really encourage you to go back and listen to those sermons uh because he goes in there and explains why the Rich Young Ruler wouldn't invest now look at what Jesus offered him he offered him to become one of the Apostles just think of it yeah come on just like he called Matthew just like he called the other ones who knows I know God knows but I wonder what his name was and I wonder what his testimony would have been but he was presented the opportunity to become one of the disciples right I would say one of the Apostles that would have been something wouldn't it up just think of that if they could treat us Widow went they would have still had the 12 right I just can't imagine how it would be written differently but but he that's what it was it was offered he was offered the opportunity he says come over and join this Kingdom or what was he saying to him Jesus is looking at him he says you've done all these things now how would you like to have the power of the Resurrection how would you like to have something with you a power with you that was not just a power to make money but it was a power to have power over the enemy so that was offered to him but it had a price right to sell all that she had oh my goodness now he got thinking about his reputation he got thinking about what are they going to think well they're going to think this guy's The Fanatic he's crazy right he didn't want to build the reproach what he wanted he wanted the kingdom he wanted the power he wanted the life but he wanted to keep his social structure he wanted to have the world right and the kingdom he wanted what Jesus had but he also wanted to have what he had he wanted to bring them together and now you know Jesus looks out right after that and he says you can't serve two masters you can't serve two kingdoms you're going to have to take one right and despise the other you can't get caught in the middle so you've got to choose a kingdom you've got to choose a power the trouble with the power of the world no matter how great it is and how smart you get and how much stock you buy and how many houses you have it ain't lasting and there's certain things it can't do I don't know if any mostly some of you are old enough very few probably to remember the Shah of Iran will this leader of Iran he was he had a sickness he was ill every place he went he flew one of those great big planes that was a complete Hospital now how would you like to live like that every place you went you had to bring a hospital doctors surgeons every medicine you could think of every machine that you could think of this whole guy's life he he wanted to to stay alive he and he had he had all the money that you could think of just he could go he had everything the world was offered but yet that world couldn't do certain things so the power of the world has limitations I've read many a story you know you sit down when you don't have no money like me you know and you think well if I had a million dollars I'll tell you what I'd do amen I know what I'd do if I had a million dollars I'd give it all away let's just my problem but we all sit back and said if I had a million dollars or if I just had this or I just had that everything would be over it would all be good then go if I could just have a million dollars in the bank I'd never worry again yeah you would I I know people I I've met him at the bank over and over again they're in there asking the banker what's the balance of their account I've heard it so many times I can tell them when they come in the door Mars don't worry you got a hundred and one thousand dollars in the bank you're okay and there how much money do I have because look so what I'm trying to point out is there's certain things the world leaves Kingdom no matter how great it is or how much you've achieved in it or how much you have of it it's certain things it just can't do it so and and that's what the enemy is always trying to do sell you his kingdom oh if you get a good education I think that's a big problem in the message and with the young people that they've all been sold that they got to go to college they've got to get a degree they've got to get educated well if you put one ounce of trust in your college education you're going to fail I'm going to tell a little story on my son David he didn't go to college but one day he thought he would he didn't know really not a whole lot about computers that we knew they weren't offering computer class when he went to school the amount of days he was there we never were sure if he spent more days in school or more days out of school but whatever you know and I won't go into some of the clothing he wore to school but to any way you know we had a teenager and like any parents you know you're going to go through those years and you got a promise and you hang on to that promise you know what I mean and and you don't you're not shaken but anyway so he decided to go to a job fair so he got into the job fair and he talked and the guys are all there and so here's he's got all these guys around you know they've got uh degrees in in computer science and degrees and electrical you know Computer Engineering they've got Microsoft you know and four or five or how many Microsoft deals are there and uh they they've got you know and they're they're they've got uh uh they they write in Cobalt and they and they write and I I can't even write in English but these guys are writing in Cobalt and how many other languages are there a bunch okay so these guys are writing everything and Davey shows up you know Davey happy go lucky just walks in there hey and these guys are all in suit and ties you know what I mean and and Davey walks in well Davey don't mess around with all the guys in the interviewers he gets hooked up with the main guy that guy that owns the company and so he's just talking to him and and the guy says well what are you doing here he says Ah I just out looking around I just thought I'd see what's going on here and the guy likes David you know everybody likes David I mean that's he's got my name but I never could make a good first impression everybody when they met me they hated me and then I'd have to win them over you know he's just got that you like him so the guy says well you know what he says you go to training if you can pass the training you got a job he didn't have to interview he didn't have to do nothing he didn't have to have an education he didn't have those things because God Made A Way but I'm not against education anybody that knows me I've encouraged people to get their doctorates I've encouraged people to get their master's degree I think that if you are going to do that you ought to do it a hundred percent that you ought to get straight A's that's what I think but don't trust it it ain't it's not going to do you one good thing if God's not in it so anyway he just got a job and he was selling computer parts and so he told computer parts he knew how the computer worked and that guy closed that company or something happened he went someplace else and the guy brought him on and brought him on and he got brought on and now he's in a very good position and in helping people do computer stuff it wasn't by education it's not by power or by might it's by my spirit saith the Lord so what we're saying is that there's certain things the kingdom of the world can't do right and and and and you know especially your sisters you know what I mean and and I know there's so much fear and this is not just for you anybody else that listens to it not particular for you that are here you know this whole idea that well I better go get an education in case I don't get married well you don't make Provisions for the negative how many knows where that Spirit come from that's an ananias and virus spirit if God can't do it I'm going to have a plan oh I know that what I'm saying now is probably shaking the core value of a lot a lot of people I might as well get really put myself in jeopardy sorry if I said a woman belongs at home raising her children right ministering to her husband that's the way that it used to be right but just think this Kingdom of the world now has the homes broken up it has the families broken up it have everything but broken up now I'm not you I'm not preaching uh just like Jesus said he said that he he said that well he said it wasn't so from the beginning but because the hardness of your heart God made a provision the whole world has got so bad now that if you don't sell out to it a hundred percent it wants to make it where you won't survive but God will allow a Believer to survive in fact he promised to take care of him so let's talk just for a few minutes about the benefits of entering the kingdom of God or having the power of God in you as a believer because remember when they went to the upper room they didn't go up there to get a sensation they didn't go up there to get a uh and a blessing or an anointing so to speak but they went up there let me see if I can find this statement here I thought it was pretty powerful uh but they went up there for this he says he says here now all your Sensations as we Pentecostal people like to jump and Shout I do I believe that's right we like to speak with tongues I believe that's a gift of God the devil can impersonate anything that you can produce in that line but notice then it shows that something is wrong The Life of Christ isn't flowing through the church the way it should the body the bride it's not going through there like it should now we fought we now we finally clogged up somewhere so something's clogged us up so when they went to the upper room they didn't go for sensation and and if you're not careful the Pentecostal experience will be presented to you that it has some sort of sensation uh attached to it but that's not what they went up there for they went up there to be endued with power from on high and be connected with a source of Fellowship I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again I'll be with you even in you till the end so they went up there to make that personal Conde connection and to be endued with power or they went up there to receive the kingdom of God man now what they had in that by receiving that Kingdom they had something that the world couldn't produce if I could say this they had a whole fountain a whole storehouse of tools and and and items that that the world didn't have you can almost get anything in the world but this was greater let's just talk just for an instance for example like like Joy Davey put up first Peter one and eight I mean okay look here he says he says whom having not seen yet love in whom though now ye see him not yet believe ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory now in this Kingdom you don't have to see it's not by sight it's by what faith we don't walk by sight we walk by faith and by walking in this faith we have joy we're we're not we're not connected with what we see in fact we can look at what we see and call it as if it's not and we can look to what we don't see and call it as if it is and we're happy doing it we got a joy so by it being from The Unseen it means it's not attached to anything carnal remember that guy walked away with great sorrow because he had a lot of riches he couldn't see the kingdom Joy which would have made him more happy than all the camels in Egypt Drive he left the supernatural Joy for Colonel Joy a joy which will end there's a saying in in amongst business people you spend half your life making it you spend the other half of your life trying to hold on to it every tax scheme everything you can do any way that you can give that you don't have to give it back to the government you have a government that's just trying to get a piece of your pie and you're fighting all you can to do it the saying is it's not how much you make it's how much you can keep think of it I got a raise one time and I went to my boss I said hey I don't want that raise you don't want to raise no why not it puts me in a higher tax bracket I take home less making seven dollars an hour than I did when I made six dollars an hour just think of it there's no joy in that but there's one thing that this Kingdom power you have the power now within you to have joy and no matter what you see because your joy isn't in what you see your joy isn't in the world your joy is in him you're in another kingdom you have another source of what power this power gives you Joy that's right yes sir you got joy why are you so happy I don't know it's like a Wellspring bubbling up inside of it it just comes with it it's one of the benefits you invested you get joy you're glad you invested you talk about people that invest I talk to them all the time man I invested I could put all my oh the Dow's down three points so well I got money in there people have 401ks right well they're all depressed because they're 401ks have shrunk 12 percent because of the economy and the bad whatever's going on out there I don't care I'm happy I'm content and whatever state I'm in Arizona Texas Oklahoma it don't matter whatever condition I'm in I got joy why because if you're in this Kingdom you've got joy you've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's one of the benefits that guy he could have had Joy he could have went down the road to whistling and praising God and praising Jehovah you know going down the road I dance like David danced I praise like David prays because he had something that the kingdom offered you cannot get that joy in the world not only that you have everybody in the world after what you got you don't think so what was that scripture about the Devourer you told me you know anyway it says we don't Devour the Devourer it'll hold back the Devourer man that makes me happy Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour when you're out in that worldly Kingdom everybody's trying to eat you up when you're in here joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah amen that's just one of them how about peace Philippians 4 6 and 7. you know it's something to be at peace what's the first one you had up in there okay it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God oh my you talk about being at peace right I got a problem be careful for nothing right but I can know I can go to prayer make supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be no known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your heart and your mind through Christ Jesus oh you don't know what that means to me getting older that he's going to keep my mind amen The Whole World's afraid of Alzheimer's and some timers and and everything I I don't care you might call me crazy I may repeat myself I may tell the same story ten times in one service but he's got my mind because I'm going to keep it State on him because peace is part of what goes with being in this Kingdom the world can offer that peace you've got to be careful for everything in the world not here Hallelujah let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou hath gone amen leading straight to that Shore you got you've got peace in this Kingdom the benefit of this kingdom is joy and peace find that in the world why in the world if their baseball team they're devastated if their candidate loses they're out there going crazy they're the world's crazy over this guy called Trump I'm looking for a trump I'm looking for the Trump of God oh they said they let Trump on Twitter I don't know a believer that has Twitter I don't know a Believer that's on Facebook I don't have a Believer that's on what's the other one Instagram Instagram uh I don't know a believer One you don't need that in this Kingdom you don't need Tweeter and Twitter really all those things really be called Fiddler because it's just Satan fiddling with your mind trying to keep you in touch with the world so now I can I can tell the whole world what I'm doing I'm going to give you my profile I'm going to let you know what I ate I'm going to let you know where everyone I don't care what you ate I don't take thought for what I'll eat I don't take thought for what I wear now if you want to keep up with everybody's wearing do we have those kind of people in here how many knows what Ty had on last week come on I'm going to Tweet out to you what Ty had on I'm going to put it on my profile cookie don't you understand those things are of the world don't love the world or the things of the world can't you tell that that's something of the world that's social media no I'm not against telephones brother random use telephones I'm sure if he had text that if he was in a place you could have text him a prayer request he would have probably called you and answered you and talked to you because he knew he couldn't text anointing but he could speak it you know a lot of times if you're going to pray for somebody or say something don't text them talk to them there's anointing in your voice Faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by text what's wrong with this church tweet me out some healing right did you see me on Facebook no get rid of that junk IE you don't need it no you if you're in this other Kingdom you need it I recommend if you live in this other Kingdom and that's where you want to live and prosper then I advise you to keep connected with all the other demons oh my god well you don't need it in this Kingdom guess what I have [Applause] I've got holy unction if we would invest in this Kingdom right if if somebody got sick right we have the Holy Spirit amen that sends sends a holy unction right that makes intercession and we'll put my burden on your heart the trouble is we haven't invested enough in the kingdom of God to get into that place of Fellowship we don't spend enough time in his presence to get a message you spend enough time on your phones to Facebook to text to tweet right to waste time but we don't spend enough time in the presence of God to get under the anointing to have holy unction speak to us because that's not in this Kingdom you spend time in this worldly Kingdom you know the sisters I put all the brothers in the and I put all you sisters and just think about it not even in tune with the kingdom and how it works you know the early church they used to get burdens one for another somebody would come on their heart and they would Journey for a day or two to show up you were on my heart is there anything I can do for you what's going on and they would have Fellowship and they would have communion in the Kingdom knowing it was God that moved on them in this kingdom of God God moves on you amen you have peace knowing that you're in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck you out you have peace knowing that if he started a work in you he'd finish it you're not even shaken by your failures you want to get rid of them right so what do you do you make supplication in Philippians it gives us a piece it also gives us courage I don't want to go through life whistling in a graveyard I like what brother REM said when he started Crossing that field and that killer Bowl come up to him and look stared him down started snorting home of I wish brother Jeff was here I'd have him give you the he could he can do that bowl real good you know what I mean and snort what did he say he said I did not want to die a coward he stood there he stood there with courage and he said Mr Bull you have it right I had crossed your field you forgive me I was taking a shortcut because I had to make a sick call he wouldn't have he had courage let's just put up a couple of scriptures First Chronicles 28 and 20. and David said to Solomon his son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the Lord God even my God will be with thee how many knows where that came from let your minds work just a moment we'll be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and tell thou Hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord Joshua 1 11 1 9. have I not commanded thee be strong and of good courage and Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whersoever thou goest here's David because he's part of the Kingdom telling Solomon what God told Joshua parents tell your children the scriptures concerning things in their life share quotes with them that's how you build courage don't be afraid God's with you we're here for you the Church of the Living God's praying for you fortify them don't worry if they don't listen and they act like they're rolling their eyes you know and a little more religion don't worry you're not talked into the state they're in you're prophesying the state that they'll be we're in a different Kingdom we got courage in this Kingdom we're not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it's the power of God to Salvation I'm not ashamed of what we're saying because it leads to eternal life I got courage amen that's one of the benefits of being in this Kingdom you got courage can you imagine people that live with no courage you know what the prophet of bed said he said if you won't stand up for something you won't stand up for anything he said you had didn't have any backbone there's a lot of people that claim to be in this Kingdom that don't have any backbone if you don't have backbone if you don't have courage let me tell you ask that doubt might receive and ask abundantly just don't ask for courage to ask for the kind of Courage that uh David had discernment that's the benefit of living in this Kingdom having the what is the kingdom it's the power of God in you so we're talking about a power that gives you peace joy that gives you that gives you courage that gives you discernment let's just throw some scriptures up there first John 4 and 1. if you don't have any of these things they're yours they're part of the policy they're part of the benefit beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world oh aren't you glad you have the discernment you're not babes you can discern between Good and Evil amen you're in the kingdom of God you've got the power of God what is the power of God that's what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost isn't an anointing it's not an emotion it's not a shout it's the power of Jesus Christ the resurrection living in human flesh Glory and you got it throw up there uh first Thessalonians 5 and 21. okay you just might be a young teenager you might be going through this trouble but I'm telling you all these things are there for you prove all things hold facts to that which is good you've got the ability you've got the power to look at it and say you can I approve that thing you can actually uh look at it and say Satan appears as an angel of Light and you say no sir buddy you ain't no angel of Light you speak with forked tongue you're the father of life what you're telling me is not true how many remember Saint Martin all of a sudden he has a vision an angel appears before and starts getting monishing him and telling all these things and uplifting him and after Martin is sitting there and he says I'm your lord and Martin looked at that and the spirit was right everything was right but he had a crown on I wonder if an angel appeared in your bedroom tonight and started talking to you first I wonder if you'd have enough courage to talk back I think if an angel appeared to most Believers they'd be scared to death they wouldn't know whether it was an angel or not they wouldn't know what to do with it because they're out of fellowship with God it ought to be an everyday occurrence that God speaks to you hear ye him prophet of God said we don't hear him because we don't listen we don't give them time to speak then he looked at him he said haha I don't care how you look I don't care how sweet your words are you got a crown that's unscriptural because the Saints are going to Crown you you know what he started to say get behind me get behind me Satan victory is mine that's what he started seeing a victory is mine Victorino over Saint Mark God said I told Satan and get thee behind oh Victory today is my discernment you got him spotted a mile away you give them the what the word test you try a spirit to see whether it's God or not you know to do that I pray God that you try my spirit every Sunday but at least be fair to try your spirit also you know but just think of it in this Kingdom we've got discernment we don't have to be afraid if he appears as an angel of Light we can discern it we've got the spirit of Truth amen right isn't that what the scripture says I'll not leave you comfortable but even the spirit of truth will come and it will lead you and guide you in all truth and all righteousness the spirit of Truth don't you understand the world don't have that benefit they're out there lying to one another deceiving one another I got a car to sell you it's only got ten thousand miles on it granny kept it in the garage and it looks like it's been to a destruction Derby it's got banana peels in the transmission it I don't trust the world I don't trust what they say I don't trust what they sell because their ruler right is the spirit of Darkness Deceiver Satan is a liar he's the father of all lies and there's no truth in them The World Is A Lie the economy is false how many knows the prophet of God said America is running on a false economy guess who holds the bag Rome who do you think sits on the throne as the Vicar of Christ what is it Filius Dias Dias or something that's on his crown a Triple Crown sitting on the Hills Rome Rome runs the world don't be afraid of Communism be afraid of what romanism everything the world has to offer that has religion it's some guy in a black suit and a white collar I ain't gonna follow a guy in a Black Dress with the white collar I'm sorry I didn't see much of that in the disciples look at the Scandal that plagues the Catholic Church what is the Scandal it's Gamora Sodom and Gomorrah all through the priesthood all through the church why because it's the religion of lady osia we don't we're not worried about that we've got discernment right what's another benefit you don't have to be afraid there's a difference between courage you notice he said be courageous courageous is the ability to go forward no matter what's in front of you courageous means that that that you have the determination to stand for what you're standing for regardless of the threat you've got it how do you have it because you're in the Kingdom and that's a power that you have in the Kingdom that this world can offer you don't think it can offer you get guys that are flip-flopping on every issue because they're afraid of what the vote is they're afraid of what the trend is they don't have the courage to stand up for anything but you talk about being not afraid we're not afraid of things past that's one thing once you enter this Kingdom you don't got a past all you've got's future present and future you're not afraid of the past you're not afraid of the present and you're not afraid of the future Luke 12 32. fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the power you don't have to be afraid because you know in this Kingdom no matter what the challenge is you've got a power to overcome to him that overcometh he'll sit with me on my father's throne this is the kingdom that Jesus preached he said oh don't just Rejoice because Spirits are subject to you I saw Satan found but Rejoice because your name's written in the Lamb's Book of Life another is Rejoice because you were predestinated to receive this power from on high and be part of this kingdom do you know that you've got the power each in you everyone to go to create a world and go live on it you've got power the kingdom is power not anointing people come under the anointing and they walk out and they fall all the pieces then they get preached back under conviction they're at the author they're sobbing and booing because they're a sinner and then they get up and they shout and rejoice because they're delivered and they've got no stain power if someone returns back in the same condition it just tells me they never got the Medicine the first time you've got power of faith once he quickens it to you once he reveals it to you you can hang on to it you're not afraid you have the what the kingdom we'll just take a few more I could probably go on for a long time how about obstacles boy isn't that a Bitcoin huh let's look at mark 11. uh in 23. we get obstacles all the time we're going a certain way we want a certain thing we're trying to do better and poof Here Comes an obstacle for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in your heart but Shall Believe those things which ye shall which seems he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saith now just think in this Kingdom you have a power to move obstacles go out into the world and see if you can move obstacles you know how the world removes obstacles they compromise they make deals don't make no deals with the Devil you don't have to compromise you got the kingdom of God you've got not the kingdom not heaven not eternal life I want to move that from your mind that the kingdom of God is heaven that's the reward to all those that live in the kingdom and have the power if the same power or Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body that's why it's important to get in this Kingdom it's important to invest in this Kingdom it's important to be in this Kingdom and study to show yourself approved find out what power is allotted to you by the blood of the Lamb go up there and get endued with power from and high go into all the world preach the gospel cast out Devils Lay Your Hands on the sick that's the kingdom I want to be a part of that's the kingdom that the prophet of God came to restore the faith that our fathers had the faith in the Kingdom power that existed in them on Earth the kingdom of God is where it's within you that's right see if I well I had that scripture this morning but you know the scripture the kingdom of God come noteth in word but it is with in you it's a power within you the kingdom of God is within you how many's got that okay you've got the kingdom use it use it it's yours so you've got the the power how about sickness we all know this scripture by Heart Right Isaiah 50 I think it's Isaiah 55 15. or 53 15. give me 55. 53 5 first ah just think of that when you're in this Kingdom you have this promise you have a source of power what is the power of the word God cannot lie the power of the word is God will do what he said that's the power of the word if he said let there be light and there was no light his word was what powerless but the power of the word is the god who stands behind it to bring it to pass so when you're in this Kingdom you have this power that connects you with that word and you know that he keeps his word therefore you're a hundred percent invested by Calvary in that word sickness but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed how how evident what that word that was spoken in this Kingdom came to pass and he was bruised right he was Catholic chastising his peace was upon us he went through all those things it was prophesied he would do it and what did he do he did it how many prophecies were there of the Lord and every single one of them come to pass why because in this Kingdom the kingdom of God the power of God it comes to pass amen are we just we'll refer back to the arrow sermon right God's got an arrow every promise put an arrow in the sky to land in your life when you need it that's the benefit of the Kingdom I'm with you I'll be in you I won't forsake you I won't leave you if you ask it'll be done how many wants to trade the world for this power any takers I don't want what has it got to offer brother Billy it can't give me peace it can't give me joy it can't give me courage it can give me nothing right it's sickness you know what I mean and I love what the prophet of God told us he said if God wants you hear there's not enough sickness or devils to take you how'd you like to approach a sickness like that I'm not afraid of you sickness sickness you do not determine whether I have faith or not because I believe the word I remember I went through that trial I'll share it with you again I'll probably share it with you a hundred times more there is a sister in our church and that sister had faith real faith and I believe with all my heart that she was going to get well and I went and saw her the night before Thanksgiving and I went in to talk to her and I said sister Carol how you oh I'm doing good brother David we talked a few minutes and I said you know I believe with you sis I stand with your arm and arm and I'll never forget it I started out the door and she said wait a minute Brother David I said yes sister Carol and she looked at me and she said I really love you and it was it came from a place it wasn't any kind of I love you that I ever heard before it was like him talking Shivers went up my mind and just there was such an anointing with it and her face just glowed and I said thank you sister Carol I love you too and out I went and the next day I went up to the hospital and I said I'm looking for uh where's Karen Carol at and I looked through the room and and they said are are you family I said no I'm her pastor at they said well she passed last night and I went to the Lord I was devastated for weeks how could this be how could this be I believed With All My Heart Lord and I quoted the mountain I quoted all these things and then when I finally got it takes time to break into the presence of the Lord God is not a microwave oven they that wait upon the Lord and so I was so devastated and I sought the Lord and I sought the Lord and I and finally I got in this presence I said Lord I believed I believe with all my heart he said simply one thing to me what else could you do you're a believer I don't have the scripture written down but the scripture says believe all things what else was I going to do but believe I don't have an option I don't have an option I don't have to worry about who goes and who dies I don't have to worry about praying for the sick whether they'll get well or not I'm a Believer I'll pray for a thousand if they all drop dead I'll pray for one thousand and one whether they go or whether they don't call whether they get well or don't get well that does not affect me because if God wants to take you there's not enough doctors or medicine to keep you here it's in the hands of God not in the hands of the sickness let me say that again a person that's sick is not in the hands of the sickness they're in the hands of God and that's what I got to believe I've got one choice one thing this Kingdom allows me only one thing and that is Isaiah 53 and 5. I have no other thought on the matter he's still a Healer you say well he they took him home did he did they die foreign let's go to our last benefit death huh oh death are we afraid of death we've overcome death hell and the grave what's Corinthians First Corinthians 50 15 55 to 8. oh death where is thy stain oh grave where is thy Victory what's the next scripture The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law if you go on that's a beautiful portion of scripture if you want to read it all the way to the let's go to the 58th verse therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord oh death where's your sting old grave is where's your Victory I'm going to abound in the service of the Lord in other words I'm going to keep investing in this Kingdom because this Kingdom's got benefits that the world can't even think of it hasn't even entered into the thoughts and the hearts of men the thing that God's prepared for them to love them Hallelujah what kingdom today are we in second Corinthians 5 and 1. in God's word good for we know that if our Earthly house of this Tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens there's no sting in death there's no victory in the grave it don't got me oh I'm going to take your body good luck you can have it it wasn't no good down here it got sick all the time it ached all the time it got old it lost its memory it lost its strength it lost his Beauty I used to be beautiful and you can have this old piece of junk this old cloak this body that was shaped in sin formed in iniquity come in the world speaking life is I have no record of this body doing me any good until the kingdom came and then he gave me an earnest he gave me the power to let me know that this kingdom is real then there's no death has no victory over me if I leave you can have this dust bag because I got another house one not made by hands in other words not produced by human to Human but produced by the word of God Hallelujah that's where I'm going that's what I'm excited about and you say well what happens if you don't die well if I'm live and remain I shall be changed in a twinkling of an eye in a moment I'll be changed that why why will you be changed because I'm in the Kingdom and that's the kingdom benefit that's what happens when you get this power well wouldn't somebody that has all these benefits presented to them say I want that I want that power I want that Kingdom I want that peace I want that Joy you look at job I think it was mentioned you know job went through all the accusation but he knew one thing he had this sacrifice job knew you think he was afraid of death though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I shall see God job said I heard about him but now I see him I know he's real you know why job got that all straightened out is he had Fellowship with God he had fellowship with him he talked it with him he invested in them he asked the questions if you got a question when you come to my office with a question you're only getting a second maybe the third or fourth best I won't put myself anywhere near God if you go to him and talk with him and fellas with him you'll get the answer 90 percent of the people that come and ask for advice already know what God told them they're just wrestling with it I got a lot of people in here that could testify they've came in my office and sat down and I told them exactly why they were there by some form of discernment I don't know I just know that God's word is the answer and they already have the answer in their heart they already know what they're going to do if somebody has something in their heart to do something you're not going to change them they've got a litany of reasons and excuses they'll take you back all over the history of something and all this and all that and you just sit there and you've only got one answer and it's the word you say well what happens if they make the wrong decision you know one of the other benefits of this kingdom is if you take the permissive will God will work it to his perfect will all things work together according to the good who are called according to his purpose job was in fellowship with God you think job he was blessed beyond measure and Satan was out for a walk and he stopped after going to and fro through the Earth what do you think Satan was doing going through to and throw to the Earth sowing lies so in deception trying to build his kingdom trying to sell the world and he come across job and God said do you consider my servant job there's none like him he worships me he sticks with me he said yeah that's because he's blessed that's because you got to hedge about him that's because he's got ten thousand camels and a hundred thousand sheep and he's got a bank account anybody would serve you now job had something more than Goods he had the kingdom he had the love of God in his heart he who loves the world and the things of the world the love of God is not in them the kind of Fellowship Joe would have with God he wasn't trusting in his riches he was trusting in the god they give him the lord giveth the lord taketh away at blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to remain in the kingdom of God whether I have or I have not there's one thing I despise is that people who lose a blessing and they quit God God was only good enough for him well everything was going good well when they hit a little hardship they just Chuck him on the Shelf well job Satan says he says you can have them but there's one thing you can't touch and that's his life because his life belongs to me I want to testify tonight my life belongs to him if he takes me praise His name if me lets me live praise His name if I have nothing praise His name if I have much praise His name praise His name Hallelujah and one by one plow this happened servants came in he lost his kids everything was there now finally this guy is sitting on a pile of dung he got so driven out by everybody he's finally sitting on a dung Heap scraping his boils and finally his wife turned to him and said why don't you curse God and die he said no I am not going to curse God the lord gave everything to me the Lord took everything away with me he's still King of Kings he's still Lord of Lord he's still the god that's in control and I am not going to turn my back on him and he got to fellowship and with job got to fellowship and with God and God starts talking to job how would you like God to say to you where were you when the world was formed when the sons of God shouted for joy did you know God said that to you in this generation through the mouth of the prophet he came and told you your names on the book he brought all these benefits back to life He restored back the kingdom of God to his bride just like Esther half of my kingdom my gifty in other words I'll make you equal to me did you know if you're in this Kingdom your little Messiahs your gods thank you not in your flesh but because your spirit and your mind is in the Kingdom what about this flesh he's going to do away with it how many wants to take this bucket of bones with them I can just see me up walking across the street to go oh I can hardly sit and not stand up to preach a sermon you don't like that offer huh oh I got migraine headaches excuse me Peter I gotta find a dark place I don't want this body I'm trying to get rid of the human factor but I've been invited into a kingdom come into the kingdom of God invest in it get in fellowship with it talk it over with them the prophet of God said the church has a bank account but they're afraid to write the check he says the others have the check but they don't have nothing in the account the kingdom of God is real Church that's what we're preaching that's what Jesus preached every single one of these benefits that we talked about tonight are found in the scriptures Matthew 5 6 and 7. Peter Paul James John all the scriptures we read kingdom is real the trouble is the church is afraid to move into the kingdom because they don't have confidence that the kingdom will take care of them and you want to know the attribute that job possessed the prophet of God said job had confidence because he was fellowshipped with God all I want is your pastor is to have you to have the confidence in the existence of this Kingdom God sent a messenger and proved to us but on the shadow of a doubt that he's here and fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he was telling the church World telling everybody out there all these systems and all this stuff you're doing it's not the kingdom it's not what God offered you it's not what God brought to you God brought to you a power that you can possess and have in you that overcomes the world and the things of the world church that's what we're about we're not about the shout we're not about the dance we're about the power the power in you is an individual not the power in the group prophet of God said I love to shout and dance he says I do he says but that's not it it's the power of God in the human flesh in an individual that can meet every challenge that Satan has and it can meet him face to face and stand on the word of God and have competence that no matter how you feel amen the word will win will someone do an experiment for me how many will do experiment for me oh I got some guys that fell for that would you fast for 40 days and 40 nights without food and water and tell me how you feel you don't have to I've tried to fast in my ignorance I tried to make 40 days in 40 nights I was done after 40 hours how did he feel he didn't go by how he felt he went by what he believed he knew the kingdom of God was real he said get behind me Satan it is written don't you love him I hope you feel his presence the way I do my heart's bubbling over I've got joy I've got peace I've Got Confidence I I've got I can move obstacles I've got courage discernment I'm not afraid you know I'm not worried about sickness and I'm not worried about death I know people that are afraid to die they've confessed it to me and almost like want to get to them is just the earnest of this Kingdom and no you don't have to be afraid of death it doesn't have a sting and it doesn't have a victory it's just opening the door for a new body Paul said I would rather go be with the Lord but it's needful for me to be here for you wouldn't that be wonderful if we all felt that way Church let's invest in the Kingdom let's quit investing our time and our effort and our hours and our money in garbage that doesn't do us any good you say when's the best time to start investing now the Younger You Are the greater these benefits become amen I hope you understand my heart the I hope you understand the word of God I hope tonight that you can draw a clear discernment between the world and the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not a place the kingdom of God is more than a place the kingdom of God is a Dwelling Place not in this world but in the spiritual Realm of Fellowship with the Lord Jesus where you have power over the world and all its devils let's seek the power for those that you don't have it you don't think you have it seek until that question is answered in your heart if you ever want prayer we can pray but it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom God bless you brother Billy amen praise the Lord amen I thought that was just wonderful just the calmness you know sometimes we love mysteries we love to stand up and shout and all of those things but I believe what we're heard tonight is the applicable word that would win the victory when you get out of that door man this is not some you know talk about Mysteries and God coming down he came down so we could hear what we heard tonight amen let's all stand amen wonderful amen hearts we've been our knees o Spirit come make us humble oh and we turn our eyes for me for things oh Lord wake us out Idols forgive us clean hands oh give us let us not lift our souls to another oh and Give Us Clean Hands oh give us
