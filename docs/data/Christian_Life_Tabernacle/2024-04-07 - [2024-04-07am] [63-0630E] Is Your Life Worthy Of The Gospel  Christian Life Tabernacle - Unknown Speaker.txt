[Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] J [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] l [Music] h [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] let's all stand and sing that this morning as you inv by the mic oh and I give myself away I gave myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use for here I am oh and here I stand Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm long to see your desire re in me I give myself away I gave myself away so you can use amen let's go ahead and bow our heads commit the service to him this morning Heavenly Father we just are so grateful to you for your abundant Supply Lord for your keeping hand upon us Lord through all the years Lord for the steps that you've directed us for meeting every need for being ever faithful to us in all things Lord we thank you for bringing us to this place this morning Lord we thank you for this day this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it Lord You've constructed this day Lord that you would do the work needed in each of Our Lives Lord we thank you for this service we thank you for this another opportunity Lord perhaps this last opportunity in this building to lift up your name Lord we commit this service to you and as you have so many times before we ask for you to be present present Among Us Lord that you would take control of this service that your will would be done that every need would be met that the work that you've set about to do would be accomplished Lord may your word have preeminence we commit this service to you and ask for your presence for this is the reason that we're here this morning we lift up your name and we praise these things in Jesus name amen you may be seated just a minute it's um it's a serious week in Texas this week the state of emergency has been declared in many of our cities and counties schools are going to be closed there have been warnings to reduce travel and to stay off the road all the hotels are booked and triple their normal rates all the TV stations are suspending their normal broadcasting to provide full full-time live news coverage makes you wonder what is this sobering news it turns out that on Monday for a space of time lasting no more than 4 and 1/2 minutes the moon will line up perfectly and cover the Sun the light of the sun will be hidden by the moon in a total eclipse all this activity caused by what is expected to be the movement of millions of people to find a place to look at the Sun for 4 and A2 minutes you know it's the sun is something we take for granted it provides light each and every day it nourishes life all around the world gives us the ability to see all things revolve around it and yet each and every day the world goes about its lives without giving more than an occasional thought to it few people even look at the Sun and those who can or who those who try can't stand its brightness for more than a few seconds and are forced to look away you know they are busy with their lives but yet they enjoy the benefits that it gives but for four and a half minutes people will be traveling countless miles seeking all kinds of ways to look at the Sun for four and a half minutes only because the Moon is moving in front of it and its light will only be seen in the shadow of the moon this is something that hasn't occurred in this area in 146 years and will not happen again for another 293 but it's a passing novelty a for most a thing to study or be entertained by but if we remember Psalm 191 it says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handywork this was on my mind as I would contined to see all the attention and all the activity around this total solar eclipse the heavens are constantly declaring his glory when you continue reading Psalm 19 it speaks about the heavens day in and day out our continuously uttering speech and showing knowledge and that there is no place on Earth where the language of the heavens amen and their declaration is not being heard it finally says this in verse four in them the heavens hath he set a tabernacle for the Sun and in verse 6 his going forth the Sun is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof there is an everpresent Universal worldwide declaration being made in the heavens you know three times in the Psalms you can find the phrase the heavens declare Psalm 19 was this first time Webster's Dictionary defines declaring this way to make known to make clear to make evident to state emphatically and three times it says the heavens declare the second place in the Psalms where you can find this statement is Psalm 97 we're going to be reading that this morning and it says it this way in verse 6 it says the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory you know in Psalm 19 it says the heavens declare his glory but then here in Psalm 97 it says the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory all the people everyone but as we continue reading in Psalm 97 this morning you notice that different types of people have different reactions to the constant witness that is being made it says in verse 7 that those that serve graven images or Idols are confounded you know as some of the brothers and I were chatting the other day you know an idol is just anything that you any image you create and focus on and becomes your center of worship you can even create an image of God and his word that is an idol that you worship those who serve man-made Creations images are confounded by the Declaration that God is being made is constantly making because he doesn't line up with our thinking or our belief system or what we think is important verse eight describes the response of another group of people with to this declaration being made it says Zion heard and was glad notice the difference the heavens declare his righteousness all the people see his glory but Zion heard the Declaration that was being made he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches it continues in verse 8 and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments so the heavens declare his righteousness everyone sees something but there are those who both hear the Declaration being made and rejoice because of his judgments in Psalm 50 and verse 6 we find the third time he speaks of the heavens making declaration it says and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is Judge himself just a few verses earlier it says he shall call the heavens from the above from above and to the Earth that he may judge his people so in addition to declaring righteousness he is performing judgment declaring his righteousness causing all to see his glory and being used to judge his people the heavens declare in Psalm 98 it says for he cometh to judge the Earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity in Psalm 9 and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall Minister judgment to the people in uprightness the heavens declare you see a declaration is being made and there's a people that hear and rejoice because of his righteous judgments tomorrow the whole world will catch a glimpse for 4 and 1 half minutes of the sun being hid in the shadow of the Moon the source of light being hidden in the image of another for a small space of time the whole world will be able to catch a glimpse of the sun peing through the image of the one that reflects his image the glory of one will be seen in another all will see it some will be confounded but Zion hears the Declaration yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me amen because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me amen and I in you let's stand you know in Acts 17 we can read of one day on Mars Hill in Athens where the church a CH the first church age messenger was addressing the all the people that were gathered at that Center of knowledge and learning to worship the images of their own creation and he pointed out that at the end of the day the Declaration was this that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being for we also are his offspring verse 31 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead there is a constant declaration being made in the heavens and there is a people that hear it and rejoice let's go ahead and read Psalm 97 together the Lord reth let the Earth Rejoice let the multitude of Isles be glad thereof clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne a fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about his Lightnings enlightened the world the Earth saw and trembled the hills melted like Wax at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of Idols worship him all ye gods Zion heard and was glad and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments oh lord for thou Lord art high above all the Earth Thou Art exalted far above all gods ye that love the Lord hate evil he preserveth The Souls of his Saints he deliver them out of the hand of the wicked light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart rejoice in the Lord ye righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness amen amen God bless you why don't you turn around and welcome someone this morning amen amen God bless you may have your seats am man just to think about it this is our

history that we could rededicate ourselves and reposition ourselves into the things of God we just ask you to bless us now this morning we pray and Jesus precious and holy name amen amen God bless you may be seated thank you musicians it's uh certainly uh wonderful to be here this morning and and uh I I like what Billy said I'm going to ask maybe just a couple of Brothers to come up and been in this journey with us for a long time and say a few words maybe some of the minut ministers to say a few words here in the church at the last time and we don't have a service this evening so we don't have to run off and then we're going to play a portion of our of a a message that's very timely message so we just um you know when you leave what's behind you behind then you know all you've got is what's in front of you and you don't know what that is and I think that's the way God wants us to walk he wants us to walk by faith knowing that all things are possible and that uh there's no adversity no Spirit no nothing in this world that can't be overcome by Calvary and and uh we just trust that um we've endured pretty close I mean uh these people on the front row have a chance to bend their neck down a little bit and you'll have a little more Elbow Room and we just trust that you'll enjoy the good things of the Lord but you know I'd like to ask uh you know like brother Matt to come he's been here with us from the beginning just say a few words brother Tim zler to come these guys were here uh when when we just we didn't even think anything would happen you know and here God just keeps moving but whatever we move in we surely want it to be in the Lord so Matt I know you prayed but just come up and and uh uh just share a little a little bit on your heart all the things that uh the blessings and things that you've been through and little bit about it Matt's been faithful for us for a long time he's a real real friend to me so I love well anybody that knows Brother David uh knows that he didn't let me know I was going to be S doing this so I started my journey um at the old church I know there's not a whole lot of people in here that ever had the privilege of being in that church but um you know when we were in that old church um when we would sing God's not dead he is alive um the whole floor would Shake um and when we had meetings we thought oh is it going to hold up um and I can remember the first service when we were in here and um you know afterwards we're like what did we do I think brother Billy said there about six rows on each side that were filled and it was just it seemed crazy that we were here um and now uh there's people that we don't even see that're in the back room just it's packed out um God has been so good um you know the the scripture says that if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me and we have a pastor that is his main focus is that he lifts the word of God up yes and it's what's drawing the people it's not the personality it's not all of you wonderful people it's him doing the work the main thing our Prophet said is stay with the [Music] word it's what's going to work it's what's going to get us through to the end God's the one that's been adding the increase you know in my in my prayer I had just read in the church age book about how that the love of many wax C in this last day and how brother brandom said we really need to fight against that Spirit but I can testify that from the old church to this church and now moving into the next church I see the Capstone setting in on people we're living at the end time it's not not a far off God's been so good to us I'm just uh I love you all I'm very thankful for Brother David brother Billy and all that uh you know it it takes a body it takes a body and don't ever think that you're not part of it or that you're not significant because you're somebody to the Lord and you're needed here just want to say that I love you and God bless you before brother Tim comes I like to have my my son David Jr come up and say we now he's been with us for since the beginning and uh he was a little uh bigger when we brought Matthew so Matthew was just a little baby and uh but anyway Davey if you'd come and just say here he is over here bless you um I had a sneak Peak a little bit that I might be asked to say something last night we're fellowshipping with our pastor my father and uh he kind of mentioned on his heart that he may have the brother say something and I I got to tell you there's just a lot that starts to go through your mind you you get called to places of reflection I think all of us personally um during this time we we know that we were taught that that God deals with the the individual the same way he does the church Church um we could even you know this our brother this morning brother Mike was talking about the moon and the heavens God does things that uh he declares and he he works in Tye a lot of times it's so we can understand our position with him and how he's dealing with us and personally reflecting you know I started to ask myself you know what what does this mean to me what's the change of the building uh what What's the you know what how should I understand if anything that the Lord's dealing with my heart on and I you know I went back and I started to think I said you know would I would I look at it is this a change of where I go to church you know and if I was to look at it that way um you know I would say well many of us if we were to Look Back 40 years 30 years 20 years I and I was to ask you where did you go to church you you probably give me a different answer than where you're at right now and some of you like David you didn't even give me an option I wasn't yet so uh that's what I can do I can look back and say you know there's been a lot of change of buildings you know I Brother David just mentioned the last one but I could remember the church on Beach Street I could remember the church before that I think it may have been in halam city um he would show up there early to get the heaters going and I remember maybe one of my earliest memories is him Lifting me up to get my hands warm on one of the vents because that building just was cold and um you know so it it caused me to think well you know we really don't have a continuing City here this isn't like we become attached to a building though the Lord's done so many special things in those buildings and and there's nothing like I I mean you reflecting on a place that the Lord has visited you and they would dig Wells they would you know name the places and it's good to be able to say this was a building that the Lord did Mighty things and he visited Us in but you know that's not the church that we're going to um you know I I would look at it and you'd say well um is it just the people and I I thought brother Matt put it really it it's that we're part of a body and even on our church website you know I just went and read it just to kind of see you know what what is it that we're standing for what what is it that we're about and it's that we would all lift up the truth in this message message and and understand the headship that we've come under that we're we've gathered together in this day under a message and it's a light it blinds some you know the same light that blinds some others are seen by and uh it we we have the pillar of fire up here we know that the picture itself it it can startle some people they don't understand it I I thought you know as brother Mike was mentioning well isn't that something it it's the very Life of Christ shining for and yet some may look at it as an idol but to us it's not an idol we haven't made a Graven image or an even image made of man but we're seeing Christ revealed in a church and a bride and and we're living in and walking in that same light um but I uh had a a quote and it it was something that when I was looking brother brandom say about a new building he said it is a blessing for me here to see God's Church prospering a new building and so forth God ever bless you people be loyal to Christ stay true to the pastor and work together everybody hand in hand for I believe the coming of the Lord is soon I think we've heard all of those things echoed just this in each thing the brothers have said and uh I uh really one of the things maybe struck me is there's a little bit of nostalgia for me to walk away from a building you know I don't know that you could rimin s you could say it's it's uh you I I think some may look and say I I remember the time I wish it was just that small group where you could know everybody and you could invite everybody over to your home and I mean you could make an announcement we're all going to the restaurant and there was going to be room for everyone and you can't you can't do that I mean I could say hey everybody I'm opening up up my home and I couldn't fit everybody in the house you know um and I'm so looking forward to getting in that new building and getting to see everybody in the same room I you know we haven't seen each other all in the same room together on a Sunday morning we don't when we get in there what a time that's going to be and that's just a reflection right these are just types what a day that'll be When We Gather over there and we're all together one you know it we the things he has for us we can't comprehend and they're just so blessed and uh I thought as I was on that you know we're established in a present truth because everything here is temporal the things and the places you were yesterday you're not going to be in tomorrow and if the Lord carries and we're ask that same question 20 40 years from now where you go to church it may not be that building so the the the thing is is we have something more sure we have something more that we're established in that can't be shaken many of you life circumstances are going to take you other places and uh if your focus is on a building you're going to it's going to be this is the building that the doors don't shut right on it's uh I didn't like the paint color you know I would have hung this picture I would have done you know it's too hot it's too cold but what is it that we're gathered around is it it heavens and earth will pass away but it cannot fade it's not going to pass away this isn't a building you go to but you've been made a part of the body of Jesus Christ you're joint members with him and that's not a place you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this isn't a a a location on a map that you're going to put if someone ask you where you go to church you could say it's over here you know we've got a new building but really we've where we go to church is you're a tabernacle yes you know this Tabernacle I think it was Peter someone says this Tabernacle is going to be dissolved so when you catch that you're actually a part of a living body the body of Christ I you know that's what I would want us to be gathered together in and um I I'm looking forward to what the brothers have on their hearts to say there's going to be many of them but I I know it may be a little lengthy I wanted to read a quote because I I looked at this um and we don't have church this this evening so um I uh thought this was a good this is going to be in Jesus keeps all of his appointments if we're to look back and say hey this is the journey that we've come through to this building we're going to another one it could chronologically read out a lot of ways um and this is um one that I think it's a little lengthy reading so I'm going to make sure they could find it and uh don't mind just taking the time to to Fellowship uh around this because I think it it just helps us capture that we're so much more than just a building and so I'm grateful I think this is early in the paragraph uh par maybe around paragraph 5 and I'm so grateful that some of these any Shepherd is interested in getting his sheep the vitamins and these are spiritual vems as it was that would help the Sheep to grow into the strong faith in our God and so I approach such men and now speaking this morning on the thought of the church growing see coming into a seed in the ground ground and that seed is as it's planted grows from glory to glory and it becomes after a while until Blossom and then it goes back in the seed and that is the original seed that was planted and so has the church been the church age started in this last days after the Dark Ages had started with Martin Luther and the Reformation preaching justification by faith after his time they organized the church it died out then in there some ziggly after Luther and uh ziggly didn't even believe in the Virgin birth he went over into Switzerland they still don't believe in the ziggly doctrine do not believe that Jesus was virgin born they said he was a son of Joseph and called the Son of God but that takes the whole prop out from under the whole Foundation of Christianity he was virgin born or he just was a man like you or I he was the son of God then after that come Calvin and on and on finally the church got into such a condition there had to have another reformer reformation and God sent John Wesley which a message of sanctification and cleansiness of the spirit and then he had W filled and many of them went into this great reformation and Asbury they come the United States and this great Revival saved England and the world at that time what did they do after them Founders died out they began to organize upon the doctrine and the first thing you know they made an organization then we had others break off from there such as Alexander Campbell John Smith the Baptist Church and so forth and then the Nazarene the pilgrim Holiness and others come on and come on the great Reformation again Pentecost coming out of the organizations in the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues Divine Healing great Miracles and signs coming up come off and when for a long time it's been 50 after about 58 years now since the Holy Spirit began to fall on isua Street out in California here in the United United States where it started falling a great time come then what did Pentecost do one him made an organization he said he's coming in a wild a white horse and another on a white cloud and away they went an organization and split up breaking up the Brotherhood among the people and just like Israel little did Israel know that when they were shouting the victory of on the bank of the river they would only be about 40-day Journey about 40 miles away from the promised land they didn't realize they were about 40 years it would take them but what was it Grace have provided them a profit a pillar of fire a sacrificed lamb a deliverance and still they wanted law the way something they could have something to do in it they want to put their hands to it that was the most rash mistake they ever made in Exodus 19 when Israel rejected Grace and accepted law and then what did they do he just let them go right there in the wilderness for 40 years they planted Vineyards they eat fruit they married wives they raised children all till their old generation died off the other generation come on 40 years later and not hardly 40 hours away but had to wait 40 years before they went over then a new leader come in Joshua and they moved on into the land and they grew and the new group now I think it's very beautiful type here that we find out long ago when our forefathers in the Pentecost they raised up they had the old general counsel from the form the Assemblies of God out of there come UPC then United and so forth and they got organized and they organizations fussing fightings God just let them go right there and merry wives rais children speak in tongues Shou in the spirit but now there's a new group come up they were only just a few from the promised land all these blessings they was fine but remember the whole land belonged to them now we're fixing to go into a promised land so may the Lord help us as we look upon these things see I'm sorry that's a long reading but there's so much in there for me and there there's even other things I I'm not going to go but you know read the first two chapters of Ecclesiastes you know and uh the Lord just dealt with my heart on that and you know we if we were to assess ourselves I'm going to encourage myself in the Lord I look at myself myself I don't stand up here perfect I don't stand up here worthy I don't stand up here with any uh ability to to to think I could say anything edifying but that's not how Christ sees us and I would say that if our focus is ever on the material things you're going to find fault and uh the pride cometh before a fall and I'm really proud of that new building and it's really beautiful and it's really amazing and I didn't ever think it would be possible but I don't want to get lifted up and start looking on carnal things and think that those are what I'm established in the Lord's going to do Mighty things the way he deals with the church he deals with the individual Calvary was for a compound purpose he died to heal your body he wasn't willing that you would stay in sickness but what he was really after was the well-being of your soul and we see that reflected God has taken care of us so beautifully as a body materially he's provided us a building and I believe it should be well we should look out after it we should tend to it we should care for it but at the end of it the wellness is more than the the wellness of the building right it's the it's it's us spiritually and where we're at and so I just want to encourage you make sure you know your position is in Christ it's not in a building where you go to church isn't going to be the building um it we've got something more uh lasting because that building probably won't who knows how long the Lord carries but um set your affections on things above and they'll last forever God bless [Applause] you you I can kind of consider brother Tim a gentle giant you know he doesn't say much but you know I always watched him all the time that I've pastored how he reacts how he handles himself what where he puts the importance on things you know and what's the first place of his heart he's always been a real inspiration to me and a blessing uh and I just not to the church he was deacons for a while and the different things he's offered to help get our Sunday school put back together but it's it's just that Dedication that he has towards the word of God and and what's first in his life that's always been a blessing and to me personally and so I just wanted brother Tim he's been in the journey with us a long time like brother Matt just to say a word or two this morning God bless you brother that's because I wear my hair like he does Amen it's uh it has been a long journey as brother Matt said you know we look back to the the old old building this used to be the the new building it's soon going to be the old building uh we're thankful For What the Lord Has Done and uh a lot of things to reflect on uh I think we our priority ought to be the future rather than the past but to know where you're going it helps to know where you've been and uh those that have been led a longer time than others you you uh tend to know the pitfalls and the roads that you shouldn't take sometimes we do we turn off on the wrong road but you know the Lord wrote his first gospel in the heavens and we're taught well we know that and uh brother Mike reflected and talked about the total eclipse that's not a surprise we knew it was coming uh all of a sudden there's been this scurrying around and so many people are trying to get in position to view it but you know the Lord said a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign but yet the sign is there and as he reflected that the uh the moon comes in front of the sun and the only light you see of the sun is reflected by the moon brother R taught us that the moon was the type of the Bride so we think of that apply it to our lives spiritually speaking that's the way we ought to be right and the world gets a chance to see the moon shining in the light of the sun think of that yeah very just for a short time and all these people got hotel reservations and spent the money and want to be in the right position and then NASA comes back and says well that little region of totality may be a little more narrow than we think think of that it's a straight and narrow way amen amen so and it's going to be a total eclipse too when we don't come in here and we go over there be much different and we sing the song we are standing on Holy Ground this up here you get up here and you if you're like me you you get Tongue Tied you don't know what to say or how to say it your heart gets in front of your mouth and you just want to spill it all that's a spirit that we can pain that we bring into this place it's not Holy Ground right here if you think so we think well we come up for prayer over there we have to come back over here it's a holy God in this place it's a holy God that we bring into this place it didn't matter if it was a mataga whether it's here or next door he's with us always um you know when we came we had uh two young children we hadn't been out of the the naval service very long we came back to this part of the country we tried to settle down in East Texas and uh invariably the Lord just provided a way and moved us out here which is where I met my wife and I'm thankful for that but we came back here and we had two other children and the Lord has really blessed and we've been able to raise them in the fear and admonition of the Lord and and uh it's due to having a church right here in this in this area um that's a blessing okay we we were in an area where we had to drive over an hour to go to church when we were in in Washington state and we didn't always agree with what was being preached but you have to take what you can and you're in church you're you're following the scripture which says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together so we come together and fear an admonition of the Lord and and you worship but it wasn't real comfortable and uh but I will say when you come and you don't doubt that what you're going to hear is the truth there's something about that where you can truly Worship in spirit and in truth because you feel like the message is in me I am the message but when you hear that message preach and you say Amen to it then that's a quickening that's not by the ministry here that's of God himself that gives you comfort in your soul to say Lord I have a need at that point I have faith and believe whatever I have the Lord can answer okay so I just uh I would say I can't I certainly am not as eloquent as the is either brother mat or Brother David in in expressing myself but I look back in my life I didn't think the way we were taught that I'd ever be over 10 years old yeah you know we thought by 77 we're out of here um like I said the firman at the heavens uh that expresses God's first Bible Well he has a scriptural promise to us too to take care of us withs soever thou goest he'll be with us um there's many things yet to be fulfilled right we know it'll come in Rapid succession but the Gentiles days are short the Jews are in their Homeland they're ready there's so much turmoil right now with Iran getting involved and everything I don't know if you follow the news that closely but it's getting very very serious um you know I we we think the Year of Jubilee uh next week if it's allowed we'll have our first meeting over there maybe be our last I mean if you really consider it um I want to read just a portion of of scripture and I read it this morning not knowing I'd be up here um and and it's the last little section of first Thessalonians and verse 27 I focused on because Paul wanting to get his message across and realiz that he's doing it by letter he says I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren and I say respectfully that sisters too that when the scripture is read pay heed because it's not a man speaking at that point it's God speaking right let's just get back to uh verse 11 says wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as ye also as also ye do and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake even if it's their life's work sake think about it this morning and be at peace among yourselves now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil see that none render evil for evil unto any man that's hard to do sometimes but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing it's always confounded me how we are supposed to pray without ceasing it says in everything and give thanks but you know when you're you're driving your car and you're upset or things are getting to you you just whisper a prayer within your spirit if you're always in communication with the heavenly father you'll find that you can't be offensive to anyone as my dad likes to refer to it the Royal telephone pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole strength your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ faith faithful faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it amen blessed be the name of the Lord I I think there's going to be many times many accounts we're a to look back and say this this will be just a a vague memory we'll have so much uh to talk about and to do over there to Worship the Lord um we'll be thankful that we have this overflow here we don't know the many AC activities that are going to happen in here but we do know that that God keeps all his appointments and where he's invited he comes and we'll just invite him to the new place the same way we have here amen I would refer one more scripture and it's just a one verse but it's the very last verse of John and think about this for your future because as I said I didn't know that I'd be 10 years old but I certainly didn't know I'd be as old as I am now but the day will come when uh you know brother Bram said he was an old man he was 56 years old but he wore his body out to bring us a message and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen thank you brother now you you reflect back and you think of the meetings and everything we've had and the people that we've been privilege to have stand in preacher and you know and I've watched my good friend Harold Brown who used to come preach for us and I preached for him and the Lord took them home and brother Doug McHugh these are people that you know knew the prophet and and had contact with them brother Doug you know this testimony and the things that he had we had the privilege of having Billy Paul with us and you know Billy Paul he he took me aside one day and he just said Brother David he said one of the greatest meetings that I ever had was in your church and the people came and and lot of the people that came to that meeting he's been here a few times for us but they said I've never seen a meeting be put together and so well organized as this meeting and there's tremendous little things that took place in that meeting that phenomenal Miracles that transpired and it wasn't the building but he said it because the people people are prepared and that's the most important thing if you want to get something from the Lord is to be prepared and so before we play our tape this morning I'm just going to have Matthew come say take just a few minutes to say a few things uh he was just a baby uh maybe someday I'll post the picture um lesli's holding him and and Sharon's holding on to lesie skirt davies's off running somewhere we you know never knew where he was at and uh we're turning the key for the first time into the uh the building on halam City uh when I first came we were renting a community center on John T White Road and they would have the Bingo and the dance the night before and we'd sweep out the cigarette butts and put up the beer cans and and and then hold a little service and then uh when the Lord put us on a heart and we we came here we found a a little old house in uh uh halam City and and the sanctuary was 11 ft wide and we had little pews that we cut off a little shotgun church and the uh if I I reached up I could almost touch the ceiling off of a one foot platform and uh uh we had some great men come through there brother Ed Dalton and different uh people came and and preach for us there first place I met brother George was over at that church in uh halam City and and then from there we moved to Beach Street and uh and now it's a wedding chapel over on Beach Street I thought that's PR pretty good typee if you and then for Beach Street we went to the great double wide and uh where some of the mornings there would be more wasps in church than members and uh you know they'd be flying around everywhere and and they like they said we'd play and and uh and it was quite uh uh you know quite the the times that we had there and uh way back then you know brother uh Richard and Lenny were Richard Lenny stand up would you please both you there amen they're the first people that picked me up from the airport the first time I came to Dallas Fort Worth and uh they're are part of our founding members and sister Lenny used to sing a song for me called if just a cup of water I I place within your hand just a cup of water is all that I demand and that song would keep me going when I didn't think it was worth it and there several times I've thought of just you know forgetting it all and going someplace else and do something but the Lord just kept comp telling me and the main reason I believe it's all is cuz I believe in eternal life and if he gave you eternal life and it's freely given then freely give and I always wanted to make a stand for this message so uh it's it's been uh quite a thing as brother Kim said I think it's important that we all understand it when we go there it's going to change you you understand yeah and remember brother Tim how when we came it just felt like that closeness was gone and all of a sudden it felt like we're though we we only had this much space it was like we weren't close to one another again it like we're we're spread out and uh and you know with we we had one or two people in our youth group I think it was my two kids everybody else was was little you know and then I remember just as time come I remember when the parks came you know and and uh and we we started having some fellowship in Wade and Heidi uh virly and just a few people started coming together and uh and we just we just started growing and we never dreamed that the day would come that we'd fill this place up I mean I thought the Lord would come before now how many have been were born before 77 well come on Richard Lenny you're born before 77 no what I'm saying is that's when we used to think it was going to end we didn't think it go on but look at what God did he gave the time so you could be here cuz you were on the Lamb's Book of Life and your name was there and he knew you had to come here and and and so he he allowed this time to go on but we know we're close quickly coming to the end so uh I going ask just Matthew to come just and say a word then we'll move right into our tape this morning and I I hope that it will uh uh bless you this morning so from a little baby he came from Arizona and we dedicated him and brought him to Texas and here he is he done growed up so bless you that amen um you know just in before the service just the way many times the Lord deals with my heart he'll put us just a a message on my heart in the pre-service and um you know this is I would say every morning with with the Lord is Supernatural I feel this this morning is particular uh with with everything it represents but um shortly after that um one of the brothers got me as a sister wanted to testify of something that had taken place she uh had a a dream uh her her her baby had been sick uh was only about five or six months old and was unable to take medicine or food and she had a dream and in that dream she was sitting here in this church in this congregation and she had said if my baby is not healed then I'm not going to come back to this church and in the dream she got up to leave and as she was leaving a great light came in and led her back back into the congregation and came into the congregation and Brother David was there preaching and Brother David perceived of the light and the light came up and settled right around him and um the angel of the Lord or an angel spoke to her and said the word is being preached here and your baby will be healed and she woke up and she um told her husband uh what had taken place and that um it'll be at this church that uh her baby would be healed and and and that has taken place that was manifested and she she just wanted to testify of that before the service and so if she uh would share her testimony those would would come to know by maybe Word of Mouth of who that was but the word is being preached here and the angel of the Lord accompanies this message if you just uh re turning your Bible to um Psalms 132 I just want to read this um scripture here um you know when you you think about the buildings I I believe this as we' moved to the new Sanctuary I believe it would be the fifth one of of you know you just think of changing a building or changing habitation changing a dwelling place and you look in the scripture here in Psalms 132 and verse 13 it says for the Lord hath chosen Zion he hath desired it for his habitation that's right and just in Simplicity if I could say it like this God wants to be where you are yes God wants to be where you are and you know many times as you would make a family you might meet somebody maybe where you meet them that place becomes special to you and I think of uh me and my wife where we first started our journey I call it uh The Shoe Box on a dirt Hill it was just a a trailer up on a dirt Hill um but I love that place because that's where I was able to bring my wife and it it it become a special place and so you you might have your your first home or uh you have places where you experience things and those places become special uh just as this building here is is very special um all the babies that have been dedicated and ones that have been filled with the Holy Ghost and delivered uh uh from Spirits and infirmities and God has done many uh wonderful things here it's a special place and it makes me think of in the scripture of of Jacob how there was one time where he took those uh stones and he he made a pillow and that's when God would come down to him in a dream and and he would rehearse to him the very promises that God gave unto his father Abraham that he was going to bless his seed and give him the land and and uh when when he when he woke up you know he said oh my th this is this is a holy Place go God God was was surely here and he he got he got oil and he he anointed those rocks and he called the place bethl which means the house of God because so he said surely the presence of the Lord was here but I'm I'm so thankful it's it's not the the ground you know what what made the ground when when when Moses came before that burning bush he said Moses take off your shoes well that ground wasn't holy just a few days before that right that bush wasn't on fire a few days before that but it was the very presence of Almighty God that came down upon the ground so that when Moses came into that place and Moses take off your shoes for this place where you're standing it's Holy Ground because it was the presence of almighty God that was there and I say God has chosen this bride Hallelujah to be his habitation it's a holy place it's a sacred place and so maybe there's been many things here that we've uh um experienced that we've enjoyed but it's not because of the four walls it's not because of the building but it's because that Pillar of Fire it's because the message of the hour it's because of his presence that's here amongst us that we've been able to enjoy these blessings and and I just was thinking in my heart about how how uh Jacob there anointed that and and he had that dream he said there was Angels descending and ascending and I thought it was a profound thing that Jesus would pick that up in in John uh chapter 1 when when Philip I believe would find Nathaniel say hey come see come see a a man is this not the one is this not the Messiah is this not the one that we've we've been looking for all this time the promise uh uh to to Israel that there would be a messiah that come he said come and see and as he approached him right as as he came up to him and he approached him he he he he said behold an Israelite who wh whom there is no G he said Rabbi when knowest thou me he said before Philip called you when you under the Fig Tree I knew you I I I think of that this message has called your name uh oh before you were in that condition when you were in lady osia I saw you greater things you just read that scripture he says and Jesus answered and said un him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou he said Thou shalt see greater things than these Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man oh if if there's anything on my heart that I could say to you now I want to say you're going to see greater things this has been great this has been wonderful this this these four walls have been great but I want to say you you're going to see greater things you're going to see Heaven open oh oh maybe you've seen the seal open maybe you've caught Revelation may maybe you've had family members and certain wonderful things I want to tell you you're going to see greater things maybe your heart rejoices as you hear these testimonies going forth and and people testifying and you know in your own heart you've been holding something close Lord I I've been praying and believing for you to move on my behalf on my family on my marriage on these things I want to see greater things you're going to see you keep holding on you keep believing cuz we're just getting started we're just getting started we're just getting warmed up it's going home time we might be changing a habitation but God has chosen this bride he's chosen you to be his habitation yes his presence is with you and I want to just read this quote as uh brother brandom would say this you'll see you'll be able to see Angels descending and ascending upon the son of man now because he was coming into higher Heights of you that's just accepted Christ by justification accept accept him by sanctification and clean up your life you're still smoking Watch What Happens how much different you look back to justification you who is just standing Justified and never received the baptism of the holy ghost step up into that sphere then look back down at the rest of it see just keep walking till after a while you get so light you just could walk on up in the Rapture oh I want to say we've seen a lot of great things we've seen a lot of wonderful things but my just something on my heart was I want to say that as we might be changing a dwelling place we might be changing a habitation we might be new moving into a new building but know this for assuredly the only thing that's ever made this place anything was because of this message because of his presence because he's chosen this bride to be the place of his habitation and as we move on over into another building yes we're going through growing pains and and there might uh adversity and things we got to go through but I just want to declare unto you oh oh oh you think you think that was wonderful greater things Thou shalt see greater things than these and I'm looking forward to it because one of these days in between six and nine the change is on God bless you uh this morning um I've have chosen a portion of tape to play and um I I just want to say we're going to always play tapes okay so uh if if you're embarrassed to be in a tape Church we're tape church okay because I believe that there was a voice of God sent us in this day that the Lord promised that he would return that he would come that there would be a visible Union in invisible Union between an Earthly bride and a Heavenly bridegroom that that word had to come back in the day of the son of man God dwelling in flesh deity in flesh standing in our midst doing the exact same signs and wonders that Jesus did if I could use this terminology a reiners of the ministry of Jesus Christ for the Gentiles so the Gentiles had a chance to see exactly what the Jews saw deity veiled in flesh am now brother Bram wasn't the the the couldn't have went to Calvary because he was born in sin and shaped in iniquity but because of Calvary the spirit of God could dwell in him and the Lord would absolutely totally take complete control to where it was no longer him speaking but God was stand standing in our midst veiled in human flesh doing exactly the same things that he did when he was here you say well I would have believed Jesus if you wouldn't have believed this message you wouldn't have believed Jesus cuz when you saw Jesus you saw a Galilean you saw a a a man that there was no Beauty in him to be hold in fact he had critics and and they said many evil things about him so we have such a picture in our mind of what Jesus was Jesus was a man walking on Earth full of deity and we had in our day the Gentiles without promise but to be just he said as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and we've seen that son of man deity veiled in flesh God presented in a prophet himself yes doing the same signs and wonders right and we totally vind excuse me the word of God what a privilege to be able to to see that and so this portion of tape and we're going to uh Brothers I think they gave you a paragraph but if you just back up to paragraph 31 um be before that we're going to start with the scripture when you come into a place sometimes and this is my purpose of this this morning when when you go onto a job have you ever anybody ever went on to a new job and everybody's there and they're all know the ropes and everything and and you you're the new person and so you don't really feel a part of it you know what I mean you're kind of on the outside trying to work your way in and after a while you learn the ropes you know how things work and and you become a part of it and and and then you you join the the family well if we're going to go next door the the our our friends that are in the back I I hope you haven't become accustomed to being in the back cuz you're not going to be back there no more you're going to be in here with all of us all the crying babies together you you know what I mean everybody together because we're we're it's going to take us all together you know the expenses of this building are are are nothing to be compared to the expenses of the other building you're going to have to make the choice of being a part being a part of it making it work this gives us a wonderful opportunity for all of us together to go to that place next door as a body and all of us make it work all of us play our part all of us contribute all of us make the atmosphere and brother Brenham addresses that in this portion of tape and I I I have seen the word of God work so many times just following this messenger's example and taking what he says in doing it there was a lady that we knew and her son suffered from epilepsy and he would have epileptic surgeries and she was looking to me to do something and I knew I couldn't do nothing you know I have seen Devils be cast out it is not a fun thing and so I I I just said what to do so I I just it just come on me I said the next time he has one of those fit fits you take his shirt off of them and you go burn it well that's what brother brandham told right amen and you know what she did the next time he had a f a seizure she went and ripped the shirt off it threw it on the barbecue lit it up and caught it on fire you think that boy ever had a never ever had another epileptic GI never never cuz the word of God works amen but you've got to make a choice whether you're going to be a part of it or not am and and that's what I trust takes place amen that our move would change us from churchgoers to members of a body that we would all together be involved in the work of the Lord so it's so easy in this message to be a part of the message amen and not a part of a local body or not a part of the work everybody has access to the tapes everybody can listen to the prophet preach and and and know that's the truth amen and we all have that in common but to join together as each member fitted and joined together and each person contributing towards the cause amen of of Christ to prove and to be a shining light that the power of the Resurrection is still with a body of Believers that there's a body of Believers that lives by the word of God it's part of it doesn't not not doing its own but but doing its own thing and you can all do your own thing you've got that right but I hope that when we we say goodbye of this building and the back the Overflow joins with the sanctuary and we all move together we'll move with a body with one heart one mind and one Accord and I hope that is that we believe this message that we follow what this messenger taught and that we make our lives worthy of the Gospel amen and this is a a a a when you turn a corner or an event comes to place that it's a it's a a chance to to make a change people are so enamored with the eclipse because they feel that it's a a chance to make a change they they've got all kinds of ideas about how it affects the spirit and psyche Minds are are are going crazy and everything and I I thought well it's pretty how beautiful for us we I'll make it my sign you know a time to to make a difference a time to take a good look at yourself and say what am I a part of what am I putting my effort in what Am I Living For and this is a a beautiful tape it's 2 hours and 34 minutes long we're going to play 20 minutes of it and if you can absorb everything that's in this 20 minutes your life will never be the same amen but I want you to know that I'm not ashamed to have the picture of the pillar of fire I'm not ashamed to have the picture of the cloud I'm not ashamed of this message cuz it is the power of God to Salvation and there is no way out of this universe if I could say it that way but by God's provided way and God provided the way to the church through the voice of a prophet now that Prophet could have had many different names but the name William brandham was the name that he had he was the Fulfillment of the promise of Malachi 4:5 before the great and terrible day of the Lord I will send you Elijah the prophet that he could return to the children the faith of their fathers the faith that they had when the church was birthed that's if we don't move move to that place of Faith then we have Theology and not Revelation amen so we we want to be built and take the opportunity this morning as we play this 20 minutes or or so of this message that'll be my sermon to you this morning is to listen to it and make a decision in your heart is my life worthy of this gospel you know what excuses have I been using not to be 100% involved and to live 100% for him I can't make this journey on my own I need brothers and sisters to lift me up when I'm weak to pray for me to counsel me to encourage me to correct me I've never tried to lift myself above any of you I'm with you I'm struggling just like you are to make it and I want do all I can to help you and we went through what we went so you could have a place to sit you could have room to stretch your feet you could have a place to bring your children it's for you I could have kept this property I could have kept the property next door I could have kept it all in my name I have not w one claim to any of it it's yours it's yours it's not mine it's yours we've done what we've done that it might give you an an opportunity and a place to hear the word of God to bring your friends to bring your loved ones to bring people that need prayer that you might find his presence and as the brother says you're the ones that bring the presence so this morning I just like you to ask yourself how involved am I how much do I feel a part of it and am I willing to become a part of not Christian Life Tabernacle but of the message of William Mary and brandom to be everything that this word tells us to be without compromise and I trust so let us stand together this morning let us open our Bibles to uh Luke the 14th chapter and the 16th verse and if you're going to follow along on maybe your tablet or your phone or whatever there are it's uh it's paragraph 31 in the uh uh I guess they call them spoken word books or voice of God books um or whatever uh uh media choice that you use and brother brm says now turn in your Bibles to the book of St Luke and as soon as he's done uh reading the scriptures please feel free to be seated and then we'll we'll let's bow our heads our heavenly father I know no other place in all the Earth to receive the Divine leadership and advice of the scriptures other than the message of the hour father it was your voice to this generation amen it's the feeder of our souls it's the teacher of our hearts it's the deliverer of our minds and father may we hold it sacred Lord we're not ashamed of this voice because it's the power of God to this great generation and Lord we ask that there would be a union this morning between every believer and this word and may they hear the great voice that spoken out this morning Lord we're going to play a portion may they continue to feed on it long after the portion we play amen Lord we just ask that you would Grant this blessing to us this morning as we father are going to move from this Sanctuary to another father we came into this by your voice we will leave here by your voice we ask you to bless it now in jesus' name we pray amen now turning your Bibles to the book of St Luke and we're start at the 14th chapter and the 16th verse to read some scripture for a basis for a background for this that we're going to TI a lot about 30 to 40 minutes on now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter of St Luke then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bed many and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for for all things are now ready and they all with one Accord begin to make excuses the first said unto him I bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five y yoke of ox and I go to prove them I pray the have me excused another said I've married a wife therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord all these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant notice it's not servant servant go out quickly into the streets in the lane and the cities and bring in hither the poor and the Maine and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper now did you notice there was three pools or three turns of it when they went out first and call to them that were uh are bidden to come and they didn't do it so they went out a healing campaign went have to get the Blind and Hall and still there were rooms so he went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent they should come in now you read another parable of this something on in Matthew 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later on but I I drew this subject from there uh is your life worthy of the gospel now Jesus here is saying man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation though it be firmly proven to him that it's that it's his supper and his invitation but man is constantly making excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22 you'll find that the excuses were made there also and and they try it went back into all ages went back into the age and said a man a bid them and had a Vineyard and we find that Parable and how he sent his servants to collect from this Vineyard first servant come what did they do they run him off the next servant come they also Stone him and they run servant after servant off the cruel man the king sent finally his son and when his son came we find out that they said this is an air we'll kill him then we'll have all things then Jesus said to them the king sent forth and slew those murderers and burnt their cities now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible when God sent Noah his servant and made an way of an escape for all the people who wanted to to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned at Noah but God made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't a according to their to their uh modern thinking it didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the Days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today now him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast then I would also apply today the man the church who has been bidden to come to the feast and won't do it this spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses now if Israel 2,000 years ago would accepted the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be as they are today 20 th years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they turned it down and went into judgment but as Jesus said they stoned and killed the prophets that was sent to them um by making excuses now the excuses they made in each day we find in the days of Jesus that he didn't he didn't didn't affiliate with any of them they said when did this man get this learning what school is he from is not this the carpenter son isn't his mother called Mary isn't his brothers Jo and James so forth and isn't his sisters with us then where did this man get this authority to do this in other words he didn't affiliate with him so they said he's beah he's a Samaritan he's got a devil and he's mad he's a he's a he's a man that's got an evil spirit on the line of religion and has drove him crazy and that's what he's out there like a wild man don't pay any attention to him and we know what happened to Israel and they scamed out they were so sure that that man was wrong until on when they condemned him he said he said let his blood be upon us and upon our children and it's been there ever since Jesus was trying to tell them that their excuses was what kill the prophets and what kill the righteous that come they accepted their Creeds that man had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so had made the word of God of no effect now you've either got to say in this that this is God's Will and God's desire or either something else that you can crop up that's better than what this is and you have to take one or the other you can't serve God in man and you've got to say this is the truth or that's part of the truth or it isn't all the truth or it isn't put together right or it isn't interpreted right and the Bible said that the word of God is no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it's written just the way God wants it interpreted just what it says that that's what it's supposed to be just take it the way it's said way it's wrot down here now they accept their Creeds they make God's a Promises of no effect to them they bypass that just skip away from it now if Russia had accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they wouldn't have been communist today now 75 years ago they had a great Revival in Russ R God come among them and they had great revivals way into Siberia and what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone and the churches can't have church uh only H her permission and they are doomed into judgment as gone off on this wild tantrum of Communism sold out to the devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell in England just after that come George Jeff and FF Bosworth and Charles price Smith Wigglesworth those great warriors of the faith 50 years ago and offered England the Holy Ghost Revival but what did they do they laughed at him put him in jail called them crazy thought they lost your minds the churches refus the people to come hear them and they healed the sick and cast out devils and done great works and because that England as a nation rejected the gospel her her sins is know throughout all the world there's hardly a a more of an apostate nation in all the world even including Rome in France than England she's a mother of apostasy right where uh finny and many of the great man preached in the hay market and Charles G finny and Wesley and on down and she turned it down and down even last week or two in the papers you find out where their great man has so Deon to the to the sect of women until spies come in and their head man found some more of them the magazines has packed it their sin of Scandal right in their government has sold their disgraceful Name Across the world why she rejected the truth she had her excuse and she's finished England is all washed up with God long time ago if America 15 years ago when the Great healing Revival continued on from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was the revivals on the capital Washington DC the presidents vice presidents great people Governors great things taking place Governors and and man were healed that Congressman Upshaw had been a for for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at home she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation and she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything I can think of and a religious system is rottener than the morals she becomes and doing this she is now joined herself all these churches and the the nation into the Federation of churches and taking the mark of the beast what a thing why Christ give them the opportunity come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 when the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they was called To A Feast of Pentecost spiritual feast and they turned it down England the Holy Ghost is poured out upon them and they turned it down America the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down he bit three times three times he sent out and they did not listen to The Feast then he sent again and he said go and compel those people to come the tables got to be set the tables ready to Ste room I believe that maybe maybe within the next few months or something or year or whatever it is God's going to send another shaking across the country for there's somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone I was looking at this week's Life Magazine down at the where down at the Little Rock other day are rather hot springs and there I seen I believe it was a governor of the state of New York with some kind of a strip teas over in halula dancing with her now in here below that was another renowned man oh what a disgrace look at our nation today look at the condition of our of our nation look where she's went to how low she sunk look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now is because they have rejected and refused the message of God the invitation to come to the feast could you call a life like that worthy of the Gospel could you call a life that could set and per perit their their people to do the things to smoke cigarettes the other day down here a certain church a little league team was playing down here at the park and my brother-in-law's little boy is a pitcher uh for one of the teams and so he was out there pitching and there was a church league playing and there was the pastor with these little fellas out there on the ground playing and the pastor Smoked Cigarettes after cigarette of a real neighborly church right here by and could you imagine a man and even people sitting in the audience noticed it but it's getting so that they don't even pay any attention to it a certain great church a Baptist Church that I know of lets a church out from Sunday school 15 EX3 minutes so that the pastor and all of them can stand outside and smoke before they come back in to serve the duty of the law John Smith the founder of that church prayed so hard that God send a Revival till his eyes swoll shut at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon if that man would turn over in his grave if he know that church had gotten that condition what is it they were bidden to come and turned it down that's the only thing and you remember Jes Jesus said in here that those that were bidden and turned it down would not taste his supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in the church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much and say I know it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself see you just listen to it because you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I could say I believe that's a $10,000 that don't mean I got it see I could say it's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be have the privilege to come and receive it to you people who come here I'm not responsible for those who are are other ministers are speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than to know that you can have eternal life what if I was giving away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well I I'd have to get a militia out here and swarm away from the place you wouldn't have to make an alter call fart you just have to beat them away from it to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the Eternal God all his power of His resurrections which promis you eternal life and Satan will put his Legions out there and keep you away from it yet you can look and sensible enough look in the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down see some some kind of an excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from God now we noticed and in the Old Testament they had what they call the Jubilee year that was when all the people that was slaves could go free when the Jubilee sounded and then if the man did not go out if there was some excuse that he could give that he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the ear with an all by the post in the temple and then no matter how many jubilees come along that man was sold out he could never no more come back as a citizen in Israel no more what did he do he rejected his invitation he didn't have to pay nothing the debt of his slavery was over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland and get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't allowed no more with Israel and his possession was given to another now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that is true and we reject it and refuse to do it or to listen to it we take on the mark of the beast now somebody said now there's going to be a a mark of the beast it's going to come someday let me tell you it's already come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to Fall the mark of the beast begin to take place see you only have two things one of them is accepted takes the Seal of God to reject it takes the mark the Beast to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast everybody understand to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast for the Bible said all that was not sealed by the Seal of God took the mark of the beast when the trumpet sounded and all wanted to go freak could go them it didn't was marked now you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize that what you've already done see and so is the holy spirit it's to be manifested when we see the Lord Jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power and see the Dead Rising out of the grave and know that a second longer we'll be changed and have a body like his it'll be made manifest then to see those who rejected it will be left down out didn't Jesus said The Virgins went out to meet Christ some of them fell asleep the first watch second third fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch but in the seventh watch then came forth the sound behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and the ones that were sleeping awaken all the age back to Pentecost woke up see from the seventh age the seventh Church age all the way back to woke up and these that were in this church age of living they were changed and they went in at the very time they went in the sleeping virgin come and said we want to buy some of your or but they said we just got enough for ourselves go to them and sell it and while they were trying to receive this AA the bridegroom came there has never been a time in the history of the world that the episcopalians Baptists methodists Presbyterians the papers are full the religious papers are praising God that those sleeping virgins are now trying to receive Pentecost trying to receive the Holy Ghost and don't the people realize that it will not happen according to the word of God while they were trying to come back the bridegroom come and took away the bride and they were cast into outer Darkness for judgment because they rejected their invitation all peoples are bidden to come God in every age has sent out his light and it's been rejected and now today is no different from any other day to reject the day of the visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people receive it then don't put it off till next year the next Revival that's the hour today is a day of salvation and remember God has never sent a message in any day but what he Vindicated with the supernatural Jesus said himself if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works you believe the works if you can't believe me when you see clearly cut and and made manifest now the time has come that she rejects it then she's bored in the ear with an awe then she'll never hear it now she takes herself to the confederation of churches to go right in to take the mark of the beast one of the great Ambitions somebody give me the paper in just now this new Pulpit said is to unite the churches together they'll do it just as certain as I'm standing here and the Protestants Fall Apart see because the church the Bible said Paul the prophet of the Lord said that day will not come except there come a falling away first and then the man before the man of sin will be revealed he that Seth in the temple of God opposing himself all that's above God he as God forgiving sins on the earth and so forth how that this thing happened but it couldn't happen until falling away until the church begin to get away from the spiritual Feast draw itself back and organize itself and then the Revelation didn't stay with the church remember Israel walked Day and Night by the pillar of fire when that Pillar of Fire moved they mooved with it and remember it was a fire at night and a cloud of day so it might come day or night anytime but wherever it was there was a propitiation made that they would not fail to see it it was a light at night and a cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir the same thing Martin Luther saw it what did he do he come out of Catholicism but what did they do they build a little fence around said we're lutherans this is it then Wesley saw it mov it away from there he went what they do build a little fence around and said this is it why the I do moved right on again Pentecost saw it why they do moved out of the westling and nazarin and so forth what do they do they build a little fence around call we're Oneness and we're Trinity and we're the United and all this what did he do God moved right on out of it see we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy a man that's a Christian on Sunday and goes to church sits back there and thinks he owns the church because he does this that the other and on Monday oh steal and lie and women that'll go out on the public beaches and and out up the streets with immoral clothes on I thought of our the first lady wouldn't even put on makeup to go before the pope and come back and set a Waterhead haircut uh uh spree for the women in the nation and all these uh dresses that when she's become mother every woman in the country wants to wear one of them uh mother type dresses now that's right it's examples that they know that those people that do that they take on a spirit of the world and that don't belong in the Church of the Living God praise the Lord women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah name of the Old Testament yes now they got so that I was preaching the other night somewhere about a women to obey their husband obey that went out the mar Rich a long time ago but uh they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so they not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I don't care how much you Dam to speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God a woman that wears shorts and does these things that she does on the street don't call yourself a Christian you want to have the world and still hold your testimony you cannot do that in the presence of God when you know better than to do it notice bored in the a marked away then you'll never hear remember that's a sign of closing the ear years you won't hear it no more you won't listen You'll never be able to get to it again oh she don't believe that oh my don't tell her she believes it no she tell you right she don't know it how could a a lady just to ask you how could a lady as I spoke Sunday last Sunday night a week ago tonight on a red flashing light how that the the the Run of women has become prettier than it ever was that's nothing nothing against a woman now that's just but how she controls that see that she's got that way to put her in a Temptation like Eve was put before the tree every man every son that comes to God's got to go through that hour testing this is the age of women this nation is or she has to go through that testing if she can be a pretty woman and act like a sister the Lord's blessings upon her but when she can get herself to to know this and display herself absolutely shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on her she don't mean to be that way I don't think many of them don't but they don't realize that it's all on tape so you know you don't just cuz I stopped it don't mean you can't go pick it up right but let's just look at what he's saying he says there's an invitation a time that's given to you to say I'm going to give my all did you read that and I thought it was it it was beautiful he said he said remember Israel walked Day and Night by the pillar of Fire when the pillar of fire moved they moved with it and remember the fire at night and the cloud by day isn't it amazing that this message has got both it's got both to move right with it to stay with it when it moves to move with it not no excuses amen God will provide a way he says it appear by day so it might come day or night any time but whenever it was there was a a prary made and they would that they would not fail to see it it was light at night and A Cloud by by the daytime and they followed it yes sir the same thing now this is what you this is what we can do we can't make an excuse not to follow this message 100% we do not take this message and try to fit the message to the trend of the world we can't make excuses for this message amen the message called out the condition of the world just the way it is stay with the message stay with the message don't make an excuse not the follow it be 100% sold out to it and this is what I'm saying this is an opportunity for there to be a change in your life leaving this building you could go into something that's brand new you can become a part of it you can get in there 100% you can live your life 100% you could come to church living holy you could come to this or you can be a spot in a room Wrinkle In in the the the feast and you know what he said when you they were called to go free can you imagine that you owed didn't matter how much you owed that's right when that trumpet blew your debt was paid for you understand what would happen if you owed money that person could take you into servitude you'd sell your children as Farm Workers as maids and they would work in that home paying the debt down but every seven years they blew a trumpet and they wiped the Slate completely clean all over Israel every Israel right was now free to go back to their land and resume their life debt free could you imagine somebody not wanting to go take life stay in bondage to sin stay in bondage to Habits Stay in bondage to things of the world stay in bondage to sports stay in bondage to politics when we have an opportunity we just heard the trumpet we just listen to 20 minutes of the Trump of God for the Trump shall sound we've heard the shout The Voice the Trump of God and we can go free into the freedom that we have in Christ Jesus living by the resurrection not just for it but by it that power in our lives to overcome and we can do that we can't do it on our own he invites us and just like he's invi he inviting all of us to make a commitment all of us to make a decision all of us to to ask yourself am I going to live by this gospel amen move when it moves go when it goes stay with it 100% is the choice that that's given to you there's a lot of things offered out there in the world you know a lot of Pleasures a lot of careers a lot of things but let me tell you they're temporary they're temporary I remember most of you probably aren't old enough to remember the Sha of Iran richest man in the world he he flew every place he went he brought a hospital with him a comp an airliner complete Hospital doctors surgeons everybody guess what happened to him he died just the same and here God's offering eternal life where you'll never die you live forever am didn't he say if I gave you a pill take this pill you'll live A Thousand Years well I'll guarantee you I don't think a real believer would take that bill I don't want a thousand years of this I can't even imagine where this is going but I don't have to because I have a pillar of fire I have a cloud I have something that I can follow I have something that I can stay with something I can live for amen something that's got a reward Beyond whatever you could think don't give up on anybody you just live more the more faithful you live the more True to this word you live the closer the that the ones that you love are coming to it but the more you compromise it the easier it's for them to stay away you come sold out to God's word you'll have an effect on everybody he promised us that it's a promise and just look it just he says he says it moves he says Pentecost saw it and what did they do they moved out of the Wesley the nazarin and so forth what did they do they built their little fences right now this is what he comes down he says we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy do you understand if we don't follow this daily we take on an organizational life people say well we won't be organized we'll never be a denomination but we got an organizational life and then he described it right we can sit in church and agree with it we can go Amen to it he says but that's just sympathizing with it and that's what an organizational life is it's recognizing the truth and sympathizing with it but has excuses for everything that comes along that they can't live 100% for it I don't want an organiz ational life it's too late it's too late but let maybe in your own personal life this gives something to you to have a place that you're going to turn a corner you can you can say okay we're we're making a move I'm going to make a move spiritually yes let the natural type the spiritual I'm going to make a life more dedicated ated I'm going to reach out I'm going to I'm I'm going to be I'm going to be Christlike I'm going to continue I'm going to live my whole life for the gospel he says we don't want to be a Christian on Sunday we we want to go out and I I'm just praying that that in our life that and I and I my own self I want to make it's going to be such a burden lifted off of me that we're that it's done that I can be back in position myself where I can be led every day and I believe God led me to build it and and it took a lot of work it took a lot of money it took a lot of time but that's done you understand you can't try to there's no Rewards of the past our reward is to follow him and he'll lead us and go forward and see what he has we'll we'll finish up our little remodeling here and we we'll go forward but I I'm anxious for what God has and I want to invite you to be a part of it I want you to know it's going to take you your prayers your life your faith to to see him walk in our midst we're not here to build a a monument to anything we're here to follow the word of God that was brought to us in this day through Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 that the life that was manifested in the messenger of this age whom we've had the privilege to hear and follow and I'd like to read these two statements in closing this is paragraph 2 264 now the only way to live a life Worthy is to let Christ and his word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God's vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and it returned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these Future Days that's why he died that he could present a sacrifice to God that he might come and dwell in you how many want them to dwell in you what's the first thing you got to do cut the excuses get rid of the excuses don't come up with an excuse you know I just thought you know I I I used to like the Rangers and I used to go to the Rangers game when I finally gave up the Rangers and quit it and said I'm done with them you know I don't know a player on the team anymore it just wasn't for me they won the World Series good I'm glad because as long as I was hanging out with them they never one cuz I'm not meant to hang out with them I'm not to walk with them and everything you know what I mean I okay there there's no more excuses I know some of you like uh what a soccer football you probably know all the guys that uh run around that ain't our thing our thing's eternal life through Christ Jesus so that's the only way just just let's put that paragraph back up let's read that again listen to it closely now the only way to live a life Worthy is to let Christ and his word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word till God vindicates in you what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and it returned back in the form of the holy spirit amen to present himself as sacrifice and then that spirit that was in him returned back on you in the form of the holy spirit so what the holy spirit is is the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus in you to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you Amen to fulfill F his promised word in these Future Days paragraph 270 and today when the evening lights are shining and there's not a man in his right mind but what can say any Bible scholar looking at the Bible knows this is the last days then it behooves us to fall from these big to it behooves us to fall from these big walls or get away from these things and to get into the righteousness of Jesus Christ in this last day and take on the Seal of God before the devil gives us the mark of the beast oh my yeah pray God to let the light of this day rise in you to be an obedient servant to God and then let the fruit of the Holy let the fruit of the spirit ever remain in your life and that is life that is a life worthy of the Gospel let me say this in closing the only way the only way that you can live a life worthy of the Gospel is let the gospel itself every bit of the Gospel come into you and reflect his promises back let them vindicate let God living you and vindicate the promise of this day amen is that let that be as all the brothers got up in here and say is not look at our building let's look at our life let's look at these people what is it about these people they follow the prophet they follow the message and you say the prophet what's that mean the prophet it was the scriptures fulfilled they re recognized the scriptures being fulfilled they recognized the Bible promised that the spirit of Christ would come dwell in a a a a a a vessel a human vessel that's what we call a prophet one that speaks lip to ear to God that that would come and he'd be manifested he'd give a message to the church and that message is the only thing that frees her from the deception of the devil everybody's out there's a Christian but Satan appears as an angel of Light and there's only one way to discern that angel of Light from Christ is by revelation of the pure word of Goden so it's not anything to play with you have the opportunity to be become one with the word of God to live your life have eternal life be filled with every promise that he can reflect himself in you and it's offered to you and what did Brother B says he says the Le Satan sends all his Legions out there to keep you from it amen he'll give you your own personal demon oh yeah a Tormentor to keep you from it amen but boy when you want it so bad you just start recognizing that devil and you say Satan get behind me I know you you're my own personal devil you're my Tormentor I'm tired of you and resist him and he'll flee don't make excuses when Satan tempts you that's not you that's not you when you fail that's not you that's not the real you the real you is a believer of this word of God that's who you are let's take our position as one of the Brethren said let's take our place let's realize what we stand for we're not trying to build a new religion that's we're not trying to build a new Fellowship we're not trying to create a new movement we're not trying to get something that's excited we're not trying to have better music and more Talent we let anybody sing who sings you want to come sing you can squeak out a tune in this church and we all might be plugging our ears but you got a right to do it it's not reserved for The Talented it's reserved to those that love God we're not interested in person ality we're interested in one thing and one thing only God sent a voice my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow let's make that what we represent let's make that what we stand for let let us all in common have an absolute and that absolute is the message of Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 let it be applied equally to everybody and let our light so shine amongst men that our good works might glorify Our Father in Heaven I thank the Lord for the past amen I thank him for the things I've seen I think thank him for the presence and I could go on for hours about the Miracles I've seen but I want to look what he's got in the future what does he have in our future days and I want to be a part of it I want you to be a part of it and wherever the spirit of God leads you may you live 100% for this message Lord richly bless you we're going to ask we're going to ask brother just sing a a few songs of worship uh as we say goodbye to this place and soon as service is over we're going to take the pulpit next door and we're going to take the pictures off the wall and we're we've already started taking it apart so they can move the piano and organ tomorrow and you pray for us you're welcome to come help you're weling to be a part of it but without you it's impossible to please God
