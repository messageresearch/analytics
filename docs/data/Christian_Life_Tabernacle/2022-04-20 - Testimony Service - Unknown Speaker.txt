heart tonight just lift your hand up to him man we're in its presence and all things are possible amen amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if you could come at this time amen brother daniel locks if you could just come and take these things before the lord give a quick little testimony i told the lord if he called me up here tonight i would give it so here i am but uh you know in the bible i tried to find the scripture it's in first samuel i know that talks about obedience is better than sacrifice and uh i was going through some things at work i do bodywork for living for those who don't know i was at uh been doing it for 26 years was the same company for six years ford over in north virgin hills and uh things just began to go south and south quicker and faster and it's just the more i prayed god changed my heart changed the things that worked seemed the worst things god the harder my heart grew towards the place and towards the industry period i was ready to just walk away find a whole new job a whole new line of work whatever and um talked to the pastor about it and uh he wasn't crazy about the idea and he let me know but um i said i wanted to talk to him get his input on it and and i mean i was i had an app on my phone and i was looking for different jobs i mean i was even looking to be a forklift driver for like 30 bucks an hour that's easy money why not um but he said he thinks you know god gave me the talent to do what i do i should stick with what i'm doing so and it kept coming to my mind this bmw house i used to work at down in arlington kept coming to my home i was like i don't want to work there i don't want to work there again they they pay less than the ford house did and uh i was looking through my app one day and all these forklift jobs that came up gp1 collision center i'm like now that's strange why is this in the forklift jobs right so i said all right i'll go ahead and call stuart down there i know the man i went in there cold steward he says man i've been having that ad in the in the in there for like 10 months he goes yeah i need a body man come down and talk to me so went down there and talked to him um and got the job two dollars more than what i was making it forward an hour so praise the lord um and when we was i had my tools this is where i wanted to testify as god sees everything and he is so mindful of everything it's not much some people maybe to me it's just a so mindful man of everything but my tools were in my garage i was using brother david's trailer and i had to get him the trailer back back to david junior that night because he had to get his scissor left back anyway so jerry was with me my brother and he's like uh he was in the truck and he's like man i think i need to get out of the truck something's telling me get out of the truck i said man you're on it's all right dude i know i'll clear the garage he said man something's telling me that i said all right man just get out guide me whatever i start to pull out he's like the string that pulls the garage door down caught one of my tool boxes and was shut the garage door i had to rip that thing completely out of my house and that would the lord knows there's no way i could have afforded that at this time so that's just really what i wanted to share and just thank god and give him the praise and the glory and the honor and then today i was thinking you know the worst thing about leaving that place and going to where i'm at now is we don't have ac well my boss told me today that uh next friday we're getting our air conditioner stuff put in so praise the lord just go before the lord precious father [Music] lord we know you're so mindful of everything lord no matter how big or small you thought of everything lord and nothing catches you by surprise [Music] father just like tonight you ordained each and every one of us to be here together father and lord by knowing this lord we know that you have something for each and every one of us lord no matter where we're at in our walks in life father as long as we stay by your side we'll make it lord father for you sent us this unadulterated word of the hour to carry us through lord [Music] father it's not always the easiest thing to live but father we love it and we love you i don't mean to get so emotional lord but just thinking so many times you've never let us down even though i fail you daily lord you've never failed me father i just pray for this remainder of this service lord all the needs that went before the church lord the little children that have to sing their choir song father as long as they do it in your name we know they'll be blessed father we pray that you'll bless those hands that was raised tonight lord you know every need of every heart before the hand was even raised before we even knew we had a problem or a need lord you already had the answer so we give all these things to you lord have your way in a mighty way with your children here tonight we're so thrilled and we thank you so much for inviting us here to your home your house tonight and as i said lord we all know obedience is better than sacrifice and we obeyed you by coming tonight so we're looking forward to what you have in store for us we love you we give you all the praise the glory and the admiration lord may you bless this evening's tithes and offerings lord and use them for the furthering of your kingdom we love you father and we give you all the praise glory and admiration that we possibly can jesus christ's name we pray amen amen aren't

[Music] i'm coming back coming back for you when it gets dark the clouds roll in there seems like no man wants to serve god the word of god tells us look up our redemption draws nigh father we're so grateful for that [Music] this evening be thankful for the blood ask you to bless us this evening in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated is god good amen isn't he wonderful well this is a testimony service so matthew's going to host our service that i wanted to testify we're good i think musicians if matthew needs you he'll call you back up again well you know you go through journeys in life have everybody been to a journey a journey is when something takes forever and you just work on it and you work on it and you work on it and finally one day you get a little bit of victory and so in may of 2015 we sat down with the architect and began drawing a plan for our new church and we felt we needed one and we worked out several different situations and worked through some drawings and finally got to something that we felt that it wouldn't be too expensive to build and it would be nice and then we presented our plan to the city in about 2017 and then we had our first meeting with the city in 2018 they agreed and from that day on we've been on quite a journey everybody the city manager changed the city engineer changed the development director changed the public works director changed the inspectors changed everything changed but finally after a long struggle this tuesday we finally got our first permit and the so the the building process is is in two parts one's what they call the public works and which and the grading permit which is the groundwork the parking lots the sewer the water all those things are first then after we have the fire laying in and the fire hydrants in they give us the building permit to start building the building so as they would say you can't go vertical till the fire lanes in so we're starting that it's going to take a lot of cooperation from all of us parking the deacons or have worked out a parking plan that includes parking down the street at the church down the street and we'll give out all the stipulations who parks there basically if you can walk 150 yards you'll end up parking down the street if you're under 30. anybody 40 and over they can park out here if they have children and some people smiled at that i hope you're not giving anything away here you know i didn't think you were there yet so we'll arrange that we'll put notices up and all that so the main thing we need is to watch our children because we're going to have equipment in the back it's muddy we're sawing out concrete we're taking off so all the kids can't run back there and play ball the way they used to so parents watch your kids if not they're going to be getting in your car with concrete all over them and all those things so that's all the news the other part of my testimony is is that he saved me back in around 1967 68 and he hasn't let go of me i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i should be but i'm not what i used to be either and and that's a that's a thrill to my soul there's many a times i thought that he was going to let me go there's many of things i've done that he should have let me go but he promised me he wouldn't and he said if i started to work in you i'll finish it until the end and we had a good camp this year the lord blessed many people and all i can say is the best way to keep the fire burning is to testify about it the best way to keep your flame burning is to share it with other people that's why the prophet of god said if you can't do anything else tell them how your candle got lit amen because if if if it doesn't if you don't keep sharing it it dies out in your life and the best way to keep a fire going is to fan the flames and so uh tonight i i know that sister kelly's gonna testify she's been burning to testify she called me and let me know she's going to testify she said i want to testify so i'm going to invite matthew up he'll say what he wants to say and then sister kelly you'll be the first one to testify okay yeah and then uh i know brother tommy's gonna say a little testimony andrew and then anybody else just raise your hand wave your hand and if you don't get noticed just jump up and start testifying amen right that's one thing we have is the liberty of the holy spirit and there's no big eyes here there's no little news there's no we were all purchased for the same price there's none of us that have done one thing for our salvation i didn't do the choosing he did the choosing and if he chose you i respect any decision he makes now i have to be honest there's a lot of people i've met i wouldn't have chosen and and that's why he didn't put me in charge right right and there will be a lot of people there that you'll be surprised but believe me they'll be just as surprised to see it so do you love them tonight amen you're ready to talk about the good things of god you're ready to testify what he's done for you amen we don't have to hurry let's just rejoice in the lord anybody can testify and we just might call on somebody and have them testify and if they don't have a test a testimony what that means is you put them on the top of your prayer list because they need to get close to god so they have something to testify about well anyway god bless you i just want you to know that i love you all with all of my heart those of you that are listening in by way of whatever we call it stream or or everything we love you too and many of you there's people that i haven't seen in two years now that never miss their offering never miss their support for the ministry always in prayer so we're waiting for the day we all get back together thank you so god bless you brother matthew if you want to sing songs have the musicians back and invite the first the only thing commands you have for me is that you have sister kelly testified first other than that however this spirit leads it's not that the spirit's not leading oh i i want i'm so anxious to hear a testimony amen all right god bless you praise the lord why don't we just go ahead and stand it's always good to read the word as we just start a little testimony service just read out of first peter 3 15 i've always i like this scripture and it always whenever you're going to testify and say something about the lord the scripture comes to my remembrance so i just want to read that first peter 3 15. i love to hear the pages turning and they are turning it's okay i don't know why it is so many times in service when a minister might say turn in your bible to romans i'm like i know romans is in my bible somewhere i think hopefully we've all experienced that before first peter 3 15 says but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear amen let's also just read john chapter 15 verse 26 and 27. amen that's what we're doing this evening is we're giving you a an opportunity to speak of that hope that lies within you and then john 15 verse 26 says but when the comforter has come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me yes and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning amen you can go ahead and be seated my that's inspiring right there we have something to testify about and i just love how it says because you've been with me from the beginning we have a message that took us back before there was ever a stardust created that we are with him so before i get excited let's just call sister kelly up that she can testify of what god has done we're certainly looking forward to that so i you know the lord's been good to me he's given me two very beautiful boys there's no way i could thank him enough for that both of them are very special they they're they have gifts they they have lit up our lives so when no mildest is 21 he's wayward um that's not going to be for long i'm just telling you that it's not going to be long um i knew all the different scriptures when he was born we did not know and it didn't seem anyone around us knew that our children are promised like it could go either way you just better hope you know and like we heard a lot of different input from very well-meaning people like just you know do everything right if you'll if you will you know be very very dedicated while he's little you know that's the children who stay that's the ones you know so we're like trying to be dedicated and we're you know and time went on we're trying to be dedicated we were saved you know full of the holy ghost but um when he got to be a big huge teenager you know when things didn't go right i began to search for myself what does the word say about our children what what happens to abraham seeds kids that's what i want to know and i began to find okay it's everywhere it's literally everywhere it's literally full proof that our children are promised so like isaiah 54 13 i have a great big plaque on my wall i had a sister paint it for me and i said i want you to put levi and christian on that in pain and it says and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children well when you have a great big teenager they do not have peace it's a very difficult portion of road very difficult for parents and for the child so that word peace is big and i thought you know someday my kids are gonna have their that's mine my children will be will have peace and the only way you're gonna have peace is in the lord so i knew the different ones i played i played the prodigal brother branham and he said that mama and daddy you know he said they i see him they got in the floor which he doesn't say they're praying but we can figure that out he said they they're getting in the floor and they're they're restless and they're saying lord watch over where you know watch over my boy the boy had gone and he said that ain't that night after the parents got on the floor the angel of the lord visited that boy in the pigpen and said wake up you go home and he said that's what happened how the prodigal came home he also says in adoption number two paragraph 16 he says you you mothers you know he said your children you know i don't care how wayward and i always hang on to those words i don't care how wayward that boy or that girl is you know their promise to you so that being said so this this year in january i was climbing in bed and all of a sudden i just saw it was a little six minute uh youtube clip it was some it was a different brother a different church i'd i don't even watch those and it but i'd seen it like months prior and then this came back to my memory him saying you don't have to worry about your children and i thought yeah i wonder what else he said i came from and then right then in my room brother david was standing there and he said you don't have to worry about your children because he's doing all the worrying for you well when that had actually happened was a prayer line like two years before in our first meetings we were here it was something brother david literally said to me while i was standing there for prayer so those two things and i thought okay i'm not the lord's dealing with me i'm not thank i'm not thinking this the lord's telling me i don't have to worry so i came to church that sunday and this is again about a week or two before brother jason watkins was here and brother david was up there and uh he said okay this is a disclaimer this is not about your children he said i will always stand with you god's going to give you your children and he said it's his reward to you they are your inheritance in that moment i then remembered that scripture that says lo children are a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward and the lord just dropped the veil he just showed me levi and christian are my reward and brother david had said you all have to go back and find it he said um that's your reward for serving him and i thought well that's so simple i didn't have to like you know get to church an hour early for a hundred years and just your different things because literally we heard it all we heard it all and so your reward for serving him and you know troy has word you know worried and worried and i know he's told me many is the time he has bowled over his steering wheel in his van and cried out lord save my boys okay so about you know about two years ago christian told us you know he was 15 he said i don't mom i just don't i don't feel that i believe the message i thought okay i can do two things and go one of two ways i can argue i can negotiate i can [Music] give him books i can or i can believe god and i can pray so i chose the latter we moved on we moved on but then the lord after brother david said that that sunday in january i started going okay that's my reward so i got in the floor and i said i said lord i believe you're gonna save my boys but i said what could you do with christian's life if you saved him before he was 18. i said would you would you do that for me i know i can't ask you for a certain time i realize that's your business i i know that i you know i love you i'll always serve you but i don't know that i could make it without him i don't i don't think i could have my other arm blown off and make it and so about a month later the lord saved christian and when he came home and when he came home from the oklahoma camp and he told me about it and his whole little face was beaming with joy and he said mom i didn't know i didn't know god loved me and i realized he was you know telling me something so i said so you do now like he he showed you that he loved you you felt that he loved you yes and he said mom i have joy and i have a peace now and he has been a completely hundred percent different human being in our home but one thing i prayed when i asked for him i said you know what could you do in our home like you will change it to instead of two against two it'll be three against one and i was like you could you could change the dynamics in our home what could you do with his brother what could you do in the young people what could you do in our church what could you do in in the world if he was saved at 17 and i said and i was weeping saying all this of course he can go prodigal of course he can come back later and we can sit and wait you know but i asked him what would you do with that and so my my thing is that when the lord said lo children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward i did not know what that meant and now i do and so now when i pray i don't even really ask for levi's soul i just say lord watch over your word to perform it just watch over your word to perform it that's all i ask and uh he's going to do that for me and i know that it will not be long it's my victory is mine wolf victory today is my [Applause] [Applause] is oh foreign [Applause] well praise the lord i think that's a beautiful segue for somebody else to testify and i could certainly testify of what god did in the the oklahoma meetings that we were in and so uh there was a few uh young men that were there that uh the god did something for and so i figure we'll just start with brother christian i don't know how this ended up in my hands i wanted i wanted to testify though um so during our february meetings i was still in a mindset mom said that i didn't believe the message but i didn't just not believe the message i hated it for all it stood for for all it was for all it made people do to me and my life and my brother and i just couldn't get past that it was it was stopping everything from coming to pass and i knew that's what i needed to be i knew i was part of the bride but i just couldn't do it like if god could let all this happen does he even care about me i felt forsaken for so long anyway so in our february meetings i just decided i was like well now i have all these christian friends now i can't quit church so i kind of have to hang out so i can be friends with them or else they'll disown me right i have to be in anyways so but we're talking with some friends and i see john telling somebody that he'll see someone at pawnee camp and i was like what i was like no you're not you're not going there and he was like he was like yeah we're good he's like i'm gonna try to go so i said i just said in the spur of the moment i'll go i didn't realize it was the lord anyways um so we ended up going and we got our own hotel we did everything we were just like yeah it's gonna be such a vibe but it was it was the lord every part of it was the lord anyways so we got through some services and the lord's dealing with my heart and their hearts as well and by saturday morning hi um by saturday night by saturday morning i should say rather i just decided that i don't care what it costs i'm going to go back i don't care what my brother says i don't care what my friends say i'm just going to keep going because this is what i meant to be this is who i am anyways and i had dealt with identity problems forever because i was avoiding what i was anyways so i was saved and i was like now i have to tell everybody i have to tell all these friends that i made that were in the church actually but they didn't believe as well and we had our little group and we're like yeah the message blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah anyways so i told them they asked me they're like yo what's this about and i was like it's for me i was like it's for y'all too but it's for me [Applause] anyways so i'm on this new christian walk and it's amazing every day every day i'm just so happy and i know what i'm supposed to do and if i mess up i get right and i continue with my walk with the lord because i can't be hung up by it anymore we're called to go forward and so i'm praying and i have this new prayer list of things i want to pray about and see god do so i'm praying for all the lost souls that i've met outside of church and i'm praying for like the church to have a new like fire about it because we need it yeah um no no offense and so we go back from louisiana camp and like god answered my prayers and so that's what i got from louisiana camp because by the time we got back ariel was getting baptized and by the time we got back michael was talking about the lord with us and gershom is getting led by the lord back to him back to the flock and service sunday night i don't know if you guys were all there but it was amazing the lord moved in so many ways and i'm just thankful to be a part of this body and i'm thankful for brother david and all that he does well it got good to give us so many blessings on deserving that's what we are [Music] that's what we are [Music] [Music] oh [Music] sing it again [Music] oh what a mighty dog [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] you might as well get ready hey man i know that god did something special for for big john as i like to call him did something special for brother john even started in oklahoma but just go ahead and whatever's on your heart brother all right god bless y'all so um where can i start i guess i'll start with through our february meetings um yeah so someone was like are you going to the party camp oh i mean no like you need a good hotel because registration was already over i was like you know what that'd be really fun really fun i mean sounds like christian christian bonnie man but we're in our own car you know go to the hotel we have a good time oh we'll go to service too but you know it's like yeah it was the lord like you were saying we didn't know man we didn't know what's coming so no we have a so yeah we have a we have a fun car right there and stuff and from the first service i'm telling you but andrew glover preach uh repentance brings you into condition to receive and yeah and then i was like oh my god you know okay i get it so you know it was already starting to work and friday night it was really special um so after that service i went up in the prayer line and i knew i had to get right and finally give it all you know i went to prayer line it was brother matthew with the joe adams and like maybe two other people and i told mr matthew like i want all the ghosts and it's like i but here's the thing you know we've got a bunch of youth back home and it's like it was kind of like a lot of us like unison half and half out you know and i was like i wanna i'm gonna serve god but i don't wanna do it by myself you know and and what about you said it starts with you drawing and but the joe but joe adams said quit running you know that's what i've been doing i've been just running and running knowing like okay okay to the point where i would i wouldn't go too deep because i knew oh no i i'm gonna be here you know i just kept running you know and and so brother joe said quit running he said it starts with you you you get right and everyone else will follow and so i i spent you know the next i don't know how long just discerning every part you know just all right just just give it all because i put your stuff i couldn't certainly you know i just gave it up and from the next day right the next day kristen my buddy that's what got him here i mean changed him it was special because before that point like before all this but christian me and him got really close as in our unsafe conditions you know really close like like i remember a few weeks back or something i was like christian i just feel like you're my best friend man and you know it's just like we we're in that condition together and it was just it was real nice just that we got saved together to you know and yeah sorry so yeah that happens in pawnee and you can imagine the ride back we're just like this is good and even so it's just and normal okay normally after camps and stuff you know oh you feel good for a little bit and you mess up once you're oh that's god didn't do anything it's like it's not it's not been the same whatsoever whatsoever i mean yeah it's just to the point where it's like i remember i was like one o'clock a.m and i'm doing homework you know for college and because she was like brother brandon said this and i had to go to the table it's just like it's been it's been different really it really has been different and so coming to camp like you know i had our youth group on my heart and stuff and honestly even from the wednesday the wednesday night after party already there's a difference like i saw god working on different ends and it's just it was wonderful to see but yeah youth camp sunday night when i saw you out there sister leslie was in front of me i would have i wouldn't work i was just i was about to flip out i was i was so glad to see you man [Music] you just seeing different people like whoa you all right you know i mean it's been wonderful really right yeah i've i've been different just it's just different so that sounds like that [Applause] i want to hear from sisters zoe loya is she here praise god go ahead and you can come stand up up here sister just so we can be able to see you but i tell you this uh god's moving that's right and and i tell you when the waters stir and step in god's moving right now and so don't just think this this this testimony service is limited just to the people testifying if you want something from god get it while the water's stirring go ahead sister god bless you brothers and sisters um um i just have been in the past i have been like battling so much like in my head because like satan has been like putting terrible things in my head like hurting myself for no reason or like giving me like giving me terrible fears and i've been struggling with this since i was like around 11 and it would like it was terrible and just me coming up here and telling my testimony is is a testimony itself and i don't know where to start um so my mom was telling me about the camp and i told her that i wasn't going and that's final like i wasn't going i was way too scared and but my dad didn't want me to go anyway and i had i just had a lot of homework and i was but my aunt my tia nena she kept telling me oh magda sister mug that um she kept telling my mom or insisting to my mom that i had to go because she had a dream of the services at camp that beautiful dreams about the camp and she just kept telling my mom that i had to go over and over and i right when i told my mom that i didn't want to go i felt my heart i felt my heart sank and like i felt like i was doing a terrible decision and i changed my mind last minute and so i went to camp i was very nervous and i'm when i was at camp i made so many friends and like god has blessed me with very good friends and i've never had any friends that were so close to god and i'm just so thankful for them and i never like understand any preachings i i would always have to ask my mom what the preaching was about but like at the camp i understood everything and like every preaching and like every time we we would pray after the preaching and i would always be shaking like in a bad way and the last time i was shaking i i was shaking a lot and the brothers they put their hands on my head and i just started shaking worse and believe she was right next to me putting her arm right around me and um then i i stopped shaking and i just started shouting praising the lord and i felt this peace and i felt so happy and i i opened my eyes and there was four sisters around me behind me and they were comforting me they were thanking god with me and they helped me get up and i just fell to the floor because my knees were numb and i couldn't even feel my feet touching the floor that's how numb they were and so we waited so my feet got better and i stood up i looked around the church and there was no one there no one except for the four sisters and i was like wow how long have i been here that explains why my knees are so numb and um well they just we all went to go eat lunch i went to go eat lunch with my friends and i just felt satan coming back to my head and put like worse and i did i didn't tell anyone i i wanted to keep it to myself i it was just terrible and i'm so excited to tell y'all um sorry so i just kept it to myself and it was already time to go and we were in the van and we were like we were singing we were laughing so much um but then like they start my my friends started telling their testimonies and i cried a little from happiness because their testimonies are and every time a like someone would tell their own testimony i would like the the voice inside my head got worse and worse and i was just battling more and more and [Music] right when the last girl was telling her testimony i just closed my eyes and i was facing the window and right when she was halfway done i didn't understand a word she was saying and i was just struggling so much and [Music] then they were done and they started singing again and then i bursted out crying and because it was everything um um i just bursted out crying and the girl next to me i'm sorry i forgot your name um she put her hand on my on my arm and i started shaking terribly and i started twitching and like my hands made a form like this but i was i couldn't control it but i was like trying i was trying to cover my face i just didn't want anyone to see me and and then she said sister turn off the radio we're gonna pray for zoe and i my eyes are closed the whole time and i remember feeling arms go all around me like this they were all praying for me they were circling around me we were all in the highway during this and i just started yelling that i i was i couldn't do it anymore and everything was too hard and i was just going to give up and right at that moment while that was happening i kept getting a video in my head that or like an image that kept telling me to like jump out the van in the highway opening the door and jumping out and they they were listening to everything i was saying and then they started praying again and harder and then i stopped shaking i took a deep breath and i started shouting thank you lord and i was i was so happy i felt so free and and um um and i started screaming at satan like go back to hell like [Applause] and i was telling you like you're just a liar that's all you are and the time it passed by so quickly i felt the van like park i thought they stopped at a gas station but we were already parked in church and i was i was still like praising the lord and i couldn't stop thanking him and i felt the van door open and um there was a brother praying for me um sister apr april's husband um and i just i didn't he was praying for me and i i didn't unders i wasn't listening to anything he was saying because like i was just too busy praising the lord and sorry that's all right um then i just i was just so happy then i yells out that i wanted to get baptized and i was just i felt i can't describe the feeling because like it's so great [Music] and so i was i didn't even have like any clothes to wear because i didn't plan any of this so i just grabbed whatever and i was so excited i just threw my stuff in the parking lot i even left my phone laying on the floor and i was i got ready and i was in the water and i wasn't expecting them to give me the microphone and my fam my family knows that like how i get when i talk to a group like this or how i got in the past [Applause] and um they were telling me to tell my testimony and i got nervous i just then i was just telling everyone that i was a little nervous and i wasn't making sense in that what i was saying but like and i was telling then all of a sudden i just told them like i'm not nervous at all anymore and i was telling them that i would get these terrible thoughts in my head and and now i don't have many more thank the lord and i i was just so excited to get baptized i had like i did not make sense in what i was saying and right when i got baptized and i got up i felt like i felt so free i felt so much peace and i felt like i wasn't a slave and i i was so happy glory [Applause] hallelujah and i just till today i i still feel the same i just can't stop praising the lord [Applause] and i feel like telling my testimony to the whole world now god bless you brothers just praise the lord go ahead and praise the lord a little bit hallelujah praise the lord let the redeemed of the lord say so why don't you give god praise let him hear your voice let him hear you give him praise give him honor give him glory he's worthy hallelujah praise his wonderful name lord how we love you how we thank you lord we worship you tonight you're worthy of all praise lord you're worthy of all adoration thank you for what you've done for our sister lord thank you for what you've done for our brothers thank you for what you've done for our family oh god how we love you praise this wonderful name oh glory to god it'd be wonderful oh my in an atmosphere like this what could happen if you've been putting it off this might be your moment amen praise the lord well we'll just open up this opportunity to any of the youth that were at camp that want to testify if you want to maybe lift up your hand all right come forward sister anita you'll be next is there another one praise god we're going to be here all night [Applause] okay so basically before camp it was about a month before camp brother matthew came back from oklahoma camp and he preached a sermon on that wednesday night and i went up for prayer and i just had a desire for just more of god in my life i knew that i had the holy ghost and it was a revelation in my heart but i just wanted to be more visible in my life and i wanted other people to see me like see god in me so i went up for prayer and he spoke directly to me and i believe it was god just speaking directly to me and he just said i actually have i've written down what he said but i wanted to say that till the end he basically just told me that you know there's people in your life that you know you should have witnessed too and there's people in your life right now that you should be witnessing too and god wants you to do that and it was just so amazing to me because i i just been caught i've been feeling called for about like a year now just to be more of a witness and i just wanted more of that in my life so i was just so blessed by that and then my i wasn't even actually i wasn't even planning on going to camp until stellar talked to me like a week and a half before camp and i just like yeah i want to go just all of a sudden so i got in right away without any problems and then i was like okay so i need to be expecting something for camp so my prayer for camp was just that and my prayer before this like before i even knew i was going to camp was just like okay i know i'm going to witness to my friend or my friends the whole world but i just wanted god to be more visible in my life so that they could see god through me so then when i did testify they would know that it was god because they could see my life and i just wanted more of that in my life and i was going to camp for that and for my mom and i just i was expecting so much and the night before camp i read this from the unchangeable god working in an unexpected way it says if you've got the holy ghost take a hold of it like jacob did and hold hold to it until the positive results come amen believe it friends if you will do an unexpected place how much more should he do it tonight in an expected place when we're expecting to see it happen so like that was my quote camp kind of and i would just read that before the services and there's other things too that i was reading and god confirmed it to me but so i was just praying that all through camp and friday night i kind of just got that confirmation that god was in me and that i had the holy spirit but i just and so that was just a piece that i knew that if i had that confirmation god was going to give me more of him and it was going to be something tangible in my life that i could share with others so i went through the prayer line on saturday night with jordan and we went through it together and so i just went through and i was like okay i'm gonna go through for my mom i know that god can give me what i desire for myself but i'm going through from my mom and i know that god will bless me sorry and so i got to through the prayer line and i just accepted everything that i was praying for and so i sat down and jordan sat next to me and she grabbed my hand and i just started breaking down and praying and crying and just asking god to meet my desires and to heal my mom and just other things in my life and so after she just stayed and prayed with me and held my hand and just kept praying with me and after she prayed with me i hugged her and then it was it was just god talking through her i know it was and she was so anointed and she just started talking to me and she was like she said other things but the main thing that stood out to me was if you stand for god he'll stand for you he'll stand for your family he'll stand for your mom you just have to stand for him and she didn't know what i was going to camp for i never told her but it was just so perfect and like i knew that if i obeyed god and told my friends about what he'd done for me then he would bless me and heal my mom and do other things in my life that i wanted so i just took that and that was like that was like what i got from camp and sunday morning service i was just praising him for what he'd done for me and confirming everything for me and then sunday in the car ride um we were just giving our testimonies like zoe said and i realized um when we were telling the testimonies that she wasn't okay like she just seemed like she needed something or i don't know i had the feeling that maybe she didn't get like what she came to camp for or something and so we i didn't i left it alone though i didn't know if she was tired or something and then we started singing and then i saw her she was sitting right next to me to the right of me and um she started shaking and like she said and i told sister laura i said turn off the music we're going to pray for zoe and i just told was telling the whole van that and so i laid my hands on her i was just telling everybody to lay their hands on her and i just started speaking like it was just god in me just speaking and it was so it was so amazing it was just the presence of god came down and it was just so powerful and so proud of all the girls in that fan and just what's what god's sorry what god's doing in their lives too and after she got her victory it was just it was like god confirmed it all over again and it was like that moment that's like that's what i went to camp for it was like i went to camp for god to move visibly in my life and that was that was an answer to my prayer and so that was just so amazing and so i was just rejoicing and then saturday i mean sunday night was just amazing and i just felt so much freedom that i've never felt in my life and it's so amazing and so last night i decided to read because i had written down what brother matthew had told me whenever i went up to prayer like a month ago and i was like oh i should read like what he had told me because i knew like that night that it was god talking to me so i was like oh i better write this down and i'll read to you what it said what and he said you have a purpose in my life i'm you have a purpose no you have a purpose in your life just like esther god placed you in your family with your group of friends with your life experiences for a purpose and he said you're holding back on telling some friends about god god might be waiting to bless you until you do this go up to a friend and say you know what you're such a good friend to me that i want to tell you about the best thing that ever happened to me and monday i told my friend everything that happened to me at camp and i just i'm just waiting for god to move on her i can't do anything but tell her like what god did for me [Applause] i want to read first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12. if they can put that up there for me but i just lord put this scripture on my heart before we started for as the body is one and have many members and all members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and we've been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not of the i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body or an eye where where would be the hearing if a whole we're hearing where would be the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him praise the lord i love to see god using every single part of the body and i think if you just start to open up your heart and say lord use me i'm going to surrender my all or that you can use me god has a purpose in your life amen sister anita if you want to testify praise the lord okay so with me um i remember before camp i had this question in my mind what does it mean to fully surrender like how do you do that and so i remember i was talking to noel i think the night that brother matthew preached because i couldn't go to sleep because i was so happy about what god had done for me that service but then she asked me what are you expecting i was like i want god to do something that he's never done for me in my life so i went to a camp with that expectation and then thursday night the service was preached and something was like go get prayed for because prior to that i was in class and i remember a couple of years back um i went to get my blood drawn and my the doctor came up with the results that i may be pre-diabetic and then when i was really young i was like no i'm not i didn't claim that and then we were in class that week i think was last week and we did the finger printing because i'm in a medical assistant class so we do experience on each other my blood sugar was really high and i was like lord i need your blessed insurance in my life right now i remember back i would build this devil and i'm gonna rebuke it now and so that friday morning i went into the prayer line and i got prayed for and i said lord i believe that you had done something for me and i'm gonna take this healing and i remember prior to that before that i i had to say to myself i was like lord for that confirmation of that healing i want you to say this statement about my healing and now know that indeed you have healed me so service had gone by and then it was all the way towards the end of the service and the word the statement had not been said and two brother team who it was praying he was like lay hands on another have your own prayer line and i just began to pray i poured out everything that i had and he said that exact statement and i began to rejoice because i knew what the lord has done for me but that wasn't all i was like lord i still want more there has to be there has to be more i still want more so even before the prayer line i was kind of like i was scared i was like i don't know where this fear is coming from you know i went through the prayer line but one thing i noticed even after the prayer line i still feel like i didn't fully surrender and something was just like something needed to come out like something needed to come out so i went to sleep and i couldn't that night after the prayer line i couldn't sleep like i tried all that i can do i tried playing some music with my airpods nothing i couldn't sleep and then that morning when i woke up i was really shaky like you know there was like that fear like that panic or like anxiety that was trying to attack me for service i just put on my clothes and i began to walk and it kept on getting worse and then at the door i had asked a couple of dickens to pray for me but again it was like just like i just need prayers i can get through the service and go home and then when the service began they started singing victory is mine but i couldn't form the words to say victory is mine because i didn't feel really free so when somebody was beginning to sing especially i walked outside and i walked out my counselor followed me because i told her i wasn't feeling good and it was an anxiety attack that began attacking me that panic attack everything and then that's when brother joe adams when he was he was standing on the other side of the building he came over and he began to pray and at that moment i could hear that spirit saying i want her i came to say it all over again i want her and then what's the joy adam said why it's like because i know that she's a walking testimony that's why i want her and it's me i was like i don't want this spirit in me i want to be free and so we prayed out and exposed every single thing from the chat from the time i was a child growing up exposing every single thing that has ever attacked me off and i felt really free that god has indeed delivered me and that morning i had written something in my journal like that service because i couldn't even open my bible to read it i'd written something inside of it and i'm going to read it it was like dear lord i believe that you did something for me this camp lord i rebuked that devil that would try to bring any fear in me having me bound father let your word come and speak to me this sunday today lord thank you for all that you've done for me may the service on this last day really speak to me my needs whatever you have for me lord cleanse me to every worldly fiber is burnt out of me and that's my testimony and i just went back in i was just rejoicing and i remember at the end of the service where the angel spencer said the lord assuming to give it each and every young person another chance and that time i was like i'm gonna claim that i'm gonna i'm gonna claim that god did something for me and i'm gonna stomp on that devil's head and let him know that god did something for me [Applause] and so i remember i got back home you know even after the amazing evening service he came back he was trying to battle me he's like you really didn't get that deliverance i was like yes i did i got that deliverance and he kept inviting me all day monday and yesterday it was even worse even today and i was like i was trying to rebuke i was like you know what instead of trying to say the devil is putting this thing in my mind he's doing this let me just start praising the lord for what he's done for me and so this afternoon this afternoon i went to pick up my brother and so as i was he had gone inside and i stayed in the car for a little bit and as i was walking in the house i looked at my phone and it was a notification from lifeline and it said you are free and to me that was my confirmation i was like god is really mindful and so i clicked on it says the price that was paid and the bondage of satan was broke god put it back into the hands of man a way back to what he was looking for he had to weep no more hit when he broke the backbone of satan there at calvary the backbone of sin and sickness and it brings every mortal being on earth back into the presence of god with the sins forgiven hallelujah our sins are forgiven no one can satan black herself from god there's a highway made there's a telephone sitting there there's a line to glory brings every person in reach of that line if a man is full of sin it connected him on central he can be forgiven of that sin not only that but his sin is paid off or you don't have to say i'm not worthy sure you're not you could never be better where the one took your place you are free you don't have to wonder anymore you don't have to be a pleasure seeking men out there on the earth for there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty sins you don't have to be lost there's a highway and a way and it's called a way of holiness the unclean don't pass over it for he comes to the mountain first and then he enters the highway [Applause] oh i just love that boy praise god for the message these testimonies do not exist without the message of the hour oh call me a fanatic call me crazy but god sent the message of the hour to redeem his bride and that's what you do you take him back to the word that's what every single one of you do whenever that devil starts running his mouth he says shut up devil take him back to this message the absolute you are free who the son has made free is free indeed oh you're free church free to praise them free to worship them hallelujah free to stomp on the devil's hands glory sister if you want to come up and testify oh praise god sorry i'm so nervous give me a minute okay so it's like months before camp and i'm just like oh camp youth camp is coming up and you know the lord was just like keep feeding anita you know you're working really hard in school just keep feeding you know the lord will do something for you and we get to camp and we go through the prayer line and i'm with my friends to be honest with you i didn't even go to camp for i feel like i just didn't go to camp for the lord i went just you know friends and thank you and just seeing one another and you know i just think about like how thursday night brother donnie was like he was talking about how like when we like keep like i'm sorry when we hear the word and it's just like we leave out the main thing and i just think about how i went to camp and i'm just like leaving out the main thing and i was just like lord just just help me lord you know and so saturday night we go through the prayer line and to see my friends you know go through and just see the different ones delivered and set free and just feel like all those times you know i've just been feeding and praying it's really been paying off and it's just such a great effect on my friends when the lord does something for someone he's obligated to do it justice he delivered me from that fear that i've been dealing with that's right now i just want to continue just leaving for my mom i just want to keep continuing from [Music] believing for my mom and i just encourage you all to just keep pressing the lord truly he's gonna be wonderful god is so good and he's so wonderful to us praise his wonderful name prayer changes things prayer changes things amen hallelujah another which i know some sisters put up their hands sister jordan so my testimony is kind of about ella a little bit so um you know i don't even know what i'm gonna say sorry um but like i just been asking god to move in my life personally like with my friends and stuff it's good to see the lord working in other people but i want to see him working in me and i know brother david talks about like that still small voice that's guiding you and stuff like that and i almost didn't go to camp because of an exam and my teacher said i couldn't take it early and i couldn't take it late and then she got bronchitis so it got moved [Applause] [Music] [Music] so ella told me she was going and i got so excited i don't know why i was like i was going to camp i want to go to camp like i really want to go to camp and so that saturday night before we went to the like saturday night service we ended up sitting by each other and the whole time we were about to go to the prayer line and i was like lord i want to be right by ella like the whole time i just wanted ella right behind me the whole time and i didn't know why and so i didn't really go to camp with anything exactly on my mind so i was just praying for other people praying for my friends and so we would get separated and then we'd get back together and so after the prayer line i went through and i didn't have a single thought in my mind just like thank you lord for all you've done and so immediately after we sat down i just started praying with her and just so much just came in my mind you know to say to her and after all that it was like just let me use you how i want to you don't have to look for anything big you know you might not go out and sing or you know tell it you know but just let me use you how i want to use you and that will be more beneficial than you just doing it on your own and so i was so thankful that the lord likes still using me and so then we came home sunday night and the ministers had been preaching about how your dances are like it comes after victory and so um sunday night we were singing um just call him up and i was like lord i want to praise you for my victory i want my victory dance and just sitting in my seat such a presence came over me and i just started dancing for the lord and i got my victory so i'm thankful for that [Applause] i tell you what the devil made me do a lot of crazy things when i was out in the world and so i figured you know what if i gave the devil that much when i was out there serving him why can't i give my altar when i'm serving the lord i want to give him everything give him my voice give him my hands give him my feet give him my mind whatever it is that's wonderful to hear god using each one of you in such a mighty way is there another one that was at camp praise the lord i didn't plan on testifying but i want to give this to the glory of god i went to camp not really having anything specific in my mind just knowing because i've gone so many years that like just knowing that when you're in the presence of the lord he's gonna do something for you so i just went with like an open mind an open heart um one thing like that i was struggling with a lot is like feelings of unworthiness and like i believe i have the holy ghost but i would just maybe like not live up to where i knew i could live and then i would just start to feel so unworthy um i think it was i don't even remember what service it was but um i didn't even need a warm-up service like the first service that we got there i just um renounced that and i um just resurrended my life to god again and just felt like a peace and just knowing that i'm not the person who is doing this on my own just surrender everything to him and he'll live through me and i just um got that peace um but there was still something on my heart like john testified i'm so happy to see like what god did for him and with christian and just watching that change and then when they got back from camp but for me like i had another burden on my heart for for israel um because he yeah he just hasn't been going the right way and um so i went up to the prayer line for that because i already felt like god gave me what i needed and i just that was like the thing that was on my mind in my heart so i went up to the prayer line and i went through and i already like i felt like i had faith so like i went through and i didn't think i didn't think of it and i was like praise god like i you know i believe that um well after camp so camp goes by the services were amazing and also i just want to insert here that brother ron said something that kind of spoke to what i was talking about about unworthiness he says the devil wants you to feel unworthy because he knows the power you have like like camp was a lot about that about like us stepping into what god has for us and not like listening to the devil's eyes and yeah so anyways so fast forward camp is over and we were supposed to leave on sunday afternoon um but like one of my friends had the idea like why don't you just stay the extra day so um i ended up staying and coming back monday but that sunday night there was like a fellowship at a brother's house from the church in louisiana and like it was amazing we were just worshiping the lord and then at one point um we were just all singing and then a brother comes in and he kind of like has a serious face like his mood is immediately just he walks in it's just like you can tell like what's happening and he says if you need something from god now is the time the waters being stirred outside and they were having a prayer line in the front yard and i just i felt like i had what i needed but in the moment when he said that i was like i'm just gonna go out again and so i went to the like i went to the prayer line that was outside um and then i kind of stepped out to pray with a friend and then i came back and i just had israel on my heart again and i was thinking to myself like maybe like when he said that like if you need something from god that waters me right now i said maybe god had me say an extra day for this purpose like to claim that right and the two brothers that were playing praying in the prayer line like praying for people they know israel personally and they've like seen his life and so when i go up there and i tell him like what i'm praying for brother joe adams is like i know him and i know like he just kind of spoke really encouraging words and um i was thinking about the another testimony that i've heard where there's another sister praying for her brother and then that night he like runs into service in his pajamas and gives his heart to the lord and i was just thinking to myself like if god can do that like he can do that for for israel he can do that for anybody and i just had faith about it i just i really didn't have any doubt i just kind of wanted to like nail it in there and so like uh brother joe adams said um may you find it even as you said right and then i come back from um yeah so i was just like amen and even though like even though we don't feel it he's working and i just believe that like it'll be as as he said as i he said according to your faith like let it be as you said and i and i just claimed that and i just wanted to say that and give glory to god [Applause] you ask anything in my name i will do it [Music] go ahead brother um god bless you um well when i went to camp um kind of like my sister said i kind of just went for like my friends and stuff i didn't really have like anything on my heart or like i just went for my friends hoping that because for the longest time i didn't have a lot of friends to be honest i just went to church a lot of them have to go inside of my car afterwards and just sit there and be like oh god's not giving me any friends why should i go outside and be like oh go worship and stuff but i remember um the pastor was talking and he was like oh you go to church and you worship god and then through listening to what what god has to say then friends and everything would follow after she was like i was like you know what i'm just gonna try i'm gonna go to start like praising the lord you know i'm gonna pray i prayed and praying a lot for my mom my family and for some reason just felt like nothing was working i saw my brother i really look up to him i i don't tell him this a lot but i see him and i'll say he's praising the lord i see him anita and i see a lot of other people and it's just like how come i can i can't do like i feel like i'm doing it but like i feel like it's not real i'm just faking everything and a lot of times the devil will be like oh like when you do have like you feel something god did something for you it's just like oh no that was a feeling i've been to last year i think it wasn't like a camp it was just like i think it was just the easter meetings we stayed in like a hotel um i was watching um like everybody go to the prayer line and everything and i was just like for some reason the devil kept on telling me that oh oh they're just doing that all because of emotion it's not real i would just sit there be like oh you know i don't have to go over there and just fake it so i just sit down and just i just didn't think it was real [Music] um this camp um i went um again i was just going for the friends but when i was inside of the camp um one of my friends was like oh one of my friends was like oh well actually before this when i was at church like the pastor was like oh go beyond the camp and i really was like you know let me pray before i leave and just see like i didn't unders to be honest i didn't really understand what he meant by go beyond the camp just like let's let me pray and see like what god can do so basically for me to go beyond the camp let me just try to do something i wanted to get something out of this camp experience so when i did go um one of my friends told me oh that for this camp i really want to change um his name was ben by the way um and eventually like towards the end of camp i thought he was just like one of those laid-back people he got baptized and i was just really moved by that that god can move through somebody and i just feel like god really moved to me this this time going i went to the prayer line thinking that nothing was going to happen eventually same as last year i went through and seeing all those people while i was in the prayer line going through i saw like all these people coming out like crying and bald i just i just thought it was all fake again the devil was telling me it was all fake um but when i got there when i eventually got through the prayer line what i felt just it wasn't fake i knew it was real i knew something was happening [Applause] i just want to thank the lord even seeing some of my friends like christian and um seeing christian and um john testify just i i never thought that would happen but it's really it's really it's really great to see so i'm just like i was like you know if they can do it let me come up and test drive seeing my sister testify really moved me again and you know it just see me being here like i'm not really if you know me i'm not really like i don't like crying in front of people i'm usually laughing half the time but you know i just really felt obligated to come up and tell you guys my testimony since i did see everybody else saying [Applause] and i just wanted to thank you guys and i guess that's it [Applause] yep he can tell you it's fake all he wants but when it becomes real you got the real thing he's the one that's fake he just flat he just flaps his gums he's just a liar he's just a bluff oh my praise god well this this this might be dangerous but i want to say this and i'm going to direct it towards towards those youth that were at camp but if if god if you feel something on your heart to say something and you don't you're going to regret it and so this i'm going to give you an opportunity to raise your hand right now well i mean she's she just she's she's she's excited over there i have to say something like that nobody's been fighting me about it so i just i just know i have to say something so the lord placed like a scripture on my heart which is isaiah 59 19-21 which is so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the son when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up the standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression and jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth and forever so for camp i just i really just wanted a revelation of my freedom in christ and like i know i have the holy spirit and i know that the lord has delivered me from a lot of things and certain things and but there would still like come like thoughts of like doubt or like the devil would come and be like i'm going to get you again or i'm going to get you to do something again and even in my dreams and different things like just tormenting me and so god confirmed to me of that revelation and it was really unexpected for me because usually everyone is an expectation for saturday night and he did it for me friday night and i was just i was so blessed and i was just rejoicing in the lord and even afterwards the devil would come and like tell me like you know it was all emotional you're just you know he didn't really get anything and i just pray all night and in the morning all of those doubts and all those questions kind of went away and so i just want to testify you know the lord is good and he's faithful and he keeps his promises [Applause] praise the lord we'll go ahead and come up here come on up wait everybody wants to be able to see you come on up you got you got something to talk about go ahead [Applause] hey we're all like the woman at the well come see a man we we got something to talk about god bless you soon god bless you but i just wanted to testify that the lord touched my family so um my brothers have been such um had such a burden on my heart for my brothers and uh since the quarantine they have been slipping away i can see it in their lives just slowly backsliding and seeing your family in sin is so so painful and i never just spoke out about it i never like corrected them because my voice i've just been so silent and um but during camp um it was saturday night i there was a prayer line and i wanted to to go in the prayer line for them but something told me to wait and just to get my heart where i get my spirit right and um so i decided to wait and i worshiped i praised and usually when i sing i sing with like just sound nice with the church to you know be in harmony sound good you know but that service i truly i i had a desperate cry like they say bright blind bartimaeus he had a desperate cry and the lord heard him and i truly poured out my heart i sang with all my heart um i stayed until my voice was hoarse to my i couldn't sing i couldn't sing no more and um and i just saw my brother go up my older brother and go up in the line and just seeing that just put a spark in my heart and i praised i said lord because that's what i was praying for just something something small it doesn't matter lord just something anything to push him towards you and he went in that line and i believe he received something and um i wanted i still wanted to go and i thought my heart kept telling me to wait so i kept praising and worshiping and worshiping and worshiping and my um i saw my little brother go on the line and i said okay now i have to go i have to go so i went up to him i went up in the prayer line and there is this brother brother ron spencer he uh he has a spirit of discernment and he he spoke to me he pulled me aside and he said he saw angels all around me and that just opened my eyes to how spiritual this really all this is like how real and i've never like rejoiced and praised like like danced for the lord but my heart was lit up with joy and i truly worship and praise god and that's i have another testimony like my heart has a song in it now like i have a praise i no longer care like what how i praise or what people think my voice doesn't sound good i was keep singing i'll keep singing i'm just so so grateful and thankful and thankful that the lord touched my brothers ariel was baptized and that that just touched me tremendously because he was there was a point where you you couldn't see you can't there's no like i don't know there's no there's there was no hope but there's always hope there's always there's always always something and the lord just gave me something to hold on to and i believe for my brothers i'll stand in that junction for them that they both will completely receive the lord and please keep praying [Applause] god bless you if i'm going to do this right i have to start from the beginning so let's go back to 20 2018 let's go back to 2018 that's far enough i mean we when we went to camp those years we went for the boys we didn't we didn't go for the word we you know the first time i remember brother billy like i have i don't tell him enough but i'm going to give him his flowers right now but one day he came to the house and he talked to my parents and said i want to take your kids to church this is when we first started coming here and he brought us here and camp was around the corner and uh brother billy had a burn on his heart for us to attend camp so he made a way for me and my brother to attend and at that time if you knew me there was one thing on my mind and one thing only basketball that's it no god no nothing just sports that's all i cared about i went to camp i watched people act a fool to me it didn't make sense like when everybody would get up to to clap or to praise or raise their hands and sing i did it because you know the dude left next to me did it so i was like well you know let me look spiritual too hallelujah but you can't fake that you don't know what you're asking for so there i am just going through the motions going through everything and in that moment the minister said something if you know my favorite is lebron and he said well he calls himself a king but he's not my king and i said have i made him a king without knowing that i made him a king and in that moment i can honestly say the work of the lord began in my life at that moment and it kept going so much so i would sacrifice i used to sacrifice coming to church to go to tournaments to go to games i started sacrificing my games and tournaments to come to church i realized that there's more importance in me being here and present than me being playing sports out for a team they may need me but god needs me more in fact the prophet said you can't make it without me all of them got to get there and i'm a part of that and the lord just kept working he kept working and working and working and brother david he would always throw these like slight comments at me like he he never forced me out into anything but he would throw like jabs he asked me one time he said would you give it up for god if god asked i answered yes but in my heart i knew i wasn't but i said yes and my junior year in high school the seniors leave and the seniors the season's over we go to playoffs we broke the school record and district records and they left and i cried i felt sad inside because i watched the people that i played basketball with who became my brothers leave and go to the next level and i was there well with my teammates that were still there and my dad gave me a comment he said son you'll cry for basketball you'll be sad for basketball your mood will change for basketball but for your own salvation you don't shed a tear nothing i said wow these hurt i started i started to feel it and that burning desire came in my heart and in 20 and i think it was 2018 2019 when you took us to pawnee camp wouldn't it i think so i had a burning desire in my heart i said god if you don't give me the holy ghost i'm gonna stay at that altar i'm not leaving if i gotta sleep there i'm asleep there but i'm not getting up till you give me something i would watch everybody else cry i'm not an emotional person even at funerals i feel the pain inside but you i don't cry i'm not a crier it's just not in my nature but i said lord everybody else cries something got to be wrong with me because if they're crying and i don't cry something's wrong i thank god for the chaperones and the work that they do for the sacrifice for getting us to camps it's more than just taking us there but they're present in the moment they're with us i went to the altar brother andrew glover was preaching and i i got on my knees and i prayed i tried i forced i tried enforced and forced myself to cry and not a tear came i said lord something's wrong like i i want to give myself to you but i can't i just can't i don't know what it is i don't know what spoke to brother cosman i don't know what it was but there i was praying brother cosmic comes around he puts his arm around me and all he said was oh god that was it i became a baby in that moment that i felt a peace like you can't even describe what kind of peace that was and right then in that moment i started to realize there was more value in me going division one in god's school than going division one in the world you can have the fame you can have the money you can have all that without god you have nothing god just kept working and working one day i got the chance i got the scholarship to go to penn state and go play basketball over there i had the opportunity one day i'm i'm on my way i'm on my way there they already planned for for me to take a flight to go over there to visit the school and everything and the next day i walked to my coach and say coach i'm giving it up i don't want to play anymore i want to serve the lord at your age why are you worried about your salvation at such a young age this is the same coach that i had we prayed every game we did the lord's prayer held hands in that moment he said why would you worry about salvation at such a young age i said if i go tomorrow young don't mean nothing it's now all you have is now there's no tomorrow yesterday's gone present tense god is what we serve i said lord i'll give it all to you i don't know what it is but i'll give it all to you but even then there was the love i had for the word of god beginning then just kept growing and growing and growing see the scripture says grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption but i would always hear that when you get the holy spirit you become this perfect person that there's no wrong in you you'll never commit a fault you'll always be just there won't be times where you start to take a step back but you wouldn't grieve something that makes you perfect that's that's that part grieving it and it condemning you make making you get back to the altar repent give it all up again it's a constant thing paul said i died daily not one time that started becoming a reality in me i said lord what are you doing to me then fast forward to now i i watched myself i sacrificed so much to make sure i was at camps to make sure i was at any any special event service i made sure i was there i can tell you god never disappointed so much so this year i have class with jordan that same class with that same teacher she asked that she said well do you think she'd let us take the class to take the test early i said well whether she does or not that's kind of doing me i'm not going to be here so so she asked she asked her and she says no no i can't i can't i said well i'm going to be at church you sure you can't change it he's like no no i can't i said well i'm going to see when i get back church is more important to me than than taking the test grant is an important test but i just felt there's something more important than that then that thursday i find out she's sick she sends us a text and says well i have bronchitis and some other diseases or i'll be i won't be in class i said lord you work in mysterious ways but thank god thank god for that [Music] and then we go to camp we're in the van i'm listening to marriage of the lamb when i say listening to going beyond the camp and then jules is listening to another sermon and we all stop simultaneously and started fellowshipping about how much we are not up to par with what god requires of us there is a space brother brandon says it's the worst space for a believer where you think you're living right you think you're where you're supposed to be at and you're far from it there i was i was honest with myself and then when i said lord i'm nowhere near where i'm supposed to be he said he gave us back what adam forsook but i don't i'm not living up to that standard so what's the what's the issue what's the problem and i i can't i can't explain to you but the expectation that i had in that moment for what god was going to do at camp i can't describe it to you we we sat there the first service thursday night i left early i didn't eat breakfast i missed a lot of meals during camp because i wanted to be in church early take that time to spend it with the lord feed on the word and make sure that i got what i came for first service that can testify to it brother donnie he felt like he stabbed each of us everything we talked about in that car he hit from beginning to end and they just kept going and going and going now it's just a prayer line night i see ariel sitting down we are all walking to get into the prayer line in my heart this is the first time saying it to anybody in my heart i said lord touch him i didn't understand everybody else this is the moment people have where you meet god you can say it's emotion you can call it what you want but when you when the waters are stirred you you can't sit still you're going to miss it i said lord do something for him i i just closed my eyes i walked through the prayer line and after i got done you know everybody you know i just i've realized i've grown and understood that my nature isn't to be one that cries all the time or to be so i can't explain it but i know when god's done something for me i went through the prayer line i go to the altar and i'm praying and as i pray i see daniel come next to me and he's bawling like a baby like he's crying saying oh god i give it all to you i know a little bit of what's going on in his life you're about to go to college the the that life of college and everything to hear him at that altar praying like that i said lord you are working put my arms around him started praying for him i got up i went back to my seat then i see ariel walk in that line i said hallelujah god's gonna do something great for him and i watched god work and throughout every single service i kid you not it's almost like i could tell you verbatim what was said everything that was said went down and sunk on the inside see i've had i have her sister brother david quite frequently a lot of questions more so but one thing brother david always tells me he says in the midst of everything you can come to somebody and say well i can't i saw this person do this this person do that but what did he do for you you got to have something that god does for you you can't always be preaching somebody else's testimony they want to hear what god did for you what's good is it to say god is alive but in your life it's not seen something's wrong so then when i said lord what have you done for me what is it that you've given me and brother ron said something and it hit me he said me in this cancerous body that i have if i can serve god a hundred percent how much more you i said lord that's he's he's walking and he's death is in front of him yet he gives everything he has to god everything i said lord am i not giving it all to you i felt so unworthy isn't the word but i felt like ashamed of the person that i had been i'd been running from a calling in my life that i felt since i was a kid i ran and i ran and i ran and i ran and sometimes in my mind now i still think i'm running but i can't run from it when god calls you to do something he will show you that's your calling i used to think well i i i'm not the best person to do this this that and the other in the third but then a brother told me a quote he said god doesn't call the equipped he equips the cult wow now i really can't run like i can but brother david tells me all the time so what one of these days you're gonna you preach this priest down like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that that's that's cool that's cool but in that moment i realized everybody wants this ministry but there's souls that are out there and the highways and byways that nobody is looking out for we i said something to her brother i said what good does it do for us to have this holy spirit and to have this message and not share it we're selfish you say you're a messed believer you say you have the life you have the power but what good and then brother donna reagan speaks about it you have a bottle it's not the bottle it's the contents of the bottle but what good does the bottle do if it's not given to somebody it's a constant refilling if somebody's in need of water you have a cup full of water praise the lord but give it to him and we have the living waters of life and we keep it to ourselves something's wrong there's people out there that are in need of this and in that moment at camp god spoke to me he's always done i went to prayer line i said god if you just tell me this one statement i'll know it's you time after time he says it you're called i'm like well that's not good enough i need something else but you're gonna always need something else until you step into what it is god's called you to do and you do it my testimony to you god gave me a blessed assurance that when he tells me to do something and i do it he's right there to put his foot right behind to confirm that that's what god wants me to be doing i watched just how much this youth changed in a moment in a moment from one way to another you want that to keep going keep feeding it's an experience it's amazing it's you can't even explain it but if you don't feed that experience you're going to let the devil rob it from you that's what we don't want to happen we want to keep pressing and pressing forward and keep going and going we have to see a rapture somehow so we got to feed god bless your saints [Applause] if the pastor lets us we'll just go on all night so we're we're here we're here amen hey man well our sister's standing so right after her testimony we'll have brother gregory testify go ahead and come on up that way everybody can see you sister we don't want no one getting any cramps in their neck god bless you god bless y'all try not to be long but um since i was four i was introduced to many spirits that had that have taken a hold into my life and it was very hard for me to shake it and get rid of it but for the most part for most of my life i really didn't try to i just felt like because those spirits came at me at such a young age i i just feel like it grew on to me and the way i felt throughout the past like 10 years is that this is just who i am and you know like the devil would speak to me in my mind and i would just i would hear it as my own voice as if i was speaking to myself and i would just hear evil things and evil whispers and it was just i didn't it came to a point where i didn't even think it was the devil it was just me and i suffered for a long time in silence and i never had the strength to talk to anyone and i thank god for my father because he speaks to us about the word of god every single day and has always encouraged us to look for more and to seek the word of god in the kingdom of the lord because it will do great things for you and i've seen him moving his life and my family's life in i just didn't think i just didn't think i was worthy of holding such greatness and such like grace and mercy that he has in other people's life because since i was so young this is all i've known all these evil things that have come in contact to me and i knew how to get i knew that if i just prayed or if i just went to meetings or went to prayer lines would get away but i was never strong enough to confess even to myself even to the word of god to even to god that this is what i'm dealing with that i have these spirits taunting me it was just i just began to live with it and i would go through prayer lines and it would just speak it into my heart and it came to a point where i just felt like well if this is just how i'm living then i just might as well stay this way like you know i just kept wearing you know i just kept trying my best to act godly and look godly because you know rather be safe than sorry but it was just really hard for me to open up and talk about these things because i just didn't feel like no one would understand me and once again i just felt like it was me like i it came it was really bad it was really dark bad place and i grew up with it i didn't know anything else and i couldn't speak to anyone because i was so ashamed of myself i just didn't feel worthy by any means but you know i just kept pushing on i guess i just i there was times where i would feel like god was would speak to me to try to get me out of this place but i would run away from the word of god i would run away from reading my bible listening to tapes and all these kinds and just trying to feed my heart to get out of the place that i was but and then there was other times where i just felt like he wasn't speaking to me and that gave me more confidence i guess to stray away and just not even try because again i didn't feel like i deserved salvation or that i deserve grace or anything of that matter but i just want to say just before i even get deeper that if you are suffering in silence to just speak to someone just speak to someone because it's not a good place to be no matter how small the issue is it's not it's not an inconvenience for god so just find someone to speak to and get it off your chest at least because i want to let me i went 11 years since i was 4 years old and more events and just horrible things just kept piling on to my trauma and i couldn't i just couldn't shake it away so this year for camp i just i was talking to noel i think it was right before we had practice that thursday and i just asked her what she was expecting and like she said for a revelation and reassurance and then i told her that i just wanted deliverance and i wanted healing and disclosure what has started my trauma and so i can just be delivered completely from everything that was traumatizing me because i was just so tired of living that way and and it was just a long time of darkness that i just didn't see myself being out of it i just didn't i just didn't feel like the lord loved me enough to help me and in my own small ways i've tried to pray myself out of this life but it was just i just did it it wasn't working but it was now that i look back it's the small things that even brought me here the daily devotions with my family just friends like our youth just speaking to you and you know them randomly randomly coming up to you and saying i'm praying for you and stuff like that just people reaching out and being kind and i just thank god for our youth and for our pastor of course and just anyone who has ever touched me because i would i don't think i would have been here today i don't think i would have and if i didn't go to camp i probably would have never spoken up to the people who were praying for me but i just um so as the days went on we were at camp and the sermons were speaking to me and i could just feel myself wanting to just come in contact with god even if it was just for a minute or for a second i just wanted change in just some kind of way and i just knew that i just knew that it was mine and i couldn't and no one could take it away from me since i was young my father would tell me that god gave me to him and that no one could ever take me away from him so the same way i came from god i would go right back and i would hold that resource but then again i never really felt that that was mine to claim because i didn't feel worthy so i just kept that into my heart throughout the meetings and as i went up there for the prayer line i was just praying and praying and as i was we were walking up there i could just feel and i could hear the devil just trying to come to me and discourage me and tell me you know you're not going to get it you're just going to walk through and it's going to be fine and you're just going to go back to where that you're living in that moment i just told god i just said if i let me walk through that prayer line and feel something even if i don't shout or if i don't dance let me just feel something that i know that you're still with me even if i don't if i'm not delivered to not at least at least i know that you're next to me or anything i just wanted to feel something of god whether he was little or not so i was i was walking through the prayer line i didn't even get to like the second minister i just broke down out of school screaming like get him out of me get him out of me get him out of me i just couldn't i just i was just i just been tired for so long of suffering in such darkness and having no one to speak to and um going to the prayer line and they had brought me in the back and they were praying for me and even even in that moment i could just feel the darkness that was inside of me just trying to keep a hold on to me and just trying to remind me of my trauma and the traumas that i was going through just kept playing back there was even some that i had just pushed away because i had the tendency of going through things just pushing it back because i just there was just no reason to keep thinking about them but they were praying for me they're telling me to speak and confess to what you're going through and i was trying and i was trying to speak and it was just really hard for me to get those things out and i remember everything vividly um i could go relive it again but it was just i just kept trying to speak it out and go through and there was things that i had went through that i had again pushed back that was starting to come back throughout that throughout that moment and i just remembered i just remember um brother matthew telling me to look at him and i and again i was struggling once again but he got me to look at him and then he told me he told me to just speak the name of jesus then just leave it up to god and i again i was just so tired i was just so tired and i just i knew that i just couldn't go through this type of life i just couldn't go through that life again and again i had told i told god to just let me feel him for a little bit so it was already a blessing that i was going through that prayer with the other ministers in the back but it was that those that hour in the back was such a battle itself and he just told me to be the name of jesus and i just kept we were there for a while we were there for a while trying to help me out and after a couple of minutes of struggling with me i i just felt all this weight lifted off my sweaters all of the darkness that the darkness that i was in i just saw light immediately i just want to thank the lord because i don't think if i didn't go to camp i would have received what i came there for and i just know that i am destined for heaven and i am destined for god [Applause] yeah so if you're sitting or you're suffering in darkness find someone you can even speak to me and we'll just we can just get through this together because once again the youth itself we've grown tremendously through the past week and if god can move in four days you know we don't know how much time we have left on this earth we could be a year or a week but if he can work in four days and i promise you he could work in a month if he comes in a month and even through this service just keep pressing on and keep pushing on and believe in god that he will help you and if you feel yourself in that darkness just reach out to someone and reach out to god read your bible listen to sermons do anything everything you everything the devil tells you you can't do that's right that you shouldn't do that you should put that put away for later do it go against him cast him out just stand by god because he'll stand with you and even if you don't feel like he's with you he's with you and he'll always be i just want to thank thank the lord once again for delivering me from that place that i was in and i now know where i'm supposed to be yes and i know that the devil can't pluck me from amen [Applause] hallelujah oh praise his wonderful name hallelujah my goodness oh you don't know how excited i am to hear that testimony our god is real oh my i said something that's been burning on my heart is is is i would encourage you at at some time if you can't listen to oneness of unity i believe brother branham preaches that in 54. and he talks about how he said you know the problem the problem of it is and he talks about even billy graham he says he has a message to get everybody delivered or repented he said but the problem is he doesn't have a message to get people filled up and he said the problem is is we're getting people repented and cleaned up he said but but what it is is you can the evangelist might come along and and you know cast the spirits off of you and get you all cleaned up and everything but then that spirit wanders and he comes back with seven words he said but we but oh i might as well just read it won't be long be just just just one little quote i had a lot more but but we ain't got time for that but he says he said and i say tonight that a greater than solomon is here it's the person of christ it's the holy ghost performing and working producing in the human life just as he did here god made you a place that you that could be emptied now you can't just polish the old life you can't give the old life a facelift she has got to die and a new life be born in her she don't need some manicure or what it is you put on your lips the woman you know do and you know to make her look better she don't need a hair curling she don't need a lip stuff the church needs a birth and a feeling of the holy ghost amen and i i i'm just rejoicing to see the work of god delivering and and now i say to each one of you continue in that and be filled with the holy ghost it's for you amen is there somebody else that just can't sit still well you you've been waiting a while and then brother gary can't sit still go ahead try to get did this the best i can without crying but um so before camp i uh i was so busy with school and i couldn't go and you know they're just like the last couple months i felt just lukewarm and like i just was going i just feel like i was going to like the motion that church you know just like ben said raised my hands because other people were and you know i was just you know i just felt lukewarm and i didn't fall even like when i would pray i just felt like god was distant and um before i camp i i just was like lord you know i have so much on my plate and you know i i don't know if i'll be able to make it and so like it was i think the week before i um i just you know i just i resolved in my heart to go and that first night um i didn't quite enter in until probably friday uh friday the first service there were so many things that stood out to me brother andrew probably the three things he said one was i think when there's two sides fighting for you god and satan then that must mean that you're worth something and then the other one was there must be something about you getting up whenever satan tries to bring you down so much and that really you know stood out to me because you know these past couple months i um he's been really trying to pull at my heart you know saying you know this isn't for you you know you don't have the holy ghost and i um i was really struggling this past couple months even up to camp night the first night i uh i was just like lord you know why am i here like i'm not i didn't really come expecting anything um the first night and then whenever the weekend came and they brother um ron spoke you know he every time i every time i get to watch him preach you know i get so emotional because like that man's fighting like so much and i i just it's always sitting there you know just listening to him preach and um and then whenever the purl line came i uh they were like all right we're going to start the pro line right now and i was like one of the first ones there and i was like all right lord like i don't like past you know i would go through and all i would get was like maybe a cry you know bawl my eyes out and then like brother donny i think this past fall he preached going back home so like i would get the victory and then money came like it was like satan just like gave you like a sucker punch in the face and was like you thought you had something so i was like all right lord like i mean i don't want this to be like any other you know weekend i want to get something and so i went through there and i um [Music] i was just like lord i hand all my problems to you everything that i you know struggle with i hadn't put all in your hands and i you know i had all these people in my heart brother christian and everyone else they've been on my heart for a long time and i was like lord you know i need you to do something and i uh i went through and like i i got through like maybe five people and i um i felt something probably never felt in my life i just like immediately like got numb and like my legs and my arms and everything and um i probably stood about i don't know 45 minutes to an hour in the chair just like restless and i could still hear people like praying and stuff i just couldn't move and i couldn't um i was just like just super still and then brother chris you know he came up to me and he was like are you okay dude and i just was like staring at him like i couldn't even talk i was so out of it and i uh i i was like lord you know i really i really feel like he touched me that night and i um like i don't know like i felt a joy like come over me like never before at peace and you know by the way it's my mom's 40th birthday and i just want to i just want to say that you know she prays for us a lot she's asked for because um even the night whenever i got back you know the song came in my heart when god ran by i don't know if you've heard it um i just like kept playing over and over my head and i uh i really think that he ran to me that night and the prayer line and so you know i just want to um encourage kelly and everyone else that it doesn't matter how far they stray and um god will bring them back because um you know i dealt with so much stuff in my past and i uh even this past couple months you know i was battling a lot and like i said i would just lukewarm and people would come up to me like you know what happened to you like you used to be all like into service and um clapping and praising god and you just look like a different person and they weren't talking about the good and i was like okay well i mean and i would just go on and then um i uh but going to camp like i i knew i needed the holy ghost and i was just like lord you know i would ask for stuff and then you know i felt good in the presence of god but then once i would go back home and then it's like the devil just attacked me and i um you know i struggle with you know so many things in my past and i just didn't get rid of those things and i uh i was just like lord you know i need this to be a different circumstance i need you to touch me forever and so um i i just you know went through there that night and then brother ron uh preached and he's made a comment i think ben already said something about how you know if i can do what i'm doing whenever i'm fighting um how much more you and that really you know encouraging me um because i know i'm not fighting as hard as he's fighting but yet you know it doesn't matter you know what we're going through god always hears the cries of those that are praying for you and you know it doesn't matter how far they stray god will god will pull them to himself even the fact that i'm here today i um i wouldn't get really nervous to even like talk to people and everything and i um i was like lord you know i wouldn't even really be like talk to people or like want to see them or like even be their friend and stuff which i mean i guess people that know me think that i'm pretty friendly but i felt like you in these past couple months like i've been so like you know just to all to myself and alone and everything and then i saw christian you know these past couple months and i was like man i don't know what's going on with that dude but oh my god he received something at that camp and i was like i need to step up my game or something because if he if he came back praising in church and clapping his hands and amen in the word i was like all right well i need i need to do something so i was like all right so and then after i came back i um on the way back um we got uh in about i think 6 30 sunday night and then we came to church and then um i was just it was like towards the end of service and the baptism um and they said you know there's a few people that want to be baptized and then like i um i saw haley go up and then or zoe come up and then i saw ariel come up and i was like and then i as soon as i saw him like i just started bawling because you know there's this youth has been in my heart for a long long time like i've you know i've just been crying and praying that god do something for them and so like as soon as he came out i just started praising god for you know him getting baptized and then i uh i just you know thank god for what he's doing in our youth and michael and you know i felt like you know after camp i was talking to him in the parking lot sunday night and we just got to talk and i was like you know even god touching him you know that's even a miracle in itself um because you know i just thank god for each one that he's touched and i know that those that are out there you know it don't matter how far they go you know they can they can run as far as they want to but you know god will get them some way or another and it doesn't matter and i'll testify that it doesn't matter you know i'm praying for each one that you know they'll come back and they will come back because god has his seed out there that he that he knows which who those are and you know i i just think um thank them for you know even when god you know even though i didn't come expecting much at camp you know i um i came out receiving you know a lot more than i even expected going to camp i didn't like i said i didn't really expect much at camp [Music] but i know that god you know came by my way and came to my seat and i know that he filled me with his spirit and thank y'all i feel 18 years old you know sister louise's testimony i that that moved me and it moved me because that was a true definition of salvation that's what that's what it's like to be saved the darkness goes away the burdens lifted off and now you feel a part of something and it's so wonderful and you know i don't want to stop the testimony service because a christian's testimony never stops sunday night we preached a little sermon and the campers were in here but we called it the second part of easter and it's so important that you testify it's so important because it's not clenched until you testify you know what i mean it's not sealed into your own self until you finally can speak it and know you're speaking it for yourself nobody can take that from you you know and and and i want to say what we're experiencing here is not us it's him it's him working and the most beautiful part about it is is this is an intellect you know everybody knows about jesus everybody reads the bible but when you hear people come up and say i was in dark places and god delivered me from a dark place i had a mental battle and now i see clear there's stuff going on in my life that tells me he's alive and even when jesus rose on easter he said the reason i suffered in rose that you could go to the world and preach repentance of sin and deliverance beginning at jerusalem and my heart's thrilled about that don't stop it's the only way to keep your fire alive is tell somebody if it means so much to you tell somebody and i appreciate it so much our sister expressing that share that i'll tell you another thing that really moved me is how each person in the body talked about somebody else in the body that touched them or said something to them and we're a body fitted and joined together every part supplying the need to the other you know it it it's it's not a one-man show it's not a preacher show it's him showing us through us how much he loves us and we just want to keep that i know i'm not going to close the testimony service i'm just gary i think wants to say something back there and and i'll tell you what we'll do we'll sing a song and anybody that has to go can slip out and then anybody else that wants to stay and testify can stay and testify i might even give my testimony starting at the beginning come on i'll try to be quick but you know it just seemed like he just done so much i'm so happy you know i'll just start by reading the scripture real quick it's in matthew chapter 18 verse 10. it says take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of the father which is in heaven for the son of man has come to save that which was lost how think he if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray does he not leave the 99 and go with into the mountains and seek that which has gone astray and if it so be that he findeth it verily i say unto you he rejoices rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the 99 which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish you know sister jordan just said something uh earlier that was just really spoke to me there in the back when when she said you know you know he wants to use us in his way and um you know the whole reason that i i had wanted to go to camp um for the youth was for you guys you know i signed up to be a counselor and you know to stay you know on the camp with the with the youth and you know in the trenches and you know i've spent you know quietly many hours with some of these young men up here some that are even not here as maybe kelly could testify of you know because i love him you know when you know as a couple weeks back even had gone over to sister kelly's house and brother troy's to you know speak to levi and you know we talk on and off and um there was a situation where we hadn't talked in maybe eight months or so and i just went by i went by to see him you know and um i brought him a gift just to break the ice and uh told him you know i'd gotten him a little something because you know he had they were like some discs i don't know if anyone has ever played disc golf or anything like that but he had had some discs and he'd come over to my house and he'd left them and my kids were playing with them and threw them over in the neighbor's yard and the dogs ate them up so so just to break the ice had been on my heart to to do that for him and so you know i went by and seen him and you know he he even made the comment you know it you know i thought if it if it meant enough to you you'd do something like this and so you know we were just talking and really i'd you know let let him do most of the talking and you know when it got down to the end i just said you know what in the past several years i've seen a lot of people go i've lost a lot of friends but i don't want to lose anymore and i really felt like it spoke to him we hugged it out he unblocked me off his phone and you know but you know i just you know i just humbled myself to go and apologize to him you know because i loved him and so you know we went to the camp this year and you know i never didn't even know if we would have the opportunity to go back after what happened in 2020 you know and so to be back on the grounds was a lot of nostalgia you know and to be with my the youth and with everything that happened with christian michael and at pawnee i didn't get to be a part of that situation you know there there were times when i took the youth to pawnee and you know but um there was kind of a i always i only say this because i want the youth to know that something happened for me too you know we you guys think maybe we don't have mind battles or we don't go through things but we might battle just as just as hard as you guys even though i do believe that you guys have a tougher road than us but um so you know i'm being a deacon in the church and you know been already here ten years now and um i was just mind battling during the week of camp or being even at the camp that you know that satan's just telling me you don't have the holy ghost you're a deacon but you don't have the holy ghost and you don't you don't have no fruits you don't there's nothing special about you so you know it was all the way to saturday morning now and there was kind of a situation or i'll call it an opportunity after service where a couple brothers were witnessing to a brother and i was just standing there quietly a lot of times i do you know you know maybe afraid to speak you know a lot of times you you know you wonder if it's patience or if it's laziness and so we were standing there and i was listening to the brothers speak to him and i just thought everything they're saying is right on point everything they're saying is things that work i've seen it work so it wasn't anything anyone was saying but he it just rose up anger he just got upset about it and i don't know something in me just hurt for him i can't explain it and so as he walked away i just followed him and i went we went behind the u-haul and i didn't say anything great you know i didn't say anything out of the ordinary really i just listened i said what's what's wrong what's going on you know why are you so mad and he began to tell me things and i just listened i just let him talk i just you know i just tried to show him love when i didn't have you know when you don't i don't know him you don't have to you know because that was done for me you know i had somebody call me when i was a young brother sitting in the single brothers section and i hadn't come to church for a little while and he called me and i'm like why do you care and so i just began to speak to him and he went and he began to soften and [Music] we began to cry in each other's arms and not even really knowing this brother to be honest with you but just because i loved him and so you know as it went on i just said hey i'm going to get something to eat you want to go with me and we went to the you know we went back and sat down and ate and you know fellowshipped and you know the brothers that we were talking with could see that this counting has changed and and from that moment on that lying devil spirit that was telling me that i didn't have the holy ghost and that that left and i had a peace like never before that i haven't had in three or four or five years and you know i just felt like it was i proved that i had the holy ghost because of love and you know many many can i don't know how many um of you know how much time i've spent with your children especially the brothers you know i mean like grace was saying israel spent time with israel israel worked with me a little bit last summer and we got really close and you know i've witnessed to him and not that he needed witnessing to but i just spent time with him i love him you know and then even um you know sister pineal i've never really spoke much to her but she came up to me i think maybe the wednesday night before church and was just asking me if i ever talked to her boys or she had noticed that i'd talked to her boys and i didn't say anything grand i just said you know sister i'm working on it because i love gershwin and i see him go through the prayer line and i've seen him make steps i've seen him make a move we just keep him in prayer knowing that god started the work he'll finish it and um you know i told the brothers you know i'm always available because i feel like that's the greatest thing that you know brother jackson instilled in me was best abilities availability and so you know i just told these boys that i'm always available you can always get a hold of me you know i'll say 24 7 365. but i'm just i just want to tell the youth that you know you're an inspiration to us and and you guys being on fire you know i made a move at camp and it did something for me and then oh my goodness when we came back to evening service and brother david was preaching on you know what he was said he was preaching on and then you know we just came into service and start began to worship and man the songs that billy was just selecting just one after another was speaking to me and man the presence was so thick and i just began to rejoice and then the spirit fell on my wife and then you know she didn't even go to camp [Applause] i just know that god's so mindful every little intricate details of our life and you know it may seem small but brother jackson called me yesterday and he's asked me hey how's your going you know everyone's just so excited on fire and i said well you know what tommy had dropped me off we were working together a little bit and he dropped me off and you know i had a situation last fall with my neighbor where i had um i was mowing and i mowed over his water holes and like the metal part i'd cut it and i never said anything about it i never you know i never i just reasoned it out i just said when spring comes i'll get him a water hose i'll put a note on his door and so when we got to the we pulled up to the house yesterday he was out just fertilizing his yard and i started to walk in the house and something was like you said you're going to make that right and so i said well you know it is spring and the way up the way i've been feeling this week how could i not so i just went over there and said hey you know i always loved brother branham's approach i've just talked to him about the weather but uh no i just said you know what what you what you're putting out and he said fertilizer i said okay i said well hey look i think i owe you a water hose and uh he was like i said uh i think last fall maybe one of the last times i mowed i i hit your water hose and he said oh i wonder what had happened and uh he said oh you don't you don't got to do that i said no i want to and then you know we just began to fellowship and talk and it felt like we talked 40 minutes or so but um man it was just another burden lifted off just another just doing what he asked me to do even in the very small things but you'll like i said it wasn't anything i did because i reasoned it out and just the way god had moved in my life this weekend i was like there's no way i cannot do it and so i just wanted to testify and encourage the youth that you guys are an inspiration to us and you know we sacrifice the time and the efforts because we love you you know and and i'm so happy that god's moving in our group and you know and even like jordan said he uses you in the way he wants to use you and maybe all those small meetings or times that i've spent with these brothers had an effect on them to you know to stay to stay lord we i just just love you lord just thank you so much thank you [Applause] have you ever wondered what the capstone is this is the capstone amen that's right hallelujah this is the capstone ministry that he said was going to come to the church amen that there be such a love amongst one another so the musicians would come i'll tell you what i'm going to do not everybody had the opportunity to testify so sunday night will continue this service sunday evening so all you that are a little bashful you
