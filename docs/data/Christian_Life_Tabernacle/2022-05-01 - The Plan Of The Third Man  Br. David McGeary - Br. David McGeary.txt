and call on that day lord when we'll all be changed granted to us now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you invite brother mike for our songwriting this morning amen god bless you good morning you know one of the things that technology has given us these days is the ability to communicate with anyone uh all over the world you know using nothing more than a little device in your pocket and just swipe of your finger you can call video text message tweet post to anyone and everyone all over the world anytime you want to communicate an idea to someone just a couple of tips of the finger and you can get that thought across and get that thought expressed but you know it occurred to me this week just as was dealing with some stuff at work that in this age where we have more communication technology available to us than ever before there's less real communication going on with people than ever before seems like you know no more often than not no matter how eloquent you are with your words how well written that email is what you try to convey in a text somebody is going to misunderstand your words no matter how eloquent it is they'll misunderstand it they'll misinterpret it they'll be confused by it they might get frustrated by it or angry about with all that technology and all that ability to communicate and express a thought no matter how well you use words somebody still misunderstands you know it's uh also interesting that brother david gave the example wednesday night about how you'll say something to one person and by the time it's gotten eight nine ten people down the line what they're saying is nothing like what you said and it seems like the further you get away from the person who's speaking the thought the less you're aligned with what the words really mean you know i got to thinking about that we you know there's a limit to what words alone can express there's only so much you can get of someone's thought with words the best way to truly understand what a person is trying to express with their words is to know the person you know not studying their words and their statements so deeply that you can understand every aspect of what it is that they're trying to say no matter how well you study their words you're not gonna get it right if you don't know the person speaking the only way in fact the best way to know what a person is saying with the words that they're speaking is to know that person so well that you know what they're going to say before they say it that okay it's if you were stuck in a situation boy i know what so-and-so would say if they were here or i know how they would respond if they were here you can't do that by studying someone's words and memorizing their words there's a point where your relationship with that person gets to such a place that you know what they're going to say even before they say it you know just as a word is a thought expressed a thought is a person expressed you know there was a time brother branham was questioned about how well he knew the scriptures compared to some of the other preachers of his day and he made this statement he said i don't know too much about the word the book i just know the author real well the one who wrote it you know so there's a difference between knowing interpreting understanding someone's words and knowing the speaker well enough that no matter how poorly they might communicate you still know what they were saying because you know their ways therefore you know their words we're going to read psalm 119 again this morning we're going to pick up at verse 33 and it begins with this statement it says teach me o lord the way of thy statutes doesn't say teach me thy statutes it says teach me the way of thy statutes it says in verse 35 make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i delight see there's a difference between it be between being intimately familiar with his commandments his statutes and knowing the way of his statutes and his commandments you know it's uh the difference is whether you know the words the statements the quotes or the person himself you know it says in first corinthians 13 and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith revelation so that i could remove mountains and have not charity which requires a relationship i am nothing it says in psalm 119 36 incline my heart unto thy testimonies not my head not my understanding or my knowledge but my heart my desire my relationship what did jesus say matthew 7 he said this not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven those who know his words but he that doeth the will of the father which is in heaven not the words but the will the path the way the intent you know when jesus was on the earth the religious leaders of the day they knew his words perhaps better than any other people in the world they knew them intimately they spent their entire lives studying his words and his statements and his quotes but yet when i am the way came on the scene their authoritative understanding of the words caused them to miss him by a thousand miles said in john 8 43 why do ye not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word matthew 15 8 this people draweth nia unto me with their mouth with their words and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me see they have all the word but they missed the way you know we have a phrase in corporate america whenever trying to get a project done we finally arrive at a point where we're just going to be whatever work we do is directionally correct that's the phrase we use directionally correct and though we may not have figured out all the details we're headed in the right direction because we know the way that we're headed so therefore the words will find their place you know david's prayer in psalm 119 33 is teach me the way of thy statutes his desire was not to necessarily know the words or the commandments or the statements but to know the person himself is the religious leaders of jesus day showed us you can know all the words and still not be in the way but you can be in the way even though you don't understand all the words knowing the author real well we may not know all the words but he know we know what he wants done with the word you know and my prayer this morning is that i would know his way and then i will know his word oh that i might know the way of his statutes let's just read that this morning that's what stuck out to me we'll just read those eight verses in verse 30 starting in verse 33 says teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i shall keep it unto the end give me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i shall observe it with my whole heart make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i delight incline my heart unto thy own testimonies and not to covetousness turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and quicken thou me in thy way establish thy word unto thy servant who is devoted to thy fear turn away my reproach which i fear for thy judgments are good behold i have longed after thy precepts quicken me in thy righteousness amen amen god bless you may have your seats [Music] oh do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling not to wander away [Music] [Music] when you go down in the water caused by pain you believe in what you heard it's not an impossible trick all you can do [Music] oh [Music] you just started your existence and with its contrast therefore foreign [Music] [Music] oh by the water oh yes oh and i paid my oh and everything is oh oh is yes oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh oh oh is when it's all over oh oh his is [Music] oh oh

this time for the special god bless you saints [Music] y'all help me i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i couldn't keep it to myself i couldn't keep it to my hole but i couldn't keep it to myself i said i wasn't going to tell nobody but i couldn't keep it to myself what the lord had done for me oh you ought to be when you saved my soul you would have been there when i saw my name on the road i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting about what the lord had done for me i said i wasn't gonna testify but i couldn't keep it to myself but i couldn't keep it to my oh but i couldn't keep it to myself i said i won't go testify but i couldn't keep it to myself what the lord had done for me i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting about what the lord had done for me i said i won't go shout for joy but i couldn't keep it to my oh but i couldn't keep it to my oh but i couldn't keep it to myself i said i won't go shout for joy but could [Music] i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting about [Music] [Music] what the lord has [Music] i started [Music] [Music] i started walking i started talking i and i started shouting about what the lord had done for me [Music] [Applause] aren't you gladys you saw your name on the roll amen amen man that's a beautiful thing about what god does you can't keep it to yourself amen it does it it's so big you want to tell everybody amen amen we got a couple announcements at this time um we announced it on uh wednesday but certainly i'd like to go over it as you can see there's a lot of work going on in the parking lot and there's a lot of dirt and work going on and the ribbons and there's markers and there's cones there's everything man we just want to make sure that we keep our kids from those things they don't touch it they don't move it so that the work can continue as far as i believe the intention was to start next weekend the mother's day weekend to have all of the young people everyone between under 40 and i believe maybe we'll say 19 or 18 between 18 and 40 to start parking at the church down the road amen and all of the those with the kids between the ages of zero to 12 they can park in the parking spot here amanda north side of the church you can also park there to make sure we make a little more parking and then

from brother sergio and our sister sandra lord and father all that have needs this morning our sister laura is not well father you're the great physician lord father you you before even the sickness could come into question lord your healing power already existed and that's what we're counting on to know that there's a god who has everything under control blessed service our service this morning the preaching of the word lord that's the very life that we live by it's the word and we ask this morning as the word comes forth that we may receive it within our heart and let it produce the effect of the word in our lives all we commit everything that ties in the offerings father those that will give and those that don't have lord that you may multiply it for the glory of your kingdom we love

and but to have a living hope amen our hopes in one that's alive this morning that can do exceedingly and abundantly above what we even ask or we even think father we place all our trust in you this morning we ask you to bless us this morning touch each heart each need that's here this morning we commit ourselves to your hands this morning father that you would just anchor us in your word for we ask these things in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you if you have your bibles let's read two scriptures this morning before we take our seats and trust that the lord will bless us so uh we wanted to go back and read again in corinthians um the second chapter of first corinthians and uh where we got our inspiration from on wednesday night service and we're just continuing in that thought process of the things that we started that we're trying to bring us to a greater walk a greater growth amen we want to move up right we we don't want to look at the fields that we already have and the yields of the fields we already have we want to plant new fields amen amen so it says here it says in the ninth verse but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the hearts of men the things which god hath prepared for them that love them do you love them this morning so that scripture tells me that god has something that's prepared for you but it hasn't entered into your heart yet but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the deep things of god so you believe the spirit's with us this morning i certainly felt his presence i can see that his presence certainly is on you so that tells me that that spirit is going to seek and search all things yea the deep things of god i want to go deeper in him don't you and then let's also turn over to one of my favorite scriptures this scripture just came to light to me one day and just anchored in my soul when i was fellowshipping with brother james hayes and and this scripture just came up and it was gripping to me it says it's the fourth uh chapter of the first john so the epistle of john 1 john 4 and 17. and we'll just read the 16th first as you're uh turning there okay in uh first john the the fourth chapter the 16th verse and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because he is as he is so are we in this world heavenly father bless us this morning your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning it's certainly wonderful to be in the house of the lord this morning and we trust that each of us can take something with us that uh raises us up uh higher in the lord and and closer to him and and you know i don't want to lose contact with those that are in the uh the overflow back there this morning you're certainly a part of us our hearts are certainly with you and we're trying to do everything we can to get you all of us together in one spot i think that's going to be a glorious day don't you you know i believe the lord's moving i i he moves in a lot of different ways and he he does a lot of different things but i i love to feel the hand of the lord and i've seen the hand of the lord this week in several different ways and manners and and seeing the lord come over obstacles and and do great things and uh that's our relationship and fellowship with him is that he gives us the desire of his heart i had an experience this week and it it has something to do with what's going on inside of me and the sermon that i'm preaching i had went to see the engineer the soil engineer and when you do work for the city um they've got a gift to complicate things you know but they they want to know you know all about your soil and how dense it is and how thick it is and how the water drains through it and they want to test your concrete to see how long it will do and i don't know where they keep all these records but at least they want to look at them so i had brought a a i was going to bring some soil over to my the soil engineer the one that does all the tests and everything and so i talked with him and he's a muslim and and he's a good friend of mine and uh and um he invited me to lunch he said david as soon as ramadan's over we're going to go have a big feast together and uh you know i respect him i respect someone that lives their religion you know what i mean that follows can and i i know the muslim faith in whole because of its extremist has had a um a you know bad maybe thing uh politically and all that but you know they're the children of abraham but they're just not join heirs with the seed i mean i god that was god's plan but the love of god still goes out in my heart and he's still a friend of mine and and so i got done talking with sam and i was heading up the street and i started to turn and as i was turning down the street there's a church there it's been there for a while but something just compelled me to go look at it and i thought well i want to go look at their sanctuary so i drove to in there and i parked my truck and i looked in and little fella come out down there and had a little hat on everything he said can i help you i said yeah i'd like to i'd like to see your sanctuary i'd like to just look at it and see how big it is and what your seating's like and all that and so i went in and and i we fellowshipped and and our spirits uh were um just a kindred you know you know how that is and uh uh he spoke some english i don't believe his wife spoke much english at all but but he ended up being the pastor and we talked a little bit about the church and we talked about the seating and how many it seated and the walls and how nice it was and i couldn't help it but i was drawn to that pulpit like like there was some sort of affinity with it you know what i mean i i i i didn't know i just i just had a sense of uh seeing the platform in the pulpit and of course we always relate the pulp with uh ministry you know what i mean and so i had this sense so that you know i'm gonna minister here you know what i mean and and i didn't and and i just i knew that i felt that and and i and i of course in my mind i thought well maybe i'll preach in that pulpit someday or he'll invite me to preach but i just knew there was something there and it moved me and so i was there and it's about time for me to go in this and this the sister came in the wife came in and she said brother uh their spanish they're a pentecostal church their hispanic pentecostal church they i don't know if they have any affiliation i believe they're independent but the wife came to me and she said you know i don't believe that god sent you here without a purpose i believe god sent you here to pray for us me and my husband that we're in a um i i guess they're in some sort of trial it could be with the church it could be with the family i it doesn't matter what the trial is as long as you know the trial fixer you know what i'm saying so that that's that's why when i go to trial i want the the judge and jury and the attorney all to be on my side amen so uh let him judge his own case and his case is i paid for him i washed his blood away with my sin so anyway i just i thought it was so important i was moved on and i just i thought now i want to pray for you but i said faith's got to have a place that it anchors i said you just can't go by the anointing of the spirit you can't just go because you feel blessed or you feel anointed or you just can't pray to him and and just speak in tongues and and pray and and never have it have a place that it can rest and and take root you know if you if you cast a seed that seeds fine it could float in that wind but it is until it come finds some ground that it can anchor in and then it germinates in that ground and that ground becomes the bed of its roots and it will grow from there so we know that if it falls on stony ground right it'll it'll get withered away if it falls on banned ground it'll get trodden under foot so when you take a promise it's just like any promise of god's word you've got to bring it back and you've got to anchor it in the scriptures so i said to i says now whatever your problem is i don't need to know and i suppose i could have fished around you know what i mean and found out but there there was something in my heart that said he knows and and and i've got to keep man out of it because if i can keep man out of it then they will detect that there's something supernatural and i want to tell all of you here this morning every one of you you are the possessors of the supernatural you are the possessors of the supernatural we haven't brought ourselves to that yet but that's our goal is to try to work ourselves there and as a pastor my desire is for you to become more aware even my sermon this morning is to try to get something that will make you more aware of of of the victory and the power that you possess in god's word and so that i and i told him it had to be anchored in the word so i just take your problem and find a scripture and anchor it in that scripture because this feeling will leave this anointing will leave but that word will not pass away and the scripture says heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away that doesn't mean heaven and earth in the future that doesn't mean all just the world is going to go away but it's the the the present things of the world heaven and earth is passing away every day every day your world changes every day if that will change that'll pass away but my word will never change because it's the same yesterday today and forever it's eternally anchored in something that god had in his mind and we'll we'll move towards that so anyway we just uh and i i felt so empowered with the wisdom that has been imparted to us by his messenger the statements the explanation of the word the pointing to the word of god it it just felt wonderful to speak the truth to know that that truth is set you free and so as we just testified and we started to pray and the spirit of god come on them and they wept and and uh and it was uh uh the lord really moved on her i don't i i i when i left i said you know i i don't care i said you're gonna get what you aunt you asked for i said because god hears my prayer it was a it was a move a shift instead of oh letting it be done according to your faith or it'll believe but i took responsibility and and so that's where i want to take us this morning in in the word of god if if i could use some statements and read and and bring you to what my my heart's desire is if i if i had a a title sermon i would i would uh call it the see if i i have my notes if i brought them with me i'm sure i did somewhere here i don't know this happens to me all the time does anybody ever realize i'm the most unorganized person you'll ever meet but uh uh you might you might look in there jackson to see if they're on my desk and i'll fumble a little bit until i i get them but i like to call it maybe the plan of the third man and so the there's a lot of paper there but is there anything that says something on it that i can study all right yeah i can get a sermon out of this amen all right this is what i wanted now so there's something that i want us all to finally settle in on that we are different okay we are different you're you're different from before you ever got here you you are different you're different from the world and it's it's it's a great struggle when you try to fit in to the world and we talked about that last sunday we talked about the struggle the struggling and i think that i think i saw a little skit the young people did where they showed those those things that tuggle war of those uh those uh emotions and and the census the five outer senses the fight of inner senses and the struggle tuggle war of of those things pulling at each other and and that's a struggle and then when you make your decision to enter in to serving god you finally make your decision that you're going to serve god now you have an adversary because he was trying to win you but the minute that you chose him he's no longer trying to give you favor so from the day that jesus did not fall down and worship him fall down and worship me i'll give you all the kingdoms of the the world the day he chose get behind me satan you know it man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god from that day forth they set in their heart to crucify him now they became his adversary you you know what i mean they they questioned them at first they had the tug of war but when he didn't move from what that he believed and what that he stood for and what his purpose was now they became their adversary and satan becomes your adversary you know we told the testimony how that we god had given us this dirt well the the drivers that were bringing it they came to us and said well you know uh they uh they told us not to bring any more dirt here and i said oh why he says why is that and he said because the devil's against the truth i thought now that's a okay well if the truth is asking the question then he'll the truth will get the truthful answer right and so we he said that he and then i said oh okay and so then i we went and and saw i said he said you need to go talk to the guy so i said okay where is he at and they told me where he was i drove my truck down there i got out i walked up to the trailer where he was and and he was a real uh just you know yeah what can i do for you you know and i just sat there for a moment i i prayed on the way over here lord give me favor with this fella you know what i mean and i didn't want to say anything to in front of the guy that was there so i just stepped up and he came up and we just visited a little bit and i told him about the the dirt and how he wanted and i i said i'd like to buy you lunch and buy all your guys lunch if you get there i'll bring barbecue over and everything here's a little offering of our appreciation for for the dirt that you did give us and everything and he says i said oh okay then he said you know i will i will send the the the dirt over to your your place and you can have it that's good i said oh that's wonderful thank you i says i'll take care of he says oh no he'll take care of it and i thought i thought you know this is wonderful because something else is moving now i want to just lay a few little quotations the foundation so let's let's establish our difference in the word of god you don't look any different on the outside but your difference is not on the outside it's on the inside that difference is trying to work its way to the outside all right so he says uh he said if you're a catholic this is out of the message and note that not so if you're a catholic and i tell you it's not in the bible not to eat meat on friday and all these things like this the holy eucharist isn't a wafer because it's a spirit and so forth and you go to your priest and say here it is wrote right here in our document and if the church is your ultimate you don't give a hoot what anybody else says that's your ultimate so if the word of god's your ultimate what you don't give a hoot what anybody else says about anything because you've got your absolute right oh god help this to sink in to me the whole thing is wrong god's word is the ultimate whatever the word says then that's right now the only way up here in this sphere that you could ever be in this little inside man you have to be foreordained because you was with god you're a part of god now remember that's the three circles the outside senses the inner emotions and then down in the soul you know so that part of man he said he said it you're a part of god i was in my father i was also in my grandfather and in my grandfather's grandfather by seed i was in that he said and i was in christ and you were in christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him hallelujah his children that was in him he never came to save the devil's children they never will know it so if they'll never know it then if i could just automatically use the law of contrast if somebody doesn't know something then somebody has to know it okay so the devil's children will never know it but god's children will know it now god's trying to get that to you he's trying to let that sink in you young ladies he's trying to get you to realize that you possess a virtue you possess a value the sacredness of your motherhood and your union with the husband that sacred satan wants just to blow that away he wants you to give that away he he doesn't realize that you're the representation of the church someone that made to be led by the spirit of god and he wants to sell that out and and so he never wants you to know that you're special and satan is driven by time because his time is coming to an end but god's children aren't driven by time we say oh i'm too old you're never too old to get saved you're never too old to get baptized hey god it just it you know it doesn't have nothing to do with this time with this body be dissolved i've got one waiting for me so i'm not worried about this time in fact to a believer time is no more there's something else that we're interested in he says you know he says they never will know it they are so shrewd in the ways of their intellect learning that you can't compare with them at all now can you imagine you trying to keep up with the world when you've got a curse really god said you will never be able to compare with them so for all you are trying to become bill gates or any of these other guys out there elon musk and all those guys let me tell you one thing they can't take it with them but what you've got you can take with you like we don't care about insurance you know you know and i mean we want what we want blessed assurance we want what can take us out not what can protect us from going in he said you can you can't compare them all you can out talk them but by faith you see it so there there's something that already separates you and it's your spiritual eyesight okay so i'd like to go over um and read uh hear a little more he says okay this is in paragraph 160. he says now you tell her that it's wrong for her to cut her hair the bible said so it's wrong for her to wear them shorts the bible said so she will say nonsense why her ultimate is not down here in that third man her ultimate is not down here in that third man the soul that predestinated and sent from god so what is the third man it's the soul that's predestinated and sent from god so each of you now possesses a soul something that's been predestinated and sent to you from god amen oh but her ultimate is an organization out here that some man has organized outside of this outside of this word but if the word of god is down in that soul it says amen i see it it lines up with it now look here therefore the man that it lines up with it now look here therefore the man that's born of the spirit of god now if i could say this so we we realized that you possess something in other words you've got something that is the a soul that's predestinated and sent from god so we call it the seed of seed a inside man a part of god in you as we called it here the third person now by faith you know it's there okay so and so you know a lot of times uh if i you know we're always looking for a way to describe the baptism of the holy spirit you know some people want a sensation to link to some people want a a change to associate with it but if i could just speak like it in in this simple terminology something that will help you but the baptism of the holy spirit is the resurrection of the third man right when that soul that man on the inside is germinated by the spirit of god when the spirit of god comes in awakens something in you that there's something inside of you then then you realize hey i've got something in me it's that's what we're trying to lay down is you're difference and and so uh we could go to this and now he said i want you to see that that that these things are if i could say this there existing parallel because you're still in the world but you're not of the world and jesus was subject to all the lust of the world he was tempted even as we are tempted okay but so we're talking about how can we go beyond that remember we talked about the battle and so the battle is once that that inside man's been awakened satan is trying to is the adversary of that inside man he wants never wants that inside person to come to its full predestinated part he'll he'll do you'll use anything religion uh whatever he can he don't care as long as it never comes to its full what maturity he says now look here here's a little lady twisting herself down the street here's a young fella his eye catches it he's a member of the church he's pentecostal he's whatever he is but the first thing you know there's no hold post in there she says hello he's got curly hair kind of nice looking straight shouldered young man maybe trying to live right she starts walking up to him even at preacher the first thing you know what is it this out here the flesh desire and that and the spirit down here yet annoying it says don't do it don't do it but what will it do it'll move right around there they're hold there it goes first thing you know he's trying to make a date with her he's guilty of committing adultery whether he touches her or not but a genuine born-again son of god now i think you all went through this in camp where everybody's talking about deliverance and deliverance and and get free and and and and deliverance ministry has been going on uh for a long time and uh and and so people they want deliverance from this they want from deliverance from that but let me tell you year after year after year we see it's only a temporary deliverance right people end up going right back even though they made their heart to live right they go right back but what they're failing to get to is they're failing to get to that tie post they're failing to have that inside predestinated third man resurrected so that third man is god to come out of its human grave right because we are the earth it's got to resurrect out of the senses it's got to resurrect it doesn't mean that you won't have a battle with those things you understand but now you've become aware there's something different i'm different there's something else inside of me growing and a lot of times we as preachers miss it because we keep bombing you if you're tempted we keep bombing and if you go through struggles bomb we keep bombing you you don't have it you don't have it you don't have it but you know i knew what god did for me have i always lived true to it to my shame i say no but has it always drawn me back praise god i can say yes [Applause] he who saved sins not is a liar but praise god we have one that makes petition on our part and if we are faithful and just to convince confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive them and so we we he says he says but a genuine born again son of god amen you can't do it yourself it's totally impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place but when there's something on the inside that little born again something here right what do we call that this morning the third man right when when the soul that's predestinated and sent from god is there when that soul because we want to know we want to grow to an overcoming power now for those of you that are in that struggle that are in and out in and out you do good for a while you fall you watch something you shouldn't watch you you listen to something you shouldn't listen to and you feel all condemned and beat down and and then you know we just tell you god loves you god forgives you and you you get yourself up we want you to keep going through that struggle we want you to keep going to that battle because we're trusting the time will come that you come into the atmosphere where you get the revelation by faith you see it there's something there's another man in me [Applause] there's another person in me and now i'm aware of that person it's like happening like i said it's like having the seed and every time the sunlight comes along the seed is drawn to the sunlight but that the spirit is not the driving away of all temptations in your life where all of a sudden you're wearing a roman collar and you're wearing a little nun habit and you're you know you're living this little fake religious life life's a constant warfare but you've got something else in you now that's speaking to you that's coming to life it's growing he says he says but when there's something on the inside that little born again something here tonight that might that man might have shouted spoken tongues jumped dance everything anointed with the spirit then all the signs and wonders that god said in there by his spirit jesus said many will come to me in that day say lord haven't i prophesied in your name haven't i cast out devils in your name he said depart from me you that work iniquity what's iniquity something that you know to do and you don't do it depart from me for me you doer's iniquity i didn't eve and know you but down on the inside of that man if that little tie post is there that seed of god that was predestinated before the foundation of the world i don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay now think of it i'm not talking about lack of temptation i'm not talking about about anything i'm talking about the realization of the third man maybe i preach this in another sense in a way of contacting the third man that if if you can't contact that seed for some people it's not there to contact but when you're going through a struggle and you're going through a trial when you're going through a temptation but i hope that uh that you will understand the prophet of god said it like this he said sometimes he was talking about blind barmass he said blind bartimaeus just sat down there and started to think it over he said that's what a christian does he says i drive my car out in the woods someplace and i park and i get out and i drive out in a place and i get alone with god and i think it over and if we would stop and get along with god prophet of god preached it in another sermon called hear ye him he says we're too many times doing all the talking he said what we need to do is get still and get alone and get to the place that we hear him he can talk to you you understand he created that inside man that predestinated soul he's obligated to watch over it and he wants to talk to it amen because he's just trying to make contact with these other this these other spheres but you've got to set that inside man in in his presence where he can talk to it if we were really to ask this morning don't raise your hands but if i was to ask how many could raise your hand said i've talked i've had a conversation with god from the inside man we would find out we have very active minds but that's what we've got to get away from you've got to break away into that place where it's not by the mind it's like the resurrection of the third man it's where that inside part of you which i'm trying to tell you that that's what's supposed to lead the church the church isn't supposed to be led by my lips to your ears the church is supposed to be led by god's spirit contacting the predestinated seed this is just a small tool now a real this paragraph 181 a real chris genuine christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was back yonder at the beginning which is the word cope what a what a word to use in other words there's obviously something going on right what is that something it's you and him that's right it's you submitting to him you've got to you gotta take time and think that out think it over you know you know i just you know i think samson just failed to sit down and think it over we might not have that kind of delilah but our delilah comes in the form of careers and jobs and and every other kind of thing that's out there because you know what we do we think that oh i'll go ahead and do it and then i'll overcome it later what which of you would take poison because you know that there's medicine to make you well that's not coming from the spirit that's coming from the flesh and not everybody can do that but you are different you have a third person amen i'm looking at your outside and then then when you speak and you talk i see your inside that third person that's in there i can only know him when he is manifested or she is manifested in the works of god because right because that inside man that spirit that was back yonder at the beginning which is the word so it only has one identification and that's the word of god and and how are you going to how are you going to make a choice when you come up to a choice all these other spheres are speaking but this inside predestinated man any red blooded man is going to feel something he gets in that situation but if that third inside man's been resurrected that becomes your tie post then the only reason why i know that inside man is there and who it is when it abides in the word and jesus said if you abide in me and my word abideth in you so it's together so even now maybe in some of your lives your mind keeps looking back at your flesh and everything but i want you to understand that the very deliverance of your flesh is in this third man this third man is here to deliver you from yourself oh thank you pray to him who is within you that word third man that's in you is him that's what was with him on the cross that was which raised up from the dead we treat trying to try to bring everything of god over into the flesh instead of us getting out of the flesh and getting into god as he was the fullness of all of you you were in him back yonder at calvary he foreknew you would be here he only broadcast what would take place and you were in him you died with him you died to your pride you died to your fashion you died to the world you died with him in calvary and you rose with him when he rose again on the third day and because you've accepted it now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus hallelujah there you are it's that inside man as we are describing it today as that third man so you're really somebody else other than who you think you are you're all schizophrenic and the only cure to your schizophrenia is the revelation of the person that you really are let that person live let the third man resurrect let him come to life in your life and in your flesh and in your words and in your actions you don't give a hoot what the world thinks god will change the world for you that inside man that will punctuate the word hang with the word regardless you can't help it i learned that many years ago amen and i'm going to try to hurry up i i wanted to be short because you know sometimes our pre-service alongs a little longer but anyway then we come down here to paragraph 2 17 and just just a quick foundation and i'll try to go through my sermon really quick it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were in christ and then when christ died he died it redeemed all of you and you are a part of this word how can the bible the bible all of it precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little not only jot and tittle shall fail now in the world you you can being a part of the word disagree with the rest of it or any part of it so anyway that's what we just wanted to establish was that you are a preet the predestinated third man okay now i just want to move on real quickly here so i also had a subtitle that i didn't know what i was going to call this sermon and then when brother brown described it as the third man it really struck me as a complete another being so if there's something predestinated right so let me tell you what religion did and what satan did and why he wanted a religious spirit because satan is trying to incorporate the flesh in god's plan you understand or is that god's got a plan for your flesh but god doesn't have a plan for the flesh the plan is for the third man the plan of god is for the third man that soul that person that he created in you this is from things to be therefore paragraph 37 it says therefore the bride in the rapture will come forth and there is and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be here and and he made it that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him all these things by foreknowledge so god has a plan you believe that if you don't believe god's got a plan then you're a rat in a maze no i shouldn't say that because we got no rats here maybe you're a dove in a cage if you are a christian now a genuine predestinated seed so what is the third man it's that predestinated soul so there there's there's people that have souls but they're they don't have that representation in that soul then there's people here that are different because their soul was predestinated by god was was that simple enough you know that soul i can't preach revelation i can just preach the word you always was he says you was in god before there was you always was in god the germ of your life which is an attribute of god which was his thought so there's people that have souls but they're not in the thinking of god they don't have the third man so god is not trying to conform the flesh to christianity he's not trying to conform the flesh to a way of living he's not trying to conform the flesh to a way of worship we don't want to become the message and we believe this way and we we this is what we teach and this is how we worship and this is how we treat one another which is all good nothing wrong with that but this gets down to become so individual that is each person taking the instrument what that third man in them and playing the part of the third man the inward soul that inward man that other part of you you've got to make contact with god has a plan for that it's just that we've been so much acting in the confines of the church world that we failed to seek the plan of god for our third man not the plan god has for your life i don't care where you work as long as the third man can work there i don't care where you live as long as the third man can live there he said before you always was in god the germ of your life which is an attribute of god which was in his thoughts say for instance this pretty little lady sitting here see god said in the day there will be a girl her name will be so and so and she'll be this and thus in this and even no to this very hour she would sit and listen to the message dressed in a red dress see that was his thoughts whoever your husband is whoever he is and he would bring this together and you would sit here in this this city at this day there could be no way for you to fail it see because you're growing and as long as your seed insides growing you have to produce just exactly what the seed said it would do that's exactly his word he keeps his word he watches over it now we're talking about maturing now we're talking about going up a little higher so he's got a plan but what man's done is they've left out the very first purpose of god god wanted to reveal who he was right he wanted to have preeminence and what fellowship god wants to fellowship with the third man he don't care if you're religious he wants to be in communication he wants to speak to that inside man do this do that do this talking about moving up we're talking about growing we're not talking about fear of what everybody else is going to think we're not talking about fear of the laws and rules all right so i it's already 12 o'clock so i'm i'm gonna just have to skip it and uh we'll we'll work on some things to uh i'm selfish i want all the time forgive me uh i i just want to express this and maybe i'll i'll finish up just by reading this to you and and it's from the message if you want to go home and re read it it's uh called god using his gift and i want i this i want to use this as my as the thing that will grant to me that i just have to get these pages in order here five ten so this is from a sermon that brother bran preached in 1956 and i just want us to follow this through because brother brahm's talking about a change in his ministry he just had a tent vision but something came up in here that was very uh to me was was very beautiful to help explain what it is that we're trying to lay hold of this morning and we just trust that you'll be able to take this with you this morning with a greater realization and he's speaking in this message he says in reading the vision you notice how the holy spirit had showed something else is just fixing to happen 1956 brother abraham has the tenth meeting the lord talks to him about meeting him and hi there bill graham doesn't exactly know how it's going to come to pass but it stirred them because there's something that's taking place and in this kind of healing service that i'm having now until i get into the tent i i'm just like a child with with christmas anticipation i can hardly wait till i get in there this way i can only stand so long because your faith is it that's does it it's not me operating that gift it's god it it's not me operating that gift of god it's your faith of doing it see it's not me it's you brother man ken i can't do nothing it's you that's doing it you're just making me do it and and talking you're just making me do the talking your faith is doing that you you out there in the audience with disease and sickness and things it's you using god's gift see see you see god has a gift now let me measure it like this because if somebody might come in for the first time tonight jesus was the greatest gift that god could ever had don't you believe that and when he was here on earth he had the spirit without measure all the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in christ now he was the whole ocean all the seas all the water which is about four fifths of the earth is covered with water all of that water was in him what comparison with him the blessings and the measure of the spirit that god had given him his servants and ministers we just spooned full of water in comparison of the ocean or the sea but the same chemicals that's in the whole ocean is in that spoonful too see it's got to produce the same thing if it comes from the same place you see that's the reason so the third man that's in you has got to produce the same thing if it came from the same place what's hindering you a deeper understanding the spirit it hasn't entered into our hearts the things that god prepared for us but he will reveal them to his they're revealed to us by his spirits for the spirits searches even the deep things of god so now we're moving into the deep things of god well i'm tired of people just tell me i'm saved that i've got the holy ghost and here's the proof you don't need to prove to me that david and matthew are my sons when they do good when they do bad they're leslie i mean i hear it all time you look exactly like your son you lose your son looks exactly like you i always say no he looks i look exactly like him he is here first and and so he says he says now i'm going to jump down he says and jesus of nazareth when this was this whole water or the spirit on him rather as i say water a while ago giving the parable so you understand he was god's gift and any time that god wanted him to do anything god just raised him up and he showed him what to do he said i'll do nothing in myself is that right i only do what i see the father doing did jesus say that then could not he could not lie that has to be the truth we might just as well settle that forever jesus said he had nothing except what the father showed him uh first what to do what i see the father doing that the son does likewise check that back with the bible and see if every prophet or everything ever done anything outside of the first seeing at first to be done because it can't be thus saith the lord unless the lord has said it and you know it and it ain't a mystical workup or some mental emotion it isn't a psychology a psychological or a psychology it is absolutely god for showing something that's going to happen correctly and it will happen every time it will never fail right now and now this is i want to appoint there's a now there's going to be a difference here and i want to catch the difference because i think this difference is going to apply to us now watch jesus natharis he comes walking through the audience of people and a little woman presses her way through the the unbelievers she was anemi she had a blood issue and she says in her heart i believe him if i could just touch his garment it'll make i'll be made whole and maybe she slipped under this man's arm and he pushed her back and she'd come around the other side and slip in the other side and went between one's knees and down until she got over to the place till she touched him and walked back away and walked out in the audience and jesus stopped and said who touched me and she and the rest of them said not me they all denied it and then we know the scripture the ma the disciples say master everybody's touching you so we know there's a this is a different kind of touch he says uh he said they denied it but he said i perceive that i got weak if your a translation is right virtue has gone from me what did she do he looked around tell his power of discernment caught the woman and who she was and said thy faith has healed thee and then she came and fell down to his feet and confessed it all thy faith has healed thee or saved thee rather thy faith has saved thee now she used god's gift that's what made him weak but when lazarus died and jesus was foreshown beforehand of god how he went away and stayed away for so many days till lazarus is dead and the appropriate days come for his body to to be deteriorating and now all this time god had showed him because he said that at the grave he said i thank thee father that thou hath already heard me he knew what was going to happen look over here our friend lazarus is asleep they said oh he rested said he's dead and for your sake i'm glad i wasn't there because it might upset your faith if you want me to go pray for him beg me to do it and i wouldn't do it then you might lose faith this way i'm going i wasn't there but i go wake him he knew it why he he said i do nothing till the father shows me first and he and he had to seed it first but notice when he stood there how much greater was the miracle of the resurrection of lazarus than the woman touching his garment but there was nothing said about him getting weak god had used his gift in christ to foreshadowing the resurrection of lazarus and the woman used god's gift to get what she wanted now i want to separate these two not to the days of jesus but to the fact the scripture said as he is in this world as he is so are we in this world so there was a part of jesus right that did nothing till the father showed them the other part made them weak but that part didn't it was even a greater work he said the woman used god gifts see in this new thing the lord has told me about it'll be god using his gift what made brother branham weak the people using the gift so there's a difference between the people using the gift and god using the gift and when you're standing here in the public before people out like this is just a constant draw it's just a miracle of god if a virgin born son of god one time was such a strain till it pulled him down and got weak what about me a a corruptible sinner and look at the the times it's happened see it's god using his gift or you using his gift two different things so it isn't isn't me that stands here it's you that stands here that does it you out in the audience you're here on the platform you're drawing from god's gift i'm not his gift the spirit is this gift it's not my voice it just picks up my voice i'm a deaf mute until there's something behind it speaking and so would i be dumb mute or anything supernatural unless the supernatural is using the instrument to speak through the lord bless you now i want to just close in this because i i took a long way around to get here uh because i i i believe that there's that this is in 56 brother branham is going to have this change in ministry so i thought that you know how much of that applies to us see we're always using god's gift right in our battle god do this for me god do that for me god do this god do this we're always pulling on god's gift god's gift we know jesus is god's gift to us we're always using god's gift and that it's almost like we're at the place that all that we've been taught to do call upon the name of the lord call upon the name of the lord but when the prophet of god's ministry changed brother branham didn't seek god for the seals god used him to break the seals he used him to lay out the church age he used him to open the mysteries you never notice you notice he never got weak in doing that because it came from the difference the difference of of us using god and god using him because he was the gift of god that was going to open the seals he was the gift of god that was going to break the bread of life to the gentile church there were so many things we could go into this ministry but what my point this morning is and can i i know i took a long way to say such a little simple thing but we're always using god and we never get to that third man to find out what does god want to use this third man for he created them he had a purpose for him he had a plan for him he stands independent it's an individual affair he stands independent it's a predestinated soul and jesus did nothing until the father showed them because that was god using him she reached out and used god's gift but when god used him to raise lathereth because he said i do nothing in myself only that the father shows me and lazarus wasn't even to a place where he could touch the hem of his garment but when god used him nothing could stand in his way not even death hell or the grave and we're never going to move into a higher level until we realize that we're a special people that have a third man in us that third man is not of this world therefore it is not bound by worldly things it's not bound by the thinking of the world the traditions of the world the education of the world it is a free spirit that if it can break this barrier that it hasn't even entered into the hearts of what god can do with that third man but we don't even seek it we just qualify ourselves because of our past we we just qualify ourselves because of the struggle but if we know he's got a plan i'm telling you god didn't create that third man and said that third man here without having something in mind without having a purpose for it it's not just to keep this outward man this five census man this inside spirit man from contaminating itself it's above that there's something above it brother ben i can't hardly wait because i know it's going to be him using me not you using his gift through me it's you that's touching him it makes me weak it made jesus weak but when he knew what the father's will was what the father's plan was it didn't matter when he went there was no urgency in getting there he was free he was free he could he could he could go he he was led and so i just want to say there's a difference in you using god and god using you we're we're always wanting the signs and wonders to follow us by us using god you know am i you am i making sense i'm not educated so satan beats me over the head with that you know the only thing i got was i i i don't know if jesus went to school and i know brother brown didn't get very far either so and i don't have words to find it but there's we we're just always talking and what i'm trying to say is when we always are trying to get god to perform the miracle to get jesus to hope for the miracle it makes us weak yeah we don't know if our faith has been it's going to come to pass we're afraid if it's going to come to pass what if it doesn't happen the way we have it we're not really getting stronger that way we're struggling so us using god is different than god using us so we preach to people use god use god use god overcome use god overcome use god how about god using you how about god giving you the word how about god giving you the outcome i totally i don't need to know god sent me here to pray for you god hears my prayer i wasn't telling them to use god she confessed god sent you here god is going to use you you're here for a purpose to pray for us god brother i believe god's saying because he wants to use you i thought oh my god i walked out of that room just so excited i didn't need results i didn't need to see anything i didn't need any vindications i didn't know need no stars on the my plaque i needed nothing man i was so happy to be a part of it i wasn't even going to share it but it it fits so much in my heart what god's doing and i just look at us i said we're always using him we're always using him but what's going to happen to this church when god uses us amen and i don't know if i can find it but i managed to read one thing in fact let us stand and then if i do find it uh i don't know if it got brought out here or not and if not i hope i can find it because uh [Applause] you can play something laurie [Music] was there any more of these papers on there that sermon [Music] go ahead and sing billy i'll find this [Music] say [Music] to the cheese oh [Music] [Music] please [Music] him [Music] is [Music] oh jesus [Music] is [Music] take me jesus take me [Music] [Music] i'd like to read this says brethren says that's the way it is today we still teach those things what great pentecost was what a great thing peter and john passed through the gate called beautiful the man was healed what good is the jehovah of yesterday if he isn't the same jehovah today what good is a god of moses if he isn't the same today puts me in mind of a man with a bird in a cage he goes and gives them the best food he can bone building to make good strong bones on his canary but he keeps him in the cage so he can't fly what good does it do to give him good orthodox food if you keep them pinned up that's what's the matter today we're sending preachers to seminary we're bringing very orthodox and trying to give the best food but they're afraid to come out and tell the people that their faith can set them free and make them healed and well and jehovah is still the same what good does it does it to have a bible study what good does it do to preach the gospel if we keep the people in a cage brother every one of you tonight can take the word of the living god and go from here just as free as a bird out of the cage amen oh my i don't want to preach you in a cage i'm trying to tell you got another person in you that god wants to talk to he wants to lead that he wants to use to do the work don't be afraid of it because it'll never never

ourselves the times to call on you and when we need something from you lord it's your desire that we would do that lord as sons and daughters but there's also a time that you would want to reflect

deliverance and needing something to be done for them lord that we would be a vessel that you could use and work through but we know that that's your desire father and we want to make ourselves
