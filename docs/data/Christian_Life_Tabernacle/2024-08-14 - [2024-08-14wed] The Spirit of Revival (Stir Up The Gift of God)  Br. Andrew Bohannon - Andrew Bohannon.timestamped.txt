[18:14] testimony amen she could come at this
[18:16] time amen
[18:32] God bless you I'm a little nervous so
[18:35] this is going to be quick but I just
[18:37] wanted to testify because I believe it's
[18:40] important to and it's always so
[18:43] encouraging when other people do
[18:46] so um first I wanted to testify about
[18:49] something that I wanted to for a really
[18:51] long time um and I should have a really
[18:54] long time ago
[18:55] but
[18:57] um so I've struggled with really
[19:00] horrible stomach aches um for a really
[19:03] long time I've basically had one every
[19:05] single day since I was
[19:07] 13 and I just wanted to say that I'm
[19:11] Healed
[19:17] and and even if all the symptoms are
[19:21] still there um I just wanted to testify
[19:24] and claim it right now
[19:29] so this last weekend I went to a camp
[19:32] and I had a lot of my heart but the
[19:35] biggest thing I was praying for was
[19:41] joy and it seemed
[19:45] like most of my life I've been just
[19:48] really
[19:49] sad
[19:50] and I just thought that was the way I
[19:53] was always going to be I just always
[19:55] thought I was going to be prone to
[19:57] sadness in
[19:59] depression um but God wants his children
[20:02] to be
[20:04] happy
[20:06] so um one of the nights at Camp there
[20:09] was a prayer line and then after I went
[20:11] through the prayer line I received my
[20:18] joy also before Camp I wrote down like a
[20:22] whole list of expectations that I
[20:24] had um of needs and there were some
[20:29] things that I didn't even write down
[20:32] because um I didn't even have faith for
[20:34] that kind of freedom but after I went
[20:37] through the prayer line those needs were
[20:40] met so I just wanted to testify that if
[20:44] you're sad he can turn that into
[20:46] joy and he's a faithful God and he can
[20:50] do exceedingly and abundantly above
[20:52] above and beyond whatever you could ask
[20:54] or think

[21:14] you didn't write down you still get them

[21:19] the kind of God we serve he he doesn't
[21:22] want us to be sad he doesn't want us to
[21:24] remain sick he he's got so much blessing
[21:27] to give to his children

[27:32] few
[27:39] scriptures and so appreciate the
[27:42] testimonies and you know it's an
[27:45] Evidence and a confirmation that God is

[27:50] believing
[27:51] children to do for them what they have
[27:54] need of

[28:40] with him and he with me to him that

[28:53] with my father in his throne he that
[28:56] hath an ear let him hear what what the
[28:58] spirit sayith unto the churches and also
[29:01] another scripture back a few chapters in
[29:04] second
[29:07] Timothy second Timothy chapter
[29:11] 1 we're going to read four verses
[29:15] there in paragraph
[29:19] 3-7 second Timothy chapter 1 and verse
[29:24] three it reads like
[29:25] this it says I think God who I
[29:31] serve as my forefathers with a pure
[29:36] conscience now that's that's a good
[29:38] condition to be in with a pure
[29:44] conscience that without ceasing I have
[29:47] remembrance of thee in my prayers night
[29:50] and day greatly Desiring to see thee
[29:54] being mindful of thy tears that I may be
[29:58] filled with joy when I call to
[30:02] remembrance the
[30:04] for unforged faith that is in thee
[30:09] notice where this is
[30:11] at which dwell first in thy grandmother
[30:15] Lois and thy mother
[30:18] units I am persuaded that in thee
[30:22] also wherefore I put thee in remembrance
[30:26] that thou stir up the gift of God which
[30:29] is in thee by the putting on of my hands
[30:33] for God has not given us the spirit of
[30:36] fear but of power and of love and of a
[30:39] sound mind we trust the Lord will add a
[30:42] blessing to the reading of his word you
[30:43] may have your
[30:46] seats as um you know the ministry's been
[30:52] ministering to us has been such an
[30:53] inspiration to realize that God is
[30:56] restoring a faith and it's coming our
[30:58] time there's a time that what God had
[31:02] promised it's going to be materialized
[31:04] because he planted a seed within us and
[31:08] as we read the scripture there's
[31:09] something that just jumped out at me
[31:11] while I was in the office I just kind of
[31:14] turned a little bit but it says I will
[31:17] put thee in remembrance that thou stir
[31:20] up the gift of God and I think that's
[31:23] something that we must do is we must
[31:25] stir up the gift of God in our lives you
[31:28] know if if ever we're going to live we
[31:30] want to live by the gift that God has
[31:32] given
[31:33] us you know God has placed a special
[31:37] designation on his bride of Jesus
[31:41] Christ you you're the individual that
[31:44] God has planted something inside of the
[31:46] seed that can respond to the word of God
[31:49] something that can hear what the spirit
[31:51] is saying we want to stir that gift of
[31:54] God up sometimes we forget that we have
[31:57] a gift of God
[31:58] sometimes we go along life and we just
[32:00] try to work things through because well
[32:04] someone has given us a a a spirit of
[32:06] fear who is this this is not God the the
[32:09] scripture said God has not given us the
[32:11] spirit of fear so what what hindereth
[32:15] why do we have this mental oppression
[32:18] why does this condition come upon our
[32:20] minds because someone has tried to give
[32:22] us the spirit of fear yes but oh my
[32:27] thanks be to God that God has sent a
[32:29] comforter God has sent a a word of God
[32:33] that can direct our steps that can put
[32:35] us back on the
[32:37] pathway can point to the cross of
[32:39] Calvary where God had made peace with I
[32:42] mean we have peace with God amen amen I
[32:46] got to thinking
[32:47] about you
[32:49] know the uh message how can I overcome
[32:52] and brother Billy referred to this quote
[32:55] in here and I I just thought you know if
[32:57] if if we can recognize that we have a
[33:00] gift of God that God he's not pleased
[33:03] with just our everyday life he wants us
[33:05] to live by faith he's he's provided a
[33:08] way for us and we want to go into that
[33:10] and let it guide us amen because as we
[33:14] go along in life's journey we realize
[33:15] there's a lot of opposition there's a
[33:18] lot of testing there's a lot of Trials
[33:20] but God has planted something on the
[33:22] inside that can give us Victory and it's
[33:25] actually an attribute of himself yeah
[33:28] amen it has to come to the surface
[33:30] somehow oh
[33:33] my and how kind of over come he says
[33:36] this I want to take a text this morning
[33:38] how can I
[33:39] overcome now I chose this because I
[33:42] think that it's the time that we should
[33:44] never let the spirit of Revival die
[33:47] we've got to keep in Revival constantly
[33:49] revived every day Paul said I Die daily
[33:52] that Christ might live amen we must
[33:56] never let the Revival die within us amen
[34:00] and I'm I'm I'm so thankful that God has
[34:03] provided times where we can Fellowship
[34:05] where we can get together and the
[34:06] expectation can be raised and we can
[34:08] expect God to move amen but as the
[34:11] prophet is telling us we met we don't
[34:14] want to have this uh you know place
[34:17] where we come to where we're like oh we
[34:19] get to where we're just waiting for the
[34:21] ministry to do something or or we're
[34:24] waiting for the next person to do
[34:26] something what what he's telling us is
[34:28] we we don't want to let the spirit of
[34:30] Revival die we got to stir up that gift
[34:32] that's within us amen we're we're going
[34:35] through difficulties but God wants to
[34:36] give us victory in our difficulties he
[34:39] wants us to press into the battle to
[34:41] know my God is going to meet me at the
[34:43] point of need because he said he would
[34:45] he said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[34:47] you I'll be with you even in you to the
[34:49] very end amen so the very difficulties
[34:52] that we're facing now is to reveal his
[34:54] glory in every single one of us the seed
[34:57] the potentials within the seed amen and
[35:00] that seed life has to come to
[35:02] germination by the new birth once the
[35:04] germination has come into the existence
[35:08] amen there's a rest for the believer you
[35:11] come to a place of rest where God now he
[35:13] can say where where is my child I know
[35:15] where to find him when the time and the
[35:18] Trials come I want to manifest my
[35:21] goodness you know there's a lot of
[35:23] voices in this world there's a lot of
[35:25] spirits that are trying to oppress our
[35:28] faith but praise God the test comes to
[35:31] settle the questions amen I have the
[35:33] seat of God in Me I'm going to Stir It
[35:35] Up This devil has come and I have the
[35:38] authority by God's word to call Jesus on
[35:41] the scene the seat of God in Me Is
[35:44] Enough amen with the spirit on the seed
[35:48] it'll bring forth life it'll resurrect
[35:50] me out of this condition amen I believe
[35:54] that amen we never want the spirit of
[35:57] Revival to die and I'm not talking about
[35:59] just experiencing church services but
[36:02] I'm talking about kicking out the trash
[36:04] I'm talking about God beat the the gold
[36:07] that that has impurities out of me I
[36:10] want to see God in Me amen I want
[36:12] Divinity to manifest itself in my very
[36:15] flesh because he paid the price amen he
[36:18] did sanctification justification but
[36:21] this is the hour this is where the Holy
[36:24] Ghost is to come and embody a people
[36:26] that are reviv that's stirring up the
[36:29] gift of God in their lives amen isn't
[36:31] that wonderful God promised it he said I
[36:35] I won't leave you comfortless but I'll
[36:37] be with you and then all of a sudden
[36:39] we're looking into the mirror of God's
[36:40] word the promise of the hour has come

[36:46] the glory of God has come it's your day

[37:03] is here amen receive it tonight amen God
[37:07] wants to give us the spirit of Revival
[37:10] to kick out the trash to I I don't I'm
[37:13] not going to settle with this I'm not
[37:14] going to camp out with this thing they
[37:16] said it's a genetic thing where you go
[37:18] through depression but I'm telling you I
[37:20] heard a word amen that that God that's
[37:23] in me is greater than this depression
[37:25] I'm not going to bow down to it yeah I'm
[37:28] going to lift Jesus up amen I'm not
[37:31] settling for nothing less but Jesus
[37:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[37:36] forever
[37:38] amen amen I thought I was just going to
[37:41] do a little teaching
[37:50] tonight praise God to stir up the gift
[37:52] amen
[37:58] oh my did you did you notice the
[38:02] arrangement of that set with me in my
[38:05] Throne not on my throne in my Throne
[38:09] that is his
[38:11] Dominion as Christ is
[38:14] ruler Throne ruler at this time of a
[38:19] complete domain of God so will the
[38:22] church be with him the bride with him in
[38:26] his throne the the entire domain not on
[38:29] my throne but in my
[38:31] Throne see his domain reaches the throne
[38:35] is over a domain Hallelujah the domain
[38:39] reaches as far as its boundaries does
[38:42] amen and it's from eternity to Eternity
[38:45] just think of it oh my and here we are
[38:48] in this little hickey of
[38:50] time what what is the trial to our God
[38:54] Amen the solution has come the answer
[38:57] has come and it's in you
[39:01] amen my now as we study this my purpose
[39:05] of this is just not to come and have
[39:07] fellowship with you people but I love to
[39:09] do that but if I had a chance I would go
[39:12] to your homes and shake your hands and
[39:13] talk with you sit down eat dinner and
[39:16] sit down under a shade tree and talk and
[39:18] fellowship but when we come here we are
[39:22] here for one specific purpose this is
[39:25] the house of correction this is the
[39:28] throne this is the Throne of God and
[39:31] judgment Goes Forth from the house of
[39:33] God and here is where we come together
[39:38] gathered in love with one another as
[39:41] only Christians can love but in here we
[39:46] are we are under a leadership of the
[39:48] Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is among
[39:51] us and we're here to be take Reckoning
[39:54] among us to see where our short places
[39:57] are our shortcomings and how we can
[40:01] catch from where we should be over to
[40:05] where we ought to be where we are and
[40:09] where we ought to
[40:10] be and that's what we study Minister
[40:13] study these places for their people that
[40:17] they see the people the lack and begin
[40:19] at that oh my if we didn't have a
[40:23] message how would it be clear for the
[40:25] ministry this is a sure moral word of
[40:28] Prophecy this is very clear yes we see
[40:31] the lack and I believe that sometimes we
[40:34] get to where we get in a
[40:36] routine we get to doing it and it has to
[40:38] be the way that otherwise we get
[40:40] uncomfortable well I heard brother
[40:42] brandom say we want to get comfortable
[40:44] enough to get saved get somebody else
[40:47] saved we want to take that old
[40:51] mindset that old mental way of thinking
[40:54] and lay that to the side long enough
[40:57] that the spirit of revival can come and
[41:00] say I am not going to let the defeats of
[41:02] yesterday hold me back from having a
[41:05] Revival today I'm going to stir up the
[41:08] gift that's within
[41:10] me it's so easy to get in a rut where
[41:13] that mental battle that oppresses us
[41:16] you'll always have this you'll always be
[41:19] this but praise God we can fight the
[41:22] devil just like our sisters and start
[41:24] quoting the word of God
[41:28] that's thus sayith the Lord that's going
[41:30] to have dominion over my heart it'll
[41:34] renew my mind and it'll bring this body
[41:37] subject to my testimony because that's
[41:39] the formula I believe it and God's the
[41:43] one that's obligated if you really from
[41:46] sincerity and belief in Your Heart Take
[41:49] the word of God put it on your lips with
[41:51] a believing heart there's nothing can
[41:54] stop it that's what faith does th for
[41:57] the believer it doesn't matter if you
[42:00] don't see it for 25 years the father of
[42:04] our faith waited he was longsuffering he
[42:08] believed God was able to perform what he
[42:16] promised you know it's definitely one of
[42:18] those times
[42:20] where you know when we when we go
[42:23] through difficulties and we know that
[42:25] there's things in our lives
[42:27] that aren't right and we we want the
[42:30] Revival to drive out those
[42:33] negativity because we want to be those
[42:36] types of people that realize the full
[42:38] promise God is conditioning our heart
[42:42] our spirit our
[42:44] atmosphere that we won't have no
[42:46] pretense we don't have to have no fronts
[42:49] we can be exactly who God made us to
[42:53] be you'll be the best version of you
[42:55] when you and God become one and you'll
[42:58] let go of everything else that has ever
[43:01] tried to hinder you from serving God
[43:03] with all of your heart that's what we're
[43:05] striving for that's what we're Desiring
[43:07] is to see God come in such a way that he
[43:11] can have
[43:12] preeminence that he can take full
[43:14] control not just of our present but of
[43:16] our past and our future we have to learn
[43:19] to let go we have to surrender to God
[43:23] and it's not a one-time deal because we
[43:24] learn to surrender more and more and
[43:26] more more every day we learn to let go
[43:30] of different things that this person it
[43:32] wasn't right that they did this such and
[43:34] such or I didn't do certain something
[43:36] right but you know from sincerity we can
[43:39] go and confess our faults you know the
[43:42] love of God says you know what even if
[43:44] they reject me even if they turned away
[43:46] my Lord was rejected so I have the
[43:48] potential on the inside to do what's
[43:50] right no matter
[43:51] what I can be free I can be
[43:55] liberated the holy GH ghost has come to
[43:58] liberate us to bring us into the
[44:01] promised land it's a land of promise
[44:04] [Music]
[44:06] amen that we can worship Him in spirit
[44:08] and in
[44:11] truth praise
[44:16] God you know overcome means to keep life
[44:19] in you you know if we're going to have
[44:22] this revival we're going to have to keep
[44:24] life in us you know when the en enemy
[44:27] comes in like a flood the spirit of God
[44:30] raises a standard against it amen and
[44:32] there's so many voices there's so many
[44:35] spirits coming in to try to infiltrate
[44:38] our minds just to keep us busy just to
[44:41] keep us looking down but we have a
[44:44] message amen we have something on the
[44:47] inside that can rise above our
[44:51] condition faith in the word of God will
[44:54] give you sight for the victory even
[44:56] though you're you're bound in a
[44:58] condition tonight
[45:04] amen we must keep life in
[45:08] us you know we must live constantly in
[45:13] the Life of Christ you know it's so easy
[45:16] to live in our own life you know it's so
[45:19] easy for us to Aspire to be like
[45:22] somebody else that's having Revival you
[45:25] know we don't want to lower our
[45:27] standards we want to Rejoice with those
[45:29] who Rejoice but God has some don't bow
[45:32] down for anything less than your
[45:36] Revival where God has full
[45:41] control now this is not going to be
[45:45] taken very easily this is going to have
[45:48] to be taken by
[45:50] force death is is in one way it's easy
[45:55] but in another way
[45:58] I mean when when we go through like
[46:00] chastisement for the moment is not
[46:02] pleasant but afterwards if we can start
[46:05] looking for the afterwards you know by
[46:08] faith saying you know what I'm going to
[46:09] let the hand of God because God chastens
[46:12] those who he loves and we want to
[46:15] understand the love of
[46:16] God God is a god of love can you imagine
[46:20] if parents would just be like ah you
[46:22] know Junior you can play in the in the
[46:24] street if you want to I mean God will
[46:27] protect you you know traffic and all no
[46:32] a real father a real mother will go out
[46:34] there and correct them say there's
[46:37] dangers that are out there that you
[46:41] might not understand today but you're
[46:43] going to understand later just trust me
[46:47] so when God comes with his correcting
[46:49] hand it's his love for us it brings us
[46:51] back into the right relationship that he
[46:54] desires amen so we want to be able to
[46:57] let go of some of these things that are
[46:59] trying to keep us reminds me of the S
[47:02] and the you know the parable of of the s
[47:06] that sowed seed in the different three
[47:08] different conditions that's the way we
[47:10] get sometimes there's cares of the world
[47:13] and the the pressures for Rich all these
[47:16] things they try to choke out the very
[47:18] life in you to manifest his glory to
[47:21] manifest things that brings you that
[47:24] complete joy and satisfaction that says
[47:27] I'm a Believer and tell somebody about
[47:30] it amen what we have what we possess is
[47:33] worthy to be told to somebody amen
[47:36] that's what God do he did that in this
[47:38] generation he manifest The Word of
[47:41] Promise and we've got it we've got the
[47:43] cloud of witness you know it it's all
[47:46] around us amen and he tells about it
[47:49] amen we want to be outdoing and
[47:52] testifying The Works of God I I so
[47:54] appreciate it we want to stir this gift
[47:57] up don't don't let the Revival die when
[48:00] God does something for you continue to
[48:01] testify don't let go don't stop the
[48:04] devil will try to get you to go back
[48:06] don't you just keep testifying be like a
[48:09] John Ryan it didn't matter it was two
[48:12] three weeks but he said praise God extra
[48:14] extra I'm healed amen the mockery might
[48:18] come the voices will come but you keep
[48:20] testifying and one day it's going to be
[48:22] your hour one day it's going to be your
[48:24] moment amen just keep going forward
[48:27] believing
[48:29] amen
[48:31] my this is the age of the personal life
[48:34] of Christ amen see God has now cleansed
[48:38] a place for us and set aside he
[48:41] Sanctified a place that we can serve him
[48:44] praise God I I want to revive my heart
[48:47] to recognize God has placed us in a a
[48:51] time and an hour where we have the
[48:53] opportunity to serve God like no other
[48:57] age what a privilege amen I don't want
[49:01] to miss my opportunity I don't want to
[49:03] be just so bound down to the cares of
[49:05] life and all of these things that clog
[49:08] up the channel like you know it's like
[49:10] praise God I can renew my mind I can
[49:12] read my Bible and one day just like he
[49:15] said he would he would come by and
[49:17] Quicken the word to us that's the spirit
[49:20] is the only thing that can Quicken the
[49:22] word so that's why we want to get in the
[49:24] spirit of Jesus Christ and say revive me
[49:26] to this reality
[49:32] amen
[49:40] amen now the thing you have to overcome
[49:45] is yourself your idea your thing and
[49:48] surrender yourself to him he overcome
[49:51] for you and he knows the way oh I love
[49:54] that I love that because because a lot
[49:57] of times it's just our human nature we
[49:59] get into a condition and we begin to
[50:02] automatically it's just automatic we
[50:04] start trying to figure things out that's
[50:06] just our nature but if we can recognize
[50:09] that God he's already overcome for us he
[50:14] overcome death he overcome the grave he
[50:16] overcome hell he overcame
[50:20] Temptation I I think about this whenever
[50:23] he was born they mocked him and
[50:25] ridiculed him because even though the
[50:28] scriptures said that have come the same
[50:31] way we have to overcome by the word of
[50:33] God and he was 12 years old and he's
[50:37] going to the synagogues and he's
[50:39] teaching can you imagine a
[50:41] 12-year-old standing
[50:44] here all of a sudden he just he starts
[50:47] teaching and all of their eyes are like
[50:50] I mean he he's talking of an
[50:52] eternal God and they're they're just
[50:56] like where where did he get this wisdom
[50:58] can you imagine what he had to overcome
[51:00] when Mary came and says your father and
[51:03] I have been seeking you with tears can
[51:06] you imagine he he could have
[51:08] said oh really but he came back with the
[51:13] word cu the word always corrects the
[51:15] error he said don't you know I must be
[51:18] about my father's business even though
[51:20] there was a pressure all of the
[51:21] Sanhedrin all of the ministry was there
[51:24] witnessing to Mary denying her own
[51:26] testimony she was the very one that saw
[51:29] the angel Gabriel visit her and said
[51:32] that which is in you is of the Holy
[51:33] Ghost but in a moment yes in a certain
[51:37] condition all of a sudden the pressure a
[51:41] spirit of fear maybe Came Upon her oh my
[51:44] son where is he oh my but he overcome by
[51:49] the word of God and by humility he said
[51:52] don't you know I must be about my
[51:53] father's business and he was going in
[51:56] straight out the clergy amen that's the
[51:59] same for this
[52:00] day there was a man sent from God oh my
[52:04] but the church World they have pushed
[52:07] out Christ and now he's knocking trying
[52:09] to get back in and now it's to the
[52:11] individual praise God for individuals
[52:14] that are in Revival that are not pushing
[52:17] back God when he wants to come and
[52:19] correct the error that's what I'm
[52:20] believing for in my
[52:22] life I believe that God has not finished
[52:25] with me yet but I believe that he's got
[52:28] that hammer just like they they beat the
[52:30] gold and every time he beats it's just
[52:33] getting more pure gold more pure gold so
[52:36] he can see the reflection of himself
[52:44] amen now look friends I believe they're
[52:47] taping this and if it's on the the tape
[52:50] pardon
[52:51] me whatever you do listen
[52:54] now who will listen and Hereafter the
[52:57] hour is very late and you do not you do
[53:00] have good intentions but be caught
[53:04] inside now don't
[53:06] struggle not him that willth nor him
[53:09] that runneth but God just let
[53:13] God that's that's as
[53:15] simple just let
[53:18] God just yield yourself to him and walk
[53:21] on with a perfect satisfied faith that
[53:26] what God has promised he is able to
[53:28] perform not joining one
[53:31] denomination another denomination
[53:33] running this that or the other trying
[53:36] this just yield yourself to God and walk
[53:39] with him peaceful
[53:43] quiet not interrupted just keep on
[53:46] walking with him that's right oh that
[53:50] sounds pretty good but you know what you
[53:52] have the potential to do that the
[53:54] prophet wouldn't be speaking that if
[53:56] that's seed inside doesn't have the
[53:58] potential there's got to be something
[54:00] that will
[54:06] respond that's what I told our brother
[54:09] who just had a breakdown see just yield
[54:13] to him he's here he knows what you have
[54:16] done and what caused you your being and
[54:20] doing this way and all of that he knows
[54:23] all about it he knows all about you and
[54:26] now he just told you back there what to
[54:29] do now I said only thing you need to do
[54:34] is just go do it and that is I'm glad he
[54:38] didn't just leave it
[54:39] there he said forget all of the Past
[54:42] walk live for the future in the glory
[54:45] and presence of God Amen I thank God
[54:48] that we had a prophet that was
[54:50] transparent you know one of the things
[54:52] that I I so appreciate about the
[54:54] Servants of God is they're transparent
[54:57] when they make a mistake or they go
[54:59] through difficulties they're willing to
[55:01] open up you know brother brandham said
[55:04] in a message called reaction to an
[55:06] action I believe is how it's titled but
[55:09] you know he was all tore up and they
[55:11] were going through the case where they
[55:13] said that because he signed the checks
[55:15] and different things for the the
[55:18] expenses on their campaigns that it was
[55:21] his money and they had him for five
[55:24] years over this deal and you know the
[55:27] attorney had called and he's like I just
[55:30] he was under the load and he pushed back
[55:31] from the table and he started headed out
[55:33] and he said tell him I'm not here and he
[55:35] walked out and you know it was said that
[55:40] you know Ma was saying you know that's
[55:41] not right and different things and you
[55:44] know he goes to pray for a little baby
[55:47] and the Spirit came and said you know
[55:50] you're going to go pray for that baby he
[55:53] said wait a minute I gotta go make
[55:55] something right first
[55:56] you know and I believe that that spirit
[55:59] is timid and we can walk right over it
[56:02] but we've been given an example when we
[56:06] if we really want the Revival and the
[56:08] liberty of God's spirit we want to kick
[56:11] out the trash we want to kick out these
[56:13] little things that we try to make
[56:14] excuses for things that are not right in
[56:16] our lives we want the spirit of God to
[56:19] come and cleanse us because it's very
[56:21] simple we just confess our wrongs plead
[56:24] the blood and God is faithful to to
[56:26] cleanse us if we want Revival if we want
[56:29] the Purity the conscious the
[56:31] Consciousness that God is present many
[56:34] times people the reason why they do the
[56:37] things they do they don't recognize his
[56:39] presence right they get into conditions
[56:42] and they just somehow
[56:43] forget they're like I don't understand I
[56:46] don't recognize I can do this and I
[56:48] don't feel wrong I can just go ahead and
[56:50] continue on but there is seed inside
[56:53] that's a part of God and you take him
[56:55] everywhere where you go you want to
[56:57] recognize his presence don't grieve the
[57:00] spirit of God he is with you he will
[57:03] help you call upon him he's an
[57:06] everpresent help in a time of trouble
[57:08] amen God is more willing to help you
[57:11] than you are to be helped that's
[57:13] according to the word of God the hard
[57:16] part is is to walk humbly before him
[57:19] because we don't want to be humiliated
[57:21] we have a pride and an ego we have an
[57:24] arrogance we have press PR we have
[57:27] popularity we have so much we're so full
[57:30] but God's saying if you want what I have
[57:33] you can't have the world and my kingdom
[57:36] also you make your choice to you that
[57:39] will overcome that I will grant to you
[57:42] to sit with me in my
[57:45] Throne God showed us the way he gave us
[57:48] the
[57:48] example he he said you don't know these
[57:52] things Peter I love the communion
[57:53] scripture he says but you don't know
[57:55] these things right now what I'm doing
[57:57] for you but you'll know after and
[58:00] sometimes that's the same with us I love
[58:02] the examples because Peter you know he
[58:05] got real jealous he's like well you're
[58:07] never going to wash my feet but then he
[58:09] said if if I don't wash your feet you
[58:10] ain't clean he said whoa and see that's
[58:13] how we do we do like Peter and we say
[58:15] well wash my hands and my head also you
[58:18] know he just man we go for everything
[58:20] then but instead of the word just says
[58:23] you know what you're you're clean by the
[58:25] w word that I spoke to you if you'll
[58:28] believe my word and take it in your
[58:30] heart you're free from the bondage you
[58:33] can go
[58:38] free sanctify them by the truth Thy word
[58:41] is
[58:43] truth there's never been a more Sublime
[58:47] scripture according to the description
[58:49] by our prophet he said I sanctify myself
[58:52] for them oh my to think that you were in
[58:57] a condition I was in
[59:00] bondage I didn't have any hope of
[59:03] Liberty but because somebody Sanctified
[59:07] themselves because he knew without that
[59:09] I couldn't go
[59:11] free oh my to think that he loved us so
[59:15] much that he willingly no man can take
[59:17] my life I lay it
[59:19] down and no man could say this
[59:22] statement but the Creator God himself he
[59:25] says
[59:26] I Lay My Life down and I'll take it up
[59:30] again and that same God is in you so if
[59:34] you'll lay down your life he'll say the
[59:38] same thing in your life I'll take my
[59:41] life up again
[59:44] amen that's the promise of God's word
[1:00:01] now this is where brother Billy jumped
[1:00:02] in and kind of got me realizing this is
[1:00:05] so rich but in 92 it says
[1:00:13] see maybe we'll read 91 notice each
[1:00:16] Church age the same overcome when they
[1:00:19] when each son out of each Church age
[1:00:22] overcome the temptation of that age I
[1:00:26] got the scripture here I don't think we
[1:00:28] really have time to make it but we know
[1:00:32] that each one of the church age is the
[1:00:34] same now it's just like someone who see
[1:00:38] as I said at the beginning you are born
[1:00:41] defeated and that birth will never bring
[1:00:43] you to life but you're born
[1:00:47] defeated and in a defeated World in a
[1:00:51] defeated amongst defeated people among
[1:00:54] defeated creeds
[1:00:56] defeated denominations you've got to
[1:00:59] come to Victory some way oh and I love
[1:01:02] that and that the story of the Lily just
[1:01:05] it just it just speaks so much to my
[1:01:08] heart and I you know I'm so thankful for
[1:01:11] it but maybe if we just read another
[1:01:14] little bit and see if the Lord will open
[1:01:16] something to us but it says it's just
[1:01:19] like a lily where Lily I think is one of
[1:01:22] the most prettiest flowers there there
[1:01:25] is
[1:01:26] I'm fond of the Great caes and the pond
[1:01:29] lies I think there's nothing hardly as
[1:01:31] pretty as a great big Pond Lily they
[1:01:34] call it a cow Lily how it's
[1:01:37] Radiance now where does it come
[1:01:40] from it's a little seed down at the
[1:01:43] bottom of the muddy Mucky Pond and that
[1:01:46] little seed yet all of the radiance
[1:01:49] that's ever to shine in it is in it
[1:01:52] right then then it's in the mud when it
[1:01:56] is in the
[1:01:57] mud but it has to strive daily knowing
[1:02:02] that there is something it's black it's
[1:02:04] dirty it's Mucky it's slimy in the Slime
[1:02:08] that is living in yet it presses its way
[1:02:11] through the mud and muck and Waters and
[1:02:15] stagnant places until it sticks his head
[1:02:17] above in the light and expresses what
[1:02:21] had been hid all the
[1:02:23] time amen you know that helps me so much
[1:02:26] because I can look at my condition I can
[1:02:28] look at my flesh I can look at my past I
[1:02:31] can look at it and recognize that was
[1:02:34] the mud that was the the diff you know
[1:02:36] the different the stagnant places can
[1:02:39] you imagine when you got stuck you got
[1:02:42] stuck as a Christian but you were in the
[1:02:44] water you were in the mud but you still
[1:02:46] had the potentials of God but something
[1:02:48] is pulling the the the sunlight of God's
[1:02:51] word is pulling that life to the surface
[1:02:54] amen so we just keep deess and even
[1:02:56] though we're going through a stagnant
[1:02:58] Place God is drawing us
[1:03:03] amen so I think that's an overcomer once
[1:03:06] in sin did things that was wrong don't
[1:03:09] worry about it now you have the
[1:03:11] permission you have the Liberty I have
[1:03:13] the
[1:03:15] Liberty if if you you want true Liberty
[1:03:20] you have to lay those things down you
[1:03:23] have to let those things that are behind
[1:03:26] stay there let him
[1:03:31] go
[1:03:34] amen God by his predestination see he
[1:03:37] brought this seed to life and it's
[1:03:40] pressing itself see coming to light and
[1:03:43] now on the top of all of that it has
[1:03:46] overcome see it doesn't Express itself
[1:03:50] down there it's getting up here to
[1:03:53] express itself neither did you in your
[1:03:56] sins and your adultery and everything
[1:03:59] that you lived in you didn't Express
[1:04:02] nothing you know I thank God for that
[1:04:06] because you know a lot of times we hold
[1:04:10] on to things that we have in the past
[1:04:13] whether they're good bad or indifferent
[1:04:15] sometimes it's harder to let go of the
[1:04:16] bad than a good but there's always two
[1:04:19] sides right sometimes we take these good
[1:04:22] qualities well I was a good this and I
[1:04:23] was a good that and we try to measure
[1:04:26] our worth based on our good or our bad
[1:04:29] but he's saying you didn't Express
[1:04:31] nothing that's right you want Revival if
[1:04:34] you let those things stay into your
[1:04:37] present you didn't Express nothing with
[1:04:39] that it's no good
[1:04:41] now we got to rise above it we got to
[1:04:43] stick our head in the sunlight of God's
[1:04:46] word the message of the hour
[1:04:51] amen you didn't Express nothing but
[1:04:53] there's a little seed in there and and
[1:04:55] it got a chance to press itself into the
[1:04:57] light and now you're in the presence of
[1:05:00] Jesus Christ with the sunlight it
[1:05:03] brought you out what you really was in
[1:05:06] the beginning you see what I mean you
[1:05:09] saw the light you bloomed out you laid
[1:05:13] your heart open and now you're a
[1:05:16] lily you remember my sermon on Lily the
[1:05:20] Lily Reverend
[1:05:21] Lily how he toils and yet does not he
[1:05:25] not spin yet Solomon in all his glory is
[1:05:29] not a Raiden like one of
[1:05:31] the look at
[1:05:33] him he's ready not taking nothing for
[1:05:37] himself the Lily don't care nothing
[1:05:39] about himself what does he do he throws
[1:05:42] his Beauty out his life that others
[1:05:46] might see his life is expressed out that
[1:05:50] others might see the glory what is in
[1:05:53] him that was in him him in the mud now
[1:05:57] he's on the top you know I think that
[1:06:01] sometimes we hold back you know and I'm
[1:06:03] speaking for myself sometimes we hold
[1:06:05] back you know we have pretense but
[1:06:08] that's part of the the battle that we
[1:06:11] must overcome we must overcome it but if
[1:06:14] you're not aware of it how are you going
[1:06:16] to ask God to help you overcome it it's
[1:06:18] time to get honest I want to be honest
[1:06:20] and say you know
[1:06:22] what I'm not in this condition I care
[1:06:26] for
[1:06:27] myself we do we do but what he's saying
[1:06:31] is you have the potential to let go and
[1:06:33] fully trust your cares all into his
[1:06:36] hands
[1:06:38] amen that's where the Liberty is that's
[1:06:42] where freedom
[1:06:46] is the Lily don't care nothing about
[1:06:49] himself he just gives it out for others
[1:06:53] that others might see and that's an
[1:06:56] overcomer he overcome the mud he
[1:06:58] overcome the things of the world now he
[1:07:00] freely gives himself out everybody can
[1:07:03] look at him his life you can't put a
[1:07:05] finger on it he's a real Overcomer you
[1:07:08] can't say nothing about him he's come
[1:07:11] out of the mud he's not in the mud now
[1:07:13] he's on top amen he can't put and point
[1:07:16] back to what he was what he is now he's
[1:07:19] on the top amen oh my then the bees come
[1:07:24] by and say oh that's wonderful perfume I
[1:07:27] believe I'll go and get up my part
[1:07:34] my he just opens up his heart come on
[1:07:37] now every all right
[1:07:40] everything takes him takes from him he's
[1:07:44] a real Pastor he expressed the glory of
[1:07:46] God look where he come from he had to
[1:07:50] overcome to do that you know as we're
[1:07:53] reading the the message
[1:07:56] you point that thing that you know that
[1:08:00] God is dealing with your heart say I
[1:08:02] must overcome that because I there's
[1:08:05] something about this test because now
[1:08:09] understand that the test is the greatest
[1:08:11] thing that ever happened to you because
[1:08:13] that's the Proving
[1:08:15] Ground because that's where God he says
[1:08:17] now those I love I Chas and rebuke so
[1:08:20] this test was brought upon us to bring
[1:08:23] out the glory and grace of God just like
[1:08:25] our pastor was talking about that blind
[1:08:27] man in John N where he was just born and
[1:08:30] all of a sudden all these people were
[1:08:32] starting to make all these different
[1:08:33] accusations and they were just coming in
[1:08:35] and that's what our mind does making
[1:08:37] accusations about your past and about
[1:08:39] your present and about your future but
[1:08:41] he's got a narrative but we must stand
[1:08:43] on the word of God and turn that devil
[1:08:45] and cause him to flee say devil I'm
[1:08:48] resisting you in the name of Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[1:08:52] of God God has allowed me to go through
[1:08:55] the test that the glory of God might be
[1:08:58] made known in my life and then it
[1:09:00] wouldn't just be my life but then others
[1:09:02] will hear the word of Life the word of
[1:09:04] God for deliverance or or salvation or
[1:09:07] healing and then they'll take heart
[1:09:09] they'll say praise God if God he's no
[1:09:12] respector of persons he did it for that
[1:09:14] person if I'll take the word of God and
[1:09:16] do like they did God's obligated to me
[1:09:19] cuz he doesn't change if we'll approach
[1:09:22] it in the same way God is obligated amen
[1:09:25] that's just simple it's just the way God
[1:09:27] loves to do is to perform his word to
[1:09:31] us
[1:09:36] amen praise the
[1:09:41] Lord
[1:09:44] now in 99 says one
[1:09:47] time he or she was a young and fair
[1:09:51] beautiful they had a lot of Temptations
[1:09:53] to go through but they they overcome
[1:09:56] that and they overcome now they're
[1:09:58] expressing the real beauty of Christ in
[1:10:00] their life and they're expressing
[1:10:03] through the mud Jesus gave us the
[1:10:06] example how to do it amen now we want to
[1:10:10] know how to
[1:10:12] overcome Jesus told us how to do
[1:10:16] it see humility he GED himself and took
[1:10:20] a towel and washed his disciples feet
[1:10:24] the very god of Heaven humiliated
[1:10:28] himself now we don't want to be
[1:10:30] humiliated and that's the reason women
[1:10:32] don't want their hair grow long grow out
[1:10:36] the the reason they don't want to dress
[1:10:38] L like ladies dress like men don't want
[1:10:42] to see the same thing they don't want to
[1:10:45] get
[1:10:46] humiliated but Jesus constantly look who
[1:10:49] he was greatness I'm going to say
[1:10:51] something greatness humiliates itself
[1:10:55] greatness humbles itself greatness amen
[1:10:59] that's you know you have the potentials
[1:11:03] but who wants to sign up for humiliation
[1:11:05] but that's part of getting uncomfortably
[1:11:08] comfortable part of part of what this
[1:11:11] revival is going to do is going to break
[1:11:13] down walls it's going to break down
[1:11:16] patterns where we can actually get
[1:11:18] outside of ourself enough that God can
[1:11:20] come in it's uncomfortable it's
[1:11:22] nerve-wracking I never thought I would
[1:11:24] be trying to speak or anything in front
[1:11:27] of people but praise God that God has
[1:11:30] some Potentials in the believer that he
[1:11:32] wants to stir up the gift of God that we
[1:11:35] can let God have his way and then he can
[1:11:37] produce just like what that little boy
[1:11:39] was playing hookie from school he had a
[1:11:41] little bit of bread and a few fish and
[1:11:44] oh he fed 5,000 amen just imagine the
[1:11:47] life that's in you the potentials can
[1:11:49] feed
[1:11:50] thousands don't ever lower your sights
[1:11:53] of the potentials that's in you you stir
[1:11:55] up that gift that's in you go and tell
[1:11:58] somebody of the love of Christ how you
[1:12:01] met him how he changed your life how he
[1:12:03] did for you exceedingly abundantly what
[1:12:05] you could ever think or ask or even
[1:12:08] imagine our God is great he's wonderful
[1:12:11] he's powerful he's Almighty he can break
[1:12:14] down shackles he can bring the love of
[1:12:16] Christ and where wounds have been he can
[1:12:19] heal up the wounded
[1:12:21] hearted those who've been broken for
[1:12:24] years and years and years years I'm a
[1:12:26] witness years of spine disease years of
[1:12:30] Affliction God rich in Mercy he come my
[1:12:35] way
[1:12:37] amen willing to be humble willing to be
[1:12:41] humiliated my but if he did that for us
[1:12:45] Oh my he had a purpose in doing it
[1:12:59] you know in overcoming we want to know
[1:13:02] what brother brandham taught because
[1:13:04] it's got to be something that as we're
[1:13:06] going through the Battle Ground as we're
[1:13:08] going through difficulties that these
[1:13:11] things have tried to take root in our
[1:13:13] flesh and then we tried to sympathize
[1:13:15] with it and we're saying it's not as bad
[1:13:17] as this and that and the other but we
[1:13:19] don't want no ground for the devil in
[1:13:21] our lives and so we want to recognize
[1:13:24] the devil and every one of of his tricks
[1:13:26] you know that's part of overcoming part
[1:13:28] of overcoming is we must keep life in us
[1:13:31] we must stay in Revival we must uh you
[1:13:35] know
[1:13:36] just walk by the word amen surrendering
[1:13:40] ourselves walking humility but
[1:13:42] recognizing the devil in every one of
[1:13:44] his tricks he said now the devil's not a
[1:13:47] thought you got to recognize the devil
[1:13:50] real and when you recognize him real
[1:13:53] he's not just a thought but he's a real
[1:13:54] devil and he's after you right but at
[1:13:57] the same time of recognizing that he's
[1:13:59] real and that he's after you you also
[1:14:01] want to recognize that God is in you and
[1:14:05] he's greater and more Mighty than the
[1:14:07] devil and his
[1:14:08] afflictions now if you know that there's
[1:14:11] something on the inside that is greater

[1:14:50] God into my heart I claim it that's my
[1:14:53] promise I'm not looking at the condition
[1:14:56] of the current circumstances those are
[1:14:58] lying vanities like Jonah uh yeah Jonah
[1:15:01] he was in the well I mean there was a a
[1:15:05] a report that he heard that even Solomon
[1:15:08] when he was dedicating the temple he
[1:15:10] says if if there be people of God that
[1:15:13] ever get in trouble and you remember
[1:15:15] when this Temple was dedicated for the
[1:15:17] purposes of God you just call upon God
[1:15:20] and you'll be saved in the midst of your
[1:15:22] trial he looked this way it was big
[1:15:25] predicament Wells belly big predicament
[1:15:27] this way Wells belly I mean it was all
[1:15:29] around it but you know what he said
[1:15:31] these are lying vanities once more will
[1:15:33] I look unto the promised
[1:15:36] Giver I believe it and therefore I speak
[1:15:39] it amen and
[1:15:41] who oh my to think that God is hid in
[1:15:45] Simplicity when he goes in in this
[1:15:48] generation when they're rededicating the
[1:15:50] temple or the Tabernacle and the seals
[1:15:54] have been revealed
[1:15:55] and it's God in Simplicity God and man
[1:15:57] uniting amen and now you too when you're
[1:16:01] in trouble you can Proclaim and say this
[1:16:03] is lying vanities that's lying vanities
[1:16:06] this is lying vanities but once more I
[1:16:08] will look to the god who's present not
[1:16:11] Somewhere In The Ether but right here in
[1:16:13] me
[1:16:14] amen my God can deliver
[1:16:18] me and because he cared so much to make
[1:16:21] that prayer and that Proclamation God
[1:16:23] sent some kind of oxygen tank praise God

[1:16:29] and explain I can't explain how he
[1:16:31] healed me I can't expl but he did

[1:17:04] I'm doing this and I'm doing that then
[1:17:06] you're defeated see we don't want to go
[1:17:08] and start pointing out all the things
[1:17:10] that we are doing wrong yeah we admit it
[1:17:14] put it under the blood it's just like
[1:17:16] it's just like in another place brother

[1:17:33] the same time that as you're going
[1:17:34] through that there's a provision there's
[1:17:36] a God in Me That Is A Healer and he is
[1:17:39] greater and more Mighty and he will
[1:17:41] bring this body into subjection by his
[1:17:44] stripes I'm Healed you have the power of
[1:17:47] the Spoken Word by the third pool to
[1:17:49] take the word of God and put it on your
[1:17:51] lips and when you with a heart of Faith
[1:17:53] it's like deity speaking this Eternal

[1:18:06] deliverance God will bring it to
[1:18:09] pass we're expecting for it one
[1:18:13] testimony two testimony three testimony
[1:18:15] four who's next come on I want to see
[1:18:17] the spirit of Revival coming into the
[1:18:20] believer not the whole church just going
[1:18:22] through orders and no but IND
[1:18:24] individuals coming into the presence of
[1:18:26] God realizing they're an inheritance
[1:18:29] they have a joint they're joint HS they
[1:18:31] have an inheritance it's Incorruptible
[1:18:33] it's not just for the future it's for
[1:18:36] today it's for tomorrow it's for as long
[1:18:39] as we're here amen
[1:18:56] this notice in 107 says overcome the god
[1:19:01] that is in you is greater
[1:19:03] than one that is in him the God of this
[1:19:07] world is not as great as the god of
[1:19:09] Heaven which is in you no more than
[1:19:13] Darkness can stand in the presence of
[1:19:15] light now Darkness cannot stand in the
[1:19:17] presence of light I don't care how dark
[1:19:20] it is light will put it out it can't
[1:19:23] stand Glory
[1:19:25] but you take as much Darkness as you
[1:19:30] want and try to stand against the light
[1:19:32] one time see what happens that's the one
[1:19:36] that's in you is light and the one that
[1:19:39] is in the world is
[1:19:41] Darkness see so the light has proved to
[1:19:46] overcome the darkness and the man that's
[1:19:49] in Christ knows that he overcome the
[1:19:52] world the things of the world
[1:19:55] now he's talking about you amen he says
[1:19:58] the man that's in Christ knows that he's
[1:20:00] overcome the things of the world Amen
[1:20:04] there's no more ties to you at all
[1:20:07] you're free walk in the light as he is
[1:20:09] in the light and the blood of Jesus
[1:20:12] cleanses us from all sin and we have
[1:20:14] Fellowship one with another there you
[1:20:19] are he that is in you is greater than he
[1:20:22] that is in the world now if you look
[1:20:25] back you're condemned then you're still
[1:20:28] in the world but if you're living above
[1:20:31] that then he that is in You Led You
[1:20:34] above the
[1:20:36] darkness like the Lily he's above the
[1:20:40] darkness of the mud he's above the
[1:20:42] darkness of the Muddy Waters he is the
[1:20:45] light reflecting the beauty of that
[1:20:49] which put in him before he left the mud
[1:20:52] amen now I feel like shouting Christian
[1:20:55] Christian what was in there by God at
[1:20:57] the beginning it pressed itself way
[1:21:00] through overcome it overcome the shell
[1:21:04] it overcome the mud it overcome the
[1:21:06] waters it overcome everything and was an
[1:21:10] overcomer and reflected the beauty and
[1:21:13] glory of God Amen isn't that wonderful
[1:21:17] this Old Shell the mud you your
[1:21:20] upbringing doesn't Define you your
[1:21:23] presence stature doesn't Define you the
[1:21:26] waters the situations the circumstances
[1:21:29] the conditions that you're in they don't
[1:21:31] Define
[1:21:32] you the life that's in you defines you
[1:21:36] God has spoken that the same life that
[1:21:40] he that was in him it says in Romans 8
[1:21:43] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:21:45] to those who walk in Jesus Christ they
[1:21:47] won't fulfill the lust of the flesh amen
[1:22:00] my you know he talks about Daniel and
[1:22:03] mesach and the different ones examples I
[1:22:05] love this he says they overcome the mud
[1:22:07] that was around them and packed into
[1:22:10] them they stuck their head above those
[1:22:12] things and shine forth the glory of God
[1:22:15] that's what a real Christian does
[1:22:19] Amen I'm going to have to wind this down
[1:22:22] CU this is this is uh opened up a little
[1:22:26] bit more but you know I think that if we
[1:22:28] recognize our position like Jesus
[1:22:30] recognized his position you know he
[1:22:32] realized that you know he came to a
[1:22:34] place where you know he told Peter and
[1:22:37] the different ones he says now they're
[1:22:39] going to come and they're going to
[1:22:40] crucify me and he he knew that you know
[1:22:44] he he had to endure the difficult he had
[1:22:46] to stand the test because he was going
[1:22:49] to be the lamb offering he was going to
[1:22:52] have to give us an example that we can
[1:22:54] follow because we don't know the way we
[1:22:57] needed someone to overcome for us amen
[1:22:59] and so when we know that he overcome
[1:23:02] everything praise God there's something
[1:23:04] in our lives when we're facing it we're
[1:23:07] saying this is not unique to just me he
[1:23:10] overcame for me and he's in me now to do
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:15] again his potentials CU he's already
[1:23:18] done it once he's already proved that
[1:23:21] he's a he's a Victor over that condition
[1:23:25] he was tempted in all points like humans
[1:23:28] are in every
[1:23:30] way and yet he Sanctified himself my
[1:23:33] what a glorious thing but you know he
[1:23:35] knew his position you know and that's
[1:23:38] part of overcoming is recognizing your
[1:23:40] position is in Christ amen it's not this
[1:23:44] it's not seated in Christian Life
[1:23:47] Tabernacle in Bedford because God might
[1:23:49] have a season where you are planted and
[1:23:52] plucked up but you're still in Christ so
[1:23:54] it doesn't matter your what's your
[1:23:56] location no it's the condition of the
[1:23:59] heart your position in Christ we are now
[1:24:02] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:04] Jesus and you're here believing today
[1:24:07] because before the foundation of the
[1:24:09] world God chose
[1:24:10] you and he ordained you unto good works
[1:24:14] and so in order to work the works of
[1:24:16] Christ we have to overcome ourselves we
[1:24:18] have to get our ideas out because God is
[1:24:20] not going to use our ideas in his word
[1:24:23] and blend it together and make a big
[1:24:25] pottage no it's going to be him both to
[1:24:30] Will and to do of his good pleasure amen
[1:24:34] it's for everybody whosoever will let
[1:24:36] him come partake of the fountain amen
[1:24:39] but Jesus you know in that great
[1:24:41] Temptation he showed us the way and you
[1:24:44] know brother Brandon lays it so plainly
[1:24:46] and I love how he did it but when he was
[1:24:48] in Temptation what was his greatest
[1:24:50] Temptation well after 40 days and 40
[1:24:53] nights he was hungry and the devil came
[1:24:57] tempting
[1:25:02] him you know and he said you're
[1:25:06] hungry turn these stones into
[1:25:08] bread why can you imagine like he
[1:25:12] already
[1:25:13] proved his messiahship you know speaking
[1:25:17] to the woman at the well he already you
[1:25:20] know multiplied the Loaves and Fishes he
[1:25:22] could have done that that's right no
[1:25:25] problem but see the Temptation was is to
[1:25:28] do what the devil told him to do to mine
[1:25:30] the devil and that's the same thing
[1:25:33] he'll the devil will come with his
[1:25:34] proposition he'll come tempting us but
[1:25:37] you were you come here to be tested to
[1:25:40] be tempted of the devil don't forget
[1:25:42] that you and I are come here to prove
[1:25:47] that what God planted is more than a
[1:25:49] match for the
[1:25:51] Temptation we might fail but a good sold
[1:25:54] gets back up say Lord I failed but you
[1:25:57] know what I'm not staying down I'm
[1:25:59] rising up I'm like that
[1:26:02] Lily and you know it was it was
[1:26:05] very difficult and maybe this is where
[1:26:09] I'll you know that this this does so
[1:26:13] much for me to think about the second
[1:26:17] assault That Came Upon Jesus you know he
[1:26:21] tempted him with the hunger and he told
[1:26:23] him the word of God he said man shall
[1:26:25] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:26:28] word of God and he told him because he
[1:26:32] knew his position he said Thou shalt not
[1:26:34] tempt the Lord thy God and he was
[1:26:36] standing in the presence of his
[1:26:39] creator thou will not tempt the Lord thy
[1:26:42] God right there in that moment he was
[1:26:44] correcting the error and showing and
[1:26:46] proving giving an example that we can
[1:26:49] follow amen so in this second assault he
[1:26:54] said says just look and this is in
[1:26:56] paragraph 129 he says just look like the
[1:26:59] time goes so fast the next great assault
[1:27:02] that was made on him is that he would
[1:27:04] show off and how that does hit the
[1:27:07] Servants of God to be a show off show
[1:27:10] what you can do glory to God hallelujah
[1:27:12] I'm a deliverer I'm a so and so see come
[1:27:15] come up here come to the top of the
[1:27:17] mountain and said here he tempted him to
[1:27:20] do it now remember he was tempted to do
[1:27:24] it it's hard said now if you want to be
[1:27:28] something before the people stand here
[1:27:31] at this Temple and jump off see he he
[1:27:34] give you the scripture and as it written
[1:27:37] the Angels charge over thee lest you
[1:27:40] dash your foot at any time against the
[1:27:43] stone and he'll bear thee up you know
[1:27:45] the devil's going to use the word
[1:27:47] against you but you want to recognize
[1:27:49] your position recognize the assault of
[1:27:51] the devil
[1:27:54] to show his authority no true servant
[1:27:56] ever does that you see a man showing off
[1:28:00] his chest out and all like that just
[1:28:04] remember there is something wrong there
[1:28:06] no God don't want that Jesus set the
[1:28:10] example he could have done it he
[1:28:12] certainly could have done it but he
[1:28:14] didn't do it no servant of God shows off
[1:28:18] of himself or tries to take God's power
[1:28:20] and show himself to be something else
[1:28:23] somebody above I love
[1:28:26] this and try to take God's power and
[1:28:30] show himself above somebody else my I
[1:28:35] mean that that's a
[1:28:38] Temptation and the prophet of God is
[1:28:40] saying that that was a Temptation that
[1:28:42] he endured for us amen he gave us an
[1:28:48] example in 139 this is the third great
[1:28:51] assault Satan offered him to Forfeit the
[1:28:53] king kingdoms to
[1:28:56] him he did Satan said see these kingdoms
[1:29:00] of the world these are all mine do it I
[1:29:04] do with them whatever I want to I'll
[1:29:06] forfeit them to you but remember he was
[1:29:10] trying to get him to Forfeit it without
[1:29:13] the
[1:29:14] cross if he did we'd be
[1:29:17] lost he couldn't have taken the kingdom
[1:29:22] but he he must follow the he must come
[1:29:27] back he was tempted to do it death is a
[1:29:31] hard
[1:29:32] thing he was tempted to take his Liberty
[1:29:36] and be the king of the earth without the
[1:29:39] cross but if he did his subjects would
[1:29:42] have died Satan would have gladly made
[1:29:46] that proposition with him but he said
[1:29:49] get thee behind me Satan he didn't do it
[1:29:53] he come and suffered and took the hard
[1:29:55] rugged route he took the route of
[1:29:58] persecution he took the route of death
[1:30:00] are we willing to do this the same route
[1:30:05] that he taken are we willing to die are
[1:30:08] we willing to give ourselves to God
[1:30:11] forfeit all the world and the things to
[1:30:14] serve
[1:30:15] him my what a challenge amen we can
[1:30:19] breathe that one out my it's a it's a
[1:30:22] fearful thing to die but we must die and
[1:30:24] take up our cross he showed us the
[1:30:27] example there's a potential inside to
[1:30:30] lay every weight aside look to Calvary
[1:30:34] be energized stir up that gift you have
[1:30:36] the potential it's in
[1:30:44] you now he
[1:30:48] F willing to Forfeit Satan was to him
[1:30:52] but he didn't do it though Jesus was
[1:30:55] tempted he overcome for us he endured
[1:30:57] all Temptations for me and for you see
[1:31:00] he could have took it right then but
[1:31:03] what did he take the other route for so
[1:31:07] that we could come be with
[1:31:10] him if he paid such a price as that then
[1:31:14] how little would we be not to take
[1:31:17] it when remember there's nothing here
[1:31:21] anyway
[1:31:22] anyhow if you you lived a hundred years
[1:31:26] what are you going to come to mentally
[1:31:28] your mind gone you're all crippled up
[1:31:30] old
[1:31:31] shaky that's where you're going that's
[1:31:34] the end of it you come now overcome the
[1:31:38] thing how do you do it by the
[1:31:41] word what the word says to do walk
[1:31:45] humbly live before
[1:31:48] Jesus he endured all things for you and
[1:31:50] I he is our example how to over come our
[1:31:54] evil generation as he overcome his evil
[1:31:58] generation
[1:32:00] amen amen
[1:32:03] my oh this is just packed
[1:32:06] thick I didn't even get to any of my
[1:32:09] notes but I feel like
[1:32:11] we're we're definitely feeling a little
[1:32:14] bit lighter and I believe that the
[1:32:17] things that are on our heart we've we've
[1:32:19] shared and you know one of the things
[1:32:21] that I I just I feel like we want to be
[1:32:24] more sincere we want to be more
[1:32:26] dedicated to the the call of God and we
[1:32:30] want to call into remembrance like you
[1:32:32] know Paul was getting ready to leave the
[1:32:34] scene and he was telling Timothy all of
[1:32:37] these things you know don't let go of
[1:32:39] this unforged Faith this faith and just
[1:32:42] the definition that I had typed up here
[1:32:45] it says unforged faith is a sincere
[1:32:49] genuine
[1:32:51] faith and it's usually referring to to a
[1:32:54] young or innocent or trusting and you
[1:32:57] can't hide your feelings it's not with
[1:33:00] falsehood or pretense it's genuine
[1:33:04] unforged faith is pure and without
[1:33:06] hypocrisy it means what it says and its
[1:33:09] actions stem from a pure
[1:33:12] motive that's what he's telling Timothy
[1:33:15] and Timothy is now going to be pastoring
[1:33:18] and he's going to have to give charge to
[1:33:22] others he he saying you want to have
[1:33:25] like I've already showed you the example
[1:33:27] I'm doing this with a pure conscience
[1:33:30] there's nothing inhibiting the move of
[1:33:32] the spirit in my life in any
[1:33:35] circumstance right God is able to move
[1:33:38] any place any time anywhere he just
[1:33:40] needs a willing vessel and he's always
[1:33:42] had a witness in tormenting times in
[1:33:46] devastating conditions in ups and downs
[1:33:49] God has Witnesses and he's commissioned
[1:33:51] us we want to go into all the world we
[1:33:54] want to have this revival that people
[1:33:56] look at your life and at my life and
[1:33:58] says what meanest thou
[1:34:02] this what what is this what is the hope
[1:34:05] that you have you realize that there's
[1:34:07] this and there's that in the water do
[1:34:10] you realize there's mud do you realize
[1:34:12] there's the shell do you realize all of
[1:34:15] this stuff I've Rose above it God he's
[1:34:18] Draw Me By the Light of the day and I
[1:34:20] recognize my greatest enemy from the the
[1:34:23] Liberty and the freedom is this old man
[1:34:27] he's my greatest enemy but I'm telling
[1:34:29] you that God is greater and he's inside
[1:34:31] of me and he can do for you
[1:34:34] amen there is a
[1:34:37] sincerity and a consecration that I
[1:34:40] desire that we come into to where that
[1:34:42] we can be free to be who God called us
[1:34:45] we don't have to look to our neighbor
[1:34:46] and say I wish I was like them be who
[1:34:48] God made you to be be free to be the
[1:34:51] child of God that God Made You you
[1:34:54] rejoice I say again Rejoice God has
[1:34:58] brought salvation to us he's brought us
[1:35:00] the hope of a Rapture and soon and very
[1:35:03] soon we are going to see the king
[1:35:07] amen my oh
[1:35:11] my you know I think
[1:35:16] that I think this is the approach that
[1:35:19] you
[1:35:20] know brother brandom just has a way of
[1:35:23] saying certain things and I just wanted
[1:35:24] to share this maybe as I would close and
[1:35:28] just try to stop somewhere but maybe if
[1:35:31] the musicians could come and we'll just
[1:35:34] probably have this as a last
[1:35:41] quote you
[1:35:43] know a lot of times you know we have to
[1:35:47] overcome what people say like job job
[1:35:51] had to overcome what the church people
[1:35:53] people said he had to overcome what his
[1:35:55] wife said he had to overcome all of
[1:35:57] these different sayings of people
[1:36:00] and the way that we overcome is we have
[1:36:03] to have that singleness of heart you
[1:36:06] know I can't if if in my nature I want
[1:36:10] to please everybody well if I'm pleasing
[1:36:12] everybody I ain't pleasing God because I
[1:36:15] can't do both and so we must come into
[1:36:18] such a clear Focus like and I'll read
[1:36:22] the the thought but you know I I want I
[1:36:24] want to be able by the help of God to
[1:36:28] live for an audience of one and be okay
[1:36:31] with that you know if this person says
[1:36:34] you need to do this and you need to do
[1:36:35] that when I get into that closet with
[1:36:38] God and I bow and God begins to speak to
[1:36:41] my heart I want to obey that voice I
[1:36:44] don't want all of the other voices to
[1:36:46] try to manipulate me into moving I want
[1:36:49] to have a pure heart to know that God
[1:36:51] has told me thus and thus and I'm
[1:36:54] standing just like
[1:36:56] C I can't remember his name cartright
[1:36:59] you know he said God told me to have a
[1:37:00] Revival and this this troublemaker's
[1:37:02] come and there's going to be a
[1:37:03] troublemaker come your way so we need to
[1:37:05] get into our closet and know that I got
[1:37:08] a word from the Lord and I'm looking to
[1:37:11] the promise Giver to be a promise Keeper
[1:37:14] in my hour in your time of need amen but
[1:37:17] he says this in expectations in
[1:37:20] 1958 on May 8th he says once there was
[1:37:23] was a young musician who was trained in
[1:37:25] all the music that he knew how to be
[1:37:27] trained in he was he wanted to master it
[1:37:31] and there was a great concert and this
[1:37:34] young fellow was to play and after that
[1:37:36] he had got through his plane his master
[1:37:39] plane and it was Grand and all of the
[1:37:41] people began to stand to their feet and
[1:37:43] applaud the young man and was clapping
[1:37:46] their hands screaming and
[1:37:49] whistling but they noticed the young man
[1:37:52] did not even notice any of that he kept
[1:37:55] his eyes looking up and the more they
[1:37:58] tried to attract his attention by their
[1:38:00] screams and applauding he looked
[1:38:03] steadfastly towards the top of the
[1:38:05] balcony and at at the audience was
[1:38:08] amazed and the audience was amazed to
[1:38:11] see him not accepting or bowing to their
[1:38:14] applauding and they turned to see and up
[1:38:17] in the balcony was the old Master
[1:38:19] teacher he was looking up to see what
[1:38:22] the master said and he paid no attention
[1:38:25] to what the people around him saying if
[1:38:28] we would only do the same if we would
[1:38:31] look up and see the master is saying and
[1:38:34] not notice what people are saying heyen
[1:38:37] if we're going to have this revival if
[1:38:39] we're going to stir up it's not going to
[1:38:42] be a bunch of teachers a bunch of people
