========================================

[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] And let's all stand and sing Tonight, oh Lord, I come to you. Let my heart be changed. Re flowing from the grace that I found in you. Oh Lord, I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me will be stripped away by the power of your love. Hold me. Let your love surround me. Oh, what great me. Draw me to your side. [Music] Oh, and at last I wake I'll rise up like an eagle and I also with you. Your spirit leads me on in the power you love. Oh Lord, open up in my eyes. Let me see you face to face the knowledge of your love as you live in me. Oh Lord, renew my mind as your will unfold in my life in living every day. In the power of your love, hold me close. Let your love surround me. Oh, bring me. Draw me to your side. Oh, and an I rise up like an eagle and I will sow with you. Your spirit leads me on in the power of your love. Sing that second verse again. Oh Lord, I let me see you face to face. Oh, the knowledge of your love as you live in me. [Music] Oh Lord, renew my mind as your will unfolds in my life in living every day. In the power of your love. Holy Lord, let your love surround [Music] me. Oh, bring me near. Oh, draw me to your side. [Music] Oh, and it I rise up like an eagle and I will sore with you. Your spirit leads me on in the power of your love. Hallelujah. Amen. That's what we rely on. It's the power of his love that saves that end. It's the power of love that really brings all that God desire out of us. Amen. We know we can't do it by our own strength. What we desire is for that love to come and work in us. But Jerome, if you could just come and open our service in prayer. Amen. Let's look to God in prayer. Heavenly Father, we come tonight in the precious name of Jesus, Lord, to praise and to magnify your name. We thank you once again for strength in our body, for the activity of our limbs that you woke us up this morning, saved and in our right mind. We are so grateful that you placed the desire within our hearts to be assembled in the house of God. But we know Lord God as we assemble together as a body of believers, Lord God, there are many needs in this great house. Lord God, I pray and ask in the name of Jesus that if we would only keep our mind stayed upon him, Lord God, Lord, even now, Lord God, with the worries and the cares of this world, I pray even now for this sacred hour that we would lay all of our cares and our worries aside. The Bible says, "Cast all of our cares upon him before he carth, Lord." and to come boldly before God's throne of grace and to ask whatever we will in Jesus' name and it shall be done. There's strength and there's power and authority within your word Lord God. I pray tonight, Lord God, that someone would be delivered, Lord God. Even now, somebody is receiving a healing touch, Lord God, simply by being in your presence, Lord God. Those aches and pains seem to vanish away. All the troubles that we have in our families, with our relationships, Lord God, they seem so unimportant in this hour. Help us to sit at your feet, Lord God, and learn from you and not be worried about the cares of this world. I pray for the man of God tonight and for the word of God that you would anoint him aresh, Lord God, that you would use him, Lord God, for your glory. I pray right now for a special touch in his body, Lord God. I pray for new direction and new guidance, Lord God. I pray that you would cast all of his cares away. And I pray that you would open up a window in heaven. Pour him out a blessing, Lord God, that they won't be room to receive for it's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Want to welcome everyone in the house of God. May turn around and welcome someone tonight and all our visitors. God bless you. Amen. [Music] Amen. God bless you. May have your seats. I'd rather have Jesus than save old. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd rather have Jesus that houses all land.

We have couple announcements. Yeah. Amen. There's a an annual meeting uh in uh uh Oklahoma at Brother Wendell Martin. this coming weekend. Uh I'm sorry. It's going to be the September 11th through 14. If you could put that flyer up, that would be helpful. Uh but Matthew will be one of the speakers. So if you interested in going, Amen. that would be wonderful. Amen. Also, there was a I believe there was a email sent out about the Sunday school. Uh it's it's starting this coming Sunday uh September 7th and the classes are going to start at 9:45 a.m. If your child is not uh if your child is not in the class by 10:00 a.m. uh please keep him in the church. If you have not registered your child, please do so by Wednesday, which is today. And registration forms are in the library or you can text Sister Melinda on her phone number. Amen. and she'll take care of it. Amen. Amen. If you have a need upon your heart tonight, Amen. Aren't you glad we're in the presence of the Lord? Amen. He knows all about it and he knows what we have need of. Amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings, if you could come at this time. Amen. Brother Ben, if you could just come and pray for the needs. Amen. Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we count it joy to be in your house, Lord Jesus. Father, I'm reminded of David who spoke that he was happy when they told him, "Let us come into the house of the Lord." Father, in a midweek service like this, in the midst of all that goes on, Lord, sometimes we can make it a routine, Lord. I've been guilty of that myself, Lord. But father, if I could but just open my heart, Lord Jesus, the same God that can move in meetings. The same God that can move when there's plenty of expectation, different people come in with a fire on their heart. You're still the same God on a Wednesday service. Lord, you can still touch the hearts of the people. You can still speak life, Lord Jesus. Father, we just invite you to come, Lord Jesus. Be in our midst, Father. It's all about you. We ask you to have the preeminence, Lord Jesus, in everything that takes place. Father, bless the tithes and the offerings. Bless the man of God that's preparing to come out here and give us something from your throne, Lord Jesus. Speak those words, Lord Jesus, that we might leave and said, "It was good to be in your presence, Lord. That we might be able to go and tell somebody of what a good God we serve, what a mighty God we serve. Father, &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord Jesus. Too many times we forget to tell you just how much we love you, Lord. We just think you know, but Father, you like to hear it from our lips. So, Father, from the bottom of my heart, I say, "I love you, Lord. And I thank you for all that you do. Just have your way in the remaining of the service, Lord Jesus. We ask it in your wonderful, precious, holy, and powerful name. Amen. All there are to you may take all one by side, one path of faith. Oh, and take the word of God. Oh, what you see, why ter [Music] is what will be. Send your wings to the wings of faith. Oh, and you can fly in the higher place. [Music] our struggle. It's by grace set your wings to the wings of faith. Oh, and I watch your knee. Oh, and I watch your cry. Oh, watch your mountain. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, and speak the word of God. And my and my Oh, you won't move. [Music] Oh, you will fly. Oh, set your wings to the wings of [Music] you can fly. [Music] Oh, I do not struggle. It's by grace. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand and sing it as we invite our pastor tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, and watch the go [Music] in the sky. [Music] He does not struggle. He does not work. Oh, and for the power that makes it all [Music] the set of &gt;&gt; Oh, where you can find a [Music] Oh, and do not struggle. It's by grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; And let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, your word is ever true. It's eternal, Father. It hasn't changed and its promises haven't changed, but people changed and the world's changed, but you've remained the same. &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you to bless our memory and bring us back to the ways of our fathers. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. If you have your Bibles and you'll turn with me to uh Malachi the fourth chapter and the fourth verse and we'll read from there. Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all of Israel with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. He shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with the curse. Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless this word in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And God bless you. You may be seated. I hope that you all enjoyed the meetings this last weekend and and the Lord had dealt with your hearts concerning the things of what it means to be a Christian. Uh we read here in the fourth verse, remember ye the law of Moses, my servant. You know, memory was a great part of the heritage of the Jews as they went forward from Israel, uh, as they went forward from Egypt to Israel, the land, what we call the promised land. And God even told him on that Exodus, he said, "We we want you to remember. We want you to mark this day. We want you put the blood on the post and we want you to eat the Passover." And then he said, "We want you to keep that Passover and eat that Passover and celebrate this day uh that it doesn't leave your memory. &gt;&gt; Tell your children's children." and tell them of the day. We read of the stones coming across uh uh the Jordan River and putting that st down as a memorial so they wouldn't forget that day. And we find out that when the day of the the day gone by is forgotten, a piece of the foundation is forgotten. They don't remember what it took. Uh we have Memorial Day uh here to honor and and remember uh our our country and the lives that were given and what it took to bring us to where we are. The price that was paid, the people that served, the the effort that it took. Uh we are reminded of World War I and World War II and the Korean War and the people that fought that we could have the freedom that we have. But you know, people have just taken it for granted and they no longer remember. They don't re remember the price that was paid and and a younger generation comes on and they don't have the same values. And in fact, they they don't believe war is necessary and there shouldn't have been a war and it's all terrible. But they forgot the things that paid for them. You know, they forgot the work that it takes. They forget. They're so interested in the future that they don't want to remember the past. They don't want to be linked to any of the values or any of the choices that our fathers have made. And therefore the fathers no longer are important. Our founding fathers are a bunch of old fogies. And George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are are are just men that made mistakes. And the dollar is what it's all about. And values have continued to go downhill. That's the nature of our country is the nature of where we are and what we're about. The respect for our police department have gone down. Defund the police and and the attitude towards them and and uh we don't need policemen, we need social workers. And that's the the way and the trend and that's being lost and the past is being lost and the history is being lost. And so it just came on my heart very very strong tonight for us to play uh the video that we have called deep calleth to the deep and it shows our messenger in a interview and it shows him explaining his ministry and it gives us an opportunity to look at the type of man that he was, his humility, his nature, to look at his meeting and his preaching and to see how he prayed for the sick, how simple it was and what manner that he held himself in. And then maybe Sunday evening we'll play uh the message uh I think it's also uh maybe called deep call to the deep this tape is called the 20th century prophet and then Sunday evening we might uh look at deep cloth too because we found out by the lord dealing with our hearts that the way forward forward is to go back. It's no it's no good to go forward if you're on the wrong road. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Or you have the wrong attitude or you you have the wrong emphasis or or you're leaving something out. So I I hope this evening this is just uh I think is 19 minutes long. I'm not sure. but to bring us back into remembrance the foundation that this message was built on. Those meetings where he discerned the thoughts and hearts of the people when he did miracles and signs and wonders and the nation that he did it in. How that he gave the preeminence to the Lord Jesus. Those are the things that make us what we are. But now we have a new generation that wasn't there. And it's so easy for them to be brought into emotionalism. It's so easy for them to put their eyes and focus on preaching and and uh you know uh the excitement and the uh ma way the gospel is being preached today and but I want you to look at and see that that wasn't how that it was. Amen. A lot of it is things that we've added and and excitement that we've added and and ways our ways that we have brought in &gt;&gt; and how are we going to know our ways from his ways? And I think if we could just take a moment to go back in this tape I he'll pray for the sick. I want you to see how simple it was and what the humility was. I want you to see the nature of how that he preached and how different it is from the way that we have started to preach. And so I I want to go forward and I want to go with God, but I want us to be brought into remembrance of how that he was and his way. So it's just, you know, and that's what he says, remember, don't forget. &gt;&gt; And so I want us to remember how brother Brandham was, not to forget, to look at him, to see him, see his humility, see his nature. and for us to remind us that that's the way that he was. Not the way that he's presented to us today by so many, but at least we've got record. And so let's look at the record and let's associate and recall and remember and let our minds be refreshed of what it really was to have the hearts of the children turned to the fathers. So I hope you enjoy this 19 minutes. I hope it helps you. I hope it helps us all go back and stay humble and catch the humility and catch the simplicity and catch the love that was manifested. So, God bless you as you're going to see the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, and Revelations 10:7 this evening. God bless you. Lord, bless you as you watch this to see me. I Should we turn off the lights? Would it make it easier? Uh, we'll turn some lights down. May I present my wife? Honey, this is brother Leroy and Paul Cop of Los Angeles, California. &gt;&gt; Delighted to have you in our home, Brother Cop. Brother Brandham, in your two great campaigns at Los Angeles, at Calvary Temple, we noticed that the Lord Jesus Christ worked with you in a very special manner with these marvelous gifts, these earning of the spirits of men's hearts, as well as the sicknesses of their body and the signs of healing and miracles that were wrought. We thought it was wonderful. &gt;&gt; We interested, Brother Brandham, in hearing more about this unique minister that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Very well, brother Cop. Let's go back to the beginning. I was born in eastern Kentucky in a little log cabin near Burksville, Kentucky. The morning of my birth, I'm told of my parents that there was a light came into the room and hung over me. My people was not a religious people. They did not go to any church. Of course, this caused quite a stir among them. It's followed me all the days of my life. Recently, they took a picture of it in the scientific world as shown here. You're probably familiar with this picture. It was proven by science that it was the only supernatural being that was ever scientifically photographed. To my opinion, it's the same angel of God that followed the children of Israel from Egypt unto Palestine. You know, as a scholar yourself, that was the angel of the covenant, none other than our Lord Jesus Christ. And when here on earth, manifested in flesh, he did not claim to be a great person. He said the son can do nothing just as the father shows him. He in St. John the 5th chapter perhaps you're acquainted with it the scripture Jesus passed through this famous pool of Bethesda. He find many crippled people there blind halt lame waiting for the moving of the waters. It was strange that he just ministered to one. But if you'll notice, he knew where that person was. The father had showed him. He healed this one. Perhaps he he wasn't crippled. He was just laying on a pallet. But Jesus healed him. And then further in the chapter, we find about the 19th verse that he was questioned by the Jews. Perhaps it would be questionable today why God would pass through a place where all those people were lame and halt and blind and would not heal them all. But here I'll quote his words. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do, this doeth the Son likewise." than according to his own word. His ministry was based upon visions from his father. Would not be strange then that his ministry should be carried on as he promised his disciples. The things that I do shall you do also. Greater than this shall you do, for I go unto my father. He said, "A little while and the world seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I believe it's a confirmation in this last days of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among his people, performing the same signs and wonders that he did when he was here on earth. At the age of seven, we moved from Kentucky to Indiana, up the road a bit from where we live now. We packed our water then from a well, some city block I suppose, behind the old country home. One beautiful September afternoon, while coming from the pump with some water, it was a stately popper tree stood about halfway between the pump and the home. Passing by there, there was a whirl of wind in the tree. What we call here a whirlwind. Why, it was nothing odd for that time of year in this part of the country, but it remained in the tree. It didn't leave. I stopped to see what it was, and a voice spoke from it, saying, "Do not ever smoke or drink or defile your body in any way, for there will be a work for you to do when you get older." Frightened, that's not a word for it. I ran home quickly, telling my mother that a man spoke to me out of a tree. Well, she thought I was nervous. She put me to bed. But from then on, visions begin to come. And when this comes up on me, it produces a vision. I'm able to tell people what's wrong with them and what they must do in life and the sins that they are holding back in their life. At the age of 37, one night, I was praying in my room. And when I raised up, I noticed there was a light on the floor and looking around to see where it come from. It was coming from above. The pillar of fire was hanging just above was throwing the light on the floor. I heard someone walking. I looked coming through the room. Coming into this light came a man and human figure. He had be about 200 lb of weight. He had dark hair to his shoulder and olive complexion. Is barefooted. Of course, I was frightened. And he said to me, "Fear not." And as soon as I heard that voice, I knew it was the same voice that had always spoke to me. But the first time I'd ever seen him in human form, he said, "I am sent from the presence of God to tell you that you're to pray for sick people. Great signs and wonders will be following your ministry, and you'll be praying for kings and monarchs and so forth." Well, I told him I was a poor man. I had no education. I would not be able to do this job. He said as Moses was given two signs of confirmation of his ministry that I would be given two signs. One would be the praying for the sick the miracles and the other would be you know the very secrets of the people's heart. I told him that I had been praying about this that the people told me that it was of the devil the ministry. He referred to me many scriptures such as when Philillip found Nathaniel and Nathaniel came to Jesus, what Jesus told him where he had been, where he was under the tree when Nathaniel found him. And many other scriptures such as the woman at the well, how that she was revealed her sins to her. When Jesus told her that she had five husbands, she ran into the city and said, "This is the Christ." many other scriptures he referred to. I told him I would go. He gave me the assurance that he would be with me always. As you know, brother Cop, and the world knows of the great things that's been taking place in the ministry. We were thinking about whether these visions I would remember them very long. Some time ago, I had one about four years ago to be exact of a little boy being dead on the side of the road, struck by a car and killed. and he was to be raised from the dead. Well, I told everybody about it. Prophesied throughout the United States and Canada. Thousands of Bibles had it written on their fly leaf that this would take place. One day while we were having campaigns in the Scandinavian country, we were coming down through Finland from Kovio and there was a group of people gathered on the side of the road. They were hovered over some sort of a farm. We got out to look. There it was, the little boy. Everything has seen just the way it was shown to me. I said to brother Moore, "Look at your Bible and see if this isn't the scene." "Yes," he said. I knelt down and asked our Lord Jesus to confirm his word that he had showed me and had told me would come to pass. The little boy was brought to life again by our Lord Jesus. He's alive and healthy today. Brother Cop, this is just a few of the things that our Lord Jesus is doing today in the ministry that he has committed to me. To my humble opinion is to confirm his word, the things that he promised that would happen in this day we are seeing them take place today. Now, concerning the campaigns in Israel, Brother Cop, I'll be very happy to serve our Lord in Israel. I believe that my ministry will be very effective to the Jews because as the scripture says, the Jews seek signs, the Greeks wisdom. We believe many Jews and others there in the Holy Land will come to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Messiah when they see a Christian fulfilling the prophecy of Joel in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Cop, I'm sure that you're referring to Joel's prophecy in the Old Testament, Joel 2:28. how that he prophesied, saying that in the last days he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh, the sons and daughters would prophesy. The old man would dream dreams, and the young men would see visions. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I guess we'll have to say goodbye for this time. It certainly has been a great pleasure and very edifying. We'll have to be running along, but we will see you, God willing, in Chicago in the next couple of days. Well, gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to have you in our home tonight. We'll be praying together for the success of the Chicago meeting. And by God's grace, I hope to meet you there in the next few days. &gt;&gt; Would you care for some tea before going? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you very much, Mr. B. That'll be just fine. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks, honey. Now to you who believe, the angel of God who has been sent to me to help you to believe Jesus Christ is not two foot from where I'm standing right now. If you believe me to be his servant, you shall take my word. I can't make you believe it. You only have to believe it. He's here now at the platform. Now the Lord bless you while I talk to the woman. Everyone be in prayer. These are sick people. Now if this lady says that she is a stranger to me. I never seen her in my life. No way at all of knowing her any way at all. Now I could not heal her no more than I could save her. And you know I couldn't do that. But Jesus Christ has already did all of that when he died at Calvary. But he sent gifts into his church. Is that right? Say amen. &gt;&gt; And the gifts are to what? edify the church. Is that right? In other words, they see believers, unbelievers, come in and say, "Truly, the Bible said, "If you all speak with tongues and there come in the unbelievers, well, they'll say you're mad. But if there be one prophesy and reveal the secrets of the heart, then won't that unbeliever fall down and say, "Truly, God is with you." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. All right. You believe now with all your heart that Jesus Christ, the son of God, is here now to perform and to do the things that he promised he would do. Lady, I just want to talk to you as and the the reason I'm doing this is to contact your spirit. &gt;&gt; Will you believe with all your heart? &gt;&gt; And if God will just reveal to me what is wrong with you, will you accept him as your healer? You would. Now, we are strangers, I suppose. Are we never seen each other in life? Nowhere. But God knows what's wrong with you. Isn't that right? You're one of your greatest saints. You're an evil also. Isn't that right? You believe that God will make you well, Lord Jesus. I pray that you'll heal the woman. Make her well. Father, may she go from here tonight and be made completely whole. In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it. Amen. Now go read rejoicing pray. Now that's according to your faith sister. See he never told me one thing. Just said what was wrong with you. Watch what he says. See what he tells you that you do. Now that's totally up to you. See you believe it. He said you'd accept it. Now he talk at your word. You take him at his word. Go testify the same. You'll get what? Amen. Let's say thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trust that God is blessing you all out there now to where you can't disbelieve any longer. It would be a a a sin for you to disbelieve now after God had sent his son and has performed this thing that he speaks of now and has done all these signs and you have sent his Bible, sent his preachers, sent his gifts and you still disbelieving, there's nothing left for you but to be condemned at the end. Is that right? But the only thing this is to do is to glorify God and to reveal Jesus Christ. That when he was here on earth, he did this very same thing. All Bible readers believe that, say, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "When I go away and I'll come again a little while, and the world will see me no more." That's the unbelievers. But ye shall see me, who? The believers. For I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Then it's sin to disbelieve. Go ye and sin no more or disbelieve no more or worse thing than this will come upon you, said Jesus. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Then we must believe. It's got to be a belief or perish. If I was God, if they couldn't take my word for it, that would settle it. But people still don't take the word, then signs and wonders are added into the church as Jesus Christ promised to do. And to my honest belief, I believe he's finishing up right now with the Gentiles and we'll turn to the Jews right away. And the Gentiles will be left in their dogmas and the things that they got, their creeds and cold formal denominations, and the church will be raptured and tuck up and the gospel will go to the Jews. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen means so be it. All right. Excuse me, sister. Have to relax my mind once in a while. Now, we are these strangers. I see that you are strictly a stranger to me. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're from away from here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You come from another city. Yes, sir. You've got a lot of trouble on your heart. You got hard trouble to begin with. Is that right? There's a whole lot of blackness. I see a black sheet keep following you like that. Oh, it's a lie. Somebody stole a lie on you. And that was a man was professing divine healing. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said you was a witch. Is that true? And you got a holster in your church or something about it. Isn't that right? Your pastor's sick right now. You got polio. Is that right, sister? Don't pay no attention to what them people tell you. They're a lion. And the only thing's wrong with your heart's that nervous condition got your heart worked up. Go on home in peace. And God bless you. You're all right. God bless you. You're not all right. You believe with all your heart, believe God will heal you that even leave you make you well. Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the woman and may she get completely whole. I ask this blessing in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Go on your road rejoicing saying thank you Lord and you'll get well. Come ladies. Almighty God, author of life, give this woman her perfect health in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. Just a minute. Something happened to you. You know that. You're aware of that. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Why? It's all over the building. And every person here can be healed right now if you believe it. You believe this? Have faith in God. Are you one of the ushers, sir? All right, sir. That lady sitting right there got heart trouble. That speckled dress on. Stand up, lady. He just healed. You didn't have that heart trouble. &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart? All right. There sets a lady there with her handkerchief up crying. Just had a lick on the head the other day. She's got a headache. It's calling it. Is that right? Stand up and accept your healing in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. How may the rest of you want to accept your healing? Jesus Christ is right here now to heal you. Do you believe that? All that wants to be healed, stand to your feet right now. Every person in the building who wants to be healed, stand to your feet. &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands like this to God. Almighty God, the author of life, the giver of every good gift, as our spirit is here tonight, I pray that you'll heal every person in this building, thy ear, the Holy Spirit is here. And I now as your servant along with these other servants, curse every disease that's in here. May the Jesus Christ, the son of God, heal every person in here. Satan, leave these people in Jesus Christ's name. Now let the people got their hands up say praise God and glory rejoice. God bless you. I just hope that this little demonstration of the Holy Spirit that you can see the reality of how that it transplant how it happened and how it took place and that you see that the simplicity of God and the way that it was and how that he did things and what that it was supposed to do. It never was his intention for any vain glory to fall upon him or his ministry as he would say it. But that we might see in that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you'll see the mannerism and how that the nature of how that he did things and how that it lifted him up and what it did for him. And in doing so that you could see the person and the personality and the simplicity of God's word and what that it does for those that serve him and that we'll never forget. get that, you know, we sometimes think that things ought to be so fantastic and and you know that the supernatural is some big great thing. But yet that was the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7. And we look for great men to do great things and mighty exploits. And yet the mighty exploits of the Lord were so simple. &gt;&gt; And so I hope that that sets a tone for you in your hearts and that you'll see and you'll see the great things that God did and the simplicity that he did them in and the way that he did them. and we find out that it's so humble and I wanted to bring that back to our memory and to our membrance and so that that the spirit of it, the reality of it and the greatness of it would be so sweet to us and and that The humidility of it was so great and I didn't want us to forget this and that it would be always revalent to us and that we wouldn't forget the way of a true prophet. So I just ask that we did this this evening so that you would be blessed and that you would remember that. And then this Sunday evening, we'll go back and we'll pick up that meeting and those ministry and how that that gift unfolded and how things were done and how simple that they were done and what wonderful order what they were done in. and that we won't forget how this ministry was revealed to us and the simplicity of it and the power of it and it might quicken to us how these things were performed. So once again, we'd like to remind you of the simplicity and the vindication and the simplicity of what God had done in our day. So we played this for you tonight that it would be a blessing and we hope that we'd be brought to your remembrance. So Lord richly bless you and and let us uh remember these things and let's put them on our heart and let's remember the great word of God. So let us go ahead and stand this evening. God bless you and I hope that you enjoyed uh the humility and the fellowship and the nature of the message that was brought forth. Not a lot of big seemingly wildness or or emotional or or everything. It was just what God said and what God does. And I hope that it'll help you understand that it was with humility that God revealed his word. And then, you know, even when we begin to see God do the works that he did, that we'll always remember that Jesus Christ is revealed in the simplicity of the word of God. And you'll begin to see again how wonderful God was and fulfilling his visions and [Music] and that that'll always be our portion. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Brother Billy, he'll come and then he'll lead us in worship and lead us in the things that we've seen. And then this coming week, we will see more of the great simplicity of God's word. So Lord, richly bless you. May you enjoy the simplicity and trust that the big fantastics never did much for God's word. But the humility, the simplicity of God's word, the way of a true prophet and the way that he truly did things and those things will be wonderfully brought before you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, gloriously Jesus. Keep me true. Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Oh, and there a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power. every hour to be true. Sing that again. Oh, and keep me true. Oh Jesus, keep me. Is that your heart desire? Oh, and keep me true. Lord Jesus, keep me true. Oh, and there a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Oh, give me power every hour to [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, please sing. [Music] Oh, and let me be pleased. Sing to you. And everything that I do will be pleasing to you. Oh, praise. Oh, and let everything I pursue will be pleased. [Music] Lord to you. Sing it again tonight. Oh pleasing. Oh, let me be pleasing [Music] to you. Let everything that I do, oh be pleasing to you. [Music] Oh, praise. Oh, let everything I pursue be pleasing Lord to you. [Music] Emmanuel, [Music] holy savior is strong. Oh man, [Music] God with us. Oh, [Music] his name is [Music] Oh, Imagine. [Music] [Music] [Music] All his son will come. Oh, his name is. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen is our example to follow. Amen. We've seen him manifested and the scripture as the disciples will say that which was spoken and that which was in the beginning and said that we have seen light manifested and and we've lay our hands on it and we've seen it come to pass. I believe us in this generation can say the same thing. We've seen those things that were spoken in the Bibles and come to pass and we've laid our eyes on it and we've seen it. We've read it. We know that God is not is the same. He hasn't changed at all. Amen. But Andrew, if you could just come and dismiss us tonight. Amen. That's our heart's desire. [Music] So glad we can be together again. And isn't it wonderful how faithful God is to give us that spiritual food in due season? You know, I remember when I first come into the way and things were difficult, you know, trying to share the message with somebody I love so dear. And I just remember, you know, sometimes we as human beings, we're trying to convey the message to somebody, but I just remember at some point I just said, "You know what, honey?" This is my wife. I said, "Why don't you just look at the video?" And, you know, it was very special because, you know, we see ourselves and we're short many times, but I I thank God that it's been recorded, not just audio, but we can see his mannerisms. We can see his genuiness and his care. And that is a great example of the life. And you know, like I said, though we feel short, but we saw one come to maturity. &gt;&gt; And so we got our eyes set on the prize, the very life of Christ manifested. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to just short change where we're at now because the potential is inside of us. And so when we look at that, we recognize he run his race. But the same God that led him to the full maturity is going to lead you and me. &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy? I'm so grateful. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, how we thank you for the burden of a pastor, Lord, to help us to look back and recognize the pure word life in the seed that had come to expression. Lord, it does something to our hearts. Lord, it pulsates a a faith to know that you're going to do the same for us. Lord, if we'll just continue to pray and read our Bibles and experience the challenges and the trials, knowing that, oh God, we'll overcome by promise. Lord, I I look back at the testimonies of the life of your servant, Prophet William Brandom. How you brought him through so much, so many trials, very difficult, Lord. And to come to the place where what he displayed, Lord. It wasn't just an overnight deal, but Father, it was test after test, trial after trial, Lord. And you proved out, oh God, that you keep your word, Lord. encourage your children tonight, Lord, with this reality, Lord, that not only are you a promise giver, but you're a promise keeper, Lord. Lord, as we rejoice in what we've seen and heard tonight, Lord, may you go with us, Lord. And may our oh God vision not shrink down because of the world's circumstance and even our current conditions Lord but may there just be a deep settled peace that you'll bring us to that expected end that you promised. We're praying for your believing children tonight as we go Lord pray you'd go with them. Father I'm remembering even now an urgent request God for our brother John and his mother, our sister Diane. Lord, you know the condition and the circumstance, but we're just looking to you, Lord, that those stripes that you bore and the blood that you shed would effectually work on their behalf. Lord, bless their home, Lord. Bless us all together, Lord, that we can be united and unified under this one voice, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you at this place tonight. Oh, let the weak say I am strong. Let the bold say I am brave. Oh, let the blind say I can see. Oh, and what the Lord has done. Oh, and let the we say I am strong. Oh, let the Lord say I am rich. Oh, let the blind say I can. Oh, and what the Lord has done. Ohana [Music] Hosanana to the lamb thou was slain. [Music] Hosanana. Oh Jesus throws into the ware [Music] mercy. Oh, and the savior. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I will rise from into the s of God. Oh, I will sing. Oh Jesus Christ. Hosanana to the singanana [Music] Jesus. Ohana Hosanana to the lamb that was slain.
