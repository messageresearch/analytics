[33:31] that you'd just be drawn closer to him
[33:33] amen I believe that's all of our heart's
[33:35] desires that we'd be close to him and I
[33:38] really think what's lacking in that
[33:41] equation is is he's always near we just
[33:44] fail to recognize him you know we we we
[33:47] say draw me near to him and he's doing
[33:50] everything on his
[33:51] part I want to do my part and I pray
[33:55] it's in a a service like like this we we
[33:58] don't plan to be lengthy try to be very
[34:00] quick and turn it over to uh brother
[34:02] Billy for the the uh communion service
[34:06] but we just maybe want to say something
[34:08] by way of testimony that might encourage
[34:10] you why don't we just go before him Lord
[34:13] we we love you
[34:15] and we're thankful that we have a heart
[34:19] that wants to be close to
[34:22] you there's many that say they want to
[34:25] be close to you but but they just don't
[34:28] want the reproach of sin as we read in
[34:31] Isaiah 4 that they just want to be
[34:33] called by your name but they want to do
[34:35] the things that they want to do and
[34:37] believe what they want to
[34:39] believe but Lord I believe I'm gathered
[34:41] together with the people tonight Lord
[34:43] that we don't want our own thoughts or
[34:46] ideas we don't want our own Ambitions
[34:48] Lord we we want to lay it all down at
[34:50] your feet that you could just draw us
[34:53] closer to you Lord we know that you're
[34:55] willing may we be be more willing Lord
[34:57] to love you and to surrender everything
[34:59] that we would put in front of you Lord
[35:02] we know that you're a perfect gentleman
[35:04] and you always wait for your turn so
[35:06] many times we leave you in the corner
[35:09] with dirty feet and we we ask you
[35:11] forgive us for that Lord
[35:13] that so many times we're selfish and we
[35:18] fail to give you the glory and the honor
[35:19] and the place that you deserve Lord and
[35:22] as we're in your presence tonight may we
[35:26] may we give you that place that rightful
[35:28] place the the first place upon our heart
[35:32] and so we just ask that you'd come Lord
[35:34] Maybe by away a testimony or a few
[35:36] scripture readings or quotes May the
[35:38] people be blessed to be in thy presence
[35:40] we love you pray your blessings upon the
[35:43] communion service Lord we just remember
[35:45] our pastor as you continue to strengthen
[35:48] them we ask these blessings in your name
[35:50] the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have
[35:52] your bibles if you can turn with me to
[35:55] Psalms chapter
[36:03] 23 I had a little conversation with
[36:05] myself in the
[36:08] back I wasn't really feeling up to being
[36:14] here
[36:15] and wasn't really feeling up to saying
[36:18] anything
[36:19] and I saw myself in the mirror and then
[36:22] I got a little inspired I said you're
[36:23] the
[36:25] Rascal
[36:28] so I started to rebuke myself a little
[36:31] bit and I looked at myself in the mirror
[36:33] and you know this just happened about
[36:35] 120 seconds
[36:36] ago I said get behind me
[36:39] Satan so you know we all go through that
[36:42] you know you it's it's easy to to feel a
[36:46] certain way but I'm I'm so thankful that
[36:48] this gospel isn't based on
[36:50] feelings if you reading your Bibles in
[36:53] Psalms chapter
[36:55] 23 very uh special portion of scripture
[36:59] that's become very dear to me in my
[37:01] heart it reads the Lord is my
[37:04] shepherd I shall not
[37:07] want he maketh me to lie down in Green
[37:10] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[37:14] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[37:18] in the paths of righteousness for his
[37:20] name sake yay though I walk through the
[37:23] valley of the shadow of death I will
[37:24] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[37:28] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[37:31] preparest a table before me in the
[37:32] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[37:35] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[37:39] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[37:41] me all the days of my life and I will
[37:44] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[37:47] you may be
[37:49] seated just want to read a
[37:52] quote brother Brandon would say this in
[37:55] who do you say this this is he says and
[37:59] look at the world today what a tension
[38:02] the whole world lives in you go down the
[38:05] street it's not even safe to
[38:10] drive it's not safe to be on a four-lane
[38:14] highway and we got like a 10 Lane
[38:17] Highway everybody's at attention
[38:19] snapping what's the
[38:22] matter quietening down where are you
[38:24] going that's what's making the insane
[38:27] institutions fill up that's what's got
[38:30] the church in such a turmoil they're so
[38:33] headbound on a certain thing they won't
[38:35] stop and consider God's word in the hour
[38:40] that we're living all under a strain and
[38:43] attention and now we know we are aware
[38:45] the Earth has just went through some
[38:47] great birth pains and the church is
[38:49] going through through some birth pains
[38:52] had to go through birth pains before it
[38:54] could give each one of the prophets when
[38:56] they come into the world it was a birth
[38:57] pain to the church the world has went
[39:00] through a first world war a second world
[39:02] war and now it's ready for a third world
[39:05] war and it's in birth pains again but
[39:09] there's only one thing that can bring
[39:11] peace and that's
[39:13] Christ we certainly know that brother
[39:16] brandham is is speaking of the condition
[39:18] of the age in the
[39:19] church this is the same formula for the
[39:23] individual there's only one thing that
[39:25] can bring peace in your life and that
[39:26] would be Christ all of our schemes and
[39:29] our ideas and our ecclesiastical
[39:32] buildups and all of our politics and all
[39:34] of our science and everything it's been
[39:37] proved that it's
[39:39] nonsense and then we pray that God to
[39:41] help us to
[39:43] intervene come in and do something for
[39:46] us and then when he does I just wonder
[39:50] if we would be able to understand it if
[39:53] we would be able to receive it or even
[39:56] even would we consider it I just had a
[40:01] little thought on my heart and was
[40:03] thinking upon that word intervene you
[40:05] know intervention is the act of
[40:08] interfering with the outcome or course
[40:11] especially of a condition or
[40:13] process as to prevent harm or improving
[40:18] function
[40:20] intervene and you know just in thinking
[40:22] about this service this morning as we
[40:25] would
[40:27] read there in Luke 14 verse 18 you know
[40:31] the great invitation was given and many
[40:34] of them started to making excuses of of
[40:36] why they couldn't be there you know I've
[40:38] boughten some oxen I'm going to get
[40:40] married some had had pledged and given
[40:43] um their word that they would they had
[40:45] to be somewhere and you know I I was
[40:49] just thinking about that you know I
[40:51] remember one time I heard a brother one
[40:54] time he he was going to do something um
[40:58] that was contrary to the word he I think
[41:00] he was maybe moving somewhere or going
[41:02] somewhere and and it just didn't seem
[41:05] like it was quite fitting in with the
[41:08] program of God and and I I remember the
[41:11] rebuttal was was well I gave them my
[41:14] word that I would
[41:16] go well I thought in my heart well why
[41:19] don't you just tell them you
[41:24] lied I mean because God's not a man that
[41:27] he should
[41:29] lie but we make
[41:32] mistakes and and if you have made an
[41:34] oath or vowed something that's contrary
[41:36] to the word of God you can repent for
[41:40] that and ask somebody to forgive you you
[41:43] don't don't feel like you're Duty Bound
[41:45] by Your Word well I I I made a promise
[41:49] that I would break the word of God I I
[41:51] got to keep
[41:53] it you know I thought well I I was kind
[41:56] of baffled by the excuse because when
[41:58] they were confronted with the word like
[42:00] well you know that was their their their
[42:03] their reasoning for us was that but I
[42:05] gave him my word that I would do it and
[42:07] I thought well God said I'd never see
[42:09] the righteous forsaken or begging bread
[42:12] and and God's not a man that he should
[42:14] lie I would just rather say Lord forgive
[42:16] me tell the individual look I I'm sorry
[42:19] you know I I I I told you that I would
[42:21] go there or I would do that but I
[42:23] realize it's contrary to the word of God
[42:25] and I'm I'm going to ask that you
[42:27] forgive me for that I I would rather air
[42:29] on that side than somebody calling me a
[42:31] liar because if somebody calls me a liar
[42:33] I can say you're
[42:34] right I am a liar I'm a no good down
[42:37] dirty rotten Sinner and I just need the
[42:40] blood of Jesus Christ to wash me and
[42:42] cleanse me forgive me for the mistakes
[42:43] and the errors that I've made I don't
[42:45] want to continue down a path and somehow
[42:47] think that my justification is because I
[42:50] gave my word but you know just thinking
[42:52] about all these people they they made
[42:55] excuses about why they would not uh uh
[42:59] go to the great invitation and and just
[43:01] thinking about the long uh a the lines
[43:05] of of excuses I thought you know I don't
[43:07] have a thought
[43:09] coming I only got one excuse that's
[43:12] valid and that's the word of God the
[43:14] word of God is my excuse I have no other
[43:16] hope I have no other plea i h you know
[43:19] how do I know God loves me he loves me
[43:21] because he said he loves
[43:23] me you know it's it's
[43:26] I couldn't even we could maybe come up
[43:28] with an a million excuses of of of why
[43:32] uh we should we shouldn't be here why we
[43:35] shouldn't be the you know the bride and
[43:37] why we're not quite fit for this but you
[43:40] know uh the reason I'm standing here is
[43:42] because God intervened in my
[43:46] life and and I'm going to try to move
[43:48] towards a a thought here just maybe to
[43:51] give to you before we go into the
[43:53] communion of what is your excuse
[43:57] divine
[43:59] intervention we want to maybe try to
[44:00] come from the other side on something
[44:02] brother brandom says that speaking about
[44:06] brother Brandon about brother uh about
[44:08] Moses when he called him he said and God
[44:10] called him to be his prophet and sent
[44:11] him down there nothing in his hand but a
[44:14] Crooked Stick To Face an
[44:17] army mechanized units that conquered the
[44:20] whole world but with that stick in his
[44:22] hand as God told him to hold that stick
[44:24] in his hand that he would Israel and he
[44:27] went down and did it because God
[44:29] promised it how is he going to do it I
[44:32] will be with you he said show me your
[44:35] glory Lord I'm slow of speech I can't
[44:38] talk right and I he had a million
[44:42] excuses but he said I'll be with you and
[44:46] that's all it took amen that's all it
[44:51] took well you know just take the word to
[44:54] the present hour that we we live in you
[44:57] know the promise that God has given you
[44:59] is no more crazy than what he told Moses
[45:02] to
[45:03] do I mean God told an old man to take a
[45:07] stick and walk down before the most
[45:10] Mighty Army the world had on the face of
[45:13] the planet to deliver his children out
[45:15] of that was
[45:16] Insanity there was no ability that Moses
[45:19] had to produce it he had actually
[45:21] already tried it when he would have been
[45:24] at the height of his ability to do
[45:26] if there was ever a time that Moses
[45:29] would have been able to deliver the
[45:31] children of Israel it was when he was in
[45:33] the palace it was when he had his
[45:35] strength it was when maybe he had he had
[45:37] the proper relationships and and he had
[45:40] maybe some of the guards and the army
[45:42] that were at his command and maybe he
[45:44] could have deceived and he could have
[45:46] manipulated and he could have worked his
[45:48] way in and he could have knocked off
[45:50] pharaoh and he could have gathered the
[45:51] Army and he could have rode in there but
[45:53] all of that would have done is give the
[45:55] glory to a
[45:59] man but when he tried on his own he
[46:01] failed and found himself out there in
[46:04] the wilderness and when he finally came
[46:06] to the place of of of of grasping of
[46:09] what his call really was and to accept
[46:12] the challenge that God had placed before
[46:14] me he had all of his excuses that I I
[46:17] have no ability to bring this to pass I
[46:19] can't even talk right well you know you
[46:22] we can't even talk right but yet the
[46:25] problem have said that that the that you
[46:28] have the mind of Christ that the word is
[46:31] in the bride and you have thus sayith
[46:33] the Lord you know you know what he wants
[46:35] done with the word well we immediately
[46:37] want to start making
[46:40] excuses well but I but I but I we all
[46:44] have a million excuses but I'll be with
[46:48] you just as Mary when she was given that
[46:52] great
[46:53] promise she said how how can this
[46:57] be once again The Impossible right the
[47:00] the no ability what do you mean I'm
[47:02] going to bring forth the Christ I'm
[47:04] going to bring forth the Messiah even
[47:06] seing that I've known no man how could
[47:08] this ever come to pass well the Holy
[47:11] Ghost is going to overshadow you that is
[47:14] how you are bringing forth every promise
[47:16] of God that has been made to you in this
[47:18] hour because the Holy Ghost has been
[47:21] overshadowing your life to bring forth
[47:23] every single promise that God has made
[47:26] to you he said I will be with you he
[47:28] said show me your glory Lord I'm slow of
[47:30] speech I can't talk right had a million
[47:32] excuses but he said I'll be with you and
[47:34] that's all it took he went taking God's
[47:37] word no matter how dangerous the task
[47:39] seemed Moses continued to believe God
[47:42] and God proved his word through Moses to
[47:44] be the truth because regardless of what
[47:46] took place Moses stayed right with the
[47:51] word so what is your
[47:54] excuse
[47:57] we many times look at that on the
[48:00] negative but I want to kind of look at
[48:02] it from the positive for a little
[48:04] bit what is your excuse divine
[48:08] intervention as we were just reflecting
[48:10] back on the morning service how there
[48:14] were many that made excuses not to
[48:17] go uh maybe they had made a purchase or
[48:21] they had a wedding or something but I I
[48:23] I I thought what about the other side
[48:27] because there are people that
[48:30] went there are other people who had
[48:32] similar
[48:34] obligations and no doubt all of these
[48:36] people who you said you would be there
[48:40] you said you would do this they had to
[48:41] give an account or give an answer also
[48:44] of why they were accepting this
[48:45] invitation it goes both
[48:47] ways if you think about it like that you
[48:51] were GNA be in one place or the other
[48:52] here you you had a Divine in invitation
[48:55] the to a wedding supper and you had to
[48:57] decline the invitation and accept to go
[49:00] on with the natural course that was set
[49:02] before you or there were some people
[49:03] that had the natural course set before
[49:05] them and they realize you know what I'm
[49:07] going to esteem this invitation more
[49:09] valuable I I'm going to realize that
[49:12] regardless of what was set before me it
[49:14] might be your college career it might be
[49:16] somebody that you're interested in there
[49:18] might be these obligations and things
[49:20] that set before you but all of a sudden
[49:22] something's calling from Another Side
[49:24] and you realize you know what I want to
[49:25] I want to esteem that greater than
[49:27] everything else that's been laid out
[49:29] before me and when people would ask you
[49:31] and say why did you give up your college
[49:33] career why did you give up your
[49:34] scholarship to play basketball why why
[49:37] did you uh not follow through with the
[49:39] these things and and your what would
[49:41] your excuse be I want to say your excuse
[49:43] would be divine
[49:45] intervention
[49:46] Hallelujah something got a hold of your
[49:48] life and changed the course you were
[49:51] going One Direction your life was
[49:54] heading One Direction
[49:56] you were going One Direction but all of
[49:58] a sudden Hallelujah divine intervention
[50:00] got a hold of your life and it changed
[50:02] the
[50:08] outcome you know excuse is something
[50:10] offered as
[50:12] justification so once again we're trying
[50:14] to swing this around on the on the
[50:17] positive it's the reason why you can or
[50:20] can't do something you know and as I
[50:23] reflected on that I I just that's what I
[50:25] about brother Adrian's testimony how the
[50:28] the odds were stacked against him you
[50:30] know he had he he he works for a
[50:32] corporation and and and they they' made
[50:34] a a position for him out there in
[50:36] Chicago and a and they asked him you
[50:39] know we'd like to have you there will
[50:40] you go and you know he felt with things
[50:42] that were happening in circumstances he
[50:44] thought maybe this was the opportunity
[50:46] that God was opening up that would be
[50:48] maybe an answer to the season of life he
[50:50] was in and he he told him yes I'll go I
[50:53] I'll go to that job and and there that
[50:56] the the company spent money and then
[50:58] they they had uh spent the resources and
[51:01] allocated funds and they had made a
[51:02] position for him and they had got all
[51:04] things ready and it was getting down to
[51:06] the very uh uh week I I believe uh once
[51:10] some brothers we went away and had some
[51:11] fellowship on a weekend though that next
[51:13] week he was getting back I believe he
[51:14] was supposed to supposed to
[51:19] move and if you if you I love his
[51:21] testimony because he he was what what
[51:24] what he was about to do he was thinking
[51:27] you know Lord I you gave me this job and
[51:29] if this is if this is the way I'm I'm
[51:31] I'm supposed to go and but he but deep
[51:34] in his heart he still had a
[51:36] question that there was something in his
[51:39] heart that he he just wasn't quite
[51:42] settled and and and and I love it
[51:44] because his testimony is is that you
[51:47] know you know God came to him and asked
[51:49] him what is your heart's
[51:52] desire and he answered that uh that the
[51:55] my heart's desires to be in Fellowship
[51:58] here with my brothers and sisters and
[52:00] the Lord spoke to him said thus sayith
[52:03] the Lord according to the desire of your
[52:04] heart that's according to the word you
[52:06] shall have what you've asked for and it
[52:08] was divine intervention because if it
[52:11] wasn't for God intervening our brother
[52:13] would be would have
[52:14] moved but but I I'm I'm trying to move a
[52:17] little further than that because because
[52:20] now he was in a place he had to give an
[52:23] answer if I could say it like this he he
[52:26] had now accepted the invitation the
[52:28] invitation was as you can have the
[52:30] desire of your heart if you want the
[52:33] desire of your heart that's according to
[52:34] the word you can have it and the brother
[52:37] stood there said that's what I want and
[52:38] the Lord said you can have it now he had
[52:41] to give an
[52:44] answer and if I could say it like this
[52:47] now he has to answer back to the
[52:48] corporation and they're going to ask him
[52:50] what is your
[52:54] excuse and if I could put it in these
[52:56] words his answer would be divine
[53:00] intervention what is your excuse divine
[53:03] intervention I realize that I I I will
[53:05] be happy over there it's not it's not
[53:08] according to God's desire and the things
[53:11] for my life what changed all because God
[53:13] intervened on my behalf what is your
[53:16] excuse divine
[53:22] intervention an excuse is an offering or
[53:25] something that you would
[53:27] offer for justification I want to say
[53:30] his excuse was the
[53:33] word come
[53:37] on his excuse was I've received an
[53:40] invitation that I can have the desire of
[53:42] my heart to be in fellowship with my
[53:45] brothers and sisters to continue in the
[53:47] work that God called me
[53:52] to I believe that should be all of our
[53:54] excuses
[53:57] maybe your family wants to ask you why
[53:59] you don't do something or why you don't
[54:00] live away certain way what's your excuse
[54:04] the word of God why can't you go to the
[54:07] company function why can't you go to the
[54:09] company party how many times have you
[54:11] work for a corporation you work for a
[54:12] company they want you to come to the
[54:14] Christmas
[54:16] party well it might be all it'd be all
[54:19] right to go probably for 15
[54:22] minutes and then it's time to go
[54:28] come on there's reasons you don't go to
[54:30] you know uh I I have a a good friend I'm
[54:33] I'm I'm I'm I'm
[54:35] believing for him that that he
[54:38] would that he'll be born again and come
[54:40] into the fold but just to show the
[54:43] respect he he had for me he he he told
[54:46] me later he goes Matthew I wanted to ask
[54:49] you to be my best
[54:51] man but I I just I didn't I did didn't
[54:55] want to force you with having to make
[54:58] that decision and I told him I
[55:00] appreciate you because I know you would
[55:02] have tried to compromise for me I mean
[55:05] they're going to be worldly and he knows
[55:06] that if I come he has at least the the
[55:09] common decent respect for me to to not
[55:11] curse around me or not to smoke around
[55:13] me and if if I whenever may we we see
[55:15] each other or talk to each other if he
[55:17] ever makes a slip he apologizes that's a
[55:19] good friend you know what I'm saying I I
[55:21] apologize and and they're and they're
[55:23] recognizing but look if if if I go onto
[55:25] their turf or I go onto their grounds
[55:28] you know you ought to offer the same
[55:30] respect to
[55:32] them you know don't don't don't go over
[55:34] onto their grounds and be like man why
[55:36] why you know it goes both ways but I
[55:39] respected that but I I realiz I could I
[55:41] can't go to that event I can't go do
[55:42] those things people people know that and
[55:45] and for you you ought to have an excuse
[55:47] that says you know what I I appreciate
[55:48] you invite me to your wedding I
[55:49] appreciate that you invited me to to be
[55:51] the best man or be this but look if if
[55:53] if it's not going to bring God Glory
[55:55] then what are we
[55:56] doing you have an
[56:00] excuse what is an excuse it's what you
[56:02] offer for justification and I want to
[56:05] say your only justification is the word
[56:07] of God your only justification is the
[56:10] blood of Jesus Christ that he shed for
[56:12] you you have no other justification
[56:14] outside of the Lamb of God that is your
[56:19] excuse is divine
[56:22] intervention that's what I love about
[56:24] testify or testimonies is because it's
[56:26] the
[56:28] recognition that God intervened on
[56:30] somebody's
[56:32] behalf that's what you like to hear
[56:34] about somebody giving their
[56:37] testimony and if you maybe you're a
[56:39] young person and you you don't feel like
[56:41] you have a testimony why don't you get a
[56:43] get get in the presence of God and ask
[56:45] God to clarify that for you or or or to
[56:48] help you to understand what your
[56:49] testimony really is maybe maybe your
[56:51] testimony is the very fact that you're
[56:53] still sitting here
[56:56] you your your testimony doesn't have to
[56:58] have the contrast of going out in the
[57:00] world and living in sin that that's no
[57:02] Vindication of a
[57:06] testimony your testimony could be that I
[57:08] grew up on a message Pew and I want to
[57:10] say what a greater
[57:12] testimony that you never had to go out
[57:15] into the world but yet you experienced
[57:17] the grace and love of Jesus Christ and
[57:19] know him in the power of his
[57:20] resurrection I say what a testimony now
[57:23] you didn't have to go out there and have
[57:25] scars and have the contrast so you could
[57:27] be able to say what I was once out there
[57:29] but now I'm this you don't have to have
[57:31] that that's that that doesn't bring uh
[57:33] what brings God glory is when you
[57:35] recognize him and his person and that
[57:37] you're in an individual Union with Jesus
[57:39] Christ and you've recognized that you're
[57:40] a sinner and all have sinned and come
[57:42] short of his glory and that you've
[57:44] become born a new and filled with the
[57:46] Holy Ghost that's a testimony I'm not so
[57:49] much interested in how you get there as
[57:50] long as you get there there ain't no big
[57:53] eyes and little 's there ain't no big
[57:55] sins and little sin we've all
[57:59] sinned and come short of the glory of
[58:04] God
[58:07] intervention just trying to maybe
[58:09] summize this quickly but just thinking
[58:12] of divine intervention I I thought of
[58:14] brother brandom how he was out there on
[58:15] Hurricane Mountain that time and he was
[58:18] confident in his abilities as a hunter
[58:20] as a trap Trapper or as a guide and he
[58:23] got on what they called the Death March
[58:26] he got to walking around in circles and
[58:28] then he come back to the same place he
[58:30] tried to muster up the you know I I I
[58:33] got this I'm you know come on you're not
[58:35] lost I'm a Hunter I'm a guide you're not
[58:37] lost and sure enough he came right back
[58:39] to that same
[58:41] place and then he KN then he knew he was
[58:44] in trouble because he said well I
[58:45] normally would have just you know being
[58:48] being an Outdoorsman of that that
[58:49] caliber he could have crawled under
[58:52] anything and and let it pass over but
[58:54] but he had a wife and a
[58:56] baby down in a cabin in freezing
[58:59] temperatures and he knew beyond a shadow
[59:01] of a doubt that if he left them there in
[59:02] that condition they would die so he
[59:05] didn't have that choice to weather out
[59:07] the storm he had to make it back down
[59:09] that mountain to that cabin and he when
[59:11] he realized all of a sudden he was lost
[59:14] it wasn't so much being lost that he
[59:16] would lose his own life life but he was
[59:18] responsible for his wife and his baby
[59:21] and that was the reality that was
[59:23] setting into to him because now
[59:25] uh he had that responsibility and he he
[59:28] got to that place to where he started to
[59:29] get desperate and started to get urgent
[59:31] and he started to hear that that voice
[59:33] say I I am the Lord and ever presentes
[59:35] help in the time of trouble and to think
[59:37] here the prophet who must have heard his
[59:38] voice a thousand of times would have the
[59:41] Mind battle like I'm just that's just
[59:42] I'm just hearing something and it kept
[59:45] coming a little louder I am the Lord thy
[59:47] God and everpresent help in the time of
[59:49] trouble and once again he's like am I am
[59:51] I losing I'm losing my mind I I need to
[59:53] get this right okay
[59:55] I need to figure this out and it came
[59:58] again I am the Lord and ever presentent
[1:00:00] help in the time of trouble and then it
[1:00:01] struck him he fell on his KN oh God
[1:00:03] forgive your stupid servant I I thought
[1:00:05] I was something I thought I was a
[1:00:07] Trapper I thought I could make my way
[1:00:09] out of this trial I thought I could do
[1:00:11] it but Lord I'm
[1:00:16] lost because on his own
[1:00:19] ability his wife and baby girl baby boy
[1:00:24] were going going to die and I tell you
[1:00:25] that he would have died also trying to
[1:00:27] get
[1:00:29] there but he gathered himself together
[1:00:31] and he thought okay Lord just I'm just
[1:00:33] going to walk by
[1:00:34] faith and he thought you know I'm just
[1:00:36] going to perceive it's this
[1:00:38] way and he started to walk and as he is
[1:00:42] walking all of a sudden
[1:00:45] something a hand come on his shoulder
[1:00:48] and turned them around and all a sudden
[1:00:49] all the clouds and everything
[1:00:51] parted because there was a blizzard set
[1:00:53] and you couldn't see but maybe 3 feet in
[1:00:56] front of your face the clouds parted and
[1:00:58] all a sudden he saw a clear bath and you
[1:00:59] can see that tower that he hung that
[1:01:01] wire on that ran down in the cabin and
[1:01:03] he said I was walking Plum out into
[1:01:06] Canada I was walking a certain death but
[1:01:09] something grabbed my arm and turned me
[1:01:11] around and showed me the way to go what
[1:01:14] was it it was divine intervention did
[1:01:16] that the prophet was surely going to die
[1:01:19] his wife and his baby was surely going
[1:01:20] to die but something intervened oh can't
[1:01:23] you test the
[1:01:25] of the same thing in your life that you
[1:01:27] were going a certain direction you were
[1:01:29] doomed to die in sins and trespasses but
[1:01:32] God intervened on your behalf divine
[1:01:35] intervention changed the outcome oh
[1:01:38] thank God for his grace thank God for
[1:01:41] his
[1:01:44] mercy and then when he
[1:01:47] does I just
[1:01:51] wonder if we would be able to understand
[1:01:56] it if we would be able to receive
[1:01:59] it or even would we consider
[1:02:05] it I try to skip some things here but
[1:02:10] just starting in the
[1:02:12] beginning thinking of Adam and Eve
[1:02:17] and there that decision had been made
[1:02:20] that they must go out of the Garden of
[1:02:23] Eden
[1:02:26] you could see Eve just weeping
[1:02:29] there and Adam starting to walk
[1:02:32] out with
[1:02:34] Eve and her saying how sorry she
[1:02:40] was and Adam just loving her and put his
[1:02:43] arms around her saying it's going to be
[1:02:44] okay it's going to be okay I'm with you
[1:02:47] and the prophet of God would pick that
[1:02:49] up and he would say now I can see them
[1:02:50] standing there and Adam those great
[1:02:52] manly
[1:02:53] shoulders the blood of them sheep skins
[1:02:55] running down his legs I can see Eve
[1:02:57] standing there in her beautiful form and
[1:02:59] all this Blood running over now Adam
[1:03:01] crying and Eve crying mixing with tears
[1:03:03] as it run down their bosom like that Eve
[1:03:06] leaning over on his shoulder and God
[1:03:09] depart out of my
[1:03:11] presence oh he couldn't stand it he went
[1:03:14] but when his children went to walk away
[1:03:18] let's take a little drama here for a
[1:03:19] minute I can hear something going like
[1:03:21] this clap clap clap what is it it's the
[1:03:25] old bloody sheepskins beating against
[1:03:27] Adam's big manly legs as he went walking
[1:03:30] out of the presence of God God couldn't
[1:03:33] stand it all that great eternity there
[1:03:36] come down to four letters l o v e God so
[1:03:42] loved he couldn't see his children go
[1:03:44] out in that kind of condition separating
[1:03:48] from him he stopped and said wait a
[1:03:51] minute I'll put enity between your seed
[1:03:54] and the serpent seed promising a savior
[1:03:58] I want to say what did that divine
[1:04:00] intervention did that the love of God
[1:04:03] intervened on behalf of his children and
[1:04:05] said wait a second I'm not willing to
[1:04:07] send you out in that condition I'm not
[1:04:10] willing to see you depart out of my my
[1:04:12] presence like that but I will promise
[1:04:14] you a savior I'm going to intervene I'm
[1:04:17] going to change the outcome I'm going to
[1:04:20] change the direction that you're going
[1:04:22] I'm going to intervene on your
[1:04:25] half I say how many times Through the
[1:04:29] Ages has God
[1:04:32] intervened how many times through the
[1:04:34] churches and in your
[1:04:36] life what did it take for you to be here
[1:04:44] tonight would you be here if God didn't
[1:04:48] intervene no but the Divine
[1:04:52] architect the one who has it all in his
[1:04:55] hands the one that knows the end from
[1:04:58] the beginning the one that knows his
[1:05:00] thoughts that he's had for you thoughts
[1:05:01] of peace to bring you to an expected
[1:05:04] end he holds it
[1:05:06] all I was just thinking along the lines
[1:05:09] of Abraham and how here Abraham is is
[1:05:14] going to
[1:05:15] sacrifice his
[1:05:18] son now what a what a picture this is is
[1:05:21] that Abraham's taking his his
[1:05:25] very promised son his only son and he
[1:05:27] he's going now to sacrifice could you
[1:05:29] imagine maybe on this journey he's going
[1:05:32] into the land of Mariah uh you know I
[1:05:34] believe uh Mariah means God's choosing
[1:05:38] and and here he God told him look go
[1:05:39] into the land of Mariah to a place to a
[1:05:41] mountain that I've that I'll show you
[1:05:44] and here he goes could you imagine
[1:05:45] somebody asking him Abraham where are
[1:05:47] you
[1:05:48] going well I'm going to sacrifice my
[1:05:51] only
[1:05:53] son I'm going to offer him up as a burnt
[1:05:59] offering you're going to do what why
[1:06:02] would you do that
[1:06:04] Abraham because God told me to do it now
[1:06:07] we know in Hebrews 11 it would it would
[1:06:09] speak of him by faith knowing that the
[1:06:12] same God that gave him could raise him
[1:06:14] up
[1:06:15] again but don't act like that belittle
[1:06:17] the trial I can't
[1:06:20] imagine I can't imag this isn't just
[1:06:22] some fancy story to your thoughts
[1:06:24] thinking there was a man that was called
[1:06:26] and by faith Abraham in obedience to
[1:06:29] God's word was going to offer his only
[1:06:32] son the promised son upon upon the
[1:06:35] mountain on on an altar and he was going
[1:06:37] to take a sharp Rock and and no doubt he
[1:06:39] was going to he was going to cut his
[1:06:41] throat and and he was going to burn his
[1:06:43] only son there on Mount
[1:06:48] Mariah But Here Comes Abraham he's
[1:06:50] coming back maybe passing through the
[1:06:52] same way and here's that individual
[1:06:53] saying
[1:06:54] oh come on
[1:06:56] now you told
[1:06:59] me that you're going to sacrifice that
[1:07:02] young
[1:07:03] lad and Abraham in the Integrity of his
[1:07:06] heart can say yes I was going
[1:07:09] to what do you mean you were going to
[1:07:11] yes I I I I I got Isaac we took all the
[1:07:14] wood up there and I prepared The
[1:07:16] Altar and no doubt if you could
[1:07:20] understand I was trying to hold back my
[1:07:21] emotions as I was weeping there and my
[1:07:24] son was asking me dad I don't understand
[1:07:26] we're we're going to offer a sacrifice
[1:07:28] but where's the lamb and I told my son
[1:07:31] God is able to provide himself a
[1:07:34] lamb and he bounded his son together uh
[1:07:38] he laid his son there on the
[1:07:42] altar in
[1:07:44] obedience to God's word you can imagine
[1:07:47] such a trembling
[1:07:49] heart such a broken heart in that moment
[1:07:53] and something in there maybe you're
[1:07:54] saying God but you said the same God
[1:07:57] that gave him he'll raise him up again
[1:07:59] Lord you told me you would number my
[1:08:00] seed and this is the promise that you
[1:08:02] gave me and and as he was going to come
[1:08:05] down with that sharp
[1:08:07] Rock he was sure to have done
[1:08:11] it but what happened God
[1:08:15] intervened God came on the scene and
[1:08:17] said Abraham stay your
[1:08:21] hand and what did he call that
[1:08:24] Place Jehovah
[1:08:27] Gyra oh he's your provider he's able to
[1:08:30] intervene on your behalf no matter what
[1:08:33] you're going through no matter how hard
[1:08:35] the trial seems God is there to
[1:08:37] intervene oh how we could go through the
[1:08:39] room right now I thought i' to call it
[1:08:40] on names after names after names to
[1:08:43] think of your condition and where you
[1:08:46] were and what that outcome was I thought
[1:08:48] of brother Dari and I sister Alana would
[1:08:50] be back there a widow with her children
[1:08:52] but no God rich and mercy God intervened
[1:08:55] on the
[1:08:58] scene how many of us could testify
[1:09:02] tonight of how God
[1:09:05] intervened oh I wanted to run down
[1:09:08] through the Through the Ages and Through
[1:09:10] the Bible characters I wanted to come up
[1:09:12] to Mount Calvary for God so Lov the
[1:09:15] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:09:18] God
[1:09:22] intervened this world was was doomed
[1:09:26] this world was Shipwrecked this world
[1:09:28] had rejected Malachi 4:5 utter Darkness
[1:09:32] gross Darkness had had come in upon the
[1:09:35] world the only light the world had the
[1:09:37] churches had kicked him
[1:09:42] out but there was a sunset
[1:09:46] Mountain God had a chosen
[1:09:49] Place God intervened on your
[1:09:52] behalf he wasn't willing that you would
[1:09:55] live in that gross Darkness but he gave
[1:09:58] a a promise he said arise and shine thy
[1:10:02] light has
[1:10:04] come that's all God intervening on your
[1:10:08] behalf Prophet would say in a paradox
[1:10:10] how could Abraham take his son way back
[1:10:13] three days journey probably uh n 90
[1:10:16] miles from any
[1:10:17] civilization up on top of a mountain
[1:10:19] where the Lord had showed him go offer
[1:10:22] his own son Isaac
[1:10:25] Isaac packing the wood as we know which
[1:10:26] is a type of Christ and up on the
[1:10:29] mountain he was to offer Isaac a
[1:10:31] sacrifice and when he fulfilled
[1:10:33] everything that God told him but
[1:10:35] stabbing his own son to death through
[1:10:38] his throat when he pulled the knife out
[1:10:40] of that sheath and raised his hand to
[1:10:42] obey God to the word for the Bible said
[1:10:44] that he knew that God could not make a
[1:10:47] promise L he kept
[1:10:50] it and he received him as one from the
[1:10:52] dead that he was able ble to raise him
[1:10:54] up from the dead and give him to him
[1:10:55] again when he was ready to obey God to
[1:10:58] its
[1:10:59] fullness I like
[1:11:01] that he caught his hand and said stay
[1:11:04] your hand Abraham and there was a ram
[1:11:07] hooked in the wilderness around the
[1:11:08] vines with his thorns on top of that
[1:11:10] mountain where there was lions and
[1:11:12] wolves and hyenas and Jackal and great
[1:11:14] ferocious beasts that eat sheep and then
[1:11:17] he was way up on top of the mountain
[1:11:19] where there is no water how did that Ram
[1:11:22] get there
[1:11:24] Abraham had picked up Stones all around
[1:11:26] to build an altar but there was a ram
[1:11:29] anyhow it was a
[1:11:31] paradox and any man that believes God
[1:11:34] and takes him at his word no matter what
[1:11:36] the situation is God will perform
[1:11:38] another Paradox to keep his
[1:11:42] word for Abraham called the place
[1:11:45] Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for
[1:11:48] himself a sacrifice he still can cause a
[1:11:51] paradox to happen he can do it this
[1:11:53] afternoon if you'll just take him at his
[1:11:56] word I wonder if there's somebody here
[1:11:58] that needs a paradox is there somebody
[1:12:00] here that needs a paradox to happen in
[1:12:02] your family to happen in your life to
[1:12:04] happen in your health to happen in your
[1:12:06] situation he still Jehovah Gyra as we
[1:12:08] heard this morning what's seven what
[1:12:10] Redemptive name do you have need of
[1:12:11] tonight why don't you start Believing on
[1:12:13] that Redemptive name call upon the name
[1:12:15] of the Lord you shall receive what you
[1:12:17] have need
[1:12:18] of and I hope I can do this in a a short
[1:12:22] amount of time of what maybe some of the
[1:12:24] inspiration for this was but I was
[1:12:26] having a little fellowship with uh
[1:12:28] brother Andrew and we were just talking
[1:12:31] about some of my recovery I've I've had
[1:12:33] to have a few
[1:12:35] surgeries um uh since uh the the bladder
[1:12:39] cancer was
[1:12:40] removed and just I was fellowshipping
[1:12:44] with him and and it struck me as I was
[1:12:46] talking to brother Andrew I said well
[1:12:48] you know maybe maybe these lingering
[1:12:51] symptoms and these surgeries that I've
[1:12:52] been going through through our our
[1:12:55] reminder to me of what God has
[1:12:58] done that I would
[1:13:01] consider what he did because it's so
[1:13:04] easy to run
[1:13:06] off and not take time to
[1:13:10] consider a as we would read in in Luke
[1:13:12] chapter 10 I believe it is how there was
[1:13:14] 10
[1:13:16] lepers and and they came crying out to
[1:13:19] God and beseeching un them saying Oh
[1:13:21] Lord Would You Deliver Us from this
[1:13:22] condition
[1:13:25] and oh my god he's a god of love he's a
[1:13:28] god of compassion he's a god of Grace
[1:13:32] the that's that's why there's Church
[1:13:34] buildings filled all over the
[1:13:37] world because he's a god of love he's a
[1:13:41] god of Grace he's a god of compassion
[1:13:43] he's not selfish he has a
[1:13:46] law he heals and he provides to people
[1:13:49] who never even give him the time of
[1:13:52] day but maybe just because they
[1:13:55] asked with no intention of living right
[1:13:59] with no intention of change in the way
[1:14:01] they conduct himself but he's a good
[1:14:04] god he's a God full of love and grace
[1:14:07] and compassion and here these 10 lepers
[1:14:10] he said look be be thou cleansed and he
[1:14:13] said now go show yourself to the priest
[1:14:14] and as they were going along their
[1:14:17] way all of a sudden they were
[1:14:21] changed and the scripture say and one of
[1:14:24] them turned
[1:14:26] back with a loud voice and started to
[1:14:30] give glory and honor and praise he took
[1:14:34] time I don't know what happened to the
[1:14:36] other night maybe they were so excited
[1:14:38] they ran to their families maybe they
[1:14:41] they were so excited they ran and got in
[1:14:43] line to show themselves to the priest I
[1:14:44] don't know what happened to the other
[1:14:46] night but one of them recognized the
[1:14:49] source one of them recognized and turned
[1:14:51] and said oh Lord thank you for healing
[1:14:54] me thank you for changing me Lord than
[1:14:57] thank you and he said arise like faith
[1:15:00] has made you whole go on my way I say oh
[1:15:02] God I want my life to be one big loud
[1:15:05] voice of praise to you I want to take
[1:15:08] the time and give the consideration to
[1:15:11] the things that you have done to your
[1:15:13] grace and to your mercy that you've
[1:15:15] performed in my life not only have you
[1:15:17] written my name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:19] Life but you've been so gracious you've
[1:15:21] been so faithful You' you've given me so
[1:15:24] many blessings you've touched my life so
[1:15:26] many times you've done so many things oh
[1:15:28] God forgive me let me take a moment and
[1:15:32] consider what you have
[1:15:37] done thinking on
[1:15:42] that when I was a little
[1:15:46] younger and
[1:15:48] maybe not as
[1:15:51] wise I was driving my truck at a high
[1:15:53] rate of
[1:15:55] speed oddly enough coming back from some
[1:15:57] meetings I believe in Louisiana and um I
[1:16:02] get that truck going you think I drive
[1:16:04] fast now I've done really
[1:16:07] good I uh I was driving pretty quick I
[1:16:10] was with Martin Walman
[1:16:13] and uh you know you get out on those
[1:16:16] highways and you know the the truckers
[1:16:18] all stay on the right but then you know
[1:16:20] they'll get in the other lane to pass
[1:16:23] well you know if you're driving at a
[1:16:25] pretty good clip of speed when they
[1:16:27] start to get over usually you got some
[1:16:29] time to go around them and keep going
[1:16:31] because sometimes depending on how the
[1:16:33] terrain is they can get over in that
[1:16:35] left lane and it's like are you ever
[1:16:37] going to pass that other guy well you
[1:16:40] know I I was a frequent to doing that
[1:16:42] and so I'd got over and I I was cruising
[1:16:46] up and and I'd got there and that little
[1:16:48] window was closing
[1:16:50] down and it was getting a little bit
[1:16:53] narrower and narrower and and I thought
[1:16:55] I'll go ahead and do it and Mar was like
[1:16:56] Matthew don't do it and I kind of I kind
[1:16:59] of uh I I I got a little hesitant I I I
[1:17:02] committed to it and all of a sudden I
[1:17:05] instead of maybe I don't know what I had
[1:17:07] time to do alls I know is I had already
[1:17:09] gotten over and and because I had to
[1:17:11] shoot the Gap faster I had to
[1:17:14] overcorrect to try to stay in a lane and
[1:17:17] I don't know how fast I was going at
[1:17:18] that time maybe 80 90 miles per hour my
[1:17:20] truck started to
[1:17:22] fishtail and it started
[1:17:24] losing this way and then going back that
[1:17:26] way and it went all the way swinging
[1:17:29] back and hit the semi I was beside and
[1:17:32] shot me across this is on I20 shot me
[1:17:36] across the meting I was going so fast
[1:17:37] that if I wouldn't have hit that semi I
[1:17:39] would have no doubt we'd have rolled
[1:17:41] there's no question we'd have rolled
[1:17:43] because I my truck swerved all the way
[1:17:46] sideways and hit that Semite and
[1:17:48] straightened me out and shot me straight
[1:17:50] across the median into the opposite side
[1:17:53] of
[1:17:54] traffic across I20 and the next thing I
[1:17:58] saw there was a bridge with the pillars
[1:18:00] that come down the highway goes like
[1:18:02] this and you know that little concrete
[1:18:03] spot that goes like that with a little
[1:18:05] triangle my truck shot through
[1:18:09] there three more feet up you're getting
[1:18:12] the top of your car chopped off we shot
[1:18:14] through that
[1:18:15] Gap ramped out there into the air and
[1:18:18] all a sudden come down and stuck
[1:18:21] Steel
[1:18:27] I was stuck in the
[1:18:29] mud my truck had a little dent on
[1:18:33] it brother brandom is still
[1:18:42] preaching we could have
[1:18:46] died God had spared my life and spared
[1:18:50] Martin's life because he had other plans
[1:18:53] for our
[1:18:55] life but I thought about it why was I
[1:18:58] stuck in the
[1:18:59] mud because in my
[1:19:03] youth you know alls I had to do because
[1:19:06] I was facing the wrong way when I come
[1:19:07] through there I just had to throw on my
[1:19:11] blinker get back on the highway get the
[1:19:14] next overpass and drive home my truck
[1:19:16] was
[1:19:17] fine but God said no
[1:19:19] son you're going to think about it a
[1:19:21] little bit
[1:19:23] so we had to call a
[1:19:25] wrecker beautiful weather out it was
[1:19:27] fine and I still got the
[1:19:30] receipt from that recer
[1:19:33] service but it would have been so easy
[1:19:36] for
[1:19:37] me to have just threw on the blinker and
[1:19:40] said
[1:19:41] man that was a close one I sure I sure
[1:19:45] was able to maneuver through that little
[1:19:47] Gauntlet there and save
[1:19:49] us no no son if I wouldn't have
[1:19:54] intervened if I hadn't have thoughts for
[1:19:56] you if I hadn't had a plan for your life
[1:19:58] if I hadn't had lined out everything you
[1:20:00] were going one way but but I had to
[1:20:03] intervene on your behalf and so I had to
[1:20:07] take a little time and consider what had
[1:20:09] happened
[1:20:10] there and this brings me back to really
[1:20:13] where I was trying to go and just
[1:20:15] talking about considering what God has
[1:20:19] done is it was it was the year 2019 here
[1:20:23] a few years back and was one of the
[1:20:25] hardest years of my life where we had
[1:20:28] went and performed uh the wedding for my
[1:20:31] cousin charity and not a month later she
[1:20:34] went to be with the Lord and it was that
[1:20:36] same year that my brother Aaron uh moved
[1:20:39] to begin a church in Arizona and so uh
[1:20:43] that was very hard on me and just a lot
[1:20:47] of challenges in that year of
[1:20:49] 2019 and I remember when we found out we
[1:20:52] were going to have a son I going to have
[1:20:54] a baby I felt like it it it spoke of
[1:20:57] Victory I just something in my heart was
[1:20:59] like I need a I need a bright
[1:21:01] spot I I feel like I've been going
[1:21:03] through a lot of Trials and a lot of
[1:21:05] hurt and a lot of pain and and and I
[1:21:07] need some Victory and I just felt like
[1:21:10] you know the news of having a child was
[1:21:12] was that was that was that gift from God
[1:21:15] you know something that would would be a
[1:21:16] victory in my life and and I could tell
[1:21:21] the whole testimony about uh Evan how he
[1:21:24] came forth which was also a challenge in
[1:21:26] itself that's why I call him an
[1:21:27] Ephesians 28 baby because his his name
[1:21:29] really means Ephesians 2:8 for by grace
[1:21:31] are you saved through faith and that out
[1:21:33] of yourselves it is a gift of God but
[1:21:36] but I was just I remember making the
[1:21:38] statement that 2020 was going to be a
[1:21:39] year of Victory I thought hey man if if
[1:21:42] 2019 has been this hard Lord I Need A
[1:21:45] year of
[1:21:46] Victory and so as the year
[1:21:50] 2020 Came Upon Us I was having some
[1:21:52] symptoms and I realized I needed to go
[1:21:55] uh to the
[1:21:59] doctor see they have natural
[1:22:03] intervention I mean think about it
[1:22:05] they're all excited because the cowboy
[1:22:08] scored a
[1:22:09] touchdown and it's all going to
[1:22:13] burn
[1:22:14] right but if they could only have divine
[1:22:18] intervention and they'd realize all that
[1:22:20] screaming and hollering doesn't no good
[1:22:23] it's all going to
[1:22:25] burn that's why we're sitting here
[1:22:27] tonight some of you would have been
[1:22:28] watching it some of you wouldn't be in
[1:22:31] this place tonight you'd be somewhere
[1:22:32] watching a ball game but what happened
[1:22:35] divine intervention when people ask you
[1:22:36] why aren't you watching the Cowboy game
[1:22:38] divine
[1:22:40] intervention you know why why why can't
[1:22:42] you work on Wednesday night divine
[1:22:45] intervention why can't you work on
[1:22:47] Sunday divine intervention why don't you
[1:22:49] care for the things of the world divine
[1:22:51] intervention well when you take some
[1:22:53] time and just start to consider how God
[1:22:56] intervened in your life I think if they
[1:22:58] can get excited about a football game w
[1:23:01] we can get excited about God's divine
[1:23:04] intervention cuz I was going one way I I
[1:23:06] should have died under an underpass but
[1:23:08] God intervened on my
[1:23:11] behalf and so I was just thinking how I
[1:23:13] you know I wanted a year of
[1:23:16] Victory I I I I was just speaking it and
[1:23:19] claiming it and right after Evan was
[1:23:21] born I started some
[1:23:23] symptoms and I felt that I needed to go
[1:23:26] get them checked out
[1:23:28] and I went to the doctor and I remember
[1:23:30] pulling up in front of the doctor just
[1:23:31] to not to be too transparent but I was
[1:23:34] having some some blood in my urine and I
[1:23:36] it would just it was ever so often but I
[1:23:38] realize just you know you you be around
[1:23:40] a little bit you realize there's certain
[1:23:42] things you should ignore I don't care
[1:23:43] how spiritual you think you
[1:23:45] are you know but in my youth God was
[1:23:48] teaching me something because I've
[1:23:49] always you know I've never had insurance
[1:23:51] usually and and and I've always just you
[1:23:54] know you just try to muscle through
[1:23:55] things and and I remember uh thinking
[1:23:58] about some people you know like well
[1:23:59] yeah man if I had this or I had that man
[1:24:01] bless God I'm Healed why would I ever go
[1:24:03] do this and that well you know sometimes
[1:24:05] God gots to take you one way to help
[1:24:07] teach you a few things you think you
[1:24:09] know how you that's that's that's the
[1:24:11] problem with a lot of us is we always
[1:24:12] know how somebody else should handle
[1:24:14] their
[1:24:15] situation never having gone through it
[1:24:17] yourself you think you know how Brother
[1:24:18] David should run the church never having
[1:24:20] been a pastor never had to put up with
[1:24:22] the pressure never had to put up with
[1:24:24] the burden never having to honor what
[1:24:26] God Said over what he feelings and
[1:24:28] knowing that that might hurt an
[1:24:29] individual but because to be faithful to
[1:24:31] what God's told him to do but we got it
[1:24:33] all figured out well what you you walk a
[1:24:36] little what's that saying you walk a
[1:24:38] little bit in somebody's shoes you might
[1:24:39] find out it's completely
[1:24:41] different you might you might think so I
[1:24:43] I I remember sometimes in my youth
[1:24:45] thinking about doctors and things like
[1:24:47] that not never critical of anybody but
[1:24:48] just in myself I thought well if it
[1:24:50] happens to me this is the way I'd handle
[1:24:52] it I never in a a way that would have
[1:24:53] diminished or or thought about somebody
[1:24:55] else but just in my mind maybe how I
[1:24:57] thought I would handle something and and
[1:24:59] I just getting a little bit older you
[1:25:01] know I I just figured hey you know with
[1:25:03] these
[1:25:04] symptoms maybe I had go go to a doctor
[1:25:07] you know forgetting to realize that
[1:25:09] brother brandham said it's your duty to
[1:25:10] go to the
[1:25:13] doctor he says that a handful of times
[1:25:15] it's your duty to go to the
[1:25:17] doctor and so I remember pulling up in
[1:25:19] front of that doctor's office just would
[1:25:21] be just a few more minutes I apologize I
[1:25:22] thought we'd be quicker but I I remember
[1:25:26] um pulling up there in in my
[1:25:29] heart I said
[1:25:33] Lord by your stripes I'm already
[1:25:38] healed and and and and a clear voice
[1:25:41] said back to me yes but it wasn't until
[1:25:44] M was on the operating table that I
[1:25:49] intervened and I I that was profound to
[1:25:53] me I didn't know all what it meant I
[1:25:57] understood the story I understood the
[1:25:58] situation but how that applied to me it
[1:26:01] was God telling me as his son son go
[1:26:04] ahead like here's a Divine Prophet
[1:26:07] taking his wife to the doctors preaches
[1:26:09] Divine Hill he's going to the doctor I
[1:26:11] realize okay I I I'm going to go ahead
[1:26:13] I'm going to go through the process
[1:26:14] because I know God can use uh doctors he
[1:26:17] said you know it's your duty to go to
[1:26:19] the doctor and so it was on uh 220 2020
[1:26:23] it was February 20th 2020 I went in
[1:26:26] there finally got through the certain uh
[1:26:28] doctors to the urologist and Doctor
[1:26:30] Graves great name for a doctor Dr Graves
[1:26:34] is his co- doctor Dr Ash figure that one
[1:26:41] out he took one look up there and he
[1:26:45] said that's
[1:26:46] cancer he said we got to get it out he
[1:26:49] scheduled he scheduled the surgery four
[1:26:50] days later he scheduled the chemo
[1:26:54] treatments and we were set to go and 4
[1:26:56] days later I went in to have this tumor
[1:26:59] removed I remember the doctor came in
[1:27:01] and uh Dr Graves always appreciated that
[1:27:04] he was a Christian he came in before the
[1:27:05] surgery he laid his hands on me he
[1:27:07] prayed for
[1:27:08] me and uh then the anesthesiologist came
[1:27:12] in and uh started that process of the
[1:27:14] anesthesia and I can now having done
[1:27:16] some other surgeries this is all kind of
[1:27:18] goes in helps me understand the
[1:27:20] testimony a little bit better but I was
[1:27:22] talking to a nurse about it you know
[1:27:25] anesthesia you know that that thing's
[1:27:29] undefeated I mean you can I think it's
[1:27:32] it's to me it's I'm actually it's
[1:27:35] amazing to me because it don't matter
[1:27:37] who or
[1:27:39] what they got the tools and the ability
[1:27:42] to put you
[1:27:44] out you you just think you're hanging
[1:27:48] on keep running your
[1:27:51] mouth
[1:27:54] you know hey but but but God allowed
[1:27:56] something on my this first visit there
[1:27:58] because I had tried these other times to
[1:28:00] make it back to the uh surgery room
[1:28:04] because what happened in this first time
[1:28:06] is they gave me the anesthesia and and
[1:28:10] and I got back there and and to make it
[1:28:13] to the operating room table conscious is
[1:28:16] extremely
[1:28:17] rare because the the anesthe you don't
[1:28:20] know this but they're with you and
[1:28:22] they're trying to put you out you ain't
[1:28:25] supposed to be talking to those doctors
[1:28:27] throwing you
[1:28:28] on the surgery table and and now I know
[1:28:32] what a surgery table is it isn't a nice
[1:28:34] little comfy bed with a little pillow
[1:28:37] there and we'll get you all comfy no man
[1:28:40] you're like a science
[1:28:42] project it is a cold sterile piece of
[1:28:46] Steel and they threw me up on top of
[1:28:49] that and and I was talking talking to
[1:28:52] some of the doctors there the doctor's
[1:28:53] assistants and they looked at me and
[1:28:55] said look you ain't supposed to be awake
[1:28:57] back
[1:28:58] here it's rare that anybody ever makes
[1:29:00] it back this far he said it's time for
[1:29:02] you to go to your happy
[1:29:05] place and I and I remember so vividly I
[1:29:09] said my happy place is the word of God
[1:29:12] and I said yay though I walk through the
[1:29:14] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:29:16] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:29:19] rod and thy staff they comfort me that
[1:29:22] preparest a table before me in the
[1:29:24] presence of my
[1:29:31] enemies and I woke
[1:29:35] up I'm in the recovery room it's like
[1:29:38] wait a sec y'all haven't even done
[1:29:42] nothing like nope it's all it's all done
[1:29:45] what do you mean it's all
[1:29:46] done when the lights go
[1:29:49] out they go out
[1:29:53] and and I had I had woke up there in the
[1:29:55] recovery room and we uh just trying to
[1:29:59] wrap up
[1:30:00] quickly but I was there in the recovery
[1:30:03] room
[1:30:04] and uh they actually I guess they call
[1:30:07] it outpatient surgery for whatever
[1:30:09] reason I never know why but they sent me
[1:30:11] home that same day which in my
[1:30:14] circumstance was was was not good
[1:30:16] because we had to go to the emergency
[1:30:18] room we had excessive uh bleeding in the
[1:30:21] bladder and and it created some very big
[1:30:24] uh problems that could have been very
[1:30:25] detrimental even life-threatening if if
[1:30:28] I'd have been a little bit more
[1:30:30] intuitive I have went to the emergency
[1:30:33] room quicker and not made my wife a
[1:30:35] nervous wreck but we got there and they
[1:30:39] did the proper things they needed to do
[1:30:40] to get us stabilized and and the next
[1:30:43] day I remember uh Dr Graves coming into
[1:30:46] the room and I said Dr Graves what's
[1:30:48] going on he goes it's just the devil and
[1:30:51] I said there's the best answer from a
[1:30:53] doctor I have ever
[1:30:55] heard I mean wouldn't it be nice you
[1:30:57] come to the doctor and then you say to
[1:30:59] the doctor hey doctor what's wrong with
[1:31:00] me goes it's just the
[1:31:02] devil and I said that's exactly right
[1:31:04] best diagnosis I've ever heard he said
[1:31:07] hey I want to come check with you it
[1:31:08] seems like you're doing good
[1:31:09] everything's the recovery is now going
[1:31:11] well he said but we got the lab results
[1:31:13] coming in and I want to go down there
[1:31:15] and see the lab results and I'll never
[1:31:17] forget it seemed like he came back with
[1:31:20] with with such meaning when he came back
[1:31:22] in the room it seemed like he was in an
[1:31:24] urgency to come back cuz he came in the
[1:31:26] room he goes I had to come back and tell
[1:31:28] you he said look I've been doing this
[1:31:29] for 40 years and I've never seen this in
[1:31:33] 40 years of practice but we've gotten
[1:31:35] the results on your lab work and it says
[1:31:37] you're cancer
[1:31:38] free it said there there's no cancer
[1:31:41] life in that tumor he's like we don't
[1:31:42] even have to do a a chemotherapy cuz
[1:31:45] there's no C the life of the Cancer's
[1:31:50] gone
[1:31:55] so the surgery would have been on a
[1:31:56] Monday I believe we ended up in uh the
[1:32:00] the emergency room on
[1:32:02] Tuesday we were held over and it was a
[1:32:04] Wednesday night I believe our pastor was
[1:32:06] given a
[1:32:10] report brother Billy if you can just get
[1:32:12] ready to come take take the
[1:32:16] service but I remember it was the
[1:32:18] evening on a Wednesday night our pastor
[1:32:20] was was giv a report on my condition and
[1:32:22] I and I was just streaming in and and I
[1:32:24] remember he said these words he said he
[1:32:26] said when they were doing the surgery on
[1:32:28] Matthew uh he says God took the life out
[1:32:31] of the
[1:32:32] cancer out of the tumor and then that's
[1:32:35] it struck me it it was just as God had
[1:32:40] said he said yes but it wasn't until M
[1:32:43] was on the operating table that
[1:32:46] intervened well you know what's amazing
[1:32:48] about our carnal mind you know I
[1:32:50] struggle I I it was so Supernatural what
[1:32:53] God did on that and I accepted it and I
[1:32:56] believed that but there was this one
[1:32:58] portion of me that just I I I I couldn't
[1:33:01] understand the operating table
[1:33:03] part because ma technically wasn't on an
[1:33:06] operating table she was going in for an
[1:33:08] exam and being so carnally minded I even
[1:33:12] started looking up doctor exam tables to
[1:33:15] see if they did operations on the same
[1:33:17] table or something because God told
[1:33:20] me but here's the here's the thing is
[1:33:22] I'm trying to figure that
[1:33:25] out when why does it even
[1:33:27] matter but God because he loves us so
[1:33:31] much and I wanted an answer I just held
[1:33:35] it close to my heart as a question
[1:33:37] because I I'd given this testimony you
[1:33:39] know around uh going out preaching and
[1:33:41] everything and and and I even had
[1:33:43] considered saying it differently well
[1:33:45] maybe I'll just
[1:33:46] say and I just remember God just telling
[1:33:50] me son it wasn't the doctor that
[1:33:52] performed the
[1:33:55] operation and I just realized
[1:33:58] oh I'm sorry Lord I it wasn't the
[1:34:01] doctor's operating
[1:34:02] table it was God's operating
[1:34:05] table God can use a doctor or God can
[1:34:09] use a
[1:34:11] donkey I don't care how he does it just
[1:34:14] let him do it and when he does
[1:34:17] it I think we ought to take some
[1:34:20] time
[1:34:22] and
[1:34:24] consider what he's
[1:34:27] done has God ever intervened on your
[1:34:35] behalf what does it say back here I just
[1:34:38] want to read that before I turn it
[1:34:43] over he
[1:34:47] says and then when he does I just wonder
[1:34:49] if we would be able to understand it
[1:34:52] why don't we all just stand as we're
[1:34:54] about to read
[1:34:56] anyways I just wonder if we would be
[1:34:58] able to understand it if we would be
[1:35:01] able to receive it or even would we
[1:35:04] consider
[1:35:05] him I just wanted to take an opportunity
[1:35:09] to speak to you and just tell you in my
[1:35:12] heart that I said Lord I I
[1:35:15] recognize that you divinely intervened
[1:35:19] in my life and delivered me
[1:35:22] from what the doctor called
[1:35:24] cancer and he he did such a sovereign
[1:35:27] quick work I feel like maybe what
[1:35:30] happened is I had just kind of moved on
[1:35:32] down the road a little
[1:35:34] bit and didn't give him the proper
[1:35:38] praise take the time to consider
[1:35:41] that that battle could have been much
[1:35:44] different could have been much
[1:35:47] longer I could have suffered a lot
[1:35:50] more but God rich in
[1:35:54] Mercy he intervened on my
[1:35:57] behalf and I want to say that God's
[1:35:59] intervened on your behalf time and time
[1:36:03] again and I just want to encourage you
[1:36:04] let's just take a little time
[1:36:07] tonight as we go to the communion
[1:36:11] table and thank
[1:36:13] him for his
[1:36:16] goodness and for his
[1:36:18] Mercy for his grace and really cons
[1:36:22] the
[1:36:24] blood that was
[1:36:26] shed on your behalf because his divine
[1:36:30] intervention you could be free tonight
[1:36:33] and enjoy his blessings because we're
[1:36:35] his beneficiary God bless
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:56] wonderful amen aren't you thankful for
[1:36:58] God in the things that he does for us
[1:37:01] amen you
[1:37:03] know the scripture says that
[1:37:06] Abraham he considered the greatness of
[1:37:08] the one who made the
[1:37:10] promise it's not that we are somewhat
[1:37:15] deserving of the promise but the
[1:37:18] question is who made the promise he knew
[1:37:21] that God will keep his word and and and
[1:37:24] I like to tell people you know we here
[1:37:28] it's we are here as God's
[1:37:31] testimony
[1:37:33] um the reason why we have time to even
[1:37:37] come to church you know the reason why
[1:37:40] we are here day in and day out it's not
[1:37:42] because we somewhat conquer the world
[1:37:46] and done things and then that way we are
[1:37:49] also set so we can be here here no God
[1:37:52] made a way that we could get gather here
[1:37:55] he he called each and every one of us
[1:37:57] and we we had a desire to serve him he
[1:38:00] he gave you a job that would allow you
[1:38:02] to come to church he made a way so each
[1:38:05] one our testimony is not our own
[1:38:08] strength Our Testimony is that he made a
[1:38:10] way that we could be here and all we can
[1:38:13] do is just testify God I'm so thankful
[1:38:17] oh why do you go to church three times
[1:38:19] because God made a way that I can go
[1:38:20] through three
[1:38:22] times why do you go to church because
[1:38:25] God made a way he saved me out of my
[1:38:27] trouble he saved me out of my sins he
[1:38:30] gave me a way for me to go and worship
[1:38:33] him I'm only here as a testimony I tell
[1:38:35] you that will say we're not different
[1:38:37] from the people out in the
[1:38:39] street the only difference is the grace
[1:38:42] of God has been made known and available
[1:38:44] unto us that's why we praise Him amen if
[1:38:48] the uh we'll read the scriptures in 1
[1:38:50] Corinthians
[1:38:52] was thinking about when brother Matthew
[1:38:54] was talking about the Anastasia I
[1:38:57] remember it's such a you don't know
[1:39:01] whether you're alive or dead you're just
[1:39:03] somewhere you can't dream or or anything
[1:39:06] you're just out and then all of the
[1:39:08] sudden when you wake up everything is
[1:39:10] done
[1:39:11] amen am Man 1 Corinthians 13 we CH
[1:39:14] will'll start uh I'm sorry 1 Corinthians
[1:39:18] 11 we'll start from the 23rd
[1:39:21] it says that for I have received of the
[1:39:23] Lord if the brothers can go get the
[1:39:26] communion ready for I reive of the Lord
[1:39:30] that which I have also delivered unto
[1:39:32] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:39:34] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:39:36] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:39:39] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:39:43] broken for you do in remembrance of me I
[1:39:47] want to say this it's in remembrance of
[1:39:49] his grace his his Mercy his word
[1:39:53] everything we we don't come to the table
[1:39:56] remembering somebody else we remember
[1:39:58] what is done for us so we could be here
[1:40:01] so when we eat it is an action of
[1:40:03] Thanksgiving Lord I'm thankful thank you
[1:40:07] in remembrance of me and after the same
[1:40:09] manner he he took the cup when he had
[1:40:13] stopped saying this cup is the New
[1:40:15] Testament in my blood do do the this do
[1:40:19] ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:40:22] remembrance of me for as often as ye eat
[1:40:24] this bread and drink this cup ye do show
[1:40:27] the Lord's death till I come wherefore
[1:40:31] whatsoever shall eat this bread and
[1:40:34] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:40:37] shall be guilty of the blood of the body
[1:40:39] and blood of the Lord he said but let
[1:40:42] every man examine himself so let him eat
[1:40:45] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[1:40:48] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:40:51] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:40:53] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:40:56] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:40:59] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:41:03] ourselves we would not be judged but
[1:41:06] when we are judged we are chasten of the
[1:41:09] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:41:11] with with the world wherefore my
[1:41:13] brethren when ye come together to eat t
[1:41:17] one for another and if any man hunger

[1:41:24] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:41:27] will I set in order when I come
