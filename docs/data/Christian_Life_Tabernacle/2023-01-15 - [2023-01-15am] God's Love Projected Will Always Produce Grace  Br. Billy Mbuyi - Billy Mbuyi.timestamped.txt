[4:36] Lord we love you we commit the service
[4:38] to you and we look forward to what you
[4:41] have for us we pray in Jesus name amen
[4:47] well Happy New Year
[4:49] I uh
[4:51] I realize I'm a little bit late to the
[4:52] party
[4:53] but uh you know Liz and I were talking
[4:56] the other day about how quickly the
[4:58] years just seemed to fly
[5:00] you know it seems like we're just
[5:01] wrapping up one New Year's Eve service
[5:03] and we're already planning the next
[5:05] and uh
[5:06] you find yourself asking where did the
[5:08] year go
[5:09] and you know the funny thing is is it's
[5:11] exactly the same number of days it's
[5:13] always been
[5:14] it's just hard to explain why but you
[5:17] know one of the things that people do
[5:19] at the turning point of each year
[5:22] is they set resolutions
[5:25] you know they
[5:26] try to use the new year to start
[5:30] restart a work
[5:33] you know they for some reason they use a
[5:36] date
[5:37] January 1st
[5:39] as the day that they're going to measure
[5:41] their progress or
[5:43] their condition and
[5:45] you know make commitments about some
[5:47] changes they're going to make or some
[5:48] new work they're going to perform and
[5:51] you know I guess the question is is why
[5:53] wait to January 1st
[5:55] what's wrong with May 3rd
[5:57] or October 17th they're
[6:00] when the Lord deals with your heart on
[6:02] something
[6:04] you know why our dates even the
[6:07] measurement we should be using
[6:09] and more than anything the new year is a
[6:12] reminder of how much creatures of time
[6:14] we still are
[6:16] you know we're so time-bound
[6:20] we tend to measure things by time
[6:23] you know whether something is successful
[6:26] or a failure
[6:27] we use time
[6:29] to decide that
[6:30] you know whether we use time to measure
[6:34] our progress
[6:36] on a journey or the progress of a work
[6:41] you know it's
[6:43] we tend to have our focus and our
[6:45] perspective change
[6:47] based on time
[6:51] you know and time is even our bodies are
[6:53] subject to they get tired they get worn
[6:56] out and they need rest because of time
[7:00] you know but if we're not careful
[7:04] we can measure God
[7:07] by time
[7:09] we can measure the effectiveness of his
[7:11] word
[7:12] by time
[7:15] or we can measure the progress that he's
[7:18] making by time
[7:20] but he's not a creature of time
[7:23] you know time is not the measurement he
[7:26] uses he uses his word
[7:29] his word is his measuring stick
[7:34] you know and we're not careful we can be
[7:36] tempted because of time
[7:39] to
[7:40] you know try to perform a work or change
[7:44] something or
[7:45] make a a change in a direction because
[7:48] we perceive
[7:50] that somehow time has an effect on the
[7:53] word
[7:56] you know the number of times the thing
[7:58] is is when God's word Goes Forth
[8:01] it begins to trigger everything to start
[8:03] to come in line with that word
[8:06] and the date on the calendar has nothing
[8:08] to do with it no matter how many times
[8:10] that calendar turns over
[8:15] you know during The Exodus
[8:17] when God was bringing forth his people
[8:20] out of that land of Egypt where they
[8:22] were and beginning to set them on that
[8:25] work to reposition them
[8:27] into their origin their land of origin
[8:30] he made an interesting statements to
[8:32] them in Exodus 11 2.
[8:34] as he's getting the people ready
[8:37] he says this month shall be unto you the
[8:39] beginning of months
[8:41] it shall be the first month of the year
[8:44] to you
[8:46] no matter what day it was in Egypt
[8:50] no matter what their calendar said
[8:53] no matter what timeline they were using
[8:55] for the people of God
[8:57] they were now in a new timeline
[9:00] they were now governed by a new calendar
[9:03] whatever date it was in Egypt no longer
[9:05] mattered
[9:06] they were now governed instead of by the
[9:08] calendar of Egypt they were now governed
[9:10] by the timeline of the word
[9:14] you know progress for them was now based
[9:16] on thus saith the Lord
[9:19] you know God's people don't measure
[9:22] progress by time
[9:24] they measure it by his word
[9:28] you know their focus instead is on what
[9:31] he has done
[9:32] and what he has said he would do
[9:37] the change of the calendar has no
[9:38] bearing on that
[9:41] you know we're going to read a portion
[9:42] of Psalm 105 this morning
[9:45] Psalm 105 is a
[9:48] it was a Psalm of remembrance that David
[9:51] wrote
[9:52] when the Ark of the Covenant
[9:54] was returned to its rightful position
[9:58] Psalm 105 1-15 is the same as first
[10:03] Chronicles
[10:04] 16 8-22
[10:07] word for word
[10:10] here you have the ark
[10:13] that which contained the word of God
[10:16] that which contained Resurrection Life
[10:20] that which contained the bread from
[10:22] heaven
[10:24] you know where the presence of the Lord
[10:26] could be found
[10:28] where
[10:30] you know is the place where
[10:32] God's people could inquire of the Lord
[10:34] and
[10:36] seek his leadership and rather than that
[10:38] presence being in their midst
[10:40] in the center
[10:42] of worship where it belonged it was out
[10:45] off in some Corner Fringe somewhere in
[10:48] some little house
[10:50] way off on the edge of the land and for
[10:53] so long it had not been the center
[10:55] of their lives and then here
[10:58] you know David comes to the throne and
[11:00] there begins to be this hour of
[11:02] restoration where the presence of the
[11:04] Lord is restored back in the camp
[11:06] it's brought in once again into a
[11:08] tabernacle
[11:09] of skin
[11:11] and it's set up and
[11:13] you know you can read in first
[11:15] chronicles 16 how everything was put in
[11:18] place according to the word
[11:20] where all the qualifications were met
[11:23] all the sacrifices and offerings were
[11:25] accepted
[11:28] preparation had been made
[11:31] and then it says in first chronicles 16
[11:33] 3 it says and he dealt to every one of
[11:36] Israel
[11:37] both man and woman to everyone a loaf of
[11:40] bread
[11:42] a good piece of fish
[11:44] and a flagon of wine
[11:48] so every person now was standing there
[11:51] in the presence of the Lord and in their
[11:52] own hand
[11:54] was their portion
[11:57] of that
[11:58] Word of Life
[12:01] all preparation had been made and it was
[12:04] here with the people in that position
[12:06] the children of God
[12:08] with all the sacrifices accepted the
[12:11] presence of the Lord restored in the
[12:12] camp them holding in their hand their
[12:15] portion
[12:17] it was then that David
[12:19] presents this psalm
[12:22] of resolution for the people
[12:25] you know those in Egypt might be setting
[12:27] up resolutions for new behaviors because
[12:30] the calendar has changed
[12:33] but the resolution of the people of God
[12:36] is one based on where they find
[12:37] themselves in position according to his
[12:39] word
[12:40] regardless of what the date is
[12:44] look at some of these resolutions that
[12:46] we're going to read in psalm 105.
[12:50] here's our resolutions
[12:52] give thanks unto the Lord
[12:55] call upon his name
[12:58] make known his deeds among the people
[13:03] sing unto him
[13:04] sing Psalms unto him Taki of all his
[13:08] wondrous works
[13:11] how are these for resolutions
[13:14] glory in His holy name
[13:17] seek the Lord and his strength seek his
[13:21] face forevermore
[13:23] remember His Marvelous Works which he
[13:26] hath done in the judgments of his mouth
[13:28] the resolution of the people of God
[13:31] based on the position where they found
[13:34] themselves
[13:36] you know our Focus isn't on dates and
[13:39] times
[13:40] our resolution is based on what he has
[13:42] done and what he said he would do
[13:46] our faith is thus saith the Lord and
[13:48] that's all
[13:51] in fact he deals with the time question
[13:53] in verse 8.
[13:56] he says he hath remembered his Covenant
[13:58] forever
[13:59] the word which he commanded to a
[14:01] thousand Generations
[14:03] a thousand Generations just for
[14:05] reference
[14:07] according to Matthew 1 the amount of
[14:09] time from Adam to Jesus was 42.
[14:13] Generations
[14:15] so a thousand generation long promise is
[14:18] still well within its expiration date
[14:21] amen
[14:23] his word came forth and it will be
[14:26] fulfilled
[14:28] our resolution is simply to give him
[14:30] thanks
[14:32] to call upon his name
[14:35] to make his deeds known
[14:38] to sing praises unto him
[14:40] to talk of his works
[14:43] to glory in his name
[14:46] to seek his face
[14:48] and to remember his works
[14:53] the continual resolution of the people
[14:55] of God
[14:57] so let's just read that portion together
[14:59] Psalm 105 1-15
[15:03] together
[15:04] oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon
[15:07] his name make known his deeds among the
[15:10] People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto
[15:13] him talk ye of all his wondrous Works
[15:16] Glory ye in His holy name let the heart
[15:20] of them Rejoice that seek the Lord
[15:22] seek the Lord in his strength seek his
[15:25] face forevermore remember His Marvelous
[15:28] works that he hath done his wonders and
[15:31] the judgments of his mouth oh ye Seed of
[15:34] Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob
[15:36] his chosen he is the Lord Our God his
[15:40] judgments are in all the Earth he hath
[15:42] remembered his Covenant forever the word
[15:45] which he commanded to a thousand
[15:47] Generations which Covenant he made with
[15:49] Abraham and his oath with Isaac and
[15:52] confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law
[15:55] and to Israel for an Everlasting
[15:57] Covenant saying unto thee will I give
[15:59] the land of Canaan the lot of your
[16:02] inheritance when they were but a few men
[16:04] in number yea very few and strangers in
[16:07] it when they went from one nation to
[16:09] another from one Kingdom to another
[16:11] people he suffered no man to do them
[16:14] wrong yea he reproved Kings for their
[16:17] sakes saying touch not mine anointed and
[16:20] do my prophets no harm

[24:29] God bless you God bless you Church
[24:31] oh please part of my little story today
[24:34] I have a testimony oh
[24:37] um so uh
[24:39] you know as we are on on Woody but you
[24:43] know Gus Grace still you know goes and
[24:46] goes with us every single day
[24:48] uh so I remember you know me and my wife
[24:51] we talked to each other and we said look
[24:53] uh I'm done with two babies you know
[24:55] like I think thank God you know you're
[24:58] giving me the boy a girl um and I think
[25:01] I'm I'm good and
[25:05] um and the way my brain works my brain
[25:07] you know I think when my daughter is now
[25:09] seven I think my brain started to you
[25:11] know correlate with the way she talks
[25:13] now I I can't comprehend little babies
[25:15] uh so uh I told her I was like look no
[25:19] and then uh you know we started telling
[25:21] ourselves we started reinforcing that to
[25:23] say no more babies no more babies and we
[25:25] say okay good and I remember we talked
[25:28] about it in a particular day and when we
[25:31] went to sleep
[25:32] I just had to dream it was so real then
[25:35] I saw another boy in the dream and in
[25:37] the dream you know he was telling me Oh
[25:39] his name is Joshua Joshua and you know
[25:42] he was playing with my other son and I
[25:44] looked in the dream I was like oh God
[25:46] there's another one
[25:48] um so then I then I woke up and
[25:51] immediately you know sometimes you just
[25:53] dreaming sometimes you're probably just
[25:54] forgetting me maybe you ate too much at
[25:56] night and you went to sleep okay but
[25:59] immediately something told me you better
[26:01] call your wife and tell your wife you
[26:03] know because my mom is like you guys can
[26:05] still have one so I called my mom and my
[26:07] wife the next morning and said look I
[26:09] found another baby in the dream and his
[26:11] name is Joshua you know we started
[26:13] telling ourselves oh no no it's not
[26:15] going to happen and I remember we came
[26:17] to church in particular Sunday sitting
[26:19] down there the pastor was dedicating
[26:21] butter brother to Momo so I think his
[26:23] name is Danny it was dedicating his son
[26:25] and the pastor has never dedicated any
[26:28] of my kid his is always out in the field
[26:31] or maybe he travels and then he was
[26:33] dedicating the boy he is sitting down
[26:34] there that thing told me oh he's about
[26:35] he's going to dedicate one more boy for
[26:37] you I was like no and then we were
[26:40] driving home I told my wife what had
[26:42] come to me and say you know I talk to
[26:43] myself a lot this is what happened this
[26:45] is what I was seeing you know the baby
[26:48] hasn't even been in the picture and then
[26:51] it wasn't you know a few months after
[26:52] that I think couple of months after that
[26:55] I was just getting ready for work and
[26:57] you know my wife just dropped something
[26:58] on the bed and saying number three has
[27:00] entered the game I was like what gamer
[27:02] used
[27:04] I was like what game are you talking
[27:05] about and then you know it was you know
[27:08] then she was she had you know taken in I
[27:11] was like oh God in my mind I came back
[27:14] to life to say okay I already told you
[27:16] and I told you what his name is and so I
[27:18] was like okay no problem but in my mind
[27:19] you know the devil would say it's gonna
[27:21] be a girl I don't know what you're
[27:22] talking about that's a girl the boy is
[27:25] probably gonna come after so I was like
[27:27] so I went
[27:29] and no so I waited and then she we went
[27:32] she did the ultrasound you know very
[27:34] early you know my wife said you know she
[27:36] came back and said you got to pay me to
[27:38] know what the gender is I was like oh
[27:40] okay so I paid it you know to say okay
[27:43] but in my mind I've already you know I
[27:46] was certain I told her I was like yes
[27:47] I'm going to but I know what it's going
[27:49] to be
[27:50] um and then when she told me you know it
[27:51] was a boy you know I just uh want to use
[27:54] that testimony to say you know even
[27:56] though in in my state you know he still

[52:28] ourselves Allah but we come here this
[52:31] morning and we dedicate this baby back

[53:48] amen
[53:55] God bless you this morning
[53:57] uh it it's certainly nice to be in the
[54:01] house of the Lord and
[54:04] I just wanted to
[54:07] um
[54:09] sister Lori you can stay and everybody
[54:12] else even state two I guess this because
[54:15] we're going to invite I'm not going to
[54:17] preach this morning brother Billy's
[54:18] going to preach but I wanted to talk to
[54:20] you for a moment this morning so uh I I
[54:25] just want to kind of give you a little
[54:27] update and an explanation and uh kind of
[54:32] uh
[54:34] let you kind of know where we're
[54:37] standing I know the other day I turned
[54:40] off the tape so I got a lot of phone
[54:42] calls from a lot of people about my
[54:44] health
[54:45] I'm just old
[54:48] other than that I think I can go as long
[54:53] as the Lord's got me on his calendar
[54:56] but if God wants to take me there's not
[54:59] enough doctors or medicines or anything
[55:02] to keep me here and I don't want to be
[55:04] here
[55:06] like Paul said he said I I would that I
[55:10] would go on but as long as it's better
[55:13] for you that I stay I'll stay and and
[55:17] then again if if
[55:19] you know
[55:21] if God's going to leave me here there
[55:23] ain't enough devils in the world to take
[55:25] me so I'm I'm here to serve him
[55:29] uh he's loved me through thick and thin
[55:32] he's uh the list of what he's forgiven
[55:37] me for is
[55:38] could wrap around the world four or five
[55:41] times he's just wonderful loving God
[55:45] that never failed
[55:47] and his word is undying
[55:50] and it it never comes back void
[55:54] I I want to just let you realize that
[55:57] you know that we're now entering very
[56:01] very close into uh the actual
[56:05] construction phase all the dirt work the
[56:09] dirt work would have all been finished
[56:10] but the their machine broke down
[56:13] so we have a little bit of more dirt to
[56:15] haul off and we'll be ready to
[56:19] start laying our
[56:22] Foundation
[56:23] I don't know if you noticed the color of
[56:26] that dirt out there it's very red or
[56:29] orange or whatever color you want it it
[56:33] will stain
[56:36] okay so it's not there to let your kids
[56:40] play in
[56:44] they'll have orange hands
[56:46] orange feet orange clothes you will have
[56:50] orange carpet
[56:52] you'll have orange dust in your cars
[56:54] parents please keep an eye on your
[56:57] children
[56:58] we're going to start having open ditches
[57:01] and lumber and and
[57:04] difficult places and narrow places to
[57:07] watch so it could be the best that you
[57:10] can uh be aware of what that we're going
[57:15] through ask as we make certain
[57:21] construction moves
[57:24] uh we will have to close and open
[57:27] different sections of the parking
[57:30] if you come in and you're one of the
[57:33] first people's
[57:34] here park is close to
[57:38] the curb to either your right or left as
[57:42] you can don't pull in and just park in
[57:45] the middle
[57:47] okay start at one end imagine the lines
[57:53] you know what I mean and and then just
[57:57] with your imagination just park you know
[58:00] decently so we can get 12 cars in a
[58:04] place where we're getting six now
[58:07] uh don't be afraid to park in the far
[58:11] parking lot just remember you used to
[58:14] walk all the way from the church down
[58:17] the street
[58:19] so uh that was to get you all in shape
[58:23] and so you could make the walk from the
[58:27] back of the parking lot when the church
[58:29] is after the church is constructed the
[58:33] bridge back here and that pathway will
[58:35] no longer be available you will have to
[58:38] walk around
[58:40] so I I believe that a lot of people call
[58:43] it training your mind so you can start
[58:46] training yourself to walk around the
[58:49] parking lot to the church it's safer and
[58:52] better
[58:53] so uh we just want to throw that out
[58:56] there it's very important uh you know
[58:59] because we don't want anybody Falling In
[59:01] Ditches or getting slivers from boards
[59:04] or stepping on nails or all those uh
[59:08] different things so let's all be mindful
[59:10] uh that there is construction going on
[59:13] let's watch and keep safe like I know
[59:16] little boys like to jump on machines you
[59:20] know don't go jumping on the bulldozers
[59:22] or or any of things like that so we want
[59:25] to let you know that also
[59:28] we want to give you an understanding of
[59:32] the direction that we're heading in in
[59:35] what's taking place
[59:38] uh right now we're in a building that is
[59:43] about
[59:47] 4995 square feet
[59:50] that's the size of the building
[59:53] uh that we're in now
[59:56] and it takes us about
[1:00:01] 33 000 a year
[1:00:05] to pay the expenses
[1:00:08] on this building
[1:00:10] uh and that's the uh and that's for the
[1:00:14] electricity the gas the water the
[1:00:17] telephone the internet the supplies the
[1:00:20] repairs and uh so that so we haven't had
[1:00:25] a mortgage
[1:00:27] it over the last uh year or so
[1:00:31] and uh so
[1:00:33] uh we haven't had a mortgage payment so
[1:00:36] we've been able to move the money that
[1:00:39] we normally would have for a mortgage
[1:00:42] payment into the building fund so our
[1:00:46] our total offerings
[1:00:48] uh last year was about 154
[1:00:54] thousand dollars that's what everybody
[1:00:56] contributed
[1:00:58] 36
[1:01:00] 000 of that was from one donor
[1:01:05] Okay so
[1:01:07] so if if that 36 000 was taken out of
[1:01:13] the picture
[1:01:14] we would have received about a hundred
[1:01:16] and twenty one thousand dollars in
[1:01:18] offering last year
[1:01:22] so if if you you you you
[1:01:25] take that out basically so what we would
[1:01:28] have received with that uh taken outs
[1:01:32] about 121
[1:01:34] 000. so if we would deduct the 33 from
[1:01:37] the hundred and eighteen thousand give
[1:01:39] us about eighty five thousand dollars
[1:01:42] so I want the reason I'm saying this
[1:01:45] with something in mind not necessarily
[1:01:47] to give a financial report but to make
[1:01:51] us all aware of something
[1:01:53] so if we add the mortgage what our
[1:01:57] mortgage we anticipate our mortgage to
[1:01:59] be
[1:02:00] around 80 around 78 000 a year and we we
[1:02:06] bring back we add
[1:02:08] the existing expenses that would be
[1:02:12] about a hundred and eleven thousand
[1:02:14] dollars a year and that would give us
[1:02:18] maybe a ten thousand dollar margin
[1:02:22] but the size of the building is going to
[1:02:26] Triple
[1:02:29] so we're going we're we're going from uh
[1:02:33] uh just about uh
[1:02:37] fourth uh
[1:02:39] four thousand nine hundred and something
[1:02:42] to fifteen thousand two hundred square
[1:02:45] feet
[1:02:47] so I think you can do the math
[1:02:50] you know every time I drive by one of
[1:02:53] those great big gigantic houses I think
[1:02:56] man what's their mortgage
[1:02:58] and then my second thought is what's
[1:03:01] their electric bill
[1:03:02] what's their gas bill what's their water
[1:03:05] bill
[1:03:06] so our our expenses won't triple
[1:03:10] but they'll increase
[1:03:12] significantly so I want you to be aware
[1:03:16] of this that we're moving from
[1:03:19] 4995 feet to fifteen thousand two
[1:03:22] hundred and
[1:03:24] at 80 square feet basically now
[1:03:32] you have been wonderful
[1:03:35] faithful givers
[1:03:38] and you know I don't come to you and
[1:03:40] talk about money and I don't beg
[1:03:44] for money
[1:03:45] many many things I reach into my pocket
[1:03:49] and take care of
[1:03:52] I'll I'll just be honest with you we
[1:03:55] helped with over
[1:03:56] uh sixty thousand dollars of medical
[1:03:59] bills for people last year
[1:04:03] probably another thirty five thousand
[1:04:05] dollar in rent
[1:04:07] and bill payments
[1:04:09] so that wouldn't have been made possible
[1:04:13] without you
[1:04:15] your great wonderful givers
[1:04:18] but I want to give you
[1:04:21] a fact that I want you all to understand
[1:04:24] I don't know who they are but only 60
[1:04:27] percent
[1:04:29] of our adult wage earners
[1:04:33] contribute to the church
[1:04:38] okay only six out of ten not talking
[1:04:41] about children
[1:04:42] six out of ten
[1:04:45] adult wage earners
[1:04:48] or 60 percent
[1:04:50] contribute to the church
[1:04:54] so what's happening is
[1:04:57] 60 percent of us
[1:05:00] are building the church
[1:05:03] 60 of us that give
[1:05:06] are building the church for the 40
[1:05:08] percent that don't give
[1:05:12] and those are people that sometimes
[1:05:16] visit there's people they come
[1:05:18] periodically but we want them here
[1:05:22] I want the 40 here because I want them
[1:05:24] to get saved
[1:05:29] and
[1:05:30] and so we don't need any more money from
[1:05:35] those of you that are giving
[1:05:38] but we need those that
[1:05:41] haven't been giving
[1:05:43] and understand that the responsibility
[1:05:48] that someone's heating is someone's
[1:05:51] going to provide padded seats for you
[1:05:53] someone's going to cool you somebody's
[1:05:56] going to give you water somebody's going
[1:05:58] to give you a place to change your
[1:06:00] diapers somebody's going to give you a
[1:06:02] place to to take your children a
[1:06:05] playground for your kids to play on a
[1:06:08] place for you to park
[1:06:12] you know you might just take it for
[1:06:15] granted
[1:06:16] but somebody's worked hard
[1:06:19] to do that
[1:06:21] and so if if
[1:06:25] everybody would carry their weight
[1:06:29] it would be later for us all
[1:06:32] and and so uh I mean I could read the
[1:06:36] scripture I had it marked here
[1:06:39] you know uh
[1:06:41] the the scripture said and I say this to
[1:06:45] you if you want to read a wonderful
[1:06:48] portion of scripture
[1:06:50] that absolutely describes
[1:06:56] the age we're living in
[1:06:58] and the blessings for keeping God's word
[1:07:02] and the curses for not keeping God's
[1:07:05] word
[1:07:06] and a wonderful scripture that explains
[1:07:09] the atmosphere and the hour that we live
[1:07:13] in read the prophecy of Malachi
[1:07:17] The Book of Malachi uh absolutely I I
[1:07:21] was reading it this morning and it it it
[1:07:24] it just stunned me
[1:07:27] it literally stunned me what was what
[1:07:31] was transpired and how the the people
[1:07:35] make it for example in the fourth verse
[1:07:38] it says for behold the day cometh fourth
[1:07:40] chapter for behold the day cometh that
[1:07:44] shall burn as an oven
[1:07:46] and all the proud yea all that do
[1:07:50] wickedly shall be stubble
[1:07:53] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:07:57] up sayeth the Lord a hosts and it shall
[1:08:01] be
[1:08:02] letting them it shall leave them neither
[1:08:07] root nor offspring
[1:08:09] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:08:12] son
[1:08:13] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:08:17] his wings and ye shall go forth and grow
[1:08:21] up as calves of the stall and you know
[1:08:25] we'd go on and read it says behold I
[1:08:28] send you Elijah the prophet what a
[1:08:30] wonderful day that we live in
[1:08:32] but kid there's also other scriptures in
[1:08:35] here about not keeping my commandments
[1:08:37] so one it says will a man rob God
[1:08:43] and yet ye have robbed me
[1:08:46] the Lord says but ye say wherein have we
[1:08:50] robbed thee in tithes
[1:08:53] and offerings
[1:08:56] and he says and ye are cursed with the
[1:08:59] curse for you have robbed me even this
[1:09:02] whole nation
[1:09:05] you know in my experiences I've lent a
[1:09:10] lot of money
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:13] 90 percent of the people
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:19] come for funds are people that don't
[1:09:21] tithe or give offering
[1:09:27] I can't tell you
[1:09:29] the blessing of giving
[1:09:33] you know what I mean I mean I I
[1:09:35] it doesn't matter if it's a quarter in
[1:09:39] the Salvation Army bucket
[1:09:41] that's wonderful it's wonderful to give
[1:09:45] you cannot out give God you can't do it
[1:09:50] you can't do it but I I know that the
[1:09:53] the Lord has blessed you
[1:09:56] and we're not a rich people we're all
[1:09:59] Working Class People
[1:10:01] we don't have big business owners that
[1:10:04] have large amount of profits and act
[1:10:08] that every one of us most all of us have
[1:10:10] jobs we're wage earners it's hard to
[1:10:14] make time
[1:10:15] the cost of living has gone up uh almost
[1:10:19] 10 percent everything costs more than it
[1:10:23] ever cost before I know that's a burden
[1:10:27] but the Lord made a promise
[1:10:29] he said I'll pour out a blessing upon
[1:10:32] you that you can't contain so uh not
[1:10:38] only
[1:10:39] uh is it you're you're tithing which we
[1:10:43] try to use for the glory of the kingdom
[1:10:46] of God but in your offerings too
[1:10:50] and so I know sometimes people just pay
[1:10:52] their ties but just remember they both
[1:10:55] were canned in hand
[1:10:57] together
[1:10:58] just give what you can sacrifice
[1:11:04] you know what I mean if it's a set
[1:11:06] amount that's up to you
[1:11:08] there's no formula for sacrifice there's
[1:11:12] no formula
[1:11:13] forgiving
[1:11:15] but we never want to do it we want to do
[1:11:17] it with a joyful heart but I want you to
[1:11:20] know that I think this morning in our
[1:11:24] building here we probably they've
[1:11:25] counted them up we have some maybe
[1:11:27] somewhere between
[1:11:30] 350 and 360 people in this building this
[1:11:34] morning counting in the back and and I
[1:11:37] know some of my friends from
[1:11:40] Galena are here somewhere so
[1:11:43] the blessing to have them amen God bless
[1:11:48] you and but
[1:11:51] we got to do this together
[1:11:54] you understand and so I so those of you
[1:11:57] that have been faithful thank you
[1:12:00] continue the good work
[1:12:03] for those of you that haven't put your
[1:12:06] heart into it and you're worried about
[1:12:10] making ends meet and you're worried
[1:12:13] about those things I can say this to you
[1:12:17] as thus saith the Lord I've never seen
[1:12:20] the righteous big bread
[1:12:23] so put God first
[1:12:26] love them with all your heart
[1:12:28] keep his Commandments
[1:12:31] if you can
[1:12:33] give to help
[1:12:37] provide for yourself and those that are
[1:12:40] around you give with a joyful heart but
[1:12:44] so I'm I'm not asking those of you that
[1:12:46] have been faithful
[1:12:47] to get do any more than what you're
[1:12:50] doing
[1:12:52] I'm just asking those of us that
[1:12:55] haven't
[1:12:58] put a little effort into it if you just
[1:13:02] do your little part I think we can make
[1:13:05] it just fine
[1:13:07] amen and that about as gentle as I can
[1:13:10] say it
[1:13:12] you know what I mean I I this is not a
[1:13:15] comfortable subject uh for me to talk
[1:13:19] about uh a money I don't I don't do it
[1:13:22] often uh but I do know you can't I'll
[1:13:26] give God and we can give you a more
[1:13:29] thorough report I wasn't a financial
[1:13:32] report this morning so to speak that's
[1:13:35] the trustees job but I I wanted you to
[1:13:38] know that
[1:13:41] somebody's providing for you to have a
[1:13:44] place to sit
[1:13:45] so if you'll take care of your spot
[1:13:50] God will bless you and we want to have a
[1:13:53] place where people can get come to know
[1:13:55] the Lord don't you
[1:13:57] amen there's there's nothing greater
[1:14:01] than to come to know the Lord I'm going
[1:14:04] to take the evening service uh this
[1:14:07] evening and and kind of continue down
[1:14:09] the line of thought that I've I've taken
[1:14:13] I I didn't really this morning want to
[1:14:16] talk about uh finals and money and the
[1:14:20] building and things like that and try to
[1:14:22] switch gears into preaching but I think
[1:14:25] it's very needful
[1:14:27] that we're all aware of what that
[1:14:31] we're going into
[1:14:34] you know what I mean and and
[1:14:37] uh and like you know
[1:14:40] you saw what Egypt did
[1:14:43] when all the Israelites were
[1:14:47] putting their shoulder roll they built
[1:14:49] great pyramids and they did all these
[1:14:51] great things but one day Israel went to
[1:14:53] the promised land
[1:14:55] amen I want to go to the promised land
[1:14:58] don't you I want to take everybody that
[1:15:01] God's called to get there I want to make
[1:15:03] this message available I I want I want
[1:15:07] us to become a church of Outreach
[1:15:11] not necessarily a church of inner
[1:15:14] blessings but a church that's spreading
[1:15:17] the good news that's going out and
[1:15:20] sharing the gospel with who will ever
[1:15:22] listening providing this message in
[1:15:25] whatever media form tape book recording
[1:15:29] website I don't know all that there are
[1:15:32] all that we can
[1:15:34] to let this world understand
[1:15:37] that there was a voice that came to
[1:15:41] guide us through the darkness
[1:15:44] not an intellect
[1:15:46] a voice
[1:15:49] a voice
[1:15:53] in the days of The Voice
[1:15:56] the mysteries of God
[1:15:58] shall belt revealed
[1:16:00] the secrets of the heart will be made
[1:16:03] known
[1:16:04] we can't do it by making our own plan we
[1:16:08] can't do it by making our own
[1:16:10] explanation we can't give out
[1:16:12] second-hand Revelation explaining what
[1:16:15] brother Branham man or explaining this
[1:16:16] or explaining that dogger I'm telling
[1:16:19] you the bride is attracted by The Voice
[1:16:22] my sheep know my voice amen if we'll
[1:16:27] make that available to the Dying World
[1:16:29] if we'll give them a book if we'll give
[1:16:31] them a tape if we'll tell them where to
[1:16:33] go if we'll just give the great
[1:16:35] testimony that God sent a messenger in
[1:16:38] this hour I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[1:16:40] of Jesus Christ
[1:16:42] amen because it's the salvation of God
[1:16:45] unto them that will believe and this
[1:16:49] church is in here so we can have a
[1:16:51] social Gathering
[1:16:54] this church is here to be a lighthouse
[1:16:57] that those that are sick
[1:16:59] those that are irk
[1:17:02] held captive by Spirits in demons
[1:17:05] those that are down those that are weary
[1:17:09] they can come in and find a Fountain of
[1:17:12] Life they can find people's hearts who
[1:17:15] are on fire that are loving one another
[1:17:18] and you'll never know when your time
[1:17:21] will come
[1:17:22] that you'll need to take a drink
[1:17:26] from that fountain or from that well

[1:17:49] I'm not scolding you this morning I just
[1:17:52] feel that you have a right

[1:21:38] our gracious father are we so thankful
[1:21:40] to be gathering your house Lord
[1:21:42] in your presence father God we want to
[1:21:45] commit ourselves back to your hands and
[1:21:47] invite you right now that you come in
[1:21:49] you break the bread of life Lord father
[1:21:52] your word is life unto us and father we
[1:21:55] pass this morning that the portion that
[1:21:57] you had allocated Lord for this morning
[1:21:59] that you may give it to us Lord we thank
[1:22:01] you Lord and we know that all our
[1:22:03] differences all our trials and father
[1:22:06] all of the human problems that we have
[1:22:08] Lord that your word will fix it for us
[1:22:11] Lord because you promised that when we
[1:22:13] step into their presence Lord that you
[1:22:15] will take care of not just of our
[1:22:17] spiritual but even our natural Lord we
[1:22:19] ask this morning you speak to us
[1:22:21] according to your word in the name of
[1:22:23] the Lord Jesus we pray and ask amen
[1:22:27] amen God bless you this morning man are
[1:22:30] you happy to be in the house of God
[1:22:31] Amen I would just like to ask you a man
[1:22:35] to realize that anything that happened
[1:22:39] right now from right now you can reset
[1:22:41] your clock to 10 30.
[1:22:44] we've just stepped into eternity and all
[1:22:46] the time before it's just time amen
[1:22:49] let's open our Bibles in this small
[1:22:52] scripture reading this morning men will
[1:22:54] try not to be too long we'll just take
[1:22:56] the time we need and and uh
[1:22:59] we'll do that yeah I feel you familiar
[1:23:02] scripture reading John 3 16 it says for
[1:23:05] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:23:08] only begotten son that whosoever believe
[1:23:12] in him should not perish
[1:23:15] but have everlasting life let me read it
[1:23:20] again for God so loved the world that he
[1:23:22] gave his only begotten son that so ever
[1:23:25] believe in him should not perish
[1:23:27] but have everlasting life father we ask
[1:23:31] you you bless your word to us Lord we
[1:23:34] commit ourselves to your hands in Jesus
[1:23:35] name we pray amen amen God bless you and
[1:23:38] have your seats this morning
[1:23:41] thank you
[1:23:49] mind this uh for just a few minutes like
[1:23:53] I said I want I'll try not to be too
[1:23:55] long
[1:23:56] um as we read the scripture I was
[1:24:00] inspired by what our pastor has been
[1:24:02] preached last time about the Capstone
[1:24:04] love and and as I began to look at it
[1:24:08] and it's something uh perhaps this
[1:24:11] morning we'll just try to be on this uh
[1:24:14] if something just came through my heart
[1:24:16] and it became almost a realization that
[1:24:20] it's the when you when you speak about
[1:24:22] Capstone love you have to also
[1:24:24] understand that the it's not just love
[1:24:27] that caps it off but it's also love that
[1:24:30] begins all everything so in other words
[1:24:33] it's the love that begins it is the love
[1:24:35] that ends it uh but one of them says oh
[1:24:38] the scripture will tell us that Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ is the Chief Cornerstone but yet
[1:24:43] he's the same Jesus who comes and is the
[1:24:45] very Capstone that comes upon the church
[1:24:47] so if you don't begin in love you won't
[1:24:49] end in love if you're beginning
[1:24:51] something else whatever you begin with
[1:24:53] you'll end with but if you begin in love
[1:24:56] it will end in love also and so it's the
[1:24:59] same that started the work the same God
[1:25:01] who started the work the same God will
[1:25:03] bring it to a finish we don't have to
[1:25:06] worry this morning and come and say well
[1:25:07] I believe I became a Christian what is
[1:25:10] my ending going to be no the same Jesus
[1:25:12] by love who came in to rescue you the
[1:25:15] same Jesus who came and made himself
[1:25:17] known unto you the same Jesus is here to
[1:25:20] take you to the Finish Line love is the
[1:25:22] motivation of it all love is what God is
[1:25:26] using in order for him to bring this to
[1:25:28] an achievement so when we get together
[1:25:30] when we we look at ourselves we have to
[1:25:33] also understand every time that this is
[1:25:35] about the love of God it's not about our
[1:25:38] ability but his love that brought us
[1:25:40] together I was even thinking when we we
[1:25:43] think of ourselves when we uh by the
[1:25:47] love of God and by the grace of God when
[1:25:49] we get to the other side we're never
[1:25:51] going to sit down and talk about all the
[1:25:53] Mysteries oh do you what do you think
[1:25:55] about that mystery over there what do
[1:25:56] you think about no it's going to be the
[1:25:58] love that works it all together oh the
[1:26:02] love you can go in a very specific and
[1:26:04] detail of each and every one of us and
[1:26:06] how that love orchestrated your birth
[1:26:09] and love came to you and protected your
[1:26:11] parents and your grandparents and love
[1:26:14] came and made a way that he would come
[1:26:16] and meet with you and bring you into his
[1:26:18] kingdom it was love that did all of that
[1:26:21] so as we read the scripture says for God
[1:26:24] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:26:26] begotten son that would so ever believe
[1:26:29] in him should not perish but have
[1:26:32] eternal life oh I was reading this and I
[1:26:34] was uh studying the message that
[1:26:37] bravanan preached love and and another
[1:26:40] one that he called when love is project
[1:26:42] uh projected and I want to give for a
[1:26:44] title this morning uh God's love
[1:26:46] projected will produce Grace God's love
[1:26:49] being projected will always produce
[1:26:52] Grace and and the capping and basically
[1:26:55] the foundation and the caps Stone being
[1:26:58] both love and Venom will make a
[1:27:00] statement and he says in that message
[1:27:02] you would say uh speak about the the the
[1:27:06] text it would say oh perhaps this some
[1:27:09] doesn't seem to be much more of a text
[1:27:11] in it it's just such a short reading as
[1:27:14] you would say but he said oh I wonder if
[1:27:17] we understand if we know the value of
[1:27:19] the text we just read oh if the
[1:27:22] Christians we would I thought about even
[1:27:24] us this morning will took a Bible we
[1:27:26] read or even when you were at home but
[1:27:29] David came here and he talked about how
[1:27:30] he was reading in the Book of Malachi
[1:27:33] then he read and and all those things
[1:27:35] and whether you would ask yourself did I
[1:27:37] really understand the value of what I'm
[1:27:40] reading or you do I even understand who
[1:27:43] whose words am I reading in the Bible
[1:27:46] when I read and when I come in contact
[1:27:48] with a Bible or when I come to church
[1:27:51] and the word of God is being preached do
[1:27:54] I have the full understanding of what's
[1:27:56] really taking place at that moment he
[1:27:59] would want us to come into an
[1:28:00] understanding that as We Gather here
[1:28:02] this morning that we are reading the
[1:28:04] word of a living God this is not someone
[1:28:07] who got excited and they wrote it down
[1:28:09] and he said well you know we'll do this
[1:28:12] for Good Conduct and we'll write this so
[1:28:14] people can behave goodly but this is the
[1:28:17] word of the Living God the same God who
[1:28:19] said the letter B is the same God who
[1:28:22] wrote the word that we have read this
[1:28:24] morning the same God who created heaven
[1:28:26] and earth is the same one who brought
[1:28:29] this down that God so loved the world
[1:28:31] that he gave his only begotten son in
[1:28:33] other words the same word has the
[1:28:35] creative power than the word that was in
[1:28:37] the beginning
[1:28:39] that it's the expression of the same God
[1:28:42] it speaks about the same God it speaks
[1:28:45] about the doing of the same God trying
[1:28:47] to get to an objective oh my if we would
[1:28:50] come it would it would you would come
[1:28:52] this morning and he will say here it
[1:28:54] says oh now uh I I know he says this
[1:28:58] little piece of paper half inch square
[1:29:00] would not be worth any picking up on the
[1:29:04] streets it says but it wasn't the value
[1:29:06] of the paper it's the value that lays in
[1:29:10] what's on the paper
[1:29:12] the value of what's on the paper uh he
[1:29:16] talks about the little boy who who went
[1:29:18] and it went up in the attic and
[1:29:20] collected a stamp and he took that stamp
[1:29:23] and to the little boy all he wanted was
[1:29:26] an ice cream corn what all he wanted was
[1:29:29] something that can just something small
[1:29:31] that he could satisfy himself with and
[1:29:33] he took it to a collector and collected
[1:29:35] gave him and he went and he he got an
[1:29:37] ice cream and he that that was
[1:29:39] satisfying for him but yet the collector
[1:29:42] knew the value of it and he knew he
[1:29:44] could get 50 bucks for it and that's all
[1:29:46] he got for it but yet as you go down the
[1:29:49] line there was one who thought it was
[1:29:51] most valuable and he got a quarter
[1:29:54] million dollar for the same step the
[1:29:56] same stamp that was in the hand of the
[1:29:58] boy the same step that was in the
[1:30:00] collector's hand the same stamp ended up
[1:30:03] costing a quarter million dollars in
[1:30:05] other words it's the same word that you
[1:30:07] have this morning it's not a different
[1:30:09] word if you need salvation it's in the
[1:30:11] same word the question question is what
[1:30:14] value are you putting in the word what
[1:30:16] value to what value do you get into the
[1:30:19] word if you come this morning some came
[1:30:21] in just for healing they got healing
[1:30:23] some came for salvation not all they got
[1:30:26] but I'm here to announce to you that
[1:30:28] it's more than that it's the Mighty God
[1:30:32] of presenting himself and moving into
[1:30:35] the midst of his people and I want to
[1:30:37] say this morning the true love is the
[1:30:40] understanding that it's not about what
[1:30:42] I'm looking for but it's about the
[1:30:44] understanding of what God is trying to
[1:30:46] achieve with his word
[1:30:48] the same word and he says it's not the
[1:30:51] value the peppers were not worth but
[1:30:54] it's the value that you put that that's
[1:30:56] that's not on the paper
[1:30:58] and then it says that's the way it is
[1:31:00] with the word of God it isn't just a
[1:31:03] paper that's that's wrote on it but the
[1:31:06] value of it it's because the word of God
[1:31:09] it says because it's the word of the
[1:31:12] Eternal God
[1:31:14] it's the word of the Eternal God and
[1:31:17] Jesus says Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:31:20] away but my word shall never shall never
[1:31:24] fail therefore John 3 16 tonight it says
[1:31:27] although small in its portion holds
[1:31:31] enough value to save the world
[1:31:34] oh my it holds enough value to save the
[1:31:39] world so whatever you have need of just
[1:31:42] throw it in there whatever problem you
[1:31:44] have in the morning just throw it in
[1:31:46] there whatever you have need of this
[1:31:48] morning just throw it it has enough
[1:31:50] power within that same word that I don't
[1:31:53] you don't need to know the entire Bible
[1:31:55] just that one verse is enough to save
[1:31:59] the entire world it says and then he
[1:32:02] says it's it's got enough value in it to
[1:32:06] heal every sick person that's on Earth
[1:32:09] today it's the it says it's a part it's
[1:32:12] it pardons it pardons for every sinner
[1:32:15] it's Joy to the weary person it's a it's
[1:32:19] the hope for the Hopeless it's food for
[1:32:22] the Saints it's healing to the sick it's
[1:32:25] a pardon for those who are troubled and
[1:32:29] all those things that you you that all
[1:32:32] those things to you if you receive that
[1:32:35] so it's all of those things to you if
[1:32:38] you receive that one word of God
[1:32:40] therefore we have to come this morning
[1:32:43] with an understanding I'm here receiving
[1:32:45] the word of God and whatever I have need
[1:32:48] of the word of God is able to give it to
[1:32:50] me the word of God is here sent to me to
[1:32:54] make me what God desired for me to be in
[1:32:57] the end time the word of God has been
[1:32:59] provided in order to bring the
[1:33:01] atmosphere of faith for us to receive it
[1:33:04] and be transformed by it
[1:33:07] oh so for so God God so loved the world
[1:33:10] that he only that he that he gave his
[1:33:13] only begotten son it says that whosoever
[1:33:17] believe in him will not perish but have
[1:33:20] eternal life I want to say this the love
[1:33:23] the word or the love of God as we we
[1:33:26] read it is it says we we as Christians
[1:33:30] we must it's not something that we learn
[1:33:33] in school
[1:33:35] the the love of God it's not something
[1:33:38] that someone will take a pen and a paper
[1:33:40] and begin to write off it and say oh the
[1:33:43] love of God is this and you understand
[1:33:44] and say oh yeah I I understand what he's
[1:33:47] trying to say no the love of God is
[1:33:49] something that one has to come in
[1:33:52] contact with to have an understanding of
[1:33:54] it the love of God is something that
[1:33:57] happens to you an individual where God
[1:34:01] allows you to drop into a mind of his
[1:34:04] mind and begin to understand the things
[1:34:06] that he has done oh my to to look at
[1:34:10] yourself this morning and realize that I
[1:34:12] was born a sinner I was born in sin and
[1:34:15] and Champion iniquity and came into the
[1:34:17] world speaking lies but here I am today
[1:34:20] standing in the congregation of saints
[1:34:23] it takes the love of God for you to even
[1:34:25] understand that
[1:34:27] uh because it's the love that sought you
[1:34:30] it's a love that came and redeemed you
[1:34:32] is the it's a love that came when when
[1:34:35] you were about to die and things was to
[1:34:37] happen and and the situation seems like
[1:34:40] there was no light at all and and you
[1:34:42] seemed like it was the end of you the
[1:34:44] love of God made a way for you to be
[1:34:47] here so therefore when we get together
[1:34:49] let's not look at this in some theology
[1:34:52] or understanding of man oh John is
[1:34:54] writing about a law we need to go and
[1:34:57] study about this law no this is
[1:34:59] something that God is wanting for you to
[1:35:01] get in contact with this morning so you
[1:35:03] can understand what he's talking about
[1:35:06] so it's the love that came and that
[1:35:09] redeems The Sinner and it comes and he
[1:35:12] lives in 99 and and come after one and
[1:35:15] oh I tell you where if you ever been in
[1:35:18] sin and been stuck in the place where
[1:35:20] you know that there's no way I can get
[1:35:22] out of here there's no way I can get
[1:35:25] myself out of this situation then you
[1:35:27] understand what the love of God is
[1:35:32] oh my oh it's overwhelming I'll say it's
[1:35:37] overwhelming it's a love that you could
[1:35:39] think and it's the love that's why we
[1:35:42] you you can't really understand even how
[1:35:45] someone is converted until you
[1:35:47] understand the love of God that's why
[1:35:50] you can't even preach the gospel unless
[1:35:52] you understand the law and that's why
[1:35:54] you cannot be a Christian unless you
[1:35:56] understand the love because it's the
[1:35:58] same love that you want extended to
[1:36:00] others when you yourself have come in
[1:36:03] contact with that love and you've
[1:36:05] realized that if it's not God I won't be
[1:36:08] here if it wasn't for him I would have
[1:36:10] been dead if it wasn't for him I
[1:36:12] wouldn't I would have never been allowed
[1:36:15] to even hear the word of God when you
[1:36:17] come to that understanding it changes
[1:36:20] your mindset about Humanity because what
[1:36:23] you desire is for every person on the
[1:36:25] face of the Earth
[1:36:27] to come in contact with us saying love
[1:36:31] oh my
[1:36:33] oh my
[1:36:35] that scripture says it will say oh for
[1:36:39] God so loved the will
[1:36:41] that he gave you know he gave his only
[1:36:43] begotten son
[1:36:44] I begin to to think about it and oh my I
[1:36:49] was just sitting there just
[1:36:50] overwhelmed me even just dwelling on
[1:36:53] that one verse that God so loved the
[1:36:55] world and I want to say this oftentimes
[1:36:58] we get it even Twisted within our own
[1:37:01] mind when we read that God so loved the
[1:37:04] world what what God what God loved is
[1:37:07] not the buildings that we see out here
[1:37:10] it's not the prevention that we see out
[1:37:12] here it's not what man has done with the
[1:37:15] atmosphere and the pollution that's out
[1:37:17] there that's not what caught love but oh
[1:37:19] if you can think about the beginning God
[1:37:21] with his creation and the scripture says
[1:37:24] in Genesis that God came and it was the
[1:37:27] spirit upon the water and he will look
[1:37:29] at it and he began to brood upon it to
[1:37:32] bring us forth his sin let me say this
[1:37:34] creation has never ended because you are
[1:37:37] supposed to come in and when God said
[1:37:39] God loves all of the world it was you
[1:37:42] that he was thinking about it was he
[1:37:44] knew that he had seen so was to come
[1:37:47] into existence he knew that he had sons
[1:37:49] and daughters that had not come to
[1:37:51] existence yet that he would take time
[1:37:53] that it would take time and in the end
[1:37:55] time it will have a people call upon his
[1:37:58] own name and and who he is and his mercy
[1:38:01] and forgiveness that's the world that
[1:38:03] God loved
[1:38:05] that's a wall that he died for because
[1:38:07] the scripture will tell us that he says
[1:38:10] that the kingdom of God is like a man
[1:38:12] who finds a field he says he will sell
[1:38:14] all he will buy the whole field so he
[1:38:17] can redeem the whole prize so he bought
[1:38:19] the whole world he created the whole
[1:38:21] world for the purpose of having a bride
[1:38:25] oh my if we can only understand that
[1:38:28] it's not the sin and the dragon the
[1:38:31] alcohol or the perversion and the things
[1:38:33] of the world that God is interested in
[1:38:36] but you you it's the thing his process
[1:38:39] of creation his process of bringing
[1:38:42] forth his children Satan came and he
[1:38:45] broke forth we know the prophet will
[1:38:47] tell us oh let me just shrink it for the
[1:38:49] sake of time that that that it was Adam
[1:38:52] there were to bring Child by the spoken
[1:38:55] word
[1:38:55] but that didn't happen why because the
[1:38:59] devil came and he thought he messed up
[1:39:01] the program of God but God within
[1:39:04] himself he couldn't let his love
[1:39:07] obligated him to do something about it
[1:39:09] let me tell you love has obligation love
[1:39:13] will see something to go through love
[1:39:15] will build the bridge where there is
[1:39:17] nothing Love Will Make A Way when
[1:39:19] there's no way well love will make sure
[1:39:22] that whatever was promised will come to
[1:39:24] pass it's not uh the Judgment it's love
[1:39:28] that does that
[1:39:29] if we can understand this morning that
[1:39:32] we sit here because God purposed within
[1:39:35] himself that he would have a people and
[1:39:38] his love obligated him to do that
[1:39:42] oh my
[1:39:46] the prophet will say
[1:39:49] this is perhaps the best known scripture
[1:39:51] in the Bible
[1:39:53] it says it's referred to many times as
[1:39:55] the golden text of the Bible
[1:39:58] and it deals with love and it says and I
[1:40:01] have had the privilege to preach the
[1:40:03] gospel many many to many many uh hidden
[1:40:07] lands he says and I've heard the the
[1:40:09] theories but I've never seen nothing yet
[1:40:13] that would come that would come up to
[1:40:16] the Christian love of God
[1:40:19] nothing yet they'll tell you how someone
[1:40:22] did some great things and how they're
[1:40:25] even they will talk about the sacrifices
[1:40:27] that a person did but nothing will ever
[1:40:30] come close to what the love of God is it
[1:40:33] says no one could explain it the poet
[1:40:36] that's tried to do it the songwriters
[1:40:38] the failed ministers could never do it
[1:40:41] it says in another place he spoke about
[1:40:44] even the the what God was in question
[1:40:47] and answer he says and God was this
[1:40:50] great spirit
[1:40:52] we picture him like seven colors of
[1:40:54] rainbow that covers it says the bow that
[1:40:59] he says the bow would actually cover the
[1:41:02] Earth if it distract the Earth
[1:41:06] it says it's like a water it's like
[1:41:09] water in a circle of the curvature of
[1:41:13] the earth it says what makes it but now
[1:41:16] it says God is eternal he was perfect
[1:41:20] it says perfect love perfect peace
[1:41:23] perfect Joy perfect sacrifice it says
[1:41:27] all those Spirits all those Spirits all
[1:41:31] those Spirits as we get in the
[1:41:34] Revelation they came out and was made
[1:41:37] out with perfection
[1:41:39] and I want to say this anything that was
[1:41:42] outside of God was not God
[1:41:45] and and and I want to say this because
[1:41:47] when we read this perfect love perfect
[1:41:49] everything love and I want to say this
[1:41:52] love is perfection
[1:41:55] often time when we speak about
[1:41:58] perfection our mind about perfectionist
[1:42:01] we've gathered together and we have a
[1:42:04] painting here and everybody looks at it
[1:42:06] and says what do you think and we all
[1:42:09] come to a conclusion oh that's perfect
[1:42:11] that's that's good we like The Strokes
[1:42:14] and everything and all the art lovers
[1:42:16] will look at it and will appreciate it
[1:42:18] all the known art lovers will look at it
[1:42:20] they'll just be something that struck
[1:42:22] the eye that looks nice that's not
[1:42:24] perfection
[1:42:25] because Perfection is not anything to do
[1:42:29] with the one who's watching Perfection
[1:42:31] has everything to do with the Creator
[1:42:34] himself Perfection is in the eyes of the
[1:42:37] one who made it Perfection is what I've
[1:42:40] designed what I've made is it fulfilling
[1:42:44] the reason why I made it but when I will
[1:42:46] talk about Michelangelo who made the
[1:42:49] Statue and everything he had he had a
[1:42:51] thought in his mind the prophet will say
[1:42:53] and he will come and it will strike the
[1:42:56] the the the the the the the the the the
[1:42:57] the stone and it will strike it it says
[1:43:00] until it match what was in his mind when
[1:43:04] he matched what was in his mind Oh my he
[1:43:07] wanted it to come so much alive why
[1:43:10] because it was the exact picture that
[1:43:12] was in his mind that's Perfection oh my
[1:43:15] and God in this end time he's working up
[1:43:18] a bride and he's working and I want to
[1:43:20] say this it's not for you to look and
[1:43:22] look at the scripture say well I don't
[1:43:24] do this I don't do this but purpose is
[1:43:26] are you fulfilling the reason why God
[1:43:28] placed you here
[1:43:30] and he's the one that judges the
[1:43:32] Perfection he's the one that perfects it
[1:43:34] he's the one that brings what's missing
[1:43:36] he's the one who's working on this
[1:43:38] masterpiece so he can bring it into this
[1:43:40] image he says when he looked at Jesus
[1:43:43] Christ he was so perfect that he smid
[1:43:46] him
[1:43:48] he came and he smiled his own his own
[1:43:51] work so why because he was perfect to
[1:43:55] him he says speak and the right came out
[1:43:58] of him as we know that
[1:44:01] oh my so when we look at ourselves we
[1:44:04] have to always look according to the
[1:44:07] scripture
[1:44:09] so I want to say this morning it's
[1:44:12] important as Christian
[1:44:15] that we walk in love
[1:44:18] and our Focus be
[1:44:20] on the love of God that suttered
[1:44:22] everything
[1:44:24] Paul was speaking First Corinthians 13
[1:44:26] it says though I speak in tongues of men
[1:44:31] and angels and I have no charity I have
[1:44:34] not charity I'm like a sounding Bryce in
[1:44:37] the tingling symbol
[1:44:40] it says and no I have the gift of
[1:44:43] Prophecy and understanding
[1:44:46] and understand all the mysteries in all
[1:44:49] knowledge and though I have all faith
[1:44:54] now see I want you to see the
[1:44:57] positioning of what Paul is putting on
[1:45:00] love above everything else
[1:45:03] eat the positioning of tongues and
[1:45:06] interpretations and the ability to speak
[1:45:09] mystery to understand Mysteries to teach
[1:45:12] the understanding of the entire Bible
[1:45:14] but it says before all of that could lay
[1:45:17] be laid the foundation has to be loved
[1:45:21] so he says and so I could remove remove
[1:45:24] mountain and have not charity I'm
[1:45:26] nothing
[1:45:27] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:45:32] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:45:36] burned oh my what a sacrifice what a
[1:45:39] what a giving of yourself it says and I
[1:45:42] have no charity it Provident nothing
[1:45:45] charity suffers long and is kind charity
[1:45:50] envious not charity wanted not it says
[1:45:54] and perfect up and not puffed up it says
[1:45:57] do not behave itself unseemingly seek it
[1:46:03] not her own honor is not easily provoked
[1:46:07] and thinketh now evil so yeah and it
[1:46:10] says Rejoice not for uh Rejoice not in
[1:46:13] iniquity but rejoice in the truth it
[1:46:17] says bearing all things believeth all
[1:46:20] things hope with all things endureth all
[1:46:22] things charity never fail but whenever
[1:46:26] it says but whether the there be a
[1:46:28] prophecy they shall fail whether there
[1:46:31] be tongues they shall cease whatever
[1:46:33] they can where there be knowledge it
[1:46:36] shall vanish away so in other words is
[1:46:39] admonishing us this morning if you were
[1:46:42] to be a believer if you were planning to
[1:46:45] make it to the end if you were planning
[1:46:48] to be in this race for a long time if
[1:46:50] you're planning to be a Christian who's
[1:46:53] full of the gift of the spirit one who
[1:46:55] can make it to the end one who's not
[1:46:58] going to fail in every place he says you
[1:47:00] have to make sure that you start with
[1:47:02] Charity with the love of God in your
[1:47:04] heart and let me say this this love is
[1:47:07] not a human love that we gave by reading
[1:47:10] the Bible this love starts off by the
[1:47:13] new birth of the spirit of God where you
[1:47:15] get the love of God into your heart and
[1:47:18] that's what begins everything but Paul
[1:47:20] is here to tell you that after you you
[1:47:22] you you you you you've come in contact
[1:47:24] with this Mysteries with understanding
[1:47:27] with knowledge and with the
[1:47:29] understanding of all whether your
[1:47:31] sacrifice and all of those things make
[1:47:33] sure that your foundation for all those
[1:47:35] things is love
[1:47:40] because all those things let me say that
[1:47:43] sadness and impersonator of everything
[1:47:45] he can impersonate everything but the
[1:47:48] only thing he cannot impersonate is love
[1:47:51] he doesn't have genuine love within it
[1:47:54] he can do Miracles he can do signs he
[1:47:57] can speak in tongue and do all of those
[1:47:59] things and those things are wonderful
[1:48:01] but what you need to do is to understand
[1:48:03] what is the motive behind those things
[1:48:09] oh my that's the kind of love I want to
[1:48:11] have but why not says give me a church
[1:48:14] that doesn't know anything that doesn't
[1:48:16] have anything but as long as they have
[1:48:18] love within their heart
[1:48:21] why because love will build all the
[1:48:24] other things out love will bring
[1:48:26] kindness love will help the others love
[1:48:29] will heal love will deliver love will
[1:48:33] bring all of those things it's not about
[1:48:35] heaven or things it's about having love
[1:48:37] because all those things can be brought
[1:48:39] forth by love
[1:48:44] in Hebrews he says Paul said I could
[1:48:48] speak in tongues of men and Angel both
[1:48:51] thanks both things that that is
[1:48:54] understood and tongues that cannot be
[1:48:55] understood and has to be interpreted it
[1:48:59] says I'm nothing
[1:49:00] I have the if I have the gift of
[1:49:02] knowledge and understand our wisdom and
[1:49:04] explain the Bible
[1:49:07] let me slow down a little bit for The
[1:49:08] Interpreter sorry
[1:49:10] I was thinking that this morning and
[1:49:11] then I came I just took off sorry it
[1:49:14] says I am nothing
[1:49:16] he says that don't be that don't do much
[1:49:19] good to go to school then does it
[1:49:23] it says and learn the Bible he says
[1:49:27] though I have faith I can move Mountain
[1:49:30] healing campaigns don't mean much does
[1:49:34] it nothing though I give my body to be
[1:49:37] burned as sacrifice this is the prophet
[1:49:40] repeating the Scripture it says oh I say
[1:49:43] I say that man is religious but it's
[1:49:46] nothing Paul says whatever when it never
[1:49:49] become nothing it says for where they
[1:49:52] stung they see they they shall cease
[1:49:54] where there's prophecies they shall fail
[1:49:56] where there is other things they say
[1:49:59] things will fail but but that which
[1:50:02] program says this but when that which is
[1:50:06] perfect is come I like this so he takes
[1:50:09] one scripture he jumps you right away
[1:50:12] into another scripture he says when that
[1:50:15] which is perfect has come that which is
[1:50:19] in part shall be done away with now
[1:50:22] remember the age of the Capstone so
[1:50:25] we're here then one that is perfect has
[1:50:28] come it doesn't mean do away rejected
[1:50:30] but swallowed up into the hole by listen
[1:50:33] to what he says that which is perfect he
[1:50:36] says what is perfect love
[1:50:40] what is love God
[1:50:43] let us laid all this little dead works
[1:50:47] and ordinance and go on to Perfection
[1:50:50] let us move into the greater love of God
[1:50:53] let us move I'll tell you this you can
[1:50:55] do more with love that you can do with
[1:50:57] anything
[1:50:59] what Abraham says that one place love is
[1:51:02] the greatest weapon that we ever have it
[1:51:05] says what this world needs today is love
[1:51:08] oh my you know we hear this morning and
[1:51:12] and gather up in the house of God and
[1:51:14] and no doubt if he has a pastor give a
[1:51:17] report we need this we need that or if
[1:51:19] love could just raise within our heart
[1:51:21] all these things are nothing because why
[1:51:24] love is the greatest weapon Love Will
[1:51:27] Make A Way love will come this morning
[1:51:29] and touch somebody's heart and love will
[1:51:32] come and provide it I'll tell you this
[1:51:34] if you love somebody it will show
[1:51:40] if you love somebody it will show if you
[1:51:43] love somebody love will affect that
[1:51:46] person but when I will come so many
[1:51:48] times in so many meetings he said or I
[1:51:50] look at the person they don't have shoes
[1:51:52] and they don't have anything and it says
[1:51:54] oh look at him and I'll put my foot next
[1:51:56] to minor will my shoes feed him and well
[1:51:58] what is that love at work it's love what
[1:52:02] can happen it's love trying to find a
[1:52:04] way for that person and you will look
[1:52:06] and he will look and and after a while
[1:52:08] love will come in his heart and he will
[1:52:10] speak the word and God will come in the
[1:52:12] same
[1:52:17] oh my
[1:52:20] it says
[1:52:22] you see
[1:52:23] we are perfect through Christ
[1:52:26] how do we get in
[1:52:28] by Holy Spirit baptism
[1:52:31] it says
[1:52:32] all right
[1:52:34] what happened you've passed some dead
[1:52:36] death unto life
[1:52:38] well I shake I jumped I jumped to I
[1:52:41] jumped and do it then it says
[1:52:44] you don't have to do nothing
[1:52:47] I I like the piece that comes with love
[1:52:51] I like the calmness that comes with love
[1:52:55] but but Brennan will talk about
[1:52:57] we we call them
[1:52:59] and I'll just jump through the end now
[1:53:01] we talk about the
[1:53:03] manifestation of the third pool
[1:53:06] but one of them talks about the killable
[1:53:09] he said I I all of a sudden I jump in
[1:53:11] and I I didn't remember and they said
[1:53:13] about I jumped in and I was about to
[1:53:15] cross it says there was a man killed
[1:53:17] just the other day
[1:53:19] he jumped in and he says and he saw the
[1:53:21] bull he said I tried to reach for my gun
[1:53:23] I didn't have it
[1:53:25] it says thank God I didn't have it
[1:53:29] you see what the love of man will do to
[1:53:31] you it would rush to some judgment it
[1:53:33] will try to get to some solution real
[1:53:35] quick and everything but then when he
[1:53:37] realized he didn't have it he only used
[1:53:40] the only thing he left he said I stood
[1:53:42] there I said I don't want to die a
[1:53:44] coward I'll just face him and wait and
[1:53:47] everything and then he said but all of a
[1:53:49] sudden I didn't fear no more all of a
[1:53:53] sudden perfect love kicked in and he
[1:53:55] said he began to speak within his own
[1:53:57] heart perhaps I was not supposed to come
[1:53:58] and disturb you and and all those things
[1:54:01] and all those things and he said he came
[1:54:03] and he began to camera and he had no
[1:54:05] fear and about five feet he stopped
[1:54:08] What stopped him it was love within the
[1:54:11] heart it wasn't some power he didn't go
[1:54:14] up and scream and say you ball you are
[1:54:16] an animal I'm supposed to have power
[1:54:18] over you and all those things no he had
[1:54:20] compassion for that bull he understand
[1:54:22] that he was the one who was in the wrong
[1:54:24] that he was perhaps not supposed to be
[1:54:27] there he understood that I am the one
[1:54:29] that is supposed to be the master but
[1:54:31] guess what we do we put the blame on
[1:54:33] somebody else oh it's his fault it's not
[1:54:36] one fault he is the one who started it
[1:54:38] that's why I did too and he's the one
[1:54:40] that's not love
[1:54:42] that's not love that's not going to get
[1:54:44] you anywhere What You Need Is God to
[1:54:46] wash your heart and to fill you with the
[1:54:49] love of God oh so many times I
[1:54:51] understood why brother Barnum will say
[1:54:53] oh that evil get there at the end
[1:54:57] and you will look at me and you will
[1:54:59] kick me to hell I'll still love him
[1:55:04] after I've done all of this and I get
[1:55:06] there and he looks at me and he kicks me
[1:55:08] to hell I'll still worship Him
[1:55:12] because there was nothing left but the
[1:55:14] love of God within the heart and I want
[1:55:16] to say this we can do more with the love
[1:55:18] of God that we can do with anything else
[1:55:22] but a bill and Paul stood here many
[1:55:24] times they will tell us how but you
[1:55:27] couldn't tell the difference between an
[1:55:29] enemy and a friend
[1:55:31] he treated everybody the same
[1:55:34] why because if we if we're willing to be
[1:55:37] the students of this message let's just
[1:55:39] not run with the scriptures and the word
[1:55:42] and the quotes and everything let's not
[1:55:44] forget to take love with us so we can
[1:55:47] because because it's love that brought
[1:55:49] all those things into existence it's the
[1:55:51] love that brought all those mystery to
[1:55:53] come to pass if we have the same love
[1:55:55] God will bring about the same
[1:55:57] manifestation
[1:56:01] but if I'm going to say one place
[1:56:03] like I said I won't be able to finish
[1:56:06] it says
[1:56:08] he says one place he says
[1:56:12] what the church has forgotten
[1:56:15] is love
[1:56:19] is love
[1:56:21] he says you had said
[1:56:24] because say
[1:56:28] love one another he says
[1:56:32] now everybody wants to be loved
[1:56:36] and I tell you the truth I do
[1:56:39] I want God to love me I want the people
[1:56:42] to love me
[1:56:43] that's exactly the truth
[1:56:45] and if God loves me then the people will
[1:56:49] love me
[1:56:50] and if I love his people
[1:56:54] then he will love me for doing it
[1:56:57] now I want you to understand what he's
[1:56:59] tying it all together I like how he does
[1:57:02] that
[1:57:03] he says
[1:57:05] God would rather you love
[1:57:10] would rather you love
[1:57:13] you love than love him
[1:57:18] did you know that
[1:57:20] I would write a you love my boy and now
[1:57:23] he's saying that to say God whether you
[1:57:27] love one another then love him
[1:57:30] it says did you know our director you
[1:57:32] love my boy back here
[1:57:34] no matter what you say about me
[1:57:38] I want you to love my children
[1:57:41] and any father would think that
[1:57:44] so God so father God think the same
[1:57:47] thing for he said in so much as you have
[1:57:52] done unto this little the least of this
[1:57:55] my my little ones you have done it unto
[1:57:59] me
[1:58:00] so if you want to love God
[1:58:03] just start loving all his children
[1:58:12] you need to say the guy that you go on
[1:58:14] the closet and lift your hands and
[1:58:16] worship and all of that
[1:58:18] yeah he says
[1:58:19] you want to love me
[1:58:22] love my children
[1:58:25] love the person that's sitting next to
[1:58:27] you
[1:58:27] and it didn't just stop about this
[1:58:30] church love is children everywhere
[1:58:33] love them manifest that Same Love
[1:58:36] and then he says this and God will
[1:58:39] reward you
[1:58:40] if you will just love his children that
[1:58:44] shows that you love God that the love of
[1:58:48] God is in you
[1:58:52] now that brings sin down home
[1:58:55] you know because often time when we look
[1:58:58] at the human love
[1:59:01] the love is attached to
[1:59:04] oh you know who is it that it's in the
[1:59:07] same Circle as I am and
[1:59:09] you know love one that you know you
[1:59:11] think you can get along with
[1:59:13] you know love those that dress like you
[1:59:16] dress and those that speak like you
[1:59:18] speak and those that seem to be in the
[1:59:21] same social class that you are those
[1:59:24] that you know that seem to understand
[1:59:25] you the most
[1:59:28] that's not what he said
[1:59:34] you know it's the human love that always
[1:59:36] gets us in trouble
[1:59:40] because he says that's the kind of love
[1:59:42] that if someone would mess with your
[1:59:44] wife you would want to kill him
[1:59:47] but he said by the agape love will cause
[1:59:49] you to pray for that person
[1:59:52] that the Lord May save him
[1:59:56] so therefore it's important we
[1:59:57] understand we don't get this love
[2:00:00] by just reading on or doing this we we
[2:00:03] have to come in contact with this Jesus
[2:00:05] the one who so loved the world and and
[2:00:09] and when you come in contact with him he
[2:00:11] augments because remember this this uh a
[2:00:14] statue of a perfect man is the building
[2:00:16] forth of the foundation they there's not
[2:00:20] a step where you have to go without love
[2:00:22] everything has to be by love every stone
[2:00:25] that has to be and then he is the
[2:00:27] capping of the storm that comes upon it
[2:00:29] to confirm the very Foundation law that
[2:00:32] was established
[2:00:35] but what I'm saying is that oh man
[2:00:38] will know that you are my disciple
[2:00:40] when you've got love one for another
[2:00:43] the world is so thirsty that of that for
[2:00:46] that friends and God is love and still
[2:00:50] we can get brotherly love it says we'll
[2:00:53] never get very far from God we need a
[2:00:58] Revival of Love among God's children
[2:01:03] now
[2:01:05] there's one place and perhaps I won't
[2:01:07] have time to get there
[2:01:10] what what I'm well speaking it says
[2:01:13] that yeah we are we can come and we can
[2:01:16] do Mighty things and we can do all of
[2:01:18] that but he says but if it's not done in
[2:01:21] love it's of not
[2:01:24] so I want you to just picture that for a
[2:01:26] moment this morning you will sit here
[2:01:28] and the preacher will come and you will
[2:01:30] preach and everything in the service
[2:01:31] will go on with the songs and everything
[2:01:33] but he says that if you do all of that
[2:01:36] and you don't do it by love it means
[2:01:38] nothing
[2:01:40] in other words it will not produce
[2:01:43] something that's worthwhile it will not
[2:01:46] be it will not produce something that
[2:01:48] will stay on the Firm Foundation it will
[2:01:51] produce something that would fade away
[2:01:54] it's either done by Pride or because I
[2:01:57] want people to see how I could speak or
[2:01:59] how I could present it so that or that
[2:02:01] but it says the foundation has to be
[2:02:03] loved
[2:02:05] it said somebody told me not long ago
[2:02:07] but right now it says you know what
[2:02:09] happened it says this great organization
[2:02:12] is is this great organization I was
[2:02:15] talking about it says they always
[2:02:17] sponsor you you know what they did they
[2:02:21] ousted you
[2:02:23] then they he says they want nothing to
[2:02:26] do with you no more
[2:02:28] I said
[2:02:29] they drove down their stake and said
[2:02:32] nobody received brother Branham anymore
[2:02:34] this is 19 and 61 in the message the
[2:02:36] Queen of Sheba now he says I said well
[2:02:40] I drove mine down
[2:02:42] and I went and it says and away I went
[2:02:45] past I went I went way past them and I
[2:02:48] took them in
[2:02:50] it says they just they says they just
[2:02:53] all of it that's all it says I take my
[2:02:56] name because listen to this because a
[2:03:00] lot of God's children are in there
[2:03:05] there's a lot of God's children in there
[2:03:08] now I I I want you to see the approach
[2:03:11] because this is the man who was invited
[2:03:14] to a meeting and he's getting ready to
[2:03:16] come up on the platform and the person
[2:03:18] comes say oh but my name was called away
[2:03:20] and he's not able to come and preach
[2:03:26] when I I will
[2:03:30] I will let me just stop there you can
[2:03:32] add your own imagination to it
[2:03:37] now I I want you to see how far this
[2:03:40] love goes because I said it's a love you
[2:03:43] can't explain it you can't understand it
[2:03:45] you can put it together it's
[2:03:48] unfathomable it's the it's the unending
[2:03:51] love the only way you know it is to come
[2:03:54] in contact with it
[2:03:56] yeah there he is and and it will stand
[2:03:58] there and say oh no brother I don't want
[2:04:00] to kill the brother's reputation and you
[2:04:02] know you know God put him there and I
[2:04:04] don't want nothing to do and he walks
[2:04:06] away this is a man this is a man who
[2:04:09] would come at the border they will ask
[2:04:10] him do you have such a such no he drives
[2:04:12] away and drives back miles and miles
[2:04:15] away to come and make it right
[2:04:19] now I'm not talking about William Bryant
[2:04:22] the prophet I'm talking about William
[2:04:24] Brennan the man because if love is not
[2:04:27] in there we it's the work is in vain if
[2:04:31] the the love the the love of God is not
[2:04:34] in there it would not produce anything
[2:04:36] this is the man that comes and he and
[2:04:40] he's mowing his yard and then and he
[2:04:42] comes and he's he doesn't have a shirt
[2:04:44] on and he comes and there's a there's a
[2:04:46] harness a place and he comes in by
[2:04:49] accident it touches it and they come off
[2:04:51] swarming and everything and he comes and
[2:04:53] he apologized to them
[2:04:55] he said oh I I didn't mean to disturb
[2:04:59] you
[2:05:00] I am so sorry I I did this I didn't
[2:05:03] really mean to do this I apologize
[2:05:07] now some of the things they have to sing
[2:05:10] can because we hear we read the word of
[2:05:12] God and we go out to oh I want to
[2:05:14] conquer the world I want to do this but
[2:05:16] you have to understand what love are you
[2:05:18] going with is it just your human
[2:05:20] understanding or are you uh standing
[2:05:23] there and say Lord I I want to be filled
[2:05:26] so much with love that even if I'll go
[2:05:29] something happening that it's not being
[2:05:31] me reacting to the situation it will not
[2:05:34] be or myself coming on the surface and
[2:05:37] trying to defend myself that it will be
[2:05:39] the love of God that will come on the
[2:05:41] scene that's why I say this morning love
[2:05:43] will build the bridges where there's no
[2:05:45] Bridge love will change your
[2:05:47] circumstance this morning Lord the love
[2:05:50] will make a way where there's no way
[2:05:52] Love Will Repair what's broken love will
[2:05:55] bring back the the Perfection of God
[2:05:58] into his church
[2:06:01] oh my
[2:06:03] oh my
[2:06:05] God what about I'm gonna say
[2:06:08] it says and I say this tonight as a
[2:06:10] minister of the Gospel we've seen it
[2:06:13] tight it said and I had a little
[2:06:15] privilege to preach around the world
[2:06:16] before ten thousands of people and and
[2:06:19] it says and and and every Divine promise
[2:06:23] in the Bible is true it says if you'll
[2:06:25] take the right man to Latitude towards
[2:06:27] God any Divine promise you will bring it
[2:06:30] upon to come to pass if you can take the
[2:06:32] right mental attitude but listen to this
[2:06:34] it says and in it says and in our
[2:06:37] scripture reading tonight God so loved
[2:06:40] the world is there it says is there
[2:06:43] anything that if there's anything that
[2:06:46] the world is dying for today
[2:06:49] is love
[2:06:51] it says in my travel I found out
[2:06:54] that is the rejected Stone
[2:06:58] the rejected Stone
[2:07:00] that keeps the building
[2:07:02] from being fitted together
[2:07:09] the rejected Stone
[2:07:12] that keeps the building
[2:07:15] from being built fitted together
[2:07:20] it says another place it says
[2:07:23] we need love
[2:07:25] God so loved the world that he gave you
[2:07:27] for only beguns and Son now he projected
[2:07:30] love when love is projected what is love
[2:07:33] projected in other words what is it that
[2:07:35] you're projecting
[2:07:38] When Love is projected when love goes
[2:07:41] out when the heart that's going out is
[2:07:43] the heart of God When Love is being
[2:07:45] projected it says
[2:07:48] it comes down to the end
[2:07:51] Sovereign Grace
[2:07:52] produces what love projected oh I love
[2:07:56] that there's no better English word you
[2:07:58] can put it and I remember Brother David
[2:08:01] preached this long ago a while back a
[2:08:03] couple of months a year or so I go away
[2:08:06] talks about Grace he says Grace is when
[2:08:09] the decision is already made and the
[2:08:13] judgment is already about to be
[2:08:14] pronounced and you've done and you
[2:08:16] deserve the judgment and then in
[2:08:18] executive order comes from the turn of
[2:08:21] God it says I will change it what
[2:08:24] changes that is Grace that's been
[2:08:26] projected it's love that's been
[2:08:28] projected When Love is projected Grace
[2:08:31] steps in to make a way and brother says
[2:08:34] that's how we got Jesus
[2:08:38] that's how we got Jesus if you ever know
[2:08:41] how did you get Jesus how did Jesus come
[2:08:44] to the world why did he come to the
[2:08:46] world it was love that was projected and
[2:08:49] When Love Was projected Grace created
[2:08:51] something and Jesus came on the same
[2:08:55] oh my the prophet said I used to think
[2:08:57] that God hated me and that Jesus loved
[2:09:00] me and then later on I find out that
[2:09:02] Jesus was the very heart of God
[2:09:06] my brother my sister let's not forget it
[2:09:09] this morning in love that drives
[2:09:11] everything it's love that brought you
[2:09:13] here this morning it's the love of God
[2:09:15] that you will get you to the Finish Line
[2:09:17] it's the love of God without it we
[2:09:19] cannot do nothing
[2:09:21] God bless you let's all stand this
[2:09:23] morning
[2:09:25] foreign
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:31] I don't know about you but I want my
[2:09:33] love to be kept this morning I feel like
[2:09:36] I just needed a little more this morning
[2:09:38] I feel like I just need another
[2:09:40] injection of love another major just
[2:09:43] measure of love and that I can love my
[2:09:46] neighbor as myself that I could do the
[2:09:48] work of God that he would want me to do
[2:09:50] that we could all walk together within
[2:09:53] our love oh I tell you this love that's
[2:09:56] why it says love covers a multitude of
[2:09:58] sin
[2:10:01] them if you see love
[2:10:04] you don't see any mistakes all you see
[2:10:07] is opportunity for improvement
[2:10:10] I I I read this someone said
[2:10:13] stay away from negative people
[2:10:16] because they always find a problem for
[2:10:18] every solution
[2:10:24] stay away from negative people because
[2:10:27] they always find a problem for every
[2:10:29] solution we can do this oh no
[2:10:32] that's not gonna work because of this
[2:10:34] because of this we can no no no no no I
[2:10:38] don't want to be that kind of person I
[2:10:39] want to come to the Church of God with
[2:10:41] positivity in my heart I want to come
[2:10:44] knowing that the Lord will speak to me I
[2:10:46] want to know I'm part of something that
[2:10:48] God is building I want to know I'm part
[2:10:50] of the love of God that he's here
[2:10:51] bringing us together to fulfill the end
[2:10:54] time word to fulfill the end time
[2:10:56] prophecy I'm here to know that God is
[2:10:59] keeping us with his love that we can
[2:11:01] function by love we can save my love we
[2:11:04] can heal by love and not because we have
[2:11:08] a point to prove we have no point to
[2:11:10] prove
[2:11:11] he's already proved everything
[2:11:14] we just hear about the love
[2:11:17] like that man who came to tempt him on
[2:11:19] the platform
[2:11:21] but one of them said
[2:11:23] I this this is shocking
[2:11:25] he said I understood the man
[2:11:28] it's just a man like me he wants to eat
[2:11:30] and drink he probably have a family
[2:11:34] how do you do that
[2:11:36] a man who came to cause all kind of
[2:11:38] chaos and everything well aren't you
[2:11:40] gonna cut him out in the name of Jesus
[2:11:43] send him to hell right away no
[2:11:47] that's what love will do to you
[2:11:49] I don't know about you I want to be a
[2:11:51] love slave one who's driven by the love
[2:11:54] of God within the heart and he looks at
[2:11:57] a man and he says you challenge the Holy
[2:12:00] Ghost he said I Heard a Voice just came
[2:12:01] out of me
[2:12:03] he said I didn't fear him even though he
[2:12:05] could just take me and break me into
[2:12:07] pieces
[2:12:09] I just looked at him and I felt sorry
[2:12:11] for him
[2:12:13] it says you challenged the Holy Ghost
[2:12:14] she'll be at my feet
[2:12:17] I I feel like we have to get to a place
[2:12:20] where we understand we have nothing to
[2:12:23] prove we have to stand if he said it
[2:12:27] just stand there your mind is gonna rise
[2:12:29] against you how about this you know what
[2:12:31] I don't have nothing above I'm just
[2:12:32] doing his will I'm just if if he blessed
[2:12:35] me here he'll provide for it

[2:12:40] him whatever the need is he's here if he
[2:12:42] bless you he'll he'll provide for us

[2:16:43] last verse
[2:16:48] why should I gain
[2:16:50] from his reward
[2:16:53] I cannot give an answer
[2:16:57] but this I know
[2:17:00] with all my heart
[2:17:02] his wounds
[2:17:05] have paid my Ransom
[2:17:10] that's when you know the love of God
[2:17:15] no matter what our
[2:17:17] faults are failures
[2:17:20] well we were yet a sinner
[2:17:22] is when he died for us
[2:17:26] that's the love he has no wonder he says
[2:17:29] he says you have freely
[2:17:32] been given to you
[2:17:34] freely give
[2:17:38] certainly
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:41] He Who
[2:17:44] has forgiven been forgiven much loves
[2:17:47] much
[2:17:49] I think that's just a beautiful
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:55] understanding that
[2:17:58] God so loved the world he gave his only
[2:18:00] begotten son
[2:18:03] it's always a reminder to us bring it
[2:18:05] back to Calvary yes
[2:18:08] [Music]
[2:18:09] that's God's provided place of worship
[2:18:12] there's only one place you can worship
[2:18:14] Him
[2:18:15] that's under the shed blood
[2:18:18] in other words under the projection of
[2:18:21] the love that he had for you
[2:18:23] it's the only place you can worship
[2:18:28] gifts power all those things we'll do
[2:18:32] be Lord
[2:18:33] so desires us do but let us move on to
[2:18:36] perfection
[2:18:38] I believe that with all my heart that's
[2:18:40] what I want I feel in my heart a lot of
[2:18:43] times that
[2:18:46] I remember many times I've heard this
[2:18:48] statement
[2:18:49] that it hurts me more than it hurts you
[2:18:56] Love's corrective
[2:19:00] but if you have love
[2:19:02] it pains the corrector
[2:19:06] just as much as it pains
[2:19:10] the one corrected
[2:19:15] but it's not Peaceable at the time
[2:19:20] but it brings forth rich
[2:19:22] peace
[2:19:23] amen let's have that one for another
[2:19:27] let's have it for Sinners that would
[2:19:29] come through the door
[2:19:31] no matter who it is
[2:19:34] if you look at yourself you were
[2:19:35] unlovable
[2:19:37] but he loved you
[2:19:39] amen let's I think it's a lovely lovely
[2:19:43] remembrance of why that we're here
[2:19:47] in fact the very Foundation is the very
[2:19:50] Capstone because the stone that was
[2:19:53] rejected is the one that capped it all
[2:19:55] off amen let's close in prayer
[2:20:01] Our Father
[2:20:05] you understand the morning you
[2:20:07] understand why it was the time the
[2:20:11] length everything about it
[2:20:14] you have a purpose in all things you do
[2:20:17] father
[2:20:19] because you love us
[2:20:24] Your Love causes us to
[2:20:28] be chastised
[2:20:30] but that same love causes forgiveness
[2:20:34] that same love causes healing
[2:20:38] that same love throws our failures in
[2:20:41] the sea of
[2:20:43] your forgetfulness
[2:20:46] that you could remember him no more
[2:20:50] Lord to me that's amazing
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:20:57] lordy you could just totally
[2:21:02] wipe the Slate clean
[2:21:07] father May that love reach out and tart
[2:21:09] each heart in here this morning
[2:21:13] that they could know from this moment
[2:21:17] now
[2:21:20] that your love's here to wipe their
[2:21:22] slate clean
[2:21:25] to throw yesterday this morning
[2:21:30] in the sea of your forgetfulness
[2:21:34] and that if they would receive that love
[2:21:37] in their heart and they'd accept that
[2:21:39] pardon
[2:21:42] and they wouldn't even hold it
[2:21:44] accountable against themselves because
[2:21:48] you don't hold it accountable against
[2:21:50] them Lord
[2:21:52] and they could walk in that love
[2:21:55] and then show that same love that you
[2:21:58] had to them to others
[2:22:01] oh the joy Bells would be ringing as our
[2:22:04] brother told us
[2:22:05] our hearts would be aflame
[2:22:09] because of the peace that passes
[2:22:12] understanding
[2:22:14] Lord May every heart in here
[2:22:17] know this morning that there's hope
[2:22:21] regardless of
[2:22:23] the burden
[2:22:25] regardless of the mental strain the
[2:22:28] regardless of the problem
[2:22:31] the past does not hold the future when
[2:22:35] love is injected
[2:22:37] oh thank you Father for setting us free
[2:22:40] we ask you to bless us
[2:22:44] father for those that
[2:22:49] need you may they always know your
