Description:
Power of Obedience : Authority Under Headship
Br. Randy Vertin
Wednesday Evening Service: October 6, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

on my heart right before we came out of uh my god is real how many know my god is real amen how do we know he's real because he lives in my soul amen amen i'm a witness in order to be a witness you have to have a personal experience how many are a witness of the power of jesus christ to change a life amen there are some feelings i may not know there are some places that i cannot go [Music] oh there's just one thing oh that i'm sure off oh my god is real for i can feel him in my soul my god is real before he has washed and made me hold his love for me my god is real before i can feel him in my soul [Music] oh i cannot tell oh just how it felt [Music] oh when jesus washed all my sins away oh but ever since that day oh ever since then oh my god is real before i can feel his mighty power oh don't you know god is real oh he's real in my soul oh my god is real before he has washed and made me whole [Music] oh my god is real before i can feel him in my soul amen praise the lord amen i'm a witness that god is real [Applause] i think we all have a testimony that at certain times in our lives we tried so many other things tried to figure things out on our own but one day god came along and the holy ghost came along and gave you a revelation gave you a rock to stand on that all the devils in hell can't move you from you know once you've seen something once you've truly seen something there's no devil in hell can convince you that there's anything different from what you've received this jesus said paul i believe it was paul he said he said what do you have that you did not receive well i've received something i've received a revelation i've received the baptism of the holy ghost i've received a life that is being expressed in this mortal flesh we've heard from the from the uh ministry here over the last month month and a half how that holy ghost will come down and even bring your mortal flesh into subjection to the word of god i'm a witness of that and it's when you least expect it so many times you struggle and you fight and you're trying by your own power and then as soon as you finally give up and say lord i just can't do it he says i know i've been waiting for you to come to that revelation for a long time and then he brings you up a little bit higher amen he said if you'll humble yourself you'll be exalted in due time in his time i believe the heart of every believer here is lord we want to be exalted with you not not in a fleshly way but we want to exalt the name of the lord jesus but there's what we you know he wants us to be humble before him he's got a you know the scripture says that jesus and i'm kind of getting ahead of myself but the scripture says that jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered amen and sometimes we suffer way longer than we need to because we just haven't come to that place of obedience yet a full heart heart felt obedience amen so let's just turn into the word this evening to a couple scriptures here i'm really excited of what the lord jesus is doing because i it's near the rapture is near even at the door we know it's happening even all around us as we speak but i feel like the you know the the the consummation of all things the the the manifestation of the rapture and our mortal flesh of being changed in the moment of twinkling and eye is just so close at hand that if i could say it this way i could i feel like i can almost taste it you know i it's just seeing the condition of the world and then seeing what the lord's doing i can only speak for myself but i believe for other ones that have this testimony of what he's doing in the hearts of the believers there's a desperation and a hatred for this world not for the people so to speak but for the systems for the the the world order the cosmos that we've heard it called and it's just nothing but wickedness the scripture says about the days of noah's at the imagination of man's heart with nothing but wicked continually and we're a test if we could testify to that like i said this where we're kind of going old school tonight with the microphone i'm not used to maybe holding holding this but you just bear with me we're going to turn to a couple scriptures here second timothy chapter 3. and then from there if you want to have it ready we're going to go we'll get there by god's grace from there we're going to go to romans 6. how many beloved lord jesus the lord is bringing his bride into a perfect unity with him she's not going to be united with anything else but the word the perfect entire word she'll be she'll be unified to she can't unify with anything else forgive me i think my pages are kind of sticking here second timothy chapter 3 and we'll read just the first few verses here and we'll read verses one through five this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and then we're going to go to the book of romans chapter 6. just to kind of give a title and maybe kind of a subtitle the title i guess would be the power of obedience and then for a subtitle this would kind of be more i guess the general theme of what the lord has just been really pressing on my heart is authority under headship in uh romans chapter 6 verses uh 16 through 18. and we'll get we can start at verse 15. he said what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants er to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father as we've just read your word lord lord we could say thousands of words in the flesh but lord just one word from you by your spirit lord god would be more to us than anything that we could receive of a man lord this evening father we just surrender ourselves to you father that the holy ghost may have preeminence lord preeminence in your people lord preeminence to make yourself known father we just pray right now that you'd be with us this evening bless your word and bless the hearers lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated and we're going to just turn to one more scripture here as you're seated first samuel chapter 13. you know we're living in an age i would say of absolute rebellion you know and we see it everywhere but i i feel you know it we kind of see it most especially uh i feel like in the united states you know the you know the united states was born on rebellion rebelling against the king and all these things and we understand about laodicea that nature of laodicea and people's rights and you know and i've really had that on my heart so much lately and i know i preached it probably ad nauseam maybe tired of hearing it but that lamb nature that god is requiring of his people lays down its rights and you know whether that be to natural authority you know the scripture says that those that are not under the holy ghost they speak evil of dignities they they reject authority over them which the scripture says that whether we want to believe it or not the lord has set those things up for a purpose you know and we understand that we obey obey these things as far as the word will allow but there's such a there's such a spirit of rebellion but we find that even the lord jesus when he came on the scene the scripture says as a lamb was dumb before the sheer shearer so opened he not his mouth and don't we so many times in our flesh i just speak for myself i don't speak for anybody else but the nature at least of my flesh is you always want to have that last word you know i always got in trouble for that growing up was you get into an argument with the parents or something and you felt like you just had them right where you wanted them but then they pulled the parrot card and say you know what we're just going to stop this right here you go to your room or do whatever and then on the way out you just had to say one last thing to get in that's what my parents always told me they said you always got to have the last word and so many times in our flesh we don't realize that that's the spirit of balaam you know we even heard of it this sunday talking about that organizational spirit and see the lord will not be confined by man's ideas the holy ghost will not be caged in by traditions by doctrines that a pet doctrine that you hold whether it be in the word or not because we find that as it was when the lord jesus came on the scene when the pharisees and sadducees who had more of a claim to the word of god than anybody else they said we have moses we have the prophets we have the word in so much that we know the word we can tell you the word front to back up down left right forwards backwards upside down everything you could think of they knew the word in a carnal fashion but we find out that the lord jesus said you're just white and sepulchers having a form of godliness but you deny the transforming power of god to take your life and conform it to transform it what does the scripture say to be conformed not to the image of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind into the image of the lord jesus christ and we know the lord jesus is nothing else but the word so it's not about conforming to what we'd call quote message doctrine because we've come to we if we're not careful we'll get caught into a pharisee's spirit where as long as we're coming into subjection with a church creed as long as we call it message it'll be okay but see the message is none other than christ revealed to the people and we had a prophet to come and not only show us in letter what that would be but to actually live it out before the people we were talking about that wave sheath if we understand what the wave sheath is we could take that life that was expressed through a prophet and showed that it wasn't a life of law as we so often like to do put us in a cage of well we must do this taste not you know touch not handle that all these things which those things are good touch not the unclean thing and i'll receive you but if your heart's not right see paul said in romans he said he said not that you've obeyed of a fashion because i told you but he said because you've obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine that was delivered unto you see we're talking about the power of obedience and that's where we want to kind of start so we find in first samuel chapter 13 we understand the story of saul saul the the way i think of saul saul is the embodiment of denomination because saul was the crux of a desire of man to have man headship over man and we see that's what the denominational spirit is brother branham talked about that nicolaitan spirit the deeds of the nicolaitans were what they started out by ranking one another oh you're this great preacher you're this great pastor you're this great brother you're this great believer what were they doing they're ranking one another paul said you compare one another to on another and you're comparing one with another he said that's not wise and there's been something on my heart so much lately is every time i see something about wisdom we start to realize there's a wise version and there's a foolish virgin so whenever i see something now and i see it's not wise i take special note to that i start to see lord am i doing one of these things am i comparing one to another trying to take one preacher over another one person over another one church over another one one thing over another what is it because it shows that there's something in you that's not fully obedient because it shows we see we're talking about all this comes under headship because whenever you start to rank men above man and put yourself under man you've eliminated the headship of the holy ghost for you that was the problem with the nicolaitan spirit was what was it conquered the laity it brought the laity into subjection not to the holy ghost but to a man-made priesthood again and that's why i so appreciate our pastor who can come up and say hey i'm going to preach but you take what i'm saying and bring it to the word bring it to the message and what let's search the thing out those of you might be like liked politics at one time remember what ronald reagan said he said trust but verify and that's what we do as christians because what did they do in ephesus they had a testimony that they hated the deeds of the nicolaitans and what did they do he said they tried those that said they were apostles and found out that they were liars why because what were they trying to do was subject men subject the people of god under a man-made headship and god will not accept it you could go back all the way to garden of eden cain wanted things his own way he became a god that's what our pastor even mentioned this sunday see we think of a denomination as a church group see we know better than that in the message that put a bishop a a state presbyter over the the message churches of texas we know better than that satan doesn't come that but what does he do he tries to make you a denomination unto yourself i'll believe my way and my way is better than everybody else's way oh why well i have and that's why even as a minister or especially probably even as a pastor it's so it's probably so difficult i'm not a pastor but as a pastor i can imagine it's so difficult because you want the people to follow you as you follow christ but there's such a fine line because if you go too far you set a person up as an idol and there will be nobody between jesus christ and his bride no pope no minister no pastor no bishop not even a prophet can be between christ and his bride it's got to be those two in a perfect unity but what happens is will be you'll become a denomination unto yourself and not know it because what happens is you cage the word of god by your own traditions well i've always done it this way well if your way's not in the word that doesn't mean it's wrong there's nothing wrong with having traditions and those in that sense there's nothing wrong but if you if you're not putting a comma at the end of your tradition and not allowing the spirit of god to move you when he desires to move you then you become a denomination unto yourself and god will not dwell with that he wants a bride that is totally submissive to his will and his will alone it's bride time i don't see that pridefully i say that isn't god is calling a people he's calling believers individually you can come to this church every single day every single service and still go to hell it doesn't matter if this church preaches the message it doesn't matter if this church preaches truth 365 days a year 24 7. if it's not accepted in your heart if you don't believe from the heart if you have not surrendered all that you are to him it will profit you nothing the pharisees were willing to sacrifice you don't think it was a sacrifice they had to live separate they didn't so much that if they touched an unclean thing or did a certain thing that could be stoned but they were willing to make that outward sacrifice not because they loved god but because they loved the praises of men that it afforded them and we've got to be so careful because that same spirit is moving within the message you say the message of course where else would it try to move and the worst thing is it's more subtle in this message than anywhere else because we've got so much truth because knowledge puffed up we've got all of it the mystery's revealed the word opened to us we could stand toe-to-toe with anybody by the revelation he's given and we can know that it's the truth but if we're not careful if we're not careful you'll go right on with it and you'll miss the whole thing because god is requiring truth on the inward parts it's not enough he wants obedience from the heart it's it's easy to come to a mental recognition of many things even in this message to a point you say how can that be true well you see we we've we've forgotten the scripture that says the the devils believe and they tremble that's not exclusive to everything except the message if anything the devils believe this message more than anything because they saw the proof of what this produces by a prophet ministry so they know what this message produces they believe it probably more than a lot of people but they cannot come into subjection to it just like cain who was off the wicked one why because he could not come into a heartfelt subjection to the word of god though it was plainly revealed to him made plain to him if thou do as well you'll be accepted and i will even exalt you above your brother because you were firstborn and he couldn't do it why because the seed wouldn't allow it but thank the lord we've obeyed from the heart we've obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine that was delivered to us but we understand saul was a embodiment of the denominational idea we want a man to go before us we don't want the whole the word remember a prophet in the in the scripture type is the word types the word we don't want the word to go before us but we want to have a man something we can see with our eyes something we can handle something carnal something that i can hold on to something that i can do something that we can accomplish that i say i had my hand in it but you see when it comes down to it if we can receive real grace it's when we realized that we had no part in it that it had nothing to do with us by the grace of god he dropped down because he knew in your heart that you would choose him and he came and for ordained you to live this word it didn't have anything to do with your ability in fact most of us are probably if you compared us to many denominations we're weaker carnally brother branham said in the church age book he said the false will outshine the true in works and zeal so you start looking on the outward remember he told samuel god doesn't look on the outward but he looks on the inward man so what happened to saul they bring him up there the lord tells them they haven't rejected you samuel they rejected me and that's what you do when you accept the denominational spirit when you accept a man to tell you what to do instead of the holy ghost instead of the word then you got to be real careful but first samuel 13 and 14 he said now we understand saul what did he do samuel tells him the word tells him terry here i will come at the appointed time and then we shall do our service unto the lord we'll offer the sacrifice but what do the denominations do that denominational spirit will always force thing i don't have the quotes with me right now because i didn't have those in this one but you can find it in place after place brother brown talks about what happens is they get ahead of the word they're not willing to wait on the word of god just like eve in the garden if she would have just waited for the word to be made manifested how does god make his word manifest by bringing it to pass if she would have waited she would have seen the glory of god and the word performed the way he desired it but because she got ahead of it she accepted if i could say a beast religion and that's what a denominational spirit is is a beast made religion why because all denominations are going to join back up with the beast they go right back to mama every single time that spirit will unite against the word you say that can't be true look at the days of jesus when he gave the very word made flesh came on the scene and there were pharisees and sadducees who were so proud that they were the separated people of jehovah but that denominational spirit that they held so hated the word that it joined with rome it joined with rome who is rome she joined with the beast and so much that pilate said don't you want your king even rome tried to give him the king the lord jesus and they saw that denominational spirit so anointed said we have no king but caesar we accept rome we'll take her away that's what they'll do every single time because they cannot subject themselves to the word they can't humble themselves because they got it all but they've denominated what do they do they caged their they've you've taken the traditions of man and you've made the word of god of none effect because you said we can only go this far that's it and then lord says well i'm going over here well i can't go there my creed won't let me my doctrine won't let me and then you're dead there's a reason why brother branham hammered denomination from beginning to end beginning to end over and over and over because it's a spirit that was started in heaven satan started the first denomination he said i will be like the most high there's a new revelation for you i'm gonna be like the most high and a third of the angels followed him there's your denominational spirit he brought that right down to eve didn't he said you'll be his gods you'll be like the most high knowing good and evil there's your denominational spirit again and it keeps going and it keeps going here goes saul remember saul he had the word the word told him to terry here terry here stay here until i come sounds a little bit like terry in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that's why stephen could say to those stiff-necked pharisees you always do resist the holy ghost who is the word you resist the word when the word comes to you you cannot accept it you'll go so far they'll be like a judas i'll walk with it for a while but when it comes down to lay it all down can't do it cain manifests himself that denominational nickelodeon spirit manifests itself he can't do it and so saul had it too he couldn't wait and he said first samuel 13 saw samuel tells him he says but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart see there it is after his own heart there's the difference saul looked great head and shoulders above every man saul had the anointing on him remember after samuel anointed saul he said this and this and this is going to happen and he goes down and the spirit falls upon him in so much he started prophesying with the prophets the scripture says there was a saying that went forth that said it's not saul among the prophets he was a pentecostal had the spirit anointing but he couldn't accept the word when the word told him what to do he couldn't do it the lord had sought of a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord hath com which the lord commanded thee oh my first samuel 15 22 samuel said samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord remember it doesn't matter how much you can do when the word comes to you you obey you fulfill the word of god you submit unto the headship of the word that's the spirit of the bride she submits now you can't do it yourself that's the whole point you say well i can't seem to get past this flesh well let the holy ghost take over your life one time and see if all those things just don't start dying away why because it's only by his spirit church age book we know the quote if we can recognize the two spirits in the framework of the church and by his spirit withstand the antichrist spirit by whose spirit his spirit by the holy ghost by the spirit of god that dwelleth in you if the same spirit that raised christ up from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal bodies so what will it do it will make you alive to the word dead to the world has the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices has been obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft listen how powerful this is rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry you say that's rough but you see it manifested because at the end of saul's life where did he go he went to the witch he went to the witchcraft who's the witch that's the catholic church there's the denomination joining with the catholic church because why he wanted to find the word and when he found samuel he brought him up samuel said the word's already gone i've moved on and he had to die see what that spirit that denominational spirit will get you that's why all of those the the daughters of the harlot mother of harlot they'll join right back with her because they're of the same spirit did not brother branham in his preview of the bride what did he see he saw that first bride going forth and then he sat there and watched all the different ones he said through the church ages coming through coming through until it got to the last one he said it was the most vilest disgusting looking thing he ever seen blind miserable wretched naked poor didn't know it right dancing to rock and roll if that's not a pentecostal spirit i don't know what is brother branham said in a couple of places he said at the pentecostal church where the last two thousand years it'll be far beyond what the catholic church is and i can testify to that having seen it at least catholic church if i could say anything about it at least it clings to what it had the pentecostal church since the lord called me out of it back in 2002 they have more tattoos than biker gang's got they do and they call it god and it's the devil but what was she doing she was dancing to that rock and roll that was that layout to see in church right but who was she led by she was led by the witch there's your two coming together again they'll always come together why because as the mother is so is the daughter but god's seeking someone after his own heart oh yeah you're gonna make mistakes david made mistakes but he was a man after god's own heart you're gonna make mistakes but you get down and make your calling and election sure you say lord burn every worldly lust out of me lord take every worldly desire out of me just baptize me with the holy ghost baptism after baptism after baptism boiling all the trash out that's the revival we're looking for it's to get us to a place of desperation to realize that our life that we're living is not up to the standard of the word the closer you get to him the more all the little things that you let go become worse in his sight when you start to see with his eyes you start to see just how if angels are filthy in his sight but praise be to god that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us beyond all of that thank you lord jesus that's where the salvation lies it that the blood of jesus christ collected you so far the angels are filthy in his sight but he looks at you and can't see nothing praise the lord so clean and spotless and virtuous because you obeyed from the heart because you're coming under headship we've got to come under complete headship to the word there's nothing else that it can be so i looked up the the meaning of the word obedience and there's a couple of things here it says compliance with an order request or law we understand that someone tells you to do something and you do it you've obeyed what they told you to do right that's really simple see god also requires that from us repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you repent you you obey from the heart this word and you do what is required of you amen not all that said unto me lord lord shall enter in but they that doeth the will of my father and the only thing that can do the will of the father is the holy ghost it's the holy ghost it's the only thing that can do it it's the word is the only thing that can fulfill the word is the word the ticket's got to match up that chinese laundry ticket's got to match up and it wanted to do it proved that they were the same substance to begin with what did we hear on wednesday that's the truth that you are the very feminine part of god made manifest in the flesh god separated you out of jesus on the cross he put the second adam to sleep just like the garden and while he was asleep he pulled you out so you could be manifest but praise be to god we're not gonna be like that first eve why because because unlike the first eve she was in the garden i've always wondered this and if you found quotes on it you let me know i've never been able to find it but i've always wondered where was adam when that serpent was coming walking around why she wasn't under she wasn't with the headship as far as i can tell i may be wrong but i tell you one thing it won't be so in this day because in this day there's a uniting time that's come where the bride and christ are one and they're gonna be so close together inseparable just like what they say the pyramid is so close you can't even fit a razor blade between the stones sealed in there with the cement that's lasted for six thousand years can't touch it and what is it we're lively stones fitted and joined together so tight and compacted together there's nothing can get between it and there is nothing going to separate what shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or famine or nakedness or peril or sword or all these things no no why because we've united with him at that day you shall know that i am in the father and the father is in me and i am in you so what is it they've become we've become so united with him and our minds are his minds his thoughts are our thoughts our desires is his desires so when that little devil comes sneaking around again in this day we're gonna stand with our husband on that word and say i don't think so devil you got her in the garden of eden you got her back in ephesus but you are not getting here on mount zion praise the lord why because he promised it he promised it he said he'll cut the work short in righteousness he's going to take us out of here he's going to seal us so full of his spirit so he can't get in there the only way he can get in is if you go out so stay in stay in every day be baptized with the spirit be dead to yourself be dead to your creeds be dead to your ideas be dead to your message dogmas it doesn't matter if it doesn't toad up to the word it doesn't matter there's a time where we're coming under headship you know obedience is a powerful thing when the lord gives something to do and you obey you find out that the lord comes on the scene and fulfills exactly what he said he would do you know we could take a lot of examples of that i'll just take a couple we know the story of jericho the lord tells joshua you're going to go around the city compass the city seven times and on the seventh day seven more times you're not going to speak you're going to blow a trumpet on the last time you're going to shout and blow the trumpet into the walls are going to come down was there any virtue in the marching was there any virtue in the trumpet sounding was there any virtue in the shouting when the wall came down no but the virtue came because of obedience to the word when you obey the word god comes on the scene and confirms it think about naaman remember name it he goes has leprosy and he wants to be cured he hears there's a prophet in israel and goes to the king and the king says what have you done to me i can't heal the man and they bring him to the prophet and he doesn't and the prophet doesn't even see god's not a respecter of persons because the prophet didn't even see name in face to face he sends out his servant he says i don't even need to see him the lord's already told me go tell him to dip seven times in jordan he'll be clean the scripture says that naaman was in a fury he was mad he was hot why because he had a denominational spirit he had in his mind already figured out how everything was going to go down why because he said it from his own mouth he said i thought surely that the man would come forth and strike his hand over the place or do such and such a thing and it took the servant to plead with him and he goes are not all these rivers even greater than the jordan they give me the muddy old jordan yeah death to self is an ugly thing dying to yourself is not enjoyable dying to yourself is not fun dying to yourself is something that takes you must die daily and believe you me this flesh doesn't like to die watch an animal when you go to kill it and watch how it struggles for life so is the flesh you get down to pray in the morning and all of a sudden your shopping list is in your mind what you got to do after work's on your mind you're sitting here in service right now wondering when brother's going to be done preaching because i'm hungry and my crockpot's going to boil over that's how the devil gets you the battle's up here brothers and sisters but if you can get beyond that then you can get down into your heart and you can say lord there has been something change in me that i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know why you even chose me i know i'm not worthy but there's something in my heart that can't be satisfied until i see jesus christ manifested in this body why because the scripture says as he is so are we in the world we heard our pastor mention it again on sunday why because any spirit that does not say jesus christ is come in the flesh we're not talking about a corporal body with pierced hands and feet that you can touch no he's talking about you if you can receive it he's talking about you and see so that's why i can tell you whenever that devil comes and say oh jesus christ doesn't live in you well then you automatically know that that's a devil spirit because it says whatever spirit does not confess that jesus christ has come into the flesh is not of god see how simple the word is but if but our minds our laodicean minds want to make everything complicated oh man we love complicated things my wife bought me this nice tablet right because i just something a little bit smaller but how to carry around like instead of a big laptop that i had but oh my goodness it's so complicated all the buttons and the touches and the gestures and the things that you can do and the 5 trillion font sizes and the different what is it it's overwhelming the people it's trying to take the minds of the people and so scramble them up in the mental in the spirit realm that you can never break past that to see him but if you could just simplify yourself be simple there there's no great ones among us if anybody thinks he's a great one well then serve the greatest among you would serve so you know what you know that's what that's humility that's humbleness because that haughty remember the scripture says that the daughters of zion would get haughty and we heard that in ii timothy there be heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god so are many of the so-called daughters of zion oh well i'm just i'm the bee's knees as they say i'm the cream of the crop i'm the bride but i tell you what the scripture says that they were called christians at antioch they didn't have to profess their christianity the very life that lived in them testified to who they were and brother branham even goes so far as to tell us a little parable of the slave that was brought in from another kingdom who had such a life and a revelation about his identity that's what that was about was identity who you are he had such an identity about him he didn't have to walk around say oh i'm the king of this tribe no he had such a life about him an atmosphere and an expression of life in him that the slave masters inquired about the past of this guy say what in the world is causing him to live that way that's the kind of life i wanted me that's the kind of life that is in me i just need to die more to let him manifest it more the only thing standing between you and god is you it's you dying my greatest opponent is me why well i said brother what about the devil the devil's already defeated he's already under my feet he's done the lord jesus conquered that now he wants to conquer you he wants you to be conquered he wants your ideas to be conquered he wants your ambitions to be conquered you don't think paul had a struggle knowing that he was in line to be head of the pharisees and then you know how many i guarantee the devil put it on there because he even paul had to bring it out he said i was a pharisee of pharisees i was at the stock of the tribe of benjamin circumcised the eighth day concerning the law blameless what was he showing he was showing he said i counted all dumb that i may win christ see moses could you imagine moses you know the lord gave me just this little tidbit thought you know and then carnal wouldn't it have made carnal sense for moses to have just sat there on the throne and then say i'll just wait for old man pharaoh to croak forgive me for being crude but i'll just wait for pharaoh to die and when i sin to the throne let my people go because they're now my people but see god loves a paradox he said i've taken the the foolish things of this world to confound the wise i've taken the base things of this world to exalt them to a higher place i've uh there's nothing of me i'm a fool there of myself i can't do anything jesus christ said without me ye can do nothing but with me you can do all things and then paul comes along and echoes the same thing he said i can do all things through christ for strengtheneth me has nothing to do with himself nothing to do with his abilities you think this is me speaking to you this isn't anything on my notes this is inspiration from the lord i'm not saying that to magnify myself the point is if you don't have a revelation of the word of god and how he moves you will become a denomination unto yourself because you'll look at the pastor or the preacher any anybody who would be up here that would be ministering to you and you'll judge them based on the vessel but you know paul said he said he said whether they preach of their own selfish reasons for their own gain or they preach out of pureness of heart he said at least the gospel's preached why because even our prophet taught us that even if it's in the handyard the hen house and eagle egg can hatch because it's about that atmosphere it's about the seed that went in so we judged so many things on the appearance so did samuel said don't look upon him because of his great stature and his great ability and his great build he's i almost think the lord might have told samuel didn't i teach you the first time with saul because what happened he brought up the sons of jesse and he saw the first one and the lord i did tell him again don't look on the stature of him carnally god judges the heart god's looking on the and that's what the world says right but they use it in a perverse way you bring the word to them you show them straight out of the word something as simple as baptism in the name of jesus christ they say oh well you know it doesn't really matter god knows my heart oh yeah he does and he knows that he don't care oh he absolutely knows your heart absolutely he knows your heart and he knows you don't care not you but you know what i'm talking about we're gonna close you i'm not even gonna get to where i was gonna go but we're gonna close here in just a minute so so i just read this a couple quotes here one from blind bartimaeus it's just kind of talking about that power of so we we kind of got off on naaman but naaman ran off in a fury and his servant had to tell him if he would have told you some great thing if he would have told you to backflip 15 times jump off a hundred foot cliff into a pool of water the size of a thimble you would have done it but he's simply telling you to do this and be clean and naaman came to his senses and he became clean but what was it it wasn't it wasn't the river that had the power it wasn't anything else but the obedience to the word and when you submit yourself to the word when you come under that headship that's where the power lays brother branham says in blind bottom master in 1954 he said just like the brass serpent why the serpent didn't have no virtue in it it was a piece of brass they brought up brought it up out of egypt neither did the pole have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what god said do what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of god and that's the same thing tonight really simple isn't it we're looking for these great things you say well i've obeyed the word of god okay then when you've done all you can do to stand stand that's where the devil gets us that's that denominational spirit that idea of i gotta keep pressing forward just for the sake of pressing forward no you move when the lord tells you to move that's where saul got into trouble you know saul what he said he said i feared when he tried to make an excuse to samuel you know what he said he said i feared that the people would scatter from me so i forced myself and he says because i obeyed i obeyed not the voice of god but he said i obeyed the voice of the people. so there's a there's remember there's multiple voices paul said there's many sounds there's many voices and there's none without significance what voice are we listening to remember elijah had a whirlwind and a fire and an earthquake but he was listening for a still small voice and when he recognized that he humbled himself to it and walk out but saul said i evade the voice of the people well we have a voice in our day you got a voice of the world that's calling you to do whatever you want to do and it's okay to do this or do that we see the world doing what they're doing but then there's there's a voice that's called to us in this day the voice of malachi 4 which is the voice of the word that came forth and told us to accept nothing else but the word because that's what eve did in the garden was she got away from it just by a little bit and look what happened saw one little bit and look what happened the kingdom was right from him and the lord had to say i'm gonna find me a man after my own heart and no matter what david did murderer adulterer all kinds of things that he did that was wrong and yet oh yeah but god saw his heart this time because he knew his heart was right his desire yeah he may have fallen into some traps he may have fallen down a righteous man falls but he gets up i know i've fallen many many times but i am a witness to the grace of god that he knows that my heart's desire is to give him absolutely everything that i have and obey him in everything that i that i can that i will that i and i will by his grace because it's the holy ghost that'll do it you cannot do it in yourself if jesus was the only one who could fulfill the word in that day when he came on he's still the only one that can fulfill the word in this day and if you're trying to fulfill it by your own strength you're going to be sorely disappointed we've got all this knowledge paul said yet though i have all knowledge he said all knowledge though i know all mysteries i have not charity what is charity the holy ghost the very life of christ charity you can't that's something you can't fake that's something you can't see satan can impersonate all those virtues brother branham said in statute for perfect man right there's a nature given temperance and nature giving patience all these nature given things and you can see some people that are so good the pharisees were so good people probably would have thought they had the holy ghost then brother brant he said who was there to help you when you were sick the kind of priest who was there to do this the title priest who was there to do that who gave you money when you needed it when you're a little tight on money the kind of priest and yet jesus came on the seat and said you're whited sepulcher is full of dead men's bones why because their motive and objective wasn't right and i stand before you here at least for myself and i say i've been praying this i say lord my only objective is to see the life of christ manifested in me not because i want to be any great thing but because i know it's the only way that i can fulfill the word of god is to have his life manifested in me is to be underneath that headship and then this lastly abraham we understand the story of abraham see abraham believed from the heart but it just took a while for his walk to catch up to it because the scripture says he believed god and it was counted for righteousness but then we find out he only obeyed in part to begin with because he brought lot with him brother braham said he was always a fly in the ointment and so what did god have to do got it to come down and he'll do it for you there's something he don't want to separate from don't worry he'll bring some strife he'll bring some he'll bring some conflict into your life to get you to a place where you've got to separate he'll put it there if your seed he'll put it there and so what did he do he finally separated and then here comes the lord again to confirm the promise and then he brings isaac on the scene and then what does he do again god gives him another thing here's now you got to sacrifice your son and because he was obedient to that god says in blessing i will bless thee in multiplying i will multiply thee so much so that when it came to isaac the lord come and said to isaac he said he said for thy father abraham's sake that faith was so great he said i'll bless you i'll multiply you we've got to come under that full obedience to the word brother branham says in the token i'm going to skim through this last little part if the lord allows maybe next time if we feel led that way maybe we'll kind of expand on the second part of this but uh so we understand obedience in a simple form is i tell you something you do it right but i really when i read i didn't read the full definition of obedience as i read it when i looked it up but the last little part is what just really brings it home so it says compliance with an order or quest or law or submission to another's authority that is what obedience from the heart looks like when you can lay everything down and say lord my my ways are filthy rags my ways are not your ways but lord you are righteous you alone are righteous your ways are past my ways your thoughts are above my thoughts and i lay down all my thoughts lord so so your mind can be my mind lord if you want me to be really little over here and have nothing and do nothing because it'll glorify you let me do it lord if you want me to have all things and be some rich person but it'll glorify you because you got to have someone in that position lord give me the ability to do it and he'll do it if that's if that's what he's called you to do but lord whatever paul said he said i know how to abound and to suffer need i know how to be hungry and to be full why he said because in all things as long as i have christ that's the only thing that he was under that headship brothers and sisters and so just this last little thing as we close from the token brother braham says now when you want eternal life you receive a token and we've heard these and i know we've probably heard these these quotes many times he said you receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it's the life itself amen full obedience to the whole word of god to god's entire word will entitle you to this token now that if you take that on its face value sounds a whole lot like something you cannot accomplish because in yourself if you're guilty of the least you're guilty of the whole oh my the lord loves to put his people into a place where they realize their sufficiency lies in him he said how do you do it peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the token for the promises unto you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call when they seen that wonderful display of the power of a resurrection he peter got up there and quoted the scriptures of joel and so forth give the promise for that age and showed the requirements of that age had been met in jesus christ and that he had set back a token of his death and that token was upon them and he said the token is to you and to your children and then that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call will have to have this token amen it's not they may ought to have it they shall have it you shall receive the holy ghost now listen this is what this is what really drives it home here it says when you fully obey the word of god in full surrender to it you're entitled to the token yes sir obedience not he that saith lord lord but he that doeth the will and when we pray we must have the token present with our prayer so what is it it's full submission to the headship of the word and i didn't even get to get into all the things on that line but we find you know even elijah when he heard the whirlwind and the fire and the earthquake what did he do the scripture says he veiled himself and he walked out before the lord what did that veil represent the veil represents headship he was coming under he was showing he was underneath it didn't matter what all the other things looked like it didn't matter all the signs and wonders that may have gone before which are great it didn't matter all the shouting and the dancing and singing which is great i love those things but when that still small voice came the word he recognized that he humbled himself to it and the same thing with rebecca we remember rebecca riding with eliezer on that camel writing that holy ghost writing that word all the way there but what happened when she saw isaac in the field at evening time the scripture says she veiled herself she came under headship to the word she wasn't under hership to a man's ideas she wasn't under headship to her own ideas she couldn't have any ideas why because she'd only heard what eliezer had told her and so she said i'm coming under headship to that and i'm running to my husband that's my prayer lord help me to come into full surrender to your headship because that's where the authority lies you remember brother branham told the little story about the the police officer being in the the middle of the street and he said the the poor guy out there you know he couldn't couldn't stop anything with his natural form he was just a scrawny little guy but he had that badge and he had that whistle he said what was it it wasn't it wasn't his ability but it was the authority that was it invested in him that gave the power and that's what we have to come to realize is that if we want if you want to see the power of god in your life then come under the headship of this word come under full headship search through your life i'm telling you brothers and sisters it's searching time it is searching time the death angel is out there we know that last horse rider was death it's out there seeking who doesn't have the token who's not in obedience what they do they had to go through that house looking for every little bit of leaven and say lord if there's any place in my heart it's easy to look at your flesh i fall all the time according to the flesh but i say lord look at my heart what is it if there's anything any wicked way in me anything i haven't surrendered brother branham preach the message doors door in the door and all these different door to the heart if there's a door that i've tried to close if there's a thing that i've tried to hide i've been i've been praying to the lord lord if there's anything in my past i need to make right make it known if there's anything that's hindering me in any way lord make it known i don't want an aiken in my camp i don't want to naked in my camp it's easy to look at the church as a whole but god's calling individuals to get down before him and humble themselves to the headship of the word and you'll find out this message is perfect this word is perfect you'll find it works just as good as it did back in brother branham's day it lives just as much as it did then it lives just as much as it did in jesus it lives just as much as it did in enoch's time when all what it did is so simple brothers and sisters he walked with god and he was not for god took him so simple but what did he do he was under a full headship we didn't even get to everything that we were thinking of but i trust maybe if the lord will bring it to your mind maybe the lord would have you search some of those things out you find out what that authority under headship really is when you can come into your position in the word and you find out that that's where the power lays you run out there just trying to do every which thing and whatnot and doing all this thing you'll end up like the sons of skiva just just jumping out of your place oh i'm going to go over here i'm going to go do this i'm going to go do that because of the mental conception but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength wait upon thy ministry wait i believe he said it even twice he said wait i say on the lord let's just stand my heart's desire by the grace of god is to be so dead to myself i don't want any part of randall verton to exist anymore i'm sick and tired of myself this flesh doesn't like to doesn't this flesh don't like to pray the flesh don't like to to witness it don't like to live the word of god but like paul said he said i find there there's a there's a law that when i would do good evil is present with me so what am i going to do i'm going to submit myself to the law and the inner man i'm going to die daily i had a brother said something that was really good i really liked it you know we were talking about that you know we talk about that all the time dying out you know in and of ourselves we don't even know how to die out we don't even know how to we we need the lord jesus to do that and he showed it in the garden when he died to himself and say lord let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he conquered it there he's going to conquer in me he's going to conquer it in you he's going to conquer you so let's submit ourselves as living sacrifices to him amen let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer lord jesus father we just love you so much lord lord we're not in and of ourselves worthy of the least of your mercies but lord god you chose us from before the foundation of the world lord you put a wedding band a predestination on us lord and then you sealed us into the day of our redemption lord i believe we've come into that obedience from the heart lord where we can display that token in our lives lord if there be anyone here lord that maybe hasn't come to that place lord may you bring them to that altar in their heart even right now and lay everything down upon it lord every desire that they would have every ambition every thought lord even if it seems good lord that scripture says lord you said there's other way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is death lord i confess that i'm wrong in everything but you're right in everything lord and i surrender myself unto your word this evening lord i surrender myself even more unto your headship lord to my husband to the lord jesus christ lord who died and gave himself for me lord that you could reunite with us once again lord and we could just live a wonderful millennium day with you lord and then go beyond even that into a new heavens and a new earth and all the things that you have for us lord that our minds can't even has never even come into thought lord what you have in store for us but lord right now you desire lord truth on the inward parts though you're desiring those that would come to you with sincere and contrite hearts lord fully surrendered to you lord we want to surrender ourselves more to you lord lord even you had to learn obedience through the things you suffered lord and lord even though we go through many trials and tribulations father may we always learn lord how to humble ourselves more to you as job lord we could have a testimony of job though we slay me yet i'll trust him lord that you give and you take away but blessed be the name of the lord lord we just commit the people into your hands this evening lord get glory to yourself lord may you manifest yourself to each and every one in their own lives lord may we all make our calling and election sure so lord we we can stand at that day in confidence knowing oh god that the price was paid that the token's been applied and that we're abiding in you lord and that you abide in us we love you lord we commit the people into your hands now may you just get glory and honor in all things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's just sing that song teach me lord to wait oh teach me lord to wait down on my knees till [Music] [Applause] [Music] teach me [Music] foreign [Music] upon the [Music] they lord not love [Music] teach me lord teach me lord [Music] teach me [Music] help me [Music] eyes on me [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] teach [Music] one more time [Music] with me [Music] and i thought that was so well and his brother randy was preaching i thought you know we always sometimes think of authority like some totalitarian over us you know someone that's cracking the whip and just making us obey because kind of like your kids they say why and you say because i said so but but he's not that way you know he's not approaching us as an authority he's approaching us as a guide [Music] i will lead you and guide you into all truth why are we obedient because he's guiding us through a wilderness that we've never been in before we're coming up against spirits and things that we couldn't even imagine in our mind that is going on and so our obedience is is for our own welfare i mean he doesn't want us to be obey because he said so he wants us to obey because he's leading us and guiding us to a reward and so it's beneficial to us you know what i mean just to really understand coming into subjection to the word of god is for your own sake and for your own reward he has a large portion of heaven waiting for his bride amen i want him to lead us right there amen remember service sunday morning this will go a little farther into the message does god ever change his mind about his word amen it may certainly be a blessing to you again if you have a special prayer request on your heart something you'd like god to do and let us just make that request made known to the lord as we approaches the throne with dismissal this evening our gracious heavenly father we've heard the admonishment from the scriptures telling us all through time that those who have been successful and those who have reached their mark and ran the race succeeded by accepting your leadership and by seeking your face and seeking your leadership and bringing themselves subject to your spirit because you said you wouldn't lead us comfortless but you would come to us and that you would lead us and guide us into all truth and righteousness for father you have a place that you're guiding us to may we never lose sight of that it's not obedience for obedience sake it's obedience father to partake of the fruits of your kingdom father the people have raised their request before you father because you've asked us to lay our request at your throne for you know what we have need of even before that we ask but father when we lay our prayer out before you as children and we cry out father it lets you exercise the attribute of a father hearing the cry of the children lord hear our cry this evening and bless each one father may we take this message this evening to heart father forgive us of our trespasses forgive us father for many times you being the last one we consider instead of the first but by your grace and your mercy we shall overcome in the wonderful and precious name of jesus christ we pray amen amen do you love him let's sing let's sing this song for our dismissal song i am thinking of a rapture i've got one let's leave here thinking of a rapture amen god bless you you are dismissed amen [Music] [Music] oh
