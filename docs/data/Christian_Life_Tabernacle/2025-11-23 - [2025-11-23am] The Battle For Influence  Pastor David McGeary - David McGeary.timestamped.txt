[20:38] [music]
[20:41] Oh, worthy.
[20:48] Our gracious,
[20:50] the heavenly father
[20:54] Lord, we need your spirit to make the
[20:58] word of God a reality to us, Father.
[21:04] Father, we can read the letters
[21:08] and our mind, Father, will
[21:12] formulate an interpretation
[21:16] or an opinion.
[21:20] And we can live a good life by that.
[21:24] But father, we need your spirit to
[21:27] quicken the word,
[21:29] &gt;&gt; make it alive and make it real
[21:33] &gt;&gt; and reveal it to us just what you had in
[21:36] mind when you spoke it.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, that's our heart's
[21:41] desire.
[21:44] Father, we know that
[21:47] there will be a time that
[21:50] this world will cease as we know it. And
[21:55] we'll leave this civilization
[21:58] and this world, this age of technology
[22:02] and
[22:05] all the politics and science and
[22:10] things that the world seems to run on,
[22:15] Lord, and we'll be translated into
[22:18] another dimension, another world where
[22:21] things are run by your great leadership,
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Father. Father, we don't want to miss
[22:26] that.
[22:28] We ask that you would help us, Father,
[22:31] this morning to hear your word and that
[22:34] it would be ever so
[22:39] impressed upon our heart.
[22:42] We just ask that you would grant that to
[22:44] us, Father. Forgive us of our sins and
[22:47] our short
[22:50] and our trespasses
[22:53] to get you, Father. and encourage our
[22:56] hearts and help us overcome for we ask
[23:00] these things in Jesus precious name we
[23:03] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[23:07] morning. Uh uh we we wanted to play uh a
[23:12] portion of of a message for you this
[23:15] morning. And uh you know, every time
[23:18] that I'm going to play a a tape, I meet
[23:21] more mental
[23:24] uh resistance
[23:26] than anything that I ever do. It's easy
[23:30] to walk out, but when you want to say,
[23:32] "I'm going to play a tape," boy, voices
[23:35] just start coming out of the woodwork.
[23:38] You know what I mean? But um I I think
[23:41] this is a uh a very tremendous tape.
[23:45] Thank you musicians for uh helping us
[23:49] this morning. I'd like to if I'd like to
[23:52] read this statement
[23:55] uh and it's in paragraph 91
[23:59] out of the greatest battle ever fought.
[24:03] And uh I'd like to read this and then
[24:05] we'll move into our
[24:09] our service this morning.
[24:14] It says [clears throat] in paragraph 91
[24:17] uh greatest battle ever fought.
[24:22] It must be accepted in the mind.
[24:26] Then it's believed with the heart.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Then the word of God becomes a reality.
[24:38] Then every sense of soul and body is
[24:45] just scorched out with the Holy Spirit.
[24:50] Then your sense of God, your
[24:54] consciousness of God, everything that's
[24:58] godly flows through you.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; There there's not a doubt anywhere.
[25:05] there's nothing can rise up
[25:08] &gt;&gt; so I want you to understand it's got to
[25:10] be accepted in the mind
[25:12] &gt;&gt; believed in the heart
[25:14] &gt;&gt; and then it becomes
[25:17] a reality
[25:19] &gt;&gt; and every sense of your soul the spirit
[25:22] flows through you and and you have a
[25:26] consciousness of God
[25:28] &gt;&gt; now that's what we're after
[25:31] &gt;&gt; we're after the consciousness of God the
[25:35] reality of his present. And and so we
[25:39] that's from the greatest battle ever
[25:41] fought and we know the battle's in the
[25:43] mind. So if I would have had a a a title
[25:48] this morning or for our Sunday school
[25:50] lesson, uh it it's the battle for
[25:54] influence.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; The battle for influence. And you know
[25:59] sometime you know not every service has
[26:01] got to be a revival. You know what I
[26:04] mean? Sometimes we just need good Bible
[26:06] teaching, good understanding,
[26:10] uh something that to make us aware of
[26:14] what we're involved in. Now, you know
[26:16] that this is the age of influencers.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Uh I always read in the news or I hear
[26:23] people and they say such and such uh a
[26:28] influencer,
[26:29] &gt;&gt; right? and they they packed the title
[26:32] influencer. Well, there's all kinds of
[26:35] influencers. A social media influencer
[26:40] uh such and such uh was arrested and he
[26:43] was a a influencer and that means he's
[26:47] in influencing.
[26:49] All right? And what the word influence
[26:51] means is the power or ability to affect
[26:57] &gt;&gt; somebody's belief,
[26:59] decisions, or actions.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; So if they're an influencer,
[27:05] &gt;&gt; they're affecting
[27:08] &gt;&gt; somebody's decisions,
[27:11] &gt;&gt; their beliefs,
[27:13] &gt;&gt; and their actions.
[27:16] So that's where we are.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; And we know who the first influencer
[27:22] was. Does anybody know who the first
[27:25] influencer was?
[27:27] &gt;&gt; It was the devil
[27:30] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Eden. He went up to Eve and he said,
[27:36] "Surely
[27:38] you won't die." And he began to
[27:42] influence
[27:45] her
[27:47] and that was the first influencer
[27:50] and he caused her to make a decision
[27:54] and that decision cost the whole world
[27:58] into death. Satan never changes his
[28:03] tactic.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; He always works the same way. We know
[28:08] where the battleground is. It's in your
[28:11] mind.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Right. So, and we we were going to speak
[28:15] on faith in the uh
[28:20] faith in the accusation, but Matthew
[28:22] covered that pretty well. And so, we
[28:25] wanted to go on farther in that and and
[28:29] then and and maybe go and recognize the
[28:32] enemy and every single one of his
[28:35] tricks.
[28:37] you know what he's trying to do, what it
[28:39] is you're up against, what's going on
[28:42] around you every day, what is
[28:45] transpiring and
[28:48] affecting you and driving you. And if
[28:51] you don't recognize it, then it has the
[28:55] power to affect your decisions,
[28:59] &gt;&gt; your beliefs,
[29:01] &gt;&gt; and your actions. and and so I I just
[29:05] don't think this is really a wonderful
[29:07] uh message and I I think that you'll
[29:10] really uh be blessed by it. And so we
[29:14] wanted to go we wanted to listen to it
[29:16] and then we wanted to uh take our time
[29:20] and uh go through it. So we're going to
[29:24] start by reading in the book of uh
[29:27] Isaiah the 6th chapter.
[29:35] starting with the first verse and it
[29:38] starts and in the year of King Uriah.
[29:41] We'll listen to this and then we'll take
[29:44] this is going to be 40 minutes and then
[29:46] we'll we'll go back through it and just
[29:49] pick out some highlighted spots and talk
[29:52] about it this morning. So today's Sunday
[29:55] school.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's now I know that we have
[30:01] language barrier and and uh and I know
[30:05] it's difficult uh maybe sometimes when
[30:08] we play a tape but brother Brandham's
[30:11] very measured in this and and uh I think
[30:14] it should be an easy for our
[30:16] interpreters to interpret. If you have
[30:19] your phone and you can pull it up in
[30:22] your language, it's it's January
[30:27] 12th, 1963.
[30:30] 112, 1963.
[30:32] The message is influence. And we'll just
[30:36] listen to 40 minutes this morning and
[30:39] then have a little Bible study out of
[30:41] it. and hope today that uh we can leave
[30:46] here fortified in the word of God.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Not just blessed by the presence of the
[30:53] Lord, but to have some real solid
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Bible uh nuggets to to stand on and put
[31:03] in our arsenal to to fight the devil.
[31:06] That's what we want to do, right? We
[31:09] want our faith to soar. Is that right?
[31:12] Every every the our consciousness of
[31:16] God. Well, in order for that to happen,
[31:19] it's first got to be accepted in the
[31:22] mind,
[31:24] &gt;&gt; and then it's got to be believe with the
[31:26] heart.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Then
[31:29] it becomes
[31:32] the consciousness
[31:34] of God. In other words, then you know
[31:37] that God's with you. And I think so many
[31:40] people believe in God, but they just
[31:44] don't know if he's with them.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And he promised, "I'll be with you, even
[31:51] in you till the end.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Wheresoever I'll go, I'll I'll go with
[31:57] you." And that we can know
[32:00] he's with me.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; He's watching over me. He's here to help
[32:05] me in this situation. So, we we want to
[32:09] hold on uh this morning and listen close
[32:13] if you would. Uh and this is a got us a
[32:17] lot of real uh lessons in in here for
[32:22] us. So, if you have your Bibles, uh the
[32:25] message is influence. I believe it was
[32:27] preached the full gospel of businessmen
[32:30] in Phoenix. We're only listening to
[32:33] about half of it uh this morning, but
[32:37] it's going to be wonderful for you. So,
[32:39] after we read the scripture, feel free
[32:42] to take your seat and and this is study
[32:46] today. This isn't about feeling good.
[32:48] This is about accepting
[32:51] something in your mind.
[32:55] All right? So, we want to attack your
[32:58] mind this morning. Hallelujah.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; What are we going to attack your mind
[33:02] with? The voice of the messenger.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; That's a good mind attack.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. I hope
[33:09] you're blessed.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I would like this morning,
[33:17] God willing, to open the scripture, if
[33:19] you wish to, now to the book of Isaiah.
[33:24] And this being a businessman's meeting,
[33:28] yet
[33:30] their main business
[33:32] is getting souls right with God.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; That's what they're dedicated to.
[33:40] And we are wanting to speak on the
[33:43] gospel and the sincerity and the
[33:45] approach to it.
[33:48] And let's begin reading now from Isaiah
[33:51] 6. The first chap the first verse of
[33:54] Isaiah 6 reading down including the eth.
[34:01] And in the year that king
[34:05] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[34:08] throne high lifted up and his train
[34:11] filled the temple.
[34:14] And above it stood the saraphim. Each
[34:18] had six wings. With twain he covered his
[34:21] face, and with twain he covered his
[34:23] feet, and with tween he did fly.
[34:27] And one cried to another said, "Holy,
[34:32] holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts.
[34:37] The whole earth is full of his glory."
[34:40] And the post of the doors moved at the
[34:43] voice of him that cried. and the house
[34:47] was filled with smoke.
[34:51] Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am
[34:54] undone, because I'm a man of unclean
[34:56] lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
[34:59] people of unclean lips.
[35:02] For mine eyes have seen the King, the
[35:05] Lord of Hosts.
[35:07] Then flew one of the ser unto me having
[35:11] a live coal in his hand which he had
[35:14] taken with the tongs from off the altar.
[35:18] And he laid it upon my mouth and said,
[35:21] "Lo, this has touched thy lips, and
[35:25] thine iniquity is taken away, and thy
[35:29] sin is purged."
[35:31] Also I heard the voice of the Lord
[35:35] saying, "Who shall I send and who shall
[35:38] go for us?" Then said I, "Here am I,
[35:44] send me."
[35:48] I wish to draw from this little text
[35:53] some context on some notes that I have
[35:57] written down here. And if I should give
[36:00] it a title, I would like to call it
[36:03] influence.
[36:06] You know, there's so many of us and most
[36:09] all of us
[36:11] uh influence somebody by the things that
[36:14] we do and the way we live and the things
[36:16] we say. We influence somebody.
[36:21] Somebody is watching your life.
[36:27] And then when we profess to be
[36:29] Christians,
[36:32] what type of life should we live? If
[36:36] somebody
[36:37] is watching us and your life that you
[36:41] live will reflect an influence on
[36:44] somebody that might
[36:47] it might be the their eternal
[36:50] destination will rest upon the way that
[36:53] you live and the things that you do.
[36:56] for they watch him.
[37:00] And in our text this morning as
[37:04] influence,
[37:05] we find that this king
[37:10] was a
[37:13] a great influence to Isaiah, the the
[37:17] young prophet.
[37:20] Isaiah had been called to his side
[37:24] and being a noted vindicated prophet of
[37:29] his day.
[37:31] And he had a I believe the way that
[37:35] Isaiah spoke it, he was uh uh had a
[37:40] great influence upon Isaiah.
[37:44] Now we find that Uzekiah was called to
[37:49] be king at the age of about 16 years old
[37:53] after his father's death. And his father
[37:57] was a a great believer and he had his
[38:02] mother also was a very fine woman.
[38:08] And this young king had been um crowned
[38:13] at a young age and quickly he taken the
[38:18] road that was right
[38:20] because of the influence of a godly
[38:24] father and a godly mother.
[38:27] And I think that's a very fine example
[38:31] for we parent today
[38:35] is to set an example before our
[38:37] children.
[38:40] Now you'll live your your best and your
[38:43] worst at home.
[38:45] And I think that our lives though that
[38:49] children might not just exactly act like
[38:53] they're noticing it, but they are
[38:55] noticing it. Don't you never think that
[38:58] they are not because they're watching.
[39:02] Not only the children are watching, but
[39:04] the neighbors are watching.
[39:07] Not only the neighbors are watching, but
[39:09] the uh all that you are associated with
[39:14] watches. The people at your church watch
[39:17] you. The people that you do business
[39:19] with in the markets, they're watching
[39:23] you after your confession.
[39:26] And we should always try to reflect
[39:30] Christ in everything that we do.
[39:34] I know a little motto that I had hanging
[39:36] in my house many years ago.
[39:40] I picked it up one day when at Billy
[39:43] Sunday's tabernacle when I was at one of
[39:46] the meetings up at um in W on a lake
[39:51] and I liked it so much till I I got it
[39:54] and hung it up in my house and I kept it
[39:57] until it just fell apart. It was
[40:00] something like this.
[40:02] go no place you would not be want to be
[40:06] found if Jesus should come and uh be
[40:12] saying nothing that you would not want
[40:14] to be saying
[40:16] if Jesus should come and it went on with
[40:20] many things saying what you and
[40:23] otherwise whatever you do or say or
[40:27] whatever action that you're performing
[40:30] do not do it If you would not want to be
[40:34] caught in that position when Jesus
[40:36] comes,
[40:39] if we could only do that, I'm sure we'd
[40:42] be a great influence upon our
[40:45] associates.
[40:48] And
[40:50] you know the right there's two ways to
[40:53] do anything. That's right and wrong. I
[40:56] had my little son Joseph on my lap the
[40:59] other day and I said to him, he's eight
[41:03] years old and some little boy had uh
[41:06] stepped on his toes and he and the
[41:08] little boy had a fight. So I said,
[41:11] "Joseph, don't don't do that." He said,
[41:13] "But daddy, he did such and such." I
[41:16] said, "But that doesn't matter." See
[41:18] what he did. Just remember, Joseph, that
[41:22] you love your father. He said, "Yes,
[41:25] daddy. I said, "Then remember that
[41:28] people are going to look at your life as
[41:31] a minister, son.
[41:34] And then if you do anything wrong, then
[41:38] they're going to say, "Does this
[41:40] minister
[41:41] permit his child to do such?"
[41:44] Now, we know they do it anyhow. But, uh,
[41:48] we know that as Christians, we know that
[41:50] we try to bring up our children, right?
[41:52] But uh it's a good thing to keep that be
[41:56] front before all the time that do what's
[41:59] right. Don't don't ever take that other
[42:01] side. So um I said because you see that
[42:06] doesn't only reflect on you Joseph, but
[42:09] it reflects on your mother, reflects on
[42:11] your sisters, it reflects on your father
[42:15] and the very cause of the family, what
[42:18] we're standing for. And then what we
[42:21] stand for, it reflects on that on Jesus
[42:25] Christ.
[42:26] You don't want to do that. I said our
[42:29] our Lord told us if we're if somebody
[42:32] smites us on one cheek, just turn the
[42:34] other. And of course, that's kind of
[42:36] hard for a little boy with a high temper
[42:38] to begin with to to think of such
[42:40] things, but place it before him anyhow.
[42:43] See that he should not do it.
[42:46] Now this young fellow Yesiah had such a
[42:51] training in his early days to when he
[42:55] taken the throne.
[42:57] He never turned right or left from the
[43:01] thing that was right. He stayed right
[43:04] with it. He never let politics influence
[43:10] him in any way.
[43:12] He was a man who was determined to serve
[43:15] God regardless. And so politics didn't
[43:20] he ignored all of those things. And
[43:22] another thing that I liked about
[43:25] was that he ignored popularity or
[43:29] popular opinions.
[43:31] No matter what anybody else thought or
[43:34] what the popular trend of the day was,
[43:37] he wanted to serve God regardless.
[43:42] Oh, we need man like that.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; In our uh political world,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; we need man like that in the White
[43:54] House.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; We need man like that in business.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; We need man like that in the pull pit.
[44:03] Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Man that will not turn to popular
[44:08] opinions or popularity,
[44:12] but will stay straight with the word,
[44:16] &gt;&gt; not turn right or left.
[44:21] God in commission Joshua said, "This
[44:23] book of the law shall not depart out of
[44:27] thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate
[44:29] therein day and night, and then thou
[44:32] shalt make thy ways prosperous. Then
[44:35] thou shalt have good success."
[44:38] And not only that, but you're
[44:41] influencing somebody the same way you're
[44:44] traveling.
[44:46] And so I appreciate uh the stand that
[44:50] Hezekiah took to be determined. The
[44:54] first thing he be to do was to repair
[44:57] the house of the Lord and to build up
[44:59] the places that had been torn down and
[45:02] then go out to the enemy after he proved
[45:05] to God that he was sincere and he he was
[45:08] going to take the right stand regardless
[45:11] of what his uh people around him, his uh
[45:14] advisors to influence him to a political
[45:18] side of the of the kingdom. He would not
[45:21] stand for it. Hallelujah.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; He wanted God's will in that alone.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man we need, the kind
[45:29] of mothers we need. A woman, a mother of
[45:33] this day that will take the right stand.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And do what's right regardless of what
[45:40] the other women does. Do what's right.
[45:43] Hallelujah.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; It's such a pity to see our nation in
[45:49] such a scrimml as it is today.
[45:54] I got up a little late this morning to
[45:56] get to the breakfast and I went to a
[45:58] place and to get some coffee and this a
[46:01] little lady come out to serve me and she
[46:04] had wife and I were sitting there and
[46:06] she had her eyes blue, you know, that
[46:10] stuffed up her eyes and um I seen one of
[46:13] those in Los Angeles one time, the first
[46:15] one I ever seen the ladies made up in
[46:18] that way. I I I thought that I I was
[46:21] going to walk up and tell her I was a
[46:23] missionary and I'd seen flaggery and
[46:27] leprosy and but I'd never seen anything
[46:29] like that. And I was going to ask her if
[46:32] I could not pray for her and and I and
[46:36] tell me what kind of a disease she had
[46:39] and I was a little afraid of it and I
[46:43] never seen anything quite like it. And I
[46:46] when I walked over, I was waiting for
[46:48] brother Arganbright and uh one of the
[46:52] businessmen and the officials and
[46:55] another girl walked up looked just like
[46:57] her.
[46:58] I would say I I might be wrong here that
[47:02] she might have did that herself and it
[47:05] was a very attractive girl would have
[47:08] been if she just washed her face and
[47:10] looked like a human but she was so now
[47:14] when some of these movie stars
[47:18] are somewhere I don't know where it
[47:20] comes from when they will do a thing
[47:24] like that some woman with some kind of
[47:26] an influence then that influence arrest
[47:28] the nation and try to do the same.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. When our Pentecostal women
[47:35] was allowed to cut their hair because
[47:37] some minister lay down in the pullpit,
[47:39] then the rest of them said, "Well, so
[47:40] and so's wife does it, can't we?" See,
[47:43] it's the influence that she place up on
[47:46] some of them. This little lady this
[47:47] morning was such a nice little lady. She
[47:51] was very sweet and just as respectable
[47:55] as she could be. And when we she left
[47:58] the table and turned around,
[48:00] my wife looked across the table at me
[48:02] and I said, "You know, it's just a pity
[48:06] that
[48:08] some devil,"
[48:10] and I'm not reluctant to say devil,
[48:14] that has coped up such a thing
[48:18] to bring our American women under such
[48:21] influence as that he trace.
[48:27] influence.
[48:29] Somebody started it. Well, don't you
[48:32] never go by what some s somebody of this
[48:36] country, I don't care other country or
[48:38] or some minister's wife or somebody
[48:41] else, don't you never be influenced for
[48:43] them. You let the Bible influence you
[48:47] &gt;&gt; to the thing that's right. And that's
[48:50] wrong
[48:52] &gt;&gt; now. And then we we shout and dance and
[48:59] speak in tongues and and uh the glory of
[49:04] God we claim is on us
[49:07] and then go out to such as that.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong.
[49:14] I believe in these things, these uh
[49:18] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[49:20] dancing in the spirit.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; But brother, how could God tolerate such
[49:27] a thing as that when he's against it?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And he says so in his word. Hallelujah.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And our women has become in our churches
[49:39] uh which is merely practiced many times
[49:42] dressing sex appeal.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; It's very seldom ever spoke against from
[49:47] the pulpit and yet we shout and jump
[49:50] around and speak in tongues.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; That's the reason that this great move
[49:55] called Pentecostal is not getting any
[49:58] worse because there's no sincerity
[50:00] behind it. It becomes an emotion.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And because I say them things, many say
[50:08] he's a woman hater. He He's different
[50:10] from It's not trying to be different.
[50:13] He's trying to be sincere.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I believe that we're in the last days
[50:19] &gt;&gt; and we got a a great message,
[50:24] &gt;&gt; but all of our shouting and speaking in
[50:26] tongues will be of no effect.
[50:30] You can see it among us. You can see
[50:33] that we're growing in numbers. But are
[50:35] we growing in power?
[50:39] &gt;&gt; We're still on the same grounds that we
[50:41] were when we started 40 years ago where
[50:44] we should already be over in the
[50:46] promised land.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Influence. One minister's wife down and
[50:53] did this and one minister started so and
[50:55] so and the rest just started. Oh, may we
[50:58] like uh the uh Ezekiah here that let's
[51:03] not let nothing influence us but the
[51:06] word of God.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Let that be our influence.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Uh bring ourselves back to the faith,
[51:16] back to the correction of the scripture
[51:20] no matter what the rest of the world has
[51:22] to do.
[51:24] And we brethren, many of the brethren
[51:26] who belong to organization which
[51:28] practically it's all got little groups.
[51:31] I have nothing against that. That's all
[51:33] right. But when we going to get the
[51:35] place that we feel that ours is the only
[51:38] group that we got it the fella hasn't
[51:41] got nothing to do with it that is being
[51:44] influenced by the higherups in the
[51:47] organization that we should make our
[51:50] organization to grow. Hallelujah.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; We are to make the kingdom grow.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; We are here to influence
[51:59] &gt;&gt; and we will never be an influence to the
[52:01] outside world as long as we're trying to
[52:04] influence them to some organization
[52:06] because they've been that before we were
[52:08] born.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Let's take the stand for God and his
[52:13] word and fellowship and get all.
[52:16] Brethren,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; let us not draw a line and say if you
[52:20] don't tow to this, let's reach a hand
[52:22] across the line.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Be brethren,
[52:26] &gt;&gt; that's the reason I have been so sold on
[52:28] this year, Christian businessmans, full
[52:32] gospel fellowship, that's the reason
[52:34] that Methodists and Presbyterians and so
[52:36] forth where the ministers could not seem
[52:39] to reach across there.
[52:42] But the businessmen broke down those
[52:44] traditions.
[52:46] They're helping doing that thing. Now,
[52:48] if we can just keep it beat out of their
[52:50] heads to organize,
[52:52] which it looks like they're headed that
[52:54] way. And when they do, that's me out
[52:58] because I'm here to stand for what is
[53:01] true.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; They never want that. That's a thing
[53:09] that very I wish to speak on one of
[53:12] these nights. Samson stand in that same
[53:14] place. [clears throat] So somewhere
[53:17] along the line now let's watch what our
[53:21] influence is. Now we see uh uh Uzzekiah
[53:26] here. He was a great man and we find out
[53:31] because he took those terrific stands
[53:34] that he did that you know his kingdom
[53:37] was next to Solomon's
[53:40] he spread out even all the countries
[53:43] around about uh loved him and and they
[53:47] paid tribute to his kingdom. And we find
[53:50] out even weighed down in Egypt,
[53:54] his influence was felt.
[53:58] And this being the way he stood in this
[54:00] young prophet standing there before the
[54:02] king, he it was a great influence to
[54:06] Isaiah. how that God would bless any man
[54:10] that would be true to his word,
[54:13] regardless of what his politics tried to
[54:15] influence him to, regardless of what
[54:17] anything else tried to be.
[54:21] Hezekiah was determined to stay with the
[54:23] word and God blessed him and Isaiah saw
[54:27] it.
[54:29] that as usual,
[54:32] just like a group of people,
[54:36] just like the remark that I said about
[54:38] the businessman,
[54:40] when
[54:42] Uzzekiah
[54:44] begin to feel secure
[54:47] and he had just about got everything in
[54:49] the kingdom that God had for him, he got
[54:52] lifted up in his heart.
[54:56] Now, that's what's happened to our
[54:59] denominations all through the ages when
[55:03] they feel like they're big enough to
[55:05] say, "Now, we're that,"
[55:08] then they get lifted up and that's when
[55:10] God leaves them. That's
[55:11] &gt;&gt; right. And if the businessman gets to
[55:13] that spot
[55:15] where we have, as brother Williams said,
[55:18] 15,
[55:20] but God can do more with 15 in his hand
[55:23] than he could with 1500 out of his hand.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; But we appreciate 1500 in his hand
[55:29] instead of 15 in his hand.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; If they'll all stay in his hand,
[55:35] &gt;&gt; that's the main thing. being influenced
[55:38] not by what great numbers we are, but by
[55:42] what a great God that we're representing
[55:46] &gt;&gt; and the kind of life that is in us by
[55:50] him that will influence others. Jesus
[55:53] said, "You are the salt of the earth."
[55:56] But if the salt has lost its savior, it
[55:59] is henceforth good for nothing, cast
[56:02] out, caught under the feet of man. We
[56:05] must never forget that we are salt. But
[56:08] if its salt loses its strength, that's
[56:12] its its power to contact.
[56:17] And salt can only save as it contacts.
[56:20] And if it loses its power of contact,
[56:23] then it is no more salt, but it's sand.
[56:26] That's right.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; It's to be made walks.
[56:31] And when we lose our influence as a
[56:34] father, as a mother, as a Christian, as
[56:38] a businessman, as a minister, when we
[56:42] lose our influence with people.
[56:46] Now, we can be very popular in the line
[56:48] of the world and go wrong with the
[56:49] world. But I mean as what we represent,
[56:53] we represent Christ.
[56:56] When we lose our influence as that
[57:00] as standing out, how can we blend in
[57:03] with the day when God so against the
[57:05] day?
[57:07] How could Micah say, "Go on up and
[57:09] prosper? My vision's right with yours."
[57:13] When he know that God had cursed that
[57:15] evil people,
[57:17] his vision had to be contrary.
[57:21] And a man's vision today that could go
[57:23] with the trend of the world and still
[57:26] remain a minister. There's something
[57:28] wrong with the man's vision.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; You know what God said about this rich
[57:33] Leo was seeing church?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Put him on the outside.
[57:38] We cannot stand with the popular belief
[57:40] and vote of the day. We've got to be
[57:42] against that thing.
[57:45] Now, so it this king got along fine
[57:50] until he found out that all the nations
[57:53] was fearing him. He become largely uh
[57:56] populated. His kingdom got built up and
[57:59] he got lifted up in his heart with
[58:02] pride. You see, we're just I'm just a
[58:05] big man now.
[58:07] And that's the way out. The way up is
[58:11] down.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; How do you know which is up or down?
[58:16] Because if the world stand in space, how
[58:18] do you know which is up or down? So
[58:21] always he that humbles himself, God will
[58:24] exalt.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; He that exalts himself, God will bring
[58:27] to a base.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He'll bring him down. Always keep humble
[58:32] and be little in your own sight.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; No matter what God does for you, just
[58:37] see how much more humbler you can be all
[58:39] the time.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; More God blesses you, just keep getting
[58:42] more humble all the time. He can
[58:44] continue to bless. But when you get to a
[58:47] place you think, "I got it." You haven't
[58:49] got it.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; You're on your road out.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You lose your influence. You lose the
[58:58] the strength of your testimony.
[59:01] When you women begin to uh want to be
[59:05] like the rest of women, there's
[59:08] something wrong. Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; When you man, you ministers be trying to
[59:12] become like uh pattern nature somebody
[59:14] else. When you businessmen try to do
[59:18] business on the scale that somebody else
[59:20] would do it on because they're prospers,
[59:22] prosperity don't always represent
[59:26] success in Christ. Sometimes very much
[59:29] to the contrary.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:34] Now
[59:35] pride he got lifted up and he thought
[59:38] what a great fellow I am
[59:41] so much he got lifted up till he tried
[59:44] to take the place of a
[59:48] minister.
[59:51] He goes into the temple
[59:54] which p picked up the sensor of fire and
[59:58] went up to the altar of incense.
[1:00:00] Now that was only consecrated man can do
[1:00:03] that.
[1:00:05] Now as I have said before so say that
[1:00:08] again
[1:00:10] businessmen are not preachers.
[1:00:13] We preachers have enough time to try to
[1:00:15] keep this thing straight. Let alone
[1:00:18] businessmen.
[1:00:20] You all are businessmen not ministers.
[1:00:23] And don't take the place of one or try
[1:00:26] to because you're not called for such.
[1:00:29] If you want somebody to speak at your
[1:00:31] conventions, get a preacher.
[1:00:34] Somebody's called to do so.
[1:00:37] Because you see what a struggle us
[1:00:39] ministers has got.
[1:00:42] So, you see what you do? And um Hezekiah
[1:00:48] here, he tried to to take the place of a
[1:00:52] priest. He thought, "Well, God's blessed
[1:00:54] me. Why can't I do it?"
[1:00:56] Don't you never get that in your head?
[1:01:00] God calls and predestinates and forains
[1:01:03] to his glory.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing. You remember in the Bible when
[1:01:08] Moses was bringing Israel out of Egypt
[1:01:11] across to to the promised land, do you
[1:01:14] remember one in there, Dayan, and those
[1:01:16] who got lifted up and said, "Now wait a
[1:01:18] minute, Moses, you try to be the only
[1:01:20] one on the beach. There's other holy men
[1:01:22] among here." And God said, "Separate
[1:01:24] yourself because I will destroy him."
[1:01:28] God had orained a certain thing to be
[1:01:30] done and it must be done that way.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; We're not to inject our own ideas. We're
[1:01:37] to respect his idea and his
[1:01:39] commandments.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And not referring back to our sisters,
[1:01:45] but at the no matter what the other
[1:01:47] woman does, God's got your pattern laid
[1:01:50] here. That's right.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; No matter what uh some other layman done
[1:01:54] in the Bible, God's got your pattern
[1:01:56] here. What to do? We'll get to it after
[1:01:58] a while perhaps what the layman is to
[1:02:00] do. And the minister,
[1:02:04] all of us has our places and we must
[1:02:07] abide in our calling.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we find out that this man got
[1:02:12] lifted up. So he uh uh took the sensor
[1:02:15] and went forth to the altar which was
[1:02:17] only permitted by God to consecrated man
[1:02:21] to that office.
[1:02:24] He tried to take the minister's place
[1:02:27] and then the minister tried to correct
[1:02:29] him. We find out that four score priests
[1:02:32] besides the high priest come after him
[1:02:34] and told him sir. In other words like
[1:02:36] this God has blessed you. You're an
[1:02:39] honored man. You're a great man
[1:02:43] and God has blessed you in your work,
[1:02:45] but you you shouldn't do that. You're
[1:02:48] getting off of the beaten road.
[1:02:52] Oh, how I could say some things here.
[1:02:57] Yes. Getting off the beaten road. But,
[1:03:01] uh, be it the thing is the way it is,
[1:03:04] let's try to conserve what we can get a
[1:03:06] hold of.
[1:03:08] Uh he said you're off the track for the
[1:03:11] word of God says so and so. Only Aaron's
[1:03:16] generation shall do this. That's for
[1:03:18] Aaron and him alone
[1:03:21] and his children. So king, we honor you.
[1:03:24] We respect you. You're a great man. But
[1:03:27] don't try to do that. And was he humble?
[1:03:31] No, sir. He thought God's blessed me, so
[1:03:34] I'll just do what I want to.
[1:03:38] Now, watch my brethren.
[1:03:42] Be careful there because no matter how
[1:03:46] much God has filled you with his spirit
[1:03:48] and how much that you have done and how
[1:03:50] well you've been blessed, you stay with
[1:03:53] the calling of God.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Don't get off on some traditions and
[1:03:58] organizational schemes and so forth. You
[1:04:01] better come back to the path. better
[1:04:04] come back to what God laid down at the
[1:04:06] beginning. Now, so we find out that this
[1:04:10] man when he was corrected instead of
[1:04:13] humbled himself and admitting that the
[1:04:16] word was right and God was right, he
[1:04:18] become angry.
[1:04:21] Hey, in other words, uh uh he was ready
[1:04:24] to kick him out of his organization. He
[1:04:27] was uh he was very upset about it. Uh
[1:04:30] very perplexed and oh he got angry and
[1:04:33] he have to turn around and say you just
[1:04:35] wait a minute.
[1:04:37] Do you realize who I am?
[1:04:40] Now when you're corrected by the word of
[1:04:42] God you must be subject to the word.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And he said uh he would do as he
[1:04:51] pleased. He was the head of the thing.
[1:04:52] So he he'd just do as he wanted to. And
[1:04:56] you know what happened? He was smitten
[1:04:58] with leprosy. And while his anger, rage
[1:05:02] was upon him, the priest detected the
[1:05:04] leprosy in his face.
[1:05:09] Now
[1:05:11] you say, well, what you mean leprosy
[1:05:14] represents is is a type rather of sin.
[1:05:19] And when a man won't stand correction by
[1:05:21] the word of God, he's full of leprosy.
[1:05:26] Blows up and carries on. What does you
[1:05:30] what do you do? You ruin your influence.
[1:05:34] See, something happens.
[1:05:38] People knows and can tell the word that
[1:05:40] you're corrected by that you're not
[1:05:43] going to do it.
[1:05:45] Therefore, you ruin your influence and
[1:05:48] it hurt this fella. Anger got on him.
[1:05:52] And while he was in his anger, leprosy
[1:05:55] was in his face. And we find out that he
[1:05:59] not only did he drop the sensor, but he
[1:06:02] ran from the house of God to never be
[1:06:06] able to return again.
[1:06:09] Because no matter how great he was and
[1:06:11] how much influence he had had, he when
[1:06:14] he was corrected then he refused to take
[1:06:18] his correction because his social
[1:06:20] standing had become more to him than the
[1:06:22] word of God had become.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you understand what I'm driving
[1:06:27] at.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; It become more to him. His position as
[1:06:33] king become more to him than the word of
[1:06:35] God.
[1:06:37] When this businessman's organization
[1:06:39] gets to that place,
[1:06:42] when the minister of his organization
[1:06:44] gets to that place,
[1:06:47] then he's done.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Don't faint when you're rebuked.
[1:06:53] When you read something in the scripture
[1:06:55] and you know that you should humble
[1:06:57] yourself and follow the word of God in
[1:06:59] the path that he ordained for you walk
[1:07:01] in, then you don't do it. Then first
[1:07:03] thing you know, it's over. your
[1:07:05] influence is spoiled. Now, we must
[1:07:08] remember that. And this young prophet,
[1:07:10] what a lesson that was to him. Then when
[1:07:14] he seen this king
[1:07:16] by this very thing, Isaiah learned one
[1:07:20] of his greatest lessons that no matter
[1:07:23] how great a man might be, how much
[1:07:26] influence he might have, but when he
[1:07:29] fails to walk in light, when he fails to
[1:07:33] obey God,
[1:07:36] then his influence is ruined and he's
[1:07:39] stuck off the field. Another
[1:07:44] thing Isaiah learned, he learned by
[1:07:46] this, that God orders his man to his
[1:07:49] place.
[1:07:52] Not you putting yourself in that place,
[1:07:54] but God puts his man in place.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; We must recognize that.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; I've often used this. Uh I like to hunt,
[1:08:04] as you know, up in the north when when
[1:08:06] the winter starts coming in, little
[1:08:08] ducks is born up there on the ponds. And
[1:08:10] as soon as that first cold breeze uh
[1:08:13] tops the mountains and a few flakes of
[1:08:16] snow falls, now that little duck was
[1:08:18] born in the spring up on that lake and
[1:08:21] he never was off the lake. He knows
[1:08:23] nothing about anything else but that
[1:08:25] lake. But just as sure as that breeze
[1:08:27] blows and he feels that breeze blow, he
[1:08:30] runs right out in the middle of that,
[1:08:32] swims out there and raises a little nose
[1:08:34] up the air and honks a few times and
[1:08:37] every duck on the pond will come right
[1:08:39] to him and he'll raise up with that
[1:08:43] instinct in him knowing that soon that
[1:08:46] pond's going to be froze over our lake
[1:08:49] and he'll go just as straight to
[1:08:50] Louisiana as he can go.
[1:08:53] He will.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Why? There's something in him.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; It's a God-given instinct and he uses
[1:09:01] it.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It guides him. Now, what does it do?
[1:09:06] What if he went a if that instinct led
[1:09:10] him farther north, then he would know
[1:09:13] there was something wrong
[1:09:15] and those ducks wouldn't follow him
[1:09:17] because he's going contrary to the
[1:09:20] regular path. And when we get ourselves
[1:09:23] to a place that we try to lead people
[1:09:26] contrary, they say, "Well, we the
[1:09:28] Methodists has got it. We the Baptist
[1:09:29] has got it." That isn't it.
[1:09:33] God's got it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And in the beginning was the word and
[1:09:38] the word is with God and the word was
[1:09:40] God and the word still is God.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So it's God that's God.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; So let's lead that way down the beaten
[1:09:50] path.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And not try to lead some other way. And
[1:09:56] then we find out that this little duck
[1:10:00] being that he was now the rest of the
[1:10:02] ducks seem to have any uh anything but
[1:10:05] amen.
[1:10:07] Because they something about that little
[1:10:09] fell that they knew the way that honk
[1:10:13] that bugle that he blowed. They they
[1:10:16] knew that he had the truth.
[1:10:20] And there's something about the gospel
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; for the power of the resurrection of
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "If the trumpet gives an
[1:10:30] uncertain sound, who will know how to
[1:10:33] prepare himself for a battle?" Now, but
[1:10:36] when the gospel gives a sound, Jesus
[1:10:40] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:10:41] forever. And we watch it and see that
[1:10:43] it's the truth and it's with the word,
[1:10:46] that's the thing that influences a real
[1:10:47] devil.
[1:10:48] Now there's others on the pond like
[1:10:50] water guineies and so forth they have
[1:10:52] another way mud hins and all such but
[1:10:55] they stay their own way but the real
[1:10:57] duck goes on God placed that little duck
[1:11:00] there and give him that because God
[1:11:03] placed him to be that and now God has
[1:11:06] set in the church
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; God not the organization
[1:11:12] not the achievement of man to make
[1:11:14] bishops and so forth presbyers but God
[1:11:18] set in the church. First apostles,
[1:11:21] that's missionaries. Second day,
[1:11:23] prophets, teachers, pastors,
[1:11:25] evangelists. God set them in the church.
[1:11:28] And every bugle will blow the same the
[1:11:32] same gospel.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; If he's a prophet, he blows the bugle of
[1:11:37] prophet. He foretells the things that is
[1:11:39] to come and hits every time.
[1:11:57] Good lesson,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:01] Not only do you have influence,
[1:12:04] but you're influencing.
[1:12:07] And I mean, I I I I was just felt so
[1:12:14] moved by this. Uh, you know, I the enemy
[1:12:19] fought me quite a bit, but I I just, you
[1:12:23] know, it's exactly what we need.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; We've got to really be aware of uh of
[1:12:31] what's influencing
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; influence. It's a it's it's a major
[1:12:36] thing. And it's a major thing of this
[1:12:39] age, you know. That's why television is
[1:12:44] is uh
[1:12:47] is has such a a evil thing. It could
[1:12:51] have been used for the gospel, but it's
[1:12:54] not used for that. It the whole purpose
[1:12:57] of it is to influence you. And so
[1:13:00] they'll they'll get a program, they'll
[1:13:01] get a story, they'll get something going
[1:13:04] on and then they stop it. Right. right
[1:13:07] at the right spot. You know what I mean?
[1:13:09] Just when you're wanting to know what's
[1:13:11] next and then they fill your head with
[1:13:15] all kinds of of of stuff, whether it's a
[1:13:18] car, a soap, a a smell, or whatever it
[1:13:22] is. What are they trying to do? They're
[1:13:25] trying to influence you.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; They're trying to get you to that.
[1:13:29] They're trying to change the way you
[1:13:31] believe the change the way you act to
[1:13:35] change the decision you make,
[1:13:38] you know, and then then that becomes
[1:13:40] your your filter.
[1:13:44] You you you you filter you filter things
[1:13:48] through. Now, if if you become totally
[1:13:51] unaware
[1:13:54] that the influence is out there
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and that it's trying to work on you then
[1:14:01] and you become numb to it, then you're
[1:14:04] being influenced without you even
[1:14:06] knowing it.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Now, that's deception at its highest
[1:14:11] form.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; But we've got to have that that filter
[1:14:16] on. We've got to have that ability to to
[1:14:19] to check what's influencing us. Let's
[1:14:23] just run through. I just want to run
[1:14:25] through real quick and just spend a just
[1:14:27] a a couple moments on this and try to
[1:14:31] have us out here in just a few minutes.
[1:14:33] He says you
[1:14:36] he says you know there are so many of us
[1:14:39] and most
[1:14:41] most all of us influence somebody by the
[1:14:44] things that we do the way we live and
[1:14:48] the things we say.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Every one of you has an influence.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; You are held accountable
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; for that influence.
[1:15:03] You know, you think you can just do
[1:15:05] something or say something. I thought
[1:15:08] the story about he told about his son.
[1:15:11] He says, "I sat him down. I told him not
[1:15:13] to do that." He says, "I know he's going
[1:15:15] to do it anyhow, but tell him anyway.
[1:15:18] Put it before him. Raise a child in the
[1:15:21] way it should go."
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; So, there's certain times in our life
[1:15:27] that we're we're influenced. And so he
[1:15:30] he he goes on to ex explain about the
[1:15:34] influence. He says, "I think that's a
[1:15:36] very fine example for we parents is to
[1:15:39] set an example before our children." Now
[1:15:43] I I thought this was a tremendous thing
[1:15:46] to get s to sink in. Now you live your
[1:15:50] best and your worst at home.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that becomes the the real
[1:16:02] measure,
[1:16:04] you know, look at yourself at home.
[1:16:08] That that's when you live your best. You
[1:16:10] get in your house, you think you can do
[1:16:12] things in your house, you know, or you
[1:16:14] can say things. It it's like like uh and
[1:16:19] and it's just it just something that uh
[1:16:22] we want to go forward, right? Isn't that
[1:16:25] really all that we want to do? We're all
[1:16:28] about preparing for the rapture,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; right? So, if you want to be more
[1:16:32] Christlike outside your home, you've got
[1:16:35] to start being more Christlike in your
[1:16:37] home.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean? You got to He
[1:16:43] He said always keep it before your
[1:16:45] children.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Always tell them what's right. You know,
[1:16:49] it doesn't it doesn't hurt if you get
[1:16:52] upset or something to apologize for to
[1:16:55] your kids and say, you know, I shouldn't
[1:16:57] have done that or I shouldn't have said
[1:16:58] that. You forgive me because you're
[1:17:01] setting an example.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; You're having influence and we have
[1:17:06] influence. And when we failed to think
[1:17:09] that we have influence,
[1:17:13] then then we don't hold ourselves
[1:17:16] accountable
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; and we're being held accountable by God,
[1:17:21] but
[1:17:22] we don't even know it.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want. We want to be
[1:17:27] conscious of God.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; We want to accept it in our minds. Can
[1:17:31] you imagine if you step out your door
[1:17:34] and you say, "Today I'm going to
[1:17:36] influence somebody." And as our
[1:17:38] messenger said, "And somebody's eternal
[1:17:42] destination
[1:17:44] might rest on the influence [snorts]
[1:17:46] that I have."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And so he we he came down and he talked
[1:17:52] about influence. He said we should
[1:17:54] always try to reflect Christ in
[1:17:57] everything that we do. And then he
[1:18:00] mentioned the little plaque he put up.
[1:18:03] He says, "Go no place you would not to
[1:18:06] be found when Jesus should come." And
[1:18:09] then he said, "You know, say nothing
[1:18:10] that you wouldn't want Jesus to hear."
[1:18:13] And he went on. He says,
[1:18:16] he says, "If you want to be caught in
[1:18:20] that position when Christ comes," Amen.
[1:18:24] Don't you think that's a good thing? and
[1:18:26] and and keep that before you all the
[1:18:30] time. I I I'm just running down through
[1:18:33] to put some of these things out. We need
[1:18:35] people that that aren't influenced by
[1:18:39] politics
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; or by public
[1:18:42] opinion.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; That can happen in a church.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's hard for me
[1:18:48] sometimes. I'm going to play a tape and
[1:18:51] I feel there's people that don't like
[1:18:52] you to play tapes. There people that
[1:18:54] believe in the live ministry. There's
[1:18:56] people that say we can listen to a tape
[1:18:58] anytime.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And there's all
[1:19:01] these voices.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You don't understand. But it it's hard
[1:19:06] when you sit back and you say this was
[1:19:08] the voice of God to this generation.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; What you heard this morning wasn't about
[1:19:15] mysteries. It was about the secrets of
[1:19:19] influence
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; and about the power.
[1:19:26] that your influence has
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; because he goes through a whole stretch
[1:19:31] here and talks about losing that power,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; losing that testimony, losing that
[1:19:38] influence and becoming becoming nothing
[1:19:43] and the way that you build your
[1:19:46] influence and build your testimony.
[1:19:50] And that's important to us as Christians
[1:19:54] because we have a commission to go into
[1:19:57] all the world and preach the gospel. Our
[1:20:00] purpose is to lead people to the Lord
[1:20:02] Jesus.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And if we if we don't have influence, if
[1:20:07] we don't have a life, if we don't have a
[1:20:10] testimony
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; and we lose that,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; then what's our value?
[1:20:21] And so he makes these statements. He
[1:20:23] says,
[1:20:26] he said, God com commissioned Joshua,
[1:20:29] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:20:32] out of thy mouth,
[1:20:34] but thou shalt meditate
[1:20:37] therein day and night, and then thou
[1:20:40] shalt make thy way prosperous, then thou
[1:20:44] shalt have good success.
[1:20:48] That's what makes you successful.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; We we we got sometimes we miss the whole
[1:20:55] key to success. The key the key to
[1:20:59] success if you keep the word of God,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; if you do what's honest and you do
[1:21:05] what's right. I know from business. I
[1:21:09] know from working from when I get a guy
[1:21:12] on the job and he's really hard to work
[1:21:15] and he's going to get in there and he's
[1:21:17] there to help. You don't have to time
[1:21:20] every time that you want to need help
[1:21:22] picking something up, you got to go find
[1:21:24] them. You know, he makes 15 trips to the
[1:21:27] bathroom. You you know what I mean? He
[1:21:30] he he lolly gags
[1:21:33] around and he he doesn't uh he he don't
[1:21:36] keep busy and he only does what he wants
[1:21:38] to do. That guy's not I'm not going to
[1:21:42] keeping him around the first time. I
[1:21:43] don't need him.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You look better going than you did
[1:21:48] coming.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But you get somebody that's there that's
[1:21:54] teachable,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; that can be corrected. That guy's got a
[1:21:58] job.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I know. Brotherando called me. He said,
[1:22:06] I said, "You still working out there? I
[1:22:08] thought you were supposed to run a
[1:22:09] backhoe." He said, "Yeah." He said, "But
[1:22:11] I sweep all the floors out here
[1:22:15] and I stack all the thing and I take out
[1:22:17] the trash. They don't want to get rid of
[1:22:20] me."
[1:22:22] That's how you get successful. Amen.
[1:22:24] Right.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; But you know, if you're lazy
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; and you don't you you're not you're not
[1:22:34] thinking about your influence.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; You're not thinking about going the
[1:22:38] extra mile,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; then then you don't generate success.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't be successful in
[1:22:48] your mind. You can sit down in your mind
[1:22:51] and have the greatest business plan, the
[1:22:54] greatest idea to do anything, but if you
[1:22:56] won't get out there to work to put that
[1:22:59] into effect,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; you won't put the hours in, you won't
[1:23:03] put the time in, you won't put the
[1:23:04] effort in, then you're a daydreamer.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; As we would say, you're a success in
[1:23:10] your own mind.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; So now we're thinking about influence
[1:23:17] today. We're thinking about wanting to
[1:23:19] go forward and that we read that thing.
[1:23:23] When you get when it comes into your
[1:23:25] mind, into your heart, it it develops
[1:23:28] the whole consciousness
[1:23:31] of God
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; that God's watching you.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Who sang that song? The unseen eye
[1:23:41] is watching you.
[1:23:45] I forget that. That's probably one of my
[1:23:47] biggest problems is sometimes I just
[1:23:50] forget that anybody's watching,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; but he's watching you, right? He says,
[1:23:55] not only that, but you're you influence
[1:23:58] somebody at the same way you're
[1:24:02] traveling.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; You influence people by the way you're
[1:24:06] traveling.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Have you ever asked yourself, "Where am
[1:24:10] I going?
[1:24:12] What way am I traveling?
[1:24:16] What's the travel of my life?
[1:24:21] Do you know what what's my journey?
[1:24:27] You know, the world don't want you to
[1:24:29] have a journey.
[1:24:31] They don't want you. You're running a
[1:24:33] race.
[1:24:34] You're going somewhere. You're traveling
[1:24:36] somewhere. This we're not just taking.
[1:24:39] We take one day the problems of one day
[1:24:42] at a time. We live one day at a time.
[1:24:45] That means we deal with the
[1:24:47] circumstances that approach us every
[1:24:50] day. We deal with that circumstance. We
[1:24:53] take care of that circumstance. We don't
[1:24:55] leave nothing for the other day. We get
[1:24:58] our lives right. We keep our lives
[1:25:00] straight. We make things right as we go
[1:25:03] because we're on we're traveling.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I like that song. I feel like traveling
[1:25:10] on.
[1:25:14] We're not setting up camp.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; We're traveling. And if if we lose the
[1:25:20] consciousness
[1:25:22] that we're in a journey, we lose the
[1:25:25] consciousness that God's watching us, we
[1:25:28] lose the consciousness about our
[1:25:30] influence that we're affecting people,
[1:25:33] then then sort of what happens to us, we
[1:25:36] we just sort of we seem to self
[1:25:40] non-exist.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You feel like you don't exist.
[1:25:50] You're you're just a part of society.
[1:25:53] You're just floating down just tossed to
[1:25:56] and fro by every wind of doctrine. You
[1:26:00] you lose your purpose for your life.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You lose the reason you're living.
[1:26:07] And when you you lose that, then you
[1:26:09] start to lose the joy of your salvation,
[1:26:12] right? and depression sets in and and
[1:26:15] all these other spirits get on you and
[1:26:18] and and then Satan starts lying to you
[1:26:22] that you're you're of no significance.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:26:28] you're the salt of the earth.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You're a candle lit and put on a hill.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; What did he say? He says, "Then you lose
[1:26:39] your power to make contact.
[1:26:46] You you can't contact people.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't you you you you
[1:26:54] just you you you get so he pushes you
[1:26:57] make you so insignificant
[1:27:00] that you you almost cease to exist
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; in your mind but you were placed here.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, there's so many of
[1:27:10] these quotes that are just flying off
[1:27:12] the page to me
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; as I I see the great picture
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; that he's drawing.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He he said here he said
[1:27:22] he said and so he's talking about
[1:27:23] influence and I thought this was such a
[1:27:25] great uh he was talking about that lady
[1:27:29] that had the makeup on. Remember now
[1:27:33] this listen what he said influence
[1:27:36] somebody started it.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Do you ever ask yourself where does this
[1:27:44] come from?
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Where did that start?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Who brought that in?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Things come into the church.
[1:27:57] Somebody brings it in. Maybe the
[1:27:59] minister misses it and and and he fails
[1:28:03] to speak out against it or or a trend
[1:28:06] gets in. You know, I there's a lot of
[1:28:09] things I don't like.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't like this these
[1:28:13] leotards that you put on that hang below
[1:28:16] your dress,
[1:28:19] you know. Now, I don't have a lot of
[1:28:21] word for that,
[1:28:24] but only I can say where did that come
[1:28:26] from?
[1:28:30] You got to pray about that.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; What kind of influence does it have?
[1:28:35] Where did you get that influence? Where
[1:28:37] did you pick that up? Did you see it on
[1:28:40] somebody? Somebody started it.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Did did was it appealing to you?
[1:28:49] What brought it on?
[1:28:52] You know, I think sometimes we we we we
[1:28:55] fail we fail to to see where the
[1:28:59] influence come. Where does it come from?
[1:29:01] What effect does it have? What what's it
[1:29:04] doing? We if we don't then we stop
[1:29:07] asking the questions that are necessary
[1:29:12] to try a spirit.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us that we've got to
[1:29:17] try every spirit.
[1:29:20] Where did this come from?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; What's the effect?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Not only what's the effect on others,
[1:29:30] but what's the effect on me?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And so it it gets started, things get
[1:29:39] started.
[1:29:41] And what happens when something gets
[1:29:43] started?
[1:29:44] Sometimes you got to go back and you got
[1:29:46] to correct it.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] That's right.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And if you don't take the correction of
[1:29:52] the word, we just heard you lose your
[1:29:55] testimony and your influence because the
[1:29:58] people will know that's what the word
[1:30:00] says and they'll know you're doing
[1:30:03] something contrary to the word
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and it affects
[1:30:11] I know how it is having a church. you'll
[1:30:14] have a visitor
[1:30:16] and maybe they don't know anything about
[1:30:20] our dress code. Maybe they don't know
[1:30:23] anything about uh how we approach
[1:30:26] service,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; but we're glad to have them
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; and they'll come out and and then
[1:30:35] there's always people and I hope you are
[1:30:37] friendly to them. Thank you. We're so
[1:30:39] happy to have you here. Sometimes I try
[1:30:41] to get out and see them if I can.
[1:30:44] and we want them to know they're welcome
[1:30:48] and then somebody will come on and say,
[1:30:51] "Oh, this person was this and this and
[1:30:53] that and that."
[1:30:57] It's just the way that it goes
[1:31:00] sometimes.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; But you you take he says, "But and so
[1:31:06] you see things come in. You you've got
[1:31:09] to you got to you got to look at things
[1:31:12] and understand where did that come from?
[1:31:15] Where did that start? Why are they in
[1:31:18] this condition?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what he said about that lady
[1:31:23] at the restaurant. He said she was a
[1:31:26] nice girl,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; polite,
[1:31:30] respectful.
[1:31:32] And he said, "Isn't it terrible that the
[1:31:36] devil
[1:31:38] conjured up something and put that,
[1:31:42] [cough and clears throat]
[1:31:43] excuse me, and put that on American
[1:31:47] women?
[1:31:48] Where did it start? Where did it come
[1:31:52] from? How did it get on us?"
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; He always said it this way. I I I know
[1:31:58] how the sheep got out, but how did the
[1:32:00] goats get in?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And he's talking on down here and he
[1:32:06] says,
[1:32:08] he said, "Don't you never go by what?"
[1:32:13] Someone see somebody of this country, I
[1:32:17] don't care, or other country or some
[1:32:20] minister's wife or somebody. Don't you
[1:32:23] never be influenced by them.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; You let the Bible influence you to the
[1:32:29] things that's right.
[1:32:33] right there.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; When you see something and you say,
[1:32:38] "Well, I like that dress. I like how
[1:32:41] that fits. I like how that looks. I like
[1:32:43] that look."
[1:32:46] Now, I I can tell you right out, you
[1:32:49] know, when they get those little teeny
[1:32:51] narrow cuffs down here like that, you
[1:32:53] know what I mean? And they wear those
[1:32:55] skinny little tight pants that look like
[1:32:58] a man's been in some sort of gym
[1:33:00] somewhere, you know, like he's watched
[1:33:02] too many Aerrol Flynn movies. And and uh
[1:33:05] that might be too
[1:33:07] out for you. But they they wear these
[1:33:09] the guys wearing these little tight
[1:33:11] stuff and or their pants hanging all
[1:33:14] down their hips and everything. It
[1:33:16] started somewhere.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And you're being influenced by it.
[1:33:24] Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Look at the Bible.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Take these godly men. Let our messenger
[1:33:33] be our example.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; There's some godly sister, some godly
[1:33:39] brother that you can run them through
[1:33:41] the scriptures. Be what's influencing.
[1:33:44] But you know what he says? They do it.
[1:33:47] It becomes all right.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; It just becomes acceptable.
[1:33:55] Now he said here, not only does that
[1:33:57] happen to the individual, it happens to
[1:34:00] groups of people.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It happens to churches.
[1:34:08] We get influenced.
[1:34:12] In other words, something has the power
[1:34:15] over what we believe.
[1:34:18] Can you imagine influence changing your
[1:34:21] belief?
[1:34:24] It's hard to hold the line sometimes
[1:34:27] because sometimes you might feel like
[1:34:29] you're isolated. But listen to what he
[1:34:31] says here.
[1:34:33] He says, "God don't tolerate that
[1:34:35] stuff." And brother, how could God
[1:34:37] tolerate such a thing as that when he's
[1:34:40] against it? He says so in his word. And
[1:34:43] our woman has become in our churches in
[1:34:47] such a mere practice many times of
[1:34:50] dressing sex appeal.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:34:58] where did high heels come from?
[1:35:04] High heels were invented to give women
[1:35:08] sex appeal.
[1:35:15] Now, I I know some of you sisters may
[1:35:17] have never heard that,
[1:35:20] [clears throat]
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; but there's days I want to change the
[1:35:22] name of this church to High Heel
[1:35:24] Tabernacle.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, the deacon's
[1:35:33] wife's wearing high heels and she sees
[1:35:36] that person do it and another sister
[1:35:38] says she's wearing it. You know, our
[1:35:40] messenger told us, you can't walk on
[1:35:43] this highway in those heels.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And anything that's starting to lift you
[1:35:54] up,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; the idea is so this backside gets
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; a little better shape
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; and it pushes you out.
[1:36:10] We might as well be honest.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's sex appeal.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; It's of the devil
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and somebody started it
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; and somebody saw somebody else do it
[1:36:26] just like he said. Some minister's wife
[1:36:28] somewhere cut her hair
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and the next sister said and they
[1:36:33] started coming up with all the excuses.
[1:36:36] It's not in my eyes. I can't worship
[1:36:38] with hair fall in my eyes. Well, since
[1:36:41] when do you worship in your hair?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You worship from your heart.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And then you get all kinds of excuses
[1:36:49] and then you start selling
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; your belief
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and your reasoning.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; This is the reason we do that. That's
[1:36:59] the reason. Oh, sister such and such,
[1:37:02] brother such was a, you know, I I
[1:37:04] thought a little lady was the prophet of
[1:37:06] God. He preached everything under the
[1:37:08] sun. He thought of sin. And this lady
[1:37:10] comes up and took Brother Bram's hand,
[1:37:12] said, "Oh, thank you very much. What a
[1:37:14] wonderful sermon. You didn't touch me."
[1:37:16] And Brother Bram said, "That must have
[1:37:18] been some sately woman."
[1:37:21] And then the brother said, "Well,
[1:37:23] Brother Brand, you covered everything
[1:37:24] but gossip,
[1:37:27] and that's the biggest gossiper in the
[1:37:29] whole church."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; See, these things are influences. That's
[1:37:35] right.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Now, that sister's not going to take off
[1:37:38] high heels
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; until she gets a revelation
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; that
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; she saw high heels.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; They put it on the store.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; They put it in the ad. She saw it
[1:37:52] somewhere.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Where did they come from?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:38:03] I don't know when
[1:38:05] when when it the fashion even came in,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; but it started somewhere.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Just like piercing.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Well, we know that's a heathen thing.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The word of God says it's heathen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I go out to eat, have a nice waitress
[1:38:24] and everything. She's got one of those
[1:38:26] big things in her nose hanging down. I
[1:38:29] can't look at her because I'll lose my
[1:38:31] appetite. She said, "What would you
[1:38:33] like?" comes in.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like two over easy.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; It started somewhere.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; When you see something,
[1:38:52] even though it's appealing, [snorts] you
[1:38:54] got to ask yourself, where does this
[1:38:56] come from?
[1:38:57] You know, a lot of the songs we sing, if
[1:38:59] we ever took it back to the artist,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; we ever took it back who wrote it,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; we might have a second opinion
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; cuz we don't want to carry the
[1:39:13] influence.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; We don't want to give our amen to it.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; But you understand we've we've that
[1:39:23] filter has left the church.
[1:39:28] But if we're going to go forward
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; and we're going to have have a testimony
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; and we're going to have influence,
[1:39:39] then we've got to know
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; what's influencing us.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; We got to understand
[1:39:50] those things. So we know that that's
[1:39:52] when it comes it it becomes uh it
[1:39:56] becomes you know and they they get it
[1:39:59] and he says very seldom ever spoke
[1:40:02] against
[1:40:03] from the pulpit.
[1:40:06] He says secial very seldom ever spoke
[1:40:10] about from the pulpit
[1:40:12] and if it's not it keeps coming in.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Our dresses get tight.
[1:40:22] Now, I know if you're raised in a
[1:40:24] tradition in the country,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; you know, I I've been to a lot of
[1:40:31] weddings.
[1:40:35] You know what I mean?
[1:40:37] And you know what I feel about this
[1:40:39] dancing at weddings? I'll make it
[1:40:41] public. If you're going to dance at your
[1:40:45] reception,
[1:40:47] you cannot use this church. and I will
[1:40:50] not marry you.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; End of story.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And I don't understand it
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; cuz I've been to them. And the
[1:41:01] Christians are out there dancing. Their
[1:41:04] unbelieving uncles out there dancing.
[1:41:06] Their unbelieving aunts out there does.
[1:41:08] There are unbelieving cousins are out
[1:41:10] there dancing. It's believers and
[1:41:12] unbelievers all mixed together doing one
[1:41:16] bugaloo.
[1:41:20] boy. And you talk about the fashion
[1:41:22] show,
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; the high heels come out,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; the dresses get so tight they look like
[1:41:30] they've been shrink wrapped on
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; and you we start allowing it
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and then it becomes the influence and it
[1:41:42] becomes a tradition and it becomes okay.
[1:41:47] is not okay.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; God don't like it.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; He says it right here.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And we get to thinking just because we
[1:41:58] dance in the spirit and shout in the
[1:42:00] spirit and we praise God that it makes
[1:42:04] it okay.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He says it right here. He says, he says,
[1:42:13] "And yet," he says, "Sex appeal is very
[1:42:16] seldom spoke of against the Paul, but
[1:42:18] and yet
[1:42:20] we shout and jump around and speak in
[1:42:23] tongues." That's the reason that this
[1:42:26] great move of Pentecost is not getting
[1:42:30] anywhere. It's because there's no
[1:42:32] sincerity behind it.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; It's becomes an emotion.
[1:42:39] Another
[1:42:44] it loses
[1:42:46] the discernment
[1:42:50] to recognize
[1:42:53] influence.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; That's the secret to the greatest battle
[1:42:58] ever fought. Do you understand that?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Right? Satan brings the accusation.
[1:43:05] If you believe it,
[1:43:08] it becomes real
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; and it gains power.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; If you refuse it, you refuse to let the
[1:43:17] accusation influence you.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be influenced.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Satan is is Satan gives threats.
[1:43:30] Right?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; You'll lose your job,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Well, if you believe that, now that's
[1:43:39] going to influence you and you're going
[1:43:42] to readjust your behavior to keep that
[1:43:45] job.
[1:43:48] Wouldn't it be wonderful in a real
[1:43:50] Christian attitude, you could look your
[1:43:52] boss right in the face
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; and say, you know, God gave me this job
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; and before I lose this job, you will be
[1:44:00] gone.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying ugly.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Do you have that confidence?
[1:44:16] to have that assurity
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; just to know
[1:44:24] and have that awareness
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; that you're not going to let outside
[1:44:30] influences start working on you.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we're fools to compare
[1:44:37] ourselves one with another. In other
[1:44:40] words, we're fools to let one another
[1:44:43] influence ourselves outside of the word
[1:44:46] of God.
[1:44:50] That's the truth.
[1:44:54] I might be getting long. I'm going to
[1:44:56] close up now. And he says this. He says,
[1:44:59] "Now,
[1:45:01] I'm not trying to be different.
[1:45:04] It's trying to be sincere. Right.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I believe that we're in the last days
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and we got a great message,
[1:45:13] but all of our our shouting and speaking
[1:45:17] tongues will be of no effect.
[1:45:21] You can see it among us.
[1:45:24] You can't see that we're growing in
[1:45:27] numbers, but but are we growing in
[1:45:31] power?
[1:45:32] We're still on the same grounds that we
[1:45:35] were when we started 40 years ago.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; We should already be over in the
[1:45:41] promised land.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, have have we gained power?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; How about power to discern
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; between good and evil? Hebrews
[1:45:56] 5:14 that you're babes not able to
[1:46:00] discern between good and evil, not ready
[1:46:03] for strong milk. Our power to discern,
[1:46:07] wait a minute, what's the influence of
[1:46:09] this? Where does it come from? Where did
[1:46:11] it get started?
[1:46:15] Have you ever seen fashions?
[1:46:20] I got boxes and boxes of ties because I
[1:46:23] know those big ones are going to come
[1:46:24] back.
[1:46:30] Isn't that what they say? Just wait a
[1:46:32] while, it'll be back in fashion.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; You know what? We ought to have our own
[1:46:37] fashion.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; We ought to have a godly look. I don't
[1:46:43] care what color. You know, I'm not
[1:46:45] trying to clone everybody, but there
[1:46:49] ought there ought to be a way that your
[1:46:51] dresses fall that are modest.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; That your tops aren't so tight,
[1:47:00] that your sleeves aren't way up to your
[1:47:04] shoulders and your neck lines are
[1:47:06] decent, guys. That you're that you know
[1:47:09] you're you're neat and you're clean.
[1:47:15] You know what I mean? You you at least
[1:47:17] get your button up to the at least the
[1:47:19] one before the top. You know, you don't
[1:47:21] got four or five buttons hanging down
[1:47:23] like you think you're Tarzan or
[1:47:25] something.
[1:47:29] It's all influence. Right.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I would be remissed
[1:47:36] as a pastor
[1:47:39] if we didn't understand that this is the
[1:47:42] path forward.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; The church keeping the influence of the
[1:47:49] world out.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And you've got to help one another do
[1:47:58] that.
[1:48:00] The Bible says, "You older sisters,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; go to the youngers, teach them how to be
[1:48:05] good wives. You hear a sister talking
[1:48:08] about her husband, you ought to pull her
[1:48:10] aside. Don't you ever, ever, ever talk
[1:48:13] about your husband
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; to nobody.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Let me say it from here. Don't you ever,
[1:48:21] ever, ever,
[1:48:24] not even to the one sister
[1:48:27] that you promises you,
[1:48:30] she won't tell nobody.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; She's already got the list
[1:48:38] because she's got somebody that doesn't
[1:48:41] tell somebody.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't tell somebody? Who doesn't
[1:48:44] tell somebody?
[1:48:48] And if somebody starts probing,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; asking questions,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; trying to get to the heart of the
[1:48:56] matter, you discern right away. That's a
[1:49:00] devil.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; None of your business.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Did me and Lesie fight this morning?
[1:49:12] None of your business.
[1:49:20] The best and worst is where
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; at home.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Where does it live? You leave it at
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; home.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You make it right
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; at home.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Don't let that influence. It's a
[1:49:39] terrible influence. the bridling the
[1:49:42] tongue is one of the hardest things to
[1:49:43] do. We're just closing up. He says
[1:49:50] and we know that we're in Lady Oia
[1:49:57] and he he he mentions this way the way
[1:50:01] up is down.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[1:50:06] Anytime you feel that you start getting
[1:50:10] lifted up on your inside, check yourself
[1:50:13] real quick.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Give the glory to the Lord.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; I know we desire recognition.
[1:50:23] It's our human nature.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said we all like
[1:50:27] compliments.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; We all like the here.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Give out compliments
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; and stay humble.
[1:50:38] He said whole churches can get to to
[1:50:41] think that that there's something
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; that we've got to move or we've got the
[1:50:46] doctrine or we've got the truth. When
[1:50:49] you get that way, things start slipping
[1:50:51] in.
[1:50:53] you start taking stands,
[1:50:57] you know, and you start developing
[1:51:00] uh certain areas that you're going to be
[1:51:04] dominant in and that you're going to put
[1:51:06] all the emphasis on, whether it's music,
[1:51:09] whether it's a a certain doctrine,
[1:51:14] and then if nobody else has a revelation
[1:51:17] you have, then you know they're kind of
[1:51:20] a lesser value. or we put it on numbers.
[1:51:26] Numbers, he just told us numbers don't
[1:51:28] mean anything.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; All numbers means is it's easier for
[1:51:37] people to hide in the crowd.
[1:51:42] It's it's it's a lot harder if you're
[1:51:45] sitting in a sermon with six people and
[1:51:48] they're preaching three kinds of
[1:51:50] believers.
[1:51:56] numbers don't mean anything.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You know, our brothers here, I I
[1:52:02] appreciate them so much. They go to a
[1:52:04] lot of the smaller churches.
[1:52:08] They'll travel a long ways for 20, for
[1:52:11] 30, for 10, for 15. Why? Because it's
[1:52:15] not the number, it's the soul.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:19] It's the body.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; The whole body benefits.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; A person gets
[1:52:26] healed or delivered in Denver, the whole
[1:52:29] body is blessed.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Billy's going up to
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; St. John's Island in the Antarctic.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; We've been telling him, Billy, it's
[1:52:42] awful cold there.
[1:52:44] What's the weather forecast? Well, it's
[1:52:47] the high is 31 with rain. Well, when
[1:52:51] it's 31, that rain isn't Texas rain.
[1:52:56] It's mushy, wet, sloppy sleep.
[1:53:02] Still going to go.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I warned them.
[1:53:09] Why?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? Well, there's
[1:53:11] only 50 up there. There's only a
[1:53:13] hundred. No.
[1:53:16] The kingdom of God is worth one soul.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; One,
[1:53:24] [snorts]
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; are you conscious
[1:53:29] of your influence?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; God's got a pattern. That's
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; So, you know, and and what happens if
[1:53:42] you get lifted up? You you you think you
[1:53:45] can do everything.
[1:53:48] You try to take somebody else's place.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; We all have a calling.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; So, there's two questions I'm asking
[1:54:02] this morning.
[1:54:04] What path are you traveling?
[1:54:07] And are you aware of your calling?
[1:54:14] God called you.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Our messenger said remain in the calling
[1:54:19] where he called you. The spirits you're
[1:54:22] in, the things you do, the people you
[1:54:25] contact.
[1:54:27] We don't have any ladder to climb.
[1:54:31] I think it was Elena told Darien that uh
[1:54:35] you know he climbed up a ladder and he
[1:54:37] fell and broke his wrist. She says,
[1:54:40] "Darren, you you climbed the wrong
[1:54:43] ladder. You're supposed to be climbing
[1:54:45] Jacob's ladder.
[1:54:48] We're not climbing a ladder here.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to heaven.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; God placed you. Wherever you are, the
[1:55:00] people you're around,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; that's the influence.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; That that you're a shining light right
[1:55:07] there. You want to influence your
[1:55:10] office. You want to influence your job
[1:55:12] site. You want to influence where you go
[1:55:14] to the grocery store. I've told you the
[1:55:17] story. We sat in the living room and at
[1:55:20] at Leslie's brother-in-law,
[1:55:24] Danny Beasel, his his grandfather was
[1:55:27] there. And I sat down. He was reading
[1:55:30] his Bible. And I said, "That's
[1:55:31] wonderful. Where are you reading?" and
[1:55:34] and he said uh uh I think his last name
[1:55:37] was Gernzie and he said I I I'm reading
[1:55:41] here he's I said where are you from? He
[1:55:43] said I'm from Jeffersonville.
[1:55:45] Jeffersonville, Indiana.
[1:55:48] I said that's wonderful. I said did did
[1:55:51] you know William Brandham? He says yes I
[1:55:54] was brother Brandham's dry cleaner.
[1:55:58] I dry dry cleananed all his suits. I
[1:56:01] thought, can you imagine? No wonder the
[1:56:04] guy's sitting there, how many years old,
[1:56:05] blessed, reading his Bible. He'd be
[1:56:07] grabbing them suits. You know what I
[1:56:10] mean? Well, I'd love just to have, you
[1:56:13] know what I mean? If
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I I put a one of brother
[1:56:18] Bram's tithes on one time and went and
[1:56:21] preached that the most anointed sermon I
[1:56:23] ever had in my life.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And he's blessed,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; right? And I so I asked him, he said,
[1:56:31] "But Ram was the kindest, most gentlest
[1:56:33] man I ever met.
[1:56:37] Never complained." I thought,
[1:56:40] "Influence."
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; You don't even know the effect that you
[1:56:48] have. How important is us to keep a good
[1:56:51] spirit,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; to keep a happy spirit,
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; to let the joy of the Lord,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; not to get down.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the devil.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; God had ordained a certain thing to be
[1:57:07] done and it must be done that way. We're
[1:57:11] not to interject our own ideas. We're to
[1:57:14] respect his ideas and his commandments.
[1:57:18] And he goes on and he talks about God
[1:57:21] has a pattern in his Bible and that's
[1:57:25] what we've got to stay with. And so
[1:57:28] we'll just we'll just close up. He says,
[1:57:30] "Now watch my brethren. Be careful
[1:57:33] because no matter how much God has
[1:57:35] filled you with his spirit [snorts] and
[1:57:38] how much that you have done and how well
[1:57:43] you've been blessed. You stay with the
[1:57:47] calling of God. Don't get off on some
[1:57:51] tradition or organizational scheme and
[1:57:54] so forth. You better come back to the
[1:57:56] path. better come back to what God laid
[1:58:00] down at the beginning. And and that that
[1:58:06] really
[1:58:09] let's go back to the message,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; back to the word of God, back to what
[1:58:15] we're built on. I have to say it.
[1:58:18] There's been a lot of influences
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; in the message today. A lot of song
[1:58:24] trends, a lot of music trends, a lot of
[1:58:28] dress trends, a lot of things have come
[1:58:34] and and
[1:58:37] I don't have the ability
[1:58:40] to catch everything,
[1:58:42] to hear everything, or to see
[1:58:45] everything.
[1:58:47] And as the years
[1:58:49] begin to pile up and the
[1:58:54] days of my life are being taken off till
[1:58:59] my appointed time.
[1:59:03] What a lot of times you can do what you
[1:59:07] used to be able to do in the flesh, you
[1:59:09] can't do anymore.
[1:59:12] But you hope that the people around you
[1:59:19] understand the word of God enough
[1:59:22] that they're going to hold a standard
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; that they're going to gain the
[1:59:28] consciousness
[1:59:30] of the word of God and they're going to
[1:59:33] ask the question, where did this come
[1:59:35] from? Somebody started it. When did this
[1:59:39] come in? When did we start doing that?
[1:59:42] And run it back. School,
[1:59:46] children in school. School's a very
[1:59:49] difficult place.
[1:59:53] Lot of influence.
[1:59:56] Parents, watch your children.
[1:59:59] Listen.
[2:00:04] Children, don't hide something that
[2:00:07] [snorts]
[2:00:08] you know is right. Don't sneak in your
[2:00:10] closet to watch and listen to things
[2:00:13] that if it's contrary to what mom and
[2:00:16] dad's telling you. That's something
[2:00:18] that's trying to influence you,
[2:00:22] trying to get you to go a certain way,
[2:00:24] make decisions.
[2:00:26] All it ends up is it makes you
[2:00:28] rebellious
[2:00:30] and you're you're fighting. How many
[2:00:33] young girls have listened to to
[2:00:37] uh some young boy sweet talk them
[2:00:42] and they have no real intentions,
[2:00:46] have no honor,
[2:00:48] you know? I mean, they they they they
[2:00:50] stay away from your parents. A guy
[2:00:53] that's got really good honor. The
[2:00:55] prophet of God said that you never go
[2:00:59] pick up a girl and honk your horn.
[2:01:03] You know why he said that?
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "You go to the front door.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You meet the dad.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; You look in the eye. You say, "Sir, I'm
[2:01:13] taking your daughter to dinner. I'll
[2:01:16] have her home at 8:00. I'll treat her
[2:01:19] respectful."
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; What happened to that?
[2:01:27] When do when do we start becoming sneaks
[2:01:31] in the night?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; What happened to our our dignity,
[2:01:38] our our morals, and our honesty?
[2:01:45] Because the only thing that's going to
[2:01:48] attack it
[2:01:50] is the devil.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Because the devil is trying to influence
[2:01:56] So, if he can influence us, and I I was
[2:02:00] going to get into that maybe this
[2:02:01] evening, but if he can get into that,
[2:02:06] you heard our messenger say it destroys
[2:02:08] our influence and our testimony and it
[2:02:12] makes us powerless.
[2:02:15] And what is the one thing Satan wants to
[2:02:19] do is make the word of God of none
[2:02:23] effect.
[2:02:24] And that's why we said you can't put
[2:02:26] faith in the lie.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Stay with
[2:02:33] the truth
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; and and and and be mindful. And that
[2:02:39] message influence it struck me because I
[2:02:42] I begin to realize that
[2:02:48] if you don't know how he's doing it,
[2:02:53] you can see that something's wrong
[2:02:57] and you can say that's wrong. But you
[2:03:00] got to be careful that he didn't plant a
[2:03:02] seed
[2:03:04] to get you to start to think
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; and then he comes back why is it wrong
[2:03:12] and you start to reason
[2:03:15] because he said so that settles it. And
[2:03:20] I believe if our messenger says how many
[2:03:23] times did he preach influence five
[2:03:26] times? six times. It had to be a major
[2:03:31] a major event. So, Satan is trying to
[2:03:35] influence.
[2:03:37] Let's stand against the influence.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Let's resist the accusation.
[2:03:44] Let's don't put faith in anything but
[2:03:48] God's word.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Let's stay with it. Ask yourself
[2:03:53] what what is it that I'm presenting?
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Sisters, ask yourself when you look in
[2:04:00] the mirror, are you trying to adjust the
[2:04:03] way you look so you look better? In
[2:04:07] whose eyes?
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; The eyes of the world.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Or are you going to let your character
[2:04:14] shine?
[2:04:19] because you won't take this body with
[2:04:21] you.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; The only thing you're going to take with
[2:04:24] you is your character.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; You know, you think, you know, you can
[2:04:31] look in the mirror and think you're
[2:04:32] handsome.
[2:04:34] You know what I mean? And put on the
[2:04:36] certain smell
[2:04:39] that you think uh is going to just catch
[2:04:43] the [snorts] scent of the lady.
[2:04:48] You know, they got all those lying
[2:04:50] advertisements out there, you know,
[2:04:52] where all the girls are flocking to a
[2:04:54] certain smell.
[2:04:56] Well, just to let you know, if it came
[2:04:59] to money or smell, the woman will take
[2:05:02] the money.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But a Christian woman will take the
[2:05:11] character. Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; She would rather have a good, honest,
[2:05:18] providing man
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; that loves her and loves her children
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; than she would anything else.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; A real sister wants spiritual
[2:05:32] leadership.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody will grab the Bible and lay the
[2:05:36] foundations of Christianity, whether he
[2:05:39] looks like Prince Charming or not. Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Because she's got one promise. If he
[2:05:45] isn't good-looking here, God will make
[2:05:47] him good-looking over there.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And we need to get back
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; to the reality of influence.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. I don't know
[2:06:00] what time it is, but maybe a little
[2:06:02] longer. Uh Lord be with you. It's a
[2:06:05] wonderful message. If you'd like to go
[2:06:08] study it again, influence your power to
[2:06:12] influence.
[2:06:14] What's influencing you? The power
[2:06:19] to change
[2:06:21] somebody's belief, decisions, or
[2:06:25] actions. What's affecting your actions?
[2:06:29] May it be God's word. God bless you if
[2:06:32] you come lead in some worship this
[2:06:33] morning. Thank you so much. God richly
[2:06:36] bless you. Hope you enjoyed the message
[2:06:38] this morning.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:49] Man, how many wants to be influenced by
[2:06:51] the word?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be even for one
[2:06:55] another, we want to be the right kind of
[2:06:58] influence. Let's all stand this morning.
[2:07:00] I believe we could just look in our own
[2:07:02] hearts this morning and say, "Lord, let
[2:07:04] your word have an effect on me this
[2:07:06] morning. What I heard, what our pastor
[2:07:09] talked about, Lord, I just want that to
[2:07:11] work in myself that it may produce what
[2:07:14] you want me to be." Amen. I feel
[2:07:19] the [singing]
[2:07:20] boom.

[2:15:04] We love you with all our hearts.
[2:15:09] We love you with all our soul.
[2:15:13] But but [music]
[2:15:14] father you know how the mind
[2:15:18] have been [music]
[2:15:20] associated with the devil.
[2:15:24] [music] He will come as the prophet said
[2:15:27] the battle is in the mind.
[2:15:32] You come to show us what is contrary to
[2:15:34] your will
[2:15:37] so we can win
[2:15:40] over us.
[2:15:43] But we are your children.
[2:15:48] He has no power any claim [music]
[2:15:50] on us.
[2:15:54] Father, if you have a desire here
[2:15:57] is to believe the word and glorify you
[2:16:00] in everything we do.
[2:16:04] Father, if you have fell somewhere,
[2:16:08] look us through the blood
[2:16:11] [music]
[2:16:12] and receive us. Father,
[2:16:17] we really really want to be influenced
[2:16:19] [music] by your word.
[2:16:24] For the word is the only thing
[2:16:28] that can even lift up our faith to see
[2:16:32] your will for us.
[2:16:38] Father, pray for our pastor.
[2:16:41] Bless him, Father.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Bless his family.
[2:16:45] Bless us together as we will leave this
[2:16:47] place.
[2:16:50] May your love shine upon each one of
[2:16:53] [music] us.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; I humbly pray in the name of our Lord
[2:16:58] Jesus Christ we say. Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you with this mystery
[2:17:07] [music] of earth. Amen.
[2:17:10] My heavenly
[2:17:13] home [singing and music] is bright and
