can come amen hmm you know i didn't raise my hand but i do have a testimony so i'm just gonna share it you know like brother billy said 2020 has been a year that we don't even want to remember um it just passed by so quick a lot of things happened but i just want to thank the lord for his protection over me and my family and our lives and my family's lives because there was a lot of times where we didn't know or we weren't prepared but you know we were exposed around people that had the c19 as it's called now or covet and just the grace of god we we didn't we didn't we didn't have anything and uh that for me that's a testimony not that i'm any better than anybody else but you know his grace just protected me and my family and i thank him for that um so you know that's just something to rejoice about and my second testimony um you know just a little while ago we were taking the train with the kids and we took the station from ironhorse and we went to grapevine and on our way back um you know i left my phone on the train well you know just like any train if you lose anything you're just never going to get it back because it's never the same train that comes back around so they have four or five just going around and you know i had a lot of stuff on that phone and a lot of business stuff and passwords that i don't remember a lot of passwords and um you know it was really something in my heart i was like you know what i'm i'm gonna just wait i'm just gonna wait until the next train comes around it's just 15 minutes i'm going to see maybe maybe if he comes back they might have my phone so i sit and as i was sitting i was praying train sure enough comes and um i asked the guy i'm like hey do you guys see a phone on the train he's like man i'm sorry you know when things like things happen you gotta go all the way to carrollton and they have a box and they put all the stuff they find in the box and good luck it's just you don't find anything like that anymore it's just so i was like okay no problem so i go home and uh you know we're getting ready for bed and you know i have a secondary phone which is for um work and i called it a couple of times maybe somebody might pick up whoever found it and sure enough they did it so i called it again called it again and nothing i'm like okay so it's lost i'm just gonna go online and and just claim it lost and so you know within my heart you know i was really praying and i was really asking the lord lord you know this is this is just an earthly thing but you know it it has an importance for me because i have a lot of stuff on there that i can't get back or maybe i might have to go through a lot of process to get this back and i said a quick prayer you know sure enough i fell asleep and about 11 30 my phone rings my work phone not not the one that i lost the other one and there's the guy calls and says hey man um i have your phone okay he's like i found it on the train you know this usually doesn't happen but i've seen you called a couple times so i don't know if you're the owner of the phone or not and uh but i want to meet you and give you your phone i'm like okay so yeah you know if somebody was to find some things and it was mine i you know i would want somebody to do the same for me so i just i just feel like i need to give you the phone back i'm like okay well where can i meet you i asked him he's like oh no where can i meet you he asked me that like well can you meet me at this gas station like sure i'll be there in five minutes sure enough i pull up and he pulls up on his work truck and just gives me his the phone is like here you go man still a young 20 or you know 20 year old young guy and and uh you know i you know in everything that we do we always we always have to find some purpose like okay lord am i supposed to say something to this guy now i'm like should i pray with him what do you want me to do so i'm like man you know i really want to know that that what do you what do you do you know it's like well you know just a couple minute conversation i'm like i'll say this thank you so much for doing this i prayed about it and i know this this usually doesn't happen and uh you know the lord you know just blessed you to bless me to bring my phone back and he's like yeah no problem man you know just it's just what it is but you know for for me just a small little thing like that that we might call something normal for me is a miracle because something that i needed at that time the lord just might have put something on that on that guy's heart and he's like you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna for some reason this phone is to get back to where it is so for me that's a testimony and uh you know i praise the lord for it and uh you know i he still works even in these little things for me just gives me a boost of faith and just to believe so brother david asked me a while back he's like cosmin you got to get that according back out so i'm i'm dusting it off now and i'm playing we're playing tonight [Music] so [Music] and the mountains in reply echoing their joyous strains [Music] in exchange [Music] oh [Music] christ the lord the newborn king's

never comes to an end new every morning great is thy faithfulness oh [Music] of the lord and never sees us his mercy never comes to an end all there are near every morning new every morning all great is that faithfulness god bless you um i just want to give a short testimony and this is kind of hard for me but um i think most of you know that i have progressive hearing loss and i go get hearing tests done once a year and i had not gone for like a year and a half and i noticed i was kind of missing a lot and like i have a hard time listening to tapes like brother brandon because i miss a lot so i have to read along and then in the preaching i noticed i was missing like every 10 words and i was just like i know faith comes by hearing and i'm like having a hard time hearing in church so i was like lord this is a struggle but um it's like i need to go get my hearing tested and i for some reason just wasn't getting there within that year period and just last week i went and it was the lord i went there got my hearing tested and surprisingly they said it hadn't dropped that much and sometimes it's pretty drastic so i was like praising the lord for that and then after he was done doing the test he said you know as soon as you walked in i feel like you're the perfect candidate we're giving away these free hearing aids and they're like the top-notch highest quality hearing aid that you can get and you can stream on it you can answer phone calls from your hearing aid and everything and so they're like you just have to be able to like give a review and talk about it and so i was like okay i'll try it out and yesterday i listened to a sermon for my hearing aids and it was like crystal clear i could hear every word and i was praising god and then like the service i could actually hear billy's prayer request i normally can't hear a word of that and i was like praise the lord i can hear brother billy and i can hear you know the ministers and it was just such a blessing to me because the reason why i want my hearing is so i can hear the word and i was like thank you lord and i know he's my healer so i'm waiting for the full manifestation of that praise the lord amen brother tommy has a testimony like to give if it could come at this time yeah i'll keep it short as well but you know i was sitting in my pew and uh just pondering over 2020 how everybody's saying it's so bad and then i got to thinking i'm like you know what 2020 was kind of rough but as a back i had a lot of good things happen for me in 2020 and one was god healed me two my son gave his life to the lord i haven't seen him in church but i know he's coming three he he gave me a house a home which i'm i'm working on right now and i've had help from brother david and a lot of brothers in church and i appreciate all the help but the lord has done a lot for me in 2020 even though i got beat up by the devil a little bit i'm still winning the battle so thank you amen let's invite brother samuel and the wife and the family to come at this time and sing a special amen if they could come at this time god bless you we want to sing hallelujah in swahili amen [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] um [Applause] [Music] um [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] i'm [Music] hallelujah amen amen how do we praise the lord amen amen sister nikki has a special and if she could come at this time okay god bless everyone as you know i'm always nervous when i get up here and i wasn't going to say anything but it helps me calm my nerves and then listen to brother cosman's testimony i said well if i testify now i know we have watch night service coming up what am i going to say then but the lord has been so good i'll have something else to say by then too i was on a zoom call with some of my family members last night and i loved them dearly but a lot of my family this whole year has been living in complete fear for the virus and completely shut down everything that they normally would do and one of my um cousins who live up in maryland she was telling me that even on her whole block nobody is decorating and anything and she thinks it's because they're so discouraged because everything that's went on plus the fact that so many people lost their jobs they just can't afford to be festive and celebrate and i just want to thank the lord because during this whole outbreak um we just carried on as we did our daily lives we went on vacations and had fellowship with everybody and still went to the grocery store and i mean i don't know who i came in contact with i don't know who had it i probably had it and didn't even know it but i'm just so grateful to the lord that he has protected us in this all i have my niece and my nephews this summer and we didn't ski skip a beat we wanted to let them have a good time in dallas and i think they can testify and say they had a good time they met new friends they did a whole lot so i'm just grateful that god has not given us the spirit of fear but he has given us the spirit of power and of love and of sound mind i'm so nervous but this is the old congregational song musicians i hope you can find me i never know what key i'm singing in i'll probably make up some keys too but to the glory of god where do i go when there's no one to turn to who do i talk to [Music] when there's no one to listen who do i lean on when there's no firm foundation i go to the rock i know he is able

has a testimony if she could come at this time amen god bless you this is very hard for me to get up and talk in front of adults um many of you know i've been a preschool teacher for over 17 years you put me in a classroom four-year-olds and i'm fine um in september of 2019 we were having a staff meeting and um every year i worked at a christian school and um every year our director would have us to she wanted us to pray and have god to place a verse on our heart that would be our verse for that year and she would print those verses out and put him in our break room so that everyone could have something to read and maybe bless them you know throughout the year well i was praying and the lord laid isaiah 26 3 on my heart you think i have it memorized i do but i got to read it that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on me because he trusteth in me and i put a reminder on my phone every morning at seven o'clock and that verse has popped up on my phone in 2020 hit our school like all the other schools were close we went we were shut down in march and in june we had a staff meeting and they closed our school i lost my job and it was a gut punch but i have to tell you that for about two years i've been praying that god would work out a way where i didn't have to work anymore god answers your prayers in mysterious ways um i can't say that i wasn't upset and i cried several days but i had a peace i had this verse and i didn't know what i was going to do i didn't know how we were really going to make it and then i had a couple of families that i've had their kids in preschool they were cousins and they called me and asked me in the fall to come and help facilitate their children's virtual learning they were going through the school district and all i had to do was show up eight o'clock in the morning get them on their zoom calls make sure they're doing their assignments um and then one of the parents that all four of their parents worked and then one of the parents would show up at 12 and relieve me and that's all i had to do and and it was probably a temporary thing well two weeks ago they came to me and said we're gonna send our kids back to school after christmas so here i am again but i've got that piece we're going to be okay god's already placed that on my heart tim and i've talked about it and he's you know he's told me he said monday now we've been praying that there'd be a way that you didn't have to work and we're just trusting him you know god does work in mysterious ways and i'm not up here to ask for a pity or anything like that because i just i cover your prayers it's going to be tough for us for the next couple months but i think god has shown us a way already and i just thank the lord so much for all of you that have been praying for me i know some of you've already heard this in fact i sat and talked to sister heidi australian today and told them and um i came in here and i was like you know lord this is just a little testimony it's not may not be much to somebody else but i wasn't even going to do it and when sister nicky got up here was talking about her family and saying you know god gives you that peace then that verse kept coming up and i said okay lord i hear you so i've given my testimony and i thank god for that peace and i pray that all of you have that as well amen amen our mind i stayed on him amen that's where i will believe amen at this time we're going to invite uh brother david um we'll have brother matthew come sing that song i know but randy is not here so we're going to have brother matthew come and sing that song we sing this morning peace on earth amen and we'll fight for the david just so we could close them um bless you well i'm a poor replacement for brother randy no one can replace him but amen we all have a testimony and i'm glad god's not interested in talent per se so we just want to sing this to the lord and everybody knows your part so let's just sing this i heard the bails on christmas day their old familiar carols played mild and sweet their songs repeat of peace on earth good will to make and the bells are ringing [Music] like a quieter singing [Music] he's [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is no peace on earth [Music] [Music] foreign does anybody hear this on earth [Music] [Music] is the wrong shall feel the right prevail with peace on earth [Music] the world revolved from night to day a voice a chime a chance of blind of peace on earth [Music] and with our hearts we hear them [Music] do you hear the life the angels singing open up your heart and hear them on earth [Music] peace [Music] on earth i need to be seated i might as well just give a little testimony i think uh something in every believer whenever somebody wants to give an opportunity to testify you just want to testify and sometimes as the years go by you you have to give somebody else a chance because i know everyone that's met with jesus they have something to talk about and i've said this before but i just wanted to say it again because many uh brothers and sisters mentioned 2020 and 2019 was a very difficult year for me and my family and um you know lord's always gracious to bring us through and i remember saying in my heart you know 2020 is going to be a year of victory and uh certainly 2020 has been very challenging and i was reminded though is is the greater the challenge the greater the victory so i i can say that 2020 has been a great year of victory you know he works everything out for our good and there's so much that could be said and so much that we could we could say but to to be a part of this body and every single one of us every single part it's just instrumental because it's the body of christ we love each one of you and just to hear the testimonies the songs and everything it's just wonderful to see what god is doing he's alive and well in 2020 and if he tarries he's going to take us right on through amen god bless you you know uh brother orlando is always telling me he says how are you going to follow that you know and just the singing tonight and you know i think i'm the luckiest pastor in the whole world i mean i'm just so thrilled with the people the lord has put together you talk about from every tongue in every kindred and every nation the people assembling together to worship the lord and and i don't know how many places that you could hear praise the lord in 20 different languages you know what i mean and yet we all serve the same god and we've all been purchased by the same blood and we've all been filled with the same spirit i mean it is just so wonderful you know i didn't know brother darien had so much soul you know i mean i was starting to get with it back there i said where's that at i thought praise the lord we're finally loosening up you know what i mean and i think we we should all maybe if excuse the words i don't got a great vocabulary but i like to see us be free in the lord free and worship become more free in the spirit to let that unction of the spirit move us like he never you know just like he moves us you know and you know and you know me i could go all night like this i mean i probably you know sister laura got off without singing and i'm just debating whether i should let that happen or not i mean that's hardly right you know what i mean so i'm going to make her sing because that's just the kind of guy i am and i'm going to start calling on people and everything because i want the love of the lord to be shed abroad in our heart by the holy ghost and i i implore you this year to get to know one another more invite one and know another over if you see someone you never talk to they're they're a part of your body they're here because they love the lord and and and let's keep drawing the bigger circle and and grow in the lord grow in the freedom of the lord and let's press to where god really wants us to be and and i i really believe he wants a body of believers that has an open heart for those that are in need and and i pray that our congregation becomes a refuge and just to give you my testimony when i first came to fort worth well many years ago the lord told me i was in montana laying on my bed in missoula montana and the lord spoke to my heart and he said you will preach the gospel in texas and i thought you know well maybe i mean he just just as plain as could be and if you doubt whether he said it or not well i don't much hope for you but because i've been here for 40 years but i remember that i remember then i moved from montana to flagstaff and i got invited to come preach in texas and i thought that would be the fulfillment of that but as it came to pass the people asked me if i would stay and i remember i sat out in front of this little building over on john t white road and i said lord if i ever have a church in texas and it's your will i want it to be one of those cities of refuge that's always been the desire of my heart for this assembly and people that somebody with a checkered past someone that maybe a reputation was ruined or maybe their life had fallen apart that this would be a place they'd come and they could have a fresh start they could have their blackboard wiped clean that we wouldn't be a people that gossiped we wouldn't be a people that probed into anybody's past and i think i can stand here and testify of anybody of you that have ever come i've never came to you about your past i don't care where you've been i'm interested in where you're going and if we can help straighten the road and make it easy that's all that our hearts desire has been we we just want to have an open door and we want to make the presence of the lord available so he can minister and create the atmosphere and i hope that's what we go forward creating that atmosphere coming to the house of the lord creating the atmosphere that will provide a place that those that are sick and be healed those that are in bondage can be set free and people can gain overcoming strength and they'll be loved there to help them overcome and when one of us gets in trouble and suffers we all get in trouble and we all suffer and we help one another through and for those that have been visiting online i sure want to see your face again so i hope you can muster up the strength and and the lord to provide and if you if you're afraid to come well we'll get some hazmat suits and you can deck up in full uh alien gear because we'd love to see you and we love to hug you and we love to shake your hand and we'd love to hear that you're doing well and let you know that the lord jesus is still the same yesterday today and forever this has been a wonderful day for me i've just felt the presence of the lord around me and comforting me and giving me hope i've felt so inadequate and uh you know like it just you know that i don't have the ability to do this job with such a great people but then i realized that i don't have to do this job because i've got a people that can do this job and like i said we're not a religion we're a people we're a family and we just pray that we can go forward no matter how bad it gets in the future that we'll stick together we'll love one another and that they'll know that we are his disciples by that love that we have one for another so sister laura come finish my day often sing a song amen and i'll close in prayer god bless you um i guess since i'm up here i'll tell a testimony too um so my mom is not like a believer and uh years ago my family home was broken and um my mom got down a very dark path and left me and my dad and went over this man that she's been on and off with for years and um a couple months ago he started drinking a lot and pulled the gun on her and said he'd take her life and so she fled and came to live with us for about three weeks um in that she had no job no car no home and uh i just really felt sorry for her and a friend of hers from florida was on her way to come and get her and um she had been with us for about three weeks and the night before she left she was in zoe's bed her and zoe always share a room when she has to come stay and she said i have this big lump on my face it just like popped out of nowhere so i was like let me fill it so i felt it and it was big and hard and you know immediately i just get scared for it cause i think lord she has nothing and she's kind of got a very rough upc pentecostal past and her father was very abusive and so she gets real funny if i get in her eyes too religious and i thought i don't want to just say hey let's pray make her feel awkward because she can kind of get like that so i thought lord i'm your daughter and i know whatever i ask for you're going to do it and i know you can speak through me and honor my words and she's my mother and i know you love her too so i just said mom let me feel that again so i laid my hands on it and i just said you know in just a couple days this is going to be completely gone and you won't even think about it anymore she's like all right so tell her good night and uh the next morning i send her out with her friend sue and so two days later they arrive in florida and she calls me that evening and all is well and she said you know that lump on my face it's gone i said well praise the lord you know and so i'm just so thankful that he's so mindful of our loved ones even when they're going down a dark path he cares and uh it's all for a purpose you just have to trust in them so all right hope i can sing now you remember
