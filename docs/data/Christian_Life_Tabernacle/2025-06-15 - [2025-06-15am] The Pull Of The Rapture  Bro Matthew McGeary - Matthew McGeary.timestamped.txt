[5:18] But my heavenly father,

[6:13] sky.
[6:15] Among the peaks my soul can be found
[6:23] by an unexpected
[6:25] stor

[10:54] Amen. Brother David Junior, if you could

[10:58] this morning. Amen.
[11:12] So thankful to be back and be gathered
[11:14] in his presence. Let's go before him.
[11:16] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just
[11:19] come before you. Thankful to be gathered
[11:21] with the saints again this morning,
[11:22] Lord. And Lord, as we looked into your
[11:25] word and contemplated this day, Lord,
[11:27] it's a a day of we recognize fathers,
[11:30] Lord. And we started to think of those
[11:33] who maybe don't have their father here
[11:35] and looked at your promises of where you
[11:37] said you'd be a father to the
[11:38] fatherless. and Lord, how you look out
[11:41] and you defend them. And Lord, you are
[11:43] an advocate. And Lord, we want to invite
[11:46] you to be our father this morning, Lord.
[11:48] And open our hearts up completely. And
[11:51] Lord, there's nothing greater to have
[11:53] known you as our father, to know you as
[11:55] one that looks out for our interest, to
[11:57] know that you love us, Father. him. Lord
[12:01] used to sing a song many times until you
[12:05] know the loving hand that reaches down
[12:07] the fallen man picks him up from out of
[12:10] sin where he is gone. Until you know
[12:12] just how it feels to know that God is
[12:14] really real. You know nothing until you
[12:17] know the love of God.
[12:19] Lord, we want to know your love greater.
[12:21] And where's one thing, Father, in a day
[12:25] that things seem to be so wrestled with
[12:27] intellectually. And Lord, doubt and fear
[12:30] would try to enter in through
[12:32] circumstance and politics. And Lord,
[12:35] we're certain of your love for us, Lord.
[12:38] This morning, we're looking to the price
[12:40] paid and assure entrance. Father, we
[12:43] cast down any doubt, any hindrance.
[12:45] Lord, as anyone's here is battling,
[12:47] Father, with the doubt or unworthiness,
[12:51] Lord, it's your worthiness, oh God. And
[12:54] Lord, we ask for forgiveness, Lord, that
[12:56] you could have your will and way in this
[12:57] service, Lord. And Lord, take complete
[13:00] control, Father. Be use the minister, oh
[13:02] God. And Lord, just open our hearts to
[13:05] receive from you. And we're committing
[13:07] it all to you. Each song from the back
[13:10] to the front, Father, have complete
[13:11] preeminence. And Lord, my desire, my
[13:14] burning desire, Lord, may I truly allow
[13:16] you in my heart to be my father. In the
[13:19] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[13:20] I pray. Amen.

[28:22] [Music]
[28:36] My story inside hell was out on life
[28:42] seeing
[28:45] with sin and distress
[28:49] till I heard a sweet voice saying make

[29:18] storming wind. And in Jesus I'm save
[29:23] ever more.

[38:54] them a wonderful time. Brother Tommy and
[38:57] brother Andrews are out. I want to just
[38:59] pray that the Lord will be with them and
[39:01] bring them back safe home. And all of
[39:03] those that are traveling, we just want
[39:05] to commit them into the hands of the

[39:22] Amen. Brother Tim Sal, if we could just

[39:26] church.
[39:30] [Music]
[39:37] Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[39:42] There's a glow about his presence
[39:47] and I'm thankful for it.
[39:51] I echo what Brother Davey said. It's
[39:52] it's good to be back in the house of the
[39:54] Lord. And I think every time whether it
[39:57] was Wednesday night,
[40:00] Sunday on Wednesday,
[40:03] the days get longer in between.
[40:11] Happy birthday, Lori.
[40:14] It's Lor's birthday today.
[40:24] Uh you may be aware that's my
[40:26] sister-in-law and I've been blessed by
[40:29] being around around her for a long time.
[40:32] Amen. So, I want to remind you
[40:37] [Music]
[40:41] Pardon my emotion.
[40:44] [Music]
[40:52] We're blessed to have a heavenly father.
[40:55] There are those without their father in
[40:56] this life.
[40:59] [Music]
[41:01] But he told his disciples after praying
[41:04] for him and encouraging him, preparing
[41:07] them for his eventual departure,
[41:11] he said, "In this world, you'll have
[41:13] tribulation,
[41:15] but be of good cheer, for I have
[41:17] overcome the worst."
[41:19] [Music]
[41:21] That was prior to him going through the
[41:24] torture and eventual death of the cross.
[41:27] He said, "I have overcome the world.
[41:33] He's a God of I am, he is.
[41:38] And as I started to quote the scripture
[41:40] that Brother Brandham used so so many
[41:42] times
[41:44] [Music]
[41:46] and you know we refer to him as
[41:49] a country boy or
[41:53] people derogatory said he's a hillbilly
[41:55] from Kentucky the backwoods.
[41:57] He was a gentleman,
[42:02] but in his Kentucky vernacular, he said,
[42:05] "A handful and two dozen eggs."
[42:09] I don't know if that's the way he
[42:10] remembered the scripture, but it's St.
[42:12] John 5:24.
[42:16] He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[42:18] you, he that heareth my words and
[42:20] believeth on him that sent me
[42:27] hath everlasting life, and shall not
[42:29] come into judgment,
[42:33] but is passed from death unto life. Is
[42:36] passed. We're already passed from death
[42:38] unto life. That's an encouragement this
[42:41] morning.
[42:42] Whatever we have need of,
[42:45] just breathe a prayer to him. Let's just
[42:47] bow our heads.
[42:48] [Music]
[42:51] Lord, what a blessing it is to be able
[42:54] to call you father.
[42:56] Lord, we we know you've reserved a
[42:58] special place for each one of us. We're
[43:00] not servants,
[43:02] but we're children. We're offspring of a
[43:05] heavenly father. And Lord, as we come
[43:07] together today, the the presence that's
[43:10] among us, Lord, it's because so many of
[43:14] us has brought our lick of fire. You
[43:17] said that you would be with us even in
[43:20] us until the last days. Lord, we thank
[43:24] you, Lord, that you can dwell in these
[43:27] mortal bodies of flesh and clay. Lord,
[43:30] that nothing that we've done to earn it,
[43:32] but Lord, you've sanctified us, set us
[43:34] aside for your service. You've come and
[43:36] inhabited these beings. Lord,
[43:39] that's why there's a glow amongst us
[43:41] today, Lord. We just want to yield
[43:43] ourselves to your presence, Lord, and
[43:46] use us for your honor and glory. And
[43:49] Lord, if we can combine our faith today
[43:52] in your word and in your promise, Lord,
[43:55] these needs that are read, these needs
[43:57] that are upon our hearts,
[43:59] Lord, they cry out. You said when we
[44:02] don't even know how to pray, Lord, just
[44:04] the murmurings, the groanings,
[44:07] Lord, they speak to you, Lord. You've
[44:09] been in this position.
[44:11] You've been abandoned.
[44:15] You said that you'll go your own way and
[44:18] I'll be left alone,
[44:20] but I won't be alone for the Father will
[44:22] be with me.
[44:24] We thank you, Lord, that we have a
[44:25] heavenly father that's with us through
[44:27] these times of trial, heartache,
[44:29] suffering, but Lord, they're joyous
[44:31] times as we know they're on the cusp of
[44:35] your soon appearing. Lord,
[44:37] grant to our hearts today, Lord, that we
[44:39] can be lifted up, that we can hear
[44:41] something today from your word, Lord,
[44:44] resonate within and we can claim the
[44:46] promise, apply it to our lives, Lord,
[44:48] and see the manifestation
[44:53] being brought to pass or what we have
[44:54] need of, Lord, for you hear our prayer.
[44:57] We're assured of that, Lord. And you
[44:59] love us. We lift you up. We honor you
[45:02] today. Ask Lord that you just take
[45:05] control of every heart, every life,
[45:07] every spirit Lord. Anything unclean,
[45:09] just cast it out. Lord, may be in one
[45:12] mind and one accord. When the word comes
[45:14] forth, it can return a hundfold. Grant
[45:18] it to us now we pray. Bless these tithes
[45:20] and offerings that are collected. Lord,
[45:22] use them for your honor and your glory.
[45:24] We thank you, Lord.
[45:26] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[45:28] pray. Amen.

[50:16] tonight? Why don't you just open your
[50:18] mouth and thank him this morning and
[50:20] say, "Lord, we thank you for life and we
[50:23] thank you for all that you do for us.
[50:25] Lord, we thank you for providing to our
[50:27] needs. And Father, we thank you for
[50:29] gathering us here this morning. We thank
[50:32] you for all that you do. Lord, we ask
[50:34] that you just come and visit with us
[50:36] this morning. Hallelujah.
[50:39] Hallelujah.
[50:41] [Music]
[50:48] Lord, my heart
[50:51] can grow
[50:55] so far away. And
[51:00] hallelujah.
[51:01] Oh, and and yet for me
[51:05] your love
[51:07] is still the
[51:11] His love hasn't changed this morning.
[51:16] Oh, and Lord I

[52:32] him.
[52:37] Oh
[52:39] Lord my heart is
[52:43] [Music]
[52:46] your spirit.
[52:52] I work
[52:55] to worship you my Lord.
[53:05] Open
[53:08] my soul
[53:12] to worship
[53:18] to be a praise
[53:22] of
[53:24] yours.
[53:25] [Music]
[53:31] I live
[53:34] your

[53:36] [Music]
[53:48] God.

[53:57] All the great
[54:00] I
[54:02] am
[54:05] the
[54:08] lamb,
[54:11] my comfort
[54:17] and
[54:18] king. Oh, just keep worshiping him now.
[54:23] and I live

[54:31] Why don't you lift them up right now?
[54:34] Lord, we lift you up. We worship you,
[54:36] Lord.
[54:38] Oh,
[54:40] [Music]
[54:50] the great
[54:52] [Music]
[55:01] [Applause]
[55:03] I come
[55:06] [Music]
[55:12] Let's just approach him. Lord Jesus, we
[55:15] are so thankful that we could come
[55:16] together and lift your holy name. Lord,
[55:20] it just comes to me as I think about
[55:24] Solomon's temple when all of those came
[55:27] and everything was set in order. And
[55:30] when it all started to go forth, the
[55:32] worship, your presence filled the place.
[55:35] And what an awe and what a wonder it
[55:38] must have been. And
[55:40] Lord, to think we're living in an hour
[55:42] where
[55:44] we don't use our five senses of the
[55:46] flesh to perceive your presence.
[55:50] Lord, you've given us a six sense of
[55:52] faith that knows that you're here in the
[55:54] fullness of your power as you ever were.
[55:57] We want to move away from the senses
[55:58] that might jurisdict how we feel and the
[56:01] things that we think, Lord. And we want
[56:03] faith to anchor it in the revealed word
[56:04] of the hour. You would just come, Lord,
[56:07] and break the bread of life that we
[56:08] might feed on the secret things of God
[56:11] this morning. We love you, Lord.
[56:15] Lord, thank you for Calvary.
[56:19] [Music]
[56:22] When we were unlovable, Lord, you loved
[56:23] us.
[56:26] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, we've done
[56:29] things that we'd be embarrassed if any
[56:31] man would ever know.
[56:35] And yet you knew, Lord, and you said,
[56:37] "I'll I'll take that from you, and I'll
[56:39] bear that shame and reproach."
[56:41] Well, thank you, Lord. You're such a
[56:44] wonderful savior,
[56:46] Lord. We want to love you better.
[56:49] Help us to love you better. You're a
[56:51] you're a wonderful father. Yes, Lord. as
[56:55] the world would celebrate maybe a
[56:56] hallmark holiday.
[56:59] We have a heavenly father
[57:02] and you've provided everything that
[57:05] we've ever had it needed, Lord. And you
[57:08] said, "Ask abundantly that your joy
[57:10] might be full and you do exceedingly and
[57:12] abundantly more than we could even ask."
[57:13] What a privileged people we are. So we
[57:16] ask that you'd come, Lord, and minister
[57:18] to our hearts, Lord. We pray in Jesus
[57:22] Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise
[57:25] the Lord. It's good to be in his
[57:26] presence. Just a wonderful atmosphere.
[57:29] We're so thankful for the opportunity.
[57:31] Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles to
[57:33] Hebrews chapter 5.
[57:35] Uh Hebrews chapter 11. And um I thank
[57:39] you for the the monitors. You can turn
[57:41] them down just a little bit. Um Hebrews
[57:45] chapter 11. We we uh we want to while
[57:49] you're turning there um remember um
[57:53] brother brother Jose and Sister Raquel
[57:54] is they'll be traveling back from Mexico
[57:56] but while they were there sister Raquel
[58:00] needed a a pretty major surgery and she
[58:03] had a a large tumor that was growing and
[58:07] um they have gotten the results back and
[58:11] she is healed and progressed very well
[58:14] and she is cancer
[58:17] Hallelujah.
[58:19] Praise God. So, just remember them as
[58:22] they are on their journey back. But we
[58:24] we've been in prayer for that. And our
[58:27] God's a healer. He's a provider and he
[58:30] takes care of our needs. Amen. Amen.
[58:33] Just reading in Hebrews chapter 11 and
[58:36] verse 5.
[58:40] I've just been enjoying the word and the
[58:42] things that we've been fellowshipping on
[58:44] and uh you just you just love to
[58:47] continue uh gleaning in those fields
[58:49] that where we're at and where our
[58:51] pastor, brother Billy, the ministry, and
[58:53] how we're just moving through here. And
[58:55] and I would say my my heart's desire is
[58:57] as I was fellowshipping with brother
[58:59] Billy, you know, um we we want the
[59:03] ministering of the word to be a help to
[59:04] the individual because every one of us
[59:07] might be in different seasons, different
[59:09] challenges on the mountaintop, in the
[59:12] valley, different family situations, a
[59:14] season of singleness. Uh you might be a
[59:17] youth, a child. you you you might be I
[59:19] don't you could be five, six, seven
[59:21] years old and you're you're you're
[59:22] starting to catch a little bit of the
[59:25] word and and and things. And we we want
[59:27] to be a help to to any age, any place in
[59:30] their life. And and I I believe we serve
[59:32] a God uh that's uh um he's he's hidden
[59:36] in simplicity, you know, and and and and
[59:39] we know that uh I'm so thankful that I
[59:41] that's what I needed. I'm I'm glad you
[59:43] didn't need a a degree or because I'd
[59:45] have been out. I I I'm glad you don't
[59:47] need a a a
[59:49] super mind to be able to remember
[59:51] everything and recall and plug
[59:52] everything together. You just you need
[59:54] faith and and faith is a gift. Isn't
[59:57] that wonderful? I mean, that just always
[59:58] makes me happy. I like getting gifts. I
[1:00:02] don't know about you, but I like gifts.
[1:00:04] You know, I I really like it when
[1:00:06] somebody does something for me. And and
[1:00:07] to think that our heavenly father gave
[1:00:09] us the greatest gift. He gave you faith.
[1:00:12] He gave you eternal life. He wrote your
[1:00:13] name on the lamb's book of life. Well,
[1:00:15] hallelujah. Glory. Hebrews 11 and5.
[1:00:20] By faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:00:23] should not see death and was not found
[1:00:25] because God translated him. For before
[1:00:28] his translation he had this testimony
[1:00:31] that he pleased God. But without faith
[1:00:34] it is impossible to please him. For he
[1:00:36] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:00:38] is. And he is a rewarder of them that
[1:00:42] diligently seek him. You may have your
[1:00:44] seats if you'll also turn in your Bibles
[1:00:46] to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:00:50] Amen. By the help of God, I I want to
[1:00:52] preach to you this morning on the pool
[1:00:54] of the rapture. And
[1:00:59] I I've been um just in my own um
[1:01:04] studies and feeding um I I I as I say
[1:01:07] this just let me reiterate always feed
[1:01:11] in the field that your pastor is
[1:01:14] leading. And so anything else I would
[1:01:17] say any of the other ministers what we
[1:01:18] are bringing we want to bring that right
[1:01:20] in the same field. So if it it might
[1:01:22] feel like it's from a different angle or
[1:01:23] something like that, it it we want just
[1:01:26] to dovetail right in within the field
[1:01:27] that the the sheep are gleaning in that
[1:01:29] it might be a help to you. And so one of
[1:01:31] in my own personal studies and
[1:01:33] ministering and things I I've been in uh
[1:01:35] the message why Christ speak and and I I
[1:01:38] could tell you you could, you know, as
[1:01:40] the prophet said, if you don't see Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ in every line, go back and read
[1:01:44] it again. I I don't care uh what tape
[1:01:46] you're listening to or what verse in the
[1:01:48] Bible you're reading. It's the eternal
[1:01:50] word of God. And if you're reading it
[1:01:52] with a faith, God will feed your soul.
[1:01:54] You know, I I uh well, we'll just not be
[1:01:56] labor. Uh let's get into the 1
[1:01:58] Thessalonians 4:16.
[1:02:01] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:02:03] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[1:02:06] the archangel, and with the trump of
[1:02:08] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:02:09] first. Then we which are alive and
[1:02:12] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:02:14] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:02:16] the air. And so shall we ever be with
[1:02:18] the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another
[1:02:21] with these words. And as I've been just
[1:02:22] feeding in that uh message why Christ
[1:02:25] speak, brother Brandon would be speaking
[1:02:26] of the rapture. And and so I've also
[1:02:29] been just, you know, you you you jump
[1:02:30] into other sermons and you listen and
[1:02:32] and I don't know about you, but I I try
[1:02:34] to feed on the message every day because
[1:02:37] it's Christ the one that you're feeding
[1:02:39] on. And if if we're going to go in a
[1:02:40] rapture and we're going to go in a body
[1:02:42] change and and and and and we're going
[1:02:44] to receive that supernatural strength to
[1:02:46] be caught away, it's going to come by
[1:02:48] the revealed word of the hour. You you
[1:02:50] must be listening to the message. I was
[1:02:52] just fellowshipping with one of my kids
[1:02:54] and and I was just talking to them and I
[1:02:55] said, "Well, you know, I said, "Are you
[1:02:57] listening to the message?" I said, "It's
[1:02:59] one thing to read and pray and
[1:03:00] understand and and read your Bible, but
[1:03:02] but God has given us a message to help
[1:03:04] us understand the Bible. Without the
[1:03:06] message, it's a closed book. You can't
[1:03:08] understand those things." So, so God,
[1:03:10] his word comes to his prophet. He's a
[1:03:12] revealer of the word, an interpreter of
[1:03:14] the word. So, there's there's things
[1:03:15] laying in the message that that you you
[1:03:17] can believe and you you can you can have
[1:03:19] faith, but then then the message will
[1:03:21] come and bring a revelation and an
[1:03:22] understanding to the things that you're
[1:03:24] reading. And so, uh out of this uh
[1:03:27] rapture message as 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:03:30] would be his text uh one of the text in
[1:03:32] Psalms 27. But he says, "But to the
[1:03:34] church, the bride, the rapture is a
[1:03:36] revelation to her. It's revealed to her
[1:03:39] that that the revelation the true bride
[1:03:42] of Christ will be waiting for the
[1:03:43] revelation of the rapture. Now it is a
[1:03:45] revelation for the revelation is faith.
[1:03:49] You cannot have a revelation without it
[1:03:51] being faith. Faith is a revelation
[1:03:54] because it's something that's revealed
[1:03:56] to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is
[1:03:59] something that's been revealed to you
[1:04:00] like it was to Abraham that could call
[1:04:03] anything contrary to what had been
[1:04:06] revealed to him as though it wasn't so.
[1:04:08] There was a lot of things that were
[1:04:09] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:04:12] Abraham. Everything else would have
[1:04:14] declared Abraham, what God has told you
[1:04:16] is not possible. It cannot happen. But
[1:04:20] yet, despite all of the challenges and
[1:04:22] all the struggles and all the science
[1:04:24] and everything that would have testified
[1:04:26] and said, Abraham, you've lost your
[1:04:28] mind. It is impossible. It's been one
[1:04:30] year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. The
[1:04:33] things haven't come to pass. But yet,
[1:04:35] because it was revealed to him in the
[1:04:37] face of his critics, in the face of his
[1:04:40] adversaries, he was able to call those
[1:04:42] things that were not as though they were
[1:04:45] and declare, "I'm going to have a baby."
[1:04:48] Now, faith, that's what faith is, is the
[1:04:51] revelation of God. And and I just want
[1:04:53] to say we're living in an exciting time
[1:04:56] uh for the believer. You know, wi w with
[1:04:58] chaos and destruction and and everything
[1:05:01] going on in the land around us. You
[1:05:03] know, I I think it should be a very
[1:05:05] exciting time for the believer where you
[1:05:07] should start being a little bit happy
[1:05:08] and and and by no means would we want to
[1:05:10] belittle the struggles and the heartache
[1:05:12] and the lost lives and and the wars and
[1:05:14] the things that are going on, but but
[1:05:16] you know, I it's it's the sign of the
[1:05:19] times. We know we're we're living right
[1:05:21] in the very end time, the very climax
[1:05:24] where where we as believers, you know, I
[1:05:27] I I would I would say that, you know,
[1:05:28] when my mom and dad heard the message,
[1:05:30] they were so moved as as they were
[1:05:32] listening uh I believed uh uh uh uh m I
[1:05:36] can't I'm failing to remember the sermon
[1:05:37] they were listening to, but my they
[1:05:38] heard that word and they just bailed out
[1:05:40] of California because they knew the
[1:05:42] urgency and the hour that we are now
[1:05:44] living in. And I say uh we should have
[1:05:46] that same urgency. We should have that.
[1:05:48] I mean, if if they had it then, my if
[1:05:50] the and if and Jesus said, you know,
[1:05:53] said, "Behold, I come quickly." There's
[1:05:54] always an urgency amongst the believers.
[1:05:57] But yet, when you live in a day and age
[1:05:59] where we're seeing prophecy being
[1:06:00] fulfilled, and if we've received the the
[1:06:04] message of the hour, we know that we're
[1:06:06] just waiting for the culmination of the
[1:06:07] change of our bodies. There ought to be
[1:06:09] an expectation there. There ought to be
[1:06:11] a something moving within you. And I I I
[1:06:14] say you ought to get excited about it. I
[1:06:16] I say I say we we should be happy
[1:06:19] now. Now now I know that uh sometimes
[1:06:22] people get a little bit worried and they
[1:06:23] start to wonder and and like I said
[1:06:25] there there there's there there's but
[1:06:27] there's wars going on in the lands but I
[1:06:29] I like in this message in Psalms 27:5
[1:06:32] David says for in the time of trouble he
[1:06:34] shall hide me in his pavilion in the
[1:06:37] secret of his tabernacle. Now that
[1:06:39] tabernacle means tent. If you look up
[1:06:42] the definition, he shall hide me. In the
[1:06:43] secret of his tent shall he hide me. He
[1:06:46] shall set me up upon a rock. I say you
[1:06:49] can be going through a valley. You can
[1:06:51] be in a really hard time, in a really
[1:06:54] hard situation. Oh uh uh but in that
[1:06:57] valley you can still be set up upon a
[1:07:00] rock because that rock is revelation.
[1:07:03] Faith is a revelation. The rapture is a
[1:07:05] revelation. And if you have the
[1:07:07] revelation of the rapture and it's
[1:07:09] moving with inside of you, you can see
[1:07:11] all the things that are going on. You
[1:07:13] can be going through hardships and you
[1:07:15] can be going through trials, but
[1:07:16] something in your soul knows that you
[1:07:18] got an anchor. You can be like Abraham.
[1:07:20] You can call those things that are not
[1:07:22] as though they are because you have a
[1:07:23] divine promise and a revelation of the
[1:07:25] hour that you're now living in and
[1:07:27] you've come into contact with it and
[1:07:29] you've been united with it. It's not
[1:07:30] something that you're guessing and
[1:07:32] wondering and could it be and and trying
[1:07:34] to put this together with that and and
[1:07:36] then and then your ideas fall apart and
[1:07:37] all. It's something that's revealed.
[1:07:41] That's right. An exciting time. And I
[1:07:44] just ask, you know, what does the
[1:07:45] rapture mean to you?
[1:07:48] What's your understanding of it? Where
[1:07:50] is it on your, you know, priority list?
[1:07:52] And when is it? How's it going to
[1:07:54] happen?
[1:07:56] you know, are are you excited
[1:07:59] or are you worried?
[1:08:02] You know, are you getting a little my
[1:08:05] what happens? You know, I don't know
[1:08:08] what happens if things get really bad.
[1:08:09] What happens if the economy fails again?
[1:08:13] What happens if Trump presses that
[1:08:14] button?
[1:08:16] You know, a lot of times we can start
[1:08:18] getting getting feared and getting and
[1:08:20] worried because of hardships and and and
[1:08:22] struggles, you know. But I was reminded
[1:08:24] how brother Brandham said that if if you
[1:08:26] were starving, you know, if you were
[1:08:28] starving, maybe you'd be worried, maybe
[1:08:29] a little be a little concerned. But he
[1:08:31] said if you were starving and you had a
[1:08:32] quarter that could purchase a loaf of
[1:08:35] bread, you could be just as happy
[1:08:39] with the quarter, right? Because you had
[1:08:42] what? The purchasing power.
[1:08:45] So, so now that something had been given
[1:08:48] to you that because of the condition
[1:08:50] that you were in, now you had something
[1:08:52] that could purchase uh h the the
[1:08:54] solution for the problem that you were
[1:08:56] living in. And what is that? Oh, that
[1:08:58] that represents faith. God has given you
[1:09:00] a faith for the hour in the situ. Maybe
[1:09:03] you got a a sickness in your body, but
[1:09:06] when it's a revelation to you or or God
[1:09:08] has given you a promise that you're
[1:09:09] believing for, look, uh don't don't
[1:09:11] don't allow the trial to beat you down.
[1:09:14] You got to realize, hey, I got a
[1:09:16] quarter. Now, what the devil wants you
[1:09:18] to do is try to eat the quarter. You
[1:09:19] can't eat the quarter.
[1:09:22] Don't settle.
[1:09:23] Well, maybe he didn't really mean this,
[1:09:25] and maybe maybe he didn't really mean it
[1:09:27] that way. And well, maybe maybe it'll
[1:09:29] just be manifested on the other side.
[1:09:31] And and no, you got your corner.
[1:09:34] There's bread.
[1:09:37] All right. There's bread for you. Yes. I
[1:09:40] I I I I one of the things that stuck out
[1:09:42] on the tape that we listened to on
[1:09:43] Wednesday was that brother Brandham said
[1:09:45] that that woman that had the blood issue
[1:09:48] faith dropped into her heart.
[1:09:51] If I can just touch the hymn of his
[1:09:53] garment, then I will be healed. Oh, I
[1:09:56] love this. He said, "If that faith had
[1:10:00] had dropped down in her heart, then God
[1:10:02] was obligated to present the opportunity
[1:10:06] or the ability for her to touch the hymn
[1:10:09] of his garment." Oh, hallelujah. If the
[1:10:12] faith is in your heart, then God is
[1:10:15] obligated. Hallelujah. And I thought,
[1:10:17] "Oh, praise the Lord." Here, the faith
[1:10:19] had dropped in her heart. Faith like a
[1:10:21] quarter. And all of a sudden, here come
[1:10:23] the bread of life walking down the road.
[1:10:25] I said, 'Oh, praise God. What an
[1:10:27] expectation we should have if we could
[1:10:30] take our quarter of faith or take the
[1:10:32] faith that God has given us. What kind
[1:10:34] of service could we have this morning if
[1:10:36] all of a sudden we realize God has given
[1:10:38] me the gift of faith and the bread of
[1:10:40] life? Jesus Christ is walking up and
[1:10:42] down the aisles right now. If I could
[1:10:44] just touch the hymn of his garden, what
[1:10:46] what kind of atmosphere would be
[1:10:48] created? What kind of expectation? What
[1:10:50] kind of results could we get in the body
[1:10:52] of Christ in this hour? Amen. Come on.
[1:10:57] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:59] Faith is a revelation.
[1:11:02] Are you excited about the rapture? Is it
[1:11:04] your, you know, I don't know where the
[1:11:06] rapture ranks on your priority list?
[1:11:09] Does it just kind of is it just a
[1:11:12] thought that kind of floats through your
[1:11:13] mind every once in a while?
[1:11:16] or is it something that is on the
[1:11:18] foremost of your your mind and something
[1:11:21] that you're in expectation of and
[1:11:24] something that you're praying about? And
[1:11:27] I I I just as we read that scripture
[1:11:30] with all of this going on in the time of
[1:11:33] trouble, there is a secret place for the
[1:11:36] believer. We we we got a bomb shelter
[1:11:38] under under the wings of Almighty
[1:11:40] Jehovah. There there is a place of
[1:11:42] refuge. There's a a secret place. And I
[1:11:44] I say if you haven't found it, I say God
[1:11:47] is pulling. He's drawing. He's beckoning
[1:11:49] unto you. There's a there's a place of
[1:11:51] refuge where the the blood has been
[1:11:53] applied that that where the death angel
[1:11:55] can pass out. We we got a token. We have
[1:11:57] a real Holy Ghost.
[1:12:02] If the same spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:12:04] Christ from the dead dwell in you, it
[1:12:06] will also quicken your mortal body. It
[1:12:09] will quicken your thoughts. It'll it'll
[1:12:11] quicken your understanding. Oh, it's
[1:12:13] quickening power. That's what the
[1:12:15] prophet of God said. He said, "The
[1:12:16] quickening power lets us see us coming."
[1:12:19] The quickening power lets us see these
[1:12:21] things. It was the quickening power that
[1:12:23] opened the seals. The quickening power,
[1:12:25] what is it? It's Jesus Christ. It's a
[1:12:27] revelation.
[1:12:30] Oh, glory to God.
[1:12:32] Prophet of God said, "Quickening power
[1:12:34] brings you into rapturing condition
[1:12:41] before one bomb drops."
[1:12:47] Before one bomb drops, you know, uh,
[1:12:52] this might sound kind of odd.
[1:12:55] I was just thinking about that before
[1:12:57] one bomb drops, a little voice came up
[1:12:59] next to me and said, "What happens if
[1:13:00] you're still here?
[1:13:03] And I just got to, you know, I thought,
[1:13:06] huh, probably a conversation I shouldn't
[1:13:09] entertain,
[1:13:11] but you know, you got to know how to do
[1:13:12] battle. And I thought, what happens if
[1:13:14] I'm still here? And and another thought
[1:13:17] tried to come, that means Brother
[1:13:19] Brandham's a false prophet. And
[1:13:20] something inside of him, he said, no,
[1:13:23] that means I wasn't ready.
[1:13:25] Now, I'm sorry
[1:13:27] if a bomb drops and I'm still here.
[1:13:30] Brother Brandham wasn't wrong. I was
[1:13:33] wrong.
[1:13:36] And God forbid I have to seal my
[1:13:38] testimony with my own blood
[1:13:42] because I didn't get desperate enough
[1:13:45] and I didn't get the Holy Ghost. But I
[1:13:47] know this message is right.
[1:13:50] I know it's the truth.
[1:13:53] And if I had to go through tribulation,
[1:13:55] if that would please my Lord, then I'd
[1:13:57] be brokenhearted. But I'd realize I just
[1:14:00] didn't have what I thought I had.
[1:14:04] But I know one thing, this word is
[1:14:06] right.
[1:14:07] So if a bomb did drop and I was still
[1:14:09] here, then I I would know the raptures
[1:14:11] on. And I'd say, "Lord, help me. I need
[1:14:13] more grace."
[1:14:17] But I got a greater revelation.
[1:14:20] You old devil. I ain't going to be here.
[1:14:24] I got my quarter. I got my Holy Ghost.
[1:14:27] Send the bombs. It's my ticket out of
[1:14:31] here. I had a friend call me. I've
[1:14:33] witnessed to him for years and and done
[1:14:34] my best to to to sew a word in there and
[1:14:37] he called me and he was all up, you
[1:14:38] know, my this is going on and that's
[1:14:40] going on and, you know, he he kind of he
[1:14:43] never really been that much into things
[1:14:44] and now he's kind of getting into things
[1:14:46] a little bit. He's like, man, this could
[1:14:47] be the end time. I said, yeah, isn't
[1:14:49] that exciting? And he's like, "Man,
[1:14:50] you've always been like that." Like,
[1:14:52] "Yeah, man. It's the end time. It's
[1:14:54] we're at the very end. This is the end
[1:14:56] of the world. Isn't that amazing?" He's
[1:14:58] like, "Yeah, you've always been
[1:15:00] different." I
[1:15:03] cuz I don't got nothing to fear.
[1:15:06] I was born for this.
[1:15:09] I was placed here for this. It's my
[1:15:12] purpose. It's my calling. It's why I'm
[1:15:14] here. God saw before the foundation of
[1:15:16] the world. Hey, I want Ben Wall. I want
[1:15:18] Brother Billy. I want these ones there.
[1:15:21] Hey, there there's going to be a pool of
[1:15:23] the rapture and this is the seed a
[1:15:25] predestinated seed that I want to be
[1:15:27] living in that hour.
[1:15:30] Amen. Yes. So, in why Christ speak, as
[1:15:33] we just move
[1:15:35] into maybe um
[1:15:38] some of the things we've been
[1:15:39] fellowshipping on, in why Christ speak
[1:15:41] verse uh uh paragraph 49, he says, "Just
[1:15:46] as we know, as a man asked me a few
[1:15:48] moments ago about the coming and the
[1:15:50] rapture, we know we've lived the time
[1:15:52] out at the time of the rapture is at
[1:15:55] hand and we're looking for a rapturing
[1:15:57] faith that can pull the church together
[1:15:59] and give us some supernatural strength
[1:16:01] that can change these bodies that we
[1:16:03] live in. When we see a God that can
[1:16:06] raise the dead off the floor or out of
[1:16:09] the yard and bring back to life again
[1:16:11] and present him before us. When we see a
[1:16:13] God who can take a cancer that eats a
[1:16:15] man to a shadow and raise him up to a
[1:16:17] strong healthy man again. That ought to
[1:16:19] give rapturing faith to the people. Now,
[1:16:22] some sometimes um if we're not careful,
[1:16:25] you there's some quotes and things and
[1:16:26] and I've heard it presented in a way
[1:16:28] that we're waiting for a squeeze and we
[1:16:30] we know that uh uh uh uh you know, could
[1:16:32] it already been fulfilled? Is it going
[1:16:34] to be fulfilled? I'm not I'm not too
[1:16:36] interested in what will be. I'm
[1:16:37] interested in what is right now and and
[1:16:39] what God has revealed to us and where
[1:16:41] where we're at. But but I see one thing
[1:16:43] laying in the word. The prophet of God
[1:16:44] said said national force put Israel in
[1:16:47] its homeland and and national force will
[1:16:49] put the the denominations and the
[1:16:51] econical moves of councils. But he said
[1:16:53] it'll be the power of God that puts the
[1:16:55] people in the bride. So, don't be
[1:16:57] looking for some outward force or some
[1:16:59] calamity. Oh, oh, Iran and and this
[1:17:02] missile and that missile and and now
[1:17:04] this is going on and now there's going
[1:17:05] to come a something in the economy and
[1:17:08] I'm going to get into desperation and
[1:17:10] all of these things are going to happen
[1:17:11] and then all of a sudden all this this
[1:17:13] pressure from outside is going to is
[1:17:15] going to make me pop like popcorn.
[1:17:19] Don't be waiting for that.
[1:17:22] No. No. of the believer is we are hidden
[1:17:25] in the secret of a tabernacle. We are in
[1:17:28] a secret place feeding on the secret
[1:17:31] things of God. Oh, we we have an anchor
[1:17:33] that the world knows nothing about. We
[1:17:35] have a revelation.
[1:17:38] He says that when the light flashes from
[1:17:40] the sky and the trumpet sounds, the body
[1:17:42] of Christ will be quickly gathered
[1:17:43] together and changed in a moment in a
[1:17:46] and taken into heaven. We're looking for
[1:17:48] a rapturing faith
[1:17:52] that can pull the church together
[1:17:55] and give it some supernatural strength.
[1:17:57] And another place, Brother Brham says,
[1:17:58] it's going to take more faith than there
[1:18:00] was in any age for this has to be
[1:18:03] rapturing faith.
[1:18:06] And we're we're just wanting to speak to
[1:18:08] you for a moment on the pull of the
[1:18:10] rapture.
[1:18:12] The pull of the rapture. Jesus said in
[1:18:14] John 12:32, "And if I be lifted up from
[1:18:17] the earth, will draw all men unto me.
[1:18:21] All the Father has given me will come."
[1:18:24] I want to say, you can run. If you are
[1:18:25] predestinated seed, you can run, young
[1:18:28] people. You can run and you can fight
[1:18:30] and you can tug and you you can twist.
[1:18:32] But guess what? All the Father has given
[1:18:35] me will come. You know, we were talking
[1:18:37] about fishing and and thinking about
[1:18:39] things about fish and I believe I was
[1:18:41] talking with some of the brothers about
[1:18:43] catching a shark and and you know, you
[1:18:45] and I I well, I'll just tell the story
[1:18:47] then. One time I was out with my dad on
[1:18:49] a a deep sea fishing trip and we'd been
[1:18:51] out hadn't seen land for a couple days
[1:18:53] and and they were cutting up the fish
[1:18:55] and and they were throwing them
[1:18:56] overboard and and I I saw this, you
[1:18:58] know, it was like a six, seven foot
[1:19:00] shark, I guess, you know, I don't know.
[1:19:01] It was pretty big. I thought, well, man,
[1:19:02] I would like to hook that thing. So, I
[1:19:04] went and got a little steel line leader,
[1:19:06] you know, so his teeth wouldn't cut a
[1:19:08] regular fishing line. I I put it on
[1:19:09] there and I took the back of a big old
[1:19:11] tuna, you know, with the uh back fins on
[1:19:13] there and maybe this big bait and just
[1:19:15] hooked it in. I threw it just chunk the
[1:19:17] thing over and it splashes in the water
[1:19:19] and and you know, that little shark just
[1:19:20] kind of mosied up and went
[1:19:23] and I set the hook
[1:19:27] and it didn't even move. And then it was
[1:19:30] so close I just kind of pulled it a
[1:19:33] little more. and it kind of floated up
[1:19:35] to the boat and I felt like that thing
[1:19:37] looked at me and said, "Really?"
[1:19:40] And then just went
[1:19:44] and just took off. And and one of the
[1:19:47] deck mates came over there and he
[1:19:48] grabbed the line uh and he cut the line.
[1:19:51] He said, "Son,
[1:19:53] even if you could reel that thing in, we
[1:19:56] don't want it on the boat."
[1:20:00] You know, and it struck me one time as I
[1:20:02] was ministering. You know, each one of
[1:20:04] you have a hook of predestination in
[1:20:07] you.
[1:20:09] And you can run and you can fight and
[1:20:11] you can struggle and the Lord will just
[1:20:13] set the drag. Go ahead and fight a
[1:20:15] little bit more. And you'll get tired
[1:20:17] and you'll start coming back to the
[1:20:19] boat. Remember that deck can cut the
[1:20:21] line. But I want to tell you, no man can
[1:20:24] cut the line of predestination.
[1:20:26] There ain't no fault. There ain't no
[1:20:28] failure. There ain't no preacher. There
[1:20:30] ain't no bishop. There ain't no family
[1:20:32] situation. There's no DNA. There is
[1:20:35] nothing that you can ever go through
[1:20:37] that can ever cut the predestinated line
[1:20:39] that is hooked into your life. So go
[1:20:42] ahead and run. Go ahead and kick. Go
[1:20:44] ahead and scream and run all you want.
[1:20:46] But there is a hook in you. You can run
[1:20:49] to that church, that place, that drug,
[1:20:51] that boy, that girl. You can run out
[1:20:54] into the world. And I tell you what, you
[1:20:55] can get tangled up in a bunch of
[1:20:56] seaweed. But I say you don't want to go
[1:20:58] that way. There's a lot of scars and a
[1:21:00] lot of hurt and a lot of things that you
[1:21:02] can go from. You can save yourself a lot
[1:21:04] of trouble and just say, "Okay, I'm done
[1:21:06] running."
[1:21:07] And what does the fisherman do when you
[1:21:09] when you finally get a little bit of
[1:21:10] tire? What does he do? He says, "All
[1:21:12] right.
[1:21:14] Come on.
[1:21:16] All the father has given me will come."
[1:21:19] And then maybe all a sudden something
[1:21:20] comes by and gets your attention like,
[1:21:22] "No, I'm going to go back over here."
[1:21:24] And and
[1:21:28] This is really hard being out here.
[1:21:32] You mean God sent a prophet? You mean
[1:21:35] it's the message of the hour?
[1:21:39] Something in you won't let it go.
[1:21:43] You can kick, you can scream, you can
[1:21:45] fight, you can get in your mind where
[1:21:48] you lose your mind, but you'll never
[1:21:50] lose that predestinated seed. There is a
[1:21:53] deep calling to a deep and there ain't
[1:21:56] no drug. There ain't no religion. There
[1:21:57] ain't no works. There ain't no dancing.
[1:21:59] There ain't no shouting. There is no
[1:22:01] substitute for the revealed word of the
[1:22:04] hour. There is a deep and the only thing
[1:22:06] that predestinated seed wants is the
[1:22:08] word. Give me the word. Give me Malachi
[1:22:11] 4:5. Give me revelation, Lord. That's
[1:22:13] what I need.
[1:22:15] Come on.
[1:22:17] It's time to get on the boat. Yes,
[1:22:20] that's right.
[1:22:22] Quit running. He's going to draw you.
[1:22:26] He's going to draw you in. Do you feel
[1:22:29] the pull?
[1:22:32] Do you feel the pull?
[1:22:34] The hour that we're now living in, the
[1:22:36] time and the season, there's a pull.
[1:22:39] There's a drawing, something moving,
[1:22:42] something working within the believer. I
[1:22:44] say, do you feel the pull?
[1:22:46] Does it have an effect on your life? Is
[1:22:48] there Is there something that you know
[1:22:50] is drawing you?
[1:22:53] We've received a rapturing word. We've
[1:22:56] received a rapturing grace.
[1:23:01] We've received a message. We received a
[1:23:03] token.
[1:23:04] Do you know the value of this message?
[1:23:07] Yeah, I was thinking of that and I got
[1:23:09] to just the story of Rahab came to my my
[1:23:12] mind and I was thinking about here Rahab
[1:23:14] is on the wall of this city
[1:23:17] and you know just imagine she's up on
[1:23:19] the wall of that city and there's guys
[1:23:21] driving by in their Porsche and and
[1:23:23] they're driving by in their Lamborghinis
[1:23:25] and you know and and and they got their
[1:23:28] Instagrams and and their AI lives. You
[1:23:31] know that's what people got now is an
[1:23:32] AI. Look at me. You know it's fake. It's
[1:23:34] a false reality. You know, you know AI
[1:23:37] is in the Bible.
[1:23:40] You know that, right? What was AI? What
[1:23:41] happened in AI? AI was where Achen, I
[1:23:45] believe it's Achen, took a a a garment
[1:23:47] and a wedge of gold from B and he hid it
[1:23:49] in his tent.
[1:23:51] And the whole church suffered and wasn't
[1:23:54] out and was losing battles because some
[1:23:57] believer thought he could have a little
[1:23:59] bit of the world, right? And still be a
[1:24:03] successful believer.
[1:24:05] But it was it was it was a deception.
[1:24:07] And if AI isn't ever a deception, my I'm
[1:24:11] telling you well, you don't even know.
[1:24:12] You can't even know what you're seeing
[1:24:14] is real or not anymore. You you know who
[1:24:18] who knows? But I was thinking of Rahab.
[1:24:19] You know, here this this society going
[1:24:22] around and and you know, things going on
[1:24:25] and and maybe this person's the
[1:24:26] wealthiest and that's the richest and
[1:24:28] this guy got the best tech job and and
[1:24:29] that guy got the biggest house on the
[1:24:31] wall and all these things, but you know
[1:24:32] what? She could have been the poorest
[1:24:34] person in the city. But you know what,
[1:24:36] Ray bad? She had a token.
[1:24:40] That was worth more than everything
[1:24:42] everybody else had because everything in
[1:24:45] that city was about to crumble.
[1:24:49] I don't care how good your job is. I
[1:24:51] don't care how big your house is. I
[1:24:53] don't care how good-looking that boy is
[1:24:55] that you like. If you don't got the
[1:24:58] token,
[1:25:00] it's worthless.
[1:25:02] Are you hearing me this morning? If you
[1:25:04] don't have the token, if you don't have
[1:25:06] the Holy Ghost, if you don't have a
[1:25:08] revelation of the message, you better
[1:25:10] get into desperation and start praying
[1:25:13] for revelation of the word that has been
[1:25:16] proclaimed in the hour that we're now
[1:25:17] living because that is your safety. That
[1:25:20] is the ark. That's what you got to get
[1:25:22] on if you want to be saved. You got to
[1:25:24] come into the message. And the message
[1:25:27] is Christ.
[1:25:33] Oh, we need that token. And the token
[1:25:35] has to be applied. Brother Brandham
[1:25:36] said, "If we lift Jesus Christ up before
[1:25:39] the people, he will do the drawing."
[1:25:40] It's the greatest magnet the world has
[1:25:43] ever known.
[1:25:46] I'll just read it again and see if see
[1:25:47] if anybody believes that. If we lift up
[1:25:49] Jesus Christ up before the people, he
[1:25:51] will do the drawing. It's the greatest
[1:25:53] magnet the world has ever known.
[1:25:58] I'm gonna read it one more time. I think
[1:25:59] more people believe it. If we lift up
[1:26:01] Jesus Christ before the people, he will
[1:26:02] do the drawing. If the greatest magnet
[1:26:04] the world has ever known.
[1:26:07] Wow, that's starting to sound better. If
[1:26:09] we lift up Jesus Christ
[1:26:12] before the people, he will do the
[1:26:14] drawing.
[1:26:16] It's the greatest magnet.
[1:26:22] You can you can lift up a man.
[1:26:26] You can lift up secondhand revelation.
[1:26:30] But if you lift up this message,
[1:26:33] brother Matthew, I don't have a great
[1:26:35] understanding. Well, hold on here. My
[1:26:37] prophet told me if you just tell how
[1:26:38] your candle got lit.
[1:26:41] I know one thing. This message knows how
[1:26:44] to light a candle.
[1:26:47] This message will set you on fire. And
[1:26:49] if you have an experience and can start
[1:26:51] testifying of what God did in your life,
[1:26:56] it will draw. It will have an effect.
[1:27:01] It'll produce a change.
[1:27:06] Sometimes we might not have what we
[1:27:08] think we have, so you can't even lift it
[1:27:09] up.
[1:27:12] But if we lift up Jesus Christ, the
[1:27:14] believer is magnetized to that word.
[1:27:18] You know, brother Brandham tells the
[1:27:19] story about how he went into that
[1:27:21] factory and there was metal and
[1:27:23] everything laying everywhere and and and
[1:27:25] he was watching that and and a big
[1:27:27] magnet swept over and and all this metal
[1:27:30] and everything all these particles just
[1:27:31] started going up and clinging to the
[1:27:32] magnet. And brother Random watched that
[1:27:34] and he goes, "Huh?" He said, "Let me ask
[1:27:36] you a question." He said, "Why? Why did
[1:27:39] that metal over there? Why did that not
[1:27:42] why was that attracted and taken up to
[1:27:44] the magnet? He goes, "Oh, you see,
[1:27:45] Brother Brandham, that's aluminum." He
[1:27:47] said, "It's not magnetized." He said,
[1:27:49] "Praise the Lord." He said, "Hey, what
[1:27:52] what's what's going on?" He goes, "Oh,
[1:27:53] nothing. I just thinking. Just
[1:27:55] thinking."
[1:27:57] He said, "But what about that old car
[1:27:59] over there? Why? Why didn't that go up?"
[1:28:02] He said, he said, "Oh, you see that one,
[1:28:04] Brother Brandon? That over there? That's
[1:28:05] bolted down." He goes, "Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] What's the matter?" He goes, "Oh, I was
[1:28:10] just thinking."
[1:28:13] He said, "Oh,
[1:28:15] because I'm magnetized.
[1:28:17] that aluminum might have been magnetized
[1:28:20] and and and there's people that are
[1:28:21] bolted down by the things of the world
[1:28:24] and and and then something else is
[1:28:26] drawing them and pulling them and and
[1:28:28] they're looking at circumstances. But I
[1:28:30] say, "Oh, by the grace of God, may his
[1:28:32] power come down and break the shackles
[1:28:34] and and tear the bolts out of your life
[1:28:36] that you would be set free because
[1:28:38] there's a great magnet. The message of
[1:28:40] the hour, it's drawing. It's pulling.
[1:28:42] It's rapture time. It's bride time. Come
[1:28:45] up higher, John. come up into heavenly
[1:28:48] places. It's time to set your wings and
[1:28:50] fly.
[1:28:54] Now, I just maybe
[1:28:56] for a moment just maybe not take too
[1:28:58] much time on this because as we as we
[1:29:01] ministered uh you know, we we we you
[1:29:03] might hear us talk about the pool and
[1:29:05] the third pull or the the pool of the
[1:29:07] word and and we're speaking about the
[1:29:09] pool of the rapture. If you study the
[1:29:12] message, we understand that there were
[1:29:13] three pools in brother Bam's ministry.
[1:29:17] And and if if you wanted to study it
[1:29:19] out, you could go into what is a vision,
[1:29:21] I believe April 56. And um many places
[1:29:25] uh in the message, why are uh people
[1:29:27] tossed about? And uh you could come into
[1:29:29] sir, is this the time? And and then he
[1:29:32] he also breaks it down through the uh
[1:29:34] the dream or the vision he had in uh
[1:29:37] December 22 and the constellation of
[1:29:39] angels. And he'll talk about the the
[1:29:41] little birds coming and the the the
[1:29:43] bigger birds and then the angels coming
[1:29:44] from eternity. and he'd show how that's
[1:29:46] first, second, and third pool. But I if
[1:29:48] if just to try to simplify and maybe if
[1:29:52] I could say it like that where that even
[1:29:54] the phrase and why we even say that is
[1:29:56] is is years back, brother Brandham, he
[1:29:58] went into a vision. And now the prophet
[1:30:01] is in a vision and and he's he's trying
[1:30:04] to take a string or maybe you'd call it
[1:30:07] a shoelace or a rope and he's try he has
[1:30:09] a little uh what he would say a
[1:30:10] one-year-old baby shoe and he and
[1:30:12] there's an eighth inch eyelet and he got
[1:30:15] about a half inch line and he's trying
[1:30:17] to put it in there
[1:30:20] and and and and it's kind of coming down
[1:30:22] and all piled up on the floor and he's
[1:30:24] trying to put it in there and the angel
[1:30:25] of the Lord now in this vision says you
[1:30:27] can't teach babies supernatural things
[1:30:29] and later he would pick that up again
[1:30:31] and say, "You can't teach Pentecostal
[1:30:32] babies supernatural things because
[1:30:34] you'll cause carnal impersonations."
[1:30:37] Brother Brandham, uh, you know, he says,
[1:30:38] "My life's an open book. I just if I sp
[1:30:40] I just tell it." He was always
[1:30:42] explaining to the people the gift in his
[1:30:44] life. And the angel Lord is telling him
[1:30:46] because you're explaining it, you're
[1:30:48] causing a carnal impersonations. and and
[1:30:50] and he he he he as he tells him that he
[1:30:54] he looks down and he sees that the line
[1:30:56] tapers down and all the way on the other
[1:30:59] end it's down to the right size that if
[1:31:02] you would just start at the right end
[1:31:04] and it would thread right through. And
[1:31:06] he as he as he reached down to pick that
[1:31:08] up, he says the the the angel of the
[1:31:09] Lord took him deeper or higher into the
[1:31:11] vision.
[1:31:13] and and um and now he says he was
[1:31:16] sitting at a lake, a great big beautiful
[1:31:18] lake. And and he said when he reached
[1:31:21] down to pick up that line, he said it
[1:31:23] was a fishing pole. And he said he saw
[1:31:26] all these fishermen out around the lake
[1:31:28] and and they were all catching little
[1:31:29] bitty fish. But he saw way out there in
[1:31:32] the deep water, he saw these big rainbow
[1:31:34] trout. And he said something something
[1:31:37] in my heart said, "I I'd like to catch
[1:31:40] those."
[1:31:41] And the angel of the Lord said, "I'll
[1:31:43] teach you how to fish."
[1:31:48] And he says, "Now just throw it out
[1:31:50] there in the water, let it sink down
[1:31:52] really deep and then pull."
[1:31:56] He says, "You know, now that's a really
[1:31:57] a fisherman's tactic."
[1:32:00] And he said, "That'll attract fish in."
[1:32:02] He said, "Now, you know, now pull it
[1:32:05] again." second pool. He said, uh uh some
[1:32:08] some of the smaller fish will scatter,
[1:32:09] but that'll track the big fish. And he
[1:32:11] said that third pool, you set the hook.
[1:32:14] So when we when we talk about the pool,
[1:32:17] when you hear us refer to the third
[1:32:18] pool, we I you could maybe just come
[1:32:23] into the third pool, if you know,
[1:32:25] brother Brandon, we this is if you boil
[1:32:27] it all down, we know the first pool is
[1:32:28] healing.
[1:32:30] The second pool is the revealing of the
[1:32:33] secrets and intents of the heart. And
[1:32:34] the third pool is the opening of the
[1:32:37] word. So whenever we're receiving re
[1:32:40] referring to a pool, understand that
[1:32:41] this was a vision that God had given to
[1:32:44] the prophet and and and we'll call it a
[1:32:47] pool because he he t the angel of the
[1:32:49] Lord typed those things to the prophet.
[1:32:52] And now that the the angel lord showed
[1:32:54] him those things and he he it's the son
[1:32:56] of man ministry. He would liken those
[1:32:58] and see those types in Jesus ministry
[1:33:00] and things like that. So when you hear
[1:33:01] us refer to those things, when we talk
[1:33:03] about the third pull, oh, it's that
[1:33:05] third pull that catches that rainbow
[1:33:07] trout. Brother Brand said the third pull
[1:33:08] was the opening of them seven seals to
[1:33:11] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:33:12] sealed in the word. So when we talk
[1:33:14] about the pull of the rapture, the it's
[1:33:16] the third pull, the opening of the seven
[1:33:19] seals, which is the pool of the rapture.
[1:33:21] It's the opening of the word. Brother
[1:33:23] Benham said in uniting time and sign. He
[1:33:25] said the bride is becoming uh together
[1:33:27] uh the bride is coming together from the
[1:33:29] north, east, south and west. What are
[1:33:31] they uniting for? The rapture. What is
[1:33:33] she uniting with? The word. It's Christ
[1:33:35] coming. It's the bread of life.
[1:33:38] That's the one that you're feeding on.
[1:33:40] So just in our text, are you following
[1:33:41] me? Are we okay? In 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:33:44] says, "For the Lord shall descend him uh
[1:33:47] from heaven with a shout."
[1:33:50] Now,
[1:33:52] brother Brandon, when he preaches the
[1:33:53] rapture message, he's very clear to say,
[1:33:55] "What is the shout?" He says, "It's the
[1:33:58] message going forth.
[1:34:00] First, the living bread of life bringing
[1:34:04] forth the bride." In other places you
[1:34:06] could you could find out where he's
[1:34:07] saying not when the messenger starts
[1:34:08] out.
[1:34:10] First pull healing second pull
[1:34:12] discerning of the thoughts and ts of the
[1:34:13] heart. But when his message is declared
[1:34:16] which is the opening of the word it's
[1:34:18] the revelation of the seven seals which
[1:34:20] which made the book become an open book.
[1:34:25] That is the shout. It's the message
[1:34:28] going forth. And what is the message
[1:34:30] doing?
[1:34:32] It's going forth first the living bread
[1:34:34] of life. And it's bringing forth.
[1:34:37] It's a drawing. It's a It's a pulling.
[1:34:42] It It has an effect on the believer's
[1:34:44] life. And I just want to say we can
[1:34:46] never ever overemphasize
[1:34:49] the importance of the word. We can never
[1:34:52] overemphasize the importance of the
[1:34:55] message. We can never overemphasize the
[1:34:58] importance of listening to Malachi 4:5.
[1:35:01] When you hear those things, when we say
[1:35:03] Malachi 4:5, it's because the word of
[1:35:05] the Lord came to a prophet and he wrote
[1:35:08] the prophecy down in scripture. And when
[1:35:11] you see prophecy being fulfilled, you
[1:35:14] know the hour that you're now living in.
[1:35:17] The fact that we can stand here as
[1:35:20] believers and know that we are living
[1:35:23] right now in the hour that Malachi 4:5
[1:35:26] is already come. He sounded forth his
[1:35:29] message. He has revealed Christ, the
[1:35:32] unveiling of God, the invisible union.
[1:35:34] Oh, we have become in contact with Jesus
[1:35:37] Christ, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:35:40] forever. What an hour that we're now
[1:35:42] living in, church, that we can say these
[1:35:44] things where believers were probing for
[1:35:47] year after year, for thousands of years.
[1:35:49] They wanted to live in the hour that
[1:35:51] we're now living in. And there was
[1:35:52] prophecies laying in the book. Oh,
[1:35:55] Elijah must come. Elijah must come. And
[1:35:57] to think that we can stand here and say
[1:35:59] this day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:36:03] Hallelujah. This day, Malachi 4:5 has
[1:36:07] been fulfilled. This day, Luke 17:30 has
[1:36:11] been fulfilled.
[1:36:13] This day, Revelations 10
[1:36:16] 1-7,
[1:36:18] the mighty angel coming down. I am the
[1:36:23] bread of life. Unless you eat my flesh
[1:36:26] and drink my blood, you will have no
[1:36:28] part in me.
[1:36:31] The whole church world was waiting for
[1:36:34] the hour that we're now living in. And
[1:36:36] and we can stand and say, "This day,
[1:36:39] this scripture is fulfilled."
[1:36:45] Now, if you don't understand that,
[1:36:49] that's okay. Pray for revelation
[1:36:55] because when we say the message,
[1:37:02] it is
[1:37:04] the word made flesh.
[1:37:07] It is the word. It's the I am. It's the
[1:37:12] present tense God.
[1:37:15] It's the God of Isaiah 45. I am the
[1:37:18] Lord.
[1:37:19] And besides me, there's none else. Hey,
[1:37:22] there ain't no other word outside of
[1:37:24] this message. There ain't no other
[1:37:25] truth. There ain't no other doctrine.
[1:37:27] There ain't nothing that'll rapture your
[1:37:29] soul. Uh the Baptists, they're lost. The
[1:37:32] Methodists are lost. I'm talking about
[1:37:34] an organization. Yes, there's grace and
[1:37:36] there's mercy for the individual. But if
[1:37:38] you want to rescue them out of there,
[1:37:40] you better lift up the message. You
[1:37:42] better proclaim the message. You better
[1:37:44] say, "Come and see. We have found the
[1:37:46] Messiah." Hallelujah. That's what the
[1:37:49] word of the hour is to me. It's my
[1:37:51] Messiah.
[1:37:53] It's my bomb shelter. You can dig two
[1:37:56] miles deep. I don't care how far you
[1:37:58] dig. I'm already safe under the wings of
[1:38:01] Jehovah because the mighty angel has
[1:38:03] come down. And I'm in his presence. I'm
[1:38:07] walking with Jehovah.
[1:38:13] I am the Lord. Capital L.
[1:38:18] Capital O,
[1:38:20] capital R,
[1:38:22] capital D. I tell you, if this message
[1:38:24] ain't your Lord,
[1:38:28] what does Lord mean?
[1:38:31] Ownership.
[1:38:36] This message is the fullness of
[1:38:38] redemption.
[1:38:39] I have been bought with a price. Lady,
[1:38:43] you can't have me.
[1:38:45] debt. You can't have me. Mortgage, you
[1:38:48] ain't going to ruin my life. I don't
[1:38:49] need a fancy car. I don't need a fancy
[1:38:52] job. If God give me one, I pray for one
[1:38:54] and I'm glad to have it. But I tell you
[1:38:56] what, I got something else. I've already
[1:38:58] been bought with the price. My Lord,
[1:39:00] capital L O R D, is the revealed truth
[1:39:03] of the hour. And I'm walking with
[1:39:05] Jehovah.
[1:39:08] See, that's the problem.
[1:39:12] Some of us don't want the word to be our
[1:39:16] Lord.
[1:39:21] Oh, I see it.
[1:39:24] Because I know the effect it has on the
[1:39:26] believer's life,
[1:39:28] it changes the way you think,
[1:39:31] the way you act. See, when the word
[1:39:34] becomes your Lord, the prophet of God
[1:39:36] said the Holy Ghost has the same effect
[1:39:38] on every believer.
[1:39:40] You know, some of us allow our job to be
[1:39:43] our Lord.
[1:39:44] Some of us let our marriage be our Lord.
[1:39:47] Some of us let our culture be our Lord.
[1:39:50] Woo. We could stay there a while. I'll
[1:39:52] let somebody else do that.
[1:39:56] Some of us let our pride and our Some of
[1:40:00] us let our our our faults and failures,
[1:40:03] some of us let our trials be our Lord.
[1:40:06] I'm just You don't know. I've had such a
[1:40:09] hard time, Brother Gary. And you know, I
[1:40:11] I've been battling this sickness and you
[1:40:13] know, and I uh you know, I don't know if
[1:40:15] God's ever going to deliver me. Maybe
[1:40:17] it's just my cross to bear. And you
[1:40:19] know, and and my kids, they're doing
[1:40:21] this and you know, and I I haven't
[1:40:23] gotten a raise in a long time. What are
[1:40:26] you talking about?
[1:40:28] Is that is that trial your Lord?
[1:40:31] Sounds to me like you're lifting up your
[1:40:32] trial.
[1:40:35] But my Bible told me in the time of
[1:40:37] trouble,
[1:40:41] he shall hide me in a secret place. Hey,
[1:40:45] we are hidden in a secret place. Now,
[1:40:48] oh, if you go on further, right? So, he
[1:40:51] he's fishing and then the Lord takes him
[1:40:54] deeper. takes him deeper in the vision.
[1:40:57] And now all of a sudden he's in a field
[1:40:58] and there's a great big tent and there's
[1:41:01] all these people and up there on the
[1:41:03] platform there's this little room and
[1:41:05] that pillar of fire come down in the in
[1:41:07] that little room and he said that will
[1:41:09] be the third pool.
[1:41:12] It won't be a public show.
[1:41:17] I'll meet you in there. So and people
[1:41:21] what were they doing? They were coming
[1:41:22] out on the other side. They were happy.
[1:41:25] They were shouting. They were screaming.
[1:41:28] They were healed. They were delivered.
[1:41:30] Now, what happened in there? I don't
[1:41:33] know. Oh, glory to God. Maybe I can't
[1:41:37] exactly explain what happened to me. But
[1:41:39] all I know is I've been pulled. I've
[1:41:41] been drawn by the son of man. The
[1:41:43] revealing of the son of man has caught
[1:41:45] me. There's a hook in me. It's been
[1:41:47] pulling me and drawing me. And I am
[1:41:49] going in a rapture. I'm going to lift
[1:41:51] that up. I ain't going to lift up my
[1:41:53] trial. I ain't going to lift up my
[1:41:55] struggle. I ain't going to lift up the
[1:41:56] bad things that are you kidding me. I'm
[1:41:58] going to put that stuff under our feet
[1:42:00] and I'm going to lift up the revealed
[1:42:01] word of the hour. I'm going to lift up
[1:42:03] Jesus Christ. I'm going to lift up. Hey,
[1:42:05] I'm going in a rapture.
[1:42:10] Faith comes by hearing the word.
[1:42:16] Faith comes by
[1:42:19] hearing the word. Now,
[1:42:23] Y'all ain't got to tell me how to eat.
[1:42:26] I know how to do it.
[1:42:29] And I really know how to gain weight.
[1:42:33] You want to know how to gain weight?
[1:42:35] Eat.
[1:42:38] Eat things that taste good.
[1:42:40] Ain't that strange how that happens? I
[1:42:42] remember telling some brothers like,
[1:42:43] "Wouldn't that be awesome if it was like
[1:42:44] reversed?" Like, "Man, I got to eat
[1:42:46] three more pieces of fried chicken if
[1:42:47] I'm going to lose two pounds.
[1:42:51] I'm like, man, wouldn't that be cool? Be
[1:42:53] like, hey, I need two more servings of
[1:42:54] mashed potatoes and gravy. Go ahead and
[1:42:55] throw me on another another two chicken
[1:42:58] fried steak and mashed potatoes. Like,
[1:43:00] my You're really trying to lose some
[1:43:01] weight, aren't you? Yeah, I'm trying,
[1:43:02] you know, trying to slim down, man.
[1:43:05] Wouldn't that be awesome?
[1:43:07] Like, how many times did you eat today,
[1:43:09] man? I ate 10 times a day. Like, 12.
[1:43:13] Looking good.
[1:43:15] But no, you got to eat.
[1:43:20] If you want revelation,
[1:43:24] you got to eat, church.
[1:43:30] Maybe we could just stop right there.
[1:43:33] You have to feed on the message.
[1:43:39] If you want to go in a rapture,
[1:43:42] you got to eat because it's a rapturing
[1:43:46] faith.
[1:43:48] And faith is a revelation and faith
[1:43:51] comes by.
[1:43:55] You understand that if you want to go in
[1:43:58] a rapture,
[1:44:00] God provided a prophet
[1:44:04] by the name of William Brandham. We call
[1:44:06] him brother William Brandham because
[1:44:08] we've all been bought with a price
[1:44:11] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who
[1:44:13] is the head of the church who put a gift
[1:44:18] in our brother's life named William
[1:44:19] Brandham. He was born a prophet to bring
[1:44:23] a message
[1:44:25] just like Noah brought a message. I was
[1:44:29] having fun last night with Evan. He
[1:44:31] said, "Tell me more story about
[1:44:32] prophets, Dad."
[1:44:34] And so I that was fun. And I was telling
[1:44:36] him what a prophet is.
[1:44:40] God was going to judge the earth with
[1:44:42] water.
[1:44:44] There was only one boat that was going
[1:44:46] to float.
[1:44:49] And God called Noah to give the world a
[1:44:52] message.
[1:44:54] I'm sorry. You can try to debate it all
[1:44:56] you want, but God's provided way in the
[1:44:59] end time
[1:45:01] is the message that was brought to us
[1:45:06] by
[1:45:07] a vindicated prophet according to
[1:45:10] scripture. So God forbid we belittle
[1:45:15] and make these
[1:45:20] when we say Malachi 4:5, don't let that
[1:45:22] become some religious
[1:45:25] regurgitation of information.
[1:45:28] It's salvation.
[1:45:30] It's deliverance. It's my Lord. It's
[1:45:33] it's my Christ.
[1:45:36] It's my life.
[1:45:39] And I just want you to come in contact
[1:45:42] and and to catch the revelation because
[1:45:45] it's God's provided way.
[1:45:52] Well, brother Matthew, then how do I
[1:45:53] eat?
[1:45:55] I'm glad you asked, cuz we got a table
[1:45:58] full.
[1:46:00] Have you ever heard of the table?
[1:46:02] There's food in there.
[1:46:06] Spiritual food in due season. I was
[1:46:09] listening to uh spiritual food in due
[1:46:11] season. and and and and brother Brandham
[1:46:14] he's starting to preach that and he and
[1:46:15] he he and he he he takes uh uh Amos how
[1:46:18] there will be a famine in the land not a
[1:46:20] famine of bread but a famine for hearing
[1:46:22] the Lord and brother Random shows that's
[1:46:24] the hour that we're now living in and he
[1:46:26] takes his text uh for spiritual food in
[1:46:29] due season out of I think it's second
[1:46:30] kings where he's talking about Elijah
[1:46:32] maybe first kings coming to Ahab and
[1:46:34] saying look there ain't going to be
[1:46:36] another rain or drop of rain fall from
[1:46:38] the sky until I call for it and brother
[1:46:42] I want to type I want to now type that
[1:46:45] natural famine in that day with the
[1:46:47] famine that we're now living. Look,
[1:46:49] look, there is a famine for the word of
[1:46:52] God. There is a famine in the land. You
[1:46:54] cannot get fed at a Baptist church. You
[1:46:57] cannot get fed at a Lutheran church. And
[1:46:59] I hate to say it, in some so-called
[1:47:01] message churches, you can hardly get fed
[1:47:04] because they ain't got the right
[1:47:05] perspective. But I want to tell you
[1:47:07] there was a secret place that God had
[1:47:10] ordained for Elijah that he could go and
[1:47:13] that he could receive spiritual food. It
[1:47:15] was a secret place that nobody knew
[1:47:17] about. And brother said, "Thanks be to
[1:47:20] God. There is a secret place where we
[1:47:22] are feeding on the hidden things of
[1:47:24] God." Oh, you want to talk about a pool
[1:47:26] of the rapture? Get in there and eat.
[1:47:29] Get in there and listen. Get in there
[1:47:31] and feed. Listen to that anointed
[1:47:33] prophet. Listen to that anointed word.
[1:47:35] If you ain't got it in your language,
[1:47:37] get it in your language. It'll change
[1:47:39] you. It'll save you. It'll fill you.
[1:47:42] It'll get you into a rapturing
[1:47:44] condition. Hey, I feel the pull of the
[1:47:46] rapture. What is it? It is the son of
[1:47:48] man.
[1:47:51] Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] Well,
[1:47:57] we're we're just getting we're getting
[1:48:00] really right close to the time where
[1:48:01] people just really start feeling better.
[1:48:04] takes it takes a little time for us, you
[1:48:06] know, to start realizing, you know what,
[1:48:07] I do believe this. You know, I got
[1:48:10] excited about the ball game. You know, I
[1:48:12] got excited when I spent the little dial
[1:48:14] at work and and and I won an extra half
[1:48:16] hour for my break, you know. Woo! Yeah.
[1:48:20] You know, I mean, I tell you, I I mean,
[1:48:22] people, it's amazing the things that
[1:48:24] people will get excited about.
[1:48:27] I I'm I'm telling you what, it's amazing
[1:48:30] how people will lose their mind over
[1:48:32] some of the some of the most silliest
[1:48:34] things. They'll they'll get all excited
[1:48:35] and everything and my I don't know. I
[1:48:37] just don't know about it, but I know I
[1:48:39] say it a lot, but it's it's it's nice
[1:48:41] when you come in, you start getting
[1:48:42] washed by the water of the word and all
[1:48:44] the things of the world start falling
[1:48:45] off and and you start to realize, you
[1:48:47] know, my debt ain't that important. Uh
[1:48:49] my my my mortgage ain't as important and
[1:48:51] you know what, even my health, it ain't
[1:48:53] it ain't where I I wanted it to be. and
[1:48:55] maybe my back's really hurting me and
[1:48:56] and it's hard for me to come to service
[1:48:58] every time and and I'm in such pain I I
[1:49:00] barely get anything out of it. Oh, I
[1:49:02] prayed God, may the clouds just roll
[1:49:04] back a little bit and a little ray of
[1:49:05] sunlight shine down in your soul and
[1:49:07] say, you know what, regardless of how I
[1:49:09] feel, regardless of of my mortgage,
[1:49:11] regardless of my debt, regardless of my
[1:49:13] education, hey, I am going in a rapture.
[1:49:17] I am safe under the wings of Jehovah. I
[1:49:20] am in a secret place. And my God told
[1:49:22] me, hey, that'll be the third pull. I
[1:49:24] will meet you in there. Oh, I want to
[1:49:26] say if you're in there, he is there. And
[1:49:29] if you're in his presence, then I say,
[1:49:31] come, what will come, what may, I'm
[1:49:34] happy about it. Hey, I got my corner. I
[1:49:36] got my faith. If that same spirit that
[1:49:39] raised up Jesus Christ dwell in you, it
[1:49:41] will quicken your mortal body. Hey, I'm
[1:49:43] being quickened right now. He's
[1:49:44] quickening my thoughts. He's quickening
[1:49:46] my mind. He's quickening my actions.
[1:49:48] He's quickening me day by day. Why?
[1:49:51] because I'm living in his presence. Oh,
[1:49:53] I'm just happy to be in his presence.
[1:49:55] I'm happy to be feeding on the body word
[1:49:57] of the son of man. I'm happy to be
[1:49:59] living in the third pool. I'm happy
[1:50:01] because I'm in a secret place. Look at
[1:50:03] me like a deer in a mule gate. But I
[1:50:05] know what I'm talking about. Why? I have
[1:50:07] been rescued. I have been saved. I have
[1:50:10] been pulled into his presence. I'm being
[1:50:12] pulled into the rapture. Oh, I'm happy
[1:50:15] about it. Come on.
[1:50:18] Hallelujah. I don't know about you. I'll
[1:50:20] be happy for myself. I'll amen myself.
[1:50:22] I'll shout myself. I'll get happy cuz I
[1:50:25] know what I'm talking about. I am going
[1:50:27] in a rapture. Devil, you can't hold me.
[1:50:30] Sickness, you can't hold me. My flesh,
[1:50:32] it can't hold me. My pride, it can't
[1:50:35] hold me. My sickness, it can't hold me.
[1:50:37] My job, it can't hold me. My faults,
[1:50:40] they can't hold me.
[1:50:44] Hey devil, I'm going. Interruption.
[1:50:48] And you can't stop me.
[1:50:52] Oh, I'm feeling pretty good.
[1:50:56] I'm feeling really good right now. I'm
[1:50:58] ready to start preaching.
[1:51:02] Hallelujah.
[1:51:04] Hallelujah.
[1:51:06] Jesus said, "I am the living bread
[1:51:10] which came down from heaven.
[1:51:13] If any man eat this bread, he shall live
[1:51:15] forever.
[1:51:17] And the bread that I will give is my
[1:51:19] flesh,
[1:51:20] which I will give for the life of the
[1:51:24] world." What?
[1:51:27] John, did you hear that?
[1:51:29] Peter,
[1:51:32] Thomas, quiet down.
[1:51:34] Yeah, but we're not even supposed to
[1:51:38] we can't even
[1:51:41] we're not supposed to eat unclean
[1:51:42] things. Nonetheless a human.
[1:51:47] Brother Brandham said Jesus when he
[1:51:50] started out
[1:51:51] he started healing the sick and
[1:51:53] afflicted. Oh, the great rabbi. He's a
[1:51:56] prophet. Everybody wanted him in his
[1:51:58] church. But when he sat down one day and
[1:52:01] said, "I and my father are one." That
[1:52:04] was different. That was different. And
[1:52:07] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:52:09] man and drink his blood, you have no
[1:52:12] life in you. While he's a vampire.
[1:52:15] That was different. He didn't explain
[1:52:17] it. They had already seen the
[1:52:20] manifestation, the vindication of the
[1:52:21] word of God for his age made real and
[1:52:24] proved to them that he was the messenger
[1:52:26] of that age.
[1:52:29] Are you hearing them?
[1:52:31] I said, "Are you hearing them?"
[1:52:35] Yeah, you can put it back 2,000 years
[1:52:37] ago. Let's fast forward.
[1:52:40] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:52:43] Except eat the fle. He said uh he said
[1:52:46] the word of God of his age made real and
[1:52:49] proved to them that he was the messenger
[1:52:50] of that age. And he didn't have to
[1:52:52] explain nothing. Those disciples might
[1:52:55] not have been able to explain it, but
[1:52:58] they believed it. Whether they could
[1:53:00] explain it or not, thank you, Jesus.
[1:53:07] They sat right still and believed it.
[1:53:10] How could they tell if they was going to
[1:53:13] eat his flesh and drink his blood? Why?
[1:53:15] It is impossible for them to do it. But
[1:53:18] they believed it because they were
[1:53:19] ordained.
[1:53:23] Jesus said he chose them before the
[1:53:26] foundation of the world. See, they
[1:53:29] believed it whether they could explain
[1:53:32] it or not.
[1:53:35] They
[1:53:37] devil, you lost again. Yes, sir. I'm
[1:53:40] sorry. I might not be able to explain
[1:53:42] it. I know you keep trying to make me
[1:53:44] feel little. I know you keep trying to
[1:53:45] make me feel small. I I know I can't tie
[1:53:48] it all together. And I might not be able
[1:53:49] to explain the three pools. And I can't
[1:53:51] take you from Genesis to Revelation. And
[1:53:54] And I don't know how my body's going to
[1:53:55] be changed. I don't know how I'm going
[1:53:58] to be healed. Brother Brandham was
[1:54:00] talking to a brother one time and he
[1:54:01] said he said uh uh uh he he said,
[1:54:04] "Brother Brandon, you you know how's God
[1:54:07] going to do it?" He said, "You want to
[1:54:10] know how God's going to do it?"
[1:54:13] Everybody get ready. He said, "I don't
[1:54:15] know."
[1:54:17] He says, "You mean to tell me there's
[1:54:19] something that's going to come down in
[1:54:20] the building that we can't see, that we
[1:54:23] can't explain, that'll heal your body,
[1:54:25] that will give you rapturing faith?
[1:54:27] How's he going to do it?" I don't know.
[1:54:30] I just know that he said it. And if he
[1:54:32] said it, I believe it. So, I'm going in
[1:54:35] a rapture. Hey, I It might be tomorrow.
[1:54:38] It might be tonight. But you know what?
[1:54:40] I got my corner. I'm going in a rapture.
[1:54:44] Hey, devil. I'm going in a rapture.
[1:54:49] I'm being pulled.
[1:54:57] Everything else is trying to pull you.
[1:55:02] Everything else is trying to pull you.
[1:55:05] Complexes, fears, false, failures. I'm
[1:55:07] going to hit it again.
[1:55:09] We got time.
[1:55:13] Brother Benham said that eating is
[1:55:16] actually partaking in a spiritual sense.
[1:55:21] Oh,
[1:55:23] oh, I am the bread of life.
[1:55:28] I am the hidden man. They said, you
[1:55:31] know, it's funny how Jesus, you know, he
[1:55:33] discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:55:34] our heart. They go, they said, uh, our
[1:55:38] father
[1:55:41] gave us man in the wilderness. I love
[1:55:44] Jesus response.
[1:55:47] He said, Moses didn't give you that
[1:55:48] bread. Listen to who they were calling
[1:55:50] their father.
[1:55:59] Mo Moses didn't give you that bread, but
[1:56:01] my father which is in heaven.
[1:56:05] and I am that bread.
[1:56:08] And unless you eat the flesh of the son
[1:56:11] of man.
[1:56:14] Are you catching what's been made
[1:56:15] available to the church in the day in
[1:56:18] the hour that we're living in? The word
[1:56:20] has been made flesh so you can eat it.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah. The word has been made flesh
[1:56:29] so that the bride can feed on it.
[1:56:32] Oh, glory to God. It's a reality.
[1:56:40] Jesus said, but he answered and said,
[1:56:41] "It is written, man shall not live by
[1:56:43] bread alone, but by every word that
[1:56:44] proceedth out of the mouth of God."
[1:56:47] Now, we just we're going to try to find
[1:56:49] a place to
[1:56:51] work towards. And
[1:56:54] but in John 5:24, Jesus said, "He that
[1:56:56] heareth my word." Yes. Now, Brother
[1:56:59] Brandon would pick that up and he'd say,
[1:57:02] "He that heareth, it's he that
[1:57:04] understandeth." And he would give the
[1:57:06] example and to show how two people could
[1:57:08] sit in a service and they could go out
[1:57:10] and you say that some drunker could have
[1:57:12] his arm around some girl and say, "Hey,
[1:57:13] did you hear the preacher?" Yeah, I
[1:57:15] heard the preacher. Both of them could
[1:57:17] sit there and hear the same word. Just
[1:57:19] like that one testimony, you know, hey,
[1:57:21] how'd you enjoy the service? I didn't
[1:57:22] like what he said. He called me a
[1:57:23] buzzard. He go, well, he called me an
[1:57:24] eagle.
[1:57:27] So we we we've laid a lot of things in
[1:57:30] there.
[1:57:32] But we wrote read that opening quote
[1:57:34] that the rapture is is a revelation.
[1:57:37] Faith is a revelation. So we we want to
[1:57:40] have the understanding,
[1:57:41] right? He that hearth my word, he that
[1:57:43] understandeth my word. I say I pray God
[1:57:46] give me understanding. L Lord give me a
[1:57:48] revelation. I want to know. I I want to
[1:57:50] recognize I want to recognize who I am.
[1:57:52] I want to recognize my purpose and my
[1:57:54] calling. I want to know your word.
[1:57:57] Right? If the prophet said, "Here's the
[1:57:59] secret." You know, just like Mary,
[1:58:00] here's the secret. The word is in the
[1:58:02] bride. She she has the mind of Christ.
[1:58:04] She knows what he wants done with the
[1:58:06] word. Well, that sounds like some a big
[1:58:09] challenge, but no, that's a promise to
[1:58:11] you to know that as you're feeding on
[1:58:13] the secret things of God, you are
[1:58:15] becoming one with the word. It's word
[1:58:17] coming to word. You are becoming that
[1:58:19] word. The word is becoming flesh in you.
[1:58:21] That's what he said. The word is
[1:58:23] becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming
[1:58:24] word. Oh my goodness. Do you see what's
[1:58:27] happening to you as you feed on the
[1:58:29] secret things of God as you have been
[1:58:31] laying in the presence of the sun and
[1:58:33] it's baking out all the droughts. It's
[1:58:35] not a public show. Look, the the whole
[1:58:37] world can't look in and see what's
[1:58:38] happening. But you are in the shikina
[1:58:40] glory. You are in the presence of
[1:58:42] almighty God. You are feeding on the
[1:58:44] secret things of God and the word is
[1:58:46] becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming
[1:58:49] word in you.
[1:58:54] So continuing on
[1:58:57] in why Christ speak he says for you see
[1:58:59] faith sees what God wants done. I hope
[1:59:02] this goes in faith doesn't look at
[1:59:04] present time. Faith doesn't see this
[1:59:06] there. Faith looks to see what God wants
[1:59:08] and it works accordingly. That's what
[1:59:11] faith does. It sees what God wants and
[1:59:14] what God wants done and faith operates
[1:59:17] through that. Saints, you can't operate
[1:59:19] through anything else. It will not
[1:59:21] please your Lord. You if you operate
[1:59:24] through the flesh, if you operate
[1:59:25] through anything else, there's only one
[1:59:27] thing that pleases God, and that's
[1:59:29] faith. It's impossible to please God
[1:59:31] without faith. And everything you do in
[1:59:33] word or deed, do all in the name of the
[1:59:35] Lord Jesus Christ. You got to do it by
[1:59:37] revelation. No man can call him Lord,
[1:59:40] but by Hallelujah. It has to be, it has
[1:59:44] to operate through that. Faith is long
[1:59:46] range vision.
[1:59:48] It doesn't lower its sight. It holds to
[1:59:51] the target. All right, we'll we'll try
[1:59:53] to maybe just be about 15 more minutes
[1:59:55] and we'll we'll try to close down. Faith
[2:00:00] sees what God wants done.
[2:00:03] It holds to the target.
[2:00:07] Many times that's our problems.
[2:00:10] We're getting our eyes off the target.
[2:00:14] We're up and down. We're in and out.
[2:00:16] We're on fire. We're not on fire. We're
[2:00:19] pushed to this side. We're pushed to
[2:00:21] that side. I'm not talking about having
[2:00:23] trials. Don't get that confused. You you
[2:00:27] you can be grieving a lost loved one.
[2:00:29] You could be going through a very hard
[2:00:31] trial. You could have lost a son or a
[2:00:33] daughter and
[2:00:37] God help you. But God God will be be a
[2:00:40] comfort to you. That doesn't depart from
[2:00:43] you. I
[2:00:45] don't ever interpret or let the devil
[2:00:46] try to tell you that you got to get
[2:00:48] victory over I mean uh God bless those
[2:00:51] that have lost dear loved ones that are
[2:00:53] close to them. God will use that
[2:00:55] suffering right unless we we can't reign
[2:00:57] unless we suffer. So if you can be
[2:01:00] encouraged in anything to know that that
[2:01:02] God has allowed this uh trial and but
[2:01:05] but it's not he he brother Rand said he
[2:01:08] would be the author of frustration if it
[2:01:10] didn't have any benefit. Right.
[2:01:12] But but it's that after you have
[2:01:14] suffered a while, you'll be like him. We
[2:01:16] learn obedience through the things that
[2:01:18] we suffer. And the scripture uh clearly
[2:01:20] shows that we we can't reign unless we
[2:01:22] suffer and characters of victory. We we
[2:01:25] got to go through hurts. We got to go
[2:01:27] through pains. And the only thing I can
[2:01:29] sometimes gather is to think that um you
[2:01:33] know, I don't want to invoke my family,
[2:01:34] but uh we have some family that's gone
[2:01:36] through unimaginable heartache. And I
[2:01:38] and I just think to think that God knew
[2:01:41] that they could hold the faith and go
[2:01:43] through that. I see think of what God
[2:01:46] how wonderful that I mean how oh how oh
[2:01:49] God he can he can allow a believer to go
[2:01:52] through the most traumatic trials. But
[2:01:55] he's put something inside of him that
[2:01:56] that'll come out on the other side pure
[2:01:58] as gold a and he'll have a testimony
[2:02:01] that regardless of the pain and the
[2:02:03] hurt, there was something else inside of
[2:02:05] me that was keeping me when I wanted to
[2:02:07] give in. When I wanted to throw in the
[2:02:09] towel, when I wanted to give it quits,
[2:02:11] there was something in me that was
[2:02:13] holding to the target, that was holding
[2:02:15] to the goal.
[2:02:17] If I shall suffer, I shall reign.
[2:02:24] We we could we could go through that
[2:02:26] because we we go through trials. We go
[2:02:27] through seasons. Churches go through
[2:02:29] seasons.
[2:02:31] Families go through seasons. Marriages
[2:02:32] go through seasons. People go through
[2:02:34] seasons. So, we're not talking about
[2:02:36] that. You can you can go through those
[2:02:38] hard times and those hard troubles and
[2:02:40] and we could take some time out, brother
[2:02:41] Brandon would talk about uh uh you know,
[2:02:43] the cloudy skies are are no sign that
[2:02:46] that God's against you and the sunny
[2:02:48] skies are are no sign that he's for you.
[2:02:51] He said, "How do we know that he loves
[2:02:53] us?"
[2:02:55] Because he said so. And the scripture
[2:02:58] says this as we're we're just working
[2:02:59] quickly. In uh Romans 8, he says,
[2:03:02] "Moreover, whom he did predestinate."
[2:03:04] We're we're talking about keeping our
[2:03:05] eye on the target. Whom he did
[2:03:07] predestinate them, he also called, and
[2:03:09] whom he called them, he also justified.
[2:03:10] And whom he justified them, he also
[2:03:12] glorified. What shall we say to these
[2:03:14] things? If God before us, who can be
[2:03:16] against us? Amen. It always comes back
[2:03:19] to the word.
[2:03:21] I I'm I'm wanting to try to maybe anchor
[2:03:23] you somewhere as we come to a close. It
[2:03:26] always comes back to the word. Peter,
[2:03:30] second Peter 1:4 said, "Whereby are
[2:03:31] given unto us exceedingly great and
[2:03:33] precious promises, that by these ye
[2:03:35] might be partakers of divine nature,
[2:03:38] having escaped the corruption that's in
[2:03:39] the world through lust."
[2:03:41] Scripture says, "Be therefore perfect
[2:03:43] even as your heavenly." How are all
[2:03:44] these things? How could this be?
[2:03:49] Well, brother Brenham says this in the
[2:03:50] statue of a perfect man. He says the
[2:03:52] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[2:03:54] changes our nature by sending upon us
[2:03:57] the Holy Spirit. Then we become into
[2:03:59] divine nature of God. Then we become a
[2:04:02] dwelling place for God. Jesus said at
[2:04:04] that day you'll know that I am in the
[2:04:05] father and the father in me and I in you
[2:04:07] and you and me. See know how that God is
[2:04:10] in his church. The church is now
[2:04:12] supposed to be taking the place of
[2:04:13] Christ carrying on his ministry.
[2:04:16] He that believeth on me, the works that
[2:04:18] I do shall he do also. Yet a little
[2:04:20] while and the world seeth me no more,
[2:04:22] and ye shall see me. For I'll be with
[2:04:24] you, even in you to the end of the
[2:04:26] world. See, there it is, carrying out
[2:04:28] his work. Look, Satan's always trying to
[2:04:30] get you to question the word. Satan's
[2:04:32] always trying to get you to question
[2:04:34] your calling. Satan's always trying to
[2:04:36] cause confusion and cause doubt and
[2:04:38] cause frustration and fear. What is he
[2:04:40] trying to do? He's trying to get your
[2:04:41] eyes off the target. He's trying to get
[2:04:43] your eyes off thus sayith the Lord. He's
[2:04:45] trying to get your eyes off the message.
[2:04:50] I mean, we labored in invisible union. I
[2:04:52] mean, my when you start catching the
[2:04:54] revelation, well, start catch. Yeah,
[2:04:56] just start trying to catch it. It's
[2:04:57] eternal. But I mean, the things that's
[2:05:00] laying in there ought to be such a
[2:05:01] strength to the believer to think that
[2:05:04] he put the wedding band of
[2:05:05] predestination on your finger. So that
[2:05:07] when you showed up in this world with
[2:05:09] your first nature, as Paul would preach,
[2:05:11] oh, we we're going to get way too long.
[2:05:13] As Paul would preach in Romans 7, he
[2:05:15] said, "You got to be married to another,
[2:05:16] right? That first nature has to die."
[2:05:18] But God had already slipped the
[2:05:20] pre-wedding man of predestination on
[2:05:22] your finger. Your first me marriage
[2:05:24] wasn't even valid.
[2:05:28] He rigged it again.
[2:05:31] Satan got no claim on you.
[2:05:38] Oh my. Isn't it good? He's always trying
[2:05:42] to cause confusion. But the prophet of
[2:05:45] God, I want to just lay this in here
[2:05:48] now. Five more minutes. Is that okay?
[2:05:52] A few of you. Praise God.
[2:05:55] No true This is out of the SRA church
[2:05:57] age.
[2:05:59] No true believer is any stronger and
[2:06:02] spiritual healthy and alive than his
[2:06:05] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[2:06:08] word of God. as seen by multitudes of
[2:06:11] example in the Old Testament.
[2:06:14] So if we're looking for a rapturing
[2:06:16] faith that can pull the church together
[2:06:19] and give us some supernatural strength,
[2:06:23] no church,
[2:06:25] what did he say? No believer is any
[2:06:28] stronger and spiritual healthy and alive
[2:06:30] than his knowledge of and inherence to
[2:06:31] the pure word of God. That's what
[2:06:35] our messenger of our day has brought the
[2:06:37] church is a pure word.
[2:06:42] In every other age, it's been a partial
[2:06:45] word, a partial truth being mixed with
[2:06:49] men's creeds and ideas.
[2:06:52] But we have received the unadulterated
[2:06:55] word fresh from the throne of heaven. We
[2:06:58] have received the word from Almighty God
[2:07:01] without filter.
[2:07:03] You don't have to wonder.
[2:07:07] We have received. But you're not
[2:07:10] stronger in spiritual healthy and alive
[2:07:12] as your knowledge and adherence to the
[2:07:14] pure word. And so
[2:07:17] we read this scripture last time.
[2:07:19] Philippians 4:13 says, I uh well, we
[2:07:21] know the scripture said, "I can do all
[2:07:23] things through Jesus Christ." But what
[2:07:24] I'm but what I'm working towards is how
[2:07:26] in Ephesians 6:16 it says above all
[2:07:28] taking the shield of faith wherewith you
[2:07:31] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[2:07:33] darts of the wicked.
[2:07:36] Now, I was watching uh some of the the
[2:07:38] news and here we know there's a great
[2:07:43] conflict going on in in uh with Israel,
[2:07:46] which has always been going on,
[2:07:49] but now it's escalated with with Iran
[2:07:52] and these these uh nuclear treaties and
[2:07:55] and all the stuff and oh my just to know
[2:07:57] the inworkings of everything that's
[2:07:59] going on. I mean, we we just hear what
[2:08:00] they want us to know, right? But but one
[2:08:03] thing we know that there's bombs being
[2:08:04] fired. I believe I was talking to
[2:08:05] brother Billy. He said they're they're
[2:08:06] firing a thousand rockets a day over
[2:08:09] there trying to overwhelm uh uh uh
[2:08:11] Israel and their their their defense
[2:08:13] systems. And and you know, I was just uh
[2:08:15] uh uh thinking of that as I I I I I
[2:08:18] watched that and and here, you know,
[2:08:20] they got uh uh they got like the sling
[2:08:23] of David and and and they they got the
[2:08:25] Iron Dome and and and as you watch that,
[2:08:28] you know, it it's it's pretty moving,
[2:08:30] you know, to to to there they're they're
[2:08:32] they're out there and they're they're
[2:08:33] watching the skies and and to think all
[2:08:35] of a sudden here comes thousands of
[2:08:37] missiles coming, but all of a sudden
[2:08:39] you'll see these missiles start firing
[2:08:41] up right out of the city like there
[2:08:43] there's there's rockets positioned
[2:08:46] throughout the CI civilization there in
[2:08:48] Tel Aviv where and all of a sudden
[2:08:49] there's designated areas and all of a
[2:08:51] sudden
[2:08:53] all of a sudden rockets are shooting up.
[2:08:54] You're like what what's happening?
[2:08:56] They're going to intercept. It's our
[2:08:58] protection. I it's our covering. Oh,
[2:09:00] it's the Iron Dome and you see it fly up
[2:09:02] and man they curve over. Boom. and and
[2:09:06] and hit this one. And and I say it's
[2:09:08] kind of it's moving, right? Because it's
[2:09:09] saving lives.
[2:09:11] Thousands of lives.
[2:09:15] But you know what?
[2:09:17] Some of them get through.
[2:09:20] Some of them get through and there's
[2:09:23] there's casualties and there's life
[2:09:25] lost. And I just thought about that, but
[2:09:28] you my Bible told me
[2:09:31] if I take the shield of faith
[2:09:36] It'll quench all
[2:09:41] all.
[2:09:42] That means ain't one getting through.
[2:09:47] We have received a message.
[2:09:50] We have received a revelation that not
[2:09:52] one missile can get through.
[2:09:55] Every attack of the devil, if you just
[2:09:59] lift up that shield of faith, it will
[2:10:02] stop every attack of the enemy. It will
[2:10:05] quench every fiery dart. And I'm trying
[2:10:09] to get your eyes back on the target.
[2:10:11] Many of us, we get discouraged. We We
[2:10:14] get run down. We make a mistake. We make
[2:10:16] a failure. And you know, we want I want
[2:10:17] another refilling. I want another
[2:10:19] baptism of the Holy Lift back up your
[2:10:21] shield.
[2:10:24] the musicians would come.
[2:10:26] Get your eyes back on the target.
[2:10:33] In the Pat's vision, he said, "Fear not.
[2:10:35] Don't be afraid. I am the first and the
[2:10:37] last. I am he that liveth." You know, if
[2:10:40] if that would be okay. Sister Julia here
[2:10:44] and Sister Haley and Sister Hannah and
[2:10:47] Sister Abigail, I really like that song
[2:10:49] special. That was a blessing to me.
[2:10:51] Would y'all be okay to sing that?
[2:10:54] Take me deeper,
[2:10:56] deeper into this message. Lord,
[2:10:59] deeper in love, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:04] Fear not. Don't be afraid. I am the
[2:11:07] first and the last. I am he that liveth
[2:11:08] and was dead. And behold, I am alive
[2:11:10] forever more. What is there to fear? The
[2:11:12] judgment that fell at him at the cross
[2:11:14] and at the grave. And when he descended
[2:11:16] was for us.
[2:11:18] He absorbed the full brunt of the wound
[2:11:22] of sin. And there is therefore now no
[2:11:24] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:11:27] Jesus. See for assurityity, our attorney
[2:11:31] is our judge. He is both attorney and
[2:11:34] judge. As judge, the case is
[2:11:41] settled.
[2:11:43] It's finished. There is there now for an
[2:11:46] old condemnation to them. Why should the
[2:11:50] church fear?
[2:11:56] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:11:57] for the evidence.
[2:12:00] I got an evidence.
[2:12:03] How many times are we looking for an
[2:12:07] answer
[2:12:09] that God has already given you? Yes,
[2:12:13] sir.
[2:12:15] How many times do people and and and I
[2:12:17] love the word of God because I I'll be
[2:12:20] very very quick.
[2:12:23] God is we we have a church body. If God
[2:12:25] anoints your faith to be prayed for, God
[2:12:27] will present the opportunity. If if if
[2:12:29] you need an altar, if you need prayer,
[2:12:31] uh God works through those things.
[2:12:33] That's wonderful. And God uses those
[2:12:35] things. And I just want to say that many
[2:12:37] times we're looking for an answer that
[2:12:39] God has already given. and and we'll
[2:12:43] just maybe if God would pick it up
[2:12:44] another time. That's where you move on.
[2:12:45] And why Christ speak? He starts to talk
[2:12:47] about Moses. Hear Moses. After all
[2:12:50] they've been through and after all that
[2:12:52] God's done. Well, what am I going to do?
[2:12:55] What am I going to do now? Are you
[2:12:58] kidding me? You are the vindicated
[2:13:00] prophet by signs and wonders. You just
[2:13:03] went down to Egypt with a stick in your
[2:13:06] hand and defeated Pharaoh and now you
[2:13:09] got a puddle of water in front of you
[2:13:10] and you're worried, right?
[2:13:14] And what did Brother Brandham say? He
[2:13:15] said, "You know what? I realize I've
[2:13:16] gotten that way."
[2:13:18] Well, if Brother Brandham got that way,
[2:13:21] if you can start playing it.
[2:13:23] What about us,
[2:13:25] church?
[2:13:28] It's the third pool.
[2:13:30] It's the pool of the rapture.
[2:13:33] Get your eyes off the things of this
[2:13:34] world.
[2:13:36] Get your eyes back on the target. He
[2:13:39] called you. If he called you, he already
[2:13:43] rigged this thing.
[2:13:45] Wedding band of predestination. Hookline
[2:13:48] of predestination.
[2:13:50] All he wants you to do is get your eyes
[2:13:51] on the word. Hey, I want to be your
[2:13:53] Lord.
[2:13:55] I I I took care of the problems. Let me
[2:13:58] be your Lord. Lord, don't come in there.
[2:14:01] Don't come in that room. I've been hurt.
[2:14:05] And it was somebody that believed this
[2:14:07] message. They were supposed to be a an
[2:14:09] example to me and they hurt me. That's
[2:14:12] why I can't give my all. I'm always up
[2:14:14] and down. I I took care of that. Just
[2:14:16] come to me. Let me be your Lord. That
[2:14:19] means ownership. That means I took care
[2:14:21] of those problems,
[2:14:23] faults, failures, complexes. You just
[2:14:25] let let that go. Come to me.
[2:14:30] You are predestinated. Yes.
[2:14:33] There's therefore now no condemnation to
[2:14:35] them that are in Christ Jesus. Don't
[2:14:37] worry about that. Get your eyes on the
[2:14:40] rapture.
[2:14:42] Get your eyes on the message.
[2:14:44] Like that corner. Let's start being
[2:14:46] happy and excited about the message. Go
[2:14:49] ahead.
[2:14:52] There is a longing
[2:14:57] only you can fill
[2:15:02] a raging tempest. Yes, Lord Jesus. Only
[2:15:07] you can still let God just deal with
[2:15:10] your heart now. My soul is thirst.
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:19] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:15:22] Drink from the river
[2:15:26] that flows before your throne.
[2:15:32] Take me deeper.
[2:15:35] Yes, Lord Jesus. Deeper in love
[2:15:40] with you. Help us, Lord. Jesus, hold me
[2:15:45] close in your embrace.
[2:15:49] Why don't you make that a prayer right
[2:15:51] now? Take me deeper. Take me deeper,
[2:15:53] Lord Jesus.
[2:15:56] Deeper than I've ever been before.
[2:16:01] I just want to love you more and more.
[2:16:06] How I long
[2:16:08] to be deeper
[2:16:11] in love.
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:17] Sunrise to
[2:16:21] I will seek your face.
[2:16:26] Drawn by the spirit
[2:16:30] to the promise of your grace.
[2:16:36] My heart is found in you.
[2:16:43] Have you found it?
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:47] Why don't we all just worship together
[2:16:49] now?
[2:16:50] Yes, Lord Jesus. Take me deeper, oh God.
[2:16:55] Take me deeper,
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:00] deeper in love
[2:17:03] with you.
[2:17:05] Oh Jesus, hold me close in your embrace.
[2:17:14] Take me deeper,
[2:17:18] just deeper than I've ever been before.
[2:17:24] I just want to love you more and more.
[2:17:29] How I long
[2:17:31] to be. Is that your heart's desire?
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:38] Take me deeper.
[2:17:42] Why don't you make that a prayer?
[2:17:44] Lord, I want to go deeper. I want to
[2:17:47] know you, Lord. Jesus, hold me close. I
[2:17:52] don't want to just hear the word.
[2:17:55] I want to know your word. Take me
[2:17:58] deeper. I want to understand
[2:18:01] deeper than I've ever
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:04] [Applause]
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] love
[2:18:09] and
[2:18:11] how I
[2:18:14] bear. Let's just sing that verse one
[2:18:17] again. Y'all just go ahead and join in.
[2:18:22] There is a longing
[2:18:27] only you can y'all. Just feel free to
[2:18:30] worship the Lord. A raging tempest
[2:18:35] that only you can still
[2:18:41] my soul is thirsting Lord to know you as
[2:18:47] I know.
[2:18:50] Drink from the river
[2:18:54] that flows before your throne.
[2:19:00] Take me deeper,
[2:19:04] deeper in love
[2:19:07] with you,
[2:19:10] Jesus. Hold me close in your
[2:19:15] grace.
[2:19:18] Take me deeper,
[2:19:23] deeper than I've ever been before.
[2:19:28] I just want to love you more and more.
[2:19:33] How I long
[2:19:35] to be deeper.
[2:19:38] Amen. Thank you, sisters. Let's just try
[2:19:41] that together. Take me deeper,
[2:19:47] deeper in love. Let's all stand.
[2:19:53] Jesus, hold me close
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:19:57] and grace.
[2:20:00] Oh, take me deeper.
[2:20:05] Oh, deeper than I've ever been before.
[2:20:10] I just want to love you more and more.
[2:20:17] [Music]
[2:20:21] If we can sing Draw Me. Amen. Amen. Is
[2:20:24] that your heart's desire
[2:20:26] is to go deeper?
[2:20:30] Deeper in love with him.
[2:20:34] If you want to fall in love with him, if
[2:20:36] you want to get him know to know him
[2:20:38] more, brother Brandham talks about get
[2:20:40] to know one another.
[2:20:42] Get to know God's people. There's some
[2:20:44] incredible testimonies in our church
[2:20:48] at just sharing what God has done for
[2:20:50] one another can set your soul on fire.
[2:20:54] If you're having a hard time testifying
[2:20:56] at work or testifying at school, I'll
[2:21:00] listen.
[2:21:02] Brother Billy, will you listen?
[2:21:05] I want to know. You mean God done
[2:21:08] something for you? I love that stuff.
[2:21:11] Oh, I don't CNN, ESPN,
[2:21:15] Fox,
[2:21:18] that ain't going to help me go in
[2:21:19] rapture. What did God do for you?
[2:21:23] Well, I believe it.
[2:21:26] You believe that, Brother M? Yeah, he
[2:21:28] he'll he'll give you something right out
[2:21:29] of thin air. I believe it. You mean he
[2:21:32] protected you from a Hallelujah. That's
[2:21:34] the God we serve.
[2:21:36] What did our text say? Comfort ye one
[2:21:40] another with these words. I don't know
[2:21:43] how else to comfort you but tell you the
[2:21:45] message of the hour. I mean, we're we
[2:21:48] the Lord shall descend with a shout. Can
[2:21:50] you imagine? He wrote that was written
[2:21:52] over 2,000 years ago and said, "Comfort
[2:21:55] ye one another." And then now we're
[2:21:56] living in the manifestation of it.
[2:22:00] We've actually heard the shout and now
[2:22:02] the voice of the archangels coming in
[2:22:05] and and the bride is the voice to the
[2:22:07] the final age. And to think that you
[2:22:10] want to talk about a comfort,
[2:22:12] we're living in it. Amen. Let's just
[2:22:15] close out the service. Maybe I'll just
[2:22:17] say a quick word of prayer. We don't
[2:22:18] want to hold you too long. Lord Jesus,
[2:22:21] we are just so thankful that
[2:22:24] [Music]
[2:22:27] your word has come to us in the day and
[2:22:28] the hour that we're now living in.
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:34] Lord, we
[2:22:36] maybe many times get excited and
[2:22:38] sometimes Lord, we allow the message to
[2:22:40] become common to us. Oh God, may it
[2:22:43] never become a religion in our thinking.
[2:22:46] We know the message cannot denominate.
[2:22:49] Sometimes Lord, we fight in the flesh
[2:22:50] and we allow things to become common and
[2:22:53] it just becomes a sane and we we lose
[2:22:55] the importance and the reality Lord. But
[2:22:58] as that song said, Lord, take me deeper.
[2:23:02] I want to be deeper in love with you in
[2:23:03] this message, Lord. Lord, renew a hunger
[2:23:06] in my heart for your word.
[2:23:09] Lord, I I think about how many times in
[2:23:12] a relationship when it first gets going,
[2:23:15] oh, you just can't wait to get on that
[2:23:17] phone. We can't make wait to make that
[2:23:18] call. And
[2:23:20] Lord, may we get that passion back in
[2:23:23] our heart for the message where I just
[2:23:25] can't wait to read my Bible. I can't
[2:23:27] wait to listen to the rest of that
[2:23:28] message. I can't wait to go to church.
[2:23:32] Lord, on this Father's Day, Lord, I pray
[2:23:34] you help me to be a better father. Lord,
[2:23:38] help me to be a better leader, a better
[2:23:39] example, and
[2:23:42] a better witness. Lord, and create a
[2:23:45] better atmosphere in the home. Lord,
[2:23:48] you're our heavenly father, and you've
[2:23:50] been a perfect example.
[2:23:52] And you've given us everything that
[2:23:54] we've ever had need of. You've provided
[2:23:57] for us time and time again, Lord. And to
[2:23:59] think now that we're living in the hour
[2:24:01] of the third revealed word where we're
[2:24:04] in a secret place, hidden on the secret
[2:24:05] things of God and that the world knows
[2:24:08] nothing about.
[2:24:10] But yet, Lord, we're safe from all harm.
[2:24:13] with a faith and a revelation of this
[2:24:15] rapture that's unfolding right before
[2:24:16] our very own eyes, Lord. It should bring
[2:24:18] such joy and such peace, but it also
[2:24:20] should create an urgency within our
[2:24:22] heart for lost souls, Lord, to get them
[2:24:24] in. We don't know in what day or what
[2:24:27] hour that final door will close, Lord,
[2:24:29] but it's soon. We know. We thank you for
[2:24:32] visiting with us, Father.
[2:24:34] Lord, may you just be our portion now as
[2:24:36] we go and as we sing a few songs in
[2:24:39] worship. We ask it in your name, the
[2:24:41] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you.
[2:24:44] Oh, and draw
[2:24:48] me.
[2:24:51] Draw the Lord
[2:24:55] and I'll come running after you.
[2:25:02] Oh, and draw
[2:25:05] me.
[2:25:08] Draw me, Lord,
[2:25:12] and I'll come running after you.
[2:25:18] Oh, and troll
[2:25:22] me.
[2:25:24] [Music]

[2:25:38] me.
[2:25:42] From me, Lord.
[2:25:45] Oh, I come running after you.
[2:25:52] Oh, and you're alone.
[2:25:57] I need you.
[2:26:01] for your whole.

[2:26:09] Oh, and you alone
[2:26:11] are ally.
[2:26:16] Oh, I need in you. Is that your
[2:26:19] testimony this morning?

[2:39:47] I gather with him.
[2:39:51] and the savior worth
[2:39:54] to prepare the bed with wonderless.
[2:40:02] [Music]
[2:40:10] Oh,
[2:40:13] I got a redee.
[2:40:17] And the redeemed
[2:40:20] I got a ring.
[2:40:22] Oh, and watch that snow.
[2:40:30] I will shout
[2:40:33] and I will sing.
[2:40:36] Oh, wonder.
[2:40:40] I got a redee.
[2:41:06] Hallelujah.
[2:41:14] Hallelujah.
[2:41:25] Heat. Heat.
[2:41:34] [Music]
