[9:39] I was just thinking of faith,

[9:48] tree. and all of the promises that were
[9:51] linked to faith. [music]
[9:54] Just that little bit of faith that we've
[9:55] had in our life and [music] what God can
[9:57] do with it and multiply it. Lord, we
[10:00] just ask you to
[10:02] increase our faith as we hear the word,
[10:04] [music] Lord, that it would take root in
[10:07] our lives, Father, and produce after
[10:09] [music] its kind, Father.
[10:12] Lord, we just ask that your spirit
[10:15] move upon each heart here, Lord, as the
[10:18] word would come forth, Lord. It would
[10:20] drop in the right atmosphere, Lord. That
[10:22] it would take root, Lord, [music] and
[10:25] weed out all the things of the world,
[10:27] Lord. All the things that hinder us,
[10:30] Father.
[10:35] Lord, we just thank [music] you, Father,
[10:36] for your presence, Lord. We feel you are
[10:38] here, Lord. We know by promise, Lord,
[10:40] that where two or three you're gathered
[10:42] in your midst, you're here, Father. And
[10:44] we feel you [music] and we see you in
[10:46] each life, Lord. And we're just thankful
[10:49] that, Lord, you've given us ears to
[10:50] hear, Lord. We ask [music] that you
[10:52] remove any draws from our ears, Lord,
[10:55] and give us the Isab we [music] need,
[10:57] Lord.
[10:59] Bless this service, Lord. We give you
[11:01] the preeminence, Lord. And we ask
[11:04] [music] you to help each one in whatever
[11:05] season they're in. In Jesus Christ's
[11:08] name we pray. Amen.
[11:11] [snorts]
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may turn and shake
[11:14] someone's hand and you may be seated.

[32:26] Lord we want to thank you for the call
[32:28] of God that you've placed in our life
[32:29] Lord that we would come here not to be
[32:32] seen of man Lord but to hear from our
[32:34] creator [music] the one who formed this
[32:36] earth and created the heavens. We know
[32:39] that you're present right here with us
[32:41] by divine promise. [music]
[32:43] And Lord, you ordained to use a vessel
[32:46] that you would speak through. [music]
[32:47] And that word would bring forth a faith
[32:49] that would make the word become a living
[32:52] reality in the believer's life. And
[32:54] Lord, we pray that we'll just take one
[32:56] more step towards that body change and
[32:57] the catching away. We love you, Lord. We
[33:00] thank you for [music] each one that's
[33:01] come, our visitors that have been able
[33:03] to come. Lord, I pray a special blessing
[33:05] for them. We're just looking to you now
[33:07] and ask that you come and break the
[33:08] bread of life as only you can. We just
[33:11] ask it in your name, the Lord Jesus
[33:12] Christ.
[33:14] Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. If you
[33:15] have your Bibles, um I want to be
[33:17] reading out of um
[33:20] Acts chapter 2 and also Ephesians 2:8.
[33:23] So maybe we'll read Ephesians 2:8 uh
[33:26] first and we'll just see how uh we'll
[33:28] progress through this little thought we
[33:30] had in our mind. we on our heart we just
[33:34] um
[33:36] see how the Lord would bring this out.
[33:38] Um you can just keep it there on the
[33:40] opening slide. They're identified by the
[33:42] pillar of fire slide one. That's where
[33:44] we want to just stay there and reading
[33:47] out of Ephesians uh 2 and 8. I just want
[33:50] to read this here as uh if we have the
[33:53] time to get um towards a little further
[33:57] in this thought. Um, but Ephesians 2:8
[34:00] says, "For by grace are you saved
[34:02] through faith,
[34:04] and that not of yourselves, it is the
[34:06] gift of God." Amen. You may be seated. I
[34:09] I always love the word and encouraged by
[34:12] the word, especially when you read
[34:14] things that eliminate your humanity as a
[34:17] part of the as a part of the process.
[34:20] you know, I mean, uh, I don't know any
[34:21] of you, uh, but, uh, if you've ever
[34:23] received a gift, um, you know, it's
[34:26] something that's given to you and and of
[34:29] course your kids, a lot of times they
[34:30] ask for certain things, but you know,
[34:32] when somebody just comes up and says,
[34:33] "Here, I want to give this to you."
[34:35] They're not requiring um, maybe anything
[34:38] back. Of course, we as humans many time
[34:41] we we're we're maybe a little selfish in
[34:43] giving because we want to get back. But,
[34:45] you know, the the Lord freely gave, he
[34:47] laid down his life for us. And and I
[34:49] love that scripture, Ephesians 2:8. It
[34:51] it's a gift and we there ain't no works.
[34:53] There's nothing that we can do. There's
[34:54] nothing that we can boast about it. And
[34:57] it's by faith. And just I want to um
[34:59] just read in Acts chapter 2. Um also
[35:04] just to this will be tie together with a
[35:06] quote for our um thought here in Acts
[35:09] chapter 2 verse 1 through 4. And if you
[35:12] have your Bibles, feel free to um try to
[35:15] follow along. We'll be putting up some
[35:16] scriptures and quotes and just see how
[35:19] the Lord progress. I'm I'm wanting to be
[35:21] short. We've had a long day, especially
[35:23] uh with the Sunday school kids and and
[35:25] those that have been helping. We thank
[35:27] so much and um you know, just as things
[35:29] continue to open up, it seems like it
[35:31] keeps getting uh bigger and bigger, but
[35:34] we'll try to move quickly and by God's
[35:36] grace find a place to close. Acts 2 1-4
[35:39] says, "And when the day of Pentecost was
[35:40] fully come, they were all in one accord
[35:42] in one place. And suddenly there came a
[35:44] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[35:46] wind, and it filled all the house where
[35:48] they were sitting. And there appeared
[35:50] unto them cloven tongues like as fire,
[35:53] and it sat upon each of them, and they
[35:55] were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
[35:57] began to speak with other tongues, as
[36:00] the Spirit gave them utterance." Now, I
[36:03] just want to read this quote. Um, I just
[36:05] maybe I find out how do I advance it on
[36:07] here?
[36:10] You want to somebody Do I hit enter? Do
[36:12] I hit uh forward backwards? Let's see
[36:14] here. I I don't know. I'd like to get
[36:17] that set up in the beginning uh to see
[36:18] if I can advance this um to see if it'll
[36:21] work. I want to move to a quote out of
[36:24] questions and answers. Um and that's uh
[36:28] really be the source of my inspiration.
[36:31] If we're not able to advance it, I can
[36:33] just have them. Um, now what am I
[36:35] hitting to advance it?
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, then. Thank you very much. All
[36:39] right. My brother David always to the
[36:40] rescue. All right. Questions and
[36:42] answers. Brother Brandham says this. Now
[36:44] on the day of pen, now on the day of
[36:46] Pentecost, it come down the pillar of
[36:48] fire and broke apart like that. And
[36:50] tongues of fire sat upon each of them.
[36:52] Not their tongues, but tongues of fire
[36:54] set upon each of them. an elected
[36:56] selected group identified by this pillar
[36:59] of fire showing that God had separated
[37:02] himself into man. Do you get it? God the
[37:05] logos separated himself into man. God
[37:10] not in one person. He's in his church
[37:12] universal. That's the reason Jesus said
[37:14] the works that I do shall you do also
[37:17] more. Now I I know the King James says
[37:20] greater but but the right translation
[37:21] there is more than this shall you do.
[37:23] God was bottled and confined in one man,
[37:27] Jesus Christ, but now he's bottled and
[37:29] confined in the whole universal church
[37:32] of the living God. And that's what I
[37:35] just want to maybe minister to you on
[37:37] this evening. Uh by the help of God is
[37:40] identified by the pillar of fire. And
[37:42] and if we can just move into a thought
[37:44] here, we'll also maybe mention the
[37:47] characteristics of a believer. But just
[37:50] what's on our heart is is ministering to
[37:52] you on identified by the pillar of fire.
[37:55] And notice he said tongues of fire set
[37:57] upon each of them an elected selected
[38:00] group identified by this pillar of fire
[38:03] showing that God had separated himself
[38:06] into man. So it was the same life. It
[38:09] was the same works. It was the same
[38:11] actions. It was the same ministry of
[38:13] Jesus Christ. But now it was tabernacle
[38:16] in itself in a many membered body. Amen.
[38:19] you believe that? So, it was the same
[38:21] life, same ministry, and we know that
[38:23] Christ and the bride is becoming one.
[38:26] And brother Brandham said why? It's the
[38:27] most beautiful thing you could ever see.
[38:30] And and in this questions and answers,
[38:33] uh they're asking brother Brandham the
[38:35] question. They're saying I is if if the
[38:37] son of man and the pillar of fire are
[38:39] the same thing. And and what a really
[38:41] good question. And brother Brandham just
[38:42] says, "Was the pillar of fire the son of
[38:44] man?" No. The pillar of fire is the
[38:46] anointing. And so we KNOW THE PROPHET
[38:49] HAS TAUGHT US CHRIST is the anointing.
[38:52] He said in in I believe it's in um a
[38:55] paradox he says Christ is the anointing.
[38:58] The spirit that comes upon the word that
[39:00] quickens the word to make it live. So
[39:03] what is going to make that word live?
[39:05] It's going to be the anointing that
[39:07] comes upon the word and quickens that
[39:09] word and makes it a living reality. Uh
[39:12] it's and what was it? It's the very
[39:14] logos. It's the very logos that the
[39:17] fullness of God that was in Christ
[39:18] Jesus. And on the day of Pentecost, what
[39:21] did he do? He broke that apart and you
[39:23] saw tongues and licks of fire settling
[39:25] down upon man. And now a portion of that
[39:27] logos was in a many membered bride body.
[39:31] And we believe and know that the word of
[39:33] God has been swed into us. Brother
[39:35] Brandon would even make a mention about
[39:36] the disciples that the word was swed
[39:39] into them. And then as they were
[39:40] gathered together on the day of
[39:42] Pentecost, Christ came upon that seed
[39:45] word and anointed that word bringing it
[39:47] to a reality or in a manifestation. And
[39:50] and I and I pray that that word is in
[39:52] your heart. And and I believe you know
[39:54] there's many things are a paradox, but
[39:56] God put a predestinated seed on the
[39:58] inside of you. And and it's when that
[40:01] word comes and strikes that seed and
[40:03] faith comes by hearing that word and you
[40:05] believe it, then the spirit of God comes
[40:07] and waters that seed. It be begins to
[40:09] grow into the fullness of the very
[40:11] thought that God had of you in his mind
[40:14] from the very beginning. And I love that
[40:16] because there's nothing that can stop
[40:17] that.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Now, just just kind of want to just lay
[40:21] a foundation here uh in questions and
[40:23] answers. Brother Brandon would say this.
[40:25] He uh continuing on he says now that
[40:27] pillar of fire is the logos that went
[40:30] out of God. The logos which is actually
[40:33] the attribute of the fullness of God.
[40:37] When God become into a form to where it
[40:39] could be seen. It was the anointing of
[40:42] the great spirit that went forth. It's
[40:45] condescending coming down. God the
[40:47] father the logos that was up over
[40:49] Israel. He was holy. He could not bear
[40:52] sin. a and and just oh, YOU COULD YOU
[40:55] COULD GET OUT THERE AND START THINKING
[40:56] ABOUT the unveiling of God and God
[40:58] CONDESCENDING AND AND GOD AND morphe and
[41:00] and we could start to get into ALL THOSE
[41:02] THOUGHT THOUGHTS. And I encourage you to
[41:04] study the message of the hour and to
[41:05] look at how brother Brandham brings many
[41:07] of those things out. But I I just want
[41:09] to uh uh uh show this here in Exodus 13
[41:12] and 21. It says, "And the Lord went
[41:15] before them by day, a a pillar of cloud
[41:18] to lead them the way, and by night in a
[41:21] pillar of fire to give them light to go
[41:23] by day and night." He took not away the
[41:26] pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar
[41:28] of fire by night from before the people.
[41:31] And so you you're starting to, BROTHER
[41:33] GRANT HAVE SHOWN THIS LOGOS, THIS THIS
[41:35] THAT THAT GOD HAD FORMED HIMSELF INTO.
[41:37] You know, you could never even begin TO
[41:39] TO GRASP GOD OR EVEN THE CONCEPT OF THE
[41:41] LOGOS is such a paradox. But yet HE
[41:44] SHOWS HOW GOD IN MORPHE, GOD JUST
[41:45] FORMING HIMSELF now into the logos,
[41:48] maybe this this great burning LIGHT OR
[41:50] THIS GREAT FIRE. AND NOW YOU COULD
[41:52] ACTUALLY PICK IT UP in scripture and
[41:54] actually see where this great fil FIRE
[41:57] OR THIS PILLAR OF FIRE or this logos is
[41:59] actually according to scripture, IT'S A
[42:01] PILLAR OF CLOUD BY DAY to them to lead
[42:03] them in the way and it's a pillar of
[42:05] fire by night. and and and that might
[42:08] not mean a lot to a LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT I
[42:10] I THINK IT'S PROFOUND TO ME to think
[42:12] that the same PILLAR OF CLOUD THAT WAS
[42:15] LEADING the children of Israel, we
[42:17] understand that that there would be a
[42:19] season and a time that it would lead the
[42:21] children OF ISRAEL THROUGH THE
[42:22] WILDERNESS AND THEN HE WOULD BUILD A
[42:24] TABERNACLE OF BADGER SKINS AND THEN THAT
[42:26] THAT PILLAR OF CLOUD AND THAT PILLAR OF
[42:27] FIRE WOULD COME AND IT WOULD TABERNACLE
[42:29] ITSELF INTO A TENT AND AND YOU WOULD NO
[42:32] MORE MAYBE SEE IT OUT THERE, BUT YOU
[42:33] WOULD KNOW BEHIND IN THE SHAKINA OF
[42:35] GLORY BY PROMISE THAT PILLAR OF FIRE,
[42:37] THAT LOGOS IN THE HOLIEST OF HOLIES. IT
[42:39] WAS THERE. And then as you would follow
[42:41] through the scripture, you would see it.
[42:42] IT WOULD COME BACK. WHAT YOU would see
[42:44] the Holy Spirit descending AS A A DOVE
[42:46] UPON OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. AND THEN YOU
[42:48] READ INTO in into ACTS AND THAT LOGOS,
[42:51] that pillar of fire. NOW IT'S BREAKING
[42:52] APART LIKE CLOVEN TONGUES UPON THE
[42:54] DISCIPLES. AND THEN IF YOU FOLLOW LATER
[42:56] IN the scripture, what do you see? YOU
[42:57] SEE IT STRIKING DOWN PAUL. A AND AND I
[43:00] SAY A AFTER 2,000 YEARS TO THINK we are
[43:03] a privileged PEOPLE THAT WE CAN SEE A
[43:05] picture of that pillar of cloud that was
[43:09] LEADING THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. And to
[43:12] think THAT THAT PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS
[43:14] THERE AT NIGHT IS THE SAME PILLAR OF
[43:16] FIRE THAT HAD ITS PICTURE TAKEN ABOVE
[43:19] MALACHI 4:5 WHICH THE MINISTRY OF
[43:21] WILLIAM BRANDON WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF
[43:23] MALACHI 4:5, LUKE 17:30, REVELATIONS
[43:27] 10:7. WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS THE mighty
[43:29] angel coming down and in TABERNACLING UH
[43:32] UH TAKING CONTROL OF A VESSEL AND IT
[43:34] WOULD BE THE VERY WORD OF GOD TO YOU TO
[43:37] SHOW YOU where we're living, where you
[43:39] COME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT WAS
[43:41] THE VERY MIND OF GOD BEING REVEALED TO
[43:44] US. AND TO THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN A
[43:46] PICTURE OF THAT LOGOS IN THAT PILLAR OF
[43:49] FIRE, I THINK IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL
[43:51] THING TO look at that. and and and AS WE
[43:53] JUST PROGRESS HERE UH IN OUR SLIDE JUST
[43:56] IN EXODUS 14:24 IT WOULD SAY AND IT CAME
[43:59] TO PASS THAT IN THE MORNING NOW WE'RE
[44:01] just looking at a few scriptures here as
[44:04] God would lead the children of Israel
[44:06] [snorts] hey I'm going to take advantage
[44:07] of that handy hook somewhere uh God
[44:09] would lead the children of Israel and
[44:11] and and and the pillar of fire was with
[44:13] them AND WE'RE JUST BACKING UP A little
[44:15] in the STORY IT SAYS IN EXODUS 13:21
[44:18] says and the Lord went before them we
[44:20] read that now we're in Exodus 14 And it
[44:22] came to pass that in the morning watch
[44:25] the Lord looked unto the host of the
[44:27] Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
[44:29] of cloud and troubled the host of the
[44:32] Egyptians. And I was just thinking about
[44:34] that. YOU JUST THINK OF THE very story
[44:36] of the children of Israel. It is amazing
[44:38] to me that they could even begin to
[44:40] murmur and complain.
[44:42] the fact that GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT OF
[44:44] THEIR BONDAGE and being WHIPPED BY BY
[44:46] TASK MASTERS AND BEATEN and their
[44:48] children being taken FROM THEM AND THEIR
[44:50] WIVES AND BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND
[44:53] AND OH NO NO NO TELLING HOW REALLY CRUEL
[44:55] AND HOW BAD IT REALLY WAS AND THEN GOD
[44:58] BROUGHT THEM OUT BY A MIGHTY HAND AND
[44:59] AND HERE YOU ACTUALLY SEE IN THE STORY
[45:02] THAT THAT THEY THEY'VE COME INTO A PLACE
[45:04] AND ACTUALLY THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS
[45:06] STANDING before the children OF ISRAEL
[45:09] AND IT'S STANDING before the enemy and I
[45:12] I love HOW THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ISN'T IT?
[45:14] IT WHAT DID IT SAY? And it troubled the
[45:16] host of the Egyptians.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; It troubled the enemy.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS JUDGMENT
[45:23] TO THE ENEMY. IT WAS TROUBLE TO THE
[45:25] ENEMY. BUT WASN'T WAS IT? IT WAS
[45:27] PROTECTION AND DELIVERANCE TO THE
[45:29] BELIEVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND
[45:31] TO THINK THAT THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE
[45:33] HAS COME BACK IN OUR GENERATION, I WANT
[45:36] TO TELL YOU, IT WILL TROUBLE THE ENEMY.
[45:38] IT WILL BE JUDGMENT TO THE WILD. BUT TO
[45:41] THE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN, OH, I'M SO
[45:43] THANKFUL THAT IT'S DELIVERANCE, IT'S
[45:45] FREEDOM, it's protection.
[45:57] It says here in our love made perfect
[45:59] that we may have boldness in the day of
[46:02] judgment because as he is so are we in
[46:05] this world. I want to say without the
[46:08] pillar of fire without the logos WITHOUT
[46:11] THE HOLY GHOST WITHOUT THE TOKEN YOU ARE
[46:13] IN TROUBLE.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE AS THOSE EGYPTIANS. YOU ARE OF A
[46:18] A WORLD THAT IS DYING AND GROPING in
[46:21] darkness. And without that logos,
[46:23] WITHOUT THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, I TELL YOU,
[46:24] YOU'RE GOING TO BE TROUBLED AND YOU'RE
[46:25] GOING TO BE JUDGED. BUT WHY CAN WE HAVE
[46:28] boldness in the DAY OF JUDGMENT? BECAUSE
[46:31] WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE. WE ARE BEING
[46:34] LED BY A pillar of fire. THE SAME PILLAR
[46:37] OF FIRE THAT was leading THE CHILDREN OF
[46:39] ISRAEL. COME ON, HELP ME OUT NOW. THE
[46:41] SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS LEADING THE
[46:43] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. THE SAME LOGOS THAT
[46:45] WAS THE ANOINTING THAT COME UPON THEM AT
[46:47] THE DAY OF PENTECOST HAS RETURNED BY
[46:49] DIVINE PROMISE IN THE LADYAN AGE. AND I
[46:52] TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S JUDGMENT TO THE
[46:54] WORLD. BUT WHAT IS IT? IT'S DELIVERANCE.
[46:56] It's safety. It's salvation. It's
[46:59] everything that we have need of. Amen.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; So, just moving on, I WANT TO JUST MAYBE
[47:06] LAY SOMETHING IN THERE IN MATTHEW 7
[47:07] and22. It says, "Many will say to ME IN
[47:09] THAT DAY, LORD, LORD, HAVE NOT WE
[47:12] PROPHESIED IN THY NAME? And in thy name
[47:14] HAVE GOT CAST OUT DEVILS AND IN THY NAME
[47:17] DONE many wonderful works? And then I
[47:20] will profess unto them, I never knew
[47:22] you. Depart from me, YE THAT WORK
[47:26] INIQUITY. AIN'T THAT amazing to THINK
[47:28] THAT THERE'S A CLASS OF PEOPLE AND A
[47:30] GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE RELIGIOUS.
[47:32] THEY WILL HAVE SIGNS and they they'll
[47:34] have wonders. THEY'LL FEED THE POOR AND
[47:36] AND THEY'LL have soup kitchens AND SOUP
[47:38] SUPPERS AND ALL THESE THINGS AND THEY'LL
[47:40] THEY'LL BE ABLE TO UH UH TALK ABOUT ALL
[47:42] THESE THESE WONDERFUL WORKS AND ALL
[47:44] THESE THINGS THAT THEY DONE. BUT HERE IN
[47:45] THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "DEPART FROM ME YE
[47:48] WORKERS OF INIQUITY." WHAT IS INIQUITY?
[47:51] IT'S KNOWING WHAT IS RIGHT BUT DENYING
[47:53] TO DO IT. AND I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING
[47:56] THING IN THE DAY AND AGE THAT WE'RE
[47:57] LIVING IN THAT GOD WOULD COME BY DIVINE
[47:59] PROMISE A AND THROUGH A PROPHETIC
[48:01] MINISTRY AND DISCERN THE THOUGHTS AND
[48:03] INTENTS OF THE HEART. BLIND EYES BE
[48:05] OPEN, THE DEAD BE RAISED UP UH UH
[48:07] COUNTLESS UPON. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
[48:10] CALCULATE THE UNFATHOMABLE MIRACLES THAT
[48:13] GOD WROUGHT THROUGH THE PROPHET'S
[48:14] MINISTRY. I I TELL YOU WHAT, I DON'T
[48:16] THINK THE SCROLLS, THE BOOKS COULDN'T
[48:18] CONTAIN IT. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE HALF.
[48:20] WE DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF THE PROPHET'S
[48:22] LIFE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS OF THE PEOPLE
[48:25] THAT HE interacted with AND THE PEOPLE
[48:27] THAT WERE HEALED AND AND THE THOUGHTS
[48:28] AND INTENTS OF THE HEARTS THAT WERE
[48:30] DISCERNED. AND IT WAS ON DISPLAY AROUND
[48:32] THE WORLD SEVEN TIMES. AND TO THINK THAT
[48:34] THAT VERY WORD COULD BE MADE FLESH
[48:36] BEFORE A PEOPLE THAT WERE BELIEVING FOR
[48:39] THE Messiah
[48:43] &gt;&gt; and they WOULD REJECT IT.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; THE PRESENCE OF GOD UNRECOGNIZED.
[48:49] BUT yet he could show THEM IN THE
[48:50] SCRIPTURES SAYS IT'S NOT LAWFUL.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO DO THIS AND
[48:55] SHOW THE HOW WE SHOULD DRESS AND HOW WE
[48:57] SHOULD CONDUCT OURSELVES. BUT WHAT WOULD
[48:58] THEY DO? THEY WOULD REJECT THE word
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and the word is Christ.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And therefore you have a scripture like
[49:07] THIS THAT SAYS, "DEPART FROM ME YE THAT
[49:09] WORK iniquity for I never knew you." WE
[49:12] KNOW THAT JESUS TAUGHT US IT JUST BEFORE
[49:14] THAT. HE SAYS, "IT'S BY THEIR FRUITS YOU
[49:17] SHALL know them." I like that. HE SAID
[49:18] FRUITS. PRAISE GOD. HE DIDN'T SAY WORKS
[49:20] CUZ I'D BE ONE CONFUSED PUPPY. IF HE
[49:22] SAID BY YOUR WORKS YOU WILL KNOW THEM.
[49:25] WELL THEN I BETTER START PLAYING CATCHUP
[49:27] BECAUSE THE PENTECOSTALS WILL OUTSHINE
[49:29] YOU. I TELL YOU THERE'S BAPTISTS THAT'LL
[49:30] OUTSHINE YOU. YOUR NEIGHBOR WILL
[49:32] OUTSHINE YOU. BUT I'M SO THANKFUL IT'S
[49:34] NOT BASED ON MY WORDS. BUT HE SAID YOU
[49:37] SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUIT. WHAT?
[49:38] THE FRUIT OF THE WORD. The fruit of the
[49:41] LIFE OF CHRIST ON DISPLAY in an
[49:44] individual's life.
[49:46] Amen. IT'S
[49:48] &gt;&gt; NOT OF WORKS LEST WE SHOULD BOAST. AMEN.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; SO, just laying that in for a
[49:55] foundation. And and then uh uh we we we
[49:57] JUST BEEN GETTING A LOT OF INSPIRATION
[49:59] AS WE CAME OUT OF QUESTION AND answers
[50:01] been BEEN LISTENING TO GOD IDENTIFYING
[50:03] HIMSELF BY HIS CHARACTERISTICS. AND
[50:05] BROTHER BENAM in this message, HE WOULD
[50:07] START TO SHOW HOW YOU KNOW CERTAIN
[50:08] ANIMALS THEY HAVE certain
[50:10] characteristics. you you might IF YOU'RE
[50:12] GOING OUT HUNTING AND HE WOULD USE
[50:13] HUNTING AND SHOW THAT HOW THERE'S
[50:15] CERTAIN rams and and certain uh uh ones
[50:17] that maybe there's certain
[50:19] distinguishing marks and features that
[50:21] THAT YOU CAN TELL them one from another
[50:23] just like you would UH MAYBE BIRDS IF IF
[50:26] you're looking out and I mean I don't
[50:27] know but it's pretty simple usually to
[50:30] that's a cardinal. Why is that a
[50:32] cardinal? Because the CHARACTERISTIC OF
[50:33] A CARDINAL it's red and and that's a
[50:35] blue jay. THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE THEY CAN
[50:37] JUST HEAR THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY'LL
[50:38] KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. LIKE, OH,
[50:40] THAT'S THAT BIRD. AND WHY? IT'S THE
[50:42] CHARACTERISTIC. IT'S SOMETHING THAT
[50:44] identifies the nature or the character
[50:46] of what that is.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Now, in this message, I I think there's
[50:51] just A WE WON'T HAVE TIME MAYBE JUST TO
[50:53] mention it, but brother Brandham, IN
[50:55] THIS MESSAGE, HE TALKS ABOUT HOW UH
[50:57] THINGS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS, AND HE'S
[50:58] TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
[51:00] AND AND THERE'S A PLACE WHERE THE
[51:01] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL NOW they're they're
[51:02] coming through the wilderness and they
[51:04] come to the land of Moab. And it's AN
[51:06] AMAZING THING THAT THEY COME TO THE LAND
[51:08] OF of Moab. And here's a here's a THE
[51:11] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, GOD'S ELECTED
[51:13] CHOSEN, AND HE'S COMING TO TO TO the
[51:15] Moabites. And here are these Moabites.
[51:18] THEY'RE JUST AS FUNDAMENTAL AS ISRAEL
[51:19] IS. They they have their prophets. They
[51:22] have their altars. Uh they they have
[51:24] their religion. They have their big
[51:25] churches. They go to CHURCH ON SUNDAY.
[51:28] EVERYTHING that they have I it if you
[51:30] were TO LOOK AT IT FUNDAMENTALLY THEY
[51:32] WERE JUST AS CHRISTIAN SO TO SPEAK AS
[51:34] ISRAEL was
[51:37] &gt;&gt; right they come to him and and I think
[51:38] it's AN AMAZING THING WHEN YOU LOOK INTO
[51:41] the scripture AND THEN UH THEY'RE
[51:42] WANTING TO PASS THROUGH BUT WHAT DO THEY
[51:44] WANT THEY DON'T WANT TO LET THEM PASS
[51:46] THROUGH AND THEY'RE TELLING WHAT DOES
[51:47] BALAM WANT TO DO HE WANTS TO CURSE THE
[51:49] HE WANTS TO CURSE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
[51:51] AND HE KEEPS SEEKING AFTER GOD HE WANTS
[51:52] TO CURSE THEM AND AND WE'RE TAUGHT THAT
[51:55] THAT THAT THEY HAD THEIR PROPHET THEY
[51:57] HAD HAD THEIR ALTARS, THEY HAD THEIR
[51:58] CHURCH, THEY HAD EVERYTHING. BUT THE ONE
[52:00] THING that they lacked, THEY LACKED THE
[52:03] PILLAR of fire AND A VINDICATED PROPHET
[52:06] OF THE AGE AMONG THEM. SO IT DIDN'T
[52:09] MATTER HOW FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND IT WAS.
[52:11] IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT THEY COULD SAY THE
[52:12] LORD'S PRAYER. DIDN'T MATTER IF THEY
[52:14] WENT TO CHURCH AND HOW MANY ALTARS THAT
[52:16] THEY LAID AND HOW MANY SACRIFICE. THE
[52:18] ONE THING THAT THEY LACKED WAS
[52:19] RECOGNIZING THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND
[52:22] THE VINDICATED PROPHET WAS AMONGST THEM.
[52:25] All right.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; This thing's going to pop off my head
[52:27] eventually.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; So, just laying laying that IN THERE TO
[52:34] THINK WHAT WAS IT THAT THEY LACKED.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; They could HAVE POINT TO THE THE HINDER
[52:39] PART. THEY COULD HAVE POINTED TO THE
[52:41] MISTAKES AND OH, LOOK AT THE CHILDREN.
[52:43] They did THIS AND THEY DID THAT. BUT ONE
[52:44] THING THEY DIDN'T have is they didn't
[52:46] have that pillar of fire. THEY DIDN'T
[52:48] HAVE THE LOGOS WHICH WAS WHAT THE
[52:51] ATTRIBUTE of the fullness OF THE WORD TO
[52:54] THINK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD THE
[52:56] attribute
[52:58] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the WORD WAS PRESENT
[53:00] WITH THEM.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BENAMAN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF BY
[53:04] HIS CHARACTERISTICS would say in chapter
[53:06] and in in uh uh paragraph 51. But you
[53:09] see Moses BEING THE CORRECT PROPHET OF
[53:11] GOD NOT ONLY HAD THE fundamental part
[53:14] but he had the identification of God.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; See he was in the line of duty. Exactly
[53:21] what was promised for that age.
[53:25] Not for the age of Noah but for the age
[53:28] then. I will take you to a land that's
[53:30] flowing with milk and honey. They were
[53:32] on their way. AND ISRAEL WAS IDENTIFIED
[53:35] WITH their prophet Moses with the
[53:39] message of that age.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I KNOW I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND
[53:43] I'LL GO SAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE UH MY GOOD
[53:45] FRIEND, BROTHER JOSH BENNETT, ONE TIME
[53:46] HE WAS IN A DISCUSSION WITH THIS
[53:48] INDIVIDUAL AND HE TOLD HIM, HE SAID,
[53:49] "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DO WE ALWAYS
[53:51] HAVE TO SAY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID?" AND
[53:52] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHY WHY CAN'T WE
[53:54] JUST LEAVE HIM OUT OF IT? YOU KNOW, WE
[53:56] WE you know, WE WE BELIEVE THE GOSPEL.
[53:58] WE BELIEVE IN CALVARY AND AND WE'RE ALL
[54:01] CHRISTIANS. WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GOT TO
[54:03] POINT? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GOT TO SAY
[54:04] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID? AND AND YOU KNOW
[54:06] MY BROTHER BROTHER HE SAID HE JUST GOT
[54:08] TO THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND AND
[54:10] THOUGHT HE GOES YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL TELL
[54:11] YOU WHAT IF YOU CAN TELL THE STORY OF
[54:15] THE ARK AND not mention Noah. IF YOU CAN
[54:18] TELL THE STORY ABOUT ISRAEL GOING IN AN
[54:20] EXODUS AND NOT MENTION MOSES. IF YOU CAN
[54:22] TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE COMING OF OUR
[54:24] LORD JESUS CHRIST AND LEAVE OUT JOHN THE
[54:26] BAPTIST. WELL THEN MAYBE I CAN'T SAY
[54:28] BROTHER B. BUT IF YOU GOT TO SAY NO TO
[54:31] TELL THAT STORY, IF YOU GOT TO SAY MOSES
[54:34] TO TELL THAT STORY, IF YOU GOT TO SAY
[54:36] JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT INTRODUCED THE
[54:38] MESSIAH, THEN WHAT ABOUT IN OUR DAY? WE
[54:40] GOT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE MESSENGER
[54:42] OF THE AGE. And I'm NOT ASHAMED TO SAY
[54:45] THAT GOD HAS SENT US A MESSAGE THROUGH A
[54:48] VINDICATED PROPHET AND HIS NAME IS
[54:50] WILLIAM MARY AND BRANDON.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That's true. That might sting,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; but I'm going in an Exodus.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE SOME FRIENDS,
[55:03] BUT I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; HEY, I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; WELL, there's a reason I don't wear this
[55:12] thing.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll grab a handheld.
[55:18] [crying]
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I like that what he's saying right
[55:20] there. They were on their way and Israel
[55:24] WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THEIR PROPHET Moses
[55:30] &gt;&gt; with
[55:32] the message of the age. God's
[55:34] characteristics identified in Moses.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE WAS FOLLOWING THEM. HE
[55:41] ALSO HAD THE ATONEMENT IN ACTION. NOT
[55:44] SPEAKING OF IT, BUT HAD it in action.
[55:47] Not what will be, what is right now.
[55:51] WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAD THE pillar of
[55:54] fire. They had the identification,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; the attributes, the characteristics
[56:01] of the word of the age that they were
[56:03] LIVING IN. COME ON. THEY HAD
[56:04] DELIVERANCE.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; They had mana from heaven.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; They had A BRAZEN SERPENT.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD A SMITTEN ROCK. THEY HAD LIVING
[56:13] WATERS. BECAUSE WHY? THE ATTRIBUTE OF
[56:16] THE FULLNESS OF GOD WAS PRESENT WITH
[56:19] THEM.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT US CHILDREN OF GOD? WE HAVE
[56:23] BY REVELATION REALIZED THAT GOD HAS
[56:26] RETURNED THE FULLNESS OF THE ATTRIBUTE
[56:30] OF THE LOGOS BY DIVINE PROMISE HAS COME
[56:33] BACK IN THIS AGE AND HE HAS MADE YOU A
[56:36] PARTAKER.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; OH, praise his wonderful name.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm done wrestling with that
[56:43] thing.
[56:46] Can you hear me now?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I feel back at home. Y'all better
[56:49] watch out.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Just trying to move on right
[56:54] here. Uh, see where we're at. [crying]
[56:57] &gt;&gt; But it was that pillar of fire. What was
[57:00] IT DOING? IT WAS SHOWING THAT GOD WAS IN
[57:02] THE CAMP.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; God was present with his people. But
[57:07] those THAT WERE COMING IN CONTACT, WHAT
[57:09] DID THEY FAILED TO SEE THE pillar of
[57:11] fire? THEY FAILED TO SEE THE SMITTEN
[57:13] ROCK. THEY FAILED TO SEE THE FULLNESS OF
[57:15] GOD. THEY FAILED TO SEE THE LOGOS. AND
[57:18] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD GO ON TO SAY THIS.
[57:19] HE WOULD SAY, "THEN THEY WERE TRAVELING
[57:21] IN THE LINE OF PROMISE." THAT'S WHAT WE
[57:23] NEED TO be doing, church. WE NEED TO BE
[57:25] TRAVELING IN THE LINE OF PROMISE. WE ARE
[57:27] GOING IN AN EXODUS. WE ARE GOING IN A
[57:29] RAPTURE. AND THAT WAS THE OTHER
[57:31] IDENTIFICATION TO SHOWING GOD'S
[57:33] CHARACTERISTICS. NO MATTER HOW
[57:34] FUNDAMENTAL THIS OTHER ONE WAS WITH THE
[57:37] WORD, HE HAD THE FUNDAMENTALISM PLUS THE
[57:41] identification and THE CHARACTERISTICS
[57:43] OF GOD AMONG THEM. GOD IDENTIFIED
[57:46] himself two prophets, both of them
[57:48] prophets AND BOTH OF THEM FUNDAMENTAL.
[57:49] BUT GOD IDENTIFIED HIS CHARACTERISTICS
[57:52] IN MOSES BECAUSE HE HAD THE
[57:54] CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD WITH HIM.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam goes ON TO SAY, GOD'S
[57:59] CHARACTERISTICS are supernatural because
[58:01] God is supernatural. Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Look, I I there's there's people all
[58:06] over the world. They they GO TO CHURCH
[58:08] ON SUNDAY AND THEY SAY THEY'RE
[58:10] CHRISTIANS, but they don't live any
[58:11] different.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; They drink, they smoke, BUT YOU SEE THEY
[58:16] THERE there's no atonement IN ACTION.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FUNDAMENTAL. GO. I BELIEVE IN
[58:22] JESUS CHRIST. HE'S THE SAVIOR OF THE
[58:24] WORLD. I GO TO CHURCH. I PAY MY TITHE. I
[58:26] I TAKE COMMUNION. I'M A CHRISTIAN. I
[58:29] TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I I I HAVE A GOOD
[58:31] LIFE. BUT YOU SEE, GOD IS A GOD OF THE
[58:34] SUPERNATURAL. WHERE IS THE TESTIMONY?
[58:36] WHERE IS THE DELIVERANCE? WHERE IS THE
[58:38] HEALING? WHERE IS THE TESTIMONY? WHERE
[58:40] IS THE CHANGE IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE?
[58:42] WHERE THEY CAN POINT TO THE SCRIPTURE
[58:44] AND SAY, "I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M
[58:46] FOUND. I ONCE WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I'M
[58:49] SEE. I AM A NEW CREATURE IN JESUS
[58:51] CHRIST. OLD THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY, AND
[58:54] ALL [screaming]
[58:55] THINGS HAVE BECOME NEW."
[58:59] Brother Rand said it's always it's
[59:01] unusual always to the modern trend of
[59:03] thinking of the day. These great MEGA
[59:05] CHURCHES AND AND ALL OF THESE BIG GROUPS
[59:07] OUT THERE AND AND AND NO DOUBT, YOU
[59:10] KNOW, I LIKE TO I LIKE TO SAY IT TO UH
[59:12] BROTHER JASON WATKINS WOULD SAY IT LIKE
[59:14] THIS. HE SAYS THEY'LL GET A FAIR TRIAL.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; They will.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY WILL GET A FAIR TRIAL. BUT
[59:20] THIS IS ONE GUY THAT CANNOT COUNT ON A
[59:23] TRIAL. THANK YOU, LORD.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; I WILL [screaming] NOT MAKE IT THROUGH
[59:26] WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. I'M SORRY. I
[59:28] CAN'T BE GOOD TO ENOUGH PEOPLE.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; There's only one way that I know THAT I
[59:34] CAN BE SAVED. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE
[59:36] SAY, "WELL, I'm saved." Saved from what?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; What are YOU SAVED FROM? WELL, I'M SAVED
[59:42] FROM MY SINS. IF YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH
[59:44] WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT, YOU ARE NOT SAVED
[59:46] FROM YOUR SINS.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:49] BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY AN unrighteous
[59:51] man COULD STAND IN THE PRESENCE OF God
[59:54] and be ABLE TO POINT TO ANY OF YOUR GOOD
[59:57] WORKS AS A MERIT FOR SALVATION. NO, IT'S
[1:00:01] EXACTLY WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAID. THERE'S
[1:00:03] ONLY ONE WAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE MAKE
[1:00:05] IT. AND HE SAID, "BY FAITH." ARE YOU
[1:00:07] SAVED BY GRACE? ARE YOU SAVED THROUGH
[1:00:09] faith
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; and not of yourself? IT IS A GIFT FROM
[1:00:13] GOD. THE ONLY WAY THAT MATTHEW MCGARY IS
[1:00:17] GOING TO MAKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS A GIFT
[1:00:19] FROM ALMIGHTY GOD. BUT THERE'S ONE THING
[1:00:22] ABOUT A GIFT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO
[1:00:24] DO? YOU GOT TO ACCEPT IT. YOU GOT TO
[1:00:27] TAKE IT. YOU GOT TO RECEIVE IT. YOU GOT
[1:00:29] TO OPEN UP. AND SURE, HE SAID, "FOR GOD
[1:00:32] SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY
[1:00:34] BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN
[1:00:36] HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE
[1:00:37] EVERLASTING LIFE. BUT MANY WILL SAY ON
[1:00:40] THAT DAY,
[1:00:44] OH, I was a Christian. I did this.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.
[1:00:50] I never knew you.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; See, YOU CAN DRAW IT DOWN where we want
[1:00:56] to look at where we're being IN THE LINE
[1:00:57] OF DUTY. And the only way we're going to
[1:00:59] be able to navigate AND GET OUR WAY OUT
[1:01:01] OF HERE IS IF WE HAVE A GUIDE.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And God sent A GUIDE BY DIVINE PROMISE.
[1:01:07] THERE WAS NO WAY THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
[1:01:09] WERE GETTING OUT OF EGYPT WITHOUT A
[1:01:12] GUIDE.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GETTING OUT OF LADY
[1:01:15] OSIA WITHOUT A GUIDE. AND JUST AS GOD
[1:01:18] SENT NOAH, JUST AS GOD SENT MOSES, GOD
[1:01:21] HAS SENT A PROPHET TO LEAD HIS CHILDREN
[1:01:24] IN AN EXODUS TO A BODY CHANGE.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; So you just you SEE THIS PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:01:32] THAT WAS WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
[1:01:35] AND THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE NOW THE
[1:01:37] LOGOS WAS MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US.
[1:01:39] WE KNOW THE SCRIPTURE IN IN JOHN 1:1 IT
[1:01:42] SAYS IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD AND
[1:01:43] THE WORD WAS WITH GOD and the word was
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; God. And and notice uh if if you didn't
[1:01:50] notice, BROTHER BRANDON WILL ALWAYS TIE
[1:01:52] JOHN 1:1 WITH JOHN 1:14. That's good.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He he reads it consecutively AND HE GOES
[1:01:59] RIGHT INTO AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH
[1:02:02] AND DWELT among us.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; SO NOW WHERE IS THIS PILLAR OF FIRE?
[1:02:08] WHERE IS THIS LOGOS?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; THIS THIS THIS CLOUD THIS THIS PILLAR OF
[1:02:14] FIRE THIS ONE THAT LED HIM IN the in the
[1:02:17] wilderness.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Now where is it? What was it? That logos
[1:02:22] was the attribute of the fullness of
[1:02:26] God. And now it's in one man, Christ
[1:02:29] Jesus.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Man was made
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; in the image of God.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And God was made in the image of man.
[1:02:44] As Paul would say in Colossians 1:15,
[1:02:46] who is the image of the invisible God?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Now, just jumping to back to questions
[1:02:53] and answers here.
[1:02:56] Speaking of that, Brother Brandham says,
[1:02:57] "Heavens and earth hugged and kissed
[1:03:00] each other.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; God and man embraced each other as
[1:03:05] fatherhood and sunship
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; when the logos became flesh and dwelt
[1:03:09] among us."
[1:03:11] Jesus said, "I am come from God and I go
[1:03:13] to God." Is that right? After his death,
[1:03:15] burial, resurrection, and ascension,
[1:03:17] WHEN THE BODY WAS TAKEN UP TO SIT at the
[1:03:19] right hand of God, NOW I DON'T MEAN
[1:03:21] GOD'S GOT A RIGHT HAND. God's a spirit.
[1:03:24] But at the right hand means in power and
[1:03:27] authority of God. That in that name,
[1:03:30] everything in heaven is named after it
[1:03:33] and subject to it. Everything in earth
[1:03:36] is named after it and subject to it a
[1:03:39] name above all names
[1:03:41] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says in
[1:03:46] everything you do in word or deed do all
[1:03:50] in the name of
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; That includes water baptism. Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I created a firestorm over in India
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; when I had that meeting with some 200
[1:04:05] ministers and they had their testimony
[1:04:07] AND I JUST FLAT OUT TOOK MY BIBLE OUT
[1:04:09] AND I SAID, "IF THAT IS YOUR TESTIMONY,
[1:04:10] IT'S CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD."
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; But you know, I say it's TIME WE GET
[1:04:15] SOME BOLDNESS IN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT
[1:04:17] BECAUSE THEY ALL LINED UP FOR WATER
[1:04:19] BAPTISM. I SAY THERE GOTS TO BE A PEOPLE
[1:04:21] WHO AIN'T AFRAID TO SAY WHAT THE BIBLE
[1:04:23] SAYS, REGARDLESS OF THE RELIGIONS,
[1:04:26] REGARDLESS OF THE DENOMINATIONS,
[1:04:27] REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY'VE STUDIED
[1:04:29] IN THEIR DLD, PCP AND ALL THAT KIND OF
[1:04:32] STUFF THAT THEY'RE ON. I DON'T KNOW
[1:04:34] ABOUT IT, BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT I
[1:04:36] CAN SAY I'VE PROVED. I'M ABOUT TO GET ON
[1:04:37] A TANGENT. JUST LIKE DAVID, HE HE
[1:04:39] COULDN'T SAUL'S ARMOR WASN'T GOING TO
[1:04:41] WORK, BUT ONE THING HE KNEW THAT HE WAS
[1:04:43] ANOINTED.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:48] That stuff's not proven.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; But I say what we got to do is we got to
[1:04:54] stay with the original artillery.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelu. I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD. WE GOT
[1:04:59] TO STAY WITH THE ORIGINAL ARTILLERY.
[1:05:01] WHAT DID BROTHER BRAD SAY? HE SAID,
[1:05:03] "LET'S DO THE JOB RIGHT."
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; WHY GET OUT A 22, RIGHT? LET'S GET OUT
[1:05:07] FAITH, THE REAL THE REAL BOMB, THE REAL
[1:05:10] ARTILLERY. FAITH IN GOD'S WORD.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; So just uh UH PROGRESSING IN THIS
[1:05:15] THOUGHT HERE IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
[1:05:18] AND AND JUST SHOWING THIS HE says find
[1:05:20] my place quickly.
[1:05:25] He says NOW THIS LOGOS WAS IN HIM WHICH
[1:05:28] WAS THE SPIRIT of God. The anointing
[1:05:30] through the sanctifying grace OF THE
[1:05:32] BLOOD BROUGHT MANY SONS TO GOD WHICH
[1:05:34] anointed which is anointed with this
[1:05:37] same
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; logos.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; But see, we're talking about
[1:05:49] identification.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the characteristics
[1:05:52] of a believer. It's one thing to say it.
[1:05:56] It's another thing to demonstrate it.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Are we we doing okay?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, just looking at
[1:06:06] this, LOOK AT WHAT PAUL SAYS HERE IN
[1:06:09] Hebrews chapter 2
[1:06:13] and verse 9. And he says, "But we see
[1:06:15] Jesus, who was made a little lower than
[1:06:17] the angels, for the suffering of death,
[1:06:19] CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR, THAT HE BY
[1:06:21] THE GRACE OF GOD should taste death for
[1:06:23] every man. For it became him, for whom
[1:06:26] are all things, and by him who are all
[1:06:28] things, in bringing many sons under
[1:06:30] glory to make the captain of their
[1:06:33] salvation perfect through suffering."
[1:06:35] I'm so thankful that he is the captain
[1:06:37] of my salvation.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he's the captain OF
[1:06:42] MY SHIP. I'M SO THANKFUL he's the
[1:06:44] captain OF MY PREDESTINATION. SEE, THE
[1:06:47] PROBLEM IS A LOT OF US WANT TO BE THE
[1:06:48] CAPTAIN OR WE WANT TO BE CO- CAPTAIN.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; GOD GOD BRINGS YOU THIS FLIGHT. YOU SAY,
[1:06:53] "OKAY, I GOT IT PRETTY GOOD, LORD. I
[1:06:54] THINK I CAN TAKE OVER. LET ME JUST TAKE
[1:06:56] OVER THE HELM NOW."
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; SO MANY TIMES WE DO THAT, BUT HE IS THE
[1:07:02] CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. WE'LL JUST TRY
[1:07:04] TO TO PLUM THE LINE HERE. IN HEBREWS
[1:07:06] 10:5, HE SAYS, "WHEREFORE, WHEN HE
[1:07:08] COMETH INTO THE WORLD, HE SAID,
[1:07:10] "SACRIFICE AND OFFERINGS THOU WOULDEST
[1:07:12] NOT, BUT A BODY HAST THOU PREPARED ME."
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; What was it? HE HE WASN'T WANTING TO
[1:07:18] DWELL IN IN TENTS MADE WITH HANDS. HE
[1:07:20] WASN'T WANTING TO BE THE THE THE LOGOS
[1:07:22] IN THE PILLAR OF FIREH BY NIGHT AND THE
[1:07:25] CLOUD BY DAY AND THEN COME IN AND AND
[1:07:27] LIVE IN THIS THIS MAKESHIFT TENT THAT
[1:07:29] WENT ALL OVER THE WILDERNESS. EVEN WHEN
[1:07:31] WHEN THE TEMPLE WAS BUILT, IT WASN'T
[1:07:33] THAT GOD WAS WANTING TO DWELL THERE, BUT
[1:07:35] GOD'S WANTING TO DWELL IN YOUR HEART.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in
[1:07:44] perseverance. HE SAYS, "NOW GOD PREPARED
[1:07:46] HIMSELF A BODY IN THE FORM OF THE LORD
[1:07:48] JESUS, WHICH was the Christ, meaning the
[1:07:51] anointed one. And now all that GOD WAS
[1:07:53] WAS IN CHRIST. HE WAS THE FULLNESS of
[1:07:55] the Godhead bodily." That's what the
[1:07:57] scripture says. Now, AND ALL THAT GOD
[1:08:00] WAS, HE POURED OUT INTO CHRIST. He was
[1:08:02] Emmanuel, God with us. And all
[1:08:06] and ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, HE POURED OUT
[1:08:08] INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Anointed one to continue his work that
[1:08:17] his word might live constantly.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; He lived by the word of the father. Man
[1:08:23] shall not live BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY
[1:08:25] EVERY WORD THAT proceedth from THE MOUTH
[1:08:27] OF GOD. AND THE CHURCH DON'T LIVE BY
[1:08:30] BREAD ALONE, BUT BY THE WORD of Christ.
[1:08:32] And the Holy Spirit comes in and takes
[1:08:36] the word of Christ and makes it a living
[1:08:40] action today. Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I JUST IF I COULD SAY WHAT'S ON MY
[1:08:45] HEART, THE HOLY GHOST, THE ANOINTING,
[1:08:48] THAT LOGOS THAT WAS DIVIDED UPON THE
[1:08:51] CHILDREN UPON THE DISCIPLES THAT WERE
[1:08:54] GATHERED THERE IN THE UPPER ROOM. WHAT
[1:08:57] DOES IT DO? IT TAKES THE WORD OF GOD. IT
[1:08:59] TAKES THE BIBLE. IT TAKES ALL OF THESE
[1:09:02] THINGS THAT WE HEAR AND IT makes the
[1:09:04] word a living action. LOOK, DON'T COME
[1:09:07] AND TELL ME THAT YOU GOT THE SOLUTION TO
[1:09:10] ALL MY PROBLEMS AND SIT WITH ALL THE
[1:09:12] SAME PROBLEMS THAT I GOT.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; You You're COMING OVER JUST AS SICK AS I
[1:09:18] AM AND SAY, "I GOT JESUS. LOOK, I NEED
[1:09:21] SOMETHING REAL. I NEED A REAL GOD." IT
[1:09:24] REMINDS ME OF THAT STORY HOW THAT THAT
[1:09:26] LITTLE BOY, HE WAS UPSTAIRS AND AND YOU
[1:09:28] KNOW, THE THE LIGHTNING WAS FLASHING AND
[1:09:30] IT WAS ALL CRASHING AROUND. HE STARTED
[1:09:32] CRYING, "MAMA, MAMA, MAMA, UH, COME
[1:09:34] HERE." AND SHE COME UP THE STAIRS AND
[1:09:36] BEING THE GOOD MOTHER THAT SHE WAS AND
[1:09:38] SHE COME IN HER ROOM. SHE SAYS, "WHAT IS
[1:09:39] IT, LITTLE SUNNY? WHAT WHAT DO YOU
[1:09:40] NEED?" HE SAYS, "I'M SCARED." HE SHE
[1:09:42] SAID, "NOW DON'T WORRY." SAID, "YOU KNOW
[1:09:45] JESUS LOVES YOU." YEAH. SHE SAID,
[1:09:46] "MOMMY, DON'T DON'T LEAVE ME, MOMMY."
[1:09:48] SHE GOES, "YOU KNOW JESUS IS WITH YOU."
[1:09:50] HE SAID, "I'LL BE WITH YOU. I'LL NEVER
[1:09:51] LEAVE YOU." HE SAID, "YES, MOMMY, THAT'S
[1:09:53] GOOD." HE SAID, "BUT I WANT A GOD WITH
[1:09:54] SKIN ON IT."
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; LOOK, it's one thing to do A LOT OF
[1:09:59] TALKING, BUT I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'S
[1:10:01] REAL. I WANT TO SEE THAT GOD THAT
[1:10:02] CHANGES LIVES. I WANT TO SEE A GOD
[1:10:04] THAT'LL DELIVER THE ALCOHOLIC. I WANT TO
[1:10:06] SEE A GOD THAT'LL DELIVER THE DRUG
[1:10:08] ADDICT. I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'LL PULL
[1:10:10] SOMEBODY OUT OF THE DENOMINATIONAL
[1:10:11] REALMS OF DEATH AND RESTORE THEIR SOUL
[1:10:14] AND SET THEM FREE AND REVEAL THE LIVING
[1:10:17] WORD OF THE HOUR TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND
[1:10:19] THEN THAT WORD TAKE ON FLESH.
[1:10:21] [screaming]
[1:10:22] I HAVE NOT LOST MY MIND. I KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:10:24] TALKING ABOUT. AMEN.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; A living action.
[1:10:32] CHRIST THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WORD
[1:10:35] NOW LIVING IN A people in his bride. NOT
[1:10:40] JUST ON SUNDAY,
[1:10:42] not just on Wednesday,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Monday,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Tuesday, at your job, at your school,
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; NOT
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR HOME, IN YOUR CAR. AMEN.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; DISPLAYING THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT,
[1:10:57] HAVING THAT LOVE, THAT HUMILITY, THAT
[1:10:59] MEEKNESS, THAT PATIENCE, THAT
[1:11:02] LONGSUFFERING, GENTLENESS.
[1:11:06] I guess we don't like that. Okay, we're
[1:11:07] all
[1:11:09] brother Matthew, don't get on the fruits
[1:11:11] of the spirit.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; What are we doing?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; WE JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE CAN
[1:11:16] KNOW AND GO AROUND AROUND THE CITY AND
[1:11:18] TOOT OUR HORN AND SAY, "WE'RE we're
[1:11:19] going in the rapture and everybody else
[1:11:20] is going to hell. H, GOOD LUCK."
[1:11:23] THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME to do.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; This message came in meekness and
[1:11:28] humility AND BROKENNESS AND sacrifice
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; a LIFE POURED OUT [screaming]
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU AND I COULD BE A beneficiary
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; of the benefits. Yes, sir.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So, WE SEE THAT JUST AS CHRIST, HE WAS
[1:11:47] THE ANOINTED ONE,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; we are the anointed ones.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Help me out.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; You ever Is that Have y'all not heard
[1:11:57] that before?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; We are the anointed ones. HE WAS THE
[1:12:02] ANOINTED ONE.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; He was the Messiah. We are
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; What is it? IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING
[1:12:09] IN INTO YOUR LIFE, taking that word now
[1:12:12] and make it a living action.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Now, we'll just see
[1:12:18] how we can move towards a close. But as
[1:12:21] we talk ABOUT A LIVING ACTION, THAT'S
[1:12:23] EXACTLY WHAT THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You look into THE BOOK OF ACTS and
[1:12:29] that's WHERE WE GOT OUR TEXT in Acts 24.
[1:12:32] It said they WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:12:34] GHOST. And our PROPHET SHOWS US HOW THIS
[1:12:36] IS OFTEN CALLED UH THE THE THE THE BOOK
[1:12:39] OF ACTS of the apostles, BUT IT WAS NOT
[1:12:43] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:12:49] apostles.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Just as we READ THE OPENING QUOTE, HE
[1:12:51] SAID, "GOD WAS BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN
[1:12:55] ONE MAN, JESUS CHRIST, BUT NOW HE'S
[1:12:58] BOTTLED and confined IN THE WHOLE
[1:13:00] UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD."
[1:13:02] ISN'T THAT A STRANGE WORD THAT THE
[1:13:04] PROPHET WOULD USE THE WORD CONFINED?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; God confined.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S CONFINED TO HIS BODY.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHAT MAN IS
[1:13:19] GOD'S AGENT?"
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm glad you asked. Let's look AT
[1:13:25] SOME SCRIPTURES. LOOKING INTO Acts 8,
[1:13:29] Philillip, he's coming BY THE WAY. HE'S
[1:13:32] CAUGHT UP AND HE COMES OVER AND HE SEES
[1:13:34] A UNIC THAT'S READING THE SCRIPTURE OUT
[1:13:36] OF ISAIAH. RIGHT.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And he says to him, the spirit OF GOD
[1:13:41] LEADING PHILADELPHIA AND HE SAYS, "DO
[1:13:43] YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE READING?" And
[1:13:45] he SAID, "HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
[1:13:48] READING LEST SOME MAN SHOW ME?"
[1:13:52] SOMETHING IN THE UNIC'S HEART WAS
[1:13:54] DESIRING UNDERSTANDING
[1:13:56] FROM THE WORD. BUT BECAUSE GOD HAD
[1:13:59] SEPARATED HIMSELF INTO MAN, WHAT DID HE
[1:14:02] DO? HE SENT A MAN.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Here the UNIT IS DESIRING,
[1:14:08] UNDERSTANDING, AND GOD NOW TAKES HIS
[1:14:11] BODY, HIS AGENT, AND he sends him to the
[1:14:15] unit.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL? HERE'S THAT
[1:14:24] LOGOS. WHAT DOES IT DO? It strikes. This
[1:14:26] is amazing.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; What is the logos? It's the attribute of
[1:14:31] what?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; The fullness of God.
[1:14:36] So there in that picture,
[1:14:39] AS HARD as it is to understand,
[1:14:42] the fullness of God is before Paul.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:48] And what does THE FULLNESS OF GOD TELL
[1:14:49] PAUL? HEY, there's I'm I'm going to show
[1:14:54] you a brother BY THE NAME OF ANAS.
[1:14:58] ANANAS.
[1:15:01] I'M I'M ALSO DEALING WITH HIM. I'M GOING
[1:15:03] TO SEND YOU DOWN THERE AND HE WILL PRAY
[1:15:05] FOR YOU.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I thought you were the actery. I thought
[1:15:11] you were THE FULLNESS OF GOD. I I I
[1:15:13] THOUGHT I THOUGHT THE ATONEMENT AND
[1:15:16] EVERYTHING W WAS RIGHT THERE. YES. BUT
[1:15:18] GOD IS CONFINED TO HIS BODY.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; God is using man.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Now he's ONLY CONFINED TO HIS BODY
[1:15:28] BECAUSE HE wants to be he wants to use
[1:15:31] you. He wants to use each and every
[1:15:35] single one of you. YOU ARE THE VERY
[1:15:37] THOUGHT OF GOD THAT WAS EXPRESSED. AND
[1:15:40] WHAT ARE WE DOING? WERE PLAYING OUT OUR
[1:15:42] part
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; and God wants to use YOUR LIFE. OH,
[1:15:45] BROTHER MATTHEW, YOU DON'T KNOW. I
[1:15:47] RUINED MY LIFE. I DID SO MANY BAD
[1:15:49] THINGS. YOU'RE JUST THE RIGHT ONE THAT
[1:15:50] HE'S LOOKING FOR. GO AHEAD AND LOOK ON
[1:15:52] DOWN THROUGH THE BIBLE. IT'S FULL OF
[1:15:54] PEOPLE THAT HAD NO HOPE. IT'S FULL OF
[1:15:57] PEOPLE WHERE THERE WAS NO WAY. AND GOD
[1:15:59] LOOKS AT THE IMPOSSIBILITY, SAYS,
[1:16:00] "THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF SON AND
[1:16:03] DAUGHTER THAT I'M [screaming] LOOKING
[1:16:04] FOR. I'M LOOKING FOR ONE THAT CAN'T LOOK
[1:16:06] AT HIS ABILITY. HE CAN'T LOOK AT HIS
[1:16:08] ATTENDANCE. HE CAN'T LOOK AT HIS GOOD
[1:16:10] WORKS. HE CAN'T LOOK AT, WELL, I DID
[1:16:12] THIS GOOD. I DID THAT. HE WANTS TO FIND
[1:16:14] THE ONE THAT SAYS, I'VE REALLY MESSED
[1:16:16] EVERYTHING UP. I'VE TRIED SO MANY TIMES,
[1:16:18] BUT I CAN NEVER MAKE IT RIGHT. BUT OH,
[1:16:21] GOD, IF YOU'LL JUST HAVE MERCY ON ME.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; GOD TAKES NOBODYIES AND MAKES THEM
[1:16:28] SOMEBODY. AND I CERTAINLY WAS A NOBODY.
[1:16:30] BUT I'M SO THANKFUL THAT GOD GOT A HOLD
[1:16:33] OF MY LIFE. I TRIED TO FIT IN OUT THERE
[1:16:35] IN THE WORLD, AND I COULDN'T FIT IN AS
[1:16:37] MUCH AS I TRIED. WHY? BECAUSE I DIDN'T
[1:16:40] BELONG OUT THERE.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ACTS 10. I LOVE THIS ONE, TOO.
[1:16:48] HERE'S CORNELIUS, RIGHT? I believe he's
[1:16:51] of the Oh, I forget the band. He's
[1:16:54] believe a soldier. Cornelius. He's He's
[1:16:57] seeking God
[1:17:00] and and an angel appears to the angel of
[1:17:03] God appears to him by vision.
[1:17:06] What What does Cornelius Cornelius? HE'S
[1:17:08] DESIRING GOD. HE WANTS the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:10] HE HE HE WANTS MORE OF GOD.
[1:17:13] HERE'S THE ANGEL OF GOD STANDING BEFORE
[1:17:15] HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? HEY, uh
[1:17:19] there's a guy named Peter. Huh?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL OF GOD is here. Won't he just
[1:17:28] give me the Holy Ghost?
[1:17:31] Won't he just give me what I have need
[1:17:34] of? No. because God is confined to his
[1:17:37] body.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So, we could jump over there where
[1:17:40] Peter, you know, he's he's up on the
[1:17:41] roof sleeping. He's he's having and here
[1:17:44] he sees the big net and things coming
[1:17:45] down and things clean and unclean and
[1:17:47] God tells him, "Eat." Goes up, comes
[1:17:48] down, eat. YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, I'VE
[1:17:50] NEVER eaten any unclean thing in ALL MY
[1:17:52] LIFE." IF YOU understand the Levitical
[1:17:53] law, uh there were certain uh uh uh uh
[1:17:55] foods that the the children of Israel
[1:17:58] couldn't eat, and now the Lord's telling
[1:17:59] them to eat it. And what a
[1:18:00] contradiction.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; But what is he showing? HE'S SHOWN HIM
[1:18:04] THAT THERE'S A CROSSING THERE. THERE
[1:18:06] THERE IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE JEWS, BUT
[1:18:08] IT'S FOR THE GENTILE. AND AND AND HE
[1:18:10] TELLS THEM, "DON'T DON'T CALL THAT WHICH
[1:18:13] I'VE MADE CLEAN, UNCLEAN." HOW I DON'T
[1:18:16] CARE HOW UNCLEAN YOU'VE BEEN YOUR WHOLE
[1:18:18] LIFE. GOD CALLS YOU CLEAN. GOD CALLS YOU
[1:18:21] FORGIVEN. GOD CALLS YOU HIS OWN. GOD
[1:18:24] CALLS YOU A SON.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLS YOU DELIVERED. GOD CALLS YOU
[1:18:28] FREE.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And so what IS IT DOING? GOD'S BRINGING
[1:18:33] THE BODY TOGETHER NOW. PETER, I BELIEVE
[1:18:36] FROM JED NOW COMING OVER. AND WHAT IS HE
[1:18:38] COMING? AND PETER STARTS TO MINISTER the
[1:18:41] word. And as Peter YET SPAKE THESE
[1:18:43] WORDS, THE HOLY GHOST fell upon all them
[1:18:46] that heard the word.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; What was it? Jesus now in his body.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And these are the characteristics OF THE
[1:18:56] BODY. THE BOOKS OF BOOK OF ACTS IS THE
[1:18:58] ACTS OF THE HOLY GHOST in his believing
[1:19:02] children.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say this. HE SAID
[1:19:05] AND AND WHAT JESUS BEGAN TO DO IN
[1:19:07] GALILEE, he continues to do now through
[1:19:10] his display of the token of THE HOLY
[1:19:13] SPIRIT BACK UPON THE CHURCH. For it was
[1:19:15] not the acts of the apostles. IT WAS THE
[1:19:18] ACTS OF THE HOLY Ghost in the apostles.
[1:19:21] And that was the token. Look what he
[1:19:24] said. his display of the token. It's
[1:19:27] Christ the Holy Ghost displaying the
[1:19:29] token life in you.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Who Who's doing the acting?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Who is doing the acting in your life?
[1:19:41] Who who is doing the acting? IS IT THE
[1:19:43] HOLY GHOST OR IS IT HOLY your flesh?
[1:19:50] [clears throat]
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; we
[1:19:55] Sunday's almost over. And if the Lord
[1:19:57] carries Monday's coming,
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN YOUR SAME CAR
[1:20:00] WITH YOUR SAME COUNTRY MUSIC.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to go back TO YOUR SAME JOB
[1:20:04] WITH THE SAME DIRTY JOKES.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; AND NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE YOU
[1:20:12] GOING TO DO about it?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; YOU HEARD WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:20:17] THIS MORNING ON THE TAPE. HE SAID,
[1:20:19] "TODAY, IT'S YOUR CHOICE. AMEN.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You get TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU'LL BE IN 5
[1:20:24] YEARS. YOU MIGHT BE IN A BURNING HELL OR
[1:20:27] YOU MIGHT BE IN GLORY. YOU CAN BE A
[1:20:28] SINNER OR YOU CAN BE A SAINT. BUT BY
[1:20:31] HEARING THE WORD BY FAITH, I SAY IT'S
[1:20:33] TIME TO MAKE A CHOICE. IT'S A GIFT. JUST
[1:20:37] CHOOSE TO RECEIVE IT. A PARDON IS NOT A
[1:20:39] PARDON UNLESS IT'S ACCEPTED.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; AND THEN ONCE YOU ACCEPT IT, SEE, THAT'S
[1:20:45] THE PROBLEM. EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO GET
[1:20:47] THEIR LIFE CLEANED UP FOR GOD. HE'S
[1:20:49] KNOCKING on your heart.
[1:20:52] And you keep saying, "Lord, hold on. My
[1:20:54] room's dirty.
[1:20:56] My kitchen's dirty.
[1:20:58] I'm a mess." And he's out there banging
[1:21:00] on the door. And you keep waiting. No,
[1:21:03] Lord. I I'm I'M I'M I I STILL GOT MORE
[1:21:06] WORK TO DO. You cannot get your living
[1:21:09] room clean enough for Jesus.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; There ain't enough bleach.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; There ain't enough incense. [applause]
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; There ain't enough maids.
[1:21:20] there there is not enough things that
[1:21:22] you can DO TO TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR LIFE
[1:21:25] AND MAKE YOURSELF READY FOR JESUS.
[1:21:27] THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO IS SAY,
[1:21:28] "LORD, I've made a mess of things. I
[1:21:31] I've made a mess of a lot of things,
[1:21:33] Lord Jesus, but you're knocking ON MY
[1:21:35] HEART. JUST COME ON INSIDE, LORD. I'M
[1:21:37] BROKEN. I'M A MESS. I I CAN'T GET IT
[1:21:40] RIGHT. I FALL DOWN. I GO THROUGH CYCLES.
[1:21:43] I QUIT DRINKING. I START DRINKING. I
[1:21:45] QUIT SMOKING. I START SMOKING. I DO THIS
[1:21:48] AND I DO THAT. I look AND I LOST. THEN I
[1:21:50] DON'T AND THEN I DO. LORD, I JUST NEED
[1:21:53] YOUR HELP.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Why don't you just choose to
[1:21:57] let them in tonight?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; What is it?" And until that happens,
[1:22:05] there's that old nature in you. And if
[1:22:07] you're seeing the characteristics of an
[1:22:09] old nature when your wife talks back to
[1:22:12] you,
[1:22:14] well, if you had the Holy Ghost, you
[1:22:16] would recognize I'm the headship of this
[1:22:17] home.
[1:22:19] Oh, really?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Well, MAYBE IF YOU HAD THE
[1:22:24] HOLY GHOST, YOUR WIFE WOULDN'T FEEL THE
[1:22:25] WAY SHE FEELS.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe your WIFE IS SUCH A NERVOUS WRECK
[1:22:30] BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AND WATCHING
[1:22:32] THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AND
[1:22:33] WATCHING AND SHE'S ALL NERVOUS AND SHE'S
[1:22:35] ALL ON EDGE AND SHE DON'T EVEN KNOW
[1:22:37] WONDER WHY THE HOUSE IS IT FEELS THE WAY
[1:22:39] IT IS. IT'S CUZ SOME OF YOU MEN ARE
[1:22:41] DOING THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING AND
[1:22:42] YOU'RE BLAMING IT ON YOUR WIFE. SHAME ON
[1:22:44] YOU. THAT'S NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
[1:22:47] THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S NOT TO CONDEMN
[1:22:49] YOU. THAT'S TO SHOW YOU THERE'S HIGHER
[1:22:50] HEIGHTS. THERE'S DEEPER DEPTHS. THERE'S
[1:22:52] GREATER DELIVERANCE. THERE'S GREATER
[1:22:54] SURRENDER.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Just quickly moving towards a close.
[1:23:01] Brother said, "You are THE TEMPLE OF
[1:23:03] GOD. YOU ARE the temple that God wants
[1:23:05] to dwell in and express himself through
[1:23:08] it that all nations might know him."
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word,
[1:23:14] Lord.
[1:23:16] Scripture says, "Yet a little while and
[1:23:18] the world seeth me no more, but ye see
[1:23:20] me because I live, ye live also."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You see what these the book of Acts is?
[1:23:30] It's the very life of Jesus Christ now
[1:23:34] acting itself out in his believing
[1:23:36] children. And if you don't see the
[1:23:38] fruits of that in your life, GOD IS
[1:23:40] CALLING TO YOU TO TELL YOU there's more
[1:23:42] for you. There's a greater surrender.
[1:23:45] There's deeper depths. There's more
[1:23:46] revelation.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Right? Because he was THE WORD AND THE
[1:23:53] WORD always corrects the error.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; The word always corrects the error of
[1:23:58] the age, the church, and the individual.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So then THAT'S WHY WE THANK GOD FOR
[1:24:05] SENDING US A MESSAGE. NOT ONLY DOES IT
[1:24:07] CORRECT THE HEIR TO THE AGE, TO THE
[1:24:09] CHURCH, AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL. IF I
[1:24:12] COULD SAY IT LIKE THIS, IT EXPOSES
[1:24:14] WHAT'S WRONG AND REVEALS what's right.
[1:24:17] Now, we don't have time for it, BUT WE
[1:24:19] COULD ROLL THROUGH THE DAYS OF NOAH AND
[1:24:21] AND ROLL THROUGH certain uh uh things in
[1:24:23] scripture, BUT BROTHER BANNER SAID UH UH
[1:24:26] SPEAKING UH HE HE SAYS OF CHRIST, HE
[1:24:29] SAID HE WAS THE SPOKEN WORD OF THAT AGE.
[1:24:31] SO THEREFORE, THE IDENTIFIED
[1:24:32] CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD WAS IN CHRIST.
[1:24:35] AND I'M TRYING TO SHOW THAT THOSE
[1:24:36] CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOW TO be in the
[1:24:38] body of Christ. And it only COMES BY ONE
[1:24:42] WAY AND THAT'S the logos, the anointing.
[1:24:46] Is that what he said,
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, I I can start over.
[1:24:54] It's what the vindicated prophet said,
[1:24:55] right? The logos is the anointing
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; that comes upon the word,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; right? Now, just because there's
[1:25:02] imitators, impersonators, and just
[1:25:04] because the the rain falls on the just
[1:25:06] and the unjust
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; that that
[1:25:10] don't let that don't let the scarecrow
[1:25:12] scare you,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; but the logos is the anointing.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I wasn't in Pentecost, so I'm not,
[1:25:21] you know, I don't I'm not worried about
[1:25:22] it.
[1:25:24] I'm I you know I I I've been raised up
[1:25:27] right by a believing pastor who's
[1:25:29] preached this message with all of his
[1:25:31] heart for for 50 years. So So I haven't
[1:25:34] had to battle through a lot of those
[1:25:35] things and worry about those things. I I
[1:25:38] say because I'm freeborn.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. HALLELUJAH. I DON'T I
[1:25:43] don't have all that. so that I could
[1:25:44] look at the PURITY OF THE WORD. AND WHEN
[1:25:46] MY PROPHET TELLS ME THE LOGOS IS THE
[1:25:48] ANOINTING AND THAT LOGOS IS WHAT DIVIDED
[1:25:51] ITSELF OUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, I
[1:25:53] KNOW THAT'S WHAT I NEED.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Because it makes a living action in your
[1:25:59] life.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Now, just trying to move quickly uh by
[1:26:02] the help of God, we'll bring this to a
[1:26:04] close.
[1:26:07] Now, I just want to uh show this here in
[1:26:12] the scripture.
[1:26:14] Now, but uh
[1:26:17] earlier in this message and God
[1:26:18] identifying himself, he he he he he
[1:26:21] brings out and shows how that Satan was
[1:26:24] tempting Jesus.
[1:26:26] But what did Jesus do? He stayed with
[1:26:28] the word. That's a characteristic
[1:26:31] of a believer.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. Get behind
[1:26:36] me. He stayed right with the word. Now,
[1:26:39] look at this. I I just want to to lay
[1:26:40] this in as we'll come to a close. I hope
[1:26:43] we're all doing okay. We have a a water
[1:26:45] baptism uh right after this. Uh so we're
[1:26:48] we're we're excited about that and
[1:26:49] looking at what the the Lord will have
[1:26:51] for us there. Uh Mark 16
[1:26:56] verse 17 through 18. It says, "And these
[1:26:59] signs shall follow them that think
[1:27:05] or gather enough information."
[1:27:08] These shall follow them that believe in
[1:27:10] my name. They shall cast out devils, and
[1:27:12] they shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:27:13] shall take up serpents, and if they
[1:27:15] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:27:18] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:27:20] sick, and they shall recover.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I I love what brother Brandham says
[1:27:28] in
[1:27:30] why Christ speak. I believe it is. He
[1:27:32] says, "Faith sees what God wants you to
[1:27:34] see."
[1:27:36] Faith sees what God sees.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; We know that faith is what? A
[1:27:44] revelation.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Now, just in closing, think of I believe
[1:27:50] Elisha with Gahhesa.
[1:27:53] His servant comes in and says, "We're
[1:27:55] done for."
[1:27:57] We are surrounded by the enemy.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what many of us feel like in
[1:28:02] our life. We're surrounded by
[1:28:03] circumstance.
[1:28:05] We're surrounded by trouble. We're
[1:28:08] surrounded by impossibilities.
[1:28:10] We we we only can see the negative
[1:28:15] things,
[1:28:18] right? Many times we can only see the
[1:28:22] opposition.
[1:28:24] Are you hearing me? Okay. Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; See, in this story in the Bible with
[1:28:28] Elijah and Gahesa, GAHESA WALKS OUT AND
[1:28:31] HE SAYS, "OH, MASTER,
[1:28:34] WE ARE SURROUNDED by the enemy."
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And what does he say? He said, "THERE'S
[1:28:41] MORE WITH US."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Than that ARE AGAINST US.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S MORE GOOD FOR
[1:28:49] YOU
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; THAN THERE'S BAD.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; THERE'S MORE BLESSINGS THAN CURSINGS.
[1:28:54] THERE'S MORE DELIVERANCE THAN BONDAGE.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; But what DID HE NEED TO HAVE DONE?
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; HE NEEDED HIS EYES TO BE OPEN. NOW, HE
[1:29:09] WASN'T BLIND,
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; but he needed TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION
[1:29:14] THE WAY THAT GOD WAS LOOKING AT THE
[1:29:17] SITUATION.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You look at your situation, it's
[1:29:21] impossible. OH, I'LL NEVER. BUT HOW DOES
[1:29:23] [screaming] GOD LOOK AT THE SITUATION?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; By revelation, WHAT DID HE SAY? LOOK,
[1:29:28] JUST turn the PICTURE TO THE RIGHT.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT SOME SUPERSONIC CLOUD. THAT'S
[1:29:34] NOT SOME ROCKET. THAT'S NOT JUST SOME
[1:29:37] SOME SOME CLOUD THAT WAS DRIFTING BY.
[1:29:39] NO, THAT'S OUR LORD UP THERE.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS DAY. THE
[1:29:45] QUICKENING POWER HAS COME TO US. OPEN
[1:29:48] THE SEVEN SEALS. WHAT WAS THAT? THE
[1:29:50] INTELLIGENCE OF A MAN. NO. THE
[1:29:52] QUICKENING POWER OF GOD. SEE, THE
[1:29:55] QUICKENING POWER FORETOLD THIS WOULD
[1:29:57] TAKE PLACE. THE QUICKENING POWER OF GOD
[1:29:59] MADE THE WORD TESTIFY TO IT. IT'S the
[1:30:01] truth. The angel of the Lord, I TOLD
[1:30:04] YOU, was around IN THE PILLAR OF FIRE,
[1:30:06] QUICKENING POWER. LET THE WORLD TESTIFY
[1:30:08] THAT IT'S THE TRUTH. And in that, they
[1:30:11] didn't know what it was, right? The
[1:30:13] world don't know what it is.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE STILL ARGUING AND FUSSING ABOUT
[1:30:18] IT.
[1:30:20] THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET ON UH UH UH
[1:30:23] UH UH THINGS AND TRY TO TRY TO SAY WHAT
[1:30:26] IT REALLY WAS, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:30:28] IT WAS. AND WE knew
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; just look this away.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S OUR LORD UP THERE.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A PROPHETIC INSIGHT. IT TOOK A
[1:30:43] REVELATION TO SAY THIS IS MORE THAN A
[1:30:46] MAN. THIS IS MORE than the intelligence
[1:30:48] of man. THIS ISN'T JUST BECAUSE SOME
[1:30:49] GOOD PREACHER. THIS JUST AIN'T A
[1:30:51] PROPHETIC GIFT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE
[1:30:53] VERY INTELLIGENCE OF GOD COMING TO TELL
[1:30:55] YOU WHO YOU ARE.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Just a little bit further. Is that all
[1:31:02] right?
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] Just five more minutes, we'll be done.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; John 14 and 12. Are you going to notice
[1:31:15] a theme here? Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:31:17] you, he that believeth,
[1:31:20] you got to believe.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; But I love how we opened our scripture
[1:31:26] because you can only believe if it's
[1:31:29] given to you to believe.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't walk away.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; That's why you run and you come back.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; That's why you give up and come back.
[1:31:39] Because it AIN'T YOU, IT'S CHRIST IN YOU
[1:31:41] holding on.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I'd have been DEAD OR
[1:31:45] LOCKED UP OR 6 feet deep a long time
[1:31:47] ago. Oh, but something inside of me HAS
[1:31:50] BEEN HOLDING ON, WAITING FOR THE DAY I
[1:31:53] FINALLY JUST SAID, "LORD,
[1:31:55] I'M READY."
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me, the works that
[1:32:00] I do shall you do also, and greater
[1:32:01] works than these shall you do because I
[1:32:03] go unto my father.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I'll just invite the musicians to come
[1:32:07] as we finish out these couple quotes.
[1:32:11] God identified himself by his
[1:32:13] characteristics. Now notice in John
[1:32:15] 14:12, he that believeth on me, he said,
[1:32:18] has my identification.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; My characteristics. He that believeth on
[1:32:23] me, the works that I do shall he DO
[1:32:25] ALSO. THAT IDENTIFIES THAT THE character
[1:32:27] of Christ is in him. Displaying the
[1:32:30] characteristics of him. Amen. I feel
[1:32:33] pretty religious right now. I I'm a
[1:32:35] little horse. Yes, sir. Oh my. See,
[1:32:36] there is no mistake about it. HIS LIFE.
[1:32:38] HE THAT BELIEVETH on me, the works that
[1:32:40] I do shall he do also. See that
[1:32:43] identifies the characteristics.
[1:32:46] Same thing he said. If my character
[1:32:52] if my character
[1:32:55] doesn't identify myself, God in him,
[1:32:58] then don't believe him. Now he also said
[1:33:01] that he would be identified in that.
[1:33:03] Then if it doesn't identify him, then he
[1:33:05] isn't what he says. Look, if God says
[1:33:08] he's a a savior, if God says he's a
[1:33:10] deliverer,
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; he's a savior and he's a deliverer.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And today, IF CHRIST DOESN'T identify
[1:33:20] himself, the characteristics of Christ
[1:33:22] identify us as being of Christ,
[1:33:25] believing the word. Jesus was the word.
[1:33:27] So, he had to believe the word. And how
[1:33:31] can we say that we are of Christ and
[1:33:34] then deny any word of that Bible?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Don't look at that as a negative.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A NEGATIVE. WHAT HE'S TELLING
[1:33:44] YOU IS YOU ARE WHAT THE WORD SAYS YOU
[1:33:47] ARE.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PREDESTINATED. YOU ARE A SON OF
[1:33:51] GOD. YOU WERE IN [screaming] HIS MIND
[1:33:53] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU
[1:33:55] ARE GOING IN A RAPTURE. YOU ARE
[1:33:57] VICTORIOUS. IF GOD BE BEFORE US, THEN
[1:33:59] WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? GREATER IS HE
[1:34:01] THAT IS IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE
[1:34:04] WORLD. WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO THESE
[1:34:06] THINGS? IF GOD BEFORE [screaming] US,
[1:34:09] WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:6, BUT WITHOUT FAITH, maybe
[1:34:22] on uh what is that on the wings?
[1:34:33] Hebrews 11:6, "BUT WITHOUT FAITH IT is
[1:34:35] impossible to please him.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God
[1:34:41] must believe,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; not must
[1:34:47] have a perfect attendance at church,
[1:34:51] must memorize five books in the Bible.
[1:34:56] Come on, help me out.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Because look, SATAN WANTS TO MAKE US
[1:35:02] GOOD message Catholics.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; We're always wanting a part in it.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; What can I do? What can I do?
[1:35:16] You can't do nothing. Haven't you
[1:35:19] figured that out? Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; You can't.
[1:35:26] I would say he can, but he already did.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You're already forgiven.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; While we were yet sinners, Christ died
[1:35:40] for you. [applause]
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you were ever born and
[1:35:47] manifested in this age, he already
[1:35:50] forgave you when
[1:35:53] he was the lamb slain before the
[1:35:57] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's rigged. [singing]
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Satan loses.
[1:36:06] GOD WINS. YOU'RE PART OF GOD. That makes
[1:36:10] YOU A WINNER. YOU EITHER BELIEVE IT OR
[1:36:14] YOU DON'T.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Because without faith it's impossible to
[1:36:24] please him. For he that cometh to God.
[1:36:29] That's what you're doing tonight,
[1:36:30] brother Jacob. You're coming to God.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And all you got to do for he that cometh
[1:36:37] to God must believe
[1:36:39] that he is.
[1:36:41] And he
[1:36:43] is a rewarder
[1:36:48] of them that diligently seek him.
[1:36:52] But the Bible says you can't even seek
[1:36:54] him.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; If he wasn't drawing you,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; the very reason you're seeking him is
[1:37:03] because you're his.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God.
[1:37:09] So something in you is crying out.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; I need more.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I NEED GOD.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I NEED DELIVERANCE. What is it? It's the
[1:37:18] real you.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It's that real you down on the inside
[1:37:23] and saying all this other stuff, it
[1:37:26] never worked.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; But there's something in my soul crying
[1:37:30] out. Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Paul says this in Romans
[1:37:38] 4:19.
[1:37:40] He says, "And being not weak in faith,"
[1:37:42] [music] speaking of Abraham, "he
[1:37:45] considered not HIS OWN BODY NOW DEAD
[1:37:46] WHEN HE WAS about 140 years old, neither
[1:37:50] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. HE
[1:37:52] STAGGERED NOT AT THE PROMISE of God
[1:37:53] through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:37:56] faith, giving glory to God.
[1:37:59] And being fully persuaded
[1:38:02] what he promised,
[1:38:06] he was also able to perform.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I've had a lot of people make me
[1:38:12] promises.
[1:38:15] [snorts]
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; I've had A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME, "I'LL
[1:38:16] PAY YOU BACK."
[1:38:19] I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "I'LL be
[1:38:21] there tomorrow." I've had a lot of
[1:38:24] PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING, BUT
[1:38:26] THEY DIDN'T HAVE the character or THE
[1:38:29] ABILITY TO BRING TO PASS WHAT THEY SAID.
[1:38:36] But my Bible tells ME
[1:38:39] THAT GOD is not a man that he should
[1:38:41] lie. AND IF HE TOLD you
[1:38:46] if you call on the name OF THE LORD YOU
[1:38:48] SHALL BE SAVED THEN I SAY CALL ON THE
[1:38:51] NAME OF THE LORD my God is able to
[1:38:54] PERFORM THAT WHICH HE PROMISED. IF HE
[1:38:56] SAID BY MY STRIPES you are healed then
[1:38:59] you are already healed. If he's GIVEN
[1:39:01] YOU A PROMISE BY HIS WORD [cheering]
[1:39:03] that God will perform that which he has
[1:39:07] promised.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:39:11] Oh, there are two roads.
[1:39:15] Amen. If you could help brother Jacob go
[1:39:17] and get ready, brother Chris.
[1:39:27] Oh, it takes [music]
[1:39:37] Oh.
[1:39:47] There [singing] are two roads
[1:39:51] you may [music] take.
[1:39:55] One by side,
[1:39:59] one by faith.
[1:40:02] Oh, [singing and music] take the word of
[1:40:04] God.
[1:40:07] What you see
[1:40:12] oh
[1:40:14] [singing] is what will be.
[1:40:18] Oh set your wings
[1:40:22] to the winds [music and singing] of
[1:40:24] faith.
[1:40:26] Oh you can fly
[1:40:30] in a high place.
[1:40:34] Lord, do not struggle. [singing]
[1:40:38] It's by grace.
[1:40:41] [music]
[1:40:42] Set [singing] your wings
[1:40:46] to the [music] wind. What's your name?
[1:40:48] What's your cry?
[1:40:50] Watch your
[1:40:55] cry.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[1:41:10] I am by
[1:41:14] the world.
[1:41:22] Set [music] your way
[1:41:25] to his
[1:41:28] [music and singing]
[1:41:34] I [music and singing]
[1:41:44] [music]
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. We're going to have a
[1:41:54] baptism [music] and brother Matthew is
[1:41:57] going to baptize. I believe Jacob is a a
[1:42:00] longtime friend, right? school made uh
[1:42:03] of Matthew and and I I just think it's
[1:42:06] wonderful [music] and uh you know I I I
[1:42:11] thought of when
[1:42:13] Matthew is preaching he said we want a
[1:42:16] God that can go out and deliver the
[1:42:20] alcoholic
[1:42:22] can deliver the one that's in the
[1:42:24] bondage the one that that can come to
[1:42:28] the Lord but he's got to use you to do
[1:42:30] do it.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And and that's the marvelous thing is
[1:42:36] and I think one of the thing really I
[1:42:39] wanted I know Matthew was trying to get
[1:42:41] across to you this evening. Don't sell
[1:42:43] yourself short. You're anointed
[1:42:47] for the job.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; You know anointed also means appointed.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Do you you know what I mean? And so
[1:42:56] you're appointed and if he appoints you
[1:42:59] for the job, he's going to equip you
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; with the things to do the job.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to worry. You know,
[1:43:08] even they even said, don't take no
[1:43:09] thought of what you said. The spirit of
[1:43:12] God will give you the words to say. And
[1:43:14] I don't know if you've ever testified to
[1:43:16] somebody, all of a sudden the word of
[1:43:18] God's just flowing out of you and it's
[1:43:20] almost like you're revelating yourself.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And that's the
[1:43:25] kind of God we serve. And I also another
[1:43:29] point that I thought Matthew brought out
[1:43:30] so beautiful was about the call
[1:43:34] and how you know when you talk about not
[1:43:38] letting Jesus into your house. Open the
[1:43:41] door, let Jesus in. He'll help you clean
[1:43:43] it.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; He'll help you clean the living room.
[1:43:47] That's the kind of God he is.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; He'll put stuff in their place. He'll
[1:43:51] come in and he'll clean it. He'll go
[1:43:53] into your bedroom. He'll go in every
[1:43:54] part of your heart and your life and
[1:43:57] he'll take it through. But all you got
[1:44:00] to do is open that door. And I just
[1:44:02] couldn't help but get away from Romans.
[1:44:05] I just want to read this to you as
[1:44:08] they're
[1:44:10] as uh um
[1:44:14] uh Matthew's preparing for baptism. And
[1:44:16] it said in Romans 9, he said, "And not
[1:44:19] only this, but when Rebecca also had
[1:44:23] conceived by one, even by our father
[1:44:26] Isaac,
[1:44:28] for the children being not yet born,
[1:44:33] neither having done any good or evil,
[1:44:38] that the purpose of God according to
[1:44:42] election,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; might stand, not of works,
[1:44:48] but of him that calleth.
[1:44:52] And I that I that's the thing that if
[1:44:55] you could only get that part down when
[1:44:59] he's calling you and he's tugging on you
[1:45:03] and he's reaching out to you for no
[1:45:06] matter what it is, it's a deep calling
[1:45:09] to a deep,
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; you know, whether it's to go higher in
[1:45:13] the Lord, whether it's to lay for
[1:45:15] yourself a pattern of good works in your
[1:45:18] life, whether it's to ask the Lord, what
[1:45:21] can I do for you, Lord. It It's a deep
[1:45:24] that's got to start on his end.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And he calls. So you might think it's
[1:45:30] conviction, but it's not conviction.
[1:45:33] It's a call to a higher, right? And and
[1:45:36] he won't call you if he doesn't have it.
[1:45:40] I just read in oncoming storm. He said,
[1:45:43] "Before God can warn you of a storm,
[1:45:46] he's got to provide a place of safety
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; for that storm.
[1:45:51] that
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; and I thought that was marvelous.
[1:45:54] There's got to be a place of safety
[1:45:56] first. And if the and and the world
[1:46:00] warned you,
[1:46:02] you know, if you know in in alcoholics
[1:46:06] anominous
[1:46:07] and I'm not against that thing. Anything
[1:46:10] that helps people, I'm for it. But they
[1:46:13] finally come to a place that they hear
[1:46:15] the warning.
[1:46:16] If you continue down this road, you will
[1:46:19] perish. They hear that warning and of
[1:46:23] course they as a group of men and women
[1:46:26] they try to provide a place of safety
[1:46:29] and I think that's wonderful but we know
[1:46:31] the real deliverance place.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; They teach they teach you'll always be
[1:46:37] an alcoholic so come to our place of
[1:46:39] safety. We teach we have a place of
[1:46:42] safety where alcohol doesn't exist
[1:46:44] anymore
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and and that's what's marvelous. But
[1:46:48] just listen to this as we finish reading
[1:46:51] it. He says, "It was said unto her, the
[1:46:54] elder shall serve the younger, as it is
[1:46:57] written, Jacob have I love, and Esau
[1:47:01] have I hated." What shall we say then?
[1:47:05] Is there unrighteousness with God? God
[1:47:09] forbid. For he said to Moses, "I will
[1:47:12] have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
[1:47:15] and I will have compassion on whom I'll
[1:47:18] have compassion."
[1:47:20] So then, it is not of him that willth,
[1:47:24] nor of him that runth, but of God that
[1:47:28] showeth mercy.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; And and isn't that what we're all here?
[1:47:33] We've all just God's just all showed us
[1:47:36] mercy. And and so uh Jake, God bless
[1:47:40] you, my brother. Lord be with you. And
[1:47:43] it's as brother Matthew baptized this
[1:47:47] young man. Uh it's God showing mercy.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; It's God that calleth.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; So you're actually seeing the scripture
[1:47:58] come to pass.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's him making himself known.
[1:48:10] And I'll just say one, I'm going to give
[1:48:12] you a little testimony. Matthew said he
[1:48:15] was raised up in a good Christian home
[1:48:17] by a good pastor. But that's not what
[1:48:21] saved him.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; What saved him was when God come down
[1:48:26] and dealt with his heart.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And you can't teach that.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; God's got to do that.
[1:48:34] And now we see the continuing fruit
[1:48:37] being manifest. So
[1:48:39] don't give up, buddy. God loves you.
[1:48:42] God's with you. Don't give up. You can
[1:48:45] have what you ask for. Just have faith.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you hear me? Okay.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Believe they have it miked. Uh this this
[1:48:58] is a wonderful opportunity u to be able
[1:49:00] to baptize my friend Jacob Cox. We uh
[1:49:06] he knows because I was the instigator. I
[1:49:08] was the I ran pretty hard. But um God
[1:49:12] got a hold of my life some 25 years ago
[1:49:16] around that time. Me and Jacob were were
[1:49:18] very good friends and we've remained
[1:49:20] friends. And uh I've always believed
[1:49:23] that he was a son of God and and we've
[1:49:26] kept in contact over the years and at
[1:49:30] some point when the time is right I'm
[1:49:32] I'm I know he can share some testimonies
[1:49:35] but I'll just say this there was a there
[1:49:38] was a time where Satan tried to take his
[1:49:41] life but because he was a son of God he
[1:49:44] couldn't do it because as the scripture
[1:49:46] says in Jeremiah 29:11 I know my
[1:49:49] thoughts that I think toward you they're
[1:49:51] They're not evil thoughts. They're
[1:49:52] thoughts of peace to bring you to an
[1:49:54] expected end. And Satan and the enemy
[1:49:58] has always tried to bring a certain
[1:49:59] result, but God's always been there.
[1:50:01] That pillar of fire has always been
[1:50:02] there standing between the seed and the
[1:50:05] enemy because God knows what he wants
[1:50:07] you to become. And there's nothing that
[1:50:09] can stop that. And I'm so thankful that
[1:50:11] that Jacob is is responding to that
[1:50:14] call. Is there something you just want
[1:50:16] to say, brother Jacob?
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I'm ready for God to be in this temple.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. that's that's good
[1:50:22] enough for me. He's ready for God to be
[1:50:24] in this temple. And and I and I was
[1:50:26] sharing him with the gospel. I said,
[1:50:28] "That's the promise is [music] to
[1:50:30] repent. Then you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:33] Then you get the power to bring the
[1:50:35] flesh under subjection uh uh to the Holy
[1:50:38] Ghost and those things of the word." So
[1:50:40] I just want to read the scripture here
[1:50:42] as we know that we were given a
[1:50:43] commission to go into all the world and
[1:50:45] preach the gospel and baptize them in
[1:50:47] the name of the father and of the son
[1:50:49] and of the holy ghost. And we know by
[1:50:51] divine revelation what that name is
[1:50:53] because Peter here in Acts chapter 2 he
[1:50:57] said now when they heard this they were
[1:50:59] pricricked in their heart and said unto
[1:51:01] Peter and to the rest of the apostles
[1:51:03] men and brethren what shall we do? Then
[1:51:09] Peter said unto them,"repent
[1:51:11] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[1:51:14] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:51:16] remission of sins, and ye shall receive
[1:51:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he's able to
[1:51:25] perform
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; that which he's promised? Amen. Praise
[1:51:29] the Lord.
[1:51:31] Not yet.
[1:51:32] Just
[1:51:34] Jacob according to the word of the Lord
[1:51:35] that says go into all the world and
[1:51:38] preach the gospel and baptize them in
[1:51:39] the name of the father and of the son
[1:51:40] and the holy ghost. I now baptize you in
[1:51:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51:49] Hallelujah.
[1:51:50] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:51:53] Amen. Why don't we sing that song?
[1:51:55] [applause] Victory is mine. Hallelujah.
[1:51:59] Let's just sing that. Why don't you
[1:52:01] stand and praise the Lord? And
[1:52:03] [applause] we'll just hands Ben and help
[1:52:04] us to sing this song. Well, victory is
[1:52:07] mine. Oh, victory. [music]
[1:52:16] [music]
[1:52:18] I told Satan to leave me behind.
[1:52:23] Victory [music] is mine.
[1:52:34] I knew that the Lord would bring me
[1:52:37] [music] out.
[1:52:40] Oh, I got him on my knees
[1:52:44] [music and singing]
[1:52:46] and I got up singing and shouting the
[1:52:49] victory.
[1:52:58] Victory today is mine. [music]
[1:53:04] I to
[1:53:07] leave behind.
[1:53:10] Victory [music] today is mine.
[1:53:14] Amen. I want to sing another song. and
[1:53:17] night might not fit in the flow of
[1:53:20] things, but I I really like it. And it
[1:53:24] it's the song that says, "I was made for
[1:53:27] more."
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And and that's
[1:53:31] what I want you to believe.
[1:53:35] Just think,
[1:53:37] I mean,
[1:53:40] you know, when when my when my kids
[1:53:43] weren't living so good,
[1:53:45] I always used to think, well, it was
[1:53:47] because I was a hippie.
[1:53:50] Well, that's not what it was. Their
[1:53:54] names were written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:53:55] Life. [music]
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just grateful to God.
[1:54:01] You understand
[1:54:03] that he used Lesie and I to bring them
[1:54:07] into [music] the world, but they would
[1:54:09] have come into the world anyway
[1:54:12] and they had been preachers anyway. It's
[1:54:14] a blessing to me that I have three sons
[1:54:16] that preach the gospel.
[1:54:19] But you would have never
[1:54:22] you would have never believed it looking
[1:54:25] at the kid that walked down the streets
[1:54:28] of California.
[1:54:31] And if you look at yourself,
[1:54:35] John, there's no way you'd ever think it
[1:54:37] could happen to you, right?
[1:54:42] You know, John's listening to the radio
[1:54:45] and this guy on the radio m mentions the
[1:54:48] name William Brandom.
[1:54:51] So John says that's that strikes him. So
[1:54:54] he starts reading and listening to
[1:54:55] brother Brandham. It's the truth.
[1:54:59] How he got you, I don't know.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; But he found every single one of you.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. And it doesn't mean that
[1:55:08] because you're brought up in a a message
[1:55:11] home that that's your message religion.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; God will make himself real to you
[1:55:16] personally.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And if he's calling you, [music]
[1:55:23] well, that's a good thing.
[1:55:28] We all got records.
[1:55:31] Ain't that right, Matt? Yeah. We don't
[1:55:34] even want to know. I know a lot of
[1:55:36] things about people's lives. And I'll
[1:55:39] tell you something. God is greater than
[1:55:42] everything that we've ever done. He that
[1:55:45] is in us is greater than he's in the
[1:55:48] world. Let God call you.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Don't fight him. Just surrender
[1:55:54] and say, you know, I I I've been made
[1:55:57] for more. Why should I stay in this
[1:56:01] condition of beating myself down and and
[1:56:06] everything when I know I was made for
[1:56:08] more? Help me sing it. [music]
[1:56:12] You know who?
[1:56:18] Oh,
[1:56:21] the cross of salvation
[1:56:23] [music and singing]
[1:56:26] was only the start. [music] I love that
[1:56:29] verse. Oh, [singing] now I am chosen,

[1:57:27] Oh, I know who I [music] am.
[1:57:32] Cuz I know who you [music] are.

[1:57:52] free and forgive. [music]
[1:57:56] Oh, and I have a future
[1:58:00] [music]
[1:58:01] and it's worthless.
[1:58:07] [music and singing] I was made
[1:58:10] in the grave. I was called by
[1:58:13] [music and singing]

[1:59:54] running [music] my [singing] way?
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope this evening [music] that
[2:00:06] you know you've been made for more
[2:00:10] and that God's got a job for you to do.
[2:00:14] Let the anointing of God's word
[2:00:18] quicken
[2:00:20] the word to you. Let him speak to your
[2:00:22] heart. Lay for yourself a pattern of
[2:00:25] good works [music] that your good works
[2:00:27] might glorify your father in heaven.
[2:00:30] Bring Christ into your life. [music]

[2:00:52] regardless
[2:00:54] [music]
[2:00:55] of what they may think of themselves,
[2:01:00] Father, you look on them as your child
[2:01:05] and you want to break every chain Satan
[2:01:08] has on them.
[2:01:10] They weren't made to tend a grave.
[2:01:15] They weren't made to lay in a bed of
[2:01:17] shame.
[2:01:19] They were made for more.
[2:01:22] Father, may we seek the more in our
[2:01:24] life. More of you,
[2:01:29] Father. May
[2:01:33] we just grow in the understanding of
[2:01:36] your grace and love towards [music] us.
[2:01:40] May we open the riches that the pillar
[2:01:43] of fire has brought to us in our day.
[2:01:46] Father, may we determine that we're
[2:01:48] going to leave this place this evening a
[2:01:51] better Christian
[2:01:53] than when we came in more effort to our
[2:01:57] spiritual life.
[2:02:00] Father, give us a spiritual mind.
[2:02:03] The carnal mind is emn with God, but the
[2:02:06] spiritual mind is life and liberty.
[2:02:09] Father, increase our faith
[2:02:12] because without faith, we have no
[2:02:14] spiritual reality.
[2:02:17] And Father, we pray today that our faith
[2:02:20] has been lifted up that we'll change the
[2:02:24] way we look at life and we'll have a
[2:02:27] choice of faith. We choose you, heavenly
[2:02:30] father. [music] We ask you to continue
[2:02:33] to bless us. In Jesus' name we pray.
[2:02:36] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[2:02:39] coming out. [music] I know it's cold,
[2:02:42] but we're going to a place where the
[2:02:44] weather's perfect.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish there was a song that
[2:02:49] really could describe heaven. But alls I
[2:02:52] can say is he knows exactly what you
[2:02:56] like. If you like 78,
[2:02:59] it'll be 78. And I'll be there and it'll
[2:03:03] be 80 for me and 78 for you. and it's
[2:03:07] going to be perfect. Whatever you want.
[2:03:10] It's tailor made just for you. And
[2:03:13] there's a place at that table that
[2:03:15] nobody can sit but you.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody can take your place.
[2:03:22] Amen. Go in peace. God bless you.
[2:03:26] A amen.
[2:03:30] You are dismissed. [music]
[2:03:44] Oh,
[2:03:46] you're
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; And this word is true
[2:04:13] [music]
[2:04:16] all the time.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; I will shine [singing] light
[2:04:43] all the time.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] [music]
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:35] Heat. Heat.
[2:05:46] Hallelujah.
[2:05:57] Hallelujah.
[2:06:16] Hallelujah.
[2:06:20] [music]
[2:06:21] Hallelujah.
[2:06:29] [music]
[2:06:33] Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] Hallelujah.
