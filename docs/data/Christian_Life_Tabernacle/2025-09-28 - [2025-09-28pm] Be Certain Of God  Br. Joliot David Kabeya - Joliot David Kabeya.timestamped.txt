[8:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[8:45] Amen. I must say, Brother Paul did a
[8:47] better job in his second language than I
[8:49] did on that song in my first language.
[8:52] Amen. Amen. We really appreciate the
[8:54] ministry that uh God has given to us and
[8:57] uh the expression. It's been a blessing
[8:59] to all of us. Amen. And it's nice when
[9:02] it coincides and it's right in line with
[9:04] the word. That's the best part. Amen.
[9:06] Amen. Let's sing an old time one. Uh,
[9:08] glory to his name. It starts out like
[9:11] down at the cross where my savior G or
[9:14] so. I guess the good old gospel G.
[9:19] Down at the cross where my Savior died.
[9:25] Down where for cleansing from sin I cry.
[9:32] There to my heart was the Lord.
[9:38] Glory
[9:40] to his name.
[9:44] Glory to his name.
[9:51] Glory
[9:52] to his name.
[9:56] [Music]
[9:57] There to my heart was the blood of lamb.
[10:04] Glory
[10:05] to his name.
[10:10] I am so onely
[10:13] safe from sin.
[10:17] Jesus so sweetly abides with me
[10:23] there at the cross where he took me.
[10:28] [Music]
[10:30] Glory
[10:31] to his name.
[10:35] I'm singing glory
[10:38] to his name.
[10:43] Glory
[10:44] to his name.
[10:48] [Music]
[10:49] There to my heart was the blood of life.
[10:56] Glory
[10:57] to his name.
[11:01] [Music]
[11:02] Oh precious fountain that saves from all
[11:07] sin.
[11:09] There I am so glad I have entered
[11:16] there. Jesus save me and keep me.
[11:21] [Music]
[11:22] Glory to his name.
[11:29] Glory to his name.
[11:35] Glory
[11:37] to his name.
[11:42] There to my heart was the blood of life.
[11:48] Glory
[11:50] to his name.
[11:53] [Music]
[11:55] Come to this mountain so rich and sweet.
[12:02] cast thy soul and the savior's
[12:06] king
[12:11] and be made.
[12:15] Glory
[12:16] to his name.
[12:20] [Music]
[12:21] Glory to his name.
[12:28] Glory
[12:30] to his name.
[12:34] There to my heart was the blood of
[12:40] [Music]
[12:41] glory
[12:43] to his name.
[12:47] Amen. Amen.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; I can tell from up here we're not
[12:51] getting full participation. There's some
[12:54] folks not singing their heart out. But
[12:57] maybe we'll sing one you like. We'll
[12:59] see. But amen. You know, brother,
[13:01] sister, we uh we think about the coming
[13:04] of the Lord and the rapture. And uh
[13:08] it kind of struck me last week that we
[13:12] we kind of place that as the highest
[13:14] miracle that could happen to us. A
[13:17] changing of our body from a mortal to
[13:19] immortal. To be changed in a moment, in
[13:22] the twinkling of an eye. Even if you're
[13:25] afraid of heights, you're going to take
[13:26] a a high-flying ride one of these days,
[13:29] right? But in a sense, that's really not
[13:32] the greatest miracle. The greatest
[13:34] miracle for most of us has already
[13:35] occurred. That change from death into
[13:38] life in our mortal bodies here. We've
[13:41] made the decision. Brother Ram said,
[13:43] "The hardest thing for a man to do is to
[13:46] believe another man."
[13:52] You know, that's the way the gospel is
[13:54] spread from lip to ear. It's it's
[13:58] witnessed by a life lived. But there has
[14:01] to be a gospel behind it, a message
[14:03] behind it. And we've received a message.
[14:06] We've seen the life lived.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; That's evidence. But the word behind it,
[14:11] it points to the living word. And that
[14:13] makes manifest. And that's the that's
[14:16] the greatest miracle that's already
[14:18] happened. So let me assure you that
[14:20] what's to come is just a a quickening.
[14:23] It's just a making alive and
[14:25] manifestation of what's already
[14:27] happened. And I I thinking too, and I
[14:30] don't want to take too much time. We've
[14:31] got ministers to minister to you, but in
[14:34] my uh in my growing up days, I'd say
[14:37] it's back in the 80s when you're
[14:38] influenced a lot. MTV came out. It was
[14:41] music television. And I thought we've
[14:43] got our MTV. It's manifestation through
[14:47] vindication.
[14:48] You know, this message has been so
[14:50] thoroughly vindicated.
[14:52] We don't need to to prove Brother
[14:54] Brandon was a prophet anymore. Within
[14:56] our midst, we know everything he said
[14:59] was right in line with the word. Now,
[15:00] it's time for us to manifest what he
[15:02] said, what he brought us. So, amen. So,
[15:06] amen. Let's let's sing I'm going
[15:08] through. I'm going through. It's the old
[15:10] number 91.
[15:14] Amen.
[15:17] [Music]
[15:23] Let's see. There's more to it than that,
[15:25] brothers.
[15:27] There should be about four or five
[15:29] verses of that.
[15:31] [Music]
[15:34] They put up the chorus and
[15:38] [Music]
[15:42] We'll give them a minute.
[15:44] [Music]
[15:48] How many have started out and they're
[15:50] going to end up the same way. Man,
[15:52] that's this song. It takes us back, but
[15:54] it says, you know, I've started in with
[15:56] Jesus and I'm going through. That's my
[15:58] determination. David said to this is the
[16:01] day the Lord hath made. And Timothy
[16:04] says, I am determined to rejoice and be
[16:06] glad in it. Not that I'm trying to add
[16:08] to the word, but that's my take on it is
[16:11] someone has to be here to believe it.
[16:12] Amen.
[16:16] Oh, they're that's quick.
[16:19] They're able to copy and paste from some
[16:20] other and put in
[16:23] amazing technology and and youth, I will
[16:26] say.
[16:33] [Music]
[16:49] Everybody remember this song?
[16:52] A few of us do.
[16:56] Not very many expect to go through.
[16:59] Amen.
[17:02] Lord, I have started to walk in the
[17:07] light
[17:10] shining upon
[17:12] from heaven so bright.
[17:16] I made the world and it's all easy.
[17:22] I've started in Jesus and I'm going.
[17:30] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going.
[17:37] I'll pay the price.
[17:40] Whatever others do,
[17:44] I'll take the way with the Lord despise
[17:49] me.
[17:50] I've started in with Jesus and I'm going
[17:55] through
[17:58] many they are who started the rain
[18:05] but with the light
[18:08] refuse to keep
[18:12] others accept it because it is
[18:18] a nonf Very many
[18:22] expect to go.
[18:26] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going
[18:31] through.
[18:33] I'll pay the price.
[18:36] Whatever others do,
[18:40] I'll take the way with the Lord is mine.
[18:46] I'm going through Jesus.
[18:50] I'm going through
[18:53] [Music]
[18:55] and I' rather walk with Jesus alone.
[19:02] Have for a pillow
[19:05] like Jing
[19:09] [Music]
[19:10] each moment with his face.
[19:15] That's straight from my pathway and
[19:19] where to go.
[19:22] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going
[19:27] through.
[19:29] I'll pay the price.
[19:32] Whatever others need,
[19:36] I'll make the way with the Lord is mine.
[19:42] I'm going through Jesus.
[19:46] I now the gospel call.
[19:50] Oh brother, now will take us cross.
[19:57] Give up the world
[20:00] and count it as long.
[20:03] Sell all thou
[20:06] and give to
[20:10] and go through with Jesus
[20:13] and go to him.
[20:17] I'm going.
[20:20] Yes, I'm going to.
[20:24] I'll pay the price.
[20:27] Whatever other
[20:31] I'll take the way with the Lord despise.
[20:37] I'm going through Jesus.
[20:41] I'm going through.
[20:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. I hope we really mean
[20:48] that. Brother Jose, you ready to come
[20:50] with your special brother? Amen. He
[20:52] share this burden up here with me.
[21:08] Bless you all. Like to say special. I
[21:10] had this in my heart. We can have
[21:13] struggles. We can have a lot of problems
[21:16] and things, right? But we know that up
[21:19] in heaven there is a home waiting for
[21:21] us. And we know that some glad morning
[21:24] when this life is over, we all fly away,
[21:27] right? You know, just a little testimony
[21:30] before

[21:46] said you know now we have been quickened
[21:49] now we have been healed right so the
[21:53] exact same thing that he was saying
[21:55] that's the exact same thing that we were
[21:57] commenting you know and saying that
[22:01] we're just waiting for the
[22:02] transformations of our bodies, right?
[22:05] And uh go like to sing this song. Some
[22:09] glad morning when this life is over,
[22:14] I'll
[22:16] fly away
[22:20] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[22:26] I

[37:44] Amen. Amen.
[37:46] Amen. We certainly want to rejoice over
[37:49] the things we're going to see,
[37:51] but we can also rejoice in the things
[37:53] that we won't see. Amen. Amen. Um, we
[37:58] want to remember Sister Rachel Bennett
[38:00] this evening. She's not feeling well.
[38:02] Uh, and Sister Peace is asking prayer
[38:04] for her husband who's sick and he's been
[38:06] uh placed in a nursing home. So, we want
[38:08] to remember them. And then uh also from
[38:11] this morning
[38:13] uh sister Zil Ma uh pray for her dad who
[38:17] will be undergoing surgery this coming
[38:19] Tuesday. His name is Juan Pablo. So we
[38:22] want to remember him.
[38:24] All right, let's just uh if we could
[38:26] stand in reverence and we go to the Lord
[38:28] in prayer. We get ready to change the
[38:29] order of the service.
[38:33] Dear Lord Jesus, once again, Lord, we
[38:35] approach you.
[38:37] And Lord, we're taught that there's
[38:40] three kinds of prayer.
[38:43] There's a prayer of asking,
[38:46] a prayer of forgiveness, and a prayer of
[38:48] thanksgiving. And Lord, we've sung our
[38:50] songs tonight as thanksgiving and
[38:52] worship and honor to you. And Lord, now
[38:55] our hearts cry out in the asking part.
[38:58] Lord, truly we say thank you for Calvary
[39:01] and thank you for the blood that's been
[39:02] provided. But Lord, we ask you just come
[39:05] on the scene.
[39:07] Lord, just answer these requests as you
[39:09] see fit and what we have need of. Lord,
[39:11] we come as your children. You wouldn't
[39:13] turn us away, Lord. We are begotten of
[39:16] you, Lord. As in the book of Jeremiah,
[39:20] it says that you formed me in a womb.
[39:23] You gave me the words to speak.
[39:26] Lord, you set before me a race to run.
[39:32] Lord, let me finish this course.
[39:35] Be triumphant in victory, not from my
[39:38] effort, but from a Christ that lives in
[39:40] me. So granted, Lord, tonight as we we
[39:44] lift our hearts and our needs, our
[39:46] request to you, Lord, that you'd come
[39:47] and fill our cups, Lord, to overflowing.
[39:51] And as a minister comes forth and
[39:53] preaches your word, we can say amen and
[39:55] rejoice and know that Lord, we have to
[39:58] line up with your word
[40:00] or it's by the written word and the
[40:02] spoken word, Lord, that changes us into
[40:05] eternal beings. Grant it to us now we
[40:07] pray. And we ask this now in the lovely
[40:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:12] Brothers, if you take the offering,
[40:13] appreciate it. Thank you, honey. Amen.
[40:16] Let's sing the little course. Peace.
[40:18] Peace. Wonderful peace. as we get ready
[40:20] to have brother Billy come.
[40:24] Oh peace
[40:28] and G probably is

[41:58] out.
[42:00] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord.
[42:06] As he passes
[42:09] by,
[42:11] you will find he's not too busy
[42:17] to hear your heart.
[42:22] He's passing
[42:25] by this moment.
[42:27] Adore.
[42:33] Reach out
[42:35] and touch the Lord
[42:38] as he
[42:41] goes by.

[42:51] as he passes.

[42:59] this to be easy
[43:03] to hear your heart.
[43:08] He's passing
[43:10] by his fall.

[52:13] Wonderful heavenly father,

[52:24] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you tonight
[52:27] &gt;&gt; for the opportunity you've given us.
[52:31] Come into this house of prayer.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; You know that without you, we could do
[52:37] nothing
[52:39] and we are waiting on you tonight.
[52:42] May you get us out of the way

[53:07] as we're going to turn in the pages of
[53:09] the Bible.
[53:10] and context.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Give us a context,
[53:14] Father, to help us tonight
[53:17] as you spoke to us this morning.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Commit into your hands
[53:22] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 17
[53:35] uh verse 8.
[53:41] And the word of the Lord came unto him,
[53:43] saying,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; "Arise, and get to Saraptor,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; which belonged to Zidon,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; and dwell there.
[53:56] [Music]
[54:00] Behold, I have commanded a widow woman
[54:03] there to sustain thee."
[54:06] He arose and went to Zerapta.
[54:10] And when he came to the gates of the
[54:12] city,
[54:16] &gt;&gt; behold, the widow woman was there
[54:18] gathering stick of sticks.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And he called in to her,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a
[54:31] little water in a vessel.
[54:35] that I may drink. And
[54:38] and he and and as she went to fetch
[54:42] he called her and said,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; "Bring me, I pray thee, a muscle of
[54:49] bread in thy hand."
[54:53] And he said, "As the Lord thy God
[54:55] liveth,
[54:58] [Music]
[55:03] &gt;&gt; I have not a cake, but a handful of meal
[55:05] in the barrel and and the oil in the
[55:08] cruise
[55:10] and oil in the cruise.
[55:14] And behold, I'm gathering two sticks
[55:20] that I may go in and address it for me
[55:23] and my son.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; We will eat. We may eat.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; We may eat it and die.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Elijah said unto her,
[55:34] "Fear not.
[55:38] Go and do as thou has said,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; but make me therefore a little cake
[55:45] first,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; and bring it unto me,
[55:52] and after make thee one, make thee for
[55:56] thy and thy son.
[56:00] For for thus sayeth the Lord
[56:03] of God of Israel,
[56:07] The barrel of meal shall not waste.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Neither shall the the the cru of oil
[56:15] fail
[56:19] until the day that the Lord sendeth rain
[56:22] upon the earth. May the Lord bless the
[56:25] reading of his word. You may have your
[56:27] seats.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; We thank you for coming back to the
[56:32] house of the Lord.
[56:34] My prayer tonight
[56:38] is that may God meet you
[56:44] &gt;&gt; because if God doesn't meet with us,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; what a natural man can bring unto you
[56:52] will not be helpful.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; May God meet you in his word
[57:00] and you have to go past the veil.
[57:04] and to see God through manal
[57:08] then something of supernatural may take
[57:10] effect.
[57:12] That's why said
[57:16] I'm not bringing a message
[57:19] to attract people towards me.
[57:22] You know that uh uh uh scripture very
[57:24] well on that book.
[57:27] But I have an interest
[57:30] for the things of God,
[57:32] not for the things of man.
[57:36] We don't have any interest for any man's
[57:38] glory.
[57:40] We don't have any interest for men's
[57:42] acclamation.
[57:44] We are not looking for leadership.
[57:47] We don't want the approval of men
[57:51] or the approval of those that are
[57:52] listening.
[57:54] But what we are looking for
[57:57] &gt;&gt; is to see established
[58:01] &gt;&gt; a spiritual relation
[58:05] between God and man
[58:10] in which men becomes new creatures in
[58:13] Christ.
[58:15] That's the that's the desire or the the
[58:18] desire for the preaching.
[58:21] We want to get into this mind of the
[58:23] prophet
[58:27] &gt;&gt; and to look by all means by the help of
[58:29] God
[58:33] to see a spiritual relation established
[58:37] between God and man.
[58:40] When that when that relation is
[58:42] established
[58:44] then we have confidence in one another.
[58:49] We see Christ in the brother.
[58:52] We see Christ in the sister.
[58:55] So tonight,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I am not a a a very uh uh uh smart
[59:02] preacher.
[59:04] I would like just to call for your
[59:06] attention.
[59:09] uh something that I've been meditating
[59:11] on
[59:13] and God placed this uh uh burden on my
[59:16] heart
[59:17] &gt;&gt; uh with some uh quote from the prophet.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; If I can give a a title to my subject,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; I will title it like the prophet
[59:30] be certain of God.
[59:33] That's our prayer
[59:36] &gt;&gt; from the pre preaching in this morning
[59:38] from brother Billy.
[59:40] I want I want to say this to encourage
[59:43] you tonight.
[59:45] Be certain of God.
[59:49] Don't be certain of your job.
[59:52] The the job will finish.
[59:55] Don't be certain of your health
[59:58] even when you're feeling well.
[1:00:02] the health will deteriorate.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Uh don't be certain of your uh uh uh
[1:00:13] colleagues or friendships
[1:00:17] because your friends will probably leave
[1:00:20] you.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Don't be certain of material things
[1:00:26] because those things will spoil away.
[1:00:31] God tells us to be certain of God.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's a sound that is clear.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It's a sound that doesn't have any
[1:00:40] distortion.
[1:00:43] It's a sound that takes away the fear
[1:00:48] be
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; because God has never been
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; and God will never be
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; the author of fearus
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; or the author of confusion.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; But God is the author of of certainty.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Be certain of God,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; my friends.
[1:01:13] There's so many things that are
[1:01:14] happening in this world.
[1:01:19] There's so many things that can also
[1:01:21] happen
[1:01:25] and there's those things which can bring
[1:01:27] us into a place where we question our
[1:01:28] own lives
[1:01:30] and as long as we live on earth
[1:01:34] there will be terrible things that can
[1:01:36] happen.
[1:01:38] But to the little church,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is telling you tonight,
[1:01:44] be certain of God.
[1:01:47] Even in dark darkness of night,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; even in h temprageous
[1:01:54] don't go back,
[1:01:57] don't leave your position.
[1:02:00] Don't go to the left or to the right.
[1:02:03] Don't try to do it by yourself.
[1:02:09] Don't think that you
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; don't think you have lost the battle.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't get defeated.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Be sureitive.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Be positive.
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Recognize the omnipotence in whom you
[1:02:28] have believed.
[1:02:30] be persuaded
[1:02:33] that he's able
[1:02:36] to do to continue the works that he
[1:02:38] started in you
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; until the day of his coming.
[1:02:43] God cannot start a work
[1:02:46] and to live it in the way.
[1:02:49] If God called you to salvation,
[1:02:53] regardless of what can happen,
[1:02:56] you are called to go to the end.
[1:02:59] That's why you have to be certain of
[1:03:01] God.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; is it's a it's a lot later than we
[1:03:07] think.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus is coming back soon.
[1:03:14] It's the time where the true Christians,
[1:03:18] they have to uh uh uh hold on to the
[1:03:20] word
[1:03:24] and the word has to be our priority
[1:03:26] number one.
[1:03:29] But my preparation for the coming of the
[1:03:31] Lord
[1:03:33] has to be more than my life
[1:03:37] has to be more than my my marriage.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to be more than my
[1:03:44] more than my family.
[1:03:47] I I could lose everything
[1:03:50] so that I don't lose that goal. But says
[1:03:55] in the second coming of the Lord
[1:03:58] It is a lot later than we think.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; to to occupy a pew.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; to hear a good sermon
[1:04:17] or come to church to hear good music.
[1:04:21] They all they all got their place.
[1:04:27] But what we better come to church to do
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; is to check up
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; with God
[1:04:38] and our soul salvation.
[1:04:43] For the day of redemption is near.
[1:04:47] when we come to church
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; is to check up
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; uh with God
[1:04:55] and God is his word.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; The word for your season
[1:05:02] concerning the salvation of our souls
[1:05:05] because the day of our redemption is
[1:05:07] here. When we come to church
[1:05:11] to hear the word,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; it's a word. It's a house of correction
[1:05:17] where I come to hear the word
[1:05:22] to know what the word wants me to be.
[1:05:27] Where do I need to stand in regard to
[1:05:29] the word
[1:05:32] and to to align my life towards that
[1:05:35] word
[1:05:37] to to see God in your life,
[1:05:41] you have to move away from the
[1:05:43] wickedness.
[1:05:45] You have to come back to repentance
[1:05:48] because it's the only way
[1:05:51] is to come back where you started
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; where you have left him off
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; and and and start the walk with him
[1:05:59] again
[1:06:02] because God doesn't work with sin.
[1:06:06] You need to move away from sin.
[1:06:09] In the le in the the reading that we
[1:06:11] have done
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; we see that Israel
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; which is the type of the church
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Israel was chosen by God.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; God sent Israel many prophets
[1:06:27] great men of God.
[1:06:31] Even in that we realize God didn't
[1:06:33] tolerate the sin.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; He he caused Israel
[1:06:41] to to to to to basically reap everything
[1:06:44] that they sow.
[1:06:47] If he cause Israel to reap everything
[1:06:50] that they sow,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; he will also cause us to reap what we
[1:06:55] are sowing,
[1:06:57] he's also going to cause us to reap what
[1:06:59] we are sowing.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't make exception for
[1:07:05] anybody.
[1:07:07] He saysam says in be certain of God says
[1:07:10] paragraph 16
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; and we've come to the place to think
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; that because we are resting upon what
[1:07:22] our forefathers did
[1:07:26] or what upon our great founders of our
[1:07:29] churches.
[1:07:32] what their great sacrifices was uh uh
[1:07:34] was was uh was God
[1:07:38] which is all right
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and so much appreciated
[1:07:46] but we cannot draw salvation from what
[1:07:49] they did
[1:07:53] salvation is an individual affair
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; between every person and God,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; not with your not with your with our
[1:08:03] nation,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; with our church,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; but with ourselves before God,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; we answer. Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Every one of us answering before God
[1:08:22] himself.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not a Christian
[1:08:26] because my father is a Christian.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not a Christian
[1:08:32] because my mom took me to church.
[1:08:36] My mom took me to church. It's a
[1:08:38] wonderful thing.
[1:08:40] But I have to have an experience,
[1:08:43] personal experience,
[1:08:46] so that the God of my mother, the God of
[1:08:49] my father may become my God also
[1:08:53] because salvation.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; It's an individual affair
[1:08:58] not with n with
[1:09:02] God is dealing with individuals.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:09:08] So before this uh uh uh dark uh uh paint
[1:09:12] picture that we look at
[1:09:15] as Israel was in sin,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; they were in
[1:09:23] immorality and all kinds of things.
[1:09:28] There were there was a need for a a
[1:09:30] woman, a a widow woman.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; This widow woman that we just read about
[1:09:39] But when I'm saying he must have been of
[1:09:41] the caliber of Elijah,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; she had to had in her
[1:09:50] the qualities that was uh answering to
[1:09:54] the need of what Elijah was talking
[1:09:55] about.
[1:09:57] And we know that the woman is a type of
[1:10:00] the church.
[1:10:02] And the Bible says in Psalm
[1:10:07] One stream call for another stream. The
[1:10:10] the uh the deep
[1:10:13] calling upon another deep
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; before they can be uh deep.
[1:10:22] Before there's a fan in the fish's back,
[1:10:25] they had to be water
[1:10:28] so it can help the fish to swim.
[1:10:32] Otherwise, it wouldn't need a fan.
[1:10:36] God gave the fan.
[1:10:38] So because there was a water,
[1:10:42] so the fan will be used for the water.
[1:10:45] Before there was a tree
[1:10:49] that can grow on earth,
[1:10:52] there had to be an earth that it was
[1:10:55] because if there was no ground, then
[1:10:57] there wouldn't have been no trees.
[1:11:01] That's why when Bam talks about the
[1:11:02] history of the
[1:11:04] It says this boy at school,
[1:11:08] he had the habit of reading razors
[1:11:13] and the the the teacher will talk to the
[1:11:15] parents and let them know.
[1:11:17] It's as though the child is eating a
[1:11:19] razor
[1:11:22] and the mother couldn't find a problem.
[1:11:25] But then a moment ago,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; the the mother found her
[1:11:32] eating the the bicycle tires
[1:11:36] and then the mother was uh in in
[1:11:38] inquiry.
[1:11:41] There's something that's not going
[1:11:42] right.
[1:11:44] She took the son to the hospital.
[1:11:47] And when they did the testing,
[1:11:50] they found out
[1:11:52] that within the body of the boy,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; there was a need for sulfur.
[1:11:58] And to find sulfur,
[1:12:02] the child was finding it in the razors,
[1:12:06] in the razors
[1:12:09] or in the the bicycle tires.
[1:12:13] And he had that desire within him.
[1:12:16] And they had to be a deed
[1:12:19] to answer to that deed.
[1:12:22] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So before they could be a creation,
[1:12:29] they had to be a creator somewhere
[1:12:32] so he can bring the creation into.
[1:12:35] So if you have in you a desire
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; or the power the need for the the the
[1:12:43] healing divine,
[1:12:45] there had to be a fountain somewhere,
[1:12:48] an open fountain somewhere
[1:12:52] that can answer to that that deep.
[1:12:57] Elijah Elijah was sent to this woman.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; This woman was in difficulties.
[1:13:04] So was she was a widow woman
[1:13:07] but she was a believer.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; She had the quality
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; to receive
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God.
[1:13:17] If she didn't have those qualities
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:21] God was not going to send him to that
[1:13:23] place.
[1:13:25] And I believe to receive a prophet
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; is to say amen to everything that the
[1:13:32] prophet said
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; and you will receive the recompense of
[1:13:37] the prophet
[1:13:39] said.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; What is the recompense of a prophet?
[1:13:43] Jesus said
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; that he that receiveth a prophet
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and as a prophet
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; shall receive the recompense of a
[1:13:55] prophet
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and the recompense of the prophet
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; is to be a friend of a prophet
[1:14:03] and I believe tonight
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I am speaking to the friends of the
[1:14:08] prophet
[1:14:10] on you don't you don't hurt your
[1:14:12] friends.
[1:14:14] This woman,
[1:14:17] she was of the caliber of Elijah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; She was a friend of a prophet.
[1:14:24] And when sin came,
[1:14:27] the sin had had encompassed the whole
[1:14:29] country
[1:14:31] and there was great difficulties in the
[1:14:34] land. This woman,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; she was waiting upon God.
[1:14:42] You have to receive a prophet
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; is a prophet that would stand against
[1:14:50] defy the things of the world.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; God only speaks through the prophet not
[1:14:58] through the pastor, not through the
[1:15:00] preacher.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; It speaks through the prophet.
[1:15:05] What says in uh the circle we would see
[1:15:08] Jesus?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; It says now
[1:15:12] We we we we we we
[1:15:15] see that the prophet of the Old
[1:15:17] Testament,
[1:15:21] God has always brought his people
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; to believe his prophets.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; We know that,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; don't we?
[1:15:32] Because the Bible says
[1:15:35] that the word of God
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; the word which is you which was God
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; came to the prophets.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; came to the prophets.
[1:15:51] The word of the Lord
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; came to Jeremiah.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord
[1:15:59] came to Moses.
[1:16:01] The word of the Lord
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; came different ways through the prophet
[1:16:09] was the one who had the word of God
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and they
[1:16:16] by having it.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; They manifested it. See,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; they manifested it
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; because it came to them.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; They had it.
[1:16:30] They spoke it
[1:16:34] told exactly what would happen
[1:16:37] and it happened
[1:16:40] and that's the way
[1:16:45] that's the way they knew that there were
[1:16:47] prophets.
[1:16:49] Now you get it. See
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; the word come to the prophet
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; portion
[1:16:57] not all of it
[1:17:00] just part of it
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; will come to the prophet
[1:17:06] he would express it exactly
[1:17:09] what the word was
[1:17:12] and it happened just the way they said
[1:17:14] it just said the way they said it that's
[1:17:19] why we thank the Lord
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] Because God sent us a prophet.
[1:17:24] If Bernham didn't come,
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be gathering here.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet
[1:17:32] and we are a privileged people
[1:17:35] because with a prophet,
[1:17:38] we know the mind of God for our
[1:17:41] generation.
[1:17:44] What does God wants us to do?
[1:17:47] How do we supposed to walk?
[1:17:50] How are we going to serve him?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; We receive all of that.
[1:17:55] Because the prophet said it.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God thinks the prophet speaks.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And we say amen to that.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Because it's the will of God.
[1:18:08] He always speaks through the prophet
[1:18:11] in the feast of trumpet.
[1:18:14] says in paragraph uh 107,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; no
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; 87,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and now
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; these things,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 and all of this
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; and Hebrews 13:8,
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:18:36] and forever.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; He remains forever. The word
[1:18:42] manifest,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; the word made manifest.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he declared. The
[1:18:50] what declared the prophet a prophet
[1:18:55] doesn't only mean seer
[1:18:59] or forteller.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It means
[1:19:03] a revealer
[1:19:07] of the word that's written in his own
[1:19:10] life.
[1:19:13] His own works reveal
[1:19:18] and vindicates the word of that day.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; For example,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; let Noah build an ark.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Moses down there,
[1:19:30] whatever more
[1:19:33] and he promised the promised word for
[1:19:35] that hour.
[1:19:38] So the entire responsibility
[1:19:42] of the revelation of the written word
[1:19:46] the Bible the written word
[1:19:49] is not given to a religious leader.
[1:19:54] It's not given to a a a legal authority.
[1:19:58] It's not given to a priest. It's not
[1:20:01] given to a pastor. It's not given to a
[1:20:03] doctor.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; It's given to a prophet.
[1:20:09] You have to be certain of that.
[1:20:12] That's why when you think about leaving
[1:20:14] the prophet,
[1:20:16] we are going to stay with the prophet
[1:20:20] because we are slaves to the word of
[1:20:22] God.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Because the life of the prophet
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; by the works of the prophet
[1:20:30] the word for that hour is revealed
[1:20:34] and is confirmed vindicated.
[1:20:38] contradict the prophet.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot contradict the
[1:20:41] prophet.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You can't say made a mistake here.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; no.
[1:20:49] Says in the feast of the trumpet now.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; We know that he's with us. We believe
[1:20:57] that.
[1:20:59] Do you believe that Jesus is with us?
[1:21:03] He said, "Where two or three are
[1:21:04] gathered in my midst,
[1:21:06] I'm in the midst.
[1:21:08] as we are speaking, he's here with us
[1:21:11] tonight.
[1:21:13] We know that he's with us
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; because a man cannot gather all the
[1:21:19] people that are gathered here.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; It takes God himself
[1:21:26] so he can gather men and women.
[1:21:30] We know that he's with us.
[1:21:32] We know that he's walking with us.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And we can speak like David.
[1:21:38] Even if I walk
[1:21:40] in the shadow of the shadow,
[1:21:43] I will not fear death because thou are
[1:21:46] with me.
[1:21:48] And he promised, I'll be with you,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; even in you until the end of time.
[1:21:55] We believe that he's with us.
[1:21:57] We believe that
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; you see his word
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; made manifest
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; by photographs
[1:22:08] by by scriptures
[1:22:12] by declarations in heaven on earth.
[1:22:17] Everything else that he says
[1:22:20] not one time has it failed.
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:25] I ask any person to show me different
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; from the different parts of the country
[1:22:33] or all over the world.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; You are you are obligated
[1:22:39] to write me and tell me
[1:22:42] whether one time it ever failed
[1:22:46] it perfect
[1:22:48] word by word.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Now that's a promise.
[1:22:55] That has to bring us to certainty
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; because it's perfect.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; This message is perfect.
[1:23:04] We don't need to add anything to it. We
[1:23:07] don't have to take away anything from
[1:23:08] it. We don't need to interpret itself
[1:23:13] interpret his word by bringing it to
[1:23:16] pass. It's perfect.
[1:23:19] Word taught by word.
[1:23:22] As the word is perfect
[1:23:25] and we receive a perfect man,
[1:23:28] we will become perfect people because
[1:23:31] this word will bring us
[1:23:34] to the statue of the perfect man.
[1:23:38] We will not become perfect
[1:23:40] when we'll be in the grave. But we are
[1:23:43] perfect in walking in this church. I am
[1:23:47] speaking to perfect people. I'm speaking
[1:23:50] to perfect women because we have
[1:23:53] received
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; a perfect word
[1:23:57] by word.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's why we are not going into
[1:24:02] uncertainty.
[1:24:04] Be certain
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; regardless of what people are saying
[1:24:11] on the social media
[1:24:14] where people are trying to enticing
[1:24:16] learn
[1:24:18] trying to put doubts in people's hearts.
[1:24:22] We believe the message
[1:24:25] with everything within us.
[1:24:28] We we know what the message has done for
[1:24:30] us.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; We know where we were.
[1:24:34] And we know what the word has done for
[1:24:36] us.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And this message will bring us
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; until the perfection
[1:24:43] into the rapture.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; The message that we have received.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It's this message that will rapture us.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to be certain of God.
[1:24:55] But says
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; the the only way the the only way that
[1:25:03] I'm told
[1:25:08] in the message Luke unto Jesus that this
[1:25:10] little bird ever had a chance
[1:25:15] is to get his eyes off of the serpent.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; When the serpent is trying to catch a
[1:25:23] bird,
[1:25:27] You see the serpent is turning his eyes
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; because when the bird is distracted,
[1:25:35] he's looking at the the the the what's
[1:25:37] happening,
[1:25:41] the the bird doesn't know that the
[1:25:43] serpent is coming is moving in little by
[1:25:45] little.
[1:25:47] But the only way for that bird to escape
[1:25:50] is for him to flap the wings and to fly
[1:25:54] away.
[1:25:55] But what I'm saying,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; it says um uh uh flap your wings by
[1:26:02] prayer
[1:26:07] until you fly plummet right out of the
[1:26:10] world.
[1:26:11] and all of off of his griefs.
[1:26:16] It was telling you, we will say
[1:26:19] that that there's no such thing uh as
[1:26:22] the healing divine divine healing. He
[1:26:25] says, "Shake your head
[1:26:28] and and and and run away from him
[1:26:30] quickly.
[1:26:34] If he should tell you that spiritual
[1:26:35] discernment is telepathy,
[1:26:38] shake your head
[1:26:40] from him and immediately move.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Look up unto the unseen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; That's our prayer tonight.
[1:26:51] This woman was a a widow woman.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what a widow woman could be
[1:26:58] enduring, what she could be going
[1:26:59] through.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; The husband had died.
[1:27:04] She had a little boy.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; The the the the survival was based upon
[1:27:12] whatever else they could they can gather
[1:27:14] together.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; But because of the the sin and the
[1:27:19] immorality that was in the land
[1:27:23] that there was just a dry time where
[1:27:26] everything came in the country,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; they were all uh hungry and dying.
[1:27:33] And today in the spiritual ramific
[1:27:50] the the the meal in the in the in the
[1:27:53] vase was kept going down
[1:27:55] was kept going down
[1:27:58] and finally
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; it was just a
[1:28:02] a a a scoop left.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; It was just a little spoon of oil
[1:28:10] and the time was coming,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; it was the end that was coming for her.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And says
[1:28:19] that when you have confessed all your
[1:28:21] sins
[1:28:24] and you have satisfied to everything
[1:28:26] that God is requiring.
[1:28:30] And he said even after that God remained
[1:28:32] silent.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Remember
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; that the faith declares that he exists
[1:28:41] and your faith has to hold on to that
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and the faith will bring down something
[1:28:48] into existence. Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:52] But says in the message, if God be with
[1:28:54] us,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; uh, where are all the miracles?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 42,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; it says, now
[1:29:02] we found out, we we find out
[1:29:07] that when God's people get in trouble,
[1:29:12] now I don't know what kind of trouble
[1:29:13] you are in.
[1:29:16] I don't know what challenge you are
[1:29:17] facing.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know your problems.
[1:29:21] said,
[1:29:23] "When God's people gets in trouble,
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; God always sends them a prophet
[1:29:34] with a true word to bring them out."
[1:29:39] Is there anybody with trouble tonight?
[1:29:41] I'm one of them.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; But God has promised us that when the
[1:29:47] people of God are in trouble,
[1:29:52] God always sends them a prophet,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; a prophet
[1:29:56] with a true word of God
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; to bring them out
[1:30:02] of those.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; It says it's never been a time that
[1:30:08] God's people ever
[1:30:10] gets in trouble
[1:30:13] unless God send them his word.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And his word, as we at the end this
[1:30:19] morning, comes to the prophet.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; And all that we need
[1:30:25] from the new birth until the glory,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; it's it's found in the word of God.
[1:30:33] The the the healing of the sickness is
[1:30:35] in the word. The salvation of our soul
[1:30:39] is in the word.
[1:30:41] The transformation of our lives is in
[1:30:43] the word.
[1:30:45] Everything is in the word.
[1:30:48] It's the word that created in the
[1:30:49] beginning. That word is able
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; to continue to create.
[1:30:55] Wherefore, whatever need you have.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; When the people of God are in trouble,
[1:31:03] God always sends them a prophet
[1:31:06] with a true word of God
[1:31:09] to get them out of those troubles.
[1:31:15] That's why we thank God for a prophet.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, if William Brham didn't come,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; we need a prophet.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Look at Elijah.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; When Israel was in trouble,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; when they were even worshiping the God
[1:31:35] of Baal,
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Elijah came,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; he was a prophet.
[1:31:44] He had to come and get the people of God
[1:31:46] out of that trouble.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; He called everybody on the Mount Ko.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He start he let them start the prayer.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon your God.
[1:32:00] The God that will answer by fire.
[1:32:04] It will be the real God."
[1:32:07] Elijah was certain of his God.
[1:32:10] He came.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; He was in He was in peace.
[1:32:16] He let them worship.
[1:32:18] He let them pray
[1:32:21] from from the morning all the day long
[1:32:24] until the evening time. Elijah said,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; it says maybe your God is traing.
[1:32:34] You cried out.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't respond.
[1:32:38] Now it's my time.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; I will also worship.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; When you are certain of God,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; something has to happen. Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Even at the end,
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; when everything looks like it's
[1:32:57] finished,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; is a something in your heart that tells
[1:33:04] you.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I know in whom I have believed,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I know that he's able
[1:33:13] even at the last second,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; he will come to intervene.
[1:33:19] When the three Hebrew children,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; they were ready to be put in the fire,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; they were certain of their God.
[1:33:28] He said, "We will not worship."
[1:33:32] Even if God doesn't uh save us,
[1:33:36] we will not worship.
[1:33:41] And as they were getting ready to be put
[1:33:43] in the furnace,
[1:33:46] even before the first foot can be put in
[1:33:49] the fire,
[1:33:51] God was already in the fire.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Don't go backwards.
[1:33:59] Don't doubt.
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:02] Even at the last second, he will come
[1:34:05] down.
[1:34:08] and he will come down and he will take
[1:34:10] the fire away from the situation and the
[1:34:13] people will be surprised. But why is he
[1:34:16] happy?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; The God of inh rapid innovation.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; He's coming into action. Elijah came.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh God of Abraham,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; God of Israel,
[1:34:34] he didn't call him the God of Jacob.
[1:34:39] He called him by the name of the prince
[1:34:41] of Israel
[1:34:43] that they may know today
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; that you are God
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; and that I am your prophet
[1:34:52] when he talked like this
[1:34:54] something
[1:34:56] the fire came down
[1:34:59] he he didn't make any effort
[1:35:02] you won't have any effort to make
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; when you have confidence confidence in
[1:35:07] God.
[1:35:08] When you are sure that he's there,
[1:35:12] when you have confidence in him, even at
[1:35:15] the last second,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; he will intervene.
[1:35:21] When the people of God are in trouble,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; God will always send a prophet.
[1:35:31] It means that Malachi 4 came
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; to get us out of the trouble.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; We are in trouble.
[1:35:48] We are because we are in trouble.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet.
[1:35:55] The prophet comes
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; to get out out of the the trouble,
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; whatever trouble,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; whatever problem,
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; there's nothing. There's no exception
[1:36:10] that it may be hunger,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; that it may be uh uh barness,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; God is able
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; to make sure that you can have
[1:36:24] that in my house there will not be a
[1:36:26] barrier.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That he may be you without a trouble.
[1:36:32] God,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; he knows where the trouble is.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He can I may be delivered. that it may
[1:36:37] be that I'm
[1:36:40] you can fill up the list of what
[1:36:43] a prophet comes
[1:36:46] the blessing is full
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and you judge a people
[1:36:55] by the strength of the prophet
[1:36:58] and Malachi 4
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; is a prophet above all the other prophet
[1:37:05] he came gather up everything.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; All that was said in the Old Testament,
[1:37:12] all that was said in the New Testament.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; They like the church at the end time.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; They have the fullness of the word of
[1:37:24] God.
[1:37:26] We have received
[1:37:28] the fullness of the word of God.
[1:37:31] All the word of God has been revealed.
[1:37:35] No secret.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; There is no secret
[1:37:42] say somewhere
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; when Jesus was on earth,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; he was the shadow of things to come.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And those things to come was us,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; the mal the messenger of Malachi for
[1:38:02] he comes to tie all the loose ends.
[1:38:06] And then the power,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; the omnipotence
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; is found in this message.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; This message,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; it possesses the power of the dynamic of
[1:38:21] the Holy Spirit.
[1:38:23] That power is here right now
[1:38:28] to return everything that the devil has
[1:38:31] stole from you.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That power is here.
[1:38:36] to restitute everything that was taken
[1:38:39] out. That power is here,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; to reestablish all the organs that are
[1:38:47] not working to heal you to take care of
[1:38:51] you,
[1:38:53] to take care of you today.
[1:38:57] days in the true church.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; There's so much power
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; to to fix all the things that are not
[1:39:06] right in the body.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; That's you believe that
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; the power is in the message.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; But Ram says,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; forgive me.
[1:39:29] speaks of this uh boy from Finland.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; This boy from Finland was hit by a car
[1:39:39] and he was broken into pieces.
[1:39:46] But there was so much power in William
[1:39:48] Brham
[1:39:52] prayed for this child's
[1:39:55] anesthesia
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; without the need for
[1:39:59] anesthesia.
[1:40:00] Some without any the blood transfusion
[1:40:04] or anything
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:07] the body of the boy came back all
[1:40:09] together.
[1:40:13] That power is in the church today.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; What God can do with us
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; is unlimited.
[1:40:28] There is no limit to what God can do
[1:40:30] with you.
[1:40:33] As you have received the word,
[1:40:36] there is an energies that are coming
[1:40:38] forth.
[1:40:41] coming off of the spoken word
[1:40:44] and the spoken word
[1:40:47] is always there to create
[1:40:50] and like the same way it was in the
[1:40:52] beginning.
[1:40:55] It could create a new nature in you.
[1:40:58] It can create cells that are there
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; where your problem
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; is so little
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; and see so insignificant omnipotence
[1:41:10] of the in in front of the omnipotence of
[1:41:13] the word of God
[1:41:15] that can heal you where you are sitting
[1:41:17] right now.
[1:41:19] You don't even need for somebody to lay
[1:41:21] hand
[1:41:23] but to by saying amen to the word. God
[1:41:26] can heal you. God can transform you. And
[1:41:30] as you go out of here, you are not the
[1:41:33] same person anymore that you were when
[1:41:35] you came in.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; That's my prayer.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; That the sickness
[1:41:43] that there's trouble,
[1:41:45] whatever the problem that took time,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; stay here
[1:41:51] that you go out of here
[1:41:55] freed.
[1:41:58] Because we not come to church as a
[1:41:59] picnic.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; We come here for the deliverance of a
[1:42:05] people.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; You have to be delivered
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; because the word of deliverance
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; is already spoken.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; The ma the messenger of Malachi 4.
[1:42:21] It's the totality or the entirety of the
[1:42:24] word.
[1:42:25] It's the totality of the powertality.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; It's the totality of deliverance.
[1:42:32] It's the spirit without measure
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; that is in the church today
[1:42:41] said
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; in the feast of the trumpet
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit was bound by the
[1:42:50] floods of denomination
[1:42:53] for 2,000 years.
[1:42:56] But at the evening time in the
[1:42:57] afternoon,
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; he has to be free
[1:43:02] by the message of the end time,
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; the new Holy Spirit
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; in the church,
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Christ himself,
[1:43:13] revealing the human flesh in the end
[1:43:16] time.
[1:43:17] He said,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; he promised
[1:43:22] and we believe in the opening
[1:43:25] of the entire word.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; If the word
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; was was uh uh loosed by the Holy Spirit,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; how what how much more my problem?
[1:43:40] My problem means nothing
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; because the word has already been
[1:43:45] spoken.
[1:43:47] The totality of the word
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; to do today Jesus has changed the form
[1:43:54] is today Jesus has your faith
[1:43:58] the the form of Jesus in the end time is
[1:44:02] the brother that's sitting here in the
[1:44:03] front. It's my sister sitting here today
[1:44:07] and I see what's happening today.
[1:44:11] It's Jesus preaching the word
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; and translating or interpreting the
[1:44:17] word.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus saying amen to the word and
[1:44:21] something has to happen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Something has to happen. Do you believe
[1:44:28] that?
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; There never been a time
[1:44:36] where the people of God has been in
[1:44:38] trouble.
[1:44:40] without God sending them a prophet.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; When we have trouble,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; God sends a prophet.
[1:44:57] When the prophet is there, no one can go
[1:44:59] back a slave.
[1:45:05] You have to doubt your own doubts.
[1:45:13] This message is a message of jubilee.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; This message brings freedom.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; This message will break all the bounds.
[1:45:28] and you believe it with all your heart
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and you are certain of God,
[1:45:35] all the bounds, all everything will
[1:45:37] break.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; It's not your effort.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It's the work of God
[1:45:46] like what Bill was saying this morning
[1:45:49] when he took the example of the brother,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; the brother had nothing to do with it.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; He stands there.
[1:45:57] But the one who had the inspiration
[1:46:00] of the original image is the one that
[1:46:03] has to do the work. So that the block of
[1:46:06] stones
[1:46:08] will become the image that was in the
[1:46:10] beginning.
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:12] All the work is done by the message.
[1:46:15] Just receive the message. Just receive
[1:46:18] the message. Just accept the message.
[1:46:23] There's so much power in the message
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; to bring us to the transformation.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Eat the book.
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Take the book that's open.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not a closed book.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; The book has been open.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:46:42] Eat it and swallow it
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; and sp speak it and prophesy.
[1:46:48] You yourself say,
[1:46:50] "I am no longer a slave.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I am no longer a slave of pornography.
[1:46:58] I'm no longer a slave of of drunkenness.
[1:47:01] I am no longer a slave of things of the
[1:47:03] world."
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet has come
[1:47:07] to take me out of my trouble.
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:12] When the people are in trouble,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; God sends a prophet.
[1:47:17] Thank you, Lord, for a prophet.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Look at Israel
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; in Exodus chapter 3.
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go there to to to close up.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Exod Exodus 3:6,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Israel was in trouble.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Israel had trouble.
[1:47:46] They were slaves to the Egyptians.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; God picks a man,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; prophet,
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; a prophet,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; and he says in verse six,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; "I am the God of your fathers,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[1:48:06] and the God of Jacob."
[1:48:09] And Moses hid his face,
[1:48:13] for he was afraid to look upon God.
[1:48:18] And the Lord said,
[1:48:22] "I have surely seen the affliction of my
[1:48:24] people."
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, I have seen the trouble
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; which are in in Egypt
[1:48:34] and I have heard the cry
[1:48:37] by reason of the task masters.
[1:48:40] For I know their sorrow.
[1:48:44] Brother, nothing can come to you without
[1:48:47] God knows about it.
[1:48:50] Everything by which we walk, he sees it.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; And he's waiting for the time and the
[1:48:56] moment.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I heard the cry.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; When you cry out, he hears.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; When you suffer, he sees."
[1:49:09] And then he says,
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; "I am come down
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; to deliver them
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; out of the hands of the Egyptians
[1:49:20] and to bring them up
[1:49:22] out
[1:49:24] of a land unto good land, and a large
[1:49:28] land,
[1:49:30] unto the land that flowth milk and
[1:49:32] honey,
[1:49:34] unto the place of the Canaanites, the
[1:49:36] Hzites, the Amorites,
[1:49:39] the parasites, the appetites, and the
[1:49:42] jebites,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; the prophet came
[1:49:47] to take us into that land.
[1:49:49] He says, now
[1:49:53] and and now therefore, behold, the cry
[1:49:55] of the children of Israel has come unto
[1:49:57] me,
[1:49:59] and I have also seen the oppression,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; where with the Egyptian oppressed them.
[1:50:05] Now
[1:50:07] come therefore now go.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It says I will send thee
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; unto Pharaoh
[1:50:16] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[1:50:18] the children of Israel out of Egypt.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Moses said unto God, "Who am I
[1:50:26] that I should go unto Pharaoh
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; that I should uh bring forth the
[1:50:31] children of Israel out of Egypt?"
[1:50:34] God said,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; "Certainly I will be with thee,
[1:50:40] and this will be a token unto thee
[1:50:43] that I have sent thee
[1:50:47] when thou has brought forth the people
[1:50:49] out of Egypt,
[1:50:51] and you shall serve God upon this
[1:50:53] mountain."
[1:50:55] So mo the arrival of Moses
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; was the presence of God
[1:51:02] in the pres in the form of a man.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He was the the strong hand of God
[1:51:10] that God promised unto Abraham.
[1:51:14] God took the form of Moses
[1:51:18] to go and deliver Israel out of Egypt.
[1:51:23] The children of Israel could not get out
[1:51:25] of Egypt by themselves.
[1:51:27] But for them to get out of Egypt,
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; God had to be a human being.
[1:51:33] So when Moses was walking,
[1:51:36] it was God that was going forth
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; to deliver his people.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Today we are the people of God.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; You and you and I.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; We are in trouble.
[1:51:51] God doesn't change his pattern.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Whatever he did yesterday, he will do
[1:51:56] today.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; If he healed yesterday, he will heal
[1:52:00] today.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; If he delivered yesterday, he will heal
[1:52:03] deliver today.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; If he sent a prophet yesterday to
[1:52:08] deliver today, he will send a prophet to
[1:52:12] deliver the people today.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And we believe that he took a a quote
[1:52:20] William,
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; William Marian Brham,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; it was a coat of God.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; But says that the the the the
[1:52:34] the
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4, the ministry,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; it's the it's it's God dressear.
[1:52:46] If the the the the the Ephesians 4 are
[1:52:49] the the dressear of God,
[1:52:52] how much more the messenger himself, the
[1:52:55] prophet
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; to whom the word comes to
[1:53:01] because the says the light,
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; it comes to a certain region.
[1:53:07] It comes first to the prophet
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; and from the prophet
[1:53:13] light will spread forth
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; to the ministries
[1:53:18] that were taught uh faithfully
[1:53:22] and then from the ministry
[1:53:25] light will go unto the people
[1:53:29] if the Ephesians 4
[1:53:32] they are the anointed dressear of God
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; then the messenger prophet
[1:53:38] is also the anointed dress of God.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; He was the dress wearer of God, William
[1:53:46] Brham. And when he came with a message
[1:53:52] because the messenger and the message is
[1:53:54] one and the same
[1:53:57] is to take us from trouble.
[1:54:01] Whatever we have need of
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; is in the message. Deliverance.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Deliverance is in the message.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; The salvation is in the message.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; The change is in the message.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Blessings is in the message.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Everything is in the message.
[1:54:21] It's not William Brham and men that we
[1:54:23] talking about tonight.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the manifestation
[1:54:30] of the son of man. But what I'm saying,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; we are feeding off of the body word of
[1:54:37] the son of man,
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; not of a son of man,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; but the son of man.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:53] I want you to know that it's certain.
[1:55:00] I want you to know that this is sure.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt to that.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; And you that are listening to this tape,
[1:55:15] you may have thought today
[1:55:19] that I was trying to say that about
[1:55:21] myself
[1:55:24] being that I was the one that was was
[1:55:27] the one pecking this message.
[1:55:31] I have no more to do with that than
[1:55:33] nothing.
[1:55:36] I'm just a voice,
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; nothing more.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; And my voice even against my own better
[1:55:45] judgment.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a trapper.
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:51] But it's the will of
[1:55:58] what
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; what I it's what I wanted to do.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; I was It says, "But it's a father I
[1:56:10] declare to you and determined to do.
[1:56:14] It's the is the will of my father.
[1:56:20] I wasn't the one that appeared down
[1:56:22] there on the river.
[1:56:24] I was just standing there when he
[1:56:27] appeared.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; When he appeared,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performed these
[1:56:33] things.
[1:56:35] I tell these things that happened
[1:56:38] as perfect as they are.
[1:56:41] I'm only the one
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; that's near
[1:56:45] when he does it.
[1:56:49] I was I was only a voice
[1:56:53] that he used to say it.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't what I knew.
[1:56:59] It was it was
[1:57:02] it was just that I surrendered myself to
[1:57:06] that he spoke through me. He spoke
[1:57:08] through.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; It isn't me.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the seventh angel.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Oh no. manifest
[1:57:19] the manifestation of the son of man.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel, his message.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; It was the mystery that God unfolded.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God.
[1:57:34] The angel was not the son of man.
[1:57:38] He was the messenger from the son of
[1:57:40] man. The son of man is Christ.
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:46] is the only one that you are feeding on.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You are not feeding on a man, a man,
[1:57:55] his word will fail,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; but you are feeding
[1:58:00] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:58:03] man. Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; As we are feeding on that,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; every one of our situations
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; is already under control.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Deliverance is on the way.
[1:58:21] Even if you don't see anything today,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; but know
[1:58:27] as you believe this message,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; the situation is under control.
[1:58:34] When we believe
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; and we are certain of God,
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; all things work together for good for
[1:58:43] them that love him.
[1:58:46] that difficult situation,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; God will change it
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; because it it had to be there had to be
[1:58:55] a red sea
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; so there could be a deliverance
[1:59:00] because maybe you lost a job.
[1:59:04] Maybe you lost a promotion.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; But know that God will transform that
[1:59:11] lost
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; in gain.
[1:59:15] It's a certainty
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; because God doesn't have a pro a a a
[1:59:22] project to hurt you. He doesn't have the
[1:59:24] need to hurt you.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; But God's uh uh desire for you is
[1:59:29] blessings.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; I want to try you just attract your
[1:59:34] attention tonight.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Be certain of God. Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Be certain that this message is the
[1:59:44] truth.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; And you will know the truth
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; and the truth will set you free.
[1:59:55] Be certain of God
[1:59:58] regardless of what you're going through.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Don't go backwards.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Go forward.
[2:00:06] The God who called you
[2:00:09] is just and faithful,
[2:00:15] he has decided to keep that which he has
[2:00:17] placed in you
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; until the day of your redemption.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I ask you to stand at this time.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray.
[2:00:31] Amazing
[2:00:38] grace

[2:01:23] my fault and exalt
[2:01:28] my name.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; I shall forever

[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; You said to us tonight
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; to be certain of you, Lord.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; And you are your word
[2:04:45] that was that was manifested in this end
[2:04:47] time.

[2:05:14] need of

[2:05:18] And when the people of God are in
[2:05:20] trouble,
[2:05:22] God always sends a prophet. You send a
[2:05:25] prophet.
[2:05:28] He said, "I have given you all the the
[2:05:30] advices of that I give regardless of
[2:05:33] what happened.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Stay with the message

[2:07:46] [Music]
[2:07:51] Wonderful. God bless you. Good job,
[2:07:53] brother. Amen. What an effort. Amen. I
[2:07:56] appreciate that. Amen.
[2:07:59] Amen. He made a distinction there.
[2:08:06] um having heard many times
[2:08:10] brother Bram talked about the angel of
[2:08:12] the Lord
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; and how he saw him and brother Billy
[2:08:17] Paul got to see him laying in bed
[2:08:19] standing in the corner of the room
[2:08:24] how he described him being a a dark
[2:08:27] complexed man at about 200 lb hair
[2:08:30] length or to his shoulder length hair or
[2:08:32] So
[2:08:34] that was different
[2:08:37] than who he saw in the sage grass field.
[2:08:41] And he called him Jesus. And he said,
[2:08:42] "He turned and looked at me."
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's who he's referring to. He is God.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; The working that he did, the
[2:08:53] association, brother, he said, "I come
[2:08:54] from the presence of God and I" He gave
[2:08:56] him his commission. That was an angel of
[2:08:59] the Lord there. But there was the angel
[2:09:01] of the Lord. the Lord himself.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; We don't pack around an angel of the
[2:09:06] Lord. We pack around the Lord Jesus
[2:09:08] Christ. And I think our brother is
[2:09:10] getting to the point is be certain of
[2:09:12] what you're standing for. This message
[2:09:15] is not based on just a man with a
[2:09:18] knowledge of scripture. He came
[2:09:20] revealing the God of the scripture and
[2:09:23] that's who we have. Amen. Let's sing
[2:09:25] that little course. He's coming soon.

[2:09:28] returning.

[2:09:32] coming
[2:09:34] soon.

[2:09:39] soon.
[2:09:41] With joy,

[2:11:03] It may be night or day.

[2:11:09] he's coming
[2:11:12] soon.
[2:11:14] Amen. Let's sing one more. I'm bound for
[2:11:17] the promised land. Amen.
[2:11:20] Amen. We're about to cross over, saints.
[2:11:23] Amen.

[2:13:08] winds norless
[2:13:11] can reach the healthful shore.
[2:13:18] Sickness and sorrow,
[2:13:22] pain and death are feeling

[2:13:29] together. I am bound for the proise
[2:13:34] man.
