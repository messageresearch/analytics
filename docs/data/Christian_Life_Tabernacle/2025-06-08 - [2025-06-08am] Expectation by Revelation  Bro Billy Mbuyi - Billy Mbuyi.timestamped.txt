[22:19] We love you, Lord. We give you glory. We
[22:22] give you honor. Hey, you can do better
[22:25] than
[22:27] that. We're talking about the lion has
[22:30] prevailed to take the book. We ain't
[22:33] worshiping a dead god. We're worshiping
[22:36] a risen living savior who has taken the
[22:38] book. Not only did he take the book,
[22:40] he's descended and he said, "Come eat."
[22:43] Oh, hallelujah. I don't know about you,
[22:44] but I'm I'm excited for the word. My We
[22:47] should just move right into the
[22:48] preaching, but we have a little bit of
[22:50] order to take care of. So, you can have
[22:52] your seats. we'll just uh take up the
[22:54] tithes and the offerings. And uh also we
[22:57] have a if you can just place something
[22:58] softly, that'd be nice. We do have a
[23:00] little um request here. If you just want
[23:02] to check the lost and found table uh in
[23:05] the fellowship hall just to see if
[23:07] anything belongs to you or your children
[23:09] or family.
[23:11] Um now just don't go in there and just
[23:14] take something you
[23:16] want lost. If you lost something, it
[23:18] might be there for you to retrieve. So
[23:21] just go in there. We do have a uh a
[23:24] prayer request. Uh Sister Zoe Loya wants
[23:28] a prayer for the grandson of Karen
[23:31] Moore. When uh he was born, he didn't
[23:34] breathe for 3 minutes.
[23:36] So there's nothing impossible for our
[23:39] God. So we'll just pray that the Lord
[23:42] would just undertake on this behalf.
[23:46] And we know God's a God of the
[23:48] impossible. We don't know if there's any
[23:51] side effects, but we do know we serve a
[23:53] a risen savior. I'll just ask brother
[23:55] Matt Thomasac to come and pray over the
[23:58] tithes and the
[24:00] offerings and uh just take this request.
[24:03] Do you have a maybe an unspoken prayer
[24:05] request just by an uplifted hand you
[24:07] want to make known to the Lord? He sees
[24:10] that he's a high priest who's touched by
[24:12] the feeling of your infirmity.
[24:15] Why don't we all just go ahead and stand
[24:16] with brother Matt as he goes before the
[24:19] Lord on these requests.
[24:24] Let's
[24:26] pray. Father God, we're
[24:29] just so grateful, Lord, that we could
[24:31] gather together in your
[24:33] name. For you've given us a promise that
[24:36] if two or three would gather together in
[24:39] your name, you'd be in the midst. And
[24:42] Lord, where you are is life. where you
[24:44] are as all of your
[24:46] attributes. Lord, we call upon you
[24:48] tonight, this morning. I
[24:52] mean, as the
[24:54] almighty, the allsufficient God. Lord, I
[24:58] pray that you would go to the young
[24:59] baby, Lord, even right now, and touch
[25:02] it, Lord, and make it completely whole.
[25:05] Lord,
[25:07] we have been told that we have not
[25:10] because we asked not. But Lord, we're
[25:11] all here standing, believing and asking
[25:14] that you would touch that baby, that
[25:16] there would be no damage, no side
[25:18] effects, no no sign of anything, Lord.
[25:21] It just be completely normal. Yes. Lord,
[25:24] we just are grateful, Lord, that we have
[25:27] such a great resource in you,
[25:30] Lord. Lord, the Bible says that
[25:35] [Music]
[25:37] Lord,
[25:39] you're a present help in a time of
[25:41] trouble. Yes, he is,
[25:44] Lord. And there's trouble in the land.
[25:46] There's trouble in the
[25:48] hearts. Lord, we commit it all into you,
[25:51] Lord. There are so many hands raised and
[25:54] heavy hearts, Lord God.
[25:56] But we can rejoice because you're in
[25:59] control.
[26:01] We commit the service into your hands.
[26:03] We commit the tithes and offerings,
[26:05] Lord, that all things would be done for
[26:08] your honor and your
[26:11] glory. Lord, we're so grateful that we
[26:13] could fulfill your word this
[26:17] morning. We're looking for the
[26:20] manifestation because we've done our
[26:22] part and we know that you're faithful to
[26:26] do yours. we love you and commit this
[26:29] into your hands. In Jesus Christ's name
[26:30] we pray. Amen.
[26:33] [Music]
[26:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. You may have your
[26:36] seats. We'll just sing this chorus as
[26:38] brother Thiago and the group comes.

[33:24] we're just uh thankful for another gift
[33:26] of God that he has given unto us, unto

[34:45] little guy.
[34:47] Praise the
[34:51] Lord. My isn't he
[34:54] wonderful? Praise the
[34:56] Lord. Amen. And I don't want to belabor
[34:59] the process too much, but I just wanted
[35:02] uh Sister Casey to give a a quick
[35:03] testimony of the name and what it meant
[35:06] to her. It was a a wonderful testimony.
[35:10] Um so when our daughter was born, she
[35:12] had some genetic things that the doctors
[35:14] told us um were very dangerous and that
[35:18] all of our children had a very high
[35:20] chance of getting as well. Um but we've
[35:24] been accepting her healing and
[35:28] she doesn't have any of the symptoms
[35:29] that they said. Um, so praise the Lord
[35:32] when we were praying about having a
[35:34] third child. Um, I felt the devil come
[35:37] back in
[35:38] and lie to us like he does. And I
[35:42] started feeling fear kick in. And so we
[35:43] I went up for prayer and asked for a
[35:45] complete healing of my womb that we
[35:48] would no longer have any more genetic
[35:51] things going on. And I was driving one
[35:53] day a few weeks later and um I felt the
[35:56] Lord come down and say, "Your son's name
[35:58] will be
[35:59] Josiah." And I asked my husband, I said,
[36:02] "Honey, can you look up what the name
[36:04] Josiah means?" And it means God is my
[36:06] healer and my
[36:08] supporter. And um so I looked at him. I
[36:10] said, "Honey, we're going to have a boy
[36:11] and his name's going to be Josiah."
[36:14] Praise the Lord. Why don't you give God
[36:15] glory? Amen.
[36:23] Amen. We'll uh pass them back on. Why
[36:25] don't we just say a little prayer? Also,
[36:27] we like to have the father say a little
[36:29] prayer and dedication over the baby. You
[36:32] know, it's scriptural to bring the
[36:33] little ones to Jesus. Amen. Amen. Go
[36:36] ahead and
[36:38] pray. Lord Jesus, we come before you to
[36:41] dedicate Josiah, Lord, and just have
[36:44] your perfect will in his life. and
[36:47] whatever he does in his life, Lord, just
[36:49] ple please be in it and we dedicate him
[36:52] back to you. We have the Lord. Amen.
[36:55] Amen. Why don't we all just pray
[36:57] together as I lay hands on little
[36:59] Josiah? We commend him to the Lord. Lord
[37:01] Jesus, we're so thankful
[37:03] for this love gift you've given to the
[37:05] Yesy family.
[37:07] Lord, in the very name that you've given
[37:10] to them in whom Jehovah
[37:12] heals, Lord, I pray that not only would
[37:16] it be a physical healing, Lord, but a
[37:20] Lord, a just a tremendous outpouring of
[37:22] your Holy Spirit healing the broken
[37:24] heart and in binding the families
[37:26] together in Christian love and those
[37:28] that they come in contact. Lord, it
[37:30] would just be a great witness of the
[37:31] message of the hour. Lord, may this
[37:34] little one, Josiah, may he just be a
[37:35] great burning light, Father, that he
[37:38] would just draw men unto Jesus Christ,
[37:41] Lord, for you said, "Ye are the light of
[37:43] the world, Lord." So, as you've given
[37:45] this little love gift to the Eski
[37:47] family, Lord, we're giving him back to
[37:49] you, Lord, knowing that he was yours
[37:52] before it was theirs. So, Lord, we
[37:54] believe with all faith that his name was
[37:56] written on the Lamb's book of life
[37:57] before the foundation of the world,
[37:59] Lord, and our faith is going to rest in
[38:01] that word. We know that the enemy would
[38:03] try to send trials, but Lord, we know
[38:06] all things work together for good to
[38:08] those that love and are called according
[38:09] to your purpose. So, we just thank you,
[38:11] Father. We thank you for the tren
[38:12] tremendous testimony and the love
[38:14] divine. And we commit this little Josiah
[38:16] Daniel Yesesky to you in the name of the
[38:18] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the
[38:22] Lord. Hallelujah. God bless
[38:24] you.
[38:27] Amen. Amen. As we just go ahead and
[38:30] change the order of the service, let's
[38:31] just go ahead and stand. I want to sing
[38:34] that song. Uh, Worthy is the
[38:36] Lamb. It's all because of Calvary. Are
[38:39] you looking forward to the word?
[38:43] Amen. I believe we sing that maybe a
[38:47] flat.
[38:50] Okay. Thank you for the
[38:54] cross, Lord. As brother Billy comes,
[38:58] thank you for the
[39:00] [Music]

[39:09] shame in love. You

[39:49] praise. Worthy is the
[39:53] [Applause]

[40:05] you with

[42:10] [Music]
[42:16] Oh, worthy is your
[42:22] name. Oh,
[42:24] [Music]
[42:27] worthy. Amen. Why don't we just bow our
[42:29] heads this
[42:30] morning? Father, truly you are worthy,
[42:33] Lord.
[42:35] And Father, your worthiness cannot even
[42:38] be comprehended, Father. Lord, if we
[42:41] would sum up everything that we are,
[42:43] where we came from, how we got here,
[42:45] Lord, and Father, if it if we'll go back
[42:48] and remember of every wrong that we've
[42:51] ever done, and everything, Lord, and
[42:53] Father, if we can even go back on that
[42:55] day on Revelation chapter 5, and Father,
[42:58] there was no man found worthy, Lord. And
[43:01] that we can look at every man upon the
[43:03] face of the earth and realize that,
[43:05] Father, that we all have done wrong and
[43:07] said wrong. Lord, we are so comforted
[43:10] this morning to know that there's one
[43:11] that's found worthy and that is you,
[43:14] Lord. Father, one that's worthy not only
[43:16] to take our sins away, not only to
[43:19] forgive us for the wrongs that we have
[43:21] done, but one that's worthy to make us
[43:24] what we really supposed to be, Lord.
[43:26] Father, your worthiness extend from the
[43:28] beginning till the end, Lord. And your
[43:31] worthiness comes from the fact that
[43:32] Lord, you have taken us from sins and
[43:35] from trespasses, bone and sin, sheep and
[43:38] iniquity. You've brought us into the
[43:40] kingdom of the lovely God and and you've
[43:43] called us to be sons and daughters to
[43:45] you when we knew, Lord, that we have
[43:47] done wrong. Yet your love was there to
[43:50] rescue us. We want to lift our hands
[43:52] this morning and say thank you, Lord.
[43:54] And we want to give you all the glory
[43:56] and honor, honor in everything that we
[43:58] are. Father, we want to let you know
[43:59] this morning that we love you with all
[44:01] our hearts, Lord. May you be lifted up
[44:04] in our lives. May you guide every
[44:05] footstep, Lord. And Father, everyone
[44:08] that's made an effort to be here in this
[44:10] building this morning. Father, may you
[44:12] just speak a word this morning that will
[44:14] touch their heart. And may something be
[44:17] said, Lord, that would add another
[44:19] revelation upon what they have and
[44:21] encourage them to go out of here and
[44:23] know that our God is a worthy God. This
[44:26] morning we commit everything that we are
[44:28] Lord remembering our pastor and father
[44:30] we ask that you strengthen him Lord and
[44:33] you guide him and you lead him Lord that
[44:35] you just give him rest that he may come
[44:37] back and re rejuvenate and and ready
[44:41] father to continue in the fight. We
[44:43] commit this service over to you. We've
[44:45] sank songs and now we ask that you come
[44:47] and take the bread of life and break it
[44:49] to us in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[44:52] ask these things.
[44:53] Amen. Man, God bless you. Have your
[44:56] seats before we read our scriptures.
[44:58] Amen. How many are glad to be in the
[45:00] house of God this morning?
[45:02] Amen. Amen. I am too. I ask that you um
[45:07] just pray for me. I I woke up uh I
[45:11] believe it was Saturday or Friday or
[45:14] something just puncturing my lungs and
[45:16] it was really painful and and my
[45:18] allergies kicking in and the allergies
[45:21] and everything and and I just told that
[45:23] devil you are a liar. Amen. Well, the
[45:26] word of God will be preached. Amen. and
[45:29] but we're glad to be in the house of God
[45:31] this morning uh uh with just something
[45:34] on our hearts that we'd like to say and
[45:36] and that there will be a blessing to
[45:38] you. Amen. I'm happy to have my
[45:40] brother-in-law is visiting with us from
[45:42] Congo. His name is brother Joel and I if
[45:45] you could just stand. Uh God bless you.
[45:47] It's good to have him with us
[45:50] [Applause]
[45:52] and amen. and he came all the way from
[45:55] Brazville to spend a couple of days with
[45:57] us and we thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[46:00] As it was mentioned, we want to uh just
[46:02] pray for our pastor. You know, how many
[46:04] love brother David? You know, I I just
[46:07] there's not enough good things that
[46:09] could be said about him. And I was just
[46:12] thinking on my heart and I just pray
[46:13] that, you know, the Lord will certainly
[46:17] um be with him in this time of rest. and
[46:20] and I know he's told us here that you
[46:22] know he's just been uh going through a
[46:25] lot both physically and mentally. We
[46:27] pray that this time of rest will
[46:29] certainly just rejuvenate him and and
[46:31] bring him uh you know he carries a lot
[46:34] of burden you know for the people and
[46:36] for us and and I believe in this time
[46:38] it's uh our responsibility to to carry
[46:42] him and you know to pray for him and to
[46:44] continue to support him and you know we
[46:47] pray for him we support him in every
[46:49] manner that we can you know and I'll say
[46:52] this as as just a a church body I was I
[46:56] don't know if I read this quote but I'll
[46:58] read it again and and especially on a
[47:01] Sunday morning I believe we have uh most
[47:03] of our our people here and this is I
[47:06] believe in the message God's uh provided
[47:09] way Barbana will speak and he says um
[47:12] and he's speaking to believers this is
[47:14] after a meeting that we would host and
[47:16] he will speak to the people and he says
[47:19] this go to church every
[47:22] day not once not twice every day Every
[47:26] time the church opens, it says go to
[47:28] church every day. Every day that you
[47:31] can, it said every day that they have
[47:34] service, go attend your church. Be
[47:38] loyal. It says just stand by your
[47:40] church. Stand by your pastor. Help him
[47:44] out with everything you got. Give him
[47:48] spiritual support. Fast and pray for
[47:51] him. Have faith in him. God will lead
[47:55] the church onto that great on that
[47:58] glorious day that we are looking for to
[48:01] come. Just think about that. And that's
[48:04] the secret. I believe I I think
[48:06] sometimes we we are not aware of the
[48:09] victory that lies in unity. Um I I I
[48:14] I've been a lot of places and I've I've
[48:16] seen a lot of
[48:18] churches. There is not a church like our
[48:20] church. That's right. I just want to say
[48:23] that you there is not a church like our
[48:26] church. We are very uniquely built and
[48:31] not by a man. We are built by God and
[48:35] and we need to recognize that we need to
[48:38] know that and and that will make our
[48:40] strength. I was uh looking in my Bible
[48:44] and I was reminded of I believe it's in
[48:46] uh Exodus 17
[48:50] um and it would talk about even Israel
[48:53] in battle and the the if I could just
[48:56] paint the picture for a moment. The
[48:58] picture of the victory of Israel was
[49:02] Moses praying with his end up and on one
[49:05] side there was Aaron that was holding on
[49:08] the other side there was that was
[49:10] holding and down in the valley it was
[49:13] Joshua and Israel defeating the
[49:16] Amalachites.
[49:18] So everybody had a pl part to play.
[49:22] Everybody had a a a a place that they
[49:25] were fitted in, not by a man, by God.
[49:28] And and I want to say this, don't be a
[49:31] stranger in the house of God. This is
[49:33] your house. This is the house of your
[49:36] father. And God has placed you here for
[49:39] a reason. Find something that you can
[49:41] help with. Find something that you can
[49:43] support. You can support with your
[49:45] prayers, with your tithes and offerings,
[49:47] your time, everything. And say, "God,
[49:49] you have called me to this place. I want
[49:52] to know the reason why you have placed
[49:53] me here. I want to be part of that
[49:56] victory p uh uh picture where there's
[49:59] this one doing this and that one doing
[50:01] this and I all fitted and joined
[50:03] together. Let me say this. We are living
[50:06] in a very late hour. It's not time to
[50:09] play games. It's time that everybody is
[50:12] there to try to find the role and what
[50:15] God has called them to do. that when
[50:17] that last day comes, we are found doing
[50:20] what we were supposed to do, doing what
[50:23] we were called to do. And I really pray
[50:25] that you have that on your heart as part
[50:27] of a member of this body to know that
[50:30] I'm here for a reason and I'm here to
[50:32] play my role. There's a lot of help
[50:35] needed. There's a you pray and whatever
[50:37] God places on your heart for you to
[50:39] play, call your pastor and tell him,
[50:41] "Hey, pastor, I have this on my heart to
[50:43] do." He will find a place for you to
[50:46] help and do all of that. Amen. Amen.
[50:50] Let's all stand and just to read our
[50:52] scripture this morning.
[50:55] Amen.
[51:05] Amen. Let's turn in Luke chapter 2.
[51:18] We'll start from verse 25.
[51:33] It says, "And
[51:34] behold, Luke uh the 2 chapter and verse
[51:39] 25, it says, "And behold, there was a
[51:41] man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.
[51:44] And the same man was just and devout,
[51:48] waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[51:51] and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
[51:55] And it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[51:58] Ghost that he should not see death
[52:01] before he had seen the Lord's
[52:05] Christ. And he came to he and he came by
[52:09] the Holy Spirit into the temple. And
[52:12] when the parents brought the children uh
[52:14] the child Jesus to uh to do for him
[52:18] after the custom of the law, then then
[52:22] took him took he him in his arm and
[52:25] blessed God and said, "Lord, now let
[52:29] thou thy servant thy servant depart in
[52:32] peace according to thy word for mine
[52:35] eyes have seen thy salvation." Father,
[52:38] we ask that you bless your word to us in
[52:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[52:42] pray and ask this. Amen. You may have
[52:44] your
[52:46] seats. Amen. I trust you're happy to be
[52:48] in the house of God. Amen. I just want
[52:51] to speak for a moment about uh my title
[52:54] is expectation by
[52:57] revelation. Expectation by revelation.
[53:01] Uh and this came uh as inspiration from
[53:04] what our pastor preached last time. He
[53:07] talked about faith in our promise. faith
[53:10] in our promise. And I was just thinking
[53:12] on those things that he preached. As
[53:14] believers, we know we have a promise. We
[53:17] are gathered this morning as a people of
[53:20] the promise. We are here because there
[53:23] was a promise that God will send a
[53:25] prophet messenger. And through that
[53:27] prophet messenger, the word will be
[53:29] preached. And that word that will be
[53:31] preached will gather forth from all four
[53:34] corners of the earth a people unto the
[53:37] Lord's name. It will be from the east to
[53:39] the west. It will be the word that will
[53:41] go forth by a prophet messenger. It
[53:43] says, "Behold, I will say unto you,
[53:45] Elijah the messenger. He will come for
[53:48] the restoration of the hearts of the
[53:50] children to the fathers." And he came
[53:53] and he preached the word. And I want to
[53:55] say this morning, we cannot do anything
[53:58] outside of the promise. Without the
[54:01] promise, we are nothing. The very
[54:03] definition of who you are is of who we
[54:06] are is because there was a promise that
[54:08] was given. And I want to say this, when
[54:10] you read the word of God every time or
[54:13] when God speaks, God's word is the word
[54:17] of promise.
[54:19] God's word is the word of promise to his
[54:22] his believing children. God has no vain
[54:26] words. God doesn't speak just to speak.
[54:29] Everything that he speaks, he comes to
[54:31] pass. What he speaks, the words of God
[54:34] is the source of life for the believer.
[54:37] The words of God is the source of
[54:39] victory for the believer. Whatever
[54:42] situation you find yourself, that's why
[54:44] the prophet can tell us we have to
[54:46] identify with the word. you that when we
[54:49] find ourselves in a situation that's
[54:51] hard for us that we do not understand as
[54:54] believing children what we need is the
[54:57] word of God that we can stand upon and
[55:00] if we can find a scripture or a word of
[55:03] God that describes somewhat our
[55:05] situation we are being told that if we
[55:08] stand upon that same word God is
[55:10] obligated to bring that word to come to
[55:12] pass so the promise uh our entry point
[55:16] into the kingdom of God. The promise is
[55:20] our entry point in the kingdom is the
[55:22] guarantee for us to have access to the
[55:25] power of God. When you have the word of
[55:28] God, you have the power of God. When you
[55:31] have the word of God, you have the
[55:33] promise of God. And no matter what
[55:35] you're going through, you take the word,
[55:37] you take the promise, the promise will
[55:40] lead you to victory. You take the word,
[55:43] you take the promise, it will provide
[55:45] what God said will it will provide. So
[55:48] we I could say this and it's not the
[55:51] power for us to take and try to conform
[55:54] ourselves to it. No, but the word of God
[55:57] has the power of transformation. The
[56:00] word of God has the ability to take one.
[56:03] It doesn't. In other words, even when
[56:05] the word speaks, it's not so much about
[56:07] the condition that you find yourself in.
[56:10] It's not so much about the condition
[56:12] that you are surrounded by. It's so much
[56:14] that I have received a word that can
[56:17] change the circumstances and bring me
[56:20] into the image of what God has spoken.
[56:23] So when we come this morning, I want to
[56:26] say but what I'm going to say in uh how
[56:28] can I overcome? He said it's not uh uh
[56:31] uh uh what you overcome, it's how. So
[56:34] the problem may be a different problem
[56:36] this morning. The problem may be
[56:38] something different that you didn't have
[56:40] before. It could be a new challenge to
[56:42] you. It could be a new set of issues or
[56:44] whatever. But the same way that you
[56:47] overcame the last time, you will
[56:49] overcome the same the same way today.
[56:51] Why? Because the word doesn't change.
[56:54] The word is the formula to every problem
[56:57] of mankind.
[57:00] Is the same formula to every problem of
[57:03] the mankind. It's the power of
[57:05] transformation that we come in contact
[57:08] with. Yet we are we are born in sin and
[57:11] shaped in iniquity and came into the
[57:13] world speaking life. But somewhere
[57:15] somehow we came in contact with the word
[57:18] of God. And when we heard the word of
[57:20] God and believed it, it changed us from
[57:23] unbelievers, from robbers, from liars,
[57:26] from wherever we were into the children
[57:29] of God.
[57:30] It it wasn't you that changed yourself.
[57:33] The word changed you.
[57:35] It wasn't you that that because you
[57:38] desired healing so much that you got
[57:40] healed. No, it was by the word of God
[57:42] that you got you find your healing.
[57:44] That's why the prophet can say men
[57:46] cannot heal. The doctors can do what
[57:49] they can. But true healing only comes by
[57:52] the word of God.
[57:55] So, so I can say this morning you what
[57:58] it doesn't matter where we come from,
[58:01] how we got to where we are. What we need
[58:04] is the word of God to take us from what
[58:07] we are from whatever condition we find
[58:10] ourselves and bring us into the
[58:12] destination of what God is trying to
[58:14] achieve.
[58:16] If if God said there was going to be an
[58:19] elected in the end time, there's not
[58:22] enough devil that can stop that word to
[58:24] come into manifestation.
[58:26] The the the word of God is the
[58:28] believer's resting place. Now remember
[58:31] our pastor talked about confidence in
[58:33] our promise. I want to just bring to you
[58:36] it just come from an angle where we need
[58:39] to have us as believers of this message.
[58:42] We have to have a life that will leave
[58:45] that is under the expectation of the
[58:48] message word that we have received. We
[58:52] have to consider ourselves a people
[58:55] under the expectation of a promise that
[58:58] we have received. That I have received a
[59:01] promise therefore I shall live. I have
[59:04] received a promise therefore I shall be
[59:06] saved. I have received a promise
[59:08] therefore I shall be transformed.
[59:10] Whatever situation you find yourself,
[59:13] you are guaranteed by the word of God
[59:16] because of the promise you have received
[59:18] that you shall see the results.
[59:21] It's not by your trying. It's not by
[59:24] your effort but but it's by the word of
[59:27] God. The word of God if God said the
[59:31] promise itself is made such that it will
[59:35] produce the children. Let me say this.
[59:37] When the word of God is preached, the
[59:40] word of God is only preached to the
[59:42] believers.
[59:45] The word of God is preached to the
[59:47] believers because the word of God will
[59:49] produce believers. When God send his
[59:52] word, he has a predestinated group of
[59:55] people that will receive that word and
[59:58] manifest that word. Because we know the
[1:00:01] prophet tells us there's three kinds of
[1:00:03] believers. The unbeliever will unbelief
[1:00:06] the word anyway. The make believer will
[1:00:08] make believe the word anyway. So even
[1:00:11] though it falls on the ears but it's
[1:00:13] really not destined to them, the word is
[1:00:16] only to the believers
[1:00:19] to those that have something inside of
[1:00:21] them that is calling for for the
[1:00:23] manifestation of what God has spoken.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:28] So God's promise we can say it's the
[1:00:33] promised word that was made before the
[1:00:36] foundation of the word. That's what our
[1:00:39] expectation lies upon. It's not upon
[1:00:42] what man has spoken but will come many
[1:00:45] times and say you know even though I
[1:00:48] could speak so much he said I will need
[1:00:50] to read the scripture because I know my
[1:00:52] words will fail but the words of God
[1:00:54] will never fail. He said he's trying to
[1:00:57] bring what is he trying to do? He's
[1:00:59] trying to bring the whole group of
[1:01:01] people, the whole world back to the
[1:01:04] scriptures, to the word of God, and give
[1:01:06] you an understanding that if it's if we
[1:01:09] don't have the word, it doesn't matter
[1:01:11] how excited we get. It doesn't matter
[1:01:14] how quiet we stay. It doesn't matter
[1:01:17] what we do, it's bound for failure. And
[1:01:21] the only way we overcome is by the word
[1:01:23] of God. Amen.
[1:01:25] The scripture will say in Romans 10:17,
[1:01:28] it says, "Faith cometh from hearing and
[1:01:32] hearing by the word of God." So if we're
[1:01:35] going to have true expectation, the
[1:01:38] expectation has to come from the
[1:01:40] promised word of God.
[1:01:44] Not not not our excitement, not our
[1:01:47] understanding, not not our intellect.
[1:01:50] You know, we read the message and we can
[1:01:52] connect things together. No, it has to
[1:01:55] come from the promised word of God. His
[1:01:58] word is the anchor for the faith of the
[1:02:02] believer. Only his word is the anchor
[1:02:05] for the faith of the believer. And then
[1:02:08] here we are. We just read the scripture
[1:02:10] about Simeon. The scripture says it was
[1:02:13] revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that
[1:02:16] he should not see death until he sees
[1:02:19] the Lord's Christ. And the prophet will
[1:02:22] speak on on that and and he will speak
[1:02:24] on that and said it was by revelation.
[1:02:27] His expectation was based upon the
[1:02:30] revelation that he had received. His
[1:02:33] expectation was based upon something
[1:02:36] that was quickened inside of his heart
[1:02:39] by the word of God. And he knew, oh my,
[1:02:43] you go read it. The prophet will say,
[1:02:44] "Here's a man 80 years old." And he
[1:02:47] stood publicly. He was unashamed. He
[1:02:50] stood there and proclaimed that it was
[1:02:52] given to him a revelation that he would
[1:02:55] not die and see it until he sees Christ.
[1:02:57] And many came by and said, "Oh, you
[1:03:00] don't know." David came by the way. Many
[1:03:02] of the prophet came by the way. Who are
[1:03:04] you that you could claim that that
[1:03:06] promise will come before you? Now, that
[1:03:09] didn't stop him. He continued on.
[1:03:14] Let me say this. Revelation is not
[1:03:16] without a challenge. That's right.
[1:03:18] Revelation will not come outside of a
[1:03:21] challenge.
[1:03:23] And many times we get challenged just a
[1:03:25] little bit. All of the sudden we crumble
[1:03:28] into the knowledge and everything. Or
[1:03:30] maybe it's not so. Maybe I'm not really
[1:03:32] healed. Maybe I'm not really saved. Let
[1:03:34] me say this. If God has revealed it to
[1:03:36] you, there's not enough devil that can
[1:03:39] take it out.
[1:03:41] That's true. Because it's not man's
[1:03:43] revelation, it's God's revelation.
[1:03:47] Yes.
[1:03:52] So
[1:03:53] faith cometh from hearing and hearing by
[1:03:57] the word. And true
[1:04:01] expectation comes by
[1:04:03] revelation or by faith. And faith is
[1:04:08] based upon the word. And you need the
[1:04:11] word in order for you to come under true
[1:04:15] expectation.
[1:04:18] I'm not going to be long this morning. I
[1:04:20] I I just really want to lay this down so
[1:04:23] it could be something that can help us
[1:04:25] this morning. And I want to say this
[1:04:27] morning, if if brother Matthew promised
[1:04:30] me said, "Brother Billy, I'm going to
[1:04:31] buy you a
[1:04:37] car."
[1:04:39] Now, there's couple of things that I
[1:04:41] need in order for me to be under the
[1:04:44] expectation.
[1:04:47] First of all, I have to make sure that
[1:04:49] it's not my imagination thinking that.
[1:04:52] Okay.
[1:04:54] I have to make sure that I actually
[1:04:56] heard him say that.
[1:04:59] Amen. You with me? Because my
[1:05:02] imagination is not going to help me. I
[1:05:05] have to be under the for me to come
[1:05:08] under the expectation. I have to
[1:05:11] actually have heard him speak that and
[1:05:13] not speak in general. Speak to me.
[1:05:21] It It's not I'm going to buy someone a
[1:05:24] car. No, I'm going to buy Billy a car.
[1:05:28] Not just any Billy Billy Buy a car.
[1:05:33] It It has to have my name on it. It has
[1:05:36] to be my It has to be calling out
[1:05:39] directly. Let me say this. The word of
[1:05:42] God is not spoken in the open. is
[1:05:44] calling unto the hearts of the
[1:05:46] believers.
[1:05:48] It's a direct word that pierces the
[1:05:50] heart that touches you directly. It's
[1:05:53] not many will hear the noise but only
[1:05:56] few will hear the voice.
[1:06:00] And and and another thing I have to be
[1:06:03] sure is I have to trust that he has the
[1:06:07] ability to do that.
[1:06:10] You you understand? I have to look at
[1:06:12] him. I have to know the character of the
[1:06:15] one who spoke and know that I can trust
[1:06:18] him because he's told me one thing
[1:06:20] before and he's done it. And if he told
[1:06:23] me this and he's done it, therefore, if
[1:06:26] he tells me this, he will keep his word.
[1:06:30] God didn't ask you to expect in vain.
[1:06:33] His expectation is based upon his
[1:06:35] promise. He said he will save you. Here
[1:06:38] you are this morning. He said he will
[1:06:40] heal you. Here you are this morning. And
[1:06:43] that same God, he came and he said, "I'm
[1:06:45] going to take you even in the rapture."
[1:06:48] So your expectation is not based upon
[1:06:50] some vain word. It's based upon someone
[1:06:53] who can keep his promise.
[1:07:04] You have to take
[1:07:06] God's reputation and attach it to it.
[1:07:10] That's it.
[1:07:12] Don't Don't just say, "Oh, I I don't
[1:07:15] know if this apply to me." If God has
[1:07:18] spoken to you, you take it and run with
[1:07:21] it.
[1:07:24] May I just add this? By the way, when
[1:07:26] I'm here, let me just say this. People
[1:07:28] that have received the revelation, they
[1:07:31] have to look crazy anyway. Come on.
[1:07:33] That's right.
[1:07:38] Abraham, you're going to have a child.
[1:07:40] But says for 27 years, Abraham could not
[1:07:45] shut his mouth up.
[1:07:48] His neighbors got tired of listening to
[1:07:51] him. People at the store got tired of
[1:07:54] listening. This man is I mean, I know he
[1:07:57] was crazy, but for 27 years, he kept
[1:08:00] testifying of the same. He's going to do
[1:08:03] it. He's going to do it. He's going to
[1:08:05] do it for 27 years. Why? Let me say
[1:08:08] this. That's the picture of expectation
[1:08:12] by revelation.
[1:08:13] Amen.
[1:08:17] If you find yourself asking and after a
[1:08:20] couple of months or whatever you find
[1:08:22] yourself, no, ask God to renew your
[1:08:25] revelation. Ask him to strengthen your
[1:08:28] revelation. Don't crumble under the
[1:08:30] weight of the test. Every revelation has
[1:08:33] to be tested.
[1:08:36] That's it.
[1:08:42] And the scripture will say that every
[1:08:45] promise of God is yes and amen.
[1:08:50] For the promise for all God's promise
[1:08:54] when he makes it, it has to come to
[1:08:57] pass. God's word is unchanging. The
[1:09:01] scripture says that heaven and earth
[1:09:03] will pass away but my word shall not
[1:09:06] pass away. God's promise reveal his
[1:09:09] character. He says in his word that God
[1:09:13] keeps his covenant across all
[1:09:17] generations.
[1:09:20] Now I'm quoting the word and I know I
[1:09:22] can read the many many quotes. I'm like
[1:09:24] I said I'm just trying to be as quick as
[1:09:26] possible this morning so I don't take
[1:09:28] too long.
[1:09:30] That's the promise you are standing
[1:09:31] under. It's a God who never lies. But
[1:09:35] when I'm says that God cannot do one
[1:09:37] thing and that is to lie.
[1:09:42] Not only that, God cannot even change
[1:09:45] his mind. If he already spoken, once he
[1:09:48] already blessed, he cannot curse.
[1:09:53] In fact, the children of Israel, even
[1:09:56] when they done wrong, God will only lead
[1:09:59] them to the enemies so they can be
[1:10:02] reminded that they were under a promise
[1:10:04] and repent and come back to the promise.
[1:10:08] The objective was not a destruction. The
[1:10:11] objective was to bring them in such a
[1:10:13] place where they could be reminded of
[1:10:16] what the promise was and cry out to the
[1:10:18] same God so he can bring the promise
[1:10:21] back unto them.
[1:10:24] That's good. Heaven and earth shall pass
[1:10:27] away but my word shall never pass away.
[1:10:32] When we speak about
[1:10:34] expectation, the the word expectation
[1:10:37] talks about it says if you come under uh
[1:10:41] uh what what
[1:10:43] what if you come under the expectation
[1:10:46] there's a certain condition that you
[1:10:49] find yourself under. So when we speak
[1:10:51] about
[1:10:53] expectation, if one if you're looking
[1:10:56] says when that we we get what we expect.
[1:11:01] Did he say that? He said when you come
[1:11:03] to church, you get what you expect. When
[1:11:05] you come, he said if you come and you're
[1:11:07] looking for mistakes, you'll find it. If
[1:11:09] you come and and your objective is so we
[1:11:12] can find what's not going okay and who's
[1:11:14] wearing what and all of that, you'll see
[1:11:16] that, right? So your your your
[1:11:19] expectation creates your vision. Your
[1:11:22] expectation creates the field that you
[1:11:25] are supposed to see. But we also know
[1:11:28] that by the word of God that if you come
[1:11:31] expecting God to speak to you, God will
[1:11:33] speak to you.
[1:11:36] You understand? So there's the negative
[1:11:38] expectation and the positive
[1:11:40] expectation. So if one come and
[1:11:42] sincerely they have a difficulties, they
[1:11:45] have challenges, they have trials, and
[1:11:47] they have things that they're fighting,
[1:11:49] God is obligated by the word of God to
[1:11:52] speak to them.
[1:11:55] Why? Because the expectation is so that
[1:11:58] God can come and fulfill his word. The
[1:12:01] expectation is an opening for God to
[1:12:04] come and make his word come to pass.
[1:12:07] So I can say this morning that we as
[1:12:10] believers of the message, we are glad
[1:12:13] that to really know that if there's
[1:12:15] anything that we need, if there's
[1:12:17] anything that we can find. But says if
[1:12:20] we come, if you seek, you shall find. If
[1:12:24] you knock, it shall be open. If you ask,
[1:12:27] it shall be given.
[1:12:29] Oh my, there's so many principles. I I
[1:12:32] wouldn't even have time to finish it. He
[1:12:34] he talks about he said if one man has
[1:12:38] come to God under a certain circumstance
[1:12:42] and God healed him or God saved them. It
[1:12:46] says that sets a precedent that if any
[1:12:50] other man will come under the same with
[1:12:53] the same criteria under the same
[1:12:55] circumstances that God is obligated to
[1:12:59] do the same. Yes.
[1:13:02] God is no respector of persons.
[1:13:06] He's respector of his word.
[1:13:10] Now, that should make you happy this
[1:13:12] morning. So, it's not that, oh, God can
[1:13:15] only do it for brother Matthew or for
[1:13:17] brother David or for brother Benoir or
[1:13:20] for such and such. No, God can do it for
[1:13:23] anybody.
[1:13:25] God will do it. Whether a person be a
[1:13:28] believer or an unbeliever, if they
[1:13:31] fulfill the same requirement, God is
[1:13:34] obligated to do it. God looked at Cain
[1:13:37] and he said, "If you do like your
[1:13:39] brother, you shall receive it also." So
[1:13:42] God wasn't looking at Cain as a person.
[1:13:45] He was looking at the promises that he
[1:13:47] had made and he made it clear that if
[1:13:50] you follow the promise, you shall
[1:13:52] receive the blessing. Amen. Yes sir.
[1:13:57] So this morning the the issue is not the
[1:14:01] promise or the word of God. The issue is
[1:14:04] am I coming with the same expectation
[1:14:07] that the God who did it for such and
[1:14:09] such that the God who did it for he will
[1:14:12] do the same for me.
[1:14:15] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:21] But what I will say in the message
[1:14:24] expectation, it says, I've often I've
[1:14:27] often quoted this that God is obligated
[1:14:32] to his word. Amen. I like to just read a
[1:14:36] word or two of it because what I say
[1:14:39] will fail because I'm a man. But his
[1:14:43] word cannot fail because it's God.
[1:14:47] God is ever called one on the scene at
[1:14:51] any time to make a decision. The first
[1:14:56] decision God makes has to be the same
[1:15:00] decision
[1:15:01] every time
[1:15:08] and it says you must believe it. It's
[1:15:12] God's
[1:15:13] word and that's the only hope we have.
[1:15:19] I want you to listen to those words and
[1:15:21] that's really what brought me to this.
[1:15:23] He says, "You must believe it. It's
[1:15:27] God's word." And that's the only hope we
[1:15:30] have.
[1:15:32] That's the only hope that we have. The
[1:15:35] only substantial hope that we have is on
[1:15:41] the word of God.
[1:15:43] Amen.
[1:15:47] Now, think about this. This is very key
[1:15:51] because we can come someone can come
[1:15:53] here and and expand upon men's
[1:15:56] knowledge. It's not of any help.
[1:16:00] He he's wanting to center you. So you as
[1:16:03] you're sitting this morning know where
[1:16:06] does my hope come from?
[1:16:11] We it it's not coming by the intellect
[1:16:13] or the eloquency. It's coming from the
[1:16:16] fact that I know that I am listening to
[1:16:19] the word of God. I am being fed the word
[1:16:22] of God. I'm being positioned upon the
[1:16:25] word of God. I'm being preached the word
[1:16:27] of God. And outside of that, the
[1:16:30] preacher and I, we have no hope.
[1:16:34] We can talk about how good it is and how
[1:16:37] scientifically it can work and
[1:16:38] everything, but if it's outside of the
[1:16:41] word of God, if no help at all, right?
[1:16:45] Amen. He says, "And now God being
[1:16:49] infinite and he cannot make a mistake,
[1:16:52] he's perfect. Therefore, all his promise
[1:16:55] must be perfect as he is perfect. In the
[1:16:58] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:17:00] with God and the word was God and was
[1:17:02] made flesh and dwelt among us. The word
[1:17:06] itself.
[1:17:07] Amen.
[1:17:09] Not a version of the word. The word
[1:17:12] itself was made flesh. So therefore, the
[1:17:15] Bible is the word of God. It's God
[1:17:18] himself placed upon the paper.
[1:17:23] So when we come this morning, when we
[1:17:26] listen to this, it's God himself placed
[1:17:29] upon the paper. And let me help you this
[1:17:31] morning. God doesn't want to remain on
[1:17:34] paper this morning. He want what's on
[1:17:36] this paper to live in you.
[1:17:40] He wants what's on this paper to become
[1:17:42] a reality for you.
[1:17:48] What a blessing this morning. What an
[1:17:50] entrance. We let let me say this. The
[1:17:52] world is hungry and dying, right? Yes,
[1:17:56] sir.
[1:17:58] Don't forget that people are dying,
[1:18:01] right? Because they lack the access and
[1:18:04] the revelation to what we are listening
[1:18:06] to this morning. Yes. The prophet and
[1:18:09] and and and being a prophet, he has
[1:18:12] view. Oh my. I was just listening. Let
[1:18:15] me just take a sidetrack for a moment.
[1:18:17] Butam talks about the Hezekiah said he
[1:18:20] was in the condition that he was and God
[1:18:23] sends a prophet to say you're going to
[1:18:24] die.
[1:18:26] And but makes a a a very very important
[1:18:30] uh comparison and where it says now you
[1:18:33] have the greatest power in heaven and
[1:18:36] the greatest power on earth. But the
[1:18:39] greatest power in heaven before it can
[1:18:41] talk to the greatest power on earth has
[1:18:44] to use the prophet.
[1:18:49] Well, you could have said, "Well, why
[1:18:51] don't those two power just meet? They're
[1:18:53] the greatest." No, it was God's order
[1:18:56] that for the greatest power in heaven to
[1:18:58] contact the greatest power on earth, it
[1:19:00] had to be through a prophet. So, he
[1:19:02] sends a prophet and God tell him he's
[1:19:04] going to die. He goes and he tells him.
[1:19:07] Now, the greatest power on earth wants
[1:19:09] to communicate back. And guess what?
[1:19:14] The greatest power on earth goes to
[1:19:16] prayer and he prays and he asks and he
[1:19:19] prays and he prays. He prays. The
[1:19:22] greatest power comes back. Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] The greatest power in heaven. Now he
[1:19:27] says how foolish of that prophet. How
[1:19:30] foolish of this prophet. Not just long
[1:19:33] ago he came and he told him you're going
[1:19:35] to die. He has to come back again.
[1:19:40] Maybe the the people that were on the
[1:19:43] court and everywhere was still there. It
[1:19:45] was the same. They just saw him come in
[1:19:47] and deliver a message and go out.
[1:19:49] Moments later, they see the same prophet
[1:19:52] come back. He comes back and says, "Thus
[1:19:55] sayeth the Lord, you're going to live."
[1:19:56] Oh my brother, my sister, we have such
[1:19:58] an access. God has sent a prophet
[1:20:01] messenger. He came to you in this
[1:20:03] generation. He said, "You're going to
[1:20:05] live by the word of God." Amen. Amen.
[1:20:08] Yes, sir. What are we doing with it?
[1:20:11] Right?
[1:20:13] The world is dying.
[1:20:17] What is our expectation this morning?
[1:20:21] It says for no man is
[1:20:23] better than his word.
[1:20:27] If he can't if you can't take men's by
[1:20:29] his word, I just think t take anything
[1:20:33] any dealing with him. He must be honest.
[1:20:36] He must be truthful.
[1:20:38] Especially as he professes to be a
[1:20:41] Christian, we don't expect based our
[1:20:43] feelings. We expect
[1:20:46] based on the word of God.
[1:20:49] David said in Psalm 62 and5, "My
[1:20:54] soul
[1:20:56] waiteth only upon God
[1:21:00] for he for God for my
[1:21:04] expectation is from him. Amen.
[1:21:09] If you go read the background of that
[1:21:11] psalm, it suggested two things. They
[1:21:15] said one must have been when his own son
[1:21:18] Abselum betrayed him and he was trying
[1:21:20] to take power from him or the other it
[1:21:24] must have been when the king was hunting
[1:21:26] for him and trying to get him killed.
[1:21:29] And he looked on one side he had all the
[1:21:32] deception of men. On the other side, he
[1:21:35] had all the deception of the world and
[1:21:37] and everything around him. He looked
[1:21:40] around him and he realized, "I can't
[1:21:42] trust man. I can't do anything. There's
[1:21:45] nothing to protect me. I have nothing."
[1:21:48] He looks in himself and said, "My only
[1:21:50] expectation."
[1:21:53] Perhaps you feel that way this morning.
[1:21:56] Perhaps you feel like I I've tried this.
[1:21:58] I've done this and I don't know what to
[1:22:00] do. My brother, my sister, take your
[1:22:03] expectation off of man. Place it under
[1:22:06] the word of God this morning. Take your
[1:22:08] expectation. But the scripture says that
[1:22:11] put no trust in princes because they
[1:22:14] will fail you.
[1:22:16] Let your trust be upon the living God.
[1:22:19] God will use man. God will provide a
[1:22:22] way. But you put your trust in God and
[1:22:25] God will make a way for you.
[1:22:30] The scripture will talk about it.
[1:22:33] Expectation and faith is founded. When
[1:22:37] we have
[1:22:38] expectation is because we take it and
[1:22:41] it's founded upon revelation or the word
[1:22:44] of God. What did brother Brennham tell
[1:22:46] us about the new
[1:22:48] birth? It's the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ personally to you.
[1:22:54] If you if Jesus Christ has revealed
[1:22:57] himself personally to you, you will have
[1:23:01] an expectation.
[1:23:04] I'm not talking about knowledge and and
[1:23:07] everything. And and I let me say this. I
[1:23:10] think when we say the word knowledge,
[1:23:11] people take it as bad. No, we have to
[1:23:14] have knowledge. We have to read to know
[1:23:16] what the word says. But what we want is
[1:23:18] that which we have learned and
[1:23:20] understood to become a revelation. We
[1:23:23] want God to take that and move it from
[1:23:25] the head into the heart where it becomes
[1:23:27] a heartbeat, something that we can live
[1:23:29] by. Not something that can go away when
[1:23:32] we find ourselves in a difficult
[1:23:33] situation, but something that will speak
[1:23:36] back to you.
[1:23:39] So when we come to church, my question
[1:23:41] to you is what is our
[1:23:44] approach? What is our expectation?
[1:23:47] What's your expectation this morning
[1:23:48] when you came to church? What's my
[1:23:50] expectation when I came into the house
[1:23:52] of God?
[1:23:55] Was my expectation that I will come and
[1:23:58] go back exactly the same way I came? Was
[1:24:01] my expectation that God, father, I have
[1:24:04] a need. I want your word to speak to my
[1:24:06] need so I can go out with an
[1:24:10] answer. Now think about it. If the
[1:24:14] measure that we receive is based on our
[1:24:17] expectation, then how big should our
[1:24:19] expectation be?
[1:24:24] Just think about it yourself. How big
[1:24:26] should your expectation be be this
[1:24:29] morning?
[1:24:31] We say nothing is impossible to God, but
[1:24:35] the the word turns around and looks at
[1:24:37] you. It's a two-way street. It says that
[1:24:40] nothing is impossible to them that
[1:24:42] believe those that come with an
[1:24:44] expectation.
[1:24:49] So when we come we we we of all
[1:24:53] people are supposed to have such an
[1:24:57] expectation. The scripture says that he
[1:24:59] has not entered into the minds of men
[1:25:03] the things that God has prepared for
[1:25:04] them. This morning we can come expecting
[1:25:08] big, asking big, walking big, believing
[1:25:13] big, talking big. Let me say this. If
[1:25:16] you can't do it, God can do it. If it's
[1:25:20] impossible to you, it's impossible to
[1:25:22] God. And the only way it will become
[1:25:24] possible to you is for you to take that
[1:25:27] impossible and believe it with God and
[1:25:29] then make it possible.
[1:25:33] It's not for you to sit there and say,
[1:25:35] "Well, it's impossible, then I don't
[1:25:36] know how I'm going to get it." No, it's
[1:25:38] for you to exchange your
[1:25:40] impossibility with the possibility from
[1:25:43] God.
[1:25:46] We we sit here, we believe that we have
[1:25:50] received a prophet messenger. We believe
[1:25:52] that we've been elected. We believe we
[1:25:54] are the people going into the rapture. I
[1:25:57] want to say this, predestination has to
[1:26:00] come into manifestation somewhere.
[1:26:03] What was promised had to meet the
[1:26:06] believer somewhere. It's not going to
[1:26:08] remain up there somewhere somehow. Let
[1:26:11] me say this. Predestination street must
[1:26:14] meet manifestation street somewhere.
[1:26:17] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:26:25] God, you said again there's so many
[1:26:28] Bible scriptures that I can just quote
[1:26:31] an example. But one of them speaks about
[1:26:33] the woman with the blood issue. He said
[1:26:36] she had no example.
[1:26:39] She had no scripture that if she touched
[1:26:42] Jesus garment that she was receive
[1:26:45] healing.
[1:26:49] Are you with me this morning? Amen. But
[1:26:51] something within her heart declare that
[1:26:55] if I can only touch the hem of his
[1:26:58] garment, if the lips I can do is touch
[1:27:01] the hem of his garment, it will come to
[1:27:03] pass for me. And she did it by
[1:27:06] expectation. She received what she was
[1:27:09] asking for. But what says this, it says
[1:27:12] that was not God operating his gift.
[1:27:15] This was the woman operating God's gift.
[1:27:24] And here we are sitting this morning, my
[1:27:27] brother, my sister, we have such access
[1:27:29] to an abundance this morning. Let let's
[1:27:32] not die of hunger when the table is full
[1:27:35] of food this morning.
[1:27:42] So when we come to church and what is
[1:27:46] our expectation?
[1:27:49] What is our need this morning? What is
[1:27:51] our expectation for? What we have need
[1:27:53] of when we come and what when we come
[1:27:57] when we approach the scripture says that
[1:28:00] come you approach him with boldness in
[1:28:03] the day of
[1:28:04] judgment. We come and we believe that
[1:28:06] he's our father and we are his sons. We
[1:28:09] come and when we come and we need a
[1:28:12] revelation that I'm doing what I'm doing
[1:28:15] is God's role. I'm playing my role of
[1:28:18] believing. I'm playing. Remember, each
[1:28:21] one has a role to play. Our role as
[1:28:23] believers is to proclaim, is to testify,
[1:28:27] is to proclaim the promise, is to
[1:28:29] believe the promise. God's role as the
[1:28:32] giver is to look at us and look at our
[1:28:35] faith and give it to us.
[1:28:38] He wants us to testify of it before we
[1:28:41] even seen it.
[1:28:44] That's true.
[1:28:45] He wants us to declare him before he
[1:28:48] even happens. He wants us to come with
[1:28:51] such an expectation that when we ask, we
[1:28:54] can go out of here rejoicing and know
[1:28:56] that I have received from God what I'm
[1:28:59] asking for.
[1:29:02] So we don't
[1:29:04] approach we we we don't let me say this.
[1:29:08] This is very important to me. We don't
[1:29:10] want to approach God and be guessing if
[1:29:14] it's really gonna happen or not. That
[1:29:17] time is gone.
[1:29:20] I I ask of you, do not do that. Don't
[1:29:24] come here guessing whether you're going
[1:29:26] to get it or not get it.
[1:29:30] Ask God. Pray. Stand upon the word and
[1:29:34] he will give you an expect an
[1:29:36] expectation. We we don't want to come
[1:29:38] and pray uh uh we want to come with
[1:29:41] confidence and boldness. We need to know
[1:29:44] and have an assurance that the promise
[1:29:46] has been given to us. We need to have to
[1:29:49] know that we have access. The seals have
[1:29:52] been open and we are reading from the
[1:29:55] open book. Amen.
[1:30:00] Th this time that we are living in is
[1:30:03] very much different from the time gone
[1:30:05] by.
[1:30:12] But says one place and I believe it's in
[1:30:15] Satan's Eden. And forgive me if I quote
[1:30:19] it wrong. He said, "I want to speak to
[1:30:22] you about the word of God, the message
[1:30:26] of the hour." It said something that
[1:30:30] will help you to fight the battles that
[1:30:33] you are fighting today.
[1:30:35] something that will help you avoid
[1:30:38] taking too many punches.
[1:30:43] You understand what we are facing this
[1:30:45] morning? I It's not a guessing game. I
[1:30:48] It's not something that a man has
[1:30:50] constructed. The word of God for the
[1:30:53] hour is to overcome the challenges that
[1:30:55] you are facing today. something that
[1:30:57] will help you. The God has overcome the
[1:31:00] devil and he sent forth his prophet
[1:31:03] messenger to give you the techniques
[1:31:05] that you need for you to win the
[1:31:07] battles. Yeah. Right, brother. Amen.
[1:31:13] It says we need to know and be assured
[1:31:16] that God promises for us this morning
[1:31:19] and that he's given us access.
[1:31:23] We need to come expecting big, believing
[1:31:26] big. We are here because we were
[1:31:29] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:31:31] the world. Amen.
[1:31:34] The scripture says in Romans
[1:31:37] 8:9 that is it says they which are the
[1:31:42] children of the flesh these are not the
[1:31:45] children of the of the of God but the
[1:31:48] children of the promise are counted as
[1:31:53] seed. Children of the promise you are
[1:31:56] counted as
[1:31:57] seed. For this is the word of God of
[1:32:02] promise. At this time I will come and
[1:32:07] Sarah shall have a son.
[1:32:12] There was an appointed time. It was not
[1:32:14] for every it was for a certain appointed
[1:32:16] time that the word will come. When it
[1:32:18] comes at that time that's when the word
[1:32:23] promised word will produce children.
[1:32:25] Right? It took God himself to come down
[1:32:29] and visit Abraham for Abraham to have a
[1:32:32] children. It took God himself to come
[1:32:35] and visit this generation
[1:32:39] for God to have children in this
[1:32:41] generation. And not only this, but by
[1:32:44] when Rebecca also conceived by one, even
[1:32:48] by our father Isaac. For the children
[1:32:51] not yet been born, neither having done
[1:32:53] good or evil, that the purpose of God
[1:32:56] according to election might stand, not
[1:32:58] of works, but of him that
[1:33:03] calleth. I want to say this morning, we
[1:33:05] are the seed of God by election. Amen.
[1:33:09] We are here by election.
[1:33:12] We are here. You can you should look
[1:33:14] yourself this morning and you say, "My
[1:33:17] name is elected. My name is chosen. My
[1:33:20] name is predestinated. My name is I'm
[1:33:23] supposed to be the bride in the end
[1:33:25] time." That's your promise that you are
[1:33:27] standing in. Why? Because when the word
[1:33:29] is spoken, it nothing can stop it from
[1:33:32] coming to pass.
[1:33:34] Now, when we speak about expectation, I
[1:33:37] know I I probably won't be able to
[1:33:39] finish, but that's okay. Expectation by
[1:33:42] definition is a strong belief that
[1:33:45] something will happen or to be the case
[1:33:49] in the future. When you speak about
[1:33:51] expectation, it's an act or a state of
[1:33:54] looking forward or
[1:34:00] anticipating. A state of looking forward
[1:34:04] with anticipation.
[1:34:06] When you expect something, there has to
[1:34:09] be an anticipation. If I was this
[1:34:12] morning was to travel to Hawaii and and
[1:34:14] I'm getting ready to go and I'm expected
[1:34:17] to be there. I said, "Okay, next Monday
[1:34:20] I'm going to be in Hawaii." The the the
[1:34:22] the
[1:34:23] the very fact that I said that I'm
[1:34:26] expecting I want to go to Hawaii, that
[1:34:29] itself puts me under the expectation.
[1:34:32] And because I'm expected to go, one of
[1:34:35] the things I need to do is make sure
[1:34:36] that I pack my bags, I get my clothes
[1:34:39] washed, and I get everything. I need to
[1:34:41] know what the weather is going to be,
[1:34:43] where I'm going. I need It causes me
[1:34:46] because I'm under expectation to prepare
[1:34:50] for where I'm going.
[1:34:55] Expectation puts you under preparation.
[1:34:59] True. When you are expecting something,
[1:35:02] you prepare for it.
[1:35:05] Case in point, Abraham went and bought
[1:35:08] what he needed for the baby. Abraham
[1:35:10] testified about the baby. Abraham kept
[1:35:13] asking Sarah every time, "How is it
[1:35:15] going?" and everything. And let me point
[1:35:17] this out. Abraham expectation grew
[1:35:20] stronger as he was getting near the
[1:35:23] promise.
[1:35:29] Now, are we getting
[1:35:32] stronger as the promise is getting nigh?
[1:35:37] Are we preparing for the rapture that's
[1:35:40] around the corner? Yes, sir.
[1:35:44] Are we doing all that's
[1:35:47] necaining ground or are we losing
[1:35:50] ground?
[1:35:52] Are we under greater expectation than we
[1:35:55] were when we started or are we those
[1:35:58] that the scripture saying that they
[1:36:00] looked and said that since the promise
[1:36:03] was made our father went into the grave
[1:36:06] we have not seen it and the days are
[1:36:08] going
[1:36:11] because that is a scripture that will
[1:36:13] happen.
[1:36:16] You understand? So they they there's two
[1:36:18] groups here that that that is supposed
[1:36:21] to happen at the end time. But one says
[1:36:24] that there's one group who the word uh
[1:36:27] will talk and he said in the end time
[1:36:30] people will be high-minded and and
[1:36:32] ungrateful and and lovers of pleasure
[1:36:35] more than lovers of God. In fact he he
[1:36:38] quoted the scripture in Revelation uh
[1:36:40] 3:19. He talks about the Laudysian
[1:36:43] church age lukewarm and all of that. He
[1:36:46] says that that condition will exist in
[1:36:48] the church. And the prophet said that
[1:36:50] the Laudian church h is the type of
[1:36:53] Pentecost.
[1:36:56] You with me? Now my question to you, are
[1:37:00] you under these two groups or are you in
[1:37:03] another group that's called a bride?
[1:37:06] Because the way that you know which
[1:37:08] group you are in is based on your
[1:37:10] expectation this morning.
[1:37:14] That's right. Are we preparing for
[1:37:16] what's to
[1:37:17] come? Are we? Yeah, we are. My brother,
[1:37:20] I tell you this morning, my heart was
[1:37:23] just uh uh uh uh in flame. I I'm
[1:37:26] thinking about we we sit here this
[1:37:28] morning seeing every prophecy that's
[1:37:31] been made come to pass. Not one time,
[1:37:34] multiple times. Uh-huh. The woman with
[1:37:38] the purple dress and the this king and
[1:37:41] and I'm sorry, the pope and and this and
[1:37:44] coveret and all of that. We we ourselves
[1:37:47] have lived long enough to see all of
[1:37:49] those things happen.
[1:37:52] You with me this morning? But has that
[1:37:55] put you under more expectation or has
[1:37:58] that put you under less expectations?
[1:38:03] Are you more prepared now than you were
[1:38:06] back then? Is your heart hungering and
[1:38:09] crying out for more or is it crying out
[1:38:12] for less?
[1:38:14] Are you more into the things of God or
[1:38:17] are you finding yourself redressing?
[1:38:23] Let let me just read for the sake of
[1:38:25] time. I won't be able to go into all of
[1:38:28] this. So expectation calls for
[1:38:31] preparation.
[1:38:35] You with me?
[1:38:44] Expectation calls for
[1:38:47] preparation.
[1:38:49] Expectation is patient and unshakable.
[1:38:56] Abraham.
[1:38:57] Expectation is a condition that prepares
[1:39:01] you for a miracle that's about to
[1:39:03] happen. The blind babe.
[1:39:07] Now, I'm just summarizing as I'm going
[1:39:09] because I don't want to take too long.
[1:39:11] Expectation leads to action.
[1:39:16] Expectation provokes an action.
[1:39:20] Noah was there under the expectation
[1:39:22] that he was going to rain and he built
[1:39:25] an ark.
[1:39:28] I heard a man say, "If you're preparing
[1:39:31] for a rain, you will carry an umbrella."
[1:39:36] Right? If you were in your house and you
[1:39:39] knew that if you went out, it rain was
[1:39:42] going to catch you, you would pick up an
[1:39:43] umbrella and take it with you. Why?
[1:39:46] Because you believe what the weatherman
[1:39:48] said, right? But we have been told that
[1:39:52] we are living in the time
[1:39:56] Come on, my brother. My sister, don't
[1:39:58] don't fail to see this. This is the
[1:40:00] greatest of all the time. I'm not trying
[1:40:03] to scare you. I'm trying to make you be
[1:40:05] bold. Amen. Yes, sir. This is the time
[1:40:09] where the sons of God are supposed to be
[1:40:11] manifested. This is the time where we're
[1:40:14] supposed to stand there and proclaim the
[1:40:17] word of God. This is the time where we
[1:40:20] supposed to be ready for the rapture.
[1:40:22] This is the time where we are the dead
[1:40:24] in Christ shall rise. This is the time.
[1:40:27] And as the word is getting rest, we're
[1:40:30] supposed to be ready.
[1:40:34] My question is we need to do a checkup
[1:40:36] within ourselves. And you need to
[1:40:39] measure your own spirituality and ask
[1:40:41] yourself, am I going one way or am I
[1:40:44] going the other way? Amen.
[1:40:50] We heard our pastor said often times
[1:40:52] here said, "Why don't we come back to
[1:40:54] church?" He said, "If God knew that you
[1:40:56] wanted to be in church, and I asked this
[1:40:59] sincerely, you think God will not give
[1:41:02] you an opportunity to be in church
[1:41:04] Sunday night and Wednesday if you really
[1:41:07] went to him and cry out, I'm an example.
[1:41:09] I'm standing here. It's not because
[1:41:11] Billy is strong. Billy, no. ability is
[1:41:14] probably the worst that there is.
[1:41:19] Set your affection on the things above.
[1:41:23] Put God first, my brother, my sister.
[1:41:26] I'm speaking for my whole soul and my
[1:41:28] whole heart this morning. I I I'm trying
[1:41:30] to help you. I'm trying to help me. I
[1:41:33] want us to work together and go forward.
[1:41:36] Yes.
[1:41:40] What? Whatever is stopping you, whatever
[1:41:42] you're dealing with, let's come together
[1:41:44] and praise for God to help you. God, I I
[1:41:48] want to do this for you, but I can't.
[1:41:50] Oh, God. Our brother needs to be in your
[1:41:53] service. Our brother, he's got his heart
[1:41:55] desire. But
[1:41:57] says, but talks about how in the end
[1:42:00] time he says the most important thing is
[1:42:03] serving God.
[1:42:05] Amen. That's right.
[1:42:10] I don't want to be the fulfillment of
[1:42:12] that man who build a bond and then went
[1:42:16] to build another one and then another
[1:42:18] one and then an angel came to him and
[1:42:21] say full and slow of heart. What if I
[1:42:24] require your soul tonight?
[1:42:28] We're not here to build kingdoms.
[1:42:32] We're not here to build personalities.
[1:42:34] We're not here to build ourselves. We're
[1:42:37] here for one purpose and fun purpose
[1:42:40] only. That we may get into the kingdom.
[1:42:43] That we may get into the ark that God
[1:42:45] has provided, the message of the hour,
[1:42:48] and be taken out of this world.
[1:42:51] Let me say this. However much money you
[1:42:53] save, you're going to leave it.
[1:42:57] Whether it be by the way of the grave or
[1:42:59] by the way of the rapture.
[1:43:02] I'm being honest.
[1:43:04] However many clothes you need to buy and
[1:43:06] shoes and all of that and houses, those
[1:43:08] things will stay.
[1:43:13] Let's put the kingdom of God first.
[1:43:15] Let's work together first. Let's come
[1:43:17] together as a united body. Let's work
[1:43:20] together. Put our shoulder to the will.
[1:43:22] Let's come and be energized. Let the
[1:43:25] Holy Spirit fell upon us. Let God
[1:43:27] energize us by his word. Let us see the
[1:43:30] promises of the end time come to pass.
[1:43:32] Let us be on fire for God. Let us be
[1:43:34] motivated for God. Let us be have the
[1:43:37] zeal of God in our heart. Let our heart
[1:43:39] burn for one another. Let us do good to
[1:43:42] one another. Let us love one another.
[1:43:44] Let us work for one another. Let us lay
[1:43:47] our life for one another.
[1:43:50] Those are the things that count.
[1:43:56] God bless you. Let's all stand this
[1:43:58] morning.
[1:44:07] Expectation.
[1:44:10] Expectation influences your attitude.
[1:44:15] Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] I don't got time to be sad.
[1:44:20] Things go wrong. Well, things go wrong.
[1:44:22] True. You know the devil wants you to
[1:44:24] wallow and sit there and you know create
[1:44:28] and you know misery finds misery. You
[1:44:31] know that right? So call all the misery
[1:44:34] around and wallow and and create the
[1:44:37] greater misery. Not interested in that.
[1:44:41] It's happened good. I move forward. I
[1:44:45] want to be a John Ryan.
[1:44:47] Expectation
[1:44:49] creates influences your attitude. He got
[1:44:52] told like our brother Ben said, "You, I
[1:44:54] taught you were healed." He said, "Well,
[1:44:56] what is a healed person do?" They
[1:44:58] rejoice. Praise God. What does a healed
[1:45:02] person do? They walk around testifying.
[1:45:05] He went around testifying. What does a
[1:45:07] He went in the Bible and find himself
[1:45:11] everything that a healed person does and
[1:45:13] he did it.
[1:45:16] Why? Because the expectation influenced
[1:45:19] his attitude. Yes. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] What is our attitude? We're going to
[1:45:24] heaven. Yeah.
[1:45:27] We're going in the right job. Let's go.
[1:45:31] Who's going to buy that?
[1:45:35] And then the same person, we see him
[1:45:37] somewhere in some party, they the life
[1:45:39] of the party. You know what I mean? It's
[1:45:41] like
[1:45:44] something's not checking out.
[1:45:48] Let me say if there's a place that I'm
[1:45:50] going to dance, it's in the house of
[1:45:51] God. If there's a place you're going to
[1:45:54] find Billy dancing, it's in the house of
[1:45:56] God. If there's a place you're going to
[1:45:58] find Billy rejoicing, it's in the Father
[1:46:01] God. If there's a place that I'm going
[1:46:03] to be at my fullest of joy, it's in his
[1:46:07] presence.
[1:46:08] There's nothing like his presence.
[1:46:13] Amen.
[1:46:17] Expectation sets the atmosphere for God
[1:46:20] to move in.
[1:46:22] Very good. You with me? Amen.
[1:46:25] Expectation is just sets everything
[1:46:28] right for God to move in. One who's
[1:46:31] under the expectation. And like the
[1:46:33] woman in Memphis, like I said, I could
[1:46:36] just go on. She was under the
[1:46:39] expectation.
[1:46:40] She prayed and it revealed to her that
[1:46:44] she was the Schumanite woman.
[1:46:46] and she saw herself matching the
[1:46:48] Shumanite woman. And therefore, she knew
[1:46:51] that if I'm the Schumanite woman, there
[1:46:53] must be an Elijah somewhere.
[1:46:57] Are you with me this morning? I I'm not
[1:47:00] trying to just get you to be I'm really
[1:47:03] speaking from my heart this morning.
[1:47:07] We We are being robbed of so many
[1:47:09] things.
[1:47:11] the the the church of God, the place
[1:47:14] where God dwells, where the power of God
[1:47:16] dwells, the church, the scripture speaks
[1:47:19] about the bride in the end time, the
[1:47:21] bride will do the greater works. But how
[1:47:24] are we going to do the greater works if
[1:47:26] we don't even understand right where we
[1:47:29] are standing and the expected things
[1:47:31] about us. Right.
[1:47:34] So this woman came and they stand across
[1:47:37] the fence
[1:47:39] and the atmosphere began to change. She
[1:47:43] just sat there and laying against the
[1:47:44] fence. She didn't care if it she was
[1:47:47] going to be there for days. All she knew
[1:47:50] is God spoke to her. She was willing to
[1:47:53] die for the word of
[1:47:57] God. God saw the expectation in the
[1:47:59] woman. He was obligated to send Elijah.
[1:48:03] And yes, Elijah on the plane and God
[1:48:05] said, "We need to make a detour here. We
[1:48:09] need to create a stone here. We need to
[1:48:12] do this here so we can take this plan
[1:48:13] and put it here." But my sister, God did
[1:48:16] it for one woman.
[1:48:19] You think if we come together this
[1:48:21] morning as a body and ask, God is not
[1:48:23] going to hear us. If we come this
[1:48:26] morning, let me say this. We are born
[1:48:28] with one spirit. We are saved by one
[1:48:31] blood. God wants us to work as a unit.
[1:48:34] If we can come this morning as a unit
[1:48:37] and work together, the things that we'll
[1:48:40] do, no man can match it.
[1:48:44] Amen.
[1:48:46] But what if we come and
[1:48:49] no expectation, you know, I just go and
[1:48:53] you know, I just go to church and I come
[1:48:55] and no other expect I don't want to be
[1:48:58] involved, right? I like to have a
[1:49:00] distance between God, me, and the things
[1:49:02] of God. You know what I mean? When I
[1:49:04] need it, I come closer. When I don't
[1:49:05] need it, I just There it is.
[1:49:10] You'll be unstable.
[1:49:12] I said this before. The people that
[1:49:15] think this message is not real, they
[1:49:17] didn't stay long long enough around it.
[1:49:21] You stay long enough around it. Let me
[1:49:24] say this. The challenges is only to run
[1:49:27] the unbeliever and the make believer
[1:49:29] away. The the believer in by nature
[1:49:33] welcomes the challenges. Why? Because
[1:49:36] the challenge bring the best out of him.
[1:49:39] The challenges causes him to rely more
[1:49:41] on his father. The challenge is just
[1:49:44] there for him to cry out
[1:49:46] so that the promise will come to pass.
[1:49:49] Amen.
[1:49:52] Expectation prepares you to receive.
[1:49:59] David said that I open my mouth. Open
[1:50:03] thy my mouth. Open thou mouth wide. Open
[1:50:08] thy mouth wide and I will fill
[1:50:15] it. Think not what you shall say.
[1:50:19] You just ask. It says the very spirit
[1:50:23] will come and intercede for you for the
[1:50:25] things which you have need of. All we
[1:50:28] need this morning is just by the word
[1:50:31] that we have received. Come under the
[1:50:34] expectation. And I believe with all my
[1:50:36] heart God will take care of all our
[1:50:38] needs. I believe with all my heart God
[1:50:41] will move in this place like never
[1:50:43] before. I believe we'll come in sync and
[1:50:47] we will be thy greatest army. Well,
[1:50:49] we'll be that invincible army that God
[1:50:51] promised. We'll be that body that's
[1:50:53] going into the rapture. We'll be those
[1:50:55] people, that perfect son. We'll be the
[1:50:58] manifestation of the bride in the end
[1:50:59] time. We will be all of those things,
[1:51:02] but come under the expectation of the
[1:51:06] promise. Is that your heart desire this
[1:51:08] morning?
[1:51:10] Is that your heart? You really want that
[1:51:12] this morning? Yes. If you really want
[1:51:15] that, why don't you just open your mouth
[1:51:16] and pray out to him this morning? Our
[1:51:19] gracious father, we have nothing to
[1:51:21] offer but ourselves.
[1:51:24] Lord God, we ask of you, Lord. You said
[1:51:27] come humbly asking and I shall give you.
[1:51:30] Lord, we come and ask this morning. Lead
[1:51:32] us, oh God. Father, we are your
[1:51:35] children. No doubt we've commit errors.
[1:51:37] We've made mistakes. We've done things
[1:51:39] that are not pleasing to you. Father,
[1:51:41] the scripture says that confess your sin
[1:51:43] and it shall go before you. We want to
[1:51:46] confess all our wrong, everything, and
[1:51:48] ask that you forgive us of all of that.
[1:51:50] But Father, bring us into the unity
[1:51:52] under your word, the unity under your
[1:51:55] spirit under one accord, one faith, one
[1:51:59] people working for the same goal,
[1:52:01] working for the same objective,
[1:52:03] supporting one another. Father, going
[1:52:06] forward, knowing that, Father, that the
[1:52:08] field is great and the workers are few.
[1:52:11] Knowing that we have been called for a
[1:52:12] mission to do a work, Father, that's our
[1:52:15] heart's desire this morning. Lord, may
[1:52:17] you just drop this morning into the
[1:52:19] hearts of those that have lifted up
[1:52:20] their hands, those that are listening.
[1:52:23] Father, if there be any need
[1:52:24] represented, I pray in the name of the
[1:52:27] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we come with
[1:52:29] expectation based upon what you have
[1:52:31] said, based upon your word, and know
[1:52:33] that according to your word, you will
[1:52:35] come and hear us this morning. Come and
[1:52:38] heal our sicknesses and make us well.
[1:52:40] And Father, those that are financially
[1:52:43] uh uh in trouble, Lord, help them that
[1:52:45] may come into the house, of God. Father,
[1:52:48] that your house may be filled with
[1:52:49] believers, those that have testimonies
[1:52:52] of the things that you have done for
[1:52:53] them. Lord, your testimonies are
[1:52:55] everlasting to everlasting. I believe
[1:52:58] even in heaven, Lord, we'll still be
[1:53:00] talking about the wonderful things that
[1:53:02] you have done. I pray this morning that
[1:53:04] you hear our prayers. Here we are crying
[1:53:07] out to you with the desires of our
[1:53:09] heart. One desire, Lord, bring us into
[1:53:12] your word. Lead us and guide us. Fill us
[1:53:15] with your spirit that we may be pleasing
[1:53:17] to you. We love you and we ask all of
[1:53:19] those things in the lovely name of the
[1:53:22] Lord Jesus Christ we pray.
[1:53:24] Amen. Amen. Let's just sing

[2:11:21] my you can
[2:11:28] [Music]
[2:11:32] and why it's just been so wonderful to
[2:11:36] be in his presence. We don't want
[2:11:38] to change the atmosphere, but we'll say
[2:11:41] a prayer dismissal for those that can
[2:11:43] stay can stay and those that need to go.
[2:11:45] Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful,
[2:11:48] Lord, that we could come and hear the
[2:11:51] word of God this morning.
[2:11:54] Lord, in that we can renew our
[2:11:56] expectations in the hour that we're now
[2:11:58] living, knowing that we've received such
[2:12:01] a great word of promise, Lord, that we
[2:12:04] can be an expectation, Lord. And as our
[2:12:06] brother ministered, not just some
[2:12:08] natural expectation that's created by
[2:12:12] some intellectual buildup, Lord, but a
[2:12:15] revelation. Father, we cry out for more
[2:12:17] revelation, Lord. We we want revelation
[2:12:20] to be our reality. So many times we
[2:12:22] allow the senses and this flesh to
[2:12:24] become what governs our thoughts and our
[2:12:26] ambitions, oh God. But but Lord, may we
[2:12:29] be like Abraham and call those things
[2:12:31] that are not as though they are, Lord.
[2:12:32] And that we know by this word that we've
[2:12:34] received, we are going in a body change.
[2:12:37] We are going in a rapture, Lord. And
[2:12:39] soon and very soon we'll be changed in a
[2:12:41] moment, in a twinkling of an eye, Lord.
[2:12:43] We may we get off get our eyes off the
[2:12:45] things on the earth and get set our
[2:12:47] affections on things above. Lord, we
[2:12:49] just so thank you for the word this
[2:12:51] morning. Lord, may you just restore
[2:12:52] brother Billy. Father, may you touch him
[2:12:54] in his body, Lord. May you just bring a
[2:12:57] supernatural healing to him and a
[2:12:58] strength. Father, Lord, we appreciate
[2:13:00] him so much. All his labor and love and
[2:13:02] sacrifice for the bride and the body of
[2:13:04] God, Lord. We just commit them to you,
[2:13:06] Lord. All those that came for prayer.
[2:13:08] Lord, we rejoice in what you're doing
[2:13:09] and and how you've moved upon each
[2:13:12] heart, Lord. And as we go from here,
[2:13:13] Father, oh, may we be dismissed from
[2:13:15] this building, but not from your
[2:13:16] presence, Lord. We just need you more
[2:13:19] than we've ever needed you before, Lord.
[2:13:21] We love you. We just ask these
[2:13:23] blessings, Lord, and ask that you go
[2:13:25] with us now. In the name of the Lord
[2:13:26] Jesus Christ, we
[2:13:28] pray. Amen. And
[2:13:30] amen. There are two
[2:13:33] roads you can
[2:13:37] take. One by
[2:13:41] side, one by faith.
[2:13:46] Take the word of God.
[2:13:51] [Music]
[2:14:00] Oh, and there are two
[2:14:04] roads. You are
[2:14:06] dismissed. Oh, on my
[2:14:11] side, one
[2:14:16] by the word of God.
[2:14:20] What you
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:26] see is
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:30] walking. Set your
[2:14:33] wings to the wings of
[2:14:37] me. You can
[2:14:41] fly in our
[2:14:44] way. Oh, do not struggle.
[2:14:50] It's my
[2:14:51] [Music]
[2:14:52] praise. Set your
[2:14:56] wings through the wind
[2:14:59] of Oh, I watch
[2:15:04] your
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:08] watch. Watch
[2:15:11] your watch.
[2:15:16] Oh, the word of
[2:15:18] God. And my and
[2:15:21] [Applause]
[2:15:23] my
[2:15:26] will for you
[2:15:29] will. Oh, send your
[2:15:33] wings to the wind
[2:15:41] of a high.
[2:15:45] Oh, through my
[2:15:49] struggle. It's my
[2:15:52] grace. Search your
[2:15:56] wings through the wind
[2:16:00] of
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:04] watch. We will smile.
[2:16:08] We
[2:16:11] [Music]
[2:16:18] watch
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:21] this where it's
[2:16:26] already in the sky.
[2:16:30] Oh, your
[2:16:34] wings are
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:40] praise in a
[2:16:44] I overshot.
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:17:25] Heat.
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:32] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:18:01] Are
[2:18:04] you
[2:18:09] all right?
[2:18:12] [Music]
