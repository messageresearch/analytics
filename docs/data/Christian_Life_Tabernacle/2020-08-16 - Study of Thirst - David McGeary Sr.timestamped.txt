[18:15] as you invite with mike so i'm reading
[18:18] amen god bless you
[18:25] good morning
[18:27] you know there's it's funny how there
[18:28] are certain words in the scriptures or
[18:31] whenever we talk about the lord
[18:34] that you know our mind automatically
[18:35] goes in a certain direction based on 2
[18:38] 000 years of religious teaching
[18:41] you know one of those words
[18:42] is judgment
[18:44] you know whenever we hear the word
[18:46] judgment you know in our minds we think
[18:48] of you know the wicked our reserves to
[18:50] the day of judgment and judgment looks
[18:52] something like fire and brimstone
[18:54] raining down on the on the nations right
[18:57] but you know if you look at webster's
[18:58] dictionary it says this
[19:00] the judgment is an opinion or a decision
[19:03] that is based on careful thought
[19:06] it's the act or process of forming a
[19:08] decision after careful thought
[19:10] the act of judging something or someone
[19:12] the ability to make good decisions
[19:15] about what should be done
[19:18] you know certainly if you are standing
[19:20] before a judge and you're
[19:22] guilty of crimes a verdict of punishment
[19:24] can be an intimidating and a fearful
[19:26] thing
[19:28] but if you stand before a judge and his
[19:30] judgment is is that he declares you
[19:32] innocent of all charges
[19:34] that's the sweetest judgment in the
[19:35] world judgment can be a wonderful thing
[19:39] you know what matters really
[19:41] is the person rendering the judgment
[19:43] it's the
[19:45] character of the judge
[19:46] determines how
[19:48] he renders his opinion
[19:50] when looking at something you know
[19:52] certainly if you know of a judge that is
[19:55] you know evil or corrupt or you know
[19:58] otherwise not fair it's going to be a
[20:00] fearful thing
[20:01] to commit yourself to his judgment
[20:03] but if you know a judge that is that is
[20:06] fair and just and moral and merciful
[20:09] you're you're willing to commit
[20:11] everything to that judgment
[20:13] and you love it right
[20:14] you know proverbs 29 2
[20:17] says that when the righteous are an
[20:18] authority the people rejoice
[20:21] but when the wicked beareth rule
[20:23] the people mourn
[20:25] and there was a time when david had
[20:27] committed a sin
[20:28] of numbering the people
[20:31] when the prophet kind of came to him
[20:33] with the word of the lord that the lord
[20:34] was not happy with him for that
[20:36] his response in first chronicles 21 13
[20:39] was let me fall now into the hand of the
[20:41] lord
[20:42] for very great are his mercies
[20:45] but let me not fall into the hand of man
[20:48] so all these examples of judgment being
[20:50] potentially a wonderful thing
[20:53] you know there is no other judge i know
[20:55] that be more willing to commit myself to
[20:58] than the chief judge
[20:59] what other judge is there that can look
[21:01] at a situation and say neither do i
[21:03] condemn thee
[21:04] go and sin no more or thy sins are
[21:07] forgiven thee right
[21:09] you know but what's interesting is if we
[21:11] look at psalm 106
[21:13] in verse 3
[21:14] and we're going to be reading out of 106
[21:16] today
[21:18] says david makes an interesting
[21:19] statement he says blessed are they
[21:22] that keep judgment
[21:25] you know so not only is judgment
[21:27] something that you can render or
[21:28] something that you can receive but the
[21:30] scriptures talk about a people
[21:32] who keep judgment
[21:34] you know seven times in the in the
[21:36] children's of israel in their journey
[21:37] across the wilderness the lord instructs
[21:40] them to keep my statutes and my
[21:42] judgments not just the things i say
[21:45] but keep my judgments
[21:47] right
[21:49] you know what's interesting now is we've
[21:50] just talked about how the lord is a
[21:52] righteous judge and that a judgment can
[21:54] be something that's rendered but now the
[21:56] lord talks about committing his judgment
[21:59] to a people
[22:00] now you keep his judgment not just have
[22:03] him be the judge but you keep his
[22:05] judgment think about that the very judge
[22:07] who would look at a people or look at a
[22:09] situation and declare one thing clean or
[22:11] one thing unrighteous now commits
[22:14] judgment to a people for you to keep his
[22:16] judgment for that people to keep his
[22:18] judgment how many times did the first
[22:20] church age messenger say let this mind
[22:22] be in you
[22:24] which was also in christ jesus right
[22:26] beginning to talk about the fact that
[22:28] you judge as he judges
[22:30] right
[22:31] first corinthians 2 16 says for who hath
[22:33] known the mind of the lord that he may
[22:35] instruct him but we
[22:37] have the mind of christ
[22:39] you know and he says later on in first
[22:41] corinthians know ye not that ye shall
[22:42] judge angels
[22:44] how much more things that pertain
[22:47] to this life
[22:49] think how precious it is you know for us
[22:51] who have believed that who whoever
[22:53] received the judgment you never did it
[22:55] in the first place
[22:56] to take it one step further and now he
[22:58] commits judgments to you
[23:01] who are his
[23:02] to judge as he would judge
[23:04] to keep his judgments as it says in
[23:06] psalm 106 3 blessed are they
[23:10] that keep judgment
[23:12] and he that doeth righteousness
[23:14] at all times
[23:16] so as we look at that today you know
[23:18] maybe we could look at judgments just a
[23:20] little bit different than think about
[23:21] the solemn duty that we have
[23:23] to commit ourselves to him for his
[23:25] judgment that he might commit his
[23:27] judgment to us
[23:29] for us to judge as he would judge
[23:31] so what we're going to do is we'll just
[23:32] read the first 12 verses of psalm 106.
[23:34] it's a big one so we'll just read the
[23:36] verse 12 this morning together it says
[23:38] praise ye the lord o give thanks unto
[23:41] the lord for he is good for his mercy
[23:44] endureth forever
[23:46] who can utter the mighty acts of the
[23:48] lord who can show forth all his praise
[23:51] blessed are they that keep judgment and
[23:54] he that doeth righteousness at all times
[23:57] remember me o lord with the favor that
[24:00] thou bearest unto thy people o visit me
[24:03] with thy salvation that i may see the
[24:06] good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in
[24:09] the gladness of thy nation that i make
[24:11] glory with thine inheritance
[24:14] we have sinned with our fathers we have
[24:16] committed iniquity we have done wickedly
[24:19] our fathers understood not thy wonders
[24:22] in egypt they remembered not the
[24:24] multitude of thy mercies but provoked
[24:26] him at the sea
[24:28] even at the red sea
[24:30] nevertheless he saved them for his
[24:32] name's sake that he might make his
[24:34] mighty power to be known he rebuked the
[24:37] red sea also and it was dried up so he
[24:40] led them through the depths as through
[24:42] the wilderness and he saved them with
[24:44] the hand of him that hated them and
[24:47] redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
[24:50] and the waters covered their enemies
[24:52] there was not one of them left
[24:54] then believed they his words they sang
[24:57] his praise
[25:03] amen
[25:04] amen god bless you and have your seats
[25:06] this morning
[25:07] amen
[25:09] let's just worship the lord this morning

[50:19] [Music]
[50:32] our gracious
[50:34] heavenly father our
[50:37] hearts are
[50:40] full of
[50:42] your wonders
[50:44] and your grace and your mercy towards us
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] your tenderness and your kindness and
[50:55] the blessings you've bestowed upon us
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] we marvel that
[51:04] through your goodness you have
[51:06] chosen us and
[51:08] spoke into our hearts and
[51:12] we feel so unworthy coming before you
[51:17] but yet you so graciously invite us into
[51:21] your presence
[51:24] lord how
[51:27] could we ever measure
[51:31] your might in your power
[51:35] but we asked this morning that you would
[51:38] visit the hungry heart today
[51:41] that you would be our portion
[51:44] we ask you to be with us this morning as
[51:46] we come to praise you
[51:49] to exalt your name
[51:51] to speak of your greatness in your
[51:54] goodness
[51:55] to do fellowship in the revelation you
[51:58] have shared with us
[52:00] we ask you to
[52:02] please come
[52:03] [Music]
[52:05] we invite you lord with humble hearts
[52:08] and unworthiness
[52:10] into our presence this morning
[52:13] in your precious name lord jesus we
[52:15] beseech the father amen
[52:19] god bless you may be seated this morning
[52:26] you guys can wait a moment and
[52:30] we're going to have a baby dedication
[52:32] but
[52:33] first of all i'd just like to say that
[52:38] we've
[52:39] instituted a few little
[52:45] procedures i could say are safety
[52:48] procedures because so many of us are
[52:50] wanting to come back together and
[52:53] everything so what we've done is we've
[52:55] just
[52:56] asked us like as far as wearing masks
[52:59] and
[53:00] and i know that all these
[53:02] different things are becoming very
[53:04] controversial and
[53:06] and
[53:08] there's people out there saying now mass
[53:10] doesn't do anything and there's other
[53:12] doctors that say this
[53:14] some say that
[53:17] we bought something
[53:19] thermometers for the church in case
[53:21] anybody
[53:22] wanted to have their
[53:25] temperature checked so we'll have those
[53:27] but then they came out the other day and
[53:30] said that taking temperature is no sign
[53:32] of anything
[53:34] i just think the whole thing's confused
[53:38] and yeah i just really do i don't think
[53:40] that man even knows
[53:42] what they're doing because there's only
[53:45] one truth and that's god's word
[53:48] but so what we
[53:49] but you know to be good neighbors and to
[53:54] put forth an effort uh to
[53:58] keep us as safe as we can we've made a
[54:00] decision that
[54:02] kind of like you do in a restaurant you
[54:05] know you put your mask on you walk five
[54:07] feet to the table you sit down and you
[54:10] take it off
[54:12] and then you have it off while you're
[54:13] eating and then you put it back on and
[54:15] walk out so that's kind of what we're
[54:18] gonna do when we travel
[54:20] in and out of church we'll just put our
[54:22] mask on when you have your seat you can
[54:24] take your mask off
[54:26] we'd like to sit the best we can as
[54:29] family units
[54:31] [Music]
[54:32] and
[54:33] and so
[54:35] am i not on
[54:41] now i'm on so if you didn't hear any of
[54:43] that
[54:44] it's okay
[54:45] anyway wear masks going in and out just
[54:47] like a restaurant
[54:49] sit with your family as much as possible
[54:53] you might be a teenager and can't stand
[54:55] to sit with your family then i could
[54:56] understand that
[54:58] like my kids they used to sit away and
[55:01] and uh
[55:03] but everybody would walk up to him and
[55:04] say you're a mcgarry aren't you
[55:07] and they're like how do they know that
[55:10] you know and so you know we know who
[55:12] your family is so you sit with them if
[55:14] you can
[55:16] sanitize your hands as often as you can
[55:19] if you come in and out of the bathroom
[55:21] sanitize your hands
[55:23] if you don't want to touch anything just
[55:25] feel free to wear gloves feel free to
[55:27] wear a mask in the congregation
[55:30] and outside you know you don't have to
[55:32] wear a mask outside if you feel like you
[55:35] want to wear a mask outside try to say
[55:38] for
[55:38] you know
[55:39] four to six feet apart
[55:42] try not to shake hands or hug one
[55:44] another if you can help it
[55:47] if you can't help it i understand it's
[55:49] instinctively to me when i see a brother
[55:52] i just give him a hug you know i don't
[55:55] ask if he's infected first
[55:57] or if he has any symptoms and i don't
[56:00] walk up and take his temperature
[56:03] but also we don't want to
[56:06] be irresponsible
[56:08] like there's not a problem
[56:10] and a lot of people are having problems
[56:13] and
[56:14] i don't know why some are and some
[56:17] aren't
[56:18] but
[56:18] we want to show respect so
[56:21] um
[56:22] that's what um
[56:25] we'll kind of sort of
[56:27] cover that but now it's the good part
[56:30] we have a baby dedication
[56:33] and and uh
[56:35] and
[56:36] you know i i guess it's pretty obvious
[56:39] my love for brother billy but we're
[56:40] gonna we're gonna

[1:02:22] everybody this morning
[1:02:25] uh we love the lord this morning don't
[1:02:27] we all love the lord
[1:02:28] amen we want to
[1:02:32] have a
[1:02:34] little
[1:02:35] bible study and and you know sometimes
[1:02:38] you have things on your heart
[1:02:41] and you don't
[1:02:45] you sense
[1:02:46] they're there but you have no idea
[1:02:50] what it is
[1:02:52] it's sort of maybe sometimes it's an
[1:02:54] emptiness
[1:02:56] or it's a
[1:02:58] longing of some sort or
[1:03:01] you just feel that there's uh
[1:03:05] something missing and
[1:03:07] so you begin to listen
[1:03:10] and uh
[1:03:11] you you you start to
[1:03:14] watch and you start to listen and you
[1:03:16] start to
[1:03:17] to feel you're you're you're trying to
[1:03:20] make contact with something
[1:03:22] that uh looks uh to give you a uh
[1:03:27] some sort of leadership or a message and
[1:03:30] i kind of had that emptiness
[1:03:33] in my heart and
[1:03:35] the other day at the men's meeting
[1:03:38] some comments were made and it stirred
[1:03:41] me up
[1:03:43] i i was brought to this message that
[1:03:46] um
[1:03:49] is
[1:03:51] really i think a timely message if if
[1:03:54] the lord will open it up to us
[1:03:57] and we could just take a few moments on
[1:04:01] on
[1:04:03] on
[1:04:04] uh studying it if we could
[1:04:08] uh i certainly have not the ability to
[1:04:13] preach what's in this message it
[1:04:16] it it would take me years
[1:04:18] and years to
[1:04:20] do it but just if we could take it from
[1:04:23] the general
[1:04:25] concept of it because so i want to
[1:04:28] listen this morning
[1:04:30] to the first uh
[1:04:32] 20 minutes
[1:04:34] of the message called thirst
[1:04:37] and
[1:04:39] again i i believe something in my heart
[1:04:43] about
[1:04:44] the message and the messenger
[1:04:48] that not only did he make specific
[1:04:51] statements
[1:04:52] but he also revealed if i could say that
[1:04:56] principles
[1:04:58] of how that god works
[1:05:01] and and it was spoken to open our
[1:05:04] understanding
[1:05:06] and in to enlighten us
[1:05:08] concerning the things of the lord
[1:05:12] and as you listen to brother branham
[1:05:16] break this he begins to talk about
[1:05:19] thirst
[1:05:20] and what thirst is
[1:05:23] it's an aching desire
[1:05:26] but i i hope that in
[1:05:28] our listening to this that we can
[1:05:31] understand what the prophet of god the
[1:05:34] concept that he's trying to
[1:05:37] bring to us is that god made us
[1:05:40] to thirst
[1:05:43] he made us to hunger
[1:05:45] he placed something in us
[1:05:48] and he calls it a warning
[1:05:53] system
[1:05:54] and we just listened last week to the
[1:05:57] warning
[1:05:58] and then
[1:05:59] the judgment god does does not
[1:06:03] judge a man without warning him first
[1:06:06] and we talked about being aware of that
[1:06:13] of that warning to understand that
[1:06:16] that everything that's going on has a
[1:06:18] purpose behind it
[1:06:20] and it it should be a warning to us
[1:06:24] it should be a warning to us that man
[1:06:26] doesn't have control over things the way
[1:06:29] he thinks things are moving rapidly
[1:06:33] in a lot of different directions
[1:06:36] things are transpiring that we didn't
[1:06:39] feel would ever transpire
[1:06:41] and so so we don't want to be negligent
[1:06:47] in our responsibility
[1:06:50] and so we talked about that last week
[1:06:52] that we have a responsibility
[1:06:55] to seek and pursue
[1:07:00] that we're here for
[1:07:02] and so we want to continue sort of on
[1:07:04] those same thoughts i i notice uh that
[1:07:07] judith i believe her uncle and some of
[1:07:09] her nephews are here we welcome them
[1:07:12] brother sanders i see you god bless you
[1:07:14] this morning and anyone here that we
[1:07:16] don't miss so we're going to listen for
[1:07:18] 20 minutes to
[1:07:21] a
[1:07:22] thirst and this was preached in
[1:07:26] in 1960
[1:07:28] 919
[1:07:30] so
[1:07:31] it's not
[1:07:32] it's not too
[1:07:34] uh
[1:07:36] uh
[1:07:37] long before the prophet of god left the
[1:07:40] scene
[1:07:41] and i believe that it's before he left
[1:07:43] the scene he i i just he said
[1:07:47] that
[1:07:48] no a man knows that he's fixing to go
[1:07:53] and i honestly believe that brother
[1:07:55] branham knew that his time
[1:07:57] had come
[1:07:59] he may not have known how that he's
[1:08:01] going to go
[1:08:02] even though i've heard
[1:08:05] people tell me that
[1:08:07] brother brennan made comments
[1:08:11] concerning the fact that it might
[1:08:13] possibly be an auto accident that would
[1:08:18] take his life
[1:08:19] but i i
[1:08:22] with that knowing that he must have
[1:08:24] known that
[1:08:26] he made a great effort to make sure that
[1:08:28] his message was put out there
[1:08:32] he put two messages in the last
[1:08:35] six months if i could say
[1:08:38] of his time on earth that are very
[1:08:43] hand in hand
[1:08:45] and it was leadership
[1:08:48] and thirst
[1:08:51] and so as we listen to this we we've got
[1:08:54] to come back to the
[1:08:56] point that
[1:08:58] we are not
[1:08:59] taking this message as academia
[1:09:03] it is
[1:09:04] not a finished
[1:09:08] message now let me say this all the way
[1:09:11] through
[1:09:12] it's not
[1:09:14] a finished message that's done with
[1:09:17] and is left there to study
[1:09:21] it is a living message
[1:09:24] that is still
[1:09:26] leading us
[1:09:28] and guiding us
[1:09:29] if we will listen to it
[1:09:32] if we will approach it
[1:09:34] uh
[1:09:35] that's why that i like to play a portion
[1:09:38] of the of of the message because we want
[1:09:41] to go to the source that's leading us
[1:09:45] and i i just don't want to be one that
[1:09:48] would
[1:09:49] always give you my revelation and i can
[1:09:53] only preach to you my revelation
[1:09:56] i can't preach to you brother random's
[1:09:58] left revelation i can only tell you what
[1:10:01] he said
[1:10:02] but it's still an individual affair
[1:10:05] and so as we listen to this he's talking
[1:10:08] about
[1:10:09] this thirst and another place he talked
[1:10:12] about leadership so i think it's
[1:10:15] something that we should deeply consider
[1:10:18] and ask ourselves
[1:10:21] is this working in my life
[1:10:24] and so from that standpoint that we want
[1:10:27] to
[1:10:28] go forward from here so
[1:10:31] if the brothers would prepare we're
[1:10:33] going to start at where brother branham
[1:10:35] reads his scripture
[1:10:39] i guess i left my glasses somewhere
[1:10:42] um
[1:10:44] anyway could you see if i have a pair of
[1:10:46] glasses back there
[1:10:47] uh but it's uh in in paragraph
[1:10:58] i i think it's paragraph 17 if i'm not
[1:11:02] mistaken thank you
[1:11:04] paragraph 17
[1:11:06] in the message and he's going to read
[1:11:08] the scripture
[1:11:10] uh found in um
[1:11:14] uh
[1:11:16] psalms i believe it's
[1:11:18] 42. so
[1:11:19] what we'll do
[1:11:21] is yeah paragraph 17. so what we'll do
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:26] we'll stand and then when he's done
[1:11:29] reading the scripture
[1:11:33] then we will
[1:11:35] be seated when he says i think david
[1:11:38] in the writing of this psalm
[1:11:41] must have been in distress
[1:11:44] so when he makes that statement so let
[1:11:46] us go ahead and stand and have a word of
[1:11:49] prayer
[1:11:50] and let's listen closely
[1:11:52] for the next uh
[1:11:55] um
[1:11:57] 20 minutes
[1:11:58] to our messenger as he begins to bring
[1:12:01] us
[1:12:02] the the concept
[1:12:05] and the understanding of the thirst that
[1:12:08] god put
[1:12:10] in a man's heart and
[1:12:15] so
[1:12:16] we'll ask the lord to bless us
[1:12:19] father
[1:12:20] bless blesses this morning with the
[1:12:22] hearing of this
[1:12:25] portion of your word
[1:12:27] father we could certainly sit and listen
[1:12:31] to the whole message
[1:12:35] and we still
[1:12:37] would never comprehend
[1:12:40] all that
[1:12:42] is
[1:12:43] there
[1:12:45] because it is you and your eternal
[1:12:49] but we asked this morning that
[1:12:51] you would speak to us and that you would
[1:12:53] enlighten our understanding
[1:12:56] that you would increase your word to us
[1:13:00] and father that by listening it might
[1:13:02] resonate something within us and
[1:13:06] as we hear what it is that he's trying
[1:13:09] to tell us
[1:13:12] what it is that we should be conscious
[1:13:14] of
[1:13:15] and aware of
[1:13:17] what it is he's trying to enlighten us
[1:13:19] and show us and
[1:13:21] and
[1:13:22] bring us to see
[1:13:25] because it is beneficial for us and
[1:13:27] we're needy of it
[1:13:29] so we ask you to bless this word to us
[1:13:31] this morning
[1:13:33] you've anointed it
[1:13:36] you've
[1:13:37] sent it to be spoken just the way it was
[1:13:40] spoken
[1:13:41] now we ask that you would anoint our
[1:13:44] ears
[1:13:45] that we would hear it just the way that
[1:13:47] you intended for us to hear it
[1:13:50] we ask this in jesus name we pray
[1:13:53] amen god bless you i'm sure you'll enjoy
[1:13:56] the next few moments
[1:14:03] now many of you like to kind of look
[1:14:05] into the bible where a minister is
[1:14:07] reading and i want to read tonight a
[1:14:10] couple three verses out of the psalms
[1:14:12] psalms 42
[1:14:14] just for a way of having a text
[1:14:17] and i've got some scriptures written out
[1:14:18] here and i want to refer to them if i
[1:14:21] can as we go along in a next few minutes
[1:14:24] to speak on this subject
[1:14:26] the psalm of david david wrote the
[1:14:28] psalms now while you're turning i might
[1:14:30] say this many people say well is the
[1:14:33] psalms inspired certainly they are
[1:14:36] they're anything it's it's uh this bible
[1:14:39] is inspired whether it's history whether
[1:14:41] it's songs whatever it is it's inspired
[1:14:44] jesus said have not you read what david
[1:14:47] said in the psalms
[1:14:49] and then i think psalms of course is
[1:14:51] songs and if songs are inspired of god
[1:14:55] which i believe they are and prophetic
[1:14:57] also
[1:14:58] i hope i'm standing that day when this
[1:15:00] song comes to pass there's going to be a
[1:15:03] meeting in the air in that sweet sweet
[1:15:06] by and by
[1:15:07] going to meet you and greet you over
[1:15:09] there in that home beyond the sky
[1:15:12] such singing ever heard ever heard by
[1:15:14] mortal ears it'll be glorious i do
[1:15:17] declare
[1:15:18] and god's own son will be the leading
[1:15:20] one at that meeting in the air
[1:15:22] oh i i want to be there at that time now
[1:15:26] psalms uh 42
[1:15:30] as the heart painteth
[1:15:32] after the water brooks
[1:15:35] soul painteth my soul after thee o god
[1:15:39] my soul thirst for god for the living
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:43] when shall i come and appear before god
[1:15:48] my
[1:15:48] tears have been my meat
[1:15:51] day and night why am i
[1:15:53] what are they continually saying to me
[1:15:55] where is thy god
[1:15:59] i think david in the writing
[1:16:02] of this psalm
[1:16:04] must have been in distress
[1:16:06] and it usually takes distress to bring
[1:16:09] the best out of a man
[1:16:11] and really
[1:16:12] uh that's when god
[1:16:15] gets down to when we fast many times to
[1:16:17] get herself in position and get herself
[1:16:20] out of the way and i think when david
[1:16:22] got in these places
[1:16:24] then he began to meditate on the lord
[1:16:28] begin to think about the things many
[1:16:30] times
[1:16:31] god gets us in
[1:16:32] tight corners where we have to look up
[1:16:35] sometimes we even have to get on our
[1:16:37] back in the hospital or a bed somewhere
[1:16:40] so we can look up to see where the great
[1:16:43] blessings of god comes from now the word
[1:16:46] i want to speak from tonight one word
[1:16:48] out of the bible and that is found in
[1:16:50] the second verse uh thirst
[1:16:54] the word of thirst
[1:16:56] i was looking in the dictionary when i
[1:16:58] was looking up this word i was thinking
[1:17:00] about a sermon one time i preached on uh
[1:17:04] thirsting after life
[1:17:06] and uh talking all the psalms too when
[1:17:08] david said thy statues i believe are
[1:17:11] more precious to me than life now i was
[1:17:13] looking and thinking about that word
[1:17:15] thirst so i looked up in the dictionary
[1:17:16] to see what it means and here's what
[1:17:19] webster says it's a painful
[1:17:22] desire
[1:17:23] a painful when you want something so bad
[1:17:26] until it becomes painful to you uh
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:32] uh that's uh
[1:17:33] it's not an unnatural thing to thirst
[1:17:37] thirst is a a natural thing it's just
[1:17:40] simply something that god has given us
[1:17:42] that we could to give us a
[1:17:45] desire for something
[1:17:47] sometimes god has
[1:17:50] also has given you a a control tower
[1:17:54] something that sets inside of you that
[1:17:57] that controls these different desires
[1:18:00] and this uh thirst this control tower
[1:18:03] that sits in a man's heart
[1:18:06] is something that god give him to
[1:18:08] to
[1:18:09] warn him of the desires that's needful
[1:18:12] for him now there is two different kinds
[1:18:15] of thirst there is a thirst physically
[1:18:18] and there is a thirst also spiritually i
[1:18:22] would like to read this what david said
[1:18:24] again
[1:18:25] my soul thirst for god for the living
[1:18:29] god
[1:18:30] not some historical or some something
[1:18:33] that happened some years ago or or some
[1:18:37] tale that someone told but for the
[1:18:39] living
[1:18:40] god
[1:18:41] a god that's ever present
[1:18:44] and his soul thirsted for that god
[1:18:47] not for some historical something now we
[1:18:50] find
[1:18:51] god gives the control tower to you to
[1:18:54] give to you
[1:18:55] the things that you
[1:18:58] need now the control tower in you is
[1:19:00] what directs you
[1:19:02] and this thirst runs in on this cold uh
[1:19:04] control tower and tells you what you
[1:19:06] have need of spiritually speaking the
[1:19:09] control tower in the body and in the
[1:19:11] soul also
[1:19:13] there's a control power in the body that
[1:19:16] tells you the need that's needed in your
[1:19:18] body
[1:19:19] and it's brought to you by thirst
[1:19:23] also there's a control tower in your
[1:19:25] soul
[1:19:26] that tells you the spiritual things that
[1:19:28] you have need of
[1:19:30] something in your spirit
[1:19:31] and
[1:19:32] and you by this can tell what kind of a
[1:19:35] life is controlling you when you uh when
[1:19:39] you can see what your desires are
[1:19:42] then you can tell but that what kind of
[1:19:46] something is in you that's creating this
[1:19:48] desire that you have
[1:19:50] see there's a certain thing that you
[1:19:52] thirst for
[1:19:53] and it and it can tell you in your soul
[1:19:56] what this desire is by the nature of the
[1:19:59] thirst that you have
[1:20:01] i hope that's you can understand that
[1:20:04] there is a
[1:20:05] control tower of the soul and one for
[1:20:07] the body and each tower is a warning
[1:20:11] collar for the needs of the other
[1:20:15] each one
[1:20:16] calls to the need for what the caller is
[1:20:19] calling for it sends out a wave of
[1:20:21] warning
[1:20:23] for instance the flesh
[1:20:25] thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in
[1:20:28] the body
[1:20:30] and the spirit uh desires for the things
[1:20:33] that's in the soul desire is and many
[1:20:37] times these war one against the other
[1:20:41] we find there
[1:20:43] what's the a great trouble to date that
[1:20:46] too many
[1:20:47] people
[1:20:49] try to live between those two desires
[1:20:53] for one of them desires the things of
[1:20:55] the earth the other desires the things
[1:20:58] of heaven like paul said describes it in
[1:21:00] romans 7 21
[1:21:02] when i would do good then evil is not
[1:21:06] when you try did you ever have that
[1:21:08] inexperienced christians that when
[1:21:10] you're trying to do something that's
[1:21:12] worthwhile
[1:21:14] going to make an effort to do something
[1:21:16] that's good then you find out that there
[1:21:19] is the devil on every hand just to upset
[1:21:21] you everything that you'd and that's one
[1:21:24] good thing
[1:21:25] that i'd like to uh say this
[1:21:29] at the christians might know
[1:21:31] that when you're
[1:21:33] when you're starting to do something and
[1:21:36] there's something always trying to upset
[1:21:38] you and doing it do it anyhow
[1:21:40] that's the devil they're trying to keep
[1:21:42] you from doing what's right
[1:21:44] now many times
[1:21:46] i meet people it's prone to be a little
[1:21:48] nervous
[1:21:49] when they find out that they're trying
[1:21:51] to do something and and everything's
[1:21:53] just blocking it off on both sides and
[1:21:55] say it might not been the will of the
[1:21:57] lord see
[1:21:59] uh don't let the devil lie to you like
[1:22:01] that the first thing is find out whether
[1:22:04] it's the will of god or not
[1:22:06] and then
[1:22:08] if you want to know what's the will of
[1:22:09] god look into the bible
[1:22:11] there is a thing that's
[1:22:13] that sets you straight is the word of
[1:22:16] god
[1:22:16] and then if you see it's in the word of
[1:22:19] god for you to do it
[1:22:21] like phrases seeking for the baptism of
[1:22:22] the holy ghost many times i've run into
[1:22:25] people say well i sought for the holy
[1:22:27] ghost
[1:22:28] and i just couldn't receive it i don't
[1:22:30] believe it's for me every time i get
[1:22:33] down i get sick and i go to praying if i
[1:22:36] fast i get sick and if i try to uh stay
[1:22:39] all nighter against the sleepy i i can't
[1:22:41] get off my feet remember
[1:22:43] that is the devil
[1:22:45] because god intends for you to have the
[1:22:47] holy spirit is for whosoever will
[1:22:50] many times you find
[1:22:52] when you're prayed for in a meeting for
[1:22:54] divine healing
[1:22:56] then the next day you find out no doubt
[1:22:58] that the devil will make that twice as
[1:23:00] bad as it was the day before
[1:23:02] see remember that's just satan trying to
[1:23:05] get you away from the blessing that
[1:23:07] god's got for you
[1:23:09] don't you listen to that fella so you
[1:23:11] always press right on
[1:23:14] i had an experience of that just
[1:23:15] recently on the road to africa if i ever
[1:23:18] had any time that the devil ever did
[1:23:21] press at me was to go to africa this
[1:23:23] last time it become one of the
[1:23:25] finest meetings and times that i ever
[1:23:28] went overseas i got i believe more
[1:23:31] things accomplished in that little time
[1:23:33] that i was there besides my hunting trip
[1:23:35] than i ever did at any time i always
[1:23:39] thought that those churches didn't want
[1:23:41] me there and come to find out i had a
[1:23:43] letter from someone that it was uh
[1:23:45] oh they didn't want me there all the
[1:23:47] association had found out it was one man
[1:23:49] with a letter head from an organization
[1:23:52] that said we don't want you he meant him
[1:23:54] and his family see so then when i got
[1:23:58] over there i think he just we that was
[1:24:00] he and his family and it wasn't the
[1:24:02] people at all so now it's a great field
[1:24:05] open up for us to see what paul said
[1:24:07] when i would do good than evil is not
[1:24:10] you let a young convert come tonight to
[1:24:13] the altar of somewhere here and this
[1:24:15] tabernacle are are out across the nation
[1:24:18] and just remember tomorrow
[1:24:20] mother will be more angry she ever was
[1:24:23] dad will be all upset and all the school
[1:24:25] kids and everything just goes wrong
[1:24:27] because it's satan trying to get you to
[1:24:30] turn around
[1:24:31] he's trying to run you off the path when
[1:24:33] i would do
[1:24:35] good then evil is always not now let us
[1:24:39] look at the thirst and let's see whether
[1:24:42] actually a thirst is a natural thing
[1:24:44] i've had people tell me oh i never did i
[1:24:47] believe it's just for some people to
[1:24:49] want to be christians oh no that's wrong
[1:24:52] it's actually a something that's
[1:24:54] associated with every human being
[1:24:56] it certainly is true when we come to
[1:24:59] this country in the early days we found
[1:25:01] the indian chair
[1:25:02] and the indians don't they were heathen
[1:25:05] at that time they worshiped the sun or
[1:25:07] something as long as they are human
[1:25:11] there's something in them a natural
[1:25:13] thirst calling out for god somewhere
[1:25:17] back in the jungles just recently back
[1:25:20] there uh 480 miles from the closest
[1:25:23] civilization a little small town of
[1:25:25] about three thousand people at vira and
[1:25:27] mozambique we found natives that didn't
[1:25:30] even never seen a white person
[1:25:33] uh found a native girl she had no
[1:25:36] clothes on any of them harley have
[1:25:38] clothes on she was sitting up in a tree
[1:25:40] and i was tracking a line and there was
[1:25:42] i heard something like a human being
[1:25:44] screaming this native girl sitting up
[1:25:46] there
[1:25:47] walleyed holding a baby
[1:25:49] and what she was scared about
[1:25:51] that's your only protections get up a
[1:25:53] tree from a lion leopard or something or
[1:25:55] some animal and she'd see me and heard
[1:25:59] it was a human being but when she looked
[1:26:01] and seen a white person she had never
[1:26:02] seen one in her life see and she was
[1:26:04] scared to death
[1:26:06] see but when we find those people even
[1:26:08] in that primitive condition
[1:26:10] back there they were still
[1:26:12] worshiping
[1:26:14] before we called the lion in they poured
[1:26:16] out some mealy meal that's what they eat
[1:26:18] on a little leaf and clapped their hands
[1:26:20] and called on the spirit of some great
[1:26:23] something they didn't know where
[1:26:25] like a patron saint or something to a
[1:26:27] catholic to protect them that they
[1:26:29] wouldn't be uh killed during the time of
[1:26:32] the charge of this line
[1:26:34] see it's something natural
[1:26:37] it's not an unnatural thing to thirst
[1:26:39] for god
[1:26:41] it's a natural thing
[1:26:42] it's just something that you should do
[1:26:44] god has made you up like that and it's
[1:26:47] no
[1:26:48] superhuman it's just actually a common
[1:26:52] human being it ain't just special for
[1:26:54] some people they say well i've seen some
[1:26:56] people live such a
[1:26:58] victorious life if they're constantly on
[1:27:00] the housetop they're praising god wish i
[1:27:02] could feel that way well
[1:27:04] the reason you're feeling that way it's
[1:27:06] a thirst in you
[1:27:08] and uh that's just a natural thing it's
[1:27:10] for every person to thirst for god
[1:27:14] now we'll take some of the natural
[1:27:15] thirsties first let's take for instance
[1:27:17] thirsting for water as david said you're
[1:27:20] thirsting for the water thirsting for
[1:27:22] water the body is in need of water
[1:27:27] and if you don't supply that thirst
[1:27:30] you'll perish
[1:27:32] you'll dehydrate
[1:27:34] and you'll the you won't live
[1:27:36] if you can't get water
[1:27:39] to that thirst to quench that thirst of
[1:27:41] the natural body
[1:27:43] you'll soon perish
[1:27:45] you won't live long you can live longer
[1:27:47] without food than you can without water
[1:27:50] because you can fast for 40 days jesus
[1:27:54] did i suppose without without food but
[1:27:56] you couldn't do that long without water
[1:27:59] you would just simply dry up and die you
[1:28:01] must have a water and if in the thirst
[1:28:05] that comes on you well it's to show that
[1:28:08] the body is in need of something to keep
[1:28:11] it alive
[1:28:13] the body's got to have the water in
[1:28:16] order to stay alive
[1:28:18] you're 80 something percent uh water and
[1:28:20] petroleum anyhow and you've got to take
[1:28:23] these sources in to keep you alive as
[1:28:27] i've said if you neglect it you'll
[1:28:29] perish
[1:28:31] the thirst also is an alarm
[1:28:35] it's an alarm clock
[1:28:37] that thirsting the soul sets off alarm
[1:28:40] clock a little buzzer inside of you that
[1:28:43] tells you that death
[1:28:46] has
[1:28:46] lurking now
[1:28:48] that if you don't get water pretty soon
[1:28:51] you've got to die
[1:28:53] and it gets louder and louder until
[1:28:56] finally you keep putting it off and
[1:28:59] you'll die
[1:29:00] because it's alarm clock like david
[1:29:02] described it here in the psalms as a
[1:29:04] heart painteth after the water brooks
[1:29:09] soul
[1:29:10] painteth my soul after thee oh god
[1:29:15] as the heart painteth after the water
[1:29:18] book
[1:29:19] i've often thought
[1:29:21] as
[1:29:22] reading of this of david
[1:29:24] david was a woodsman a hunter
[1:29:27] and he hunted deer of course and
[1:29:30] many uh
[1:29:31] we in this day hunt them the heart is a
[1:29:33] deer
[1:29:34] and we find
[1:29:36] if you ever seen the dogs the wild dogs
[1:29:39] or grab a deer
[1:29:41] and uh usually they got like the coyote
[1:29:43] fang
[1:29:44] and he can grab the deer right above the
[1:29:47] bur the ear here and swing his weight he
[1:29:49] cuts the throat of the deer and the deer
[1:29:52] doesn't have a chance then
[1:29:54] but sometimes the
[1:29:56] the dog like in africa there the wild
[1:29:58] dog will grab the deer right in the
[1:30:00] flanks if he misses the throat he'll
[1:30:03] grab the second time at the flank
[1:30:05] and if the deer is strong enough and
[1:30:07] quick enough he can shake the dog off
[1:30:10] the deer is much faster the dog stalks
[1:30:13] him when he's not looking and when he's
[1:30:16] upwind from him and and he uh you don't
[1:30:19] know the the dog is near and then when
[1:30:21] the wild dog grabs him if he's real
[1:30:23] quick he can throw it all
[1:30:25] and but when the dog comes out of the
[1:30:27] flank he's got a whole mouthful of the
[1:30:29] deer's flesh or when he grabs at his
[1:30:32] neck sometimes he'll cut close to the
[1:30:34] jugger vein and miss it and the deer
[1:30:36] shaking him will pull a whole chunk of
[1:30:39] meat out of the deer's throat then the
[1:30:42] blood begins to run
[1:30:43] and then the dog will come right on the
[1:30:46] trail of that blood after the deer and
[1:30:48] as the life of the deer begins to
[1:30:51] dwindle as the blood which is a life
[1:30:55] stream to the body as that begins to
[1:30:57] dwindle down the deer gets weaker and
[1:31:00] the dog dan or the wolf is right behind
[1:31:04] the deer
[1:31:05] now
[1:31:06] if that deer can't find water
[1:31:09] now water
[1:31:11] has something in it that when the deer
[1:31:12] drinks the water it stops the bleeding
[1:31:15] but if he don't get water to cool him
[1:31:18] off then the
[1:31:20] blood keeps flowing out faster because
[1:31:22] he's running keeping his heart pumping
[1:31:24] but if he can ever get to water the deer
[1:31:28] will live
[1:31:29] now there's a great lesson there
[1:31:32] see
[1:31:32] david's saying here as the heart
[1:31:35] painteth fall of water broke
[1:31:38] my soul painteth for thee oh god
[1:31:42] now that deer knows
[1:31:45] unless he finds water he's gone
[1:31:49] he just can't live i've tracked him many
[1:31:52] times after being wounded when he hits a
[1:31:54] stream of water he'll cross in and get a
[1:31:56] drink go up over the hill come back down
[1:31:58] cross get a break of water and go up
[1:32:01] you'll never catch up with him as long
[1:32:03] as he'll follow that stream but once
[1:32:05] when he leaves the stream if he can't
[1:32:07] find another water brook somewhere
[1:32:09] you'll catch him right away
[1:32:11] and now the deer knows that so he'll
[1:32:12] stay right with the water where he can
[1:32:14] get to it right quick
[1:32:15] how could you imagine
[1:32:17] a deer
[1:32:19] with his nose up he's been caught out
[1:32:21] somewhere where there's no water
[1:32:23] and he says as the heart
[1:32:26] thirsts or painteth is the thirst
[1:32:30] after the water brooks
[1:32:32] my soul thirsts after thee o god
[1:32:36] unless i can find you lord i'll perish
[1:32:40] i i can't go
[1:32:43] unless i find you
[1:32:45] and when a man or woman boy or girl gets
[1:32:49] that kind of a thirst for god he's going
[1:32:52] to find something i think but when we
[1:32:54] come at it just kind of halfway well
[1:32:57] i'll kneel down and see what lord does
[1:32:59] see you're not really thirsting yet it's
[1:33:02] got to be a thirst between death and
[1:33:05] life
[1:33:06] and then something takes place
[1:33:08] the deer also here he's uh we find uh
[1:33:12] and he is also has another sense of
[1:33:15] smell that sets off an alarm in him when
[1:33:18] his enemy is near
[1:33:20] he's possessed this uh little creature
[1:33:23] with a sense to protect himself
[1:33:26] and he's uh he's got a little alarm in
[1:33:29] him a little something that he tickles
[1:33:31] his nose
[1:33:32] one of the enemies near
[1:33:34] you can get in the wind of the enemy
[1:33:37] and
[1:33:38] he knows that you're there and he's gone
[1:33:39] sometimes a half a mile away he can
[1:33:42] smell you and get away or the wolf or
[1:33:44] any danger he's able to sense it because
[1:33:48] that he's made up that way
[1:33:50] he's a deer by nature
[1:33:53] and that sense in him is just one of the
[1:33:56] god giving senses to him to
[1:34:00] live by
[1:34:01] and i know i thought comparing the deer
[1:34:04] with a man that's thirsting for god
[1:34:07] before the enemy gets there there's
[1:34:09] something about a child of god
[1:34:11] that when you once are born into the
[1:34:14] spirit of god receive the baptism of the
[1:34:16] holy spirit there's something about the
[1:34:19] person that can sense the enemy
[1:34:22] you can take a man when he's taken the
[1:34:24] scripture and reading the scripture and
[1:34:26] trying to inject something to that
[1:34:29] scripture that's contrary to the
[1:34:31] scripture a man that's filled with the
[1:34:33] holy ghost can sense that right quick
[1:34:35] there's something out of the way
[1:34:37] when he gets into a place and and uh
[1:34:40] that little
[1:34:41] certain sense in there that uh it's done
[1:34:44] to protect your life you you mustn't you
[1:34:47] must never go for anything unless it's
[1:34:49] exactly the word of god you must stay
[1:34:52] right exactly with that word and now and
[1:34:55] we are uh
[1:34:57] secured
[1:34:59] with that sense as long as we're in the
[1:35:01] holy spirit you can go to reading like
[1:35:04] for instance somebody say now go to read
[1:35:06] mark 16 and say and these signs shall
[1:35:09] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:35:11] shall cast out devils they shall speak
[1:35:14] with new tongues or take up serpents or
[1:35:15] drink deadly things it will not harm
[1:35:18] them if they lay their hands on the sick
[1:35:20] they shall recover
[1:35:22] now then you find a person get up there
[1:35:24] and say now that was far the apostolic
[1:35:28] age
[1:35:29] that now right quick if you have
[1:35:31] received the holy spirit you've been
[1:35:34] endowed with that sense
[1:35:37] it sets it off there's something wrong
[1:35:38] there
[1:35:40] see you try to explain it away that's
[1:35:43] for another day that really you don't
[1:35:45] need those things today
[1:35:48] but jesus said these signs
[1:35:51] shall
[1:35:52] follow them that believe
[1:35:54] there's a little
[1:35:55] something sets off in your little buzzer
[1:35:58] and knowing that that's wrong
[1:36:00] and that's the way of death
[1:36:02] because jesus said if we add one word to
[1:36:05] this or take one word from it our parts
[1:36:07] taken out of the book of life not one
[1:36:10] scripture we must take it just the way
[1:36:12] it's written
[1:36:14] and god watches over his word to perform
[1:36:16] it and we know that's got to be just
[1:36:18] right so therefore no matter what a
[1:36:21] church would say what anyone else would
[1:36:23] say if you're born of the spirit of god
[1:36:26] you become part of the bible
[1:36:29] god told ezekiel he the prophet he said
[1:36:32] take the scroll and eat it
[1:36:34] then the prophet and the scroll became
[1:36:37] part of each other
[1:36:38] and that's the believer when he receives
[1:36:40] the holy spirit the holy spirit wrote
[1:36:43] the bible and the spirit of god is the
[1:36:46] word of god my words are spirit in the
[1:36:48] beginning was the word the word is with
[1:36:50] god and the word was god and the word
[1:36:52] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:36:54] hebrews 13 80 is the same yesterday
[1:36:56] today and forever and when you are a
[1:36:59] part of that word
[1:37:03] oh
[1:37:04] then let something come up contrary to
[1:37:07] that work because the little buzzer sets
[1:37:09] off right quick see it's to warn ya that
[1:37:12] death is in the road
[1:37:14] we should never do that
[1:37:15] there is a also these thirsts are just
[1:37:18] natural
[1:37:19] they are natural for the christian
[1:37:22] they are natural for the human being
[1:37:26] now you'll have to go home and finish
[1:37:30] amen let's just take a moment and
[1:37:38] just meditate a little bit
[1:37:40] on
[1:37:41] some of the things
[1:37:44] that were spoken
[1:37:46] there's many more things
[1:37:49] that were
[1:37:51] spoken
[1:37:52] but
[1:37:53] he talked about
[1:37:55] when
[1:37:56] uh
[1:37:57] there's something about a child of god
[1:37:59] once he's born of the spirit of god
[1:38:02] receives the hat baptism the holy spirit
[1:38:05] there's something about that person
[1:38:09] and he talks about that could sense the
[1:38:11] enemy
[1:38:12] he talked about there's something about
[1:38:14] that
[1:38:15] person that
[1:38:17] they know what's right
[1:38:19] and they they know what's wrong um
[1:38:23] and he begins to talk about that thirst
[1:38:26] and he says then that thirst comes down
[1:38:29] it says
[1:38:30] he says he says we find a person get up
[1:38:33] and say now that was the apostolic age
[1:38:37] that's not
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:39] quick if you have received the holy
[1:38:41] spirit
[1:38:42] you've been endowed with that sense
[1:38:46] it sets it off
[1:38:48] and there's something wrong there
[1:38:51] they're trying to explain it away
[1:38:54] that's for another day
[1:38:56] that really
[1:38:57] you don't
[1:38:58] need
[1:38:59] those things today but jesus says these
[1:39:02] signs shall follow them that believe see
[1:39:05] there's a little something set off in
[1:39:07] you
[1:39:08] a little buzzard you knowing that's
[1:39:11] wrong and that's the way of death
[1:39:16] now that that's what we want to just
[1:39:18] fellowship
[1:39:19] a little bit about this morning
[1:39:22] is if i could say it is that buzzard
[1:39:27] it's that alarm
[1:39:29] in our hearts it's that thirst that we
[1:39:33] have now you just heard how he talked
[1:39:35] about every man has got something in him
[1:39:39] that he he's that he's thirsting
[1:39:43] after
[1:39:46] something
[1:39:48] okay it's a natural thirst in him or a
[1:39:52] hunger or a painful
[1:39:54] desire
[1:39:55] and we as children of god and david
[1:39:59] being a child of god he hungered after
[1:40:01] the reality of god
[1:40:04] and i believe that our thirst in this
[1:40:08] day
[1:40:09] comes from
[1:40:10] what's promised to us
[1:40:13] in this day
[1:40:15] a man
[1:40:16] hungers and thirst after that which god
[1:40:20] provided
[1:40:22] we know that principle in the message
[1:40:25] deep calleth to the a deep
[1:40:28] in other words that deer could have
[1:40:29] never went after water if there wasn't
[1:40:32] water for him to go after
[1:40:36] it
[1:40:36] isn't that
[1:40:38] correct so
[1:40:42] excuse me i got to get this open
[1:40:47] i can't let my wife see me open it the
[1:40:49] way i have to
[1:40:52] normally they twist these tops off for
[1:40:54] me
[1:40:55] that my
[1:40:56] my thumb is getting stronger
[1:40:58] so
[1:40:59] so what's promised to this to us in this
[1:41:02] day and i i hope i can
[1:41:04] share this with you this morning
[1:41:08] the way that it's in my heart
[1:41:10] but
[1:41:11] you you can only
[1:41:13] thirst after something that's been
[1:41:15] provided
[1:41:17] like the little boy you know the eraser
[1:41:19] he hungered or he thirsted after sulfur
[1:41:23] because he needed sulfur but he couldn't
[1:41:26] thirst for the sulfur or desire the
[1:41:29] sulfur if there wasn't a sulfur there
[1:41:33] to
[1:41:34] supply what he was hungry for
[1:41:38] and we know that what it is that we are
[1:41:42] thirsting for
[1:41:44] is faith i believe that the real
[1:41:47] believer today the real child of god
[1:41:51] today
[1:41:53] is hungering after a faith
[1:41:56] that produces the promises of god
[1:42:00] he wants to he wants to have faith
[1:42:03] because the promise to us is i will
[1:42:07] restore saith the lord
[1:42:10] i'll restore what was eaten
[1:42:13] but the clunk
[1:42:14] palmer worm the cankerworm the
[1:42:16] caterpillar the locust all that was
[1:42:19] chewed up i'm gonna restore
[1:42:22] uh bef before the great and dreadful day
[1:42:25] of the lord i will send you elijah the
[1:42:28] prophet and he shall restore back the
[1:42:32] faith of the father now we can study the
[1:42:36] prophet elijah
[1:42:38] and we can compare him and we can come
[1:42:41] and go over the vindicated
[1:42:45] truths that brother william mary and
[1:42:48] branham was the vessel was the man that
[1:42:52] god chose to dwell in to bring past the
[1:42:58] prophecy of
[1:43:00] malachi 4 5.
[1:43:04] every part of his nature every part of
[1:43:07] his design
[1:43:08] god made him that way he even shaped his
[1:43:12] mouth in a certain way that he could
[1:43:14] speak words just the certain way that he
[1:43:18] could speak them
[1:43:20] and and so
[1:43:22] without a shadow of a doubt this morning
[1:43:26] and we're not preaching to the world
[1:43:28] we're preaching to our local
[1:43:30] congregation
[1:43:31] with not a shadow of a doubt in the
[1:43:33] world we know that that picture of that
[1:43:36] pillar of fire is the same pillar of
[1:43:39] fire that led the children of israel
[1:43:42] i don't know how big it was but this is
[1:43:44] a capturing of that pillar of fire
[1:43:48] coming into form that it could be seen
[1:43:51] by man
[1:43:53] and so we know that and there's not a
[1:43:56] shadow in our hearts this morning that
[1:44:00] brother branham was a genuine
[1:44:03] prophet sent from god
[1:44:07] i don't think there's a question with
[1:44:08] anybody sitting in our midst this
[1:44:11] morning or listening to us
[1:44:14] if they didn't believe it i'm sure
[1:44:17] that it didn't take them long to press
[1:44:20] the button
[1:44:22] he said i'm going to something else
[1:44:26] but to you and to ourselves what we
[1:44:29] listened to
[1:44:30] the last 20 minutes was music to our
[1:44:33] ears how many learned a few things how
[1:44:36] many heard some things that inspired
[1:44:38] them america it increases your
[1:44:41] understanding it's a blessing so i don't
[1:44:44] think that's a question we've settled
[1:44:47] that but when he says i'll restore back
[1:44:50] to you the faith that our fathers once
[1:44:53] had
[1:44:54] i think that creates in us a hunger for
[1:44:58] that faith
[1:45:02] a hunger for that faith
[1:45:05] we are looking
[1:45:07] for that faith
[1:45:09] if not we're
[1:45:11] looking for a
[1:45:14] maybe we're
[1:45:16] been distracted to go after something
[1:45:19] else
[1:45:20] but we know that there is a rapturing
[1:45:24] faith
[1:45:26] and we want that faith
[1:45:29] because without faith it's impossible to
[1:45:32] please god
[1:45:34] man always has set up his own religious
[1:45:38] form
[1:45:39] his own religious services his own
[1:45:43] religious program i was raised a
[1:45:45] catholic i i swung incense and i lit
[1:45:50] candles and i sang hymns and i rang
[1:45:53] bells and and and i did all those things
[1:45:57] but none of them was what god provided
[1:46:00] to feed my soul
[1:46:06] none of them
[1:46:07] fed me
[1:46:09] and we just heard that there's an alarm
[1:46:13] that goes off a warning that goes off
[1:46:16] that command knows if i don't get this
[1:46:20] if i don't receive this
[1:46:22] if i don't have this i'll perish
[1:46:26] and that's what religion is it's a
[1:46:28] covering it's a
[1:46:30] it's a false satisfying of a natural
[1:46:33] desire in a man for god
[1:46:38] i don't want a religious ceremony
[1:46:41] i want the faith
[1:46:43] that the apostles had
[1:46:45] because that's promised to me to be
[1:46:47] restored in this day that i can believe
[1:46:50] like they believe
[1:46:52] and have what they had and produce the
[1:46:55] works that they produce for these works
[1:46:57] shall follow them that believe
[1:47:02] so they're hungry
[1:47:04] they're they're
[1:47:06] thirsting and i believe that's what
[1:47:08] we're thirsting for
[1:47:11] we don't want a substitute
[1:47:14] which is covered in the
[1:47:16] pages following
[1:47:18] we don't want a substitute
[1:47:21] we want what god's promised us
[1:47:24] because he promised us what we need
[1:47:29] and he put
[1:47:31] a
[1:47:32] hunger
[1:47:33] in us
[1:47:36] for what we need
[1:47:40] it gets something that's
[1:47:42] in you and
[1:47:45] and
[1:47:46] it it's something that's there
[1:47:49] because we know that if we get what it's
[1:47:53] provided it will keep us alive
[1:47:59] and
[1:48:04] as a
[1:48:06] pastor or as a
[1:48:09] person that has
[1:48:11] maybe the lord's allowed
[1:48:14] to be in a place that
[1:48:15] you can see from
[1:48:18] you talk a hunter 100 finds a high spot
[1:48:22] and he gets out with his glasses
[1:48:25] and he looks and he glasses and he looks
[1:48:28] afar off until he finds the area that
[1:48:32] that animal's in
[1:48:34] and then he looks at the terrain and he
[1:48:37] figures how that he's going to approach
[1:48:39] it you just can't start off in the
[1:48:41] middle of a thicket
[1:48:42] because you just heard that he just the
[1:48:45] prophet told us that animal's got all
[1:48:47] those instincts he can hear you he can
[1:48:49] smell you but if you know where he is
[1:48:51] then you can approach him
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:55] and so
[1:48:56] uh we find out that outstanding
[1:49:00] from a place that you can see
[1:49:03] you begin to realize that a lot of
[1:49:05] people's faith
[1:49:08] is dying
[1:49:13] and
[1:49:14] and look he told us why
[1:49:17] faith dies
[1:49:19] faith dies because the the
[1:49:22] the
[1:49:22] enemy fights it
[1:49:26] did you hear him say that the minute you
[1:49:28] want to grow the minute you want to do
[1:49:31] something more with god everything evil
[1:49:33] comes up everything about here comes the
[1:49:36] church when the church is supposed to be
[1:49:38] moving into the power of the living god
[1:49:41] and here comes a virus that's trying to
[1:49:44] shut the whole thing down
[1:49:51] and everybody just rolls back
[1:49:55] everybody's depressed
[1:49:58] that's what he said david must have been
[1:50:01] in a depressed state
[1:50:06] he says sometimes god's got to make it
[1:50:08] that way
[1:50:12] i i i just
[1:50:14] love what was
[1:50:15] said we don't have service tonight so
[1:50:18] i'm going to use brother tim's pruitt's
[1:50:21] uh
[1:50:22] strategy preached two and one
[1:50:27] don't tell kim i said that
[1:50:32] he said i think david writing must have
[1:50:35] been distressed
[1:50:37] and usually takes distress to bring the
[1:50:40] best out of a man
[1:50:46] that's when god
[1:50:47] gets down to when we fast
[1:50:50] many times to our
[1:50:52] selves to to get ourselves in position
[1:50:57] to get ourselves out of the way
[1:51:00] and i think that david he got to these
[1:51:02] place
[1:51:03] and he began to meditate on the lord and
[1:51:07] begin to think about the things
[1:51:11] and so we're we're telling him here
[1:51:14] that that
[1:51:16] when when and he goes on to explain what
[1:51:19] happens when we get to that place that
[1:51:22] that we want to hunger for faith that
[1:51:24] evil is always present with us
[1:51:27] it's always there to fight us
[1:51:30] but the hunger for it
[1:51:33] is something that god put in us
[1:51:38] and i believe that that's what if this
[1:51:40] church
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:43] each one of us
[1:51:46] should be painfully desiring
[1:51:49] is the faith
[1:51:51] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:51:54] and i believe that you do desire that
[1:51:58] because it's placed in you to desire at
[1:52:01] he said there's a control tower in you
[1:52:04] one that desires the things of the flesh
[1:52:07] and one that desires the things of god
[1:52:11] and man gets in trouble when he tries to
[1:52:14] live between those two towers
[1:52:23] i didn't say that
[1:52:26] he pointed that out to us
[1:52:29] when we get caught
[1:52:31] in the middle
[1:52:34] how many knows what that being caught in
[1:52:36] the middle what the bible describes that
[1:52:38] as
[1:52:39] luke warm
[1:52:41] it's half hot
[1:52:43] and it's half cold
[1:52:45] he's that's what he warned us he said i
[1:52:48] would that you either follow the control
[1:52:51] tower of the world
[1:52:53] or follow the control tower of the
[1:52:56] spirit
[1:52:57] but if you try to follow them both i
[1:53:00] will speed thee out of my mouth
[1:53:03] because no man can serve two masters and
[1:53:07] the lord does not want to share his
[1:53:10] leadership with anybody not me not this
[1:53:14] church not any mother minister god leads
[1:53:17] his people by himself by his spirit by
[1:53:22] his word
[1:53:26] how he does it
[1:53:29] so you have that control tower in you
[1:53:33] he said don't let satan tell you you
[1:53:35] don't
[1:53:39] he even said last week
[1:53:42] a man got that sense that he's going to
[1:53:44] pass that god's going to take him that
[1:53:46] he better get it right and he dismisses
[1:53:49] it
[1:53:51] oh that's just some funny feeling
[1:53:55] don't dismiss the conviction of the holy
[1:53:57] spirit
[1:53:58] don't dismiss god being in you
[1:54:02] talking to you so we realize that our
[1:54:04] thirst
[1:54:07] is for faith
[1:54:13] how many would like their faith increase
[1:54:15] today man i mean we'd all go amen amen
[1:54:19] now i want to make this remark
[1:54:23] there's a difference
[1:54:26] between
[1:54:28] unbelief
[1:54:30] and disbelief
[1:54:34] unbelief is not
[1:54:36] disbelief
[1:54:40] you understand
[1:54:42] that
[1:54:43] why don't we just
[1:54:44] read a bible story
[1:54:46] let's turn in our bibles to
[1:54:49] mark
[1:54:55] this 9th chapter
[1:54:58] and the 17th verse
[1:55:18] i had a young lady let me know that uh
[1:55:22] i have to give more time for them to
[1:55:24] find their scriptures
[1:55:26] so they said just listen to when the
[1:55:29] pages start wrestling
[1:55:31] and then we'll hear it so i hope you've
[1:55:33] all found mark
[1:55:35] uh
[1:55:36] the ninth chapter
[1:55:37] and the seventeenth verse
[1:55:41] okay
[1:55:43] and one of the multitude answered
[1:55:46] and said master
[1:55:48] i have brought unto the
[1:55:50] unto thee my son
[1:55:53] which hath a dumb spirit
[1:55:57] and
[1:55:59] wheresoever he
[1:56:01] he taketh him
[1:56:03] he teareth him
[1:56:05] and he fomet
[1:56:07] and he gnashes with
[1:56:09] his teeth
[1:56:11] and pineth away
[1:56:14] and i speak to thy disciples
[1:56:18] that they should cast him out
[1:56:20] and they could not
[1:56:23] and jesus answered and said o faithless
[1:56:27] generation
[1:56:29] how long shall i be with you
[1:56:32] how long shall i suffer you
[1:56:36] bring him
[1:56:38] unto me
[1:56:40] and they brought him unto him and when
[1:56:42] he saw him he straightway the spirit
[1:56:46] tear him
[1:56:47] and he fell on the ground and wallowed
[1:56:51] foaming
[1:56:53] and he asked his father how long
[1:56:56] is it ago since this came unto him
[1:57:00] and he's
[1:57:01] he said of a child
[1:57:04] and oftentimes it hath cast him into the
[1:57:07] fire
[1:57:08] and into the waters
[1:57:10] to destroy him
[1:57:12] but if thou
[1:57:14] canst do anything
[1:57:16] have compassion on us
[1:57:18] and help us
[1:57:20] and jesus said unto him
[1:57:22] if thou canst believe all things are
[1:57:26] possible to him that believeth
[1:57:32] now this is the part we need to play
[1:57:36] and straightway the father of the child
[1:57:38] cried out and said with tears lord i
[1:57:42] believe
[1:57:44] help
[1:57:45] doubt my unbelief
[1:57:48] you see he didn't disbelieve
[1:57:53] but he realized that his unbelief needed
[1:57:57] help
[1:58:03] you understand what i'm trying to i'm
[1:58:04] trying to draw a distinction
[1:58:07] between
[1:58:09] disbelieving
[1:58:11] and unbelieving
[1:58:16] because we are believers
[1:58:19] we were are made believers
[1:58:22] but we what we need help with is our
[1:58:24] unbelief
[1:58:29] what is between us and the next level
[1:58:33] what is between us and higher ground
[1:58:36] what is between us of knowing and
[1:58:39] possessing what is it that's keeping us
[1:58:44] right
[1:58:47] that's what we want
[1:58:49] that's what we're hungering for
[1:58:53] we want more in that i believe we want
[1:58:56] more of that i want more of it you want
[1:58:58] more of it we want the faith that's
[1:59:00] promised to us by god's word
[1:59:07] amen
[1:59:08] let's just follow the story
[1:59:17] and when jesus saw that the people come
[1:59:20] running together he rebuked the foul
[1:59:23] spirit
[1:59:24] and said of him thou dumb and death
[1:59:26] spirit i charge thee come out of him
[1:59:30] and enter no more
[1:59:32] unto him
[1:59:34] and the spirit cried and rent him sore
[1:59:38] and came out of him
[1:59:40] and he was as
[1:59:42] one dead
[1:59:43] insomuch as many said he is dead
[1:59:47] but jesus took him by the hand
[1:59:50] and lifted him up
[1:59:53] and he arose
[1:59:55] and when he was come unto the house the
[1:59:58] disciples asked him privately
[2:00:01] why
[2:00:02] could
[2:00:03] not we cast him out
[2:00:08] why didn't we
[2:00:12] have the faith
[2:00:16] that's a good question
[2:00:19] you know i believe they ask
[2:00:23] because they want it
[2:00:26] they were desiring to have that ability
[2:00:31] i don't know if i would call it an
[2:00:32] ability
[2:00:35] but to be able
[2:00:37] they
[2:00:38] let me say it this way for our behalf
[2:00:40] the desire to be in the position
[2:00:45] and place
[2:00:49] the life
[2:00:51] the mental attitude
[2:00:54] the
[2:00:54] spiritual growth
[2:00:57] to be able to
[2:00:59] minister
[2:01:01] that deliverance
[2:01:03] to people
[2:01:08] no christian ever does anything
[2:01:11] as a show of power
[2:01:16] you're not going to prove to god that
[2:01:18] you're
[2:01:21] uh some sort of
[2:01:23] of spiritual being by performing a
[2:01:26] miracle
[2:01:27] he already covered that a long time ago
[2:01:31] depart from me you doers of iniquity i
[2:01:34] never knew you god never knows you
[2:01:38] by the works that you do
[2:01:41] he only knows you by the motivation
[2:01:44] that's producing those works you can do
[2:01:47] those things for vain power for
[2:01:50] vainglory for filthy lucr
[2:01:54] which paul says they do these things for
[2:01:56] that he says but nevertheless the gospel
[2:01:59] is going to be preached in others he
[2:02:01] knew some soul some seed out there would
[2:02:04] be touched even if it came from an
[2:02:06] unbeliever
[2:02:09] but god judges
[2:02:11] a man
[2:02:13] by why does he desire that power
[2:02:16] i'm sure many of you
[2:02:19] quickly you bible scholars had went to
[2:02:21] this
[2:02:22] the story i believe it was simeon was it
[2:02:24] simeon or simon that came to
[2:02:28] the disciples and wanted to purchase
[2:02:32] the power
[2:02:34] because he wanted the power for glory
[2:02:38] he wanted the power for prestige
[2:02:42] but jesus never ministered the power for
[2:02:44] glory
[2:02:46] he even said i do nothing of myself
[2:02:50] but it's only the father which is in
[2:02:52] heaven
[2:02:55] they came to me said master you're a
[2:02:57] good master he says no there's none but
[2:02:59] good but my father which is in heaven
[2:03:02] and when he tried to purchase these they
[2:03:05] they say why do you tempt the holy
[2:03:07] spirit
[2:03:11] so i believe
[2:03:12] that
[2:03:15] part of helping
[2:03:18] our unbelief
[2:03:21] is the re-establishment
[2:03:25] and understanding of our heart of the
[2:03:28] right motive and objection
[2:03:32] that ought to be in a christian's heart
[2:03:34] amen
[2:03:35] to go into all the world
[2:03:38] and preach the gospel what has freely
[2:03:41] been given to you
[2:03:43] freely give
[2:03:47] amen
[2:03:49] and as we continue
[2:03:53] and the disciples come in his house and
[2:03:56] ask him privately why could we not pass
[2:03:59] them out and jesus said to him this
[2:04:02] can't this kind
[2:04:04] can come forth by nothing
[2:04:08] but by prayer and fasting
[2:04:13] now so we know that we see there that
[2:04:16] there's a difference between
[2:04:19] unbelief
[2:04:22] and faith
[2:04:24] and
[2:04:26] if i could say this and start putting
[2:04:28] words which
[2:04:30] i'm not adding to or taken away but the
[2:04:33] private god said that
[2:04:35] faith and revelation
[2:04:40] are
[2:04:41] the same
[2:04:44] so when we read this scripture he said
[2:04:46] lord help my
[2:04:48] revelation
[2:04:51] he said oh you faithless generation oh
[2:04:54] you generation that lacks
[2:04:58] revelation
[2:05:00] if you would have known the scriptures
[2:05:03] you would have known that they spoke of
[2:05:05] me
[2:05:06] if you would have had revelation you
[2:05:08] would have known that i was supposed to
[2:05:11] come and that these were the works that
[2:05:13] i would do it was prophesied of me that
[2:05:17] i'd heal the blind that i would raise
[2:05:20] the dead that the sick would be made
[2:05:22] well
[2:05:26] if they had revelation
[2:05:31] and that's what he told them search the
[2:05:33] scriptures
[2:05:37] search the scriptures
[2:05:39] they are which that testify
[2:05:42] of me
[2:05:44] and so we find that
[2:05:46] that what that they were lacking
[2:05:52] what their unbelief was
[2:05:55] was not disbelief
[2:05:59] i hope i can draw that real clear
[2:06:02] you are believers
[2:06:05] you're made believers
[2:06:08] what we've got to battle is the
[2:06:14] unbelief and you know it
[2:06:18] it's hard to you can't believe in
[2:06:21] something that you don't know exists
[2:06:30] but you've got to and i don't mean see
[2:06:34] as with your eyes
[2:06:36] but you can't believe something you
[2:06:39] don't understand
[2:06:42] or you can't you don't know exist that
[2:06:44] isn't revealed to you
[2:06:49] now you may not doubt that i tell you
[2:06:51] that under here
[2:06:53] i have a pot of gold
[2:06:57] because i'm irish
[2:07:01] and i'm of leprechaun
[2:07:03] descendancy
[2:07:05] and anybody knows that a leprechaun goes
[2:07:08] around with a pot of gold
[2:07:12] now most of you disbelieve it
[2:07:16] some of you simply possess unbelief
[2:07:20] there's actually some of you who would
[2:07:21] really like to come around here and look
[2:07:29] but you will never believe that until i
[2:07:31] show it to you
[2:07:44] i'm trying to get somewhere
[2:07:47] i don't want to just be preaching at you
[2:07:49] i want you to understand that i'm part
[2:07:51] of this struggle amen that's right you
[2:07:54] understand i i am wanting to overcome my
[2:07:59] unbelief i'm here saying lord help me
[2:08:03] with my unbelief i believe lord help me
[2:08:07] with my unbelief
[2:08:11] and so we we see that you can't
[2:08:15] believe something that you doesn't know
[2:08:18] exists
[2:08:20] or you don't understand
[2:08:22] or you don't see
[2:08:27] now when he talked about this deer
[2:08:31] and he talked about this unbelief that
[2:08:35] comes roaring in he said don't let satan
[2:08:38] don't let that shake you
[2:08:41] he said that deer he hungers
[2:08:46] and he thirsts after that brook
[2:08:51] because he knows in that brook
[2:08:56] there is
[2:08:57] life
[2:09:00] if he can get to that brook
[2:09:04] drinking from that water
[2:09:06] is going to help that unbelief
[2:09:11] that's what's going to keep him
[2:09:13] from the wiles of the enemy
[2:09:16] and so i believe that there's a thirst
[2:09:20] in the believer
[2:09:22] for reality
[2:09:29] the real
[2:09:31] not a man-made system
[2:09:35] he said that we just heard him he said
[2:09:38] david thirsted for a the real
[2:09:42] living god
[2:09:45] not all the stories about god
[2:09:48] not all the
[2:09:49] churches about god not all the
[2:09:51] conversations about god but he thirsted
[2:09:56] after meeting that god he wanted to
[2:10:00] drink from the fountain of life
[2:10:05] we could read in the scriptures let's
[2:10:07] just
[2:10:08] turn because this we want to see that
[2:10:11] that this thirst
[2:10:13] this
[2:10:15] hunger in a man
[2:10:19] to overcome his unbelief
[2:10:22] is something that god put in him as a
[2:10:26] warning sign
[2:10:30] as an alarm that goes off
[2:10:32] something that says what did he say it
[2:10:35] said i'm lacking this
[2:10:41] it's a warning that you're in need of
[2:10:43] something
[2:10:45] i'm lacking this i'm without this i need
[2:10:48] more of this
[2:10:51] doesn't mean you disbelieve
[2:10:55] it means you're suffering
[2:10:58] from something
[2:10:59] you're in need of something and if you
[2:11:02] don't get it you're going to perish
[2:11:06] in others if you don't get this that
[2:11:09] wolf that lion that dog is gonna catch
[2:11:12] up with you but if you can get to that
[2:11:15] water and drink and get to that watering
[2:11:18] tree and get to that water and drink
[2:11:20] you'll live you'll get away
[2:11:26] amen
[2:11:30] so we can turn to the scriptures in
[2:11:32] matthew
[2:11:37] matthew
[2:11:38] 5
[2:11:44] and the 6th verse
[2:11:51] we know this is the sermon on the mount
[2:11:55] leslie and i have been to the place they
[2:11:56] say is the
[2:11:58] mount
[2:12:03] i
[2:12:04] don't disbelieve
[2:12:06] but i have
[2:12:08] maybe some unbelief
[2:12:14] i have been to the place they said that
[2:12:16] jesus was buried
[2:12:18] and there's another place over here they
[2:12:19] say he was buried
[2:12:25] you know i don't know
[2:12:27] i know one thing though he's got to be
[2:12:28] buried in here
[2:12:34] many of you know this scripture
[2:12:36] matthew 5 and 6.
[2:12:39] blessed are they which do hunger
[2:12:42] and thirst
[2:12:44] after righteousness
[2:12:46] for they shall
[2:12:48] be
[2:12:49] filled
[2:12:54] we could
[2:12:55] turn over a page or two to
[2:13:00] matthew 7
[2:13:03] 7.
[2:13:08] and we
[2:13:08] we find out that that jesus was
[2:13:11] preaching
[2:13:12] this thirst
[2:13:15] in lady osea he preached this thirst
[2:13:18] behold i stand at the door and knock
[2:13:23] any man that will
[2:13:25] open up
[2:13:26] and let me come in i will sup with him
[2:13:30] i will feed him
[2:13:33] i will give to him what he's thirsting
[2:13:36] for what he's hungering for what he has
[2:13:39] need of i'm jehovah jirei i supply what
[2:13:43] that you have need of
[2:13:46] and though he begins to say here he says
[2:13:48] ask and you shall it shall be given to
[2:13:51] you
[2:13:52] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[2:13:56] shall be opened unto you
[2:14:00] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[2:14:03] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[2:14:06] knocketh it shall be open
[2:14:11] or what man is there of you whom if his
[2:14:14] son asked bread will give him a stone
[2:14:19] no don't don't overlook these things
[2:14:24] there's more meat here
[2:14:26] and what that he's talking about than
[2:14:29] than justice in the story
[2:14:32] he said if you seek the right thing
[2:14:35] he'll give you the right thing if a
[2:14:38] child seeks bread he's not gonna get
[2:14:41] anything other than bread
[2:14:46] he's not gonna get a snake
[2:14:48] that's right
[2:14:49] he's not gonna get a stone
[2:14:53] but if he seeks
[2:14:55] if he hungers
[2:14:57] if he thirsts
[2:14:59] he shall receive ask and you shall be
[2:15:01] given seek and you shall find knock and
[2:15:05] it shall be opened
[2:15:07] fear not little children it's the
[2:15:10] father's good pleasure to give you the
[2:15:12] kingdom
[2:15:22] what man is there of you whom if his son
[2:15:25] has bread will give him a stone or if he
[2:15:28] asks a fish
[2:15:29] well give him a serpent
[2:15:31] if ye then being evil
[2:15:34] know how to do
[2:15:36] good
[2:15:37] give good gifts
[2:15:39] unto your children
[2:15:41] how much more shall your father which is
[2:15:44] in heaven
[2:15:45] give good things to them
[2:15:49] that
[2:15:51] ask him
[2:15:55] so we understand that this thirst
[2:15:59] that
[2:16:02] he's talking about this
[2:16:05] this uh thirst for righteousness this
[2:16:08] seeking and fine
[2:16:10] it is the
[2:16:12] is the pursuit
[2:16:16] you understand that dear panetta
[2:16:20] another he not only did he thirst but he
[2:16:24] pursued the water
[2:16:30] he put into motion
[2:16:35] the actions
[2:16:37] to
[2:16:39] receive
[2:16:40] what that he needed
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:47] and i i don't know how to express this
[2:16:50] the way that i want
[2:16:52] but
[2:16:53] the scripture says
[2:16:57] if you draw nigh unto god
[2:17:00] he'll draw nigh unto you
[2:17:03] and look if you take the step
[2:17:06] in that direction he's taking a step to
[2:17:10] meet you
[2:17:12] you've got to understand that taking the
[2:17:14] step is the process of relieving the
[2:17:18] unbelief
[2:17:25] you got to know i lack this
[2:17:28] that's right
[2:17:30] i lack an understanding
[2:17:33] i lack a revelation
[2:17:36] the prophet of god said it can never be
[2:17:39] stressed to the church the importance of
[2:17:42] revelation
[2:17:44] if you pray for anything
[2:17:46] pray
[2:17:47] for
[2:17:48] revelation
[2:17:50] revelation is the cure of unbelief
[2:17:55] [Applause]
[2:18:01] it's the pursuit
[2:18:06] we're not disbelievers
[2:18:09] amen
[2:18:10] but i think what this world has done to
[2:18:13] us
[2:18:15] is first of all
[2:18:17] to substitute
[2:18:19] fear
[2:18:21] and put us into
[2:18:24] protection mode
[2:18:27] and defense
[2:18:28] mode
[2:18:33] you never gain ground
[2:18:35] on defense
[2:18:40] in any battle
[2:18:42] you establish your position
[2:18:47] you try to take the higher ground
[2:18:50] where you can see you disable a position
[2:18:54] where you can launch
[2:18:56] an offensive
[2:19:00] because you'll never defeat this enemy
[2:19:05] in your life
[2:19:07] in the world or anything on defense
[2:19:20] revelation
[2:19:22] is sought after
[2:19:28] revelation is sought after
[2:19:32] because there's a thirst in you that you
[2:19:35] need revelation
[2:19:40] there's a thirst in you that you need
[2:19:42] understanding
[2:19:45] father i'm thankful that you've hid it
[2:19:48] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[2:19:52] it
[2:19:53] unto babes such as would
[2:19:56] learn
[2:20:02] are we done learning
[2:20:07] am i going to say that all the tapes are
[2:20:09] there all the books are there all i've
[2:20:11] got to do is say what's on those tapes
[2:20:13] and book i'm telling you i need to learn
[2:20:16] of me
[2:20:17] this is the word of god come me all the
[2:20:19] other have you been learned i'll give
[2:20:21] you rest come learn of me
[2:20:27] amen let me let me open this up to you
[2:20:33] and reveal it to you
[2:20:37] lord i have unbelief
[2:20:40] i need revelation
[2:20:42] i hunger and thirst after it
[2:20:45] there there's this there's a uh
[2:20:48] we he said he put that control tower in
[2:20:51] you
[2:20:52] the human body has one
[2:20:55] the spiritual body has one
[2:20:58] your control tower is the seed that god
[2:21:02] put in you
[2:21:08] but what happens if the one control
[2:21:11] tower
[2:21:14] is the only one that's
[2:21:16] we're getting the message from
[2:21:21] rent
[2:21:23] bills
[2:21:24] car payments food
[2:21:27] clothes
[2:21:28] housing land
[2:21:33] and jesus is trying to tell us something
[2:21:35] he's been trying to tell us something he
[2:21:38] knew that that gospel wasn't going to go
[2:21:40] to that age
[2:21:42] he knew that it soon was going to be
[2:21:44] taken from him
[2:21:46] from them
[2:21:47] he knew those horse riders were coming
[2:21:50] he knew it was going to fall into the
[2:21:52] ground he knew it was going to be
[2:21:54] resurrected again in justification
[2:21:56] sanctification baptism of the holy
[2:21:59] spirit but he knew that he was going to
[2:22:02] come again
[2:22:03] veil himself in the human flesh of the
[2:22:06] prophet and preach to the gentiles the
[2:22:09] same gospel
[2:22:12] hallelujah
[2:22:20] he put that tower in there
[2:22:24] and that tower's job
[2:22:28] is to thirst
[2:22:31] it's to warn
[2:22:33] it's to create the hunger is to create
[2:22:36] the desire
[2:22:41] a desire to know more
[2:22:43] a desire to see more
[2:22:46] it's a it's a pursuit
[2:22:52] so you have to understand that a
[2:22:53] hungering is not
[2:22:55] a physical hunger
[2:22:58] what happens when you're hungry
[2:23:06] nobody knows what they do when they're
[2:23:07] hungry
[2:23:08] i i saw jack in the box pop up and then
[2:23:11] i saw
[2:23:12] danny's pop-up and mexican food pop up
[2:23:16] and
[2:23:17] all kinds of things you know
[2:23:19] you know some of you go to the
[2:23:21] refrigerator
[2:23:23] some of you do something but when the
[2:23:24] minute that thing
[2:23:26] in you
[2:23:28] starts to ring that warning
[2:23:31] alarm
[2:23:32] you begin to pursue it
[2:23:39] and if you don't
[2:23:43] it
[2:23:44] grows and pretty soon you say i'm so
[2:23:48] hungry i could eat a cow
[2:23:52] or if i don't get something to eat i'm
[2:23:55] gonna die
[2:24:00] i mean you make all kinds of
[2:24:02] wonderful statements
[2:24:05] oh i wish i what i could eat right now
[2:24:07] i'd like to have one of those
[2:24:09] man i wish i had one of those torpedoes
[2:24:12] from mona lisa
[2:24:17] that's my sandwich shop
[2:24:20] you just get you you actually begin to
[2:24:23] put in your mind
[2:24:25] foods
[2:24:27] you put in your mind things that you
[2:24:29] want to eat you start looking for what
[2:24:31] what's going to satisfy this what can i
[2:24:34] come up with that i'm going to go eat
[2:24:36] and be satisfied with
[2:24:42] you ought to hear what brother brown
[2:24:43] says about cokes and flavored water
[2:24:47] in this book
[2:24:49] he said it will never satisfy
[2:24:53] never
[2:24:54] does
[2:24:56] nothing sugary
[2:24:59] ever satisfied
[2:25:02] but there's a pursuit
[2:25:05] when this alarm goes off
[2:25:08] when that comes to your life you know
[2:25:10] i'm really not living the way that i
[2:25:13] should
[2:25:14] i'm really not as close to god
[2:25:17] as i ought to be
[2:25:19] i'm really not uh
[2:25:23] uh you know i really don't understand
[2:25:25] that it doesn't mean you're disbelief
[2:25:28] it doesn't mean that you're you're not
[2:25:30] doing everything that you know to do
[2:25:33] you can be absolutely living everything
[2:25:36] and god can turn that alarm into your
[2:25:39] life because he wants to give you more
[2:25:41] of him
[2:25:42] [Music]
[2:25:45] we want higher ground
[2:25:48] we want a clearer vision
[2:25:51] we want to be empowered that's what he
[2:25:53] said you go to that room and wait there
[2:25:56] until you're in dude with power from on
[2:25:59] high
[2:26:02] and so there's a crave so don't that
[2:26:05] that alarm tower going off is a blessing
[2:26:10] just like being convicted of sin is a
[2:26:13] blessing
[2:26:15] it's not a condemnation it's a warning
[2:26:18] sign from god to say correct your path
[2:26:22] it's not punishment it's correction
[2:26:28] so he says that
[2:26:30] so there's a process
[2:26:33] that's got to take place
[2:26:36] in the believer
[2:26:38] when the alarm goes off
[2:26:44] they have got to know what
[2:26:46] is it that i priest pursue
[2:26:51] what is it that i seek after
[2:26:55] what is it that i ask for what is it
[2:26:59] that i knock for to be opened unto me to
[2:27:03] help me with what i have need of
[2:27:09] what is it lord what is it that i'm
[2:27:12] lacking
[2:27:16] if and i think
[2:27:19] that it's too simple
[2:27:22] for us to fall into condemnation
[2:27:27] you're not condemned because you're
[2:27:29] thirsty
[2:27:31] naturally
[2:27:33] it just means that you need to drink
[2:27:36] water
[2:27:39] and he said you can't
[2:27:41] keep
[2:27:42] putting it off
[2:27:47] you know what happens when you freeze to
[2:27:49] death
[2:27:51] you get to the point you don't think
[2:27:52] you're cold
[2:27:57] can you imagine getting to the point you
[2:27:58] just haven't drank water so long you
[2:28:00] don't even think of water
[2:28:04] and then pretty soon you just
[2:28:06] fall over with some sort of hypothermia
[2:28:09] and things start shutting down
[2:28:13] pretty soon your nerves start shutting
[2:28:15] down
[2:28:16] and you don't start thinking straight
[2:28:19] and you can't even think about water you
[2:28:21] can't even think where there's to get
[2:28:23] water
[2:28:24] and slowly but surely you begin to shut
[2:28:29] down
[2:28:36] and
[2:28:36] that's what the enemy wants
[2:28:39] he wants to shut this
[2:28:42] church i don't mean this local assembly
[2:28:44] the church of the living god he wants to
[2:28:47] shut it down because he knows if it ever
[2:28:51] gets the true
[2:28:53] revelation
[2:28:58] of the two spirits
[2:29:00] working within the framework of the
[2:29:03] church
[2:29:04] and gets the true and right revelation
[2:29:08] it will become an invincible army that's
[2:29:12] the last thing satan wants to see is an
[2:29:15] army of faith
[2:29:17] the last thing he wants to see is men
[2:29:19] and women that believe every word of god
[2:29:23] not just sitting
[2:29:25] saying
[2:29:26] i believe the word of god i'm going to
[2:29:29] protect my belief that's not what
[2:29:31] brother brother brahm said he said who
[2:29:34] will draw their sword
[2:29:37] and come stand with me shoulder to
[2:29:40] shoulder and meet the enemy
[2:29:47] and so we realized is that
[2:29:49] there are there's got to be a pursuit in
[2:29:52] us
[2:29:54] now we always look at the pursuit as
[2:29:56] being overcoming
[2:29:59] and there's i got a weakness i watch
[2:30:01] things i shouldn't watch i've got a
[2:30:03] weakness i listen to things that i
[2:30:05] shouldn't listen to i got a weakness i
[2:30:07] love to hear gossip
[2:30:12] i just got to know what's going on i got
[2:30:14] to know what you think i got to know
[2:30:16] what you would do
[2:30:20] gossip never helps you
[2:30:23] it's like spiritual ear wax
[2:30:28] it just stops you from hearing the
[2:30:29] spirit
[2:30:33] it can our our answer is
[2:30:37] i'm going to stop doing this i'm going
[2:30:39] to fight it you know what you need
[2:30:41] you don't need the fight you need the
[2:30:43] revelation
[2:30:46] you need a revelation
[2:30:49] what is it in me
[2:30:51] what is it about me
[2:30:54] why do i possess this weakness
[2:30:56] what is it that i'm lacking
[2:31:01] and there's i need the weapon
[2:31:06] to stand
[2:31:09] i need i need to possess something from
[2:31:12] you lord to make me an overcomer because
[2:31:15] it's given to the overcomer to inherit
[2:31:19] the kingdom of heaven
[2:31:23] he promised
[2:31:25] if you open he will come and sup with
[2:31:27] you he will feed you the word of god
[2:31:30] he'll feed you what you have need of so
[2:31:32] there's got to be a pursuit
[2:31:36] and a panning
[2:31:39] and a thirst and a hunger so when the
[2:31:42] alarm bell goes off
[2:31:46] that we realize i need
[2:31:48] to seek him
[2:31:51] for
[2:31:53] divine
[2:31:54] answers
[2:31:56] i need to seek him for
[2:31:58] overcoming
[2:32:00] revelation
[2:32:02] i need to receive of him
[2:32:05] what that i have need of for the father
[2:32:08] knows what i have need of even before i
[2:32:12] ask
[2:32:13] but we have not
[2:32:15] because we ask not
[2:32:20] and we've got to start asking for the
[2:32:23] right thing
[2:32:28] and that right thing is
[2:32:30] faith
[2:32:32] and faith is a revelation
[2:32:35] you'll never muster up faith
[2:32:39] within your intellect
[2:32:41] faith is a gift of god
[2:32:44] that god gives you
[2:32:46] he shows you he opens your eyes he lets
[2:32:49] you see he make it known he makes it
[2:32:53] where you no longer have unbelief
[2:32:58] revelation is what takes unbelief
[2:33:02] away
[2:33:05] and so there's a desire within us
[2:33:09] and he said everyone that has this
[2:33:12] so this we know that that control tower
[2:33:16] that's in us is that seed
[2:33:20] but we need a revelation of what that
[2:33:22] seed possesses
[2:33:26] and what that seed is to produce
[2:33:30] amen
[2:33:32] and
[2:33:34] i believe that
[2:33:36] so many times we preach the seed
[2:33:40] as being one seed that's the same for
[2:33:43] everybody
[2:33:47] but the natural typing the spiritual
[2:33:51] when the seed donor
[2:33:54] puts forth his seed
[2:33:56] it produces a different life in every
[2:34:01] single
[2:34:02] child
[2:34:06] different characteristic different
[2:34:08] attribute different
[2:34:11] there's a difference
[2:34:13] in each of
[2:34:14] us that's why nobody can take our place
[2:34:18] there's not one clone
[2:34:21] that we're all trying to come to
[2:34:25] amen
[2:34:27] the pursuit is the revelation of the
[2:34:30] word of god that's been placed
[2:34:32] within us in other words the revelations
[2:34:35] that god has for you personally that are
[2:34:39] going to make you what that he wants you
[2:34:43] to be
[2:34:46] amen and he only has one way of
[2:34:48] communicating with you he only has one
[2:34:51] thing that he builds the church on and
[2:34:54] that's divine revelation
[2:35:00] so
[2:35:01] when you have that
[2:35:04] seal
[2:35:05] yes
[2:35:07] and you have that seed
[2:35:11] that means god's looked at the boxcar we
[2:35:13] talked about this
[2:35:15] at the men's breakfast it inspired me
[2:35:18] he looks at the boxcar
[2:35:21] and he says this buck car has been
[2:35:24] packed
[2:35:26] with everything that is supposed to be
[2:35:28] in it
[2:35:30] it is fitted
[2:35:32] and put together
[2:35:34] and
[2:35:35] designed
[2:35:37] and loaded just the way that i wanted it
[2:35:40] loaded
[2:35:41] and then he seals it
[2:35:46] and it sealed unto the day of its
[2:35:50] destination
[2:35:52] amen
[2:35:53] that means that car is sealed in
[2:35:57] you were sealed in when your name was
[2:35:59] put on the lamb's book of life before
[2:36:02] the foundation of the world
[2:36:05] he saw you he knew you the color of your
[2:36:07] hair the statue of eye everything that
[2:36:10] you were and he said in that seed
[2:36:14] is every
[2:36:16] fruit that that tree will possess
[2:36:20] that seed has within it everything it
[2:36:24] needs to be what it was made and to
[2:36:28] produce what it's produced
[2:36:32] it's been sealed in there
[2:36:34] doesn't matter what the boxcar looks
[2:36:36] like
[2:36:39] have you ever had to watch a train go by
[2:36:44] man every now and then we'll come buy a
[2:36:46] a a car that's all brand new you know
[2:36:50] got northern pacific or
[2:36:54] bmmw or whatever the different santa fe
[2:36:57] on it and then everyone else comes by
[2:37:00] and you think it would come out of a
[2:37:02] subway somewhere got graffiti painted
[2:37:05] all over it and all kinds of spray can
[2:37:08] stuff all over and it looks terrible
[2:37:10] didn't matter what the outside looked
[2:37:12] like
[2:37:14] is what's packed in there
[2:37:17] what's packed in there
[2:37:20] that that's what
[2:37:22] that what
[2:37:24] it's look the car's been sealed
[2:37:29] you've all been sealed you're not
[2:37:31] disbelievers
[2:37:34] but what we need is a revelation of
[2:37:36] what's on the inside
[2:37:41] what's in me
[2:37:43] the word of god is in you
[2:37:46] but when we say the word of god i hope
[2:37:48] i'm not getting too long i'm going to
[2:37:50] close now but it's
[2:37:52] it's not what everybody else
[2:37:55] interprets the word of god
[2:38:00] it's not the general
[2:38:03] doctrinal
[2:38:04] interpretation of the message
[2:38:09] that revelation is personal to you
[2:38:15] i'm going to close with reading
[2:38:19] you say if i would have lived in the
[2:38:21] days of jesus
[2:38:23] i would have done so and so
[2:38:27] why you are living in his day
[2:38:32] you are living in his day
[2:38:35] you're living in the day
[2:38:38] when he returned back to the gentile
[2:38:41] church
[2:38:43] veiled in the human flesh of a prophet
[2:38:46] preaching the same gospel
[2:38:49] doing the same signs and wonders and
[2:38:52] trying to reveal to us the same god in
[2:38:55] glory
[2:38:57] we are living in his day
[2:39:00] what are we doing about it
[2:39:02] what are we doing you say well what
[2:39:06] what you done perhaps what the pharisees
[2:39:09] done they belong to church and deny
[2:39:12] jesus christ we always say today people
[2:39:15] are trying to say we compare
[2:39:18] we've got to compare the bible leaves
[2:39:22] with
[2:39:23] bible leave scripture with scripture
[2:39:26] that isn't the truth
[2:39:28] no it isn't the truth
[2:39:30] this greek word means this and this
[2:39:33] greek word means that
[2:39:36] the greeks themselves way back in the
[2:39:38] nicaea council
[2:39:40] and them writers back in there they had
[2:39:44] different forms
[2:39:46] one believed it this way this greek
[2:39:48] scholar meant this
[2:39:50] and the other one said this one meant it
[2:39:53] this that way what a fuss over it we
[2:39:56] don't need interpretation of greek
[2:39:59] scholars or greek words to know him is
[2:40:03] life
[2:40:04] the person jesus
[2:40:07] the person christ himself
[2:40:10] not
[2:40:11] comparing
[2:40:14] now
[2:40:16] don't shovel that off
[2:40:19] because we we compare quote with quote
[2:40:23] we compare preacher with preacher we
[2:40:25] compare church with church we compare
[2:40:28] excitement with this and with that
[2:40:34] and we we lose
[2:40:37] the individual pursuit
[2:40:42] of the divine revelation
[2:40:45] that god has of us
[2:40:50] do you believe god had a revelation of
[2:40:52] you
[2:41:02] to know him is life
[2:41:03] christ himself not comparing it's a
[2:41:06] revelation that god built his church
[2:41:09] upon
[2:41:10] and if we don't build upon the same
[2:41:13] church the bible said
[2:41:15] abel by faith
[2:41:17] and faith is a divine
[2:41:20] revelation
[2:41:25] see faith is a divine revelation all
[2:41:28] right the whole thing is built upon the
[2:41:31] revelation
[2:41:32] then and unless
[2:41:34] this is revealed to you
[2:41:37] jesus said i thank thee father
[2:41:40] that thou has hid these things from the
[2:41:43] wise of the world
[2:41:44] and have revealed them to babes such as
[2:41:47] would learn see the whole thing is built
[2:41:50] there you've got to know the person
[2:41:55] but you can't know the person without
[2:41:58] revelation
[2:42:01] the answer to the unbelief
[2:42:05] is revelation
[2:42:08] so don't ask god for the answer
[2:42:12] don't give god the answer
[2:42:16] don't provide god a program by which he
[2:42:19] can operate so you can get what you
[2:42:23] think you have need of
[2:42:25] god knows what you have need of before
[2:42:27] you even ask what we need to do is say
[2:42:31] father i need a divine revelation to
[2:42:35] overcome
[2:42:37] [Applause]
[2:42:40] i need a divine revelation to have faith
[2:42:44] i want to be better i want to be higher
[2:42:52] you can't work your way there
[2:42:58] but faith
[2:43:00] revelation
[2:43:01] the revelation of who you are the
[2:43:04] revelation of what you are the
[2:43:06] revelation of what's in you
[2:43:10] you're not going to receive something
[2:43:11] outside of what's in you
[2:43:14] he even said pray to him
[2:43:16] who's in you
[2:43:21] what's in the boxcar
[2:43:27] yes sir hey have we even looked
[2:43:31] have we really even asked him what have
[2:43:34] you endued me with
[2:43:36] what have you placed in my life
[2:43:39] what talents have you given me
[2:43:41] what what what what overcoming victory
[2:43:48] you ever meet someone that doesn't take
[2:43:49] criticism very well
[2:43:54] you might be giving them a compliment
[2:43:55] and they've already prepared a defense
[2:44:01] well you know that was a pretty good
[2:44:02] well i could have been better
[2:44:09] like
[2:44:10] davey was telling me he met a man the
[2:44:11] other day and the man he said to the
[2:44:13] david he said well to tell you the truth
[2:44:16] and the man said why were you lying
[2:44:17] before
[2:44:24] now you're telling me the truth
[2:44:29] look
[2:44:30] you
[2:44:31] you i hope i can
[2:44:34] just say this to you
[2:44:36] we're looking
[2:44:40] for the cow in the treetop
[2:44:46] we need a revelation of the word
[2:44:48] that was put in us
[2:44:50] from the foundation of the world
[2:44:52] not the universal
[2:44:56] worldwide
[2:44:59] yeah message
[2:45:02] peoples altogether
[2:45:04] belief
[2:45:06] in certain fundamental principles of the
[2:45:10] message
[2:45:12] we've got to go beyond that
[2:45:15] and individually enter into that secret
[2:45:19] chamber of revelation where god reveals
[2:45:22] to us our strengths our weaknesses our
[2:45:26] thinking our heart our emotions where we
[2:45:30] lay bear before him and he can operate
[2:45:33] on us he can remove the things out of
[2:45:35] our life that don't need to be there and
[2:45:38] he only removes everything god only does
[2:45:42] everything by his word he will give you
[2:45:46] the revelation to overcome with
[2:45:52] amen he doesn't just go take it out
[2:46:00] he gives you the tool
[2:46:02] the revelation so you can operate by
[2:46:06] divine revelation and faith and you can
[2:46:09] go to that devil
[2:46:11] and say get out of here
[2:46:14] i'm here to possess the gates of the
[2:46:16] enemy because this is my land
[2:46:23] it's how he works
[2:46:25] god does nothing
[2:46:27] outside
[2:46:29] of divine revelation
[2:46:32] he wants to reveal to you
[2:46:34] he wants you to know what he made you
[2:46:38] he wants you to know what you are he
[2:46:41] wants you to know not just who you are
[2:46:43] but what you are what virtues what
[2:46:46] powers what gifts what compassions what
[2:46:51] feelings
[2:46:52] that he's placed in you
[2:46:55] have we ever asked him
[2:46:59] have we really ever got there and say
[2:47:01] what am i made out of
[2:47:05] show me myself
[2:47:07] satan's got us a pr on a pursuit
[2:47:11] of theology
[2:47:14] and it's never been in theology
[2:47:17] it's to know the person i'd like to read
[2:47:19] this statement
[2:47:21] in closing before i close
[2:47:41] he says this
[2:47:44] he says the man is wearing the wife's
[2:47:47] underneath clothes
[2:47:49] she is wearing his overalls
[2:47:51] see just a perversion that's right you
[2:47:54] know when he talks about women's under
[2:47:57] garment clothes
[2:47:59] he's talking about bermuda shorts wow
[2:48:02] that's right
[2:48:04] that's what he's talking about
[2:48:06] he's talking about men wearing
[2:48:09] shorts
[2:48:11] and she's wearing overalls in other
[2:48:14] words she's wearing pants men are
[2:48:16] wearing
[2:48:17] their underwear
[2:48:20] that's what he's talking about
[2:48:24] and he said
[2:48:25] and that's the same thing it is
[2:48:28] with this nation with people with
[2:48:31] churches with everything oh god where is
[2:48:34] the end of the thing
[2:48:36] the coming of the lord jesus is the
[2:48:39] ending of it all
[2:48:42] so if you neglect
[2:48:45] to feed the holy spirit
[2:48:49] the word of god
[2:48:50] jesus said every word shall be by the
[2:48:54] holy spirit
[2:48:56] now listen now
[2:48:57] if you try to feed it the wrong thing
[2:49:01] if it isn't
[2:49:02] if it's the genuine holy spirit in you
[2:49:06] it'll know the difference
[2:49:08] now remember the word of god is what the
[2:49:11] holy spirit feeds on
[2:49:14] it don't feed on enthusiasm
[2:49:18] it don't feed on education
[2:49:22] it doesn't feed on church going
[2:49:25] it doesn't feed on theology
[2:49:28] there is a lot of difference between an
[2:49:31] inspired something and a theological
[2:49:34] standpoint of it
[2:49:36] all those theologians in the day of
[2:49:38] jesus my they had word by word page by
[2:49:43] page all laid out the messiah had to
[2:49:46] come this way
[2:49:48] that's exactly what it was
[2:49:51] and
[2:49:51] everyone missed it you know what jesus
[2:49:55] said when he come
[2:49:58] he said you are of your fathers the
[2:50:01] devil and his works you will do it
[2:50:04] wasn't revealed to them what the real
[2:50:10] word
[2:50:11] was
[2:50:13] see
[2:50:14] they missed those little corners
[2:50:17] like they missing missing it today
[2:50:20] if you will belong to this or belong to
[2:50:24] this
[2:50:24] you'll be all right don't you believe
[2:50:27] that you've got to belong to christ
[2:50:31] see
[2:50:32] it's there is the something in you
[2:50:35] hungering for christ
[2:50:39] there's something in you
[2:50:42] hungering for christ
[2:50:45] don't get off
[2:50:48] don't pursue this or think it's there
[2:50:52] where it is
[2:50:54] i'm closing now
[2:50:56] where it is is that little something in
[2:51:00] you that's thirsting
[2:51:07] if it's not there
[2:51:12] and you've got away from it
[2:51:15] or you've lost it
[2:51:17] or it started to die
[2:51:20] that's what the word of god's for the
[2:51:23] word of god say wake up
[2:51:26] i'm warning you
[2:51:28] you're getting hungry you're starving
[2:51:31] you're dying you're not being fed
[2:51:34] if you've gone a long time
[2:51:38] without a real divine opening
[2:51:42] of god's word to you
[2:51:45] and and you've just studied it and
[2:51:47] studied it and studied it and it's
[2:51:50] saying the same thing
[2:51:52] and intellectually you've got it down
[2:51:54] and it's not opening doors for you it's
[2:51:57] not empowering you it's not giving you
[2:51:59] overcoming power
[2:52:01] it's not raising victory in your heart
[2:52:04] the joy bells aren't ringing the
[2:52:07] you're not you're not full of glory you
[2:52:10] know you have joy unspeakable you have
[2:52:12] peace that surpasses understanding what
[2:52:15] you need is to pray for revelation
[2:52:21] [Applause]
[2:52:23] you've got to go back and get a
[2:52:24] revelation
[2:52:30] you're running on
[2:52:33] you're running on
[2:52:34] something that'll run out
[2:52:39] and one day your tank runs out
[2:52:42] what do you think's happened to so many
[2:52:44] people
[2:52:45] that have followed this word of god
[2:52:47] their tank finally ran out
[2:52:52] they ran on the old stories
[2:52:54] they ran on the old testimonies they ran
[2:52:57] on the sermons that everybody's preached
[2:53:00] they ran on the newest crave in the
[2:53:02] message whether it's who we are were
[2:53:04] predestinated our names written on the
[2:53:07] lamb's book of life they've ran on those
[2:53:09] things and they've ran on those things
[2:53:11] and it's the same thing now they go to
[2:53:13] revival after revival enthusiasm
[2:53:16] enthusiasm you can run around the church
[2:53:18] you can shout you can sing but without
[2:53:21] divine revelation you will perish
[2:53:35] the prophet god said second hand
[2:53:38] revelation
[2:53:39] is one of the worst things that ever
[2:53:42] happened to the church
[2:53:47] you don't want my revelation
[2:53:52] because you don't want my mind
[2:53:56] you don't want my life
[2:53:58] you don't want the things i have to deal
[2:54:00] with
[2:54:05] god gives me revelation according to my
[2:54:08] personal needs
[2:54:10] my personal makeup
[2:54:13] my personal approach
[2:54:19] and you've got to have it for you
[2:54:21] personally
[2:54:23] it's the personal revelation of yourself
[2:54:28] that we need
[2:54:30] we need the personal revelation
[2:54:34] of ourselves
[2:54:39] because what you are
[2:54:41] is christ in you
[2:54:44] christ in you
[2:54:46] is the hope of glory
[2:54:49] [Applause]
[2:54:52] the word
[2:54:53] in you
[2:54:54] is the hope of glory
[2:54:57] the hope of your glory
[2:55:00] lies in the word that he put in you
[2:55:05] the hope of the rapture
[2:55:08] is what he put in you
[2:55:10] that's the word
[2:55:12] that we need
[2:55:14] revelation of we need the hope
[2:55:17] and the revelation
[2:55:20] lord
[2:55:21] yes
[2:55:23] help my unbelief
[2:55:27] what is it
[2:55:29] that you disbelieve with or unbelieve
[2:55:31] with
[2:55:34] yourself
[2:55:37] you're your own worst enemy
[2:55:42] so god gave you something
[2:55:44] it's in there
[2:55:46] we need to pursue it
[2:55:48] we need to pray for it we need to ask
[2:55:51] for it
[2:55:52] god
[2:55:53] give me
[2:55:55] divine
[2:55:56] revelation
[2:55:58] anyway

[2:56:13] i really believe that brother brandon
[2:56:15] preached this message
[2:56:17] at the time that he did
[2:56:20] because he knew the time would come when
[2:56:23] man would no longer wish to retain god
[2:56:26] in their knowledge
[2:56:29] but they just didn't want him no more
[2:56:31] but let's brought our heads and
[2:56:35] let's ask the lord this morning
[2:56:40] you say brother david do you need
[2:56:42] revelation i need a lot of revelation

[2:57:13] things about myself that only you know
[2:57:19] lord i always marvel that every time
[2:57:22] someone
[2:57:24] approached you
[2:57:27] you dealt with the secrets of their
[2:57:29] heart
[2:57:32] the things that nobody else knew
[2:57:39] [Music]
[2:57:41] you spoke
[2:57:43] to that
[2:57:45] inner man that
[2:57:47] inner place in the heart
[2:57:50] he never entered into a theological
[2:57:52] discussion
[2:57:54] [Music]
[2:57:56] even the woman at the well when she
[2:57:58] wanted to
[2:58:02] had a theological question

[2:58:13] with theology

[2:58:18] that i had

[2:58:34] to draw with
[2:58:37] how how can i get this water
[2:58:43] he answered her go get your husband
[2:58:48] she said i don't have a husband
[2:58:53] you spoke true
[2:58:56] not only do you don't have a husband the
[2:58:58] one you're with not your husband but
[2:59:00] you've had five
[2:59:02] oh

[2:59:08] now he was going with revelation to what
[2:59:11] she had needed
[2:59:13] now she was drinking from the fountain
[2:59:18] [Music]
[2:59:20] and what she ran into the city
[2:59:24] and said come see a man that's told me

[2:59:37] effect it's had on me
[2:59:40] lord and this morning

[3:00:18] in order at the closing of this tape
[3:00:20] [Music]
[3:00:23] i was going to read it
[3:00:29] but your prophet told the story of the
[3:00:31] woman that
[3:00:33] she taught sunday school
[3:00:35] [Music]
[3:00:38] she went to church
[3:00:39] [Music]
[3:00:44] and for some reason she
[3:00:47] connected a disease and
[3:00:50] she was dying
[3:00:53] and he said the sunday school choir
[3:00:57] showed up to sing
[3:00:59] while she was passing away
[3:01:02] and the pastor was there
[3:01:05] to hold her hand
[3:01:10] and then faced with reality
[3:01:14] she screamed out i'm lost
[3:01:19] i'm lost
[3:01:23] and the pastor put out a cigarette and
[3:01:25] he went running in there and she said
[3:01:27] you lying deceiver
[3:01:30] i'm lost
[3:01:33] [Music]
[3:01:34] and they said oh oh go get the hype
[3:01:37] hypodermic needle
[3:01:40] don't go shoot her up with drugs
[3:01:46] and she was crying out
[3:01:50] for something real
[3:01:52] [Music]

[3:01:56] lives

[3:02:03] you put the control tower
[3:02:06] and i'm asking every heart in here this
[3:02:09] morning
[3:02:10] if that alarm's been going off in your
[3:02:13] life
[3:02:15] that you need more of god
[3:02:18] that alarm's been going off in your life
[3:02:21] but your nature and your personality
[3:02:23] isn't what it should be
[3:02:25] if that alarm's been going off in your
[3:02:28] life that you lack understanding
[3:02:30] [Music]
[3:02:34] don't turn it off
[3:02:37] don't call it's a little feeling
[3:02:40] [Music]
[3:02:43] it's a thirst in you
[3:02:46] calling because god's got something for
[3:02:49] you
[3:02:51] [Music]
[3:02:56] maybe you just don't understand why is
[3:02:58] my life the way it is
[3:03:01] why am i the way how did i get into this
