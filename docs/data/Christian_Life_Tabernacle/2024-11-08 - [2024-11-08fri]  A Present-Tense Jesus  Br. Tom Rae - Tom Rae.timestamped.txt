[1:04:43] baptismal uh uh painting for us and we
[1:04:47] really appreciate that that sister
[1:04:49] Maryland uh of course I gave her a hard
[1:04:52] time every stroke you know I I tell her
[1:04:55] she needed to put a boat on the river
[1:04:57] and and there should be a guy no why
[1:05:00] don't you turn it into them casting the
[1:05:02] Nets and and uh but she she endured she
[1:05:07] had a
[1:05:08] vision and she stayed with it and she
[1:05:11] endured and it came out and and uh so
[1:05:15] you know I told her like any artist you
[1:05:17] have a drive in you and I just said
[1:05:20] Maryland it's perfect don't sit there
[1:05:22] thinking of what else you could
[1:05:24] do to the pain to make it better so I to
[1:05:28] have that touch I I felt led of the Lord
[1:05:30] in my heart and I wanted the family to
[1:05:33] be a part of what we are here so I I
[1:05:38] appreciate that all very very very much
[1:05:41] you know every
[1:05:43] year um when we have a meeting we call
[1:05:46] this our dedicating dedication service
[1:05:50] and really we we all know that
[1:05:52] everything should be a dedication in our
[1:05:55] lives but we set this time aside to
[1:05:59] thank the Lord for allowing us to build
[1:06:02] this to get through the struggles that
[1:06:07] it's taken to have resolved to go
[1:06:11] through the
[1:06:12] resistance that was raised and uh and to
[1:06:18] persevere and it took all of your
[1:06:21] efforts it took all of your money it
[1:06:24] took all of your time
[1:06:26] and uh all of you should be uh thankful
[1:06:30] and proud of what that the Lord has done
[1:06:34] for us and so in doing this the theme
[1:06:39] for the meeting which came to my heart
[1:06:44] was um came to me out of the
[1:06:49] Gospel of uh St Luke and it said simply
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:56] it said and he said unto them how is it
[1:07:00] that ye sought me wish ye
[1:07:04] know that know not that I must be about
[1:07:09] my father's
[1:07:11] business and I thought well what's what
[1:07:14] what is the theme it just came onto my
[1:07:16] heart that the theme of this meeting is
[1:07:18] to be about our father's
[1:07:22] business to be about our father's
[1:07:25] business bus and in the gospel of
[1:07:29] Mark it reads like this in the first
[1:07:32] chapter in the 35th verse it says in the
[1:07:35] morning riseth up a great while before
[1:07:39] day he went out and departed into a
[1:07:43] solitary place and there
[1:07:46] prayed and
[1:07:48] Simon and they that were with him
[1:07:52] followed after him and when they they
[1:07:55] had found him they said unto him all men
[1:08:00] seek for thee and Jesus said unto them
[1:08:05] let us go into the next towns that I may
[1:08:10] preach there also for therefore came I
[1:08:15] forth and we know we have a Great
[1:08:17] Commission to go into all the world and
[1:08:20] preach the
[1:08:22] gospel and my heart's desire for the
[1:08:25] church is to return back to the father's
[1:08:29] business to return back to the things
[1:08:33] that pertaineth to the purpose for why
[1:08:37] that he's placed us here and then our
[1:08:41] messenger made this statement and I
[1:08:43] thought it was so wonderfully
[1:08:47] spoken and he said but my main
[1:08:50] achievement is to preach the
[1:08:53] gospel through the church church and do
[1:08:57] all that I can do to bring honor to
[1:09:00] Jesus Christ in this day while I'm here
[1:09:04] on Earth and what time I have left on
[1:09:08] Earth I come to try to say something to
[1:09:12] you that would help you and I I pray
[1:09:16] that this meeting many times we approach
[1:09:18] a service and we approach a meeting and
[1:09:23] we say Lord I have this need and Lord I
[1:09:26] have that need and we Heap our needs on
[1:09:29] the Altar and we sit there and and we're
[1:09:33] just waiting to receive some form of
[1:09:37] blessing some form of uh
[1:09:41] uh I don't know just a gift of some sort
[1:09:45] and my heart turned to said Lord I want
[1:09:49] to
[1:09:51] listen I want to Incline my ear to you
[1:09:55] this
[1:09:56] evening and lay my burdens down lay my
[1:10:02] desires lay down lay my needs down
[1:10:06] because you know what I have need of
[1:10:08] even before that I have and put in my
[1:10:13] heart just to close
[1:10:15] out all the confusion and all the things
[1:10:20] around us and all the things that I
[1:10:23] think that I have need of and just sit
[1:10:26] at his feet and
[1:10:30] listen and I believe with all my heart
[1:10:32] that he wants
[1:10:34] to speak to not only us as a church our
[1:10:40] church here what we call Christian
[1:10:44] Life but to speak to us as
[1:10:47] individuals that he might fit us and
[1:10:49] join us
[1:10:51] together in one perfect union
[1:10:56] with him and with one another and so to
[1:11:00] this evening I come to sit at his
[1:11:03] feet I believe that he chose a
[1:11:07] vessel and he'll use that vessel's voice
[1:11:11] and that vessel's voice will become the
[1:11:13] voice of God that's right and it
[1:11:17] speak and I can
[1:11:19] hear and I can
[1:11:21] believe and if I hear and believe what
[1:11:24] is spoken will come to pass that's my
[1:11:27] heart's
[1:11:28] desire you know and you know the lord
[1:11:31] loves you so therefore he wants to speak
[1:11:34] to you it doesn't always have to be
[1:11:37] correction it can be many other things
[1:11:40] that he has to say for you so brother
[1:11:42] Tom I'm thankful that you sacrificed to
[1:11:45] come brother Michael we're
[1:11:49] sincerely here to hear what God that
[1:11:52] would
[1:11:53] speak if we don't
[1:11:56] say Amen we don't show any emotion we
[1:12:00] sit here as cold as an ice cube we want
[1:12:04] you to know one thing we're listening to
[1:12:07] what you say that what you speak might
[1:12:10] be manifested in flesh in our lives so
[1:12:14] let's Stand
[1:12:17] Together what's what I
[1:12:19] said I know what I'm going to
[1:12:22] sing this poor man cried
[1:12:30] this just kind of
[1:12:32] became me and brother

[1:12:39] got so in the
[1:12:41] spirit we were stagging around out here

[1:12:48] said boy he said you and brother Tom
[1:12:50] were drunk tonight I said praise God

[1:12:58] that we have in sincerity I I don't want

[1:22:18] Ben we Rejoice
[1:22:21] together I looked at a little bit of
[1:22:23] history of
[1:22:25] and this is not the dedication service
[1:22:26] this is just me just calming my
[1:22:30] butterflies 1978 I believe right 1978 if
[1:22:35] I'm wrong screaming you're wrong okay
[1:22:38] thank
[1:22:39] you Christian Life
[1:22:42] Tabernacle I thought this was an unusual
[1:22:45] statement that you have it was called a
[1:22:49] city set on a
[1:22:52] hill and when we built overdale Bible
[1:22:55] Way brother Ken can attest to it we've
[1:22:57] called it The Church on the Hill and I
[1:23:01] thought that that's nice ring that's a
[1:23:04] nice
[1:23:05] ring you've been proclaiming the Gospel
[1:23:07] of Jesus Christ that's been restored
[1:23:10] through the fullness by God through his
[1:23:13] servant God's prophet and I'm not
[1:23:16] ashamed to Proclaim and his name is
[1:23:20] William Maran brandham
[1:23:31] everything's bigger in
[1:23:34] Texas have you ever heard that
[1:23:37] saying you heard that yeah I checked it
[1:23:43] up see you can check
[1:23:48] anything over time the saying everything
[1:23:52] is bigger in Texas has gained
[1:23:55] traction and firmly embedded in the
[1:23:58] culture of the fabric of the
[1:24:03] state it was used to describe a wide
[1:24:06] range of things from the size of Texas
[1:24:10] Stakes portions of
[1:24:14] food and that I can
[1:24:16] attest look at
[1:24:21] me to the law uh to the state
[1:24:25] Larger than Life in all its teams and
[1:24:28] events that they put
[1:24:32] on a born Texan has instilled in his
[1:24:36] system a mindset of No Retreat and no
[1:24:40] surrender now you're getting to my
[1:24:43] territory I might want to be a
[1:24:49] Texan no
[1:24:52] retreat I'd love that to be a little
[1:24:55] thing on on your fridge no
[1:24:58] retreat no surrender Satan they might
[1:25:03] use that for the world but I'm going to
[1:25:06] take it in the reality of the word of
[1:25:08] God I will not
[1:25:11] surrender no sir and I'll never
[1:25:15] Retreat so I thought that is that is
[1:25:17] something natural typing is spiritual
[1:25:20] not all Texans can say
[1:25:23] this but but you that are here as
[1:25:26] Believers can truly say no
[1:25:30] surrender no
[1:25:32] retreat another saying they had on I'm
[1:25:35] sure this is all I mean this is you've
[1:25:37] known this from your school days so this
[1:25:40] is
[1:25:41] just I love
[1:25:45] Texas because Texans think anything's
[1:25:51] possible
[1:25:53] ah I I think all believers should move
[1:25:55] to
[1:25:57] Texas a prophet preaches all things
[1:26:01] are ah just a second now I'm in Texas
[1:26:05] now I all
[1:26:08] than this is your slogans not
[1:26:12] mine but knowing then that we're not
[1:26:15] Texans I'm not British Colombian I'm not
[1:26:19] Canadian I am a
[1:26:22] Christian so really what happens they
[1:26:25] take what we are and use it to their
[1:26:28] benefit so I think we should be able to
[1:26:30] take what they say they are and we can
[1:26:33] say what we really
[1:26:36] are then I can say I love
[1:26:40] Christianity I love Jesus Christ because
[1:26:44] with Jesus Christ all things are
[1:26:47] possible
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:56] so indeed can I say all things are
[1:26:59] bigger in
[1:27:01] Texas
[1:27:03] yeah I think you got biggest hearts I've
[1:27:10] known
[1:27:12] yeah we have all these little slogans
[1:27:14] and things that we use and side remarks
[1:27:17] but when you get it down to your own
[1:27:20] life if everything is bigger in Texas
[1:27:23] than I've got a bigger heart for
[1:27:26] Christ and that's what
[1:27:29] matters so when you look at the Church
[1:27:32] of the Living God here the local church
[1:27:35] here I can say then it's
[1:27:40] true all
[1:27:42] things are
[1:27:44] bigger in
[1:27:46] Texas because our
[1:27:49] hearts are won by Christ's
[1:27:52] love God bless bless
[1:27:55] you God bless your devotion and your
[1:27:58] dedication through this project and as
[1:28:01] we will say other things over the next
[1:28:04] course of these next few days and I feel
[1:28:10] humbled to be then a part of this great
[1:28:13] event for you I I know you've been in
[1:28:16] the new church and it's lovely this is
[1:28:19] the first time I walked through the
[1:28:21] doors
[1:28:27] and you see and I know in a project I
[1:28:31] know we know what a project takes we
[1:28:33] know the effort the burden a pastor
[1:28:37] takes and trustees and deacons we we
[1:28:40] know
[1:28:41] that we thank God for every labor of
[1:28:44] love every prayer prayed every dollar
[1:28:47] given to make what this little building
[1:28:49] is it's lovely it's to the credit of the
[1:28:52] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:28:56] and I thank the Lord Jesus for this
[1:28:58] place this Lighthouse truly a city on
[1:29:03] the
[1:29:05] hill so without any further delay can we
[1:29:09] stand to our feet you've heard enough of
[1:29:15] Texas St John chapter 14
[1:29:29] it's one of my
[1:29:30] favorite every time I say that everybody
[1:29:33] I say well Romans 8 is my favorite then
[1:29:36] I'll say John 14 is my favorite then I
[1:29:38] might as well just say every chapter in
[1:29:40] the book's my favorite amen but St John
[1:29:44] chapter 14 is indeed one of my favorite
[1:29:47] chapters and we shall read from St John
[1:29:50] 14
[1:29:53] verse1 let not your heart be troubled
[1:29:56] you believed in God believe also in
[1:29:58] me in my father's house are many
[1:30:01] mansions and if it were not so I would

[1:30:44] unto him Lord we know not whether thou

[1:30:50] way Jesus said unto him I am the
[1:30:55] way the truth the life and no man cometh
[1:31:01] unto the father but by me amen and if
[1:31:05] you know me you shall have known my
[1:31:08] father also and from henceforth you know
[1:31:12] him and have seen him Philip said unto
[1:31:15] him Lord show us the father and it
[1:31:18] sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him

[1:31:30] that has seen me has seen the father and
[1:31:35] how sayest thou show us the father let's
[1:31:40] bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:31:42] Heavenly Father we've read your word
[1:31:45] we've looked at this lovely group of
[1:31:48] people this beautiful building that has
[1:31:50] been erected Lord God we just pray that
[1:31:53] your glory would fill every Temple and
[1:31:56] that the word of God will thrill our
[1:31:58] hearts tonight we ask in Jesus name amen
[1:32:03] you may have your
[1:32:06] seats apparently I get I have a
[1:32:11] reputation I have a
[1:32:14] reputation and
[1:32:16] uh Billy did it to me brother
[1:32:20] Billy Brother Gary where's Brother Gary
[1:32:23] there's brother
[1:32:25] Gary Matthew there's brother
[1:32:28] Matthew and then the pastor so I figur
[1:32:31] I'm they're all in good company said
[1:32:34] brother Tom you're going to preach out
[1:32:35] to Christ is the mystery of God
[1:32:40] revealed I said how do you know that
[1:32:43] after these many
[1:32:44] years and thus my first quote is out of
[1:32:48] Christ The
[1:32:50] Mystery of God revealed so is brother
[1:32:53] Dave David has Pastor mcari may I give
[1:32:57] the correct
[1:32:59] title as he has said I I like an excited
[1:33:03] Church don't you worry but I don't I
[1:33:06] don't like excitement and
[1:33:09] forgetfulness right oh that was a great
[1:33:11] service what did I
[1:33:17] preach and and that is a
[1:33:22] discredit and so then we want to be able
[1:33:25] to say something that you can
[1:33:28] deposit and if if you're living it shout
[1:33:31] it if you're not say
[1:33:34] ouch and say I want to live it I'm going
[1:33:38] to live
[1:33:39] it and the devil's a
[1:33:41] liar but the word is
[1:33:46] true so we know we're living in a
[1:33:48] particular day it's called The Coming of
[1:33:51] the
[1:33:52] Lord brother brah said in one in one
[1:33:55] place he says you don't look for the
[1:33:57] Rapture he said the Rapture is already
[1:33:59] in
[1:34:00] you so at that day you will know that
[1:34:06] I'm in the Father the father's in me I
[1:34:09] in you and you in me we've got that
[1:34:13] that's
[1:34:14] scripture that's scripture at that
[1:34:17] Day verse 20 at that day is everybody
[1:34:21] looking at me okay I just I'm just
[1:34:23] making sure cuz I'm looking at you you
[1:34:25] know it's like in a living room you know
[1:34:28] you look away and you're not that shows
[1:34:29] me you're not
[1:34:30] interested so I I get I like interest so
[1:34:34] at that
[1:34:35] day we say that's this day right that's
[1:34:39] what Jesus said You shall know that I'm
[1:34:42] in the
[1:34:44] father and you in
[1:34:47] me and I in
[1:34:50] you so now was it in can can we say well
[1:34:54] was that in Luther's day we could say
[1:34:56] yes a
[1:34:58] portion can we say in Wesley's day yes
[1:35:01] indeed a portion can we say in Pentecost
[1:35:04] we can say yes a
[1:35:06] portion but now brother Brandon preaches
[1:35:09] a message desperation the
[1:35:11] fullness the fullness of God is dwelling
[1:35:16] in a body now if he's dwelling in us
[1:35:20] then there's benefits to the life that's
[1:35:23] in us that we're no longer the Church of
[1:35:29] feelings okay yeah and sorry honey I got
[1:35:33] to do it just one time okay I see I can
[1:35:36] get yep yep yep yep I can count those in
[1:35:38] my brain I got 20 over
[1:35:41] here and I got a few amens over there
[1:35:45] that's fine I want you to all
[1:35:48] agree just all agree that I have Christ
[1:35:52] in me yes and if Christ is in me then I
[1:35:57] draw all the benefits of that God in
[1:36:01] Me Not Looking to
[1:36:03] yesterday but we have to start looking
[1:36:06] to what we are today so we say there's
[1:36:08] going to be a Rapture brother Tom when's
[1:36:10] that Rapture going to happen well if it
[1:36:12] happens right now we don't put it off
[1:36:14] till tomorrow say it's going to happen
[1:36:17] tomorrow no today is the day of your
[1:36:21] salvation it's this day
[1:36:25] the problem of us is we put everything
[1:36:27] off till
[1:36:28] tomorrow but God is a god of the present
[1:36:31] that's right you say well I I know God
[1:36:34] of the past and I know God of the future
[1:36:37] but we need to know the god of the
[1:36:40] present then if you know the god of the
[1:36:42] present then you can be a real
[1:36:45] Texan woo walked right into that one
[1:36:49] didn't
[1:36:51] you because a true Christian
[1:36:54] says all things are
[1:37:00] possible what
[1:37:02] day what day going to be tomorrow how
[1:37:07] about right now I don't care what your
[1:37:09] need is I know a God that meets your
[1:37:11] need right
[1:37:12] now I know victory is yours right now
[1:37:15] healing is yours right now Deliverance
[1:37:17] is yours right now
[1:37:25] grace of God revealed Jesus said at that
[1:37:28] day that's this day at that day when
[1:37:32] this
[1:37:32] Revelation is made known you will know
[1:37:37] I'm in the father and the father in me I
[1:37:40] in you and you in me now notice what he
[1:37:44] said here when this Revelation is made
[1:37:48] known not this nope that's not going to
[1:37:52] do your knowledge isn't going to do
[1:37:53] anything for
[1:37:55] you but revelation will do everything
[1:37:59] for
[1:38:01] you and that is the most important
[1:38:04] Michael and I were talking about it a
[1:38:05] brother preached back home on Wednesday
[1:38:07] night you brother Bram said in a message
[1:38:10] you can never
[1:38:12] overemphasize Revelation enough it's the
[1:38:16] most important thing to pray for are you
[1:38:20] listening it's the most important thing
[1:38:23] to pray for in the whole
[1:38:28] world see you see a lot of times we we
[1:38:31] we we cut quotes to fit what we want to
[1:38:35] say but rather than take the whole
[1:38:38] quote it's the most important thing in
[1:38:42] the whole
[1:38:44] world so as I was looking to the Lord
[1:38:47] this afternoon Jesus said at that day
[1:38:50] that's this day at that day when this
[1:38:54] Revelation is now made known you will
[1:38:57] know that I'm in the Father the father
[1:38:59] in me I in you you and me when the
[1:39:03] Revelation is made manifest at that day
[1:39:06] you'll know that I and the father are
[1:39:08] one so now Jesus said when you've seen
[1:39:11] me you've seen the father so now where
[1:39:15] do we get to the point where I want to
[1:39:18] see
[1:39:20] Jesus uh-huh but already you you're
[1:39:24] already bound up by your own self
[1:39:27] analysis y you're all bound up by now
[1:39:30] well how could I be a Christian I blew
[1:39:32] it there I blew this here I blew that
[1:39:33] you will blow it today tomorrow and the
[1:39:37] next day but there's something in you
[1:39:40] that does not want to blow it today
[1:39:42] tomorrow and the next day and that's why
[1:39:45] the blood of Christ is
[1:39:46] here to cleanse you
[1:39:50] from from what all sin so what does that
[1:39:55] do drive out
[1:39:56] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:39:59] Jesus there's therefore now
[1:40:02] no
[1:40:04] condemnation so when you see Tom on who
[1:40:08] do you see well you see a white hair guy
[1:40:12] maybe not so white-haired 14 years ago
[1:40:15] and I think I
[1:40:17] was Joel Joel my youngest boy said dad I
[1:40:21] don't even know what you look like
[1:40:23] before because I've only known you as
[1:40:29] white well that might be
[1:40:32] true and I've had wa here for a long
[1:40:34] long time and I've had and his body is
[1:40:36] getting older but somebody told me the
[1:40:39] other day how old are you brother Tom or
[1:40:41] asked me the question how old are you
[1:40:43] brother Tom I said how how old do you
[1:40:46] think well sometimes I see you running
[1:40:49] around and I think you're pretty
[1:40:51] young I says okay well then how old am I
[1:40:55] he says I don't know but you look
[1:41:01] old that that really hurt right so I he
[1:41:06] says I said well how how I said I'm 70
[1:41:10] he says well how does sany feel
[1:41:13] like I these inquiry
[1:41:16] kids I said I don't know I've never been
[1:41:18] this way
[1:41:21] before you know I I don't know where
[1:41:23] you're supposed to feel like at 70 I I
[1:41:26] just happen to be whatever I am and and
[1:41:30] and and I am what I am but one
[1:41:34] day mm one glorious moment could be will
[1:41:39] I'm standing right here because that
[1:41:41] prophecy that is a prophetic message and
[1:41:44] it said at that day and I got to believe
[1:41:46] it's this day it could happen right as
[1:41:48] I'm standing at this pulpit and you'd
[1:41:50] see a 5 foot6 man blond hair
[1:41:54] skinny
[1:41:56] ER I just G you but now remember let
[1:42:00] I'll give you some hope here because
[1:42:02] some of you have looked at some of our
[1:42:04] old wedding
[1:42:05] pictures and had I I've been insulted in
[1:42:08] my own home I mean whose wedding
[1:42:11] pictures would I have in my
[1:42:14] home really do I clut
[1:42:19] yours never you have your own so I've
[1:42:23] got my own there's my darling wife and
[1:42:26] there's me so they opened the book and
[1:42:29] they looked at and said who's
[1:42:33] that what an insult well who else would
[1:42:36] it
[1:42:39] be well we can see
[1:42:42] Joanne oh yeah she married another guy I
[1:42:44] don't know
[1:42:46] him come
[1:42:48] on but let me give you an idea when when
[1:42:52] Peter James and John went to mount
[1:42:54] Transfiguration did they have cameras in
[1:42:56] their
[1:42:58] day but they knew
[1:43:01] Moses they
[1:43:03] knew Elijah how did they know him they
[1:43:07] knew him by
[1:43:09] Revelation and as the Rapture is one
[1:43:11] more Revelation it will take a
[1:43:14] revelation for you to know who David
[1:43:16] migiri
[1:43:17] is Tom Ray
[1:43:21] is right mhm so the older we get the
[1:43:25] bigger the
[1:43:28] surprise Michael won't change that much
[1:43:31] he'll probably have blonde hair
[1:43:35] again but we're living in a
[1:43:39] day that and and really Church we're
[1:43:42] moving in an hour that we're not playing
[1:43:46] church we didn't come to to warm a Pew
[1:43:50] or we didn't come to just lift up our
[1:43:52] hands or showed amen or do whatever we
[1:43:55] came to meet him and to know him is life
[1:44:00] eternal and that is a very key part
[1:44:03] because we can know about
[1:44:05] Jesus and that's just putting on
[1:44:09] religion but to know him is life and
[1:44:12] life
[1:44:13] eternal so there's a day that we're
[1:44:15] talking about this day this scripture or
[1:44:20] can I say this prophecy is being f
[1:44:23] fulfilled in your
[1:44:26] ears and don't come and Nash on me and
[1:44:28] want to put me over the hill but when
[1:44:31] Jesus made the Declaration open the book
[1:44:34] The Scroll was open the book was open
[1:44:38] and Jesus pointed the scripture of where
[1:44:42] and who he was because he stated who he
[1:44:46] was the Bible says those men then
[1:44:51] desired to kill him that's right that's
[1:44:54] right so even when you start
[1:44:59] confessing who you
[1:45:01] are and I won't say it's the devil on
[1:45:04] the people but if is it really you are
[1:45:11] Christ what your problem is is the
[1:45:17] veil the badger
[1:45:21] skin The Mask as I preached here about
[1:45:23] seven or eight years
[1:45:25] ago and it's really a time where we need
[1:45:29] to look past the mask the veil the
[1:45:33] badger skin and look at one another and
[1:45:36] say she's my brother or she's my
[1:45:40] brother wow she's my sister he's my
[1:45:45] brother rather than hey you know about
[1:45:48] her do you know what he
[1:45:51] did mhm
[1:45:54] well let me ask you a question you have
[1:45:56] not been caught in
[1:45:57] adultery and they threw her a lady that
[1:46:00] according to the law was to be stoned
[1:46:04] right threw her at the feet of the
[1:46:11] word and she's laying there and they're
[1:46:15] wanting to Stone
[1:46:17] her but what did the word
[1:46:20] say here's a here's a great one for
[1:46:23] everyone to understand he that is
[1:46:26] without
[1:46:28] sin casts the first
[1:46:33] stone somehow we feel this
[1:46:37] self-righteousness maybe because we
[1:46:40] listened to three tapes that day and
[1:46:42] read your
[1:46:44] Bible when you read and you pray and you
[1:46:48] listen to the word the word will never
[1:46:52] cause you to raise your
[1:46:54] self-righteousness
[1:46:59] up amen and by in prayer in prayer
[1:47:04] anybody know how to pray here get down
[1:47:06] and pray you cannot hate anybody when
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:12] pray you've come out of the odor of the
[1:47:15] Rose of
[1:47:16] Sharon mhm the lily of the valley and
[1:47:19] that little that person that you had
[1:47:21] with up hurt with and like that when you
[1:47:25] come out of that presence you try and
[1:47:26] have
[1:47:27] that so the key of it is stay in that
[1:47:32] presence that that's the
[1:47:34] key that's the day we're living in we
[1:47:37] say I want to be uh to be like
[1:47:41] Jesus and we all got that Heavenly look
[1:47:44] on our
[1:47:49] face go out there and somebody cut you
[1:47:52] off
[1:47:54] mhm in the parking
[1:48:01] lot don't they know I'm an elder here
[1:48:03] and that's my
[1:48:09] spot he'll correct everything after I'm
[1:48:14] gone but it's so quickly because we let
[1:48:18] emotion we let
[1:48:21] stuff get us done down when the word is
[1:48:25] to lift you
[1:48:26] up lift you up in Christ I can do all
[1:48:29] things through
[1:48:30] Christ that
[1:48:32] strengtheneth
[1:48:35] me so i' like to preach a little subject
[1:48:38] tonight I won't hold you long and I'll
[1:48:41] put my watch here so we won't have the
[1:48:44] emergencies people pick us
[1:48:48] up on the
[1:48:51] subject a present tense
[1:48:56] Jesus a present tense
[1:49:01] Jesus a gospel that is not
[1:49:05] past because God has no
[1:49:11] past he's
[1:49:13] God how do you put God who never did
[1:49:16] begin and never ended and put a past on
[1:49:20] God and that has never got a
[1:49:24] future because he's always will
[1:49:28] be but we have to have Now
[1:49:32] language because we've been put in a
[1:49:34] space of
[1:49:36] time and in that time then we get sort
[1:49:40] of you know emulsified
[1:49:44] idea of time and
[1:49:47] space and things that bother us when God
[1:49:51] is a god of
[1:49:54] infinity and he looks at you through the
[1:49:58] blood slain before the foundation of the
[1:50:01] world so let me ask you the
[1:50:04] question they that have accepted the new
[1:50:07] birth and Are Born Again by the power of
[1:50:10] the word and his
[1:50:14] Spirit those that have been washed by
[1:50:17] the blood of the
[1:50:20] Lamb those that God has cleanse him
[1:50:23] Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:50:30] Ghost what's your
[1:50:38] problem Oh Brother Tom don't worry we're
[1:50:42] just starting we're preaching on Sister
[1:50:45] Amy a present tense
[1:50:49] gospel but you say oh brother Tom I I
[1:50:53] I've got a scripture that comes against
[1:50:54] you on that I said give me the scripture
[1:50:56] then Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday
[1:50:59] today and forever that's scripture that
[1:51:03] is in the time
[1:51:06] element but whatever God was he is and
[1:51:10] whatever God is he will
[1:51:13] be and we just had a prophet prove that
[1:51:16] so we can't put God in a slot past or
[1:51:20] present or future he just is
[1:51:24] so I like to speak on a little subject a
[1:51:27] present tense gospel the god that always
[1:51:31] is not was or will be he
[1:51:36] is listen to what brother RM said in
[1:51:39] Mighty God unveiled before
[1:51:41] us Moses went down to
[1:51:44] Egypt told the church
[1:51:47] fathers that the Lord God had visit him
[1:51:52] in the
[1:51:54] name of the I
[1:51:58] am are everybody I'm I'm serious when
[1:52:02] when I preach I'm
[1:52:04] serious but there's a
[1:52:06] point if there's no point to preach why
[1:52:10] preach so there's a
[1:52:12] point so now God sends a prophet to
[1:52:15] bring a
[1:52:17] point at this time he says Moses went
[1:52:22] down to Egypt told the church fathers
[1:52:24] that the Lord God had visit them in the
[1:52:26] name of the I
[1:52:31] am brother brand goes on to say that
[1:52:34] name is present
[1:52:37] tense not I
[1:52:40] was will
[1:52:42] be but I
[1:52:46] am right now we should be a say I don't
[1:52:49] want emotion but I'll give you some
[1:52:51] emotion to me that is glor
[1:52:55] yes Glory then the god that walked on
[1:52:59] the Sea of Galilee it's the same God
[1:53:02] that's in this
[1:53:04] building Hallelujah same God that broke
[1:53:08] bread broke fish heal the
[1:53:12] sick come on stay with me sing God that
[1:53:16] Open the Eyes of the blind is the same
[1:53:19] God that is here right now
[1:53:25] Hallelujah because he's a god of the I
[1:53:29] am and we're the only ones that slot God
[1:53:33] into
[1:53:34] something that's right because of I'm
[1:53:37] too tired I've got a job I got to do
[1:53:40] tomorrow listen let's get in a realm of
[1:53:42] heavenly
[1:53:43] places uhhuh that's why this message
[1:53:46] came for to lift you into Heavenly
[1:53:49] places what the prophet said lift you
[1:53:52] the heavy Heavenly places
[1:53:56] always if you want to look it up
[1:53:59] greatest battle ever
[1:54:01] fought so the god of the I
[1:54:04] am
[1:54:06] hallelujah praise the Lord you mean the
[1:54:09] god that parted the Red Sea that God is
[1:54:13] the I
[1:54:15] am the god that parted
[1:54:19] Jordan is the god of the I am
[1:54:22] the God that was with William
[1:54:25] brandham is the god of the I am the god

[2:04:08] God that has men right 66 books and you
[2:04:13] can't put it together doesn't mean God's

[2:10:52] little bit this way and that way Saints
[2:10:54] every service is
[2:10:57] different and that's what I love about
[2:10:59] God his gifts are all
[2:11:02] different so nobody brother Braham did
[2:11:05] not have to put a tag on and say I'm
[2:11:07] Malachi 4 nope he lived it and by living
[2:11:13] it people said you're a prophet you're a
[2:11:17] prophet only a prophet could do this
[2:11:20] Jesus you're a prophet ET only a prophet
[2:11:23] John are You Jesus I'm not worthy to
[2:11:26] unlatch your shoes he lived
[2:11:30] life and he didn't have the finest suit
[2:11:32] on either he had camel hair long beard
[2:11:37] but they thought he was a Christ how
[2:11:39] come his
[2:11:42] words what he spoke yes sir what he
[2:11:46] spoke amen and that is the part that we
[2:11:49] need to play now
[2:11:51] how we speaking young ladies let me tell
[2:11:55] you something looking at any one of
[2:11:57] these fellas right here that you think
[2:11:58] is a hunk is going to be
[2:12:07] fat okay that's half
[2:12:09] [Laughter]
[2:12:15] time than what he is
[2:12:19] now and young ladies or young men as you
[2:12:23] look at these beautiful young ladies
[2:12:25] they're going to have gray hair wrinkles
[2:12:28] and whatever brother BR said we do not
[2:12:31] look at
[2:12:32] the out we look at
[2:12:36] the
[2:12:38] ah okay because the inside is character
[2:12:42] and that character is a victory and that
[2:12:44] Victory comes from
[2:12:47] Christ Christ this very present gospel
[2:12:52] he's not the I was he's not the I will
[2:12:55] be but he said I'm the I am the same
[2:12:59] yesterday today and forever he's a
[2:13:04] present tense and that's why brother
[2:13:06] Brenham could take the scripture then as
[2:13:08] we said earlier he's the same yesterday
[2:13:10] today and forever because he's present
[2:13:14] tense present
[2:13:16] tense and God said unto Moses I am that
[2:13:20] I am
[2:13:22] thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[2:13:24] Israel I am sent
[2:13:28] you I
[2:13:30] am I'm not just a god of history but I'm
[2:13:34] a god of the I am I'm not a god of the
[2:13:38] future but I'm a god of the
[2:13:41] what the I
[2:13:43] am so now let's live in the
[2:13:46] present is now God pleased with us in
[2:13:49] the I am now
[2:13:53] let
[2:13:55] me move along and I'll try and move
[2:13:58] along real fast you're pulling real good
[2:14:00] but I'm taking so
[2:14:08] long turn with me please to Genesis
[2:14:14] 1:1 started at Genesis 1:1 say brother
[2:14:17] Tom are you going to take us to
[2:14:17] revelation 22
[2:14:21] you I have it in here so you might
[2:14:26] be Genesis 1:1 can we read it together
[2:14:29] please in the beginning God created the
[2:14:33] Heaven and the earth
[2:14:37] when in the beginning what does that
[2:14:40] convey then to the reader if you start
[2:14:43] studying out whether it be
[2:14:46] Hebrew heric
[2:14:53] Greek a few other
[2:14:55] languages let's study out it word by
[2:14:58] word because every word is a word from
[2:15:03] God so it convey it conveys in the
[2:15:06] beginning
[2:15:08] God is showing to a people right off the
[2:15:14] start that he is a God that continues to
[2:15:19] be present with
[2:15:24] people in the beginning
[2:15:27] God so now what he's letting the people
[2:15:30] know the god that created all mankind is
[2:15:35] going to be with them in their
[2:15:38] creation okay so it conveys A continuing
[2:15:43] presence of
[2:15:45] God so now it also then shows to us that
[2:15:49] he's a god of Providence
[2:15:52] because God when he made let me put it
[2:15:55] this way Providence uh you know
[2:15:58] sometimes the words get you know for the
[2:16:00] children I wouldn't say the adults get
[2:16:02] confused on a word like
[2:16:05] Providence but Providence
[2:16:07] means god which
[2:16:11] provides right God provides for what is
[2:16:16] needed in the
[2:16:18] future so God's providential ha has
[2:16:22] always been because he was a lamb
[2:16:25] what
[2:16:28] when so his God's Divine Providence knew
[2:16:31] man would
[2:16:34] fall okay so God being God wasn't going
[2:16:38] to let his seed fall there was always
[2:16:44] blood always blood but it's not for
[2:16:47] serpent seed that's right it's only for
[2:16:50] you
[2:16:51] you for God's
[2:16:55] elect you say well these things happen
[2:16:57] they're good people I'm not saying
[2:16:59] they're bad people all I'm saying that
[2:17:02] there is a predestinated people and so
[2:17:06] then by God's grace we are
[2:17:09] predestinated by the forn knowledge of
[2:17:11] God I'd like to get into that so then in
[2:17:14] God's for knowledge he makes provision
[2:17:17] cuz he knew you would be born in sin and
[2:17:19] being born in sin had to be a sacrifice
[2:17:23] but that lamb had to come forth come to
[2:17:26] Calvary die on the cross wash you in the
[2:17:30] blood that lamb had to come this day to
[2:17:34] take the book and to open the book and
[2:17:37] to reveal your name in the
[2:17:40] book that's the Providence of God do not
[2:17:44] think the way man thinks think the way
[2:17:48] God thinks God knew the book was going
[2:17:51] to be closed but God knew Malachi 4 was
[2:17:56] coming God provided in his
[2:18:01] Providence
[2:18:03] Hallelujah and in that Providence it
[2:18:06] didn't have Dave CH buroff in the book
[2:18:10] it had the revelation of who he is in
[2:18:14] the
[2:18:16] [Applause]
[2:18:17] book I'm sorry friends Tom Ray was not
[2:18:20] written in the book book but the
[2:18:21] revelation of Tom Ray was in the
[2:18:24] book I caught the Revelation by the
[2:18:27] opening of the seals who I
[2:18:35] am been preaching on it for the last six
[2:18:37] seven months been preaching on this
[2:18:39] heels and this heals and this heals
[2:18:41] people get in their mind it's a book
[2:18:42] it's a book it's a book it's not a book
[2:18:44] it's
[2:18:46] Christ it's not a book it's the
[2:18:49] lamb amen it's the title deed he owned
[2:18:53] everything but he's telling you all
[2:18:56] leans all encumbrances everything
[2:18:59] against you shrien
[2:19:04] off and you're The
[2:19:06] Virtuous
[2:19:08] sinless
[2:19:11] spotless you only know that because the
[2:19:14] book's
[2:19:18] open they couldn't preach it
[2:19:21] till Malachi
[2:19:24] 4 couldn't preach it till Revelation
[2:19:27] 10:7 Luke
[2:19:29] 17:30 couldn't preach it but now we can
[2:19:33] preach it because now we're finding out
[2:19:35] who we are in the I
[2:19:44] am you're wearing me out
[2:19:48] already not good
[2:19:51] it's
[2:19:52] great when John saw his name in the book
[2:19:56] all Heaven oh and all the KN heard him
[2:20:01] say
[2:20:03] glory
[2:20:09] honor not to a man but to the King of
[2:20:14] Kings it's never to a man it's to Christ
[2:20:19] himself
[2:20:20] [Applause]
[2:20:25] Hallelujah God bless
[2:20:28] you to God be the
[2:20:31] glory no man open the book no one worthy
[2:20:34] to look on the book not one not John not
[2:20:40] Paul come on no one worthy to look on
[2:20:45] the book for 2,000 years no one worthy
[2:20:49] but then in this
[2:20:51] today he not only said look on the book
[2:20:55] take the book and eat
[2:20:57] [Applause]
[2:21:00] him oh it's just an expression it's more
[2:21:03] than an expression folk it's your gray
[2:21:05] matter again forget your gray matter get
[2:21:09] in love with
[2:21:14] Christ we get down to
[2:21:17] Doctrine and we've gone through them all
[2:21:19] don't you worry I've lived through
[2:21:22] them we've gone through them all and
[2:21:25] where are they
[2:21:26] today and where are the people wrecks on
[2:21:29] the side of the road because they never
[2:21:31] pointed them to Christ they pointed him
[2:21:34] to a Doctrine they pointed him to a man
[2:21:37] and when you do that you kill the effect
[2:21:39] of the
[2:21:42] word and it's God's grace that bring
[2:21:44] people out of
[2:21:46] doctrines so God has Mercy absolutely
[2:21:51] absolutely if I take the bigger bottle
[2:21:54] it's longer who wants to vote for this
[2:21:57] or
[2:21:59] this sorry I have to
[2:22:03] lose thank
[2:22:05] you I'm
[2:22:07] sorry but now what is God showing to us
[2:22:10] and we know the Providence of God is all
[2:22:12] for
[2:22:13] us it's all for us and can I ask you a
[2:22:17] question I don't want to get in my
[2:22:18] Sunday morning service what can separ
[2:22:20] separate us from this
[2:22:24] love
[2:22:26] nothing nothing at
[2:22:28] all
[2:22:30] nothing nothing at all is impossible
[2:22:34] come on Texon I mean
[2:22:38] Christians
[2:22:40] nothing can separate us from this
[2:22:44] Revelation you see people flying off
[2:22:46] like flies you'll see them go you'll see
[2:22:48] them run and you'll see them fall fall
[2:22:50] faster than people that you knew 10
[2:22:53] years ago they fall that fast but what's
[2:22:56] happening the Gap is getting great and
[2:22:59] we're going higher higher in the love of
[2:23:04] Jesus Higher in Christ so then in the
[2:23:08] beginning
[2:23:10] God conveys the continuing presence to
[2:23:13] his
[2:23:14] people he's not limited or Bound by time
[2:23:18] space or history
[2:23:22] shows that he's a god of
[2:23:24] Providence he continually cares over the
[2:23:28] governance of his
[2:23:31] creation God cares about
[2:23:34] you he's
[2:23:36] infinite there's no limit of any kind
[2:23:40] he's Sovereign he has authority to use
[2:23:42] his power when he wants he's the alls
[2:23:46] sufficient
[2:23:48] one he's the omn
[2:23:51] one now here now and this again let me
[2:23:54] help you I'm not using big words or
[2:23:57] brother I'm just using what the prophets
[2:23:58] said so you know you say well I don't
[2:24:01] know an omnicient I'm going to let you
[2:24:02] know what omniscient means not make it
[2:24:05] complicated omniscient means all things
[2:24:08] are known effortlessly and
[2:24:11] instantly he's
[2:24:12] omnicient that's why God can know all
[2:24:15] things and be everywhere because he
[2:24:17] knows everything that's why brother Bram
[2:24:20] said he he knows how much t a flea
[2:24:22] renders and how many times he bats his
[2:24:24] eye because he's
[2:24:26] God and we have a
[2:24:29] problem so now we have a a God that
[2:24:32] comes on the scene uses a mouthpiece
[2:24:34] calls William brandham to let us know
[2:24:37] who we are in Christ Christ is the
[2:24:39] mystery of God revealed in
[2:24:42] you come on stay with me now so now God
[2:24:46] God's in you the omnipotent all knowing
[2:24:49] all powerful
[2:24:53] okay so I'll slow down again omnicient
[2:24:57] Everybody Get It class we get it
[2:24:59] omnicient he knows
[2:25:01] what everything
[2:25:04] effortlessly he doesn't have to think
[2:25:07] Tom's gon to have a ham sandwich after
[2:25:12] [Laughter]
[2:25:14] church huh he doesn't have to think that
[2:25:17] he knows it he knows I'll have mustard

[2:27:41] brother Brown went around a cherry
[2:27:43] tree I can run around the
[2:27:46] throne mhm there he goes again
[2:27:53] Tom's been doing that for a million
[2:27:57] years what's it going to be like you got
[2:28:01] a city 1,500 miles high don't say you're
[2:28:07] homeless
[2:28:09] right 1500 miles high that's right you
[2:28:13] know how high that is
[2:28:17] high very high anybody from thr in a
[2:28:20] plane a Jet Plane yeah plane 36,500 and
[2:28:25] some on that's only 6 miles you haven't
[2:28:29] got off the
[2:28:31] base yeah think about it you know think
[2:28:36] about it 1,500 Mile High and on top of
[2:28:40] that
[2:28:42] City on top of the Mount
[2:28:48] Zion where this city where the
[2:28:51] lamb is the
[2:28:56] light the light today you walking in in
[2:28:59] blood is in the light is he in the light
[2:29:01] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[2:29:03] you from all
[2:29:05] sin that blood still has its working
[2:29:07] power and we're walking in that same
[2:29:10] light it's the I am light so we got a
[2:29:13] omnicient right we got everybody got
[2:29:15] that class how are we
[2:29:17] doing huh so we can at least leave here
[2:29:20] tonight knowing that my God knows all
[2:29:23] things without even
[2:29:30] thinking okay he knows everything now
[2:29:32] now now Lord do you care should never
[2:29:35] come out of our
[2:29:38] lips of course he
[2:29:41] cares do
[2:29:43] you that's what your Prophet preached he
[2:29:46] cares do you care of course he cares
[2:29:50] cares he's a god of
[2:29:53] Providence so a God knows your need and
[2:29:56] will supply your
[2:29:57] need so now he's omniscient so the next
[2:30:00] would be
[2:30:03] omnipresent so then omnipresent means he
[2:30:06] fills all space and all time and brother
[2:30:07] Bram said he can only do that because
[2:30:09] he's
[2:30:10] omnicient because he's the
[2:30:15] being then if he's omniscient knowing
[2:30:18] all things he's omn present fills all
[2:30:20] times in space he's
[2:30:24] omnipresent means that he's
[2:30:28] unlimited and able to do
[2:30:35] [Music]

[2:30:43] omniscience the

[2:58:36] name amen say pass it to the
[2:58:40] pastor move the
[2:58:44] immovable break the Unbreakable
[2:58:48] [Music]
[2:59:01] see
[2:59:05] [Music]
[2:59:19] if I ever heard a quote
[2:59:23] explained to me tonight it came so real
[2:59:27] to me the prophet of God said if you
[2:59:31] have eternal life you always
[2:59:35] had eternal
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:41] life to know him for what that he is
[2:59:48] a present tense
[2:59:51] God a God that's never left us nor
[2:59:54] forsake
[2:59:56] us but was with us and even in
[3:00:00] us all the way to the
[3:00:03] end but he made this statement that
[3:00:06] moved upon me he said God came so he
[3:00:08] could convey his
[3:00:11] presence to the
[3:00:15] people now the question
[3:00:18] tonight is our we said we want to be
[3:00:21] about the father's business but how can
[3:00:23] we about the father's
[3:00:25] business if we're not in the
[3:00:30] father and that's the challenge
[3:00:36] tonight do you believe that wherever
[3:00:38] that you are now you know whether you're
[3:00:41] walking in his presence or
[3:00:44] not you know that
[3:00:49] this great scripture that our Messenger
[3:00:51] read to
[3:00:53] us he
[3:00:56] said he said when Amos looked out over
[3:00:59] the people he said he looked to a people
[3:01:02] who was called to be blessed of
[3:01:08] God that's
[3:01:12] you he said he knew what God had
[3:01:15] promised to bless
[3:01:20] and what a blessing
[3:01:23] was and how the people act with the
[3:01:30] blessing what a way to judge ourselves
[3:01:33] tonight now if I stand there I would say
[3:01:36] tonight that I'm
[3:01:38] wanting Lord I need more of
[3:01:41] you but there's more of him to
[3:01:45] have and if you're outside of him
[3:01:48] tonight I want to make this invitation
[3:01:51] to
[3:01:52] you if by the preaching of the word of
[3:01:55] God that you know that you're not acting
[3:01:58] the way a people that's blessed should
[3:02:03] act then maybe you just take a moment
[3:02:05] and say father I want to
[3:02:08] walk into your
[3:02:10] presence I want to give my life to you I
[3:02:13] want to give my heart to
[3:02:15] you maybe you've never surrendered your
[3:02:19] life you've always battled to have it
[3:02:22] but you've never just said I'm
[3:02:25] here to have your
[3:02:27] presence come into my
[3:02:30] life and change
[3:02:35] me I feel your spirit move and I'm
[3:02:42] blessed I I believe that you're a God
[3:02:44] that can do all kinds of things but I
[3:02:47] I've never come to that peace that's
[3:02:49] your path is
[3:02:51] understanding I've never come to that
[3:02:53] security that nothing can pluck me out
[3:02:56] of the palm of your hand I've never
[3:02:59] settled the question in my heart
[3:03:02] forever that I'm walking in his
[3:03:10] presence all I can do is offer
[3:03:14] you an opportunity
[3:03:18] [Music]
[3:03:20] that if you really want God to make a
[3:03:22] difference in your
[3:03:24] life and you'd like to come you don't
[3:03:28] have to
[3:03:29] come you can do it wherever you
[3:03:33] are but you know whether or not you've
[3:03:35] been sold
[3:03:40] out you know whether or not you got the
[3:03:43] big screen going you know whether or not
[3:03:45] you got what you're playing the music in
[3:03:47] your car you know all those things and
[3:03:50] you're tired of that
[3:03:53] war you're tired of that
[3:03:58] battle and the same God that parted the
[3:04:01] Red
[3:04:01] Sea is
[3:04:04] here the same God that healed the blind
[3:04:07] man is here the same God that cast out
[3:04:11] the demons and the devil is here that
[3:04:14] same God is here tonight to heal your
[3:04:16] soul
[3:04:21] and I'd be remissed of a
[3:04:24] Christian if I didn't give you the
[3:04:28] opportunity to
[3:04:30] come and say I want my life different I
[3:04:34] want to move up higher I want more of
[3:04:37] the Holy Ghost it's not the doctor am I
[3:04:39] interested it anymore it's the
[3:04:43] relationship that I'm interested in and
[3:04:46] I'm tired of living by alone my
[3:04:50] privilege I have eternal life I've
[3:04:52] always had eternal life but I'm not
[3:04:55] letting that eternal life liveing me I
[3:04:58] need Lord you to do something for me I
[3:05:00] need a I need a
[3:05:03] transformation I need a washing by the
[3:05:06] water of the word of
[3:05:10] God and don't be
[3:05:14] ashamed because if you're ashamed of him
[3:05:21] he'll be ashamed of you Paul said I'm
[3:05:24] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[3:05:26] Christ because it's the power of
[3:05:30] God un
[3:05:34] salvation I think I can do
[3:05:37] better as a
[3:05:41] Christian I think I can live
[3:05:43] cleaner as a believer
[3:05:47] I like I can
[3:05:54] walk daily in his
[3:05:57] presence and I'm living short of that
[3:06:01] you ask
[3:06:02] your own heart the
[3:06:08] question and if you want more of
[3:06:14] him then come ask him
