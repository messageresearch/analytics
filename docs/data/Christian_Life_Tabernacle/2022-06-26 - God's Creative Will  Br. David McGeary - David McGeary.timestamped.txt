[4:09] lord that you meet each need

[4:12] lovers 81
[4:15] this morning and
[4:17] kind of those reading that this week
[4:18] there was just
[4:20] one verse that kind of caught my
[4:22] attention and
[4:24] it's verse 87
[4:25] when it says
[4:28] they at all they had almost consumed me
[4:30] upon earth
[4:32] but i forsook not thy precepts
[4:36] you know what i was thinking as i read
[4:37] that who are they
[4:41] you know i don't know about you but a
[4:42] lot of times i'll read the scriptures
[4:44] and
[4:45] it'll refer to they or them and just
[4:48] kind of breeze right through that making
[4:50] kind of an assumption of who that
[4:53] is
[4:55] but you know we should be placing all
[4:57] things
[4:59] according to the scripture
[5:02] you know every time the word speaks of
[5:03] they
[5:05] we should be able to identify who that
[5:07] is and place it according to the word
[5:11] you know they in this case
[5:13] in verse 85
[5:16] are the proud
[5:19] those who
[5:20] dig pits for me those that set traps for
[5:23] me as will read
[5:25] those who persecute me wrongfully
[5:29] those ones david said almost had
[5:31] consumed me in this earth
[5:34] in this earthly realm
[5:36] i got to thinking about that you know
[5:38] pride means to be lifted up
[5:41] to
[5:42] be exalted
[5:44] the exact opposite motion
[5:47] of what the spirit of god does
[5:50] you know the spirit of god is
[5:52] a totally different attribute it's about
[5:55] humbling
[5:56] it's about submitting
[5:58] not lifting up
[6:00] or becoming exalted
[6:03] you know scripturally pride is anything
[6:06] that exalts itself or lifts itself up
[6:09] above the word of god
[6:11] it says in second corinthians 10 5
[6:15] casting down imaginations and every high
[6:18] thing that exalteth itself
[6:22] against the knowledge of god
[6:25] and bringing into captivity
[6:29] every thought to the obedience of christ
[6:33] and in ephesians 4 1 paul describes
[6:35] himself literally
[6:37] as being a prisoner
[6:39] of the word
[6:42] you know rather but you know rather than
[6:43] being brought into captivity
[6:46] or subject to the word
[6:50] you know the proud are they that exalt
[6:52] themselves
[6:54] their lives
[6:55] their agendas
[6:57] their thoughts
[6:58] what they prefer
[7:00] above the word
[7:04] you know i don't have to submit myself
[7:05] to the word it doesn't apply in this
[7:07] situation it
[7:09] you know it's not equitable
[7:12] you know it doesn't matter it's not for
[7:13] me
[7:14] it's just not fair
[7:17] and so they come up with a better way
[7:19] that spirit of the age
[7:22] you know those
[7:24] voices that culture that pressures us to
[7:27] do something
[7:28] besides or in addition to
[7:32] this stand still until i have thus saith
[7:34] the lord
[7:38] you know we live in a whole culture
[7:40] that's building a social norm
[7:43] a social acceptance
[7:45] to do something but
[7:48] wait on the lord
[7:49] they're enacting laws they're making
[7:51] decisions they're hiring leaders they're
[7:53] building accepted rules of behavior all
[7:57] intended to pressure
[8:00] a people
[8:02] from just waiting on thus saith the lord
[8:05] pride exalting itself against
[8:09] the word
[8:12] you know it uh david describes the
[8:15] assault in verse 83 he says that for i
[8:17] am become like a bottle in the smoke
[8:21] that's a good way to describe the age
[8:22] it's smoky it's hard to see it's hard to
[8:26] get direction it's hard to find your way
[8:29] but the thing about smoke you know a
[8:30] bottle was made of flesh in those days
[8:33] is sooner or later it turns it into
[8:34] jerky
[8:36] becomes hard
[8:38] it becomes
[8:39] bitter it becomes unable to absorb water
[8:43] as we just sang about in the song
[8:47] you know it's as i was reading that you
[8:49] know he says once again in verse 87 they
[8:51] had almost consumed me upon earth but i
[8:54] forsook not thy precepts
[8:57] almost
[8:59] but not quite
[9:01] almost
[9:03] you know i was reminded of something
[9:04] jesus told his disciples matthew 24
[9:07] 22 except those days should be shortened
[9:13] there should be no flesh saved
[9:16] but for the elect's sake those days
[9:19] should be
[9:20] shortened
[9:22] the pressure to do something besides or
[9:25] something
[9:26] except
[9:28] thus saith the lord will get to such a
[9:30] place
[9:31] where the lord will have to shorten the
[9:33] days
[9:36] you know we believe that when the last
[9:38] one is saved we'll all be going home
[9:41] but that will also be the hour of
[9:43] maximum pressure
[9:46] the maximum pressure
[9:48] to do something besides
[9:50] thus saith the lord
[9:53] jesus said also in verse 12 of matthew
[9:56] 24 and because iniquity
[9:58] everyone doing their own way
[10:01] shall
[10:02] abound be everywhere
[10:06] the love of many shall wax cold
[10:10] but he that shall endure
[10:13] to the end
[10:15] he shall be saved
[10:19] as david said in psalm 119 87 they had
[10:22] almost consumed me but i forsook not
[10:28] thy precepts
[10:30] you know none of us can physically
[10:33] cling to the word
[10:35] or discipline ourselves according to the
[10:38] word enough
[10:40] to withstand
[10:41] the pressure
[10:43] no amount of reading no amount of
[10:46] studying no amount of church services or
[10:49] sermons
[10:50] no amount of books or tapes can cause
[10:53] you to withstand the maximum pressure of
[10:56] doing something besides
[10:59] the word
[11:00] or accept the word
[11:03] you know david
[11:04] had the key
[11:07] to what that was
[11:09] and it's in verse 88
[11:12] quicken me
[11:15] after thy loving kindness
[11:17] so shall i keep
[11:20] the testimony of thy mouth
[11:23] that's how i'll withstand the pressure
[11:27] to not do something besides or accept
[11:30] the word
[11:32] you know it doesn't matter how much you
[11:34] study the scriptures
[11:36] it doesn't matter how much you memorize
[11:39] doesn't matter how many church services
[11:41] you go to how many believers you
[11:43] surround yourself with
[11:44] it doesn't even matter how much you
[11:46] press play
[11:48] if that quickening doesn't happen
[11:51] you cannot withstand
[11:53] the pressure
[11:56] only by
[11:58] you know the lord quickens an age
[12:00] and he has
[12:02] he quickens the church
[12:04] and he does
[12:05] but he's got to quicken you
[12:07] he's got to quicken me or you cannot
[12:10] withstand the pressure
[12:12] of the pride
[12:14] only by that can you endure
[12:16] to the end
[12:18] it was interesting that david of all
[12:20] people recognized to this key do you
[12:22] know
[12:23] that he is the only person that ever
[12:25] uses that word quicken in the entire old
[12:27] testament
[12:29] nobody that's not a word old testament
[12:31] people used but david used it all the
[12:33] time in fact almost every single time he
[12:35] used it was in psalm 119
[12:38] recognizing the importance of a personal
[12:42] quickening
[12:43] of the word to withstand the pressure
[12:46] so you know as we read this this morning
[12:50] you know my prayer is quick and thou me
[12:52] according to the word
[12:54] to withstand the pressure of the
[12:56] prideful age that we live in
[12:59] so let's go ahead and read those verses
[13:01] verse 81 to 88 together
[13:04] my soul fainteth for thy salvation but i
[13:08] hope in thy word
[13:09] mine eyes fail for thy word saying when
[13:12] wilt thou comfort me
[13:14] for i am become like a bottle in the
[13:16] smoke yet do i not forget thy statues
[13:19] how many are the days of thy servant
[13:22] when wilt thou execute judgment on them
[13:24] that persecute me the proud have dig
[13:27] pits for me which are not after thy law
[13:30] all thy commandments are faithful they
[13:32] persecute me wrongfully help thou me
[13:36] they had almost consumed me upon earth
[13:38] but i forsook not thy precepts quick in
[13:41] me after thy loving kindness so shall i
[13:44] keep the testimony of thy mouth
[13:52] amen
[13:54] god bless you have your seats
[13:59] come and sing

[22:54] god bless you saint
[22:56] um before i sing my song i would just
[22:58] like to give a short testimony
[23:01] yesterday i turned 25 year old
[23:04] and
[23:07] when i look back at my life and when i
[23:09] look at what god has done for me
[23:12] before i was born my parent lost two
[23:14] children just before me
[23:16] and i was the first to come and
[23:18] just a few weeks after i was born i died
[23:23] and
[23:24] my mom couldn't take it
[23:27] it was very hard on her and
[23:30] she called every pastor she could think
[23:31] of
[23:33] and they came as a baby they tell me the
[23:35] story so i wasn't there
[23:37] and
[23:39] they they called every pastor that could
[23:41] think of
[23:43] and they prayed for several hours then i
[23:45] came back
[23:48] and after that i spent most of my life
[23:51] in the hospital bed
[23:53] in and out of the hospital
[23:56] it started off with just something
[23:58] simple then something else happens then
[24:00] another thing
[24:02] i had a surgery in my head
[24:05] and it was just up and down i had to get
[24:08] special teachers at home
[24:11] to be teaching me
[24:12] so i can be caught up
[24:14] with schoolwork and
[24:19] i had
[24:20] many diseases i can think of
[24:22] i even had
[24:23] a skin condition that i visited
[24:27] almost every dermatologist i know that
[24:29] was really good
[24:30] in the congo i also traveled to uganda
[24:33] and east africa to try to find solution
[24:35] but
[24:36] nothing i came to the u.s even i went to
[24:39] many dermatologists
[24:41] same thing
[24:44] but now i'm standing here
[24:47] about 90 of that is gone
[24:52] and
[24:55] just to think
[24:57] i'm standing
[24:58] now it's about five six years i haven't
[25:00] really been sick
[25:02] i've been healthy i've been happy most
[25:05] of the time
[25:07] and i've been really praising god and
[25:09] if you know me you know that i praise
[25:10] god with so much energy because
[25:13] i know really
[25:14] where i come from i know i wouldn't be
[25:16] here
[25:17] and happening
[25:20] and i
[25:21] found myself keep on praying i say that
[25:24] god if i can just
[25:25] be healthy if i can just be like normal
[25:28] like other kids attend school every time
[25:31] that i would decide to
[25:33] work on something that will help a lot
[25:35] of people millions of people i would try
[25:37] my best to do anything
[25:39] that will help people
[25:41] and i'm standing at 25 year old
[25:44] i'm almost getting my phd
[25:46] and at the same time i'm running an
[25:48] organization that is really helping a
[25:49] lot of people
[25:52] and i just
[25:53] i just thank god and i praise god for
[25:56] for just being alive
[25:58] and i would like to just sing
[26:01] just a few verses to god
[26:04] just to praise him for life to praise
[26:08] him for being here

[39:10] uh this morning
[39:13] a lot of great changes
[39:15] uh going on
[39:18] before we stand and read our scripture
[39:20] this morning
[39:21] you know
[39:25] god's got really great ways of doing
[39:28] things
[39:29] and
[39:31] sometimes you
[39:33] come across things and
[39:35] and you you're going to preach the word
[39:37] of god and god gives you a message to
[39:40] preach and
[39:41] it looks like i can't preach this
[39:44] you know what i mean
[39:46] it's got so many directions in so many
[39:48] ways and
[39:50] and it can be taken so wrong
[39:53] and
[39:55] you just sit there and quiver you know
[39:56] and and you go back and you read it
[39:59] again and you pray about it again
[40:01] and you try to change it up a little
[40:05] you know you want to add some sugar to
[40:07] it
[40:08] add a little spice you know
[40:11] i always love going in the kitchen when
[40:13] leslie's cooking and
[40:15] maybe add a little salt or a little
[40:17] something and taste it and then say it's
[40:19] perfect
[40:20] like i made it
[40:23] you know
[40:24] and she bears with me and
[40:27] she would rather have me do that than
[40:29] cook
[40:30] because i'm a good cook but i don't know
[40:33] how to clean up
[40:35] and so you know when i get done cooking
[40:37] it takes a half hour to clean the stove
[40:40] but
[40:41] so anyway i'm reading this and and i'm
[40:45] i'm reading this part of the sermon
[40:48] and i look and
[40:50] um i said leslie listen to this
[40:54] and she's in bed and she's got her
[40:56] headsets on and
[40:58] i say listen to this and i read a quote
[41:01] to her
[41:02] and she flies up
[41:05] and she says what did you just read
[41:07] i said she said what are you reading
[41:09] from
[41:11] and i said the reproach for the cause of
[41:13] the word she said i'm reading the exact
[41:16] same quote
[41:18] right now
[41:19] and that just kind of let me know the
[41:21] spirit of the lord
[41:22] was there
[41:23] and it just encouraged me
[41:26] to go ahead and preach this morning
[41:30] i hope that everybody can take it in a
[41:32] real positive
[41:34] positive way
[41:36] and
[41:38] that we can
[41:39] look
[41:40] at the things that our messenger
[41:44] spoke to us and i hope it's a blessing
[41:47] to you this morning
[41:49] i prayed all
[41:51] morning and that whatever lord i just
[41:54] want to preach this in the right
[41:56] spirit
[41:58] for the right purpose so
[42:00] i i hope it's a
[42:02] a a blessing to you
[42:05] so let's stand this morning and open our
[42:07] bibles
[42:09] to
[42:13] psalm
[42:15] um
[42:18] 89
[42:23] and we want to start
[42:25] in the 51st verse
[42:28] and uh
[42:32] read this uh
[42:35] the verse of uh scripture
[42:38] found here
[42:40] in in this
[42:43] this
[42:44] psalm
[42:51] and it reads as this remember
[42:54] lord the reproach of thy servant
[43:01] how i do bear
[43:03] in my bosom
[43:05] the reproach
[43:07] of all thy mighty people
[43:12] wherewith thine enemies have reproached
[43:15] oh lord
[43:16] wherewith they have reproached the
[43:19] footsteps of thy anointed
[43:23] blessed be the lord
[43:25] forevermore
[43:27] amen
[43:28] and amen father
[43:30] we ask you to bless your word to us in
[43:32] jesus name we pray amen
[43:35] you may be seated
[43:37] we're going to be
[43:38] reading and taking our thought
[43:41] this morning from the message caused the
[43:43] reproach
[43:45] for the cause
[43:47] of the word
[43:48] the reproach for the cause
[43:51] of the word
[43:53] and
[43:54] and as i read
[43:56] i'm going to read
[43:57] start with paragraph
[44:00] 77
[44:01] and i want you to listen this morning
[44:05] as we read these quotes and understand
[44:09] the first part of what god is making
[44:12] clear to us
[44:14] and our messenger is making clear to us
[44:17] is that god has a plan
[44:20] god has a plan
[44:22] and
[44:23] and
[44:24] he knows what he's doing
[44:26] we read in the message uh
[44:29] the sermon
[44:31] that things that are to be
[44:33] he said everything's pre-planned of god
[44:37] so we rest in that
[44:40] and so as we go through this
[44:42] sermon this morning a little bit it'd be
[44:45] a wonderful sermon for you go back
[44:48] and listen to so i encourage you
[44:51] sometime this week just to take a little
[44:53] moment
[44:54] and listen to this sermon birdman starts
[44:56] us out in paragraph 77
[44:59] he said god has a time
[45:02] and a reason for that time
[45:07] to fulfill
[45:08] to fulfill all his works
[45:12] god knows just exactly what
[45:16] he's going to do
[45:19] we don't
[45:21] we just
[45:24] had to receive it
[45:26] we
[45:27] we just had to receive it
[45:31] as he gives it to us
[45:34] but he knows
[45:36] and there's nothing going to go wrong
[45:39] with what he has planned to do
[45:43] it's all has to come about
[45:47] there has to be sometimes rugged
[45:50] and hard things
[45:52] to only bring out the real true
[45:56] nature of an object
[45:59] so you know he says sometimes rugged and
[46:02] hard things come our way
[46:04] sometimes
[46:07] hard decisions come
[46:09] and there's a reproach
[46:12] that comes with it
[46:14] but it it's what brings out what we
[46:17] really are right
[46:19] you know
[46:20] sometimes your life is is easy
[46:24] and and and and that's what the
[46:27] complaint
[46:28] about job was job
[46:31] everything's a blessing to you
[46:33] everything goes your way you've always
[46:35] had it your way you know everything's
[46:38] worked out for you and
[46:40] and god's got a hedge around you and the
[46:43] enemy came up and said man yeah he said
[46:46] have you considered my servant job what
[46:48] a what a great servant he is oh wouldn't
[46:51] you like god to do that about you
[46:54] uh
[46:56] i i'd have to plead the blood
[47:01] amen i'd have to plead the blood
[47:04] but
[47:05] and he said you built that i had your on
[47:08] job so what happened god said he he
[47:12] began to let job's world fall apart
[47:16] and and what was it to do it was to
[47:18] prove what job really really was the
[47:22] kind of character he really had what
[47:25] really was down on the inside to really
[47:28] prove that he was real yeah
[47:32] and and i think that's the the main
[47:34] thing that's happening now more than
[47:36] ever is god's proving whether or not
[47:39] this church is real
[47:41] everybody can make a claim everybody can
[47:44] make a statement everybody can say this
[47:46] and everybody can do that but he presses
[47:50] you through sometimes such a hard thing
[47:53] this is so because you you almost get to
[47:55] the place you can't bear it
[47:58] and here's job sitting on the ass sheep
[48:01] boiling over with boils itching rubbing
[48:04] his skin and scraping it and his wife
[48:06] says job
[48:08] look at just just curse god and die
[48:11] take the easy way out and she he stands
[48:15] there and said the lord giveth the lord
[48:17] taketh away and blessed be the name of
[48:20] the lord
[48:23] in the face of his comforters everybody
[48:25] trying to figure out his life
[48:29] for him
[48:30] everybody knowing how your life should
[48:32] go which direction your life should be
[48:35] what you should do
[48:37] what you shouldn't do
[48:40] and and they
[48:42] and they just
[48:44] and job went through it
[48:46] and finally he said though the skins
[48:47] won't meet my flesh
[48:50] though i sit here on this heat
[48:53] and i die
[48:54] and the skin worms eat my
[48:56] yet
[48:58] will i see god
[49:00] remember that's the end
[49:03] of all of our lives
[49:06] that's the end no matter what journey
[49:08] you take in this life the end of our
[49:11] lives is we shall see god
[49:15] hallelujah i have a place prepared for
[49:17] you if it was not so i would not tell
[49:20] you i go to prepare that place for you
[49:23] that where i am you may be also
[49:28] so god knows what he's doing
[49:34] but
[49:35] he says
[49:38] he says
[49:39] it's to bring out the real true nature
[49:42] of an object
[49:44] he says it takes the pounding of gold
[49:48] turned
[49:49] over and over
[49:51] back and forth
[49:53] and pounded till all the dross is taken
[49:56] out of it
[49:57] not because it shines
[50:00] iron pyrite
[50:03] what it's known as fool's gold it shines
[50:07] like the real gold
[50:09] anyway so so what's the why do you think
[50:12] that the the trials come
[50:15] why do you think those those though uh
[50:18] uh the things don't seem to go right
[50:21] because that's the only way that god can
[50:24] separate the real from the false
[50:30] and even in our our own lives we we all
[50:33] have parts of us that are not real
[50:39] whether they be our imagination whether
[50:41] it be a personality we try to put on uh
[50:44] whether we try to uh uh cover you know i
[50:48] i know what it's like i i grew up with
[50:51] such an inferiority complex that that
[50:54] you don't understand
[50:57] what miracle it took to have me stand
[51:00] here but to cover that inferiority
[51:03] complex you know i always had to be
[51:05] joking i always had to be in trouble
[51:07] always trying to do things because i was
[51:10] trying to hide the pain
[51:14] on the inside
[51:17] and i knew there was a love inside of me
[51:19] and and
[51:22] and it suffered but you know what it
[51:23] does it separates the the real from the
[51:26] false it separates the phony from the
[51:29] genuine
[51:31] and you know the in that listen to what
[51:33] he says here i think it's beautiful
[51:35] he says
[51:37] it's not because it shines because iron
[51:40] pirate was known as fool go sign just
[51:42] like gold
[51:43] but you put the two together
[51:46] you set them out from one side to
[51:50] another you set them apart you can
[51:52] hardly tell them apart
[51:54] but put them together you can tell it
[51:58] and the beater always has to beat till
[52:01] he sees his own reflection in the goal
[52:05] and i know that's what we're all trying
[52:07] to achieve right is to be more like him
[52:11] well you can't take you can't take in
[52:14] order to be like him he's got to
[52:16] separate everything out of us that's
[52:18] unlike him and sometimes that's painful
[52:22] sometimes you don't understand but what
[52:24] do you got to go back to god knows what
[52:27] he's doing everything's on time
[52:29] everything has a purpose everything has
[52:32] a reason he's in control even when we
[52:35] don't understand
[52:39] and we don't have to understand
[52:43] we got to believe
[52:46] and so we we we see that that that's
[52:50] that's a
[52:52] wonderful thing he says as we
[52:56] we go on to read he says
[52:59] and god
[53:01] and god sets a time
[53:04] and has a purpose
[53:06] for everything that he does
[53:11] there's nothing happening just
[53:13] accidentally
[53:15] to those who love the lord and are
[53:18] called according to his calling
[53:23] you don't have to be afraid
[53:26] if god moves you
[53:28] and and
[53:29] and you feel
[53:31] to do something
[53:33] then don't be afraid it's in god's hands
[53:37] you know what i mean he's in control god
[53:40] will get the outcome that he wants
[53:44] i thank god
[53:45] that he said that in my life i'm not
[53:48] talking about anybody's else's life i'm
[53:50] talking about my life in my life that he
[53:53] promised me that when i take the
[53:55] permissive will he'll work it back to
[53:57] his perfect will
[54:00] never want to forget who's in control
[54:07] and and so he he says that we're reading
[54:10] in paragraph 81. i don't know if they
[54:11] have it posted or not
[54:13] there's nothing happens just
[54:15] accidentally to those who love the lord
[54:19] and are called according to his calling
[54:21] see
[54:22] we are predestinated
[54:24] and everything works just right for that
[54:28] because he cannot lie
[54:31] hallelujah
[54:33] did he put your name on the lamb's book
[54:35] of life that you've got to end and again
[54:39] nothing it ca it won't lie
[54:44] you can sit back and rest on that i know
[54:46] this message is 100
[54:49] absolutely the truth i can rest on that
[54:55] it'll come out just the way he said
[54:58] it'll come out
[55:02] even the critics
[55:04] they'll they can't figure out the cloud
[55:06] they can't figure out the mountain they
[55:08] can't figure out this they can't figure
[55:10] out the bear they can't figure out a lot
[55:12] of things they can't figure out but yet
[55:15] they're blind to every vindicated thing
[55:18] that he said that's happening right now
[55:24] it's going to be just the way he said it
[55:28] and let us read he says
[55:31] we are predestinated everything works
[55:33] out right because he cannot lie
[55:35] and he said
[55:37] that was so
[55:38] that everything has its time
[55:41] its season
[55:43] and it has its way
[55:47] that's the hard part a lot of times
[55:50] for us is the way god does things
[55:55] i think that's what we miss more than
[55:57] anything
[55:59] is the way god does things how he does
[56:02] things why he does it he's got a way for
[56:05] everything he moves
[56:07] everything he does oh
[56:09] for us not to worry about a dying world
[56:13] not to worry about a world we know is
[56:15] going to be destroyed
[56:17] not to worry about a world we know is
[56:19] going to get more and more wicked and
[56:22] more evil but but to set our hearts and
[56:26] know that god's got a will and a plan
[56:29] for his elected and that's where we
[56:31] should turn our hearts
[56:35] you believe that
[56:37] amen i most certainly believe that with
[56:40] all my heart
[56:42] i i don't know what i'd do without them
[56:45] amen
[56:46] and he says so
[56:48] and god is behind every move
[56:52] and sometimes
[56:53] you think that everything is going wrong
[56:59] is any has anybody felt that
[57:03] you know oh this is not going good at
[57:06] all
[57:08] you know
[57:09] there's there's something wrong you know
[57:12] and our messenger told us the sunshiny
[57:15] skies doesn't mean that god's for you
[57:18] is that right
[57:19] neither does the clouds and the storms
[57:22] mean that god's against you
[57:24] you've got to find your place in the
[57:26] word
[57:29] that you've got to be able to read that
[57:32] scripture
[57:33] listen to that word of god that was
[57:36] preached at this hour and put your name
[57:38] in it
[57:41] by his stripes david mcgeary was healed
[57:46] you've got to put your name in the
[57:48] scripture you got to put yourself in the
[57:51] place of the bible character when you
[57:54] read about peter you be peter
[57:57] when you read about john you be john
[58:00] when you read about noah you be noah you
[58:02] be job
[58:04] put yourself in there
[58:06] put yourself in the word of god because
[58:09] they were people just like you are
[58:12] they they ate like you they slept like
[58:15] you they suffered like you they got sick
[58:17] like you but there was something about
[58:19] them that they were committed
[58:22] to the plan of god
[58:25] oh my
[58:27] and and then we think that's everything
[58:28] goes wrong and it's up to us
[58:33] all things aren't going very good
[58:38] you know i i i feel that all the time
[58:42] we don't have a sunday school we don't
[58:44] have parking we don't have seating we
[58:47] don't have oh this lord what am i going
[58:49] to do it's not up to us
[58:54] you know what i mean we think we've got
[58:57] to do something
[58:59] you know
[59:00] it it's
[59:01] and and we we just we think oh i i've
[59:05] got to change the environment i've got
[59:07] to change the circumstance i've got to
[59:10] change the situation but it's not up to
[59:13] us
[59:14] those things are put upon us
[59:18] trials and
[59:20] wonderings
[59:25] you know i always got the trial part
[59:29] but it's the wonderings
[59:31] it's it's the wonderings that leave you
[59:35] helpless
[59:37] it's the what ifs
[59:40] and i always said this i put this this
[59:43] in my heart when i became a very young
[59:47] christian
[59:49] when i first got converted when i had
[59:51] hair down to my shoulders and yes
[59:55] and
[59:56] and i i i put this in my heart and i
[59:59] said
[1:00:00] ands if
[1:00:02] buts and wise
[1:00:04] are all satan's lies
[1:00:10] and and that's what it is and i would
[1:00:12] hear people say god said this but
[1:00:15] and such and such if and such an and you
[1:00:19] know and then why and i threw my hands
[1:00:23] up and said you know what it's just
[1:00:25] exactly what he says
[1:00:30] so hold that as we think of that and
[1:00:33] there's someone else in my heart that i
[1:00:35] put young in my heart
[1:00:38] and i still believe it to this day where
[1:00:41] there's any
[1:00:42] there's plenty
[1:00:46] and and you can walk through life
[1:00:48] with a simple
[1:00:51] heart
[1:00:52] and a simple mind the church don't need
[1:00:55] a whole lot more theology
[1:00:57] the church needs a whole lot more of the
[1:01:00] love of god shed abroad in our heart by
[1:01:03] the holy spirit
[1:01:05] he says and it's the wonderings it's
[1:01:08] it's testing to see how you will react
[1:01:12] on an action
[1:01:15] a lot of things come your way and a lot
[1:01:17] of pressure and a lot of wonderings but
[1:01:20] it's there how are you going to react to
[1:01:22] that that's right yourself because satan
[1:01:25] tries to force you
[1:01:28] into decisions
[1:01:32] desperation causes you to do things you
[1:01:34] normally wouldn't do
[1:01:36] i mean it's human nature it goes for me
[1:01:39] it goes it goes for anybody
[1:01:43] you understand we we wonder we don't
[1:01:46] know what to do we we we throw up our
[1:01:48] hands and and it just say well what's
[1:01:52] our reaction to it how are we going to
[1:01:54] respond
[1:01:57] when something happens you don't
[1:01:59] understand it you wonder about it
[1:02:02] how's your response going to be
[1:02:05] i'll tell you what our response should
[1:02:07] be we should turn the other cheek
[1:02:10] we should go the extra mile
[1:02:13] we should give them the benefit of the
[1:02:15] doubt
[1:02:16] we should
[1:02:17] you know
[1:02:18] uh there's a lot of things it's hard it
[1:02:21] took me lots and lots of years and i'm
[1:02:23] i'm i'm just coming into it but i'm one
[1:02:26] of those guys that i like it done my way
[1:02:29] my way's the best way and i'm not gonna
[1:02:32] send you down the highway because i
[1:02:34] might need you later but
[1:02:36] uh just step back
[1:02:41] you know you don't know how many times
[1:02:43] now in my life that i i'm working on
[1:02:45] something and somebody steps in and
[1:02:48] sticks their hands in it while i'm
[1:02:49] working
[1:02:57] i look at like son
[1:03:00] come on now
[1:03:02] you know
[1:03:03] i know you're smarter and i am i know
[1:03:06] you've got more experience than i do
[1:03:08] i know you've got no more muscle than i
[1:03:10] do
[1:03:12] but don't forget i got a whole lot more
[1:03:14] authority than you do
[1:03:16] so at least let me do it wrong
[1:03:21] you know it's hard to step back say you
[1:03:23] want to do it
[1:03:25] go ahead
[1:03:27] you know
[1:03:28] it'll last a week or two and we'll be
[1:03:30] back to fix it again
[1:03:33] you know it's how you react right right
[1:03:37] you know what i mean how do you respond
[1:03:40] you know i i don't care what anything is
[1:03:43] jesus told us we respond with love
[1:03:47] we respond with respect we respond with
[1:03:50] support that that so that's the way we
[1:03:54] are
[1:03:55] you understand we're i'm not at war
[1:03:58] with anybody
[1:04:00] that's right
[1:04:02] i don't have to be at war
[1:04:05] you see we go back to it's up to us
[1:04:09] no it's not
[1:04:10] lord
[1:04:13] what is it to me
[1:04:16] if he tarries
[1:04:17] till i come
[1:04:19] follow me
[1:04:21] follow me
[1:04:23] that's where most people miss it
[1:04:29] follow him
[1:04:33] so he's looking for a reaction
[1:04:35] he says in paragraph 91
[1:04:38] and i know people uh pity me because i
[1:04:42] i read quotes
[1:04:44] but
[1:04:45] don't worry
[1:04:47] i can preach
[1:04:51] i'm 72 years old and if i want to preach
[1:04:55] there's not a guy standing in this world
[1:04:59] that can preach
[1:05:02] but what good is it
[1:05:03] for you to do to have a show
[1:05:06] let's lay down some real words of the
[1:05:08] prophet of god and let them anchor in
[1:05:11] our heart and let them anchor in our
[1:05:13] soul
[1:05:14] i'll tell you emotions
[1:05:17] they don't last
[1:05:23] i used to be a
[1:05:24] schoolyard brawler
[1:05:26] i love to fight
[1:05:29] i get beat up a lot but i still love to
[1:05:31] fight
[1:05:32] and all the guys i got in fights with
[1:05:34] became my best friend
[1:05:36] because that emotion don't last
[1:05:39] don't let bitterness last
[1:05:41] don't let what other people say to you
[1:05:43] or say about you last
[1:05:47] don't get caught up in that world
[1:05:50] if god leads you to do something you're
[1:05:52] not against where you come from you're
[1:05:54] not against where you're going you're
[1:05:57] not against you follow the word of god
[1:06:02] he says
[1:06:03] now you see i believe all these things
[1:06:06] had a meaning
[1:06:08] what would you do with a power
[1:06:10] how would you
[1:06:12] see
[1:06:13] the reaction of an action
[1:06:16] sometimes that comes as an act
[1:06:19] then how do you react to that action
[1:06:23] do you understand what i mean
[1:06:26] what would you do
[1:06:28] and maybe all of this has worked up to
[1:06:32] where you are at now
[1:06:35] i don't know
[1:06:38] i just can't say
[1:06:41] but there's always been
[1:06:43] some way
[1:06:47] so be careful
[1:06:50] of your reaction
[1:06:53] and remember that
[1:06:55] the reproach of the word
[1:06:58] the word has always bore a reproach all
[1:07:02] through
[1:07:03] the ages
[1:07:05] there's always a reproach
[1:07:07] there's always a criticism
[1:07:10] there's always a negative voice out
[1:07:13] there there there's always a reproach
[1:07:15] but remember
[1:07:17] the the unelect is going to do what an
[1:07:20] elect does
[1:07:24] you know what i mean
[1:07:25] if you can't take a piece of a puzzle
[1:07:29] that used to be a joke we did as kids we
[1:07:32] take a couple pieces up from one box and
[1:07:35] throw them in another box and take a
[1:07:37] couple of pieces of those puzzles and
[1:07:39] throw them in another box you know and
[1:07:41] we'd wait down and they'd get down there
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:44] they'd have these two pieces and they
[1:07:46] couldn't make them fit
[1:07:51] hey get the scissors
[1:07:56] i'm going to make this fit
[1:08:00] you know god's going to get you where
[1:08:02] you fit
[1:08:04] the environment you want to be in the
[1:08:06] atmosphere you want to be in if that's
[1:08:09] what you want that's what you desire
[1:08:11] that's your heart's desire god gives you
[1:08:14] the desire of your heart
[1:08:20] the prophet he saw that eagle in the
[1:08:22] cage
[1:08:24] he thought man
[1:08:26] it tears me up
[1:08:27] he's not made to be there
[1:08:30] let them soar
[1:08:34] let them fly
[1:08:37] let people be where they're happy and uh
[1:08:40] and
[1:08:41] and and they feel god's moving them
[1:08:46] i don't care about that
[1:08:49] but i'm gonna preach to you what i do
[1:08:51] care about
[1:08:55] and it's the real thing
[1:09:04] he says every man that comes to christ
[1:09:09] he says you always have to stand the
[1:09:11] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:09:15] see every man that comes to christ first
[1:09:17] must be child trained
[1:09:19] for the purpose that god has ordained
[1:09:23] for you
[1:09:26] did i skip a paragraph
[1:09:30] yes let me go back and read and remember
[1:09:32] that the reproach
[1:09:34] of the word the word this is 92 the word
[1:09:38] the word has always bore a reproach all
[1:09:42] through the ages god's anointed word has
[1:09:45] always been reproached
[1:09:48] and that's the reason it's so hard for
[1:09:51] people who doesn't understand
[1:09:54] would know
[1:09:56] how to accept
[1:09:58] that reproach
[1:10:01] whoa
[1:10:03] that struck me
[1:10:07] how do we accept
[1:10:09] the reproach all these things are given
[1:10:11] for a reaction
[1:10:13] everything's to bear the reproach and he
[1:10:15] goes on to say you always have to stand
[1:10:19] this
[1:10:19] reproach
[1:10:22] you always got to stand it
[1:10:24] okay
[1:10:27] you've got to stand this reproach in
[1:10:29] order to give your testing
[1:10:32] to see
[1:10:33] every man that comes to christ must
[1:10:35] first be child trained
[1:10:37] for the purpose that god has ordained
[1:10:40] for you
[1:10:41] and remember
[1:10:43] if you can
[1:10:44] just keep quiet
[1:10:51] remember
[1:10:52] if he has called
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:56] and remember if
[1:10:59] if you can just keep quiet remember if
[1:11:02] he has called you
[1:11:04] for this
[1:11:06] there is nothing that can keep it from
[1:11:10] happening there is not enough devils in
[1:11:14] torment but what god's word will be made
[1:11:18] manifest
[1:11:19] you're born for a purpose and nobody can
[1:11:23] take your place
[1:11:25] you might have impersonators
[1:11:28] everything else
[1:11:29] but they'll never take your place right
[1:11:32] god's word will triumph now remember
[1:11:35] what triumphs
[1:11:38] what
[1:11:38] triumphs god's word
[1:11:42] now i'm setting you up
[1:11:51] will triumph it cannot fail now they
[1:11:54] feel sorry for us
[1:11:59] oh
[1:12:00] i feel so sorry for you
[1:12:04] because the spirit's not moving
[1:12:08] you're not shouting
[1:12:13] you're not jumping out
[1:12:16] your your song specials aren't a concert
[1:12:21] oh i feel so sorry for you
[1:12:26] you're dead
[1:12:29] you're misguided
[1:12:31] you're misdirected
[1:12:34] they feel sorry for you
[1:12:39] they felt sorry for noah
[1:12:42] until the creative will of god
[1:12:45] came
[1:12:47] now follow me through this morning if
[1:12:50] you would and i'll try to do my best but
[1:12:53] he said no they feel sorry for us
[1:12:56] they feel sorry for anybody that tries
[1:12:59] to hold to
[1:13:01] the
[1:13:02] word
[1:13:04] they feel sorry for you if you try to
[1:13:06] hold to what the messenger said they
[1:13:08] feel sorry for you if you only take what
[1:13:11] he said if you only believe what he said
[1:13:13] that you only trust what's on the tape
[1:13:15] they feel sorry for you
[1:13:17] you don't have the spirit
[1:13:24] they do
[1:13:26] they feel sorry for you they actually
[1:13:27] have pity for you
[1:13:30] oh i just don't know how you can work on
[1:13:32] that big old chunk of wood
[1:13:37] when god's doing all these great other
[1:13:39] other things
[1:13:41] oh they try to
[1:13:42] they they they try to say what are you
[1:13:45] doing why are you laboring in that why
[1:13:47] are you holding to that
[1:13:49] why are you sticking
[1:13:51] just with what he said
[1:13:53] why do you play tapes don't feel sorry
[1:13:56] for me because i play tapes
[1:13:59] hallelujah one day you'll realize that's
[1:14:01] what's kept you
[1:14:03] that's what's kept the spirits away that
[1:14:06] because the word correct
[1:14:08] corrects the air
[1:14:11] it's doing more for you than just
[1:14:14] hearing it
[1:14:15] satan don't like to be around that
[1:14:17] atmosphere satan don't like to be where
[1:14:20] that voice is satan don't like to be
[1:14:23] exposed
[1:14:28] that's why they don't play them
[1:14:33] because it exposed
[1:14:35] what's really going on
[1:14:37] not the facade
[1:14:39] not the front
[1:14:42] what was really going on is it was
[1:14:44] fixing to flood
[1:14:50] their life and their direction
[1:14:52] was total disaster
[1:14:56] and noah stayed with the word and he
[1:14:59] built the ark and they were feeling
[1:15:01] sorry for him
[1:15:02] oh we feel so sorry for anybody that
[1:15:05] tries to hold the word in the days of
[1:15:07] the scoffers
[1:15:09] but remember
[1:15:11] the reproach must come
[1:15:14] it's always been that way
[1:15:16] they must have thought
[1:15:19] as they did then let me finish the
[1:15:21] statement see if it's not god
[1:15:25] then it's something that man can achieve
[1:15:29] so they felt sorry for noah because noah
[1:15:32] was looking to a god that had a creative
[1:15:36] will
[1:15:37] god's will is a creative will it's not
[1:15:41] manipulating the world it's not
[1:15:43] manipulating the situations it's not
[1:15:46] conforming according to science what
[1:15:48] god's going to do he's going to create
[1:15:51] because spoken word is the original seed
[1:15:55] god's will is a creative will.
[1:16:00] are you staying with me
[1:16:06] he says
[1:16:09] what would we be able
[1:16:12] and willing to stand the reproach
[1:16:15] that went with the truth
[1:16:20] that was the reproach
[1:16:24] was staying with the truth
[1:16:28] with the creative will of god now bear
[1:16:31] with me
[1:16:32] i'm coming to something and i hope that
[1:16:35] you you said it let's take abraham
[1:16:44] now they are they're thinking poor noah
[1:16:48] poor noah these poor people
[1:16:52] they're just not with it
[1:16:56] you know the spirit's not moving
[1:17:01] you know
[1:17:04] they're
[1:17:05] they're dead
[1:17:10] we remember lazarus was dead
[1:17:14] until the creative will of god
[1:17:17] came along so abraham
[1:17:20] he said
[1:17:22] and he said now god god gave give him a
[1:17:25] very odd thing
[1:17:28] you're going to have and how could you
[1:17:31] imagine
[1:17:32] of abraham going out amongst his
[1:17:34] associates and saying we're going to
[1:17:37] what happens
[1:17:39] abraham believed it
[1:17:41] right
[1:17:43] believe that word
[1:17:47] believe that word was going to come to
[1:17:49] pass
[1:17:50] but you know what was the difference
[1:17:53] see
[1:17:54] it it it
[1:17:56] it was a reproach but abraham held to it
[1:18:00] and when he was a hundred years old he
[1:18:03] never staggered at the promise of god he
[1:18:06] still stood that reproach sure and
[1:18:09] holding on to it
[1:18:13] you you see that
[1:18:15] but notice the difference in there
[1:18:18] sarah tried to give abraham or god a
[1:18:22] little bit of help by herself that's the
[1:18:26] difference
[1:18:31] abraham said god's
[1:18:34] me and sarah can have a baby
[1:18:38] but the reproach of that was too too
[1:18:40] much
[1:18:42] they couldn't wait for the revival
[1:18:49] so they had to give god some help
[1:18:52] didn't they
[1:18:53] okay and and so that that's what she did
[1:18:56] she went out and she
[1:18:58] she tried to to give god
[1:19:01] some help
[1:19:02] if he she just you know it was just too
[1:19:05] much to believe she said okay i'm going
[1:19:08] to help god bring this
[1:19:11] promise to pass
[1:19:15] i'm going to go get hagar
[1:19:20] and oh i'm going to make it i'm going to
[1:19:22] have the baby on her knee and she's
[1:19:24] going to take it and
[1:19:26] and a a great big a great big program
[1:19:32] a great a great big thing now watch what
[1:19:35] you and and don't miss this watch this
[1:19:38] is a warning go back and read this
[1:19:40] message yourself and listen to it
[1:19:42] yourself
[1:19:44] it was a warning of what's taking place
[1:19:47] today
[1:19:49] i will stand on god's word
[1:19:58] and
[1:19:59] and she was a beautiful girl and
[1:20:02] a great and she's my maid and and she'll
[1:20:04] bring the promise see you see we always
[1:20:07] try to do something we can't wait
[1:20:11] for
[1:20:12] him
[1:20:14] we got to do something ourselves
[1:20:17] might have been all right
[1:20:19] she might have been pretty
[1:20:22] and it might have looked very good but
[1:20:25] it wasn't according to the word
[1:20:27] god told abraham the baby was going to
[1:20:30] come from sarah
[1:20:33] this revival is going to come from the
[1:20:37] word
[1:20:41] now listen
[1:20:44] listen close right here
[1:20:47] please listen to me
[1:20:57] see we always try to do something we
[1:20:59] can't wait for him we've got to do
[1:21:01] something ourselves might be all right
[1:21:03] she might have been pretty it might have
[1:21:05] looked good but it wasn't according to
[1:21:07] the word god told abraham the baby would
[1:21:09] come from sarah remember
[1:21:12] he said about the flock these signs
[1:21:15] shall follow them that believe
[1:21:19] to help that don't try to manufacture it
[1:21:24] that's the trouble what we've got today
[1:21:27] in this message is we have a
[1:21:29] manufactured
[1:21:31] revival
[1:21:39] because it's god's word
[1:21:42] and he's laying it right out to us
[1:21:45] as plain as can be
[1:21:49] and it's it's it it's it's got a magnet
[1:21:52] to it
[1:21:54] especially if you've got gifts
[1:22:02] remember he said
[1:22:04] about the little flock these signs shall
[1:22:06] follow them that believe
[1:22:08] and as it was in the days of noah so
[1:22:10] what being the coming of the son of man
[1:22:13] wherein a few even eight souls were
[1:22:15] saved those words can't fail
[1:22:18] so let's watch ourselves closely and
[1:22:21] stay with the word all right now listen
[1:22:24] to this
[1:22:25] see the people are always trying to
[1:22:28] manufacture something
[1:22:30] to take the place of god's creative will
[1:22:43] there's going to be a revival
[1:22:48] these signs are going to follow them
[1:22:51] that believe
[1:22:52] but god's going to create the revival
[1:22:57] it's not going to be a man made
[1:23:00] manufactured revival
[1:23:04] it's going to be created
[1:23:06] by the promised word of god it's not
[1:23:09] going to be a manufactured revival
[1:23:12] it'll take place by the creative word of
[1:23:15] god they don't want to wait
[1:23:17] on the creative
[1:23:19] will of god
[1:23:22] like a
[1:23:23] sheep
[1:23:26] does a sheep manufacture will
[1:23:29] no it bears wool
[1:23:32] why does it bear wool
[1:23:34] because of what it is
[1:23:37] because it's a sheep but it doesn't you
[1:23:40] can't make that sheep bare wool before
[1:23:42] it's time
[1:23:44] you can't feed it a little extra music
[1:23:46] you can't feed it a little extra boom
[1:23:49] boom you can't feel a little extra
[1:23:51] excitement
[1:23:53] that sheep will bear wall according to
[1:23:55] god's word and god's time god will
[1:23:59] manufacture the revival
[1:24:05] and it won't be manufactured
[1:24:07] it'll be created
[1:24:10] it bears it according to god's time
[1:24:21] he don't manufacture
[1:24:24] hey listen
[1:24:26] we're not supposed to manufacture the
[1:24:28] fruits of the spirit
[1:24:33] we're not supposed to manufacture the
[1:24:35] works of the spirit
[1:24:38] there's no hurry
[1:24:41] everything's moving towards god's plan
[1:24:49] we're not supposed to manufacture the
[1:24:50] fruits of the spirit we're supposed to
[1:24:52] bear the fruits of the spirit
[1:24:54] apple trees don't manufacture apples it
[1:24:57] just bears apple because it's an apple
[1:25:00] the revival
[1:25:02] will come because we're believers
[1:25:07] the revival will be created by god's
[1:25:10] creative will
[1:25:11] in his time because we are the elect
[1:25:15] lady
[1:25:17] it it it doesn't need any
[1:25:24] help and if we try to manufacture
[1:25:27] anything
[1:25:30] it'll help the cause
[1:25:36] we need to keep this thing going
[1:25:38] we need to get these signs and wonders
[1:25:40] into the church
[1:25:41] we need to have the spirit moving we
[1:25:44] need to be anointing boy we we really
[1:25:46] need to get we need to get we need to
[1:25:49] get the
[1:25:51] the thing the thing happening here you
[1:25:54] know what i mean a god by predestination
[1:25:57] calls who he will
[1:25:59] he gives the kingdom to every
[1:26:02] who he desires to give it to we learn
[1:26:05] that by nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:08] how many knows the story of
[1:26:09] nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:11] you want to go back and read some
[1:26:13] tremendous portions of scriptures you go
[1:26:16] back and read jeremiah
[1:26:18] the
[1:26:19] the
[1:26:20] 27th and
[1:26:23] to the 28th chapter
[1:26:27] god moves on jeremiah
[1:26:29] how many knows the story
[1:26:31] well i'm going to tell it
[1:26:34] because i like it
[1:26:36] god tells jeremiah
[1:26:38] go tell the king of israel
[1:26:41] of the king of judea go tell him you are
[1:26:44] going to come captive to nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:48] you're going to be brought into
[1:26:49] captivity
[1:26:52] now don't resist it
[1:26:58] so he's telling him
[1:27:00] don't stand against it don't fight
[1:27:02] against it
[1:27:03] kill your lands
[1:27:06] marry your daughters
[1:27:08] marry your sons
[1:27:10] have your children and increase
[1:27:14] do not fight
[1:27:16] against
[1:27:20] nebuchadnezzar
[1:27:21] because god has given it
[1:27:24] into his hands
[1:27:28] jeremiah gets this big wooden oak on
[1:27:30] yoke
[1:27:31] and goes in there
[1:27:34] and tells them
[1:27:36] now he tells the prophecy
[1:27:38] and then this is what he says
[1:27:40] in the verse 27 9 therefore hearken not
[1:27:45] ye to your prophets
[1:27:47] nor to your diviners or nor your
[1:27:51] dreamers or nor to you in
[1:27:54] enchanters
[1:27:56] nor to your saucers which speak unto you
[1:28:00] saying ye shall not serve the king of
[1:28:04] babylon
[1:28:08] don't listen to them
[1:28:14] don't listen to him
[1:28:19] that's what he said
[1:28:21] he said for they prophesy a lie unto you
[1:28:25] to remove you far from your land
[1:28:29] that i should drive you out and you
[1:28:32] should perish
[1:28:36] that's what he told them
[1:28:39] i mean my goodness this guy comes in
[1:28:43] and and and
[1:28:45] he he stands up
[1:28:48] and
[1:28:49] he preaches it see god don't need help
[1:28:55] god don't need help
[1:28:58] and so you know the stair to the story
[1:29:00] jeremiah comes there and and
[1:29:03] he comes with the yoke and then hananiah
[1:29:06] comes up
[1:29:11] and he begins to prophesy
[1:29:14] oh thus saith the lord jeremiah says
[1:29:17] don't listen
[1:29:20] don't listen to the revival talk
[1:29:23] don't listen to the ton speaking and the
[1:29:25] prophesying and the divining again all
[1:29:29] this thing don't listen to it it's going
[1:29:31] to be exactly the way god said it don't
[1:29:34] worry about a revival god's going to
[1:29:37] create the revival
[1:29:41] it's his creative will god don't need
[1:29:44] the help
[1:29:46] of music
[1:29:50] he don't need the help of emotions
[1:29:53] he don't need the help of powerful
[1:29:54] energetic preachers
[1:29:57] he don't need comparison
[1:29:59] and he don't need duplication
[1:30:04] he don't need us to duplicate what
[1:30:06] happened in 1906
[1:30:12] he don't need to duplicate people
[1:30:14] standing up prophesying and speaking in
[1:30:16] tongues oh i like it when i know i'm
[1:30:18] standing on god's word
[1:30:22] i like it when you know
[1:30:25] and you're sitting here knowing
[1:30:27] in your heart
[1:30:29] by the word of god that there's a
[1:30:32] revival coming but it's going to be by
[1:30:34] god's creative will
[1:30:40] it's not going to be a man-made created
[1:30:42] revival
[1:30:47] not going to be worked up
[1:30:50] every time
[1:30:54] i've been in this basket since 70.
[1:30:59] i've seen movements come by the
[1:31:01] truckload
[1:31:03] and it's not long till some man rises to
[1:31:07] the forefront
[1:31:11] and he becomes the adjoining voice
[1:31:15] to the prophet
[1:31:19] i'll tell you what he meant
[1:31:21] i'll tell you what he said
[1:31:24] i'll tell you what he's getting to
[1:31:28] don't
[1:31:30] listen
[1:31:34] there's a revival coming
[1:31:36] these signs shall follow them that
[1:31:38] believe
[1:31:41] and you can't manufacture it
[1:31:46] you might see some things
[1:31:48] but they don't last
[1:31:51] but when god
[1:31:53] does it
[1:31:54] it'll be perfect
[1:32:01] he said so
[1:32:04] hananiah comes up and he he he takes it
[1:32:07] and he breaks the yolk
[1:32:10] and they were wondering what were gonna
[1:32:12] happen to the vessels he said well we'll
[1:32:14] be back in two years
[1:32:16] with all the vessels of the tabernacle
[1:32:21] right out in front of everybody
[1:32:26] we've got a revival going on
[1:32:31] we're going to join this revival
[1:32:33] what ain't the one god's going to create
[1:32:39] because there's i'm going to get to it
[1:32:41] there's a reproach that's got to come
[1:32:43] first
[1:32:50] let's join this revival
[1:32:52] it ain't a revival
[1:32:57] hanan broke the yoke
[1:33:00] and said we'll be back in two years
[1:33:03] jeremiah comes back with the yoke of
[1:33:05] iron
[1:33:09] and says now you broke the yoke i told
[1:33:11] you not to fight now it's going to be
[1:33:13] worse than it was before
[1:33:16] and he stands up and says god will break
[1:33:19] the yolk of iron
[1:33:20] this is going to be god's moving and
[1:33:23] we're going to go take the land and
[1:33:25] we've got a revival going on it's not
[1:33:28] the one god created it's not the one
[1:33:30] that god will create because these signs
[1:33:33] and wonders shall follow the bride there
[1:33:35] is a revival coming there is a great
[1:33:38] revival move that's going to take place
[1:33:41] when we get in the perfect will of god
[1:33:45] according to his word and we're doing it
[1:33:48] for a purpose
[1:33:51] these signs are not to be performed on
[1:33:54] us they're to be performed by us
[1:34:02] so here he comes
[1:34:06] he says then then
[1:34:08] then hananiah came up and grabbed the
[1:34:10] yoke off of jeremiah's neck but for all
[1:34:13] the priests and all the congregation
[1:34:16] maybe millions
[1:34:17] and a half people and took that yoke
[1:34:20] that god put upon jeremiah's neck for a
[1:34:22] sign and broke it to pieces and threw it
[1:34:26] at his feet
[1:34:27] just enthused and said thus saith the
[1:34:30] lord in two years they'll be back
[1:34:34] talking about the vessels
[1:34:38] jeremiah just looked at him
[1:34:40] it was contrary to the word so he just
[1:34:43] walked away
[1:34:45] god said go back
[1:34:47] and tell him i never spoke to him
[1:34:55] it was just enthused
[1:35:00] he took his own impressionc
[1:35:03] he never waited till actually he saw it
[1:35:07] and knew it wasn't him
[1:35:09] that it was god saying it
[1:35:12] he went back
[1:35:13] all enthused
[1:35:18] enthusiasm
[1:35:23] if it's god it's going to be according
[1:35:25] to what
[1:35:27] and what is the word for our day
[1:35:33] you have this bible
[1:35:37] but if you read this bible you'll build
[1:35:39] a boat
[1:35:44] if you read this bible you'll wait in an
[1:35:46] upper room until you speak in tongues
[1:35:50] if you read this bible you'll try to
[1:35:52] restore the gifts
[1:35:57] you'll come up with all kinds of stuff
[1:35:59] reading this bible
[1:36:00] you don't think so how many different
[1:36:02] denominations are you
[1:36:05] but there was one that came
[1:36:10] that had the mind of god
[1:36:15] and he said i
[1:36:17] will create
[1:36:20] i have a creative will
[1:36:25] think of it
[1:36:26] a creative will god's will is creative
[1:36:31] he doesn't rely on any help he doesn't
[1:36:34] need anything else he he doesn't need to
[1:36:37] duplicate a revival on past people are
[1:36:40] looking back at something that happened
[1:36:42] in the past they're trying to get the
[1:36:44] same things going the same things
[1:36:47] working the same singers anointing and
[1:36:50] everything that's all great
[1:36:52] have at it
[1:36:54] but hear me in the name of the lord
[1:36:57] god has a creative will
[1:37:01] and god will create
[1:37:04] the revival it's something she has never
[1:37:08] seen
[1:37:09] before
[1:37:13] it's going to be so good
[1:37:16] it's going to be so real
[1:37:18] it's going to be so you and him
[1:37:21] it's an invisible union
[1:37:23] between the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:37:26] earthly bride producing spiritual sons
[1:37:30] and daughters of god
[1:37:38] you know he just it's all enthused
[1:37:41] we find it across the country today
[1:37:45] one of our tapes was being played
[1:37:48] recently in a home
[1:37:50] where a group of ministers was right
[1:37:53] then
[1:37:56] played it recently in the home where a
[1:37:58] group group of ministers was
[1:38:00] right then convicted
[1:38:02] and was coming to be baptized in the
[1:38:05] name
[1:38:06] of jesus christ
[1:38:10] and a man rose up in the room
[1:38:13] and spoke in tongues
[1:38:15] and said thus saith the lord
[1:38:18] hold on to what you got
[1:38:20] just keep on going
[1:38:22] and
[1:38:24] and i'll bless you
[1:38:27] they said well
[1:38:29] if the lord said that i guess it's
[1:38:31] that's it
[1:38:33] you see
[1:38:34] it isn't examined
[1:38:36] with the word
[1:38:38] it's got to take the word
[1:38:41] first
[1:38:42] there you are it was contrary
[1:38:46] to
[1:38:47] the word
[1:38:49] god made a promise
[1:38:52] that he would bless
[1:38:53] but then blessings are under conditions
[1:38:57] and you've got to meet those conditions
[1:39:00] to make that work
[1:39:06] now this that's the part
[1:39:09] let's just close
[1:39:11] now we find out here
[1:39:13] that these people were trying
[1:39:16] to help manufacture something
[1:39:19] hagar and saying sarah to help abraham
[1:39:22] help god to make his promise come true
[1:39:26] you can't do that
[1:39:28] there's no way at all
[1:39:30] of doing it it's against everything
[1:39:33] god's word
[1:39:35] it's it's a it's a
[1:39:37] it's against everything
[1:39:41] god's word is going to happen anyhow
[1:39:46] you've just got to stand right on the
[1:39:49] word and say
[1:39:51] it's this way
[1:39:53] and keep the word now watch to
[1:39:57] manufacture something to take the place
[1:40:00] of
[1:40:02] his
[1:40:03] word
[1:40:04] that's why the first thing you find
[1:40:07] they separate themselves from the
[1:40:08] messenger
[1:40:15] every move i've seen
[1:40:17] they always separate themselves from the
[1:40:20] messenger they rise up equal to
[1:40:25] oh we've had the message for 60 some
[1:40:27] years we know what's in there
[1:40:29] now we're waiting for the spirit to move
[1:40:33] he's not going to move outside his will
[1:40:37] and his word said
[1:40:39] that
[1:40:40] he does it
[1:40:41] with his creative will
[1:40:45] how are you going to measure it
[1:40:48] how are you going to measure whether
[1:40:49] you're having a revival you know what
[1:40:51] they measure it by the revival's gone by
[1:40:58] everybody's wanting pentecost back
[1:41:02] we're not even living in a pentecostal
[1:41:04] age
[1:41:06] we're living in a bright age
[1:41:10] what's going to be manifested in you is
[1:41:12] going to be created by the will of god
[1:41:19] but you've got your part
[1:41:27] it's it
[1:41:29] you know
[1:41:31] it's a reproach
[1:41:33] he says but and and you've got to bear
[1:41:36] the approach see everything's got its
[1:41:38] time
[1:41:40] and its purpose
[1:41:42] and its place so you must find out what
[1:41:46] god has promised
[1:41:51] you can say these signs shall follow
[1:41:53] them that believe and then go out and
[1:41:55] try to produce it
[1:41:58] try to preach an atmosphere
[1:42:02] try to sing an atmosphere
[1:42:07] like i told you before if you got up and
[1:42:08] screamed around around the church it
[1:42:10] wouldn't mean nothing to me because
[1:42:12] you're a believer
[1:42:13] big deal
[1:42:16] but when you get that guy on the street
[1:42:18] screaming
[1:42:20] because he's just had his sins forgiven
[1:42:23] and he's just been
[1:42:24] he's just been delivered from a demon
[1:42:27] and he stands up with tears running down
[1:42:29] his face with his hands in the air
[1:42:31] saying praise god praise god that's the
[1:42:36] god i know
[1:42:40] but they don't want that reproach
[1:42:45] oh i'd like to give that is that brother
[1:42:47] here
[1:42:49] anyway
[1:42:53] matt thomas that i'm going to give you a
[1:42:55] testimony is that all right
[1:42:56] i know you can do it better if i mess it
[1:42:58] up forget it it's the way i said it
[1:43:03] matt thomas
[1:43:04] he's with miles and they just kind of
[1:43:07] feel led to go by the park
[1:43:10] so they go by the park they're riding
[1:43:11] their bikes looking apart and there's
[1:43:12] the swings and the merry grounds and
[1:43:14] everything mounts and i'm going to go
[1:43:15] over and
[1:43:16] hang out you know do 200 push
[1:43:19] pull-ups on the
[1:43:20] the bar there and and
[1:43:23] i'm i'm gonna run about five laps on the
[1:43:24] merry-go-round and
[1:43:26] and uh so
[1:43:28] uh that might be a little enhanced but
[1:43:31] it's uh
[1:43:33] and so there's a there's a there's a man
[1:43:35] sitting there in the park and
[1:43:39] you know
[1:43:40] matt has got down and prayed through
[1:43:42] with the lord
[1:43:44] and he's got some commitments
[1:43:46] in his heart
[1:43:47] about witnessing and testifying
[1:43:50] so the spirit moves on and he goes over
[1:43:52] and talks to this guy
[1:43:54] and he says how you doing and
[1:43:56] and everything and and the guy got a
[1:43:59] real heavy accent he says well i speak
[1:44:01] french
[1:44:03] oh and matt goes oh good he says where
[1:44:05] do you go to church
[1:44:07] and they talk a little bit and matt goes
[1:44:09] away a little bit and mouth and then
[1:44:10] matt feels drawn to come back and he
[1:44:13] comes back to the guy and he says hey he
[1:44:14] says go on everything
[1:44:16] he says where do you go to church
[1:44:19] and the guy bows his head
[1:44:21] and says
[1:44:23] have you ever heard of william marion
[1:44:25] branham
[1:44:30] and that says
[1:44:33] i believe william marion brahms the
[1:44:35] prophet of god and i believe his message
[1:44:37] for the hour
[1:44:40] and that guy
[1:44:41] throws back
[1:44:43] and his eyes get this big
[1:44:46] and he says what he says is there a
[1:44:49] church here
[1:44:53] here's a son of god
[1:44:56] and god leads his son
[1:44:58] to his son
[1:45:00] because this guy's starving for
[1:45:02] fellowship
[1:45:05] oh
[1:45:06] that's beautiful
[1:45:08] those things don't need help
[1:45:12] but you got to know what god's promise
[1:45:14] is
[1:45:15] abraham standing on the word of god it
[1:45:18] finally was fulfilled
[1:45:20] is that right
[1:45:21] but listen now
[1:45:23] listen as i say this so we understand
[1:45:26] the enthusiasm
[1:45:28] right we don't want to be caught away
[1:45:29] with the enthusiasm we don't want to
[1:45:32] manufacture something that takes the
[1:45:35] place
[1:45:36] of god's word
[1:45:38] we understand that right do you
[1:45:40] understand that i don't care what it
[1:45:42] moves like
[1:45:44] until you know the promise
[1:45:47] and until you understand this revival
[1:45:51] will be created
[1:45:55] not manufactured
[1:45:57] so don't feel bad about yourself
[1:46:02] because there's a step
[1:46:07] there's a step
[1:46:10] to be for and this is the step we miss
[1:46:17] abrahad stood on the word of god and it
[1:46:19] was finally fulfilled oh my
[1:46:22] watch the scoffers of barrenness
[1:46:26] being scoffed
[1:46:28] and the reproach of barrenness first
[1:46:34] what comes first
[1:46:36] barrenness
[1:46:42] what do they scoff you for and mock you
[1:46:44] for they think you're barren
[1:46:49] we're not barren we're waiting for the
[1:46:51] divine creation of god's will
[1:46:55] but that's the reproach
[1:46:59] barrenness
[1:47:03] that's what had to come first
[1:47:06] he said
[1:47:07] she had to stand the reproach of being
[1:47:10] barren for all those years
[1:47:12] she was nearly a hundred years old she
[1:47:15] was 90 with the word of god this ted she
[1:47:19] would
[1:47:20] also be a princess
[1:47:22] a mother of this child she had abraham
[1:47:25] barron
[1:47:27] both of their bodies as well as dead but
[1:47:30] yet they never doubted the word one bit
[1:47:33] but they had to stand that first
[1:47:40] and then hallelujah
[1:47:42] god kept his word in the dark hour
[1:47:46] isaac was born
[1:47:48] and his seed is like the sands of the
[1:47:50] seas and the stars of heaven see god
[1:47:53] always answers his word yes
[1:47:56] baroness first
[1:47:58] then isaac
[1:48:04] it's the barrenness that's the reproach
[1:48:10] it's the waiting
[1:48:12] for the creative will of god that's the
[1:48:15] reproach
[1:48:17] that's what you get mocked for that's
[1:48:19] what you get scoffed for that's what the
[1:48:21] point the finger for that's why they
[1:48:24] call you ice cube preachers and that's
[1:48:26] why they say you have no life because
[1:48:28] you have to go through the reproach of
[1:48:32] being barren
[1:48:33] then isaac
[1:48:37] amen if you try to manufacture it
[1:48:40] if you try to go around it
[1:48:46] you'll come up with something
[1:48:48] that's man-made
[1:48:51] and everything that man makes
[1:48:54] dies
[1:48:59] the thunders died off
[1:49:04] white horse rider died off
[1:49:07] two souls died off
[1:49:11] how we could just keep on going
[1:49:13] man-made revivals always die off
[1:49:19] they don't last
[1:49:21] heaven and earth will pass away
[1:49:23] but my word will not pass away
[1:49:26] church
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:29] be able to bear the reproach
[1:49:34] don't be ashamed
[1:49:38] if you go somewhere and they talk to you
[1:49:40] and they talked about their revival
[1:49:42] that's fine praise god i'm happy for you
[1:49:46] you know what jeremiah did
[1:49:49] how many knows what jeremiah said
[1:49:52] it's it's beautiful
[1:49:54] and it just says this
[1:49:56] he he says he said
[1:49:59] uh so haman prophesies
[1:50:01] and there was uh
[1:50:04] and
[1:50:05] and jeremiah says
[1:50:07] to haman oh may it be so
[1:50:12] may it happen just according to you say
[1:50:14] it
[1:50:16] may you be blessed may it happen
[1:50:22] he said but just remember what i said
[1:50:27] he says a prophet is only known
[1:50:30] when his prophecy
[1:50:32] comes to pass
[1:50:36] this is a warning
[1:50:39] from our messenger
[1:50:42] to his bride
[1:50:45] that they're going to try to manufacture
[1:50:47] and work something
[1:50:49] but you wait
[1:50:53] you know who you are
[1:50:54] it's an individual affair
[1:50:58] when someone tells you i just feel that
[1:51:00] i'm complacent and i just feel that i
[1:51:04] i'm not excited i don't feel like i'm
[1:51:06] moving for god
[1:51:08] yeah you know how you
[1:51:10] you
[1:51:12] keep reading your bible
[1:51:15] keep praying
[1:51:17] keep having
[1:51:19] devotions
[1:51:21] you let your daily devotions go you let
[1:51:23] your daily prayer go you let your thing
[1:51:26] go you'll be like a cactus
[1:51:29] well you give a cactus water and those
[1:51:31] needles unfold
[1:51:36] you stay in god
[1:51:39] you know what the promise is
[1:51:43] but you can't manufacture it
[1:51:48] it's going to happen
[1:51:51] but it's going to be created
[1:51:53] and first he said first barrenness
[1:51:58] first going through the dry place
[1:52:01] first going through the wonderings first
[1:52:04] going through the criticism because
[1:52:06] you'll never stand in the hall of fame
[1:52:08] until you stand in the hall of critics
[1:52:12] and that's what david said oh i bear the
[1:52:14] reproach
[1:52:17] of the mighty people of god
[1:52:21] i'll bear the reproach because my
[1:52:23] enemies
[1:52:29] they don't have nothing going on
[1:52:35] huh
[1:52:37] i know what i got going on
[1:52:39] i got waiting going on
[1:52:44] i'm waiting
[1:52:47] because i got the promise of god
[1:52:49] that he will create a revival
[1:52:55] the reproach of barrenness
[1:52:58] i thought lord that's where we are
[1:53:02] that's what they think
[1:53:05] that's what they point
[1:53:07] they look at us in the message
[1:53:09] and they think what a barren group
[1:53:13] they got all kinds of stuff going on out
[1:53:15] there
[1:53:16] shows music shows concerts
[1:53:19] you know
[1:53:20] gymnasiums game rooms playrooms and
[1:53:23] everything
[1:53:27] what we're waiting for
[1:53:29] we cannot
[1:53:30] create
[1:53:32] you understand that
[1:53:35] do what you do but don't put your trust
[1:53:37] in it
[1:53:38] waiting for the creative
[1:53:40] will of god
[1:53:43] waiting is the reproach
[1:53:47] when he creates it
[1:53:49] it'll be perfect
[1:53:53] it will be his will
[1:53:56] it will be his time
[1:53:59] and it will be for a purpose
[1:54:05] now that's my question this morning
[1:54:17] go read it yourself
[1:54:22] man always tries to manufacture
[1:54:25] something
[1:54:27] and get ahead of god
[1:54:29] they're always trying to take the place
[1:54:33] of god's creative will
[1:54:36] but remember
[1:54:38] that's what makes him god
[1:54:43] because he's a creator
[1:54:46] he'll create
[1:54:48] the
[1:54:48] answer
[1:54:50] to your problem
[1:54:52] he'll create your deliverance he'll
[1:54:55] create your healing
[1:54:58] look to the creative will of god the
[1:55:01] prophet of god said do everything you
[1:55:03] can do that's your obligation
[1:55:05] but you look for the creative
[1:55:08] will of god
[1:55:09] and god's got a revival
[1:55:13] but it's a created revival
[1:55:19] and it's going to be perfect
[1:55:21] and it's going to be right on time
[1:55:23] and it's going to be his will
[1:55:26] so
[1:55:28] jump all you want
[1:55:30] shout all you want sing all you want
[1:55:34] but don't identify it
[1:55:37] as anything other
[1:55:40] than jumping singing and shouting
[1:55:43] there's preachers that can run from one
[1:55:45] into this platform
[1:55:47] to the other
[1:55:48] they can shout hallelujah praise god
[1:55:51] they make these cliche statements and i
[1:55:54] don't even think we know what they mean
[1:55:58] it's an individual fair church
[1:56:01] it's between you and him
[1:56:06] turn your heart to him
[1:56:09] turn your life to him
[1:56:12] say god whatever i'm going to be
[1:56:15] whatever fruits that are in me
[1:56:17] they have to come by your creative will
[1:56:21] and i submit to that creative will
[1:56:25] and i'm trusting in that creative will
[1:56:28] i'm not looking for nothing
[1:56:31] i believe everything's perfect
[1:56:33] everything's on time
[1:56:35] and when they say loie is here
[1:56:39] or lowey is there
[1:56:41] i'm not moved
[1:56:43] because he'll be here
[1:56:45] right on time
[1:56:47] and if you're a part of it
[1:56:49] and you've got a part to play
[1:56:52] there's no enemies
[1:56:54] in the world
[1:56:55] going to keep you from it
[1:56:58] i know right now and i want to thank you
[1:57:01] so much
[1:57:02] for your patience
[1:57:05] we don't have sunday school i know that
[1:57:08] we don't have young people i know

[1:57:23] in the hot sun i know you have to park
[1:57:25] on the dirt and i know it's hard
[1:57:28] but this is our barren time
[1:57:37] but it's to see your reaction
[1:57:40] how are you going to react
