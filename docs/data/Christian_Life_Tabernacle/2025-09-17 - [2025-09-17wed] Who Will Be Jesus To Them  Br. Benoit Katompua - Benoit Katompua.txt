Description:
Who Will Be Jesus To Them?
Br. Benoit Katompua
September 17th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believer
 in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

That is certainly our heart's desire that we would just feel that in our spirit. We ask you, father, to bless us now in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. You may be seated just a moment. We have a couple of announcements to make and and uh uh and then uh uh we're going to have brother Ben to administer for us. Uh I just want to rem uh remind us all those that are listening also that uh about October 19th is going to be our young family day and that's for everybody that has children. Sunday school and age and younger, you're uh welcome to come out. Grandmas are welcome also. And uh so we just want you to rem remember that. And also this Saturday, Lord willing, Saturday's a big day. It's brothers Matthew's birthday and brother Jay's birthday, but it's also a work day uh on the on the pavilion. So, uh, we, uh, we want to do that, uh, and see if we can maybe do a work a little bit on the Cornish and decking and staining, some paneling, and, uh, see if we can get that all finished by the 19th. Uh and then also Saturday morning, I'd like to meet with all the ministers and those who feel that they might have a call or are praying about the ministry, you know, for just about an hour or so uh over maybe some coffee and some snacks of some sort. So, uh, if you're a minister and and or you feel you got a call to the ministry, you're wondering about it, we'd just like to all meet together, uh, we're going to kind of discuss our path forward and, uh, we'd love to have you, uh, uh, there. So, uh, um, and also we're going are looking at enlarging the platform, uh, just a little bit so we can have some more musicians join us and have some of our local ministers join us up here on the platform. So, we'll make it look pretty and uh, so just help us pray about that. And then this Sunday morning, uh, I'm going to be ministering out of, uh, the message end time evangelism. And then brother Matthew's going to follow up Sunday evening. And we're looking forward for a wonderful time in the Lord as we're uh, we'll continue to express to you what uh, I feel God's doing. You know, Brother Brandham said that every time there's a world turmoil that God's fixing to do something. And and you know, there's been some events in our country in the last uh few weeks that have really I mean things are just tore up. uh people are just going crazy. I mean, I don't know another word for it that if they're everybody's pointing fingers and blaming and and and you know, I I feel, you know, my heart goes out. Uh three officers lost their life in Pennsylvania. Uh there's just ter events going and that's all that what that is. We still know God's got a plan and and and we've got to go forward. And this is a statement that brother Brandon made and I think it's beautiful. He said, "The word has to unfold itself." The unfailing word must unfold itself. It's got to in order because the word is God. And if it worked on others all down through the age, it'll work the same way right now because it's God. &gt;&gt; Don't never forget that. So unbelief doesn't stop God. The terrible environment doesn't keep us from having an undying faith to bring every promise of God to pass. So, let us just stand again and we'll sing uh Amazing Grace as we invite brother Ben to come and open the scriptures and and and fellowship with us. And uh you know I I I'm looking forward for a fresh start in my life and and more of the presence of God and the power of God and and and maybe time to draw our sword and start fighting back at the devil. Don't you think? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's tormented us long enough. &gt;&gt; So let's get ready to wave goodbye to him. &gt;&gt; Get into the presence of the Lord. love them and worship them and we'll see what God has for us. I think he's got a lot of wonderful things for us. Amen. And especially for those around us, we believe God's grace is mighty. Let's sing it as we invite Brother Ben this evening. Oh may sing great how sweet the sound that save like me. I once was lost but now [Music] I see. Let's sing that second verse. It's so true. Such praise and all my heart to praise my [Music] pious. thy praise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just worship him in that chorus this evening. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. The Lord put this uh song on my heart as I was studying. If y'all could help me sing it. All I want to see is Jesus. You know, with with everything that our pastor's been the Lord's led him to show us within the word. Truly, when you look at yourself, your heart's cry is to see him. Not to see yourself, &gt;&gt; not to see your failures and shortcomings, but to see him. And oh I know the time is near where everything that I hold thee will lay before the holy cons. All my words and all my deeds and every prayer said on my knees will lay before the holy God soon to be fire. All I want to see is Jesus. Oh, all I want to see is him in me. All I want to see is Jesus shine through me. hurt and selfinflicted pain and everything that I thought gain. Oh, they before the holy consuming fire. Words of knowledge in his name and healing hands that touch the lake will lay before the holy ghost consuming fire. All I want to see is Jesus. [Music] All I want to see is heaven with me. &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer? All I want to see is Jesus shine through me and hear him say, "Oh, well done. Oh my gracious one. Well done. Well done. [Music] I faithful. [Applause] [Music] All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is me. All I want to see is Jesus shine. [Music] Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, that's truly our heart's desire. Lord, when it's all said and done, Lord, I believe it's every true believer's heart's desire to not see themsel, Lord, but to see you, Lord Jesus. Your prophet Paul spoke and said, "It's no more I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me." He said that he must die daily so that you might live, Lord Jesus. Father, that's my heart's desire. That's your people's desire that Ben gets out of the way, Lord. And it be you that the world sees, Father. It be you that all those that we encounter may be able to see, Father. Can they really see your light in your life in us, Father? Lord, if there's anything in your way hindering you from having full preeminence and control in our lives and in our hearts so we could shine forth your light, Father, we ask, Lord, that you remove that obstacle out of the way. Nothing stands before your perfect will, Father. Then your prophet said in this hour that God would have a bride and she would manifest all that was said of her to manifest. There will not be one that fails to manifest what it is they were supposed to, Lord Jesus. Because you never send your word and it return to you void, but it always lands exactly where you want it to, Lord Jesus. We ask you to just have your way in the service. Father, set me aside, Lord. calm my nerves, Lord Jesus. And Father, may you use my lips, Lord, to be able to say something, Father. If it's but a minute, if it's but five minute, if it's but just a sentence, a word, something that blesses one person, Lord Jesus, that it was good for us to have made a sacrifice to come into your house. Lord, we thank you, Lord Jesus. Just ask you to have the preeminence now, Father. We ask this in your precious and mighty and wonderful name. Amen. Thank you musicians. As you're standing, go ahead and turn in the the book of uh St. John, chapter 20, my the Bible I normally use. the cover of it broke. So, I had to bring my study Bible. And if you know, the Thompson chain Bible is big. So, carrying this thing around is and then turning pages and it's all different, but nevertheless, it's the word of the Lord. Let's read in verse 19. Starting in verse 19, he says, "Then then the same day at evening being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst, and said unto them, Peace be unto you." And when he had said so, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, "Peace be unto you. As my Father had sent me, even so send I you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them. And whosoever sins ye retain, they are retained. We're going to read that 23rd verse again because it it struck me. Whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them. And whosoever sins ye retain, they are retained. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. You know, as our a pastor was ministering on Sunday, speaking of the greater work, you know, the great commission, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. The most important thing that was given to us, the Lord gave us power not for us to be content with calling ourselves believers. Not for us to be content with being Holy Ghost filled. It's not to downplay the power of the Holy Ghost or the necessity of the Holy Ghost. You need the Holy Ghost to be a part of his kingdom. You need the Holy Ghost to do anything for him. But you can't be satisfied with just receiving the Holy Ghost because he doesn't just give it to you just so you can say, "I've got it." But he gives it to you for a purpose. He gives it to you to fulfill something, &gt;&gt; right? And he gave them a commission and told them, "Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel." But before they could go, they had to wait to be endued with power from on high. So the power he gives you is for purpose. It's not for for nothing. It's not to rest. It's not to settle, but it's got a there there's something in mind with what he gives you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as as I was just pondering uh the sermons our our pastor has been been led to show us and I really appreciated uh once again looking at the 20th century prophet film that they made to see the prophet you know you hear the voice and then you see his you see his face you see him talk you see his mannerisms you see how he carried himself such humility and then you see in deep call to the deep you see the same thing and what what I found interesting was you know there was a man who spoke to you and said I'm waiting for somebody and then right then and there the person he was waiting for arrives at that point he says I'll take every spirit in this building under my control you see the kind of power he had and then you see his actions &gt;&gt; after receiving such power &gt;&gt; right and then when you try when you try to align that with us in this hour you start looking within yourself and it's like well so I hear this person say they've got power and this is their behavior. I hear that person say they've got power and this is their behavior. I see this person says they've got power and that's the behavior. But then you see the very sheath offering itself that was supposed to be waved over you to show you what a mature son looks like. What a man with power and authority looks like. Brother Brandham would highlight in his sermon and mention and say that the greatest anointing that was ever on a man was on Jesus Christ when he when he spoke and said uh I I believe he speaks about the commission that he was given that he was called to preach the acceptable year of the Lord to set the captive free for the lame to walk. And he's speaking of all these things. Brother Brandham said that was the greatest anointing that was ever on a man. And he specifies and says, "The Lord sat down." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With with such power as that &gt;&gt; he sat down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I You know that sometimes, you know, that that'll that'll start turning your mind a bit. You're like, "Well, you mean the Lord Jesus Christ, God himself in the flesh with all power and authority, &gt;&gt; he himself with all that power, he didn't boast. In fact, he told you, "I come not to speak of myself, &gt;&gt; but with all that power, he sat down &gt;&gt; and and you know, just you look at that attitude that he had and then you mirror that and you look at the sheath offering that was given to us. You see there's there's kindred spirits here &gt;&gt; because he says if that same spirit that was in Christ dwell in you, it'll also quicken your mortal body. It'll bring you, it should bring you to the same maturity. &gt;&gt; Me like in in what sense? No one, no one is telling you how to act, how to behave, how to be be who God made you. &gt;&gt; But don't mistake enthusiasm for power, &gt;&gt; right? Enthusiasm is is good. You you want to be excited. You want to be happy. But that doesn't mean power. Power is knowing what he said, &gt;&gt; believing 100% on what he said and standing on what he said. That's true power. When you can get a son that knows what the word says of him and he has a promise and an obstacle is before him and he says, "Lord, you said in your word," &gt;&gt; if he can have a 100% faith in that word, that is a powerful man. That's the same kind of power. I've often wondered, you know, uh Josh, the Lord, you know what? I'm just gonna let go and let God. But you know, I've often wondered, we we look at Joshua, right? When Joshua stopped the son &gt;&gt; and he spoke, I wonder how he did it. Was it, "Oh, son, you better listen to me now, son. Pause where you're at." Or was it simply, I have need of you to pause. &gt;&gt; What authority. &gt;&gt; Son, stop. &gt;&gt; I've got something I have to do. &gt;&gt; And you setting is not in the plan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've got to fulfill this thing God asked me to do. I need you to stay put exactly where you're at. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; If we get the same kind of attitude. See, when you align yourself with the word, when you align yourself with what he said, &gt;&gt; you all you have to do is say what he said. &gt;&gt; Simply put, just say what he said. We saw the example. They would come up. Brother Brandham would pray and said, "Sister, go and be well in Jesus name." And as she walks off, the spirit tells him, "Get get her back." He gets home. He said, "Wait a minute. a lie was spoken over you. See, all he said was, "Go and be well." Then the spirit said, "Hold on. I'm not done." And he got her attention again. And then he discerned the thoughts in her mind. &gt;&gt; But the simplicity and then other times he just says, "Go and be well. &gt;&gt; You are healed. Go and be well." And you and you start to see this is what brother Brandham described when he preaches Abraham's covenant about Adam having unconscious faith that there was no thought. Adam knew whatever he said, he was given the authority for that thing to come to pass. So when a son comes to maturity, which is being brought back to that same condition Adam was in, all you have to do if you're a true son, is speak the word. &gt;&gt; There's there's nothing else. There's no workup you have to do. &gt;&gt; All you've got to do is say, "Lord, your word says." Now, if your nature is an excitable person, be as excitable as you possibly can. That's who God made you. If your nature is to be still and to be quiet and not be so loud, be who God made you. Do not let anyone, nor I, I trust not even our pastor would tell you or any of the ministers to be any kind of way except how God made you. There's a reason for that. He's a God of variety, &gt;&gt; but what stays constant is his word. &gt;&gt; So whether you're enthused, whether you're not, as long as the word is on your lips, you've got full authority &gt;&gt; to speak whatever it is you desire and it come to pass. &gt;&gt; In Mark uh 16, it says, and this is just some of the commission that he gives. Mark 16:15-18. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. To every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And Jesus came and spake unto them. This is Matthew 28:18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. See, I I have to drop this in there because the Lord just gave it to me. Notice he says, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations." &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter where you're from, &gt;&gt; what part of the country you're from. Let's just catch what he says here. Go and teach all nations. You tell me if he gives them a different message. Baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what what does that mean? That means all that he has commanded &gt;&gt; in this hour we received the message which was Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't America's message. &gt;&gt; It wasn't India's message. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Asia's message. It was the message according to this scripture. I moved to believe it's all the same for everybody and we all have to fall in line with the same message. We can't have something tailor made to our ideas, to our ways of living, to the ways we were raised because a true disciple, and we'll get into this later, but a true disciple is not just one that follows, right? He he called pe uh Matthew, James, John. He called those his disciples because they followed him. But they weren't really true disciples till they received the spirit. &gt;&gt; Because being a disciple, according to the definition, is to imitate the life. &gt;&gt; They couldn't imitate the life without the life in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. So they were they were it was the earnest of disciplehip. Once they received the spirit and they were endued with power then they could actually live the life of a disciple and they could not just be a follower but an imitator. &gt;&gt; Watch the life. &gt;&gt; This is what it says. And this is why it's important what the Lord put on our pastor to show us. You have to have something you're looking towards. You have to have an example that you're focused on. If you don't have a target, you don't know what you're striving to achieve. &gt;&gt; I'm not st I'm not striving to achieve a certain kind of I if if I could say energy, a certain kind of uh uh uh uh uh uh matching your personality, matching this. I'm not striving for that. What I'm striving for is is is the same meek spirit, the humble, the humility that he had, the lowering of himself, the kind of spirit that makes you stand by someone and say, "Hey, man, my my shoes and your feet. I I hope that I hope these can fit you." That say, "Man, my coat. I'd love to give you my coat." It's that we have something we're looking towards. And this is an example for us because our Bible tells us to be disciples. &gt;&gt; He commisss them to make disciples not unto themselves. Paul never said follow me. I know your mind goes Paul said follow me like but then he says like I follow Christ. So his example was Christ. He wasn't asking them to follow him the person. He says I'm following him. You follow me as I'm following him. If Paul misaligned, that's why he said, "Even if an angel from heaven come down and say anything against what I have spoken to you, let him be accursed." Because Paul knew what he was saying was not of himself. He knew who gave them the word. Therefore, my example on what maturity looks like, &gt;&gt; on what Jesus in the flesh looks like, my first example is our prophet. &gt;&gt; The sheath offering shows us what it means for a son to come to true maturity &gt;&gt; and have all power in his hands. &gt;&gt; Don't let that offend you. And don't put that in the office of a prophet &gt;&gt; because it's also given to you a son to have the same power as he had. &gt;&gt; Was it a prophet that moved the chandelier or was it a son? &gt;&gt; Was it a prophet that stopped the storm or was it a son? &gt;&gt; It was a son. If we're not careful, you start to place things in the realms of a prophet and you and you leave it there and you deny yourself the full maturity because you say, "I could never achieve that because that was only supposed to happen in that vessel." But I'm sorry. Since I was young and knew this message, I didn't live it all my life the best I could. But something in my heart said, "I I want to be able to create squirrels. Think of a child. If you ask a child, you say, "What do you want?" And the child says, my my dad told me a story one time of of um he'd be my great uncle. He had his kids sitting around and they were praying and he said, "Well, you know, ask God anything you want. God will give it to you." The little girl says, "You said ask anything." You know, when a when a child specifies, "Ask anything." You know what they're about to ask is crazy. She said, "You said ask anything." He said, "Yes, ask anything." and God will give it to you. She said, "Lord, give me beignet." Beignet, which is which is it's it's it's how do I explain it to you? We'll call it African donuts. She says, "Give me beignet." Translation, "Give me African donut." The father says, "No, no, no. It doesn't work like that." My dad, when he told that story to my dad, my dad said, "You just stopped God." A childlike faith &gt;&gt; that just speaks what it wants. expecting to receive it because you told the child, "Ask anything, it'll be given to you." Then you say that to the child, then you hinder the child from doing the very thing you just told them to do. &gt;&gt; Who knows? Maybe in the asking of Lord, give me bign, &gt;&gt; somebody would have stopped by a couple minutes after and said, "I don't know why, but I I'm here to leave this for you. I I don't know what's moved on me, but I've got to bring this to you." We have to have childlike faith &gt;&gt; where you just know daddy's going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what I ask for. Daddy's going to make it happen because daddy's able to do anything. &gt;&gt; Daddy's got the power to do anything. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith God wants us to have. &gt;&gt; That's what a son looks like. &gt;&gt; He just speaks &gt;&gt; and he's foolish enough to believe it'll be given to him. But we need that kind of foolish faith sometimes. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we organize too much in our minds and plan out how God's supposed to do something. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let faith loose. &gt;&gt; Let faith loose. God could have taught her a valuable lesson that could have changed and done something for her for her entire life that she could have been able to point back to and said the same God that I asked give me Beign and provided it is the same God in this circumstance when I ask something will give it to me. Have you ever asked for something that seemed impossible &gt;&gt; and then in the foolishness God grants it to you? &gt;&gt; I know what that looks like. &gt;&gt; Amen. for when I graduated high school. Just just to give an example, when I graduated high school, I I I needed some clothes to for graduation. I needed some pants. I needed a shirt. I needed some some things. It was a need. It wasn't a want. It was a need. And you know, I, you know, was praying about it. Uh my dad and mom were weren't able to get it for me at the time. And I was just, Lord, you know, I I have this need. Father, you know the need. And whatever you do, whether you give it to me or not, I'll go in jeans. It doesn't matter. But I have need of this thing. And I left it alone. And you know, just wondering, my mom's like, she was she was bugging me all week. Listen to a child. My mom was bugging me all week. But she she was, "Ben, Ben, Ben, your uncle's been calling you. You got to you got to you got to call him back." I'm like, "Man, what's he calling me for?" like I'm I'm so I was I'll call him. And I I I call him and and he says, "Hey, uh nephew." I was like, "Yeah, yeah." He said, "Um, hey, I've been wanting to take you shopping and I've been trying to get a hold of you and you're not answering." &gt;&gt; And I'm like, before I even made the request, God already had the answer for what I had need of prepared. Mom didn't speak to him. My dad didn't speak to him. Something moved on his heart before I could ever speak. and what I asked for, he already had the answer coming. &gt;&gt; This goes to show you sometimes it's it's not in the asking alone. The asking is a part to play. But he's a good father. He knows what you have need of before you even ask. But you have to make the exercise of asking so that when you receive, you know, ask shall be given. It's a law. You have to have that law there. If you don't ask, you'll never receive. And he says uh in John 13:34, "A new commandment I give you, that ye love one another as I have loved you. That ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you love one to another." This is where my inspiration kind of uh uh um comes in. He says, by this. What's this? That you love one another as I have loved you. See the kind of love the Lord had. Just go back to each one of the disciples when he called them, what they were doing, the kind of life they were living, and what he pulled them out of. Yet, having not yet received the spirit, yet he still loved them. Don't let the devil tell you because you don't know if you've got the Holy Ghost or not that God don't love you. That's not how God works. If you're his child, he loved you when you were unlovable. &gt;&gt; He cared about you when no one else did. &gt;&gt; He desired to save you when you thought you couldn't be saved. His circumstances and conditions isn't based on ours. It's predestination. &gt;&gt; His choice, his election, what he desires. It's a plan that was there before you came in. You can't mess up his plan. It's his perfect plan. &gt;&gt; But it it it it struck me in that thought and my title meant to give it earlier but is who will be Jesus to them? &gt;&gt; Because he asks us love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another. By this shall all men. The sign that all men will look at and know that you're a disciple of God is not how many miracles you've done. &gt;&gt; Not how many Hail Marys you've done, not how many church services you've attended. &gt;&gt; It's love. &gt;&gt; Love puffet not. &gt;&gt; Love is patient. Yes, &gt;&gt; this this is what he's saying. You'll know you're my disciples by the love. &gt;&gt; And I begin to see something in me. Who will be Jesus to them? Do they see Jesus in me? Does my life match his? If I'm to be his disciple, does it align? Do my attributes do am I resembling him? &gt;&gt; Is my heart like his my actions and my father I do nothing lest you show with me first or am I ask questions later do it first. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. That's not how God works. Permission first because if not you will mess it up. He might give you a vision of something and if you act before it's time, you will surely mess it up &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean he won't work it out because he worked all things. &gt;&gt; Even those things you do that you messed up, he will find some way &gt;&gt; to get it back in line. &gt;&gt; So don't fret if you've already messed it up. &gt;&gt; Anybody? Don't fret if you've already royally messed it up. &gt;&gt; He'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; All you have to do as a son, &gt;&gt; get back in line. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I've made a mess of things." &gt;&gt; But you, you're the mess. You fix all messes. &gt;&gt; When the puzzle pieces don't fit, you switch them out with the correct ones. When I try to force a picture, force an image, and it's the wrong one, you change the image. I was never meant to manifest this image. &gt;&gt; It's It's like if you if if you ever It's just you think of a puzzle. You got a picture you're looking at and you're making the puzzle and you put all the pieces together and they fit, but the image isn't right. All the pieces fit or you made them fit, but it doesn't make the image. He didn't ask you when you saw the wrong image to then go, "Oh man, I got to fix this. I got to I got to correct this. I got to change this. I need to No, no, no, no, no. Step back and look at the big picture. The image you created is attached to this flesh. His image has no part with you. &gt;&gt; You You can't participate in the image he creates. He uses your vessel to do his perfect will. &gt;&gt; He uses your voice to speak. He uses your hands to work. This is what God does. He corrects the image himself. &gt;&gt; It it's it struck me when we look at our attitudes. He commisss them make disciples. He tells them you'll know them. You'll know they will know that you are disciples of me by your love one for another. Then it struck me. It behooves me to look at some of the things the Lord Jesus did that showed who he was and if I have the same attitude towards the same things. You see, we're so quick at times when we see somebody in fault, when we see somebody in the wrong. I'm drawing my inspiration from the sermon uh that our pastor preached out of taking sides with Jesus. I didn't know that it was in there when this thought came to my mind because we finished a portion we were listening to and then I the Lord put this thought in my mind before I was asked to speak and as I was thinking I'm like Lord I need what sermon am I going to find this in I I see it in your word so your prophet had to have preached it &gt;&gt; and I was you know what our pastor's been in taking sides with Jesus let me just listen to that and I listen to after he gets done with that first part and he starts now preaching taking sides with Jesus. And I said, "Lord, you work all things. You make everything perfect." &gt;&gt; Because then the the Lord just started everything line by line by line, ministering to me, dealing with me. But I saw we look at one another, we judge, &gt;&gt; we gossip, &gt;&gt; we ridicule. Oftent times, if you're honest with yourself, you set traps for people, whether it's in a line of questioning to get them to say something and then for you to anchor in that thing that they said to then have something to gossip about, something to talk about. But I I found it completely contradictory to the life and action of the Lord Jesus Christ. I took three examples and we're going to walk through the examples. I won't be much longer. There's a lot to say, but I can't say it all. &gt;&gt; We we look at these things and we judge. &gt;&gt; We say, "Man, that man, that person did wrong. If he had the Holy Ghost, he wouldn't have acted that way. &gt;&gt; Man, that person did this. You You don't understand. I mean, if he was a true believer, he wouldn't behave that way. Then I start looking at Jesus in the Bible and I start realizing every person that everybody else judged, he had a heart for. &gt;&gt; You call this person a prostitute. You call this person this. You say all these things about them. &gt;&gt; We don't even give a second glance. It's as if we walk with a meter of sin in our hands and we see somebody living in sin automatically, man. If the Lord Jesus was here today, man, he would just he would tear this nation apart. But we know his heart because he's told it to us. He would love to have saved everybody. That's the kind of attitude he had. &gt;&gt; He wasn't there with a measuring stick. He knew who was his child and who wasn't. &gt;&gt; Yet he still told Cain, "If you do as your brother, &gt;&gt; but I wonder if we do that." Do we have the attribute in the life of Christ? This struck me. The greater works is the saving of souls. You can't expect somebody else &gt;&gt; to reach the people you have access to at your job. &gt;&gt; Don't put it on me. &gt;&gt; Don't put it on brother Billy. Don't put it on our pastor. He placed you there &gt;&gt; because you could reach them. &gt;&gt; You have to be Jesus to them. &gt;&gt; Your life must be salty. you're the example. But I wondered, I saw it within myself where I'm walking around, it's like, "Oh, pity, man. That if the Lord was here, man, he just wouldn't like that." That's not how God's attitude was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He hated the sin, not the sinner. when he's so wrong and everybody's piling and piling. Brother Brandham showed it to you in his own life with the woman at the restaurant that he walks in and he has a measuring stick of sin and he's judging and condemning her and the Lord showed him himself &gt;&gt; and he had to be Jesus to her. Hey, though your sins are many, the blood of Jesus will cleanse it all. You haven't gone too far. &gt;&gt; You haven't done too much. What's our attitude? I started looking at the prostitute that they brought to him. I I I want to I want to read this. But Jesus went onto the Mount of Olives. John 8. And early in the morning, he came again into the temple. And all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them. And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery. They caught her in the act, and brought her to him to be judged. And it it opened up to me and struck me. How many times does somebody bring to you a brother, a sister's fault, &gt;&gt; expecting you to judge, to say something about it, &gt;&gt; rather than looking at the moment the same way Christ did, &gt;&gt; they're trying to get Jesus to say something, judge her. Though the law condemned her, You could find me somebody in sin. What would your attitude be towards that believer? &gt;&gt; Would we say the same way Jesus did or would we be ready there to cast the first stone? &gt;&gt; Oh, you sinner, you. If you had any ounce of Holy Ghost in you, you wouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; That wasn't Jesus's attitude. &gt;&gt; We're maturing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're headed somewhere. &gt;&gt; We have to be sons imparting eternal life to others. &gt;&gt; When everybody else wants to pile up and judge and condemn, open up your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Draw them in. &gt;&gt; People are yearning for Jesus. &gt;&gt; They need something real. &gt;&gt; And if you're not that example, &gt;&gt; they may miss their opportunity. You have to speak. You have to show the life, show the love, the care. &gt;&gt; We're so quick to have a stern hand of judgment when wrong takes place. But God was merciful. &gt;&gt; I trust all of you. I I've seen it. Somebody bring me someone's fault, someone's error. Man, could you believe brother so and so did this, this, this? Sister so and so did this, that, and the third. If you're not careful, you start saying, "Man, I really don't, man. Yeah, man, that's unfort that that that happened. Man, how could they have done that?" And you start adding to it. When you're called to kill it, you you'll hear Brother Brandham say it in the sermon. You're supposed to cover it. Love covers a multitude of sins. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to say, "Oh, those are your sins, brother. Come here. I I I'll still accept you. &gt;&gt; I'll still love you &gt;&gt; if you show the life of Christ. Brother Brandham said, "The greatest power there is is love." &gt;&gt; Love heals. Love saves. &gt;&gt; You have to be able to have true love. Even for your enemy, even for the one that does something despicable, you have to be able to love him. &gt;&gt; That's the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Loving the unlovable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgiving the unforgivable. &gt;&gt; The commission is he whose sins you remit shall be remitted. He whose sins you retain shall be retained. I don't know about you. I don't want to retain any of your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not given to me. &gt;&gt; Because how you judge is how you're judged. &gt;&gt; There's grace, an abundance of grace. That should be our attitude. He says, "They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou?" This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down with his finger, wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. See, sometimes When somebody brings you someone's fault, someone's error, the person that brought it to you, you should send them away. Go to the person. Hey, I was told you were did this and so happened. You want to see your brother? Let's pray together and overcome this. That should be our attitude. We shouldn't join in the gossip. We shouldn't join in the tearing down of one another. We should be uplifting one another. That's what Jesus did. And I I begin to ask myself when Jesus lifted up himself. He's alone with her and saw none but the woman. He said unto her,"Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" She said, "No, man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Is that the kind of attitude we want? &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude we ought to have. &gt;&gt; That's a mature son. That's the son, the first of the race. And you then you start matching it because it's important. You got to watch the life. This is what was playing in my mind. Then I go to brother Brandham and I see his attitude towards people that were in the same condition. &gt;&gt; The women in this ain't asylum who thinks all hope is lost. Her flesh accuses her because of the sins she made. All the things she did. Yet he be he was Jesus to her. &gt;&gt; Restored her. I want that to be me. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to see fault and dwell on it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see fault and add fuel to the fire. &gt;&gt; I want to live the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Help my brother. &gt;&gt; Pray for my brother. Hey, you know you you want to spread that stuff. If you really love them, you'd pray for them. &gt;&gt; It doesn't do you no good to tell me his faults. Why add that image to your brother, to your sister, &gt;&gt; of what someone else did, the fault they had. If you loved them, you'd pray for them. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't share it. You wouldn't continue to add fuel to that fire. Then it brought me to another one, the woman at the well. Let's remember in the first example, they brought someone to him. This is now Jesus having the burden. Brother Brandham shows us in the story of the woman at the well. He said the Lord said, I have need to go by Samaria. He had a need to go and restore someone. That's why he went. It struck me. It says he was weary after the long journey, he was tired. Yet, it was that time that he had to do something for God. I wonder how many times after a long day of work, &gt;&gt; we say, "All my opportunity to be Jesus to somebody has ran out. Now it's time for me to rest. I am tired. I've done so much. Don't you know how busy I am? I've got to spend time with my family. I've got to do this. I've got to do that. We got all the excuses in the book. &gt;&gt; But there's no time slot for being Jesus to someone. Always be aware of the opportunity that presents itself to shed the light and the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; You want to be an example at all times, &gt;&gt; not just when you're out at work because if you're not careful, you will miss the opportunities to be Jesus in your own household &gt;&gt; because you're tired, you're exhausted. This is home. This is where my brain shuts down. I don't want to deal with anything else. That wasn't Jesus's attitude. Though he was weary, he had work to do. I must be about my father's business. He says, "When therefore John 4, when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples, he left Judea and departed again unto Galilee. and he must needs to go through Samaria. Then cometh he to the city of Samaria, which is called Cyra, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said unto her, "Give me to drink." for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy me. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew askketh drink of me, which I'm a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Here we are again with traditions and customs. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest the gift of God, and who it is that say to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman said unto him, "Sir, thou has nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us well, and drank thereof himself, and the children and his cattle?" Jesus answered, said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of the water shall th of of this water shall thirst again. But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I give shall give him shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. You become the well when you drink of the well. &gt;&gt; That's a part of the commission. You got to drink. &gt;&gt; So when somebody else is thirsty, somebody else needs a drawing from that well of everlasting life. You're a source of water to them. &gt;&gt; You, we have a pivotal role to play. We cannot squander this responsibility to be sons. There's a mission at hand. &gt;&gt; There's a war going on. Look at the state of our nation. Spiritual warfare is rampant. We can't have lazy soldiers. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the soldier is not the minister. &gt;&gt; It's the believer. &gt;&gt; You're the soldier. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The battlefield is everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in your mind. &gt;&gt; It's at work. It's at school. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; At home. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's you. There's no resting from the war. If you're not guarded and ready, &gt;&gt; catch what's going on. Don't let your guards down. &gt;&gt; Be ready at all times. That's the kind of life Jesus had. They tried to throw this and that and this and that to try to stumble him to try to throw a shadow over what he was doing. But it failed every time. &gt;&gt; Why? He was the very word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It should be the same with you. Why? Because you are the very word. Amen. &gt;&gt; What was said of him, he fulfilled and believed 100%. What was said of you, you ought to fulfill and believe 100%. If nothing stood before him, nothing should stand against you. &gt;&gt; You and him are one. &gt;&gt; All power that was given to him is given unto you. The the the last example that came to me was the woman with the alabaster box. The first example, they brought someone to him to be the judge. The second example, he had need to go save somebody to go add a soul. And once he did, she became a living well because she ran out &gt;&gt; testifying of the water she just took drink of. &gt;&gt; I Your testimony is so important. &gt;&gt; Never stop sharing your testimony. &gt;&gt; If you want the quickest way to kill the joy in your life is to stop talking about what he did for you. &gt;&gt; That is the for sure way to kill the joy of your salvation. stop sharing. But if you've lost it and you want to gain back the joy of your salvation, start telling people how your candle got lit, what he did for you. &gt;&gt; Something just begins to well up. &gt;&gt; Living waters, it begins to well up and it flows. &gt;&gt; They can see that a thirst comes and says, "Wow, if God could do that for him in that condition, in that circumstance, how much more me? Can there be God for me?" Yes, there can. No, but I've done so much you don't understand, brother. It doesn't matter. There still can be God for you. &gt;&gt; I've been an atheist my whole life. It don't matter. There's still God for you. &gt;&gt; Give me the circumstance. The well is there to f to to quench that thirst. Regardless of what it is, the everlasting well is everlasting. In this example, she comes to him. See, it's easy to have people brought to us and we're given the opportunity to either be Jesus to them or to just judge them. And at other times we meet people &gt;&gt; and because we've been desensitized to being sensitive to the voice, the still small voice, we miss the opportunities to have moments like the woman at the well &gt;&gt; to go and do the work. An example that struck me what happened with brother Paul. Something spoke in him, I got to go pray for that little girl. And because an action came behind it, it wasn't just the burden, but an action followed. And because the action followed the burden, the miracle came on the scene. Sometimes God puts someone on your mind. Pray for this person. Reach out to this person. See how they're doing. And you just no, I'm busy. And you miss the opportunity to be Jesus to somebody. I I I will never forget it. I was working with brother Tommy somewhere in uh I I believe we were in in in a uh Lewisville doing a job and we went into a uh burger spot and I saw this blind man. He wasn't just blind, he had no eyes. What a sight. and something bubbled up in me. Go and pray for him. I said, "No, Lord, it can't be me." I know. I've heard the story of Brother Brandon praying for that little girl. And the eyes come down and he said, "Oh, sorry, Brother Brandon made a mistake. What color eyes do you want?" And it was given to her. I see. I had attributed that only to a prophet, &gt;&gt; not to a son. &gt;&gt; So here, the Lord's put the desire in my heart to pray for this person that's got no eyes. And his his father must have been in his 80s with a cane watching over his little boy that was maybe in his 30s. And yet, I didn't listen to that voice. I missed an opportunity. I'm not sitting here telling you my prayer would have given him eyes. That's not what I'm telling you. What I'm telling you is God was trying to transmit orders to me and I disobeyed the order. Do you know what happens in the military when your bosses give you orders and you don't obey? You get discharged. You're not fit to be in the military if you do not know how to obey orders. If we're not careful, God gives you order after order after order after order, and you deny every single one of them. Then we have the audacity to say, "Where are the miracles? Where is the God of Elijah? I know he said divine healing is still real, but Father, I haven't seen it in a while. I know he said saving deliverance is real, but because we're denying orders. I I'm not here just to work, try to make a living, pay bills, that's that's not what we're here for. &gt;&gt; We've got a job to do. We've got orders to fulfill. Go ye into all the world. Preach the gospel. Be Jesus to somebody. &gt;&gt; Show the life. Be salty. These are our orders. These signs shall follow them that believe. Imagine what would have happened if Peter and them would have missed blind Barnameus. What would have happened? They couldn't have said, "Silver and gold have none. Oh no, we've been endued with power. That's all. We're just going to sit down and do nothing." That wouldn't work because the commission he gave them was to be endued with power and do the work. It's the same with us. He gives us power to do the work. You got to be honest with yourself. I got honest, Ben. You're lazy. You're You squander your responsibility. You got a part to play. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't pat yourself on the back for praying in the morning and reading your Bible and that's all you did. &gt;&gt; That's your duty. You're supposed to do that. &gt;&gt; You don't get a a medal for doing your due diligence. Do what you're supposed to feed every day. But you're feeding for a purpose &gt;&gt; to become the word so you can give the word. &gt;&gt; But if you're just feeding and hoarding, you're selfish. &gt;&gt; That's right. You're just eat and you never give anybody. &gt;&gt; You got to share. &gt;&gt; God does something for you. Tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Tell that coworker that doesn't like you. Hey man, you know the Lord did something for me. He might he might look at you like, "Why is this guy talking to me?" &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Share. &gt;&gt; You never know. It might strike something in him that somebody else will reach out to him and say something to him and then somebody else. You don't know how God's soldiers are intertwined. You might meet somebody and say something and somehow they end up meeting somebody else that's a believer at this church and says something to them and gets them into the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And not just the house, but gets them to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what brother Brandham said. He said, "All these men were bringing people to church, but they weren't leading them to Christ. They weren't leading them all the way. &gt;&gt; They had to meet the person. Get a hold of the person." Brother Brandham, the the scripture says in Luke, "And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house and brother Brandham kind of expands on this story. We we I thank God for a prophet. I really do because brother Brandham said this Pharisee invited him to set a trap. This wasn't a oh I just want you to come and spend. No, this was a trap that he tried to set for Jesus. And and when that woman with the alabaster box came and all of them knew who she was, he was, "Oh, this is gonna be good. We gonna get him now." And Jesus just sits there, lets her tears wash his feet, puts oil on him, and kisses him. Look at the attitude of Jesus. And behold, woman in the city which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meet in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment. Now when the Pharisees which had bidden him solid, he spake with themselves, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touchth him, for she is a sinner." And Jesus answering unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he said, Master, say on. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors, the one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most. Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. He said unto him, Thou has rightly judged. And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seeest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, and thou gavest me no water for my feet, but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss. But this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil, thou didest not anoint. But this woman had anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they sat at me with him be to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? And he said unto the woman, "Thy faith has saved thee. Go in peace." This is his attitude. I wonder if we would allow somebody that we thought was the worst of the worst sinners to do something for us and by that be a blessing to them or do we just I'm going to distance myself completely. I'm not saying go into these places. I'm not telling you to go to a club. I'm not telling you to go I'm not telling you to go in places you have no business being. But what I'm saying is if somebody is brought to you, they come to you because they see something in you and they want to do a service for you. That may be their opportunity for their sins to be forgiven. &gt;&gt; You could be Jesus to them. He who has done good to the least of my children has done it unto me. &gt;&gt; We have to open our hearts. Be more like him. &gt;&gt; I I I want to anchor this with with a couple quotes. I won't be much longer and we'll close. Brother Brandham says in uh taking sides with Jesus paragraph 130, you know, the real Christian way is to hide everything you can from a brother. Don't tell his bad things. Just tell his good things. Just tell what you know about him is good. If anything is bad, let it alone. Poor fellow has got enough against him. Anyhow, you see this the attitude of a prophet, the attitude of a son, they've got enough against them already. I I I I really ask myself when I see somebody that's really down in sin. Am I so quick to judge because I forget how much is against them? Did I forget what it was that was against me before I met him? the oppression, how hard it was to do right, to live right, to think right. Did I forget? Am am I no longer sensitive? Have I lost patience? What's my attitude to someone like that? Do I say, "Oh man, they've got so much against them already as it is. Lord, forgive them." or am I man if God was here God would judge them. That's the kind of life that will send you to hell. This is things we say out of our mouths if you're honest with yourself. He says poor fellow has got enough against him anyhow. Don't try to take a pull and shove a man further into the ditch. &gt;&gt; The Christian attitude is pick him up and take him out of the ditch. See, don't never try to shove him down. He is down already. &gt;&gt; Try to help him up. Some of the attitude we have is when we see somebody of of of what we would consider value do something wrong, we start getting excited that we caught them doing something wrong. Brother David, I got him. What? You'll hear brother Brandham, Brother Brandham say here soon that you're all bound to make a mistake. The same attitude you have towards somebody else, remember what goes around comes around. If you have a bad attitude towards people, &gt;&gt; if you're always quick to judge, don't be mistaken. When your time comes, you will see the same attitude given back to you. You'll realize just how unfair it is that a weak moment becomes your identity. Rather than saying, "Come here, my brother. Come here, my sister. I I know you've fallen. I know you've made an error. Let's pray. We're going to get this devil out today. We're going to pray till we break through. &gt;&gt; I want that love in me. That's my heart's desire. When I see wrong, come on, brother. Let's pray. Let's get this out. &gt;&gt; I refuse for this to be your identity. That's the devil's lie. Brother Ram says, "Try to help him." But too many of us today, too many people today, I might say, try to do that. If they could just get something another that they could say that was real bad. Now, for instance, if one of you brethren would make a mistake and do something is wrong, which are subject to do it. I am too. Every one of us. No one is left here. Every one of us. But as we go along, let's remember we are brothers. &gt;&gt; We are brothers. &gt;&gt; And if we go, if we got any fighting, let's fight with one another. &gt;&gt; Bring it together. Bring it before our brethren and settle it. &gt;&gt; We got to be better about settling things. &gt;&gt; We let things linger. &gt;&gt; You know what it does? I'm just going to say it. I'm not married yet. But um the people you love the most have the greatest capacity to annoy you. the greatest capacity to cause anger out of you, to cause frustration. &gt;&gt; My eyes are closed cuz I don't want to see your faces. But the one you love so much that you said, "Honey, I'll love you in the good times and the bad times. Through thick and thin, we'll always be together." and then they do something wrong and it's all get away from me. I don't want to be next to this person. Let's just be honest with ourselves. &gt;&gt; This is our attitude. You're not my favorite person right now. I really don't like you. And we let it linger &gt;&gt; and linger and linger rather than settle it. We marinate in whatever it was that took place. Right? &gt;&gt; And then next week something else happens. Remember what you did last week. &gt;&gt; When you settle something, this is how Jesus settle something. You sin. You make it right. See your forgetfulness. That's it. &gt;&gt; I know some of you that have been married for years say, "Oh, poor Ben." You don't know. It's easy to say. forgive throw in sea of forgetfulness. But the woman, you have to understand, she remembers everything. She will remind you of that sin you committed at 12:01 a.m. June 30th, 1990. It wasn't settled. We got to get better at settling things. If you ask for forgiveness, restore thy brethren, restore your husband, restore your wife. You've forgiven, right? Restore them. Don't bring it back up. &gt;&gt; And that's all I'm saying. He says, "Bring it together and settle it." Now, they used to in the Brandon family. Now, I don't advise married couples to do this part here because this isn't this is interesting. If one of the little ones done something, they was going to tell Bill about it cuz I was the biggest and I had to stand there and see which was right and wrong. Well, my decision was that if they which was right and wrong, if they still didn't believe it, then they go around behind my back and fought it out. But they were still brothers. You see, they'd fight in the backyard with one another and fight in the front yard for one another. &gt;&gt; So that's the way it is. See, and we're still brothers. How we let things leak out to the front yard. &gt;&gt; Rather than keeping it in the backyard, we want to bring it out for all to see. You've you've probably heard the phrase, "I'll defend you in public. I'll correct it in private." That's the believer's attitude. The opportunity to correct is not when everybody else is throwing the stone. That's when you defend. &gt;&gt; Brother Billy Paul gave a testimony here at the church in 2008 about an argument he had with his wife and he was right in his story. He says, "I was right." He said, "I went to my dad cuz I wanted my dad to say, you were right. I told my dad what happened. My dad took her side." He said after she had left, he said, "Now, Billy, you know you was wrong." And she goes, he goes, "But dad," he said, "now I taught you better." I believe he said, "No, you know better." Ain't that funny? A prophet that knows the sins you've committed, knows you were right, yet tells you you're wrong. Well, that's the way we got to do this. If you got something against somebody, your brother, don't tell somebody else about it. If it's wrong, go to him and tell him. And then if he's going to argue with you, then take somebody else with you. Then bring it up the way the Bible said. &gt;&gt; But Jesus, they just tried to find every little shadow they could to try to belittle him in the sight of the people. And that's what the devil wants. They want to they want to hurt your influence before the people. &gt;&gt; That's the way you want this advice. That's the way you want to watch careful what you do. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Walk like real men of God. Talk like men of God. See, act like men of God. Live like men of God. Because the devil, your adversary, is going about like a roaring lion trying to devour what he can. &gt;&gt; There's so much in here, but I look at the time. I'm going to jump to to uh to close. Let me find it here. So, brother Brandham says, this is about the woman with the alabaster box. He says, "And Jesus sit and watched her, never moved the foot till she got done." If you're going to do something for Jesus, Jesus sat and watched you do it sometime. Uh-huh. He lets you go ahead till you get finished. Then the reward comes. Maybe you run the whole race of life working for him. But don't worry, there's a reward at the end. If you just take your way with his side, you might not see one person healed that you pray for. Just keep on praying for them. I've often said if I prayed for 500 a night, see this this this is good to me because it doesn't matter how hard you prayed, it's not how hard you pray that brings the answer. God is sovereign. You might pray for the saving of a life and he saves it. You might pray for saving of a life and he takes it. Either or. It doesn't disprove the word. &gt;&gt; It remains the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; His sovereign timing is his business. &gt;&gt; We don't know that. We just make our requests known &gt;&gt; and have faith. What we ask for shall be given. But his perfect will gets done in the end. &gt;&gt; He says, I've often said, if I prayed for 500 a night, all 500 dead in the morning, tomorrow night, I'll be preaching divine healing and pray for the sick. See, don't have one thing to do with it. See, he'll let you come right down through defeats and everything else till you come right down to the end of the road and finish your work like he led that woman. She wanted to do him a service. So, he just held his feet out there and let her wash him. Oh, if he'd have said, "Don't do that," she'd have jumped and run. But he let her do the service. And after she got through, finished the service that she was going to do, when he looked up, that hypocrite standing back there, was trying to cast the blackness on his name, said, "Simon, I've got something to say to you. Not to her, but to you standing back there in your heart. That's the reason you brought me down here. You have no fellowship with me." Didn't I know it? But you brought me down here and you set me back here to make fun of me. Let you never give me no water to wash my feet. You never give me nothing to soothe me. Me sitting here burning and hurting. You never give me no oil for my face. You was ashamed to kiss me. Welcome or shake my hand. See, you was ashamed to to k You was ashamed before your company. You was ashamed to do it. This woman, since she has come in, she has did nothing but rub my feet and bathe them with the very tears of her eyes, wiped them with the towel of her own hair. Then I'll just show you whether I'm a prophet or not. Amen. I like that. Now, I want to speak to you just a minute. Your sins, which are many, are all forgiven. H Did they blight his name? They thought they had it. They thought they had stopped it. They thought they'd fixed him so his revival could never be in that community. They thought they had ruined his influence, but it just taken one person, &gt;&gt; this is us, it just taken one person that loved him to turn the whole situation &gt;&gt; who will be Jesus to them. Notice what brother Brandham says after this. How do you know that you're not that person &gt;&gt; for your community? &gt;&gt; Amen. or somebody that you'll meet. &gt;&gt; Take sides with him. &gt;&gt; Do him a service. &gt;&gt; Do something for him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Know what I mean, brethren? Take your side with Jesus. Take him. Make him your choice. Do service for him. Regardless of whatever anybody else or you're ever repaid or anything, don't make any difference. Wait till the work is over. How would you like for him to say even though you had prayed for sick and and they didn't get well though you prayed to get to speak with tongues and they and you didn't do it you prayed to prophesy you didn't do it but yet the only thing you can do is tell the story of Jesus in your church in your community at work you couldn't even do one thing didn't lead one person that woman didn't lead one to Christ but she done a service for him and what difference does it make at the end of the road if he will say and I say unto you all your sins though there not one prayer was answered for you but you come on the basis of my word. This is the importance of coming on the basis of the word. &gt;&gt; Whether the act is performed or not, so long as you come on the basis of the word, you're anchored. &gt;&gt; You cannot be moved. He says, "But you come on the basis of the word. You come because you believed me and you did me a service and I say that the many sins that you have done is all forgiven you." That would be good enough for me. Amen. Yes, sir. All right. If the musicians would come, let's all stand. Brother Brandham says they want to say the days of miracles are passed and so forth. Let them go ahead and say it, but let us do the service for the Lord. They hated him because they were jealous of him. That's the only reason they were jealous. They were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they're doing now. They if they can just destroy the influence of the message before the people, then they've got the thing whipped. What do you think our pastor's been waring against when he's talking about getting back to the main thing? getting back to the original being the message because a lot of things is going on in this world that's trying to ruin or tarnish the influence of the message. But the message stands alone. We need somebody to take the message and live the message. The message isn't the problem. It's the people. You get somebody that fully surrenders themsel to the word, to the message of the hour, you will see a lived life guaranteed &gt;&gt; because you come on the basis of the word. My question to you, who will be Jesus to them? If not you, who? Who can fill your shoes? We've got work to do. a lot of work to do. Our focus was swayed. We got too busy trying to fix other people's problems rather than looking for saved souls, trying to correct with this brother, that brother, this brother, this. &gt;&gt; The word does the correction. &gt;&gt; Preach the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus still spoke the word. Even after what brother Brandham says in this sermon, he still preached the word and told you what was right and what was wrong. He still told you what the life was, what the Holy Ghost was. It didn't stop him from preaching sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; But what he was trying to tell us is what good does it do you to try to correct every doctrine and the life doesn't follow. &gt;&gt; We've got to watch for one another. see the opportunities God gives us to be Jesus to somebody. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "I'd rather have somebody with the wrong doctrine and the right spirit than the right doctrine and the wrong spirit." Because the right spirit will correct the wrong doctrine. &gt;&gt; Let's put our focus back to the word, back to manifesting the life of Christ in us. and let's go be Jesus to someone, to somebody. Our prophet said, "Who's going to reach your community, your people, where you go every day?" We got to do it. Let's bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, my heart is heavy. father all the distractions of this world trying to figure this and that and this and that out and then squandering the main thing which is the saving of souls. You spoke in that day at Calvary and you said the greater works is the saving of souls. That's what you put us here for Lord Jesus. freely give and so freely give. Time and time again, we can look throughout the Bible and see the main thing, the main theme was never about miracles. It was never about signs and wonders. It was always about restoring sons and daughters. Since the beginning, we saw the example in Adam restoring Eve, a perfect type of Jesus. Father, it's always been about the saving of souls. Lord, I ask forgiveness for myself for squandering my responsibility and getting distracted. Lord, I pray the fire you lit in me in the beginning. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; light it once more. Let it burn twice as much as it did the first time. Lord, I've got so much I want to do for you, Lord, but I wanted to move past want to do. And as our pastor said, just do it. Move into the action. Let the uncction of the spirit lead us and guide us. Lord Jesus, your children have come into your house, Lord. Father, if there's anyone here that says, "Brother Ben, I want to be Jesus to somebody." That's what my commission is, to be Jesus to somebody. And And I've gotten distracted, too. I've swayed away. You know, I I I haven't really done a good job of covering one another. I've gossiped a lot. I shared too much when I should have when I should have killed it when it got to me. If you could be honest with yourself, my eyes are closed. I can't see. I don't want to see. But if you lift your hands to him and you say, "Brother Ben, I need him to come back in my life." Make aresh in me his life. If that's your honest desire, lift up your hands. Lord, you see the hands that are raised in the building. I don't see it. You never asked for me to see it. It's your business, Lord. You see the honest hearts. It's in moments like these our prophet would say, a voice would speak to you and say, "Don't raise your hand. Somebody might see that you have need." But then God would come and say, "How how else will I know if you don't lift your hands?" Though he knoweth all things, he loves to see action. If there's a voice speaking to you saying, "I can't lift my hands and let them know, you know, I'm a minister. If if my hands are lifted, then what are they going to think of me?" The hour is too far gone to care about status. &gt;&gt; We need true surrendered hearts, true soldiers aligned with the word, with one job in one accord to save souls. Let's tear down our prestige. We have none but thee. We're all equal in your eyes, Lord Jesus. Father, if anyone needs you, it's me, Lord. I need you. I need to be more like you, Father. I need to keep your name on my lips more, Lord Jesus. It's not good enough that only those in church know what I believe, Father. But I ought to be able to speak your word to all those that I see. If I see a need to be able to minister to the need, Lord, I don't want to miss another opportunity, Lord, though it be physical blindness or a spiritual blindness. I don't want to miss an opportunity to open someone's eyes, Lord Jesus, by showing him you, Lord. If I could be the vessel you use to transmit healing, Lord, deliverance, whatever you desire, Lord, I I'm just a vessel. You use how you see fit, Father. But if all I do is just share the good news of Jesus, Father, I want to faithfully share the good news of Jesus. If not one miracle ever comes of me, Father, Lord, I pray that I I could be faithfully found in sharing you, Lord. We need you in this hour. Lord, touch your people. Father, &gt;&gt; be with each and every single one of us, Lord. We ask this in Jesus precious name. Amen. Invite our our pastor. Let's sing this song. Can you help me sing? &gt;&gt; I really want to see [Music] The more I see this world, the less it means to me. [Music] I really want to see Amen. You know, to be Jesus to somebody, we we need to be Jesus for ourselves, you know, and pray one for another. And so, I'd like you to be Jesus for me and pray for me because I have a bad ankle and a bad knee. And I'd like the some of the brothers to come maybe then and and pray for me. I'd like to get well and uh and any other needs that anybody has that you'd like the Lord to do something. Let's be let's be the Lord Jesus to one another. Amen. And minister one to another and lift one another up and believe that God can do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think. Whatever your need is. But uh if if the brothers would come and and and pray for me and then uh uh anybody else would like to be prayed for, we'll just pray for you and let's be Jesus one to another and and and whatever we have need of just overcome and have loved [Music] You don't just show up.
