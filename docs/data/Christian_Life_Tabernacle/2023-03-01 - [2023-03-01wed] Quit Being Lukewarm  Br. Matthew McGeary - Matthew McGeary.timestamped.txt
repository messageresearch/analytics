[47:23] way that we would be able to Worship You
[47:24] Lord in spirit and in truth and to know
[47:27] that our meeting is not in vain for Lord
[47:30] there's people that have gathered all
[47:32] over the face of this nation who are
[47:34] worshiping but we know Lord we've been
[47:37] properly taught that they worship in
[47:39] vain oh God but we're so thankful for
[47:42] the Revelation that you have given us in
[47:44] the evening time Lord that has exposed
[47:47] the Son of Perdition and has revealed
[47:49] the son of man to your bride how we
[47:51] Rejoice how we thank you for this great
[47:54] message how we thank you for this great
[47:57] light Lord without it where would we be
[47:59] we would be so miserable we would be so
[48:02] lost Lord we would too be worshiping in
[48:05] vain Lord but you saw fit to write our
[48:07] name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you
[48:09] send a message Lord to call us out of
[48:12] the chaos Lord and to set us upon the
[48:14] sure word of Revelation in this hour
[48:16] that we can be changed that we can be
[48:19] quickened that we can be born again Lord
[48:22] that we can go into a Rapture oh God
[48:25] we're so thankful tonight we give you
[48:28] all the praise and give you all the
[48:30] glory and all the Adoration Lord for you
[48:33] are most Worthy you're worthy Lord God
[48:36] we just take a moment to tell you that
[48:38] we love you Lord we thank you we rejoice
[48:41] in what you're doing in this hour in
[48:44] this moment in this time lord we
[48:46] surrender ourselves to you Lord just
[48:48] pray that you'd come and break the bread
[48:49] of life as only you can Lord we commit
[48:52] the people to you pray that you anoint
[48:54] their ears that they might hear Lord
[48:55] move me aside I pray be with those that
[48:58] are unable to be here nor those that are
[49:00] sick and body may you be their portion
[49:02] pray and ask all these things in your
[49:04] most wonderful name the Lord Jesus
[49:05] Christ amen praise this wonderful name
[49:09] let's just turn in our Bibles to Matthew
[49:11] chapter 16 and we'll also be reading out
[49:14] of Hebrews chapter 5.
[49:17] it looks like there's a little sickness
[49:19] that's been going around so if you just
[49:22] look out and you see somebody that's not
[49:25] here just remember them in prayer
[49:26] there's there's ones that I'm looking to
[49:28] see in the house of God and ones that
[49:31] aren't here because of maybe a physical
[49:33] ailment but maybe a spiritual ailment I
[49:35] think we ought to bind and gather bind
[49:37] together by faith and in prayer and
[49:40] start to Envision that one sitting there
[49:42] in that seat and I believe that that
[49:45] will come to fruition amen I don't
[49:47] believe that uh when we say these things
[49:51] or We join together that it's in vain
[49:53] but I believe God honors
[49:55] he honors the prayer of a righteous man
[49:58] a veileth much and if it's according to
[50:00] the word then what hindereth amen let's
[50:02] just read out of Matthew chapter 16 and
[50:04] just uh verse 2 and 4 will try to by
[50:07] God's help to uh just move a in a
[50:10] certain direction uh the scripture would
[50:13] read like this he answered and said on
[50:15] them when it is evening you say it will
[50:16] be fair weather for the sky is red and
[50:19] in the morning it will be foul weather
[50:21] today for the sky is red and lowering oh
[50:24] ye Hypocrites you can discern the face
[50:27] of the sky
[50:29] but can you not discern the signs of the
[50:32] times a wicked and adulterous generation
[50:35] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[50:38] sign be given unto it but the sign of
[50:40] the Prophet Jonas and he left them and
[50:43] departed and also out of Hebrews chapter
[50:45] 5.
[50:49] verse 12-14
[51:05] for when the time you ought to be
[51:07] teachers
[51:09] ye have need that one teach you again
[51:12] which be the first principles of the
[51:14] Oracles of God and are become such as
[51:17] have need of milk
[51:19] and not strong meat
[51:22] for everyone that useth milk is
[51:24] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[51:26] for he is a babe
[51:28] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[51:31] are of full age
[51:33] even those who by a reason of use have
[51:36] their senses exercised to discern
[51:39] both good and evil we just ask a
[51:42] blessing upon the word you may be seated
[51:44] and just reading that last portion of
[51:46] scripture it says but strong meat
[51:48] belongeth to them that are of full age
[51:50] even those by reason of use have their
[51:53] senses exercised to discern
[51:57] both Good and Evil so to know what's
[52:01] right and wrong by discernment we ought
[52:05] to be a church that's of full age that
[52:08] we mature that there is a discernment
[52:10] that we have to to be able to know what
[52:14] is right and what is wrong and this look
[52:17] this this goes beyond just a a
[52:20] Discerning between what is out there in
[52:22] the world and knowing all the things of
[52:25] the God of this evil age and all of
[52:27] these things are evil out there and and
[52:29] God has called me out of those things
[52:30] and I recognize
[52:32] um uh that those things are wrong and
[52:35] and now that I've I've turned my heart
[52:37] towards the Lord and I know these things
[52:39] are right but it it as you mature in the
[52:42] Lord it comes down to where it keeps
[52:44] finding and honing down to where you're
[52:46] Discerning between what is right and
[52:48] wrong and I want to say it like this uh
[52:50] the wrong is not always sin it's not
[52:53] always that it would be something uh
[52:55] that we were wrong according to the law
[52:57] but it is is it right for you to do is
[53:00] at the right season is it the right time
[53:02] is it the right attitude is it the right
[53:04] way to go about it see you know brother
[53:06] Branham even preaches a sermon about
[53:08] trying to do a god of service and it not
[53:11] being his will it was if you would say a
[53:13] right thing to do it you want to preach
[53:15] you want to you want to go out you want
[53:17] to restore a fallen brother there's
[53:19] something you want to do but but you
[53:20] know the way you go about it might not
[53:22] be so much be right so there there
[53:24] there's a way of maturity to the
[53:27] believer where we come to a place where
[53:29] we start to have a discernment about us
[53:32] just even the way we talk to somebody or
[53:34] the way we approach them or the way that
[53:37] you witness you know it takes it takes a
[53:39] little bit of time you know you you get
[53:41] on fire for God and you've been set free
[53:43] and and you're zealous and you're going
[53:45] around and after you know after a little
[53:47] while the Lord gives you a little bit
[53:48] more discernment on how to properly
[53:51] approach people and not offend them
[53:52] because there's times oh I've offended a
[53:54] lot of people and you forgive me I'm
[53:56] still doing it I'm trying to learn I I
[53:58] want to have more to discernment because
[54:00] you you want to share something on your
[54:02] heart and it's right and and it's the
[54:04] word of the Lord and and the person
[54:06] needs correction and it's the word and
[54:09] you see it there and it's plain to you
[54:10] it's just as as black and white and so
[54:13] you come to them and you share it on
[54:14] your heart and you find out you got the
[54:16] wrong response you got the wrong
[54:18] reaction because maybe it wasn't done in
[54:20] love you see it wasn't necessarily that
[54:22] it was wrong but it wasn't right
[54:25] and I believe we're coming to a place of
[54:27] maturity where we're growing where we're
[54:29] able to know what is right and what is
[54:32] wrong by discernment and I just want a
[54:34] little take a little bit of time and
[54:35] just reading through some quotes and
[54:36] we'll just see how the uh uh the Lord
[54:39] would just lead us but I want to take
[54:40] out of the church age book the prophet
[54:43] of God would say this he said now
[54:45] remember this
[54:46] Christ in the true church
[54:49] is a continuation of the book of Acts my
[54:53] I I just I I just love the the word of
[54:56] God it's like a seed every word and
[54:58] every sentence it's a seed if it just
[55:01] blossoms forth with Revelation by The
[55:03] Spirit Well we can just stay right there
[55:05] preaching on that we want to move a
[55:07] little bit further along but Christ in
[55:10] the true church is a continuation of the
[55:12] book of Acts read in the book of Acts
[55:15] Christ is continuing the same acts in
[55:18] The Bride of Jesus Christ in this day
[55:20] when the devil tries to say well that
[55:22] was a day gone by or or well that was
[55:25] just in the apostolic days it's really
[55:27] not like that and he tries to read no we
[55:30] believe the word
[55:32] we we believe for the same signs the
[55:34] same wonders for blind eyes to be open
[55:37] uh for for those like at the gate called
[55:39] Beautiful silver and gold high by none
[55:41] but rise up and walk I I am not going to
[55:44] settle for anything short but the full
[55:47] word of God and manifestation in my life
[55:50] I'm not going to settle for reasoning
[55:52] I'm not going to settle for doubt but if
[55:54] the prophet said it I believe it I'm
[55:56] going to discern between right and wrong
[55:58] and I know the word is right and
[56:01] everything the devil has said is alive
[56:04] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[56:07] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[56:08] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[56:13] if you want to know what the Antichrist
[56:15] spirit is trying to do in your life
[56:17] trying to do in this church
[56:22] it is trying to make you lukewarm
[56:25] formal and Powerless
[56:28] that's his whole goal is to make you
[56:32] lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes
[56:35] Satan revealing his Works attempted
[56:38] destruction of God's people and the
[56:40] discrediting of God's word right down to
[56:43] the time he has cashed into the Lake of
[56:44] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[56:48] you want to know something the devil
[56:50] cannot stand he cannot stand this little
[56:53] gathering that's taking place in Bedford
[56:55] Texas because we have not gathered
[56:57] according to man's Wisdom we have not
[56:59] gathered according to not to
[57:01] denominations but we have gathered under
[57:03] the revealed word of the hour not
[57:06] something that man has done but
[57:08] something that God has ordained and
[57:10] manifested in this age to you and the
[57:13] devil hates it he can't stand it because
[57:16] when you get a revelation of what God
[57:18] has done in this age then he is
[57:20] powerless before you
[57:22] it's been proven I'll go on record the
[57:25] devil will devil is powerless before the
[57:28] prophet William Branham powerless
[57:31] oh you you think you can go and say well
[57:33] not this time not over here not uh this
[57:36] the prophet that the prophet only did
[57:40] what was revealed to him to do and then
[57:41] as a man though he learned obedience by
[57:44] the things he suffered certainly he
[57:46] didn't always make the right decision
[57:48] but it was an example unto us showing
[57:50] how Christ had come the angel of the
[57:53] Lord had appeared unto the prophet and
[57:55] was going to lead and guide him into his
[57:57] position and his place as the prophet to
[58:01] the age
[58:02] and he taught him how to discern between
[58:05] right and wrong is that right look the
[58:07] prophet learned many hard things and I
[58:10] say it would behoove us to be a student
[58:11] of the message I I've heard it said that
[58:14] a a a smart man learns from his mistakes
[58:16] but a wise man learns from others you
[58:19] know you you can get a lot of life
[58:21] lessons and eternal lessons by studying
[58:24] the life of William Branham and find out
[58:26] where he made mistakes and find out
[58:28] where the Lord was leading him to do
[58:29] something and he was drawn away a
[58:31] Minister's pulling on him this way and
[58:33] that way and things were said and he
[58:35] didn't make the right choice and he had
[58:37] to pay the penalty for that we are not
[58:40] exempt from that as children of God
[58:42] those I love I rebuke and chasten he's
[58:44] bringing us into a place of maturity to
[58:47] be able to discern between right and
[58:49] wrong
[58:50] because we are we have the power of the
[58:54] spoken word but we need to have the mind
[58:56] of Christ to know what to do with it
[58:59] amen
[59:01] he cannot stand it he knows that if
[59:04] the people get the true revelation of
[59:06] the true church
[59:08] and what she is what she stands for and
[59:12] that she can do the Greater Works she
[59:14] will be an invincible Army
[59:18] well I should read that again
[59:24] last time I checked he was talking about
[59:27] you
[59:29] I mean he's not talking about the church
[59:31] down the road
[59:32] he's not talking about somebody else
[59:34] this message is to you
[59:41] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[59:44] an invincible Army I am not looking
[59:46] church for something in the future
[59:51] everything we have need of has been
[59:53] given to the Bride of Jesus Christ there
[59:57] I am not looking for a squeeze I am not
[59:59] looking for some future Revelation but
[1:00:02] if we have come in a union to Jesus
[1:00:05] Christ the word then we have everything
[1:00:07] we have need of to produce everything
[1:00:10] that has been spoken concerning you
[1:00:14] now I just want to focus here uh By
[1:00:16] God's help if they get a true revelation
[1:00:19] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:00:23] of the Christian church
[1:00:26] and by God's spirit discern
[1:00:30] and withstand the Antichrist Spirit
[1:00:33] Satan will be powerless
[1:00:36] before her
[1:00:38] now notice what he says by God's spirit
[1:00:44] and we could really labor on on breaking
[1:00:48] these sentences down and talking about
[1:00:50] the spirits within the framework of the
[1:00:53] Christian church but I'm just maybe just
[1:00:55] start for a foundation I would like to
[1:00:57] just talk to you about by God's spirit
[1:01:01] it has to be by God's spirit that we
[1:01:04] discern and withstand
[1:01:06] and and maybe just uh we'll just see if
[1:01:09] God would piece This Together by his
[1:01:10] grace but Brother David said something I
[1:01:13] believe Sunday night that just struck me
[1:01:15] and and and he said quit being lukewarm
[1:01:20] and that'll be my title tonight
[1:01:23] quit being lukewarm
[1:01:27] if we're gonna buy God's spirit discern
[1:01:31] and withstand
[1:01:33] we got to stop being lukewarm Church
[1:01:36] you think we can just dip in and out
[1:01:39] and then have the right answer and the
[1:01:41] right discernment just
[1:01:43] I just kind of rubbed shoulders with the
[1:01:46] world and I kind of just go this way and
[1:01:48] that way and all of a sudden when you
[1:01:49] come up to a problem
[1:01:51] it doesn't work like that
[1:01:54] but I believe that there's a life for
[1:01:56] the believer
[1:01:57] a life that's that's hidden Christ
[1:02:00] that that's that's behind the veil
[1:02:04] where you've come into a union and
[1:02:06] you're in the Shekinah Glory and there's
[1:02:08] an atmosphere about you and as you walk
[1:02:11] with him he he's talking to you and he's
[1:02:14] leading you and he's guiding you as the
[1:02:16] prophet would come into his home and and
[1:02:18] there's the children fussing and it
[1:02:19] seems the wife is frustrated there was
[1:02:22] something he was in communion with that
[1:02:24] was saved just put on the apron
[1:02:27] he didn't come in there say honey what
[1:02:29] is this all about huh I had a hard day
[1:02:31] at work people have been throwing it
[1:02:32] after me all day long they want my
[1:02:34] counseling they want this and that and
[1:02:36] and I'm just totally wore out and this
[1:02:38] is supposed to be a Haven arrest for me
[1:02:40] and lo and behold I come home to the
[1:02:42] home the kids are fussing you haven't
[1:02:44] even made dinner what is going on right
[1:02:46] what kind of house is this
[1:02:50] no
[1:02:51] no he he recognized I'm a creator
[1:02:55] I have the power
[1:02:58] you know my the other day my my you know
[1:03:01] just been a few days and and I just
[1:03:03] share my heart you know my something
[1:03:04] there there was a an infirmity in my in
[1:03:07] my wife's body and she just uh you know
[1:03:09] you just hear it and you say honey yes I
[1:03:12] pray for you and this you know and then
[1:03:13] the next day and then something just
[1:03:15] rose up on me on the third day you're
[1:03:16] like I'm sick and tired of this this
[1:03:18] thing
[1:03:19] I I have a right
[1:03:22] to go take my wife and lay hands on her
[1:03:24] and tell that Old Devil you ain't gotta
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:27] to be here any long I'm claiming my wife
[1:03:30] I'm claiming her health and something
[1:03:31] rose up within me I got tired of that
[1:03:34] thing and now I've staked it upon the
[1:03:36] word of God and if the devil tries to
[1:03:38] Puck his head up again I just chop it
[1:03:40] off with the word of God no it's settled
[1:03:42] once and for all I've laid it there off
[1:03:44] the altar I've claimed the word of God
[1:03:46] it's settled it's all over devil you've
[1:03:48] been defeated you can stand right there
[1:03:51] see as a Creator one that's Discerning
[1:03:53] between right and wrong there he could
[1:03:55] come into the home and say oh put on the
[1:03:58] April say oh honey let me just help you
[1:04:00] with the dishes
[1:04:01] and what did he do oh I mean we all want
[1:04:04] some big great thing to do
[1:04:06] we want to start some Big Revival and
[1:04:09] and we want to run off over here and run
[1:04:11] off over there we can't even create an
[1:04:12] atmosphere in our home
[1:04:14] we can't even bring the presence of God
[1:04:16] into our bedroom what's wrong with this
[1:04:17] church come on we we we hey all that I
[1:04:20] love I review can chase I believe it's
[1:04:22] time some of us get chasing I see God
[1:04:24] forgive me we want to do all these
[1:04:26] things we want to defeat the Devil we're
[1:04:28] going to be an invincible Army where's
[1:04:30] the presence of God in your own home
[1:04:31] where's the presence of God in your car
[1:04:34] you keep tuning into that Christian
[1:04:36] radio and you think the presence of God
[1:04:38] is going to abide in that car with that
[1:04:39] nonsense that's garbage
[1:04:42] the Bride of Jesus Christ has no
[1:04:45] business
[1:04:45] listening to that denominational Tommy
[1:04:48] rot
[1:04:49] oh yeah you've heard it over here over
[1:04:51] this Pulpit yes sir I believe there's
[1:04:53] something far greater
[1:04:55] I remember my brother David when he
[1:04:57] first got converted do you want to know
[1:04:58] the only music he listened to
[1:05:01] was the prophet of God singing hymns
[1:05:04] because you know what he could be sure
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:07] there wasn't no leaven in that
[1:05:10] nope
[1:05:12] no you go by my brother David the only
[1:05:14] thing you is listen you could just hear
[1:05:15] the prophet of God just singing he had
[1:05:17] somebody had compiled a whole track and
[1:05:18] it was just nothing but brother random
[1:05:20] singing hymns and singing songs you know
[1:05:22] what I like that I'll take sides with
[1:05:24] that
[1:05:25] I'll take sides with that every day I'd
[1:05:27] rather lean way that way
[1:05:29] then some of this stuff way off on the
[1:05:31] other side with your rock and roll
[1:05:33] boogie woogie
[1:05:35] well however we got over here I think
[1:05:37] it's all right well because we need to
[1:05:38] have a spirit to discern the traps of
[1:05:41] the devil
[1:05:43] what has happened to us I think it's
[1:05:45] because we're not living in the presence
[1:05:47] of God we're not living in the position
[1:05:49] that God has created for the believer to
[1:05:52] be our creator to create an atmosphere
[1:05:54] to change a situation I tell you when
[1:05:57] I'm living close to God and I go into a
[1:06:00] restaurant and I hear all that music and
[1:06:02] stuff you know you get a little bit of
[1:06:04] nervous
[1:06:06] hey
[1:06:07] I'm I'm hey I'm preaching to myself
[1:06:09] right now I'm doing two and two I ain't
[1:06:11] felt that way in a little bit so that
[1:06:12] you know what that means hey I need to
[1:06:14] get back into that place back into that
[1:06:17] Shekinah Glory shut away from all the
[1:06:19] things of the world that when you walk
[1:06:20] into a place it's unnerving
[1:06:24] does anybody know what I'm talking about
[1:06:26] you you've been in prayer and you've
[1:06:29] been experiencing the presence of God
[1:06:30] and then you go out into the marketplace
[1:06:32] you go to Walmart and I'll send you like
[1:06:34] dude I don't even belong here
[1:06:37] you just don't even feel right being in
[1:06:39] there but then something's in your heart
[1:06:40] and you start to have compassion
[1:06:43] friends we ought to be looking out at
[1:06:45] this dying generation and say oh God is
[1:06:47] there something I could say to them
[1:06:51] you know there's people that are sending
[1:06:54] up smoke signals all around you that are
[1:06:56] asking for help
[1:07:01] try it one day just walk up to say hey I
[1:07:03] just want to ask a question
[1:07:04] would you like to be delivered of those
[1:07:08] you'll find out nine out of ten
[1:07:12] they don't want to smoke
[1:07:15] they've all tried and they pick it back
[1:07:18] it's expensive
[1:07:19] I was at the store the other day and
[1:07:21] some person said give me a pack of that
[1:07:22] or something like it was like 10 bucks
[1:07:24] or something like man
[1:07:26] that Demon's really whipping people
[1:07:27] nowadays
[1:07:30] it's expensive
[1:07:33] but we ought to come into a place where
[1:07:35] we're Discerning between right and wrong
[1:07:37] we're we're there there's something
[1:07:39] about us that's different we can create
[1:07:41] an atmosphere we can approach people out
[1:07:43] of love
[1:07:44] when you do something in La out of love
[1:07:46] brother it changes everything
[1:07:48] not to satisfy some religious duty if
[1:07:51] you walk up to somebody and say well do
[1:07:53] you want to be delivered that's not
[1:07:54] going to do anything
[1:07:56] but if there is a genuine love in your
[1:07:59] heart for the individual that wants to
[1:08:02] see them delivered they will know the
[1:08:05] difference
[1:08:07] that's why Christians get a such a bad
[1:08:09] name they call them Bible Thumpers
[1:08:11] because they're just trying to fulfill a
[1:08:13] religious Duty
[1:08:15] I went out there today and I tried to
[1:08:18] Bonk this guy over the head and bonk
[1:08:19] this guy over there but when you come to
[1:08:21] somebody with love and have discernment
[1:08:23] and you can start talking to them about
[1:08:25] the weather and things that are going
[1:08:27] you see they're wearing a Cowboys jersey
[1:08:29] and say oh I see you're a Cowboys fan
[1:08:31] huh what are you thinking about that and
[1:08:33] oh friends you do it long enough you you
[1:08:36] look for the doors see God always opens
[1:08:39] the door
[1:08:40] you look for that door you look for that
[1:08:42] key when they when they say the right
[1:08:43] thing and all of a sudden you're like oh
[1:08:45] man
[1:08:46] I tell you what I I used to get all
[1:08:48] emotional upset but then God changed my
[1:08:50] life uh with those things and you'll
[1:08:53] find out with the right approach you can
[1:08:55] communicate with somebody and what was
[1:08:57] the prophet doing every time as Jesus
[1:08:59] came to the the woman at the well what
[1:09:01] was he doing he was catching her spirit
[1:09:04] the prophet of God would say when he
[1:09:06] would speak to some people what was he
[1:09:08] doing he was catching their Spirit
[1:09:10] friends I want to tell you you too can
[1:09:12] catch somebody's spirit
[1:09:16] look this is not limited to a prophet
[1:09:20] it is none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ residing in you
[1:09:25] then if that same spirit that was in
[1:09:27] Christ Living you it will Quicken your
[1:09:30] mortal body it will Quicken your mouth
[1:09:32] it will Quicken your language it will
[1:09:34] Quicken your thinking it will Quicken
[1:09:37] your discernment
[1:09:39] to be able to discern between right and
[1:09:42] wrong when to speak when not to speak
[1:09:44] you have thus saith the Lord or we stand
[1:09:47] still see there's a maturity that we're
[1:09:49] talking about so by God's spirit
[1:09:52] we discern and we stand
[1:09:57] and once again simply put
[1:10:00] we can start making some great strides
[1:10:04] if we quit being lukewarm
[1:10:07] we're led by the spirit we're sealed by
[1:10:09] the spirit
[1:10:11] we're quickened by the spirit
[1:10:14] everything's by the spirit
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:20] that's what Paul would say as many as
[1:10:21] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:10:23] the sons of God just moving a little bit
[1:10:26] further the prophet said if we ever get
[1:10:27] the true Revelation right we ever get a
[1:10:30] true revelation of anything what is it
[1:10:32] going to be by
[1:10:35] it's going to be by the spirit
[1:10:37] so just reading this quote a little bit
[1:10:39] further maybe they're just mixed up we
[1:10:41] just uh in our preparation I just tried
[1:10:44] to pull a few things that that God would
[1:10:46] lay in our heart this was also out of
[1:10:47] the church age book he says if
[1:10:49] Revelation is beyond you
[1:10:53] look up and seek God for it
[1:10:59] if Revelation is beyond you look friends
[1:11:02] there's a lot of Revelation that is
[1:11:03] beyond us
[1:11:05] if you think for one second we've
[1:11:07] arrived
[1:11:08] we got problems
[1:11:11] we we have not begun to scratch the
[1:11:14] surface
[1:11:15] oh
[1:11:17] we'll start When We Get Over Yonder
[1:11:20] but right now we're just getting a
[1:11:22] glimpse
[1:11:22] we're just getting in Earnest we're just
[1:11:24] catching a little bit because it's going
[1:11:26] to take all eternity
[1:11:28] for this to unfold
[1:11:30] if Revelation is beyond you look up and
[1:11:33] seek God for it
[1:11:35] that is the only way
[1:11:38] you are ever going to get it
[1:11:45] I want to take my time on some of these
[1:11:47] things because
[1:11:48] God forbid we've become good
[1:11:50] denominationals
[1:11:52] we've become good religious people we
[1:11:55] we've become good at recognizing a quote
[1:11:58] we've been good at just nodding our head
[1:12:01] to it but if something can speak to our
[1:12:04] heart
[1:12:06] and we can realize that
[1:12:09] I desire more revelation
[1:12:13] I I desire the strong meat of the word
[1:12:17] I desire to be able to discern between
[1:12:20] what is right and what is wrong
[1:12:24] he says that is the only way you are
[1:12:26] ever going to get a revelation has to
[1:12:29] come from God
[1:12:33] it never comes by human natural
[1:12:35] endowments
[1:12:36] but by spiritual endowment you can
[1:12:40] endume it you can never even memorize
[1:12:44] the scripture oh my watch this now
[1:12:47] you can even memorize the scripture and
[1:12:50] though that is wonderful
[1:12:52] that won't do it
[1:12:54] it has to be a revelation from God
[1:12:58] it says in the word that no man can say
[1:13:01] that Jesus
[1:13:03] is the Christ
[1:13:05] except by the Holy Ghost
[1:13:11] now pay attention here
[1:13:13] you have to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] and then
[1:13:21] and only then
[1:13:25] can the spirit give you the Revelation
[1:13:29] that Jesus is the Christ
[1:13:34] oh
[1:13:36] you have to receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:38] then
[1:13:39] and only then can the spirit give you
[1:13:41] the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ
[1:13:44] now I want to move a little bit further
[1:13:46] and and Satan is going to be right there
[1:13:49] to condemn you
[1:13:51] we want to rebuke the devil because
[1:13:54] we all being predestinated seeds are in
[1:13:57] a journey
[1:13:58] the prophet were not born a man
[1:14:01] we're born a baby we go through a
[1:14:03] process but the devil is really good on
[1:14:06] condemning
[1:14:08] people who are in the process
[1:14:12] of the holy ghost moving in their life
[1:14:16] and bringing them through the process
[1:14:19] whether you're in justification
[1:14:21] sanctification you've been filled with
[1:14:23] the Holy Ghost look we have all the
[1:14:25] types in the Old Testament what Crossing
[1:14:27] Jordan into the promised land is a type
[1:14:30] of receiving the Holy Ghost but they
[1:14:33] really didn't
[1:14:34] really have much
[1:14:36] they had to go possess it
[1:14:40] they had crossed over so when you get
[1:14:42] the Holy Ghost I mean you're just
[1:14:45] getting started
[1:14:46] you're just beginning the battle
[1:14:49] you're just getting going so there's not
[1:14:52] this hey look they're still in the
[1:14:54] wilderness as we've dramatized before
[1:14:56] could you imagine them all you know the
[1:14:58] Levites step in there and and the Waters
[1:15:00] of the Jordans separate and and
[1:15:02] everybody's crossing over and they're
[1:15:03] all uh Onward Christian Soldiers and
[1:15:06] they're marching across could you
[1:15:07] imagine a group of people over in the
[1:15:09] promised land looking back at the people
[1:15:10] in line look at those guys they're still
[1:15:12] in the wilderness
[1:15:13] can you believe them backsliders give
[1:15:16] them a chance
[1:15:17] give him a chance
[1:15:19] we have people in different stages and
[1:15:22] different walks
[1:15:24] he says you have to receive the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost then and only then can the spirit
[1:15:27] give you the Revelation that Jesus is
[1:15:29] the Christ
[1:15:31] God the anointed when no man knows the
[1:15:34] things of God save the spirit of God and
[1:15:36] He To Whom the spirit of God reveals
[1:15:39] them
[1:15:40] now
[1:15:41] if we can just hold this in our thinking
[1:15:44] we need to call on God
[1:15:48] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:15:52] in the world
[1:15:56] we have accepted the Bible
[1:15:59] we have accepted the truths of it if I
[1:16:03] can say it like this we have accepted
[1:16:05] the message of the hour we have accepted
[1:16:08] Malachi 4 5. we have accepted the
[1:16:12] fundamental truth that has been given to
[1:16:14] us by the messenger of the age
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:22] but it's still
[1:16:25] is not real
[1:16:27] to most people because the Revelation by
[1:16:32] the spirit is not there
[1:16:36] now I want to labor there for a moment
[1:16:40] because
[1:16:42] the prophet is telling us
[1:16:44] that we need to pray for revelation
[1:16:48] more than anything we ever prayed for is
[1:16:51] revelation
[1:16:53] because we can believe the Bible
[1:16:56] we can believe the message
[1:16:58] we can believe the truth we can believe
[1:17:01] the doctrines of it we can believe
[1:17:03] serpent seed we can believe water
[1:17:05] baptism oh yes we can believe all of
[1:17:08] those don't you know that the womb to
[1:17:10] the spirit is the mind you accept those
[1:17:13] things into your mind you believe those
[1:17:15] things you even perceive them you see
[1:17:17] how it line up but there is a further
[1:17:19] unfolding he says but it's still not
[1:17:21] real to most people because the
[1:17:24] Revelation by the spirit is not there
[1:17:27] the word has not been quickened
[1:17:32] so what did he say if Revelation is
[1:17:34] beyond you
[1:17:36] seek God for it
[1:17:39] I I really want to challenge us this
[1:17:42] evening on seeking God for revelation
[1:17:45] when did we ever get to the place where
[1:17:48] we've become satisfied
[1:17:50] with a knowledge and an understanding in
[1:17:53] our group Gatherings that we haven't
[1:17:55] come to a place where we're getting
[1:17:57] desperate before God and crying I say oh
[1:18:01] God Reveal Your word to me oh it's a
[1:18:04] storehouse of the riches of glory and if
[1:18:07] you'll get on your face before God said
[1:18:09] oh God I want more Revelation I'm
[1:18:12] seeking for more revelation God unveil
[1:18:15] your word to me
[1:18:17] and then watch by the spirit he will
[1:18:20] Quicken the word and it will become real
[1:18:25] you know you think about when people
[1:18:27] really want something
[1:18:30] you know they a lot of people you know
[1:18:32] they really want something
[1:18:34] some people do some crazy stuff
[1:18:38] you know they might they might uh uh
[1:18:41] sacrifice time or money or they'll save
[1:18:43] all their money they'll quit doing other
[1:18:45] things because oh man I really want to
[1:18:47] go on to this trip I I really want to go
[1:18:49] overseas and they stop doing this and
[1:18:52] they save up all their money and and why
[1:18:54] because they really want something
[1:18:56] I'll tell you something that's really
[1:18:57] profound watch two people fall in love
[1:19:00] and they they just you know especially
[1:19:02] long distance relationship
[1:19:03] I know what I'm talking about
[1:19:06] oh you just want to be with them you
[1:19:07] just want to talk to them you know
[1:19:09] you're at the Gathering or something
[1:19:10] like that you're like we're selling so
[1:19:12] they're off in a corner on their phone
[1:19:13] because the only thing they care about
[1:19:14] is talking to their sweetheart they just
[1:19:16] want to be together you can't live
[1:19:17] without them so you're do you're doing
[1:19:19] whatever you're making a sacrifice you
[1:19:21] you quit going over here or going on
[1:19:23] trips over there and you start saving up
[1:19:25] your money you start saving up for the
[1:19:26] wedding you start doing all these things
[1:19:28] because something means more to you than
[1:19:30] everything else
[1:19:32] there's one thing on your mind and one
[1:19:35] thing alone oh like that that little
[1:19:37] girl on the ranch when when all the
[1:19:39] denominational sisters were mocking her
[1:19:42] and making score but what was she doing
[1:19:43] she was making herself ready because
[1:19:45] there was only one thing that mattered
[1:19:47] to her she said no he told me he gave me
[1:19:50] his word he put the wedding a band of
[1:19:53] predestination on my finger and he told
[1:19:55] me he's coming back for me and that's
[1:19:58] the only thing that matters I'm an
[1:20:00] abdressed right I'm gonna live right I'm
[1:20:03] gonna act right I don't care about
[1:20:04] everything else that's going on there's
[1:20:06] only one thing that means anything to me
[1:20:08] and that's the bridegroom
[1:20:12] and and they start to focus and there's
[1:20:14] only one thing
[1:20:16] that has their their hopes and their
[1:20:18] dreams and everything occupied is that
[1:20:21] one goal and they sacrifice they plan uh
[1:20:24] they tell people they testify they put
[1:20:27] in their two-week notice at work because
[1:20:29] everything is going to be history
[1:20:31] they're just looking for that one thing
[1:20:35] well friends
[1:20:37] it's time we do that for our Lord
[1:20:40] I tell you he's worthy of it
[1:20:44] he's worthy of every minute
[1:20:46] he's worthy of every second he's worthy
[1:20:48] of the honor he's worthy of the glory
[1:20:51] he's worthy of your time he's worthy of
[1:20:54] your attention he's worthy of you making
[1:20:57] the sacrifice he's worthy of you
[1:20:59] planning to spend time with oh he's
[1:21:01] worthy of your life if you can get to a
[1:21:04] place of desperation where the only
[1:21:06] thing that matters oh friends I don't
[1:21:09] want to go over there I'm going to skip
[1:21:10] a meal I'm going to do this I'm gonna
[1:21:12] get up early in the morning because all
[1:21:14] I want to do is I want to get away with
[1:21:17] my Lord I want to let the veil drop down
[1:21:19] behind me I want to be in the Shekinah
[1:21:22] Glory I want to feel the presence of God
[1:21:24] I want to feel this spirit I want to be
[1:21:27] in communion
[1:21:30] if you live there
[1:21:33] and come out of that place
[1:21:35] in that atmosphere
[1:21:37] walking in the light
[1:21:39] walking with that type of discernment
[1:21:41] then oh
[1:21:43] you're in tune as our our pastor talked
[1:21:46] about spiritual maintenance
[1:21:48] you got to maintenance things to keep
[1:21:50] them in operating order
[1:21:54] so just moving a little bit further
[1:21:56] just talking about getting desperate for
[1:21:59] revelation
[1:22:00] for those that hunger and thirst after
[1:22:02] righteousness they shall be filled
[1:22:04] so just hold that thought seeking for
[1:22:07] revelation
[1:22:08] because everything else
[1:22:13] is a distraction
[1:22:15] everything else
[1:22:18] is a distraction from you getting this
[1:22:21] revelation
[1:22:23] look all of Satan's Eden
[1:22:26] every everything that is thrown out
[1:22:28] there everything that is trying to draw
[1:22:30] on your attention and your time and to
[1:22:33] attach itself to your flesh is done in
[1:22:36] such a way to demand upon your time your
[1:22:39] tension your energy to keep you from
[1:22:42] putting your your focus on the main
[1:22:45] thing
[1:22:48] revelation
[1:22:51] the prophet of God would go on to say
[1:22:53] this he would say oh
[1:22:54] how we need Revelation by the spirit
[1:22:57] we don't need a new Bible
[1:23:00] we don't need a new translation
[1:23:03] though some are very good
[1:23:05] and I'm not against them but we need the
[1:23:08] revelation of the spirit and thank God
[1:23:12] we can have what we need
[1:23:15] for God wants to reveal his word to us
[1:23:18] by his spirit
[1:23:21] may God Begin by his Spirit to give us
[1:23:24] continuous
[1:23:26] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[1:23:30] now notice how he says
[1:23:34] by his spirit
[1:23:36] to give us continuous life-giving
[1:23:41] Revelation is not a one-time event
[1:23:45] but it's something that's constant it's
[1:23:48] something that is continuous it's
[1:23:51] something that's life-giving or
[1:23:52] quickening
[1:23:54] and it's a prevailing Revelation oh if
[1:23:58] the church
[1:24:00] could only get a fresh revelation
[1:24:04] and become by it the Living Word
[1:24:07] manifested
[1:24:08] we would do the Greater Works and
[1:24:11] glorify God our Father in heaven
[1:24:17] see Satan wants to distract you he wants
[1:24:20] to rob you he wants to confuse you
[1:24:24] he wants to keep you from getting to the
[1:24:27] place of desperation and really catching
[1:24:31] a revelation of what is contained in the
[1:24:34] revelation of those Seven Seals
[1:24:38] and what's really contained in the
[1:24:41] revealing of the son of man
[1:24:45] well I hope that's not too Elementary
[1:24:49] there there is a power
[1:24:52] there is a a quickening power there is a
[1:24:55] continually
[1:24:57] life-giving prevailing Revelation that
[1:25:01] has been opened up to the bride through
[1:25:03] the voice of the seventh angel messenger
[1:25:06] and it's by that voice that your body is
[1:25:10] going to be changed it's by that voice
[1:25:13] oh as Paul said o grave where is your
[1:25:17] Victory O Death where is your sting I
[1:25:19] want to tell you it's going to be by The
[1:25:20] Voice
[1:25:21] of the seventh angel messenger that has
[1:25:24] sounded that is going to give you the
[1:25:26] prevailing Revelation to put death under
[1:25:29] your feet
[1:25:30] it's not going to come by any other way
[1:25:34] than the way that God has ordained it he
[1:25:37] ordained it according to what he
[1:25:39] prophesied here data according to the
[1:25:42] message he ordained it according to the
[1:25:45] Mysteries that have been revealed by the
[1:25:47] seventh angel that is the life
[1:25:50] prevailing giving Revelation that's
[1:25:52] going to take the bride into a body
[1:25:53] change
[1:25:55] and we want to start getting hungry and
[1:25:59] thirsty for more of it
[1:26:04] look you know you ever
[1:26:06] I was thinking of this how the devil
[1:26:09] wants to distract you and he he he's
[1:26:12] just wanting to to to get you distracted
[1:26:15] away from what God has placed you to do
[1:26:17] ever you ever see a cat like stalking a
[1:26:19] bird or something
[1:26:21] yeah Birds just man it's just tweet
[1:26:24] tweet I'm having a good day look at
[1:26:26] these seeds over here I'm playing with
[1:26:27] my friends and little does he know all
[1:26:30] along
[1:26:33] I mean slow you know it almost looks
[1:26:36] like he's not even moving
[1:26:37] you like watch them like is he moving
[1:26:40] easy moving watch him long enough and
[1:26:43] all of a sudden you're like he's closed
[1:26:45] in 10 feet
[1:26:46] and that bird doesn't even know what's
[1:26:48] about to hit him
[1:26:49] you know the devil is doing the same
[1:26:51] thing to your life
[1:26:53] he's watching you well
[1:26:55] they just had a good service maybe maybe
[1:26:57] I'm going to keep stalking him a little
[1:26:58] bit
[1:26:59] I'm gonna follow him a little bit
[1:27:01] they had a good day at work
[1:27:03] okay and he's he's getting closer and
[1:27:06] closer and all sudden you get home the
[1:27:08] kids are fussing
[1:27:09] the wife burnt dinner
[1:27:12] she she she's trying to change the
[1:27:15] diaper and and you get home and now what
[1:27:18] do you mean I got to cook dinner
[1:27:20] you're supposed to cook that no yeah
[1:27:22] you'll cook dinner I'll change it I
[1:27:24] don't want to change that diaper that
[1:27:25] makes me gag
[1:27:29] and all of a sudden
[1:27:31] now's my chance you you see look we we
[1:27:34] have to get to a place I want to move by
[1:27:37] God's grace to get to a place where in
[1:27:39] the small things and then the big things
[1:27:42] we are Discerning that in all of these
[1:27:45] things both great and small is not only
[1:27:48] an opportunity of the devil to try to
[1:27:51] take you out of the will of God and to
[1:27:53] take you into something else but it's
[1:27:55] also an opportunity for for the
[1:27:58] manifestation of the sons of God to
[1:28:00] declare what they are made of it is an
[1:28:03] opportunity that when the chaos breaks
[1:28:06] loose in the home and things are going
[1:28:08] right that there ought to be something
[1:28:10] inside of the believer that said this is
[1:28:12] my house
[1:28:13] this is my church this is my car this is
[1:28:18] my family it ain't no devil gonna take
[1:28:20] away my joy you ain't gonna take away my
[1:28:22] happiness you ain't gonna put a bad
[1:28:24] spirit in this home you ain't gonna put
[1:28:26] a bad atmosphere in this home why
[1:28:29] because God give me this house God give
[1:28:31] me this family and this is mine and I
[1:28:34] have dominion over the things that God
[1:28:36] has given me because I'm living in the
[1:28:38] hour of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:28:40] God it's an opportunity
[1:28:44] and he who is faithful in
[1:28:47] little
[1:28:50] we all want to call for the resurrection
[1:28:52] of the Dead
[1:28:54] We're The Voice
[1:28:56] well we're the final voice to the
[1:28:58] generation and at the the voice of the
[1:29:01] Archangel and and the Archangel is
[1:29:02] Christ and we've come in a union and he
[1:29:04] only has our hands as we yield our hands
[1:29:06] and a voice as healed and we're going to
[1:29:08] be the very ones to Call of the Dead in
[1:29:10] Christ forth out of the grave
[1:29:13] and we we can't even talk to our wife
[1:29:15] right
[1:29:17] we we can't even discern between right
[1:29:20] or wrong in the workplace and as we move
[1:29:22] a little bit further we got to get to a
[1:29:24] place of maturity where we recognize the
[1:29:27] spirits and the framework of the Church
[1:29:30] oh not our church brother Matthew oh no
[1:29:33] not our church no no no no no evil
[1:29:38] spirits working in the framework if if
[1:29:40] we got that idea we're doing something
[1:29:42] wrong
[1:29:44] because if we're right and our Doctrine
[1:29:47] is right then Allah Hale is fighting
[1:29:50] against this revelation
[1:29:52] all our hell is fighting against this
[1:29:54] church
[1:29:55] why do you think it's taken us so long
[1:29:56] to try to build one
[1:30:00] I'm telling you if we were
[1:30:01] denominationals
[1:30:04] we'd have a 50 foot long pipe organ
[1:30:07] without donations from all the all the
[1:30:09] state and boy we'd be in some big church
[1:30:11] somewhere
[1:30:12] but no that's what's hot we're fighting
[1:30:14] against spirits and Antichrist spirit
[1:30:16] and we need to get to the plate friends
[1:30:19] we're in a Warfare we're in a battle uh
[1:30:22] don't you realize our brothers and
[1:30:24] sisters are in a Warfare they're going
[1:30:25] through a battle and we need one another
[1:30:28] to be able to look and catch their
[1:30:30] spirit and be able to discern that my
[1:30:33] brother and my sister they're going
[1:30:35] through a battle the devil is really
[1:30:37] after them I see it in their countenance
[1:30:39] there's something in their spirit that
[1:30:40] just ain't right oh God I'm going to go
[1:30:43] to prayer I'm going to call the wife say
[1:30:45] oh you know something's on my heart for
[1:30:46] brother so and so I just feel like
[1:30:48] they're going through something would
[1:30:50] you bind together with me in prayer oh
[1:30:52] if we can get to that place Church where
[1:30:55] there's a genuine love for one another
[1:30:57] in the building and we're Discerning the
[1:30:59] spirits that are working in the church
[1:31:01] we will be an invincible Army
[1:31:05] we will work called to it it's our
[1:31:06] position
[1:31:10] that cat all of a sudden just Springs
[1:31:13] at the opportunity
[1:31:17] you know you think of it
[1:31:19] when Jesus was fasting for 40 days
[1:31:23] and 40 nights
[1:31:25] he didn't come to him while he was under
[1:31:27] that anointing for the fast
[1:31:29] so we've we've heard and know that many
[1:31:31] times when you're it's a god-called
[1:31:33] faster not even hungry but when he broke
[1:31:34] that fast
[1:31:36] when he was weak that's what the
[1:31:39] scripture has there in Matthew 4 it says
[1:31:41] when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights
[1:31:43] and afterward was hungry
[1:31:46] then the tempter came
[1:31:49] so you can start knowing that you start
[1:31:52] looking around
[1:31:53] and we know in my house I mean I it's
[1:31:57] just it just I don't know that Old Devil
[1:31:59] I'd give him a black eye but it just
[1:32:01] seems like every time you got a minister
[1:32:03] or or God's putting on your heart
[1:32:04] something to do for the Lord it just
[1:32:07] seems all of a sudden this goes wrong
[1:32:08] and that goes wrong and you just stand
[1:32:10] back and say and me and my wife will
[1:32:11] look at you I'm like yeah I know
[1:32:14] it ain't gonna work devil you're trying
[1:32:17] to you're just trying to disrupt the
[1:32:19] plan of God trying to cause some type of
[1:32:21] confusion trying to distract us from the
[1:32:23] main goal and the main purpose but you
[1:32:25] say Old Devil it ain't going to work
[1:32:27] because he's going to attack you when
[1:32:30] you're down he's going to attack you
[1:32:31] when you're hungry he's going to attack
[1:32:33] you in your weakness
[1:32:36] and by God's grace we might get to
[1:32:39] well we might have to save that but we
[1:32:42] might get to some of those things to
[1:32:43] where
[1:32:44] it's in that weakness
[1:32:46] but but we know that it's in that
[1:32:48] weakness see that God allows these
[1:32:51] things
[1:32:52] he allows you to come into these trials
[1:32:54] he allows you to come into these places
[1:32:56] where you experience a weakness because
[1:32:58] a true overcoming Hallelujah true
[1:33:01] overcoming is recognizing in that
[1:33:04] weakness is when now he is made strong
[1:33:08] look at Paul when when Paul they were
[1:33:11] out there he I think they had loosed
[1:33:12] from and I think Paul had warned
[1:33:15] him not to do it now all of a sudden
[1:33:16] they're out on a boat and they're like
[1:33:18] man we haven't seen no stars we haven't
[1:33:20] seen the moon we haven't seen nothing
[1:33:21] for 14 days we've just let the ship
[1:33:23] Drive
[1:33:25] and the scripture actually says in all
[1:33:27] hope was lost
[1:33:29] everybody on that boat were settled we
[1:33:32] are going to die
[1:33:36] all hope was gone
[1:33:39] and guess who was on that boat
[1:33:43] the messenger of the age
[1:33:46] in shackles and chains to a Roman that
[1:33:49] was doomed to die by the rest like the
[1:33:51] rest of them
[1:33:52] but he had something going for him that
[1:33:54] nobody else had going for him
[1:33:56] because there was a purpose in Paul's
[1:33:59] life
[1:34:01] there was a purpose that Paul had to
[1:34:04] fulfill
[1:34:05] and there wasn't no storm
[1:34:07] there wasn't no shipwreck nothing was
[1:34:11] going to stop Paul from manifesting the
[1:34:14] purpose that God had placed him on this
[1:34:17] Earth to manifest
[1:34:19] and Paul could come out there and stand
[1:34:21] there in his weakness
[1:34:25] looking like he had no power at all he
[1:34:28] could come out there and say Hey I want
[1:34:30] you boys to be encouraged
[1:34:32] because the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:34:34] to me last night
[1:34:35] it ain't none of you gonna die if you
[1:34:38] stay on this boat with me according to
[1:34:41] my word none of you will perish I think
[1:34:44] it's time to be happy why don't we just
[1:34:46] go ahead and break out the rations and
[1:34:48] start to eat because none of us are
[1:34:50] going to die and did it stop there no it
[1:34:52] got worse they had to start lightening
[1:34:54] the ship and soon enough all sudden this
[1:34:56] the ship got stuck in the rocks and all
[1:34:58] of a sudden it broke apart
[1:35:00] and some of the soldiers were talking
[1:35:01] about man maybe we should kill the guys
[1:35:03] and chains maybe we shouldn't the one
[1:35:04] Roman soldiers like no no for the sake
[1:35:06] of Paul we no let's keep them all alive
[1:35:08] and then there were some of them on the
[1:35:10] boat they're like hey man we're putting
[1:35:12] out the anchors
[1:35:14] and they were letting down another boat
[1:35:17] they're on this ship and they were
[1:35:18] letting down a little Lifeboat and they
[1:35:19] were going to escape away and Paul
[1:35:21] looked down and said hey man
[1:35:23] the only people that are going to live
[1:35:27] the only people that are going to live
[1:35:29] is on this boat with the messenger of
[1:35:32] the age you want to escape you want to
[1:35:34] go ahead and give some other little
[1:35:35] Lifeboat and you think you're gonna
[1:35:36] float off there and you're gonna Escape
[1:35:38] lady I'll see you and you're gonna
[1:35:40] escape the storms you're gonna be
[1:35:42] Shipwrecked you're gonna be dead you're
[1:35:44] going to be eternally separated from God
[1:35:46] but if you stay on the boat with the
[1:35:48] messenger of the age I don't care how
[1:35:50] bad the storm gets the ship might wreck
[1:35:52] but you're gonna make it to the shore
[1:35:54] some of you might be swimming some of
[1:35:57] you might be floating you may might be
[1:35:59] hanging onto a board but if you stay
[1:36:01] with the messenger of the hour You're
[1:36:04] Gonna Make It To The Shore just stay
[1:36:06] with the message church just stay with
[1:36:09] the messenger of the age
[1:36:11] he was in his weakness
[1:36:14] it wasn't something that Paul could do
[1:36:16] but it was something that God had
[1:36:18] ordained by Paul and he was with them
[1:36:20] every step of the way
[1:36:22] it was in his weakness
[1:36:25] brother random says it comes a time when
[1:36:27] men forsake men
[1:36:30] that becomes a crowning time
[1:36:33] becomes the crowning of a Ministry I
[1:36:36] believe every son and daughter of God
[1:36:37] has a crowning time of your ministry
[1:36:40] I believe every single one of you have a
[1:36:42] specific Ministry I believe that you
[1:36:45] young people every single one of you God
[1:36:47] has ordained you so much that he wrapped
[1:36:50] his own a Zoe life that old
[1:36:51] predestinated seed and he deposited in
[1:36:53] you because there was an expression
[1:36:56] there was an attribute
[1:36:58] there was something that he put into you
[1:37:00] and said oh I have a purpose for the
[1:37:03] seed
[1:37:04] and it's going to come into fruition and
[1:37:06] it's going to manifest the word that I
[1:37:08] have spoken she's going to be a created
[1:37:10] word bride in the end time to put death
[1:37:13] under his feet
[1:37:15] oh I love it
[1:37:16] praise the Lord
[1:37:19] let us win your week the prophet of uh
[1:37:21] Jesus would say this in Matthew 26 41.
[1:37:26] Watch and Pray
[1:37:37] Watch and Pray
[1:37:39] how many of you are watching and praying
[1:37:44] that ye enter not into temptation
[1:37:48] the spirit indeed is willing
[1:37:51] but the flesh is weak
[1:37:56] church we cannot go to sleep on the fact
[1:38:01] that this flesh
[1:38:03] is our worst enemy
[1:38:06] I believe that is one of our biggest
[1:38:09] struggles
[1:38:11] and our biggest battles is Discerning
[1:38:14] our own self-efforts
[1:38:17] of when your own self is deceiving you
[1:38:24] a church we we we really need the spirit
[1:38:29] Revelation by the spirit to really
[1:38:31] understand that this pest house is
[1:38:34] serpent seed
[1:38:37] I don't know if you know that
[1:38:40] but none of you had to be taught how to
[1:38:43] lie
[1:38:46] there is a nature your first husband
[1:38:50] you're born in sin there is a nature or
[1:38:54] if I could say it like a spirit
[1:38:56] that is contrary to the nature of Christ
[1:39:01] and so God has positioned you to be the
[1:39:05] one
[1:39:06] to take back Dominion
[1:39:09] over the Earth again
[1:39:13] look don't worry so much about what is
[1:39:16] out there
[1:39:17] take dominion over this
[1:39:20] and when you get dominion over this then
[1:39:23] you'll have dominion over that
[1:39:26] but don't think for one second you're
[1:39:29] gonna go down the rulebook checklist of
[1:39:32] your knowledge of the message and all
[1:39:34] your do's and don'ts and I don't cut my
[1:39:36] hair and I wear long skirts and and I'm
[1:39:39] not wearing skinny jeans some of the
[1:39:40] brothers can say that some can
[1:39:46] we need the spirit hey come on I'm
[1:39:49] telling you we church we got to get down
[1:39:51] rugged
[1:39:52] if we are going to go into a body change
[1:39:54] we need to stop some of the nonsense
[1:39:57] some of the way that we're dressing and
[1:39:59] some of the way that we're acting and
[1:40:00] some of the music that we're listening
[1:40:02] to and some of the friends that we're
[1:40:03] hanging out with
[1:40:05] oh I'm telling you
[1:40:07] I don't know what to do sometimes I
[1:40:09] sometimes I just say well he said narrow
[1:40:12] is the gate and few that find it
[1:40:14] I don't want to have that kind of
[1:40:15] attitude I just know what God did for me
[1:40:19] it's a separation from unbelief
[1:40:23] how can two walk together
[1:40:26] how can you walk with the Lord Of Glory
[1:40:29] and continue to do the things that
[1:40:31] you're doing look that's not
[1:40:33] condemnation it's the grace of God
[1:40:35] showing you there's a higher order
[1:40:37] there's a higher way you don't have to
[1:40:40] live like that you don't need those
[1:40:42] things for your joy you don't need those
[1:40:44] things for your satisfaction but there
[1:40:47] is a union oh Hallelujah in the Shekinah
[1:40:49] Glory to where you're changed
[1:40:53] well you're walking with him and there's
[1:40:55] a discernment that when that song comes
[1:40:58] on that boy goes by that girl goes by
[1:41:00] something in there says no
[1:41:06] the world is selling a bunch of goods
[1:41:09] there ought to be a cry in The Bride of
[1:41:11] Christ's heart that says I'm not buying
[1:41:15] I don't want what you're selling devil
[1:41:19] I had a whoo
[1:41:21] we won't go there
[1:41:23] cause I I gotta I get all got all riled
[1:41:27] up on a thought about cancel culture
[1:41:30] you know the big old cancel here we go
[1:41:33] cancel culture
[1:41:36] everything out there cancel this cancel
[1:41:38] that because if you don't agree with
[1:41:41] them or if you make a stance that's not
[1:41:43] in line with their views or their agenda
[1:41:46] or their narrative you're canceled
[1:41:50] I want to tell you the devil is so late
[1:41:53] to that party
[1:41:55] you come you're such a poser devil
[1:42:00] my God is the original Castle culture
[1:42:04] we are not supposed to mix with unbelief
[1:42:07] we are not supposed to listen to Satan's
[1:42:09] Lies We are not supposed to mix with the
[1:42:12] world we are not supposed to marry an
[1:42:14] unbeliever we are not supposed to stop
[1:42:16] and listen to the music we're not
[1:42:18] supposed to go on the websites and the
[1:42:20] jebusites and the all those lights out
[1:42:22] there
[1:42:23] that there's something in Us by the holy
[1:42:25] ghost that has canceled
[1:42:27] canceled
[1:42:28] canceled
[1:42:30] it doesn't fit our narrative
[1:42:33] I'm going in a body change I'm going in
[1:42:37] a Rapture yeah I'm going to cancel that
[1:42:39] nonsense you got me once devil you got
[1:42:42] me twice but you ain't going to get me
[1:42:43] again canceled
[1:42:45] the devil made an appointment I'm going
[1:42:47] to cancel it he made an appointment with
[1:42:50] death canceled
[1:42:52] I'm going to put death under my feet and
[1:42:55] go ahead put that six foot of deep dirt
[1:42:58] over top of me It Ain't Gonna Keep Me
[1:43:00] I'm gonna come up
[1:43:02] if I go in the water if I go somewhere
[1:43:04] else I am coming up
[1:43:07] his appointment's been canceled why
[1:43:09] because Jesus Christ The Mighty
[1:43:10] conqueror anyways
[1:43:14] we got to start canceling the devil
[1:43:18] why because the spirit indeed is willing
[1:43:21] but the flesh is weak
[1:43:27] I'm too tired to pray
[1:43:31] I don't have time to listen to a message
[1:43:34] uh church is too far on a Wednesday
[1:43:37] night
[1:43:38] I can stream
[1:43:41] yeah try try streaming the wedding
[1:43:43] supper
[1:43:44] tell me how that one works
[1:43:47] I don't know I don't know
[1:43:50] I get fanatical I don't mean to get like
[1:43:52] this
[1:43:52] oh and I wouldn't blame it but if by
[1:43:54] Faith by faith if we can look past the
[1:43:57] veil and look at Divine promise and
[1:43:59] believe that Jesus Christ is here right
[1:44:01] now
[1:44:04] now like I said I I'm not going to fault
[1:44:07] for this but if brother Branham was here
[1:44:12] there would we would have problems but
[1:44:14] people would be carnal like the pool of
[1:44:16] Bethesda you think we'd have Windows
[1:44:19] they'd be broke out
[1:44:21] because everybody
[1:44:24] would want to be there oh friends
[1:44:26] friends
[1:44:28] trust me
[1:44:29] trust me I know some people that
[1:44:32] perceive that when Jesus was a Healer
[1:44:34] and there was all those people camped
[1:44:35] around what they do they ripped the roof
[1:44:37] off
[1:44:39] they ripped the roof off if if that man
[1:44:43] that's a hotline to heaven
[1:44:45] and my family member that's been sick
[1:44:47] all these years I am going to get him
[1:44:50] there
[1:44:52] and what did they do they couldn't get
[1:44:54] in so what did they do they climbed up
[1:44:56] they got on the roof and said boys we're
[1:44:58] going in what are you doing we're going
[1:44:59] to rip the roof off this place because I
[1:45:03] got faith look they had faith for the
[1:45:05] one that had infirmity it's time
[1:45:09] it's time we come to a place whereas a
[1:45:12] group of Believers we can have enough
[1:45:15] faith for the people that don't
[1:45:18] yes sir I believe the bride is coming
[1:45:21] into a place where we are an invincible
[1:45:23] Army and we can start Discerning the
[1:45:27] little foxes that are spoiling the vine
[1:45:29] and are making us cold formal and
[1:45:33] Powerless
[1:45:35] and we'll just keep going so I'm going
[1:45:37] to call for the musicians
[1:45:39] we need Revelation by the spirit
[1:45:43] that we might be able to discern and
[1:45:47] withstand
[1:45:55] it's time we start saying
[1:45:57] like Jesus when he was a hunger
[1:46:00] he was weak
[1:46:02] he was being tempted
[1:46:06] in a weak moment
[1:46:07] the tempter came
[1:46:09] what did he say
[1:46:12] get behind me devil
[1:46:14] man shall not live
[1:46:17] by bread alone
[1:46:19] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:46:22] the mouth of God
[1:46:23] why did Jesus rebuke Peter
[1:46:27] Jesus was expressing his heart to the
[1:46:30] disciples say look this is the very
[1:46:32] reason and purpose I have come into the
[1:46:34] world
[1:46:35] that I I must suffer these things
[1:46:39] I must die in raise on the third day
[1:46:42] this is the very word that is spoken
[1:46:46] concerning me there's nothing that can
[1:46:48] stop me from
[1:46:50] the purpose that I've been placed here
[1:46:52] for
[1:46:53] and Peter
[1:46:56] our Lord
[1:46:57] fire be it from you to manifest what
[1:47:00] you're here to do
[1:47:01] that's really what he was telling the
[1:47:02] Lord
[1:47:03] but don't don't get confused it's not so
[1:47:06] much that the Lord was rebuking Peter
[1:47:09] the individual who he loved
[1:47:11] but it was the carnality
[1:47:14] that that that that that that Peter not
[1:47:18] Discerning the Lord's body
[1:47:20] if Peter had the Revelation and the
[1:47:23] discernment to know that this is what
[1:47:26] what this is what has to be done with
[1:47:28] the word
[1:47:30] if he was Discerning the Lord's body and
[1:47:33] the prophecies and there in that burden
[1:47:35] Peter would say oh Lord
[1:47:39] oh I'm with you
[1:47:42] let me know what I can do but see Peter
[1:47:45] wasn't discerning the Lord's body he
[1:47:48] wasn't Discerning the word and many are
[1:47:51] sick amongst us
[1:47:53] because we're not Discerning the Lord's
[1:47:55] body we're too carnal
[1:47:57] and so why did Jesus do he looked at him
[1:48:00] and he rebuked the flesh
[1:48:03] get behind me Satan
[1:48:06] because you're looking at the things of
[1:48:08] man you're looking at the things of the
[1:48:11] natural you don't Savor the things of
[1:48:13] God and friends we need to look ourself
[1:48:16] in the mirror

[1:48:39] under subjection

[1:48:58] to you
[1:49:01] we got to start doing as our Pastor said
[1:49:03] we got to do things with purpose
[1:49:06] we got to read
[1:49:08] we got to pray
[1:49:10] take time to get in the presence of the
[1:49:12] Lord what was our pastor laboring on you
[1:49:15] have to make a
[1:49:18] choice
[1:49:20] now the prophet of God would say this
[1:49:22] when the church
[1:49:24] disbelieves Satan
[1:49:27] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:49:30] the word
[1:49:32] the Gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:49:36] against her
[1:49:38] you you have to disbelieve first you
[1:49:40] realize that
[1:49:41] don't don't you realize it's in the DNA
[1:49:44] of the flesh to believe
[1:49:46] by the touch taste feel smell see right
[1:49:49] all the things that you contact your
[1:49:52] Earthly home you accept it you believe
[1:49:54] it
[1:49:55] Olive ladies Satan's eating all these
[1:49:58] things it's easy for you to grasp and
[1:50:00] and conceive and and believe and and the
[1:50:03] word of the Lord has come and say you
[1:50:05] have to disbelieve all of those things
[1:50:09] Science Education reasoning
[1:50:13] we we gotta quit we gotta disbelieve all
[1:50:16] those things
[1:50:17] you you have to disbelieve what Satan's
[1:50:21] Eden has presented as a successful life
[1:50:25] you have to make a conscious choice and
[1:50:28] realize that College
[1:50:31] is not the ticket to a successful life
[1:50:35] a better job is not the ticket to a
[1:50:39] successful life getting married oh I
[1:50:41] finally will be able to overcome that
[1:50:44] lust devil if I just get married it's
[1:50:46] better to marry to the that I'll finally
[1:50:48] be able to be no none of that none of
[1:50:51] those things are a ticket to a
[1:50:54] successful life there's many people
[1:50:56] that have done all those things and even
[1:50:59] now you're hearing about the most
[1:51:00] successful people in our economy and our
[1:51:03] age and what are they doing they're
[1:51:05] committing suicide
[1:51:07] because that's not the answer I I love
[1:51:11] years ago
[1:51:12] uh my brother David he said it and I I
[1:51:15] thought it was profound
[1:51:17] but but he said suicide is just a
[1:51:20] perversion of the truth
[1:51:22] because this life is not worth living in
[1:51:25] the flesh but you're not supposed to
[1:51:27] take your own life you're supposed to
[1:51:28] die to yourself and surrender it to
[1:51:30] Jesus Christ and if you can just
[1:51:33] Surrender Your Life to Jesus that's the
[1:51:35] ticket to a successful life
[1:51:38] you get born again and buy the holy
[1:51:42] spirit let it lead you and guide you
[1:51:44] into all truth and all righteousness and
[1:51:48] by the revelation of the spirit you will
[1:51:50] discern between what's right and wrong
[1:51:52] should I take this job should I take
[1:51:55] this course should I marry this girl
[1:51:57] should I marry this boy should I get
[1:51:59] down and pray should I go over here
[1:52:01] should I stop a moment should I go out
[1:52:03] and run to the store should I go into
[1:52:04] the office and just pray for five
[1:52:06] minutes you see it's a relationship
[1:52:07] where it's you and the Lord together
[1:52:10] you're doing something together it's a
[1:52:13] union we're so busy running off on our
[1:52:16] own accord with our own plans and
[1:52:19] allowing this flesh to juristic our day
[1:52:22] and order our steps but if we can just
[1:52:25] die to the flesh
[1:52:27] oh
[1:52:29] oh let's stand
[1:52:33] and by God's grace we'll be able to
[1:52:36] maybe share with you about in that
[1:52:38] weakness
[1:52:40] in that weakness
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:44] that's where he's strong
[1:52:46] Paul wanted to be delivered
[1:52:49] he had that infirmity in his Flash and
[1:52:51] said oh God delivered me from this
[1:52:52] infirmity deliver me from this weakness
[1:52:57] because he he felt oh I if I could just
[1:53:00] if you would just heal me from this
[1:53:02] it'll make everything better
[1:53:04] but what did God say to him
[1:53:08] he said Paul
[1:53:10] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:53:13] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:53:18] he said most gladly therefore will I
[1:53:20] rather glory in my infirmity
[1:53:23] that the power of Christ May rest upon
[1:53:26] me
[1:53:27] I will glory
[1:53:29] in my weakness
[1:53:31] because it's in your weakness
[1:53:35] it's in your weakness
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:39] that he's made strong
[1:53:41] amen let's just sing this

[1:55:14] just in closing I read this quote out of
[1:55:16] perfect strength by Perfect weakness now
[1:55:18] bound God passes the Nobles
[1:55:21] and gets the weakness
[1:55:25] God passes those who think there's
[1:55:28] something
[1:55:29] to take somebody that don't know nothing
[1:55:32] to order to work his purpose in their
[1:55:35] life
[1:55:36] that's what we get God said to Paul my
[1:55:39] strength is perfect in your weakness my
[1:55:41] strength becomes more perfect as you
[1:55:44] become more weaker
[1:55:46] more you can yield to me the better I
[1:55:50] can use you
[1:55:52] the more you can forget about your
[1:55:55] education the more you can forget about
[1:55:58] your denomination the more you can
[1:56:01] forget about your stuff
[1:56:05] the more you can forget about your stuff
[1:56:08] and yield yourself to me the more I can
[1:56:13] use you cause you become weak
[1:56:17] I'll make my own purpose strong
[1:56:22] God can make strength out of weakness
[1:56:26] that's the reason
[1:56:28] he always does it oh God let us be a
[1:56:33] generation
