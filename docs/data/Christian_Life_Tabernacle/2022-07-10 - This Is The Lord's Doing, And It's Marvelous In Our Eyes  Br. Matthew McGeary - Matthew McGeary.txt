Description:
This Is The Lord's Doing, And It's Marvelous In Our Eyes
Br. Matthew McGeary
July 10th, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's all standing sitting down this morning [Music] he has risen from the dead and he's [Music] every time [Music] that jesus christ is lord amen [Music] when he [Music] is [Music] a great time [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] from one more time it's my lord [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] our gracious father we so grateful and thankful to be gathered in your presence lord and we can certainly say you are our lord you are our god and father there's no one beside you lord and father you're the one that was and that is and that is to come oh god and be lifted up this morning as we're gathered in your presence lord and father we want to hear from you we want to hear from your throne and father we commit the service into your hands and we invite you even now lord that you may come and father in our praise is in our songs and everything lord and father let it be for your glory oh god that you may be pleased with it let it be a sweet incense before you that father this morning that you may dwell in the midst of the praises of your people lord and we've come here not to see a man not to just see one another but to worship you to adore you to show appreciation for all that you've done for us lord we're so thankful that you've chosen us you're so we're so thankful father that you've invited us this morning to be guided with you father we ask that you prepare us as we get ready and when the word is going to come father let it just be father the refreshing part that could come and speak to our hearts and create the growth that we need and create the changes about that we need lord to be in your image lord we believe this is the way you have chosen that it by the preaching of the gospel that we may receive you and be partakers of divine nature and be changed from day to day in the image of the perfect son we invite you we commit everything into your hands this morning and ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning amen amen amen as you well know but jackson and sister laura will be moving away so certainly we're gonna miss him you know but jackson has been such a pillar of this church you know i refer to him as the face of the franchise you know it's like when you see jackson you see dallas it's always been my goodness words will fail me to describe everything such a honest upstanding person and you know he he when he does something he does it with everything within him and not halfway and i certainly appreciate all that it's done for the body a man who may never be forgotten or certainly pray that the lord will lead him in the path that is going and this morning we'll invite him to just come and say a few words to the church amen but certainly i you know i was woke up this morning trying to think i said you know just how much could be said of him and certainly appreciate him god bless you brother jackson man well as billy said you know we've decided to move the lord is leading us in another direction for another season brother davis said it so well on wednesday night he read a quote about a season of time and we know that god has all things ordained and all things are perfect um a lot of times i'll say that we can't ever tell exactly what he's doing time will tell the story um i look back at maybe the way that god was leading us and you see maybe a natural church body you see your friends you see your family maybe your home maybe your job and things like that you think well this is what people sign up for this is you know the god has granted you everything and then he's doing something and making a stirring and you got to consider that and one of the things that's on my heart and it may sound like a cliche but in matthew 6 33 he says but seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added and that's something that we've always wanted to portray in our life and even when it seems like it's tough or you're going through some things you want to make sure that that you're seeking his face first even as i told brother david i know that he given me the opportunity and not many not everybody has that type of opportunity but and i know he wanted to be here but due to timing and circumstances he had to be away this weekend at a funeral but i wanted to thank him and the mcgarry family as a whole they've always taken me in i told him i said i felt like the fourth son of the family he baptized me and laura he married us he dedicated our children he's baptized both of our children he even did my dad's funeral when he passed away several years ago and i would say the thing about brother david is he has a uh he has a heart for the people uh he knows that sometimes that he says and does things and then you know but then you see the heart of him and what he does for people and he's just done so much for me behind the scenes and just throughout my whole life it's just really taking care of me and then i would say here's a local church body um god has just raised up amazing men uh we're been in our first i was part of the the old building and then we built this building and now we're transitioning to another building so you see that god is adding to the flock here and he's just doing so many wonderful things so i say that hopefully i've served you guys well and the capacity as a deacon many of you have opened up your home over the years where we would come up and we lived an hour and 15 minutes away and people would just open up their home and let us stay and feed us and have just really played their part as the body here locally so we say thank you we haven't been able to meet all the obligations because of the timing with folks who want to want to get together but this will be our last service so we'll be heading out after this and i just want to say that that we love you we know that god's blessings will be upon you and just ask that you would pray for us and our family and whatever the lord has for us next so we just say god bless you [Applause] amen amen we that are remaining will continue to fight amen that's what we're here to do it's uh we're in the lord's battle and we'll fight wherever he wants us to be fighting amen god bless you this morning we'll invite brother tim salah for assam reading this morning if you could stand amen welcome to the house of the lord amen what a blessing it is to be here uh that's tough news you hear this morning uh but the jackson sister laura have been a part of us for so long they certainly feel like family we'll miss them dearly appreciate brother jackson all he stood for i think it's uh clearly evident what a true conversion will do for you man we don't want to take too much time this morning but you get the opportunity to come up here and if you're able you can speak um we just want to edify the body of christ and exhort the one that we're living for we're going to read from psalm 71 my bible says david prayeth for perseverance and truly that's what we need in this hour i've been reflecting for some time when book of galatians paul said that we're the children of promise i'm so thankful this morning account of the great privilege to be considered a child of promise we know that abraham had two sons ishmael and isaac and the bible says that the bondwoman would not be heir with a free woman and brother branham i just noticed this morning in searching that he uses this scripture and the message c does not ever the shock and he preached that in late spring of 65 and he started drawing the difference between organized religion and the bride of christ and he drew it a lot finer than that right before the last services he had at the tabernacle he really laid it out there satan's eden god of this evil age and realizing that the domination world is serving the devil worshiping the devil and doesn't even know it and you realize how he talked about the life that was in the tassel the stalk the husk even for a season for a time god winked at that and that was the life could make to the seed once it got in the seed you better get out of the husk you know there's we like to think of progressive revelation sometimes in the in the message where we get a little insight on what the prophet is talking about and then we search and we think oh it gets a little deeper a little deeper a few years later maybe god reveals the whole thing for you and i and i do believe that but there's not going to be error and then truth and then error than truth once you see the truth let's stick with the truth amen amen and that's how we are children of the promise is because of our faith in the lord jesus he said not the abraham and his seed were the promises made seed singular not plural as in seeds of many but one which was jesus christ and by faith in jesus christ that's how we become children of the promise amen let's read this psalm 71 and i want to add this i appreciate that this body here this assembly and all that you've done for my wife and i the you know and obviously there's empty seats over here it's uh it's kind of like jackson largo you know it's just it leaves a hole uh we're thankful that we have a church family that's done so much for us in service and blessings financial everything else and what we've just been through but thank you for that psalm 71 in thee oh lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou has given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth by thee have i been holding up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of thee i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge let my mouth be filled with i praise and with thy honor all the day cast me off forsake me not when my strength faileth for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him oh god be not far from me o my god make haste for my health let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be recovered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt but i will hope continually and yet praise thee more and more my shall fold forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works now also when i am old and grey-headed oh god forsake me not until i have showed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to everyone that is to come thy righteousness also o god is very high who has done great things o god who is like unto thee thou which has shown me great and sore troubles shall quicken me again and shall bring up again from the depths of the earth thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side i will also praise thee with the sultry even thy truth o my god unto thee will i sing with the heart oh thou mighty one of israel my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt blessed be the name of the lord praise the lord you may have your sins this morning amen he came to liver [Music] will be [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] everywhere [Music] oh [Music] again [Music] oh [Music] right oh [Music] um so [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything amen oh and pains of death is on my soul unto the lord i cry always jesus came and made me whole i would not be i was [Music] jesus came and he made me [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] my lord was [Music] the work is [Music] oh till jesus came and he made me hold up saying that first again my lord was [Music] gone but i praise the lord the work is [Music] i would not be denied [Music] has came [Music] [Applause] [Music] for me [Music] there was greater grace [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] gladly [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the grace [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] amen amen aren't you glad for the grace i was extended amen amen we have unspoken requests and um sister rebecca writes in the biblical request asking for god guidance and also another one that says one one of our customers has asked to please pray for his son-in-law he's 28 years old and he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer and and liver cancer and she said that she knows that our god is a real god amen and i ask that we have faith for her and her family i mean i believe that's what the gospel is for a man that he may be extended to those that needs it that that same god may manifest that same power that he manifested in us through other people amen amen and amen i believe there's nothing that makes a believer more happy than to see god move and extend that same grace and mercy to somebody else so if you have a knee upon your heart just leave your hand up to him when i remember our pastor and david and sister leslie this morning praying amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if you could come in brother orlando if you could just come and pray for the needs amen amen also don't forget uh forgot to make the announcement this wednesday there will be no service because of the work that's going to be taking place so no service on wednesday amen let us bow our heads most gracious and eternal father lord god only by your grace and mercy father have we been allowed to gather here in your presence father my little finite man lord god i can't remember no requests no no no no person's name for my seat to up here but lord your your your god you know all things lord god father you you created us lord god for our sufficiency it's not of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of the other lord god and there's a testimony lord god not of myself but many many others many clouds of witness that we have lord god of the power of just believing in your word lord god and that you are god that will not lie that you will do whatever it says that you said you would do father lord and for these unspoken requests lord god

standing before your bride lord you know how little i feel knowing my shortcomings my faults my failures looking out on the landscape of your great word that you've sent and the mighty men that you have raised up in the last days lord many times we can shrink back lord we want to look with eyes of faith this morning to know that this is something that man has not done but this is something that you're doing in each one of us lord that you are building a house with lively stones of revelations that have struck the hearts of men and women across the world with this great revelation that you have unfolded in the last days and father we're here standing in position asking that you would come now lord that you would anoint your servant that you'd anoint your people anoint our eyes with i sat father break the bread of life as only you can lord we look for the supernatural this morning we're looking for you to move in a mighty way lord it is not by chance that we have gathered together this morning but this has been a predestinated this has been ordained by you so we come with a confidence lord knowing that the needs that we have the questions upon our heart lord we serve a god that is the same yesterday today and forever and now lord we're looking at the unseen father that you come now have vine wade in this service we pray in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord and if you have your bibles let's just turn in psalms 118. amen i just want to get right to the word we want to remember our pastor and sister leslie has their way um at the funeral for for joe dalton just dear friends going back to the flagstaff years and i certainly had to spend time with them when i lived in the area and just over the years so just remember them and also um i i i would comment or say more about um brother jackson and the burns but i'm going to move right to the word i couldn't say anything greater than what the word would say and so this will be my heart to them let's read psalms 118. verse 21 reads i will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes let's also return to romans 9 33. i don't know if we'll have maybe time to get into it but i want to read this portion here because romans 9 33 it says as you turn there this is the scripture uh that uh brother branham came out of the vision that he had on december 22nd 1962 as he was that vision uh being uh caught there in that constellation of angels he would come out of that vision and he'd be reading this romans 9 33 and then it also would say that it would seem juvenile but i said lord if that be you let me turn in my bible again to read this and so i believe that this scripture is linked to the fulfillment of the vision of the constellation of angels it says as it was written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you may have your seats this morning and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed as we even heard wednesday night you know blessed is he who is not offended in me and i just want to encourage you this morning to have faith in what god is doing if there's anything that i can convey to the bride of jesus christ something that is in my heart that i want to speak to you i want you to have faith in what god is doing i just want to encourage you that and if maybe for a title i would like to title this this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes uh the prophet of god would say this and expectancy if i can get a little bit more on the on the monitors he would say now no matter what the opposition looks like christ is the answer faith brings christ thank you notice could you remember 80 years old a white beard now he's speaking of simeon who was 80 years old it looked like his life was coming to an end but this crazy old man was going around and telling people that i'm not going to die until i see the lord's christ now and i'll think of that testimony there uh now that he's saying but but watch what the prophet says he says no matter what the opposition looks like christ is the answer faith brings christ notice could you remember 80 years old white beard white hair and yet an old man went around telling people that he wasn't going to die until he's seen the lord's christ what a beautiful picture of faith remember that what a beautiful picture of faith faith knows no defeat oh glory to god look i'm wanting to encourage you this morning look god got it all in control now faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is nothing to be brought oh my you might feel a little hopeless this morning you might feel like you don't know what to do you might feel like there's nothing for you but look faith brings things when there is nothing to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away faith takes a negative and makes it a positive oh hallelujah think of that now faith takes a negative and makes it a positive i just want to say if we could only see what the master is doing this morning i want to say that revelation helps develop the picture faith helps develop the picture you know many times it's it's our lack of understanding it's our lack of perception that causes us to look at a situation the wrong way you know i think of this story maybe you've heard it of this man he was on the subway and he was taking his daily commute and and no doubt there early in the morning people are riding the subway and you got some that are that are uh reading the newspapers some are now now i've told you how old the story is because nobody reads a newspaper anymore they were reading the newspaper and and people some were just dozing off to sleep and it was kind of just a quiet uh morning on the subway and people were going their way and this man he just kind of cozy down into his seat and and he was just maybe looking at the people and there was a stop and this man got on the train with two kids and he just nestled down beside him and he looked at him and the man just seemed to just close his eyes immediately and he looked over at the kids and the train took off and and all of a sudden these kids were kind of uh running and causing a little scene on the on the subway and he thought my and he looked over at the uh perceived to be the father and thought well why is this man allowing these kids you know this it was kind of was peaceful on this train and all of a sudden they're causing nonsense and they're running by and they they stepped on that one person's shoe and made them flinch and they spilled their coffin he ran by and hit that other people's paper this this little cozy atmosphere that we were in has all sudden been disre disrupted uh how uh this man is so uh inconsiderate you're so inconsiderate of everybody else why are you so oblivious to everything that's going on and you're just going to let these little kids run wild and so you know he finally mustered up a little courage and thought you know what i got to say something i i i got to do something you know many times we do that we think we got the answer and we're going to be the one to say something and we come and approach the individual like you know what i'm going to set you straight and he looks over at the man and he he he kind of nudges him and says hey you know your kids you know everything was okay and uh on here but now your kids are running through in there they're wreaking havoc why don't you get a handle of your kids and the man just said oh i'm so sorry i i don't know what to do we just we just come from the hospital they just lost their mother she died of a brain aneurysm i don't know what i'm gonna do and all of a sudden this man who once was filled with anger this man that was irritated this man that was going to set him straight he he was he was going to really read this guy the rights act but when he got more of the story when he received a little bit more information all of a sudden there was a paradigm shift all of a sudden the the perspective if i could say it this way the angle that he was looking at the story changed and when the angle of the story changed all of a sudden the irritation was replaced with compassion the anger was replaced with concern and all of a sudden there was this paradigm shift where all of these emotions that he was feeling once about what was unfolding in front of him now he's totally switched the way he was looking at the story and he's looking at it now with what can i do to help i want to support you i want to help you oh what happened what is wrong or what can i do for you and immediately when when when that story kind of was conveyed and the people that were sitting around and heard the story all of a sudden all the attitudes come on somebody a lot of time we get attitudes well a lot of times we think we know what we should do well i tell you what i mean that person they're late to church every sunday and they don't come on wednesday what's the matter with i'm just gonna well why don't you take that brother out for a meal why don't you take them out or why don't you reach out to them why don't you get to down to where they're living and see what you can do to help them many times we got the solution and we haven't spent one hour in prayer we haven't spent one minute in prayer we haven't even tried to think it out oh god what can i do to help my brother and sister we just want to sit there in the judgment seat and the scripture says be careful with what judgment you judge lest you be judged be careful now you look out on your brothers and sisters and you judge them when you haven't had to walk one step in their shoes you don't know what they're going through you don't know what it took for them to get to the house of god on sunday morning you don't know what it took for them to get to the house of god on wednesday you don't know what it took oh but if we can just look past the veil if we look past our own carnal thinking if we can look past our ideas if there could be something that can anchor in your heart this morning that something could stand there and you can say this is the large doing and it's marvelous in our eyes see many times it's the lack of information the lack of understanding where we lose hope where where we get angry and we get upset and we get confused but i just want to say there is something beyond what you can see this morning there's something beyond your feelings there's something beyond your emotions there's something beyond your trials there's something beyond everything that you are feeling in the natural i want to say uh there's something beyond that that is taking place i think of gaza coming out there in the morning and the syrian army had surrounded them and what did he do said oh master what are we going to do because all hazel could do was he could just see that he was outnumbered in the natural come on somebody all gazer could do was see the circumstance he could only see the symptoms that he was surrounded by but he couldn't see the supernatural and so when he came to the man of god he said oh master what are we going to do see the prophet he he had he had eagle vision the prophet can see something that you cannot see and so the prophet could tell geheza i uh look guys there is more that is with us then that is with them not so much that even the prophet had seen it but the prophet knew by divine promise that the angel was with him and he knew that the the angels would camp around about the saints oh don't you realize there is more with us than there is against us if your eyes could just be open this morning to see the host of heaven that is sitting around the house of god this morning and what did the prophet say he prayed and said o lord open his eyes you see it takes a prophet to open the eyes it god god's word always comes to a prophet and it's through the prophet that the eyes come open and when the prophet spoke and said oh god open his eyes all of a sudden the angle or the perspective that he was looking at the picture from it was developed by a revelation that there is more with us than is or against us and all of a sudden the scene changed completely and i'm wanting to encourage you this morning you're you're you you're feeling attacked you're feeling pinned down you're feeling helpless you're feeling hurt you're feeling wounded you don't understand what's going on you don't understand why these things are happening why are we going through this i don't understand why it has to be this way this is wrong it shouldn't go this way i don't understand it but i believe there's a revelation that can strike your heart today where you can step back in the face of all the circumstance in the face of all the disappointment in the face of everything you're going through and in the face of the enemy you can say this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in ours oh what a victory to be able to stand in the face of your adversary what a victory to be able to stand in a dark and evil day what a victory to be able to stand when hell is raging against you what a victory to be able to say come on am i preaching to somebody let's get loose in the house of god what's the matter with us oh what is it like to be able to stand with a revelation and say this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes that's a victory church see the prophet could bring something that was unseen into view the prophet was able to say oh god open his eyes this message takes the negative and makes it positive without this word lest you walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ oh we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all of our sins you realize that god has sent a vindicated message god has sent a prophet god has by by divine a revelation and vindication at the revealing of the son of man what is it doing it's taking a negative oh glory to god in the darkest hour that the world has ever seen when there is no light but in the evening time it shall be light he takes the negative he takes the darkness and he makes it a positive oh that's the god we serve he can take whatever negative situation whatever negative symptom whatever you're going through he will take it and he can make it a positive for hebrews says hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the evidence of things hoped for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and by faith right it's by faith we understand that god created the heavens and earth it's by faith we understand that he framed the world and galatians 3 6 would say even as abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness know ye not that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham is this just a story know ye not that ye are the seed of abraham the royal seed of abraham not the seed of the flesh but the royal seed through jesus christ that which you are heir to all things it's for you god gave abraham a promise why because he wanted to god gave abraham a land why because he wanted to god gave you a promise why because he wanted to god sanctified you why because he wanted to god filled you with the holy ghost why because he wanted to god sent nine spiritual gifts into the church why because he wanted to i wonder if you want what god wants for you if we can just get out of our thinking and out of our ideas and out of what we think we want and not what god wants for you coming to manifestation there'll be a power sweep through this building there'll be a power to set you free oh hallelujah i'm preaching to somebody this is for you church there's a power here there's something here to set you free you ain't got to live in bondage anymore i'm coming for something watch out devil oh brother matthew you can't talk like that well the prophet talked like that well why don't we just get into it can you can you receive it from a prophet i wonder if we can we say we can receive it from a prophet but when a preacher says what the prophet said we can't receive it watch out somebody when a man of god stands and preaches a vindicated message sometimes we don't want to receive it because we don't like the veil we say we believe what's on the tapes and then we preach it and you don't even respond but i'm wondering if there's a people in the house of god this morning with faith in their heart that will respond to the call of god [Applause] god could have called everybody on the planet earth but there was only one person with the ability to respond that was abraham well matthew where do you get that well god put something in abraham why are you sitting here this morning is it because of something you did your ability you were able to do two plus two equals revelations 10 7 luke 17 30 and that's why i'm here come on somebody no this is this is the lord's doing oh something's moving in my heart now this is the lord that's why you're sitting here this is the lord's story because god called you god placed something in you that could receive the message of the hour where other people walked away there's something in your heart that i can't walk away i can't leave this message why because god has placed something inside you that can't walk away that's like me trying to walk away from being a mcgeary i'm no longer going to be a mcgeary i'm just fed up with with all the complexes and the big nose and i'm just fed up with my mannerisms and every time i preach people accuse me of acting like my daddy and acting like my brother and looking like them i'm just i'm just going to throw in the towel i'm done well you know what's going to happen every day i wake up i'm going to realize i'm a mcgeary and there's nothing i can do to change that i can even have plastic surgery i can rip my face off it doesn't matter what i do i was born on a dairy and there's a people in the house of god that were born sons and daughters of god and there ain't nothing you can do to change that when did you become an eagle when you heard the message no you always were an eagle and the reason you can be reborn is because you're a son of god oh glory to god this is the lord's doing see the devil wants to try to stop what the lord is doing but he can't whoo somebody come to the house of god to get delivered and satan wants to stop it but he can't as long as there's believing children believing sons and daughters of god with the call of god upon their heart that will receive the word watch out devils oh glory to god hallelujah abraham could possess the land and what was on it look you can possess all things possessing all things 1962 abraham could possess the land of what was on it god gave it to him and lot was part of that land so abraham had a right to it he could call or lay hold of it he said now god you made me the promise somebody i just start swirling that in your heart god you made me a promise that this land and all that was in it is mine you made the promise now my kinsmen has been taken and all he's got is gone in other words if i would apply it today i would say the church could say lord god here's my brother he's laying here stricken with cancer he's stricken with tuberculosis he got sown so i lay hold of the promise it's my possession you told me so amen there you are then then then you can go after that enemy well somebody ought to start getting encouraged you can go after that enemy what enemy are you fighting what are you up against you can go after that enemy the devil and slaughter it just the same as abraham slaughtered the kings and brought back his possession amen i like that it's two believers it's not to the make believer it's not to the unbeliever it's not to the impersonators look i'm not so much looking for something that i could work up i'm looking at a promise and if you're looking at a promise that's the thing that gets you moving the prophet of god said the real believer is looking for the manifestation of the holy spirit something in their heart moving i'm not looking for something that's dead i'm not looking for some formal cold dead religion where i just sit in the pew and i say oh bless god amen god sent a prophet no so i'm looking for the manifestation of the holy spirit something in my heart that's moving oh i want a fire shut up in my bones the holy spirit and manifestation paul said i come not with enticing words of men's wisdom but i come in the power and demonstration of the holy ghost there is a holy ghost here with power and demonstration if you can receive the manifestation oh hallelujah glory the real believers looking for the manifestation are you looking what you looking for this morning what did you come to see you come to fulfill a religious idea is there parameters on your faith when i go to church this this is the way we do it here and there's limits there's limits on on how i believe there's limits on how i conduct myself there's limits on how the holy ghost decides to move i'm going to guard my heart because boy if the holy ghost gets a hold of me i don't know what would happen i might act a fool well well if it's the holy ghost what are you looking for when jesus was passing by you know the throng of people were were all around him but there was a believer there that said oh if i could only touch the m of his garment that's who this message is to is to that real believer oh if i could only uh touch the hem of his garment is there somebody here that come to the service this morning that says oh if i could only touch the hymn of his garment anything's possible the promise is to you god gave it to you why because he wanted to god wants to set you free god wants to give you your heart's desire god wants to speak to you god wants to give you revelation god god wants to to sanctify you and fill with the holy ghost god wants to pour his gifts into the church do you want them oh brother matthew those days are gone the uh i'm sorry i've heard a vindicated prophet say too many times when people brought that argument and say the apostle times are over he said i'll show you where they started you show me where they ended and perceived to prove that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever that same god is here this morning that same god is here tomorrow will you open up your heart and receive the word will you welcome the word this morning are you willing to let the holy ghost and the word minister to your heart are you ready to get rid of your ideas and your thinking and your ways and how i think about it and my judgment and the way i thought it all should be and are you willing to allow the word wash you and cleanse you and set you up upon the strong rock of revelation where you can stand there and say this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes i'm tired of being a critic i'm tired of criticizing i just want to jump all the way into the holy ghost and say lord whatever you have for me here i am yet abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it see that's the problem some of us don't want to fight did you come to do battle this morning i hope somebody's here fighting with me hey if we're gonna have deliverance in the house of god we gotta fight for it if demon spirits gonna be cast out we gotta fight for it if our children are gonna be filled with the holy ghost we gotta fight for it if people are gonna be healed we gotta fight for it is there people that have gathered together this morning that are gonna fight for the manifestation of the promise that god has given you well draw your sword let's get ready let's go to battle he had to fight to possess it there you are the believer today yet we are heir to all things yet we are heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promised but yet you have to fight for every inch of it that's the way god's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own maybe that's the problem we need a paradigm shift because maybe the devil's been lying to you so long that you don't think what is yours is not yours anymore some of you have been robbed from your joy some of you have been robbed from your shout some of you have been robbed from your victory where is that victory you had a youth camp oh brother matthew you're going all the way back to april yeah i'm going all the way back to april why not because something real happened to you where is that real something that happened to you i think it's time for a revival what is a revival it's not getting something new it's stirring up something that's already there why don't you just start thinking about the joy of the lord why don't you start thinking about what god did for you some of us that have been doing it for a little while why don't you think back 20 years ago figure out 30 years ago when that burden of sin was upon you you didn't know what you were doing you were battling thoughts of suicide you were laying in your bed ready to die but god had thoughts concerning you not thoughts of evil but he hadn't expected him he had given you a word he had given you promise he wasn't going to let you die laying there oh come on somebody and then when you heard that voice when you heard the love of god to you and something broke loose oh there was a joy there was a shout there was a victory there was something you wanted to talk about does somebody know what i'm talking about is there somebody that's been set free is there somebody that's been filled with the holy ghost is there somebody that's been delivered have you been delivered a pornography have you been delivered of suicidal thoughts and tendencies have you been delivered from the the constant bombardment of evil thoughts on your mind has god ever delivered you then there ought to be a shout in the house of god this morning there ought to be an ability to praise god yay and amen oh god i love you oh god thank you thank you for your love thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you lord jesus for the word that you've sent me this last day that set me free oh hallelujah there wasn't no drugs there wasn't no alcohol there was nothing the world could offer me that could ever take the place of the love of god even though i went looking out there i ran way out there i looked far i looked wide i looked deep i looked all around and all i found was misery nothing could satisfy that hunger nothing could satisfy that crave oh but when i met the lord on the backside of a desert on those sacred stands when i met that pillar of fire and i was changed oh there was a joy there was a love there was a peace that set me free and set my soul on fire and there are people in the house of god that is on fire well you might as well get on fire i wish your soul would catch on fire well you know how to get set on fire you ever stood next to a fire you want to get set on fire it's there for you you get too close you get burned are you afraid this morning are you afraid of the holy ghost brother matthew you're preaching like a pentecostal well i don't think i'm preaching like pentecostalism i'm preaching like the original pentecost that the message came to restore us back to they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name and the baptism of the holy ghost came in jesus name what did it do it changed their language it changed their thinking it changed their perspective they were in that upper room a bunch of cowards backed up and scared from the roman soldiers and all the sadducees and pharisees but when that life that was in our lord was poured out into the church all of a sudden they come busting out the doors they come diving out the windows that's that men and brethren these are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was promised by the prophet oh hallelujah and there is a people that is here in bedford texas this morning that have been filled with the same power i think we ought to act like it i think we ought to talk like it i think we ought to shout like it i think we ought to live like it i think we ought to amen like it oh hallelujah well glory to god this is where i like to live i like to live in this presence i like to live where all things are possible i ain't talking about the church house i'm talking about in the word there's power in the word there's power in the message there's power in this message the word is navy even in my mouth and in thy heart well what did the message come to do everyone's going to preach a little bit what did the message come to do it come to return to restore the heart back to the original faith then that word that you have been restored to is in your heart but it's also supposed to be where in your mouth this word look take the book oh hallelujah eat it up thou must prophesy again that word that you're feeding on come on somebody that heart that's been restored let's put that word on our lips look power and of death and life is in the tongue and this message is a power to take the negative and make it a positive but go what is god wanting to do he wants to hear you talk well i don't know where we're going now when the children of israel entered into the promised land they come to jericho yeah they marched around seven days and seven times on the last days but what was the final act that brought the walls down what was the final thing the prophet told him that joshua told him to do he said after you fulfilled all the word after you've repented of your sins after you've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ after you've done all that i've commanded you to do i want you to shout and watch the walls come down oh i don't know what walls you're facing this morning i don't know what problems you're going through but god wants to hear you put that word on your mouth and say satan give way in the name of jesus christ oh well let me just say it for the prophet since i'm a little too fanatical for you since i'm just a little little too much and it's little old matthew but since we all believe the prophet we all press play and obey let's just read it from him the promise is yours but if you ever get it it ain't going to be easy i'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from satan satan captures your health help me now satan captures real you got a right to say satan you got a right to say see that wasn't my words you thought those were my words you thought i was taking some some historical uh story and trying to make something no no this is this is something that we have received by a vindicated prophet he's the one that changes your thinking he's the one that takes the negative and makes it a positive the vision that comes to the prophet becomes your reality oh oh i feel good about that one the vision that came to the prophet becomes your reality oh oh my thank you congress congressman upshaw he was sitting there up in the balcony christian man who had been believing who said never give up and i believe another thing he would always say is i'm going to get healed but it's not time yet and it took a profit to stand there and that could go into congressman upshaw's past that could come to his present but he could also go into his future don't you realize we have received a message a vindicated prophet that could go into your past that could go into the present but he also went into your future he told you where you come from oh i think that went over you he told you where you come from he told you where you're living and he told you where you're going the prophet's vision is your reality that's why you can stand in the face of hell raging on this planet in every demonic way and you can stand there and say this is the large doing this is the large what are you talking about brother don't you see the shootings don't you see the homosexuality don't you see the confusion and the darkness that's through the

crossed the line don't let satan tell you that i think if it was good then it's good now satan's whispering in your ear even right now somebody here just need to say shut up devil shut up devil i'm tired of you trying to tell me i got to be quiet in the house of god i'm tired of telling you i can't express my victory i'm tired of you telling me that i'm not the elect i'm tired of you telling me that i'm not the bride of jesus christ i'm tired of you telling me i'll never have my family i'm tired of you telling me i'll never have my joy well you might as well just get so tired that you say shut up devil this is the last time i come to serve notice on you well are we all free well sure sounds like it sounds like we got work to do i come to do work i come to put in work as there are people in the house of god that are free well i can just imagine on that day you know they had what they called a jubilee year and some of the young ones that were stronger you know they would climb up to the top of the mountain and what were they doing they were looking for the rising of the sun and when they would give up on the very top of the mountain they were looking for the rising of the sun and just as soon as they got a glimpse of the sunlight what was it it was their jubilee and god has sent us a prophet an eagle anointing that swore into the heavenlies and he looked out on there and he said it is the rising of the sun this is the year of jubilee throw down your hoe you don't have to be a task master anymore you don't have to be in bondage to that anymore come on i'm talking about freedom you think they all drop their hole in me like this we're free man it was a it was a tough few years in bondage oh my oh that's not what i did does somebody know what i'm talking about how did you act when you got delivered i don't care if if you were at a camp or in a church look i know where i was i was in my car i started active full i started breaking things i started getting rid of things all the peace of god come over my heart i couldn't stand still i had to tell everybody about it but one thing i knew i was three and who the son of god has made free is free indeed are you free this morning well then why don't you talk like it why don't you shout like it why don't you act like it i'm talking about stimulation we might be here a little bit a while i'm talking about stimulation of revelation trying to get a drunk man a man drunk and see what he does yeah and the prophet of god said revelation does you the same way the stimulation of revelation will make you act the same way as a drunk man a drunk man just gets so lost he don't even care who's around him he don't care what else is going on i wonder if there's somebody else in the house of god that'll just stop and forget about who's around you and what everything else is going on and you'd open up your heart and you would receive the word and realize that you don't have to sit under that oppression anymore that you can be set free with a joy in your heart to serve god every single day i'm talking about free i'm talking about freedom is there a people that have gathered in the house of god that are free well that sounds a little more like it now we can move on you pass that test oh glory to god look friends there's a power here this morning to turn your heart to change your body but it don't do no good on the outside don't do good no good to feel it in church don't do no good just to feel it at camp doesn't do no good to fill it at special services but you want that holy ghost that can lift you up into a heavenly sphere and you feel so free and you feel so clean and you go back home and you wonder why you falter and fail look let me tell that old devil to shut up it's for you that's in the name of the lord the holy ghost is for you god is showing you that there's more of the holy ghost for you to receive look i i'm just preaching what a vindicated prophet gave me this ain't my ideas this ain't my thoughts this is the message of the hour jesus will say if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth look with men it's impossible but with god all things are possible but but i want to lay this in there you have to respond to the word you say what are you talking about you know you could you can hear on the tape brother branham's discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and while he's discerning the heart while the word is going forth while the word is discerning your very thought of your heart and where you're living at you have to respond to that and say amen because while the prophet was preaching while he was discerning the thoughts of the of ours he says you missed it you missed it you have to respond to god's call i'll prove that it's right mr anderson you missed it oh don't miss it this morning don't miss it this morning god's doing something look that's the genesis of what i want to talk to you about god's doing something i want to encourage you that god is doing something look people get so confused they get so bent out of shape you know and they they tried oh we could go a long ways on this the prophecy of the brown bear unfolded just the way the prophet received the vision but the prophet wasn't in position for the manifestation of it he failed to be in position see and we need to get and what what did he say and the vision passed him by and he was left standing there now i want to tell you church we need to get right or we're going to get left standing we need to get right or we're going to get left standing because god is doing something god's word is unfolding right now this morning and what we want to do is we want to respond to the word and say yea and amen that is for me because i don't want to miss it i want to hear god's call and i want to respond to it what did you pass up look here's the good thing about the word of god that wasn't your only chance to serve notice on the devil brother matthew you got worked up and you were just running and screaming and shouting this is your chance this is your opportunity this is the word you can serve notice on the devil the word's coming to you why don't you respond to it claim them speak it look those walls will come down what do you have need of satan i come to serve notice on you you got something welling up in your heart you got something you're believing for come on well let faith go to work let faith go into action express it the word is naive in my mouth and even on your heart look the scripture says and while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on them look jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said this promises unto you and unto your children and them that are afar off i want to tell you you must respond to god's call look in genesis 12 that god called abraham he called abraham because god wanted to call abraham god has called you because he wanted to call you it wasn't about what abraham done it wasn't about what you can do but this is god's choosing what do you say i have chosen you according as he has chosen you before the foundation of the world that you should be holy and blameless who did that now i'm trying to to increase your faith i'm trying to to bring you to a place that god is doing something uh first peter 4 12 says beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange things happen to you now we're going to try to focus down here for a little bit along these lines he says beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials the the the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you see that's that's where we get ourselves in trouble we think it's so strange we're so confounded and dumbfounded god why would this ever have to happen and we just can't fathom it in our brain well god has it all in control he says but rejoice well there's a key but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy now i'd like to think about job for a little bit you know job did not have a clue of what was going on the fiery trials came at joe i tell you did they ever come at him none of us have ever faced what job had to face job didn't know what was going on job didn't know that there was a conversation in heaven between him and and the devil concerning him he didn't know that that god was up there saying hey have you considered my servant job that there is none like him in all the earth an upright man and perfect in his generation that issue of evil he didn't realize that there was words spoken of job and i just want to go on record to say this that if god had spoke that of job then there was nothing that job could do to change what god had spoken don't you realize that god got it all wrapped up with a pretty little bow on it god has already spoken on your behalf that you can't fail that you're predestinated not to miss it that you were chosen before the foundation of the world that your name was put in the lands book of life god was speaking the very victory concerning job and the devil took the bait glory to god because god had placed a mystery on the inside of job that the devil didn't know about even job didn't know about that there was something that had been deposited inside a job that no matter how bad the trial got no matter how much he lost no matter how much he wanted to give up there was an anchor there was something inside of job that before job could speak he would speak oh he lost all of his family he had lost all of his children all of his loved ones and everything was taken away and when it seemed like the devil had him right where if i could get a little more on the monitors it seemed like the devil had him right where he wanted him i got him now i got you right where i want you you're discouraged you don't know what's going to happen you're all you're all in turmoil and you're sad and you don't know what the future's going to hold and the devil's saying i got you you turn it down just a little i got you right where i want you and just when it seemed like the devil would have been telling all of his ips look at him i got him right where i want him he's on the ash heap he's about to throw in the towel he's about to wave wave the flag and there he was sitting down there on the ash sheep and all of a sudden he got up and the devil said look at him boys he's throwing in the white towel and he lift his head up his head oh blessed be the name of the lord the lord giveth and the lord taketh away though he slay me yet i'll trust him oh i wonder if the praise of job didn't shake the foundations of hell because it was a revelation that god had placed there that in the face of the trial in the face of the storm it come pouring out in praise unto god oh is there a praise in the bride of jesus christ that you can pour out to god that could say this is the lord's doing this is the lord's to it and it's marvelous in our eyes oh hallelujah well i'ma preach a little longer god wants to encourage you this morning look there was something in job that job didn't even know about joe didn't even know it was going to happen you know i was thinking on this and i got to thinking about brother brother biscuit you know brother biscuit was on that hunt they had been hearing the vision told the whole trip they were excited about the vision they were excited about the word of god typically when you're excited about something you talk about it so when the word of the lord had come to the prophet and he said because the vision is what it's thus saith the lord cannot fail so they were excited about thus saith the lord so you don't have to worry church we have thus saith the lord so they could be excited about the promises of god so they would pick up somebody to go on the trip like hey brother brandon tell them the vision yeah we were up there you know and there's there's there's a we shot a caribou and and you know we we shot it was laying on the ground i saw some of these young's hands going like this and it measured i believe 72 what was it 42 42 inches santa just measured it and his hand went up like this and they were like well you know we don't see anybody young on the trip yet but as they went along somebody couldn't make it somebody got back on and they get up and now they're in the hunt now they're in the battle now they're in the fulfillment of the vision but many times when you're walking in the vision you you become uh surrounded by by the the difficulties of the of the high you become surrounded by the difficulties of the journey and you start to lose sight of thus saith the lord and you forget why you're even there many times we forget why we're even here we forget why god has placed us in this hour for this purpose because there is a mystery inside of you that god wants to bring in the manifestation look god wants to use you to whoop the devil that's the way god ordained it he wants to use you to whoop the devil to take him at his word and say devil i come to serve

throw that away and she patches it up oh well she throws it on and he starts to go and he catches up and there's all of a sudden they're looking at the caribou laying there and all of a sudden their hands go up and brother ant says oh i have great empathy for the disciples to think that you're walking in the fulfillment you're walking in the manifestation of the vision and you've totally lost sight of what you're doing and he said but when that hand went all of a sudden all of a sudden he remembered the vision and realized the vision is now in manifestation and there he was standing in the vision wearing the green and yellow checkered shirt that was prophesied to be there see what he hallelujah it'll make you look at a green and yellow chuckled shirt differently it'll make you look at your trial differently you think you fell off the log you think you got wet you think you just got to change your clothes you're all disgruntled and you're all flustered because of the trial you're

revelation in the midst of the trial where you can rejoice and you can push away that devil and you can stand there in the presence of the enemy oh david said god has prepared a table for me in the

you you're just being carnal brother matthew you're just trying to work up the people well yeah you know what if the devil's telling me that means he don't like it that means he knows that there's

foundations of the world you were there i'm doing something i got it all in control in about that time oh the lightning was flashing and that revelation struck job oh and he could stand there and say oh hallelujah yet in my flesh those are skin worms eat my flesh though the situation is the most worst it could ever be i know i will stand and see my redeemer and all of the trial and all of the temptation and all of the storm there was a revelation that sprung forth and said this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous oh let's stand in our eyes it might look dark you might feel like job i need about two or three minutes look if you didn't come from come for something this morning that don't mean you can't get nothing maybe your vision maybe your angle has been changed maybe you've been in the journey and you've lost sight of what you're doing but you didn't even realize that you're walking right in the manifestation of the vision for your life yeah god knew you'd be sitting there in that shirt he knew you'd be wearing that color he'd be sitting on that side he knew this would be the moment he knew you'd respond to the call see it's in the midst of the trial and in the storm we have thus saith the lord that good's coming all things work together for the good there's none good but god and god is in his word and the word is naive even in my mouth and in my heart bring it from your heart put it on your lips look the prophet said we look at things that we do not see for abraham called those things which were not as though they were because he believed in god he called those things that were not as though they were if there is anybody on the face of this earth that can call things that are not as though they are it's you and this moment and this atmosphere where all things are possible you can put that word on your lips and start speaking things that are not in existence as though they are right now speak the word why cry brad speak you could play something softly see it just takes a little change of perspective faith has long-range vision faith is the master of all circumstances faith is a divine revelation jesus had perfect faith and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you this word abides in you that you will ask and it will be done for you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you've said what you've said the reason it hasn't happened maybe it's because you haven't spoken how can you believe what when you haven't even spoken it but why don't you speak it and let faith lay hold of it faith cometh by hearing the word i wonder if faith needs to hear it out of your own mouth well we're on shouting grounds now the lord like that faith wants to hear it out of your own mouth thou must prophesy again abraham where is the seeds of abraham that call things that are not as though they are start speaking church watch those walls come down watch the very desires of your heart coming to manifestation god has it all in control look it's hard to understand the pain [Music] it's hard to understand the hurt it's hard to understand the suffering it's hard the lord knows it's hard when that great sculpture takes out the hammer and he starts to chisel away that character starts to bring you into the vision he had for your life to bring you into that perfect image doesn't feel good but there's a revelation that's coming into your heart now to realize that this is the lord's doing it's the tender hand of jehovah it's the tender hand of jehovah see brother matthew how can you say that a prophet would say that some slaughter of six million jews and the holocaust the mailing of women and children by the millions was the tender hand of jehovah leading them back to the promised land don't you realize that same god can take your trial he can take your hurt he could take your pain he could take what you're going through see revelation takes the negative i know you were hurt when you were a child i know there's scars you feel like you'll never get over but there's a revelation here that's ready to grab a hold of the negative and develop the picture and to a positive and to my bride i'm pleased with you you're everything that i wanted my bride to be don't worry about your faults don't worry about your failures don't worry about the trials i'm doing something trust me why don't you just let the lord deal with your heart why did you let the holy spirit just come by your way right now why don't you
