[10:23] we pray father
[10:24] thank you amen
[10:28] amen good to be gathered in the presence
[10:30] of god man who want to welcome
[10:33] everyone in the house of god and all our
[10:35] visitors we welcome you this morning
[10:37] men are going to invite brother mike for
[10:39] us i'm reading god bless you
[11:01] go through the psalms and as we have
[11:04] and read all the many chapters where
[11:08] you know david or maybe one of the other
[11:10] psalmists is
[11:11] filling an entire chapter many verses
[11:14] many words
[11:16] praising the lord and of all the
[11:18] abundant testimonies and of all the
[11:19] works that he
[11:20] has done and just pages and pages and it
[11:23] just seems like not enough words could
[11:25] describe what the lord has done and you
[11:28] know david does probably better than
[11:29] most of us could
[11:30] in terms of putting words around the
[11:32] things that he's done
[11:34] but you know psalm 117 is noticeable
[11:39] with how short it is it's just two
[11:42] verses
[11:44] you know and it's um
[11:48] you know it caused me to take a look at
[11:49] that and
[11:51] what is it that could have happened here
[11:54] to cause david to take just two verses
[11:58] to make a point of praising the lord
[12:02] verse 2 psalm 117 verse 2 says this
[12:07] for his merciful kindness is great
[12:09] toward us
[12:11] and the truth of the lord endureth
[12:13] forever
[12:14] praise ye the lord and in just two
[12:18] little verses
[12:19] david is calling upon all the nations
[12:21] and all the people
[12:23] of the world to praise him
[12:27] and it makes me wonder what event what
[12:30] circumstance was going on that caused
[12:32] him to just squeeze in just
[12:34] two verses of time
[12:37] to praise the lord you know we probably
[12:40] will
[12:42] never know exactly what circumstance it
[12:46] was
[12:46] whether david was just returning from
[12:50] some great battle or was on the road and
[12:52] it encountered some trial
[12:54] but in the very small space of time that
[12:56] he had available to him
[12:59] whatever that was he took the time to
[13:01] praise the lord for two things
[13:04] for his mercy and for his truth
[13:10] you know and it made me wonder that you
[13:12] know in all the noise and all the
[13:14] busyness of life
[13:15] sometimes it's hard to find time to just
[13:18] pause
[13:20] and praise the lord and david in one of
[13:23] those times of busyness found just two
[13:25] verses worth of time and
[13:27] of all the things that he could have
[13:28] praised the lord for it was those two
[13:31] things
[13:32] mercy and truth
[13:35] you know it sort of made me wonder if a
[13:37] man after god's own heart
[13:39] is taking what little time he has if he
[13:41] has nothing else he has time to praise
[13:43] for it's those two things
[13:45] to maybe look at that a little bit
[13:49] there's another statement david makes
[13:50] here in verse 2 the truth of the lord
[13:53] endureth forever
[13:56] you know and how important that is to us
[13:58] in an
[13:59] hour when it seems that there's not one
[14:01] single statement
[14:02] one single fact one single message that
[14:05] lasts any more than the next news cycle
[14:08] before somebody's backtracking it or
[14:10] talking it back or apologizing for it
[14:12] and it seems like there's nothing that
[14:14] you can anchor in but his truth
[14:17] endureth forever you know it's funny
[14:20] when you look at the scriptures
[14:21] especially when you look at
[14:22] psalms there's only five things that
[14:25] david ever says
[14:26] endureth forever and by far
[14:30] the number one thing that he mentions
[14:32] more than anything else is his mercy
[14:35] his mercy endureth forever he mentions
[14:37] that 42 times
[14:39] in the psalms the next closest thing is
[14:42] his truth
[14:43] endureth forever you know and i thought
[14:46] it was significant
[14:48] that he filled that time
[14:52] just that little space of time that he
[14:53] had whatever it was
[14:56] to praise the lord for mercy and truth
[14:59] and you just look at that in the
[15:00] scriptures and those two things are tied
[15:01] together all the time
[15:03] in the scriptures mercy and truth mercy
[15:07] and truth you know what's interesting
[15:09] about those two things his mercy
[15:12] and his truth are ear marks of his hand
[15:15] upon your life those are two things that
[15:18] you would never know
[15:19] outside of a visitation from him
[15:23] so you look at his mercy and his truth
[15:25] and why
[15:26] we're so thankful for those is because
[15:29] if nothing else it gives evidence that
[15:31] god has come by our way
[15:33] we would not know his truth we would
[15:35] certainly not know his mercy
[15:37] had he not come by our way so how
[15:39] important it is to be able to point our
[15:41] finger
[15:42] at our lives in the circumstances of our
[15:44] lives and say praise the lord for his
[15:46] mercy
[15:47] praise the lord for his truth because
[15:49] he's come by my way
[15:51] and just a few of the scriptures you
[15:52] look at where the two are together
[15:54] this is interesting in hosea 4 1 hear
[15:57] the word of the lord ye children of
[15:59] israel
[16:00] for the lord hath the controversy with
[16:02] the inhabitants of the land because
[16:03] there is no truth
[16:06] nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the
[16:09] land
[16:10] this didn't come out of the dallas
[16:11] morning news this came out of the word
[16:13] of god
[16:14] and it's an ear mark of the absence of
[16:17] the lord
[16:18] in the land when mercy and truth cannot
[16:21] be found
[16:22] but you look at all the other scriptures
[16:24] psalm 25 10 all the paths of the lord
[16:26] are mercy and truth unto such as keep
[16:30] his covenant
[16:30] and his testimonies i like this one
[16:33] proverbs 3
[16:34] 3. let not mercy and truth forsake thee
[16:38] bind them about thy neck write them upon
[16:41] the table of thine heart
[16:44] proverbs 16 6 by mercy and truth
[16:47] iniquity is purged and by the fear of
[16:50] the lord men depart from evil
[16:53] and then there's proverbs 20 28 mercy
[16:56] and truth
[16:57] preserve the king the leader of the land
[17:00] and his throne is upholding my mercy
[17:05] praise the lord for mercy and truth
[17:08] because it's the evidence that
[17:09] god's hand is upon your life
[17:12] you can't have it without him so as we
[17:15] read this very short
[17:17] song you know i i just
[17:20] it was significance to me that in the
[17:22] little two verses that david had those
[17:24] were the two things he focused on and it
[17:26] caused me to stop and think
[17:27] you know praise the lord for his mercy
[17:30] for his enduring
[17:32] mercy praise the lord for his enduring
[17:34] truth
[17:36] in a time when nothing is enduring and
[17:39] it's an evidence
[17:40] that god's hand is upon her life
[17:43] so just wanted to call kind of share
[17:45] with you that that kind of caught my
[17:47] attention as we read this very short
[17:49] psalm psalm 117
[17:52] praise ye the lord all ye nations
[17:55] praise him all ye people for his
[17:58] merciful kindness
[18:00] is great toward us and the truth of the
[18:02] lord
[18:03] endureth forever praise ye the lord
[18:14] amen god bless you man you may be seated
[18:23] man let's sing that song castro burdens
[18:25] unto jesus
[18:27] for he cares for you this morning amen

[48:34] but you said that you would never leave
[48:36] us nor forsake us
[48:38] but that you'd be with us even in us
[48:41] till the end
[48:42] father we trust in those words today
[48:46] and we ask that you bless our effort
[48:48] here this morning
[48:49] to set our hearts to the
[48:54] task of following this message we ask
[48:57] you to be with us this morning as we
[49:00] look to your word for our substance
[49:05] father and our hope
[49:08] father for our leadership we just ask
[49:10] that you would guide us this morning
[49:13] and be with us for we ask these things
[49:16] in the precious and wonderful name of
[49:19] the lord jesus we pray
[49:21] amen and amen god bless you
[49:24] this morning you may be seated
[49:30] we are going to continue on
[49:34] sort of what the lord had
[49:37] placed on our heart and that was to
[49:41] go through some of the messages that
[49:44] brother bran preached in 1965
[49:48] and in instead of just taking a quote
[49:51] from here and a quote from there
[49:53] and putting them together but
[49:58] just to maybe to spend a little time
[50:01] and just go through a message
[50:05] slowly a few pages
[50:08] at a time and see all the riches
[50:13] that are contained within
[50:16] the great scope of his word
[50:20] and i certainly have come
[50:23] to realize that there's only one thing
[50:27] that can navigate
[50:29] this hour that we live in and
[50:32] and that's the the message of the hour
[50:36] the end time condition satan appears as
[50:40] an
[50:40] angel of light and it seems like
[50:43] so many of the things that he's offering
[50:46] are logical and uh they're
[50:50] understandable
[50:51] and and with reason uh
[50:55] you could easily accept what that he
[50:58] would have to
[50:59] offer but there's a voice in this date
[51:04] that has a sure path
[51:07] and assure vision of where that we
[51:10] go and we need to be so
[51:14] connected with it
[51:17] but i'd like to just read a few
[51:19] statements before we start we're going
[51:21] to start today in easter seal
[51:24] it's the next message after who is this
[51:27] melchizedek
[51:29] and i'm going to go through it with you
[51:33] and just each section that we we listen
[51:36] to
[51:37] and that we study and that we read so if
[51:40] you have
[51:41] i guess nowadays you can have your uh
[51:44] the message on your tablet
[51:45] or your phone or if you haven't if
[51:48] you're old-fashioned like i am you have
[51:50] a book
[51:51] and a marker and
[51:55] i kind of uh laughed i had
[51:58] who is this melchizedek so marked up
[52:02] that i couldn't find anything and
[52:05] so i some paragraphs i had three stars
[52:09] next to because i was going to read that
[52:11] one and
[52:12] the date and it's just so bountiful rich
[52:16] i just don't know what the rest of the
[52:18] church world feeds on
[52:21] you know i mean this is such a
[52:23] magnificent
[52:25] food but so we're going to look at that
[52:27] so if you could put up like paragraph
[52:30] for easter seal paragraph 46
[52:33] and uh
[52:37] you know i i believe brother branham
[52:40] always kind of lays the platform
[52:43] out in the beginning of where that he
[52:46] wants
[52:46] us to look to take us and
[52:50] i just want to read a few of paragraphs
[52:53] and then
[52:53] we'll stand in re with the scriptures he
[52:56] reads
[52:57] and i think we're going to listen to 28
[52:59] minutes
[53:00] this morning but this paragraph in
[53:03] paragraph
[53:04] 46 he says
[53:08] now notice the very essence
[53:12] of this resurrection is
[53:15] to tell and to show
[53:19] and to prove that jesus
[53:22] has raised up from the dead
[53:26] he's not dead he's living
[53:30] he lives here he's
[53:34] in us i'll be with you
[53:38] even in you a little while
[53:41] the world seeth me no more
[53:44] yet ye shall see me for
[53:47] i will be with you
[53:51] even in you until the end of
[53:54] the world i believe there's a desire
[53:58] in the heart of the believer for that to
[54:01] become a reality
[54:04] a reality and we have to remember that
[54:06] we have an
[54:07] enemy that fights that reality
[54:11] uh there he is trying to show another
[54:14] reality that's what he did in the garden
[54:17] of eden
[54:18] he went to eve and said no surely you
[54:22] won't die
[54:23] there's another reality over here
[54:26] something else for you that uh
[54:29] if if you partake of this that you'll be
[54:32] wise and you'll know all things and
[54:35] and uh he enticed her into leaving the
[54:39] simplicity of the word of god which was
[54:42] the day
[54:43] you eat is the day that you die
[54:47] and i i don't know would any of you now
[54:51] give up the garden of eden for what we
[54:54] have now
[54:55] i don't think so i mean he's a liar the
[54:59] satan is a liar
[55:00] he's the father of lies so that's what
[55:04] we read down
[55:04] and and i i think this is what he says
[55:07] now as christians
[55:11] we all claim he is alive
[55:15] or we've been quickened quickened from
[55:20] life
[55:21] from death to life but his spirit
[55:24] by his spirit and if
[55:28] we haven't been quickened then we
[55:31] have not been made alive
[55:35] now this is what i'm this is kind of
[55:38] what he's going to go into he says
[55:40] he says now we're going to break into
[55:44] this subject
[55:45] the lord willing and kind of
[55:48] teach it for a few minutes
[55:52] how that we are quickened and can
[55:56] be sure that this is the truth
[56:03] now this is your own life
[56:06] this is my life
[56:11] it's where that if it
[56:14] isn't true what i'm fixing to say
[56:19] then i'm one of the most foolish people
[56:22] in the world i've given my
[56:25] life for something there's nothing to
[56:29] so have you but if it is true
[56:33] then i owe everything that
[56:37] i am i owe everything
[56:40] that i could be
[56:45] don't let that slip by everything that i
[56:47] could
[56:48] be i owe everything that i could
[56:52] be to the cause
[56:55] of which we're standing for and i think
[56:59] that we must mustn't lose
[57:03] our enthusiasm that's
[57:06] that's it that's a very hard thing to
[57:10] keep your enthusiasm
[57:12] especially when the great uh
[57:15] times are struggling uh if if we could
[57:20] just for a second and if if i would
[57:22] title a sermon it's probably not very
[57:24] fair for me to title his sermon
[57:27] when we're just going to listen to it
[57:30] but i would probably call it the
[57:33] possession of the believer
[57:37] but let's read paragraph just
[57:40] for the second so we can
[57:44] turn our hearts to this message
[57:48] it says as jesus said
[57:51] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[57:55] and prove to them by
[57:59] demonstrating the power of god
[58:02] to them these signs shall follow them
[58:05] that believe
[58:08] them who promise and say
[58:11] they believe he's
[58:15] given us a definite understanding of it
[58:21] that these signs would follow them
[58:24] that believe it would be the
[58:27] proof of our testimony
[58:31] now we say we believe
[58:35] but until we are
[58:38] have the proven sign
[58:42] that he said that would be upon us
[58:46] then we are just confessing
[58:50] to be believers and not the possession
[58:54] of believers so
[58:57] that realizes that we could find
[59:00] ourselves
[59:01] in a state where we've kind of been
[59:05] unenthusiastic that we've
[59:08] got to the place where we believe
[59:12] but we have stopped
[59:16] proving yep you know what i mean to that
[59:20] we we've we've stopped demonstrating and
[59:24] proving that he is alive
[59:27] and uh we we certainly we we certainly
[59:32] don't want to be believers but we want
[59:34] to have the possession
[59:36] of believers yeah so if i could say
[59:40] that what that he's talking about here
[59:43] he says on what i'm going to teach and
[59:45] what i want us to understand that there
[59:47] is a possession
[59:49] that the believer has it
[59:52] is a kind of a seal
[59:55] he calls it a seal it is a
[59:59] something that the believer possesses
[1:00:02] and it's a quickening power
[1:00:07] now and so uh i like i'm
[1:00:10] reading backwards but uh
[1:00:13] i'm doing that for a reason nick i'd
[1:00:15] like if you would to turn to paragraph
[1:00:17] 32.
[1:00:23] so i i've read backwards so we could
[1:00:26] kind of when we go forward
[1:00:29] we can understand that he's trying to
[1:00:31] gather up our minds
[1:00:33] he's he's trying to he's trying to get
[1:00:36] us to settle down for a moment
[1:00:39] get out from the the trouble of what's
[1:00:43] going around in the world and everything
[1:00:46] and realize that there's something that
[1:00:49] we can possess
[1:00:51] something that he's got for us something
[1:00:54] to give
[1:00:54] us something that belongs
[1:00:57] to the believer and it's something that
[1:01:00] the
[1:01:01] enemy is trying to rob from you
[1:01:05] and that's kind of sad to think that
[1:01:09] there's somebody
[1:01:10] out there that's always trying to steal
[1:01:13] something from you take something from
[1:01:15] you if he doesn't want you to possess
[1:01:18] this power in fact his whole mission
[1:01:21] in life is to disprove
[1:01:25] everything that god said
[1:01:28] that's what he does that's isn't that
[1:01:30] what the scripture tells us he tries to
[1:01:32] make
[1:01:33] the word of god of none effect
[1:01:39] and and one of the things he does this
[1:01:42] is he burdens us
[1:01:43] uh with uncertainty and and i think
[1:01:47] that's the biggest thing i hear
[1:01:49] today is nobody's certain we're not
[1:01:52] certain of the economy
[1:01:53] we're no longer certain of our health
[1:01:56] you know what i mean we're no longer
[1:02:00] certain of this and certain of that
[1:02:04] but we're certain they don't know what's
[1:02:08] going to happen we
[1:02:09] know what's going to happen you know
[1:02:12] what i mean
[1:02:14] this is our if i could say this great
[1:02:17] easter seal
[1:02:19] is our ticket out of here
[1:02:23] right if the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:02:25] jesus christ dwell in you
[1:02:27] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:02:30] look you understand so now he's trying
[1:02:32] to tell us what we just read
[1:02:35] not only what it is but how that we get
[1:02:38] it
[1:02:39] and how that we can trust in it and
[1:02:42] believe in it
[1:02:43] and know that it's true in other words
[1:02:46] not question what it is that you possess
[1:02:52] notre no matter how much the accuser
[1:02:56] tries to steal it from you take it away
[1:02:59] from you
[1:03:00] tell you you don't have it try to do
[1:03:04] whatever he can
[1:03:05] to say if thou be the christ come down
[1:03:08] off the cross
[1:03:10] if thou turn these stones to this if
[1:03:12] thou
[1:03:13] be this do this do that no you're
[1:03:15] settled
[1:03:16] you know my sheep hear my voice and
[1:03:19] another they will not follow
[1:03:21] they're angered into the word of god
[1:03:24] they're anchored in they understand
[1:03:26] what god did in this generation by
[1:03:29] fulfilling malachi 4
[1:03:31] 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10
[1:03:34] 7 they're fixed they they know they've
[1:03:38] got a voice they know they've got a
[1:03:40] shepherd
[1:03:41] they know they've got a spirit that's
[1:03:43] leading them and guiding and all
[1:03:45] truth and just think of this in an hour
[1:03:48] of uncertainty
[1:03:50] where everybody out in the world's
[1:03:52] cooking up all kinds of ideas
[1:03:57] you know what i mean that that every
[1:04:00] group
[1:04:00] is attacking every other button
[1:04:02] everybody wants a little bit
[1:04:04] of their knowledge and a little bit of
[1:04:07] their ideas
[1:04:08] in the whole mix that there is a
[1:04:11] storehouse
[1:04:14] you understand a prophetic food
[1:04:18] that has been laid up
[1:04:21] for us
[1:04:24] that we can go to can we can
[1:04:28] feed on and we have a god
[1:04:31] that stands behind it and brings it to
[1:04:35] pass
[1:04:36] and proves it that this is the
[1:04:40] food the manna that will sustain you
[1:04:43] in this great hour of famine
[1:04:49] because famine is promised famine is
[1:04:54] thus
[1:04:55] saith the lord there will come a day
[1:04:57] when there will be a famine
[1:04:59] on the land not for food
[1:05:02] and meat but for the pure word of god
[1:05:07] that's where the famine is and it does
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:11] the tr and the pure word of god so
[1:05:14] there is such the the famine now
[1:05:17] is so noticeable
[1:05:21] that every every man
[1:05:24] has become a cook and he's trying to
[1:05:28] cook the word up
[1:05:29] into something that will satisfy you
[1:05:35] pulling this from here and that from
[1:05:37] there and making this up and making that
[1:05:40] up and you know why because it's human
[1:05:43] nature
[1:05:43] they got tired of the manna that was
[1:05:46] sustaining them
[1:05:51] and what did he give them he'd give them
[1:05:53] locusts he gave them until
[1:05:55] they loathed it in other words they
[1:05:58] hated that
[1:05:59] more than they hated the manna
[1:06:03] and i'll tell you something there's
[1:06:04] nothing there's
[1:06:06] nothing that's going to guide us out of
[1:06:09] here
[1:06:10] and feed the true soul of the believer
[1:06:13] but the stored food that's been stored
[1:06:17] up for us
[1:06:19] it's not dead manna because the spirit
[1:06:24] put it in there you understand and he
[1:06:27] knew
[1:06:28] that he would take it out in season and
[1:06:31] that he would
[1:06:32] quicken it to us and make it
[1:06:35] life to us
[1:06:38] i certainly don't want to uh
[1:06:42] you know compare it to something that
[1:06:44] you put in the freezer
[1:06:48] you know what i mean and then you
[1:06:50] unthought
[1:06:51] because this wasn't cooked
[1:06:54] and then put in for another day it was
[1:06:57] setting in there
[1:06:58] and it was going to become alive in the
[1:07:02] day
[1:07:03] that it was brought out
[1:07:06] so you know we're not looking back on a
[1:07:09] finished message
[1:07:11] we're looking back on the messenger
[1:07:15] that brought us living word that was
[1:07:18] going to
[1:07:18] carry us through every hour every
[1:07:21] situation
[1:07:22] every circumstance that we could grab
[1:07:24] hold of it
[1:07:25] be anchored in it and understand it's a
[1:07:29] live
[1:07:29] word it's not theology it's not
[1:07:32] doctrine it's not something of the day
[1:07:35] gone by
[1:07:36] it was none other than the plan of god
[1:07:39] to say that i'm gonna sustain a people
[1:07:42] and take them through he did it in the
[1:07:44] first exodus
[1:07:45] he did it in the second exodus and he
[1:07:48] has to do it in this exodus also
[1:07:52] just like we saw the the three uh
[1:07:56] expressions of melchizedek
[1:08:00] the first time he came right he blew up
[1:08:03] a body
[1:08:04] the word of god god in the form
[1:08:07] showing abraham whatever son would be
[1:08:11] and then he came down in flesh not
[1:08:14] sinful flesh
[1:08:15] but first of all it wasn't even flesh
[1:08:18] through
[1:08:18] birth the second he said you no longer
[1:08:20] hear malchester
[1:08:22] he comes down and he becomes jesus he
[1:08:25] comes through
[1:08:26] in human flesh through a birth
[1:08:29] there he is veiled in jesus emorphy
[1:08:33] changing forms fail and then he comes a
[1:08:35] third time
[1:08:36] in our day veiled in the ministry of
[1:08:40] sinful flesh
[1:08:42] redeemed by the blood doing the same
[1:08:44] words
[1:08:47] ma
[1:08:50] go over here to first baptist and have
[1:08:53] them sit there and tell you melchizedek
[1:08:55] showed up in this day
[1:08:57] in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17
[1:09:00] 30 revelation
[1:09:02] you know what they call you heretic
[1:09:05] antichrist but i'm like paul and the way
[1:09:08] they call heresy
[1:09:10] so do i worship the law
[1:09:14] just think of it you you understand we
[1:09:17] can't lose our enthusiasm
[1:09:21] we can't get to the place that when we
[1:09:22] listen to this messenger
[1:09:24] who was the voice of god to us laying
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:28] food in there for us that oh that's not
[1:09:31] a good service
[1:09:34] you know no we've got to say okay i'm
[1:09:37] going to listen for 28 minutes i'm going
[1:09:39] to
[1:09:39] listen for 28 minutes
[1:09:43] i don't need to be stirred up from the
[1:09:45] outside by
[1:09:46] emotion i need to be fed
[1:09:49] from the inside i need something that
[1:09:52] comes
[1:09:53] deep in in the hollow of my heart
[1:10:00] and and this does something for us
[1:10:04] so let's let's turn to uh
[1:10:08] to paragraph um
[1:10:14] 32.
[1:10:20] he's talking we know this is called
[1:10:22] easter seal so he's talking
[1:10:24] about a resurrection he's going to go
[1:10:26] very far in this message
[1:10:29] to actually to the resurrection of the
[1:10:31] lord in us
[1:10:33] he said but easter proved it
[1:10:36] it sealed the word of god forever
[1:10:42] for the true believer it sealed the word
[1:10:46] of god
[1:10:47] forever for the true believer
[1:10:51] why does every word of us is so
[1:10:54] important to us
[1:10:55] because we know he's
[1:10:58] alive and he's here
[1:11:02] and he keeps his word
[1:11:06] what a comfort i will not leave you
[1:11:09] comfortless
[1:11:10] but i'll come again i'll be with you
[1:11:12] even
[1:11:13] in you till the end i'll send you the
[1:11:15] spirit of truth
[1:11:17] who shall lead you and guide you in all
[1:11:20] truth and righteousness
[1:11:22] but easter proved it it sealed the word
[1:11:25] of god
[1:11:27] forever for the true believer all
[1:11:30] gloom and doubt was scattered
[1:11:35] at that blessed morning
[1:11:38] man had been shut up as it was
[1:11:42] in a prison house even to religious
[1:11:46] people before this day
[1:11:49] because they had been
[1:11:52] seen great religious moves and the
[1:11:55] moving of the holy spirit
[1:11:57] and so forth but when a man died
[1:12:01] it seemed to settle it
[1:12:04] but when this one came and said
[1:12:08] i have power to lay my life down
[1:12:12] i have power to take it up again
[1:12:16] and then go prove what he said
[1:12:20] now listen to this prove what he said
[1:12:23] to me that's the seal
[1:12:27] of it when something is said
[1:12:31] and then is turned around
[1:12:34] and proven
[1:12:37] so the seal
[1:12:41] easter seal talking about giving us
[1:12:44] this seal he's going to give us
[1:12:47] something
[1:12:48] you understand that we can not just
[1:12:51] believe
[1:12:51] but possess right
[1:12:54] that that when we say something
[1:12:58] we can turn around and prove it
[1:13:05] now think of that you having something
[1:13:09] a possession a quickening power
[1:13:13] that you have that will
[1:13:16] prove what that you say
[1:13:21] what you believe that's the true seal
[1:13:25] that's the difference between believing
[1:13:28] the trains coming
[1:13:30] and believing the trains going and
[1:13:33] having a ticket
[1:13:34] to get on it and then before we listen
[1:13:40] let's read the paragraph uh
[1:13:43] uh just read a paragraph here
[1:13:48] in 35
[1:13:52] and when he proved by his promise
[1:13:55] this great conquering power that he had
[1:13:59] on easter
[1:14:01] he proved that he could conquer death
[1:14:05] hell and the grave
[1:14:08] i am he that was dead and in this
[1:14:11] alive again and alive forevermore
[1:14:16] and have the keys to death hell in the
[1:14:19] grave
[1:14:20] all right amen he's got the key
[1:14:24] amen what would you do if he promised
[1:14:26] you that key
[1:14:29] okay that he was going to make you a
[1:14:32] duplicate
[1:14:35] right that now you have the power
[1:14:39] to conquer death hell in the grave
[1:14:42] now you have the power to
[1:14:46] prove that what you say and see it
[1:14:49] come to pass amen this is what he's
[1:14:52] talking about that's the true seal
[1:14:55] is when you can prove it so he can't
[1:14:58] give you a seal like a sticky thing
[1:15:03] which he goes in here about the the
[1:15:06] easter seal from what was that
[1:15:08] tuberculosis thing
[1:15:09] they sold easter seals you stuck them on
[1:15:11] your envelope
[1:15:12] he said this ain't a sticky thing
[1:15:16] you know this isn't a label
[1:15:19] that you stick on you know and then you
[1:15:22] you gotta when you don't believe it
[1:15:24] anymore you've got to go get some goof
[1:15:26] off
[1:15:27] to get it off and usually that's what
[1:15:30] you find that people are getting rid of
[1:15:31] the label
[1:15:32] of christianity in this message they're
[1:15:35] out there goofing off
[1:15:40] i had to say that
[1:15:43] he said he says what a statement
[1:15:46] for anyone to make and not only did he
[1:15:50] make it
[1:15:52] but he already proved that
[1:15:55] he had what he claimed
[1:16:00] now this is where we're trying to go
[1:16:02] with our study
[1:16:06] and i think god hastens
[1:16:09] the day that when we
[1:16:13] as christians who believe this bible
[1:16:16] can prove what we are talking
[1:16:20] about see
[1:16:23] that's what makes as i said a while ago
[1:16:28] the salt of the earth
[1:16:32] the sister said that's right the world
[1:16:36] is looking for this salt
[1:16:39] and when we can prove by our lives
[1:16:44] and by the bible that our lives
[1:16:47] are vindicating that word
[1:16:50] to be living today
[1:16:53] that's the day we're
[1:16:56] looking for
[1:17:01] isn't that what we're looking for
[1:17:05] that's the day we're looking for
[1:17:08] and i i believe with all my heart
[1:17:12] that the believer recognizes that
[1:17:16] there is something on the
[1:17:20] just right by us here that is going to
[1:17:24] unite with
[1:17:24] us that that day
[1:17:28] so if we're hastening that day and god's
[1:17:31] hastening that day
[1:17:33] that day has got to come
[1:17:36] and i believe there's a sense in the
[1:17:39] true believer that that day
[1:17:41] is here and when we listen to the last
[1:17:46] uh paragraph that we're going to listen
[1:17:50] to this morning we're going to go from
[1:17:52] paragraph
[1:17:54] of 30
[1:17:57] 23 through
[1:18:01] paragraph
[1:18:05] 67 and
[1:18:08] we'll make a little comment but as you
[1:18:12] look for that look at those things
[1:18:13] brother brahms wove those things in
[1:18:15] there
[1:18:16] so he's trying to tell these people
[1:18:18] there's something that god's got for you
[1:18:21] it lies within this message
[1:18:27] okay it's not we're not trying to go
[1:18:30] back
[1:18:31] and recreate pentecost we're not trying
[1:18:34] to go back
[1:18:35] but there is a a new day an
[1:18:40] opening of the word a turning of a
[1:18:43] corner
[1:18:44] there's something that's alive and new
[1:18:47] for us in this day it lies within the
[1:18:51] message
[1:18:52] that god brings it comes by faith
[1:18:55] it comes by quickening of the word and
[1:18:58] revelation of the word
[1:19:00] so if i know that this quickening power
[1:19:02] lies in that word
[1:19:05] then i want to hear that word
[1:19:08] you understand you understand why that i
[1:19:11] i'm taking this time
[1:19:13] to play this tape and not create just a
[1:19:16] good
[1:19:17] service this morning where we pray for
[1:19:19] the sick and we worship god
[1:19:21] but let's get down deeper let's get in
[1:19:24] there and
[1:19:25] feast on god's word let's realize that
[1:19:28] it's in
[1:19:29] that word that that quickening
[1:19:32] resurrection power lies
[1:19:36] man has been probing at the bible and
[1:19:38] teaching the bible and
[1:19:40] claiming the promises of the bible but
[1:19:43] there's got to do
[1:19:44] something with this hour
[1:19:49] that creates it in us and that's the
[1:19:52] last statement you're going to hear
[1:19:54] so let's stand together if you would
[1:19:58] 28 minutes that's not long to
[1:20:00] concentrate
[1:20:02] it might be for some of us but uh
[1:20:06] and we're gonna uh turn to the
[1:20:09] chap of matthew the
[1:20:12] 28th chapter
[1:20:15] and we'll read there and i believe he
[1:20:17] also reads in
[1:20:19] romans the eighth chapter so and then
[1:20:22] also revelations the first
[1:20:24] chapter so he's going to have three
[1:20:26] scripture readings
[1:20:28] you can read along on the board or you
[1:20:30] can read in your bible
[1:20:32] and let's just sit back and listen to
[1:20:34] this 28 minutes
[1:20:36] be attentive uh to it and i i think that
[1:20:40] as we
[1:20:41] go forward into this
[1:20:44] message i believe we're going to enjoy
[1:20:47] it
[1:20:48] as god's servant opens the word
[1:20:51] to us amen aren't you glad god's opened
[1:20:55] your eyes
[1:20:56] oh praise the lord amen god bless you
[1:20:59] this morning
[1:21:00] amen as we listen to our messenger
[1:21:02] william branham
[1:21:05] and this is kind of a little pre-easter
[1:21:09] message lord willing about 40 minutes
[1:21:13] now let's read from saint matthew's
[1:21:15] gospel the 28th chapter beginning
[1:21:19] in the end of the sabbath as it began to
[1:21:21] dawn towards the first day of the week
[1:21:23] came mary
[1:21:24] magdalena and the other married to
[1:21:28] see the sepulcher and behold there was a
[1:21:30] great
[1:21:31] earthquake for the angel of the lord
[1:21:35] descended from heaven and came and
[1:21:37] rolled back the stone
[1:21:39] from the door and sat upon it his
[1:21:42] countenances was like lightning and his
[1:21:45] raiment
[1:21:46] wide as snow and for
[1:21:49] fear of him the quakers did the keepers
[1:21:53] part of me did shape
[1:21:55] and became his dead man and the
[1:21:58] angel answered and said unto the women
[1:22:01] fear ye not for
[1:22:05] i know that you seek jesus which was
[1:22:07] crucified
[1:22:09] he is not here for he is
[1:22:12] risen as he said
[1:22:15] come and see the place where the lord
[1:22:17] lay
[1:22:19] and go quickly and tell his disciples
[1:22:22] that he is risen from the dead and
[1:22:25] behold he goeth before you into galilee
[1:22:29] there shall ye see him lord i have told
[1:22:34] you
[1:22:35] and they departed quickly from the
[1:22:37] sepulcher
[1:22:39] with fear and great joy and did run and
[1:22:42] bring the disciples word
[1:22:45] and as they went to tell his disciples
[1:22:48] behold
[1:22:49] jesus met them seeing all hail
[1:22:53] and they came and held him by the feet
[1:22:56] and worship him then said jesus unto
[1:22:59] them
[1:23:01] be not afraid go tell my brethren
[1:23:05] that they go into galilee and there
[1:23:08] shall they see me
[1:23:11] in revelations the first chapter
[1:23:14] and the 17th and 18th verse
[1:23:18] and when i saw him i
[1:23:22] fell at his feet as dead
[1:23:25] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:23:28] saying
[1:23:29] unto me fear not
[1:23:32] i am the first and the last
[1:23:35] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:23:38] behold i am alive forevermore
[1:23:41] amen and have the keys
[1:23:44] of death and hell
[1:23:48] and in the book of romans
[1:23:51] the eighth chapter
[1:23:55] and beginning with the 11th first
[1:23:59] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:24:02] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:24:06] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:24:10] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:24:13] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:24:17] now i trust that the lord jesus will add
[1:24:21] his blessings to the readings
[1:24:22] of these words
[1:24:26] seeing that easter and i have stamped
[1:24:30] it in my own heart as the
[1:24:33] greatest meeting or the greatest event
[1:24:37] of the year i want to
[1:24:40] ask you to pardon me in a moment isn't
[1:24:42] that kind of blaring out there to you
[1:24:44] kind of a roaring is it all right can
[1:24:46] you hear it all right like that
[1:24:48] you can't hear it is that better right
[1:24:51] like that i
[1:24:52] didn't want to get too close
[1:24:56] now why i
[1:24:59] say this is because that easter he
[1:25:03] proved what the bible
[1:25:06] had said all the scripture that was
[1:25:10] written of him to do he
[1:25:12] sealed his messiah ship when he rose
[1:25:15] from the dead
[1:25:18] the easter seal we have so much of it
[1:25:21] today we
[1:25:22] talk about that buying easter seals
[1:25:26] well i want to speak this morning on the
[1:25:28] easter seal
[1:25:30] it's a different seal than what we buy
[1:25:34] with our money as a seal to go on
[1:25:38] letters for i think the tuberculosis
[1:25:44] association of whatever they call it i
[1:25:48] i think this seal is a little different
[1:25:51] seal
[1:25:53] and being that easter is the great
[1:25:56] day of the year for we christians who
[1:26:00] claim to be god's children i want to try
[1:26:03] to
[1:26:04] break into it and see how
[1:26:08] we should be fellowshipped with this
[1:26:10] great
[1:26:11] thing that christ did for us
[1:26:15] the word of god was spoken
[1:26:18] many many hundreds of years before his
[1:26:21] coming
[1:26:22] of his crucifixion and of his death
[1:26:26] and of his suffering and also of his
[1:26:28] resurrection we'll be going through
[1:26:30] these services perhaps
[1:26:32] next week as we listen to our our radio
[1:26:35] programs and in our churches
[1:26:37] with our pastors and so forth uh this
[1:26:40] coming week
[1:26:42] but of all the days and all of the
[1:26:45] things that jesus
[1:26:46] did and certainly appreciating all of
[1:26:49] his
[1:26:50] vindication of god's word
[1:26:54] and what he did to fulfill it of healing
[1:26:56] the
[1:26:57] sick raising the dead casting out
[1:27:00] devils preaching the gospel to the poor
[1:27:03] and fulfilling every word that god
[1:27:06] said that he would do when he came
[1:27:09] and then also suffering for our sins and
[1:27:12] our stead to be the propitiation for our
[1:27:14] sin
[1:27:15] at the cross where no one else could
[1:27:17] have done it but
[1:27:18] him but above all of that
[1:27:22] i think easter seal the whole thing
[1:27:25] because there had been prophets on the
[1:27:27] earth who had prophesied before him
[1:27:29] there had been prophets on the earth who
[1:27:31] had healed the sick even raised the dead
[1:27:33] and done the same signs that jesus did
[1:27:37] but easter proved it it sealed the word
[1:27:41] of god forever
[1:27:42] for the true believer all gloom and
[1:27:46] doubt
[1:27:46] was shattered at that blissful morning
[1:27:49] man had been
[1:27:50] shut up as it was in a prison house even
[1:27:53] to
[1:27:53] religious people before this day because
[1:27:56] they had been
[1:27:58] seen great religious moves and moving of
[1:28:01] the holy spirit
[1:28:02] and so forth but when a man died it
[1:28:04] seemed to settle it
[1:28:06] but when this one came and said i have
[1:28:08] power to lay my life down i have power
[1:28:11] to take it up again
[1:28:12] and then go prove what he said to me
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:16] that's the seal of it when uh when
[1:28:18] something is
[1:28:19] said and then uh it's turned around and
[1:28:22] proven
[1:28:23] if a man said like columbus believed the
[1:28:26] world was round
[1:28:27] and he watched the ships as we were told
[1:28:29] how they come in and you could see the
[1:28:31] mass way before you could see the ship
[1:28:33] and it proved him that the world was
[1:28:35] round people didn't believe that that
[1:28:36] day
[1:28:37] but he was a man of vision he set out
[1:28:40] to prove exactly what he had a vision of
[1:28:44] that was the truth and god
[1:28:47] purposed to prove his word the truth
[1:28:51] so he there was only one man that could
[1:28:53] do that and that was jesus and he come
[1:28:55] and
[1:28:56] proved that to be the truth it sealed it
[1:29:00] and that broke all the seals of gloom
[1:29:03] and scattered all the
[1:29:05] the superstitions of other religions and
[1:29:07] so forth where a great man
[1:29:08] has raised up and said great marvelous
[1:29:10] things but they're everyone in the grave
[1:29:13] but our christian religion is the only
[1:29:15] one who has an
[1:29:16] empty tomb and that proves to me
[1:29:20] that he is a god of the dead and god all
[1:29:24] the living
[1:29:25] that he can raise up the dead uh back to
[1:29:28] life again
[1:29:30] and uh this quickening power
[1:29:34] quicken in spirit of his
[1:29:37] has proved through the years that he is
[1:29:40] the one who can quicken the dead back to
[1:29:43] life again
[1:29:45] and when he proved by his promise this
[1:29:47] great conquering
[1:29:49] power that he had on easter he proved
[1:29:52] that he could
[1:29:53] conquer death hell and the great
[1:29:56] that's it i am he that was dead
[1:30:00] and is alive again and alive forevermore
[1:30:04] and have the keys that to death hell in
[1:30:07] the grave
[1:30:08] what a a statement for anyone to make
[1:30:12] and not only did he make it but he had
[1:30:15] already proved that he he had what he
[1:30:18] claimed to have and i think
[1:30:21] god hastened the day that when we as
[1:30:25] christians who believe this bible can
[1:30:28] prove what we're talking about
[1:30:31] see that's what makes is the said a
[1:30:34] while ago the salt
[1:30:36] of the earth the sister said that's
[1:30:38] right the world is looking for this soul
[1:30:41] and when we can prove by our lives and
[1:30:44] by the bible
[1:30:46] uh that our lives are vindicating that
[1:30:49] word to be living today
[1:30:51] that that's the day we're looking for
[1:30:54] the word this spirit romans 8
[1:30:57] there that 11 said if this spirit that
[1:31:01] raised
[1:31:02] up jesus christ be in you
[1:31:05] will also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:31:09] not only did he
[1:31:12] prove to him to us that he was
[1:31:16] a jehovah redeemer and had
[1:31:19] power over death hell and the grave
[1:31:23] but he has also given us the access
[1:31:27] to the same spirit that we ourselves can
[1:31:31] have the assurance
[1:31:33] that we too are quickened by that spirit
[1:31:37] for the spirit that raised up jesus
[1:31:40] from the dead dwells in your body
[1:31:45] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:31:49] now the word quicken means to be made
[1:31:52] alive
[1:31:53] after death after it's dead then it's to
[1:31:56] be quickened
[1:31:57] the world has been shut up in doubt
[1:32:01] for many ages until then
[1:32:04] this was proven not only talked about
[1:32:07] but was proven i think that anything is
[1:32:10] worthwhile as jesus said oh ye therefore
[1:32:14] teach all nations and prove to them
[1:32:18] by demonstrating the power of god
[1:32:21] to them these signs shall follow
[1:32:24] them that believe them who promise
[1:32:27] and say they believe he give us a
[1:32:30] definite
[1:32:31] understanding of it that these signs
[1:32:34] would
[1:32:35] follow them that believe it would be the
[1:32:37] proof
[1:32:38] of their testimony now we can say we
[1:32:41] believe
[1:32:42] but until we are have
[1:32:45] the proven sign that he said that would
[1:32:48] be upon us
[1:32:49] then we are just confessing to be
[1:32:52] believers
[1:32:53] and not the possession of believers
[1:32:56] for remember a few days ago i was
[1:32:58] listening to a radio
[1:33:00] uh program on kair down in tucson
[1:33:04] and this minister had taken the assad
[1:33:07] against
[1:33:08] us that the pentecostal religion was
[1:33:10] nothing but just a
[1:33:11] sham there was uh not to listen to it it
[1:33:14] was unstable
[1:33:16] and said any man that spoke in tongues
[1:33:18] and
[1:33:19] these things and claimed to be uh heal
[1:33:22] the sick and so forth by prayer
[1:33:24] that it was to leave away from it and to
[1:33:26] pray for those poor
[1:33:28] decrepit people because if they were in
[1:33:31] an illusion
[1:33:33] that there was something wrong with them
[1:33:35] oh how i would have liked to
[1:33:37] talk to that brother just a little while
[1:33:39] and
[1:33:40] he said that the uh that that was only
[1:33:43] given for the apostles
[1:33:45] at the day of pentecost and that was all
[1:33:48] i find that 30 years later paul was
[1:33:51] ordaining these gifts in the church in
[1:33:54] first corinthians 15
[1:33:55] that he said in the church the gift of
[1:33:58] speaking in tongues miracles and all
[1:34:00] these other gifts
[1:34:01] was set in the church jesus said
[1:34:05] that go ye into all the world
[1:34:08] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:34:12] how far all the world who to
[1:34:15] every creature they've never received it
[1:34:17] yet
[1:34:18] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:34:21] believe how long
[1:34:22] all the world who to ever creature
[1:34:25] these signs shall follow them and all
[1:34:28] the world and every creature these signs
[1:34:30] shall follow them
[1:34:31] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:34:34] speak with new tongues if they taken up
[1:34:36] a deadly thing or serpent or drinking a
[1:34:38] deadly thing would not harm them
[1:34:40] they'll lay their hands on the sick and
[1:34:42] they shall recover that was his
[1:34:44] last commission to the church mark the
[1:34:47] 16th chapter
[1:34:48] paul's ordaining these gifts into the
[1:34:52] church 30 years later
[1:34:53] and said in galatians 1 8 if an angel
[1:34:56] from heaven
[1:34:58] preaches to you any other gospel
[1:35:01] than this which is already received see
[1:35:04] already been preached let him be
[1:35:07] accursed
[1:35:08] amen i believe that
[1:35:11] pentecost begin without an ending
[1:35:15] i believe it's to be to every creature
[1:35:18] all times and all places
[1:35:20] that pentecost should always remain the
[1:35:23] pentecostal blessings
[1:35:25] should be up on the people and now
[1:35:28] what is this pentecostal blessing it's a
[1:35:31] confirmation of the resurrection
[1:35:35] no wonder the gospel itself means good
[1:35:38] news
[1:35:39] good news of what he's raised from the
[1:35:42] dead
[1:35:43] and because i live ye
[1:35:46] live also ye which were once
[1:35:50] dead in sin and trespasses god has
[1:35:53] quickened us together but that spirit
[1:35:56] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:35:59] and we are now sitting in heavenly
[1:36:01] places with him
[1:36:03] communing with him talking with him what
[1:36:06] a
[1:36:07] joy to tell people that story that
[1:36:09] believes it to be the truth
[1:36:13] i'm wondering today it's what's
[1:36:16] happening
[1:36:17] are we really getting the people to god
[1:36:21] are we just getting them to church we
[1:36:24] must get them to christ
[1:36:26] that's it we're this quickening power
[1:36:29] it's good to go to church
[1:36:31] sure if that's as far as we go oh it's
[1:36:33] not far enough
[1:36:35] when you come to church that's good but
[1:36:37] go on to christ
[1:36:38] from the church because we must receive
[1:36:42] this
[1:36:43] quickening power if we ever expect to be
[1:36:47] in that general resurrection because
[1:36:49] it's the only thing that will ever
[1:36:51] bring us from the dead for if this
[1:36:54] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[1:36:58] dead
[1:36:59] dwell in you it'll also
[1:37:02] quicken make bring to life your
[1:37:05] mortal bodies amen what a promise to us
[1:37:09] now notice the very essence
[1:37:12] of this resurrection is to tell
[1:37:16] and to show and to prove
[1:37:19] that jesus has raised up from the dead
[1:37:23] he's not dead he's a living he lives
[1:37:26] here he's in us
[1:37:28] i'll be with you even in you
[1:37:31] a little while the world sees me no more
[1:37:33] yet you shall see me for
[1:37:35] i will be with you even in you
[1:37:39] unto the end of the world now as
[1:37:41] christians we
[1:37:42] all claim he is alive or
[1:37:46] we've been quickened from quicken from
[1:37:48] life
[1:37:49] from death to life by his spirit and if
[1:37:52] we haven't been quickened then we've not
[1:37:54] been made alive now we're going to break
[1:37:58] into this subject the lord willing
[1:38:00] and kindly teach it for a few minutes
[1:38:02] how that
[1:38:03] are we quickened and can we be sure that
[1:38:05] this is the truth
[1:38:07] now this is your own life this is
[1:38:10] my life it's where that the
[1:38:13] if this isn't truth what i'm fixing to
[1:38:16] say then i'm one of the most foolish
[1:38:18] people in the world
[1:38:19] i've given my life for something there's
[1:38:21] nothing to and so have you
[1:38:24] but if it is the truth then i owe
[1:38:26] everything that i
[1:38:27] am oh everything that i could be
[1:38:31] to the cause of which we're standing for
[1:38:34] and i think that we mustn't lose our
[1:38:37] enthusiasm
[1:38:39] and as we see easter approaching it just
[1:38:42] does something down in me as i i know
[1:38:45] that that's
[1:38:45] uh the day that the thing was sealed
[1:38:48] forever
[1:38:49] in the sight of god now we notice
[1:38:53] it's the same spirit that raised him
[1:38:56] from the grave that
[1:38:58] is dwelling in us now how could that be
[1:39:01] the spirit that raised up god
[1:39:03] jesus from the dead has dwelling in us
[1:39:06] now now is the spirit
[1:39:10] that quickens it's not the word that
[1:39:13] quickens
[1:39:14] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:39:18] or gives the word life
[1:39:22] gives it wings to fly
[1:39:25] gives it access it's the spirit
[1:39:29] that does that now the wheat alone
[1:39:32] is just a wheat but when the quicken in
[1:39:35] life gets into it
[1:39:37] into the wheat then it gives it life
[1:39:41] and we which were once dead made in the
[1:39:43] image of god
[1:39:45] and yet dead in sin and trespass this
[1:39:48] some way
[1:39:49] god had to get this quicken in life into
[1:39:52] your
[1:39:53] mortal bodies i'm talking about your
[1:39:56] body
[1:39:57] now jesus was the word
[1:40:01] you believe that don't you in the
[1:40:03] beginning saint john 1
[1:40:04] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:40:07] was with god
[1:40:08] and the word was god and the word was
[1:40:11] made flesh
[1:40:12] and dwelt among us now as the promised
[1:40:15] messiah
[1:40:16] he quickened every word that was
[1:40:20] prophesied that he would do
[1:40:22] heal the sick and how to be born of a
[1:40:24] virgin all that
[1:40:26] made it true he was the word manifested
[1:40:29] here on earth but he could not
[1:40:33] do this just as a man had taken the
[1:40:35] spirit of god
[1:40:36] dwelling in him to quicken these
[1:40:39] promises
[1:40:39] to him i hope that we get this real
[1:40:44] clear now
[1:40:44] jesus being a man himself the body
[1:40:48] but it took the spirit in him
[1:40:51] the spirit it's not me that doeth the
[1:40:54] works it's my
[1:40:56] father that dwelleth in me he's the one
[1:40:59] that does the works
[1:41:01] see jesus himself was the word because
[1:41:04] he was
[1:41:05] before god this is a bad word to use i
[1:41:07] hope you take it right before a crown
[1:41:09] but he was predestinated by the
[1:41:13] foreknowledge of god
[1:41:15] how god's plan was to be that he would
[1:41:18] send a redeemer
[1:41:19] and this redeemer could only be his own
[1:41:22] son
[1:41:23] so then that was god's promise all the
[1:41:25] way from the garden of eden
[1:41:27] that jesus would be here here he was
[1:41:30] as a man born of a virgin but it taken
[1:41:33] the spirit of god to quicken
[1:41:35] that word to him and he was the word
[1:41:39] quickened the word
[1:41:42] quickened for that hour the time had
[1:41:45] come
[1:41:46] when you had to have a redeemer the law
[1:41:47] had failed
[1:41:49] other things that failed now it takes a
[1:41:51] redeemer
[1:41:53] and he was the promised redeemer
[1:41:56] he was quickened by the word of god
[1:42:00] and now if that same spirit that was
[1:42:04] upon
[1:42:04] him to be the redeemer in that age that
[1:42:06] we have accepted
[1:42:08] now the promise of in this last days
[1:42:11] what would take place
[1:42:13] if you become part of that word
[1:42:17] you are redeemed with him because the
[1:42:20] same
[1:42:21] spirit that dwell in christ is dwelling
[1:42:24] in you quickening your life to this age
[1:42:27] and it will also in the end time quicken
[1:42:30] your mortal bodies resurrect them bring
[1:42:33] them up again
[1:42:36] that takes the gloom away when we look
[1:42:37] at it in that and that's the truth
[1:42:39] see romans here paul has proved it to us
[1:42:42] see
[1:42:43] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:42:45] the dead dwells in you
[1:42:47] it will also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:42:50] this is the same spirit that raised him
[1:42:54] up
[1:42:55] that quicken the true believer to
[1:42:57] eternal
[1:42:58] life the spirit that raised up jesus
[1:43:02] from the dead
[1:43:03] dwells into the believer quickens
[1:43:07] the believer to eternal life
[1:43:12] there's only one life one eternal spirit
[1:43:15] one eternal life and that's god god
[1:43:19] alone is
[1:43:19] eternal and then we being his children
[1:43:22] are
[1:43:22] part of him that is the attributes
[1:43:26] of his thinking and the thought
[1:43:29] is expressed and becomes a word then
[1:43:32] each individual in here that possesses
[1:43:35] this eternal life was before the
[1:43:39] foundation of the world
[1:43:41] in god's thinking that's the only way it
[1:43:44] could be because you're a
[1:43:46] attribute that's an expression
[1:43:49] of a thought has been come a word and a
[1:43:52] word
[1:43:53] has taken life and it's eternal that's
[1:43:55] the reason we have
[1:43:56] eternal life in the same principle
[1:44:00] that the great son of god the redeemer
[1:44:03] we become
[1:44:04] sons and daughters of god through that
[1:44:06] same spirit
[1:44:07] by the same foreknowledge of god
[1:44:11] look at the millions on earth that
[1:44:13] didn't receive it when jesus share
[1:44:16] but how thankful that we should be this
[1:44:19] morning to know that we have the direct
[1:44:21] evidence and the bible proofs that we
[1:44:25] are included in that great resurrection
[1:44:28] morning coming
[1:44:29] that great easter we have the earnest of
[1:44:32] it
[1:44:33] right now in our mortal bodies
[1:44:37] the predestinating ones are the first of
[1:44:40] course to be quickened
[1:44:41] when the holy spirit comes to claim its
[1:44:44] own
[1:44:45] now there's a great statement and i want
[1:44:47] my minister of brothers to try to
[1:44:48] understand this see
[1:44:50] in the beginning god the great spirit he
[1:44:53] wasn't even god then
[1:44:55] he was the eternal one god is an object
[1:44:58] of worship
[1:44:59] he had nothing to worship him there was
[1:45:00] no there were no angels no nothing
[1:45:03] just god alone him alone's eternal but
[1:45:06] in order to be god there had to be
[1:45:08] something to worship him so he
[1:45:09] created angels and beings
[1:45:12] and uh cherubians and so forth
[1:45:16] to worship him and his great plan begin
[1:45:18] to unfold
[1:45:19] but remember you
[1:45:22] in the the statue that you are
[1:45:25] in this morning if you wasn't
[1:45:28] in his thinking then you're not now
[1:45:33] for you is some part it's in you that's
[1:45:36] eternal and eternal only belongs to god
[1:45:41] and god was his thinking of you setting
[1:45:44] right where you are now in his thinking
[1:45:48] i stood at the pulpit
[1:45:49] this morning because he's infinite and
[1:45:52] knows all things
[1:45:54] therefore he could tell the end from the
[1:45:57] beginning
[1:45:58] because he's eternal and you
[1:46:01] being a son of god or a daughter of god
[1:46:05] then you were in his thinking at the
[1:46:07] beginning
[1:46:10] and then when the holy spirit come in
[1:46:12] your own earth
[1:46:14] walking around here as a center way down
[1:46:17] in your life is something you don't know
[1:46:19] what's taking place but you're hungry i
[1:46:21] heard the presbyterian brother
[1:46:23] i heard the the baptist talking about
[1:46:25] back there he was a
[1:46:26] a freewheeled baptist preaching where he
[1:46:28] can my fellow brother
[1:46:30] that you there's something in you
[1:46:35] something that you never put in there
[1:46:39] it's something that you couldn't desire
[1:46:41] to be in there
[1:46:42] it's something that's contrary to your
[1:46:44] own nature
[1:46:47] it's the foreknowledge of god taking
[1:46:49] place
[1:46:51] god's word as jesus was born the son of
[1:46:56] god
[1:46:56] to be emmanuel god's full expression
[1:47:01] in a man and he found him
[1:47:04] in perfect obedience down at the river
[1:47:07] of
[1:47:08] jordan being baptized for that prophet
[1:47:12] and as soon as he obeyed him and walked
[1:47:14] out of the water
[1:47:15] the heavens opened to john and he saw
[1:47:17] the holy ghost descending from heaven
[1:47:20] saying this
[1:47:20] is my beloved yes perfect
[1:47:24] obedience the spirit had sought him out
[1:47:27] in obedience oh wayward man or woman
[1:47:32] this morning
[1:47:33] when you're sitting here and there's
[1:47:35] something in you
[1:47:36] telling you this is right it's the holy
[1:47:39] spirit
[1:47:40] seeking you out that's it
[1:47:44] to bring you to a knowledge of truth
[1:47:49] of this hour that we're now living
[1:47:52] not some hour that's gone by the hour
[1:47:54] now
[1:47:56] there was thousands there that it all
[1:47:59] being an hour
[1:48:00] pass but there was a present tense hour
[1:48:03] that was the hour that jesus was to
[1:48:05] appear and there stood the word
[1:48:08] there stood the people and here was a
[1:48:11] manifestation of
[1:48:12] god taking place to vindicate that that
[1:48:16] was the truth and it's pentecostal
[1:48:19] people today
[1:48:21] let me say this that we're standing in
[1:48:23] this last days
[1:48:25] where god promised he'd pour out his
[1:48:27] spirit upon all flesh
[1:48:29] and his sons and daughters should
[1:48:30] prophesy
[1:48:33] shall follow them that believe it's the
[1:48:36] hour
[1:48:36] that's what makes that creation in you
[1:48:44] i'm afraid that if we keep going we'll
[1:48:47] have the rapture
[1:48:57] you know as i was listening to it just
[1:48:59] now again
[1:49:01] going through it more and more just came
[1:49:04] uh pouring out uh it
[1:49:07] it's marvelous that and and
[1:49:10] tell me that isn't marvelous when you
[1:49:13] remember he said
[1:49:14] that you can trust in it and you can
[1:49:15] believe in it
[1:49:17] that here's something in you that you
[1:49:18] couldn't even desire
[1:49:20] you couldn't put there yourself it's
[1:49:22] even contrary to your nature
[1:49:26] and you we battle so much with our
[1:49:28] nature
[1:49:29] but yet we it wasn't our nature that put
[1:49:33] this
[1:49:33] in our hearts he
[1:49:36] put it there
[1:49:40] and and you know why he put it there
[1:49:42] right
[1:49:43] because he predestinates a people
[1:49:47] to be there to manifest
[1:49:50] and bring the promises of word god's
[1:49:52] word to pass
[1:49:54] amen this life in us but i want to just
[1:49:57] finish this morning right here and
[1:50:01] we should we'll just be um maybe out by
[1:50:03] noon and
[1:50:04] maybe through the summer we can try to
[1:50:06] keep the services
[1:50:07] uh just a little more precise but i want
[1:50:10] to
[1:50:11] just read this last statement to you
[1:50:15] before it came and you you caught where
[1:50:18] he was bringing us right talking is
[1:50:20] about the spirit
[1:50:21] talking about how it's predestinated to
[1:50:24] us right
[1:50:27] when the holy spirit come and you're on
[1:50:29] earth
[1:50:30] walking around here as a sinner way
[1:50:33] down in your life there is something
[1:50:37] you don't know what's taking place
[1:50:40] but you're hungry i i
[1:50:44] heard the prospering brother i heard the
[1:50:45] baptist talking back there the free will
[1:50:48] baptist preaching
[1:50:49] my fellow brother that you were
[1:50:52] there something in you something in you
[1:50:55] that you never
[1:50:56] put in there is something that you
[1:50:59] couldn't
[1:50:59] desire to be there you couldn't even
[1:51:03] desire it to be there just think of it
[1:51:06] something that's contrary to your own
[1:51:08] nature
[1:51:09] it's the foreknowledge of god taking
[1:51:11] place
[1:51:12] god's word amen
[1:51:16] it's the foreknowledge of god
[1:51:19] taking place
[1:51:23] what is the foreknowledge of god
[1:51:25] manifested that's the word
[1:51:27] being manifested no wonder the prophet
[1:51:29] god said you're the word
[1:51:32] that thing that god put there that you
[1:51:35] it's even contrary to your nature
[1:51:37] do you know your nature still contrary
[1:51:39] to it
[1:51:41] your flesh still wars against it right
[1:51:44] right that's what paul said i have to
[1:51:46] bring this flesh under subjection
[1:51:48] i die daily satan's always putting
[1:51:51] something up there always trying to draw
[1:51:53] you away
[1:51:54] always lying to you telling you that
[1:51:56] you're not
[1:51:57] a believer i've had many people come to
[1:52:01] me say
[1:52:02] satan's telling me
[1:52:06] i thought oh praise god
[1:52:10] satan's telling me i'll never get well
[1:52:12] that's the exact
[1:52:14] proof because if if
[1:52:17] because he's a liar i mean i just can't
[1:52:20] i mean how can you be described
[1:52:24] any more of a liar than being called the
[1:52:27] father of lies
[1:52:31] in other words every lie that's ever
[1:52:33] told comes from you
[1:52:35] because he lied to eve and that's the
[1:52:38] story
[1:52:40] but you know that's why this is the
[1:52:42] story that the truth
[1:52:44] returns back to the bride
[1:52:47] and she's not eating of that fruit
[1:52:49] anymore praise the lord but let's just
[1:52:51] listen this last statement
[1:52:53] in closing and and i would just start
[1:52:55] going right back over all these same
[1:52:57] quotes and reading to
[1:52:58] you again and and and getting all
[1:53:01] excited all over again
[1:53:03] you know because i like he says there's
[1:53:06] thousands that are living
[1:53:10] and the hours passed
[1:53:13] so let's just pick it up there because
[1:53:15] he's we're going to
[1:53:16] launch a little bit into what's ahead of
[1:53:18] us
[1:53:20] he said he said this is paragraph 66.
[1:53:24] now there's thousands there that had
[1:53:28] obeying an hour past
[1:53:32] but there was a present tense hour
[1:53:37] that was the hour that jesus
[1:53:40] was to appear and stood
[1:53:44] there and stood there the word
[1:53:48] now you have a present tense hour
[1:53:52] every believer in their life has a
[1:53:55] present tense
[1:53:56] hour the time in your life where the
[1:53:59] word is quickened and manifested to you
[1:54:02] alive amen because everything he's
[1:54:06] already known about you
[1:54:08] right what was it it was the
[1:54:10] foreknowledge of god
[1:54:12] coming to pass so each of you in your
[1:54:15] life
[1:54:16] has a foreknowledge of god of you
[1:54:20] where you were the color of your eyes
[1:54:22] the color of your hair is where you be
[1:54:24] sitting this morning
[1:54:25] each one of you has a foreknowledge of
[1:54:29] god a place in your life
[1:54:32] that the word is going to manifest and
[1:54:35] come to pass
[1:54:36] and it'll be the word of god standing
[1:54:38] there
[1:54:40] you understand too many times we
[1:54:43] approach
[1:54:43] everything like a group revelation
[1:54:46] like a group truth
[1:54:50] do you understand we believe the message
[1:54:53] but what the message is trying to do is
[1:54:56] break this down to each individual
[1:55:00] where each individual understands that
[1:55:03] god is speaking to them
[1:55:05] personally through the message of the
[1:55:08] hour
[1:55:08] you can't take this message and teach it
[1:55:11] like a dogma
[1:55:12] and like a creed
[1:55:18] the minute the hour changes
[1:55:23] the quickening power changes
[1:55:30] i i i was in this message 30 years ago
[1:55:34] we weren't preaching these kind of
[1:55:35] messages 30 years ago
[1:55:37] we weren't hearing what we're hearing
[1:55:39] today 30 years ago
[1:55:44] was it there sure
[1:55:47] the seals were contained in the bible
[1:55:53] the four horse riders were going out
[1:55:56] paul
[1:55:57] all them guys were preaching at the it
[1:55:59] all this word of god was
[1:56:01] transpiring just exactly the way it was
[1:56:04] transpiring
[1:56:05] everything was the same but we didn't
[1:56:07] see it why
[1:56:08] because what age were we to get i sav
[1:56:12] what age were we to get character what
[1:56:15] eggs were we going to be clothed and
[1:56:17] right
[1:56:18] rain them at so if you understand the
[1:56:21] the word quickens
[1:56:24] by the hour
[1:56:29] so it's very easy to find a comfort zone
[1:56:34] that's why the grass always looks
[1:56:35] greener on the other side
[1:56:38] you go to a meeting and you get there
[1:56:40] and mend that fellowship you get in
[1:56:42] fellowship maybe you live
[1:56:43] isolated all the time and all of a
[1:56:45] sudden now you're in fellowship the
[1:56:46] fellowship feels so good it feels so
[1:56:48] rich
[1:56:49] it's so good oh this this this is where
[1:56:52] it's at
[1:56:54] and you go to where it's at and it's not
[1:56:56] where it's at because it's never
[1:56:58] there it's remember what he said it's in
[1:57:01] here it's in here this
[1:57:04] is this is where it's being quickened
[1:57:08] it's not being quickened out here it's
[1:57:09] being quickened in
[1:57:11] you
[1:57:15] now why because that's why he's talked
[1:57:17] about it i want to if i get this to set
[1:57:20] in you each of your lives are different
[1:57:22] my life's different
[1:57:26] but the quickening is going on
[1:57:29] this he said this is your life this is
[1:57:32] my
[1:57:33] life that's the words he used trying to
[1:57:36] get us to say wait a minute this is
[1:57:38] something individual here
[1:57:41] so as we read he says there's thousands
[1:57:44] that had obeyed an hour past
[1:57:49] but there was a present tense hour
[1:57:53] that was the hour that jesus was to
[1:57:56] appear
[1:57:57] and stood the word there stood the
[1:58:01] people
[1:58:02] and here was the manifestation
[1:58:05] of god taking place to vindicate
[1:58:09] that that was the truth
[1:58:13] and as pentecostal people today
[1:58:16] let me say this that
[1:58:20] we're standing in the last days
[1:58:23] where god promised he'd pour
[1:58:26] out his spirit upon
[1:58:29] all flesh now
[1:58:33] that's why pentecost
[1:58:37] was not the outpouring of god's spirit
[1:58:42] it was a restoration of gifts
[1:58:46] and at best a partaking
[1:58:50] of evil men
[1:58:53] but to this outpouring and i i have to
[1:58:57] go another half hour
[1:58:58] and i already passed noon but this
[1:59:01] outpouring
[1:59:03] could only be on the predestinated
[1:59:08] so this outpouring was for
[1:59:12] ordained predestinated the manifest
[1:59:17] and it has to be a hundred percent
[1:59:21] word that's why
[1:59:25] what they thought was the of latter rain
[1:59:28] was not
[1:59:29] because the teaching rain had to come
[1:59:32] first
[1:59:32] the word had to come so
[1:59:36] oh my i got i got an hour in me right
[1:59:39] now
[1:59:40] the word had to come because the word
[1:59:44] had to come so the believer
[1:59:47] could see it quicken
[1:59:51] amen or proven
[1:59:55] because that's the seal of it
[2:00:00] so if the messenger didn't come and
[2:00:02] preach
[2:00:03] all that he preached then you would be
[2:00:06] trying to see
[2:00:07] something gone past quicken
[2:00:10] or something that has past be brought to
[2:00:13] life
[2:00:14] but he's not bringing alive something
[2:00:16] that used to be
[2:00:17] he's bringing something alive that was
[2:00:20] predestinated
[2:00:22] to come hallelujah
[2:00:27] we're not part we didn't miss anything
[2:00:35] we haven't missed anything
[2:00:40] when you get someplace i don't care how
[2:00:43] much is going on
[2:00:45] how much carrying on how excited the
[2:00:47] preacher gets
[2:00:48] you did not miss anything
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:00:55] a lot of people like preachers on one
[2:00:57] leg
[2:01:03] you didn't miss nothing you just heard
[2:01:06] the messenger
[2:01:08] say that calm cool
[2:01:13] and collective
[2:01:18] nobody gets excited they get excited at
[2:01:21] the excitement
[2:01:26] but when you can see it
[2:01:29] proven
[2:01:33] okay when you can see it coming to pass
[2:01:38] we haven't missed anything no
[2:01:42] so let's read that the spirit upon
[2:01:45] our flesh and his sons and daughters
[2:01:48] should prophesy
[2:01:50] what's that preach
[2:01:53] tell of the things that is coming to
[2:01:56] pass
[2:01:56] what will come to pass what will happen
[2:02:00] because the word's been revealed to them
[2:02:03] so they know what's
[2:02:04] going to happen i can prophesy
[2:02:08] it's only going to get worse for the
[2:02:10] unbeliever
[2:02:11] but it's only going to get better for
[2:02:13] the believer
[2:02:16] now i know you get in battles but we're
[2:02:19] not
[2:02:20] we'll go through that a little later he
[2:02:22] said his sons and daughters should
[2:02:23] prophesy
[2:02:24] for he said these signs shall follow
[2:02:27] them that believe
[2:02:29] it's the hour that's what makes
[2:02:33] that creation in you now
[2:02:36] it's the hour that's what makes the
[2:02:39] creation in you
[2:02:41] don't you understand the hour that we're
[2:02:44] in
[2:02:45] the circumstances that we're in
[2:02:48] the environment that we're in
[2:02:51] the the woke and the and the weight and
[2:02:54] the
[2:02:55] whoop and everything else that's going
[2:02:57] around out here
[2:02:59] the the sodom and gomorrah condition
[2:03:02] everything that's happened it's the hour
[2:03:07] that makes that creation
[2:03:11] in you if it didn't get to this
[2:03:15] hour then the creation of god
[2:03:19] hastening the day that we prove this
[2:03:22] word is true
[2:03:23] it couldn't happen until the hour was
[2:03:27] there
[2:03:27] because the hour is what puts the
[2:03:30] creation in you
[2:03:33] oh hallelujah
[2:03:36] not woe unto me even so come quickly
[2:03:40] lord jesus
[2:03:44] it's got to be this way
[2:03:49] i wish it wasn't i like the way it was
[2:03:52] before the plague
[2:03:57] but we've had a plague
[2:04:00] how many think there'll be another
[2:04:02] plague
[2:04:04] sure i'll tell you a plague that would
[2:04:08] knock this country crazy
[2:04:10] for all the cell phones to go down
[2:04:13] we'd be in a plague you'd have to ask
[2:04:17] somebody for something
[2:04:21] you'd have to go see somebody you'd have
[2:04:23] to look them in the eye
[2:04:24] it's real simple to type somebody and
[2:04:26] say oh i wish you wouldn't have done
[2:04:29] that
[2:04:32] but really looking here you know your
[2:04:36] teeth
[2:04:37] everything just the way that you really
[2:04:39] feel
[2:04:42] do you think god's going to let us get
[2:04:44] by
[2:04:45] huh he'd have to raise sodom and
[2:04:48] gomorrah up again
[2:04:50] you think he's going to make such a bed
[2:04:51] of ease that we're just going to
[2:04:53] skate in on social media
[2:04:57] don't look at your phone for the rapture
[2:04:59] to be announced
[2:05:04] jesus is not going to twitter
[2:05:11] it ain't happening how when did he tell
[2:05:14] you to look at
[2:05:16] look at the signs of his coming
[2:05:20] have i saved that thou can see
[2:05:23] recognize the word of god coming to pass
[2:05:26] it's the hour that's going to put the
[2:05:29] creation
[2:05:31] in you
[2:05:34] it's when this message when you can
[2:05:36] start to see
[2:05:37] this message coming to pass no wonder he
[2:05:40] told a study to show yourself approved
[2:05:43] read this word get from this message get
[2:05:45] it get in contact with it
[2:05:47] don't lose your enthusiasm for it
[2:05:50] because
[2:05:50] that's where the eye sab comes
[2:05:55] the anointing comes from revelation
[2:05:59] revelation is another word for i sav
[2:06:04] sight giving
[2:06:08] oh my and we just got to about
[2:06:11] five pages we better stop
[2:06:16] i just hope that that uh you know
[2:06:19] we don't get complacent and think oh

[2:06:25] i have easter seal all marked up
[2:06:28] and then i started listening because
[2:06:30] even as i sat there
[2:06:31] and i started seeing things that is just
[2:06:34] there
[2:06:35] praise god this word's eternal
[2:06:39] why does it have to be eternal word
[2:06:41] because it's talking
[2:06:42] to eternal beings there's only one thing
[2:06:46] that can contact eternity when eternity
[2:06:49] hears from
[2:06:51] eternity when word hears from
[2:06:54] word then we're going someplace

[2:07:00] your flesh
[2:07:01] don't look at the weakness look for the
[2:07:04] power
