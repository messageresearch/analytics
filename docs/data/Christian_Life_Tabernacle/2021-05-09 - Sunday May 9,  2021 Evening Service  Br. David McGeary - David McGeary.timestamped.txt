[41:26] precious name
[41:28] amen amen let's once again
[41:32] open our bibles to hebrews and
[41:35] and uh read the scriptures
[41:38] i guess the great revelation of
[41:41] melchizedek scared most everybody off
[41:45] but that's good we ought to turn off the
[41:47] stream
[41:48] and just rejoice with those of us who
[41:51] have
[41:52] come out to the house of the lord and
[41:55] and rejoice in the things of god
[41:59] let us come into our scriptures and
[42:04] start in hebrews the 6th chapter
[42:08] and the
[42:13] starting with let's start with the
[42:19] 16th verse and just read as
[42:22] paul unfolds this great mystery
[42:26] for us he says for
[42:29] men verily swear
[42:32] by the greater and oath for confirmation
[42:37] is to them the end of all strife
[42:41] wherein god willingly more abundantly
[42:46] to show unto the heirs of promise
[42:50] the immunability of his
[42:53] counsel confirmed it by an oath
[42:59] that by two immunible things
[43:03] in which it was impossible
[43:07] for god to lie we might have
[43:10] a strong consolation
[43:14] whom have fled for refuge
[43:17] to lay hold upon the hope that
[43:21] set before us now he's going to give us
[43:23] a glimpse of
[43:25] what that hope was remember this morning
[43:29] which hope we have as an
[43:33] anchor of the soul both
[43:36] sure and steadfast and which
[43:40] entereth into
[43:43] which entereth unto within the veil
[43:48] whether the forerunner is
[43:51] for us entered even
[43:54] jesus made an high priest
[43:59] forever after the order of malkesadet
[44:04] for this melchizedek king of salem
[44:08] priest of the most high god
[44:11] whom meant abraham returning
[44:14] from the slaughter of the kings and
[44:16] blessed him
[44:18] to whom abraham also gave a tenth part
[44:21] of
[44:22] all first being by
[44:25] interpretation king of righteousness
[44:28] and also king of salem
[44:32] which is king of peace without
[44:35] father without mother without descent
[44:38] having neither beginning of days nor
[44:42] ending of life but made
[44:45] liken unto the son of god abideth
[44:48] a priest continually now consider how
[44:52] great this man was
[44:55] and whom even abra whom even
[44:59] the patriarch abraham give a tenth part
[45:03] of his spoils
[45:05] amen amen heavenly father we ask you to
[45:08] bless your word to us tonight
[45:10] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[45:14] god bless you you may be seated
[45:24] we're going to pick up again and
[45:27] play the next little portion
[45:31] of the of this message but
[45:34] i'd like to do something i guess i might
[45:37] say
[45:38] a a little different
[45:41] i'd like to just kind of
[45:44] look at a few of the quotes
[45:47] before we
[45:51] listen to them and it just i
[45:54] kind of a backwards from what that we
[45:56] did it
[45:58] this morning but um
[46:02] so if you would uh pull up
[46:06] there paragraph uh 64
[46:10] and and then we just want to read
[46:14] just a few of these statements
[46:18] to us ahead of time so you're you're
[46:20] going to find
[46:21] out um what we've been talking about
[46:24] we're going to follow this
[46:27] to where he goes and
[46:31] it's going to be a wonderful so he says
[46:34] here he says
[46:35] now in the paragraph 64 now god
[46:39] in this stage of his creation
[46:43] later formed into flesh
[46:47] jesus from what
[46:50] from the great beginning spirit
[46:54] then he come down to be word
[46:57] bringing itself out the word
[47:01] doesn't yet make itself
[47:04] it's just spoke out emorphate
[47:08] later he becomes flesh
[47:11] jesus mortal to taste
[47:14] death for all of us sinners
[47:18] but when he when abraham meant him
[47:21] he was melchizedek he unfolds here
[47:26] what all the attributes will do
[47:30] in the final end every son of abraham
[47:34] every son of faith will
[47:38] absolutely do the same thing
[47:42] but i want you to watch how we have to
[47:45] come
[47:47] also we see him revealing here
[47:52] in ruth and boaz
[47:55] as a kinsmen redeemer
[47:58] how he had to become flesh
[48:01] now we see the attribute
[48:04] son of his spirit having not yet entered
[48:09] into the word
[48:10] form body but a theophany
[48:14] this body is subject to the word
[48:19] and the earnest waiting for the exchange
[48:23] of the body now he's
[48:26] he's he's preaching here and he's
[48:28] telling us
[48:29] that when he was these great attributes
[48:33] of god
[48:34] then he went from those attributes to a
[48:37] word
[48:38] form theophany and that's how he
[48:41] appeared to
[48:42] abraham letting us know what we would
[48:45] all become but then
[48:49] he became flesh now listen
[48:53] now this is paragraph 68 we're going to
[48:56] play the tape but we just want to
[48:58] lay this out again so you can hear it
[49:01] and hear it
[49:02] he says now the difference between him
[49:05] and you as a son see
[49:09] he was at the beginning the word
[49:13] an emorphing body so he
[49:16] changed the morphe means to change mass
[49:19] to change things so the difference
[49:23] between
[49:24] you and him between you and
[49:27] jesus the difference between you and
[49:30] what he was when he was
[49:32] melchizedek see
[49:35] he was at the beginning the word amorphy
[49:38] body he came in and
[49:42] lived in that
[49:45] in that person of melchizedek
[49:49] then later we never hear no more
[49:52] of melchizedek because
[49:55] he became jesus
[50:01] okay he wasn't jesus but he became
[50:07] jesus so he became word
[50:10] to flesh and jesus was
[50:13] the word made flesh
[50:18] okay so we see that he was the word
[50:22] made a flesh
[50:26] and then later we hear no more
[50:30] of malchester because he became jesus
[50:33] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[50:37] jesus now you bypass
[50:41] that because in that
[50:44] form he knowed all things
[50:48] and you have never been able
[50:51] to know that yet you
[50:54] come like adam like me you became
[50:58] from the attribute to flesh
[51:02] to be tempted so remember he was
[51:05] attribute and you were there and you
[51:08] were
[51:08] were and then he became word and you
[51:12] were a part of that
[51:13] and he became flesh but you bypassed
[51:17] that word part that knew all things
[51:20] and he says now you bypass that because
[51:24] in that form he knowed all things and
[51:27] you have
[51:27] never been able to know that yet
[51:31] you become like adam like me you become
[51:36] you became from attribute to flesh
[51:40] to be tempted but when this life is
[51:43] finished
[51:44] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[51:49] we have one already waiting
[51:52] that's where we go
[51:56] that is the word then we
[52:00] can look back and see what we've done
[52:04] now we don't understand it we have never
[52:07] become the word we've just become
[52:11] flesh man not the word
[52:16] but what are we becoming
[52:20] we are becoming the word
[52:23] in the invisible union he makes this
[52:27] statement
[52:29] if i was supposed to die in the morning
[52:33] a man took my place i cannot die
[52:37] for that sin somebody took
[52:40] my place and jesus the word
[52:44] took my place he became me
[52:48] that a sinner that i might become
[52:51] him the word so
[52:55] he became flesh because we
[52:58] bypass the word right
[53:02] and became flesh to be tempted
[53:05] but he became flesh
[53:08] and took my place that we might
[53:11] become word so he became flesh
[53:16] because we bypassed it so that god might
[53:19] show us
[53:20] attributes so that he could take us
[53:23] back to word
[53:28] and he said and that amen
[53:31] he says and jesus the word took my place
[53:34] he become me
[53:35] the sinner that i might become him the
[53:37] word amen
[53:39] now let me hold that true to that
[53:42] not the church the word oh
[53:45] the spiritual union of christ in his
[53:48] church
[53:48] now when the flesh is becoming word
[53:52] and the word is becoming flesh
[53:56] manifest vindicated just what the bible
[53:59] said
[54:00] would happen in this day
[54:03] it is happening day by day
[54:06] he said why it's accumulating so fast
[54:09] out there
[54:10] on those deserts and taking place i
[54:13] couldn't even keep up with it
[54:17] near the coming of jesus to be united
[54:21] with his church where the word beca
[54:24] where where the word becomes the word
[54:28] called the holy spirit searching the
[54:31] hearts
[54:32] so we we know that so he bypassed
[54:35] he came down and he was in all these
[54:37] attribute forms
[54:39] we knew that he was and then he he
[54:42] he thought out if i could use that
[54:45] carnal
[54:46] interpreter when we say when we say
[54:49] thought we think it
[54:50] out when god says thought it's an
[54:53] expression
[54:54] so the minute it becomes word it becomes
[54:57] eternal
[54:58] so he thought out this plan if the best
[55:01] way we could say it
[55:02] and so he went from what that he was
[55:06] all these great attributes to his
[55:09] thoughts expressed
[55:10] and when the thoughts was expressed it
[55:13] was from beginning to end
[55:15] it was alpha in omega it wasn't
[55:18] a plan not worked out it was a complete
[55:22] plan
[55:22] that was the beginning of time he says
[55:25] time began
[55:26] when he this thought and when he had
[55:28] this thought that's when the book of
[55:30] life
[55:31] came into view right then that's where
[55:34] he put your name
[55:35] you were eternal in him right then so he
[55:38] put your name
[55:39] on that book to be redeemed why did he
[55:43] put your name on the book to be redeemed
[55:46] because he knew that he was going to let
[55:49] you
[55:49] bypass the word form come down here as
[55:53] a sinner and that you so you could
[55:56] uh partake of the attributes
[56:00] of him being a deliverer so he needed
[56:03] you to be a part of the plan to reveal
[56:07] himself
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:11] so you're in his perfect plan you're in
[56:14] his perfect will
[56:15] you and not that we would uh
[56:19] sin that the grace of god abound god
[56:22] forbid
[56:23] but that we would understand that if we
[56:27] weren't predestinated
[56:28] and we weren't in his thinking we would
[56:31] never
[56:32] be there because he's the only author of
[56:35] eternal life
[56:37] so we find out that right in that great
[56:39] plan of god
[56:41] that he wants to reveal himself he needs
[56:44] your part of it
[56:49] to skip the word
[56:54] and become flesh
[56:57] because if you didn't skip that part
[57:01] he would have never been able to reveal
[57:03] that he was a
[57:04] savior he would never be able to reveal
[57:07] he was a healer
[57:08] he would never be able to reveal it so
[57:11] you are
[57:12] part of the revelation of god
[57:15] you are in the word but you haven't
[57:18] become the word yet
[57:23] but he shows in melchizedek
[57:28] what every son of god would become
[57:32] now when you understand that you haven't
[57:35] become
[57:36] word yet because if you would have come
[57:40] in that state
[57:40] you would have known the plan of god
[57:44] from beginning to end
[57:48] but he doesn't do that he unfolds it to
[57:52] you
[57:54] and how does he let us know what the
[57:57] word of god is
[57:58] he opens the seven seal mystery he pulls
[58:01] the cover off of us
[58:03] and he reveals to us the revelation
[58:06] of who is this malkiesada
[58:10] see you ask well i thought jesus yes
[58:13] jesus was the personality of god but
[58:16] he he became from attribute this one
[58:20] person
[58:22] then to word body
[58:25] melchizedek so the body what that
[58:29] melchizedek was in
[58:31] when he showed abraham was not the flesh
[58:34] sinful body that jesus became
[58:38] he only became that body because
[58:41] we came in flesh and he had to redeem
[58:45] that flesh that he could bring it back
[58:48] to the body that melchizedek had
[58:52] which was a word body
[58:56] so he allowed us to bypass
[59:01] that word body but to make it
[59:04] fair and just he put our names on the
[59:08] lamb's book of life
[59:10] that we would never fall that nothing
[59:12] could take it off
[59:14] so he already secured us
[59:17] eternally in his word thought
[59:20] he just didn't give us that body yet
[59:25] hallelujah but we're going to get that
[59:29] body
[59:31] but in order to fulfill
[59:34] his whole revealing
[59:38] of himself we had to play
[59:41] our part in the revealing of himself
[59:45] so instead of just giving us
[59:48] that melchizedek body
[59:52] he even left that body
[59:56] and became sin
[1:00:02] think of that what is flesh
[1:00:08] it's sin it goes all the way back to the
[1:00:12] serpent's seed
[1:00:13] it all he goes back that we were born in
[1:00:16] sin
[1:00:17] shaped in iniquity came into the world
[1:00:21] speaking lies so we didn't get that we
[1:00:24] bypassed that
[1:00:26] but the word didn't bypass that so what
[1:00:30] was melchizedek he was the word
[1:00:33] body that we are going to receive
[1:00:38] when this earthly temple be dissolved
[1:00:41] we have one waiting for us but god
[1:00:45] showed that to be true by taking on a
[1:00:49] representation
[1:00:51] before jesus became flesh
[1:00:54] showing us that we are going back to
[1:00:57] that body
[1:00:58] so he became flesh and then when he died
[1:01:01] he returned
[1:01:02] back into that word body
[1:01:06] theophany melchizedek that he was became
[1:01:09] before he came flesh
[1:01:11] so we could know we could come flesh to
[1:01:14] that same word
[1:01:16] body that melchizedek represented
[1:01:22] amen really when you think about it's
[1:01:25] pretty simple
[1:01:31] it is right
[1:01:35] in other words for god to show he was a
[1:01:37] healer
[1:01:39] a redeemer a deliverer
[1:01:42] he let us bypass
[1:01:46] what he always had in mind for us
[1:01:50] so he could reveal himself
[1:01:55] and then like we could go to ephesians
[1:01:58] we could go to all the scriptures that
[1:02:00] paul
[1:02:01] talked about about how we were made for
[1:02:04] his pleasure
[1:02:05] we were made for his purpose we were
[1:02:07] made for his glory
[1:02:09] we were made so he could be glorified
[1:02:14] so he let us go this route
[1:02:19] oh that ought to give us rest
[1:02:22] but he didn't leave us lost did he
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:27] and we just read it he became
[1:02:31] a kinsmen redeemer
[1:02:34] so he showed that in ruth and boaz
[1:02:39] in the opening of the seals what's the
[1:02:42] first thing that
[1:02:43] brother branham preaches he preaches the
[1:02:46] breach
[1:02:47] but what the breach is it's the kinsman
[1:02:50] redeemer
[1:02:52] he preaches the kinsmen redeemer he
[1:02:54] preaches
[1:02:55] that he became flesh but
[1:02:59] why was he our kinsmen redeemer not
[1:03:02] because of our flesh
[1:03:06] we were kinsmen to the body
[1:03:10] that he was in in malkesada
[1:03:15] that's what we're kind to because we
[1:03:18] bypass that right
[1:03:20] but to to restore or
[1:03:23] redeem means to bring back
[1:03:30] he's bringing us back
[1:03:34] to what we were in the word
[1:03:37] or what we bypassed
[1:03:41] oh my god
[1:03:45] now he's opening that to us
[1:03:49] now here he opens this great revelation
[1:03:54] and what do you
[1:03:58] feel or do you think that
[1:04:01] he's expecting
[1:04:05] from those that get this great
[1:04:08] revelation
[1:04:11] and then he goes in to that and we'll
[1:04:14] play the tape
[1:04:15] and then you'll see it and i'm i'm just
[1:04:17] reading you these things so
[1:04:20] and then so he comes down he says this
[1:04:23] is still paragraph
[1:04:25] and he said you have never been able to
[1:04:27] know that yet you come like adam you
[1:04:30] come like me
[1:04:31] because from attribute to flesh to be
[1:04:33] tempted
[1:04:34] but when this life is finished and this
[1:04:37] early tabernacle be dissolved
[1:04:40] we have one already waiting
[1:04:43] that's where we go that
[1:04:46] is the word then we can look back
[1:04:50] and see what we've done we don't
[1:04:53] understand it
[1:04:54] we have never become the word
[1:04:57] we've never be we've just become
[1:05:00] flesh man not word
[1:05:04] so we understand he said now look
[1:05:06] clearly makes it clear to you
[1:05:09] you'll never be the word unless you was
[1:05:13] a
[1:05:13] thought at the beginning
[1:05:17] now remember what the word was
[1:05:22] the word was the expression remind
[1:05:25] remember what he said
[1:05:26] god thought you and then he expressed
[1:05:28] you and here you are
[1:05:30] even the color of your hair the color of
[1:05:32] your eyes and everything
[1:05:34] he thought it and then here you were
[1:05:37] okay so he says that proves the
[1:05:40] predestination of god
[1:05:42] see you can't be the word unless
[1:05:45] you're a thought you had to be in the
[1:05:48] thinking
[1:05:49] first
[1:05:52] i mean can you imagine this that
[1:05:56] if we were in the thinking first
[1:05:59] okay and he allows us to come into this
[1:06:02] flesh
[1:06:03] and he made provisions for this flesh
[1:06:06] that nothing could be laid to the charge
[1:06:09] of god's elect
[1:06:11] that the blood of the lamb cleanses
[1:06:14] us from all unrighteousness
[1:06:20] even though and then we realize that
[1:06:23] if we were not struggling
[1:06:28] to make ourselves into the word
[1:06:32] there's a time for that
[1:06:36] okay but now the part that we play
[1:06:40] now is we become
[1:06:43] subject to the spirit of god
[1:06:48] so that's what we first do is we come to
[1:06:52] the spirit of god when the word says
[1:06:54] this we
[1:06:55] quickly respond so we become subject to
[1:06:58] the word of god
[1:07:00] and tell the change of our body
[1:07:03] till we go back to that word body
[1:07:07] so you understand when abraham showed
[1:07:10] up i mean when malkizadek showed up
[1:07:14] that was the person of god
[1:07:18] in what we call a word
[1:07:21] body that's what the
[1:07:25] theophany is it's the word body
[1:07:29] it's the thought body it's the original
[1:07:32] body that god thought of for
[1:07:35] every one of his sons and daughters
[1:07:44] this flesh that we're in with the five
[1:07:48] senses that's
[1:07:49] tempted and fails in sin
[1:07:52] no flesh shall inherit
[1:07:55] the kingdom of god
[1:08:02] the only thing that will inherit the
[1:08:04] kingdom of god
[1:08:06] is that predestinated word
[1:08:10] body that god had in his mind
[1:08:13] we haven't got that yet
[1:08:16] but where is it at it's waiting
[1:08:20] for us when this body
[1:08:23] be dissolved we have one
[1:08:26] waiting for them
[1:08:30] so they're not bodies stacked up like
[1:08:33] cord wood
[1:08:36] and they're not this body because if we
[1:08:39] were to get this body
[1:08:40] it would die again
[1:08:46] but we he he couldn't have a beginning
[1:08:49] and an
[1:08:50] end he couldn't have a plan without an
[1:08:53] end because he's alpha
[1:08:57] and omega and the scripture says when we
[1:09:01] see him
[1:09:01] as he is so shall we become like him
[1:09:06] so now what's he doing he's showing us
[1:09:10] his plan
[1:09:11] he's showing us what he had in mind all
[1:09:14] from the beginning
[1:09:15] he's showing us why we came down here in
[1:09:17] the flesh
[1:09:18] why we were born in sin but
[1:09:22] that wasn't the end
[1:09:25] really it's just the beginning
[1:09:30] it's beautiful i i don't know if i can
[1:09:32] get that into your mind
[1:09:34] this body is just a shadow
[1:09:38] so this is what jesus did he
[1:09:41] that person
[1:09:44] okay you have to understand there's not
[1:09:46] three persons
[1:09:48] that person that god turned himself
[1:09:52] into the first thing god did as a great
[1:09:55] whatever he wanted fellowship he had to
[1:09:58] become
[1:09:58] something to fellowship with so he
[1:10:01] became a
[1:10:02] person a personality a
[1:10:05] word right and that
[1:10:08] word took on a body
[1:10:12] the image that we were created in
[1:10:16] that's what appeared to abraham
[1:10:20] called melchizedek not a fleshly body
[1:10:24] like this
[1:10:25] that wrinkles and gets old it's that
[1:10:27] body that can walk through walls it's
[1:10:29] the bodies
[1:10:30] can walk on water it's the body that
[1:10:33] that never grows
[1:10:34] old
[1:10:38] okay we ain't got that yet
[1:10:41] we're looking for it we're believing for
[1:10:44] it
[1:10:44] but what's he do he's always been that
[1:10:47] kind of god
[1:10:51] he reveals it to us so it becomes our
[1:10:54] hope
[1:10:55] and so we just read a couple more
[1:10:58] statements
[1:11:00] he said he says and then when you become
[1:11:04] subject to the spirit
[1:11:07] it throws your whole body subject to
[1:11:10] that spirit
[1:11:12] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:11:16] but this seed word manifested or quick
[1:11:20] and
[1:11:20] made alive and when the bible says don't
[1:11:23] do this
[1:11:24] the body quickly turns to it
[1:11:27] there's no question and what is it
[1:11:31] it's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:11:36] this body will raise up again because
[1:11:38] it's
[1:11:39] already started
[1:11:42] amen it was once subject to sin
[1:11:48] and mire and corruption but now it's got
[1:11:52] the earnest
[1:11:54] turns and it's turned
[1:11:58] and this book says heavenly
[1:12:02] but when i listen to the tape i
[1:12:05] clearly hear so i don't want to disagree
[1:12:08] with the people that publish this book
[1:12:10] but it sounds to me like he says it's
[1:12:13] turned
[1:12:14] home
[1:12:19] now that's the earnest that you're going
[1:12:24] in the rapture it's the earnest
[1:12:28] okay so we don't have that body yet
[1:12:32] we have this fleshly body but the
[1:12:35] earnest
[1:12:36] that we're going to get that body and go
[1:12:39] into that rapture
[1:12:40] is the desire in our heart to bring
[1:12:43] this body subject to that spirit
[1:12:48] so that's what we're in we're in that
[1:12:50] quickening that it's already started
[1:12:53] it we're trying to bring this body in
[1:12:55] subjection
[1:12:56] this body will never come into
[1:12:58] subjection but
[1:13:00] the spirit that's in you wants to be
[1:13:03] delivered
[1:13:04] from this body it wants to bring this
[1:13:06] body into subjection
[1:13:08] so it keeps crying out what's it crying
[1:13:11] out for
[1:13:12] it's crying out for that perfect body
[1:13:14] that it's hearing from
[1:13:19] so it's a down payment
[1:13:23] that god gives you that spirit
[1:13:27] calling you working you convicting you
[1:13:29] of sin
[1:13:33] you say oh my i've got this
[1:13:37] you know it it makes me feel terrible
[1:13:39] sometimes
[1:13:42] it exposes me but praise god
[1:13:46] that's how he lets us know
[1:13:50] that i have a body waiting for him
[1:13:55] he creates a conflict
[1:13:59] between your fleshly body and your
[1:14:02] heavenly body
[1:14:04] and these two are warring against one
[1:14:06] another
[1:14:07] oh my goodness
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:12] can you see it brother can you see it
[1:14:17] wow the very law of contrast
[1:14:22] works in our mortal body we can't even
[1:14:26] live in this thing
[1:14:35] it's not our home that's why
[1:14:39] and you listen maybe i'll have them stop
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:43] and play it over again because i
[1:14:46] i listened to it four or five times and
[1:14:50] it says to me he says and if i'm wrong
[1:14:53] my hearing's not very great as many of
[1:14:55] you noticed
[1:14:56] but he says it turned home
[1:15:02] home that's where i dwell
[1:15:08] the real dwelling place and
[1:15:11] and so we see that it it becomes
[1:15:14] subject and so okay and we just
[1:15:18] and then he says
[1:15:22] and then we just read that and then i'm
[1:15:24] going to read a couple more statements
[1:15:25] and play it
[1:15:26] he says now how wonderful we love him
[1:15:28] now
[1:15:29] this body this is paragraph 76
[1:15:32] is subject to the spirit
[1:15:37] have not yet entered in to the word
[1:15:40] form but we are still
[1:15:43] in the flesh form
[1:15:47] but subject to the word
[1:15:50] death in the flesh will take us
[1:15:53] there
[1:15:57] really the rapture's death the rapture
[1:16:00] is a
[1:16:01] different form of the grave
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:09] people like those little things so i
[1:16:12] thought i could show you i can do those
[1:16:13] things too
[1:16:18] did you understand that what is the
[1:16:21] rapture
[1:16:23] it's the release from this body
[1:16:27] what is death it's the release
[1:16:30] from this body didn't you hear brother
[1:16:33] brahm says whether i go on the rapture
[1:16:35] or whether i die what difference
[1:16:39] does it make
[1:16:44] i hope what this stirs up into us is
[1:16:48] that
[1:16:48] we all need to get a lot more serious
[1:16:51] about the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:16:54] and following god and being where the
[1:16:56] word of god
[1:16:58] is being opened and revealed
[1:17:03] that's why we need to be on the field
[1:17:05] not off the field
[1:17:07] on the field
[1:17:12] there's only one hiding place and that's
[1:17:14] in the lord jesus
[1:17:16] so listen what he says there he says in
[1:17:18] but we're still in the flesh form
[1:17:20] but subject to the word death is in the
[1:17:23] flesh
[1:17:24] just the same thing think of a little
[1:17:26] baby
[1:17:28] you can take a woman this is my mother's
[1:17:31] day's message
[1:17:32] you can take a woman no matter how
[1:17:36] evil she is and
[1:17:40] when she is pregnant and fixing to be
[1:17:42] mother
[1:17:43] watch before the baby's born i don't
[1:17:46] care how cruel the woman is she gets
[1:17:48] real
[1:17:48] kind there's something about her
[1:17:51] seems godly see the little mother's
[1:17:55] fixing to become mother
[1:17:59] by the baby
[1:18:04] the only way she becomes mother is by
[1:18:06] the
[1:18:10] baby
[1:18:12] the mother doesn't produce the baby the
[1:18:14] baby produces the mother
[1:18:19] now doesn't that let you know we're all
[1:18:21] backwards
[1:18:24] we got this thing all backwards
[1:18:30] can you think of that to yourself
[1:18:34] okay we make god the healer
[1:18:43] we make god the deliverer
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:53] you understand that in other words he
[1:18:56] let us bypass that
[1:18:59] so we could be sinners so we could be
[1:19:02] saved
[1:19:04] but he doesn't lose us because he
[1:19:07] already
[1:19:08] put our name on the book
[1:19:11] so we're doing this for him
[1:19:24] do you see what he said if you if you're
[1:19:28] warning his thinking
[1:19:31] and you weren't predestinated to eternal
[1:19:33] life you will never have it
[1:19:35] there's nothing you could ever do here
[1:19:38] for your salvation not one thing
[1:19:41] the only reason that he sends his spirit
[1:19:46] to put you into the conflict with your
[1:19:49] flesh
[1:19:50] is to let you know that this flesh is
[1:19:52] not
[1:19:53] the end of you
[1:20:02] i feel sorry for all the people who are
[1:20:03] home
[1:20:05] i don't think we ought to send this out
[1:20:10] i don't think we ought to let anybody
[1:20:11] stream in on it
[1:20:14] this is the food for the elected tonight
[1:20:28] it and so let's just read a couple more
[1:20:31] statements
[1:20:33] he says it's like the baby he said why
[1:20:36] is it
[1:20:36] the little body now it's not alive yet
[1:20:41] see it's the only thing is it's just
[1:20:44] flesh
[1:20:48] and muscle that little jumping that's
[1:20:51] just muscles jerking
[1:20:52] but when it comes forth from the womb
[1:20:55] god
[1:20:56] breath the breath of life into it
[1:20:59] and then he screams out just as
[1:21:02] sure as there's a natural body being
[1:21:06] formed
[1:21:06] there is a spiritual body to receive it
[1:21:10] as soon as it gets here
[1:21:14] then when a man is born again
[1:21:18] from heaven he becomes a
[1:21:21] spirit baby in christ
[1:21:24] and then when this robe
[1:21:27] of flesh is dropped there is a natural
[1:21:32] body theophany
[1:21:34] a body not made with hands
[1:21:37] neither born of a woman that we go
[1:21:41] to now that is the same
[1:21:45] description that he gave
[1:21:48] of the theophany body that
[1:21:51] he was in when he appeared to abraham
[1:21:59] is that right
[1:22:02] he says then that body returns back and
[1:22:06] picks up the glorified body that's the
[1:22:08] reason jesus went to hell
[1:22:10] when he died and preached the souls that
[1:22:12] were in prison
[1:22:13] turned back into that theophany
[1:22:19] so what did jesus do he turned
[1:22:22] back into the theophany that he was
[1:22:26] become he became
[1:22:27] flesh because his work was finished in
[1:22:30] the flesh
[1:22:31] because he became kinsmen redeemer
[1:22:35] now we now can leave this flesh
[1:22:38] and go back and pick up our theophany
[1:22:42] body
[1:22:43] our word body the same body that he
[1:22:46] appeared
[1:22:47] to the melchizedek in and that's the
[1:22:50] revelation
[1:22:51] that was hid in who's this melchizedek
[1:22:55] jesus became flesh that we might become
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:04] word
[1:23:12] 79 ii corinthians 5 and 1
[1:23:16] if this earthly body be dissolved
[1:23:20] this earthly tabernacle we have another
[1:23:22] one
[1:23:23] see we have bypassed that
[1:23:27] to come straight from god the attribute
[1:23:30] to flesh
[1:23:31] to be tempted and tested by sin like
[1:23:34] adam did
[1:23:34] but tested of his word is over
[1:23:38] then we take up to this
[1:23:42] body that was prepared for us
[1:23:45] before the foundation of
[1:23:48] the world
[1:23:53] this is the word
[1:23:56] there that we skipped
[1:24:02] and come right around down here
[1:24:06] to be tempted and tested
[1:24:10] if we have come through that
[1:24:13] there have been no temptation
[1:24:17] we'd know all things that's the reason
[1:24:20] jesus knowed all things
[1:24:22] because he was the word before
[1:24:25] he was flesh see if we knowed all things
[1:24:29] we wouldn't know him
[1:24:31] then we become the word here we are
[1:24:34] formed to here we are
[1:24:38] formed to the word image
[1:24:41] to be partakers of the word feed
[1:24:44] on the word being predestinated since
[1:24:47] the beginning
[1:24:49] see that little spark of life that you
[1:24:52] had
[1:24:52] in you from the beginning when you
[1:24:55] started your journey
[1:24:56] many of you can't remember it
[1:24:59] you joined this church you joined that
[1:25:01] church and tried this and that
[1:25:03] nothing satisfied right but one day
[1:25:07] you just recognized it right
[1:25:11] so let's listen
[1:25:15] to brother branham preach it in the next
[1:25:18] just 10 minutes or so
[1:25:20] and and we'll we'll move on for this
[1:25:23] evening
[1:25:24] but we're going to go back so we can
[1:25:26] follow it all the way through
[1:25:28] in continuity so instead of playing it
[1:25:31] then explaining it
[1:25:33] or not explaining it i can't explain it
[1:25:35] it's a revelation
[1:25:36] just pointing out some things that it
[1:25:38] meant to me
[1:25:40] we we did it backwards
[1:25:43] we went through it first and now we'll
[1:25:45] listen to it
[1:25:46] and so we're gonna pick up on paragraph
[1:25:50] uh i think it's what 50
[1:25:54] uh
[1:25:59] let's let's if we can go let's go to
[1:26:01] paragraph 53
[1:26:03] and we'll just play paragraph 53
[1:26:07] through paragraph
[1:26:10] 80. okay would you like to do that
[1:26:15] hey man i think it's wonderful this
[1:26:17] really excites me
[1:26:19] so all right let's just listen
[1:26:24] in the world we can do right now thank
[1:26:27] god
[1:26:28] before jesus was ever born
[1:26:36] think of it before jesus was ever born
[1:26:40] 4 000 years before he came on earth
[1:26:44] and several thousand years before you
[1:26:47] come on earth
[1:26:48] jesus in god's mind died for the sins of
[1:26:52] the world
[1:26:53] and the book of life was made and your
[1:26:55] name was put on that book of life
[1:26:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:01] that's the bible truth
[1:27:04] see your name was
[1:27:07] ordained of god and placed on the book
[1:27:09] of life before the foundation of the
[1:27:11] world
[1:27:12] you were there in his attributes you
[1:27:14] don't remember it no
[1:27:16] because you're just a part of his life
[1:27:18] you are a part of
[1:27:20] god when you become a son or a daughter
[1:27:22] of god
[1:27:23] just as you are a part of your earthly
[1:27:26] father
[1:27:28] that's right you are
[1:27:32] the male carries the hemoglobin the
[1:27:35] blood
[1:27:37] i am on that estonian and the egg
[1:27:40] then you become a part of your father
[1:27:44] and your mother is a part of your father
[1:27:46] also
[1:27:48] so you're all a part of your father
[1:27:52] glory that that's the denomination not
[1:27:55] all together
[1:27:56] amen certainly done
[1:28:00] god and all the only place notice now
[1:28:05] his attribute then the attribute
[1:28:08] was first god
[1:28:11] the thought the attribute itself all in
[1:28:15] one
[1:28:16] without being expressed then when he
[1:28:19] expressed
[1:28:20] secondarily he became then the word
[1:28:25] and then the word was made flesh and
[1:28:27] dwelt among us
[1:28:29] saint john the first chapter and the
[1:28:32] first verse
[1:28:33] notice this is in the beginning
[1:28:37] but before the eternal notice
[1:28:41] in the beginning was the word
[1:28:44] when the time began it was word
[1:28:48] but before it was word it was attribute
[1:28:50] a thought
[1:28:51] then it was expressed in the beginning
[1:28:53] was the expression
[1:28:54] the word now we're getting where
[1:28:57] melchizedek is
[1:28:59] that's this mysterious person in the
[1:29:02] beginning
[1:29:03] was the word and the word was with god
[1:29:05] and the word was god
[1:29:07] amen and then the word became flesh
[1:29:11] and dwelt among us hold that there now
[1:29:14] notice
[1:29:16] his his first being
[1:29:19] was spirit god supernatural all right
[1:29:24] the great eternal second
[1:29:27] he begin to form himself towards flesh
[1:29:32] in a theophany it's called the word
[1:29:36] a body this
[1:29:39] then is a state he was in when he met
[1:29:42] abraham was called mel cassidy
[1:29:46] he was in the form of theophany
[1:29:49] i will get to that and prove it in a few
[1:29:51] minutes the lord willing
[1:29:53] he was the word a theophany
[1:29:57] is something that you could not see it
[1:29:59] could be right here now
[1:30:01] yet you cannot see it it's just like
[1:30:05] well like television that's in another
[1:30:08] dimension
[1:30:09] television people are moving right
[1:30:11] through this room now
[1:30:12] singing there's colors also
[1:30:16] but the eye is only subject to the five
[1:30:19] senses
[1:30:20] your whole being is only subject to five
[1:30:22] senses rather
[1:30:23] and you are only subject to what the
[1:30:25] site
[1:30:26] has been limited to see but there is
[1:30:29] another dimension
[1:30:30] that can be seen by a transformation
[1:30:36] by television now television
[1:30:39] does not manufacture a picture
[1:30:43] a television only channels it in to a
[1:30:46] circuit
[1:30:48] and then the television screen picks it
[1:30:50] up
[1:30:51] but the picture's there to begin with
[1:30:54] television was here when adam was here
[1:30:59] television was shared when elijah said
[1:31:01] on mount carmel
[1:31:03] television was shared with jesus of
[1:31:05] nazareth walk the shores of galilee
[1:31:08] but you're just now discovering it
[1:31:12] they wouldn't have believed it back
[1:31:13] there it'll be crazy to have said
[1:31:16] something like it
[1:31:17] but now it's become a reality amen
[1:31:21] and so is it that christ is yours
[1:31:26] the angels of god are here
[1:31:30] and someday in the great millennium to
[1:31:32] come
[1:31:33] it'll be just more real in television or
[1:31:35] anything else because
[1:31:36] they are here amen amen
[1:31:40] he reveals himself in his great form of
[1:31:44] what he claimed
[1:31:45] as he amorphous himself into his
[1:31:48] servants
[1:31:50] and it proves himself now here he is
[1:31:53] in the form of spirit and then he comes
[1:31:56] in the form of uh of immorphod
[1:32:01] i appeared to abraham in marfan
[1:32:05] when abraham was returning from the
[1:32:07] slaughter of the kings here come
[1:32:08] melchizedek
[1:32:10] talked to him the other day in the
[1:32:13] tucson paper
[1:32:14] i was reading an article that where
[1:32:17] there was a
[1:32:18] woman driving down the road i believe
[1:32:20] about 40 50 miles an hour
[1:32:22] and she hit an old man with an overcoat
[1:32:24] on she screamed
[1:32:26] and stopped her car threw him up in the
[1:32:27] air right out in the plain desert
[1:32:31] and she run back to find him and he
[1:32:32] wasn't there
[1:32:35] so what did she do some people behind
[1:32:38] her saw it happen
[1:32:39] saw the old man flap the air in his
[1:32:41] overcoat turning
[1:32:42] so they went back to find out they
[1:32:45] couldn't find the man anywhere
[1:32:47] they called the police force the police
[1:32:50] come out to examine the place there's
[1:32:51] nobody there
[1:32:53] well each one of them testified the car
[1:32:56] chugged
[1:32:56] hit the man he went up in the air and
[1:32:58] everybody saw it
[1:32:59] witnesses and two or three carloads of
[1:33:01] them they've seen it happen
[1:33:04] come to find out five years ago there
[1:33:07] was an old man with an overcoat on hit
[1:33:09] and killed on the same spot
[1:33:14] when you leave here you're not dead
[1:33:18] you've got to come back even if you're a
[1:33:20] sinner and be judged
[1:33:22] according to the deeds done in the body
[1:33:24] if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved
[1:33:26] we have on waiting
[1:33:29] in marphat that's the word now
[1:33:32] god in this stage of it's this stage of
[1:33:36] his creation
[1:33:38] later formed into flesh jesus
[1:33:41] from what from the great beginning
[1:33:44] spirit then came down to be the word
[1:33:48] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[1:33:51] make itself it just spoke out
[1:33:53] in orphan later he becomes flesh
[1:33:57] jesus mortal to taste death for all of
[1:34:00] us sinners
[1:34:03] when abraham met him he was melchizedek
[1:34:07] he unfolds here what all the
[1:34:10] attributes will do in the final end
[1:34:14] every son of abraham every son of the
[1:34:17] faith
[1:34:18] will absolutely do the same thing but i
[1:34:21] want to watch how we have to come
[1:34:25] also we see him revealed here in ruth
[1:34:28] and
[1:34:29] boaz as a kinsman redeemer how he had to
[1:34:32] come to be flesh
[1:34:33] now we see the attribute sons
[1:34:37] of his spirit have not yet entered into
[1:34:41] the word formed body
[1:34:44] but a theophany this body is subject
[1:34:48] to the word and earnest waiting for the
[1:34:52] earnest
[1:34:53] change of the body now the difference
[1:34:56] between him
[1:34:57] and you as a son see he
[1:35:01] was at the beginning the word
[1:35:05] and then morphed body he came in and
[1:35:07] lived in that in the person of
[1:35:09] melchizedek
[1:35:11] then later we never heard the lord
[1:35:13] melchizedek because he became jesus
[1:35:15] christ
[1:35:17] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:35:21] jesus christ now you bypass that
[1:35:24] because in that form he knowed all
[1:35:27] things
[1:35:28] and you have never been able to know
[1:35:30] that yet you come like adam like me
[1:35:33] you became from the attribute to the
[1:35:35] flesh
[1:35:37] to be tempted but when
[1:35:40] this life is finished here
[1:35:43] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:35:47] we have one already waiting
[1:35:52] that's where we go that is the word then
[1:35:55] we can look back and see what we've done
[1:35:57] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:35:59] become the word
[1:36:01] we've just become the flesh man not the
[1:36:04] word
[1:36:04] but and look clearly makes it clear
[1:36:09] you will never be the word unless you
[1:36:12] was the fault at the beginning
[1:36:14] that proves a predestination of god
[1:36:18] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:36:20] thought you had to be in a thinking
[1:36:22] first
[1:36:23] but to see an artist and temptation you
[1:36:25] had to bypass the theophany
[1:36:28] you had to come down your flesh to be
[1:36:30] tempted by sin
[1:36:33] and that if you stand all the father
[1:36:35] hath given me
[1:36:37] will come to me
[1:36:40] i'll raise him up at the last days
[1:36:43] see you had to be first and then you see
[1:36:46] he
[1:36:47] come right down the regular line from
[1:36:50] attribute to before the foundation of
[1:36:54] the world his name's put on the lamb's
[1:36:55] book of life
[1:36:56] then from that he become the word the
[1:36:58] theophany that could appear
[1:37:00] disappear and then he become flesh
[1:37:04] and return back again resurrected that
[1:37:07] same body in a glorified condition
[1:37:11] but you bypass the theophany and become
[1:37:14] flesh man to be tempted
[1:37:18] by sin and then if this earthly
[1:37:21] tabernacle is dissolved
[1:37:23] we have one already waiting amen we have
[1:37:26] not yet
[1:37:27] the bodies but look when this body
[1:37:30] receives
[1:37:30] the spirit of god the immortal life
[1:37:33] inside of it
[1:37:34] it throws this body in
[1:37:37] subjection to god
[1:37:40] hallelujah he that's born of god does
[1:37:44] not convince you
[1:37:45] amen cannot sin romans 8 1 there is
[1:37:48] therefore now no condemnation
[1:37:50] to them that are in christ jesus they
[1:37:53] walk
[1:37:53] not actually after the spirit
[1:37:56] there you are see that throws your body
[1:38:00] subject you don't have to say oh if i
[1:38:02] can just quit drinking about
[1:38:03] this just get in christ it's all gone
[1:38:07] see because your body is subject
[1:38:12] to the spirit it's no more subject to
[1:38:16] the things of the world they're dead
[1:38:18] they are dead your sins are buried
[1:38:22] and baptism and you are a new creation
[1:38:25] in christ
[1:38:27] and your body becoming subject to the
[1:38:29] spirit
[1:38:30] try to live a right kind of life like
[1:38:33] you women claiming you got
[1:38:34] holy ghost and going out here and
[1:38:36] wearing sharks and things
[1:38:39] how could you do it how could the spirit
[1:38:41] of god in you ever let you do such a
[1:38:42] thing as that
[1:38:44] it just can't be sown certainly it can't
[1:38:47] be
[1:38:48] he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy
[1:38:51] spirit
[1:38:52] and then when you become subject to that
[1:38:54] spirit it throws your whole being
[1:38:57] subject to that spirit
[1:39:00] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:39:03] but this
[1:39:04] seed word made manifest are quickened
[1:39:10] hallelujah
[1:39:12] and when the bible said don't do this
[1:39:14] that body
[1:39:15] quickly turns to it no question
[1:39:19] and what is it it's the earnest
[1:39:23] of the resurrection amen this body will
[1:39:26] be raised up again because it's
[1:39:28] already started it was once subject to
[1:39:31] sin and admire
[1:39:32] and corruption but now it's got the
[1:39:34] earnest has turned heaven
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:38] now that's the earnest that you're going
[1:39:40] in the rapture
[1:39:42] it's the earnest a sick person laying
[1:39:44] down
[1:39:45] nothing left but death that's all can
[1:39:48] happen
[1:39:49] i've seen the shadows of people done eat
[1:39:52] up with
[1:39:52] cancer and tuberculosis and see them
[1:39:55] persons a little while after that
[1:39:57] perfectly normal and strong
[1:40:00] if there is no divine healing then
[1:40:02] there's no resurrection
[1:40:05] because divine healing is earnest of the
[1:40:07] resurrection
[1:40:09] amen you know what the earnest money is
[1:40:11] don't you it's a down payment
[1:40:14] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:40:16] when the stripes were healed
[1:40:18] notice how wonderful
[1:40:22] we loving now this body is subject
[1:40:26] to the spirit have not yet entered into
[1:40:30] the word form
[1:40:32] but we are still in the flesh form but
[1:40:35] subject to the word
[1:40:38] death in the flesh will take us there
[1:40:42] just the same thing think of a little
[1:40:44] baby
[1:40:45] you can take a woman no matter how evil
[1:40:48] she is when she is pregnant
[1:40:51] and fixing to be mother watch before
[1:40:54] that baby's born
[1:40:55] i don't care how cruel the woman is she
[1:40:57] gets real kind
[1:40:59] there's something about her sound seems
[1:41:01] godly
[1:41:02] you'll see a little mother fix and
[1:41:04] become mother
[1:41:06] by the baby why is it that little body
[1:41:10] now it's not alive yet see the only
[1:41:13] thing it is
[1:41:14] is just flesh and muscles that little
[1:41:16] jumping that's his muscles jerking
[1:41:19] but when it comes forth from the womb
[1:41:22] god breathes the breath of life into it
[1:41:26] and then he screams out
[1:41:29] see just as sure as there
[1:41:33] is a natural body being formed
[1:41:36] there is a spiritual body to receive it
[1:41:39] as soon as it gets here
[1:41:42] then when a man is born again
[1:41:46] from heaven he becomes a spirit
[1:41:50] babe in christ and then
[1:41:53] when this robe of flesh is dropped
[1:41:57] there is a natural body theophany
[1:42:01] a body not made with hands neither born
[1:42:03] of a woman that we go to
[1:42:07] then that body returns back and picks up
[1:42:10] the glorified body
[1:42:12] that's the reason jesus went to hell
[1:42:14] when he died and preached to the souls
[1:42:16] that were in prison
[1:42:20] turn back into that theophany
[1:42:26] oh marvelous thank god
[1:42:30] ii corinthians 5 1 if this earthly body
[1:42:34] beat is dissolved it's earthly
[1:42:35] tabernacle
[1:42:36] we have another one see we have bypassed
[1:42:40] that to come straight from god
[1:42:42] the attribute to be fleshed to be
[1:42:44] tempted and trusted
[1:42:46] by sin like adam did
[1:42:49] but when testing of his word
[1:42:54] is over then we are taken up to this
[1:42:58] body
[1:42:59] that was prepared for us before the
[1:43:01] foundation of the world
[1:43:02] it is the word there that we skip to
[1:43:05] come right around
[1:43:07] down here to be tempted and tested if we
[1:43:09] had to come through that there had been
[1:43:10] no temptation we'd known all things
[1:43:13] that's reason jesus knowed all things
[1:43:16] because he was
[1:43:17] word before he was flesh
[1:43:21] then we become the word here we are
[1:43:25] formed to the word image
[1:43:29] that'll be a partaker of the word feed
[1:43:32] on the word
[1:43:34] by being predestinated since the
[1:43:36] beginning you see that little spark of
[1:43:39] life
[1:43:40] that you had in you from the beginning
[1:43:42] when you started your journey
[1:43:43] many of you can remember you join this
[1:43:45] church and join that church and try this
[1:43:47] and that
[1:43:48] nothing satisfying right but
[1:43:51] one day you just recognized it
[1:44:00] if if this doesn't get you to go home
[1:44:02] and
[1:44:03] listen to this tape i don't know
[1:44:07] i just don't have anything in me to stir
[1:44:11] you up
[1:44:13] but we'll just leave it right there amen
[1:44:17] do you see that
[1:44:19] how we didn't get that word body we
[1:44:21] skipped around it
[1:44:23] but but he gave us the spirit to be
[1:44:26] subject to
[1:44:27] as an earnest it it's a beautiful thing
[1:44:31] i know there's little things that skip
[1:44:33] over
[1:44:34] our lives you know i've been in the
[1:44:37] message i guess 50 some years
[1:44:40] i've read this book have it marked up
[1:44:42] but it's never
[1:44:44] been as real to me as it is right now
[1:44:49] and i i don't know if it got any realer
[1:44:53] what would happen
[1:44:57] but the
[1:45:00] the thing that's beautiful is to
[1:45:03] understand
[1:45:04] the changing state of god
[1:45:08] the amorphy he appeared that abraham
[1:45:12] changed from he was an original
[1:45:16] before he became flesh and
[1:45:19] and and you i just can't explain it any
[1:45:22] better i just keep wanting to explain it
[1:45:23] but i can't give you revelation
[1:45:27] you know if i could give you revelation
[1:45:30] you would all be
[1:45:32] little davids now tell me that wouldn't
[1:45:35] be a mess
[1:45:40] right but if he gives you revelation
[1:45:43] you'll be little jesus
[1:45:47] that's what he said
[1:45:50] amen that's why revelation is so
[1:45:52] important well i really hope you enjoyed
[1:45:55] the word today and and uh
[1:45:58] it's it's it's just wonderful uh
[1:46:02] what this great revelation is but
[1:46:04] there's one thing that we know for sure
[1:46:07] and becomes a really revelation to us
[1:46:11] that we already have a body prepared for
[1:46:14] us
[1:46:16] that body was is in his thinking so as
[1:46:18] soon as that baby is born
[1:46:21] right there's a spiritual body
[1:46:24] that's waiting in his thinking because
[1:46:26] they came together
[1:46:28] because of predestination and when this
[1:46:31] one be dissolved
[1:46:33] we have one waiting and that's why it's
[1:46:36] in thought
[1:46:37] form now but when it we get that
[1:46:40] thought-form body
[1:46:42] then it becomes and picks up a glorified
[1:46:45] body so we move from from a whole
[1:46:48] different
[1:46:49] realm it's not the flesh as we know
[1:46:51] flesh
[1:46:53] can you imagine having a body with no
[1:46:55] temptation
[1:46:57] no limitations walking through walls and
[1:47:02] walking on water and and yet
[1:47:05] recognizable and being able to talk and
[1:47:08] eat
[1:47:08] and and now
[1:47:12] my goodness it hasn't even entered into
[1:47:14] the thoughts in the hearts of men
[1:47:16] the things that god has prepared for
[1:47:18] them that love them
[1:47:20] you know what what a what a stirring
[1:47:24] of the spirit and let me say this
[1:47:27] this people reject this message
[1:47:30] look at what they're rejecting
[1:47:36] you know everything shows how god had to
[1:47:40] come down
[1:47:41] there's only one person god
[1:47:45] you know we get all mixed up about a lot
[1:47:47] of things because we're trying to put
[1:47:50] them together
[1:47:51] in our mind but we did you see he says
[1:47:54] we were a part of his life did you hear
[1:47:58] him say that
[1:48:01] but we we would have never known that he
[1:48:03] said
[1:48:04] because we would just been a part of his
[1:48:06] life
[1:48:08] so we try to take it but
[1:48:12] all the fullness of god was in
[1:48:15] the whole plan of god the word of god no
[1:48:18] one being had
[1:48:22] the fullness of god in them except
[1:48:26] the amorphy
[1:48:30] theophany person
[1:48:34] that became jesus
[1:48:37] everybody else was a part
[1:48:40] of the puzzle all the parts of the
[1:48:44] puzzle come together
[1:48:46] to make the full picture nobody else pre
[1:48:51] had the whole thing that knew all things
[1:48:54] so remember
[1:48:55] attribute god forms himself into a
[1:48:58] person
[1:48:59] that person is the fullness of the
[1:49:01] godhead
[1:49:02] then that person takes on
[1:49:06] a body
[1:49:09] right not made with hands no father no
[1:49:12] mother
[1:49:13] no beginning of days no end takes that
[1:49:16] body
[1:49:17] he eats he
[1:49:20] talks that's that same person
[1:49:24] then he said you don't hear no more of
[1:49:27] that person
[1:49:28] because he became jesus
[1:49:33] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:49:38] nobody else is the fullness of the
[1:49:40] godhead bodily because
[1:49:42] we're all members
[1:49:45] in particular part of the body
[1:49:49] the part that was taken out of him in
[1:49:52] type in
[1:49:53] adam so now you see the invisible union
[1:50:00] is that all the pieces and the one
[1:50:03] be coming together again so the fullness
[1:50:06] is in him
[1:50:07] and us together but yet we're still
[1:50:11] members in particular
[1:50:13] if all the fullness of god dwelt in
[1:50:16] brother branham
[1:50:17] then that would have been two eternal
[1:50:20] persons
[1:50:22] and you'd have two gods and there's a
[1:50:24] lot of people that believe in
[1:50:26] tunis they believe there's god
[1:50:31] and jesus
[1:50:34] but all jesus was was the flesh
[1:50:38] form right
[1:50:41] but his body returned back
[1:50:47] to the word form and that's how he
[1:50:49] appeared you know
[1:50:51] he appears down to the rest of the
[1:50:53] scriptures it's a
[1:50:55] it's a beautiful thing but it is deity
[1:50:58] and that's why jesus was deity
[1:51:02] do you know why he was deity because he
[1:51:03] wasn't born to flesh
[1:51:07] his body was deity because god
[1:51:10] was absolutely the father of his flesh
[1:51:15] that's why it could be the same person
[1:51:17] that came to melchizedek
[1:51:20] because he didn't use mary's seed
[1:51:23] he created the flesh that he dwelt in
[1:51:28] so it's the same person the same god
[1:51:32] formed himself towards a person that
[1:51:35] person
[1:51:35] was the what thought of god expressed
[1:51:38] the word
[1:51:38] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:51:40] word was god and the word was
[1:51:43] made flesh that same person
[1:51:47] then so when when we
[1:51:50] came we came by the way of sin
[1:51:54] can you hear brother branham say that he
[1:51:56] said we come the same way
[1:51:58] adam did and i did
[1:52:04] so that's where we come it's the
[1:52:07] difference in the person
[1:52:08] but the part that we play is we're a
[1:52:11] part of that person
[1:52:14] and he types that out so many types
[1:52:17] about
[1:52:18] the animals the bucks and the does and
[1:52:21] the
[1:52:21] bulls and the cows and the and
[1:52:24] and and the david and solomon and
[1:52:27] of many member bride but what one
[1:52:30] bridegroom
[1:52:30] it's a beautiful part that we're of and
[1:52:33] the whole beautiful part about this
[1:52:35] message
[1:52:36] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:52:39] the book of revelations is the
[1:52:41] revelation and
[1:52:42] that's what's so marvelous is now we can
[1:52:46] find our place
[1:52:47] in the plan of god and know who we are
[1:52:51] and realize how eternally
[1:52:54] secure we are in his thinking
[1:52:58] you don't have to worry you know
[1:53:01] because the very earnest that's right
[1:53:04] you understand
[1:53:05] is what makes your body hate sin amen
[1:53:12] he who loves god hates sin
[1:53:17] the sins and the temptation of the
[1:53:18] weakness of our flesh
[1:53:20] but every time there's something happens
[1:53:22] or we make a mistake we cry abba father
[1:53:28] so it's not an idea that you're running
[1:53:30] around
[1:53:31] sinning and everything no you hate it
[1:53:33] you hate it
[1:53:36] i hate the way that david mcgary is
[1:53:41] thank god that when this earthly body
[1:53:45] be dissolved so what where am i at now
[1:53:50] i'm subject to the word of god
[1:53:54] i the spirit of god what convicts me of
[1:53:57] sin
[1:53:59] and when i'm convicted of sin we quickly
[1:54:02] repent
[1:54:03] any man who says he has sinned not is a
[1:54:07] liar but we have a practitioner
[1:54:10] right one that already paid the price
[1:54:14] and now he sends his spirit his spirits
[1:54:16] can
[1:54:17] constantly convicting us of sin
[1:54:21] of unbelief constantly reveal revealing
[1:54:24] the work
[1:54:25] constantly correcting us constantly
[1:54:28] because we're in this great conflict but
[1:54:31] that's not to make us feel bad
[1:54:35] that's to make us know that that spark
[1:54:37] of life
[1:54:40] is still working in us trying to return
[1:54:43] home
[1:54:45] home home oh peace and a spirit didn't
[1:54:50] he
[1:54:51] and it seals us until the day of our
[1:54:54] redemption when one glad morning
[1:54:58] we'll fly away god bless you let's stand
[1:55:01] together
[1:55:02] amen have you enjoyed who is this
