Description:
Br. Randy Vertin
Wednesday Evening Service: June 10,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

relationship we ask for you through your word this evening to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above that which we could ask or think we ask your grace to hold us and keep us father we ask that

invite you to be our portion this evening we ask all these things Lord Jesus of the Father in your precious name we pray amen amen bless you this evening I'm real excited to have brother Randy back ministering with us this evening as you know that brother Randy's probably in the top 5% of smartness in the United States and and he went on and was able to you'll agree with that right brother amen he never disagrees with the pastor so I'm a glad I can say that I really I think everybody in here is this your genius because the world's not smart enough to know what's going on and you're all inand elect and get it go in the rapture that's as bright as you can get right there that is sheer genius and I know brother Randy's part of that so we know how smart everybody really is that loves the Lord amen the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but he he accomplished a great deal he's went through severe training and and growth and all those wonderful things to become an air-traffic controller which is one of the more difficult and stressful jobs and and and so we have an air traffic controller with us we have a pilot with us so between the two of them I'm sure we can get on the right path and get to where we need to go so we're glory about that but I know you're gonna enjoy brother Randy's ministry he's proven through his life that he's a believer and I know the love of God is shed abroad in his heart and so I'm just happy for this evening I'm and so we're just going to sing only believe that's our national anthem I'd like to sing national anthem is our brother comes and ministers the word I'll be recited aside let's really pull on brother Randy let's just suck everything out of them Intel he's a sponge that's been wrung so dry then he'll just have to run and get a drink of water hey man so I just want I'm a workaholic but I want you to work brother Randy to death tonight every time a little thought comes to you just pull on it pull on it pull on it and so where he gets to the place he doesn't even know what he's saying you're just pulling the ministry right out of them this evening you believe we can do that I believe we can do that because I believe were God's children and I believe we're hungry and God has chosen our brother to feed us tonight we thirst and he's chosen him to get the waters of life tonight let's see only believe as our brother comes to minister the word [Music] that same Jesus is here because he is [Music] [Music] amen god bless you this evening it's a privilege to stand before the people of God it's a humbling thing that you know brother David would have confidence to stand behind the pulpit we know we know we hesitate you know they say his pulpit but we know it's the Lord's pulpit but the Lord's given him stewardship of that and just appreciate the Lord that's Brotherhood it's not gonna be hard for people to squeeze things out of me because I sweat a lot so I've been doing a lot doing walking for exercise and I go out and it's really hot here and I weighed myself this week before and after and I lost eight pounds in two hours just from sweating it all out so by the grace of God let's turn let's turn in our Bibles to a couple scriptures here let's go to Romans chapter 1 verse 16 just appreciate everything that the Lord is doing you know we're seeing the say those cogs those wheels of prophecy seem to be turning faster and faster you know and I thank the Lord for it because we know that that great machine of God that he's put in place before the foundation of the world has got one thing in mind for us and that's a rapture and so I just am so thankful that you know we're able to see these things by the grace of God Romans chapter 1 verse 16 enough if you just want to keep it in mind we're gonna turn also to Habakkuk chapter 2 but we'll start here and we'll just start at verse 15 in the book of Romans chapter 1 so as much as ended as is in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for their'n is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and we'll turn over to Habakkuk chapter 2 you know I'm trying to get before the Lord and see what he might want you to say and so many times it kind of feels like not that I can see these things but it kind of feels like I'm praying before the Lord trying to think of a you know the Lord will drop different thoughts and you just sometimes it feels like there's just a bunch of threads laying there because we know that the scripture is just infinite and just pray that the Lord would help us to grab the right thread this evening and follow it wherever he would have us to go and we'll just read starting at verse one said I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak are we at the end time I believe we've heard the vision speak in our day and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry and we'll just read verse 4 also because I just realized now it ties exactly in with the scripture we just read said Behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith amen let's just buy our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just come humbly before you Lord Lord God knowing that before the foundation of the world you are dangerous to this place o God nothing that happens in our lives is a surprise to you O God you Lord your the the great I am the Lord that was from the beginning and is now and shall ever be O God and as we just come before you this evening Lord we just pray that you'd get all of us out of the way Lord as lord I don't want to speak my own thoughts Lord it wouldn't profit anybody to hear the thoughts of a man but O God if we could just get out of the way and just hear just a word from you Lord would be enough Lord to get us to where we need to go o God Lord I just think of the day that you spoke those words Lord when you said unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you you have no part in me and so many turned and went away and Lord do turn to your disciples and said will you go to and Peter could only say Lord where else would we go for you alone have the words of eternal life and Lord God we can say that this evening out God we don't understand maybe things that happen in our lives or there's different things Lord that occur maybe we don't always understand it or see it the way we ought to O God but where else would we go Lord Jesus you're the only one that has eternal life of God and will follow you Lord to the ends of the earth Lord we would go by your grace Lord and tonight we just pray that you would have your preeminence in the service Lord may you speak to your people get me out of the way Lord anoint the speaker anoint the hear Lord let your perfect will be done Lord and may you get glory unto yourself in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated forgive me I just get really nervous but you know we're just trusting in the Lord you know every breath that we take we don't realize is an act of faith it just it becomes so normal to us that we we don't even realize that we're doing it and I believe that the the God is looking for us to get to a place in him that we can just make living for him like breathing hey man where it was just in him we live and breathing and him we live and move and have our being every breath we take is by his grace I just maybe would like to speak you know I had this thought in my mind and and then the Lord kind of turned it I want to heard what we had ministered this Sunday morning and that's what we read the scripture there in Romans chapter 1 verse 16 on the gospel it says you know a brother David was preaching and talked about the gospel not just being in Word I'm gonna I'm gonna read this quote just real quick before I forget because sometimes I forget things because I just happened to Lourdes kind of led me to this message and I've been listening to it a couple times and it hit this point in the message it's it's the five definite identifications of the true Church of the Living God and I heard this and I said my goodness that is if that isn't what we just heard on Sunday I don't know what is and it just felt so more its fed alive and brother Branham says in that sermon he says how many knows what the gospel is he says not the word that we put that kind of in quotation marks he says not the word Paul said the gospel come to us not in word only but through the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost the gospel is the power of God to make the word act what it says it'll do preach the gospel all the world preach the gospel to just the white people or just the brown yellow/black to every creature amen every creature you believe that means that amen I believe it means that I've seen God baffle a bull one day I've seen him cause Hornets not to sting I seen him raise up an opossum that had been laying to head all night every creature the gospel will take effect upon anything that you ask he says you say that's wrong brother branham he says it isn't wrong jesus said to that tree cursed be you know man eat from you from henceforth and the gospel was preached to that tree hey in the head I feel religious right now I kind of feel it too since to every creature amen preach it to what every creature oh if we just had time for these things and then it's just skipping a few paragraphs but he says down here he says the last commission go into the world and preach the gospel he that believed in to end his baptize and I like what he says here this is what just struck me he says let me quote it the way it should be the way it's broke down go ye into all the world and to every nation and demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost amen he that believeth on this and his baptized shall be saved he that denies it will be damned these signs will follow them that believe they lay hands on the sick they shall recover they'll cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues this will be the signs that follows the last verse said and they returned the Lord working with them confirming his word with signs following and the last little bit just in the last paragraph here and he talks about it we've heard this kind of quote said many different times and brother branham's mentioned it many different ways and the same kind of idea he says brother Branham we look at it all these churches seeing what they're doing and there's no doubt we see that today thousands and thousands of them he says that's grafted vines he says now you can graph to sit your feet you can take an orange tree put a lemon on it and it'll grow that's what you that's what man grafted in and these organizations is what man grafted in it's a lemon tree all the time it'll grow because it's stuck out in the church name but let me tell you if that tree ever puts forth another branch itself a toe bear an orange and if the power of God can we say it the way he just kind of explained it to us if the gospel could I say it like that if the gospel would ever put forth another church it'll be another Pentecost and another book of Acts will be wrote behind it because it's the Church of God and I just couldn't help but get struck when I heard that it really stirred me up because I kind of had the thought that I kind of had and my heart and I guess just to give it a title because that's kind of what everybody seems to do for the most part except for the David is that is I just kind of had an idea a thought of stepping into the vision you know the world we see the world just going absolutely insane and I'm not even gonna get into the politics because there's no use in it you know there's no use in discussing politics because it's just that's the domain of the devil anyway we know the Prophet said that those are his kingdoms that's the way it's gonna be he already had possession of it but the Lord said you can have that because I'll come here to it in the Millennium amen but we know the world is insane I mean we're living it right now we're seeing it around us and what we're in the time gross darkness upon the people darkness that can be felt I mean I mean I if even if you're not spiritual you say oh I'm not a spiritual person you can feel it just everywhere you go when you when you walk outside and you go to the store and you see everything that you're seeing and and Lord forgive me sometimes just lord help me to get my thoughts you know get his thoughts in the right place here but you know I if I could just say it this way I often looked listened to the message and I hear the things that brother Branham says and if I could maybe like they say take the other side of it just for an example i standing in their shoes looking back at history I could understand naturally why so many people would have thought he was crazy especially when we see what we see today you know brother branham's talking about the the women just bobbing off their hair and going around naked and seeing all these things and if you look back at the 50s in the 60s and everything compared to what we have today the the people listening to what brother Branham was saying would say this guy's crazy it's not that bad but we understand a prophet was seeing things in a way he saw the seed form of those spirits that were there and he was seeing you know he could see past the veil of time that he was living in I'm sorry I gotta take this off these things never fit me very well forgive me I just know the way I fit into clothes if I move around too much you're just gonna hear it and it's gonna rip off it's just always been that way for me but but but he was seeing that seed form you know that prophet that gift of a prophet being able to see kind of go beyond as we could say we call it the curtain of time and see what future present events had happened and seeing the future events to come that that spirit of God that could lift him up beyond the mortal coil and could see those things there's no wonder though that the people might have thought he was crazy seeing surely I these women aren't walking around completely naked no doubt that there were some there that were you know the men maybe didn't look as bad as they do now they say well it doesn't look that bad compared to what it was a few years ago but he could see the end of the thing from the beginning could see what the fruit of that seed was going to bring what what the tree was going to grow up to be what what the fruits would put forth at the end time he was seeing our day so when we can look see hindsight is 20/20 as they say so when we when we can look back at the message now if we could even put ourselves into those shoes to what they would have seen we know by the grace of God we still would have believed it because the the Spirit of God in us as we heard even from our pastor this Sunday that seed that we talked about so much it can't do anything but believe the word it may not have been able to understand two things the way we can't now but I can see when brother Branham talked about come would I believe it's coming up the escalator and and hearing the noises in the groaning and seeing the women looking like they were gangrene everywhere and all the makeup and things surely we see that now so alive we're seeing the prophecy being made manifest more and more all the time and in the thing we don't even realized as we talk about we're talking about stepping into the vision and we don't realize sometimes that worked we're living in that vision right now that he was seen when he was preaching these things and prophesying these things were we are actually walking step by step actually entering into the vision that brother Branham was seen if he if we could bring him back right now and say brother Branham what do you think about it he'd say that's exactly what I was talking about there's no doubt about it you know and so many people would have looked at him you're crazy I don't see every woman in the world wearing pants they don't even have the courtesy to do that anymore they don't wear anything anymore and he was talking about it then the men don't look like men anymore that now it's gotten so bad we know that what the world is now to where they can say one's one and ones the other and this is that you could be whatever you want that completely cast aside even what natural reasoning would be but the scripture says they would do it it said they would even cast aside natural affections we're living in that vision and it's so easy to see the negative side of that vision because we're seeing the world i-i-i-i've you know I just go in here because this cuz when I was the Lord's leading but I I was listening to a guy the other day and he's kind of talks about some political things and stuff and I heard something that just absolutely chilled me you know and I meant to go get it and just print it out and send it some people and maybe I'll look it up again but apparently there was an archbishop from Rome like a really high up archbishop from Rome who sent a letter to Donald Trump and the guy read the whole letter on the air and everything and and if you listen you know without a spiritual aspect it sounds so good but he could he goes into talking about how the world's going crazy and and the people are going insane and a lot of things that you could even agree I heard some of the things I said that's actually right he's right out about certain things why because Satan he puts the truth in there he doesn't always just cast aside the truth but he's adulterated adulterated of just a little bit because remember we're going back to the Garden of Eden again and in the Garden of Eden he didn't just come out and say just worship me he said half God not said he brought the word first and then he slides in that that little devil that little serpent and but the thing that the thing that got me was that just right away just kind of they say my intent is good who kind of went up it's a while okay this is but it goes to show the insanity of the world is one of the first things in the letter he said was that we know that the children of light are more than the children of darkness I said well you lying devil because we know that's not the word he said mean we know the scripture says but more of the children of the bondwoman are the free I saw it you lyin devil you're right there but the rest of it see he throws that thing in right there many people wouldn't know their scripture don't know their word would just they go right into because it does sound so good and but the reason I say that is because it's so easy to look on the negative side because we're surrounded by remember he said that that little that predestinated number he said she'd be a small little group but the thing is is there is a vision for the people of God in this day there is a vision that God has not only just for the bride but for your life he's got something for you he's got a life that can live through you he's got a work for you to do whether you be old young small you know sister brother doesn't matter you have a part to play because you're part of the body with with the body can't you can't go without a part of your body the body of Christ will be a hole it will be firmly and faintly joint together it won't be missing one thing you know and I just I can't I thought about it I just you know we've the world sometimes I almost get I say jealous but if you if you understand it the way I mean it jealous of the world because they so easily fall into the vision that Satan has for them they so easily just go right with that spirit the world that just swept up in it one thing comes and they'll just whoop they just go right with it why because it's eat is Satan spirits easy to get into now it's everywhere they bumped it's bombarding the flesh and the people out there in the world they just Satan throw something at them and they just go right with it Satan throw something else at them they just go right with it they they see the thing is and Satan's got him convinced that it's not even a spiritual thing it's just it's just the way life is because they can't their carnal mind is enmity with God it can't even comprehend the things of God and because of that I still remember these probably couple years ago when brother David preached in and it's just stuck with me ever since how they talked about you haft he brought up the quarter brother branham said he said you have to know that the devil is real and you recognize him real and see it it's just like the you know we know that the devil is running to and fro and it's so easy to see that but the devil what does he do he comes and he blinds us to God in our midst right now he tries to take you out of that spiritual place where the work of God can be done in your life he tries to draw you out from the presence of God just like the Garden of Eden he tries to entice he who tries to throw little things here and there why because he knows the devil knows the word better than you do he knows he knows the message better than you do he knows the quotes backwards and forwards and what did we know what's the what's the quote leaves all the time if the true church could get the true revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the church see and if we can recognize and resist the spirit of the devil see he comes to church just as much as you do more than a lot of us he's here every service why because he's a faithful adversary and he he's a good adversary he's always there to puppet you and you have to recognize that his only goal is to keep you from getting to the place that God has for you in your life and you've got to recognize that the thing that God has for you is his word if I could say this way it is that gospel that brother David spoke about this Sunday that we just read it is the power to demonstrate the Word of God living in a man today people sometimes we try to get these deep revelations and they're great there's nothing wrong with that but if we could get one revelation about brother Branham you know the Prophet is that God could take a fallen man and work through him so powerfully that the world would think that he was Jesus Christ himself that there were people who thought that that and I've said this before many times a long time ago I'm sure but it is in my heart so strong I can't help but say it again the devil has got it in our minds that brother Branham is and I say brother Branham is in the life that he lived not the man we get rid of the man in that sense we want the life that that life that was in brother Branham is unattainable because you're not a prophet true may I mean we may have some among us some minor ones for all I know God didn't stop working God's got those gifts they're still out there but he the devil puts it in your mind oh you can't achieve that you can't achieve that life cuz you're not a prophet he makes it somewhat attainable but I'm here to tell you that that life that he lived that we so many times almost glorified to a point of idolatry that depth we because we put her off the man and it really put it off the life of Jesus Christ and put it on the man but the life that he lived is not only attainable it is what is required in this day that is the life required of you and I and we need to get in to the spirit of the vision that was preached to us through this message to see that the gospel the power of God can live in you and me every single day I'm preaching to myself because we're blinded so many times to it because of our own faults because we live in this flesh nobody knows the secrets of your flesh like you do nobody knows those things that you struggle with like you do you're the one that has to wake up every day and look yourself in the mirror and the devil's right there to say you ain't nothing how could you possibly serve God in that condition but because you say what I've been serving the Lord for so long it should get better and better and better but that's not true it will never be that way why I think about the story I don't remember names I'm terrible but you'll know the story I'm talking about about the the preacher who had the dream that he died and was going up towards that light and remember what was it as he got closer and closer and closer to that light all the things that he thought weren't so bad those little shady deals those little attitudes that he had they began to darken they became to become so obvious and so is it with us that was just an example these things weren't set in a vacuum they're said for our edification why because the closer you get to the Lord the more those little things that you thought you could get away with before become more darkened and evil to you and the devils right senator accuse you no matter how far you've come he's there to tell you you can't go any farther I'm could you how could you do that praise the Lord for that because I say devil you just exposed yourself now I know when I got a cut out next amen yes Lord see the scripture says that the Lord said he'd take the wise in his own craftiness see the devil thinks he's so smart well you did this and you did that well yeah that's true oh maybe it was even something you didn't think was so bad before well thank you thanks devil you just exposed my next conquest you exposed the next part of the land and I'm about to go chop your head off hey man there's a vision for the people of God in this hour to live and it was shown through the life of William Branham it was a life of overcoming and was a life full of mistakes I thank the Lord for a prophet that could be honest enough to get up here and tell you things that would embarrass him that would make no doubt throw from a pride standpoint you wouldn't want to say people are looking T could you imagine the pressure he knew that there were people who knew he was a prophet and yet the Lord would put it on his heart to come up and bare all of his faults before the people why because it's to show that he was just a man just like Paul he was a man of like passions why but the grace of God was sufficient for him it's sufficient for you and that light it's not just this bar that we look at and say oh I only I could do it but I can't because I'm I'm not this or I'm not that know that life it's the only thing that will get us out of here it's the only thing that will do it the Holy Ghost the life of God in you is the only thing that's coming out of here that's all that can go cuz it's got to be like him this flesh can't do it your thoughts can't do it your own your own intentions those are great there's that's great and sometimes I feel like we need to actually trust that more trust the Lord in you I love what brother David preached it I am just put like it's a piggybacking off of what he preached but I thought about I said you know what the devil is like no you shouldn't do that they're just gonna think you're reap reaching when you preach I said you know what devil the Prophet said when someone's got the ball you get out in front you block for the guy with the ball so I'm gonna block for the guy with the ball but the thing is the devil gets us so caught up in it and now we sit there and say well I can't do it this and that you're always making excuses but what did brother David say was right towards the end authority said do all that's in your heart why because when the Holy Ghost is in you and your intentions are right and and the word doesn't say anything against it do you think it's a devil telling you to go pray for your brother or sister but we'll reason ourselves right out of it in that right oh the Lord will put it on your heart just out of nowhere you know brother David you know brother David jr. he's I just for some reason I got him on my heart maybe I should text him and see how he's doing and just tell him I'm praying for him oh well he just kind of think you're being weird or something that that's you don't realize that's the devil and you and you you he's got the devil's got us in the flesh I say it only in the flesh he's I'm so trained to trust our reasoning because from the womb that we were taught to trust but to trust our own reasoning that we will go the complete opposite way that God has us to go and we'll be completely confident that that's where we should be going and I just using that as a simple example I what about the sister that brother branham tells the testimony but before the service the sister has the child who was sick and the sister felt a pull on her heart to go pray for that sister it said but she's what does she have she had a battle inside of her though I said oh but she wants to have brother branham pray for her not even realizing she was getting ready to step into the vision that she there is a pool there getting ready to step into that vision why because her hands were just as good as brother branham's hands if I could say this way brother Branham said it he said in a roundabout way I'm not trying to put words into his mouth but he basically said her hands were better than his hands because I just read the court I didn't get a chance to print it out or write it down but he said he said because that sister would have more compassion than I could have ever had for her because she might have she had children so in that moment God anointed that sister to step into that spot and that was the will of God but how many times will we be in that position and we would reason ourselves right out of it oh and she's got a prayer card you know that's the prophets place to do it or that's the pastor's place to do it I guarantee you brother David would be delighted to know that the that the people in the church are praying one for another you know because God works through his people to his people the barneys Finley joined together you know and we've got to be able to see the vision for ourselves we got to be able to walk into that vision amen you know but so many times are our thoughts and God's thoughts get so far apart you know and I think we could run through I'll just run through a couple examples here and we know these examples why because what happens is we're not getting into the spirit I have a quote here I just read this quote real quick just because again it sits on my heart and mine to read it and if I don't mm-hmm he says this is from the the message the hand of the Lord came upon him and I because I was thinking about it you know so many times we listen to a lot of messages and things and in our our mortal our little brains here can't you know we can't hope to reason ourselves or try to just figure it all out we have to rely upon the Lord he made us that way to rely upon him if he could rely upon our own our own power our own intellect then what what did Jesus Christ died for and raised again amen but I've been but it is so this so just touched me because this was the exact thought I had and then I just happened to look and I happened it just sprang right out and he's talking about Elijah he said there they stood before the Prophet he got his righteous indignation up to you holding his people to Calvinist Peter Presbyterian Baptist he just got plainly got angry that's all he says all right he got stirred up he looked over it Joe Harmon said why don't you go down to your own cold former church get you some preachers down there to ask this for you already really got his dandruff up said why don't you go down to your mother's prophets in your daddy's prophets yea kindly a halfway borderline why don't you go down to your own church he said why'd you come here he said but the Lord that's called us out here together and Elijah with his dandruff all up he said if it wasn't for that I respected Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you he said but he really got out of humor didn't he now when he did he got now when he did he got was all a plate when he got to a place like that he's in no condition for the spirit to come on but he said bring me a minstrel he says not even people that don't believe in playing music in church I wonder what you're gonna do with that he says but here he comes said bring me a minstrel go get out there in all the soldiers and see who can play the harp and play the stringed instruments and everything and get in here and play old-time religion for me or something so he get in there and here's the point we're getting to and they got in there remember because he's to the point he's trying to seek for something from the Lord he's a prophet looking for a vision he's looking for a word of the Lord he says so we get in there and they got in there L began to play maybe only to leave or something on that order of course they didn't have that song then but something on that order and this prophet I can see him sitting there start humming and patting his foot after a while he says what did he's getting in the spirit that's what the matter with the church tonight that's what's the matter with this meeting tonight if you can't get in the spirit you don't see nothing Elijah couldn't see something till he got in the spirit of it he said you have to get into the spirit of it before you can see it and that's where we need to be now we can never get to the place where we can step into this vision God has for us until we get in the spirit of the vision just like John on the Isle of Patmos he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and what is it it just is so simple it's just an entering in you know I didn't bring it all I probably should have gotten it all out of there but there's so much that we put up a reading for a long time but brother Branham basically talks about how we spoke in the beginning of how the world so easily jumps into the spirit of things you go go to a baseball game someone hits a homerun everybody just gets up on their feet what they're getting into the spirit they don't even know it but what is it there what have they done they immerse themselves into that atmosphere that's what they did they took themselves from where they were at home and they put themselves into an atmosphere a baseball game whatever it might be and they what do they do they immerse themselves in it and they become part of it and so as it has to be with the people of God if you want to see God work in your life immerse yourself in that atmosphere take yourself out of your own atmosphere get yourself in there's atmosphere how do you do that you listen you listen to the message you sing to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs these are things that we we failed to do every day maybe as much as we ought to but so simple a fool could not err therein why because when the Spirit of God that atmosphere is there then you can hear him not only can you hear but you can discern it properly to know when it's the Spirit of God versus just your own reasoning it's something you can't explain it you can't brother rid of all we said you cannot explain the supernatural you just can't do it we've spent so much trying trying but you can't educate yourself into this you cannot do it I don't care how many Bible studies you have I don't care how much you memorize it you cannot educate yourself into it I thought about this I'm just going to say that I wasn't going to necessarily go this this direction but I thought about this Scripture it never struck me this way until this Sunday and where they're talking about and then I was listening to this message the one that we caught her in the beginning there the five had definite identifications and something struck me I never thought before because brother Branham and that message is talking about that education he said they've tried to educate people and do this and try to educate people into it I thought about I said you know the scripture said even before the day of Pentecost I believe it was that he opened their understanding to the scripture I thought I never thought about that before they could understand more the scripture and they had even gone to Pentecost yet you can't educate yourself into it why because even Cain in the Garden of Eden God explained it to him face-to-face what the word was and he could not live it why because it's got to be a supernatural life in you to live it out it has to be did not he come down remember by their fruits you shall know them Abell prevent presented sacrifice it looks crazy we look crazy giving sacrifices of praise sacrificing our own rights in the day of people's rights when everybody wants their rights I got a right to this and I got a right to that and I want this and I want that it's it's the unholy trinity me myself and I only want a fist and I want that what does that not cane I want to do it my way god I think I mean I've pondered this so much and it just absolutely amazes me God could come down the cane face the face and say if you didn't even it didn't even make it a mystery no mystery you see what your brother did just do that go get you lamb and kill it no mystery and he couldn't do it oh my why because he said either to serve God the way I want to serve God isn't that the world today I'm a Christian I can do whatever I want a Christian a true Christian does whatever he wants or she wants because what they want is what he was we've gotten past so many times the simplicity the gospel that's why as I said you know God puts it on your heart to do something it's in the word go into all the world preach the gospel demonstrate the power of God God says pray for this person or just witness to him or say something and say well surely Lord that couldn't be you do you think the devil's telling you to witness the people really I mean now we can't take it all the way to the other side there may be circumstances where God has to rein you back from a certain thing just because you're always at the right doesn't mean it's the season for it you know Jesus knew exactly who Judas was and he let him continue so we never want to take it to one side of the other but but sometimes I hate to say it we become subtle reasoning that were without reason even the Lord said come let us reason together what do we we passed aside our own reasoning to take his reason so I just think though somebody tie it's so simple though and it's the power of God to be demonstrated in your life but look how easy it is to get outside of that take the Pharisees and the Sadducees looking for a messiah new he's coming at least from the outside look like they wanted it but what happened they weren't in the vision they couldn't see like God saw so when God said John the Baptist looked like a crazy man to them why because they couldn't get in the spirit of that vision what if they were in the spear every said you can't see any thing until you get in the spirit because only the Spirit of God can reveal it to you that's he's the only one that can do it he's always God we can't do this on our own we can't hope to think ourselves think our way out of it these people in the world took all the toilet paper and it like two days I say that just as a demonstration they're insane they're insane now the toilet paper is all back uh you know they're the world is insane we can't you know I talked to my wife all the time and we discuss things you know always discussing there what's happened in the world you know the Lord no I believe we're not ignorant to what's happening many times maybe we know more than we are don't know we should leave that to them I think more often than we do but we're not ignorant to see what's happening where we're living and we're it's just it's the world that we live in we see it there's so many times we had this discussion I say you know what I just usually end the discussion with you you can't figure them out except to say they're anointed to do what they're doing because a rational reasonable sane person would not do what they're doing it's just it's just the reality of the situation but we've so many times we try that we try to figure these things out mentally and we'll run ourselves in circles but you can't do that you can't the spiritual things are M nity they say the carnal things are eminently with the spiritual things they it says you can't even cut they can't even comprehend the spiritual things but think about it the Pharisees and the Sadducees they had their vision they had their vision of what the Messiah was going to be no doubt rolled out the red carpet from heaven armies of angels at both sides walking down I am the great Messiah Rome's going down I'm gonna take Rome out why because everybody kind of thought that didn't they will this time restore the kingdom you know because they were thinking carnally but he came completely the opposite not realizing all the things that were being fulfilled born in a manger a little baby baby jehovah and then they flee down to egypt why just so a scripture could be fulfilled I've called my son out of Egypt not knowing he's in the vision but they had their own vision over here and see that's where we're living now we have the world has their vision and they are living it then what's our vision where are we if they're living their vision so effectively because why because we see it in the word what they were doing they're doing it as it was in the days of life as it was in the days of Noah they are living their side of the beach if that's the case where are we because while I was going on there was a knee knock that was going up there there was an old building an ark there was an angel that came down to Abraham and Sarah so if they're living theirs what are we doing with ours we've got to step into that vision and the only way we can do it see it is to get in the spirit of it and then find our positions and I'm gonna get to that in a minute but let's just do another one so we just mentioned this but the Pharisees and the Sadducees for John the Baptist they had their idea we know that Elijah must first come where is he he already came went right by him didn't even see it why because they weren't in that vision why shouldn't a lot it shouldn't Elias first God he already did and weren't some of them even in that ministry didn't even maybe know what they were doing do you think it could have been like that in our days you there was a pool there they didn't understand it but there was something there in those people that followed the Prophet around and knew that there was something to it couldn't maybe put their finger on it cuz the season hadn't come yet but there was something there but they they all had their ideas of what Elias would be and he came totally contrary brother Branham where's Malachi 4:5 where's where's that he came you didn't even know God took a poor Kentucky preach the gospel of the world use him in a mighty way that hadn't been seen since the time of Jesus Christ and the world now wouldn't even know who he was no idea why because they're not in the vision they can't they can't step into that vision they're living their vision and the people of God as we get up towards the the top of that pyramid it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller but here we are this little group who can see something on the horizon we can see was it the little wash woman had the had the rancher son come down she had a promise the rest of them didn't have said I'm coming back for you they didn't know anything about that promise oh she could tell it to them but she's the only one that experienced she's the only one that heard the love whispers oh I love you I see a character in you I didn't seen anybody else oh I see I see if I could say a seed in you that was placed there before the foundation of the world and I've quickened that seed before he could leave he had to quicken that seed seed was quickened and it just started to bubble up and grow and she started making herself ready she couldn't help it why because she had a vision she was stepping into the vision she was making herself ready she was making her preparations she was should we just say you know as brother Branham would say you know reading her Bible praying every day listening to the message getting into that atmosphere where where those things could prepare her for the day that he would come so then when when he came and she could see the dust on the horizon she said it was time she could get ready and just leave all those girls in the dust and that's what we're going to do but the only way we can do that is to get into their vision it's to get into that spirit that says he's coming I know I've got a promise just like Abraham I don't know how he's going to do it I really don't cater how he does it I just know he will because he is faithful their promise we get caught up in that we get caught up in the house we get caught up in the why we get caught up in the room well the who is me I don't know about you I'm believing for you but I can't know you you know you I know me amen we seek out our own salvation with fear and trembling I'll speak blessings upon the people of God and say every one of us I believe we're gonna be there I will be that way but I can't know it I can only know for me so that's the who we don't have to worry about the who why because he said so that's good enough for me and I'm gonna cut the line there because if you dig down that line or why me oh how could he with me I've done this and I've done that yeah you're gonna get you weave yourself right out of it why because he said so from the foundation of the world he saw and planted something in you that he knew would believe this were that was this word that would be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone spirit of the spirit life of his life and he put that in there so you don't have to worry about the why how that doesn't matter at all why because he promised it when when God gave a promise to Abraham he didn't know how it was gonna happen how do we know he didn't know how because he tried about everything else he tried with Hagar he lied about you know Sarah being his wife all these different things were happening back and forth but I like it because the divine commentary Hebrews said he staggered out the promise so you can so you can live for God you can live for Jesus Christ with freedom knowing there's something in you because you don't know Alan how many times you fall in stumble I don't know about you but you know I struggle sometimes I've gone through severe depressions for years where I was just convinced that at least in my mind I was convinced there's no way I can I can make this I'm just I gotta be serpent seed there's no way I'm just being honest I am I'm not gonna put on any airs of anything because I'm a man uh-uh there's nothing you know that Jesus Christ has it saved me from and delivered me from that I you know what I have no shame in that sense because he saved me he's the one that's worthy if you look at this flesh you're gonna be disappointed dig deep enough and you'll always find something about yourself or someone else it's easy to criticize don't we live in a critical world it doesn't matter you could you could be a multi-billionaire and give it all the way to charity but you offended someone thirty years ago and you are dirt that's just in the natural and we do the same in the spiritual forgiveness we need forgiveness if we can't forgive one another how if you can't forgive your brother how are you going to love those out there if you can't look at the one sitting beside you I'm a frontline fighting with you and love them and forgive them then how are you gonna have love for the ones that are stoning you to death or that are out there chasing you down trying to kill you because it's coming there's got to be a love there there's got to be a defined love with forgiveness in our hearts amen yeah but the vision has got to be made plain to you but there's you know no matter how many times I've gotten down I it's supernatural there is something in my heart that always comes back and just says Lord I don't know anything else but to believe this ah it's like our brother our brother brother David our pastor preach on Sunday speak and go forward I don't know anything else but that there's nowhere else to go you'll give me a revelation that's perfect is what we have now with this message there anyone out there I mean if there is the Lord will give it to me because I believe it would be for me but there anyone out there but there's something in you that just can't help but just to continue going forward I mean no doubt over 25 years Abraham looking at Ishmael and knowing thinking about what happened there and all the things that transpired no doubt the devil was right there to accuse him no doubt he had his struggles you claim to believe the promise of God who you've never seen you're searching for a city whose supposed builder and maker is God you ain't seen no city and just live in a tent that's the truth he was seeking a supernatural City he didn't even maybe nobody was looking for but there was a pull in him that could not be stopped and there was something in each and every one of you I believe this evening that cannot be stopped why because God put it there and if he put it there he'll bring it to pass God you didn't put me in you can't put me out I didn't even put myself in Samara how hard the devil tries to get me to do it I can't put myself out so you might as well just surrender to the vision surrender to the things that God spoken of you in the word and just go forward Moses did the same thing they not description said he knew I mean we've heard brother Branham talk about it Moses knew he was meant to be a deliverer he was raised right he was taught spent 40 years learning all the ways of the Egyptians and no doubt and his natural mind because we know he failed so it had to be natural he was thinking the whole time he's sitting in military tactics class I'm gonna follow that one away that's gonna be great when I get the children of Israel all together we're gonna take these guys out why because he was naturally thinking and we know it because he slew the Egyptian and then he ran him why because he wasn't yet in the vision he could he could see it he knew that just right now I believe we know we know that there's a rapture we know that the power of God is real we've seen it I believe we've seen just little glimpses but we know it's real you can't take that devil can't take that away from you I was here when I heard brother Matt's testimony about that that bladder being healed not only that he experienced it you think the devil Devils going to absolutely try to take that away from him you don't think the Devils probably been on him say no that wasn't what the doctor thought it was you know this and that what he's always there to disparate this the work about you can you can bank on that one he's gonna be there but all we can do if say Lord you're the one that did it I don't know how it happened but Here I am we've seen too much one brother Brahim they say all God doesn't heal gods in view this a brother and say you're too late for that man I've seen way too much I've seen God in my life I look back Flint for years knew the message was right but God had seasons for everything you know and I thank the Lord for it you know what because there's one day I was sitting maybe one day I'll tell the whole testimony but I one day I was sitting in Denver at my computer because I just kind of felt stirred and something in me hadn't gone to church in like two years and just was depressed if I had had any courage I probably would kill myself but I knew too much about God and I was too scared to do that so I just kind of huddled to myself it didn't do anything to talk to anybody for years and one day I up I was on Facebook because I only I made a fake Facebook because I didn't want anybody to know that I was trying to see what my friends were doing and I didn't I was too ashamed to let them know that I was kind of spying on him and seeing how everybody was doing because I was felt on the outside looking in I'm just being real we're humans were flesh-and-blood now I'm gonna expose the devil every chance I get because I'm tired of the devil hiding behind pride does the scripture not say to confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that's what we ought to be doing we ought to be exposing that death but anyway and I happened to read something for brother Simon Smith and he just it was just a simple little Facebook post and he doesn't even really use Facebook hardly and he just her a little Facebook post because they had some meetings or some revival meetings he said man those were the most powerful meetings I had ever been to just a little post and stuff that struck me because that's like I can't I came in the message around the Lord revealed this message to me right around the same time as him knowing him for years really good friends like me I've been in a lot of meetings with that guy those were the best he's ever been in man what was I missing haha and something spoke to my heart and it was God because it couldn't have anything else because at that time I wasn't even trying to help myself I was probably totally insane because like brother branham said I've seen man would tried to help himself but I was just wallowing in my own misery and something spoke to my harness it and you're gonna miss a rapture for this and this being just kind of this stuff that you're upset about or whatever it was and at that moment God turned my whole life around yeah it was it was as if I'd seen Jesus Christ for the first time again I can't explain it I just know he's faithful and if you're on that spot right now you know I can't you can't explain the supernatural but all I know is this is if God's put that little thing in your heart that for some reason just can't stop that just can't keep going like no matter what happens you just Lord I just I know not only is this message real but you did not bring me to this world just to leave me you didn't reveal to me something that 99% of the world knows nothing about just to cast me aside you didn't promise me a bread promised me bread just to give me a stone you didn't promise me my family just to let it rot you didn't promise me my healing just to let me suffer you may suffer for a season but joy comes in the morning we do all these things that were going through they're just light afflictions but he's able he's faithful the scripture said about Sarah it says Sarah judged him faithful that promised have you judged him faithful he is faithful bukka revelation says he is faithful his name is faithful and true amen everything he has said he will do amen we got to get into the spirit of the vision and not and that not only that but when we see it we need to grab it and we need to walk towards it I couldn't find the quote but I know I've heard it and I'm paraphrasing but you if I'm wrong brother David will correct me because he's the pastor he'll know I believe the Spirit of Lord would reveal it to him but I've heard this before and I'm 99.9 percent but we talk about brother Branham says we would there's a there's a well person out in front of him and what do you do you just start walking one step at a time towards that vision of that well person that applies to all those all those things do you need delivered from something God's got that vision for you of a free child of God free from that bondage what do you do you just start walking towards that vision you say devil's gonna knock you down you just get back up and keep going because time we live in time time is are one of our biggest enemies and the promises of God are all there they're perfect they're true they are immutable they can't be stopped and yet time it's almost like a wave on the ocean it's just constantly beating away time just beating away trying to a road what's it trying to do is trying to erode your faith just over and over again it's just constantly beating but if we can get out of time and just get into the spirit get into the spirit of that vision so we can see what God sees about you see that delivered family member that you've been struggling so much and praying like crying tears Dayton Derrick day and night for I got him out there we I believe a lot of us most of us probably got him out there or something the death would have been trying to eat you been struggling with for years and you just can't seem to get over that hurdle you just keep walking to you God has got a vision for you of a freed individual why because God doesn't do a halfway work Jesus Christ doesn't do things halfway he did it all on Calvary and we really see it bit by bit little by little why because you're gonna take the land a little bit at a time a little bit at a time a little bit at a time and so many times we see that big thing over there and say man I gotta go get that and then the Lord says no you got to go kill this little one first I'm just this just the way it's the way it is those those natural things were given for our spiritual edification to understand that things do it's not just it's not a microwave thing it's not a snap crackle pop we're all done the Lord is working on each one of us in different ways and here's the thing but we have to trust what he's saying about us as this thought it's thought this I you can turn with me if you want but in judges chapter 6 God has a vision for you and then we'll close with this judges chapter 6 we know the story here in verse 11 it says this and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in Oprah that pertained unto joash the Ibiza right and his son gideon thresh sweet by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and sent it to him the Lord be with the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor and and said unto him o my lord hath the war be with us then why is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites have I have not i sent thee and he said it to him this is so what are we looking at here the Lord is giving a vision he's expressing God's vision to Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor that's what he's saying to the bride of Jesus Christ she's a mighty bride of Valor you're a mighty son or daughter of God but what do we do this is exactly what we come back with through many times isn't it because we're looking at ourselves he said unto Him o my Lord what was shy save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house oh my not even knowing that God would take another one that looked least in his father's house by the name of David and anoint him king over his reel amen but what did the Lord said unto Him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smite the Midianites is one man and he said unto him if now I have found grace in thy sight then show me a sign that thou talkest with me and we know the story from there we have to believe what God said about us speak and go forward why because we have a vision laid out we had a prophet come that's why we spoke that's why we read the scripture at Habakkuk he said make the vision plain and write it upon tables so him that readeth me run I believe we've had a vision made plain in our day we have a message that lays out who we are all we got to do is walk towards it this may sound really kind of silly but I believe it was the Lord that quickened it to me I was thinking about that scripture and it says it says make the vision plain and write it upon tables so that he that readeth may run I thought braided upon tables and I looked at my phone I had a little app there that said the table it's been written upon the tables it's there the visions been made plain it's right there and what is it saying it since you're a mighty man of Valor it says you you're a bride with that spot or wrinkle what but you've got to look get in the spirit of that vision and just keep walking towards it we've got to trust what God said about us and then speak the word and go forward it took Moses 80 years to get to that point and even then even after all that he still struggled so why would we be any different in the in the carnal sense but what was it he God was showing us that no matter what there's that way through if we would just trust in the word that he was spoken already it'll work the gospel the power of God demonstrated we can't be afraid any more we can't be afraid to step out on a limb I'm gonna read this last quote and this is this will be it right here he says this is from Abraham's seed 1959 notice Abraham he was just an ordinary man come down from the Tower of Babel with his father and they settled down in the woods up in the land of Shinar come down into the city of Ur in the land of the Chaldeans he was just an ordinary man no not nothing not no saint no God he's just an ordinary man nothing about him any different from anyone else no more than there is you just an ordinary person but God saw something in him and he called him how many of you been called we're here aren't we ah the world thinks you're crazy already we might as well go all in with it make make him write and believe this word so much today really do think we're crazy he said but God saw something in him and he called him God seen the same thing in every born again man and woman here now Abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work are you the same faith that he gave Abraham he gives it to you freely if you'll use it say I have a gun it'll shoot it's a good true shooting gun I hang it up on the wall I say yeah oh sure I got a gun isn't that what brother David was basically preaching this Sunday we you got the Spirit of God in you we have the Holy Ghost that's quickened you from a dead life unto life in Jesus Christ we have a word that's promised but then we just put it up on the wall so what you do it okay said say have a gun it'll shoot it's a good true shooting gun is this a good true shooting gun amen I hang it up on the wall I say yo sure I got a gun what'd you do with it it hangs on the wall that's faith people say oh I'm a Christian I believe God can but what do you do about it put it to work turn it loose do something with it I like this get out and hunt up the devil where he says you're you still hurt say you're a liar pull a bead on him get him in the scope don't be afraid to pull the trigger because it'll go off sure as anything yes sir it'll boomerang on him so hold on so that's what I'm here to tell you tonight pull up beat on the death when he's telling you all your faults you say thanks devil thank you Lord you just revealed I'm gonna pull a bead of faith right on and blast him out out of there with the word why because he's put it in you to do it you we must do it it's not by our own might why because you're me you may not always see the effects right away we're so we so we want things now now now now like children in that way but we should be more mature when it comes to being able to wait upon the Lord wait for that movement then we can step right into the vision I said that was the last thing but this is the very last thing only because this was kind of the crux of the whole idea and thank the Lord for bringing it back to my remembrance the crux of that whole idea was this I'm talking about stepping into the vision I don't even need this because we know the story brother Branham had a vision about a little boy that was supposed to be healed that he went and prayed for him and that he was healed and he got so stirred up about it he went right to the house knocked down the door and say brother you trust me bring the baby over here I'll pray for me he prayed for baby got worse and started crying and crying he said he passed out right there and he said the mom started crying oh I'm just dramatized so you understand it's not an easy situation did you imagine that the prophet saw the vision knew what God's will was to heal that child and then he goes in there pray for the baby and passes out I just try to put myself in that situation Lord I've seen a vision you're gonna heal the child in the name of the Lord Jesus the child's healed by vision Davey passes out mom baby and all I'm trying to be funny because you imagine the chaos but what was the prophets talk immediately there was something wrong because he's seen the vision he may never fail there's something wrong and he realized this one brother wasn't where he's supposed to be this one thing wasn't where it was supposed to be why he didn't wait for the vision he didn't wait for everything just to get in the spot that it was supposed to be God's got a vision for us children of God but we've got to get into our spots the great if I could call it like this the great machinery of God can't turn properly until every cog is in the right spot and then you watch as soon as that last one clicks into place those wheels of prophecy will get to moving the Holy Ghost will start to burn him that engine will start firing up and we'll be out of here before they could say anything but what was it he had to wait till hours in silence he said if you read the stories I can imagine how awkward it was they're all crying pacing back and forth my baby my baby and here's the Prophet he sat in the corner and he and he basically said he didn't say anything for almost two hours he just sat there he said I want to say anything and he and he realized what it was the vision hadn't been put into place and he said Oh Lord forgive me Lord if you just give me another chance why I believe the Lord was teaching his prophet and by proxy he's teaching us so many times we get enthused like brother David he said go do that saw light in your heart the Prophet said what he had to come back and correct it why not because it was wrong it just wasn't the season David's heart was right we know that because I said he his heart was set upon the Lord his heart was after God so he sits there he's thinking oh Lord just give me another chance maybe Lord you'll have mercy two hours he sits there and then here comes some the lady the grandmother come up and she went through the back way any Caesar he says that's the lady that's the lady that was supposed to be here he says Oh God maybe you'll just give me another chance maybe you'll have mercy he has mercy brothers and sisters no matter how much you think you messed it up he's got mercy for you if there's just that little pull in your heart that you want to get right with God he's got mercy for you no matter how much you've messed up his vision for your life you'll just wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord though the vision tarry wait for it you may not know what God's got for you in your life yet I don't believe any of us have completely made me figure it out what God's got for us on everything but there are certain things we know for sure preach the gospel to every creature go forth through all the word lay hands on the sick pray for the sick all these different things that are just laid out in the scripture for everybody but there's a vision guys got for you your life and you've got to seek that out for yourself and then when you find it get into that vision get into your place because we as a body cannot move forward until we're all in that spot why brother Branham had to wait until the one brother put his coat on to get ready to go to work he thought oh my if he leaves it's all over if he leaves it's all over he's get his coat on yeah and by then it's gonna be night time with his babies almost dead it's just in the morning and then he sees the old lady come up soon Lord maybe you'll give me another chance oh my she took her glasses off and they were fogged up and I could just you can read it you can feel the spirit of his excitement Lord you're given another chance he's giving us all another chance how many times have you done it before you'll do it again we've got to believe that I've messed up so many times Abraham messed up so many times but when the commentary was written he staggered not hey man thank the Lord for that His grace covers it yes Lord and he waits there then he's sitting on the thing and he was old yeah that's right in the fishing the brother had to be sitting right here so he gets up but he just kind of steps off to the side and I the way I was reading it there earlier I was reading and it just it sounds so awkward in the natural because the one brother says brother would you brother Brennan would you like to pray for the child again he just says thanks I can imagine what that kind of sound thanks oh okay you want to pray for him or not I'm think I'm putting myself in the vision trying to imagine what they would have felt they've been up all night it's the breaking a day he he says thanks and then he gets up in the brother sits down he says brother do you have confidence in me still he said sure I do brother branner he says he says bring the baby here he says Lord forgive your servant I'm a stupidity Oh brother branham was stupid what am i you know you know but God had mercy and he prayed and the baby was well he said look brother branham I'm perfectly whole that's that's what he's got for us we may mess things up we mess things up all the time but God's got mercy for you he's got grace to fill in the gap amen let's all stand the Lord has been so good to us you know I look at my own life and I'm ashamed of myself at how many times I doubt when I've seen I look back in my life and I actually think about it about what he's brought me through you know I believe each one of us could have that that that feeling the devil would try to put on you of all those things but he is faithful he's got a vision for this bride I know a part of it is onward Christian soldiers marching as to war just going up and up and up and up amen that's part of the vision I'm gonna walk in that vision I'm gonna do my best to get into the spirit of this word stay in that atmosphere get into that atmosphere every day and then you just watch the Lord work in your life watch the Lord work in your brothers and sisters lives amen amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just love you and we're so grateful for your mercy and your grace O God Lord you're faithful Lord your mercies are renewed every morning Oh God Lord you said though a righteous man would stumble he gets back up Lord and is only by your grace that we can get back up but Lord when we get back up we know it's just that that life that you put in us that can't help but get up Lord Jesus because Lord you got up from a grave one day Lord so we have to get up from our own failures and shortcomings and we have to keep walking towards that vision you set before us Lord may you forgive us Lord of all of our mistakes Oh God Lord and may you just put in our hearts that vision Lord of a bride that's without spot or wrinkle Lord may we take that spirit of that vision Lord that you see not just apply it to ourselves but apply it to our brothers and sisters Lord put it on to our family Lord because we know that you're coming we see all the signs coming Lord Jesus were with our prophet could say he was and we were in the last days so many times ago and we see these things being fulfilled now Lord it's just even at the door lord I believe we are such a desperation lure helped us to have that desperation Lord Jesus Lord you're worthy of all praise Lord for you did it all we give glory to your name Lord Jesus Lord bind up the brokenhearted or heal the afflicted Lord Jesus Lord you did it all from before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain Lord and you've seen us all here Lord you predestinated your seed to this our Lord because you knew that the Spirit that's in your people would rise to the occasion Oh God because it's you and not us may we just find the grace of God to get ourselves out of the way in our everyday life Oh God to submit ourselves to your spirit Lord not to reason ourselves out of that you're working Lord but just just step into it more we accept it Lord we receive it now we believe it oh God and we'll walk forward Lord and we'll speak that word before us knowing that you can't fail we just thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] well maybe I just I had this song I know you're playing kind of a slower one but we'll sing this one just cuz I it just kind of was in my heart I didn't sing at the beginning but you know that song I'm running for my life I think I could do it in that key I'm running for my life I'm running for my life if anybody asked you what's the matter with me just tell them ups a sanctified Holy Ghost filled in a baptize I've got Jesus on the inside and I'm running for my life [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] years [Music] [Music] [Applause] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
