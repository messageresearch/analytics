Description:
Children's Christmas Program
Saturday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
December 9, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm here okay like I was saying we really appreciate brother Tim our Sunday school superintendent all the Sunday School teachers and everybody that worked so hard and especially the children it wouldn't be without them uh it's important you know I'd like just to read this a scripture uh before we start and it it's it's uh familiar we all know the story and it says and lo the angels of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tithings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ Our Lord and this shall be assign unto you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger and suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of Heaven of hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will towards men and you know this is the uh a great time of the year when uh we celebrate the birth and the coming of our savior and that's ex uh just something that's so lost today to the world and I thought thought just as this scripture said Peace and on Earth and Good Will towards men and I think this is just such a great time for our children to learn to love one another and to respect one another and to have good will towards all men whether they see things the way we do whether they believe the season the way we do we can show the love of the Lord and we can have good will towards all men and the gift was to all men whether it's accepted or not but we offer it freely the love of the Lord towards everybody so that this is what we desire our children to know that the Lord Jesus is the answer to all our situations and all our trials and that through him we can have love in our heart and peace and Good Will to all men God bless you we hope you enjoy the service this evening the little program our children have worked so hard and also I know there's a few Refreshments after so God bless you r [Music] friends it's time that men and women woke up to the fact that we want to be one Jesus prayed that we might be one just as God and him were one and God was in and we are one with Christ if we let Christ come in but the only way we can do is to let him take the control room in our heart then we become one amen we're facing Christmas we're facing times we're facing a horrible things all this that we're facing what difference does it make what comes or goes as long as Christ is in the control room controlling us controlling us and giving us Faith to believe things that we cannot see God said we faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen you believe it for God is in your heart and telling you that his word's right and no spirit will of God will ever deny anything of God's word the spirit of God will recognize his own oh how happy I am to know that there is a God us
