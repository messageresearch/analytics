[24:45] we trust at your goodness
[24:48] and your Grace will be our portion
[24:51] be with us I pray in Jesus name
[24:55] amen
[24:58] I bless you
[24:59] amen Let's uh
[25:02] we'll just uh
[25:04] read maybe one scripture uh that we read
[25:09] this morning
[25:11] found in uh
[25:15] let me see if I can find it here
[25:23] found in the Matthew the sixth uh
[25:28] chapter and the 33rd verse
[25:33] Matthew 6 33.
[25:36] it says seek ye first
[25:40] in Matthews
[25:43] 6 33.
[25:45] it says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[25:49] God and his righteousness and all these
[25:53] things shall be added unto you
[25:57] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[26:01] for the moral shall take thought of the
[26:05] things of itself
[26:07] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[26:10] thereof Heavenly Father we ask you to
[26:13] bless your word in Jesus precious name
[26:15] we pray amen men you may be seated
[26:18] tonight
[26:25] so just a a few of us uh here tonight
[26:29] and uh so there was a lot of out there
[26:33] that decided not to invest in the
[26:36] kingdom and others they're not feeling
[26:39] well they're sick and so brother Paul
[26:42] wrote me and today and thanking him for
[26:46] the message but said his family's sick
[26:48] all at home and they have the flu and we
[26:51] know the flu is goes around and the
[26:55] weather changes and different things
[26:57] take place but
[26:59] so we talked about investing
[27:03] uh this morning the need to invest in we
[27:08] tried to bring it out in a way that we
[27:10] might catch it uh like we talked about a
[27:14] tank of gas
[27:16] and uh you you notice something uh
[27:19] amazing about a vehicle it'll run full
[27:24] speed full strength full power
[27:28] till it uses that last drop
[27:31] and then it's just
[27:33] cuts off and we're that way you know
[27:36] what I mean with everything will be
[27:38] thinking good but if we're not careful
[27:40] our tank runs out so we have to
[27:43] continually
[27:44] be investing in the kingdom of God fill
[27:49] in our tanks you know what I mean doing
[27:51] those things but we want to talk a
[27:54] little bit more tonight
[27:57] about what the kingdom of God is and the
[28:03] benefits of the Kingdom or we might call
[28:07] it the benefits of investing so there's
[28:11] things that come along so this is what
[28:13] the prophet of God said Jesus said his
[28:17] kingdom was not of this world
[28:21] so he's not talking about
[28:24] investing in the world he was offered
[28:27] the kingdom of the world
[28:30] so he was offered all the kingdoms
[28:35] if he would fall down in worship so we
[28:38] understood that those kingdoms
[28:41] were all the things that controlled the
[28:44] people of the Earth
[28:45] do you know there's a political Kingdom
[28:48] people that are just involved in
[28:51] politics and
[28:55] others you know a lot of us that grew up
[28:58] maybe in sports or or you know as young
[29:03] people playing sports and things like
[29:06] that we understand that Sports is a
[29:08] world you know people are influenced and
[29:11] controlled by Sports they did a study in
[29:15] Dallas Fort Worth a few years ago on
[29:18] productivity
[29:21] now I don't know how they do a a
[29:24] report on productivity but I think that
[29:28] they they studied uh
[29:31] lots of factories and what that they
[29:34] produced and they studied sales of how
[29:39] much was sale sold that's how they can
[29:42] determine productivity how many Builders
[29:45] are buying Lumber who's buying this
[29:48] who's buying that what supplies are
[29:51] buying restaurant supplies and
[29:54] everything so they they studied this
[29:56] great study on productivity and what
[30:01] they found out is that productivity
[30:05] in Dallas Fort Worth went down 18
[30:09] percent every time the Cowboys lost
[30:17] really
[30:20] I mean
[30:22] why if the world the world doesn't even
[30:24] realize they've lost
[30:27] you know what I mean in their
[30:29] productivity is going to go down to zero
[30:33] but it it uh the worlds are the things
[30:38] that control people I believe that our
[30:43] messenger said that there's more spent
[30:46] on makeup
[30:48] I I think he referred to it as Max
[30:50] Factor or or makeup then is spent spent
[30:55] on medicine
[30:59] now that's a lot of face paint
[31:02] you know what I mean can you imagine
[31:04] that many people
[31:06] that are unhappy with the way that they
[31:09] look
[31:10] that they're trying to paint a different
[31:13] face on themselves
[31:15] that's miserable
[31:17] you know what I mean that that's misery
[31:20] but I remember that we let a sister to
[31:24] the Lord one time and
[31:26] and uh she she gave me her her
[31:31] testimony and everything she said
[31:35] I I makeup was such a part of my life
[31:39] that I didn't feel I was completely
[31:42] dressed until I had my makeup on
[31:46] you know what I mean it it that it had
[31:50] so much
[31:52] uh control
[31:54] that she had to go in and adjust
[31:59] her appearance she couldn't go out and
[32:02] face anybody till she put on a face that
[32:07] that she felt was what she wanted to
[32:13] look like now
[32:15] I I mean men didn't used to wear makeup
[32:19] but it's got so bad now
[32:22] that you go to places and I I sat in a
[32:26] restaurant and a guy come up to me and
[32:29] he had makeup on
[32:32] and you know I asked him I said what's
[32:35] the deal
[32:39] you know I mean what would you do if
[32:42] someone's going to serve your feet and
[32:43] get some stuff on you know what I mean
[32:45] and his lips are a little red
[32:49] I mean
[32:50] uh you yeah
[32:53] I I don't get it I'm sorry you have to
[32:56] bear with me I mean that's just about as
[32:59] whacked out as can be
[33:01] and he had nail polish on
[33:06] you know and and uh
[33:10] and it's because and so my boys
[33:13] explained it to me
[33:15] uh they said they they call that a metro
[33:19] man
[33:23] a metro
[33:25] I'm never gonna say I live in the
[33:28] Metroplex again
[33:31] I mean you understand what I'm saying so
[33:34] these are obvious
[33:37] things of the world
[33:39] you know what I mean worldly things that
[33:42] are standing out but what the world is
[33:45] it's Spirits right because we don't
[33:48] fight against we fight against powers
[33:50] and principalities in high places
[33:53] spiritual wickedness right in high
[33:56] places these are the kingdoms these were
[33:59] the things that Satan was going to have
[34:02] control over the population over the
[34:07] people that's how he ruled over the
[34:09] people with spirits and and through
[34:12] these Spirits he would actually get them
[34:16] to do what what
[34:18] he wanted him to do and by them doing
[34:23] what they were doing the powers that he
[34:26] had control over them to do what they
[34:29] were doing they were worshiping him and
[34:32] not knowing it
[34:36] so Satan offered all this influence and
[34:40] all this
[34:41] power
[34:43] to Jesus if he would worship him he
[34:46] offered him the kingdoms
[34:48] so there was more than one kingdoms and
[34:51] we know what a kingdom is it's a power
[34:56] so the kingdom of God is a
[35:00] power and so we were reading this he
[35:03] said and he said Jesus said his kingdom
[35:06] was not of this world
[35:07] it was his kingdom if it was his kingdom
[35:13] his delegates would fight
[35:16] so that's when he told pilate he says if
[35:18] you know if my kingdom was of the world
[35:21] my armies would be here to defend me but
[35:25] my kingdoms not of this world well how
[35:29] many archangels do you think had their
[35:31] Sworn Sword strong you don't think God's
[35:34] got an army
[35:35] remember he told the gehaza he said look
[35:38] around son there's more with us than
[35:41] there are with them and he said them
[35:43] skies and the hills were filled with
[35:46] chariots you know what I mean uh you
[35:49] know just think of that God's got a
[35:51] whirlwind he's got a pillar of fire
[35:53] right he came down and destroyed the
[35:55] whole Army of Egypt so God had armies
[35:59] Jesus had armies
[36:00] he could have beckoned all of Heaven if
[36:04] he wanted to but he had to make a way
[36:08] for you to come into the kingdom
[36:12] you understand
[36:13] he had to make an entrance for us to
[36:17] come into the kingdom through his blood
[36:19] through his sacrifice he made
[36:22] us away that we could come in and take
[36:27] be partakers of the Kingdom so what does
[36:31] he say so he said they would by kingdom
[36:34] was up by King of this world they come
[36:37] fight he said but my kingdom is of above
[36:40] see the kingdom of God is not an
[36:44] organization
[36:46] so not just the religious organization
[36:50] like the United States is is God's
[36:54] kingdom isn't the order and the power of
[36:58] the United States that's what the United
[37:00] States claims its claims that we're the
[37:03] greatest nation on Earth well let me
[37:06] tell you that's a lie the bride is the
[37:09] greatest most powerful Nation on the
[37:13] Earth
[37:15] remember we are not a religion we are a
[37:19] people
[37:22] that's who we are we're a people
[37:25] we're ordained
[37:28] elected chosen people so if you're part
[37:32] of this you're part of it you're part of
[37:35] a people you're fitted and joined
[37:37] together matched up by God to to produce
[37:42] a a a a body and it's not it it's not a
[37:47] system it it's not run by man it has a
[37:52] head and it has a king and our King is
[37:56] the Lord Jesus Christ so the kingdom of
[37:59] God is not it it doesn't have the laws
[38:04] of man the rules of man the the social
[38:07] structure of man it has a Heavenly
[38:10] structure our Heavenly structure is just
[38:14] the opposite of the worldly structure
[38:17] right the worldly structure is the more
[38:19] popular you can be uh the the more
[38:22] powerful you can be and the greater you
[38:25] are the more power you have are our our
[38:28] systems completely upside down the more
[38:31] humble you can be the more trite
[38:34] contrite you can be the more giving you
[38:36] can be the more lovable you can be the
[38:39] more power you have just the opposite
[38:42] there are actually two parallel
[38:45] universes running of the the True Vine
[38:48] and the false Vine remember one sold
[38:51] good seed and the enemy came in and
[38:54] sowed another seed and they grew up
[38:56] together so both these kingdoms are
[38:59] growed up together and we know by many
[39:02] sermons that was preached that this
[39:05] worldly Kingdom will try to come in and
[39:08] wrap its Vines around the the true fruit
[39:12] and deform it
[39:15] and I I I was just trying to think of
[39:18] the name of that sermon that uh brother
[39:22] Branham preached that he went through
[39:24] that in such a detail of the the
[39:27] deforming power of the Kingdom well it
[39:31] it'll deform a
[39:35] Son of God and a daughter of God but to
[39:39] those that are of the world it literally
[39:42] captivates him
[39:45] they're they're actually controlled
[39:48] by that spirit
[39:50] and and it does but so we know what the
[39:53] kingdom of God is he's the kingdom of
[39:54] God is not a system or an organization
[39:58] or a government
[40:01] he says that can make a great thing
[40:06] I added some description there it's the
[40:09] power of God
[40:13] that's what the kingdom is it's the
[40:16] power of God
[40:18] the holy spirit
[40:20] in the human life
[40:23] so that's what the kingdom is it's not
[40:26] it's not something that we're going to
[40:29] it's something that we possess now we
[40:33] have the kingdom
[40:35] so because you possess the kingdom now
[40:39] you have that that Kingdom Life takes on
[40:44] form in a place called heaven
[40:48] so we don't want to mix up where we're
[40:51] going with what gets us there the
[40:54] kingdom of God is what gets you there
[40:56] you've already entered in to the kingdom
[41:00] of God you already possess the power the
[41:04] same power that you possess of this
[41:07] Kingdom it is the life the Holy Spirit
[41:11] the kingdom is the holy is the power of
[41:15] God the holy spirit in an individual
[41:18] amen do you believe that
[41:21] so I thought tonight that we talked
[41:25] about investing and uh
[41:30] they need to invest
[41:32] I really encourage you to go back and
[41:34] listen to those sermons
[41:36] uh because
[41:38] he goes in there and explains why the
[41:41] Rich Young Ruler
[41:43] wouldn't invest
[41:45] now look at what Jesus offered him he
[41:49] offered him to become one
[41:51] of the Apostles
[41:56] just think of it
[41:58] yeah come on
[42:00] just like he called Matthew just like he
[42:03] called the other ones who knows I know
[42:07] God knows but I wonder what his name was
[42:11] and I wonder what his testimony would
[42:14] have been
[42:16] but he was presented the opportunity to
[42:19] become one of
[42:21] the disciples
[42:24] right I would say one of the Apostles
[42:29] that would have been something wouldn't
[42:31] it up
[42:33] just think of that if they could treat
[42:36] us Widow went they would have still had
[42:37] the 12 right
[42:39] I just can't imagine how it would be
[42:41] written differently
[42:44] but but he that's what it was it was
[42:47] offered he was offered the opportunity
[42:49] he says come over and join this Kingdom
[42:52] or what was he saying to him Jesus is
[42:55] looking at him he says you've done all
[42:57] these things now how would you like to
[42:59] have the power
[43:02] of the Resurrection how would you like
[43:05] to have something with you a power with
[43:09] you that was not just a power to make
[43:13] money but it was a power to have power
[43:17] over the enemy
[43:19] so that was offered to him but
[43:23] it had a price
[43:25] right to sell all that she had
[43:28] oh my goodness now he got thinking about
[43:31] his reputation he got thinking about
[43:34] what are they going to think well
[43:36] they're going to think this guy's The
[43:38] Fanatic he's crazy right he didn't want
[43:42] to build the reproach what he wanted he
[43:45] wanted the kingdom he wanted the power
[43:48] he wanted the life but he wanted to keep
[43:52] his social structure
[43:54] he wanted to have the world right and
[43:59] the kingdom he wanted what Jesus had but
[44:04] he also wanted to have what he had he
[44:07] wanted to bring them together and now
[44:10] you know Jesus looks out right after
[44:12] that and he says you can't serve two
[44:15] masters
[44:16] you can't serve two kingdoms you're
[44:20] going to have to take one
[44:23] right and despise the other
[44:26] you can't get caught in the middle so
[44:29] you've got to choose a kingdom
[44:32] you've got to choose a power
[44:35] the trouble with the power of the world
[44:38] no matter how great it is and how smart
[44:42] you get and how much stock you buy and
[44:45] how many houses you have
[44:48] it ain't lasting
[44:52] and there's certain things
[44:55] it can't do
[44:57] I don't know if any mostly some of you
[45:00] are old enough
[45:01] very few probably to remember the Shah
[45:05] of Iran
[45:08] will this leader of Iran
[45:11] he was he had a sickness he was ill
[45:14] every place he went he flew
[45:19] one of those great big planes that was a
[45:22] complete Hospital
[45:28] now how would you like to live like that
[45:31] every place you went you had to bring a
[45:34] hospital
[45:36] doctors surgeons every medicine you
[45:40] could think of every machine that you
[45:43] could think of this whole guy's life he
[45:46] he wanted to to stay alive he and he had
[45:53] he had all the money that you could
[45:55] think of just he could go he had
[45:58] everything the world was offered but yet
[46:03] that world couldn't do certain things
[46:08] so the power of the world has
[46:11] limitations
[46:15] I've read many a story
[46:18] you know you sit down when you don't
[46:20] have no money like me you know and you
[46:22] think well if I had a million dollars
[46:26] I'll tell you what I'd do
[46:29] amen
[46:31] I know what I'd do if I had a million
[46:33] dollars I'd give it all away let's
[46:36] just my problem
[46:38] but we all sit back and said if I had a
[46:41] million dollars or if I just had this or
[46:45] I just had that everything would be over
[46:47] it would all be good then
[46:50] go if I could just have a million
[46:52] dollars in the bank I'd never worry
[46:55] again yeah you would
[47:00] I I know people I I've met him at the
[47:03] bank over and over again they're in
[47:06] there asking the banker what's the
[47:09] balance of their account
[47:11] I've heard it so many times I can tell
[47:14] them when they come in the door
[47:16] Mars don't worry you got a hundred and
[47:19] one thousand dollars in the bank you're
[47:22] okay
[47:23] and there how much money do I have
[47:31] because look
[47:32] so what I'm trying to point out is
[47:34] there's certain
[47:36] things
[47:37] the world leaves Kingdom no matter
[47:42] how great it is or how much you've
[47:46] achieved in it or how much you have of
[47:49] it it's certain things it just can't do
[47:56] it so
[47:58] and and that's what the enemy is always
[48:00] trying to do sell you his kingdom
[48:04] oh if you get a good education I think
[48:08] that's a big problem
[48:11] in the message
[48:12] and with the young people that they've
[48:15] all been sold
[48:17] that they got to go to college they've
[48:19] got to get a degree they've got to get
[48:21] educated
[48:23] well if you put one ounce of trust
[48:27] in your college education
[48:30] you're going to fail
[48:36] I'm going to tell
[48:39] a little story
[48:41] on
[48:44] my son David
[48:47] he didn't go to college
[48:50] but one day he thought he would he
[48:54] didn't know really not a whole lot about
[48:57] computers that we knew
[49:00] they weren't offering computer class
[49:02] when he went to school the amount of
[49:05] days he was there we never were sure if
[49:08] he spent more days in school or more
[49:10] days out of school but whatever
[49:14] you know and I won't go into some of the
[49:17] clothing he wore to school but to any
[49:21] way you know we had a teenager and like
[49:23] any parents you know you're going to go
[49:25] through those years and you got a
[49:27] promise and you hang on to that promise
[49:30] you know what I mean and and you don't
[49:32] you're not shaken but anyway so
[49:36] he decided to go to a job fair
[49:41] so he got into the job fair and he
[49:44] talked and the guys are all there and so
[49:46] here's he's got all these guys around
[49:48] you know they've got uh degrees in in
[49:53] computer science and degrees and
[49:56] electrical you know Computer Engineering
[49:59] they've got Microsoft you know
[50:03] and four or five or how many Microsoft
[50:07] deals are there and uh they they've got
[50:10] you know and they're they're they've got
[50:12] uh uh they they write in Cobalt and they
[50:17] and they write and I I can't even write
[50:20] in English but these guys are writing in
[50:21] Cobalt and how many other languages are
[50:24] there a bunch okay so these guys are
[50:27] writing everything and Davey shows up
[50:29] you know Davey happy go lucky
[50:32] just walks in there hey
[50:35] and these guys are all in suit and ties
[50:37] you know what I mean and and Davey walks
[50:39] in well Davey don't mess around with all
[50:42] the guys in the interviewers he gets
[50:44] hooked up with the main guy
[50:46] that guy that owns the company
[50:49] and so he's just talking to him and and
[50:52] the guy says well what are you doing
[50:53] here he says Ah I just
[50:56] out looking around I just thought I'd
[50:58] see what's going on here
[51:01] and the guy likes David you know
[51:04] everybody likes David
[51:06] I mean that's he's got my name but I
[51:10] never could make a good first impression
[51:12] everybody when they met me they hated me
[51:15] and then I'd have to win them over
[51:17] you know he's just got that you like him
[51:20] so the guy says well you know what he
[51:23] says you go to training if you can pass
[51:26] the training you got a job
[51:31] he didn't have to interview
[51:33] he didn't have to do nothing he didn't
[51:36] have to have an education he didn't have
[51:38] those things because God Made A Way
[51:44] but I'm not against education anybody
[51:47] that knows me I've encouraged people to
[51:49] get their doctorates I've encouraged
[51:51] people to get their master's degree I
[51:54] think that if you are going to do that
[51:56] you ought to do it a hundred percent
[51:57] that you ought to get straight A's
[52:01] that's what I think
[52:03] but don't trust it
[52:06] it ain't it's not going to do you one
[52:08] good thing if God's not in it
[52:11] so anyway he just got a job
[52:15] and he was selling computer parts and so
[52:19] he told computer parts he knew how the
[52:21] computer worked and that guy closed that
[52:24] company or something happened he went
[52:25] someplace else and the guy brought him
[52:28] on and brought him on and he got brought
[52:30] on and now he's in a very good position
[52:32] and in helping people do computer stuff
[52:39] it wasn't by education
[52:42] it's not by power or by might it's by my
[52:46] spirit saith the Lord
[52:49] so what we're saying is that there's
[52:52] certain things the kingdom of the world
[52:54] can't do
[52:56] right and and and and
[52:58] you know especially your sisters you
[53:01] know what I mean and and I know there's
[53:03] so much fear and this is not just for
[53:05] you anybody else that listens to it not
[53:08] particular for you that are here you
[53:11] know this whole idea that well I better
[53:13] go get an education in case I don't get
[53:16] married
[53:19] well you don't make Provisions for the
[53:22] negative
[53:24] how many knows where that Spirit come
[53:27] from
[53:28] that's an ananias and virus spirit
[53:33] if God can't do it
[53:36] I'm going to have a plan
[53:40] oh I know that what I'm saying now is
[53:42] probably shaking the core value of
[53:44] a lot a lot of people
[53:48] I might as well get really
[53:53] put myself in jeopardy
[53:57] sorry
[53:58] if I said a woman belongs at home
[54:03] raising her children
[54:09] right ministering to her husband
[54:12] that's the way that it used to be
[54:16] right but just think this Kingdom of the
[54:18] world
[54:19] now has the homes broken up it has the
[54:22] families broken up it have everything
[54:26] but broken up now I'm not you I'm not
[54:29] preaching uh just like Jesus said he
[54:33] said that he he said that well
[54:36] he said it wasn't so from the beginning
[54:40] but because the hardness of your heart
[54:42] God made a provision
[54:44] the whole world has got so bad now that
[54:48] if you don't sell out to it a hundred
[54:49] percent it wants to make it where you
[54:52] won't survive
[54:54] but God will allow a Believer to survive
[54:59] in fact he promised to take care of him
[55:01] so let's talk just for a few minutes
[55:05] about the benefits of entering the
[55:09] kingdom of God or having the power
[55:14] of God in you as a believer
[55:18] because remember when they went to the
[55:21] upper room
[55:22] they didn't go up there to get a
[55:24] sensation
[55:27] they didn't go up there to get a
[55:32] uh
[55:33] and a blessing or an anointing so to
[55:38] speak
[55:40] but they went up there
[55:42] let me see if I can find this statement
[55:44] here I thought it was pretty powerful uh
[55:49] but they went up there for this he says
[55:52] he says here now all your Sensations
[55:56] as we Pentecostal people like to jump
[56:00] and Shout I do I believe that's right we
[56:05] like to speak with tongues I believe
[56:07] that's a gift of God the devil can
[56:10] impersonate anything that you can
[56:13] produce in that line but notice then it
[56:17] shows that something is wrong
[56:19] The Life of Christ isn't flowing through
[56:22] the church the way it should
[56:25] the body the bride it's not going
[56:29] through there like it should now we
[56:32] fought we now we finally clogged up
[56:36] somewhere
[56:38] so something's clogged us up
[56:41] so when they went to the upper room they
[56:44] didn't go for sensation
[56:47] and and if you're not careful
[56:50] the Pentecostal experience will be
[56:53] presented to you that it has some sort
[56:56] of sensation
[56:57] uh attached to it but that's not what
[57:03] they went up there for they went up
[57:06] there
[57:07] to be endued with power from on high
[57:12] and be connected
[57:15] with a source of Fellowship
[57:20] I will not leave you comfortless but I
[57:23] will come again I'll be with you even in
[57:26] you till the end so they went up there
[57:28] to make that personal Conde connection
[57:32] and to be endued with power or they went
[57:36] up there to receive the kingdom of God
[57:43] man now what they had in that by
[57:46] receiving that Kingdom they had
[57:49] something that the world couldn't
[57:52] produce
[57:56] if I could say this they had a whole
[57:58] fountain
[58:01] a whole storehouse
[58:04] of tools and and and
[58:08] items that that the world didn't have
[58:15] you can almost get anything in the world
[58:21] but this was greater
[58:23] let's just talk just for an instance for
[58:25] example like
[58:28] like
[58:29] Joy
[58:33] Davey put up first Peter one and eight
[58:47] I mean
[58:49] okay look here he says
[58:52] he says whom having not seen
[58:56] yet love
[58:58] in whom
[59:00] though now ye see him not yet believe ye
[59:06] Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[59:10] Glory
[59:12] now in this Kingdom
[59:15] you don't have to see
[59:19] it's not by sight it's by what faith we
[59:23] don't walk by sight we walk by faith and
[59:27] by walking in this faith we have joy
[59:31] we're we're not we're not connected with
[59:35] what we see
[59:37] in fact we can look at what we see
[59:41] and call it as if it's not
[59:45] and we can look to what we don't see and
[59:49] call it as if it is
[59:52] and we're happy doing it
[59:56] we got a joy
[1:00:00] so by it being from The Unseen it means
[1:00:03] it's not attached to anything carnal
[1:00:09] remember that guy walked away with great
[1:00:11] sorrow
[1:00:13] because he had a lot of riches he
[1:00:16] couldn't see the kingdom Joy
[1:00:20] which would have made him more happy
[1:00:22] than all the camels in Egypt
[1:00:28] Drive
[1:00:30] he left the supernatural Joy
[1:00:33] for Colonel Joy
[1:00:36] a joy which will end
[1:00:42] there's a saying
[1:00:44] in in amongst business people you spend
[1:00:48] half your life making it
[1:00:50] you spend the other half of your life
[1:00:52] trying to hold on to it
[1:00:57] every tax scheme everything you can do
[1:01:00] any way that you can give that you don't
[1:01:03] have to give it back to the government
[1:01:05] you have a government that's just trying
[1:01:08] to get a piece of your pie
[1:01:11] and you're fighting all you can to do it
[1:01:15] the saying is it's not how much you make
[1:01:18] it's how much you can keep
[1:01:24] think of it
[1:01:28] I got a raise one time
[1:01:31] and I went to my boss I said hey I don't
[1:01:34] want that raise
[1:01:36] you don't want to raise no why not it
[1:01:39] puts me in a higher tax bracket
[1:01:43] I take home less making seven dollars an
[1:01:46] hour than I did when I made six dollars
[1:01:49] an hour
[1:01:52] just think of it
[1:01:54] there's no joy in that
[1:01:56] but there's one thing that this
[1:01:59] Kingdom power
[1:02:01] you have the power now within you to
[1:02:05] have joy
[1:02:07] and no matter what you see because your
[1:02:11] joy isn't in what you see your joy isn't
[1:02:15] in the world your joy is in him you're
[1:02:19] in another kingdom you have another
[1:02:21] source of what power this power gives
[1:02:25] you Joy
[1:02:27] that's right yes sir you got joy
[1:02:31] why are you so happy I don't know it's
[1:02:34] like a Wellspring bubbling up inside of
[1:02:37] it
[1:02:39] it just comes with it
[1:02:42] it's one of the benefits you invested
[1:02:46] you get joy
[1:02:48] you're glad you invested
[1:02:53] you talk about people that invest I talk
[1:02:56] to them all the time
[1:02:58] man I invested I could put all my oh the
[1:03:01] Dow's down three points
[1:03:05] so
[1:03:07] well I got money in there
[1:03:12] people have 401ks
[1:03:15] right
[1:03:16] well they're all depressed
[1:03:19] because they're 401ks have shrunk
[1:03:23] 12 percent
[1:03:24] because of the economy and the bad
[1:03:27] whatever's going on out there
[1:03:29] I don't care
[1:03:32] I'm happy
[1:03:34] I'm content
[1:03:36] and whatever state I'm in Arizona Texas
[1:03:39] Oklahoma it don't matter
[1:03:44] whatever condition I'm in I got joy
[1:03:48] why because if you're in this Kingdom
[1:03:51] you've got joy you've got joy
[1:03:53] unspeakable and full of Glory it's one
[1:03:57] of the benefits
[1:04:00] that guy he could have had Joy
[1:04:03] he could have went down the road to
[1:04:05] whistling and praising God and praising
[1:04:08] Jehovah you know going down the road I
[1:04:11] dance like David danced I praise like
[1:04:15] David prays
[1:04:16] because he had something that the
[1:04:19] kingdom offered you cannot get that joy
[1:04:22] in the world
[1:04:25] not only that you have everybody in the
[1:04:28] world after what you got
[1:04:34] you don't think so what was that
[1:04:36] scripture about the Devourer you told me
[1:04:39] you know anyway it says we don't Devour
[1:04:43] the Devourer
[1:04:47] it'll hold back the Devourer
[1:04:51] man that makes me happy
[1:04:54] Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:04:58] he may devour when you're out in that
[1:05:00] worldly Kingdom everybody's trying to
[1:05:02] eat you up
[1:05:05] when you're in here
[1:05:09] joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:05:13] Hallelujah amen that's just one of them

[1:10:00] I'm sure if he had text
[1:10:03] that if he was in a place you could have
[1:10:05] text him a prayer request he would have
[1:10:07] probably called you and answered you and
[1:10:08] talked to you
[1:10:09] because he knew he couldn't text
[1:10:11] anointing
[1:10:13] but he could speak it
[1:10:17] you know a lot of times if you're going
[1:10:19] to pray for somebody or say something
[1:10:21] don't text them talk to them there's
[1:10:24] anointing in your voice Faith cometh by
[1:10:26] what hearing and hearing by text
[1:10:32] what's wrong with this church
[1:10:35] tweet me out some healing
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:42] did you see me on Facebook
[1:10:45] no get rid of that junk
[1:10:48] IE you don't need it
[1:10:50] no you if you're in this other Kingdom
[1:10:52] you need it I recommend
[1:10:55] if you live in this other Kingdom
[1:10:58] and that's where you want to live and
[1:11:01] prosper
[1:11:02] then I advise you to keep connected with
[1:11:04] all the other demons
[1:11:08] oh my
[1:11:10] god well you don't need it in this
[1:11:12] Kingdom
[1:11:15] guess what I have
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:18] I've got holy unction
[1:11:22] if we would invest in this Kingdom
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] if
[1:11:27] if somebody got sick
[1:11:30] right we have the Holy Spirit
[1:11:34] amen that sends sends a holy unction
[1:11:38] right that makes intercession
[1:11:42] and we'll put my burden on your heart
[1:11:48] the trouble is we haven't invested
[1:11:50] enough in the kingdom of God to get into
[1:11:52] that place of Fellowship we don't spend
[1:11:55] enough time in his presence to get a
[1:11:57] message
[1:12:00] you spend enough time on your phones to
[1:12:03] Facebook to text to tweet
[1:12:06] right to waste time
[1:12:11] but we don't spend enough time in the
[1:12:13] presence of God
[1:12:15] to get under the anointing
[1:12:17] to have holy unction speak to us
[1:12:25] because that's not in this Kingdom you
[1:12:29] spend time in this worldly Kingdom
[1:12:32] you know the sisters I put all the
[1:12:34] brothers in the and I put all you
[1:12:37] sisters and
[1:12:41] just think about it
[1:12:44] not even in tune
[1:12:48] with the kingdom and how it works
[1:12:54] you know the early church
[1:12:55] they used to get burdens one for another
[1:13:01] somebody would come on their heart
[1:13:06] and they would Journey
[1:13:08] for a day or two
[1:13:11] to show up you were on my heart
[1:13:14] is there anything I can do for you
[1:13:16] what's going on
[1:13:18] and they would have Fellowship
[1:13:21] and they would have communion
[1:13:23] in the Kingdom knowing it was God that
[1:13:28] moved on them
[1:13:30] in this kingdom of God God moves on you
[1:13:38] amen you have peace
[1:13:41] knowing
[1:13:43] that you're in the palm of his hand and
[1:13:46] nothing can pluck you out you have peace
[1:13:49] knowing that if he started a work in you
[1:13:51] he'd finish it you're not even shaken by
[1:13:55] your failures
[1:13:58] you want to get rid of them right so
[1:14:01] what do you do you make supplication
[1:14:04] in Philippians it gives us a piece
[1:14:10] it also gives us courage
[1:14:14] I don't want to go through life
[1:14:16] whistling in a graveyard
[1:14:20] I like what brother REM said when he
[1:14:22] started Crossing that field and that
[1:14:25] killer Bowl
[1:14:27] come up to him and look stared him down
[1:14:29] started snorting home
[1:14:31] of
[1:14:34] I wish brother Jeff was here I'd have
[1:14:36] him give you the
[1:14:38] he could he can do that bowl real good
[1:14:41] you know what I mean
[1:14:42] and snort what did he say he said I did
[1:14:47] not want to die a coward
[1:14:52] he stood there
[1:14:54] he stood there with courage
[1:14:57] and he said Mr Bull
[1:15:00] you have it right
[1:15:02] I had crossed your field
[1:15:04] you forgive me I was taking a shortcut
[1:15:07] because I had to make a sick call
[1:15:13] he wouldn't have he had courage
[1:15:16] let's just put up a couple of scriptures
[1:15:18] First Chronicles 28 and 20.
[1:15:29] and David said to Solomon his son
[1:15:33] be strong
[1:15:35] and of good courage
[1:15:39] and do it fear not
[1:15:43] nor be dismayed for the Lord God even my
[1:15:48] God
[1:15:49] will be with thee
[1:15:54] how many knows where that came from
[1:15:58] let your minds work just a moment we'll
[1:16:01] be with thee he will not fail thee nor
[1:16:04] forsake thee and tell thou Hast finished
[1:16:08] all the work for the service of the
[1:16:12] house of the Lord
[1:16:17] Joshua 1 11 1 9.
[1:16:24] have I not commanded thee be strong and
[1:16:28] of good courage and Be not Afraid
[1:16:31] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:16:34] thy God is with thee whersoever thou
[1:16:39] goest here's David
[1:16:42] because he's part of the Kingdom
[1:16:45] telling Solomon what God told Joshua
[1:16:51] parents
[1:16:54] tell your children the scriptures
[1:16:57] concerning things in their life
[1:17:00] share quotes with them
[1:17:04] that's how you build courage
[1:17:06] don't be afraid
[1:17:08] God's with you
[1:17:10] we're here for you
[1:17:12] the Church of the Living God's praying
[1:17:14] for you
[1:17:16] fortify them
[1:17:19] don't worry if they don't listen and
[1:17:22] they act like they're rolling their eyes
[1:17:23] you know and a little more religion
[1:17:26] don't worry you're not talked into the
[1:17:28] state they're in
[1:17:29] you're prophesying the state that
[1:17:32] they'll be
[1:17:37] we're in a different Kingdom
[1:17:40] we got courage in this Kingdom we're not
[1:17:43] ashamed of the Gospel
[1:17:45] I'm not ashamed of the gospel because
[1:17:47] it's the power of God to Salvation I'm
[1:17:51] not ashamed of what we're saying because
[1:17:53] it leads to eternal life I got courage
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] that's one of the benefits
[1:18:03] of being in this Kingdom
[1:18:06] you got courage can you imagine people
[1:18:09] that live
[1:18:10] with no courage
[1:18:12] you know what the prophet of bed said he
[1:18:14] said if you won't stand up for something
[1:18:16] you won't stand up for anything he said
[1:18:20] you had didn't have any backbone
[1:18:26] there's a lot of people that claim to be
[1:18:28] in this Kingdom that don't have any
[1:18:29] backbone
[1:18:31] if you don't have backbone if you don't
[1:18:34] have courage let me tell you ask
[1:18:37] that doubt might receive and ask
[1:18:40] abundantly just don't ask for courage to
[1:18:43] ask for the kind of Courage that uh
[1:18:46] David had
[1:18:50] discernment
[1:18:54] that's the benefit of living in this
[1:18:56] Kingdom
[1:18:57] having the what is the kingdom it's the
[1:19:00] power of God in you so we're talking
[1:19:03] about a power that gives you peace joy
[1:19:07] that gives you that gives you courage
[1:19:09] that gives you discernment let's just
[1:19:11] throw some scriptures up there first
[1:19:13] John 4 and 1.
[1:19:18] if you don't have any of these things
[1:19:21] they're yours
[1:19:23] they're part of the policy they're part
[1:19:25] of the benefit beloved
[1:19:28] believe not every spirit
[1:19:34] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:19:39] God
[1:19:40] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:19:44] into the
[1:19:46] world
[1:19:49] oh aren't you glad
[1:19:52] you have the discernment you're not
[1:19:54] babes you can discern between Good and
[1:19:57] Evil
[1:19:58] amen you're in the kingdom of God you've
[1:20:00] got the power of God what is the power
[1:20:03] of God that's what the Holy Ghost is the
[1:20:05] Holy Ghost isn't an anointing it's not
[1:20:08] an emotion it's not a shout it's the
[1:20:10] power of Jesus Christ the resurrection
[1:20:15] living in human flesh
[1:20:18] Glory
[1:20:21] and you got it
[1:20:24] throw up there uh
[1:20:27] first Thessalonians 5 and 21.
[1:20:33] okay you just might be a young teenager
[1:20:36] you might be going through this trouble
[1:20:37] but I'm telling you all these things are
[1:20:39] there for you prove all things
[1:20:42] hold facts to that which is good
[1:20:50] you've got the ability
[1:20:52] you've got the power
[1:20:54] to look at it
[1:20:56] and say
[1:20:59] you can I approve that thing
[1:21:02] you can actually uh look at it and say
[1:21:05] Satan appears as an angel of Light
[1:21:12] and you say
[1:21:13] no sir buddy
[1:21:17] you ain't no angel of Light
[1:21:19] you speak with forked tongue
[1:21:24] you're the father of life
[1:21:27] what you're telling me is not true
[1:21:30] how many remember Saint Martin
[1:21:35] all of a sudden he has a vision
[1:21:37] an angel appears before and starts
[1:21:41] getting monishing him and telling all
[1:21:45] these things and uplifting him and after
[1:21:49] Martin is sitting there and he says I'm
[1:21:52] your lord
[1:21:54] and Martin looked at that
[1:21:56] and the spirit was right
[1:21:58] everything was right but he had a crown
[1:22:01] on
[1:22:07] I wonder if an angel appeared in your
[1:22:10] bedroom tonight
[1:22:12] and started talking to you
[1:22:14] first
[1:22:16] I wonder if you'd have enough courage
[1:22:20] to talk back
[1:22:23] I think if an angel appeared to most
[1:22:25] Believers they'd be scared to death they
[1:22:28] wouldn't know whether it was an angel or
[1:22:29] not they wouldn't know what to do with
[1:22:32] it because they're out of fellowship
[1:22:34] with God
[1:22:37] it ought to be an everyday occurrence
[1:22:40] that God speaks to you
[1:22:42] hear ye him
[1:22:44] prophet of God said we don't hear him
[1:22:46] because we don't listen
[1:22:50] we don't give them time to speak
[1:22:53] then he looked at him he said haha I
[1:22:56] don't care how you look
[1:22:58] I don't care how sweet your words are
[1:23:01] you got a crown
[1:23:03] that's unscriptural because the Saints
[1:23:06] are going to Crown you
[1:23:11] you know what he started to say
[1:23:14] get behind me
[1:23:17] get behind me Satan
[1:23:19] victory is mine that's what he started
[1:23:22] seeing a victory is mine Victorino over
[1:23:26] Saint Mark God said I told Satan and get
[1:23:30] thee behind oh Victory today is my
[1:23:34] discernment
[1:23:37] you got him spotted a mile away
[1:23:40] you give them the what the word test you
[1:23:43] try a spirit to see whether it's God or
[1:23:45] not you know to do that
[1:23:48] I pray God that you try my spirit every
[1:23:51] Sunday
[1:23:58] but at least be fair to try your spirit
[1:24:00] also
[1:24:05] you know
[1:24:08] but just think of it
[1:24:09] in this Kingdom
[1:24:12] we've got discernment
[1:24:14] we don't have to be afraid if he appears
[1:24:17] as an angel of Light
[1:24:19] we can discern it
[1:24:21] we've got the spirit of Truth
[1:24:24] amen right isn't that what the scripture
[1:24:27] says I'll not leave you comfortable but
[1:24:28] even the spirit of truth will come and
[1:24:33] it will lead you and guide you in all
[1:24:35] truth and all righteousness the spirit
[1:24:37] of Truth don't you understand the world
[1:24:40] don't have that benefit they're out
[1:24:42] there lying to one another deceiving one
[1:24:45] another I got a car to sell you it's
[1:24:47] only got ten thousand miles on it granny
[1:24:50] kept it in the garage
[1:24:53] and it looks like it's been to a
[1:24:55] destruction Derby
[1:24:57] it's got banana peels in the
[1:25:00] transmission
[1:25:03] it
[1:25:05] I don't trust the world
[1:25:11] I don't trust what they say I don't
[1:25:13] trust what they sell because their ruler
[1:25:18] right is the spirit of Darkness
[1:25:23] Deceiver
[1:25:24] Satan is a liar
[1:25:28] he's the father of all lies and there's
[1:25:32] no truth in them The World Is A Lie
[1:25:40] the economy is false how many knows the
[1:25:43] prophet of God said America is running
[1:25:44] on a false economy
[1:25:50] guess who holds the bag
[1:25:54] Rome
[1:25:59] who do you think sits on the throne
[1:26:02] as the Vicar of Christ
[1:26:05] what is it Filius Dias Dias or something
[1:26:08] that's on his crown a Triple Crown
[1:26:11] sitting on the Hills
[1:26:13] Rome Rome runs the world
[1:26:16] don't be afraid of Communism be afraid
[1:26:18] of what romanism
[1:26:21] everything the world has to offer that
[1:26:24] has religion it's some guy in a black
[1:26:26] suit and a white collar
[1:26:31] I ain't gonna follow a guy in a Black
[1:26:34] Dress
[1:26:36] with the white collar
[1:26:38] I'm sorry I didn't see much of that in
[1:26:42] the disciples
[1:26:44] look at the Scandal
[1:26:47] that plagues the Catholic Church what is
[1:26:50] the Scandal it's Gamora
[1:26:52] Sodom and Gomorrah all through the
[1:26:54] priesthood all through the church why
[1:26:57] because it's the religion of lady osia
[1:27:03] we don't
[1:27:05] we're not
[1:27:06] worried about that
[1:27:08] we've got discernment
[1:27:12] right
[1:27:17] what's another benefit you don't have to
[1:27:19] be afraid
[1:27:22] there's a difference between courage
[1:27:24] you notice he said be courageous
[1:27:27] courageous is the ability to go forward
[1:27:31] no matter what's in front of you
[1:27:34] courageous means that that that you have
[1:27:39] the determination
[1:27:41] to stand for what you're standing for
[1:27:44] regardless of the threat
[1:27:51] you've got it
[1:27:53] how do you have it because you're in the
[1:27:55] Kingdom and that's a power
[1:27:58] that you have in the Kingdom that this
[1:28:01] world can offer you don't think it can
[1:28:03] offer you get guys that are
[1:28:05] flip-flopping on every issue because
[1:28:07] they're afraid of what the vote is
[1:28:11] they're afraid of what the trend is
[1:28:19] they don't have the courage to stand up
[1:28:21] for anything
[1:28:23] but you talk about being not afraid
[1:28:26] we're not afraid of things past
[1:28:31] that's one thing once you enter this
[1:28:33] Kingdom you don't got a past all you've
[1:28:37] got's future
[1:28:38] present and future you're not afraid of
[1:28:41] the past you're not afraid of the
[1:28:43] present and you're not afraid of the
[1:28:45] future Luke 12 32.
[1:28:53] fear not little flock
[1:28:57] it's the father's good pleasure to give
[1:29:00] you the power
[1:29:06] you don't have to be afraid because you
[1:29:09] know in this Kingdom
[1:29:10] no matter what the challenge is you've
[1:29:14] got a power to overcome
[1:29:17] to him that overcometh
[1:29:20] he'll sit with me on my father's throne
[1:29:24] this is the kingdom that Jesus preached
[1:29:28] he said oh don't just Rejoice because
[1:29:31] Spirits are subject to you I saw Satan
[1:29:34] found but Rejoice because your name's
[1:29:36] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:29:37] another is Rejoice because you were
[1:29:40] predestinated to receive this power from
[1:29:43] on high and be part of this kingdom do
[1:29:46] you know that you've got the power each
[1:29:48] in you everyone to go to create a world
[1:29:51] and go live on it
[1:29:56] you've got power
[1:30:00] the kingdom is power
[1:30:04] not anointing
[1:30:07] people come under the anointing and they
[1:30:10] walk out and they fall all the pieces
[1:30:13] then they get preached back under
[1:30:15] conviction they're at the author they're
[1:30:17] sobbing and booing because they're a
[1:30:19] sinner and then they get up and they
[1:30:21] shout and rejoice because they're
[1:30:22] delivered and they've got no stain
[1:30:26] power
[1:30:30] if someone returns back in the same
[1:30:33] condition it just tells me they never
[1:30:35] got the Medicine the first time
[1:30:41] you've got power of faith
[1:30:44] once he quickens it to you once he
[1:30:47] reveals it to you you can hang on to it
[1:30:50] you're not afraid
[1:30:54] you have the what the kingdom
[1:30:58] we'll just take a few more I could
[1:31:00] probably go on for a long time
[1:31:06] how about obstacles
[1:31:11] boy
[1:31:12] isn't that a Bitcoin huh let's look at
[1:31:16] mark 11.
[1:31:18] uh in 23.
[1:31:22] we get obstacles all the time
[1:31:25] we're going a certain way we want a
[1:31:28] certain thing we're trying to do better
[1:31:30] and poof Here Comes an obstacle
[1:31:33] for verily I say unto you that
[1:31:36] whatsoever
[1:31:38] shall say unto this mountain
[1:31:42] be thou removed
[1:31:44] and be cast into the sea
[1:31:48] and shall not doubt in your heart but
[1:31:53] Shall Believe
[1:31:54] those things which ye shall
[1:32:00] which seems he saith shall come to pass
[1:32:04] he shall have whatsoever he's saith
[1:32:10] now just think in this Kingdom
[1:32:14] you have a power
[1:32:17] to move obstacles
[1:32:21] go out into the world
[1:32:24] and see if you can move obstacles
[1:32:27] you know how the world removes obstacles
[1:32:30] they compromise
[1:32:33] they make deals
[1:32:36] don't make no deals with the Devil
[1:32:42] you don't have to compromise
[1:32:44] you got the kingdom of God
[1:32:47] you've got not the kingdom not heaven
[1:32:50] not eternal life
[1:32:54] I want to move that from your mind that
[1:32:57] the kingdom of God is heaven that's the
[1:32:59] reward to all those that live in the
[1:33:02] kingdom and have the power
[1:33:05] if the same power
[1:33:08] or Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:33:10] dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal
[1:33:13] body
[1:33:14] that's why it's important to get in this
[1:33:18] Kingdom it's important to invest in this
[1:33:21] Kingdom it's important to be in this
[1:33:24] Kingdom
[1:33:26] and study
[1:33:28] to show yourself approved find out what
[1:33:32] power is allotted to you by the blood of
[1:33:36] the Lamb
[1:33:39] go up there and get endued with power
[1:33:41] from and high
[1:33:43] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:33:46] cast out Devils Lay Your Hands on the
[1:33:50] sick
[1:33:53] that's the kingdom
[1:33:55] I want to be a part of
[1:33:56] that's the kingdom
[1:33:59] that the prophet of God came to restore
[1:34:03] the faith that our fathers had the faith
[1:34:07] in the Kingdom power
[1:34:09] that existed in them on Earth the
[1:34:12] kingdom of God is where it's
[1:34:15] within you that's right
[1:34:18] see if I well I had that scripture this
[1:34:21] morning but you know the scripture
[1:34:24] the kingdom of God come noteth in word
[1:34:27] but it is with in you it's a power
[1:34:31] within you the kingdom of God is within
[1:34:34] you
[1:34:37] how many's got that
[1:34:39] okay you've got the kingdom
[1:34:42] use it
[1:34:45] use it it's yours
[1:34:48] so you've got the the power how about
[1:34:50] sickness
[1:34:53] we all know this scripture by Heart
[1:34:55] Right Isaiah 50 I think it's Isaiah 55
[1:35:00] 15.
[1:35:02] or 53 15.
[1:35:05] give me 55.
[1:35:08] 53 5 first
[1:35:15] ah
[1:35:17] just think of that
[1:35:19] when you're in this Kingdom
[1:35:22] you have this promise
[1:35:26] you have a source
[1:35:28] of power what is the power of the word
[1:35:37] God cannot
[1:35:38] lie
[1:35:40] the power of the word is God will do
[1:35:44] what he said that's the power of the
[1:35:47] word if he said let there be light
[1:35:50] and there was no light his word was what
[1:35:53] powerless
[1:35:57] but the power of the word is the god who
[1:36:01] stands behind it to bring it to pass
[1:36:06] so when you're in this Kingdom you have
[1:36:09] this power that connects you with that
[1:36:12] word and you know that he keeps his word
[1:36:15] therefore you're a hundred percent
[1:36:18] invested
[1:36:20] by Calvary in that word
[1:36:25] sickness
[1:36:28] but he was wounded for our
[1:36:31] transgressions
[1:36:32] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:36:36] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:36:39] and with his stripes we were healed
[1:36:44] how how evident
[1:36:48] what that word
[1:36:51] that was spoken in this Kingdom
[1:36:56] came to pass
[1:37:00] and he was bruised
[1:37:03] right
[1:37:04] he was Catholic chastising his peace was
[1:37:06] upon us
[1:37:08] he went through all those things it was
[1:37:10] prophesied he would do it and what did
[1:37:13] he do he did it how many prophecies were
[1:37:15] there of the Lord and every single one
[1:37:17] of them come to pass why because in this
[1:37:20] Kingdom the kingdom of God the power of
[1:37:23] God it comes to pass
[1:37:27] amen are we just we'll refer back to the
[1:37:31] arrow sermon
[1:37:32] right God's got an arrow every promise
[1:37:36] put an arrow in the sky
[1:37:39] to land in your life when you need it
[1:37:42] that's the benefit of the Kingdom
[1:37:48] I'm with you
[1:37:50] I'll be in you I won't forsake you I
[1:37:53] won't leave you if you ask it'll be done
[1:37:57] how many wants to trade
[1:38:01] the world
[1:38:03] for this power
[1:38:07] any takers
[1:38:11] I don't want
[1:38:13] what has it got to offer brother Billy
[1:38:17] it can't give me peace it can't give me
[1:38:20] joy it can't give me courage it can give
[1:38:22] me nothing
[1:38:24] right it's sickness
[1:38:27] you know what I mean and I love what the
[1:38:30] prophet of God told us he said if God
[1:38:33] wants
[1:38:34] you hear
[1:38:36] there's not enough sickness or devils
[1:38:40] to take you
[1:38:43] how'd you like to approach a sickness
[1:38:45] like that
[1:38:46] I'm not afraid of you sickness
[1:38:50] sickness you do not determine whether I
[1:38:54] have faith or not
[1:38:57] because I believe the word
[1:39:03] I remember I went through that trial
[1:39:05] I'll share it with you again I'll
[1:39:06] probably share it with you a hundred
[1:39:07] times more
[1:39:09] there is a sister in our church
[1:39:12] and that sister had faith
[1:39:15] real faith
[1:39:17] and I believe with all my heart that she
[1:39:22] was going to get well
[1:39:24] and I went and saw her the night before
[1:39:26] Thanksgiving
[1:39:29] and I went in to talk to her and I said
[1:39:31] sister Carol how you oh I'm doing good
[1:39:33] brother David
[1:39:35] we talked a few minutes and I said you
[1:39:38] know I believe with you sis I stand with
[1:39:40] your arm and arm and I'll never forget
[1:39:43] it I started out the door and she said
[1:39:45] wait a minute Brother David I said yes
[1:39:47] sister Carol and she looked at me and
[1:39:50] she said I really love you
[1:39:54] and it was it came from a place it
[1:39:57] wasn't any kind of I love you that I
[1:40:01] ever heard before
[1:40:03] it was like him
[1:40:06] talking
[1:40:07] Shivers went up my mind and just
[1:40:11] there was such an anointing with it and
[1:40:14] her face just glowed and I said thank
[1:40:18] you sister Carol I love you too
[1:40:22] and out I went
[1:40:25] and the next day I went up to the
[1:40:27] hospital
[1:40:30] and I said I'm looking for uh where's
[1:40:33] Karen Carol at and I looked through the
[1:40:38] room and and they said are are you
[1:40:40] family
[1:40:42] I said no I'm her pastor
[1:40:45] at
[1:40:46] they said well she passed
[1:40:49] last night
[1:40:51] and I went to the Lord
[1:40:54] I was devastated for weeks how could
[1:40:56] this be how could this be I believed
[1:41:00] With All My Heart Lord
[1:41:03] and I quoted the mountain I quoted all
[1:41:06] these things and then when I finally got
[1:41:08] it takes time to break into the presence
[1:41:11] of the Lord
[1:41:12] God is not a microwave oven
[1:41:18] they that wait
[1:41:21] upon the Lord
[1:41:23] and so I was so devastated and I sought
[1:41:26] the Lord and I sought the Lord and I and
[1:41:28] finally I got in this presence I said
[1:41:30] Lord I believed
[1:41:32] I believe with all my heart
[1:41:36] he said simply one thing to me what else
[1:41:40] could you do
[1:41:42] you're a
[1:41:44] believer
[1:41:48] I don't have the scripture written down
[1:41:51] but the scripture says believe all
[1:41:53] things
[1:41:56] what else was I going to do
[1:42:01] but believe
[1:42:03] I don't have an option
[1:42:07] I don't have an option I don't have to
[1:42:10] worry about who goes and who dies I
[1:42:14] don't have to worry about praying for
[1:42:16] the sick whether they'll get well or not
[1:42:19] I'm a Believer I'll pray for a thousand
[1:42:22] if they all drop dead I'll pray for one
[1:42:25] thousand and one
[1:42:27] whether they go or whether they don't
[1:42:29] call whether they get well or don't get
[1:42:31] well that does not affect me
[1:42:37] because if God wants to take you
[1:42:40] there's not enough doctors or medicine
[1:42:43] to keep you here
[1:42:46] it's in the hands of God
[1:42:49] not in the hands of the sickness
[1:42:57] let me say that again
[1:42:59] a person that's sick is not in the hands
[1:43:02] of the sickness
[1:43:04] they're in the hands of God
[1:43:09] and that's what I got to believe
[1:43:12] I've got one choice one thing this
[1:43:16] Kingdom allows me only one thing and
[1:43:19] that is Isaiah 53 and 5.
[1:43:25] I have no other thought on the matter
[1:43:29] he's still a Healer
[1:43:32] you say well he they took him home did
[1:43:34] he
[1:43:35] did they die
[1:43:38] foreign
[1:43:43] let's go to our last
[1:43:45] benefit
[1:43:47] death
[1:43:51] huh
[1:43:56] oh death
[1:43:59] are we afraid of death
[1:44:04] we've overcome death hell and the grave
[1:44:07] what's Corinthians First Corinthians 50
[1:44:11] 15 55 to 8.
[1:44:18] oh death
[1:44:20] where is thy stain oh grave where is thy
[1:44:25] Victory what's the next scripture The
[1:44:28] Sting of death is sin and the strength
[1:44:31] of sin is the law if you go on that's a
[1:44:34] beautiful portion of scripture if you
[1:44:37] want to read it all the way to the let's
[1:44:38] go to the 58th verse
[1:44:41] therefore my beloved brethren
[1:44:44] be steadfast unmovable always abounding
[1:44:48] in the work of the Lord for much as ye
[1:44:52] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:44:56] the Lord oh death where's your sting old
[1:44:59] grave is where's your Victory I'm going
[1:45:01] to abound in the service of the Lord in
[1:45:05] other words I'm going to keep investing
[1:45:07] in this Kingdom because this Kingdom's
[1:45:10] got benefits that the world can't even
[1:45:13] think of it hasn't even entered into the
[1:45:16] thoughts and the hearts of men the thing
[1:45:18] that God's prepared for them to love
[1:45:21] them Hallelujah
[1:45:26] what kingdom today
[1:45:29] are we in
[1:45:31] second Corinthians 5 and 1.
[1:45:38] in God's word good
[1:45:40] for we know that if our Earthly house
[1:45:45] of this Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:45:48] we have a building of God a house not
[1:45:51] made with hands
[1:45:53] Eternal in the heavens
[1:46:00] there's no sting in death
[1:46:03] there's no victory in the grave it don't
[1:46:05] got me
[1:46:06] oh I'm going to take your body
[1:46:09] good luck
[1:46:11] you can have it
[1:46:13] it wasn't no good down here it got sick
[1:46:16] all the time it ached all the time it
[1:46:19] got old it lost its memory it lost its
[1:46:22] strength it lost his Beauty
[1:46:25] I used to be beautiful and
[1:46:28] you can have this old
[1:46:31] piece of junk
[1:46:33] this old cloak
[1:46:36] this body that was shaped in sin
[1:46:40] formed in iniquity come in the world
[1:46:43] speaking life is I have no record
[1:46:47] of this body doing me any good
[1:46:52] until the kingdom came
[1:46:59] and then he gave me an earnest
[1:47:03] he gave me the power
[1:47:05] to let me know
[1:47:07] that this kingdom is real
[1:47:10] then there's no death
[1:47:13] has no victory over me if I leave you
[1:47:17] can have this dust bag
[1:47:19] because I got another house
[1:47:23] one not made by hands in other words not
[1:47:26] produced
[1:47:28] by human to Human
[1:47:31] but produced by the word of God
[1:47:34] Hallelujah
[1:47:36] that's where I'm going
[1:47:38] that's what I'm excited about and you
[1:47:41] say well what happens if you don't die
[1:47:43] well if I'm live and remain I shall be
[1:47:46] changed in a twinkling of an eye in a
[1:47:50] moment I'll be changed that why why will
[1:47:53] you be changed because I'm in the
[1:47:55] Kingdom
[1:47:57] and that's the kingdom benefit
[1:48:00] that's what happens when you get this
[1:48:02] power
[1:48:04] well wouldn't somebody that has all
[1:48:07] these benefits presented to them say I
[1:48:09] want that
[1:48:14] I want that power I want that Kingdom I
[1:48:18] want that peace I want that Joy
[1:48:21] you look at job
[1:48:23] I think it was mentioned
[1:48:25] you know
[1:48:30] job went through all the accusation but
[1:48:32] he knew one thing
[1:48:34] he had this sacrifice
[1:48:39] job knew
[1:48:42] you think he was afraid of death
[1:48:44] though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I
[1:48:48] shall see God
[1:48:50] job said I heard about him
[1:48:53] but now I see him
[1:48:59] I know he's real
[1:49:03] you know why job
[1:49:06] got that all straightened out
[1:49:08] is he had Fellowship
[1:49:10] with God
[1:49:13] he had fellowship with him
[1:49:16] he talked it with him he invested in
[1:49:18] them he asked the questions
[1:49:22] if you got a question
[1:49:25] when you come to my office with a
[1:49:27] question you're only getting a second
[1:49:30] maybe the third or fourth best
[1:49:33] I won't put myself anywhere near God if
[1:49:37] you go to him
[1:49:38] and talk with him and fellas with him
[1:49:41] you'll get the answer
[1:49:43] 90 percent of the people that come and
[1:49:46] ask for advice already know
[1:49:50] what God told them
[1:49:53] they're just wrestling with it
[1:49:57] I got a lot of people in here that could
[1:50:00] testify they've came in my office and
[1:50:02] sat down and I told them exactly why
[1:50:04] they were there
[1:50:09] by some form of discernment
[1:50:12] I don't know I just know that God's word
[1:50:15] is the answer
[1:50:17] and they already have the answer
[1:50:20] in their heart
[1:50:21] they already know what they're going to
[1:50:23] do
[1:50:25] if somebody has something in their heart
[1:50:27] to do something you're not going to
[1:50:29] change them
[1:50:31] they've got a litany
[1:50:34] of reasons and excuses
[1:50:37] they'll take you back all over the
[1:50:39] history of something and all this and
[1:50:42] all that and you just sit there and
[1:50:44] you've only got one answer and it's the
[1:50:46] word
[1:50:49] you say well what happens if they make
[1:50:51] the wrong decision
[1:50:52] you know one of the other benefits of
[1:50:55] this kingdom is
[1:50:56] if you take the permissive will God will
[1:50:59] work it to his perfect will all things
[1:51:02] work together according to the good who
[1:51:05] are called according to his purpose job
[1:51:07] was in fellowship with God you think job
[1:51:12] he was blessed
[1:51:14] beyond measure
[1:51:16] and Satan was out for a walk
[1:51:19] and he stopped after going to and fro
[1:51:22] through the Earth what do you think
[1:51:24] Satan was doing going through to and
[1:51:27] throw to the Earth
[1:51:29] sowing lies so in deception trying to
[1:51:33] build his kingdom trying to sell the
[1:51:36] world
[1:51:38] and he come across job
[1:51:41] and God said do you consider my servant
[1:51:43] job
[1:51:44] there's none like him
[1:51:48] he worships me he sticks with me
[1:51:51] he said yeah that's because he's blessed
[1:51:55] that's because you got to hedge about
[1:51:57] him that's because he's got ten thousand
[1:52:00] camels and a hundred thousand sheep and
[1:52:02] he's got a bank account anybody would
[1:52:05] serve you
[1:52:08] now job had something more than Goods
[1:52:11] he had the kingdom
[1:52:13] he had the love of God in his heart he
[1:52:16] who loves the world and the things of
[1:52:18] the world the love of God is not in them
[1:52:24] the kind of Fellowship Joe would have
[1:52:25] with God
[1:52:26] he wasn't trusting in his riches he was
[1:52:29] trusting in the god they give him the
[1:52:32] lord giveth the lord taketh away at
[1:52:34] blessed be the name of the Lord I'm
[1:52:37] going to remain in the kingdom of God
[1:52:40] whether I have or I have not there's one
[1:52:43] thing I despise is that people who lose
[1:52:47] a blessing and they quit God
[1:52:50] God was only good enough for him well
[1:52:53] everything was going good well when they
[1:52:56] hit a little hardship they just Chuck
[1:52:58] him on the Shelf
[1:53:02] well job
[1:53:04] Satan says he says you can have them
[1:53:08] but there's one thing you can't touch
[1:53:10] and that's his life
[1:53:13] because his life belongs to me
[1:53:22] I want to testify tonight
[1:53:24] my life
[1:53:26] belongs to him
[1:53:30] if he takes me praise His name
[1:53:33] if me lets me live praise His name if I
[1:53:37] have nothing praise His name if I have
[1:53:40] much praise His name
[1:53:44] praise His name
[1:53:46] Hallelujah and one by one plow this
[1:53:49] happened servants came in he lost his
[1:53:52] kids everything was there now finally
[1:53:55] this guy is sitting on a pile of dung
[1:54:01] he got so driven out by everybody he's
[1:54:04] finally sitting on a dung Heap scraping
[1:54:07] his boils
[1:54:09] and finally his wife turned to him
[1:54:12] and said why don't you curse God and die
[1:54:16] he said no
[1:54:18] I am not going to curse God
[1:54:20] the lord gave everything to me the Lord
[1:54:23] took everything away with me he's still
[1:54:25] King of Kings he's still Lord of Lord
[1:54:27] he's still the god that's in control and
[1:54:30] I am not going to turn my back on him
[1:54:35] and he got to fellowship and with job
[1:54:39] got to fellowship and with God and God
[1:54:42] starts talking to job how would you like
[1:54:44] God to say to you where were you
[1:54:47] when the world was formed
[1:54:50] when the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:54:54] did you know God said that to you
[1:54:57] in this generation
[1:54:59] through the mouth of the prophet
[1:55:03] he came and told you your names on the
[1:55:05] book
[1:55:06] he brought all these benefits back to
[1:55:08] life He restored back the kingdom of God
[1:55:13] to his bride
[1:55:16] just like Esther
[1:55:19] half of my kingdom
[1:55:21] my gifty
[1:55:25] in other words I'll make you equal to me
[1:55:30] did you know if you're in this Kingdom
[1:55:32] your little Messiahs
[1:55:40] your gods
[1:55:42] thank you
[1:55:43] not in your flesh but because your
[1:55:46] spirit and your mind is in the Kingdom
[1:55:50] what about this flesh he's going to do
[1:55:53] away with it
[1:55:55] how many wants to take this bucket of
[1:55:57] bones with them
[1:55:59] I can just see me up walking across the
[1:56:01] street to go oh
[1:56:06] I can hardly sit and not stand up to
[1:56:09] preach a sermon
[1:56:14] you don't like that offer
[1:56:17] huh
[1:56:19] oh I got migraine headaches excuse me
[1:56:22] Peter I gotta find a dark place
[1:56:27] I don't want this body
[1:56:32] I'm trying to get rid of the human
[1:56:34] factor
[1:56:36] but I've been invited into a kingdom
[1:56:42] come into the kingdom of God
[1:56:46] invest in it
[1:56:48] get in fellowship with it
[1:56:51] talk it over with them
[1:56:54] the prophet of God said the church has a
[1:56:56] bank account
[1:56:58] but they're afraid to write the check
[1:57:02] he says the others have the check
[1:57:05] but they don't have nothing in the
[1:57:06] account
[1:57:11] the kingdom of God is real Church
[1:57:14] that's what we're preaching
[1:57:17] that's what Jesus preached
[1:57:21] every single one of these benefits that
[1:57:24] we talked about tonight are found
[1:57:27] in the scriptures
[1:57:34] Matthew 5 6 and 7.
[1:57:38] Peter Paul James John all the scriptures
[1:57:41] we read
[1:57:43] kingdom is real
[1:57:46] the trouble is the church is afraid to
[1:57:50] move into the kingdom
[1:57:52] because they don't have confidence
[1:57:56] that the kingdom will take care of them
[1:58:01] and you want to know the attribute that
[1:58:05] job possessed
[1:58:08] the prophet of God said job had
[1:58:11] confidence
[1:58:13] because he was fellowshipped
[1:58:16] with God
[1:58:21] all I want is your pastor is to have you
[1:58:25] to have the confidence in the existence
[1:58:29] of this Kingdom
[1:58:31] God sent a messenger
[1:58:34] and proved to us but on the shadow of a
[1:58:37] doubt that he's here
[1:58:41] and fear not little flock it's the
[1:58:43] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:58:45] kingdom he was telling the church World
[1:58:48] telling everybody out there all these
[1:58:51] systems and all this stuff you're doing
[1:58:53] it's not the kingdom
[1:58:56] it's not what God offered you it's not
[1:58:59] what God brought to you God brought to
[1:59:03] you a power that you can possess
[1:59:08] and have in you
[1:59:10] that overcomes the world and the things
[1:59:16] of the world
[1:59:17] church that's what we're about
[1:59:21] we're not about the shout
[1:59:23] we're not about the dance we're about
[1:59:26] the power
[1:59:29] the power in you is an individual not
[1:59:33] the power in the group
[1:59:35] prophet of God said I love to shout and
[1:59:38] dance he says I do he says but that's
[1:59:41] not it
[1:59:43] it's the power of God in the human
[1:59:47] flesh in an individual that can meet
[1:59:51] every
[1:59:53] challenge that Satan has and it can meet
[1:59:56] him face to face and stand on the word
[1:59:59] of God and have competence that no
[2:00:02] matter how you feel
[2:00:06] amen the word will win
[2:00:10] will someone do an experiment for me
[2:00:14] how many will do experiment for me
[2:00:18] oh I got some guys that fell for that
[2:00:21] would you fast for 40 days and 40 nights
[2:00:24] without food and water and tell me how
[2:00:27] you feel
[2:00:32] you don't have to
[2:00:34] I've tried to fast
[2:00:36] in my ignorance
[2:00:38] I tried to make 40 days in 40 nights I
[2:00:42] was done after 40 hours
[2:00:46] how did he feel
[2:00:49] he didn't go by how he felt
[2:00:52] he went by what he believed he knew the
[2:00:55] kingdom of God was real he said get
[2:00:58] behind me Satan it
[2:01:01] is
[2:01:02] written
[2:01:05] don't you love him I hope you feel his
[2:01:08] presence the way I do my heart's
[2:01:10] bubbling over I've got joy I've got
[2:01:13] peace I've Got Confidence I I've got I
[2:01:17] can move obstacles I've got courage
[2:01:20] discernment I'm not afraid you know I'm
[2:01:23] not worried about sickness
[2:01:25] and I'm not worried about death
[2:01:30] I know people that are afraid to die
[2:01:36] they've confessed it to me
[2:01:38] and almost like want to get to them is
[2:01:42] just the earnest of this Kingdom
[2:01:46] and no you don't have to be afraid of
[2:01:50] death
[2:01:52] it doesn't have a sting
[2:01:54] and it doesn't have a victory
[2:01:57] it's just opening the door
[2:02:00] for a new body
[2:02:02] Paul said I would rather go
[2:02:05] be with the Lord
[2:02:09] but it's needful for me to be here
[2:02:12] for you
[2:02:14] wouldn't that be wonderful if we all
[2:02:15] felt that way
[2:02:17] Church
[2:02:19] let's invest in the Kingdom let's quit
[2:02:24] investing our time
[2:02:27] and our effort
[2:02:29] and our hours and our money
[2:02:33] in garbage that doesn't do us any good
[2:02:41] you say when's the best time to start
[2:02:43] investing now
[2:02:48] the Younger You Are
[2:02:50] the greater these benefits become
[2:02:52] amen I hope you understand my heart
[2:02:56] the I hope you understand the word of
[2:02:59] God I hope tonight that you can draw a
[2:03:02] clear discernment between the world
[2:03:06] and the kingdom of God the kingdom of
[2:03:09] God is not a place
[2:03:13] the kingdom of God is more than a place
[2:03:17] the kingdom of God is a Dwelling Place
[2:03:21] not in this world
[2:03:25] but in the spiritual Realm
[2:03:28] of Fellowship
[2:03:30] with the Lord Jesus
[2:03:32] where you have power
[2:03:35] over the world
[2:03:37] and all its devils
[2:03:40] let's seek the power
[2:03:42] for those that you don't have it you
[2:03:45] don't think you have it seek until that
[2:03:48] question is answered in your heart
[2:03:52] if you ever want prayer we can pray
[2:03:56] but it's the father's good
[2:03:59] pleasure
[2:04:01] to give you
[2:04:03] the kingdom God bless you brother Billy
[2:04:14] amen
[2:04:16] praise the Lord

[2:04:20] wonderful just the calmness you know
[2:04:23] sometimes we love mysteries we love to
[2:04:26] stand up and shout and all of those
[2:04:28] things but I believe what we're heard
[2:04:31] tonight is the applicable word that
[2:04:33] would win the victory when you get out
[2:04:36] of that door man this is not some you
[2:04:39] know talk about Mysteries and God coming
