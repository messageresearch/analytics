[26:09] in worship of you, Lord.
[26:17] We need [singing] you, Lord.

[26:31] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[26:45] &gt;&gt; more than ever before. We need him now.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the days gets evil, we need
[26:51] more and more of him. Amen. And less of
[26:54] us. Amen. We have a couple announcements
[26:56] to make at this time. Uh there will be
[26:59] an adult and youth choir practice uh uh
[27:01] right after service in in this morning
[27:04] in the fellowship uh uh uh hall and it's
[27:08] uh so right after service this morning
[27:11] just go in [music] the fellowship hall
[27:12] for the choir practice. Amen. Also,
[27:14] brother Tim is going to be making some
[27:16] announcements about the youth uh sorry
[27:18] the uh Sunday school. Um like I said
[27:21] this morning, [music] brother Matthew is
[27:22] preaching up in uh Oklahoma and I know
[27:25] that there's a group that went with
[27:26] them. We want to remember them this
[27:28] [music] morning. Amen. Don't forget our
[27:30] meetings. I believe is about two weeks
[27:32] from today. [music]
[27:34] Uh so if we could just do all that we
[27:36] can and you know take off from work and
[27:39] [music]
[27:40] pray and and just how many how many
[27:43] actually get excited about special
[27:45] meetings?
[27:46] I I tell you there's such [music] an
[27:49] expectation that people come with that
[27:51] the Lord does special things and [music]
[27:53] I I believe we all have needs this
[27:56] morning. Amen. As we still in the human
[27:58] body, we'll have needs but I believe
[28:01] that when we bring those needs before
[28:02] [music] him, he will answer it. Not just
[28:05] for the meeting even this morning, it's
[28:07] our expectation that [music] determines
[28:09] what we will receive from him. Amen.
[28:12] Also, brother Darien writes uh [music]
[28:14] is asking uh praise report for sister
[28:17] Doran. Uh she uh has been taken off the
[28:20] oxygen and uh she's being treated
[28:23] [music] to eliminate uh uh uh melanoma
[28:27] cells and thank you all for your prayers
[28:29] this [music] morning. So, we're going to
[28:30] continue to pray for her. Amen. Um,
[28:33] brother uh Jose writes, "Please pray for
[28:36] Dan [music]
[28:37] uh uh but uh brother Dan Apollo
[28:40] Appalonio son um he had an emergency
[28:44] surgery and everything went well. We're
[28:46] just [music] praying for a faster
[28:47] recovery." Amen. Amen. We know um want
[28:51] to just remember sister Leslie this
[28:53] morning. She's home not feeling well. We
[28:55] just [music] pray that the Lord will
[28:56] lift her up. If you have a need upon
[28:58] your heart, why don't you just lift your
[29:00] hand up this morning to him and we'll
[29:02] invite brother Tim to make the [music]
[29:03] announcements and to pray for the needs
[29:05] this morning and the brothers that are
[29:07] taking the offerings [music] if you
[29:08] could come when you're ready uh right
[29:10] after brother Tim prays. Amen.
[29:13] God bless you.
[29:16] Amen.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Good morning to you. Shalom. Shalom.
[29:19] Peace be unto you. Uh it's an exciting
[29:22] time of the year. Many things are
[29:24] happening as we, as the brother said, we
[29:26] look forward to the meetings coming
[29:28] coming up. And we're getting ready for
[29:31] the uh Sunday school to put on a another
[29:34] Christmas program for you. And uh we've
[29:37] already started this morning. Uh there
[29:39] won't be Sunday school. They're actually
[29:41] practicing songs and their parts over
[29:43] there getting things arranged.
[29:46] [clears throat] And uh I just want to
[29:47] cover a couple things. My better
[29:50] threequarters is not with me this
[29:52] morning, so I have to make sure I get
[29:54] this right. Um, it's going to be
[29:56] December the 13th at 700 p.m. All right.
[30:00] We want your children here about 6:00
[30:02] p.m. so we can prepare them, get them
[30:04] ready. We're [clears throat] going to
[30:06] put on a program we're calling uh
[30:09] uh Christmas Road Trip, the journey of a
[30:11] lifetime. Um, I think it'll be a
[30:14] blessing to both the children and to
[30:16] you. We're gonna they're going to be
[30:18] getting some handouts for their [music]
[30:20] parts,
[30:22] either reading scriptures, acting out
[30:25] their parts or and the singing of the
[30:27] songs. So, we ask that you would kind of
[30:29] help them with that. If you want to
[30:31] learn the songs with them, that's great.
[30:33] Um, but, uh, it'll be a benefit if we
[30:36] can get them here
[30:39] about 9:30 is when the doors are going
[30:41] to open. So, the earlier we can get them
[30:42] to Sunday school, the better uh we'll be
[30:44] prepared and practiced. We'll say on
[30:47] November 30th, there will be a a hold
[30:50] over practice. We'll provide pizza,
[30:52] excuse me, as a meal between services
[30:55] and they're going to stay over and
[30:56] practice during that time. So, uh
[31:01] uh pizza lunch will be provided then.
[31:04] Um,
[31:13] I think that uh just about covers it.
[31:16] Amen. I want to make sure I cover
[31:19] everything. So, 7 700 p.m. have your
[31:22] children here at 6 [music] on the 13th
[31:24] of December. Okay? And then November
[31:26] 30th, we're going to hold them over and
[31:28] practice between. Okay?
[31:32] You know, I was very appreciative of
[31:34] Brother George's song, We Need Him Right
[31:37] Now.
[31:40] I was reading the book of Job
[31:45] and knowing the trials he went through.
[31:50] He said, "Oh,
[31:54] if I knew where I might find him,
[31:58] I wouldn't make my way to his seat."
[32:02] And where is his seat this morning?
[32:05] I'm not saying we're overcrowded and he
[32:07] doesn't have space.
[32:09] But it's a seat in our hearts that we
[32:11] have to make room and allow the Lord
[32:13] Jesus to have preeminence.
[32:18] There's needs this morning that been
[32:19] read, serious needs. There's needs of my
[32:21] own family. [snorts]
[32:24] It's a heartfelt cry. Sometimes we don't
[32:27] even know how to pray, but our groanings
[32:29] and utterings, the Lord can perceive all
[32:32] of those things, even our thoughts.
[32:34] So if you have a need, just slip your
[32:36] hand up and say, "Lord, I have a special
[32:38] need."
[32:42] Like Job said, "I went forward, he
[32:45] wasn't there. I went backward and I
[32:47] couldn't perceive [music] him. On the
[32:49] left, where it doesn't work,
[32:50] &gt;&gt; he said I couldn't behold him. On the
[32:52] right, but Lord, you know my steps.
[32:55] You're going to try me and I'm going to
[32:56] come forth as gold." [music] Think of
[32:58] that. the struggles we're going through,
[33:01] there'll be nothing when we reach the
[33:02] end of the way. [music] If we would,
[33:04] let's just all stand and go to the Lord
[33:06] in prayer. [snorts]
[33:12] Oh, gracious Lord. [snorts] Lord, we're
[33:15] so humbled. We get emotional.
[33:18] [music] Lord, we get tenderhearted when
[33:20] we approach your throne
[33:23] because Lord, we know [music] it's only
[33:25] by the the [snorts] blood of a redeemed
[33:28] one, a perfect lamb that was slain
[33:30] before the foundation of the world,
[33:32] Lord, that you can have us come into
[33:36] your presence, Lord. We're all sinners
[33:39] saved by grace. We've been cleaned up.
[33:42] Baptism, repentance, all these things.
[33:45] Lord, you filled us with your spirit,
[33:47] but yet Lord, we were in this hall of
[33:49] flesh, these old things that would just
[33:52] hinder and keep your spirit from moving.
[33:55] So [snorts] this morning, Lord, I pray
[33:57] in earnest,
[33:59] Lord, that these things can just be
[34:01] dissolved and wiped away. We can enter
[34:03] into a special place, Lord, of communion
[34:06] with you, [snorts]
[34:07] just like the high priests that would go
[34:09] into the holiest of holies. Everything
[34:11] was pre-arranged and ordained [snorts]
[34:15] and there was comfort. There was safety
[34:16] in knowing that everything was just
[34:19] right. He'd been cleaned. He'd been
[34:22] adorned in the right apparel. Everything
[34:24] was set aside.
[34:26] And Lord, we so often come in your
[34:28] presence so callous and so unconcerned.
[34:31] [snorts]
[34:33] But Lord, we're we're approaching you as
[34:35] our father and the creator of heaven and
[34:38] earth.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know our thoughts.
[34:41] You know our hearts. There's doors and
[34:43] doors, Lord, that we try to keep
[34:45] private, but you know it all. [music] So
[34:47] we, Lord, we lift up our souls to you
[34:49] and ask you to clean us within and
[34:51] without, Lord, that nothing would hinder
[34:53] our prayer [music] in the expectation of
[34:55] our heart, Lord, knowing that if we bind
[34:57] our faith together, that you can answer
[34:59] each of these needs that have been read,
[35:01] each of these needs that have been shown
[35:02] by the uplifted hand, those that are in
[35:05] our hearts. Lord, we [snorts] pray that
[35:07] you just answer each one according to
[35:08] your word, your will, and as you'd see
[35:10] fit, Lord. Lead, guide, and direct us.
[35:13] Lord, we know the time is short. And
[35:16] when the word comes forth this morning,
[35:18] Lord, if it convicts our heart, we say
[35:20] amen. If we recognize it, say amen to
[35:24] it, Lord, then you will benefit us. Add
[35:26] it to our stature, Lord. Our word upon
[35:29] word, line upon line. Pray Lord we just
[35:31] be built up today as we leave here we
[35:34] can have confidence in knowing that you
[35:36] spoke to us along the way [snorts]
[35:39] Lord the ti and offering use it for your
[35:41] honor and glory as well Lord as we have
[35:43] these upcoming meetings may you just
[35:45] light a fire in our hearts Lord come
[35:46] with expectation and know truly [snorts]
[35:49] Lord it's not by some special gathering
[35:52] or or a crowd but Lord there's
[35:54] preparation we set aside these times and
[35:57] these things Lord we want to draw close
[35:58] to you [snorts] we grant Lord Lord, that
[36:00] you just use us as you'd see fit as we
[36:04] give you the honor, the glory, and the
[36:05] praise. And we ask it all in the lovely
[36:07] name of the Lord [snorts] Jesus Christ.
[36:09] Amen.
[36:13] Amen. God bless you. Let all sing. Oh,

[43:14] More [singing] like you
[43:18] and less like [music] me.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:29] &gt;&gt; When I bow [singing]
[43:33] my head to pray,
[43:37] give me Lord [singing]

[47:39] [music] Your holy
[47:43] name.
[47:45] Oh adore [music]
[47:50] God.
[47:52] [music]
[47:54] Oh,

[48:09] [music]
[48:13] my [singing] comfort. [music]
[48:21] Let's all stand and sing it as we
[48:22] [music] find our pastor this morning.
[48:27] Oh Lord, my heart [music] is

[48:41] &gt;&gt; [music]

[48:43] [singing]
[48:47] [music]
[48:55] [music]
[49:00] [music]
[49:06] [music]
[49:08] born [singing]

[49:16] through.
[49:19] Oh, [music]
[49:21] [singing]
[49:27] [music and singing]
[49:28] you
[49:34] all [music]
[49:37] might
[49:41] [music]
[49:42] [singing]
[49:48] to the great.
[49:52] [music]
[49:54] Oh,
[50:01] when you come [music]
[50:08] sing one more time this morning.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[50:16] [singing]
[50:22] your [music] holy
[50:26] name.
[50:29] [music]
[50:35] [music]
[50:42] All [music] the great
[50:45] I
[50:46] am.
[50:48] Oh, [music]
[50:56] I [music]
[51:01] [music]
[51:06] Amen. Let's pray this [music] morning.
[51:08] our gracious heavenly father.
[51:11] Lord, [music]
[51:15] we are your children
[51:18] and we're so thankful to have a father
[51:20] like you that [music]
[51:22] loves us and knows what we have need of
[51:25] and gently guides us with love and
[51:29] mercy.
[51:31] Lord, we ask you this morning that
[51:36] you would enlighten us and you would
[51:39] open our hearts to your word and
[51:42] Father that we could receive it
[51:45] knowing, Father, it was spoken
[51:49] on our behalf and for us.
[51:52] And we're grateful for that. We ask you
[51:55] to bless your people now in Jesus
[51:58] precious [music]
[51:59] name we pray.
[52:00] Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[52:03] let's turn to a a couple real common
[52:07] scriptures
[52:09] in Genesis 1 and the Gospel of St. John
[52:14] 1 and 1 and Genesis 1 through3. I
[52:17] certainly enjoyed that song this
[52:19] morning, Brother Georgees. I was in my
[52:22] office trying to get my voice that low,
[52:26] you know, and uh it was good. And also I
[52:29] thank all the Sunday school kids for all
[52:32] the uh wonderful uh cards and paintings
[52:36] and everything [snorts]
[52:38] they gave me. And they gave me a a box
[52:41] of cards. And so I opened it up and the
[52:44] first card I took out had a turtle on
[52:47] it. And I thought, well, you know, I'm
[52:48] getting pretty slow. I thought that
[52:51] that's prophecy, you know, because I was
[52:54] going to preach a little bit on the
[52:56] children of prophecy this morning and
[52:59] the next one I took out had a crab on it
[53:02] and I thought, well, that might be true,
[53:04] too. I'm getting to be a little crabby.
[53:06] So, but we distrust the God's goodnesses
[53:08] to us. Do you love them this morning?
[53:11] Amen. The things that we want to talk
[53:13] about this morning should make our
[53:14] hearts glad. We're going to listen to 22
[53:18] minutes of a portion of the message,
[53:21] Invisible Union, and I hope you listen
[53:25] to it and and realize he's speaking
[53:28] about you. Amen. So it says in our
[53:32] scriptures here uh found um uh here in
[53:38] in Genesis, in the beginning God created
[53:43] the heavens and earth and the earth was
[53:46] without form and void and darkness was
[53:50] upon the face of the deep. And the
[53:53] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[53:57] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[54:01] light." And there was light. Amen. And
[54:05] let's turn over to St. John
[54:09] and uh also read uh that scripture
[54:14] found there in St. John. Um
[54:19] and uh and that says in St. John, it
[54:25] says the same thing, but this is uh he's
[54:28] trying to uh John's trying to establish
[54:32] the same uh thought here. In the
[54:36] beginning was the word and the word was
[54:38] with God and the word was God and the
[54:42] same was in the beginning with God and
[54:46] all things were made by him and without
[54:50] him was not anything made that was made.
[54:55] Amen. Heavenly Father, we ask you to
[54:57] bless your word in your precious name we
[55:00] pray. Amen. You may be seated this
[55:04] morning.
[55:13] You know, in our age, we're
[55:16] uh really privileged. I I don't think we
[55:21] understand the privilege of our election
[55:25] the way that we should. You know, Paul
[55:29] even wrote it early in in the book of
[55:32] Romans when he began to uh uh speak. He
[55:37] said, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated, the
[55:42] children not yet being born,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; having neither done any good nor evil,
[55:51] but it was that the law of election
[55:55] might stand."
[55:57] And uh so we know without faith it's
[56:01] impossible to please God.
[56:04] So you know uh if if God tells you
[56:08] something, he wants you to know it's for
[56:11] you and he wants you to believe it.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; You know, he he doesn't want you to try
[56:18] to figure it out. He he didn't even
[56:21] require that you understand it. He said
[56:25] he wanted you to believe it on the basis
[56:29] that he spoke it.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; That's what simple faith does. [snorts]
[56:34] If it's very simple, it's if God said
[56:38] so, then that settles it. That it
[56:42] doesn't have to be placed. It doesn't
[56:46] have to be reasoned out. It it has to be
[56:51] uh it has to be accepted.
[56:54] And so I I wrote this little uh thought
[56:57] here that the children of prophecy
[57:00] because prophecy is is to foretell a
[57:05] future event. So all the word of God is
[57:09] really prophecy. Uh in the beginning God
[57:13] said let there be light.
[57:16] And so then and he said let there be
[57:20] light and there was light. So he said,
[57:23] "Let there be." Or he prophesied of a
[57:27] future event. And then the light came
[57:30] and it says, "And there was light." And
[57:33] and so the light was the child of the
[57:38] prophecy.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; So you understand that. So when we say
[57:43] you're the children of prophecy, you you
[57:47] are the the result of what was spoken.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; So something had to be spoken and then
[57:56] when that thing was spoken, so the the
[57:59] the the word that was spoke, it it is
[58:05] the the event that's future told. And
[58:09] then when that event's fulfilled and
[58:12] becomes manifested then that becomes the
[58:15] child of the prophecy.
[58:19] and and so uh we understand that the
[58:23] scriptures begin to prophesy uh quite a
[58:27] few things for our day in the you know
[58:30] like you could read in Timothy and uh
[58:33] John 2:18 and Timothy 4 and3 and Peter 3
[58:39] and and Matthew 24 uh through 20 you
[58:44] know in the last days perilous time
[58:47] shall come there shall be false
[58:49] prophets. Men shall be lovers of
[58:51] pleasure, you know, and all these things
[58:53] that were spoken of our day. And so we
[58:57] find ourselves in our day and we
[59:00] understand that we are the children of
[59:02] that prophecy. We are living in that day
[59:07] that was spoken. And so if you can see
[59:11] what was spoken
[59:13] and then you can and you can see that
[59:17] then you understand that you were placed
[59:20] here by God in this day for a purpose.
[59:26] And we might ask the question, why would
[59:29] God take his bride
[59:33] and put him in this a day that's the
[59:35] most evil, deceptive day there ever was?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You know, that's quite a question, isn't
[59:43] it?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I mean, now you I always look at myself
[59:47] and I think, you know, what would I have
[59:50] done? Well, I would have made it I would
[59:54] have just made it all roses.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I if I was going
[59:58] to put myself somewhere, you know, I
[1:00:01] would have said, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:00:04] predict my future." You know, I I would
[1:00:07] have no rain, no clouds, you know, just
[1:00:10] a beautiful lake, fishing, you know,
[1:00:13] like all the little fishies I got from
[1:00:15] the Sunday school kids.
[1:00:18] You know, everything would be beautiful.
[1:00:21] But it wouldn't it wouldn't develop any
[1:00:24] character in me. There would be nothing
[1:00:28] there to prove me. You know what I mean?
[1:00:31] To test me to show what I really was
[1:00:35] made out of. In fact, I would be
[1:00:37] characterless.
[1:00:39] So if I would I would create a world for
[1:00:42] myself where I wouldn't need have to
[1:00:44] have any character. I wouldn't have to
[1:00:47] have any strength. I wouldn't have to
[1:00:49] have any will. I wouldn't have to have
[1:00:51] any willpower.
[1:00:53] I I would just make it so, you know, I I
[1:00:57] would be really I'd be mush.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; I'd be nothing. But he did it for a
[1:01:03] purpose because
[1:01:06] he wanted to place us here because he
[1:01:10] chose us before the foundation of the
[1:01:12] world. and he elected us and he chose us
[1:01:17] to be the ones
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; that would show Satan that this Eve was
[1:01:23] not like the other Eve.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Now, that's quite a battle that we're
[1:01:30] that we're placed in because we come to
[1:01:34] that place and we begin to learn about
[1:01:37] it. And as he said in Christ, the
[1:01:40] mystery of God revealed. He became us
[1:01:44] that we might become him.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Well, we find ourselves and we see that
[1:01:50] we're battling and we see that we're
[1:01:52] tempted and we see that the flesh wars
[1:01:55] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:01:57] against the flesh. And these two are
[1:02:00] contrarian and and we know who we really
[1:02:03] are and we know all the weaknesses that
[1:02:06] we have and and we don't perceive
[1:02:10] ourselves
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; as being like him.
[1:02:14] But then he speaks these words. It's
[1:02:17] given to the overcomer.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And then he comes
[1:02:21] back and preaches to us. The seed has
[1:02:24] the power to transform.
[1:02:27] So you are the children
[1:02:30] of the of the words that were spoken in
[1:02:34] our day.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; So if I I don't know how I could just
[1:02:39] express this the way that I would really
[1:02:42] love to express it, but there's
[1:02:46] the message we have for our day. It
[1:02:49] wouldn't work in any other age.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; You you understand? And so we're not
[1:02:55] preaching the gospel of another age.
[1:02:59] We're preaching since the seals were
[1:03:01] opened and this became a new book and
[1:03:05] and there was revelation that now could
[1:03:08] come forth in the age that we're living
[1:03:11] in. We are now going to receive prophecy
[1:03:15] that was never prophesied to any other
[1:03:19] age. Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And so we have to understand we that we
[1:03:24] have to be the children of the prophecy
[1:03:28] that is spoken for our day.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And he put you here because you are the
[1:03:34] children of the prophecy that's spoken.
[1:03:38] If I could say it this way, just like he
[1:03:40] said, "Let there be light." He said,
[1:03:42] "There's going to be a bride."
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he makes that statement.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "If he said there would be a
[1:03:52] bride, then she is going to be there."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. What God's wanting us to do is
[1:04:00] believe that.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; You you you understand that that that's
[1:04:07] me.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's me. Like the little boy in the
[1:04:11] mirror. when he saw himself reflected in
[1:04:15] the mirror, he looked and he saw the
[1:04:19] actions and then he looked at that and
[1:04:21] he said, "That's me."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Well, if we could understand that
[1:04:28] prophecy is the mirror
[1:04:33] that you can see
[1:04:36] where you are.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You understand? So can can you look out
[1:04:43] and see that this is perilous times?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Can you look out and see this is the as
[1:04:48] it was in the days as it was in the days
[1:04:50] of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom.
[1:04:54] And you look there and you say that's
[1:04:57] this I see that I see where I'm
[1:05:01] standing. I see what's going on. And
[1:05:04] then you hear the word of God.
[1:05:08] And so it's reflecting to you and then
[1:05:12] you can say that's me. I'm the child of
[1:05:15] that prophecy. I'm living in that age.
[1:05:19] I'm living in that time.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And so you know you're at the end time.
[1:05:25] And then you hear a prophecy like,
[1:05:27] "Behold, before the great and dreadful
[1:05:29] day, I'll send you Elijah the prophet,
[1:05:33] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:05:35] children back to the fathers." And you
[1:05:37] see that you looked and you saw the
[1:05:40] pillar of fire. You heard the voice. You
[1:05:42] saw the works and and you recognize
[1:05:46] that. So you behold I send you, Elijah.
[1:05:51] Well, you're the you.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the child of that prophecy.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I'm that prophecy.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I'm that word.
[1:06:06] Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So you we begin to understand. So we
[1:06:10] have to be start believing I'm that Eve.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I'm that elect lady.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And then but if we if we look at the
[1:06:21] darkness
[1:06:25] then and we look at that then we're not
[1:06:27] looking at the prophecy.
[1:06:30] So we're not the children of sin.
[1:06:33] We're the children of what's spoken of
[1:06:35] us and we understand we'll transform
[1:06:39] into that if we believe it. So I wanted
[1:06:43] to play I I'm going to preach backwards
[1:06:47] this morning.
[1:06:49] I want to play 22 minutes out of the
[1:06:52] message invisible union
[1:06:55] and I want you to hear what the prophet
[1:06:58] of God says about you.
[1:07:03] Okay. What he says about you,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; who you are, where you were, what he
[1:07:10] did,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; and as he speaks these things, I hope in
[1:07:15] your heart you can say, he's speaking of
[1:07:18] me. Now, you you can look at at your
[1:07:25] flesh.
[1:07:27] You can look at your faults.
[1:07:29] You can look at your failures,
[1:07:33] but you don't want to be the children of
[1:07:36] that. I want to be the ch child of what
[1:07:40] he spoke
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; because I know if he spoke it
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm the child of that prophecy. I
[1:07:48] can believe with all my heart that that
[1:07:50] will come to pass in me. I will be an
[1:07:54] overcomer. I can look at the weakness in
[1:07:57] my flesh and say to Satan, "Satan,
[1:08:01] you've been binding me by this. You've
[1:08:03] been waring with me on this. I I have
[1:08:07] all these weaknesses, but the word of
[1:08:10] God said,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be the child of that
[1:08:14] prophecy,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; because it was spoken of me,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and I I am going to fulfill that part of
[1:08:27] what's spoken.
[1:08:31] And that you know I could you could
[1:08:34] every time you say those things our
[1:08:37] minds
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; go to work
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; because that's where the battle is.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. But we God what our faith is what
[1:08:48] God's trying to restore in us is if he
[1:08:51] said it
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; it's true. Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; So, let's just play with this 22
[1:08:59] minutes. It's going to I if some of you
[1:09:02] have computers and phones and and uh
[1:09:05] things that uh you can
[1:09:09] uh read. So, we're going it's I think
[1:09:12] we're going to start at paragraph I
[1:09:15] think it's uh 218.
[1:09:18] Uh,
[1:09:24] is that right, Gary? Where where did I
[1:09:26] what?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; 219.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; 219.
[1:09:30] Oh, paragraph 219. And so he starts go
[1:09:34] this book. Let me give you three book
[1:09:37] messages that I would really recommend
[1:09:41] that you spend a little bit of time
[1:09:44] studying.
[1:09:46] Easter Seal,
[1:09:50] Rising of the Sun,
[1:09:52] and Invisible Union.
[1:09:55] [snorts]
[1:09:56] Those three messages are the description
[1:10:00] of who you are.
[1:10:03] [snorts]
[1:10:04] We [clears throat] Yeah. The acceptance
[1:10:08] of the prophecy
[1:10:12] is so important to the believer.
[1:10:16] It actually gives you something to fight
[1:10:20] your flesh with.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; It gives you something to overcome with.
[1:10:25] It gives you a promise
[1:10:28] that you can use as a sword against your
[1:10:32] enemy. And we know who's the our biggest
[1:10:35] enemy. We are. And our flesh wars
[1:10:39] against our spirit. And they're contrary
[1:10:43] to another. But let me read the first
[1:10:45] statement that he speaks here. He says,
[1:10:48] "The bride knows where she stands."
[1:10:54] And then he says, "She's very few."
[1:10:57] Well, don't count yourself out. Count
[1:10:59] yourself in.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Count yourself in. Let's look at this
[1:11:07] prophecy [snorts] what he's saying and
[1:11:11] let us say that's me.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I believe this. [snorts]
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; I I I accept this.
[1:11:19] You can't look at your circumstance. You
[1:11:22] can't look at any of those things. Could
[1:11:25] you imagine light
[1:11:28] looking at the void and the darkness
[1:11:32] [snorts and laughter]
[1:11:32] and saying I can't overcome that.
[1:11:38] No, he said let there be light and there
[1:11:40] will be light. He and that light came
[1:11:43] out of darkness
[1:11:45] and void. He said let there be a bride
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; and that bride comes out of darkness
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; and void.
[1:11:55] He said, "Let there be a church." She's
[1:11:57] called out of false
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; to truth.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; So the process is the same. God's always
[1:12:05] calls out. He He He reaches out. He
[1:12:09] speaks his word. So So when it says it's
[1:12:12] very few, look around. Look at this
[1:12:15] city. This is very few.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; This is extremely
[1:12:22] few.
[1:12:24] So, every one of you has a place at the
[1:12:28] table. So, and you know, I don't know
[1:12:31] how if our interpreters can keep up. Uh,
[1:12:36] but we just trust that that if you don't
[1:12:39] speak English this morning that somehow
[1:12:41] these words will get to you. But let's
[1:12:44] listen to our messenger,
[1:12:47] a true genuine prophet of God, speaking
[1:12:50] some words of life to us. And this
[1:12:56] morning, he's talking about you and you
[1:13:00] can go back and read. This is some
[1:13:03] wonderful things that we'll hear. So,
[1:13:06] let's just listen to 22 minutes uh right
[1:13:09] now of our our prophet messenger. Thank
[1:13:11] you. extension [snorts] very few. There
[1:13:14] won't be many say just a very very very
[1:13:17] few. You say well they said thousands
[1:13:19] yes but they've come up through the
[1:13:20] 2,000 years too on every age where come
[1:13:23] out every Luther's age and that group
[1:13:25] and then died off and they went
[1:13:27] denominated then Wesley and then come
[1:13:28] Pentecostals and so forth all the little
[1:13:30] out branches of Baptist Presbyterian
[1:13:32] Methodist Nazarine pilgrim holiness and
[1:13:34] so forth. See all those branched off
[1:13:36] from there like these. But you remember
[1:13:38] when it went down and the grain begin to
[1:13:40] ripen that you find that before that
[1:13:42] green can ripen everything in that skull
[1:13:44] has to be dead.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; CAN'T YOU SEE WHERE WE'RE STANDING?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; LIFE IS IN THE GRAIN AGAIN. WHAT IS IT?
[1:13:55] JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE SAME GRAIN that
[1:13:57] went in the ground.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus in the bride form.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Same power. Same church, same thing,
[1:14:05] same word. The same word sucked up
[1:14:07] through these and come out here and come
[1:14:08] to a head here. And all that life had
[1:14:10] come through here, picked up its people.
[1:14:12] Now it's forming up into a head for the
[1:14:13] rapture.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Speaking on that tomorrow night or next
[1:14:16] night when the Lord willing.
[1:14:18] Well, you're separated from your first
[1:14:20] union by spiritual death. Now you are
[1:14:22] born again or remarried again to the new
[1:14:25] spiritual union of not your natural life
[1:14:28] of the things OF THE WORLD, BUT OF
[1:14:30] ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:14:34] That germ that was in you at the
[1:14:36] beginning found bound you. Now your old
[1:14:39] book is gone with your old union. Now
[1:14:43] your name in your old in your has been
[1:14:46] transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean
[1:14:49] to tell me that my old book God put it
[1:14:52] in the sea of his forgetfulness?"
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God. Now your
[1:14:59] name is now in the new book. Not the
[1:15:02] book of life, BUT THE LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:15:04] LIFE.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; WHAT the lamb redeemed, not the old book
[1:15:07] of your natural union, but your new
[1:15:10] bride. HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; YOUR NEW LIFE IS IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:15:15] LIFE. YOUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE.
[1:15:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Where your true eternal germ from the
[1:15:23] BEGINNING TAKES HOLD. NOW YOU'RE NOT
[1:15:25] ONLY FORGIVEN, BUT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; JUSTIFIED. Romans 5:1 said, YEAH. ROMANS
[1:15:36] 5:1 SAYS, "THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED BY
[1:15:38] FAITH," LOOK UP the word.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; THE WORD DON'T mean forgiven.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; The word means justified.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It don't mean you're forgiven. For
[1:15:48] instance, YOU HEARD I GOT DRUNK AND AND
[1:15:50] DONE SOME EVIL THINGS and everything.
[1:15:52] Then you come around and say to me, "You
[1:15:54] found out I didn't do them." Then you
[1:15:55] come around and say, "Brother Ram, I
[1:15:56] forgive you. Forgive me. I didn't do it
[1:16:00] at the first place."
[1:16:03] Now, if I did do IT, I'M GUILTY. BUT YOU
[1:16:05] COULD FORGIVE ME. And I wouldn't be
[1:16:07] guilty, BUT YET I'M NOT JUSTIFIED
[1:16:08] BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DONE IT. BUT THE WORD
[1:16:11] JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL.
[1:16:16] HOW'S IT DONE? IN GOD'S BOOK OF THE SEA
[1:16:19] OF FORGIP
[1:16:22] AND MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED AND DEAD IS NOT
[1:16:24] EVEN IN THE MEMORIES OF GOD.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; You are justified. Therefore, being
[1:16:32] justified, it was accused. YOU WAS
[1:16:33] ACCUSED. YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST
[1:16:35] PLACE. THE OLD UNIONS IN THE SEA OF
[1:16:37] GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. YOU WASN'T MARRIED
[1:16:40] TO IT to begin with. HE, THE BRIDEGROOM,
[1:16:43] BORE YOUR SHAME HIMSELF.
[1:16:46] FOR YOU IN YOUR PLACE. HE took your
[1:16:49] place.
[1:16:51] FOR YOU WERE PREDESTINATED FOR HIM
[1:16:53] [screaming] TO BE IN HIS BRIDE before
[1:16:56] the foundation OF THE WORLD. THE BIBLE
[1:16:57] SAID SO.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; You are THE PREDESTINATED SEED. HOW DID
[1:17:01] YOU COME TO DO THIS? YOU WERE DECEIVED
[1:17:04] INTO IT BY YOUR FIRST MARRIAGE TO YOUR
[1:17:07] ADULTEROUS PARENT, EVE. IT'S NO FAULT OF
[1:17:10] YOUR OWN. BY YOUR NATURAL BIRTH, YOU
[1:17:13] COME AFTER EVE who committed adultery.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's the REASON YOU WAS BORN IN
[1:17:18] ADULTERESS. YOU'RE A SINNER TO BEGIN
[1:17:19] WITH.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. You was deceived into it.
[1:17:23] YOU HAD NO NO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S YOUR
[1:17:25] FAULT. YOU NEVER DID IT BECAUSE THAT
[1:17:27] LITTLE GERM THAT WAS IN YOU WAS TO BE
[1:17:30] YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:17:33] GOD PUT HER NAME IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:17:35] LIFE. LIKE MY LITTLE EAGLE STORY, all of
[1:17:37] you heard it. a h old farmer set a an a
[1:17:41] hen one time. She didn't have enough h
[1:17:44] eggs to go under the hen. So then he
[1:17:46] found an eagle egg and he put it under.
[1:17:47] When the eagle was born is the funniest
[1:17:48] looking chicken them chickens ever seen.
[1:17:51] Little old eagle going along the hen go
[1:17:52] cluck cluck cluck cluck. Little eagle
[1:17:54] said, "I don't know how the thing sounds
[1:17:56] like but I'm following her anyhow." And
[1:17:58] they went out in the barnyard AND BEGIN
[1:18:00] TO SCRATCH THE MANURE PILES. And she
[1:18:02] said, "Cluck cluck cluck. This is good.
[1:18:03] This is good. You join ours." This is
[1:18:05] what
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; now the little eagle, he couldn't eat
[1:18:08] that stuff.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; He just he just went along with the
[1:18:15] chicken because he didn't know. He
[1:18:17] didn't know what to do. And then she
[1:18:20] went out there and she get this and that
[1:18:21] and little eagle just he just had to
[1:18:24] stomach it. But he didn't know how to do
[1:18:26] it, but he seen all the CHICKENS DOING
[1:18:28] IT. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE
[1:18:29] DIDN'T LIKE THAT. So one day the mother
[1:18:31] knowed that she had laid two eggs.
[1:18:36] So she began to hunt for that other one.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Flying around searching like the great
[1:18:41] Holy Spirit.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; One day flew over the barnyard that
[1:18:46] denomination. SHE LOOKED DOWN THERE AND
[1:18:48] SHE SEEN her baby. She screamed.
[1:18:51] It was the voice of something that
[1:18:52] ECHOED FROM THE INSIDE OF HIM. OH, that
[1:18:55] sounds right. Oh, a real predestinated
[1:19:00] born charm predestinated. GOD, HEAR THE
[1:19:04] WORD OF GOD. IT'S MUSIC TO HIM. HE KNOWS
[1:19:06] IT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:19:08] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Start that denominational stuff. Anyhow,
[1:19:12] join us. Come go with us. We got a
[1:19:14] social party. We got this. We got
[1:19:17] It just didn't sound right to the little
[1:19:18] fella. She said, "Son, you don't belong
[1:19:21] in that group anyhow. You belong to me.
[1:19:24] You're mine." He said, "Mama, that
[1:19:25] sounds real. How am I going to get out?"
[1:19:27] Just make a jump. I'll catch you.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do.
[1:19:33] The anointed word of God being
[1:19:35] vindicated before any man that's born to
[1:19:37] be a son of God with the predestinated
[1:19:39] journey into him FOR THIS HOUR. HE'LL
[1:19:41] SEE GOD'S MESSAGE as sure as there's a
[1:19:43] God in heaven.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther saw it for his. Wesley saw
[1:19:47] it for his. The Pentecostal saw it for
[1:19:48] his. Now, what about you?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; They went into denomination. Here's the
[1:19:52] word condemning it. Tell you what we're
[1:19:54] to have today. And just exactly Malachi
[1:19:56] 4 and all these other promises for the
[1:19:57] hour. WHAT DO YOU SEE? WHAT ARE YOU
[1:19:59] LOOKING AT?
[1:20:02] AMEN.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; There we are. THE REAL GENUINE EAGLE'S
[1:20:07] SHIRT.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; MY SHEEP KNOW my voice is strange to not
[1:20:10] follow.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Why? It was put in there by
[1:20:13] predestination. You were for ordained to
[1:20:16] a son of God. YOU WERE IN GOD BEFORE THE
[1:20:18] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU'RE ONLY
[1:20:20] MANIFESTED IN THIS DAY FOR HIS HONOR AND
[1:20:23] GLORY. HOW CAN YOU DO IT WITHOUT
[1:20:24] HONORING HIS WORDS?
[1:20:30] Yes sir.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Which you are a part of that word by
[1:20:34] predestination because look the God is
[1:20:37] the word. You believe it?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; WELL THEN IF HE ALWAYS WAS THE WORD IN
[1:20:41] THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; AND IF THE WORD WAS GOD THEN YOU WERE IN
[1:20:46] GOD.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THE PART THAT YOU'RE TO PLAY
[1:20:50] WAS IN GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:20:52] WORLD.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; He seen you. He knew you. He
[1:20:55] predestinated you to it.
[1:20:57] Now I tell you just as that eagle
[1:20:59] recognized that voice. So does a a real
[1:21:02] BORNAG AGAIN CHRISTIAN RECOGNIZE THE
[1:21:03] VOICE OF God speaking through the word
[1:21:05] when to see it anointed AND A
[1:21:06] VINDICATED. LOOK HE LOOKED UP THERE HE
[1:21:08] DIDN'T SEE THIS OLD HEN CLUCK CLUCK
[1:21:10] AROUND HERE
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; JOINING US AND GO over here and go to
[1:21:12] this and go to this AND THAT. HE SAW A
[1:21:15] BEING LIKE HE WANTED TO BE
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; SAILING IN THE AIR SCREAMING FREE UP IN
[1:21:20] THE HIGHS ABOVE ALL THE CULTURES AND of
[1:21:23] the earth.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HE WANTED TO BE THAT BECAUSE
[1:21:27] IT WAS IN HIM TO BE THAT. AND A MAN
[1:21:29] THAT'S BORN OF GOD IS SON OF GOD HAS TO
[1:21:32] HAVE THE NATURE OF GOD. HE HAS TO BE
[1:21:34] LIKE GOD. HE HONORS GOD. HE'S PART OF
[1:21:37] THE WORD of God.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; In this last DAYS WHEN THIS BRIDE'S
[1:21:42] TAKING FORM JUST EXACTLY THE SAME POWER
[1:21:44] THAT HE WAS IN AT THE BEGINNING, COME UP
[1:21:46] THROUGH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH
[1:21:48] AND COME OUT FOR THE BRIDE. HE CAN'T BE
[1:21:50] NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT.
[1:21:54] They ought to have seen them Jews in
[1:21:56] their days when they seen it manifested
[1:21:57] THERE BEFORE HIM AS A PROPHET SAID HE
[1:21:59] WAS.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Search the scriptures. In them
[1:22:03] you think you HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. THEY
[1:22:04] ARE THEY THAT TESTIFY OF ME.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; IF I DO NOT THE WORKS OF MY FATHER,
[1:22:09] DON'T BELIEVE ME.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; BUT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME, DO
[1:22:11] THEM BELIEVE THE WORKS THAT I'VE DONE."
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; They said, "Our fathers eat man in the
[1:22:15] wilderness for 40 years." WE KNOW WHERE
[1:22:16] WE'RE AT. HE SAID, "And there are
[1:22:18] everyone dead."
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's eternally separated. AMEN.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE DIES. THERE'S ONLY THREE.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Two come out of a million. Two million.
[1:22:29] That's one in a million.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; When a uh an injection,
[1:22:35] the sperm from male and female, there's
[1:22:37] usually one egg fertile. There's one
[1:22:39] egg, one germ that's fertile. If you
[1:22:42] ever seen hybriding and cattle,
[1:22:45] notice there's a a million eggs. There's
[1:22:48] a million germs.
[1:22:51] And when they are discharged to come
[1:22:53] together to the womb, coming through the
[1:22:55] tube and into the womb, they meet. ONE
[1:22:58] OF THEM IS EGGS. A million eggs. A
[1:22:59] MILLION GERMS. THERE'S ONLY ONE EGG IN
[1:23:01] THERE FERTILE. THERE'S ONLY ONE GERM
[1:23:03] FERT ALIVE.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You can watch them little cavs and BEAT
[1:23:09] AROUND THERE. A SPECK THAT YOU CAN PUT
[1:23:10] ON and match THEM. AND DEUS LIM'S
[1:23:12] listening in tonight and he remembers
[1:23:13] when we tuck them. He tucked me down and
[1:23:15] showed me how that worked.
[1:23:18] test tubes and put just the nut that you
[1:23:20] can put on the end of A MATCH. THERE WAS
[1:23:21] THOUSANDS OF LITTLE CAVS AND BULLS in
[1:23:23] there, BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN LIVE.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Only one of them.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And here's a big BALL OF THEM HERE. AND
[1:23:30] YOU'LL notice one will crawl out from
[1:23:31] among this one here, go right over the
[1:23:33] germ, come over here, and egg will come
[1:23:35] out from AMONG THESE OTHER EGGS over
[1:23:36] here. And they'll meet together. AND THE
[1:23:38] REST OF THEM DIE.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; YET THEY'RE ALIVE.
[1:23:43] BUT THEY DIE [screaming]
[1:23:47] BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING SOMEONE MADE
[1:23:49] THIS ONE FERTILE and ordained this one
[1:23:52] too.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's predestination, my brother.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Sir, God has to determine where it's
[1:23:57] going to be boy or girl, redhead,
[1:23:58] blackhead, or whatever it is. IT'S
[1:24:00] DETERMINED BY GOD.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; MORE MYSTERY THAN A VIRGIN birth to me.
[1:24:04] But Lord, the rest OF THEM DIE. THERE
[1:24:06] WERE TWO MILLION PEOPLE COME OUT, SUNG,
[1:24:09] SHOUTED, DONE EVERYTHING, SPOKEN, NOT
[1:24:12] EVER SPOKE IN TONGUES, BUT THEY SHOUTED
[1:24:13] AND AND GIVE GOD GLORY AND DANCED UP AND
[1:24:16] DOWN THE SEA AND DONE EVERYTHING ALL THE
[1:24:18] REST OF THEM DID. BUT THERE WERE ONLY
[1:24:20] two went into the promised land.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Caleb, Caleb and Joshua,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; only two. That's one out of a million.
[1:24:28] It's one out of a million in natural
[1:24:30] birth. Every one of them had the same
[1:24:33] blessing. Oh, you Pentecostals,
[1:24:36] I hope you don't wake up too late.
[1:24:40] ONE OUT OF A MILLION. LOOK, THERE'S
[1:24:42] SUPPOSED TO BE 500 million so-called
[1:24:46] Christians in the WORLD TODAY. IF JESUS
[1:24:49] HAD COME, there'd only be 500 go with
[1:24:51] him. And if that statistic would run
[1:24:53] true, well, there's more than that
[1:24:55] missing every day over the world.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; They know nothing about it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I understand, said the scribes. You know
[1:25:02] that. Why the scribes say that that
[1:25:04] Elias must first come? They said to
[1:25:07] Jesus, he said, "Alias is already come
[1:25:09] and you didn't know it."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; He did just exactly what the scripture
[1:25:13] said to have. So must the son of man
[1:25:16] suffer under. They didn't recognize him.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yet they were all in the church, all
[1:25:20] claimed to be alive. You said, "A real
[1:25:22] bornagain Christian, a real servant of
[1:25:25] God. You're that word of God. He'll come
[1:25:27] right out through every denomination to
[1:25:28] that real fertile ground." what that
[1:25:32] bedding ground. He'll just do it. I
[1:25:34] don't know how he does it. God's
[1:25:35] ordained it to be done. You was deceived
[1:25:38] in the beginning by your first marriage.
[1:25:40] Now you know what's true. Just like I
[1:25:42] said the little eagle. When he heard the
[1:25:45] bridegroom's voice, he went to it. The
[1:25:48] anointed vindicated word of God for THE
[1:25:50] LAST DAYS. NOAH WAS A VINDICATED WORD
[1:25:52] FOR his day. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; WELL, his message won't work today.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Moses was the vindicated word of his
[1:25:59] days. Do you believe that?
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; It won't work for now.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS JOHN WAS THE VINDICATED. YOU
[1:26:05] BELIEVE THAT?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't work in the days of Jesus.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Certainly not.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Law and prophets were until
[1:26:13] John sent in the kingdom of heaven. The
[1:26:15] apostles, them who set forth THE BIBLE.
[1:26:18] HERE COME LUTHER OUT IN REFORMATION. His
[1:26:20] words that his church won't work today.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Wesley's won't.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals won't. They worked in their
[1:26:26] day, but it's another day.
[1:26:28] This is the opening of the seven seals.
[1:26:31] I know it sounds strange to you, but God
[1:26:33] has vindicated so perfectly. There's no
[1:26:35] no question in it.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Just perfectly.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I ain't scattering that to the local
[1:26:42] assembly here. I'm speaking to the
[1:26:44] people out across the nation. See, do
[1:26:46] what you wish to. Now, notice the
[1:26:48] anointed word of his days of which you
[1:26:50] are a part by predestination.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You immediately like knew when you
[1:26:57] heard that, YOU KNEW RIGHT QUICK THAT
[1:26:59] you was an eagle.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; You also realized that you wasn't a
[1:27:03] denominational chicken to begin with.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You know there's something wrong there.
[1:27:08] There's something wrong. That's right.
[1:27:11] For you know that you were trapped into
[1:27:13] it at the beginning. He the bridegroom
[1:27:16] took away your shame and put it in a sea
[1:27:19] of forgiveness by the washing of the
[1:27:21] water of the word and the blood of life.
[1:27:25] That's what the Bible said. Your first
[1:27:27] husband that you were married to the
[1:27:29] world, the anointed bridegroom which
[1:27:32] forained you has washed you by the
[1:27:36] washing of the water by the church.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; That don't sound right, does it?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You might find that in the alman, but
[1:27:42] not in God's Bible. by the washing of
[1:27:44] the water by the word and the word
[1:27:47] thing. Father, you are standing
[1:27:50] completely justified as though you never
[1:27:53] did it at the beginning. This is my
[1:27:55] message to the church now as you as we
[1:27:57] go off the air just in a minute. YOU ARE
[1:28:00] STANDING IF you're standing ON GOD'S
[1:28:03] WORD AND WITH GOD'S WORD, EVERY AMEN
[1:28:05] EVER JOT, ever title.
[1:28:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Where are you standing? I'm trying to
[1:28:13] tell you, PULL AWAY FROM THEM SHUCKS AND
[1:28:14] GET OUT here in the wheat
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; before you can get right before the sun.
[1:28:18] I hear the coming of the combine.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You're standing COMPLETE JUSTIFIED LIKE
[1:28:24] YOU NEVER DID IT in the first place.
[1:28:27] HALLELUJAH. TALK ABOUT A THANKSGIVING. I
[1:28:29] feel real good. I'm more thankful for
[1:28:31] that than anything I know of.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:28:38] bride of the son of the living God.
[1:28:40] EVERY MAN AND WOMAN THAT'S BORN OF THE
[1:28:42] SPIRIT OF GOD AND WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF
[1:28:44] JESUS CHRIST AND BELIEVES EVERY WORD OF
[1:28:46] GOD STANDS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER sinned at
[1:28:49] the first place.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; You're perfect.
[1:28:53] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. HOW CAN YOU
[1:28:55] IF A MAN IF I SUPPOSED TO DIE IN THE
[1:28:57] MORNING, A MAN TOOK MY PLACE? I CANNOT
[1:29:00] DIE FOR that sin.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY TOOK MY PLACE.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS THE WORD TOOK MY PLACE. HE
[1:29:08] BECOME ME THAT a sinner THAT I MIGHT
[1:29:10] BECOME HIM THE WORD. AMEN. LET ME HOLD
[1:29:13] TRUE TO IT.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Not the church, the word.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, THAT SPIRITUAL UNION OF CHRIST IN
[1:29:23] HIS CHURCH. NOW, WHEN THE FLESH IS
[1:29:24] becoming word and the word becoming
[1:29:26] flesh,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; MANIFESTED, VINDICATED, JUST WHAT THE
[1:29:30] BIBLE SAID WOULD HAPPEN in this day.
[1:29:32] IT'S HAPPENING
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; DAY BY DAY. WHY IT'S ACCUMULATING SO
[1:29:37] FAST OUT THERE THOSE DESERTS AND THINGS
[1:29:39] TAKING PLACE THAT I COULDN'T EVEN KEEP
[1:29:41] UP WITH IT.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NEAR THE COMING OF JESUS TO BE
[1:29:46] UNITED WITH HIS CHURCH WHERE THE WORD
[1:29:48] BECOMES THE WORD.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Call of the Holy Spirit searching the
[1:29:54] heart.
[1:29:56] You're standing completely. You never
[1:29:58] sinned in the first place. God don't
[1:30:00] even know that IT'S IN THE SEA OF
[1:30:01] FORGIVENESS. You never did it. YOU WERE
[1:30:04] ACCUSED OF IT BY THE ACCUSER, BUT REALLY
[1:30:07] FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU WERE
[1:30:08] PREDESTINATED TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:30:10] OF [screaming] GOD.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STANDING THERE WASHED AND YOUR
[1:30:13] OLD BOOK OF DIVORCEMENT'S PUT AWAY AND
[1:30:16] IT'S DEAD. ABSOLUTELY OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[1:30:19] EVEN IN THE MIND OF GOD,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; PRECIOUS, VIRTUOUS, sinless son of God,
[1:30:32] standing with a pure, unadulterated
[1:30:35] bride, word that he washed by the water
[1:30:38] of his own blood that become flesh and
[1:30:40] manifested that HE MIGHT TAKE YOU which
[1:30:42] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:30:44] father before the beginning AS SAME AS
[1:30:46] HE WAS. HE WAS THAT GREAT ATTRIBUTE OF
[1:30:48] GOD called love.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE, YOU'RE A SERVICE OF
[1:30:53] GOD. WHATEVER GOD WANTS YOU TO DO, WHERE
[1:30:56] YOUR PLACE IS, GOD PLACED IN THE CHURCH.
[1:30:58] SOME APOSTLES, PROPHETS, TEACHERS,
[1:31:00] PASTORS, he placed that by virtue of his
[1:31:03] own predestination.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE THAT TO BEGIN WITH. YOUR
[1:31:08] FIRST WEDDING WAS ANAL. IT WAS YOU NEVER
[1:31:10] DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IF ONLY ONE THING COULD DO
[1:31:14] IT, THAT WOULD BE GOD COME DOWN HIMSELF
[1:31:16] AND TOOK YOUR PLACE
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF THE SON OF GOD, JESUS
[1:31:20] CHRIST, AND WASHED YOU BY THE WATER. THE
[1:31:24] WASHING OF THE WATER BY THE WORD, the
[1:31:27] word, not the denomination.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; THE WORD [screaming] WASHED YOU,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU WON'T STAND IN THE WATER OF
[1:31:36] THE WORD, HOW YOU GOING TO BE WASHED?
[1:31:40] YOU'RE STILL AS SPOTTED AS EVE WAS.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; OH, DEAR DYING LAMB, THY PRECIOUS BLOOD
[1:31:45] SHALL NEVER LOSE ITS POWER. ALL THE
[1:31:48] RANSOM CHURCH OF GOD BE SAVED TO SIN
[1:31:50] ANYMORE. WHAT IS SIN? Sin is unbelief.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; UNBELIEF IN WHAT? THE WORD.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Unbelief in God, which is the word,
[1:31:59] pure, unadulterated.
[1:32:01] OH, HALLELUJAH. LEAVING SOON FOR THE
[1:32:04] SKIES. AMEN.
[1:32:07] Standing ready. Thank your garments
[1:32:09] WASHED FOR THE WATER OF THE BLEEDING
[1:32:12] WORD.
[1:32:13] The word becomes blood.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; The word bled for you and your washed
[1:32:19] and bleeding word. The word bleeding.
[1:32:24] the life of God in the word. And the
[1:32:27] word was bled for you that you might be
[1:32:29] washed from the filth of these uh
[1:32:32] prostitutes
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; and be cleaned and sanctified by the
[1:32:36] washing of the water of the word that
[1:32:38] make your mind and heart stayed on God
[1:32:41] and on his word.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; NOW, HOW YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT GOD
[1:32:44] COMES DOWN AND VINDICATES it
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; and proves you say, "Well, I didn't
[1:32:47] believe it that way." They didn't
[1:32:48] believe it Jesus' way,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; but God proved it. They didn't believe
[1:32:53] it Noah's way. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
[1:32:55] MOSES' WAY. They were willing to take
[1:32:57] Balam's word part. We're all the same.
[1:32:59] So, LET'S JUST ASSOCIATE TOGETHER.
[1:33:01] SEPARATE YOURSELF, the Bible says, from
[1:33:04] unbelief. Hallelujah. Now, NOTICE YOU'RE
[1:33:09] NOT ONLY THAT, but you're going to the
[1:33:11] wedding in the sky and you are wearing
[1:33:14] the wedding band of predestinated
[1:33:17] unmmerited grace.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; A wedding band OF GRACE. AMEN.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; UNMMERITED OF YOUR OWN. GOD DID IT
[1:33:25] HIMSELF.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the
[1:33:27] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[1:33:29] you there.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Put your name on the book. What a
[1:33:31] thanksgiving.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise our God.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; In closing, I might say this. We all
[1:33:39] know that the modern church Pentecostal
[1:33:43] in its present condition, all the
[1:33:44] denominations together, I throw them all
[1:33:46] in one bundle because they are.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; You remember he's going to bundle the
[1:33:50] weeds first and burn them. take the he
[1:33:52] takes all the wheat stalks and burn it
[1:33:54] all up first and they take come to get
[1:33:55] this wheat and takes it home. They're
[1:33:57] all gathering in a bundle bundle of
[1:33:58] Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals all
[1:34:00] going to ecumenical counseling.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. They're all burned. See,
[1:34:04] we all know that the modern church in
[1:34:06] its present condition and its present
[1:34:08] state
[1:34:10] is IN NO CONDITION TO FINISH UP THE
[1:34:12] GREAT COMMISSION THAT GOD GAVE THE
[1:34:15] church for this day.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; How many Pentecostals going to say amen
[1:34:19] to that?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It's in we're on one toness threeness
[1:34:25] this that other fight. One's this
[1:34:27] and one's that and THE OTHER. AND EVERY
[1:34:29] ONE OF THEM afraid to face the word
[1:34:32] right down to their
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; they know you tell them about they say I
[1:34:37] I can't help it. I can't believe that. I
[1:34:38] don't care what he does. I
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; see. See shows what mammy and papy you
[1:34:43] have.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; You might be a state president or
[1:34:46] someday you might be this that the
[1:34:47] other. You better be a son of God.
[1:34:53] Now, we know that the church could not
[1:34:55] the Pentecostal church by no means by no
[1:34:58] means could carry out the last day
[1:35:01] message in its present condition.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Could it? No.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Well, it can't even agree on one or two
[1:35:05] words in the Bible.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; How you going to do it? It can't do it.
[1:35:09] So, you see, denomination's out.
[1:35:12] That's
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; right. It's going to be a elected people
[1:35:16] that's elected for it.
[1:35:28] Did anybody see yourself?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Now that's worth going back and reading.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; You're In other words, you were born in
[1:35:42] sin, shaped in iniquity, came into the
[1:35:44] world speaking lies. that came because
[1:35:47] of the union of your parents. You picked
[1:35:51] that nature up from that thing. But that
[1:35:54] wasn't the real you. That wasn't you.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You were something else.
[1:36:00] [snorts]
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You were you were in God's mind in the
[1:36:03] beginning. You already had the wedding
[1:36:05] band of predestination on your finger.
[1:36:08] You were predestinated
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; to be the son and daughter of God. You
[1:36:14] were predestinated to be the bride.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Now, if you could sit back and say, "I'm
[1:36:19] the child of that prophecy."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; See, that empowers you,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; you still have to fight the fight,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; but now you know you have the bloody
[1:36:40] bleeding word of the lamb. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That you can apply to that nature.
[1:36:47] [snorts]
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Now, one of them's going to have to
[1:36:51] rule,
[1:36:53] [snorts]
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:37:00] it's by what? That we overcome? By
[1:37:03] faith.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:37:08] I believe what he said.
[1:37:11] That's what he wanted to restore back to
[1:37:14] this day. Now you understand that that
[1:37:17] message
[1:37:19] uh
[1:37:22] another message won't work.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; He said it wouldn't fulfill the
[1:37:28] commission of this day.
[1:37:33] what's in the church world, what they're
[1:37:35] preaching, what they're saying, it won't
[1:37:38] fulfill the commission of this day to
[1:37:42] get the bride in the position where she
[1:37:46] belongs, her predestinated state. It
[1:37:49] takes the word. Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; See, what he's trying to do is he's
[1:37:54] trying to reveal to you who you are
[1:37:58] because according to God's plan, he if
[1:38:02] he wants to fulfill a prophecy,
[1:38:06] he's got to predestinate the child of
[1:38:09] that prophecy to be there in order that
[1:38:14] he can use that predestinated seed to be
[1:38:18] the child of the pro prophecy. and
[1:38:20] fulfill it.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; See, the only way you'll ever get
[1:38:30] to quit looking back
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; is to look at the prophecy.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your miserable self.
[1:38:50] It don't matter.
[1:38:52] [snorts]
[1:38:53] What did he say?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; What's prophesied of me? That prophecy
[1:38:59] must come to pass. I believe it. Do you
[1:39:02] see what he said? He said, "Jump.
[1:39:06] I'll catch you. How do I get there? I'm
[1:39:09] in this chicken pen. I'm in this flesh.
[1:39:12] I've got all these problems. I've done
[1:39:14] all these things. I've got all this
[1:39:16] misery.
[1:39:21] old husband,
[1:39:24] old flesh,
[1:39:27] and then someone comes and says, "That's
[1:39:29] not laid to your charge."
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; That's thrown in the sea of God's
[1:39:35] forgetfulness where God doesn't even
[1:39:38] remember it.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I know brother Bram spoke a little bit
[1:39:42] fast in some of these places. It would
[1:39:45] maybe it would behoove me to go back and
[1:39:47] start, you know, just going through
[1:39:49] every bit line by line by line so you
[1:39:52] hear it. But you've got the ability to
[1:39:55] do that.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Go do it.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Do you like it when he says you stand
[1:40:03] completely justified like you never did
[1:40:05] it in the first place?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; He said to the believer that's music to
[1:40:10] his ear.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; But if you keep doubting yourself,
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; and you don't accept your election,
[1:40:20] you don't accept your position, you
[1:40:23] don't accept your place, you don't
[1:40:25] realize that you were put here, he
[1:40:28] planned it through your great
[1:40:29] greatgrandfather, your your grandmother
[1:40:32] and everything. He brought all those
[1:40:34] people all together, all down to time to
[1:40:37] put you here now.
[1:40:43] to put you in a position.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the commission.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; What time is it? It's 11. Is it 11:30?
[1:40:56] 11:39.
[1:40:58] Can I I'll just I'll finish up just here
[1:41:01] in a second.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; There's a bride.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that?
[1:41:11] Now, I can't I can't school that into
[1:41:15] you.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Did you know that the prophet of God
[1:41:20] said it can't be schooled? Only God can
[1:41:24] put that in you.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But I hope
[1:41:31] this morning,
[1:41:33] no matter how little you think of
[1:41:36] yourself,
[1:41:38] that you will think of God's word being
[1:41:42] greater.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; That little germ that was predestinated
[1:41:47] you in you before the foundation of the
[1:41:51] world found you.
[1:41:54] [snorts]
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you can sit there and
[1:41:56] say, "I've done all these things. I've
[1:41:58] I've failed. I in my life, you know what
[1:42:02] I mean? I was involved in relationships
[1:42:04] that were wrong. I used drugs. I drank.
[1:42:08] I did all these things. All that stuff,
[1:42:11] all that muck and mud, right?
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But that little lily seed
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; that was in you before the foundation of
[1:42:20] the world, finally you something in you
[1:42:24] says there's something in me.
[1:42:29] Now that something in you begins to work
[1:42:32] its way up through the mud, through the
[1:42:35] muck, is pushing. It's like the little
[1:42:38] blade of grass under the concrete. It's
[1:42:41] calling. It's drawing.
[1:42:45] That's the whole revelation and thinking
[1:42:47] man's filter. It'll draw you through the
[1:42:50] filter of the word until all THAT STUFF
[1:42:54] IS OFF OF YOU. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; If you lay in the sun, it'll all come
[1:43:01] off of you.
[1:43:03] [snorts]
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; But you've got to believe that seed in
[1:43:08] you has the power in it to transform you
[1:43:13] into what it was predestinated to be.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; God's power to transform.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; God's transforming power.
[1:43:24] All those messages
[1:43:29] are all given to you,
[1:43:34] his bride.
[1:43:38] The restoration
[1:43:40] of Eden,
[1:43:42] back to Eden.
[1:43:46] If we could just start standing up,
[1:43:50] no matter how great our weakness is,
[1:43:53] and start resisting the devil,
[1:43:57] he'll start fleeing.
[1:44:02] But if not,
[1:44:05] why look into the grave you've come out
[1:44:08] of?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I can't do nothing about yesterday,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; but I believe there's a prophecy
[1:44:17] that I'm a child of.
[1:44:23] He said that I'd be spotless
[1:44:26] and perfect and well.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You know, healing
[1:44:34] is a prophecy.
[1:44:36] [snorts]
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You're sick.
[1:44:40] Don't say, "Oh, I don't have cancer. Oh,
[1:44:42] I'm not sick." Prophet of God said,
[1:44:44] "Yeah, you're sick.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; You're sick."
[1:44:49] But it was prophesied
[1:44:52] that I'd be well.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Because by his stripes I was healed.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; So when he when he did his stripes, he
[1:45:04] was saying, "Let there be healing.
[1:45:08] It was prophecy.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; It was telling of a future event.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; You can't be healed unless you're sick.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; But the healing is the future event or
[1:45:22] the condition that this sick body will
[1:45:25] be in.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; So what am I going to do? Look at the
[1:45:29] darkness, the sickness, or am I going to
[1:45:32] look at the prophecy? And he said, "If
[1:45:34] [clears throat] you see the prophecy,
[1:45:36] then you you see a well man
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; and you start walking to it."
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; If you're sin sick,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; then you see a well sinless person
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; and you start walking to it.
[1:45:58] You start washing yourself
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; by the water of the word,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; saying, "I never did this in the first
[1:46:06] place. I was tricked into this. This is
[1:46:09] not my true nature. My name's written on
[1:46:12] the Lamb's book of life. I'm called and
[1:46:15] elected to BE A BRIDE. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:46:17] HAVE A PROPHECY TO PUSH YOU FORWARD.
[1:46:27] You got to understand
[1:46:29] [snorts]
[1:46:31] he knew all that we would be in our
[1:46:33] condition we'd be in.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; But yet by election
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; he chose me.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Paul even said I'm the chiefest of
[1:46:43] sinners.
[1:46:45] Paul,
[1:46:47] but he regarded that he who was in him
[1:46:50] was greater than he who was in the
[1:46:53] world.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to close with this
[1:46:59] for you got put your spiritual thinking
[1:47:02] cap on
[1:47:04] from rising of the sun.
[1:47:08] That's the divine revelation. This is
[1:47:11] paragraph 168.
[1:47:14] That's the divine revelation of the word
[1:47:17] made flesh,
[1:47:20] right? Who do men say that I am? Thou
[1:47:24] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:47:26] God. The revelation,
[1:47:29] the divine revelation that the word was
[1:47:33] made flesh.
[1:47:37] What did we just hear?
[1:47:40] The flesh was made word.
[1:47:43] Now the word has been made flesh,
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; The word that was in you from the
[1:47:53] beginning is now being made flesh.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:48:02] This old thing,
[1:48:05] that little thing in you, that word
[1:48:07] that's in you now is starting to become
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; flesh.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He became you that you might
[1:48:16] beame him.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; It's not this instant
[1:48:21] one wave.
[1:48:27] Okay. So he said divine revelation of
[1:48:30] the word made flesh. If it was flesh in
[1:48:35] the day by the son, the groom,
[1:48:42] it's the flesh today by the bride.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; That's prophecy to me.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And the word cannot fail.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; It will be.
[1:48:59] I've just got to stand up and start
[1:49:01] saying that's me.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That word is going to be made flesh in
[1:49:14] me.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Someone says, "Well, I don't see it."
[1:49:16] Well, that don't matter whether you see
[1:49:18] it. I don't even see it in myself.
[1:49:23] I see the lily pond. I see the muck that
[1:49:27] I'm traveling through.
[1:49:29] But the seed sees the lily
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; that it's going to become. The eagle was
[1:49:36] in the chicken yard eating all kinds of
[1:49:39] stuff.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; But it saw something in the word that it
[1:49:44] wanted to become. That's really what it
[1:49:47] wanted to be. Let me ask you this. Don't
[1:49:50] in your heart, do you really want to be
[1:49:54] the sons and daughters of God?
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; That answer in you is yes.
[1:50:09] Got to have faith in your election.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Because if you look around, that's all
[1:50:15] that Satan wants to do is accuse you.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; It don't matter.
[1:50:27] You say, "Well, I did this yesterday."
[1:50:30] There's blood.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; If you confess it, he's just in faithful
[1:50:37] to forgive it. continue on your journey.
[1:50:41] He said it's made flesh today and the
[1:50:44] bride. See, now listen. See,
[1:50:47] so now he's gonna tie this together.
[1:50:52] He says, see, whoseever sins you remit,
[1:50:57] to them they are remitted.
[1:51:00] Whoseever sins you retain, to them they
[1:51:05] are retained. See that? That was in uh
[1:51:09] Matthew
[1:51:11] the 16th chapter I believe. He he he
[1:51:16] spoke these things. Was it 16:16 or or
[1:51:21] Mark I think. Yeah. You know and the
[1:51:25] scripture says that he breathed on them
[1:51:27] and they received the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:29] Whoseever sins you shall remit they they
[1:51:32] are remitted. And and so he makes this
[1:51:36] statement. Now listen what he says.
[1:51:40] And now the Catholic Church picked that
[1:51:42] up and takes it to their priest. But
[1:51:47] that's carnal.
[1:51:51] Now, Brother Brandham just said, "How
[1:51:54] can I forgive you if I never did it in
[1:51:57] the first place?"
[1:52:00] So the remittance of sin wasn't the
[1:52:03] priest saying, "I forgive you."
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody confessing a sin and
[1:52:12] saying, "I forgive you.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I forgive you.
[1:52:17] Oh, you were I Oh, I was so bad. I done
[1:52:20] this. Okay, I forgive you."
[1:52:24] Well, you know what you're going to do
[1:52:25] with that?
[1:52:27] you're going to sin again.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; So he says that wasn't
[1:52:36] the whose sins you retain
[1:52:40] and whose sins you don't.
[1:52:46] It was he said, "Go into all the world
[1:52:51] and preach the gospel and them that
[1:52:54] believe."
[1:52:56] See if I can find that scripture. I
[1:52:58] don't know.
[1:53:06] I want this that scripture where he
[1:53:07] says, "And he breathed on them and they
[1:53:09] received the Holy Ghost." Is that in
[1:53:12] John? Yeah, I think it's right here. He
[1:53:16] said,
[1:53:23] "No, that's not it." Oh, well.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; What? John 20. Yeah. John 20 and 23.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. That's what it is. Let's
[1:53:39] just read that. Turn there for a second
[1:53:43] with me.
[1:53:53] He said, "And Jesus said unto them,
[1:53:56] peace be unto you. As my father hath
[1:54:00] sent me, so I
[1:54:03] send you."
[1:54:06] Now stay with me here.
[1:54:10] And he and he said this, he breathed on
[1:54:14] them
[1:54:17] on on them, receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:20] Whoseever sins ye remit, they are
[1:54:24] remitted unto them. And whoseever sins
[1:54:27] you retain, they are retained. Now, the
[1:54:31] Catholic Church grabbed that. But that's
[1:54:34] not what it was. Look at what he said.
[1:54:37] Watch. It was the spiritual
[1:54:41] revealed
[1:54:43] word that did it.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; How do you remit sins?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; By the spiritual
[1:54:53] revealed word
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; not forgiven
[1:55:01] but throwed in the sea of God's
[1:55:03] forgetfulness. That's the commission.
[1:55:08] You understand? That's what he said. He
[1:55:11] said that's a commission. Go into all
[1:55:13] the world, baptize him in the name of
[1:55:14] the father, son. Whoseever sins you
[1:55:16] remit. In other words, he said, "Preach
[1:55:19] the gospel. Them that believe shall be
[1:55:21] saved. Them that believe not shall be
[1:55:24] lost."
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; So when the gospel IS, YOU NEVER DID IT
[1:55:29] IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Now that if you believe that,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; you're saved.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, you're lost.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; That's the remittance of sin.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRITUAL revelation of the word.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; HOW do you remit their sins? By
[1:55:56] preaching them the revealed word of the
[1:56:00] hour.
[1:56:02] Yes sir.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Remitted,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; done away with
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; justified.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Throw it in the sea of God for God don't
[1:56:17] even remember it.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you believe that?
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:56:25] Those sins aren't going to haunt you.
[1:56:31] If your past is still haunting you,
[1:56:36] may I pray
[1:56:39] that you get the revelation of the word.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; That's what remits sin.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; That's what wipes the sin out of your
[1:56:55] life.
[1:56:57] That's what lets you know nothing is
[1:56:59] charged
[1:57:01] to God's elect
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; because the seed of God remains in them.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Listen how he ties this in. He says it's
[1:57:10] a spiritual revealed word that did it.
[1:57:14] So here I am in this day.
[1:57:17] I just played you.
[1:57:22] Like I said I preached this backwards. I
[1:57:25] just played you the word
[1:57:28] that remitted your sins.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Did you believe it?
[1:57:45] say that's me
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; that was the rem those whose sins are
[1:57:55] retained.
[1:57:56] In other words, if you don't accept that
[1:57:58] gospel, you are retaining
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; or keeping your sins.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; And if you keep calling yourself a
[1:58:10] sinner,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; you will be a sinner.
[1:58:16] BUT WHY DON'T YOU PROPHESY ABOUT
[1:58:18] YOURSELF
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; and become the children of your own
[1:58:21] prophecy?
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I'M AN OVERCOMER. I'M AN OVERCOME.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Then listen what he says. Ties it
[1:58:32] perfectly together. He says, "Watch
[1:58:35] this. The spiritual revealed word that
[1:58:36] did it." That's the reason he told them
[1:58:39] to go baptize in the name of the father,
[1:58:43] son, holy ghost. He knew they knew who
[1:58:48] he was.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; What did they know? They knew he was the
[1:58:58] sacrifice for their sins.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; He knew they were clean,
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; justified.
[1:59:07] by
[1:59:10] faith.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; It's our faith
[1:59:15] that justifies it.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; It's hard
[1:59:21] when you got a rotten record.
[1:59:25] Because Satan does not want you to let
[1:59:29] go of that record because that's the
[1:59:33] only hold
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; he has on you.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:41] But if you can accept the word [snorts]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; of life,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; what Jesus did
[1:59:54] in his day
[1:59:56] for the Jews,
[1:59:59] God veiling himself
[2:00:02] in the prophet messenger
[2:00:04] did the same things for the Gentiles.
[2:00:09] You just heard him say it.
[2:00:11] Denominational doctrine and teaching
[2:00:13] cannot meet the challenge of this age.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is the revealed
[2:00:26] word to you
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; that remits
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; your sins. Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's by the revelation
[2:00:38] of the word.
[2:00:40] The Catholic priests got a hold of it.
[2:00:43] There's a lot of preachers
[2:00:46] that are still forgiving the sins of
[2:00:49] their people and making them bound to
[2:00:52] them and making you feel guilty. And
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; let's forget that stuff. There's no big
[2:01:00] eyes,
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; little you.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; The same message that set me free sets
[2:01:05] you free.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Do you understand
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; that this message sets you free
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; from the old nature?
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why he tells the story
[2:01:20] about Johnny Crow,
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; the bird that was tied with a string
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; for so long
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; and he kept hearing the gospel fly free.
[2:01:32] We're going south and then a farmer felt
[2:01:36] sorry for him. Cut the string.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; But he was so used of only going so far
[2:01:43] spiritually.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He was only used to going so
[2:01:48] far until the string of the flesh
[2:01:50] grabbed a hold of him. The string of his
[2:01:53] past grabbed a hold of him. The string
[2:01:56] of the memory of all the things that he
[2:01:58] did grabbed a hold of him. HE COULDN'T
[2:02:01] FLOP. HE COULDN'T FLY. HE DIDN'T KNOW HE
[2:02:04] WAS FREE.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Same thing. [crying]
[2:02:15] He's binding us with memory.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; He's binding us with our past. [snorts]
[2:02:22] But the prophecy,
[2:02:28] the prophecy
[2:02:30] said we'd be without spot or wrinkle.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; The prophecy said none of it would be
[2:02:37] late to our charge.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; The prophecy said he paid for it
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; that I could walk into it.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; The commission,
[2:02:56] the commission
[2:02:59] is to go into all the world
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; and tell them
[2:03:05] that their sins have been remitted.
[2:03:13] We've built our faith on the past.
[2:03:17] [snorts]
[2:03:18] Our faith is built because we believe
[2:03:20] Brother Brandham is a prophet. We
[2:03:22] believe he did this. He believed he did
[2:03:25] that. And we look back at the history
[2:03:28] and say, "I believe that."
[2:03:33] That's just like me saying George
[2:03:34] Washington crossed the Delaware.
[2:03:38] Abraham Lincoln.
[2:03:40] [snorts]
[2:03:41] We're not living in the day
[2:03:44] of that prophecy.
[2:03:46] There was children that lived in that
[2:03:48] day. We're living in the day of the
[2:03:51] fulfillment of what he spoke.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; It's not me believing who he was
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; that gives me faith.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; It's me believing what he said. that
[2:04:07] gives me faith.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; If you take those message, if you would
[2:04:15] take this just what we heard this
[2:04:17] morning and you will understand it's the
[2:04:21] revealed word that forgives your sins,
[2:04:25] not penance.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; That was the Catholic priest. That's
[2:04:35] right.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; It's the revealed word. He said it,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; If he said they're forgiven,
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; I believe it. If they He said they were
[2:04:47] in God's forgetfulness, I believe it. If
[2:04:49] he said my name was written on the
[2:04:51] Lamb's book of life, I believe it. If he
[2:04:54] said the wedding band of predestination
[2:04:56] was put on me before the foundation of
[2:04:58] the world and my name was put in a book,
[2:05:01] I believe it. If he said nothing can put
[2:05:04] it on and nothing can take it off, I
[2:05:06] believe it. If he said that I would
[2:05:08] become word, I believe it. If he said I
[2:05:11] can become like he was, I believe it. It
[2:05:14] don't matter where I am. It's the
[2:05:17] prophecy that's spoken of me
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; that I believe.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, richly bless you this morning.
[2:05:24] I'll tell you that ought to make you
[2:05:26] shout.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; That ought to make you happy. Uh if you
[2:05:30] I'd go back and read it again and and
[2:05:33] tell you have say God reveal this to me
[2:05:37] that I am not a chicken
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; and quit looking at your flesh.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; God don't like your flesh anyway.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's why he's giving you a new body.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:00] Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you imagine what we have
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; to bring to people?
[2:06:10] [snorts]
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about bringing
[2:06:13] the fulfillment of all these prophecies.
[2:06:16] You tell people what the prophet of God
[2:06:18] said,
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; they will.
[2:06:22] Oh, he said if that's in him,
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; it's music to his ear. We just read it.
[2:06:29] Every predestinated son that hears the
[2:06:32] message of the hour, they come to life.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Let us move towards the commission.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Let us move to sharing this message. Let
[2:06:44] us move to where we're really trying to
[2:06:46] turn our hearts and where we're trying
[2:06:48] to get our church to be. Not dwelling on
[2:06:52] ourselves,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; but dwelling on the victory of God's
[2:06:56] word. Communion tonight.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; You believe in communion?
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Then make every effort. Everybody that's
[2:07:03] in here
[2:07:05] tonight should come back for communion
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; if you believe God's word.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Sergio is going to share what's
[2:07:16] on his heart with us tonight. Won't be
[2:07:18] long. We'll be right into communion.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; But that's your heritage.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's your testimony.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; I take communion because I believe
[2:07:30] everything the prophet of God said
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; about me. Don't don't don't deprive
[2:07:36] yourself. Don't look at yourself. Look
[2:07:39] at what he said about you.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; If you're not well, then walk in to the
[2:07:46] well man. walk into the son of God that
[2:07:50] was prophesied about you. God bless you.
[2:07:54] Pray for sister Lesie. She's homesick
[2:07:56] and she don't miss church,
[2:07:59] you know, so she's not feeling well. And
[2:08:03] Matthew's uh uh preaching in uh Oklahoma
[2:08:07] and Davey went up with them and [snorts]
[2:08:10] and uh so I don't have any of my family
[2:08:13] here, I think, except for Sharon. And
[2:08:15] she said, "Dad, I'm all alone. I don't
[2:08:17] have none of my family with me. I said,
[2:08:18] "Well, you can sit on the platform with
[2:08:20] me if you want."
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; But do you love him?
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Why do you love him?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz he first loved you.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; When did he love you?
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Before the world was ever formed.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Who are you? I'm the predestinated
[2:08:44] bride of Jesus Christ. Musicians, if you
[2:08:48] would come, God bless you. Brother
[2:08:50] Billy, if you'd lead us in a little
[2:08:51] worship and go forward. You let's stand
[2:08:53] together and and uh let's just have a
[2:08:56] word of prayer. And I'm going to pray
[2:08:59] this prayer.
[2:09:03] And if you agree as I pray, you lift
[2:09:07] your hand to him.
[2:09:10] Our gracious heavenly father,
[2:09:15] the messenger of our age told us to pray
[2:09:18] for revelation.
[2:09:21] That there was nothing greater
[2:09:26] than divine revelation.
[2:09:28] That the church was built not on history
[2:09:33] but on revelation.
[2:09:35] Our prophet of God just spoke to us. He
[2:09:38] said, "I I believe that more than
[2:09:41] anything else."
[2:09:43] I love that revelation,
[2:09:47] Father. The revealed word
[2:09:50] that we were in your thinking
[2:09:54] that you knew me
[2:09:56] before I came here.
[2:09:59] And even though I came here
[2:10:02] in the marriage of my human nature,
[2:10:09] I was trapped into it. I didn't have a
[2:10:11] choice. My mother and father born me and
[2:10:14] I got their human nature and I came into
[2:10:17] the world
[2:10:20] speaking lies.
[2:10:23] But father, you didn't lay that to my
[2:10:26] [music] charge
[2:10:28] because you had already before the world
[2:10:32] begun [music] predestinated me to be a
[2:10:36] son and daughter of God and be a part of
[2:10:38] your bride. You had already prophesied
[2:10:44] that I would be
[2:10:48] [music] part of your body.
[2:10:55] And Lord, I'm raising my hand and
[2:10:58] asking, Father, would you make that such
[2:11:01] a reality to me that I could share it
[2:11:05] with other people?
[2:11:08] that I could preach it, Father, that one
[2:11:11] might hear
[2:11:13] the revealed word of the hour. And they
[2:11:17] would come to the revelation of the word
[2:11:21] and they would realize that all of their
[2:11:26] sins [music] and their record and their
[2:11:28] history and their nature was thrown in
[2:11:32] the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[2:11:34] never to be remembered. [music] and they
[2:11:37] could walk out free. He breathed on them
[2:11:41] and they received the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:44] Father, may we receive your word. The
[2:11:48] Holy Spirit of our hour is a revealed
[2:11:51] word of God. We ask you to bless each
[2:11:55] one. I pray for our young people that
[2:11:59] they could see the world and say,
[2:12:01] "Father,
[2:12:03] I'm not that.
[2:12:05] I'm not I'm not a nightclub person. I'm
[2:12:10] not a ball game person. I'm not a a a
[2:12:14] video game person. I'm not filled with
[2:12:17] lust.
[2:12:19] I'm tempted, Father. But through you, I
[2:12:23] can overcome
[2:12:25] [music]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; and they'll believe. Father, I pray
[2:12:28] that they understand [music]
[2:12:31] that this revealed word was the
[2:12:34] remission of their sins. [music]
[2:12:36] If they believed it,
[2:12:39] we are what we believe. We ask it in
[2:12:43] Jesus' [music] name. Amen.
[2:12:47] Hallelujah.
[2:12:49] Amen. [music]
[2:12:56] The [music] victory

[2:22:57] Almighty God, we thank you for your word
[2:23:00] this morning.
[2:23:03] Father, this is a wonderful word for us.
[2:23:07] We are your children.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; You are the only one who can claim us.
[2:23:13] The enemy has no power. We can say this
[2:23:17] morning that the case has been dismissed
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; for he has not enough evidence to claim
[2:23:25] us.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is here which was left
[2:23:29] with us
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; to witness that we are of God.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; We are going back where we coming from.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Father we thank you for the way this
[2:23:39] morning. Bless our pastor. Give us
