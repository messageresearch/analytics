[41:04] just go the far our gracious Heavenly
[41:07] Father Lord we lift your name on high
[41:09] and Lord we're giving you the praise and
[41:12] the Adoration Lord that we've been able
[41:14] to gather together as a congregation
[41:16] father and to bring our burdens to bring
[41:19] our wants before you Lord and know that
[41:21] you search the hearts you are the one
[41:23] who's walking the aisles and Lord we're
[41:25] giving you the preeminence now we
[41:27] surrender ourselves father ourselves as
[41:29] a man we can not meet the needs of your
[41:31] people Lord and though we would even
[41:33] desire to do so father our efforts will
[41:35] fail but Lord your word has never failed
[41:38] and Lord one word spoken and season and
[41:41] anointed father could be the Deliverance
[41:43] could be the healing could be the peace
[41:45] could be the Comfort father Your Truth
[41:48] sets free Lord so we're surrendering
[41:50] ourselves to you asking Lord that just
[41:54] any hindrance father we bind it in the
[41:56] mighty name of Jesus Jesus Christ we
[41:58] commit it to you in the precious name of
[42:00] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[42:03] amen if you would take your Bibles and
[42:06] turn with me to First
[42:08] John going to take a thought and uh what
[42:13] we been on our heart in the sermon that
[42:16] we uh were inspired to go to draw our
[42:20] inspiration from is the presence of God
[42:24] unrecognized and uh it the as you're
[42:29] turning there what I would my challenge
[42:30] to you would be is is that um put
[42:33] yourself on the right side of the word
[42:36] as the word would come the same word
[42:39] that blinds the eyes of some opens the
[42:42] eyes of others and we want to find the
[42:47] way the word is identifying us as
[42:49] Believers and and take it in the
[42:51] positive in first John it says that
[42:53] which from the beginning which we have
[42:56] heard which we have seen with our eyes
[42:58] which we have looked upon and our hands
[43:01] have handled of the word of life for the
[43:04] life was manifested and we have seen it
[43:07] and bear witness and show unto you that
[43:09] eternal life which was with the father
[43:13] and was manifested unto us we ask the
[43:16] Lord just bless his word you may be
[43:24] seated the so appreciated the prayers
[43:27] and just in the opening of the service
[43:30] and the
[43:31] testimonies and I just uh gave me
[43:34] encouragement what I what I feel is uh a
[43:38] cause and effect of you having a
[43:41] personal identity with Christ with the
[43:43] word that you could testify that my eyes
[43:47] have seen my hands have handled is that
[43:51] that is the faith to Faith that is at
[43:54] work within the body so We've Come
[43:57] Together as Believers and we there
[43:59] should be a confidence that in the
[44:02] effect of each one bringing their lick
[44:04] of fire and bringing their faith and
[44:06] coming into the house of the Lord that
[44:08] here great things can happen it's in the
[44:12] congregation of the Saints and the
[44:13] congregation of the Believers where
[44:16] Miracles take place and it's because
[44:19] your hearing and the faith of God that
[44:23] is within you is the strong hands that
[44:25] handle the word of God you take a sword
[44:29] you take a weapon you put it in the
[44:30] hands of the unskilled they can't do
[44:32] anything with it but you take the word
[44:34] of God you put it in a Believer who's
[44:37] been given the faith to believe with and
[44:39] great things can be
[44:41] accomplished okay so when we come our
[44:43] expectation that we're coming we're
[44:45] encouraged to see each one that's
[44:47] gathered themselves into the house of
[44:49] the Lord and even to the effect that as
[44:52] we as We Gather there's if you're
[44:55] Discerning the needs within the body
[44:57] body there's going to be something maybe
[44:59] a burden maybe a need you enter into
[45:01] prayer but this is a House of Prayer so
[45:03] when you come you're coming with a mind
[45:05] that is seeking to understand what the
[45:08] needs are in the body and and you're
[45:11] wanting to enter into a mindset where
[45:13] you can start to pull and ask that the
[45:15] word of God would come and meet the
[45:17] needs within the body now all of that is
[45:20] all effectual because you are
[45:23] believers okay if if there's a an
[45:26] atmosphere of doubt in an atmosphere of
[45:29] unbelief then you know we even see the
[45:32] example within Jesus Christ himself
[45:34] things could not uh be done or he was
[45:37] with without honor in his own Hometown
[45:41] and we don't want to we don't want our
[45:42] church to become so common to us that
[45:45] when Jesus Christ is present we can't
[45:48] welcome him in to do the things he wants
[45:51] to do we shouldn't have to go somewhere
[45:54] else to get out of town so that God
[45:57] could have his
[45:58] way and and if it if that's that is now
[46:03] he's the same yesterday today and
[46:05] forever he hasn't
[46:07] changed he he's he's the he's the same
[46:10] loving savior that would sit there with
[46:12] je with dirty feet and and and will
[46:16] allow his feet to be washed with tears
[46:19] and and if that's your approach if
[46:21] that's the way you want to seek him he's
[46:23] there what often we fail to do is get
[46:26] ourselves in the right desperation and
[46:29] the right mindset to recognize really
[46:31] what's at stake and what can be gained
[46:33] and the opportunity that's present is
[46:36] that we're in the presence of almighty
[46:38] God and and we don't just base that as
[46:41] some would on an anointing on an outward
[46:44] uh manifestation but we have a thus
[46:46] sayith the Lord declaration that he's
[46:49] here it's so
[46:51] beyond I any other fallacy that man
[46:56] would rest in that's temporal but we
[46:58] know he's here because his word has been
[47:00] made manifest to us in this day now if
[47:03] you would say uh I how do how do we so
[47:09] Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[47:10] word of God when you testify to what
[47:14] God's done for you that puts Something
[47:16] In Motion within the body as the joint
[47:19] each joint to the other supplies the
[47:21] needs of the other there should be a
[47:23] testimony when you come into the house
[47:25] of God there should be a testimony on
[47:27] your lips uh in your heart in the
[47:30] atmosphere and in the expectation that
[47:32] you have even if it's not spoken there
[47:35] is a testimony that you are carrying
[47:38] into the house of God it's going to be
[47:40] evident upon your face it's going to be
[47:42] evident upon your heart it's going to be
[47:44] evident upon the way you start to enter
[47:46] into the service into the mind that you
[47:49] have that's your
[47:50] testimony it's May could may be a
[47:52] testimony of I didn't come expecting
[47:55] much I it could be testimony of uh I'm
[47:59] tired I'm hurt I'm distracted but you're
[48:03] here okay but you're here and and that
[48:08] if that's the title if I was to give it
[48:10] one is you're here all right
[48:13] so you if we could just recognize where
[48:17] we're
[48:18] at and and and not only just now and in
[48:21] this moment and the opportunity that's
[48:23] present to you but I believe that in
[48:25] this age a prophet came and he told us
[48:27] exactly where we're at I we can stand
[48:31] with the confidence knowing where we are
[48:33] at so when he describes things that says
[48:36] it ought to be it ought to be it ought
[48:39] to be we're not taking that as
[48:41] condemnation and saying oh it's not it
[48:45] is we're here because in his presence
[48:49] all things are
[48:50] possible it ought to be that when we
[48:52] come together as a a body of Believers
[48:55] that the sick are healed the blinded
[48:57] eyes are open and it is because we're
[49:00] here because he's
[49:02] present and and and and as I said at the
[49:06] start of the service we're approaching
[49:07] this as Believers so where there's two
[49:09] or three and if I could get one other
[49:13] believer two can put 10,000 to fight if
[49:17] one other believer came with a
[49:19] desperation that's a you I didn't just
[49:21] come to have church I didn't come to be
[49:23] an obligation but I need a living God
[49:27] amen that's right a God that changes the
[49:32] scene you know it it it's everything
[49:35] testifies to the contrary the
[49:36] foolishness of preaching is absolutely
[49:41] amazing it's absolutely amazing but it's
[49:45] in that that God will push an atmosphere
[49:49] it will drive the enemy out and you sit
[49:51] with a perfect opportunity to take God
[49:53] at his word
[49:56] yes
[49:58] Hallelujah and that's because he does it
[50:01] that
[50:02] way he chose to do it that way he chose
[50:05] the things that are foolishness to
[50:07] confound the wise because I could
[50:09] because really in all reality you could
[50:11] take this academically AI is amazing now
[50:14] you could uh you could go get a sermon
[50:17] better than I could preach you
[50:19] one you could go Google it up ask your
[50:23] topic it it and it just it's going to be
[50:26] a stillborn baby it's going to be
[50:29] academic but there's an anointing that
[50:31] comes on the word of God because we're
[50:34] the children of God okay and the seed
[50:37] can't bite alone you as a Son of God
[50:40] holding on to the word of God cannot not
[50:42] be
[50:45] anointed I don't know if the double
[50:47] negative work there or
[50:48] not but it's he abides and Broods out
[50:53] over his word so if you want to even if
[50:56] you don't feel them and if you don't
[50:58] know him to be present if the word is
[51:02] there he's there because just like there
[51:05] was seeds that were in the earth sewn in
[51:07] the earth and were present he said that
[51:10] just as he he he deals with the
[51:12] individual the same way he dealt with
[51:13] the Earth he said the Holy Spirit
[51:15] brooded out over the Earth to bring to
[51:18] life the seeds that were already there
[51:21] so if the seed is there the holy
[51:23] spirit's job is to brood out over the
[51:25] word and bring it to maturity amen so I
[51:28] if if you want to see an effect uh take
[51:31] God at his word and whether you
[51:34] recognize him in a in in some uh Earthly
[51:38] manifestation he's there
[51:41] working now um I don't know how we're
[51:45] going to minister this you just pray for
[51:47] me and ask the Lord to be faithful to
[51:49] walk us through this but um one of the
[51:52] things that you have to
[51:54] recognize is just like the woman that
[51:57] would have the blood issue there had to
[51:59] be a challenge or a predicament or a
[52:01] place of desperation that would put her
[52:04] in a place for her to take advantage of
[52:08] the presence of God so we often times
[52:11] will take it the very evidence that God
[52:13] can do something is the very thing that
[52:16] the devil is trying to use to tell you
[52:18] that you're
[52:19] hopeless it's to it's to tell you that
[52:22] it's not possible and when you start
[52:24] recognizing that that is the very thing
[52:27] that the presence of God comes to
[52:29] address then you start to recognize all
[52:31] things are
[52:32] possible so whatever it is in your life
[52:35] that you have that you think is
[52:37] impossible that you think is ridiculous
[52:39] our God is the god of the
[52:41] impossible we we're not we're not here
[52:44] merely to accomplish the things that man
[52:46] could accomplish I'm sure that some some
[52:49] of you could leave here and turn a new
[52:50] Leaf you could have a new uh
[52:52] determination to do better and you may
[52:54] even be able to accomplish those things
[52:57] out of a discipline for a season um I've
[53:00] my life and my testimony I'm I I could
[53:02] go back through the track record it's
[53:04] full of those
[53:05] failures there's the David McGary
[53:09] tried David McGary got jailhouse
[53:12] religion David McGary did a lot of
[53:14] things but then Jesus came and then all
[53:18] those things that I did after the
[53:20] natural he did
[53:22] supernaturally so we're not testifying
[53:24] to a god that just does things that man
[53:27] can do and God helps those who can help
[53:30] themselves and you just need to yield
[53:32] Your Vessel uh in a way that really is
[53:35] just you making more effort but we're
[53:38] saying let God come and change the very
[53:40] fabric of your life and if and that's
[53:43] the desperation that I believe is
[53:45] present in God's children yes sir that's
[53:48] the that is in this sermon if you would
[53:50] go and I you could find it when you get
[53:53] someone's heart that is desperate for
[53:56] God there is nothing that's going to
[53:57] stop
[53:58] it nothing it it you could you could try
[54:02] to point to the Creed and say well it's
[54:03] not that way you God doesn't do it that
[54:07] way you're you're you could you could be
[54:09] challenged with well you're going to be
[54:11] put out of Fellowship you know brother
[54:13] brandom goes through and he starts
[54:14] saying these are all the religious
[54:16] spirits that she's pressing through to
[54:18] get to Jesus Christ but because her
[54:21] heart was
[54:22] convinced that in his presence there was
[54:25] an answer
[54:27] Hallelujah nothing could stop it and
[54:29] that's
[54:31] faith and that faith comes by testimony
[54:35] when you take a look at the at the Queen
[54:37] of Sheba she's down south she's I
[54:41] believe three months away and they don't
[54:44] have radio and they don't have
[54:46] television so I got to tell you there's
[54:48] a testimony we're going to hear when we
[54:50] get over Yonder of somebody some
[54:53] somebody was on the road test Tes ifying
[54:57] of to the things that were being done in
[54:59] the house of God in Solomon's
[55:03] Temple there's a wisdom that's beyond
[55:06] the wisdom of man and there's got to be
[55:08] somebody who has on their lips and in
[55:10] their life in my life I've seen
[55:14] him he he's changed the scene I was sick
[55:18] I'm Healed I I woke up this morning I
[55:21] didn't think I could have enough
[55:22] strength to get out of bed my my spirit
[55:24] was from me I was depressed ressed but I
[55:27] just committed myself to God and he gave
[55:29] me the strength as I was talking and
[55:32] meditating someone called and gave me a
[55:34] scripture it was the very scripture I
[55:35] was thinking on he does little things to
[55:38] assure you that he's with you and he's
[55:41] doing it all the time all the time and
[55:45] that's got to provoke such a love in
[55:47] your life for him that you're no longer
[55:49] going to stay and hold it and B bottle
[55:52] it all in but you're going to cause a
[55:54] Queen of Sheba testimony
[55:57] you're going to start going on the road
[55:58] and say the things which we've heard and
[56:01] then that you got to recognize The
[56:03] Thirst that that provokes now where
[56:05] you're at may be on the
[56:07] road you may have heard the
[56:10] testimony and it could be I'm
[56:14] desperate I've heard that he changes
[56:16] hearts and he changes minds and he takes
[56:19] your old desires and makes some new
[56:20] desires you could be hungering and
[56:22] thirsting for a new birth
[56:24] experience and it's it's real and it's
[56:26] for you and you're
[56:29] here he's here to give it to
[56:37] you and 1 John 3:20 says he is greater
[56:41] than our hearts and knoweth all
[56:43] things so he's he's he's the he is the
[56:47] high priest he is the one who knows
[56:49] what's on your heart and because he knew
[56:53] it you know we've got a we've got the
[56:55] opportunity in this day to really
[56:57] understand the mind of God you know
[56:59] that's what one of the things Satan
[57:00] really hates is that we boast in knowing
[57:03] the very heartbeat intent of God that
[57:06] before the foundation of the world the
[57:08] lamb was slain and that he had already
[57:11] made provision to manifest his
[57:13] attributes to you but in order to
[57:16] manifest those attributes the
[57:17] desperation had to come you had to be
[57:21] sick that you could be healed our pastor
[57:22] tells the testimony of wanting to
[57:24] experience God as a Healer
[57:26] and not realizing and thinking that
[57:28] thought process
[57:30] through that he would have to have
[57:33] something wrong that needed to be healed
[57:35] he had a board come up rip his arm break
[57:38] his thumb it was it was mangled and it
[57:42] was in a service where he started to
[57:45] raise his hands and praise the Lord and
[57:48] he recognized he had been
[57:50] healed and when you may not even be
[57:54] uh aware
[57:57] that he's already moving to meet the
[58:03] need but
[58:05] that's he knew you you know he's a
[58:08] father a sister sent a song to me I
[58:10] listen to it and I one of the lyrics I
[58:13] got I I thought it said uh do you know
[58:16] my dad and that inspired me I was like
[58:19] do you know my dad that's right well it
[58:21] was saying do you know my God and I got
[58:23] it
[58:24] wrong but
[58:27] the confidence we should have and the
[58:30] boldness we should have is one where we
[58:32] should be able to think what a father is
[58:34] to us true okay and a father knows what
[58:38] you have need of before you even ask for
[58:42] it he's already sees the need in your
[58:44] life he already knows what you don't
[58:46] know you need and he is going to do what
[58:49] he needs to do to minister to the need
[58:52] as a father would do it we had a a
[58:56] brother visiting us a brother Aaron
[58:58] Palmer and he has some young children
[59:01] and me and Julia were enjoying them and
[59:03] we're just spoiling them rotten and as
[59:05] you spoil a
[59:07] kid they typically you know end up
[59:10] wanting their way you know so then when
[59:13] they get told to do something it's like
[59:15] but don't I get what I
[59:17] want and uh brother Aaron said something
[59:20] to the effect of you know you you're not
[59:24] making a good parent
[59:27] you know and it and it and it just it it
[59:30] struck me because there's a lesson in
[59:32] that as a father and with a Father's
[59:35] Eyes the love that he has for us is one
[59:40] that he's interested in your character
[59:43] true he's interested in the final result
[59:46] and if something just becomes
[59:48] easy and it's just microwave
[59:52] religion then it's not getting the
[59:55] result
[59:56] that he's after and and what what you
[1:00:00] have to realize is he'll purchase the
[1:00:02] field to get the treasure in the field
[1:00:05] so he'll he'll send out a a a blessing
[1:00:09] and and bless
[1:00:10] everyone just to bless you he'll buy
[1:00:14] everybody in the family A gift to get
[1:00:16] you the
[1:00:18] gift okay fathers hide favorites all
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:24] so it there's going to be what God does
[1:00:27] and he's that way he he absolutely does
[1:00:31] things that really all he really cares
[1:00:34] about is that he got it for
[1:00:36] you and when and when we talk about the
[1:00:39] blessings of God it it you got to
[1:00:42] recognize that their rock is not our
[1:00:45] Rock okay where we have placed our
[1:00:48] confidence in is not where other people
[1:00:50] have placed their confidence in so when
[1:00:52] the blessings of God come we want to
[1:00:55] take those in Channel them right back
[1:00:56] into the word of God knowing that Lord I
[1:00:58] want this to accomplish what you desire
[1:01:01] for it to accomplish in
[1:01:03] me so there's a there is a and that is
[1:01:06] not we I say that to people who that is
[1:01:10] their heart's desire I believe that
[1:01:13] absolutely but you you can't let the
[1:01:16] counterfeit or the
[1:01:17] Scarecrow that Ma that uh cause you to
[1:01:20] think that that's the final result yeah
[1:01:23] exactly because the final result there
[1:01:25] there is one where they're blessed in
[1:01:28] the house of God today and they're in
[1:01:29] the bar on Monday come on and and if
[1:01:33] God's going to have take a a joy and a
[1:01:36] pride in anybody it's going to be his
[1:01:39] children but the blessing is also ours
[1:01:43] amen um the uh and what I what I want
[1:01:47] you to understand is is uh he loves you
[1:01:50] enough to put you in a
[1:01:52] pinch okay he loves you enough to put
[1:01:55] you in a place where he can show His
[1:02:00] blessings and you wouldn't if you could
[1:02:02] know the end of the
[1:02:04] story um it should give you a peace and
[1:02:08] and uh I you know what let's let's just
[1:02:11] take a look at Revelations
[1:02:14] 19:7 Revelations 197 would say let us be
[1:02:18] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:02:21] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:02:23] his wife hath made herself self ready so
[1:02:27] the hour and where we're at is
[1:02:30] here this is the hour that we're in
[1:02:33] we're not in another age we're not in
[1:02:35] another day we're not in a waiting but
[1:02:37] the lamb has been declared present here
[1:02:40] with us the bridegroom is here taking a
[1:02:43] bride now what is the disposition of the
[1:02:46] Bride let us be sad and for
[1:02:51] longing and not praise
[1:02:54] him because we've got to do a lot of
[1:02:57] work
[1:02:59] because weddings are a lot of
[1:03:04] work work till Jesus comes we're going
[1:03:09] to work but there's a joy that is in the
[1:03:13] the hearts of the believer at is
[1:03:15] appearing and that it the devil wants to
[1:03:19] take your joy when you recognize you
[1:03:21] have an enemy when you recognize he
[1:03:23] hates the continence of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] on your life he doesn't want to see a
[1:03:28] believer that has the joy of the Lord in
[1:03:29] their life and he's going to try to rob
[1:03:31] it from you you have to withstand the
[1:03:34] enemy recognize his tricks and say
[1:03:37] you're
[1:03:38] exposed I cannot be sad when the when
[1:03:41] the lamb is with me if I have the
[1:03:44] bridegroom how could I be sad I have a
[1:03:47] right to call those things that are as
[1:03:50] those they are not I am not living for
[1:03:52] this life I'm not living for this world
[1:03:55] and I have a more sure promise than
[1:03:59] anything this world could offer
[1:04:01] me and so the this world can't take that
[1:04:04] Joy no it it can't and it it's it's uh
[1:04:10] the peace of God is really astounding
[1:04:14] and it just as a way of testimony as a
[1:04:16] young believer I remember sitting in a
[1:04:19] room with a bunch of people getting laid
[1:04:20] off in the groups of 30s it was 30
[1:04:24] people sitting in a room and I'm just
[1:04:27] giddy yeah I'm
[1:04:30] smiling and I I wasn't trying to be
[1:04:32] disrespectful I really wasn't it was my
[1:04:34] genuine continence and it was
[1:04:38] because I was amazed that God was going
[1:04:41] to do something that was better than
[1:04:42] where I was
[1:04:46] at I
[1:04:48] recognized good and it wasn't that
[1:04:50] wasn't me I knew where I was standing
[1:04:54] yeah come on I knew where I was at I was
[1:04:57] a Son of God I wasn't worried about
[1:05:02] tomorrow I knew who held it and you're
[1:05:05] in his hand you have to look and say I'm
[1:05:08] here are you out of his
[1:05:10] hand you're in his
[1:05:13] hand I'm here I'm
[1:05:16] breathing is is my heart
[1:05:18] beaten I'm here and you're in the
[1:05:21] presence of God you're in the presence
[1:05:23] of almighty God all things are
[1:05:27] possible and it is when we come to the
[1:05:31] recognition of his presence that our
[1:05:34] faith is the
[1:05:36] highest okay he's no less
[1:05:40] God but when we come to a recognition of
[1:05:43] his presence our faith Rises because it
[1:05:47] we have such a confidence in his love
[1:05:49] for us that when you're in his presence
[1:05:51] you know all things are just fine you're
[1:05:54] under the wings of the eagle so what we
[1:05:58] what the it's a formula you want your
[1:06:01] faith to rise pray through until you're
[1:06:04] in his presence till you're aware of his
[1:06:06] presence because in that atmosphere you
[1:06:09] can ask in faith you can ask believing
[1:06:13] and what we would do better in all all
[1:06:16] of our Lives is to do the things that so
[1:06:19] our hearts doesn't condemn us so we can
[1:06:22] stay more aware that his presence is
[1:06:24] Abiding and Bre in out over you you know
[1:06:27] he's there if our eyes would be opened
[1:06:29] we would see the Angels encamped about
[1:06:31] those who fear
[1:06:32] Him right there would be a there would
[1:06:36] be a boldness that we could have if our
[1:06:39] eyes became opened into the spiritual
[1:06:41] but without faith it's impossible to
[1:06:44] please God so God didn't do this in such
[1:06:47] a way that he doesn't get any pleasure
[1:06:49] in it that you would just see the the
[1:06:52] handwriting on the wall and you would
[1:06:54] know thus sayith the Lord this is
[1:06:56] empirical evidence can you guys see that
[1:06:58] I see that it
[1:07:00] says uh you know go get a wife and her
[1:07:04] name is and it's and it's written on the
[1:07:07] wall and now I no longer need
[1:07:10] faith I no longer now to know that he
[1:07:13] knows my heart's desires and he knows
[1:07:16] what I have need of and he
[1:07:18] knows and cares I'm just going to take a
[1:07:22] dead approach to
[1:07:26] God's will in my
[1:07:27] life but no he takes his word and he and
[1:07:32] he speaks it to you and there's a
[1:07:35] there's something in your heart that
[1:07:36] says I believe that that's the truth I
[1:07:41] see that and it and then we don't want
[1:07:44] to just leave it as a recognized word we
[1:07:47] want to take it and possess it we want
[1:07:50] to make it our own you know it it
[1:07:52] wouldn't be uh you know uh
[1:07:55] Moses saying that is a burning bush and
[1:07:59] just acknowledging it but there comes a
[1:08:02] point where you have to come in the
[1:08:03] presence of the very thing that you're
[1:08:05] acknowledging that's the
[1:08:07] difference right is it's not just that
[1:08:11] we've seen but our hands have handled
[1:08:14] there there has to be just in the Old
[1:08:16] Testament when you look at the the lamb
[1:08:18] and the and the sacrifice there was no
[1:08:20] way for the believer not to become
[1:08:22] intimate with the
[1:08:24] sacrifice if it was a bloody
[1:08:27] mess and it and there and it was an
[1:08:29] impression that would be left upon the
[1:08:32] believer and understanding that this
[1:08:34] animal has laid its life down for me and
[1:08:38] there is an effect of coming in the
[1:08:39] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ where
[1:08:41] there's a complete recognition of his
[1:08:44] love for you and what he accomplished at
[1:08:47] Calvary and otherwise what you've come
[1:08:49] in contact with is just a general
[1:08:51] outpouring and an anointing and it's
[1:08:53] there but when you come in contact with
[1:08:55] the Sovereign presence of God there is
[1:08:58] no other way to feel but
[1:09:01] guilty and humble that's right and
[1:09:04] you're thankful that he loves you and
[1:09:07] the blood was shed for
[1:09:08] you because it's the same Grace that
[1:09:11] teaches the Heart To Fear the same Grace
[1:09:14] the fears
[1:09:16] relieved and there it it's a it's a
[1:09:18] miraculous thing that the holy presence
[1:09:21] of An Almighty God would come amongst
[1:09:23] the
[1:09:24] people and when he
[1:09:28] does all things are
[1:09:31] possible and what we want to be
[1:09:33] testifying in our lives is that he's
[1:09:35] here that he's present and I know it I
[1:09:40] mean the
[1:09:42] uh the effect of that is life to those
[1:09:47] around
[1:09:50] you it's that is the that is the word of
[1:09:54] life you know when you when you when we
[1:09:56] talk about the word of life it was a
[1:09:58] testimony that was going to the Queen of
[1:10:00] Sheba and that was the word of God to
[1:10:03] her a testimony of the things that were
[1:10:06] being done was the word of God because
[1:10:10] it was it being spoken out through a
[1:10:12] lived out life and you are Epistles read
[1:10:16] of all
[1:10:18] men so I I if I just to bring it
[1:10:22] home your life is the very presence of
[1:10:26] God that's deity dwelling in
[1:10:30] flesh and you should be in expectation
[1:10:33] of great
[1:10:36] things and and it's it's it's that leap
[1:10:39] and that action of faith and having a
[1:10:42] confidence in what the word of God has
[1:10:44] said about you and I trust that we know
[1:10:45] these things what the word of God has
[1:10:47] told us we ought to be and and not only
[1:10:50] in our conduct in a Sanctified life we
[1:10:53] could go down the line and we can preach
[1:10:55] these things not ought to be there and
[1:10:57] we could we could say yes Lord I'm
[1:10:59] taking you at your word do a cleansing
[1:11:01] work cut this from my life but I'm also
[1:11:03] talking about for the faith and
[1:11:05] believing for others for the our lost
[1:11:07] loved ones for the healing that needs to
[1:11:09] be manifested in our body you know
[1:11:12] there's there's physical needs there's
[1:11:14] healing that needs to be uh provided and
[1:11:17] it could be your testimony of what God's
[1:11:19] done for you that causes the faith to
[1:11:22] rise up in someone else and say
[1:11:24] absolutely I believe it if you did it
[1:11:27] for them you could do it for me it's the
[1:11:28] Hatty right it's the it's that
[1:11:31] opportunity when the presence of the
[1:11:33] Lord comes in on just the a spoken
[1:11:35] testimony that great things can
[1:11:38] transpire and and we see that I anytime
[1:11:43] Believers come together that the the
[1:11:45] body ministers to the needs that are
[1:11:48] present he dwells in his word and his
[1:11:51] words and his word comes into your heart
[1:11:54] and speaks it self out and declare he
[1:11:57] interprets his own word through you he's
[1:12:00] trying to find somebody he can get a
[1:12:03] hold of to show that he is still God he
[1:12:07] is he will do that if he can just get
[1:12:10] somebody he can speak to if he can get
[1:12:14] another woman with a blood
[1:12:17] issue he can still speak the same thing
[1:12:21] he can still do the same thing making
[1:12:23] known declaring were in the presence of
[1:12:28] God and
[1:12:30] it we don't want to sometimes be the one
[1:12:33] that has the
[1:12:38] burden but she was put into
[1:12:43] motion she had heard a
[1:12:46] testimony of a woman whose sins had been
[1:12:49] forgiven
[1:12:50] her and she knew that if she could
[1:12:53] get to the the man who did that for her
[1:12:58] then she could be touched
[1:13:01] also and
[1:13:03] we it we don't have another way Saints
[1:13:06] he's either alive and living in the body
[1:13:09] doing things in our lives declaring
[1:13:11] himself the resurrected
[1:13:13] life because it it when we come when I I
[1:13:16] could stand here and I could tell this
[1:13:18] in the way of the testimony of the
[1:13:19] things the Lord's done in my life to
[1:13:21] make himself real but what we want is
[1:13:23] not that your confidence would rest in
[1:13:24] the in that that he's done it just
[1:13:27] solely in someone's life but his word
[1:13:29] has promised this for you the
[1:13:32] believer that it is for you and that it
[1:13:36] is yours to
[1:13:37] possess and that it and that his word is
[1:13:40] life and and this is if we would just
[1:13:42] continue in John as we would as we
[1:13:46] read that which which that which we've
[1:13:49] seen and heard and declared we unto you
[1:13:52] that would that ye also may have
[1:13:55] fellowship with us and truly our
[1:13:59] fellowship is with the father and with
[1:14:01] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[1:14:04] write we unto you that your joy may be
[1:14:07] full this then is the message which we
[1:14:10] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:14:12] that God is light and in him is no
[1:14:15] Darkness at all if we say that we have
[1:14:18] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:14:21] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[1:14:24] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:14:26] we have Fellowship one with another and
[1:14:29] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:14:31] cleanses us from all sin if we say that
[1:14:35] we have no sin we deceive ourselves now
[1:14:38] that seems like a conundrum don't it and
[1:14:40] the truth is not in us if we confess our
[1:14:43] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:14:46] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:14:50] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:14:52] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:14:55] word is not in
[1:14:56] us oh the cleansing power of Christ it
[1:15:01] it is the very recognition that we're
[1:15:03] Sinners is that it's the grace of God
[1:15:05] manifested to us Jesus did not come to
[1:15:07] save The Righteous he didn't come to to
[1:15:09] heal those who had no need of a
[1:15:11] physician but he came to those who have
[1:15:14] a heart that you know what is it if if I
[1:15:16] was to say and and I'm declaring to you
[1:15:19] that Jesus Christ is here and you could
[1:15:21] have whatever you have need of I would
[1:15:23] hope that we wouldn't draw a blank
[1:15:27] right and not be able to ask for
[1:15:31] anything if if if we have have have
[1:15:34] sought out the needs within the body so
[1:15:37] much that when the opportunity to ask
[1:15:40] anything that you have need of is
[1:15:43] presented to you and you
[1:15:46] go I don't know
[1:15:50] yeah it I mean that's dumb driven cattle
[1:15:53] right that's that's being dull that's
[1:15:56] being numb but when he when you have the
[1:16:00] opportunity to ask for anything that you
[1:16:03] have need of yes sir and you're in the
[1:16:05] presence of God and all things are
[1:16:07] possible there becomes a personal
[1:16:09] possession that you have a faith to the
[1:16:12] the the ticket comes together he's my
[1:16:16] father I have confidence that if I ask
[1:16:18] him he'll provide all the things that I
[1:16:20] have need of Lord my brother he has need
[1:16:23] of you
[1:16:25] that's the
[1:16:26] faith that's the atmosphere that's what
[1:16:30] that's why we assemble ourselves
[1:16:32] together that's the
[1:16:34] dynamic and that's the
[1:16:37] pool and he's
[1:16:39] faithful and we cannot leave without
[1:16:42] having our needs
[1:16:45] met he he wants to bless us more than we
[1:16:48] even
[1:16:49] recognize there's no father that would
[1:16:51] give his son a stone when he asked for a
[1:16:53] piece of bread he he's just not going to
[1:16:57] do it what we have to do is approach him
[1:16:59] as our
[1:17:00] father we have to recognize who we are
[1:17:04] we have to reckon ourselves Sons and
[1:17:06] Daughters of God and and and take
[1:17:08] possession and and and say Boo devil I
[1:17:12] am not identified as a son of of of this
[1:17:16] world and a and a child of darkness and
[1:17:19] everything that you would try to put a
[1:17:20] worldly identity on me as I'm identified
[1:17:23] as a son of God
[1:17:27] there's a uh there's an accuser of the
[1:17:30] Brethren is what I what I try to express
[1:17:34] and that voice is a real
[1:17:36] voice but everything that he can accuse
[1:17:40] you of the only thing that he really can
[1:17:42] condemn is this flesh because your
[1:17:44] identity in Christ and your soul and the
[1:17:46] C Gene of God never send in the first
[1:17:49] place the recognition of what true
[1:17:52] justification is in this day should set
[1:17:54] our Hearts free and it does set our
[1:17:56] hearts free from all
[1:17:58] condemnation the only thing we have to
[1:18:00] do is renew our minds by the washing of
[1:18:02] the water of the word and and recognize
[1:18:04] our position God you see me sinless and
[1:18:07] spotless when I ask you it is your
[1:18:11] heart's desire to give me the petitions
[1:18:14] of my heart because I'm not asking a
[1:18:15] miss you know so many times we take it
[1:18:19] and I I I judg myself like okay that's
[1:18:22] not my thought
[1:18:25] I wouldn't pray this after the flesh
[1:18:27] sometimes we have to be honest with
[1:18:28] ourselves and what Scoundrels we really
[1:18:31] are it was my sins that held him there
[1:18:34] it was my mocking voice we have to
[1:18:38] recognize the
[1:18:39] flesh is an
[1:18:42] enemy okay and in recognizing that guy
[1:18:47] doesn't say good
[1:18:50] things have confidence of the voice of
[1:18:53] God in you have conf confidence of the
[1:18:55] deity that's wanting to speak out step
[1:18:58] out in faith and say
[1:19:00] it take God at his word that's not you
[1:19:04] speaking that's Christ the anointed word
[1:19:08] speaking in you that's a boldness that's
[1:19:10] ours to
[1:19:12] possess it's mine I'm taking back what
[1:19:15] the devil took from
[1:19:20] me it's recognizing the presence of
[1:19:23] Jesus Christ is alive in
[1:19:25] you to do and to perform the very things
[1:19:28] that he promised to
[1:19:30] do as an
[1:19:37] individual I claim if brother Brandon
[1:19:40] towards the end of the service he's
[1:19:41] talking about those who I may be Sinners
[1:19:44] seeking an experience but I find this
[1:19:47] may be more uh applicable to us as he as
[1:19:50] he uh offers those who do not know them
[1:19:54] does know him who's heard his word and
[1:19:56] would like to uh raise their hands he
[1:19:59] moves in and he says this in 205 he says
[1:20:02] I claim every one of them maybe some
[1:20:04] Christians Lord that's trying to walk
[1:20:06] through life trying to live better every
[1:20:09] day and they want an experience of a
[1:20:12] better walk they raised their hands too
[1:20:15] father I pray that you will bless them
[1:20:18] may they find that all sufficiency
[1:20:20] tonight in Christ the word made flesh
[1:20:23] amongst us Grant it Lord I commit them
[1:20:26] thee in thy name in the name of the Lord
[1:20:28] Jesus Christ
[1:20:30] amen in the sermon brother Brandon would
[1:20:33] go through he would show the sign that
[1:20:35] was given to Abraham he would make
[1:20:37] manifest the son of man Ministry in his
[1:20:39] life Jesus Christ declaring his presence
[1:20:43] amongst us if we were just left with
[1:20:45] thinking that was something that was
[1:20:47] only done historically in time it would
[1:20:50] be stuck in a
[1:20:52] book and none of us would be able to say
[1:20:55] that we were there I don't think any you
[1:20:58] know very few would be old enough to
[1:21:01] have been there and if so would probably
[1:21:02] been a child and we would have missed
[1:21:05] the opportunity to say that we had been
[1:21:07] in the presence of God made known and
[1:21:09] declared so
[1:21:12] sovereignly so
[1:21:14] directly and the way God does it now is
[1:21:18] no different because the word is still
[1:21:20] Discerning the thoughts and the intents
[1:21:22] of the heart and there's a effect when
[1:21:26] the word of God comes in my life and
[1:21:28] shows me the things that have to be cut
[1:21:29] away that I recognize he's never left me
[1:21:33] he's never forsaken me and that's
[1:21:36] why his word
[1:21:38] Cuts that's why it's still dividing and
[1:21:42] no bastard child with they don't
[1:21:44] withstand correction but lord it's
[1:21:46] because I'm recognizing that I have need
[1:21:48] of you it's because I recognize that I
[1:21:51] need you that's what the greatest
[1:21:53] confidence I have that you're still
[1:21:54] wanting to deal with me and change my
[1:21:58] life if if it the the condition of a
[1:22:01] blind wretched naked and miserable and
[1:22:04] when I was talking about the presence of
[1:22:05] God being recog not being recognized or
[1:22:08] if he was here and you could ask it's
[1:22:10] that condition that you wouldn't be able
[1:22:12] to ask anything would be your wretched
[1:22:14] blind miserable poor wretched and naked
[1:22:17] have need of nothing and don't know it
[1:22:20] I'm good you're here but I'm good I
[1:22:24] don't I don't need you to minister to
[1:22:26] the things in my life that are dirty I
[1:22:29] don't need you to take away the things
[1:22:30] that I cannot uh deal with myself I'm
[1:22:35] I've got this and it's not an I got this
[1:22:38] he's got this we ain't got this I don't
[1:22:42] know if anybody of you needs your
[1:22:43] confidence shaken in yourself but we
[1:22:45] ain't got
[1:22:46] this we don't have a
[1:22:49] chance if you're left to yourself you
[1:22:51] will fail I need a savior I need a
[1:22:54] present help I need a God that's alive I
[1:22:57] need one that delivers me I need him to
[1:23:00] come and apprehend my very thoughts my
[1:23:01] very Minds my very voice I need Jesus
[1:23:04] Christ put on display I need him to be
[1:23:07] life to those who are in
[1:23:13] desperation we can't we we're past being
[1:23:16] able to rest in the things that we can
[1:23:20] do they'll be
[1:23:22] temporal it's okay to do that them but
[1:23:25] we've got to be have enough wisdom and
[1:23:28] enough foresight to say Lord I've
[1:23:30] handled this but I need you now I
[1:23:33] remember a testimony of a L young lady I
[1:23:36] I coming from my side it was no surprise
[1:23:39] that when you really mess your life up
[1:23:42] that you want
[1:23:43] God I mean that wasn't a surprise but
[1:23:46] what I could not understand was the
[1:23:48] desperation that could happen when
[1:23:51] someone's just got it all together
[1:23:54] you're good how can you come to a place
[1:23:56] of desperation it was a mystery to me
[1:23:59] not a mystery that I could mess my life
[1:24:00] up not a mystery that I was a loser I
[1:24:03] really didn't have a life to live and I
[1:24:06] needed God I was dead but how could
[1:24:10] someone who seemingly gets good
[1:24:14] grades obeys their parents does the
[1:24:17] things that they are told to do come to
[1:24:21] a place of desperation
[1:24:24] where they
[1:24:25] recognize I can't do
[1:24:28] this and I got to hear a testimony of
[1:24:31] somebody said I'd always obeyed my
[1:24:34] parents I'd always done what was right I
[1:24:37] was raised right but I knew I was
[1:24:39] leaving home and I was going to be away
[1:24:41] from all of it and something struck me I
[1:24:45] don't have what it takes to keep
[1:24:48] me I ain't got this and a desperation
[1:24:52] set in God I need you I don't want to
[1:24:56] live without you I need you present now
[1:25:00] and the same
[1:25:01] Grace that could take a sinner and
[1:25:04] convert him could take a good person and
[1:25:06] recognize Lord I need you I can't live
[1:25:10] without you the same Grace that kept
[1:25:13] them from having to go in the world was
[1:25:16] the same Grace that gave them experience
[1:25:18] to know that he would never leave him or
[1:25:20] forsake
[1:25:22] Him and that wherever you're at he's
[1:25:28] here the the the place you are
[1:25:31] at when you look I was out on a ship and
[1:25:34] I didn't know I found myself quite
[1:25:36] turned around quite a bit and if I was
[1:25:39] going to go anywhere or do anything I
[1:25:41] had to go to the map and I had to look
[1:25:43] at it and it had to tell me I am
[1:25:47] here and if I was going to go get food I
[1:25:51] needed to know if I was supposed to go
[1:25:53] up the stairs or go down the stairs
[1:25:56] because I was tired of going up and down
[1:25:59] the stairs not knowing where I was going
[1:26:03] I finally decided I would go look at the
[1:26:06] map and if you want to know where you're
[1:26:10] at we have a
[1:26:12] map you cannot put on a tape and listen
[1:26:15] to the voice of God to this generation
[1:26:17] and not identify exactly where you're at
[1:26:21] you cannot come to the house of God with
[1:26:23] an expectation and not have the word of
[1:26:25] God come and speak to your need and tell
[1:26:28] you exactly where you're
[1:26:30] at I believe that if the musicians would
[1:26:40] come you know I believe the only thing
[1:26:42] we really sometimes have to do is
[1:26:44] literally say I'm here
[1:26:46] Lord we just have to identify I'm
[1:26:50] here right where you're at it doesn't
[1:26:54] matter matter the place he's omnipresent
[1:26:58] there is not a place in your mind and
[1:27:00] and and I'll give charge to the devil
[1:27:02] right now there a there is not a place
[1:27:04] in your mind that God can't come get you
[1:27:07] out of if he could if he could call a
[1:27:09] Lazareth forth I rebuke any devil that
[1:27:12] thinks he could take somebody into some
[1:27:14] fantasy land think that he can occupy
[1:27:16] their mind in such a way that the
[1:27:18] almighty presence of God cannot become
[1:27:20] aware to them I'm S I got a testimony
[1:27:23] sitting right here of somebody who is
[1:27:25] under the influence of other things and
[1:27:26] a voice shouted out and said that's the
[1:27:29] last
[1:27:30] time I don't care where you're
[1:27:34] at all you have to do is say Lord I'm
[1:27:36] here Here I Am Lord it could be Tanger
[1:27:39] in a a Brier he's the Good Shepherd that
[1:27:42] will leave the 99 and he'll go exactly
[1:27:45] to right where you're at all you have to
[1:27:47] do is say Lord I've looked in your word
[1:27:49] I see the map I'm here I need you Lord
[1:27:52] I'm confused I need Revelation amen I
[1:27:56] Lord I I got to tell you I don't even
[1:27:58] know what my next step is but I'm
[1:28:01] here you're the one who could turn on
[1:28:04] your words a light into my path I'm here
[1:28:07] Lord invite him to come become aware of
[1:28:11] his presence to
[1:28:12] you and you and you will never be the
[1:28:15] same yes let's just stand together
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:28] just forgive me
[1:28:29] and so much I wanted to
[1:28:34] read if you can go
[1:28:37] listen read the book from our
[1:28:41] Prophet I believe it would really uh
[1:28:43] minister to you let's just bow our
[1:28:47] hearts Heavenly Father we thank you that
[1:28:50] you're here yes Lord Lord that in the
[1:28:53] things that we cannot do ourselves or
[1:28:55] accomplish you can
[1:28:57] do Lord and that is truly all we can say
[1:29:01] father is we need
[1:29:04] you regardless of where we're at father
[1:29:07] our next step we can't take it without
[1:29:10] you lord if we've served you for 40
[1:29:13] years we still need you Lord if we're
[1:29:16] just coming to know you we need
[1:29:18] you Lord and you're the only one who
[1:29:21] knows exactly where we're at
[1:29:25] father you know each one that's in this
[1:29:27] room where their thoughts are at this
[1:29:29] very Mo
[1:29:31] moment Lord in my prayer and my
[1:29:34] desire Lord I believe even what you
[1:29:37] desire and put on my heart is that we
[1:29:40] would recognize your presence Lord that
[1:29:42] you're here to do what we cannot do that
[1:29:46] you're here to minister to the needs
[1:29:48] that we have Lord and that you so loved
[1:29:51] us that you purchased it all
[1:29:54] father Calvary declared that it is
[1:29:56] finished all we have need of for healing
[1:30:00] you've already suffered the
[1:30:02] stripes Lord we ask that our faith would
[1:30:05] grow and even seeing our brothers and
[1:30:07] sisters gathered together here we have a
[1:30:09] word that says where two or three are
[1:30:11] gathered you're present with us Lord
[1:30:14] just that scripture alone should give us
[1:30:17] enough Faith to know that all things are
[1:30:21] possible Lord I ask that
[1:30:24] each one as we would raise our hands and
[1:30:26] say Lord Here I
[1:30:30] Am Lord I remember a weak
[1:30:33] prayer I said one time I said behold me
[1:30:36] oh the answer was on the way
[1:30:39] father you seen
[1:30:41] me Lord You've Changed
[1:30:44] me you're the same yesterday today and
[1:30:47] forever father I ask that those who've
[1:30:50] raised their
[1:30:51] hands may they know that you've seen
[1:30:53] them
[1:30:55] Lord they could not raise their hand and
[1:30:57] you not see
[1:30:58] them so we know that all things are
[1:31:01] possible and the answer is on the way
[1:31:03] for we've asked these things in the name
[1:31:05] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

[1:52:57] want to make church just a habit of
[1:52:59] coming in and going but Lord that that
[1:53:02] presence of God and by the
[1:53:06] promise Lord I heard your Prophet say
[1:53:09] the other day speaking
[1:53:12] about speaking about Joshua he said that
[1:53:16] Joshua received the promise from God and
[1:53:20] and Joshua took the word of God and he
[1:53:23] said and he took the word of God and
[1:53:25] whatever he spoke he laid it upon That
[1:53:28] Word of Promise because he knew if God
[1:53:30] promised that it would come to pass Lord
[1:53:33] our brother did the same he spoke the
[1:53:35] word and and whatever we have need of
[1:53:38] Lord we are placing in upon the Word of
[1:53:40] Promise Lord because we know you have
[1:53:43] already spoken and if we can just lay
[1:53:46] our needs our our desires our trials
[1:53:50] everything that we go through upon on
[1:53:52] that that same word it will produce the
[1:53:54] same result every time lord like he said
[1:53:59] even that woman with a blood issue oh
[1:54:02] Lord we are that woman with a blood
[1:54:04] issue tonight we talked about the Blind
[1:54:06] Men We Are that blind man tonight and we
[1:54:09] take our trials and our our difficulties
[1:54:12] and we place it upon that same word that
[1:54:16] same promise that will produce the same
[1:54:18] result father I pray that there be no
[1:54:20] feeble person Among Us tonight that each
[1:54:23] one in this building others are
[1:54:25] listening to they may receive something
[1:54:28] from you Lord that could have an eternal
[1:54:31] testimony about your presence and what
[1:54:33] you can do we love you with all our
[1:54:35] hearts Lord your word just brings joy to
[1:54:38] our hearts satisfaction father it
[1:54:41] quenches The Thirst inside and there's
[1:54:44] nothing like it and we ask for those
[1:54:47] that have been prayed for Lord father
[1:54:49] May the Holy Spirit as our brother spoke
[1:54:52] the holy spirit is the one that Broods
[1:54:54] upon the word father may he go after
[1:54:57] what they have spoken and what's been
[1:54:59] prayed upon and brooded until it comes
[1:55:02] to the reality to those that have
[1:55:04] requested it Lord because I believe
[1:55:06] that's your promise to the believer we
[1:55:09] commit everything to you Lord and we ask
[1:55:11] that as we depart from this place may
[1:55:13] you just protect us along the way Lord
[1:55:16] and if you be your will that we meet
[1:55:18] again may you may we come with the same
