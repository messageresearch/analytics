[44:48] power let's go
[44:50] before gracious Heavenly Father what a
[44:52] purchase
[44:53] price what Calvary has done it's power
[44:57] hour shall never fade it's purchased
[45:00] us lord it's provided an entrance by
[45:02] which we come tonight into your presence
[45:06] Lord to gather at your table to Feast
[45:08] with you Lord and we want to give you
[45:10] all the praise and the glory Lord we
[45:13] don't want to take that price that was
[45:14] paid and counted as no effect Lord but
[45:18] whatever it is that would try to hinder
[45:20] us from entering in it's been a finished
[45:22] work at Calvary lord it's not our
[45:25] worthiness it was the worthiness of the
[45:27] price that was paid father we deem that
[45:30] sacrifice now worthy Lord and we lift
[45:33] you up and glorify you for what you've
[45:35] done Lord and we now just Commit This
[45:38] service to you that it would not be man
[45:40] that speaks father we didn't come here
[45:42] to hear the words of man that will fill
[45:44] but Lord as your children we've gathered
[45:46] to hear from you lord your word is what
[45:49] delivers it sets free father and it's by
[45:53] that you break the bread of life to us
[45:55] and it molds us into the image of what
[45:57] we ought to be Lord so we just now
[46:00] commit each one into your hands that you
[46:02] would anoint the hearer that you'd
[46:04] anoint the speaker Lord the things that
[46:06] you placed upon our heart father that
[46:07] they could Faithfully be delivered that
[46:10] You' allow us to just carry in your word
[46:12] Lord and feast at your table we ask all
[46:15] these things in the precious name of our
[46:17] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen while
[46:20] you're standing if you turn in your
[46:22] Bibles with me to John the 14th chapter
[46:26] we'll read in the
[47:56] we've been made uh possessors of all
[47:58] things we have an inheritance in Christ
[48:00] Jesus and you know if the one thing that
[48:03] would be on my desire that I feel that
[48:05] the Lord's impressed on my heart that we
[48:07] want to understand what our inheritance
[48:09] is and our uh position in Christ assures
[48:13] our possession okay so everything that
[48:17] he accomplished at Calvary we are the
[48:19] inheritors of that and that is all
[48:22] things and this the the This Promise of
[48:25] what Jesus Christ was what was
[48:27] manifested was the very promise that was
[48:30] given to Abraham I this is a proved
[48:34] promise it's the promise that you shall
[48:37] possess the gates of your enemy um so
[48:40] we're going to try to stret just
[48:41] Faithfully lay a foundation read some
[48:44] scriptures and not get too far ahead
[48:47] because I feel that uh you know if
[48:50] you're established in the word of God
[48:51] it's not going to fail so you want to
[48:53] know that by which you're fighting how
[48:55] you're making your claim and I I know
[48:59] with this message it's restoring a faith
[49:01] that this is the unfailing word of God
[49:04] we don't read it as an allegory we don't
[49:06] read it as uh uh you know that is
[49:08] uninspired this inspired but we know
[49:10] that it is Faithfully inspired word of
[49:13] God and we can use it because it is
[49:17] effectual in us because we have faith we
[49:19] take the word of God and uh we can use
[49:23] it as a
[49:24] sword and if you see the word of God not
[49:26] God not being profitable then we want
[49:28] the faith so we have strong Hands of
[49:31] Faith to use the word of God so I as we
[49:35] would just I want to turn over to John
[49:38] 17 and uh verse 8 this is the commission
[49:43] this is Jesus again once again speaking
[49:45] he says as thou sent me into the world
[49:48] even so have I also sent them into the
[49:51] world so we're we're now we we have a
[49:54] commission as Jesus Christ was sent now
[49:58] we're being sent also so we have a
[50:00] reference now we can look back at Jesus
[50:02] Christ and has he was in the world so
[50:05] are we he he didn't take us out of the
[50:08] world but he's but now as he was sent
[50:10] into the world so we are now sent into
[50:13] the
[50:14] world and that's important because
[50:16] Christ is our example if there was a
[50:19] situation that he was faced with and how
[50:21] he responded it's that's how we respond
[50:25] uh that's a very simp that's a very
[50:27] fundamental of Christianity right is
[50:29] Jesus Christ the very Life of Christ if
[50:32] that's dwelling in you then the works
[50:33] that I do you shall do also and all of
[50:36] the works right it's not just Beatitudes
[50:38] but it's it's the power and
[50:40] demonstration of the lord we we're not
[50:41] cutting anything out it's all of it it's
[50:44] the soft answer it's the turning the
[50:46] other cheek it's being silent it's it's
[50:49] laying your life down all of it um
[50:53] Genesis turn with me over to chapter
[50:57] 14: 18- 24 this is the the promise that
[51:02] we have where we're receiving it from um
[51:06] in chapter 14 ver
[51:08] 18 says and mzc king of Salem brought
[51:12] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[51:14] priest of the most high God and he
[51:16] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham
[51:18] of the most high god possessor of Heaven
[51:21] and Earth so right here we're getting in
[51:24] the Book of Genesis this is one of the
[51:25] first places you're going to see where
[51:27] even though we know God this should be
[51:29] simple comprehension that he created All
[51:32] Things by him are all things made but
[51:34] this is now a a a a pronunciation of
[51:37] possession he's the possessor of heavens
[51:39] and
[51:40] earth and blessed be the most high God
[51:43] who hath delivered thine enemies into
[51:45] thine hand and he gave him tithes of all
[51:48] and the king of Sodom said unto Abraham
[51:51] give me the persons and take the goods
[51:53] to thyself and Abra Abraham said to the
[51:56] king of Sodom I have left I have left of
[51:59] my hand unto the Lord and most high God
[52:02] the possessor of heavens and earth that
[52:04] I will not take from a thread even from
[52:07] thy Sho latch and that I will not take
[52:10] anything that is thine lest thou should
[52:13] say I have made Abraham
[52:15] Rich the
[52:17] separation as a that that we see is one
[52:22] that we don't even uh we don't want to
[52:24] say that we've been prospered by the
[52:26] world world or the things of the world
[52:28] you know brother Matthew I was so
[52:29] blessed by it he talked about when you
[52:31] lose your reasoning when you lose your
[52:33] position in Christ you become powerless
[52:36] right we're not holding to this world's
[52:38] or the world's Goods it has not
[52:40] prospered us anything that we have we
[52:42] give God the glory for but the
[52:46] possession we have we're air to all
[52:49] things and that that may not be seen
[52:53] here so that we're our faith is not
[52:56] claiming a possession because we we have
[52:59] uh something tangible that we're saying
[53:02] you know possessions 9/10 of the law um
[53:05] but believe it or not everybody on this
[53:08] earth except the Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:10] is
[53:11] squatters right you own
[53:15] it there's a new heavens and a new Earth
[53:18] it's purchased by the blood of Jesus
[53:20] Christ those things that are not Eternal
[53:22] they're going to pass away and they may
[53:25] claim that they have ownership now but
[53:28] you own it because you're heir to it now
[53:32] you may not possess it just
[53:35] yet but by faith I possess
[53:38] it so don't think that just because uh
[53:43] you you that you're not a possessor of
[53:45] it that you're not aired to it just
[53:46] because something has made a counter
[53:48] claim to it because we're going to as we
[53:52] Lord willing go through this we're going
[53:53] to recognize part of your inheritance as
[53:57] a Seed of Abraham is that you get to
[53:59] kick the devil off of your
[54:01] possession you have the privilege of
[54:03] casting down Satan because your position
[54:06] is in Jesus Christ and he's Lord of all
[54:10] he he's under your
[54:12] foot so by God's grace we want to
[54:15] establish where our position is and if
[54:17] we understand our position there isn't
[54:20] any place in the body of Christ where
[54:22] Satan isn't under your
[54:24] foot amen it it is it's such an an
[54:28] assurance that we can now in
[54:31] faith confront the enemy because he's
[54:33] making a false claim he right now in
[54:37] this building that because of the god
[54:41] wanting to receive glory and be pleased
[54:43] by your faith he's allowed the waser
[54:45] he's allowed an enemy to be able to come
[54:47] and Buffet you and he's made you more
[54:50] than a conqueror in Christ Jesus our
[54:52] part is to cast them down
[54:58] I'm not sure which verse I left off in
[54:59] Reading there but um he he basically
[55:03] says I'm not going to be take anything
[55:04] of the world I'm not going to profit by
[55:06] it I'm not going to even so you can't
[55:07] even say you've you've given me a lace
[55:09] of my shoe the latch of my sandal none
[55:12] of this none none of my possession none
[55:14] of my being none of my substance I'm
[55:17] going to say has come from the world or
[55:19] has been given to me by anything that
[55:21] youve profited me right the favor that
[55:24] we have is of God anything that we have
[55:27] is by the grace of God because we know
[55:30] that if not for the grace of God
[55:32] tomorrow we wouldn't even have a breath
[55:33] to to take right and we on that same
[55:37] basis we know that Satan can't take us
[55:40] before our time right the boldness that
[55:43] we have we we we should be bold our
[55:46] faith is a Burly Faith you know we don't
[55:50] have a problem confronting the enemy and
[55:52] say you can't take me before my
[55:54] time we none of us should be timid about
[55:58] that we don't tempt the Lord thy God we
[56:00] don't cast you know we're not going to
[56:01] go cast ourselves out the height of a of
[56:04] a cliff and say Satan you can't take me
[56:06] before my time but we know by his grace
[56:09] he's ordering our footsteps and as we
[56:11] walk in the will of the Lord and we've
[56:13] placed ourselves in the palm of his hand
[56:15] that Satan cannot harm us we don't want
[56:17] to be outside of that
[56:22] position
[56:24] amen this is uh
[56:28] wonderful book book of Ephesians it's a
[56:31] it's our modern book of of
[56:35] exodus in uh chapter 1 veres 15-
[56:39] 23 if you want to turn with me there
[56:56] wherefore I also after I heard of your
[56:58] faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto
[57:00] all the saints cease not to give thanks
[57:02] for you making mention of you in my
[57:04] prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus
[57:07] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[57:09] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[57:11] and the knowledge of him we cannot
[57:14] underemphasize the importance of
[57:16] Revelation it is revelation that'll
[57:19] allow us to have a firm understanding of
[57:20] our position in Christ that the eyes of
[57:23] your understanding being enlightened
[57:24] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[57:27] calling and what is the riches of his
[57:29] glory and his inheritance in the Saints
[57:32] it is something I like the way that's
[57:34] phrased his inheritance in the Saints so
[57:37] we're part of his his Heritage and his
[57:40] inheritance what is the exceeding
[57:41] greatness of his power to us word who
[57:44] believe according to the works of his
[57:46] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[57:48] Jesus when he had raised him up from the
[57:50] dead and set him at the right hand of in
[57:53] Heavenly places far above all
[57:56] principalities and power and might and
[57:58] Dominion in every name that is named not
[58:01] only in this world but also in that
[58:03] which is to come that he hath put all
[58:07] things under his feet and gave him to be
[58:09] the head over all things to the church
[58:12] let's just say all things all things
[58:14] okay I let we can't enumerate it all but
[58:18] he's put all things underneath the
[58:20] Christ Jesus's feet now that's an
[58:22] authority that Satan's willing to allow
[58:23] you to give he's conqueror he's Lord of
[58:27] all he's been whipped by him he tried to
[58:30] you know when he was went to hell he
[58:32] took the keys to his own house he's
[58:34] willing to admit Jesus I
[58:37] know he's he's willing to admit that
[58:41] okay but what he doesn't want you to
[58:43] realize is that you're in Christ because
[58:45] as soon as you realize you're in
[58:48] Christ he's under your
[58:50] foot he's under your foot your boast
[58:53] isn't even in you I I'm not I I was
[58:57] unworthy I I I I wasn't me I I didn't
[59:00] make a way but I could tell you I could
[59:03] testify to you right
[59:05] now bless God I I if you know what it's
[59:09] like to come into the presence of
[59:12] God and what that victory
[59:16] was there ain't one person here who
[59:18] can't experience the divine presence of
[59:21] Jesus Christ by the victory of calvary
[59:28] oh
[59:30] Hallelujah and now it's not just now I I
[59:34] believe that the the outpouring of the
[59:36] Lord will change you you will not be
[59:39] able to leave the presence the same you
[59:42] will beyond a shadow of a doubt know
[59:44] that he's
[59:45] real he he it will cleanse you it will
[59:48] wash you you will know what what it is
[59:51] to know the love of God but it's not
[59:54] just an outward anointing
[59:56] but it's the promise that he would be
[59:58] with you even in you so when we're
[1:00:01] talking about how as Christ was in the
[1:00:04] world you know you just look at how
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ
[1:00:08] established his his own Ministry he says
[1:00:11] it's not I that doeth the works but the
[1:00:13] father that dwelleth in me amen right
[1:00:15] we're not making a boast and we're not
[1:00:17] doing anything that Jesus Christ didn't
[1:00:20] do we're simply saying it's Christ that
[1:00:22] liveth in me it's not I that doth the
[1:00:25] work
[1:00:26] but he promised that he'd be with me he
[1:00:29] promised he would be in
[1:00:31] me as he sent Jesus
[1:00:34] Christ right so he sent
[1:00:37] us and he didn't send Jesus Christ to be
[1:00:40] lower than
[1:00:43] anything was there anything that Jesus
[1:00:45] Christ didn't
[1:00:48] conquer is it anything on you know he
[1:00:51] was tempted in all man that's the that
[1:00:53] is we were fellowshipping I I was in the
[1:00:55] uh
[1:00:56] I couldn't get out of my driveway
[1:00:58] yesterday it about five different people
[1:01:00] ended up one after another was
[1:01:03] almost comical um kept coming by and we
[1:01:07] just Fellowship probably just one after
[1:01:08] the other but the thing that I always
[1:01:11] find that I'm trying to witness to
[1:01:14] people is is you know we understand the
[1:01:16] tress of the godhead we understand that
[1:01:19] Jesus Christ was God we don't have a
[1:01:21] trinitarian thinking and one of the the
[1:01:24] main things that caused the whole
[1:01:26] trinitarian Doctrine to be established
[1:01:27] is they were confounded with the
[1:01:29] humanity of Jesus Christ it's a the
[1:01:32] deity of Jesus Christ and God being
[1:01:35] dwelling in flesh that could be no
[1:01:39] Beauty and that we would desire him that
[1:01:41] he could sleep that he could hunger that
[1:01:44] uh that but here is a man and I do
[1:01:48] believe that when they went to wake
[1:01:50] Jesus Christ up in the boat they were
[1:01:51] going to ask him to Bell water okay they
[1:01:55] were do do not care that we're dying can
[1:01:58] you please put some skin in the game
[1:02:00] grab a rope grab a bucket you know we're
[1:02:04] tending for our lives here get with the
[1:02:07] program
[1:02:10] man right and and that was a fair
[1:02:12] assessment okay like help me out please
[1:02:16] that's right and they're asking him to
[1:02:18] help I I I think in a you know in a kind
[1:02:22] way maybe do you not care we're about to
[1:02:25] die
[1:02:27] so but then when he stands and he says
[1:02:30] peace be
[1:02:31] still they say what manner of
[1:02:35] man we we got the man part
[1:02:39] down but what manner of man is this that
[1:02:42] even that the winds and the Sea obey and
[1:02:47] I I'll tell you what manner of man is
[1:02:49] this as the sons of God that we could
[1:02:52] that it's let there be a squirrel and
[1:02:54] there's a squirrel that says storm go
[1:02:58] back to where you were and we're
[1:02:59] standing now as sons of God where we can
[1:03:02] speak the rain on the brother's crop we
[1:03:04] as sons of Abraham say Satan give it
[1:03:07] back no more there's got to come a point
[1:03:11] of of anger right there you know it it
[1:03:14] says the scripture actually says to be
[1:03:16] anger without I believe wrath you know
[1:03:19] it doesn't say don't be
[1:03:20] angry you know but there can be a
[1:03:23] righteous anger Satan that's enough
[1:03:26] that's enough you know you go back
[1:03:28] through the Old Testament you know hey
[1:03:30] you're about to take my crop for the
[1:03:31] last time and he takes a an ox
[1:03:34] gourd and just start slaying people see
[1:03:37] and it was it was a now how could he do
[1:03:40] that there was a promise that was given
[1:03:43] to Abraham that said that was his land
[1:03:47] okay so now I hope by the scriptures
[1:03:49] we've read we've got all things heavens
[1:03:52] and earth all right so the things that
[1:03:54] are even to come the things that we
[1:03:56] don't even see I don't care if it's some
[1:03:59] a uh demon out there in a spiritual
[1:04:02] realm you can't see him he's
[1:04:04] defeated okay there's principalities
[1:04:07] there's evil there's there's things that
[1:04:09] wickedness that work in high places and
[1:04:11] I don't care how big it is and and think
[1:04:14] about this I love the song our brother
[1:04:16] Ryan Hayes wrote you know it it doesn't
[1:04:18] matter how big it it is the grace of God
[1:04:22] is greater it's always greater and
[1:04:25] anytime time the devil starts lifting
[1:04:27] something up you can just start getting
[1:04:29] excited because it's like I don't care
[1:04:31] how big you make
[1:04:32] it God's
[1:04:35] greater so as soon as he did his great
[1:04:38] job telling you how great your sin was
[1:04:43] he just magnified the price paid at
[1:04:45] Calvary what a
[1:04:48] price thank you
[1:04:52] Lord now the Poss
[1:04:56] possession is is an interesting thing
[1:04:59] you know we would say that uh your
[1:05:01] position is your it it demonstrates uh
[1:05:04] what you're in possession of right if
[1:05:06] you're talking about lands you know
[1:05:08] we're talk if you're thinking of just
[1:05:10] this come to me the the war in Ukraine
[1:05:13] um you would say that depending on where
[1:05:15] the Russian army is in Ukraine you would
[1:05:17] say they're in the possession of that
[1:05:18] land right that now Ukraine would say
[1:05:22] you may be in possession of that land
[1:05:25] but you don't have claim to it um that's
[1:05:30] my sovereign land and you don't belong
[1:05:33] here and so they're fighting a natural
[1:05:36] land for something that while the enemy
[1:05:38] is in possession of it they're saying
[1:05:40] you don't have a right to it and we're
[1:05:43] going to we're going to take it back
[1:05:45] right so when you understand that the
[1:05:49] importance of position but it's not
[1:05:53] everything that's that is uh something
[1:05:56] CU we possess things in a truthful
[1:06:00] position in Christ Jesus that's the only
[1:06:02] Eternal position is in a perfect word
[1:06:05] but what the false claim is from the
[1:06:07] enemy is is he will try to take
[1:06:09] possession of something that is not his
[1:06:12] and that is where the fight is at and
[1:06:14] what are you fighting for
[1:06:17] possession okay and it's because he's
[1:06:20] taken a position that he needs to be
[1:06:23] driven out from okay so as you you see
[1:06:28] this the children of Israel coming out
[1:06:30] of Egypt they have the Holy go you know
[1:06:32] it's a holy ghost that they cross over
[1:06:34] Jordan and now they're going to take
[1:06:37] possession of the land they had to fight
[1:06:39] for every inch of it and that's the you
[1:06:42] know the thing that seems to be is uh we
[1:06:46] want to just some for some reason just
[1:06:48] say I've got it there's no fight well
[1:06:51] I'm I'm secure in my eternal salvation
[1:06:53] okay but I also want to put the devil
[1:06:55] under my foot and if I've got complete
[1:06:58] victory in my life I want that cup to
[1:07:00] start
[1:07:00] overflowing you know it I'm not content
[1:07:03] was seeing the devil take up positions
[1:07:06] in my brothers and sisters life when I
[1:07:09] could see the influence of them in their
[1:07:11] life that he's destroying them that that
[1:07:14] he's doing things and they don't belong
[1:07:16] to him so we have a way of warfare that
[1:07:19] we're going to go and fight the enemy
[1:07:21] and it's not by power not by might but
[1:07:24] by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:07:26] we want to know that we have an
[1:07:28] effectual part that we play in prayer in
[1:07:31] the word of God where we create
[1:07:32] atmospheres where things
[1:07:34] change I
[1:07:37] uh think of this I kind of joke with my
[1:07:41] brother Matthew he was in the world and
[1:07:43] uh I would go into his
[1:07:46] room was that's
[1:07:49] right and he would be out and the God
[1:07:51] had gotten a hold of my life and I would
[1:07:53] get in his room and I would pray through
[1:07:55] on his
[1:07:56] bed I would just get in there and I'd
[1:07:58] let the presence of God come down I
[1:08:00] would walk out it was milky white I was
[1:08:02] like boy when he walks in that room he
[1:08:04] ain't going to know what hit
[1:08:06] him you know what I mean now I was
[1:08:10] believing he wasn't serving the lord
[1:08:12] then there's some rough that was at the
[1:08:14] old house at 916
[1:08:16] McCurry he was wasn't serving the lord
[1:08:18] when we moved into for the 1 15404
[1:08:21] Shirley way so just from that reference
[1:08:25] you know I there may have been a tering
[1:08:28] there may have been a time but look what
[1:08:30] the Lord's using him for now right so we
[1:08:34] there is a weapon of warfare and it is
[1:08:37] effectual and we can testify to the
[1:08:40] grace of God in our
[1:08:42] lives let's just read a little bit from
[1:08:44] our Prophet this is the deed of Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ this is back in 49 he says but
[1:08:49] that is the the god the Creator living
[1:08:52] in you and giving you all the power and
[1:08:54] your impos possession of anything that
[1:08:57] he had so it is in you to abstain from
[1:09:00] Evil to do good to shun evil to flee to
[1:09:03] righteousness to turn away from
[1:09:05] temptation all malice hatred Strife envy
[1:09:08] and so forth turn away from it and for
[1:09:11] that take him for from your heart if you
[1:09:14] will receive him Embrace him and love
[1:09:17] him and hold him in your heart and love
[1:09:18] him I can tell you the church together
[1:09:21] in that kind of power has the power to
[1:09:24] bind the heavens kill the sick Open the
[1:09:26] Eyes of the blind Hallelujah the deaf
[1:09:29] speak the dumb speak the deaf hear the
[1:09:31] walk and the blind see why it's
[1:09:34] recognizing the power of God into your
[1:09:39] heart that there he
[1:09:41] is the deity you know that seems to be a
[1:09:44] buzzword you know people don't want to
[1:09:47] accept deity well if if you can't accept
[1:09:50] that Jesus Christ was deity then you'll
[1:09:53] never accept deity in you because he's
[1:09:56] in you and if Jesus Christ is in you
[1:10:01] deity and it's but the devil doesn't
[1:10:04] want you to recognize that now there's a
[1:10:06] difference in that we understand that
[1:10:08] the blood vessel of Jesus Christ was
[1:10:10] deity that was a created blood vessel
[1:10:13] that was God but you got to understand
[1:10:14] what the new birth is I mean don't
[1:10:17] negate the the new birth to something
[1:10:19] else other than the life of Jesus Christ
[1:10:21] and deity because that is De if you if
[1:10:23] you don't understand that that's God in
[1:10:25] you and that's deity you're not putting
[1:10:27] the devil under your foot and and that's
[1:10:31] what the devil wants to do is negate
[1:10:33] your experience and tell you that it's
[1:10:36] that the authority that you have in
[1:10:39] Jesus Christ you know that this uh the
[1:10:42] scripture when it talks about a son
[1:10:44] differeth nothing from a servant that
[1:10:47] that son has
[1:10:48] Authority you understand he has
[1:10:50] Authority as a son not even being fully
[1:10:53] placed
[1:10:55] he's a
[1:10:57] son he's differing nothing from a
[1:10:59] servant but he's still a son so that's
[1:11:02] why you can have sometimes uh things
[1:11:05] that seem confusing but you know we want
[1:11:08] to mature and be fully properly
[1:11:11] placed and be robed in his righteousness
[1:11:14] and be proper sons of God because a
[1:11:16] sinner that is you know when you're in
[1:11:19] the world you're a son you just haven't
[1:11:22] recognized your position and what you're
[1:11:23] heir to okay so anybody here here who is
[1:11:27] a sinner that's Desiring there's
[1:11:30] something in you that's saying I don't
[1:11:31] want to be this way I don't want to be a
[1:11:34] sinner that's because you're a Son of
[1:11:36] God and what the devil doesn't want you
[1:11:38] to know is what the authority of a son
[1:11:40] is and what you're air to he's under
[1:11:43] your foot and so when the water's
[1:11:45] troubled when the Lord's moving you want
[1:11:47] to press in and ask for a revelation of
[1:11:49] what it means to be a Son of God you
[1:11:51] know you want to be born again you want
[1:11:53] to be filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:55] want to recognize that the devil's under
[1:11:57] your
[1:11:58] foot and that that's an experience
[1:12:01] that's a revelation but you know what I
[1:12:02] want more Revelation I want a revelation
[1:12:05] of a body change right I want a
[1:12:07] revelation upon Revelation I want
[1:12:10] revelation and I want revelation through
[1:12:12] eternity it's going to take Eternity for
[1:12:14] him to unfold himself to me and I'm and
[1:12:16] I want
[1:12:17] more wherever we're
[1:12:20] at we're going to want
[1:12:22] more it's going to otherwi there won't
[1:12:25] be an
[1:12:27] eternity it were it's going to go on
[1:12:33] forever just fellowshipping with you
[1:12:36] let's
[1:12:37] uh believe we just read in Ephesians
[1:12:45] uh5 let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2
[1:12:58] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[1:13:00] in trespasses and sins where in times
[1:13:02] past you walked according to the course
[1:13:04] of this world according to the prince of
[1:13:07] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:13:09] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:13:11] among whom we also had our conversations
[1:13:14] in time past and the lust of our flesh
[1:13:16] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[1:13:18] of the mind and were by Nature the
[1:13:21] children of Wrath even as others but God
[1:13:25] who is rich in Mercy for the great
[1:13:27] loveed wherewith he hath loved us even
[1:13:29] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[1:13:32] us together with
[1:13:34] Christ amen by Grace ye are saved and
[1:13:39] has raised us up together and made us
[1:13:43] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:13:46] Christ
[1:13:47] Jesus
[1:13:50] amen we're in Christ our position is in
[1:13:54] Christ
[1:13:55] Christ the devil can't get to you in
[1:13:58] Christ if you're in Christ where's
[1:14:01] Satan he's under your foot this seems
[1:14:05] rather academic but we're here to tell
[1:14:07] Satan you can't have it you can't have
[1:14:10] my joy you can't have my peace you can't
[1:14:14] have my family everything that I'm air
[1:14:16] to in Jesus Christ that he's been that's
[1:14:19] promised to me by this word is
[1:14:22] mine all things
[1:14:25] even the things I can't understand with
[1:14:27] my mind that and it's not up to me to
[1:14:30] comprehend with my mind I cannot
[1:14:33] comprehend the
[1:14:35] heavens but I'm a
[1:14:38] possessor of all
[1:14:41] things the the
[1:14:44] grace that has been given to us all our
[1:14:48] part is to
[1:14:50] believe that that is the Simplicity of
[1:14:52] Our Gospel is it as many as that he gave
[1:14:57] power to become the sons of God who
[1:14:59] believed on him our gospel hasn't
[1:15:02] changed now we believe that the power of
[1:15:07] Jesus Christ separates us from sin we
[1:15:09] don't have a powerless confession we
[1:15:12] don't we're not in the world partaking
[1:15:15] in the things of the world and then
[1:15:17] claim that we're his right because a
[1:15:22] true profession causes a separation
[1:15:26] there's a there's a a life that causes a
[1:15:31] difference that you yourself now know
[1:15:34] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[1:15:36] that liveth in me and that virtue that
[1:15:39] comes out of a believer in his life has
[1:15:41] that's a
[1:15:42] communion with him when you see I didn't
[1:15:45] even know that I could respond that way
[1:15:47] but that's exactly what the word says to
[1:15:50] do thank you Lord for keeping me in that
[1:15:53] situation thank you for protecting
[1:15:56] me and you you you drink up and you push
[1:16:00] out you you you you take in the word of
[1:16:03] God he quickens it to you and it's they
[1:16:06] abiding in your heart and you don't even
[1:16:08] know when the point of time it's going
[1:16:10] to come out but because you've been
[1:16:11] reading your Bible because you've been
[1:16:13] praying because you've been meditating
[1:16:15] upon the things of God because it's in
[1:16:16] your thinking to be
[1:16:19] quickened what what happens you're faced
[1:16:22] with the situation and Christ is put on
[1:16:24] display
[1:16:26] and you can go I into a communion with
[1:16:28] him a Thanksgiving and a fellowship with
[1:16:30] him around the things that he's done in
[1:16:32] your
[1:16:46] life
[1:16:51] amen so as Jesus said this is in Christ
[1:16:54] is the mystery of God revealed paragraph
[1:17:00] 455 and as the father has sent me so I
[1:17:03] send you Jesus said now watch the father
[1:17:06] that sent him went to him to vindicate
[1:17:09] him right for he was the word and the
[1:17:12] same Jesus that sends you goes with you
[1:17:14] and in you to vindicate the same God as
[1:17:18] the father has sent me and I live by the
[1:17:21] father so I'll send you and you live by
[1:17:24] me me what is he he's the word you live
[1:17:28] by the word oh how I'd like to take a
[1:17:31] text on that and preach now for about a
[1:17:33] couple of hours on it see on that how he
[1:17:36] was notice the father that sent me went
[1:17:41] with him the father that sends Jesus
[1:17:43] that sends us goes in a little while and
[1:17:47] the world sees me no more but ye shall
[1:17:49] see me personal pronoun I the person
[1:17:52] Jesus will be with you even in you to
[1:17:54] the end of the World The Works that I do
[1:17:56] ye shall do also now go back and see
[1:17:59] what he's done and then see what you do
[1:18:02] then compare yourself right
[1:18:06] so he he was our perfect
[1:18:10] example and he conquered death hell sin
[1:18:13] and the grave he was tempted in all
[1:18:15] manner as we were and he overcame and it
[1:18:18] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:18:20] in the days of the son of man and as the
[1:18:22] days of lot when a modern Billy Graham
[1:18:24] or Robert went down into Sodom and
[1:18:26] preached to them sodomites and blinded
[1:18:28] their eyes see with the gospel one Angel
[1:18:30] stayed back a messenger with Abraham and
[1:18:33] the elected group and that kind of sign
[1:18:35] did he do and what did Abraham call him
[1:18:38] Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus
[1:18:42] showing that he himself God in him will
[1:18:45] be manifested in his bride in the last
[1:18:52] days you know we fellowshipped on
[1:18:55] what was the image that that Abraham or
[1:18:58] that Adam was made in it was Spirit it
[1:19:00] was Eve was in Adam there's an
[1:19:02] immutability of the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ and it they're saying the same
[1:19:06] thing you go to 22:17 Revelations the
[1:19:09] spirit and the bride say come there's
[1:19:11] not a separation of Jesus Christ and his
[1:19:14] bride they're they're they're one that's
[1:19:17] been declared all throughout the Bible
[1:19:19] that a man and wife they come together
[1:19:21] they cleave to one Eve was in Adam
[1:19:23] spiritual being he took Eve out but what
[1:19:26] was it when Adam looked this is bone of
[1:19:27] my bone flesh is Flesh of My Flesh
[1:19:30] Christ at Calvary when his sight is
[1:19:31] pierced you have water blood spirit the
[1:19:34] same same natural order of the birth
[1:19:37] talking about speaking to a bride being
[1:19:39] taken from the the side of Christ we are
[1:19:42] bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:19:44] flesh we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:47] which means he's present
[1:19:49] here confirming his word to be the same
[1:19:52] all we have to do is take the word of
[1:19:55] God and chop the Satan's head off with
[1:19:59] it you've been given a position of
[1:20:01] authority and imagine you talk about
[1:20:04] taking possession the the scripture
[1:20:06] talks about as a bridegroom coming forth
[1:20:07] from his
[1:20:10] chamber he's you now if you can catch
[1:20:13] the image of that I in my mind I I've
[1:20:16] seen you know you you see these very
[1:20:18] majest have you ever seen a you know
[1:20:20] probably it's probably a two-ton Bowl
[1:20:23] you know them Spanish bowls they're just
[1:20:25] they're just all muscle and and they
[1:20:28] blow in their nostrils just
[1:20:30] go you know and I I've seen these elk
[1:20:33] out in the woods and they're
[1:20:35] just they're just all bowed up and
[1:20:37] they're
[1:20:38] like okay the
[1:20:41] bridegroom our Heavenly bridegroom
[1:20:44] coming forth from his chamber that's
[1:20:46] right to take a bride you know do you
[1:20:50] imagine anybody's like there not that
[1:20:52] there's even an invitation but speak now
[1:20:54] forever hold your peace the devil
[1:20:57] doesn't want to get in
[1:20:59] between that man our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:03] and his bride because if he does he's
[1:21:06] going to get plowed
[1:21:09] over and that you have a bridegroom
[1:21:13] coming forth from his chamber and our
[1:21:16] minds haven't seen
[1:21:18] Gusto but this is someone who's intent
[1:21:21] on taking a possession
[1:21:24] and there is nothing that's going to
[1:21:27] stop him from taking that
[1:21:31] possession
[1:21:33] okay God let that anointing get on
[1:21:36] us we've got to recognize there's a
[1:21:40] possession for us to
[1:21:41] take as the as God's representation here
[1:21:45] on Earth as his bride just as he's doing
[1:21:49] something he's reflecting that in his
[1:21:51] bride we're not meant to be content
[1:21:55] letting Satan squat on our
[1:21:59] land we can't be it it's a it's not
[1:22:05] pleasing and it's a false claim and he
[1:22:08] needs to be kicked
[1:22:11] out and you
[1:22:14] know when you when you recognize your I
[1:22:17] I love the the just the ministry lately
[1:22:19] and and how you have a discovery when
[1:22:22] someone recognizes that they own
[1:22:24] something or what the value is or what
[1:22:26] the possession is and that's really what
[1:22:29] happened in this day right the ministry
[1:22:32] that we've received is one that's
[1:22:34] declared us to be the Spotless virtuous
[1:22:36] bride of Jesus
[1:22:39] Christ and it's placed Us
[1:22:42] positionally by the opening of the seals
[1:22:44] we recognize who we are that's right so
[1:22:48] it's it's it's not a um it's not a work
[1:22:54] that we we've done ourselves but we're
[1:22:56] resting in something that has been
[1:22:58] delivered to us just like the promise
[1:23:00] was given to Abraham his part was to
[1:23:02] believe
[1:23:04] it and then the Simplicity to walk into
[1:23:07] it and then there was a time where his
[1:23:09] faith was tried and let's just um you
[1:23:12] know let's I don't think I ever got
[1:23:14] there let's turn to uh Genesis chap 22
[1:23:18] verse 17 um we'll read a little before
[1:23:22] it and just understand
[1:23:25] uh what what had transpired for Abraham
[1:23:28] to receive the
[1:23:30] blessing is when he's going to offer up
[1:23:32] his son I having received the promise
[1:23:36] knowing that he'd received him one from
[1:23:39] the dead and God was able but this is
[1:23:41] the uh I I'll back up to verse 14 and
[1:23:44] Abraham called the name of that place
[1:23:46] Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day
[1:23:49] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[1:23:51] seen and the angel of the Lord called
[1:23:53] unto Abraham out Out of Heaven a second
[1:23:55] time and said by myself have I sworn
[1:23:58] sayith the Lord for because thou Hast
[1:24:00] done this thing and Hast not withheld
[1:24:02] thy son thy only
[1:24:05] son that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:24:08] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[1:24:10] seed as the stars of heaven and as the
[1:24:13] sand that is upon the seashore and thy
[1:24:16] seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:24:19] enemies we are called to possess the
[1:24:22] Gate of our enemy and we have a our Heir
[1:24:25] is this promise we are the Seed of
[1:24:28] Abraham we are the faith we have been
[1:24:32] made partakers of the faith of
[1:24:34] Abraham because we've received the
[1:24:36] promise we had a a promise come to us in
[1:24:40] this day and being mixed with faith in
[1:24:43] those that heard
[1:24:45] it we are just we've had an angel come
[1:24:48] to us and make a
[1:24:51] covenant and we've we just happened to
[1:24:54] believe
[1:24:56] it there's an end time
[1:25:00] bride
[1:25:02] Hallelujah she's she's robed in his
[1:25:05] righteousness you mean I never did it in
[1:25:07] the first
[1:25:11] place astounding claims there
[1:25:15] David you uh you look mighty human to
[1:25:20] me but there's a faith that's starting
[1:25:23] to cast down yes sir amen and say you
[1:25:25] know what the love of God is greater and
[1:25:30] I know the love that which he loved me I
[1:25:33] can understand what it means to be his
[1:25:35] bride I'm starting to understand what it
[1:25:37] means and it and and I'm not and because
[1:25:40] I understand what it means to be his
[1:25:41] bride I don't want Satan to to claim
[1:25:44] what that he's got a a shoe latch on my
[1:25:46] foot I don't want any stigma of the
[1:25:49] world I don't want to be Satan's poser
[1:25:53] you know we is that that a term anybody
[1:25:55] even uses anymore you know we were we
[1:25:58] were uh probably want to be
[1:25:59] skateboarders ourself and we had this
[1:26:01] term that we used on anybody that was
[1:26:03] trying to write a skateboard and
[1:26:06] couldn't skate we called him a
[1:26:07] poser it was just a term we used well
[1:26:10] you ain't really a skater you're just a
[1:26:12] poser right and you're you're not the
[1:26:15] real thing you're just a poser well
[1:26:17] anytime you allow the smut of the world
[1:26:19] to come on you Satan's making an
[1:26:21] accusation he's like yeah they're really
[1:26:22] not a Believer they're just a poser
[1:26:25] but when you start to understand the
[1:26:27] love wherewith he loved you you start to
[1:26:29] say you know what
[1:26:31] Satan I ain't going to do that because I
[1:26:34] don't want you to even try to
[1:26:36] say I'm going to avoid the very
[1:26:38] appearance of evil I'm not in bondage to
[1:26:41] you I don't have to do that you're under
[1:26:44] my foot you know I I'm not subject to
[1:26:47] that and that's the thing that Satan
[1:26:49] just wants to think that you have to sin
[1:26:52] right he just he just wants you to think
[1:26:55] you have to but when you recognize that
[1:26:58] your life is hid in Christ it's no
[1:27:00] longer you that lives but Christ that
[1:27:01] lives in you and that he through you can
[1:27:04] do the Greater
[1:27:06] Works that's just
[1:27:08] dirt it the things that you once took
[1:27:10] pleas pleasure and are dung there is a
[1:27:13] new birth experience where all those
[1:27:15] things just become equated
[1:27:17] to you recognize them for the fodder
[1:27:20] that they are you realize that the end
[1:27:22] of those things is death
[1:27:24] and you've tasted of eternal life and
[1:27:27] it's the greatest thing that you could
[1:27:29] ever partake in and you don't want
[1:27:31] anything but that to Reign and have
[1:27:33] supreme authority in your
[1:27:36] life and that experience is to be
[1:27:39] had you know it is an inexhaustible
[1:27:43] Fountain and uh I uh I trust that each
[1:27:47] person here has experienced the the the
[1:27:50] presence of the Lord and I will say this
[1:27:53] to whatever degree you've experienced
[1:27:55] the presence of the Lord there's a
[1:27:57] greater degree to experience it and I
[1:27:59] say that for
[1:28:00] myself Lord I want
[1:28:03] more I I want to I want to I want to you
[1:28:08] know the
[1:28:11] uh the things that are on my heart were
[1:28:16] kind of fellowshipping out of the the
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:19] sermon that
[1:28:21] uh possessing all things
[1:28:26] and we had uh just kind of found the
[1:28:29] sermon almost a little before we re the
[1:28:33] service not realiz realizing that some
[1:28:36] of the very things are on our heart we
[1:28:37] in here and we just want to take our
[1:28:40] time we have a little time I believe we
[1:28:41] can Fellowship on this this is um
[1:28:44] possessing all things I believe it's in
[1:28:48] 62 and this is in paragraph uh 58
[1:28:54] says in other words if I'd apply it
[1:28:57] today I'd say the church could sayl
[1:28:59] here's my brother he's laying here
[1:29:01] stricken with cancer he's stricken with
[1:29:03] tuberculosis he's got soand so I lay
[1:29:07] hold of the promise it's my possession
[1:29:11] you've told me so
[1:29:14] amen there you are then you can go after
[1:29:17] the enemy the devil and Slaughter it
[1:29:20] just the same as Abraham slaughtered the
[1:29:22] Kings and brought back his possession
[1:29:24] amen I like that it's to the believer
[1:29:28] yet Abraham had a right to the promise
[1:29:30] and the promise was his yet he had to
[1:29:32] fight to possess it amen there you are
[1:29:35] the very believer today yet we're air to
[1:29:37] all things and we're air to every
[1:29:40] spiritual blessing every physical
[1:29:43] blessing every blessing in the Bible
[1:29:45] promise yet you have to fight every inch
[1:29:48] of it that's the way God's got it set up
[1:29:52] it's the way it's all always been that
[1:29:54] way and you have to fight to possess
[1:29:57] what you know is your own so the very
[1:30:01] first thing and what I've tried to
[1:30:02] establish is it's
[1:30:05] yours by God's promises by his words by
[1:30:09] his word it's
[1:30:11] yours there's nothing that you haven't
[1:30:14] been given Made air to and now you
[1:30:18] fight and there's and you have to now
[1:30:22] now you make just imagine there's
[1:30:24] different maybe ways that we fight you
[1:30:27] know I could understand that you know
[1:30:28] our worst enemies ourselves and there's
[1:30:30] a holding and in our own uh beings and
[1:30:33] subjection and and knowing how to
[1:30:35] possess our own beings and there that's
[1:30:37] that could be a fight of Mastery where
[1:30:40] you hold your but but there's also the
[1:30:43] understanding that there's an adversary
[1:30:45] and there's an enemy and there there's a
[1:30:47] devil that there's to to be withstood
[1:30:49] and he's to be fought and it how do we
[1:30:51] fight him is it
[1:30:54] a gun
[1:30:56] show you know it it we know that we
[1:30:58] don't I it's not we're going to not Flex
[1:31:01] our spirituality we're not going to go
[1:31:03] to the devil and be like you know it's
[1:31:05] been three weeks since I've last sinned
[1:31:08] and you have no right to
[1:31:09] me I it sounds funny but he wants us to
[1:31:12] approach and based off our worthiness he
[1:31:15] he doesn't want us to use the true
[1:31:17] weapon of our word Warfare which is the
[1:31:19] word of God and when you take this
[1:31:21] message this is the word of God
[1:31:24] and and there this is the authoritative
[1:31:27] thus sayith the Lord word of God that
[1:31:29] puts Satan in his place and declares him
[1:31:32] defeated and it put it on display there
[1:31:34] was nothing that would come up before
[1:31:36] our Prophet that he could not cast out
[1:31:38] and cast down that's right and and and
[1:31:41] he would even and he would go at Great
[1:31:44] Lengths to try to teach people that hey
[1:31:47] that Devil's not going to stay here he's
[1:31:49] got to go now your faith you're going to
[1:31:52] have to believe
[1:31:54] when he comes back around but standing
[1:31:56] on the authority of being a Son of God
[1:31:58] he taught us what that means the devil
[1:32:01] doesn't have a right he doesn't have a
[1:32:03] place he can't even stay there and he
[1:32:05] even said hey man sometimes I probably
[1:32:07] got in trouble for telling the devil to
[1:32:09] go when God was using that for a purpose
[1:32:12] but that's because the authority of a
[1:32:14] son is
[1:32:15] absolute and when we recognize the
[1:32:17] authority we have as
[1:32:19] Sons I mean the devil gets scared so the
[1:32:22] he doesn't want you to recognize the
[1:32:24] authority you have as a son and the
[1:32:26] position you have in Christ because
[1:32:28] you're going after what belongs to you
[1:32:31] and when you recognize the power of
[1:32:33] possession that it belongs to you and
[1:32:36] that becomes a you start to let it
[1:32:39] marinate a little bit you know you you
[1:32:42] ever kids are amazing
[1:32:46] mine
[1:32:48] mine we don't even act like children
[1:32:50] sometimes when it comes to the things of
[1:32:52] God we don't even want to sit there and
[1:32:53] go
[1:32:54] mine well unless she comes with babes I
[1:32:57] mean maybe you need to get a little bit
[1:32:58] of mine in there and be like wait a
[1:33:01] second that's mine that's
[1:33:03] mine that's mine and that's maybe all
[1:33:07] you can do is just say mine mine mine
[1:33:11] you know eventually it'll
[1:33:13] work I mean you ever seen a parent
[1:33:15] that's just give it to
[1:33:18] him just give it to
[1:33:21] him doesn't matter what the right thing
[1:33:24] to do
[1:33:26] is doesn't matter if it's theirs or
[1:33:30] not give it to them because I need
[1:33:33] peace there's a little bit of wisdom in
[1:33:35] that the unjust judge right but you know
[1:33:40] this is uh you know the Lord reflects
[1:33:42] himself in amazing
[1:33:44] ways but we do we want to have a little
[1:33:46] bit of a m in there there has to be a
[1:33:49] little there should be an edge to the
[1:33:51] believer I'm not giving place to the
[1:33:55] devil amen and I'm not going to glorify
[1:33:57] his claim and and not only do I not want
[1:34:00] to lift the devil up and give him any
[1:34:02] power that he does not have that's not
[1:34:04] doe him any Authority any honor I'm not
[1:34:07] going to give him anything that that's
[1:34:11] his desire is to be lifted up above the
[1:34:13] sons of God and I get it you do a really
[1:34:15] good job but you're not going to have
[1:34:17] place in my life but more than all more
[1:34:20] than my desire to not lift you up I
[1:34:23] don't want to dis discredit the price of
[1:34:25] Calvary and the completed work that
[1:34:27] Jesus Christ did I'm not going to
[1:34:29] discredit the victory that was one I'm
[1:34:32] not going to discredit the power of the
[1:34:34] Resurrection I'm not going to discredit
[1:34:36] that death hell and the grave have been
[1:34:39] defeated in Jesus Christ that's my boast
[1:34:43] as Christians what are we declaring the
[1:34:45] Resurrection Life how do you know he's
[1:34:47] alive he's living in
[1:34:52] me and and how do I know that that I'm
[1:34:55] not entangled in the things of the
[1:35:02] world
[1:35:07] Amen this is a paragraph 83 in the same
[1:35:11] service he says oh my how I like that
[1:35:14] Believers promise you say what's that
[1:35:16] got to do with us to every believer the
[1:35:19] believer's promise is eternal life the
[1:35:21] believer's promise is life joy peace
[1:35:23] longsuffering gentleness patience fruits
[1:35:26] of the spirit Divine Healing a dozen
[1:35:28] things I got wrote down here nearly that
[1:35:31] is in your possession it belongs to you
[1:35:33] but you cannot have it until you fight
[1:35:36] for it it's yours and everything that
[1:35:39] seen every temporal thing that's seen
[1:35:41] belongs to me God give it to me because
[1:35:44] through Christ he gave it to
[1:35:47] me so our boast Christ has done it
[1:35:52] all the thing all and things unseen
[1:35:55] belongs to me amen I like that what you
[1:35:58] can see like Divine Healing so forth
[1:36:00] like that that's good we appreciate that
[1:36:03] but the
[1:36:04] Unseen and I like this now science can
[1:36:07] probe around here and say well let's see
[1:36:10] let's take the this man you said he was
[1:36:13] healed let me take him down and examine
[1:36:15] him let's see me see what happened and
[1:36:17] you say you had a tumor once sir yes
[1:36:21] right there well let me give a
[1:36:23] scientific research and see if that just
[1:36:24] didn't sink in and didn't go away I I I
[1:36:27] really appreciate that cuz science will
[1:36:29] come up with an
[1:36:31] explanation when God supernaturally
[1:36:34] delivered the now
[1:36:36] science is not saying it was a work of
[1:36:40] God they're going to
[1:36:42] testify by what they could see and you
[1:36:45] say you were once blind and now you see
[1:36:47] how I do how do I know that let me
[1:36:49] scientifically look and see it now they
[1:36:53] could Pro around on that and yet I'm air
[1:36:55] to that too amen everything physical and
[1:36:59] when I'm not air to the things that it
[1:37:01] can't seen where science can't probe
[1:37:03] amen unseen things amen I'm air to that
[1:37:06] yes sir the things that can be seen I'm
[1:37:09] air to that the actual Earth I'm Heir
[1:37:12] you're an heir every believer is an heir
[1:37:15] he's an heir to it all right then the
[1:37:18] things unseen possessor of what heavens
[1:37:21] and earth amen all things you believe
[1:37:23] believe that
[1:37:25] amen all things now uh just the page
[1:37:30] before I I recommend you go back and
[1:37:32] read this service listen to it but uh
[1:37:35] you know I I just looking at it here on
[1:37:38] the
[1:37:39] page he talks about dancing in the
[1:37:42] spirit and he says and brother Bram
[1:37:44] talks
[1:37:45] about uh well I'll just read it You'
[1:37:49] seen one time I used to think about
[1:37:51] dancing in the spirit see somebody
[1:37:52] standing dance in the spirit now I've
[1:37:55] seen the
[1:37:56] mockery put on it but I've seen the real
[1:37:59] thing
[1:38:00] too amen so I come to find out why could
[1:38:05] people dance in the spirit well I never
[1:38:07] seen one yet get out of the way I never
[1:38:09] seen one act immorally I always see it
[1:38:12] just as decently in order and sweetness
[1:38:15] and even Sinners run to the Altar and
[1:38:17] get saved when it's going on well I
[1:38:20] wonder why it was and I come to find out
[1:38:23] it's
[1:38:30] victory David danced before the Lord
[1:38:33] when the ark was brought back to its
[1:38:35] resting place and I could go on but I'm
[1:38:37] going to tell you
[1:38:39] something hey how many sister people
[1:38:42] know Sister
[1:38:43] L well you know I I've been around a
[1:38:46] little bit I used to go over to
[1:38:48] Louisiana and stay with Brother David
[1:38:50] buts when he was a bachelor I remember
[1:38:52] Sister L play playing the flute on the
[1:38:55] platform and at brother Tim's old church
[1:38:57] out there in the woods and you know her
[1:38:59] testimony of a sister she's just one of
[1:39:02] the you know I she a very softspoken you
[1:39:05] know even when I got around my wife's
[1:39:07] family kind of reminded me of when I
[1:39:10] first met her you know it you kind of we
[1:39:13] talk us Irish a little loud and run into
[1:39:16] some people are softspoken and you you
[1:39:19] realize you got to kind of adjust your
[1:39:20] ears and listen a little bit and I don't
[1:39:22] mean to I'm talking about Julia's family
[1:39:26] but uh sister Lana is just very humble
[1:39:29] sister very sweet and I would say just
[1:39:33] the nature of Christ and that's not
[1:39:35] someone you would expect to go dancing
[1:39:37] around the church you know I might have
[1:39:39] some little
[1:39:41] Irish Groove and think I've got
[1:39:43] something and go jump around um and I
[1:39:46] could maybe do something after my nature
[1:39:49] or after but when the spirit of God
[1:39:52] moves and there's true Victory there's a
[1:39:54] real Victory and there's a real dance
[1:39:57] and it isn't carnal and I I get moved
[1:40:00] when I think about that there should be
[1:40:02] victory in the camp not put on but
[1:40:06] there's nothing wrong with it when the
[1:40:07] Lord gives a victory and we shouldn't
[1:40:10] mock it there's mockery but there's a
[1:40:12] real
[1:40:13] thing and uh that's a testimony I I just
[1:40:17] moved by that I hope she doesn't mind
[1:40:19] but I know that what the Lord did was
[1:40:21] heal her of cancer and when the re
[1:40:23] Revelation
[1:40:24] struck they have a you know they they
[1:40:26] got that X-ray and it's got cancer
[1:40:29] eating up her body and now without any
[1:40:32] evidence the victory strikes and she
[1:40:35] recognizes she's healed and she just it
[1:40:39] happens she's running around the church
[1:40:44] Victory and I pray that there's victory
[1:40:47] in the
[1:40:48] camp amen and if the Lord Le you know if
[1:40:51] he leads you to dance that's wonderful
[1:40:53] but it's something to be understood our
[1:40:55] Prophet marveled at it right but he
[1:40:58] understood what it
[1:41:02] meant this is a we'll try to finish it
[1:41:05] up here paragraph 97 same sermon and you
[1:41:09] an heir to to bradam tapel no I'm an
[1:41:12] heir to All Things both seen present
[1:41:15] future to everything I'm an heir to it
[1:41:17] and every sin and wickedness has been
[1:41:19] put under my feet by the grace of Jesus
[1:41:22] Christ he rose on Easter morning
[1:41:24] triumphed over death hell in the grave
[1:41:27] and made me an heir and said wait Yonder
[1:41:29] and I'll give you the promise and his
[1:41:32] anointed authoritative servant said the
[1:41:34] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:41:37] and to them that are a far off even as
[1:41:40] many as our Lord Our God shall call I'm
[1:41:42] an heir amen let's just have the
[1:41:45] musicians
[1:41:47] come we're an heir to All Things
[1:41:51] Saints and as air we have to take
[1:41:56] possession you know
[1:42:01] even one day is you know the Lord
[1:42:05] terries as we take a body change that's
[1:42:09] going to be something that we're taking
[1:42:10] a possession of I'm now air to it he's
[1:42:14] promised me a new body though this
[1:42:17] Tabernacle but though this be
[1:42:20] dissolved he's got one waiting for me we
[1:42:23] understand that that is a
[1:42:26] promise and I'm aired to it but you know
[1:42:29] that we've got to take possession of
[1:42:31] it there's a fighting there's a
[1:42:34] contending and the Victory is all his
[1:42:38] it's a victory that he's
[1:42:44] one maybe we could uh play that song uh
[1:42:49] he of Salvation purchase of God born of
[1:42:52] his Spirit washed in his
[1:42:54] blood this is I think maybe that's this
[1:42:56] is my
[1:43:01] story but that's an ultimate Victory one
[1:43:05] day we're going to step out we're going
[1:43:08] to take a new
[1:43:11] body and we've got a foretaste of that
[1:43:15] now it's beating in my heart I I I've
[1:43:19] received an Earnest that I'm not going
[1:43:22] to always have to deal with
[1:43:25] this this flesh the the Life In Me Is So
[1:43:29] real
[1:43:30] saints and it moves and it has its being
[1:43:33] and the communion it has in the word is
[1:43:35] so
[1:43:37] real but there's things now that we've
[1:43:40] been given to take possession of that's
[1:43:43] in the realm of the
[1:43:45] scene some of its
[1:43:48] sickness some of it's
[1:43:51] just habits
[1:43:54] you know me I I I feel convicted about I
[1:43:58] it may sound trivial but I you know my
[1:44:01] my yard's a wreck my shed's
[1:44:04] dirty and I've got to there's going to
[1:44:07] be an act of taking possession of that
[1:44:10] and saying I'm not content with this
[1:44:12] stain this way this is not a
[1:44:15] representation as a Christian that I
[1:44:17] want to have and there's going to be an
[1:44:20] act yes of throwing the junk out of
[1:44:24] cleaning the shed out and I'm going to
[1:44:27] have to take these hands and these feet
[1:44:30] and I'm going to have to possess my body
[1:44:32] and my
[1:44:34] being in 1
[1:44:36] Thessalonians 4:4 and you could read
[1:44:39] before and after but it says that every
[1:44:42] one of you should know how to possess
[1:44:44] his vessel in sanctification and
[1:44:48] honor Lord let us possess these
[1:44:51] vessels with the Authority that's been
[1:44:53] given to us as sons of God you gave a
[1:44:57] Adam dominion over the air and you've

[1:45:09] and I know it might be a
[1:45:11] fight I know that it's going to take a
[1:45:14] little bit of effort but I'm not going
[1:45:16] to allow other atmospheres to rule in my
[1:45:18] home it might be a fight may be not a
[1:45:22] comp physical confrontation it's not who
[1:45:24] has the loudest voice but I'm going to
[1:45:26] start setting an atmosphere you might
[1:45:28] just walk in the home and I'm going to

[1:55:04] what a position what a place I I don't
[1:55:08] know about you as our brother was
[1:55:10] preaching I I just feel like I was ready
[1:55:11] to fight you know just like you know
[1:55:14] thinking about everything I've let go
[1:55:17] and everything that you know you know
[1:55:19] after you've been in the battle for a
[1:55:20] while you get a little bit soft s you
[1:55:22] know I feel like we've gotten a little
[1:55:24] bit we've lost our Edge a little bit you
[1:55:26] know you know and Satan wants that he
[1:55:29] wants you to start compromising you know
[1:55:31] after you fought and you start avoiding
[1:55:33] punches and new things and no we are the
[1:55:36] army of the Living
[1:55:38] God you know what I mean we we don't
[1:55:40] need to let any ground go we need to
[1:55:42] possess every ground you know I thought
[1:55:45] you know if Caleb was here what he what
[1:55:47] would he tell us you know what would he
[1:55:50] tell to us and just tell us what what
[1:55:52] what are you guys doing and you know you
[1:55:55] guys are not close to my age and you're
[1:55:57] giving up already and and you look tired
[1:56:00] and you look exhausted no the word of
[1:56:03] God is supposed to make us look younger
[1:56:05] and vivify us and and when we hear it my
[1:56:09] goodness we think about everything that
[1:56:10] the devil is taking and we go out of
[1:56:13] here ready to go to fight you know we
[1:56:15] don't come to here so we can go well you
[1:56:17] know I'll just continue to pray until no
[1:56:20] I'm going to fight I'm going to take
[1:56:23] over I'm going to take what belongs to
[1:56:25] me and and I'll say this you know I've
[1:56:27] always thought about this message you
[1:56:29] think about that we we forget he's given
[1:56:32] us all things but the reason he wants us
[1:56:34] to fight for it is because he wants us
[1:56:37] to have the fellowship with him so we
[1:56:40] can taste what it means to win a victory
[1:56:43] so this is not just something that's
[1:56:45] given on the platter where you come and
[1:56:47] and because if you get it that way
[1:56:49] you'll be scared to lose it now what is
[1:56:52] said he said okay come on up I I have
[1:56:54] fought and I've already won I just want
[1:56:57] you to come on with me now and I will be
[1:57:00] with you I would win inside of
[1:57:04] you and yet we all compromising here and
[1:57:07] let it this go and let it that go you
[1:57:10] know it's like the devil making a deal
[1:57:13] with Moses it's like well why don't you
[1:57:14] go and leave the children behind and why
[1:57:17] don't you go and leave the cattle behind
[1:57:18] we're not leaving anything
[1:57:20] behind it if it's ours I mean just go
[1:57:24] home tonight and find somebody in your
[1:57:27] house and you just oh you know it's okay
[1:57:29] you can just stay there and I no you're
[1:57:31] going to kick him out I I don't care if
[1:57:34] you don't have any strength
[1:57:36] automatically because it's your home
[1:57:38] you'll feel entitled to kick him
[1:57:44] out but what I'm said it's not the size
[1:57:47] of the dog in the fight but it's the
[1:57:49] size of the fight in the dog
[1:57:55] you know we don't fight just for us we
[1:57:57] fight for all of us you you see the
[1:57:59] devil attacking somebody you see this
[1:58:01] over here you see over there I don't

[1:58:24] a lot of years now I'll let the young
[1:58:26] one fight no if Caleb by 80 years old he
