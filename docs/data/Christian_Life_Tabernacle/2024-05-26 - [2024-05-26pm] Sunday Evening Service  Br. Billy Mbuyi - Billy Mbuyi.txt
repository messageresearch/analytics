Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that is a body change for the believer amen let's just B our heads our gracious father are we so thankful Lord for the things that you do for us Lord to be gathered here as a small group and but father as a in the numbers of those that you have called in the end time oh God and your Prophet will say that there will be a people that shall not test death and that there will be change from this life to the other life oh God and Father one day they're just going to work up and it's going to be that day in that morning where we'll be changed and from the twinkling of an eye Lord and Lord God that's what we live for father Lord there's nothing that wor to us more than that oh God and to be constantly living in your presence oh God and for that great day where we're going to cross over we commit everything we are to you Lord we ask that you give us the grace Lord you give us the mercy that we need in order for us to continue in this fight and father if we fallen short somewhere forgive us and strengthen us once again Lord that we may continue in the battle Lord we know that it's you fighting this battle Lord and it's not even us it's you using our hands and using our feet and using our mouths Lord we pray that you continue to use us for the glory of your kingdom once again remember our pastor and sister lesle and be with them oh God and come and speak to us the words of Life Lord we heard you this morning but yet we are here Lord we ask just one another drip into our cup Lord and to fill it up once again Lord because you promise to be the everpresent water Lord that we're going to drink from you Lord and and we want want to drink until we are full Lord until we can burst open and there's nothing but the word itself we love you and commit what we are into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen man good to be gather once again in the house of God Amen I was uh telling the brothers in the back I said uh we already have our meal this morning so we're just going to try to give dessert tonight and and and uh you know I felt like the brother the expectation were growing and growing and I was over there trying to just bring it down so I'll just pray that uh you know we're going to try not to be too long and uh just uh preach what we have in our heart and move forward amen let's open our Bibles in the Ephesians chapter 6 the same scripture we read last time Ephesians 6 and 10 amen I'm many to enjoy the word this morning amen amen that was tremendous amen I I I believe that's what the word of God is given for we come in when the word is preach we go out feeling like we have get we have gotten what we need in order for us to go overcome amen you know but makes a statement about the ministers and it said they are God's dress wear and it says the battle is Raging out there and Satan is over they just bombarding the people all the time but when you come to church when you come when you read your Bible when you read when you listen to the message that is God using his ministers to strengthen you so you can go and do battle and I believe that that's what I felt like this morning I felt like we were strengthened Amen to go out of here Victorious 6 and 10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might putting the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the V the the the Wilds of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness uh of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickness wickedness in higher place it says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God not just part of it the whole of it everything that is said that you may be able to withstand in the evil day it says and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loin G about you with the truth and having on the bless the breast print of righteousness and your feet sawed with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of Faith where withth ye shall be able to quench the all the fierce Dart of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of Faith which is the word of God let's also uh uh uh turn in first uh 1 John chapter 4 we just just going to read one verse uh uh verse four it says ye are of God that's right little children and and overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats tonight so like I said when I this morning and and perhaps to change my direction a little bit by hearing what we heard this morning you know bam speaks and he says we we live in the hour of identification and if you think about it and you look uh outside you know the world this is for the first time in Mankind's history where man is not afraid uh uh to express himself for everything that they are I growing up even he's a young person you know the at the time to hear people speak about almost sexuality was something unheard of and even if that existed it was so those people they hid themselves they didn't want to express themselves fully and openly and and as it is today in other words we've come to a place where people have such a boldness and I'll say Satan has a boldness to come and flat out just reveal himself for who he is and they would press and they would in fact it's the law it's known as the law of the minority trying to change the ma majority so it's the very few of them they're trying to influence the majority to believe what they are people are they identify as we heard this morning with whatever they want to identify some animals some objects some everything and they give themselves you know identify as he she him him them and all of those things just confusing you like where were there you know when uh English was being taught at school and and it it's like people have a boldness to just come out and say those things like it never was before and he shows you the time and the season in which we are living in and Bam says that the world will get darker and darker it'll get worse and worse and we are seeing those realities before us and I want to say this if Satan is bold enough to come out of the closet and do that then there has to be a people bold enough to come out of whatever you find yourself in to express yourself to because God promised that there will be a believer at the end time he didn't ask I don't know uh will there be a believer really no God predestinated a group of people to stand here in the face of the evil that's here today in the face of the darkness that's here today and represent God for the fullness of who he is amen and let me even say this Satan came and he took Eve out of he deceived Eve out of God's Eden that he created with all the Perfection God in the end time is sending a word to come to say Satan's eeden he says oh you say oh it's dark and it's all kinds of things and God said it's in that dark time it's in that confusion time it's in the time where the things that you're hearing you can't believe with your own ears the things that you are looking at you can't believe with your own eyes God said it's in that time that I'll have a people called by my own name it's in that time that I'll have a group of people that will stand and they will still represent me we we are not afraid of the devil we are not ashamed of what we believe in what we believe in is the word of God is the true reality of what we promised will happen at the end time he promised that the darkness will be there and there's Darkness out there but he also promised that there shall be light in the evening time and there's going to be a people to stand and represent that light so we find out so people come and they identify themselves and I want to say this the the end time message is your identification oh I tell you this I didn't know who I was before I received this message I was in all kinds of sin and even when we were in religion the only religion we know was whether if you were catholic you thought there were three uh uh uh three gods and you were part you all kinds of just nonsense and all those things and if you were in some kind of religion All you thought was oh sinner is me I need the mercy of God and and God came and you looked at Jesus sitting up there on his throne and he died for me I'm here trying my best that I could and so I can be right so I could be accepted and every time you did wrong and you felt like your sin was being weighed in the balance oh I did wrong today I'm going to go to hell and I need to do more right so I can balance my wrong oh it's not until the message of the hour came by my way it showed you that he has nothing to do with that it showed you that's the Trap of the devil that you are predestinated and called to be a son to begin with whatever you are doing is something you are trapped into it but the reality is your heart wants to serve God the reality is God plac a seed in your heart there's not enough darkness that can cover it and when you heard it you say that's what I want to be you say I I don't want Darkness there's no desire for darkness in my heart my my heart wants to see light and my heart wants to see God manifested my heart wants to see the fullness of God dwell in me so he brought you the original identification that God had for you in the beginning the Devil by deception the prophet will say he came and he caused Eve to fall and and yeah you were uh because of the Fall you were born in sin and Sheed in iniquity and and and carried with you the nature of human and and picked up all that there is with human all the failures of human all the thinking of human all that they could all the nonsense of humans that's what you carried with you but it wasn't until you met the message of the hour it wasn't until the revelation of this word came by your way that you begin to realize that I'm not really what I thought I was I'm not really what I thought I needed or what I was and what I desire of the things of the world my heart wants God what was it God bringing you to you your identification at the end time the world called you as we heard this morning oh you're just a a worker McDonald's worker like we're heard oh you're just a teacher you're just an engineer whatever you do you're just a whatever your trade is you're just a carpenter you're just this and and and and we put more value into that we go around when somebody ask you who are you that's the first thing that come out oh I I what do you do who are you I'm this and we say proudly this is what I am but the word is announcing to you that before you were a carpenter you were Son of God before you were a teacher you were a Son of God your original ident ification is to be a son that's why it's important when we live our lives we understand that everything else that we do in the flesh is supposed to be secondary that the true the true identification and motive of living is to represent Jesus Christ is to know that I'm here as the bride of Christ I'm here to be the light to this dying generation it's not to be caught up in your job and in the things that you need to do how much money you can make and let me tell this tonight that's what the world is after the the identification of the world today oh I I want to be like an Hollywood star and I want to be like this great YouTube uh uh uh uh uh celebrity they call them I want to be like this and you'll see it and all they do is Flash money left and right and flashh success but behind they're committing suicide behind it they're not happy behind it there's all kinds of nonsense go greed going on they killing each other there's trapping each other and all kinds of things happening they don't have the happiness that you think that let me say this there's only one happiness and that's in Jesus [Applause] Christ let me tell you young people what you see on YouTube is not true I I have seen people and I'm like they look happy all the time what happened they it was just putting up a face to attract you so you can click more and they can get more money but yet they got the money but they're still not happy money never brings happiness the more money you have the more problem you're going to get the more Fame you have the more trouble you're going to have oh but if you can have the Lord Jesus in your heart it will bring you peace that surpasses understanding it will bring you Joy that surpasses understanding if why because you are candidate for the Rapture why because there's something that tells you that if this world is gone I have another place that I'm going but those people this is the only thing they have so the prophet will come and the the so the end time message the prophet is sent to open our eyes to show us that we are more than what the flesh is is that there in us there is something that's worth more than just what the flesh is looking like that's why you never judge a person by what they can have Earthly speaking they just because a person may not have a good job or they may not have enough money you don't judge them by that you judge them by their character by What Spirit lives inside of them you judge them by what they have because in them there's a Soul that's worth 10,000 World why because in them there's a God there's a living God that lives within them so he came to show us that you are more than the flesh you are more than your job you are a predestinated son of God you have been place here for the predestination and the manifestation of the end time that God has in his store so the prophet will the word will speak and say therefore let this mind be in you that was also in Christ and I ask you tonight what mine the scripture says that he Tau it not robbery to be equal or identified with God being in flesh being Immortal going about with a man who would get tired a man who would need to drink and and need a place to sleep he says let it be let that mind that was in him be also in you why because while he yet still had the identification of the flesh but he knew that within him there was the Living God that dwells inside of him he didn't identify himself according to his flesh but his identification was where he came from he taught it not robbery he taught it not out of place or not something out of reach you a son of God well I am but you know I have this flesh you know you know the scripture speaks we do the Greater Works I don't know how I'm going to get through the Greater Works so you think it's robbery to be equal with god oh well you know I have but I don't know if I can be that kind of God I don't know if I can get that type of of of be that kind of person that can really pray for the SEO that can really do the Greater Works and you know I'm probably just called to come to church and go home and no that's not the god that I'm serving because if you say that then you break the promise and the scripture says the scripture cannot be broken because you have to understand it was God's purpose in the end time and let me say this tonight there's no reason for you to be defeated tonight you have no right to be defeated why because Christ came and he paid the price of sin he paid the price of your sin and everything and how you came as a human he paid for that he paid for that so you can have the right to step in and say I'm a Son of God am so by you saying that I can't you are selling short the very price that he paid why because he paid that price so you can claim what belongs to you and let me say this in his first coming when he came it was for the purpose of paying the price he came he died on the cross he spilled his blood he did all of that for the penalty of sin something had to be paid but after he paid but at the opening of the seals as the prophet will tell us he's coming for the second time for the claiming work in other word he's coming for to take what belongs to him to take what he died for he's not coming to ask he's coming to claim it so a son say Daughters of God we don't go to the devil oh the devil please give it to me please leave my son alone please leave my wife alone please leave my children no we come to kick him out we come to kick him out we have been given the authority to kick him out why because we have been empowered by the word to kick him out huj but whatam says the end time when the Holy Spirit come to the end time is for hunting not for just looking for hunting is to come to drag you out of sin to drag you out of whatever you are in why because if you are predestinated to be a son there's nothing that can stop that God is going to lay you down on your bed he's going to lay you on your back until you come in that's right but yet we are in we make all kinds of excuses and the reasons why we can obtain so we are living in the time of identification what was in the beginning what was in the M God's mind in the beginning for this age God is bringing it into manifestation and the spirit of God is here calling out the elect out of the church coming out from among them and be separated that's the cay of the hour God God is calling out a people for his own for his name's sake God is continuing is here to take people if people call out from remember the scripture will tell us that at the age of laoda Jesus was found outside of the church and therefore he's now personally knocking at each door and he that would open he will come and S with him so the world as we would say will will speak and he will say yeah we are we are living in a time where the world is constantly influenced and the world is coming and and and yet they are being influenced by the deception of the devil to be in the situation that they are in because they have rejected the word and all they have left is deception of the devil dragging them left and right and he will take and it will sprinkle a little bit of Christianity in it it will say well because I go to church that means I'm saved because I pay my thighs that means I'm saved no you're not be because I'm there every day no you're not you must be born again you must have the spirit of God moving in your being you must have something inside of you that's dragging you to church something inside of you that God has deposited that's been Birth by the word of God something that desire to please God every day something that he himself selfish place inside of you that helps you overcome the things of the world but will speak oh I like this in the message Jehovah jar it says paragraph 51 61 02:26 it says no man can come to me no man can come to me except my father draws him and I like that because I believe that's the very Foundation of a Believer it's not something you build yourself it's something that God done and then he says all that the father have given me will come it says will come will come will come to me what it says what are you scared about what are you afraid he says well you say well maybe I'm not the kind of Christian I'm not the I'm not the right kind of Christian he answers back and says how can you come to God without God calling you first think about it it's just as simple we we skip over the we we try to find and it's almost like we resolving like a a geometry equation oh well maybe I'm not the the right kind of a Christian he said well how can you come to God without God calling you first it says and all that he forew he has called is that right all that he has called has he justify is that right all that he has Justified he has Al he has already passed had glorified amen it's a finished work from the foundation of the world you you're not the one starting to work you're not the one starting to show God that I'm interested in coming to you no this is a finished work from the beginning God chooses the place God chooses the time God chooses the season to attract it to him we are fighting against a finished work and you know what happened you're going to lose because it's not you that started the work it's not you that will finish the work you are just part of the work that's happening he that started the work will finish the work we let me let me even say this this work was completed before you can even be made known in the [Applause] flesh but yet we are we are fighting as if we have anything to do to change it no it's finished it was done in his mind before it could be spoken he was already done and when he spoke it he confirmed the finished part of it so when you come the only thing that can happen is you'll be swept by the work the work that called you the work that came and dragged you out of sin the work that preserves you every day it's the work of God that's in the [Applause] work it says Christian don't you see you are living under your privilege you don't know who you are we don't understand that it's a finished work we we don't understand when we come to this word we we are not and I like the word that our pastor using to discover what we are what's happening in our lives is we are trying to come into the realization because God promised to do something but we don't know by which way he's going to do it we know he promised the end we know what the end is going to be but he chooses the path by which he's going to get you I was thinking as I was translating for brother Paul here he is he's talking about this woman who came and and out of the middle of nowhere she came and and Jesus being sitting there with the dirty feet and nobody's taking care of him I I've always thought about that woman as a predestinated woman that God brought into existence for that woman one time now but for her to get to where Jesus was she had to have a way to get there so but her life because she was a prostit god allowed for her to be a prostitute my brother my sister you don't know the kind of God we're serving he let her be a prostitute for one reason he let her be a prostitute just so that when Jesus will sit here with dirty feet that woman can come Minister unto her but yet we get caught up by which way we came in oh we we we look at each other by the way we came in the way you came in doesn't matter what matter is what God did for you it didn't matter whether you were a drunker whether you were a prostitute whether you were a robber whatever you did that doesn't matter that's just the way that God was trying to bring you in by but once it's done bringing you you are a perfect son you know different from one that never seen the day in their life that's the message of the hour so you don't judge a person because they were drunker because they they smoke drugs or because of the past life you judge a person by what God predestinated him to be let me get to my subject now oh man eternity is all around [Music] us so we read this and but Matthew read it this morning that quote that we read last time about the Invincible Army it says now remember Christ in the church is a continuation of book of Act and the Book of Revelation showed us uh that that the Christ spirit will come into the church and defiles it defile it it said making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan it says he exposes Satan revealing his work attempt attempted destruction of the God's people and the destruction of God's word right down to the time where is cast down in a lake of fire it says if fights that he cannot stand it he can't he knows that if the people gets the true revelation of the true church and and what she is and what she stand for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army now we we said this and I I would just want to before I can uh uh not going to be too long just be patient with me for a little bit so it was that we said the importance but will say the importance of Revelation can not never be overemphasized so we cannot talk enough about Revelation because God deals with us by Revelation so you didn't come to the message because you compare the message and the Bible and you find out that everything was lined up then you say well I'll believe this message because it's the closest thing to the Bible no that's not how you came in when the word was preached to you something struck your heart Revelation came to you revelation God revealed it to you before you can even know where he was so that's how we come in so that's the way and that's the way God wants to walk with us every step of the way so that's why it's not revelation that knowledge no it's Revelation by Revelation by Revelation it's God continually revealing himself to us so if you find yourself falling short of something what you need is the revealing of the part that God needs to Quicken so you can overcome it so you don't need to go and educate yourself and find 10 step to do this or 20 step to do that what you need is the quickening power by Revelation to Quicken you so you can overcome why because when God makes his word a reality there's not enough devil that can stop it when God touches the hearts of a man a man can stand against an army like Moses who would with all the education that he had he would by Revelation turn around and come against the greatest army that there was on Earth and look like a fool but why was he doing that it was by Revelation why because something struck his heart he met the pill of fire himself so there nothing that you could have tell him to stop him the reason we are defeated is because we go by knowledge by our own understanding but let God reveal it to you I tell you there's not enough proposition I can s in front of [Applause] you I told Brother Gary I was not going to scream but I am I told him I was going to try to be cool as a cat but I'm losing it already so that's why we pray for Revelation and it's God adding to our revelation God adding when the our Perfection is moving into the Revelation it's not moving into knowledge by Revelation so when we read we we pray that's why we we don't read even as to just gain knowledge our reading is in prayer so it could be Quicken so it could be something that could be useful to us if it's by knowledge when when tragedy or when something Struck it will forget it you you'll forget it but if it's by Revelation it will strike something and something will speak back let me move on the scripture tells us that men of old they were moved by the Revelation the scripture says they were moved by the spirit of God and they moved by the spirit of God they spoke things they didn't have understanding they they they spoke it says says if they knew what they were talking about they would have never said it but what was it it was God by Revelation moving inside of them Against All Odds Against her understanding because they were moved by the spirit of God they spoke it anyhow the man if you go read Hebrews 11 it was a revealed people that God revealed himself to them and they were willing to stake their lives why because it was about Revelation so let me say this and I want to say this so it's by Revelation that this word has been given to us and when we have that understanding that what Satan is trying to do to the church therefore by the same Revelation that we understand what the devil is trying to do it gives us the power to withstand what the enemy is trying to do do I'll tell you this you can know what the enemy is trying to do if you don't have Revelation he's still going to do it because there's no nothing that can stand against it that's but if you know it by Revelation when it comes you can stand and fight against it why because you have been now empowered by the word of God you have known your position and you've known what God Revelation is good God giving to a Believer part of himself for him to stand there and speak the word and know that God will back his word out that's why could say if God told me that they will raise is it George Washington that I'll tell the whole world really I mean could you not let it reason a little bit no if it was by Revelation it was revealed to me that God will do that I'll stand up and say it why because I know I'm not speaking my own word I'm speaking his word and when I speak his word he will stand upon his one word so he knows he knows that if people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what you stand for that she can do the Greater Works she shall be an invincible Army and if we get the true revelation of the true Spirit within the framework of the Church of the Christian church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her and I want to say this we can certainly say by the revealed word of God that we have receive we can certainly declare that tonight we have received the true revelation of what the true church is amen amen it's not a mystery amen amen it's not a mystery the true church is Christ's Bride for the end time the true church is Christ himself in the form of his own bride the true church is God let me just say this is The God Who overcame the devil in heaven The God Who overcame the devil in the body of Jesus Christ that's him God wants to overcome the devil in your flesh it's not your battle it's him he wants to overcome he wants to defeat the Devil in every form that he can find himself that's the True Church the true church is a called out people separated people that the word of God has called out of the world and out of denomination what God himself is revealed himself to that's why denomination can never produce it why because it's just the teaching and the knowledge and intellect being imparted but never coming into the realization of what God is trying to achieve but whatam says now Satan will constantly punch at you until you are finished here on Earth just remember that you will never have a time but what which your punch there will be punch going on because you are in the battle did you ask to come to Christ uh to go into a picnic he says well you are sure going to be Sur surpris because it's it's a constant battle it says you've been uh I've been in the field for 31 years I fought every inch of the way that's right Israel had to fight every inch of the way the uh it says the Palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it now let me say this Satan is always there to challenge every promise we claim we have that's you just open your mouth and say thank God I got the Holy Spirit oh my goodness I mean you were fine until you declared it the moment you declare it he's going to uncover every Rock anything to show you you don't have you know the moment to bet comes in your mind you see I told you you didn't have it the moment you commit a mistake oh you see and you claim to have the Holy Spirit the moment why because that's that's who he is he's the accuser so he's the opposer of the Revelation he knows that if you believe by Revelation you will overcome him so his job is to torment you his job is to continually fight against that so you never come to the full understanding so you just say oh praise God I'm Healed oh goodness there he goes and buckets of symptoms starts to pour in oh you said you were healed didn't you oh what is that back pain coming from oh maybe it was that surgery that didn't go well maybe it was what you testified about and now you got to go now you are a liar you got to go and correct it no I'm not correcting it praise the Lord if God told me I'm Healed I'm Healed it doesn't matter how many symptoms still around if God told me I'm safe and I was dipp in the Muk it doesn't matter if he reveal it to me he that reveal it to me will take me out of the m and will testify of his own word the problem is we put ourselves inside of it we place ourselves between God God and Satan we're trying to help God prove his word no God proves his own word in fact let me just jump to the end butam says God will have to create a situation that looks impossible for him to prove his word otherwise if it's just a small situation then how do we know he's proving his word no he will have to take like a Noah and there's never been a rain before there's never been a drop of rain before it will call him in and say it's going to rain so everybody can look at him and say you are crazy and God will say Come On Son I know there's always going to be every time you stand on the word there's always going to be things that you're going to have there's always going to be challenges you're going to have to overcome every time there's always going to be a ridicule that's going to come let me say this anybody that's ever stood upon the word you're going to have to endure ridicule you going into the Rapture Rapture somebody will have to ridicu that so people will ridicule and Noah will just be there and building his boat in fact his boat is been built away from where the water is so how are we going to pick up this boat and take it to the water who's going to help you because everybody's laughing at you right but God knew he said come on on son just build a boat I told you to build a boat don't worry about it just build it and Noah will just go day in and day out and just build his boat and oh my goodness he became the laugh of this the the city and the laugh of the town and everything oh but that old man that's building a boat yeah go over there you know if you go there you make a right thing you get to work he became the reference of the city oh but one day one day God told him son it's time get into the boat he got into the boat he closed the door and let me say this perhaps there were those that were hanging around trying to figure out is this man really crazy or may he be right so let's just hang around and find out what's happened they waited and waited nothing happened they made the decision and say that truly this man is Crazy by the time they made that rank him down why because God will prove his word with the Believers what one I'm says God is looking for one man one man one person it it doesn't take all of us just one of us one of us in the presence of God say I believe your word that's [Applause] enough one person by that living children God will come and say ah now it's time but when I'm says when Joshua when they came and they were told to go and cross Jordan it says it looked like it was crazy because God chose the time where Jordan is actually flooded if they had waited just couple of months or if they had just gone before they were going to cross on foot so somebody lost their mind they showed up at the river like and now I'm thinking about all the people that were there of course in a crowd there's always Believers unbeliever make Believers oh they always part of the crowd you will never miss them they're like what did you say again they like well they said we're going to what what month is it again he said April yeah did you did you guys know that there's going to be snow that's going to melt like well we don't know I mean you know he's the leader I mean he told he told us to come we just come in like well who who told who told him to come in here it's like so what what do we do now now I'm talking about Joshua we do that all the time with our own self God told told you you are healed and you begin to question was that really healed I mean is that really I mean maybe oh God told me I'm he maybe I need to go down so they can pray for me the second time but why don't you pray for me again well you know you believe God yeah you are healed just go on he said well no maybe the third time you know God is perfect in three you know let's come on let's go we do that all the time A promise is given to you it's not your business to stand and manifest a promise it's not your your your your position to go and defend the promise your pro your promise or your place is to believe the promise your place is to confess the promise your promise however crazy let me say this don't mind looking crazy in front of people don't mind that because the same God he's going to come and vindicate you after you've looked crazy and let me say this God is looking for crazy people [Applause] anyway he's not looking for people that can reason it all out he's looking for crazy people the doctor told you you're going to die you looked at him and say I'm not going to die the doctor looked at you said you won't have a baby you said I'm going to have a baby the doctor looked at you and said you can't do this right you say you a liar it's going to [Applause] happen if you don't mind being crazy then you won't see God manifesting you got to be crazy enough to believe this then The God Who CS you to believe this will come and vindicate your [Applause] craziness God tells Joshua yeah he is in the battle and he said goodness I need more Sons I don't want Darkness to come I got to finish up my enemies well science says it's actually the Earth that grows around the Sun you know that's why we all be taught but I can this man ask and say son stand still which geography book did he read where did he get his reference from but the crazy thing is it happens why because when he s there what he spoke he spoke the word of Mighty God he asked for God and God came and Vindicated his word let me say this don't mind looking crazy you just have to believe what God Said God is the owner of the word and he's the one who's responsible to bringing it to pass don't take responsibilities that don't belong to you we take responsibilities that don't belong to us did God said you're going to prove his word no he said he will prove his word by you in fact the prophet said the prophet said God will predestinate a Believer someone by which he can bring his word to come to pass someone who's happy enough to believe the crazy someone like John Ryan oh praise God I'm heal John Ryan come on man you come here I cut your hair but why don't you just shut up because you making yourself look crazy right now because you're not heal you still blind it says extra extra I'm Healed extra extra I'm Healed they're like well okay since you don't want to listen we'll just make you the the the the the but of all jokes so come over here and says hey hey have you heard that man in my barber shop he says okay come he says JN Ryan can you say again what did you say he says well he says what happened he says well I went to that church over the other day they prayed for me and and praise God I'm here and as he was just about to laugh at him his eyes came open what was it God God proving his word how however crazy he was it didn't matter there was a God by which let me say this let's be crazy for [Applause] god let's be fools for god let's be crazy for him because he's the only one who can vindicate our craziness others will reject you with your craziness but he will come and take your craziness and break it a reality he's proving his word by his believing children what is he doing he's making them an invincible army yes they stood there and because why he's trying to prove to you and I that it's never about a man it's always about the word it's never about who it is it's just a believing child it doesn't matter how difficult the circumstance look in fact God wants the circumstance to be impossible because if it's somewhat then we'll get confused who did it he wants it to be absolutely impossible he waited until Abraham could not have a child he waited until Sarah's womb was dead he waited until Lazarus was completely dead not just dead but he's not sunk and when the noi showed up you're like oh if you just came two days earlier if you just came before I know if when you came if if you came when he was sick I've seen you heal the Dead the sick on we said well how about when he's dead he says well I I know at least that I've seen you raise the dead too but I never seen you raise the dead who's been buried and whose nose is sunk he says well I am the resurrection and the life why he was there to vindicate his word he said Lazarus s and Lazarus was not dead so therefore when he shows up he's able to bring him out of the death but whatam says death knew its Master that's right and the Soul knew its creator when he spoke that voice yes Lazarus came for what was he God proving his word showing his children hang on to the word never get tired of it I don't care how much fun people make of you you stand on the word at the end you will be the one laughing God bless you if the musician can come he's going to prove Rapture by you and that's a promise that is given you say well I seem to just fall and come back don't worry about it you just continue to discover his word let this word work on you let this word work on you at the end when Rapture will come you'll find yourself on the other side you say how did I make it you made it because he's proving his word you didn't make it because you had the best left there is no you making it because he said you'll be [Applause] there let's all send as a musician come I like that kind of God he doesn't take it and put a burden on you go go figure it out no he said yes how we're going to divide it your job is to believe my word it's my job to make you an invincible Army your job is to constantly testify your job is to make sure that you never have a negative testimony your job is to never have a negative word come out of your mouth your job is to constantly stand there whether you are ridicule or not you just continue to stand whether you want to come 10 times to be prayed for you come he said you continue to come you continue to come it's my job to to show that what you are believing is the truth it's my job to come and take you from what you were and change you into what I want you
