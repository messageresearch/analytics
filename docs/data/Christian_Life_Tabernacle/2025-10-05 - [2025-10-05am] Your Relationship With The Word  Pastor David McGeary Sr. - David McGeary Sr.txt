And we fail to remember that all this earth and everything creation is all spoke to your glory. Father, we just know the enemy tried to switch that glory to him and create an Eden that man loves, Father. But we know there's an original Eden that we're going to return back to. Father, we just hope that sinks so deep in our hearts and our mind, Lord, that you're coming soon for your church. We ask you to be with us and help us this morning. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to Matthew, the uh fourth chapter of Matthew. And uh and we'll we'll read. Did I I I think I left my glasses, Billy, in the or Gary in the office there. I'm not going to get too far without them. Um I think I in the last few weeks I I kept saying that the uh the family picnic was on the 19th, but it's the 18th. So, uh that's the Saturday. So, uh, we surely encourage you to come out to that. See if I if he's getting them. They're somewhere in there. My office is a mess. I'm re remodeling it. So, well, who's got a pair of glasses? Phillip, you need hands laid on you. So the well make sure Jeff gets back to his seat. All right. Let's read here this morning. So this is a great a great scripture and blessing for us because I think we all go through trials and temptations and then to actually know that the Lord himself went through trials and temptation. It's a blessing to us. It says then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Jesus was led by the spirit &gt;&gt; into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes we just think the spirit's all peace and joy and fluffy and no troubles. No, I'll tell you, he's tempted. It's it's how we handle the temptation. And this is what you want to see. We won't go into all the the the meat that is in this, but watch how he handled the temptation. It says, "And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was afterward and hungered. And when the tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command these stones to be made bread." You know, first of all, if thou be the son of God, you don't have to prove to nobody who you are. &gt;&gt; You are who you are because God made you who you are. And you'll never prove to an unbeliever that you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz he don't believe you. &gt;&gt; No matter what you do, &gt;&gt; he don't believe there's such a thing. &gt;&gt; He doesn't believe there's a bride. He doesn't believe there's a people that are forgiven of their sins. So he he tempted him. And so Jesus never explained to to him, tried to prove to him he was the son of God. He answered and said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, least any time thou shall dash thy foot against the stone. Now, this is Satan quoting scripture. Amen. And Jesus said unto him, it is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And again the devil taketh him up into an exceedingly high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. And said unto him, All these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me. And G then Jesus said unto him, "Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." And the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto him. Amen. Hallelujah. God these give those to Jeff. Amen. God bless you. May be seated this morning. If I I had a little thought um this morning, I would call it your relationship with the word. your relationship with the word and you know a relationship is not a knowledge you know I know a lot of people I have business associates and I have uh friends and I have different uh people that uh you make contact with But you wouldn't say that you have a relationship with those people. You you understand? Because a relationship is something that's interactive. It it it it's not just a one-sided uh affair. You know what I mean? In other words, it relates. It you relate to a person. And you you you communicate and and and they give you and you give them and it's a kind of an interaction something that you understand something that uh you identify with and you connect with and and you so you say well I have a relationship with this person. In other words we connect. You know what I mean? Uh uh we not only connect but we communicate. we we have fellowship. We uh we we we we can share and and I receive from that person. That's why you would say that, you know, I have a relationship uh with Sister Lesie, you know, because uh you you know, she provides for me and and and for her and uh you know, if I start to get a little uh radical in in one area, which I'm prone to do, uh she kind of throws on the brakes, you know, and says, "No, it's not that bad if you know if that's the worst thing that ever happened to you in life. You know, you're doing pretty good. And yeah, you know, she kind of brings me back into balance a little bit because I'm prone to be overbalanced. You know what I mean? Uh I would say that, you know, you you sometimes you have tend to tendencies to be a little fanatical and you need somebody that just holds you back. You know what I mean? and says, "Come on, it's not," you know, or you know, um, uh, you know, she'll always point out to me if I get mad at somebody that has done something, uh, get pulled in front of me, you know, she'll just say, "I bet you did that a bunch of times, you know, and uh, you know, you just kind of have to grin and bear, you know what I mean?" But you have a relationship and it's important to have a relationship with the word. So when we uh we were studying and reading out of the message harvest time and when I sat back and I tried to take a look at the whole message as a whole I thought what is it really what brother Random's trying to say you know and sometimes if you're have a tendency to be critical or you have a tendency to be negative. Uh, and the message attracted a lot of people who were critical and and negative because it called out a lot of things. And and sometimes if we're not careful, we're attracted to the negative. You know, people uh are attracted to things that strike out and things that fight and and things that put down, you know, and call stuff out and and and so, you know, like even in politics, you know, the whoever can sling the most mud on the other person, you know, this guy's good, he's for this, he's terrible, he's terrible. and and you people are attracted to negativity and and uh that's something that we never want to get involved in is having our relationship based on negativity. A a good relationship isn't one that's based because we both hate the same person, you know, or we both hate the same thing, you know, and it's all based on dislike and and you know, and people just join together and they connect together on negativity. And you know opposing something is good but you can't let that be the whole existence of your life. And I thought well so you know it wasn't that the prophet of God was speaking a against so much denominations. It wasn't that he was speaking so much a against the the things that were uh weren't correct in in uh Pentecost and different places. But really what it came down to, what he was speaking the most of, it was speaking the most of the importance of the word of God was the relationship with the word that that people were drawn off to emotions and feelings. They were drawn off to uh uh certain like gifts and things. And he's talking to the Pentecostal church at this time. And he said they were drawn off to these things, but they they left the word. &gt;&gt; So, and and so that's what he wanted to reestablish that it was the word. And I thought, well, why why is this message called harvest time, you know, uh becau, you know, and you know what a harvest is? A harvest is when it's time when the it has become ripe &gt;&gt; and and it's come to a maturity that it's got to be plucked. &gt;&gt; And so he's preaching to a a denominational world who the people have creeds and dogmas. They have certain methods of worship, certain forms of doing things. They've assembled themselves in all kinds of different groups based on all kinds of different doctrines and teachings and ideas. And the the church world laid out separated amongst themselves and and Christianity begin to build themselves and and form themselves on the ideas of man instead of the word of God. Now they use the word of God as we saw Satan use the word of God on Jesus. He says it's written, &gt;&gt; you know, if you do this, &gt;&gt; you know, cast yourself off of here and the angels will come bear you up. At least you dash uh a uh your heel, you know, against a stone, you know, and and he he trying to work on him and trying to force him and and trying to push him in something. But Jesus knew for what cause that he had come into the world. &gt;&gt; You understand? He had a revelation of who he was. That he was the lamb of God. He went and sat with the priest. He went and went through the things he had studied in the synagogue. So he knew who that he knew who that he was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand? He didn't have to prove to Satan who that he was. &gt;&gt; That wasn't what he didn't he didn't have to prove that he was a believer. He didn't have to prove anything. He just said to him, he says, "It's written, don't tempt me. Don't tempt the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; There's I'm the lamb of God that's come into the world. I'm the sacrifice of the sin for my kinsmen. It is written of me that the cross lies before me. It is written that I'll lay down my life for my sheep and that I'll take it up again. It is written that I'm going to go prepare a place for them that where I am they may be also. So he understood who that he was. He understood what that his calling was. He understood what that his purpose was in life. And when something came to draw him away from that purpose, &gt;&gt; it didn't matter if he tried to use the scriptures to draw him away. He was misplacing the word of God and he said he said don't don't tempt me with that. It is written thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. In other words he was saying I am act I am fulfilling the word of God. This is God's plan. This wasn't God's plan for me to fall off a pinnacle. It it it wasn't his plan that I create bread to eat. It wasn't his plan to do that. So, Satan always was offering him something other than the word. &gt;&gt; It's what he always does. He always offers something other than the word. And so the we understood that the that in this last day and I think we can relate assuredly and a positively this morning that the scripture says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. I think we can say uh beyond of a shout of as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be. So when the world got in a condition uh uh uh uh like like Noah's time and when the world got in a condition like the time of Sodom when when we could look out and see that the season you understand of of the world the season and the condition in the skies in the surroundings of us just like the seasons that you come and and you know, you plant in the spring and the summer and and in the autumn and the fall you harvest and in the winter you store up, you know, and and so you you you see the pattern in the natural and then we look back and we can see the pattern in the spiritual that when the world gets in this condition, it's the time that God is going to harvest out his elected. &gt;&gt; So, he's going to harvest them out. So, it's the harvest time is the time of the harvest. And so, as he sits there and he's preaching to a convention, he's preaching to people of all different faiths. They've assembled together uh in like a full gospel businessman setting. There's Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians. There's people from all kinds of different persuasions, and they all have all kinds of different interpretations of the word of God. And they're all pursuing different avenues and different viewpoints. They all have they all have their emphasis on what their program is or or what their uh mission is and and and what they feel uh it takes to be saved and and they're they've moved off of the relationship with the word of God. They they've substituted their relationship with the word with works, &gt;&gt; with worship, &gt;&gt; with advancement. They're measuring. They begin to measure their success by how large their church had become. Uh how many members that they had, how that the talent had risen up in their church and and how what their production was. And and as we know today, so many of churches are not so much uh involved in the word of God as they are involved in worship &gt;&gt; and and worship's good. We just sang worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know what I mean? But that's that's a result &gt;&gt; of your relationship with the word of God. So, you know, to really understand sometimes to understand the depth of what it meant for God to send Malachi 4:5, the fulfillment of that scripture in our day, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, the scriptures that God promised to fulfill in this day. We we never can forget to recognize the day that we're in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To be able to sit back and recognize the day. Now, in my day, when I grew up in high school, there we we never ever talked about anything that would have to do with gender identity. You know what I mean? Or uh inner uh whatever. Yeah. Same gender marriage. &gt;&gt; I mean those were not subjects that that would have to cross your path. You know what I mean? uh uh there was there was a even a moral standard that existed even in the American culture and in the United States and and and what there were there was a time that you couldn't say the even the smallest swear word &gt;&gt; on television. &gt;&gt; The the word hell was only used in church. You know what I mean? You would never hear that word. But something has decayed &gt;&gt; our civilization. &gt;&gt; It it it's it's it be begin to unravel &gt;&gt; and more and more things were being accepted. And as things of the world were being accepted, the word of God began to diminish. Because everything that's in the word is contrary to what's in the world. And everything that's in the world is contrary to what's in the word. &gt;&gt; And God wanted to return his church back to the word of God. that could we we can't forget that this morning, church, that really what we're based upon is not the fulfillment of the promise itself, but the relationship of that promise in the word of God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that that how can I say this? It wasn't the man that fulfilled the promise that the emphasis was placed on. It was the promise that was fulfilled that the re the emphasis is placed on. In other words, it was the word. God said that he would send in this last day a vindicated prophet to restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of their fathers. What would they going to restore him to? Back to the word of God. That's what he wanted. That's what his message was to the church. You we've got to come back to our relationship with the word of God. &gt;&gt; That is the most important thing for the believer is to be connected with the scriptures, &gt;&gt; to be connected with the word of God, to have a relationship with the word of God. that every word of man be a lie and my word be true. &gt;&gt; He's bringing he he he it wasn't that the people didn't love the Lord. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the people weren't worshiping the Lord. They weren't praising the Lord. He wasn't he wasn't preaching against the gifts moving in their midst. But what he wanted to start to point out is that some of these gifts are are operating but it's not according to the word &gt;&gt; and the the establishment that he really wanted to establish back what he was trying to harvest. &gt;&gt; You understand? out of the church world, out of all these different ideas. He was trying to harvest the elected seed that God had put there for that age because it was time for that seed to come to maturity and be harvested. &gt;&gt; So it didn't matter where you found yourself in life. It didn't matter what your past was. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what your association was. It didn't matter what your affiliation is or what your failures were. Many of you know my testimony. You know, I was a hippie. You knew I grew up in California. You know, I ran around with motorcycle guys and rock musicians and all that. But none of that was laid to my charge. That's right. Because by the word of God, my eyes were open to the truth. &gt;&gt; They were open to the word, &gt;&gt; to the fulfilled promise of our age. &gt;&gt; Wasn't by anything that I done. It was by the grace of God. It was by the Isab that he provided this age. And he provided his blood to cover my sins. and a white garment that I could my go my my garments could be white as snow that I could become different and I could become changed. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't changed just for the sake of change. It was changed for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It it was a call &gt;&gt; in our lives back to the word of God, back to the fellowship and the relationship with God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to REMEMBER THAT'S THE BATTLES in your mind. &gt;&gt; All kinds of thoughts come in. All kinds of temptations come in. All kinds of ideas come in. All kinds of plans for your future come in. You're continually battling. What a day we live in. There's so much information out there &gt;&gt; and 99 and n10 of it's a lie. &gt;&gt; It It only feeds one side of the picture. have to and God wants to harvest &gt;&gt; of people that are going to return back to the relationship of the word. &gt;&gt; It wasn't taking the word of God and bringing it in to what already existed. That's not what it was going to do. it. He wanted us to understand that when it the time of this age came and when the church made its journey from Pentecost into the ground and then back up again, the very first word began to speak out through Luther when he said, "The just shall live by faith." And he began to preach and and he began to say, 'N no, you don't have to give dollars to have your sins forgiven. You don't have to light candles to have your sins forgiven. You don't have to say rosaries to have your sins forgiven. He said your sins were forgiven on Calvary by the blood of Jesus Christ. And if one sinned, then one died for all sin. JUSTIFICATION. WHAT A MESSAGE in its day. &gt;&gt; Think of it. People were going into a little box, confessing their sins to the priest, going out and lighting candles, and never could be free from sin. Why? Because they never applied the blood. But once the blood was applied, they understood what sin was. And when they failed, they understood that they could run right back and say, "Aba, Father, forgive me." And if they were righteous and faithful and just to confess their sins, God was faithful and just to forgive them. And then Wesley came along and said that's that is true. But not only do we have to accept the forgiveness of our sins, we have to start living a life that of sanctification. We can't keep doing the things that bring us back into sinful condition. We've got to separate from those things. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't be free from rock and roll and keep listening to rock and roll. &gt;&gt; I mean, it it don't work. I mean it, you know, it I mean I I hate it when I I I go into a restaurant and they'll have some music playing and I'll get in my truck and that crazy songs playing in my head. &gt;&gt; You know, I ask, "How did you get in there?" &gt;&gt; And how do I get you out? Well, my secret is I just take a good old Christian song that I like and I replace it. &gt;&gt; I'll just keep singing that Christian song. You know, I know it was the blood. I know it was the blood. I know it was the blood for me. One day I was lost and I died upon the cross. And I'm just in my truck just uh singing it because I'm getting that dude out of there. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear no hum diddy do's going on in my brain. &gt;&gt; So how he brought us to sanctification, &gt;&gt; you know, let's let's apply sanctification. Let's apply the token. You got to continually do it because he's continually getting in. &gt;&gt; I got a pest control guy. He comes and sprays the house, you know what I mean? And does all this stuff and sure enough, one of them little things will show up, you know, and what do I do? Do I say, "Oh, I've treated this house." No. What do you got to do? You got to treat it again. &gt;&gt; You got to keep them out. &gt;&gt; You got to keep throwing them out. You got to keep cleaning. You don't wash the kitchen once, right? Or maybe some of you do. You know, maybe you got a lot of bugs. I don't know. Maybe bugs don't bother me. How many sisters love cockroaches? Oh, you don't keep them in a jar and let them live in your cupboards and you know, you know what they say? They say they don't hurt nobody. They always run away from people. They only come out at night where they don't bother you. They're really not so bad, but they give you the creepy jebies because there's something about them that's not clean. Well, how about that on the spiritual side? &gt;&gt; All these things are the world's keeps trying to put cockroaches in your ex experience. &gt;&gt; La cukarachas. Right. That's what he's trying to do. He's He's trying to get you off path, get you distracted, you know, get you he just keep he keeps coming. Wesley came with sanctification and they realize we've we've got to start separating from ourselves from the things that are damaging our spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. Really, what he's talking about is a relationship with the word of God. We've got to have a relationship with the word of God. And then men sat at sought after gifts. They read in the Bible. They saw where they spoke in tongues. They saw where they laid hands on the sick. They they saw these great things. And and and so they they went after those things. They prayed for those things. And then we know this, the spirit fell in in the form of a restoration that that people began to speak in tongues and and they begin to prophesy and and they begin to worship and they they knew what it was to be filled and touched with the spirit. Not just intellectually, but they actually felt the presence of God in their lives. They knew they were different. They they they were filled. The spirit was in them. They they they were in a cold, dry, formal way of living. They just they read their sang their songs out of their book. They they read their Sunday scriptures. Uh they they live moral lives. They went to church on Sunday, but that was all the more that they looked for. That's all that they were hungry for because they were told that that's all there was. And then some people begin to realize there's more &gt;&gt; than just believing and living right. People wanted to do something for God. They wanted to feel led of the spirit. They wanted to feel the freedom. They wanted to feel a personal relationship with the Lord. They wanted to know what it was like to have the uncction of the Holy Spirit to to to speak to their hearts and say do this and and and and and have a burden. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on their heart for somebody. &gt;&gt; Bake such and such a cake. Bake such and such. Pray for such and such. Go visit such and such. that uncction of the spirit was moving in their lives and and they they they felt the leadership and the presence of God and they worshiped him and and that was a desire of their heart. But the desire of their heart began to lead them away from the word of God. Do you understand that they were now feeling an uncction to do things that were contrary to the word and we begin to understand that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. their relationship with God's word began to diminish and it was based more on what they felt than what they received. They begin to turn from the word of God for leadership and they begin to turn to their feeling. And our messenger came out and he said, "He never asked you if you felt it. &gt;&gt; He asked you if you believed it." The anointing became a major emphasis. I feel anointed. I feel the presence of God on me. It's like when the high priest, he slapped Paul and the guy come out and said, "How dare you revile the high priest?" You know where did the spirit go when it left me? And Paul said, "Oh, forgive me. I didn't know he was the high priest. I would have never reviled the high priest." Paul just covered himself with the word of God. It was the word. That's what the important part for the believer and especially the believer in our day is to get back with the word of God. The relationship with the word of God. And so, Brother Bman, of this message, he he makes it a a a clear distinction. He said Jesus says man shall not live by bread alone. So he he was simply pointing out there was two types of bread. There's the bread that feeds us. Big category. I just don't mean wonderb bread. It's a wonder you can live by that stuff. But it was all the natural things of life that we live by. He said, "Man can't live on that alone." &gt;&gt; And you can't because if all you do is eat natural, whether you eat every health bar, there is, every drink, I've seen so many advertisements now. There's things I can wash my hair with, I can eat, and all my hair is going to grow back. I got another bread that's going to grow my hair, Brad. &gt;&gt; So, he pointed out there's two kinds of bread. There's the natural bread that we live by. &gt;&gt; The we we work, we eat, we do. But no matter how well you eat, no matter how many hours you spend at the gym, there's one certain thing, this body is going to run out. &gt;&gt; I don't care. You can go all back through history. You could tell me who crossed the Delaware. You can tell me who never told a lie. You can tell me all these great men and and you know who are the rough rider and you know who done this and who done that. And every single one of them has a monument. They have something on this earth that reminds you that they were there lest they be forgotten. There's a rock fella center there. There's this guy's name on this law school and that law school and that place. Everybody is trying to uh put their emphasis on on this life. in this short period of time that they're they'll be immortalized. They they what's their legacy? What are they going to say about me when I'm gone? &gt;&gt; And and they put all their effort into the natural bread. &gt;&gt; George Washington wants you to learn about him in school. Davy Crockett wants you to and Stephen F. Austin and and Buoie and the Alamo. While you go to school in Texas, you got to take Texas history. You got to know about Santa Ana. You got to know about San Cedro. You got to know about this. You got to know about that. You got to know about Longhorns. Yippi cay. Why man is trying to hang on to this life &gt;&gt; and then there's another bread, the bread which cometh down from heaven. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. I am the bread that cometh down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Any man that eats me shall live. Bread is meant to be eaten. &gt;&gt; The word of God is meant to be eaten. That's what he was trying to do for the church. He was trying to get them back to the word, back to the Bible, back to the scriptures. This is where he wanted us to get back to, &gt;&gt; back to the word, &gt;&gt; back to a relationship &gt;&gt; with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Where this becomes your leader. &gt;&gt; This becomes your guide. This becomes your absolute. What he said is how that it is, &gt;&gt; not how IT APPEARS. BECAUSE HE WANTS to have a relationship with the word of God, the bread of life, not the bread of the world, but the bread of life. He wants to have a relationship with the word. And what is the word? is the the word is God's thoughts expressed. &gt;&gt; Another it's what he said. If I could say it this way, it's what he thinks. It's what he will do. It's his description of a world different than the world you're in. &gt;&gt; You're living by You're living by something different than what the flesh is living by. You're not living by your job. I've had several. You don't live by that job. What happens when you lose a job? You call Indeed. &gt;&gt; You find a head hunter. You read the newspaper. You look for another job. You don't live by that. God don't want us to live by that. &gt;&gt; He wants us to live by his word. &gt;&gt; The word of God is meant to be eaten. He's He's calling us back to a relationship with his word. So the word of God is his thoughts expressed. His spirit is in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you can get an anointing outside the word. &gt;&gt; You can get a feeling outside the word, &gt;&gt; but the word of God is ever true. &gt;&gt; The word of God is God's vision for you. He gave you the word so you could be a partaker of that word &gt;&gt; and you could be a reflection of him &gt;&gt; in this earth &gt;&gt; his spirit in his word. So when you take the word of God and you live that word, you take a promise of God. He said in Peter that he has given us these great, it's Peter 2 Peter 1:4. He's given us these great and exceeding precious promises that by these promises we might be partakers of divine nature &gt;&gt; and escape the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Or the bread of life, of natural life. and that we might through these promises believe God's word, live God's word, OBEY God's word, take what God said about it, and follow in that path. And when you take that word, the spirit of that word, &gt;&gt; the obedience to that word produces the spirit of that word in your life. &gt;&gt; So you're not LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OUTSIDE his word. You're looking for something that's in his word. Now you want to rejoice. &gt;&gt; The word of God says if we'll confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive them. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have the seed of God in you and you sin, it's a terrible burden. &gt;&gt; It's a ugly feeling. You get sick. &gt;&gt; You shake your head. How could I do that? How could I fail? How could I have done that? Oh, &gt;&gt; and you can undo it. &gt;&gt; You can't undo it. You can go back. You can try to cover it up, &gt;&gt; but you can't undo it. and he knows you did it and the spirit's convicting you of it and you feel the burden and the weight of that sin. But he said, his word said if you'll confess that sin that he would be faithful and just to forgive it. And if you've ever sinned and you've went and you've confessed it sincerely with your heart &gt;&gt; now you've entered into that word. You've taken that word that now becomes what you're feeding on. You say you said if I confess this sin you'd be faithful and just to forgive it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. &gt;&gt; IT WAS MY FAULT. &gt;&gt; I can't go say, "Oh, Lord, I didn't mean to do it. IT'S GREG'S FAULT. IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. &gt;&gt; REPENT. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; I'm guilty." &gt;&gt; But he said &gt;&gt; he'd forgive you. and throw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more. &gt;&gt; And you go there, you accept that word. Now, your relationship is built on the word, &gt;&gt; not built on what anybody else said. &gt;&gt; It's built on what he said. He said &gt;&gt; he said &gt;&gt; he didn't say I had to give a history of it. He didn't say I had to write it down. He already knows. Lord, you know what I'm here, what I've done, and what I'm confessing. &gt;&gt; I'm taking you at your word. Now your relationship is with the word and so you say I'm sorry. And then when he fulfills the promise of that word which is I'll be faithful and just to forgive it. And when he forgives it, takes that burden off of you, throws it in the sea of his forgetfulness to be remembered no more against you, and you experience that. YOU TALK ABOUT THE JOY BELLS RINGING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know, to see the word of God, what you asked, what he promised come to pass to, you know, to see his hand on your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll cause you to praise him. &gt;&gt; It'll cause you to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Thank him. &gt;&gt; A amen. the spring of the well within you begins to bubble up again. &gt;&gt; You're back in love. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with every promise of God's word. &gt;&gt; It's by the promises of his word that you become a partaker of divine nature. They began to want to partake of the spirit &gt;&gt; and in doing so they walked away from the word and all his whole heart's desire was don't get away from the word. &gt;&gt; It's fine the spirit moves in you but let it be done according to the word of God. That's, you know, and I I YOU'VE GOT TO read your Bible. &gt;&gt; You've got to go through it page after page and line after line and verse after verse. You've got to see Jesus in every verse of the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's the bread by which you live on. You don't live on the rain. &gt;&gt; The rain washes you. The rain refreshes you. But you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. You've got to become so singleminded &gt;&gt; where that you live by the scriptures. &gt;&gt; You become a scriptural word &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; That's what he's looking for. THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO HARVEST. That's what he was trying to bring out. He says, "I know there's a people here &gt;&gt; because God planted them. &gt;&gt; It's in their heart &gt;&gt; to return back &gt;&gt; to the scripture, &gt;&gt; to return back to the Bible." He knew if they returned back to the Bible that the Bible said Malachi would be here. He knew if they returned back to the Bible that they would see this as it was in the days of Sodom Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; They would see the ministry in the word. God is trying to get our relationship back to the word of God, back to where we live by the word. If the word says no, we say no. &gt;&gt; If the word gives you a promise, you believe it. &gt;&gt; Lord, you said by your stripes I am healed. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't have to produce nothing. &gt;&gt; You have your time. &gt;&gt; All things work together for a good &gt;&gt; who love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everything is in its season. Everything has this perfect will. This is what the scriptur is telling you. &gt;&gt; Back to living by this. &gt;&gt; You can't live by saying, "I believe God sent a prophet." &gt;&gt; He did send a prophet. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire, which that's the picture we have, came in this generation. &gt;&gt; God revealed that to us. But when he revealed to us, he he took us on a walk down the road to Emmas. &gt;&gt; When I come to the Lord, &gt;&gt; he took me for a walk &gt;&gt; down the road to Emmas. &gt;&gt; He said, "Isn't it written in Romans chapter 1? &gt;&gt; Isn't it written in Romans 8? &gt;&gt; Isn't it written in Corinthians? Isn't it written &gt;&gt; that I'm faithful and just &gt;&gt; that I'll not leave you nor forsake you. What did we do? I went down a road, walked down the road to Emmas with him where he spoke and he showed himself alive in the scriptures. HE SHOWED TO ME THAT these scriptures that are written here WERE NOW COMING TO PASS IN MY LIFE. IT WAS MY DAY OF FORGIVENESS. IT WAS MY DAY TO BE BAPTIZED with the HOLY GHOST. IT WAS MY DAY TO COME OUT AND BE SEPARATE. &gt;&gt; It was the word. &gt;&gt; He didn't do anything in my life outside of his word. &gt;&gt; I walked with him a while and then he come down. He said, "Let's go a little farther." I promised in Malachi &gt;&gt; that I'd restore &gt;&gt; the faith. I promised in Revelations 10:7 that I'd open the mysteries. I promised in Luke 17:30 that I'd make my presence known amongst the Gentiles when it got in a sodom condition. What was it? &gt;&gt; It was the word. &gt;&gt; I was walking in the word. He was showing me his word. &gt;&gt; And as he showed it, I could see it. As I saw it, it became life &gt;&gt; and life more abundant. &gt;&gt; That's what he was looking to do. He wanted us to believe and live the scriptures. &gt;&gt; We look for power outside the word and the word is the power. &gt;&gt; If God could have given us any other weapon besides his word, he would have done it. And when Satan came to tempt him, what did he fight him with? The word. &gt;&gt; This is really what's trying to be restored. We're not trying to restore Pentecost. Pentecost was a result of what he said for them to do. go in the upper room &gt;&gt; and wait and I'll come again &gt;&gt; and I'll be with you even in you and I will lead you and guide you into all truth. I'll send you the spirit of God and it will bring you into remembrance of all things I've taught. The the writer wrote, he said, 'The Holy Spirit didn't come to speak of itself, but to bring you into remembrance of all things THAT I TAUGHT. HE WANTED THE CHURCH BUILT ON THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; Your walk on the road to he'll walk down that road with any of you. No matter how old you are, you're down and out, he'll come by. &gt;&gt; You're a sinner, you're rejected, he'll come by. And all he could tell you is, "I know you sinned. But if you'll confess that sin, I'll forgive it. I know you're broken, but I heal the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; I bind them up." I know you got angry. Just make it right. And you'll find out that it's by these promises that you're partakers of the word of God. The spirit of God moves in his word. The key to the spiritual life is through the word. &gt;&gt; You pray. You ask, &gt;&gt; he answers. &gt;&gt; This becomes your northstar. This becomes your discernment. This becomes every aspect. This is what you feed on. This is what you live by. And if you live by that word, obedience to that word produces the presence of almighty God. I don't care who you are &gt;&gt; or what you've done. You take God at his word. He'll no wise leave you nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; But he'll be with you even in you till the end. He wanted to build us in his word. I just want to read a few statements in closing this morning. See if I can find them here. Now you talk about a beautiful definition of a Christian. We as Christians are only reflecting him. Well, how are you going to reflect him? You can only reflect him through what he said &gt;&gt; or what he thought. You can't express your own thought and be expressing his thought. If you express his thought, you're expressing what? The word. &gt;&gt; He said we as Christians are only reflecting him. The moon only reflects the sun in its absence. And the believer only reflects the son of God in the absence of the son of God. It's the light of the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's the light of the Bible. It's the life of the Bible. Do you understand? If we can't create a message life by our own interpretations of the message, by the parts of the message we want to emphasize. We can't create a message spirit apart from the Bible. &gt;&gt; They're one. &gt;&gt; It's the Bible life. Don't sit down on a few doctrines. Feast &gt;&gt; read &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; It'll speak to you. &gt;&gt; It'll lead you. It'll guide you. &gt;&gt; Your decisions are scriptural. You're in love with the Bible. You're in love with the word of God. You You look to for it to guidance. You say, "Well, let me tell you, there's nothing in here that's not in here." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There was things that were in here we couldn't see. &gt;&gt; So, God sent a message &gt;&gt; for Isab &gt;&gt; that we could see. It never was a replacement program. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation &gt;&gt; program. &gt;&gt; It was signs and wonders and miracles and seeing the presence of God in our midst to attract our attention to let us know that this God of this Bible is the same yesterday, today, and forever. and that we could live by this word. We could take every promise in this word. Every promise in the book is mine. We could believe it, read it, accept it. It didn't need to be interpreted. &gt;&gt; He was his own interpreter &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass. &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be smart. &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be intellectual. You didn't have to be educated and be a good speaker. YOU COULD SIMPLY TAKE him at his word &gt;&gt; and he would perform that word and you would be in his spirit partaking of his spirit. &gt;&gt; You got a nasty old temper spirit on you. Oh God, help me. Forgive me. Make me new. Cast this off of me. put the love of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; Watch him. Watch him do it. &gt;&gt; Then you talk about rejoice. You talk about being thankful. You're not You're not producing wool. You're bearing it. &gt;&gt; You become that word alive. him in you, the hope of glory. He says it's the light of the Bible, the scriptures being vindicated in our lives. The word that makes light in darkness. The word that makes light in darkness. I know we got French Bibles, we've got Spanish Bibles, we got English Bibles. I guess they have Hindi Bibles. They have how many other dialects we have here? I'm sure there's lots of Bibles. Let's read it. He said, "You are candles that are set upon a hill." That's right. That ain't the sun. It's a candle. The candle just takes the place of the sun. Just shows a certain amount of light. We are God's children. We are sons and daughters of God. Only by the spirit with portion. He had it without portion. We are stars that shining. All of us together make the light to the world. But he is the eternal son that reflects the light to every star. Hallelujah. I believe him. God help my unbelief. That's just like the world is always trying to compare. Don't compare with things of the world. Don't compare with churches. Compare with the Bible. compare with the Bible. &gt;&gt; I looked at myself, I thought, you know something? How often do I compare myself with the Bible? I'm supposed to have a book of Acts following me. You know what I compare? I compare myself with what I believe. I believe this doctrine. I believe serpent seed. I believe this. I believe that. And I thought, well, I'm comparing myself with myself. When you compare yourself with yourself, you don't hate yourself. You'll come up with an angel every time. You'll put a star on your chart. But when you go back to the word of God, And it asked you, did you turn the other cheek? &gt;&gt; Did you go the extra mile? Did you visit the widow and the fatherless in their affliction? Are you a peacemaker? Oh, really? Maybe I'm not doing as all as well as I thought I'd do. It's like grading your own test. You put an answer down, you think it's right, so of course you're going to give yourself a hundred. And and we've we've graded ourselves, but we're not comparing ourselves. Every believer should be able to compare himself with every single person in the scriptures. You want we want the path forward, right? Where is God really wanting to take this church? &gt;&gt; He wasn't just wanting to take us to say, I believe what you fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He wanted to see that what he fulfilled was to bring us back to his word. that that word would live in us and then we would become written epistles read of all men. He said compare with the Bible. That's what we're doing today. That's what's the matter with us Pentecostal church. That's what's the matter with our quartets and singers and so forth as we have. We're trying to act like Hollywood. Hollywood glitters. The gospel glows. There's a lot of difference between glitter and glow. See, Hollywood glitters with clothes and rickies and ricquettas and rettas. But God's humble God humbly glows &gt;&gt; in humility of the believer. No matter how ignorant he is, he glows in humility, not shines in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Humility. &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves &gt;&gt; to the word of God. But Jesus said, "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come," see, he will bring these things that I have taught you to your memory, the word. What's the Spirit of truth going to do when he comes? He's going to bring you back to the word. And he'll also show you things to come. There is the real spiritfilled church now stays with the word reflects the word. God on earth. How is God on earth? Because there's a people living the word. &gt;&gt; He's the word. You're the word. You're living the word. We just got to get the world out. &gt;&gt; We've got to get our ideas out. We've got to get back. All of us need to start reading our Bibles. God on earth. He doesn't need any theologian cuz his word is of no private interpretation. He interprets his own word by vindicating it and proving it. That's true. He'll vindicate it and prove it &gt;&gt; to you. He says, I'm going to ask you something. How can a man or a woman who claims to be filled with the Holy Spirit, which is the word, That's right. The Holy Spirit is the word. How can you be in the flesh of the Holy Spirit has made you a part of him to reflect the gospel of your age and deny the word that he wrote? Don't deny it with unbelief. Don't deny it by not taking the promise. Don't deny it by thinking it won't work. &gt;&gt; It will not fail. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; It won't fail. It'll work for you. &gt;&gt; No matter who you are, how young you are. If you can read, read it. It'll work. &gt;&gt; It'll work for you. And I'd like to read this last little statement in closing. He said, "Look, hurrying, there must come a true seed. There just has got to be because he's coming for the bride without spot or wrinkle. He's coming for it. A word vindicated bride. Oh, she'll be such a little bitty group. Jesus said, as it was in the days of Noah, wherein eight souls were saved. Is that right? So shall it be in the coming of the son of man. How many? I don't know. But see, the bride is going to be made up of all down all down through that had the word in their age. It's not just this last group. God is going to take the whole thing out of here. Oh my. And there's so many other wonderful things. But I I just wanted to go back and just close with this. You've got to have a relationship with the word. The word is meant to be fed on. Man doesn't live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. You'll find yourself starving. You'll find yourself weak. You'll find yourself not able to overcome. I got dizzy the other day and I just so dizzy I couldn't hardly go on. And I said, I says, "What's wrong with me?" And it dawned on me. I hadn't eaten. So I said, "Leslie, would you make me a bologn sandwich with two slices of baloney?" And I ate that sandwich. And man, it wasn't no time. I started feeling better, you know. And then I ate a few things I shouldn't have eaten, but that was great. I justified it. We'll starve. You want this message to be mean more to you. You really want this to become more alive. &gt;&gt; Put it together &gt;&gt; in your life. Things that are in here you don't see, he'll show them to you. &gt;&gt; He didn't add to or take away. &gt;&gt; He revealed. &gt;&gt; If you obey this word, it'll come to pass. &gt;&gt; You have a wayward child, go read the prodical son. &gt;&gt; Read about the woman at the well. Read about the one caught in adultery. You see how he acted? That's how you act. &gt;&gt; You're a reflection. The We can go forward when we come together. Every single one of us believing this word is true. Bringing ourselves subject to the word of God. If there was one needy amongst us today and they wanted to be prayed for and they came up and said, 'You know, I'm not doing too good. And we join together and we ask the father. Now, we wouldn't approach him with Lord, I think you should. Lord, this is what I think you should do. Uh, has anybody counseledled God lately? No. But Lord, you said &gt;&gt; that you'd in no wise turn them away. If someone came with sickness and we were to anoint them with oil or lay our hands on them, the only thing we have is, Father, you said that by your stripes this person was healed. You said if I ask anything in the Father's name that you would do it. &gt;&gt; No, I'm here obeying that word and standing on that word. Your spirit is in that word. So if I obey that word that manifests his spirit and we see him glorified in his word. Not glorified in the laying on of hands, not glorified in the faith of the preacher, but glorified in his word. We saw the word manifested. We saw Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, and many other scriptures manifested in the flesh in our day. That was the word made flesh in our day. You have been elected become the word made flesh, &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ, the union between the word and his bride. And they become word, word upon word, line upon line, &gt;&gt; the word. whole church. When you start taking God at his promises and seeing them fulfilled in your life, you will shout. &gt;&gt; You will sing. You will praise God. You will give thanksgiving because you know he's alive. You know he's with you. You know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if he promised that he's coming again to take you, that where he is, you may be also, you can know that promise is as sure as a a rock, &gt;&gt; and you're looking one day. So leave those things which are behind behind &gt;&gt; and let's press &gt;&gt; for the higher calling. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand. The musicians would come play softly something. [Music] We were told many times to look into the mirror of God's word, our eurum thundum. And I hope the truth of what was said this morning might not be able to preach the windows out of the walls or make the ceiling fall down. But if you'd simply in your heart ask yourself, "Have I been comparing myself to the Bible? Have I been living the scriptures?" And I'll be the first to raise my hand and say, 'Lord, I've failed so much. I've just ran on the gas that was in my tank. And then I'm surprised when I find myself on empty. [Music] Then I realize, Lord, I've got to eat and feed every day spiritually. I've got to live by these promises that's in this message. I've got to read and hear from you. And I'm promised that if I live that word, that would be you living in me. And the works that you did, I do also, but I wouldn't do them by my own strength, by my own might, by my own spirit, but I'd be doing them by the spirit of the word because the Holy Spirit is the word. Jesus is the word. And we can partake of divine nature by believing and accepting these great and exceedingly precious promises. Father, I pray that I can start living by the promises of God's word. The promise of your soon return. The promise of you molding me and making me into your image. The promise of not being conformed to this world, but being transformed. Father, I ask if there's any in our midst this morning that really have got separated from their scriptures and their Bible. They've really kind of got caught up in the the natural bread of life and they've neglected their spiritual man, the inner man, and they'd like to raise their hand to you this morning and say, "Father, I want to get back into a greater relationship with your word. I want to know that this Bible is mine and every word in this book is given to me to live by. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will not pass away. Father, I'm called and created to live by this word and there's no satisfaction without it. Father, if you didn't kindle that in our hearts, the testimonies would start rolling off our lips. The praises would start moving in our heart because they're word produced. And when they're word produced, they're everlasting. They're eternal. And we become part of that great eternal. Lord, I pray that you just enkindle in me a greater desire to connect with every promise in this book and live by it. Father, those that raised their hands this morning, they know in their heart whether they've been reading, whether they've been listening to your spirit, whether they've been studying, Father, and you're not here to condemn. You're here to encourage. You're here to speak to them and say, "Come back. Come back to my word. And may you touch the heart and may they see the importance. May they walk out this morning with the determination to be more connected with the scriptures, more connected with the word and the message than they've ever been. We ask it in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. If there's any sick amongst us this morning, anybody that feeling that being prayed for would help you or help somebody that you're praying for, we invite you to come pray. We'll join our hearts together and and ask God to bless you and help you this morning. Amen. Help me sing that. &gt;&gt; Holy words long preserved for our in this world.
