of the lord this morning beautiful day outside the first day of spring uh we've got many things to be thankful for amen this is our this little gathering this morning is a little slice of heaven this side of the the great divide i was reading this morning in the book of galatians chapter 5 and paul says brethren ye have been called under liberty only use liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another amen amen it's a trying time i know we're all burdened but this is the place we can lay down our burden amen we can leave here with freedom we're going to read psalm 125 this morning this kind of uh reflects the world events a little bit and maybe in our daily lives even i pray to be a blessing to all of us you know this uh this gathering this morning uh reflecting on this is is not our sole purpose is to try to come together with christians of we like to call it like precious faith and and praise the lord and lift up his name and and just benefit one another by being here we're actually called to a ministry and i like to think of this as just our recharging station we get built up here and sure we have prayers answered we come in reverence because the lord has met us here this place has been set aside and sanctified and it's a house of prayer it's a house of praise and worship and those that don't know the lord can find the lord here he finds they find the lord here because we brought him here this this place it'll burn just like the rest of the world it won't be preserved we won't come back and hold meetings here there will be a new jerusalem but we're thankful for this place we set aside but let's get filled up so we can go discharge that battery by preaching the gospel living a life amen so i hope the psalm 125 can reflect that this morning because we do put our trust in the lord let's read it together psalm 125 they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands into it do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their hearts as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be upon israel amen let's bow our heads dear gracious and kind heavenly father we thank you lord for the reading of your word we thank you for this gathering lord

appreciate the grace that you've placed in our lives father how you've taken us from the sheepfold and made us partakers of your kingdom today father we just asked you this morning we could have a time of fellowship around your word that we'd be blessed and that you would be our portion this morning father we ask you to forgive us our trespasses and our shortcomings father bringing to your remembrance the great price that you paid we ask you to increase this morning our desire and love for you we ask these things this morning in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen well you're getting your bibles out this morning and turning to colossians we'd like to welcome all of our visitors and here we have a few out sick and then we have others that are out at the meetings in oklahoma and we certainly would like for all them to be blessed this morning but those of us who are here we can have a wonderful time in the lord amen and i'm sure some of those people are streaming and so we're grateful to have them today just before we start in our scriptures we have this little form that we put out back and the purpose of this is for us to kind of get an idea of what kind of children that we have for sunday school so we have we're trying to figure out how we can get some sort of sunday school started somehow so if you could just list your children or their ages and and just fill that out we can get a feel for how many uh we people we'd have to accommodate and so we're we have two uh possibilities one is gonna we'll have sunday school in the evening and the other we'll have sunday school earlier on sunday but the lord after richly bless you on that portion so let's turn in colossians this morning as we're just going to have a little bible study this morning kind of go through some wonderful statements as we've been studying this message the rising of the sun and if i had a title for this morning i would like to call it the opening of understanding the opening of understanding or you can make it personal the opening of my understanding or we can make it as a body the opening of our understanding but we'd like just to have it the opening of understanding so if you would turn with us to galatians i mean colossians excuse me and we'll read in the first chapter of colossians starting with the ninth verse and you know i believe that paul he was an apostle but i believe he was an evangelist i believe he was a teacher i believe he was a prophet uh i think he just kind of in embellished all of the traits of all the fivefold ministry but i think here's that kind of shows his pastor heart he says for this cause we also since the day we heard of it do not well let me just read the verse before so you could kind of get the background of it he's talking about ephrath our dearly fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who have declared unto us your love in the spirit so now this is paul's response to that remark for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye may might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patients in long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meant to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son heavenly father bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated uh we're just going to kind of go through a back over a little portion of service that we played here last sunday night and we won't um we won't uh play this portion again but we'll just pull up different paragraphs and put them on the screen and talk about it as i was um looking at my sermon this morning and how i was trying to put it together an old friend of mine came to mind after brother don ruttle and don ruttle would told me he says you know i preach like a beagle he said i go down and i find a trail and i go down this trail for a while and he said then i'll come back around and go down this trail for a while so we might kind of be like a beagle this morning going down different thoughts and different things together but we just hope that there's little nuggets in the framework of the word this morning that will bless your heart and increase our understanding because i think it's a wonderful thing when we understand things and our understanding grows one of the things we understand about the word of god is that you you can't do anything you can't go forward if you don't know what you're doing you you understand and so we understand what we're doing here this morning i thought brother tim's comments were so beautiful we're not just here this morning to go to church we're here because we believe that there's a condition or an event that is rapidly coming to the church and it's the resurrection of the saints it is a rapture that we are anticipating that any day now could take place and paul mentioned to it here spiritually he made this statement who hath delivered us from the powers of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so we have spiritually apprehended that kingdom in other words we're not under the rule of darkness but we are now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus but yet we're still here and i think all of you know the effects of being here some of us are our body doesn't get out of bed as quick as it used to and all the things we did as young men are now showing up in our joints and of course some of you are young so you can only imagine what we're talking about but we we have a hope and that hope is that one day soon we will be young again amen and that not only will we be in that kingdom spiritually but we'll be in that kingdom physically and so we we want to understand after and have our knowledge of god increased and our understanding increased so that we can fight this fight and that we can be good soldiers and we can stand uh every while of the devil and uh that we will know him at every one of his tricks and we could stand fast in the knowledge of the lord and so we approached this this morning and there's some wonderful nuggets as we're approaching easter we may get through this message by easter but this was an easter message and we understood what easter is what gave us hope many a great man has died for a great cause and has went into the grave because he he laid his life down for others he laid his life down for his country he laid his life down in service for the uh his king but never has there been one that has risen from the dead and jesus said they don't take my life from me i give my life free i lay it down and i will take it up again even in this world today there's a place where there's a tomb and the people have this great hope that one day that their their prophet messiah or whatever how they view him will rise up and they have a horse there ready for him to ride and at the end uh and what a what a great faith i mean i admire their their uh faith but uh i'm disappointed because i know that they've they've missed the great thing that god's done and they're living in hope and not in possession we possess the resurrection if the same spirit that was in christ jesus dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body you are not looking for something that is a hope you are not looking for something that is down the road you haven't missed anything you're right in god's time you're right in god's season god's got you where he wants you and we have the great hope because that he's given us the foretaste he's given us the earnest he he's placed the same spirit that was in him in us if this same spirit dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body and so you can sit back this morning knowing that you've received something that is eternal and if you have eternal life you've always had eternal life god had you in his mind in the beginning he knew what you would be here he knew the color of your eyes the color of your hair the statute he knew all those things that's why all he foreknew he did predestinate amen and so we're we're grateful for that this morning and if you don't have that spirit then there's been a way made for you to have that spirit there's been a way made for you so you don't want to sit here this morning and to judge yourself uh short we preached i believe it was last sunday night don't sell yourself short if if you're lacking in your life or you have a problem in your life you have a habit in your life there's been a way made for you that you can obtain that which you desire and that's why the preaching of the word is what it is it brings you under conviction it it causes you to be stirred up it creates in you and you feel that conviction that is really your spirit telling you i don't want this in my life this doesn't make me feel good this doesn't do anything for me i want to be free from that that's what the conviction of the holy spirit is is i i don't want to be under this i want to be delivered and so we thank god for conviction every child when he's chastised you know don't don't think it's terrible when you're chastised if you're chastised of the lord you can thank the lord that he's dealing with you now if if you if if i preached against something maybe alcohol or or drinking or something like that if you're a drinker and you don't mind it don't bring you under conviction you know what i mean i heard it all my life oh jesus drank wine you know if jesus was here today he'd drink beer they don't understand that nazarite vow they don't they don't understand that life that's set aside above the norm and that's what we're talking about we're talking about a people in this generation that's called above average we're talking about a people that is not going on on a nominal scale is not going on a denominational scale but wants to soar into heavenly places that wants to be what he was the works that i do shall you do also that's where our heart is resting this morning that he's the same yesterday today and forever so we just want to kind of go through just a few statements uh with you and and as we we we talked you know a lot of times people want to know uh is are certain things important or not and so i i'd like just if the brothers would maybe uh put up here a starting paragraph uh a 163 and and i just want to take this little section here this little trail like i said like kind of like the beagle this morning and discuss this little portion of scripture with us this morning that our understanding might be just increased a little bit you know and so we and that's what we want we want our understanding open and so he says here in in this uh scripture here he's talking about and he's talking about the scripture in saint john 5 24. and and if we would just read that real quick saint john i believe it is 5 24. it says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from life unto death is passed from death unto life excuse me and uh so uh so as we begin to look at that we begin to see that it doesn't mean so much that heareth my word because anybody can hear the word but the real meaning of heareth means to understand my word he that understands what i'm saying and my sheep hear my voice and another stranger they will not follow look in other words we understand what he says and there's a way by which understanding is given to us and it's not the way of man man who wants to increase your understanding of their of what their system is what their world is what their society is what their culture is and remember education science and civilization is of the devil it only came here through the fall in the garden you were just born into this world you were born in sin shaped in iniquity and you came into this world speaking life you came into this world with if i could just because of lack of vocabulary and education i would say you came into this world with animal instincts and so man wanted to conform everybody so they educated them and they started to teach you manners they started to teach you this and the way we do this and the way we do that and it's very difficult to separate from traditions in ways that you have to separate from the traditions of men but we are separating from the traditions of men because we're not under the culture of man anymore we're under the culture of god's word and i i've said this before culture god's word doesn't conform to culture culture conforms to god's word so it doesn't matter if your ancestors have taught you things for years and years and years when god's word comes along there's a choice that has to be made and believe it or not that was the great battle because the the jews were under the traditions of their fathers and jesus came and was giving them an exodus out of the law into the leadership of the spirit and grace and it wasn't easy to make that transformation neither this morning is it easy for you to make the transformation from flesh to spirit from hearing to understanding another it's not by nature that we want to move higher or move into a place that we've never been before or that we want to grow our nature is to set up camp find some water science find some food find some shelter and stay put but we've got to go beyond the camp and we we set up camp as we go a long life journey spiritually people started maybe in the basic fundamentals and then they moved on into uh like the the journey from justification it wasn't hard it was hard for people that came out under luther which soon denominated and had every characteristic of the catholic church except for going into the box and confessing the sins and doing penance everything was almost identical and then when wesley came and the revival of sanctification moved on it was very difficult for people who had set up camp in justification to move on to sanctification and when the pentecostal blessings fell okay and and that's all that we would describe it is the restoration of gifts it was difficult for people to go move into praying let me tell you what the old saints did people started praying and when they prayed and they called out to god they received the spirit of god that's right they called it the baptism of the holy spirit it was to them they looked back in the scriptures and related it to the feeling of the spirit that took place at pentecost and where that they spoke in tongues and men began to pray for that and as they prayed for that they began to feel that spirit move into their lives and they had a real experience with god because they were dry and formal and they were without leadership their leadership was based in their dogmas and their denominations and their traditions they went to mass they went to church they sang choir hymnals they baptized they already had what they believed there was no life so when the spiritual blessing came and they experienced that the early church of the restoration of the gifts they the only place they had to go was door-to-door they would go explain it in the scripture and they'd go to talk to somebody and they sit down and they visit with them and they tell them about this experience and it actually went forth the way the gospel is supposed to go forth from faith to faith because they experienced it and they would share with them look what happened to me we pray and this we felt the spirit of god fall upon us and we lifted our hands and we praised god and we spoke in tongues but it wasn't long until it denominated too tongues became the evidence of the holy spirit they divided into jesus name baptism oneness trinitarians and different things they begin to follow the same pattern because it's always hard to move up and to keep moving so we don't want to be comfortable this morning we want the word of god to flap its wings over our nests and force us to fly into the heavenlies so we want understanding this morning and i'm going to try not to get excited and i'm going to try not to get evangelistic i'm going to try to stay calm because this gets me excited so let's just read here so you're talking about understanding you know as you could go to the down the street and meet a drunk right and say did you know god hell yeah i heard the preacher so because he says now he says he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle so we've already cut the beginning of separation of understanding so i hope that you would see that understanding is what separates you he says he says out in this 1603 he says ask in the marriage in divorce case the other day when the holy spirit told me that i came and said it just the way he told me and many of you remember the sermon marriage and divorce because there was a great controversy and there still today is a great controversy about marriage and divorce that is always one of the greatest problems in the church so i'm not talking this morning about any of your marriage situations at all wherever you are whatever your situation is from this moment on go a hundred percent with god amen he says when the holy spirit had told me that i'd come and said it just the way he told me and some minister lady gave me a sharp little balling out see she said i guess you take the place of god i said no ma'am said well you told them their sins is forgiven said where said only god has power see another pharisee now the pharisees were void of the understanding of the motive and objective of god's word they could read the letter of it but they had no understanding of what it said what it meant or what god was trying to tell them in the word of god and paul summed it up like this the letter killeth but the spirit gives life so okay so we want our understanding increase this morning how that the spirit gives life so we'll just read it said he said i said okay you see that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was now this is a i just want to settle on this just for a quick moment and we'll try to move quickly a lot to cover he said he said blessed art though son of jonah flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it now you understand so there's something that god can give the believer that keeps the gates of hell prevailing against them and and i want to tie that down to understanding and where that you could understand it so he said it was by this revelation that peter had by divine revelation something that you received from god is what anchors you to a spot that the gates of hell cannot prevail against you it's when you lack understanding that the doorway is open for something to be infused into your thinking because man seeketh after understanding that's what god eve was reasoning pilgrims and i i give unto you the keys whatever you bind on earth it'll be bound in heaven what you and what you loose on earth it will also be loosed now he says that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh now just if we just sit there for a second another word jesus told when peter got the revelation of who that he was he says now that you have the revelation or the understanding of who that i am so by divine revelation peter knew that jesus was the son of god now what did the jews say that he was carpenter's son is this not jesus of nazareth isn't his father a carpenter but peter saw that this was the lamb of god who was going to take away the sins of the world so so it was by this understanding another word for revelation by this understanding that that the word was made flesh now isn't that what we're here this morning because we believe that this is a time where the bride is going to be made flesh word that's what we're looking for amen john said hearing is the love of god made perfect that as he is so are we in this world isn't that our desire we say it to be more like jesus we sing it but we understand we just don't want it all in our mind but we want our flesh to be quickened this peter now has this understanding right he has this revelation of who he is so now that he had that understanding this is why peter could go out and say he said that was divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the sun the groom its flesh today by the bride see now this is this is just lays here so beautifully simple he said if it was made flesh in that day in the groom so now he's pointing he had a divine revelation peter did peter went out and baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ by divine revelation it was divine revelation that caused peter to baptize the way that he did now without understanding you read the scripture and you say oh it says father son and holy ghost that would be the natural way for someone to take that word and interpret it but with understanding and that's what peter had he had an understanding so the understanding of the revelation of who he was manifested in his flesh caused him to baptize the way that he baptized so him baptizing the way he baptizing was the revelation now put into action in word flesh [Applause] you see what i'm saying so if it was flesh in the groom then it's got to be flesh in the bride so if it was if that's exactly what happened then and then he said who's that whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted and whoever sends you retained to them they are retained let's just turn to that real quick it's uh matthew 16. it don't matter does it if we just take a second and just lay these things right down in god's word and and have a a real study of his word so that we know uh we're we're solid in that and he said unto them and that can you know the scripture before some say that thou art john the baptist some elijahs and others jeremiah are one of the prophets that's man's thinking now peter is going to get an understanding of the word he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god how would you like to been there yeah we doubt our christ the son of the living god oh no man when it struck peter i imagine that that he shouted glory and praise he worshiped thou art the christ the son of the living god i see it i understand it i've got it another peter what just happened to you the enlightenment of your understanding what just happened to you is what's going to make the flesh become word something's got to happen let's read as we go he says and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art doubt simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto you that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it he said watch this is this this statement he said now the catholic church picked up on on that and it taketh their priest but that was carnal but now watch what the carnal part they turned it into a sacrament or a ritual really the revelation is the word being made flesh he said watch it is spiritually revealed watch it was spiritual revealed word that did it it was a spiritual revealed word that caused peter to do what he did same thing with marriage and divorce it was spiritual revealed word that caused the messenger to do what he did it'll be spiritual revealed word that will cause you to do what you do it's the only thing that's going to move you the only thing that's going to change you you can see oh maybe i'll accidentally jump ahead i was going to try to follow some notes for a change in my life but it's the only thing that's going to allow you to rise above the battle you have in your flesh it was spiritual revelation it was it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told them to baptize in the name of the father son and holy ghost he knew they knew who he was see yes it was this he didn't go out and baptize what he said but because he had spiritual understanding of the scripture that scripture now became flesh and was manifested in the very actions of his life that's why people in pentecost today what we've got today those real bill real genuine people who know that the experience of god's word they're starving in their churches i have some good uh you united pentecostal preacher friends and can i say and talk with the brother uh one time we just had a wonderful time of fellowship and the church was dividing between those that wanted to keep the traditions of dress and didn't want to go modern and there became the old-fashioned and the modern that's sad because the words never change and the experience has never changed it's the understanding of it that's changed they've lost the spiritual revelation and understanding of god's word yes sir and so you come up with the attitude is what difference does it make but remember we've been talking about the dynamic power of the holy spirit the dynamic power of the holy spirit starts through divine revelation i've watched it all my life especially when i first became a christian when i was a hippie i can't tell you how many guys i went down to the bay with who got all worked up and was going to walk on water now that's just an emotional workup you know how many people i've seen don't just take somebody that's death or take somebody who's blind and think they're going to perform some sort of ceremony over them speak in tongues shake them do something and cast that spirit out jesus even said some of these spirits aren't even moved without much fasting and praying [Music] and having an experience that's not grounded in the word that they're just children in the gospel they're all emotional worked up and just because they've read something in the scripture with no understanding whatsoever they're going to go work it up they're going to go perform it that's why they crash how many people have tried to impersonate and their car wrecks a long life's journey you can't compare yourself to anybody else you sit there and base your experience on your experience and your revelation with god's word we are not a denomination we are not a group and we may not all believe the same thing or have the same understanding but you better know your lord and savior and so we we understand that so what did he say he said it it was the spiritual revealed word that did it spiritual revealed word that had him tell the church spiritual revealed word it's got to be the spiritual revealed word in you that's going to bring you to a level that the works that i do shall you do also we'll just move quick so is it necessary so the question came up of water baptism is it necessary and so why is water baptism necessary this is now we're going down another trail why is water baptism necessary well there's no name given under heaven wherein a man must be saved than the name of the lord jesus christ i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me now i know there's a lot of religions in the world and i know this whole spirit and christianity today is oh the hindus are all right no the hindus are lost oh you're judging no i didn't say they were lost jesus said he was the way the truth the life so you say well what do you do about all those hindus i'll tell you exactly what you do all the father hath given me will come you can rest in that my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow i don't know the time i don't know when i don't know how but the way i know and there is no other way and i'm not ashamed of that paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the gospel that's the power of god unto salvation you can't take the gospel out and expect to have the spirit you get all kinds of nonsense you know the charismatic movement that was just the spirit on hippies sorry i hope that didn't offend anybody but i was one and i'm still trying to get rid of a lot of it but i'm going trying but we get so soft we want such inclusion that we toss the word of god out come out from amongst them my people and be ye separate amen how can two walk together unless they agree it's hard to come out of a church when all your friends are there and all your kids friends are there and everything's there and you know in your heart the man ain't right you know in your heart the church ain't right you know in your heart the doctrine ain't right you think it's easy to move up with god no you think it's easy today for us to move up higher we're fooling ourselves i've never seen a time in my whole life where the church has been spending the last 15 years patting one another on the back saying pete you're redeemed you're saved you're this you're that well let's start putting it into the flesh let's start moving up let's just unquote the scripture the work said i'll do shall you do also let's do the works so we we see it now so why is it important i just like to go to paragraph 182 and we'll just take a nugget out of this and move quickly on salvation alone goes in the name of jesus christ whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of jesus christ there is not another name no church no hierarchy no title no nothing else yet he is the rosa sharon he's the lily of the valley he's the morning star he's alpha omega the beginning and the end jehovah jirei jehovah raphae jehovah massey all these he is all those things but yet there is not salvation in any of those titles jehovah no salvation rose of sharon yet he is no he is no salvation father son and holy ghost no salvation only the name of jesus christ and the bible said that repentance and remission of sins must be taught in his name beginning at jerusalem and in the utmost parts of the earth let's just turn to that because so that's luke the 24th chapter so what we're talking about now is we're talking about our understanding being increased so i work how are we approaching this this morning we're bringing things out and we hope that you're seeing oh i'm getting some understanding oh we're trying to demonstrate in the flesh what it means when god increases your understanding or opens your understanding what does it do for you first of all the truth sets you free right it lets you hear his voice anybody can read this bible but it's those whom the spirit is opening their understanding let's just read the 45th verse of luke 24. you know this great story don't you is people walking on the road to emmaus with jesus with them and them not seeing it why because what they were blinded but now look at the way it transpired remember it was spiritual revelation of the word that did it any and yeah and this thing said that he he's you know he the 44th verse it's a hard one he said in them these are the words which i spoke unto you well i was yet with you that all these things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me i don't think they still got the picture and then he says here he says then opened he their understanding and that they might understand the scriptures the opening of understanding is the key to moving forward pray for revelation the church never understands the importance of revelation they traded revelation for dogma they traded revelation for church teaching they traded revelation for tradition god cannot move you forward without increasing your understanding you'll never get it you can't stay camped out quit looking back quit looking at your back life look forward let him show you something and walk in it and he said and then he said after their understanding he said on them thus it thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer that is fabulous why did christ have to suffer why did it behoove him in other words he's saying there this is what was written of me father let this cup pass me but nevertheless thy will be done he agonized in the garden until he sweat blood but i want you the process that's taking place in him because this is the way god works god increases your understanding now it behooves you am i going to take the path of understanding in revelation is it necessary is it important or am i going to listen to oh shirley it doesn't make a difference cut the voices out cut the influences out this is the age of voices this is the age of finger-pointing and everything but it's just this simple he said it behooved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things behold i send you the promise of my father upon you but terry in the city of jerusalem until ye beat endude with power from on high now let's just read this he said and that's the scripture you say do you think it makes a difference yeah it makes a difference because remember john only preached repentance john couldn't preach remission because up until calvary the only thing that could be preached was repentance repent that's all they did repentance will not take you further because jesus at calvary remitted their sins in other words they're gone before calvary only repentance after calvary thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more so you're not just preaching to repent but you're also got to understand that there's remission and that remission only comes in one name that's why baptism in the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the holy spirit which isn't even how the scripture reads but with no spiritual understanding you end up with three gods and that never makes any sense there ain't a theologian in the world that can sit down and defend the trinity in the scriptures and when you have a clear understanding of the godhead they try to talk about the blood water blood these three agree in one but the other ones these three are one i am the lord god amen you'll never you'll never get okay and i you know before my conversion i was a catholic catholic started the trinity it wasn't started at the day of pentecost it was started by the catholic church and what do they have they have a vicar instead of christ they have a man that they believe sits in the seed of christ and he was the one that started baptism in the name of the father son and holy ghost all things that you do do in the name of the lord jesus christ except baptism i mean it doesn't it doesn't make sense oh i've had them hold up the egg it's a shell it's a yoke and it's a white yeah nobody eats the shell but a chicken that ain't eagle food a lot of people separate the white out and only eat that and they take the yoke but in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and if you take god you've got to take his word you just you know it's just it's so simple but without understanding when jesus hung on the cross he said my my god my god why hast thou forsaken me wait a minute i thought he was god i thought he was the second person how did he have the father wait it was the holy spirit that that overshadowed mary they get on this beagle trail you know why they all have the mark of the beast i mean the baptism didn't mean to say that in the name of the father son and holy ghost because they're all daughters of the great harlot that's what unites them all but i didn't want to go there but it makes a difference because there was no remission of sins till after calvary and that's what they're preaching that go into all the world can preach every missions of sin in my name preach the remission of sins in my name that's why all the places in the book of acts that they ever baptized they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they baptized in jesus name was until the nicaea council that they ever baptized that way and so the so that's why we see the importance of baptism because of the fact there wasn't remission of sins till after calvary and that's what the gospel is and then just working our way to a close here now let's just drop down to paragraph 78. what a question and he said now the next thing will you believe he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and when this new eternal life dwells in you it's a potential the question is will you believe you know what belief is belief is faith faith has two parts first of all it's acceptance a pardon's not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon he can do everything that he said he did for you but until you accept it and tell you you can't keep looking back and saying oh i'm so bad i'm so terrible i did all this i'm no good i can never get any closer to god and drag this mistake whatever you made in your life pull yourself all down life's journey with this thing it's like remember the crow i think they call it johnny crow or something he was tied by a string the farmer caught him and he drove a stake in the ground tied a string on him and he would only go as far as that string would let him but one day some other crows came by and said hey you know you've been set free there's been a proclamation all crows are free and they cut the string and he was so used in his mind in his habits in how far he would venture in life how far he would venture in god how how far okay he would move up he was so used to that string holding him down where he couldn't go any higher with god that's all the farther he went even when he was set free he never accepted the strings been cut well you were yet a sinner he died for you he did not go to the cross hoping you would believe on him he didn't hang there and say oh i hope there's some people out there that'll believe in me i love that song when he was on the cross i was on his mind he died for his own he died to redeem his own he even he even spoke this i thought it was a a great uh a scripture it's a luke 10 20. if you don't mind just turning to luke 10 20 real quick just trying to just lay a few things to bless us this morning so you know the story he sends them out and they do all these signs and wonders they come back in luke 10 20. she says and he said unto them in luke 18 i beheld satan as lightning falling from heaven behold i gave you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you right but listen notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you that is the best description of the prosperity movement the faith movement the pentecostal movement they're all rejoicing because they have power over devils but he said don't rejoice in this but this is an understanding they don't have but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven rather rejoice because your name's on the lamb's book of life that's why the gospel of this age came to give you understanding that your names are written on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world and he came to die for his home all that the father hath given me will come and so in closing this morning as we talk about these great things and we'll read this just for a moment he says in verse 191 now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality right isn't that the promise if you have this spirit this spirit will quicken you he that believeth on me and has my spirit he shall never die amen do you understand that oh death where's your stain oh grave where's your victory i have fought a good fight i've ran a good race i'm waiting for the crown that's laid up for me put it to rest already this isn't our home it's getting so bad most of the christians i know don't even want to stay here anymore but it makes you when the get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come into subjection to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it just makes you different galatians 5 and 16. this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the lust for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit and the spirit and it is against the flesh and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that ye would oh that is battle time the spirit makes your flesh come under subjection you better be ready for the battle you better be ready for the mind battle because it makes you different when you're called out now you're different you're different than the world kids in school you're different you're wearing dresses they're running around in gym shorts don't you ever let a gym teacher a principal or anybody ever get you to put those gym clothes on you go get me i'll sit in their office i'll explain to them god's word and i'll challenge their morality to this gospel you don't got to compromise we had a sister one time she loved music she got a full-ride scholarship to you texas christian university which believe me is just a name just like baylor ain't no baptist college it might be where the baptists get money and they might have a little teeny little program you put there but if it was a real baptist college sorry for any of you that are going to baylor or wherever you're going but if it's a real baptist college they would be leading people to jesus christ every day but they're not baptist after john the baptist i don't know what they're after so we're on this great question of believing and accepting so we see here that it makes you different that's where the battle comes in because the flesh is warring against the takeover of the spirit right because the spirit's going to bring this body into subjection to the word how does it work how does it take place by spiritual revelation that's what does it god increases your understanding you see what's right and now you've got to take that understanding and bring this flesh under subjection the flesh don't want to go under subjection i love believing the word but oh this guy resists it i don't mind turning my cheek the first time but it's almost impossible for me to turn my cheek the second time and the scripture tells me jesus he opened not his mouth you know i always want to say or at least i want you to know i know that you're doing me wrong i want you to know i've got you figured out it's so hard to sit there and say don't say a thing just let it go i'm in control be christ-like no i want to tell them they need to get saved you disagree with me you need to get saved that's what you need you need to see it my way oh the battle's there the battle's on do you understand you we're all talking about moving up right we're all talking about getting higher with god we're all talking about getting close to the lord we're all talking about doing the works that he do you think you're going to get to that place without a battle you think you're going to get to this place without bringing this flesh into total subjection you know what religion is religions are covering people cover up the flesh with religion because they don't want to bring it into subjection because it ain't easy and no man hateth himself but he loveth himself and he nourishes himself and he protects himself it's not easy it's a battle the battle just begins it's tough it's hard we got religion we put on malachi 4 5. we put on revelations 10 7. we put on luke 17 30. we've got we've got the doctrines that nobody else has got we don't need to put on doctor we need to put on him you want to grow higher it ain't going to happen without you getting this flesh into subjection it ain't going to happen as long as bitter and sweet is flowing out of the same fountain not going to happen no wonder he said when you get the spirit it's in potential why is it impotential because there's a battle that's got to be won there's a flesh that's got to be overcome there's got to be a desire will you believe it will you accept it because that's what faith is is acceptance faith is a possession will you take the promise will you accept it and by this promise yes amen not by your might not by power not by might but by your spirit saith the lord will you take that promise of god's word that promised you that this flesh to come into subjection and take that flesh and go to war with yourself it out you got to possess the gates of your enemy you got to be perseverant you got to speak the word and go forward you got to come out of the nest out of the chicken yard you got to flap your wings that's what it is it's a great battle you say why is it important i'd just like to bring this real quick to 93 and 94 and then we're done it says here he says now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else for it will quicken your mortal bodies to the word sure it will but you gotta fight for it you can't run without it you can't run without understanding understanding of the word is what gives you the revelation and the power of god's word to overcome you can't run without it that's why you've got to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you can't run without it you can't get any higher your expansion in god's word will not grow that's right you've got to get out everything that's not word you've got to pray for understanding of everything the opening of your understanding you want to move forward in the lord everybody will raise their hand you've got to have your understanding open lord open my understanding let me look let me live you can't run without it you'll sputter if you don't believe all of it it can't be part water impart gasoline in order to reach its full potential it's got to have all word it's got to have understanding of the word may you increase in the understanding and the revelation of god's word may our understanding be opened amen because that's the that's what happens paragraph 207 he said the sun pulls that little plant that's drinking from god's fountain see it can only drink from one thing you pour oil down that little seed one time it'll kill it that's right you pour straight water old water that ain't no good and contaminate it it'll stunt the growth you know what's wrong with the church world today there's good people in those denominations but they're not getting pure word and their growth has done it and they're starting to understand their growth stunted you know what we need in this day we need real witnesses of god's word that'll go out and tell them there's a message that's been delivered that shows us the way to quickening power can you believe people buy the gospel you send me money and god will bless you here are the people they want to go out there and make everybody rich and wealthy and but there's one scripture they never quote god came to the poor in this world rich in faith ho ho that scripture don't fit in their program because they've learned to do everything with money jesus told them go out don't take extra shoes don't take no money in your purse you don't think we need understanding we need our understanding opened because it's the understanding the s-o-n that pulls the flower it gives you understanding what's oil it gives you understanding but real good soft rain water amen no man-made chemicals in it just comes from the heavens above and watch that little plant there's no water will grow that like rain water you put chlorine and stuff in it like you tried to dose us up with and the first thing you know it kills the plant christianity is dying i don't care what you say this nation is christianity's dying they won't preach against homosexuality homosexuality is a steaming spirit and it can be cast out the soldier boy amen the demon spirit god never did brought homosexuality to control the population you can't help who you love what a lie of the devil first of all it's not love it's pure perversion and i know a lot of believers whose kids have gone but you know what god didn't do it if the devil did it god can pray him back god can heal him god can deliver him god's still god he's the same yesterday today and forever you can't pour all this stuff into the church and expect the church to walk in his image it's amazing judas portrayed him with a kiss you can't you can't start accepting this stuff and then you feel bad like you're not a christian because you're preaching against it i don't preach condemnation i don't preach hatred i preach deliverance in the name of the lord jesus christ i preach sin is sin whether i do it or anybody else do it sin is disbelieving god's word all these other acts are attributes of disbelief i'm not ashamed of that everybody's telling me oh brother mcgary don't preach on the internet because you're streaming now someone will get a hold of it all the people in lgbq zd or whatever you call yourself i want you to know jesus christ can deliver you from the demon that has you in this walk of life the kingdom of god did not come in word only but it came in power and demonstration of the holy spirit [Applause] and the only thing that's going to put that power and demonstration to the church is when the church is willing to have their understanding opened to what god's got for him and it's a war against the flesh and just to settle this question now about the son of god to be revealed again in the bride in the last day the quickening power has got to come quicken them out of these dead denominational creeds to a living word of a living god then i want to read this because i want us we need this quote in this church and this is on the final subject of does it matter does the way you live matter does the way you think matter does what's quickening you matter there was a lady came by now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by had on a great big pair like they wear today spiked heeled shoes we call them high heels and i'll preach against weiner tight dresses if you can see the form i guess i'm just gonna preach it but if you can see the form of your backside your dress is too tight there's a lady come by now you know that kind of shoes they wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by and she had a pair of these big pair like they wear today spiked heeled shoes and she come by and i said wait a minute sister you can't walk that highway with that and i said you can't do that and she said ah she said look around at the rest of the women said don't believe him he's a madman see don't believe him i'll show you i can be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and still walk that i just let her go couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her she jumped up on the highway and she looked back at the sister and said see i told you and she started to run up you know as the bible said in isaiah the fifth chapter that they would have outstretched necks they'd have to they're they're pitched over see mincing they have to to twist mince as they go making tinkling with their heels see the daughters of zion in the last days whoever thought that was high heels whoever thought that when you got here on your heels and you lifted your back up it caused you to pitch forward and make your neck out it's a spirit i see them all the time in here if you sisters love one another when you see a sister show up go talk to her we don't wear stuff as that and i know i i've been in different countries we're wrapping up tight is natural we're high heels is what everybody wears it's just like if you come from a culture where everybody wore hats you know we don't cover our heads in the sanctuary our hairs are covering no i'm not talking about these little head things you put on you know i'm talking about these beanie hats that look out here you understand but everything is back to the understanding of god's word and so that she said i'm just going to run up this highway so she started up the highway just as hard as she could run and after a while the road got narrower and narrower let me tell you where we are church getting narrower and narrower the church ages got narrower and narrower all right it got down to where it could be if two if one in a million could make it peter described it as only eight souls saved in the day it's getting narrower so the narrower the road grows the more our understanding has to increase he said and it got narrower and narrow and she started reeling mincing like that and off she went and mother said the horriblest screams that i ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down like that said i turned around and said see she just obeyed everything but one word see everything but one word sure pentecostal women can be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then fail absolutely man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth see and she failed it and as i said see she would have went on in all right but she failed to listen tell her what was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples apostles the doctors of the apostles and prophets and full forth and they won't listen the only way you'll ever have your understanding to increase is to listen and i hope you understand that it's by understanding that god empowers you it's by revelation it's not a hope so oh i hope i get the power i hope i get the baptism it's a promise and when you understand the promise and the promise is wait don't try to go don't just run out preaching the gospel wait until i come and i give you something that will help you that the gates of hell won't prevail against it and that's why the sheaf wave has been waived in this last day according to malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 to increase our understanding to reveal the son of perdition that we might know the truth because the truth is what sets us free and the truth will keep us going forward and
