Description:
Building Upon The Right Foundation
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Morning Service
December 1st, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] all and all all to thee my blessed [Music] savior God bless you I was um listening to a tape that spoke about uh by faith Moses and um brother Brandon described how lot looked at s him he saw the green grass but he didn't see that his wife would turn into a pillow of salt that he would lose his children and barely escape with his life but he gave the example of Moses and said he could have been a pharaoh but by faith he looked beyond the immediate offerings that he was getting and he saw um he he saw the future promise you know of Deliverance of the children of Israel and he counted that better than what the devil was offering him so that's where I got the inspiration to sing this song The Midnight Cry I hope it's a blessing to you that one day God will come and take us off this Earth and we have to look beyond all the material things that the devil is offering us so I hear the sound of the mighty rushing [Music] way and it's close now than is ever [Music] I can almost hear the [Music] father say son go get my [Music] children fall at the Midnight Cry we'll be going [Music] on when Jesus steps up on a cloud to call his [Music] children the dead in Christ arise [Music] to

does not need to strive it just needs to be lifted up in the winds oh God and Father we've gathered here this morning for you Lord and we just invite you that you may come by our way and father take the word of eternal life Lord and the words of res Resurrection this morning and just speak it to our hearts that we may live oh God and Lord we've not gathered here to see a man but we've gathered

we just want to magnify you for who you are and what you what you done and and what you promises towards us and say father just take us into your hands and hide us behind the cross and father that we may when we hear the word of God this morning let it fall upon a feral ground and that would receive it and by faith it will grow to become a mature tree oh God and one that can produce fruits Lord Lord we invite you because we can do nothing without you lord we invite you because we know words of men is a lie but your word is eternal life Lord we invite you because we don't live by the substance of the world but we live by the word of God so we ask that you just help us this morning as We Gather in your presence father we remember our pastor and sister Leslie this morning and just pray father as they're coming back home father may you just protect them on the way Lord and this morning there are many that are traveling Lord we want to commit them into your hands and father that you just be with them oh God and during this time of of of uh holidays Lord that you protect them on the roads and wherever they are and bring them back safe us that are gathered here this morning Lord we've come for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to hear from you Lord so speak to us give us the Daily manner the the portion of the word you've allocated for this morning we ask these things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning amen it's so good to be in the house of God God Amen I know there's many traveling and many out and I spoke to Brother David yesterday he's on the way and it should be home uh today so we're certainly thankful for that um well don't forget tonight we're going to have communion service so um if we can make an effort to come uh back to the house of God man we want to welcome all our visitors so God bless you this morning amen I trust you're happy to be in the house of God let's open our Bibles um man Thanksgiving is gone Christmas has started so I guess that's how it works right so um first Peter uh chapter one uh verse 20 uh 22 it says seeing that ye have purified your soul in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfringed love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with pure heart uh fervently being born again not of corruptible sin but Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all glory as the men of men as the flower of grass then the grass withered and the flower whereof Fallen away but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which ye which by the gospel is preached unto you so it's by the word that abideth forever also if you can turn in Matthew chap 24 uh verse 35 uh a very familiar scripture reading the Bible the scripture will say Matthew 24 and 35 it would say that Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away gracious father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and as you're seting also turn your Bibles in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 11 it says for other Foundation can no man lay than this is laid which is Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 14 and8 the scripture will say for if the trumpet is uh if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for the battle I just want to uh speak for a moment this morning uh I want to it's my title and I hope it's just to help us so we can uh kind of know what to focus on this morning uh building upon the right foundation building upon the right foundation uh we we we can say certainly this morning um um I trust you're happy to be in the house of God this morning I know there's a lot a lot of people missing but uh we that are here will try to have church as much as we can amen uh we are living in uncertain times we can that we we everybody knows it whether you a Believer nonbeliever um you can certainly look at the world and see that uh things are not what they used to be uh the world is more divided than ever before there's more uncertainty in life than it ever was before uh people don't know uh what's going to happen tomorrow uh there's less Unity than it ever was before I was just looking at at just different uh uh World Systems and and and how the division runs so deep you know in in politics you you would think uh people have become so much uh ideological it used to be where people could find a common ground for the good of the country you know you you you know I remember not even uh 20 years ago not long ago that there will be something would happen and everybody will be United for the good of the country so they can get something done but we you find out that people are right now a lot more div than there ever was before you can see that that that that middle ground where people could come and join together for for the sake of doing something good it it doesn't exist anymore in fact you would find that even someone will come up with something a good idea that could be good for the country but just because it came from one party the other party will work as hardest they again to kill it and and and so there's not the division runs so deep and you look at in society there is such an increase uh in in division and people are divided they they try to divide People based on classes and and races and and different genders and it seems like genders come online every other day you know there's a new gender that's out there you know there's so much division the there's so much confusion you couldn't tell what's what's right and what's wrong and it's like every FL flever of it runs deep and you look at the global tensions and the local tensions there conflict in uh in global economy and and the trade and the climate change and and and people we the world used to be so if something is happening over one side it's hard for the other to be affected now anything affects everybody you know whatever is happening America is affecting everybody else the economy the world economy connected together everything is is one is all connected and and and people are divided in social media if you you you a Republican you go to Fox News if you're a Democrat you got SM SNM I'm sorry MSNBC and CNN you got those and and that's where and and and and and it doesn't help if you if you go and all you do is listen to Fox News they just repeat the same thing that you already believe and you go to the other side they repeat the same thing that you already so people just anchor down to what they already have not that you're going to make any changes but just that's the way it is the economy you know instability uh it it used to be that people had system in place where uh if the world economy will move and they would deploy those systems and say this is what we're going to use and they had formulas now those formulas don't work anymore why because there's a lot more variable than what they accounted for before so it doesn't really help it it becomes unstable and and and it becomes something you cannot Count On The Rise into uh the uh AI the artificial intelligence and and and and and technology and just the rapid advancement in everything and and it bring so much uncertainty for the workforce and people uh afraid lose their jobs they're going to be replaced by machines and you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and and you know I was thinking about this you we live in a time where there there's so much information that's required at first you know you could get a job and and just do a task and and what you need to do will be you know just something small and and concise now you have to know everything to to be able to do your job and there's the introduction of that the amount of information you have to know to just do a simple task has grown so exponentially because we live in the age of Technology you look at the the the the the the the the climate change and uh growing concern of environment and degradation and natural disasters and and and and it you find out that the things that man is doing to the Earth it's not sustainable for long term that this we we cannot keep going in the direction we're going and expect things to get better will never get better and and what man is doing is polluting the Earth but says man is killing himself man is producing his own destruction the the generational Gap and you have uh the older people want one thing and the younger people want another you know the younger people you know I was I was uh in the car with my kids one day and I believe I don't know where we're going and and and my daughter said oh you know don't do that it's not good for the environment and I look I said it's not good for what and so yet we are you know we the school we send kids to school for Education now they go and they turn them into activist you know you know and and they they care more about the environment and it it's going to burn you know and and the older generation cares about one the younger cares about the other such a division everywhere the the Health crisis and the pandemics and we we don't know when the next one is going to come across the line and and what the effect of it would be and and mental issues everywhere why because we we are so much overloaded with information and and the human mind cannot process the amount of information we are receiving today your your phone is giving you so much information that your your nervous system is not sustain uh uh built to sustain that type of information and you have to know you wake up in the morning by the time you find out what's going on with the weather to find out what's going on in politics in economy and everything and who did what and what happened that alone is like a job in itself and and yet you got to go and people have to put in more hours than they used to put before so it's just a complete chaos it's not sustainable it cannot last and the global conflict and you look at the wars and and geographical tensions and s and rising and Israel fighting so many wars there's Gaza War there's a war against Lebanon there's war against Syria there's there's everybody is involved in a war Ukraine over there Russia over here United States just a global tension and you can look at it however you can think and realize that this is not sustainable and and people try to ignore it and go about their lives and act like nothing is happening the Earth is a lot more unstable today than it ever was and Bam will say in the message un certain uh the if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound it said and I think of it just a few moment moments ago it said when I was thinking on this it said the income tax Affair and I thought there's hardly anything today that is certain everything has got so much uncertainty to it anything uncertain it says and anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted anything that is uncertain cannot be trusted and you cannot build upon something that's uncertain and he says and anything that that's uncertain cannot be trusted you stay away from it and and if it's not certain and it says and if you got a business and which we got businessmen present and maybe many of them and then say if you are running a business it's not it's not certain you it says you are not going to put your uh your very much in it because the dividend is uncertain and you wouldn't make uh much investment in it or if you are a good shrewd businessman you will wait and search out and if you got some money to invest it says you've got some money until you find something that's certain something that's reliable something that's dependent so the rules of investment require certainty reliability and dependency so you couldn't go and and put money in crypto and be surprised you lost money you you couldn't go and and put money in the penny stock and and be surprised you lost money why because it's not certain it's not dependable and it's not reliable so the rules of investment brother bam is warning us and and and uh oh there's just so much spiritual but I want to just lay a foundation before we can get there and it it it's very important that when we build our own lives and he's wanting us to be as businessmen as those that are uh uh have study what we are doing and be careful about what we're trying to achieve and make sure am I building on the right foundation what what I'm about to engage in and what what I'm about to invest in is it something that's certain is it something that's reliable is it something that's dependent he says because you don't want to lose you don't want to lose the little money that you've saved up because with uh with that you have to make your living it said and out of the re re uh renumeration from the dividend you draw the Investments and and and and that to get something to live by so you have to look at for investment you you just not have to uh consider first the reliabil the dependency and the certainty but you got to look at the track record is it something that how is it perform over the last 10 years over the last 20 years is it something that if I put my money in on the long run I'm guaranteed uh uh you know even though they said that past uh uh past performance is not indicative of the future but the disclaimer but yet you understand that you got to have some track record there's got to be something you look at for you to say this is a good investment you got to have some history on it you got to have something that you can look and say that I have study this and I can put my trust on it and I wonder if that's the same thing we do with our lives you know we we put our trust in our jobs and we put our trust in the economy we put our trust in our paycheck and well I get my paycheck I'll do this but if you actually consider and around the track record and see which one will be performing for you and which is it that will sustain you and I want to say this we as Christians have been given the word of God for us to put our trust on it but what I'm say so so it says uh uh business is is is uh is business is certainty is certainly I'm sorry on the shaking stand and stand tonight any business practically in the world is in shaken condition because the world is sh in a second condition it says you can't allow yourself it says now I'm I'm I'm going to say to save so much money to build a nice home and and he says a little home somewhere he says that's pretty shaky he says I'll tell you it says I'll tell you it is because the government could take it all over it could take it all all over overnight that's right so we can't even trust the money we have in the bank we can't trust the house houses that we live in all it takes is somebody to go in and raise the taxes and they'll take it away from you all of that would do is something will happen somebody will go and freeze your assets and everything you'll be gone and so if we put our trust on how much money I have what car I drive and what job I have we are putting our trust in something that is completely uncertain but when I'm will continue and he says uh democracy is uncertain people arguing and fighting and it says no more common sense in the countries and and people fighting left and right and and the country going in the trajectory where it's going down and and I heard the say I thought it was so right that said that Washington is a place where all the good ideas go to die it's not about a good idea the moment a good idea come there's thousands of people waiting to shoot it and even if Will Survive that the the amount of bureaucracy that idea has to Cross by the time it comes to the other side it's a complete different idea than what started it so you can't help it it's it's it was prophesied that it would sink and all everything that they're doing is just leading it in that trajectory but what I'm say is that I think the whole thing is rotten the whole thing is rotten but so say home life is UNC you know I I was thinking about this it's it used to be where you know a family that uh a man a a a one person the man will be able to get a job and with that job he'll be able to to to take care of his family buy a home and buy a car and and be able to support his family now you can't do that anymore now you need all the the whole two people this to go find jobs and one living in the morning the other working at night and and basically you get a family and the kids are raised by TVs computers and laptops and that's where they get the education why it's uncertain you know the the the the this one has to work that has to work because why the cost of everything is rising and and and the family can hardly sit around the table and eat the meal together you know everybody's engag in something this one is got to do this that's got to be people are a lot more busy than they used to be and and all constantly trying to achieve things but yet not having enough time to do it the people are addicted to the devices and consuming information in a way that they never been able to do before what an uncertainty but says a home life has become uncertain you know he says I seen a PC the other day and then on the journalist says the American divorce rate is the highest in than any other nation in the world and then we're supposed to be a religious Nation it says yes could that be it says religious it says all right it's not the it's not the right kind they said religion is is just the covering it's hard to tell what we are what what we will make uh what we make our covering out of Adam trying to make it out of fig trees fig leaves and it didn't work it's got it says it got awful shaky when he had to come out to meet God so religion doesn't meet it religion doesn't meet it at all he says but you but could you think that our divorce rates is higher than all the rest of the country all the rest of the countries he says our divorce rate we find immorality on the Move in our homes so and this is very important because we we have to be conscious of where we are trying to build upon we have to be reminded that that it the the the world there's no uncertainty and it's a shaking sand it's a sinking sand if you try to build upon it you will receive the result of the sinking sand it will say that if any man that's going to marry a uh if any woman is going to marry a man she's got uh uh she's she's not certain that that man uh she's not certain of that man she's better leave him alone and any man that's going to marry a woman and not certain you better leave her alone it says you better pray through on it until God gives you the answer so a certainty in doing things and trying to get married and I can expand it and say trying to get a job trying to take care of of you is to go down and pray until God gives you the answer it's not until you figure out and you come up with a better plan and it's not until you figure out and come up with an excuse to support what you're trying to do no it's to go down on our knees and pray until God gives you an answer and then when God gives you an answer then you are standing on Solid Ground education we said is uncertain you you're thinking about kids go to school and parents spend so much money and they get loans and everything and and then they go and and then they get out of school with a degree that they cannot use with so much debt in student loan and then they come out an activist at the end you you you wonder is this is this really something that one can rely on is it something we can really uh uh put our trust on and is it something the world world is falling apart every day the world is crumbling every day but what I'm says there's Wars everywhere this nation United Nation is not longer working everything that they put in place where after the world war we said well we're going to come as a league of nation and and and and try to work together so we can find Common Ground the whole thing today you can look at it and say it's the most uncertain thing that there is they they can't even come up with one resolution that all can agree on the church life is uncertain you know people just uh want to be everybody wants to be a Maverick and you know I'll go to church whenever I feel like and you know I don't want any responsibilities and people you know choose churches like a candy flavor you know today I want peach and then they decide what church they're going to go to tomorrow I want Strawberry and they go to another church they they don't want to be tied down to anything people want to be free you know if they feel like they've had so much Church you know they want to detox a little bit from church you know I you know I no much not too much connection and let me say this that kind of attitude will always produce uncertainty God is looking for prisoners God is looking for people that are tied down people that understand the fight that it takes and people that will stand there until a happens people that are there for the Long Haul people that are looking for the kingdom of God every day people that are waiting and expecting for the promise to come to pass into their lives that is certain and let me just say this so they will come and and and they they don't want any long-term commitment you know they want a a a a a a a week by week pass you know I'll come today I'll see how it goes and then I'll decide how we going to do the next week and I'll come you know we have I only need to come to one service that's good enough for me I've gotten enough I gotten everything that I need in one service butam says one thing it says that the Holy Spirit feeds on the word if one has the Holy Spirit within their heart they cannot stay away from church they cannot stay away from the word of God there something within their hearts that's bubbling they know that they're not doing it just fors but they're doing it for the good of everybody they want to be a team player they want to be part of the team why because they understand that their lives they' been commissioned and placed on Earth to play a role in God's kingdom church is uncertainty but when I'm say it says Church Life is shook happen people don't hardly uh uh uh people they says people don't know hardly what to do it says uh they go wandering from church to church and trying to find out which one is right and from Pillar To Post and trying to find out which is right and which is the right Doctrine and and and and and and one will come around and and they can explain it and just almost the very Point uh of the Creeds is right and then the first thing you know is they find so much corruption in that until they try they try in other Church see uh you say and then they try and at the church uh they try uh uh uh they try and add the church it says to see that the to see what the Creeds is and the doctrine it says it says all this we find out that we have broken ourselves up then it says by these things and 100 and uh to hundred of different orders of church he says now there's nothing against that there's just that they can't that they can do the other things then it says they do they do do it says and there go and then there there got to be some good come out of it somewhere but you see you can't put your confidence in saying I belong to the Methodist Association of churches I'm he says I'm all right because I belong to I belong to the Baptist I'm I I'm all right you can't do that and I want to add this you can't say I belong to Christian Life Tabernacle or I believe the message of the hour then I'm fine that's not okay that's not what God requires God doesn't require sometime of uh of uh uh uh uh uh uh like a like you wear like a bee that you can show everybody what church you go to and what to do what God is requiring is the new birth in his body and that that and that wouldn't matter what church you go through because you have made him himself what God requires is a personal con connection with him where you are built upon a firm foundation you are not built upon the intellect or the understanding of men but you are built on Christ Alone Oh My and but and so you would say you've talked about so much uncertainty is there anything at all that's uncertain but what as and then he says I'm glad to say that the only sure things that's that's that's certain that you can build upon is the word of God and this is the Firm Foundation this is the foundation that will not move and let me announce to you this morning the word of God is the foundation that put the world into existence the word of God is what calls everything into existence unless you are built upon the word of God you are on Shaky Ground but if you are built upon the word of God but what I'm says as God is eternal so are you Eternal when you are built upon the word of God you are building upon the Eternal material that cannot pass away the scripture will tell us Heaven and Earth can pass away but my words cannot pass away so when you build upon the word of God you are building upon something Eternal something that is stable something that will stand the test of time something that can come against our position and resist and something that can actually produ the right results the scripture will say in Matthew 24 and 35 and said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not fail amen God has a certain Foundation a found a foundation that cannot move and it's amazing how we build on things that can fail it's amazing how we put our trust in as if we had any ability whatsoever we we put our trust and we build and and we build and we we act as if tomorrow belongs to us not understanding that this breath could be taken away at any moment you it's not up up to you to decide when how long how long you're going to live and all those things it's given upon God himself for him to decide that and yet we take this life and we run it around everywhere we want we do whatever we want forgetting that it's somebody who gave it to us and we're going to answer for every ounce of breath that we took the scripture will say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God is it's the it's upon on this original Foundation that the Bible is telling us to build it's Upon This original Foundation that he says where were you when I laid the foundation of the world it was the word of God that spoke the foundation of the world into existence where were you he began to ask Joe in other words there was a time where all of this was being said there was a time where God was setting up his children there was a time where he was calling all his people together there was a time where the sons of God Rejoice for rejoiced in the time where they came into understanding of what God plan was and what was going to transpire in the future they looked at it and they rejoiced and it's only when you come upon that same Foundation Hallelujah not another Foundation that same Foundation that's the only foundation that will last that's the only foundation that we are supposed to be built upon that's the only foundation that God himself has laid down amen amen all at the ground is sinking sand you build upon the economy you'll get the economy result you build upon your understanding you'll get your understanding you build upon your job you'll get your job result you build upon anything else you'll get your that job that whatever you build upon result but you build upon the word of God you get Eternal results let's not kid ourself let's come into the understanding that I'm supposed to be built upon the word of God don't don't be drawn aside left and right by your jobs by things built upon the word of God let me say this you can put confidence in your job but just don't forget who gave you that job it's not your boss who gave you that job your boss like you today they can dislike you tomorrow and you gone but the God who gave you that job will give you another job the scripture says I never seen a righteous man beg bread why because they are built upon a solid foundation if God can feed the birds if God can give a lion his food if God can dress the flower can do that he says how much more ye that are his children what Foundation are we built upon amen remember all the other foundations are sinking sand consider the lily of the field amen who is he talking to he's talking about you he's wanting you to understand that those Lily of the field they built upon the rat Foundation they have an understanding that I have been built by God the flower the aroma that I give you coming from God the birds they don't worry about what they're going to eat next why because they know that God will give them the grain they know that The Light Young Lion cries out and God has to provide food for them how much more us this morning we we we try to provide for oursel but says quit doing that God wants you to rely on him he's the F Foundation it says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will not pass away what I have built will not pass away what I have spoken will come to pass what I have said will come to pass once all is said and done will come to pass hallelu upon the original Foundation that God is going to build this church upon on the original revelation of the word of God he asked Peter he says what do men say that I am but when I'm will take it and speak it this way it says but Luke said in Luke it says believe I will coming down to the mountain and his dis spouse and and he said to his disciples he says uh who do who the men say that the son of man am he says one said you are Jeremiah the other the prophet and so forth but but he said but what do you say that I am in other word who am I to you he said when Peter he says when Peter made that notable statement he says Thou Are Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed are thou Simon the son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it in other word upon this Foundation what was the foundation the foundation was the constant revealing of God to his people the foundation was not uh an intellectual understanding the foundation was the word of God that was hid from the beginning the the word of God that no man understood the word of God that was promised to come that God will take his word and he will make it a come to pass into your life that not somebody else not another person's testimony but God will give you a testimony so you can know he's a living God that God is wanting for you to know him personally he's wanting you to walk with him to know that he's your provider to know that he's the one who's going to provide for all that you have need of up on that Foundation that's what the Church of God is built upon it wasn't a bunch of people that went in other word when the scripture says when God called them there was a bunch of fishermen some didn't know how to read you think he did that by accident he did it so we can come this morning and understand that the foundation of God is Not By education it's not by one who can read the fastest and the best and who has enough wisdom to understand the foundation of of God is upon the Revelation that is given that you will know I didn't get here by myself God got me here I didn't change my life by myself I didn't make myself a message believer I didn't make myself clean I didn't make myself believe that I am what I am by the grace of God that's the foundation that what God wants to build not come here and compare scriptures with scriptures no God wants you to be built upon him and him alone but say what is it then upon the revealed truth of God God's word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was revealed to Peter that what that was God's Vindicated word amen it says that's the reason he could say who can condemn me of sin who can accuse me me everything the word has written of me I've performed it can you say that this morning everything that the word it wasn't living his own life he was living what was written of him and we spoke last time we say that the bride Jesus didn't come by his own self he came by the word of the Prophet what was written of him he came but says the prophet wrote it there was one Prophet who wrote it and there was one Prophet who came to identify it so one Prophet wrote The Virgin shall conceive and then another Prophet on the River Jordan it says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he identified the word when the word came to manifestation and the prophet came back in the same time it says the bride is no different from the bridegroom what the bride is the bride said the they're not different because they are the word in fact it saying that the works that Jesus did so shall you do that's our identification in the end time amen it's not us trying to be something that we are not the foundation has already been laid I'm just calling us this morning and say let's walk upon that Foundation amen it says God had Vindicated it that was he says that he was the word that's it it says God manifested the word says so it says and then God makes it real bring it to pass show it so the plan of God is not oh I I I I I understood it though I I went and I figured it out one way and then I wait until I figure it out another way no it's I believe it and God is making it come to pass I believe it and the God is making it come to pass what makes this message a reality even though you would have people criticize it left and right is because when we look out there we see what was promised come to pass we can read it with our own eyes the word is bringing that to come to pass and not only that but we can look at our lives also and be able to look ourselves and identify ourselves in the message and say that's me I'm looking into the mirror of the word I can read it that I can see that's the description of my life it it's not scripture comparison it's a life lived it's the manifestation of a life that's been made manifest and let me say this God's plan for his church is by the Holy Ghost but says God's plan for his church is by the Holy Ghost God didn't want us to just gather here as a group of people and try to look at the scripture and understand it no God wants to lead us by the Holy Spirit he says this paragraph 93 if you can find it it said find it here it says the holy spirit is living his life in human beings he oh my brother my sister let me say this don't think your life is your own God has given you that life so the Holy Ghost can come into that life that he can live the life of the Holy Ghost into human beings he says manifesting himself to the world it says he makes men thirsty for him unshakable undestructible the word of God manifested showing himself the word itself being Liv out through human life if we fell short of that let me say this morning that's what the world the word of God has come to do the word of God has come so we can take this life that we have the life that's been given to us and let the Holy Ghost rule upon us so God life can become our lives so we can go out there into the world and live the life of Jesus Christ himself and be to one another the life of Jesus Christ manifested that we can influence those that are out there so when they look at our lives they can see Jesus Christ manifested my brother my sister if the first church when they looked at them they called them Christian the last church has to have the same identification it's not a different identification it's Christ the same in all ages it's always Christ so we would bece Jesus you don't see him with the body of Jesus you see him in the manifestation of that hour and the manifestation of that hour is your body The Life of Christ in me let me say this let's not fail short of that if we would miss the goods and and the riches of this world that's okay if we will miss the reputation of this world that's okay you can miss all of that but don't miss the Life of Christ let's not miss his life let's let's be hunger and thirsting and for the Life of Christ to be manifested through us because that's the main thing and let me say this it's not even to know all the Mysteries it's not even to be able to explain all that he said but it's to only have his life living through this life that I walk like Christ I talk like Christ I we treat one another like Christ we see people that are in need we act like Christ and everywhere we are we are Christlike why he's made us ambassadors and you couldn't be an ambassador unless you were given the authority to bring forth the [Applause] power he says paragraph 94 it says all through the criticism the devil is always there all through the differences all through the creds and uh Creeds and says and Alo will try to stomp out the that word of God how they will try to substitute education they try to substitute and make denomination they have confused themselves out of it all of of all of it the word of God still stand just as bright and shiny as she ever did I love that you're not going to get confused you are not called to confusion now not to say that the devil will not try he will try in fact they say that they'll be so closed that if we were possible they will deceive the elect but the scripture says praise God the elect cannot be deceived why she's been given an eyesight she's been given the eagle outside so she can look and see that deception said one place he said it's like a you take a bird you take a a a dove she's not made for her to go and eat poor uh uh stuff that are dead it's not in her she cannot eat anything that's dead it's not made that's how the bride is if you try to stomach something that's not good it's going to hurt your stomach amen it's going to hurt you you're not going to be able to stomach it why you are made to Feast on the fresh manner every time you are made to Feast upon the true reveal word of God of the hour anything outside of that will only give your stomach pain oh God said both Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away then that's it says then that's something that's certain it says you want to anchor yourself anchor that word in your heart and I want to say this morning let's anchor Our Hearts Let's anchor everything that we have into the word of God let's anchor our hearts into the word of God it says David said in his word it said David said that he he he hid it uh it says he hid he hid it in his heart that he would not sin it says we wrote the law upon the bo the bad porc and tied himself to his hand and and wherever he says put his word always before him that's the way keep your mind constantly so it's not wandering left or right let's keep our mind constantly and then it says God told Joshua don't turn to the right or to the left from it then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous then Thou shalt have good success and I want to say that you want to have success take the word of God build upon the Firm Foundation build upon the foundation that's Everlasting take the word of God everywhere you go put it on your lips put it on your ear let it change your mind let it change your attitude let it change the way you talk Tech it change everything why let me say this the word of God is your way for you to bring what is Supernatural down into the natural the word of God is given for you to speak and bring the things that are not as though the word the word of God is given for you so you can overcome every challenge you come you come to face it says and when the church all unite itself together away from its Creed upon the word of God the church will have good success not when we unite around our Creeds and understanding no but on what is the word the very nature of Jesus Christ manifesting in the people what he promised to come to pass it says Thou be the thing that will stump out communism the word of God into your heart put God first in everything you do it it may sound simple but let me tell you this morning it will produce results amen before you make that decision just consider him consider to put him first before you decide and if you are at your with hands let me say this this life will pass away you may not receive everything that you want in this life you may not this life may not just go the way you want it to go but just be certain that once this life is over there's an eternal life waiting for you you know sometimes we lose ourselves in the things of the world oh God I want this I want that we have a list and we don't get it and you know we get all desperates and we get all broken up and everything and God knows why he didn't give you what you were asking for why because he's trying to build character and he knows perhaps if he gives you it's going to destroy you one thing that a Christian has to have at all time is to know that God knows best about my life if I never get that what I ask for God knows best if I wanted something God didn't give me he knows what's best for me I would rather take what's best for me and take something that will lead me to destruction don't ever forget that he didn't forsake you he said I'll will never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you until the end in other word he's giving you eternal life as a guarantee that no matter what you're going to be there but says then what what is it to this life where I get chopped up and die or burn or whatever you want to do with this flesh I have eternal life and that's the Firm Foundation I build upon people get discouraged I didn't get the job I wanted and I didn't get the kind of money I wanted I needed this and I didn't get the kind of house I wanted let me say this forget about all of that the more money you have the more trouble you have the more things you have the more trouble you have what you need in your heart is the Lord Jesus Christ you need the light of the Gospel into your heart and once you have that you have everything amen we cannot wonderand from pillow to post God wants us to be firm standing on the foundation which is the word of God it says but the word of God has not ended has no end I'm sorry because it had no beginning paragraph 99 amen amen it's the Eternal Word and if you are Ang anchored if you are anchored he said and the word is anchored in you you are Eternal with the word amen I love that all I need to do is from now on everything I want to make I want to make I want to make sure I build it upon the word of God I want to make a decision I want to make it's according to the word of God what am I doing I'm buying my ticket to Eternity I'm making sure that what I'm about to do will only produce good results I'm making sure that what I'm trying to do will only produce what God wants me to do in other word I'm making sure that I I'm I'm increasing my chance for Success I'm making sure that I will never fail because when I do it on his word as is eternal so am I amen that's why he could come back and say he will talk about who's me who's this me cdate and he will say and will again say well you know there's nothing and God was there he was there without mother and father he said God was there by himself and then he spoke and the lust came and it was as the child sitting at the doorstep of the father he said he came that was the first form that he took he sto right there and he looks at you and says now if you had eternal life you had to have had eternal life he's identifying where you came from my brother my sister we didn't come from this world we came from eternity amen why are we building upon the ground that's sinking we selling ourselves short God wants us to build upon that eternity that we come from it said it's got to come to the end to its end it says all all those things are shaking no matter how big they are built they are building a pillar it says it's got to fall down all things that's all things that's not off against the word or against that word or contrary to it will have to move it'll have to give place because the word is coming triumphant amen triumphantly think about it I was thinking about the scripture in Daniel and the scripture speaks about the king having a dream and I love that story because he the king he has a dream and he comes and he says well I have a dream but there's only one problem here my only problem is I had a dream I don't remember what the dream was and I need somebody to give me interpretation oh my my my and all the wise men gathered together like this is unfair you couldn't tell us the dream let alone how we going to give you the he said under this Kingdom that thing that has never happened never how can you ask for the dream and ask for the interpretation Hallelujah if we give you the interpretation you're going to ask for the dream and what is the interpretation without the dream but oh my Hallelujah they said but there was a god there was one who had a God who could answer the impossible questions there was one that had a God he said that let's go to prayer he called his brother and he said let's go I believe that we have access to a God who cannot only give it give the dream but give the interpretation of it oh my brother my sister that's the foundation we want to build upon H he came and Daniel went and he prayed and he prayed God came down and he gave him the dream and the interpretation something that's never happened before you want the impossible ask God he's the one who can bring the interpretation to come to pass he will not only bring the dream but he will also bring the interpretation so they came and Daniel comes and now you know said oh King and he began to give the dream a Sor statue and it was this and it was built and half of it was Clay and glass and brass and I saw this the chest was on this and everything and then it says in the end it said it said but then I saw a stone hallelujah hallelujah not built by any man's hand I saw a stone rolling down a Rock rolling down and he came and he took all the kingdoms of the earth and he roll it all the way to the ground what is that that's the kingdom that you come from my brother my sister we have been given a rock in this same time the word of God the kingdom that will never pass away God wants you to build your life upon that Kingdom because this Kingdom will pass away a kingdom from above that you can stand upon it ride down on Earth here and go back to heaven with it any other Foundation is sinking sand no matter how beautiful it looks it's only sinking sand but say in the message the unchangeable god with the unchangeable way it says now paragraph 53 it says now the word of God the written it says written in the Bible the word of God written in the Bible is his word to us every promise has the same power of creation Hallelujah behind it amen every promise every promise not one bigger than the other my brother my sister your success and I is to take the word of God to understand that he has the same power that's why the prophet will say the word of God will defeat the Devil any place any time under any circumstance he wasn't making it out the word of God the promised word of God when it's author when it comes out of his mouth and he spoken it will not return void until it fulfills that which he has spoken it for so the word of God it says every promise has the same power of creation behind it that's God that God word did at the beginning if we believe it and if we believe it to be the word of God depends on where the seed fall I say God let it fall upon the good seed of my heart I'm preparing my heart so the word can fall and produce that which you have spoken about and it fall into the ground it says the ground can be created can be created among moisture and nourishing around the promise of God will bring forth every promise every it says bring forth every promise the Bible made it says why it says the right man of attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to come to pass in the Harvest time he says the word paragraph 355 the word itself made flesh in you the word itself not not your effort not any the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour thank you Lord what are we running from you are the reflection of what the word is for this hour but when I'm going to talk about the Sun and the Moon the light that we see out of the Moon the Moon didn't create that the moon didn't create that all that God has made in fact the moon didn't position itself so it can do that job no God positioned the moon so that when the Sun goes down when the Sun goes down on our section that the sun will reflect through the Moon and the Earth will receive the same light but through the moon the same light of the Sun God is a allowing the moon to reflect that same light the same light of the son of man the same son of man you want to say the life of Jesus was I said yes the same life the same life that raised him from the dead the same life that said I call Lazarus come forth the same life that stood there and he opened the blind eyes the same life that raised the the dead that same life is in The Believer this morning don't diminish it don't don't let the cares of this life cover it don't think your situation is too grander understand that that same life is here to do the same thing for a reflection aren't you glad to be the moon this morning I don't have a light of my own all I'm doing is reflecting his light all I'm doing is absorbing his light and reflecting it to others I'm not creating anything I'm just there to be a reflector oh God I'm so thankful for your life I'm so thankful that you've called me to reflect to if it wasn't your life I would have been lost if it wasn't your love I wouldn't have any love the love that I have for the brother is only the love that comes from you that's the foundation that we need to be built upon whatam said the foundation we are called upon I'll just try to shorten it I know I'm Hing out of time it was speaking and it was say why is it so hard for people to live a Christian life then why is it that we find it so hard why are we caught it in the ups and the down and today we feel we are saved tomorrow we feel like we're not saved and today we have the victory tomorrow we feel like we are defeated and today we feel like we are sons of God tomorrow we feel butam says the reason is because we try to do it by intellectual understanding the reason is we try to do it the way we think what we need is the New Birth by the word of God what we need is to be born by the word of God the prophet is saying it's not the fixing of this whole carcasses and let me say this the Holy Spirit was not given so we can carry it on this flesh the Holy Spirit was given so that the inner man can have it so the inner man will look at this flesh and put it under subjection will there be a time where this man feel like he's got running away yes but it's the life inside that bring him under subjection it's the life inside that will look at him and say you are liar I'll bring you under subjection it's not given for us to walk the whole Earth every day feeling like we are in the sky no it's given for you to overcome the challenge of every day amen when you when the Devil comes and he gives you a punch you give him a punch back you tell him you call me a loser you call me all of that that's this flesh but in here there's the seat of God inside it you call me I don't have this I don't have that that's okay but I know that up there I have everything it's not given for us to just say oh I can't not good enough and I'm not beautiful enough I'm not this no that's the thing of the world I'm not that but one thing I'm not is I'm not a sinner I'm a Son of [Applause] God I don't have money yes that's okay but my father owns the cattle on the thousand it's not the fixing of the old but what says this man has got to die let me say this the quicker we die the quicker we'll have life the quicker we die from this flesh the quicker you know let me say this let's quit giving excuses for our sins and let's start dying to it you have something that's not okay you have a nature something that's not okay ask God to kill it ask him by his word and say father this is not okay and this keeps upsetting me I keep going through this and listen I believe you say that the holy spirit is your life coming into my life your holy spirit is the promise of a new creation you said that you will take this flesh you will suffocate it you'll bring it to die and you'll bring a new person I want to see that new person into existence it's the dying of every day let me say this you never stop dying and he said if you kill it don't go resurrected amen many time we get delivered of things and guess what oh the old phone gets in your hand and before too long we start it starts out in a very just innocent way well I like this and then an advertisement come back and like oh okay you know I don't want to watch that and then little by little is taking you right back and resurrecting the old man what about says you got to know the devil and every single one of his tricks you got to see when he comes with his trick and say I'm not going into that direction I've been saved I've been Sanctified the desire I don't have a desire in my heart to serve the devil my desire is to serve God and I want to live for him oh my say it's not I need to stop drinking oh I look at my life and said but Ben I want to stop drinking and smoking and doing all this things and then I'll be a good Christian he said it's not what you stop doing it's what you start doing everybody's caught into what they need to stop oh I got to stop this every time you say you know if you have anything you need help with every the only list that comes to bring up is all the we want to stop doing how about instead you bring a list of all that you want to you want to do instead of one you want to stop but says if you don't have the spirit of God it's just flesh flighting with flesh and he will never win what you need is an introduction of a man in the room one who will take care of everything one who's actually able to go to battle for you one when you go back into those things will keep you miserable you fill with a spirit and you go do something wrong you'll be the most miserable person there is oh I can't believe I did that I cannot believe I cannot why you're not enjoying it why because there's a new spirit in you it's given to keep you away from those things it's not oh let me let me let me say there every every day the devil is coming up with new tactics on how to trip you every day the devil is coming up with new brand new sins that you can partake of I can't come up here with a list of everything it's what we need to start doing it's not the word I don't want any part to do with it it's not the word of God I don't want anything to do with it but when I'm will say in the message you must be born again it says paragraph 67 this is preached in uh December 31st 1961 I'm going to try to get to a close quickly it says yes it says yes to be born again you must go through the process of death everything does he says you take the grain the the the grain of corn if the corn ever expect to live live again it's got to die first if the if a grain of wheat ever expect to live it's totally impossible for it it says that corn it says that wheat that flow the tree the grass the veget the vegetable everything ex expect to live again must die first then how are you going to how are you going to escape it you've got to die first you got to die how to your self die to everything to it says so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can't live again it's what we need we we don't want to continue to try to dress this old man and try to make excuses on why he not doing the word of God but R calls it a sticky nature it's a sticky nature this flesh is born from sin and it cannot be saved there's a soul in there that God wants to come and save and then it says he he that is born Earthly that born of the carnal cannot overcome the spiritual things it says you have to be born from above you have to be born new from above in order for you to overcome that it says a new paragraph 94 a new nature a new birth a new creation nature they says the nature of your father he says you have you you you believe and you you it says and you believe and you love every word that he said every it says every man's word Every Man's word is a lie contrary to the word it says this is God's word see the Bible's right it says I don't care what the church says the Bible is STO right to you it says because your Nature's been changed now and if you've got a Church Father you will believe in the church in that church father but if you got father God you'll believe in God's word am and if you got a father in the church you'll believe that because you are his you are of his nature that that's your father because if your father if your father father if God his father's God then you believe God's word if you are if you are Church you believe his word if you are his church you believe his word you believe the church world you believe the church word you believe what the church said but if you are born again then you'll believe what God said because God's your father not the world or or church Creed the Holy Ghost he says baptize you into the body for service but you believe unto eternal life he says my word and I believe and and believeth he says he that believe he that Hearth my word and Believe on him that send me has eternal life then you are baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of of into the body for the manifestation of the gifts and so forth but you believe to you believe to eternal life and he that believeth has eternal life and when you believe you when you believe is when you are dead and you are born and regenerated a new cre a new creature all right let me just say this it's important for us to pay close attention on what we are building my heart desire this morning is I want to be built upon Christ and Christ Alone the scripture will speak upon the wise men and the foolish men Matthew 7 and 24 and it will say and whosoever heareth this saying of mine and do with them I will liken unto him unto I liken him unto a wise man which built this house upon a rock and the rain descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat up the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that Hearth this saying of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man which build this house upon a sand and the rain descended and the flood came and the winds blew and blew upon the house and it fell and great was a fall of it so if you see one that's lacking unto a wise man it's the combination of hearing and doing they were both given the same Foundation to build upon which was the word but it's one who actually hear us and go and does is the one who's liken unto the one the wise men but to hear without an application is liken unto the foolish one and that has nothing to do with the word and and its ability to build a foundation it's there now remember the flood will come come that's not a question the rain will come but it's our ability to make sure that we are building upon the right foundation that is counting is our discernment to make sure that I am putting precept upon precept word upon word I am putting the word of God always before me like David said I've always set your word before me that I will not sin against you it's one who said that I will walk by the promises of God no matter how little I have because I know that when the flood will come God will protect me when I know when the winds will blow he will protect me when I know that when times will change when when challenges will come God will protect me David said in Psalm 18 and2 it says the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler my and the Horn of my salvation and my high tower I love that they said the Lord is my rock that's the foundation under which I want to understand is my Fortress is my protection he my deliverer he my God he my strength in whom I will trust he's my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and said in Psalm 62 and7 it says he is only my rock and my salvation he is my defense I have no defense of my own I have no protection I don't make provision for myself I don't go out and say well if the Lord doesn't do I got this discovered and I think that's what we do most of the time I'm going to ask but just in case God doesn't answer I got to way out is there somebody will say I will stand up and I will die if it doesn't answer and I'm okay to die is somebody will say God I'm standing here I am the scripture says if the Watchman of the house doesn't watch then all of our efforts are in vain if the Watchman doesn't stand there to watch and to protect every everything is in vain who's the Watchman he's the Watchman it's not our intelligence and our ability to uh uh Escape you know oh I got out of that just right in time like really you don't think there was a Watchman oh I escaped death in that accident oh if I didn't turn I just turn around in time really you don't think there was a Watchman oh I was about to be operated on and you know all the last minute somebody just asked let's go do I escaped that really there was a Watchman and if the Watchman doesn't do the job all our efforts are in vain butam says this in the message the spoken word it's original life I love this I'm coming to an end here it said I can I can paragraph 177 says how can you plant wheat here and we there and say I'm going to get cucumber think about it how can we constantly plant the world and the things of the world and constantly plant our intellect and expect to receive something else you know isn't that what they're calling sanity how can we do one thing and expect a different result it says it says and and whe here and cucumber here it says whe here you can't do that the only way way you got to do to get cucumber is to plant cucumber if you hybrid it it won't it says it won't it won't be a cucumber he'll be a hypocrite is that right he'll be a hypocrite friend you says you it'll be it'll be a hypocrite friend just got to say it it says it's neither one it's it isn't cucumber and what you when you I with it it says it's a it's a crossbreed it's a bad product it's dead to it in itself and it can't breed itself back uh no more it's dead right right there back he says he won't go back farther he says that's finished that finishes it he says that's all but if you want a cucumber start with cucumber I love the next one if you want a church start with the word of God if you want a church start with the word of God how many believe they are the Church of God this morning amen did you start with intellect did you come up with your own conclusion on how God was going to did you come up with a program on how God needs to save you no you were saved by a supernatural Way by a supernatural event God came and he revealed himself to you it says and if you want a church you want a church you start with with the word of God it says you want a life of God start with the word of God accept the word of God in its fullness every measure of it and then let and then it says and if it's the fullness of uh if it's the fullness of God in you then it will it will then the rain will fall it will produce exactly what's in your guarden thank you Lord God I want to plant the word of God on my heart I want to plant every promise that you said it will be I want to prant the the end time word of God in my heart I want to prant everything that you promise so that when the rain will fall the only thing I can produce is the word of God why because that's what's been planted there's no hybridation I planted it I'm going to skip so I can get towards the end he says here he it says here let me read this and then I'll jump through the last scripture it says in the church age the uh uh Pilgrim in church AG says now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pous age which was as yet 200 years off from the patma vision he says he knew that drift would cause them to go into the dark age he knew that he knew that the way it says that that the way may originally go away from the word from God by the first uh leaving the word it says and if you leave if you leave that word you have left [Music] God if you leave the word you have left God and I think we sometimes associate god with our emotion rather than the reality God is not our emotion it's not because I feel like God is there then he's there you may feel it you may not feel it God is the promise whether you feel it don't feel it is there amen if he's giving you the promise is there so you can't live the word of God with your emotion and think that God is still there no you have left them did talk about the artisian W it said you can cry all you want and says oh great water he says let flow in this direction no it's against the law it won't work it had you have to go according to the law of God in other words you have to go according to the word of God and how do you go you say God you said in your scripture that if one was a sinner will come that he will pray he said like like Jonah said that once more when I look towards the temple in Jerusalem and said when I'll pray you will hear my prayer now we're talking it says once more will I look towards the temple and when I'll pray you will hear my prayer why you are now coming to stand upon the law and God is obligated to he that's why he said when you are sick what do you do you find the word of God you find an example in the Bible in the message you said God this one came and it was SI they had this condition I come by the same token if God has ever done one thing one way he's obligated to do it again so when you leave the word you leave God so what we need is not to go by our emotion but he constantly come back to the word of God it's always come back however bad we feel you got to come back and find your condition in the word of God find the satisfying condition for God to come on the scene for you he even said he's going to heal you and he's going to ask you where you need healing for sorry I don't want to take to out time it says you left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pilgrimage and indeed all the church ages I am the word it says if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the Worden don't ever let any anyone or anything gets between you and that word not your family not your children not your job not your business not your wife not your children anybody don't let between you and I nothing between my savior and I why because if you do that then you will protect your family you will protect your wife you will protect everything you'll protect your job they will look and say well we got to lay off everybody you know like uh you know if you work for Amazon right now and trying to decide whether you're going to go to the office or not you know they're trying to find all of that if you put your trust on the word of God they can lay everybody off but if that job is yours God will keep you right there they'll look and say well we added the name on the list that disappear why because you have a watching a guiding angel watching over you let me just finish up with this the scripture will say if we could turn our Bibles I want you to just turn your scripture in Ezekiel 36 because brother Ram uses this scripture in why so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian Life and will end with it I I was just blessed just looking at the scripture and I want to say this before I read it this is the foundation for your life from the beginning till this time this is the foundation on how God is building his church how God is building his Believers and how God is building his kingdom you want to know how God is operating and how he's building his people what Foundation to stand on look at Ezekiel let's start from verse 22 he says there therefore say unto the house of Israel thou sayth the Lord I do I do I do I do not this for your sake oh House of Israel but for my holy s my holy name's sake which he have profane among the Heathen wherewith ye went my brother my sister we need to understand that life is not just about our you know we go about and says oh oh I wish I was this I was this you got to understand that you are part of the bigger plan that God is trying to put together you are only a piece of the puzzle in God's Great economy it's not just about you it's about what God is trying to do he says I'm doing this not for you but for my name's sake I want the nation to hear about me I want people to hear about my healing I want people to hear about my Deliverance I have a SE down there I'm not doing that's why sometimes when we look at ourselves and beat ourselves in the mirror all time we forgetting that there's a bigger picture there's one that has everything under control and it's not necessarily about you it's about what he trying to achieve you know imagine you know a a husband walking in and say I want to marry a person going to want to May marry a wife and find out that you are only a piece of the puzzle that the woman was looking for for well that would be terrible you know because it's the wife that's supposed to be the part of the puzzle of the husband it's the husband who has the plan but today you find you know women that have a plan you know I want to live this kind of life I want this kind of houses they just looking for somebody to finance it imagine you find that out what a disappointment and sometimes I believe that's how we treat God we create this own world that we want to live in how we want our life to be we oh we don't want any trials we want to go to heaven free like no temptation nothing who's building that house it's not about you it's about God the scripture says God will not share his glory with anybody we we partake of the glory glory of God when we become God when that's why the new birth is so important because what the new birth does it takes the mind that was in Christ and he places it in you what Christ like you start to like that's why when a wife marries a husband it's not the husband turning towards what the wife or the need of the wife it's the wife falling in love with the husband and everything that the husband like so he said that I'm not doing this just for your sake I you you have a part to play I've called you and I want you to understand this but I want you to know this is bigger than you this I'm doing this for my name's sake I'm doing it so the nation the the my name that he have profane that the nation will know I'm doing this so that you can understand that you are a piece of the puzzle of what I'm trying to do I'm doing it for my glory is God putting the picture together it's not us putting the picture he continues on it continues on and it says verse 23 it says I will sanctify my great name which ye have ye which was profane among the Heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and then it says and the hidden shall know that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God I shall be San ify in you before the rise it's God's sanctification in The Believer before the hidden it's not your own sanctification but it's his sanctification it's for his name's sake is for what he's trying to achieve that's why the best thing we can say for ourself is be it unto me according to Thy word it's not me trying to force things up it's just say God whatever you want I'll take it whatever Road you have for me I'll go the way it's not you trying to come up with your own plan for your own Redemption it's his Redemption it's saying it's he said but that sanctification of God will be manifested through your flesh God is going to come and do it through you so the nation the hidden that you have profaned the name before will know that there's a God that exists in 24 it says for I will take you from among the hidden and gather you out of all the countries all countries and will bring you into my own land god came into the world the scripture says ye that were part of the children of disobedient one time you were part of in the world God has gathered you together as a hand gathers his children so you could be a people that's called aside for his own sake for his name's sake he's calling us so we can manifest to him he's doing this for his own name's sake he's Gathering us from every country those that he had elected to be here and he says that to your own land oh God thank you for the land of promise thank you for Luke 17:30 thank you for Revelation 10:7 thank you for the why it says those those promises has open up to the Believers a new land that we can live under it says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols I will clean you it's not a Believer cleaning himself it's God cleaning the believer if you can ever understand that it's the love of God that save you you would have a different understanding about yourself we can't save ourself we can't do good to our own self in fact even when we try to do good we end up doing the wrong it's God who does good to you I will call you out I will sanctify you I will give you a land I will give you all that you have I'll be your provider I'll give you if you don't have bread I'll give you bread it's God's doing he said I will sanctify you that's why I said earlier on a Believer is not one that comes and say well I'll sanctify myself then I become he says no that's not the way to do it because the next verse it says a new heart will I also give you I will give you a new spirit and I will put my spirit into your spirit I will take away the Stony hearts of Flesh the Stony hearts out of your flesh and then I will give you a heart of Flesh God building the believer at the end it's his testimony being lived through US amen we walk around and some feel like they've achieved their own achievement praise God I'm a Believer praise God I believe the message of the hour those are hidden he called you among from the heathens you were not different we're not different from the people walking on the street that's right we we could have been those people in a moment notice we could have been if if it wasn't for the love of God if it wasn't for the election of God we could have been the church down the street and guess what we'll be preaching we are right that's right you think they think they're wrong what a deception you could only have seen the message because he open your eyes to it if the musician could come he says and I will put my spirit with continue I will cause you to walk in my statue and ye shall keep my judgment and do them and let me say this you couldn't obey the word of God if you wanted to but says it's not even by sincerity you're not a son of God because you are sincere you become sincere in the process it's not by there's more people that are more sincere more loving more kindness more everything but God didn't choose them he chose you this morning why is so we can come let me say this I say the celebration at the end is when we play the pictures of everything that is done and how that he came along and what he done for us how that he took us out of sin how that he protected us from death when we can understand the love of God that's been shed abroad for us that's the thing that makes us more happy he said I will cause you the only reason you do the works of God is because God allows you to do it God placed something in your heart remember the law was set up so that so much so that flesh no flesh was able to fulfill it even the very Pharisees that washed the pots and pens and everything but when the the but Jesus looked at them and says unless your righteousness exceed this righteousness it wasn't about the righteousness what was it about it was about God's choice God choosing those people that oh your disciples they don't wash their hands and look at them and all of that well what was the difference there were chosen but the others were not that's the foundation God wants us to stand on let's all stand this [Applause] morning and then it says and he shall dwell in the land that I gave to your father and ye shall be my people and I will be your God let me say this morning I don't want to stand up on my own understanding I don't want to stand up on My Own Foundation I say this morning I want to stand on the foundation that he has built I want my life every day when I make a decision I want to be mindful that there's a foundation that's been laid for me and that's the foundation I need to work on I want when I think I want when I meet the challenge I want when I fail I want when I do wrong to be mindful of the foundation and say it's not myself Lord you have given me a foundation a place that I can stand let me say this we struggle so much but says there's so much ups and downs in the Christian life and all of that he said then the reason is we need to be born again and I don't mean to say you don't have the Holy Spirit we need to continually die it's not a one-time process it's a daily dying it's the daily surrendering it's the Daily Commitment it's the daily prayer it's the daily praying for that sweet Spirit to come over you it's the daily reading of the Bible and letting God reveal himself it's the daily inspiration what says that the Holy Spirit was sent to be let to let the church to lead the church but the problem is we are trying to lead ourselves every day we come up with our own plan I'm going to do this and then I'm this I'm going to we failed to take those friends to him and let him lead us he knows what we have need of he he's asking us he's only asking us to be built upon the foundation that he's given us why because heaven and earth will pass away but his word shall not pass away let's just bow our heads sorry looks like I went a little longer than I expected if you have a need upon your heart this morning may you just say on your heart and say Lord perhap perhaps I didn't walk on the foundation Foundation that you wanted me to walk on perhaps I didn't so many times make a decision based on that Foundation I I just trampled it and I walked away but Lord this morning I'm willing to come back to that Foundation Lord I built a house on the sand and I sent it crumbled time and time again and I see it fall down and I try to build it falls down I try to build it breaks down every time I try but Lord this time I want to try to build it upon you and your word Lord I want to build it and and just walk away and know that no matter what I've built it upon you is that your heart desire this morning just lift your hand up to him and say Lord let me build be built upon you you are the only Firm Foundation you are the only certain thing that there is upon the face of the Earth Lord I want to be built upon you our gracious father we're so thankful this morning and Lord we just want to lift our voices to you Lord and ask father may you just come by our way and make your word a reality to us father your children we've gathered here this morning and Lord no doubt we have needs and we have lackings and things that we have not done right and but Lord we want to come like the scripture says in Ezekiel that I'm doing this for my name's sake I'm doing this so the nation will see your life and they will testify of me father let us testify of you oh God let us testify of what we have received not of a man but of you oh God may you just come and walk into the aisles and every uplifted hands oh God no matter small or big or whatever it is and father there's nothing big before you Lord and we come asking that father you just come and give us a portion of yourself Lord father activate that portion of you that's in US Lord father that we may be aware and constantly walk according to it and not walk according to our own mind oh God and Father forgive us if we've done wrong forgive us where we've gone wrong and let the blood of your son Jesus wash us of all unclean us and build us and place us Lord nobody can place himself upon this Foundation you look at Peter and say that flesh and blood has not revealed this in you it's my father and it's a Divine revealing mystery that God it says it's my father that gave it to you Lord give us that Revelation this morning that we may walk by it that we may talk by it that everything we do we may do by it Lord once again remember our pastor this morning Lord and just be with them as they get in and want to commit what we are to you and pray Lord that we don't want to live out of here Lord with someone who has a need that's not an answer but just go and minister to them we commit it to you and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen why don't we sing that song my my hope is built I believe my hope is built on nothing left than Jesus blood and righteousness I did not
