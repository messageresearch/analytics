[29:30] can meet with you and worship you under
[29:33] that shed blood
[29:35] father and without that covering father
[29:37] without that provided place
[29:41] Lord man could never make contact with

[30:07] Lord
[30:08] we just ask you to bless our service
[30:10] this evening with your presence and with
[30:14] the inspiration of your word father and
[30:17] with revelation
[30:18] that we can walk from here closer to you
[30:21] we ask it in Jesus precious and
[30:24] wonderful name we pray amen amen God

[30:34] good amen so
[30:38] um we certainly want to welcome you all
[30:40] tonight as you can see we've been
[30:43] blessed to have brother uh uh Jeremy
[30:46] with us and we're good musicians yet you
[30:49] can go I'm not going to sing
[30:53] um I'm gonna have brother Jeremy sing
[30:55] for me
[30:57] that's good but we want to uh welcome
[31:00] some of his family here uh sister
[31:03] Hannah's with us and where are you
[31:05] sister hen I just are you here okay good
[31:09] to see you again Lord bless you it's
[31:11] nice to have you and then I think Jason
[31:13] and Heather that's Jeremy's little
[31:16] brother I believe where are you Jeremy
[31:19] can I are you here somewhere okay God
[31:22] bless you uh I'm sure if you had this
[31:26] for an older brother you have a spot in
[31:27] heaven
[31:28] for sure you've got character I I
[31:32] they're in I guarantee it and and and
[31:34] then and brother Sean and sister Naomi
[31:37] they're been friends with us for a long
[31:39] time God bless you wherever you are
[31:41] you're happy but uh I I love brother
[31:44] Jeremy I love his spirit I love his
[31:46] ministry
[31:47] I love the dedication that he has to the
[31:52] work that's God has given him uh the
[31:56] humility that he has uh going about the
[31:59] duties you know you meet a lot of people
[32:01] all they're interested in doing is
[32:03] climbing the ladder and uh and I just
[32:06] preach him he's just interested in
[32:08] sharing the gospel with whoever will
[32:11] have ear to let the love of God be shed
[32:14] abroad in his heart uh wherever he comes
[32:17] in contact with and and The more I've
[32:20] had fellowship with him and The more
[32:22] I've got uh to know him the more I like
[32:25] being around him and the more I
[32:28] appreciate them so I really think we're
[32:30] blessed but I do have to admit that I'm
[32:33] jealous
[32:35] of him and some people it's just not
[32:39] fair
[32:40] they can preach and sing both
[32:43] and
[32:45] I I would have been glad to have one or
[32:47] the other
[32:48] but you know I don't have neither really
[32:51] but it really is nice so we're I'm gonna
[32:54] before he comes ministers to us uh I I
[32:58] I'm going to ask him to minister Us in
[33:01] song and and uh I know it'll be a
[33:04] blessing both his singing and his
[33:06] preaching I thought you know brother
[33:07] Jeremy you can create the very anointing
[33:10] that you're going to preach under by
[33:12] singing
[33:13] I thought now that's what I call
[33:16] having the control of his Service as I
[33:19] know it's the Holy Spirit Jeremy you're
[33:22] loved here
[33:23] that's the one thing I want you to know
[33:25] these people love you love you very much
[33:27] God bless you uh thank you the service
[33:30] is yours without fear or favor
[33:36] well I believe that my wife has called
[33:38] with me Ministry so please come to the
[33:41] piano
[33:42] she's she's not going to be left out on
[33:44] this one so
[33:47] um it's a song that I probably have sang
[33:49] here before and maybe you know it I just
[33:51] uh I was gonna try to not sing tonight
[33:54] and so
[33:55] when he said you're gonna sing I had to
[33:57] scramble and this is the first thing
[33:58] that came to my heart it's this old song
[34:01] that's been sung many years in my church
[34:02] and again if you have the words you can
[34:04] put them up there if not that's fine but
[34:06] it's called boundless love
[34:08] unending Joy you do know that one right
[34:13] I probably should have asked that first
[34:16] um are we going to sing acapella but I
[34:18] do want to say that it's a privilege to
[34:19] be here tonight once again to see your
[34:21] wonderful I hope smiling faces maybe
[34:25] some not yet but I I want to ask you the
[34:28] question while she's getting ready to to
[34:30] play this is I know you're here tonight
[34:33] but why are you here
[34:35] ask yourself that question just simple
[34:37] question why are you here perhaps you
[34:40] can come up with an easy answer well
[34:41] because it's the right thing to do well
[34:44] it's Church isn't it I need to be here
[34:46] but really why are you here tonight what
[34:48] do you want to get out of this
[34:50] whether it's your pastor ministering
[34:52] tonight me or another Minister that you
[34:55] have or another evangelist
[34:57] we can't do anything for you we
[34:59] understand it's by the foolishness of
[35:01] preaching the faithful Ministry is
[35:02] important God never did get rid of that
[35:05] we're thankful for that
[35:07] but other other than the fact you are
[35:10] here tonight what do you want to get out
[35:11] of this service tonight and as we sing
[35:13] this song this is just my testimony it's
[35:15] it's uh boundless love unending Joy
[35:19] this is my life
[35:23] the song says it's what I know but I
[35:25] like to add it it's all I know
[35:27] you say what do you mean brother Jeremy
[35:29] you know a lot of things yes I know a
[35:30] lot of things we all know a lot of
[35:32] things but I want this to be the most
[35:33] important thing that we know I can't
[35:37] believe that he selected me and I know
[35:38] we can we can get all spiritual and
[35:41] religious tonight and we say oh it had
[35:43] to be it had to be me I get that but
[35:45] really when you think about our Humanity
[35:46] it's the grace of God that we're sitting
[35:49] here tonight and I just want to give him
[35:51] this opportunity so let's just sing it
[35:53] together if we can
[35:55] boundless
[35:57] love
[36:00] unending Joy
[36:03] this is my life
[36:07] it's all I know lord I can't believe
[36:15] that you selected me
[36:20] Jesus my Lord
[36:24] it's you I owe
[36:28] Jesus my Lord
[36:32] it's you I owe
[36:37] oh and he keeps me when I'm weary he can
[36:43] hear me when I pray he's even there
[36:48] beside me when I fall
[36:53] his love surrounds me
[36:58] even when I go astray I know I'd have to
[37:05] say that he's my
[37:09] home
[37:11] boundless love
[37:15] unending Joy this is this is my life
[37:22] it's all I know and Lord I can't believe
[37:30] that you selected me
[37:35] Jesus my Lord
[37:39] it's you I oh
[37:43] Jesus my Lord
[37:46] it's you I oh oh in my world Falls all
[37:54] around me I call upon his name and just
[38:01] in time he takes me by the head
[38:07] his ways are perfect
[38:10] look just like a son who bore my shame
[38:16] oh when I don't even have to understand
[38:22] sing it boundless

[38:30] life

[40:36] word would penetrate their heart Lord
[40:38] whatever the needs are tonight in the
[40:40] building father you know it that's why
[40:42] we serve you we have confidence tonight
[40:44] that it's already done it's more than a
[40:47] song to The Believer but it's a reality
[40:50] so we surrender our thoughts to you now
[40:52] our intentions father our emotions we
[40:54] give everything to you and ask that you
[40:56] would move in a special way and we ask
[40:58] this in your precious Wonderful Name the
[41:01] name of Jesus the churches together says
[41:03] amen God bless you while you're standing
[41:07] would you mind just open your Bibles to
[41:09] the Book of Genesis chapter 3 I do want
[41:12] to say it's also good to have a few of
[41:13] my folks from Amarillo here with me I
[41:16] can call them all family really I even
[41:18] accept brother Sean
[41:20] and if anyone knows him you know that's
[41:22] tough and it takes the Holy Ghost
[41:24] but if you don't you will learn
[41:26] eventually
[41:28] but no it is a it is it is it is a
[41:31] privilege though to have them here and I
[41:33] know that um I I'm glad to be here
[41:36] tonight and I just trust that the Lord
[41:38] would just bless you verse 16 what we're
[41:41] going to read here is actually kind of
[41:43] the second part is what's what our our
[41:45] foundation is tonight we just want to
[41:48] talk to you for a few moments I
[41:49] understand it's Wednesday and that
[41:50] you're tired just ask God would move in
[41:52] your heart says and unto the woman he
[41:55] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[41:57] and thy conception and and sorrow Thou
[42:00] shalt bring forth children and this is
[42:02] where we want to take our foundation
[42:03] tonight and thy desire
[42:06] shall be to thy husband
[42:08] and he shall rule over thee God bless
[42:11] you can be seated this evening
[42:14] trust by the end of this service that
[42:16] this scripture Foundation would
[42:19] would be something that you would
[42:21] understand
[42:22] I want to start with a question tonight
[42:24] just a simple question I don't want to
[42:26] go I just kind of want to be simple if I
[42:28] can for you this evening
[42:30] first of all why or why did Genesis 1 1
[42:33] have to happen
[42:36] why did God create why did he have to
[42:39] create
[42:40] was there a need was it was it needful
[42:43] that there should be a creation was it
[42:45] needful that there should be light
[42:46] spoken was it needful that there should
[42:48] be an earth and the universe and all of
[42:50] these things
[42:51] now we as Believers we can look to the
[42:54] prophet which is kind of what I want to
[42:55] do in the beginning here I want to read
[42:56] some quotes if you wouldn't mind and
[42:59] brother Branham says what is God
[43:01] God is a great eternal
[43:04] at the beginning way back before there
[43:06] was a beginning he wasn't even God did
[43:08] you know that
[43:10] God is an object of worship
[43:12] and there wasn't nothing to worship Him
[43:15] he lived alone and in him was attributes
[43:19] what is an attribute a thought now now
[43:22] you'll get something that will border on
[43:24] the lesson for tonight notice he was his
[43:27] attributes that was in him now it was in
[43:29] him to be father
[43:32] it was in him to be God
[43:34] it was in him to be son
[43:36] it was in him to be savior it was in him
[43:39] to be healer and all these things here
[43:42] are just displaying his attributes
[43:45] there is nothing out of order
[43:49] you think God didn't see the end from
[43:51] the beginning
[43:53] certainly he did this is this is
[43:56] highlighted here there's nothing out of
[43:59] order
[44:01] it's just displaying his attributes
[44:04] so we're going to continue this and I'm
[44:06] sorry I didn't tell you where we're at
[44:07] we're in the identified Christ of all
[44:09] ages and 64. it says now God uh is or
[44:12] like a great being in the beginning God
[44:14] see he he wasn't even God to begin with
[44:17] God is an object of worship there wasn't
[44:19] nothing to worship him he was
[44:21] self-existent Elohim and there wasn't
[44:24] nothing to worship him when he created
[44:26] angels then there was something to
[44:27] worship him but in this great God Elohim
[44:30] was attributes there was attributes in
[44:33] there to be God attributes to be father
[44:34] attributes to be sun attributes to be
[44:37] savior attributes to be healer all these
[44:39] attributes was in God and if you've ever
[44:41] got eternal life you were in God's
[44:45] attributes oh my
[44:48] our thought tonight is simply and we're
[44:50] going to continue reading this but our
[44:51] tonight our thought tonight is simply a
[44:53] desire for God and I pray that it would
[44:56] be an encouragement a desire for God so
[44:58] we're we're finding here through our
[45:00] Prophet again that everything is you
[45:02] were in God's thinking now Satan wants
[45:05] to get that out of your head he wants to
[45:07] get that out of your life he wants to
[45:09] get that he wants you to be surrounded
[45:10] by circumstances and forget that you as
[45:13] a Believer was in the mind of God
[45:15] now he might have to breed this with
[45:17] that and down here and and down here
[45:19] like a man making Chimes for the church
[45:21] put in so much brass and so much iron
[45:24] and gets it just at the right pitch
[45:27] the Mulder knows how to put it in
[45:30] if he doesn't he doesn't get the right
[45:33] ring oh I don't care what Satan says it
[45:37] sounds like I want to know what the
[45:38] Mulder says
[45:40] and God knows exactly oh brothers and
[45:43] sisters God knows exactly where you
[45:46] belong
[45:48] and what age you belong in
[45:51] oh Satan loves to throw away am I even
[45:53] here why am I going to this because God
[45:56] knew there had to be a body of people
[45:58] that would be able to handle the
[46:00] pressures of this age
[46:02] that's why you're here God don't make no
[46:05] mistakes
[46:07] Hallelujah I'm getting excited sorry
[46:09] that's just the way it is and therefore
[46:11] if you've got eternal life
[46:13] the word Eternal is something never did
[46:17] begin never can end so whoever you were
[46:22] see you were always were you were God's
[46:25] attributes being displayed a capital
[46:28] w-o-r-d word in the beginning was the
[46:32] word can't you see yourself there
[46:34] brothers and sisters oh Hallelujah my
[46:37] goodness and and the word is a thought
[46:39] made manifest you think it then speak it
[46:43] like I'd say the light I had to think
[46:46] light before Oh My but I had to think
[46:50] light before I said light microphone I
[46:53] have to say or I have to think
[46:54] microphone to say microphone and we are
[46:58] God's attributes displayed
[47:02] so God knows why you're here tonight I
[47:04] asked you do you know why you're here
[47:06] tonight you know Satan likes our minds
[47:08] to get clouded on why we're here and
[47:11] what our purpose is because sometimes we
[47:13] get caught up in the doing of life and
[47:15] we forget the soul of life
[47:19] tonight that's kind of what I want to
[47:20] deal with if you wouldn't would allow me
[47:22] to because I want to get to your heart
[47:24] I want to deal with your heart tonight
[47:28] the word need means it to require
[47:31] something
[47:33] because it is essential or very
[47:37] important that's the word need
[47:39] the word desire is a strong feeling of
[47:44] wanting
[47:45] uh to have something or wishing for
[47:49] something to happen
[47:52] there are many things in life that we
[47:54] need
[47:55] right and there are many needs
[47:59] that are in life
[48:01] say why are you slowing down because I
[48:03] want I really want you to think about it
[48:05] as humans we are without a doubt because
[48:08] it's what we are we are doers
[48:12] it's a in a sense a need we take care of
[48:16] things because we need to
[48:18] right we have careers we have jobs we
[48:22] have hobbies we run companies we have
[48:24] Bible studies we manage households we
[48:27] manage calendars or uh we feed our
[48:30] families we feed our pets or we mow the
[48:32] lawn or we we we buy birthday gifts or
[48:35] we serve we do that's what Humanity does
[48:40] we are full of needs we are a needful
[48:43] people and we are in humanity doers
[48:48] you did something this week whether you
[48:50] liked it or not you had to do something
[48:52] some of you had to fill up the car
[48:54] because it needed it
[48:56] some of you had to feed your children
[48:58] because they needed it some of you had
[49:00] to feed your husband because he needed
[49:02] it
[49:03] you've with me now
[49:05] Ecclesiastes 3 tells us that there's a
[49:08] time and purpose for things
[49:12] for needs in life
[49:14] our marriages see this
[49:17] what I need to do for my spouse
[49:21] as if it is only our duty
[49:24] when we look to God we often carry the
[49:27] same attitude
[49:30] let that sink in what should I do God
[49:34] where do you want me to volunteer
[49:36] how can I get involved in the church how
[49:39] can I make other disciples why should my
[49:42] what should my prayer time look like
[49:44] what does the church need
[49:47] we're doers
[49:49] because that's what we do
[49:51] now I want to just stop there for a
[49:53] minute and say that what I'm saying what
[49:54] we're saying is this is not so much that
[49:56] it's wrong
[49:57] because we need that in the body I said
[50:00] need
[50:01] because we do we need doers in the
[50:03] church if we didn't have doers in the
[50:05] church it would get nowhere
[50:07] but I want us to ask ourselves the
[50:09] question whether you're married tonight
[50:11] it's got to be more than need
[50:13] if you're a deacon it's got to be more
[50:15] than a need if we're a pastor I'm a
[50:18] pastor it's got to be more than than a
[50:19] duty if we're a song leader or if we're
[50:22] just a church member I need to go to
[50:24] church because I just need to the
[50:27] question is is it more than it's it can
[50:30] it be more than just a need
[50:34] because all throughout the gospels we
[50:36] see people asking Jesus what to do
[50:41] I want you to let that sink in I I'm not
[50:44] asking you not to leave tonight and say
[50:46] not to ever ask Jesus what to do but I
[50:48] want you to understand why you're asking
[50:49] the question they ask Jesus what to do
[50:52] they approached Jesus the same way that
[50:54] they would approach the rest of their
[50:55] life
[50:57] the same way you would go to your
[50:58] teacher and say what do I need to do to
[51:00] pass this test
[51:01] they go to Jesus what do I need to do
[51:03] for you
[51:04] the same way that we go to our employ
[51:06] our employer what do I need to do to to
[51:08] be to have better benefits
[51:10] we tend to make our relationship and
[51:12] church the same way what do I need to do
[51:14] to have a better life
[51:16] and instead of instead of saying Lord
[51:19] what you know what let's just look in
[51:21] this and find a question John 6 28 then
[51:23] they said unto him what shall we do
[51:25] that we might work the works of God
[51:29] acts 16 30 and brought them out and said
[51:32] sirs what must I do to be saved
[51:36] Mark a 10 17 and when he was gone forth
[51:39] into the way there came one running and
[51:40] kneeled to him and and asked him good
[51:42] Master what shall I do
[51:45] that I may inherit internal life
[51:49] what do we see here we see the humanity
[51:51] in these questions
[51:54] and again I'm not trying to throw forth
[51:55] discouragement tonight I'm glad that
[51:57] you're here I'm glad that you need
[51:58] Church
[51:59] but I'm asking is there more than that
[52:02] yet if you see the answers that were
[52:05] given through all of
[52:11] all of zire's then are doing
[52:14] I read this question this thought this
[52:17] question and it hit me deeply and the
[52:19] question was is are you feeding
[52:21] or feeding off of Jesus
[52:24] ask yourself am I feeding or feeding off
[52:28] of Jesus
[52:29] I believe uh the one of the the brother
[52:31] that made the prayer tonight mentioned
[52:33] it says Lord we want to we want to sit
[52:35] at your table we want to we want to eat
[52:36] with you
[52:38] Luke 10 38 you know the scripture but
[52:40] let's just turn it together or just
[52:41] follow along it says now it came to pass
[52:43] as they went that he entered into a
[52:45] certain Village and a certain woman
[52:46] named Martha received him into her house
[52:51] and she had a sister called Mary which
[52:54] also sat at Jesus feet and heard his
[52:57] word
[52:58] but Martha was cumbered about much
[53:01] serving what does that word simply mean
[53:03] distracted
[53:04] Martha was distracted about much serving
[53:09] and came to him and said Lord Dost thou
[53:12] not care that my sister had led me to
[53:14] serve alone
[53:16] none of y'all have ever been there
[53:20] never okay maybe I lied there
[53:23] because I'm feeling a spirit of
[53:24] agreeance
[53:26] why am I the only one doing this again I
[53:29] want you to understand something I am
[53:30] not trying to downgrade and say that you
[53:34] should be lazy
[53:36] but I'm saying we need to we need to
[53:38] have a different Viewpoint of why we do
[53:40] what we do
[53:43] she was so distracted about it she was
[53:46] she followed Jesus can I say she was a
[53:49] message believer
[53:52] but she became caught up and distracted
[53:54] in the doing and the needs of life and
[53:57] lost the soul of it
[54:01] bid her therefore that she should help
[54:03] me I mean Brother David you need to tell
[54:05] them to come and help me I'm all alone
[54:08] here
[54:12] amen hallelujah
[54:14] and Jesus answered and sent under Martha
[54:16] Martha you are right
[54:20] am I hello somebody help me out here
[54:22] that's not what he said
[54:24] I'm not I guess I am trying to trick you
[54:26] but I want you to give me an answer here
[54:29] Martha Martha you are right
[54:31] thank you Hallelujah you're listening
[54:35] I might have just had to turn it over
[54:37] already
[54:38] Thou Art careful Thou Art anxious and
[54:42] troubled about many things
[54:46] but one thing is needful
[54:49] and Mary hath chosen the good part now I
[54:53] want you hey if you're thinking carnally
[54:55] tonight you're thinking that Jesus is
[54:57] rewarding laziness because you're still
[54:59] in the carnal mind
[55:00] he's not rewarding laziness
[55:04] he is rewarding the person that is
[55:07] sitting at his feet listening to the
[55:09] word of God
[55:14] which shall not be taken from her now
[55:18] take it how you want to take it but in
[55:20] this line of thought I believe that Mary
[55:22] and Martha are not two different types
[55:25] of people
[55:26] but I believe that they are the same but
[55:29] with a choice
[55:31] just as tonight we are we and it's in a
[55:34] sense we are what we call Believers but
[55:37] we are believers with a choice we can
[55:39] choose to be a believer that is just
[55:41] filled with needs need to do this and
[55:45] need to do this and need but have no
[55:47] desire or no soul in it and then you
[55:49] become weary remember the scripture says
[55:51] be not weary and well doing
[55:54] Kate so you're not just doing it because
[55:56] you have to do it but you do it because
[55:58] there's a burden listen I'm going to
[56:00] tell you there would be a lot of pastors
[56:01] that wouldn't be pastors today if they
[56:03] didn't have the burden
[56:05] because if you think it's just about
[56:06] getting behind a Pulpit and preaching a
[56:08] sermon you got it wrong
[56:10] okay it takes a desire it takes a
[56:13] something that you that that the the
[56:15] normal human being cannot see
[56:19] and you might be their best bud and
[56:21] still can't see what a pastor goes
[56:23] through
[56:24] I don't know where that came from but it
[56:26] went
[56:27] Mary and Martha so listen so either we
[56:30] will be busy feeding God
[56:32] or we will feed on him
[56:35] either we will be distracted with work
[56:39] or we will sit in complete worship
[56:42] either we will come in with our own
[56:44] ideas
[56:45] or we open our hands in complete
[56:48] surrender
[56:50] either we are in charge
[56:53] or we weep at the feet of our master
[56:56] these two women give us a picture of the
[57:00] internal choice that we have
[57:03] anything that we place between us and
[57:06] God is an idol it's idolatry and we
[57:10] found that uh that that even back in the
[57:13] Old Testament because you know the the
[57:14] types and shadows of greater things to
[57:16] come that those remember the the the the
[57:19] the Israelites that were blotted out
[57:23] the tribes why were they blotted out
[57:25] because they were the leaders of
[57:27] idolatry
[57:29] their idolatry blotted them out in the
[57:33] New Testament and you say well I'm a
[57:35] believer I'm a message believer I follow
[57:37] the message they follow the message
[57:41] Judas was a message follower
[57:44] Judah seen the first pull
[57:47] Judas seeing the second Paul Judas was
[57:50] there with the third pull
[57:53] oh praise God we're in the third pool
[57:55] are you
[57:57] so the question is that I want to be
[57:59] more than just someone than just a
[58:01] follower a doer I know listen please be
[58:04] I understand that the Bible talks about
[58:06] being doers all right but I want you to
[58:08] go to the heart of the matter
[58:11] Hallelujah I want you to take note of
[58:14] the deeper aspect of this Jesus didn't
[58:17] say Jesus did not come and say well your
[58:20] working is important
[58:22] thank you for serving me I see how
[58:24] you're giving to the kingdom
[58:26] he said you're worried and upset about
[58:28] many things
[58:30] but few things are needed and indeed
[58:32] only one Mary has chosen what is better
[58:35] and it's not going to be taken away from
[58:37] her
[58:39] see God does not need our help
[58:43] it
[58:45] see you can leave this place carnal be
[58:47] like there it is I don't have to go to
[58:48] church anymore there it is I don't have
[58:51] to to I don't have to help Brother David
[58:53] anymore there it is though you're in the
[58:55] wrong frame of mind
[58:58] he doesn't need our help but he wants
[59:00] our relationship
[59:02] God doesn't need our doing he wants our
[59:05] desire
[59:06] he isn't looking externally at our
[59:09] actions and how hard we're working for
[59:11] the kingdom and steady is looking at our
[59:13] motivation our heart and our hunger for
[59:17] him
[59:18] he doesn't want just our doing he wants
[59:22] our desire
[59:23] notice this you say brother Jeremy I
[59:26] disagree with you on that well I'll give
[59:27] you scripture for it found in Romans
[59:28] chapter 9 verse 30. it kind of it
[59:31] explains it very well it says what shall
[59:33] we say then
[59:35] that the Gentiles which followed not
[59:37] after righteousness have attained to
[59:40] righteousness even the righteousness
[59:42] which is
[59:44] of faith
[59:47] but Israel
[59:49] which followed after the law of
[59:52] righteousness hath not attained to the
[59:55] law of righteousness wherefore because
[59:58] they sought it not by faith
[1:00:03] but as it were by The Works of the law
[1:00:06] they so they sought it by works
[1:00:10] by law by doing so don't bring to God
[1:00:14] you're doing don't bring to God your
[1:00:15] legalism don't bring to God how many
[1:00:17] times you showed to church don't bring
[1:00:19] to God that you're the biggest highest
[1:00:21] payer don't bring them to God all these
[1:00:23] things that you do he wants to see your
[1:00:25] faith
[1:00:27] not a faith in a building not faith in a
[1:00:30] in a in a person but faith in his word
[1:00:34] his word is capital
[1:00:37] it's of utmost importance
[1:00:41] for they stumbled
[1:00:43] at that stumbling Stone why because it
[1:00:47] was all law to them
[1:00:48] Hey listen even the prophet of God made
[1:00:50] a statement he said their works out did
[1:00:52] everybody's
[1:00:56] let that sink in for a minute
[1:00:58] these these and this is why you can't
[1:01:01] this is why now again this is just my
[1:01:03] feeling so just bear with me this is why
[1:01:05] I'm not the kind of person that wants to
[1:01:07] sit across the table from a religious
[1:01:09] person
[1:01:10] because they'll never understand it
[1:01:13] they'll never understand because it's
[1:01:15] all here
[1:01:16] you cannot debate with religion
[1:01:21] Jesus did not debate with Satan he just
[1:01:24] said it is written
[1:01:26] well you know we have I know of people
[1:01:28] that are that are at our job and and
[1:01:30] that and we'll bring something up and
[1:01:32] they'll say well show me in the Bible
[1:01:33] and we will and they'll be but still
[1:01:38] they're not willing to change or tumult
[1:01:40] to that because their thoughts are
[1:01:43] greater than God's and to some it's just
[1:01:46] not revealed so I want to be careful on
[1:01:49] that too to understand that there are
[1:01:50] those that are not bride
[1:01:54] it's a different sermon for itself
[1:01:57] as it is written behold I lay in Zion
[1:02:00] The Stumbling stone and rock of offense
[1:02:02] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:02:05] be ashamed
[1:02:08] what are you saying brother Jeremy I'm
[1:02:09] saying I'm glad that you're here tonight
[1:02:10] I'm glad that you worshiped I'm saying
[1:02:12] that
[1:02:13] your pastor is glad that you're here
[1:02:15] tonight he wants Church uh he wants his
[1:02:19] people to come to the house of God and
[1:02:20] worship God that's his burden as a
[1:02:22] pastor that's a burden of every Pastor
[1:02:25] for you to be there and but to have
[1:02:27] heart when you're here
[1:02:29] he doesn't want you to just have a
[1:02:30] position
[1:02:32] I want you to have heart
[1:02:34] you husbands don't just need to be a
[1:02:37] husband by law
[1:02:39] you wives don't just need to be alive by
[1:02:42] law
[1:02:44] we cannot be just pastors by law but by
[1:02:47] heart but by word
[1:02:49] what's your motivation
[1:02:52] see it's not a Pursuit based on works
[1:02:54] alone but by faith
[1:02:57] if there is a weakness in your
[1:02:58] relationship let's look at something if
[1:03:01] there is a weakness tonight let's just
[1:03:04] if there's a weakness sometimes we have
[1:03:06] to be honest with ourselves
[1:03:08] it is not a change in your prayer time
[1:03:12] that will make you want more of God
[1:03:15] but wanting more of God
[1:03:17] will change your prayer
[1:03:22] you ever just try oh and make God of all
[1:03:24] kinds of promises
[1:03:26] I'm going to do better I'm going to do
[1:03:27] better
[1:03:28] it was all mainly up here
[1:03:32] okay
[1:03:34] wanting more of God changes your
[1:03:36] calendar
[1:03:38] wanting more a God will change your
[1:03:41] priorities
[1:03:42] you see it's not a doing problem that
[1:03:45] makes prayer time boring
[1:03:47] it's not a doing problem that makes us
[1:03:49] prefer social media over time in the
[1:03:51] Bible it's a desire problem
[1:03:54] I hear it now bless God I'm not on
[1:03:56] social media so I'm okay no let's just
[1:03:59] all look at our own lives
[1:04:03] what is our inward desires or
[1:04:06] motivations can I ask you that question
[1:04:07] what is your inner desire
[1:04:09] and motivation psalms 27 4 One Thing
[1:04:15] I probably don't you probably don't have
[1:04:16] to turn there you already know what it
[1:04:18] is one thing have I desired well but
[1:04:21] brother Jeremy no no one thing have I
[1:04:24] desired of the Lord
[1:04:26] and that will I seek after brother
[1:04:30] Matthew it's more than just doing but
[1:04:33] it's seeking it's Desiring it's
[1:04:35] hungering for more one thing
[1:04:38] have I desired of the Lord that will I
[1:04:40] seek him that I may dwell in the house
[1:04:43] of the Lord all the days of my life
[1:04:49] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:04:52] inquire in his Temple why are you here
[1:04:54] tonight not to just show up to another
[1:04:57] church service but I'm longing to be
[1:04:59] with him I'm longing to be with brothers
[1:05:01] and sisters of light precious faith I'm
[1:05:04] longing to encourage God bless you my
[1:05:06] brother God bless you my sister you have
[1:05:08] been through some battles this week you
[1:05:10] have been through some difficult times
[1:05:11] you have faced sickness you have face
[1:05:14] death it's wonderful when we can come
[1:05:16] together in the house of God in the
[1:05:18] right motivation with the right Heart To
[1:05:21] Worship the Lord not song leader pump me
[1:05:24] up but we come with such an atmosphere
[1:05:26] the song leader don't even know what to
[1:05:28] do
[1:05:29] oh Pastor preach me right he can't do it
[1:05:33] we should come with the desire Lord feed
[1:05:35] me I want to sit at your feet give me
[1:05:38] that word I want more than an opinion I
[1:05:41] want the word of God
[1:05:45] what's our desire
[1:05:48] I like this with toes or aw toeser said
[1:05:50] he says you have exactly as much of God
[1:05:53] as you want
[1:05:59] come on let that sing you have a oh I
[1:06:02] want more of you wait a minute you have
[1:06:05] exactly as much as you want
[1:06:11] brother Branham said this and the
[1:06:14] permanent Church agent says now Jesus
[1:06:15] knew that there were going to be that
[1:06:17] there was going to be a terrible drift
[1:06:18] away from the word
[1:06:20] in the pergament church age
[1:06:23] which was as yet 200 years off from the
[1:06:27] Patmos Vision he knew that that drift
[1:06:30] would cause them to go into the Dark
[1:06:31] Ages he knew that the way man originally
[1:06:34] got away from God was by first leaving
[1:06:39] the word
[1:06:42] if you leave the word
[1:06:45] you've left God
[1:06:50] I'm still here brother Jeremy I didn't
[1:06:51] say that you were here in church I said
[1:06:53] did you leave the word
[1:06:55] well I still read the Bible every day
[1:06:56] but actually how many people read this
[1:06:58] Bible I can't really honestly look at
[1:07:00] you and say that I think the Bible's
[1:07:02] still the best-selling book there is but
[1:07:03] it's still pretty good but actually how
[1:07:05] many have left the word
[1:07:10] if you leave the word you have left God
[1:07:13] thus he is presenting himself to the
[1:07:15] church at pergamus and indeed to all or
[1:07:18] the old churches of all ages I am the
[1:07:22] word if you want deity in your midst
[1:07:26] then welcome and receive the word
[1:07:31] oh I read this Sunday and I had to put
[1:07:33] this in today because it just stirs my
[1:07:35] heart I want deity in my midst I want
[1:07:39] him in the midst of my life I want him
[1:07:42] in the midst of my marriage I want him
[1:07:44] to miss to my children I want them in
[1:07:46] the midst of my church I want them in
[1:07:48] the midst of anything he wants so I have
[1:07:50] to welcome him in my life
[1:07:53] not just doing
[1:07:56] oh how many times was Jesus welcome but
[1:07:58] he really wasn't you ever been welcomed
[1:08:00] to a place but didn't feel welcome
[1:08:03] let's not go there you automatically
[1:08:04] went to your brain to someone in the
[1:08:06] church
[1:08:10] I'll let you take care of that later
[1:08:11] brother
[1:08:14] it says if you want deity in your midst
[1:08:16] then welcome and receive the word
[1:08:19] it says don't ever let anyone or
[1:08:21] anything get between you and that word
[1:08:28] that's tough brothers and sisters but if
[1:08:31] you ain't willing to forsake all
[1:08:33] that's letting something come between
[1:08:34] you and the word and we all have a punch
[1:08:37] in our life that we're going to have to
[1:08:39] go through don't think that you've maybe
[1:08:41] been there yet I say Let's Fall In Love
[1:08:44] With Jesus so much in our life let's
[1:08:46] have such a greater desire for him that
[1:08:48] way when you do show up on a Wednesday
[1:08:50] night and it is hard and it is rough and
[1:08:52] everything's been falling apart there
[1:08:54] will be such an atmosphere in your
[1:08:57] presence
[1:08:59] no more that somebody will walk through
[1:09:01] those doors that has cursed God that has
[1:09:04] fallen away from God but there'll be
[1:09:06] such an atmosphere created in here when
[1:09:08] the word of God is preached they'll sit
[1:09:11] in their Pew and they'll accept that
[1:09:12] word
[1:09:14] why because there is an atmosphere of
[1:09:16] love in this place
[1:09:18] not love accepting the sin but love that
[1:09:21] brings a correction and a word of God
[1:09:23] that'll go and it'll cut right to the
[1:09:25] heart
[1:09:26] come on let's not let's not carry this
[1:09:28] with white gloves as a word but let's
[1:09:30] carry this bare hand and pick up that
[1:09:32] sword that word of God cut away the
[1:09:34] things of Life circumcise the heart
[1:09:37] get rid of all the baggage so we can run
[1:09:40] this race
[1:09:42] why because we need a desire for him
[1:09:45] oh my I'm not even finished with this
[1:09:47] part of this this quote it's just
[1:09:49] amazing
[1:09:51] welcome and receive it don't let never
[1:09:53] let anyone become between you and that
[1:09:55] word
[1:09:57] this which I'm giving you the word
[1:10:00] is a revelation of myself
[1:10:04] I am the word remember that
[1:10:08] but here's where I want to get to
[1:10:10] this part I wonder
[1:10:13] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[1:10:17] the word
[1:10:18] in our midst
[1:10:20] can I can I read that again I really
[1:10:23] want you to catch it I wonder Church
[1:10:26] I wonder a Life Tabernacle that's my
[1:10:28] church I wonder I read this and I asked
[1:10:31] them the question I wonder if we are
[1:10:33] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:10:36] our midst you want to know if we're not
[1:10:38] sufficiently impressed we keep seeking
[1:10:40] for other things to fill the voids we
[1:10:43] keep seeking for greater emotions or
[1:10:45] greater this or greater things of the
[1:10:46] world because we're not impressed with
[1:10:48] the word of God anymore we look at the
[1:10:50] pastor as some old Doherty man or the
[1:10:52] Evangelist that's too young of a man and
[1:10:54] we're not impressed with the word of God
[1:10:56] I say fall in love with Jesus again and
[1:10:59] let the word be the impression in your
[1:11:01] heart bring back the word bare-handed
[1:11:06] with hands that are holy because of God
[1:11:10] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:11:11] I'm not trying to be mean but I love
[1:11:13] this word
[1:11:15] and I want to love it more
[1:11:17] oh I can you love it more absolutely
[1:11:20] hey this might not be your marriage but
[1:11:23] I'm going to tell you if my wife and I
[1:11:24] have been married 20 years now right 20
[1:11:26] years and it's gotten better
[1:11:30] it gets it it's good that's the truth
[1:11:32] what is that and I think the same way
[1:11:35] with our relationship with God if you
[1:11:37] don't love him more today than you did
[1:11:39] yesterday something's wrong somewhere oh
[1:11:42] we need to fall in love with him again
[1:11:43] and you're not going to fall in love
[1:11:45] with him again by outward acts but
[1:11:46] you're going to fall in love with him by
[1:11:48] going back to his love letter what is he
[1:11:50] saying you you're here for a reason he
[1:11:52] has a purpose for you in your life and
[1:11:54] it's not to just be a Pew warmer all
[1:11:57] right
[1:12:01] all right I'm going to be carner with
[1:12:03] you and be honest with you it's very
[1:12:04] true you can live your life on Earth
[1:12:05] without him
[1:12:08] you can
[1:12:11] true story
[1:12:12] if y'all didn't hear what he said he
[1:12:13] said the reward's not good
[1:12:15] it's a true story
[1:12:16] but I want to be real with you you can
[1:12:18] if you want to
[1:12:19] and you might crucify me for this but
[1:12:21] it's going to be true if you want to
[1:12:22] walk away from this your life may become
[1:12:24] easier
[1:12:27] oh you've heard it before they've come
[1:12:28] to you all my life oh man all the
[1:12:30] oppression is gone nobody's condemning
[1:12:33] me
[1:12:35] oh oh yeah what a wonderful yeah it's
[1:12:38] just great okay wonderful okay fine
[1:12:42] Just Walk On By
[1:12:45] oh help me Lord I want to go somewhere
[1:12:47] so bad
[1:12:50] we should not congratulate sin
[1:12:55] we need to be careful with that
[1:12:58] we need to stand on the word of God
[1:13:01] love the word so much let me ask you do
[1:13:03] you love him so much that you wouldn't
[1:13:04] want someone spitting on your husband
[1:13:08] remember what our scripture was in the
[1:13:11] beginning and thy desire
[1:13:13] shall be
[1:13:14] to thy husband
[1:13:16] where's your desire tonight
[1:13:18] well a desire well your sister will
[1:13:20] desire is to my husband now it's not
[1:13:22] what I asked
[1:13:24] brothers would say oh my desires to my
[1:13:26] spouse that's not what I'm asking I
[1:13:27] believe you should have that
[1:13:29] but where's your desires at tonight
[1:13:32] you can run off you can live it up
[1:13:35] we've seen it we've got family that's
[1:13:37] done it right breaks every person's
[1:13:39] heart right
[1:13:41] but what do you see in their life
[1:13:43] brothers and sisters I'm talking about
[1:13:44] those that are sold out what do you see
[1:13:46] in their life when you see in their eyes
[1:13:48] hurt
[1:13:49] pain
[1:13:51] oh the face might be smiling but there's
[1:13:53] pain there's sorrow there's heartache
[1:13:55] there
[1:13:56] and there is also as our brother just
[1:13:59] said a reward that is not great
[1:14:03] you will never be satisfied I want you
[1:14:06] to understand that your relationship
[1:14:08] with Christ is more and I want to tie
[1:14:10] the natural and the spiritual First
[1:14:11] Corinthians 7 9 says but if they cannot
[1:14:14] contain let them marry for it is buried
[1:14:17] for it is better for them to marry than
[1:14:19] to burn
[1:14:20] listen if your marriage is built on that
[1:14:22] it's not going to last long
[1:14:25] sorry I'm trying to be real
[1:14:27] but it's truth if your marriage is built
[1:14:30] on that
[1:14:32] it's not going to work very good
[1:14:35] and that's the same way your marriage
[1:14:36] with Christ should not be built with
[1:14:39] you well I better I better go to church
[1:14:41] because if I don't I'm going to end up
[1:14:43] in hell
[1:14:44] that's not that's not a good life
[1:14:46] you know one of that you know one of the
[1:14:48] most and I'm trying to hurry I lost
[1:14:50] track of time but do you know
[1:14:52] one of the most difficult life it is to
[1:14:54] live and you probably don't know the
[1:14:55] answer so you beat me to it
[1:14:57] it's not the life of a True Believer
[1:15:01] and it's not the life of a full-on
[1:15:03] sinner
[1:15:05] than one of the most difficult lives to
[1:15:07] live is the one that's trying to do both
[1:15:09] sides
[1:15:11] it is the most difficult it creates the
[1:15:14] most difficult atmosphere in a church
[1:15:18] it creates the most difficult atmosphere
[1:15:20] in our homes
[1:15:22] is those that are trying to live Both
[1:15:25] Worlds
[1:15:27] can't do it
[1:15:29] so if you're a relationship for church
[1:15:31] is if they cannot contain let them marry
[1:15:34] for it is better to marry than burn it's
[1:15:36] not that way my desire My Desire the
[1:15:39] scripture says my desire is to my
[1:15:42] husband
[1:15:44] oh how I long for him my desire is not
[1:15:48] to my past my desire is not to the
[1:15:51] things of the world yes I have a job yes
[1:15:53] I have to go to school or yes I have to
[1:15:55] do this yes this and yes this but that's
[1:15:57] not my life
[1:15:59] boundless love unending Joy this is my
[1:16:04] life this is all I know
[1:16:08] my desire is to the word my desire is to
[1:16:11] him speak to me Lord I'm here tonight I
[1:16:14] don't care who stands behind the pulpit
[1:16:16] but let him speak the word to my life
[1:16:19] let him speak it to me if it cuts away
[1:16:22] things in my life Let It Be Lord why
[1:16:24] because I long for you
[1:16:26] come on Rebecca's remember what it was
[1:16:28] like to get off the camel and run to the
[1:16:31] tents we need some more desires like
[1:16:33] that where we're willing to run into the
[1:16:35] tent and meet our husband
[1:16:39] Psalm 73 25 whom have I in heaven but
[1:16:43] thee and there is none upon Earth that I
[1:16:46] desire
[1:16:47] beside thee
[1:16:50] Mark 12 29 and Jesus answered him the
[1:16:53] first of all commandments is hear o
[1:16:55] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:16:59] oh my and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:17:04] God with all
[1:17:07] thy heart and with all thy soul and with
[1:17:12] all thy mind
[1:17:13] so there is MIND in this
[1:17:16] the greatest battle ever fought to wear
[1:17:18] the mind
[1:17:20] and with all thy strength this is the
[1:17:24] first commandment
[1:17:26] it wasn't come to church and and show up
[1:17:29] for the pastor that's not what it's
[1:17:30] about but love it
[1:17:33] love him with all of your heart love him
[1:17:35] with all of your mind
[1:17:37] come on some of you've had some mind
[1:17:38] battles already today
[1:17:41] how many years human don't answer that
[1:17:43] because you already know you're human
[1:17:45] now answer it for me how many human
[1:17:48] I wanted to make sure y'all are still
[1:17:50] awake
[1:17:51] why are you human it's the way it is
[1:17:53] life is that way brother brand I'm typed
[1:17:55] in a couple places as this old coat
[1:18:00] one of these days
[1:18:02] we're gonna get rid of it
[1:18:05] one of these days there will be no more
[1:18:06] sorrow and pain but in the beginning God
[1:18:10] created that means that God has
[1:18:12] everything in control in the beginning
[1:18:14] God created to do what to create and
[1:18:17] bring forth a body that would love him
[1:18:20] that would worship Him in spirit and in
[1:18:22] truth they would love him with all of
[1:18:24] their mind they wouldn't care what the
[1:18:26] word did to them they would accept it
[1:18:28] with all of the heart they would fall in
[1:18:30] love with Jesus
[1:18:32] they're not falling in love with just a
[1:18:35] book They're not falling in love with
[1:18:36] just a tape but they're falling in love
[1:18:38] with the words that are coming off of
[1:18:41] that to do what to catch our attention
[1:18:43] and to pull us out of those things of
[1:18:45] the world and to draw us into his arms
[1:18:47] oh draw me Lord draw me Lord and I'll
[1:18:51] run after thee
[1:18:55] listen this is not doing
[1:18:57] this is not just doing tonight not just
[1:19:00] because you need to
[1:19:01] this is because you desire to
[1:19:05] you might have a good voice
[1:19:07] but you don't need to sing
[1:19:10] it's got to be desire
[1:19:12] it's got to be something in your heart
[1:19:16] you might crucify me for this
[1:19:18] but I would not say that brother Branham
[1:19:21] had the greatest of tunes
[1:19:24] I just that's just my
[1:19:26] Brother David
[1:19:28] I love to hear him sing
[1:19:33] I love to hear him sing the world would
[1:19:38] say well he couldn't carry a tune in a
[1:19:39] bucket but he could carry all the soul
[1:19:40] it needed
[1:19:42] because he knew what he was singing
[1:19:44] about and he meant it so it's not about
[1:19:46] getting up here and putting on a show or
[1:19:49] putting on a show for the world get it
[1:19:50] there's entertainment out there that's
[1:19:52] fine but that's not what it's about it's
[1:19:54] not about putting together a fines term
[1:19:55] and that'll get excited at church and
[1:19:58] make him feel good but it's about
[1:19:59] bringing forth love and preaching
[1:20:02] correction and preaching the word of God
[1:20:04] to do what to draw us closer to him
[1:20:09] sing it from your heart preach it from
[1:20:13] your hearts live it with your heart
[1:20:16] serve with your heart do with your heart
[1:20:20] live with your hearts let your desire be
[1:20:23] for your husband
[1:20:26] and everything else will fade away
[1:20:31] and Christ is revealed in his own word I
[1:20:34] believe we're coming to a close now
[1:20:35] God said if a man was caught in adultery
[1:20:38] or a woman take them out there and stone
[1:20:40] them to death that settled at sea
[1:20:43] if he's even caught picking up a weight
[1:20:45] of a stick on the Sabbath take him and
[1:20:48] stone him
[1:20:49] they live by it then
[1:20:51] and now see we don't have them kind of
[1:20:53] laws today but the Christian the church
[1:20:56] what I'm talking to this morning the law
[1:20:58] of God is in your heart
[1:21:02] you see you have no desire to do it
[1:21:05] you see your desire has changed God knew
[1:21:08] that it had to be more than just a law
[1:21:11] of do's and don'ts because they could
[1:21:14] not do it
[1:21:16] no matter how much God proved time and
[1:21:18] time and again I mean literally how many
[1:21:20] here has ever seen an ocean open up so
[1:21:24] you could walk on dry ground
[1:21:27] show of hands
[1:21:33] but yet
[1:21:35] you still serve him
[1:21:38] come on just bear with me for a minute
[1:21:40] they seen the waters parked they walked
[1:21:44] across dry land
[1:21:47] they shouted and did what God Said and
[1:21:50] the Bible says the walls of Jericho not
[1:21:52] only fell down
[1:21:54] but I believe it used the word flat
[1:21:57] I could be wrong there but somehow it
[1:21:59] just felt like it's always I love how
[1:22:00] the word of God is it always just adds
[1:22:02] something to punch the devil in the
[1:22:03] mouth
[1:22:05] if you ever just listen if you ever want
[1:22:07] to punch somebody in the mouth the devil
[1:22:13] is that all right okay how do you do it
[1:22:16] by the word
[1:22:20] you have no desire to do it you don't
[1:22:22] have a desire to do sin you don't have a
[1:22:24] desire to do those things it's inside
[1:22:26] here you want to keep God's law so
[1:22:29] perfect no matter what it is God if
[1:22:33] listen if God needs a doormat at the
[1:22:35] door he wants you to be the doormat
[1:22:37] you're so happy to do it oh come on
[1:22:41] brothers and sisters don't let it just
[1:22:43] be up here Let It Be In Your Heart Lord
[1:22:44] if that's what you want me to be if
[1:22:46] that's what you long for me to be I'll
[1:22:47] be the best doormat there is Hallelujah
[1:22:51] whatever God wants you to do that's what
[1:22:54] you want to do well I wish I could do
[1:22:55] this and I wish I could do no Lord what
[1:22:57] do you have for me
[1:22:59] I want to do it for you
[1:23:03] because it's God
[1:23:06] remember the song that we sing when I
[1:23:08] come into His presence I humble myself
[1:23:12] I lift up both my hands and I begin to
[1:23:15] worship remember the end of that course
[1:23:16] it says for all he's done for me but I
[1:23:19] like the end but just because he's God
[1:23:24] it ends with that maybe you don't know
[1:23:26] the song
[1:23:27] but at the end it says just because he's
[1:23:29] God if he never healed again if he never
[1:23:33] did this again if he never did this
[1:23:35] again he's already done enough
[1:23:38] he's done enough for us to fall on our
[1:23:40] knees and worship him listen worship is
[1:23:43] different every time it's it shouldn't
[1:23:45] always just be the same reaction but
[1:23:47] there's a different presence almost
[1:23:49] every service sometimes there's a quiet
[1:23:52] presence sometimes there's a shout in
[1:23:54] the house sometimes it's just a shedding
[1:23:56] of Tears sometimes it's just utter
[1:23:58] silence because you can't even speak
[1:24:03] such an anointing that comes to the
[1:24:06] place when the word of God is being
[1:24:08] preached that you're in awe that he
[1:24:10] could speak that word to you
[1:24:13] I'm going to rephrase that he could
[1:24:14] speak it to me
[1:24:17] the creator of the heavens and earth oh
[1:24:19] he doesn't want you to do and do and do
[1:24:22] and do and do until you die he wants you
[1:24:24] to live
[1:24:26] and desire him
[1:24:28] and he'll give you the strength to do
[1:24:30] what you need to do
[1:24:32] in life but let this be the number one
[1:24:35] whatever God wants you to do you're
[1:24:37] going to do it Hosea 6 6 says for I
[1:24:40] desired mercy and not sacrifice and
[1:24:42] knowledge of God more than burn
[1:24:45] offerings
[1:24:46] Cain offered his sacrifice
[1:24:49] but not his love
[1:24:52] Saul offered his opinion
[1:24:55] but I thought it would be better
[1:24:57] Esau offered his hunger
[1:25:00] but is there someone tonight that want
[1:25:02] to offer their love
[1:25:03] you see I don't love I don't want to
[1:25:05] just love him because I have to I know I
[1:25:07] probably say this many times but I
[1:25:09] believe natural types of spiritual I
[1:25:10] love my wife and I don't because I I'm
[1:25:14] wearing a ring
[1:25:15] there's something inside my heart that
[1:25:17] draws me to her
[1:25:19] and I don't not do something out there
[1:25:21] in the world because I don't want to get
[1:25:23] caught I don't do it because I don't
[1:25:25] want to hurt her
[1:25:27] come on brothers and sisters take it in
[1:25:29] the spiritual brother Matthew we don't
[1:25:31] do what we do because it's the law and I
[1:25:33] don't want to get preached at we don't
[1:25:35] do it because we don't want to hurt our
[1:25:37] loving savior that's a desire that's a
[1:25:41] Heart of Worship
[1:25:43] it's more than a song
[1:25:46] oh yes tonight you need him you need
[1:25:48] Christ
[1:25:49] for a rapture
[1:25:50] you need them
[1:25:52] but isn't it more than that to a
[1:25:54] believer
[1:25:56] I want to have more than a need tonight
[1:25:58] we're going to ask you the question many
[1:26:00] times we fight in fact we might have
[1:26:02] another Minister come up and talk about
[1:26:03] we need the Lord
[1:26:05] in fact we sing We need you Lord we need
[1:26:07] you right now
[1:26:08] there's nothing wrong with that but I
[1:26:10] wanted to just be more than a fix
[1:26:15] some of you know what I'm talking about
[1:26:18] has Church become just a fix
[1:26:20] a shot in the arm
[1:26:22] to make us feel good and to make us get
[1:26:24] to the next service
[1:26:26] or is it a full relationship see because
[1:26:29] God's not wanting to just give you a fix
[1:26:30] but the Bible says the rain falls on the
[1:26:32] just and the unjust so that means he's
[1:26:33] going to pour out his spirit in this
[1:26:35] building
[1:26:36] and whether you're a terror or whether
[1:26:37] you're wheat you're going to receive it
[1:26:39] that's why you can't base your
[1:26:41] relationship on tongues or shouting
[1:26:42] alone you can't relate some related on
[1:26:45] Deeds but it's but if you have accepted
[1:26:47] the word of God not in mind but in heart
[1:26:50] I want to love him with all of my heart
[1:26:54] with all of my mind I want to desire him
[1:26:56] when this service is over and I go to
[1:26:58] lay my head to rest tonight I want to
[1:27:00] desire God when I get up tomorrow
[1:27:02] morning let me desire him even more when
[1:27:04] I go to the job if I'm cut off and
[1:27:06] everybody Cuts me off let me desire God
[1:27:08] more I'm telling you what the more you
[1:27:10] desire God the more you'll quit Desiring
[1:27:12] to do the other things
[1:27:14] let me have more of it the more listen
[1:27:16] it's a natural it's a common thing the
[1:27:18] more you love your spouse the less you
[1:27:21] want to do other things
[1:27:23] the more you love Christ the more you
[1:27:25] love his word the less of the other
[1:27:26] things you want they don't take your
[1:27:29] life this is your life this has to be
[1:27:32] all you know
[1:27:35] let the word be our life
[1:27:40] can I ask you this question in closing
[1:27:42] musicians come
[1:27:43] brother Branham said I wonder if the
[1:27:46] word
[1:27:47] sufficiently I'm sorry let me read it
[1:27:49] correctly I wonder if we are
[1:27:50] sufficiently impressed
[1:27:52] with the word in our midst
[1:27:58] because if this impresses us this will
[1:28:01] impress us enough to not look elsewhere
[1:28:04] I don't need anything more than his word
[1:28:07] you know if I have to have his word in
[1:28:09] some little small shack I'm going to
[1:28:10] have his word there if I have to have
[1:28:13] his word over here in Timbuk2 I'm going
[1:28:14] to have his word there wherever he wants
[1:28:16] me to be I want his word to be real in
[1:28:18] my life
[1:28:21] well if Brother David would do no it's
[1:28:23] not what Brother David does
[1:28:24] well if the deacons would be no it's not
[1:28:26] about the deacons well if my spout no
[1:28:29] it's not about your spouse
[1:28:31] it's about me
[1:28:33] this is funny we're in class this week
[1:28:35] for some training and I heard something
[1:28:37] here the other day and perhaps you might
[1:28:39] have heard it before too and I might not
[1:28:40] get it correct but it was a story about
[1:28:41] two shoes
[1:28:43] and the story involved
[1:28:47] this this young boy who was on a base
[1:28:50] how many heard this before and he had to
[1:28:52] blow out in his tennis shoes well he
[1:28:54] lived on a base and when how he was
[1:28:57] raised was he was raised to never
[1:28:58] complain and to never ask for anything
[1:29:01] but just to just to take everything that
[1:29:03] they had and basically it would just
[1:29:04] wear out so one day
[1:29:07] uh his uh his shoes just blew out they
[1:29:12] were they were done and so they went to
[1:29:13] try to find him some new shoes and I
[1:29:16] believe the story goes that when they
[1:29:18] when they found when they took off his
[1:29:21] other shoe and to try to put it on his
[1:29:22] feet were were basically all crumpled up
[1:29:25] like this
[1:29:27] and so the life of the story goes on and
[1:29:29] and it goes through life and whatever it
[1:29:31] is and I'm going to kind of get down to
[1:29:32] the end to just shut it down
[1:29:34] he gets down to the very end and the the
[1:29:36] mother who was talking about it and they
[1:29:39] were going swimming one day and he took
[1:29:40] off his shoes and his his feet were
[1:29:43] perfectly straight
[1:29:45] and she's like what happened what why
[1:29:48] how how I mean how did you come to
[1:29:51] having feet that were all your toes were
[1:29:53] all crumpled into now being straight out
[1:29:57] and so it had got to the point where the
[1:29:59] basically and perhaps Sean could fix
[1:30:01] this for me later but he basically made
[1:30:03] the statement he said
[1:30:06] we had he got a custom
[1:30:08] to not asking and to not wanting to grow
[1:30:10] to not wanting change because he was
[1:30:13] afraid to this is what I got out of it
[1:30:15] he was afraid to ask afraid to change
[1:30:17] and by doing it it caused his feet to
[1:30:20] crumple up because he never changed his
[1:30:23] shoes
[1:30:24] so he lived his life in a handicapped
[1:30:28] position because he didn't want to make
[1:30:30] a change
[1:30:32] but whenever he grew up and he had the
[1:30:34] opportunity and he made the change and
[1:30:35] he put the right shoes on his feet were
[1:30:38] able to grow back his toes would be able
[1:30:39] to come back out and actually be solid
[1:30:42] and be exactly what he needed to be
[1:30:44] and I began to wonder how many and I sat
[1:30:46] there and I know they were trying to put
[1:30:47] it in for some position for our business
[1:30:49] but of course me I'm sitting there and
[1:30:51] I'm catching it spiritual and I'm like
[1:30:53] dear Lord
[1:30:54] how often we have
[1:30:56] just been afraid to ask you
[1:31:00] and we've crippled our own life because
[1:31:03] maybe we don't feel like we deserve
[1:31:04] something or or or something in our life
[1:31:07] has maybe a situation we've held on to
[1:31:09] it for so long that it's crippled our
[1:31:12] relationship we held on to that old
[1:31:15] thing
[1:31:15] and it crippled our relationship with
[1:31:18] God this is what I'm thinking it's like
[1:31:19] God don't let me hold on
[1:31:22] to the root of bitterness don't let me
[1:31:24] hold on to these things these things of
[1:31:26] the past that have caused me to have a
[1:31:28] crippled relationship
[1:31:31] you come to church but you're still
[1:31:33] wearing the old shoes
[1:31:35] I say tonight let's take off the old
[1:31:37] shoes
[1:31:39] let's take off the old pass let's take
[1:31:41] off all of those things and say God I
[1:31:43] just need a touch from you tonight
[1:31:45] I want to have a desire for you Lord and
[1:31:47] you're you are a miracle maker you are
[1:31:50] you are a miracle-working God I want it
[1:31:52] to be Lord when the word of God is
[1:31:54] preached that it Pricks my heart right
[1:31:57] where I'm sitting right now right where
[1:31:59] you're sitting right now the word is
[1:32:01] dealing with you
[1:32:03] brother David's not brother Jeremy's not
[1:32:05] brother Matthew is not
[1:32:06] brother Andrew is not
[1:32:09] all the ministers here is not ever
[1:32:10] evangelist is not but God is
[1:32:13] the word
[1:32:15] is dealing with you
[1:32:18] it's about our heads
[1:32:22] why did you come here tonight
[1:32:25] I hope that question is different now
[1:32:31] has the word impressed you
[1:32:34] not brother Jeremy I said the word not
[1:32:36] just tonight I'm talking about the word
[1:32:37] in your life
[1:32:39] are you impressed with the word of God
[1:32:41] in your midst
[1:32:43] or are we looking for other things
[1:32:47] I want you to know you know this you're
[1:32:49] a Believer tonight
[1:32:52] that he walks
[1:32:54] amongst us
[1:32:56] he's omnipresent omniscient all-powerful
[1:33:00] and he's here to do what
[1:33:04] to mend the Brokenhearted
[1:33:07] touch lies
[1:33:10] draw us closer to him tonight I don't
[1:33:12] want you to just sit where you're
[1:33:14] sitting and and get a fix
[1:33:17] but Dr Jesus is here tonight and just
[1:33:19] take this moment to say Lord
[1:33:22] I want to be impressed by your word in
[1:33:25] my midst
[1:33:27] and I want my desire to be to you are
[1:33:29] you Mrs Jesus tonight
[1:33:31] perhaps you are Mrs Jesus perhaps you
[1:33:33] said I do
[1:33:35] but you've lost track of it you became
[1:33:37] maybe for a moment just as Peter did
[1:33:40] when he got out of the boat
[1:33:42] and he got caught on his circumstance he
[1:33:44] lost sight of the one who called him out
[1:33:46] would you get your eyes back on him
[1:33:48] tonight
[1:33:49] along with my desire to be to my husband
[1:33:52] my desire is not to my job my desires
[1:33:54] not to religion
[1:33:56] I want more than religion tonight
[1:33:59] I don't want to just say I'm a message
[1:34:00] believer
[1:34:02] I don't want to just see the pillar of
[1:34:04] fire and the cloud I don't want to just
[1:34:06] see the Red Sea depart or open up I
[1:34:09] don't want to just see the Jericho walls
[1:34:11] fall but I want to make it to my
[1:34:13] Promised Land
[1:34:14] I want to take my Mountain I want to
[1:34:17] take my inheritance
[1:34:20] and I don't want to fall to idolatry of
[1:34:22] my mind
[1:34:23] oh Draw Me Lord
[1:34:25] do you know that old song will draw me
[1:34:27] maybe just play that tonight if you're
[1:34:29] here tonight well I'm just going to ask
[1:34:31] us all if you can would you mind just
[1:34:33] standing in his presence
[1:34:36] oh Draw Me Lord
[1:34:39] if I'm a young person
[1:34:41] oh Draw Me Lord
[1:34:43] if I'm a father or if I'm a mother
[1:34:45] Draw Me Lord
[1:34:47] Elder grandparent doesn't matter who we
[1:34:49] are Draw Me Lord
[1:34:51] you say well I've been in his presence
[1:34:52] what does it hurt brother Matthew I
[1:34:55] believe you like to get in his presence
[1:34:57] don't you why because we've been there
[1:35:01] listen if you've been behind the veil in
[1:35:04] the holy of holies
[1:35:06] truly
[1:35:07] you want to go back
[1:35:10] and you want it more than anything else
[1:35:13] you want to get back there tonight now
[1:35:15] some people have their carnal perception
[1:35:17] of what getting behind the veil is I'm
[1:35:20] not speaking of that tonight but I'm
[1:35:21] talking about a stripped-down presence
[1:35:23] with you and God and nothing else is in
[1:35:25] the way your girlfriend's not in the way
[1:35:27] your boyfriend's not on the way your
[1:35:28] husband's on the way your spouse is on
[1:35:30] the way your children is not in the way
[1:35:31] your job is not in the way it's you and
[1:35:34] God and the world is cut out
[1:35:36] is there anything wrong with that
[1:35:38] tonight
[1:35:39] I don't believe so

[1:53:53] presence
[1:53:54] for a moment
[1:53:58] so I could bring my friend before your
[1:54:01] throne
[1:54:03] and his daughter Lord that he loves
[1:54:11] my life is not worthy enough to ask
[1:54:17] I have no
[1:54:19] works or fruit that's
[1:54:22] worthy of your attention
[1:54:28] I have nothing I can present you Lord
[1:54:33] but the desire of my love in the heart
[1:54:36] for my brother and his family
[1:54:42] he's been a real friend to me Lord and
[1:54:49] I'm asking that
[1:54:53] the loveness and the kindness that
[1:54:56] you've
[1:54:57] shown to mankind over the years
[1:55:03] that you
[1:55:05] raised up a Ministry in our day
[1:55:09] so surrender to you that your deity
[1:55:13] could actually dwell within them
[1:55:16] so that we could see the same love the
[1:55:19] same signs and the same Wonder
[1:55:22] that we might know that you're the same
[1:55:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:55:28] and Lord I beseech that Mercy on behalf
[1:55:31] of my friend
[1:55:35] and I ask you Lord if
[1:55:39] you would administered
[1:55:42] to his daughter
[1:55:44] the healing that you purchased
[1:55:48] by your stripes on Calvary
[1:55:52] Lord she may not have the faith
[1:55:57] she may be defeated
[1:56:00] but Lord you said love was the ultimate
[1:56:03] victory

[1:56:24] evening
[1:56:25] may they have a peace
[1:56:28] that's your path is understanding
[1:56:31] Lord of joy unspeakable
[1:56:33] and may they enter into your rest
[1:56:37] knowing's all well
[1:56:40] because you will not leave them nor
[1:56:42] forsake them
[1:56:43] because your word promised it
[1:56:47] in any here this evening
[1:56:50] Lord at this time that we'd like to lift
[1:56:52] the need of a loved one
[1:56:54] before you
[1:56:57] or even Lord the battle that we have
[1:56:59] with our own flesh and our own mind
[1:57:03] but we know our heart we don't desire to
[1:57:06] be the way that we are
[1:57:09] and you said you would give us the
[1:57:12] desire of our heart
[1:57:14] not the challenge of our flesh
[1:57:18] not the weakness of our flesh
[1:57:21] but you would give us the desire of our
[1:57:23] heart
[1:57:25] Lord in our hearts always to stay in
[1:57:28] your presence
[1:57:30] always to know that you're with us
[1:57:33] always to know that you're an unchanging
[1:57:36] God

[1:58:10] the believer can gain power to have
[1:58:13] victory over this sin that so easily
[1:58:16] besets us
[1:58:19] Lord not pour my heart out that we could
[1:58:21] have the real things of life

[1:58:27] outside you bless us now as we are
