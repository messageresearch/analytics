Description:
The Christ of God
Br. Ron Peterson
September 22nd, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

catch us up bring us back to where we eternally plan to be oh our hearts hunger for the word that directs us to the condition that we can meet and be in Father for our great going we ask you to bless the people this morning Father may they receive from you what they have need of for you know what they have need of even before they asked we just ask that You' bless us this morning in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated this morning our our hearts certainly go out to uh the family that uh uh lost their uh loved one the sister I guess she had some children many many of our people have gone to be uh at the funeral and uh so we just trust they have a um the grace and comfort of the Lord's their portion I I enjoyed the the testimony this morning of sister Grace you know and I thought sitting in my office you know the pressure that uh they must have been under you know to have a car broke down and then the other car gets wrecked and you don't got nothing and you throw your hands up and you just don't know what you're GNA do but you know it's it's that pressure that molds you and makes you and uh uh so you know I just I just feel like that anyway I'd like to um brother Ron's with us this morning my friend for many years I meant back in the early 70s um I think that's over half a century ago I'm not sure brother Ron but anyway uh we've been serving the lord a long time together his wife's with us sister Sandy where you at s you stand up the Lord's really been super good to Sister Sandy we appreciate it you know uh we go back to a lot of stories but um you know one time Lesley and I we we we lived in Flagstaff with Ron and Sandy and we had a little trailer house out on Lake Mary Road and uh uh so we went to we went to at Christmas time to take the the grandkids I think we had a couple at that time to uh U see the grandparents and in that weekend that we were gone there was a great big freeze in Flagstaff and the trailer we were in all the pipes broke well um the landlord of that uh he locked us out of our trailer and uh so we had no place to go and um so we we got back late at night and we had no place to go so we called Ron and Sandy and so we said ma'am we're out here Lake Mary Road we have no place to go and they had a little one-bedroom uh house you know and so we ran over there to sleep and you know uh and I know you're all thinking that you know they just got out of their bed and gave us their bed no they let us sleep on the living room floor but we appreciated it brother we appreciated it was nice to get out of the cold and have a place to lay our heads and and we were thankful as could be that we had a friend that we could call in the middle of the night and we're just young kids you know and uh I remember we didn't have all Lesly could take out of the trailer with some diapers now in our day we didn't have Pampers we had cloth diapers you know that's what diapers were they were a piece of cloth and so Sandy let us use her wash machine and lesie put her diapers in there and washed the diapers and somehow when she opened up the wash machine all the diapers were nothing but strings of rags and and I mean we just didn't know what in the world uh we were ever going to do I mean we were just at our our wit end but you know I'm glad when you come to that time that you're at your witch end that God has got people that are praying for you amen and he's got people that are are standing there with you and and know what it's feel feels like to go through things and our messenger told us he says we go through these schools of suffering that we might know how the other person feels you know it it's really it's it's not about us it's about him and it's about how we reflect him him to other people and and that's that's the wonderful thing and and you know you just think someone just opening their house to you at your time of need you wouldn't think it' have an impact but it it had a long lasting impact because I knew he loved me and I knew I loved him and those bonds will carry you over through life so I encourage you make as many love bonds as you can with the Saints and reach out to the Saints see what you can do one for another and and and that that's what's going to hold us together because they're going to know that you are my disciples by your love one for another so let's stand this morning and I'm going to invite my friend to come Minister brother Ron pastors uh pastor's church and uh Phoenix Arizona and uh brother M Thomas daughter goes there sister Grace and uh others that we know and uh just lovely fellowship and we have all one thing in common we've all heard the cry we've heard the eagle cry and it's it's brought our hearts together so let's sing Amazing Grace as our brother comes this morning to bring the word of the Lord that's on his heart you know we have a great Storehouse and the Holy Spirit comes and moves on us and brings us to that Storehouse and we take food from it and he puts it on our heart and then and you know it's if we don't take food and just eat it for ourselves I have a saying I always try to live by it where there's any there's plenty and and and go gone to the storehouse and the Lord's put something on his heart for us this morning that you can be fed and you can walk out satisfied you can walk out knowing that he loves you and that he cares for you that he's the same yesterday today and forever and there's nothing that he can't do you believe that this morning you believe he knows what you have need of you believe he can speak to your heart that's the grace of God let's sing Amazing Grace as we emite our brother Amazing Grace oh it's a beautiful [Music] sound [Music] I I want oh I was so

again um here last time we were here this area here was just all dug up dirt there was not even a foundation for this uh this building and here now we see what was once a vision what was just put on a piece of paper has now come into a manifestation amen and here it is now we know that this is a beautiful uh Church in a lovely building and God has truly blessed all of you and our brother David for his vision but we know that the character of the church is the and the beauty is the people itself it's all of you God bless you I'm happy to be here I I thank Brother David for the invitation to go ahead and speak to you um and so uh it's Fallen our lot this morning and I want to thank him for his friendship his kindness his Christian Hospitality he and sister Lesley has caused me to gain probably three pounds since I've been here just feeding us feeding us but I appreciate that amen we came for a wedding Brother David kinkaku and sister Rebecca was joined in holy matrimony yesterday they had cowbells they had whistles and they you know they danced and all of that and they're married now so praise the Lord somebody say amen amen amen God bless you remain standing if you would turn with me into the Book of Revelation chapter 19 Revelation 19 I don't see many familiar faces here um but a few of you I recognize I see brother fro and different ones here and and brother Mack we're trying to take care of your daughter as best we we can and she's still doing okay and um everything but I remember one time just to tell you a story uh I was in Frankfurt Germany with brother Roald and there was a brother came from South Africa and so I had never met him before and so he got off the plane and God bless you God bless you brother he says yes I I knew knew you I've met you before and I've been a few places and I said no no I'm sorry brother and I my mind is going through every channel where did I meet him where did I see him oh no we met before ah I just don't think so brother and then he said yes before the foundation of the I I said you got me I said yes that is true Revelation 19 veres 9-10 and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called under the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy may God add the blessing to his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy let me just paraphrase this that if God were to send a prophetic word in this day and you have the testimony of Jesus you will see the prophetic word for this hour why you're ordained to see it you're predestinated to see it and if you're elected of God you can't help but see it thank God for that turn with me to John 1:1 give you a couple more scripture before we give you the title and the direction now I'm preaching from my laptop which I never do but I just I I am not a technically Advanced guy I just just learned cut and paste and normally have my sermons printed out I told Brother David I said do you have an electrical plugin up here in case I run out of power and this thing shuts off and he said then you know David if that happens brother Ron just out of the abundance of your okay God knows so it says here I have an hour and 50 minutes left on my battery so we'll try to get done before that Hallelujah I just feel comfortable this morning and I love him with all my heart I'm thankful you know Brother David and I go way back a long ways and we're still here amen we both found the same Barber anyway the Lord has blessed us with a good friendship ship as a brother in Christ I appreciate you Brother David God bless you richly Luke excuse me John 1: 40-41 then we'll go to Luke chapter 9 amen John 1 verse 40 one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother and he finded first his own brother and saith unto him we have found the Messiahs which is being interpreted the Christ notice we have found the Messiah being interpreted the Christ turn with me to Luke Chapter n Luke 9: 18- 21 Luke 9 verse 18 and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying who say the people that I am they answering said John the Baptist but some say Elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am now notice he's taking it from who do they say now to who do you say making it personal and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter answering said the Christ of God and he straightly charged them and commanded them that they tell no man that thing why you can't give anybody a revelation it takes God to Open the Eyes of your heart amen father God I thank you for this word I pray your blessing upon it speak to everyone this morning and receive glory and honor and all that we do and say we pray for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I'd like to title this sermon this morning the Christ of God and it's such a vast subject that really I uh feel that you could only touch the tip of the iceberg but uh there is such or so much that could be said but we'll try to bring it down to something that will hold us here for just an hour or so and then we'll come back this evening and perhaps go on just a little bit further I'd like to touch uh upon a subject this morning and going in a direction we have found the Christ for this hour I want you to all understand that all of you the very reason that you were here this morning is because there is a Common Thread that links all of us together and that is called the message of the hour that is God's doing that is not man's doing and so this that you have come into is the Christ of God now let me expound on this for just a little bit this morning now we know that there are many titles for God you see it all through the scriptures they called him God they called him Lord they called him the word they called him the Son of God they called him the firstborn from the dead the beginning of the creation of God the image of God the express image of his person they began to call him the son of man the son of David the last Adam the captain of Salvation and it goes on and on and on and so all of these many names that was given to him were there to express the mediatorial office of the Lord as a mediator he stands between God and man and revealing the father to man and expressing the true revelation of man to God so we all understand that brother Brennan preaches one of the one of the most amazing sermon they're all amazing but there are certain ones that stand out Christ The Mystery of God revealed he did not come here to reveal himself right he says I have come and I can do nothing except the father show me and they said show us the father he said have I been so long with you how many sermons do I got to preach how often do I have to say these things is it that you're not catching that I and my father are one if you've seen me you've seen the father Hallelujah I begin to think on these things and I began to look at this through the scriptures the Bible says in Luke 2:11 For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord in Acts 2:36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified if both Lord and Christ now brother Brenham says in questions and answers 1953 see no one has ever seen God but the next thing we begin to see by the eyes of Supernatural looking we now see a little white light forming out there what is it that was called To You Bible readers the logos or the anointed or the anointing it is that part of God that began to develop into something so human beings could have some kind of an idea of what it was and that was the word of God Amen he says in the sermon why and just hang on let me lay a little bit of a foundation then if God will help me I'll begin to preach he says now when he was here on Earth speaking of Jesus he said I come from God and I go to God that's right well when he died buried resurrected and ascended on high we realize that God that logos that Pillar of Fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness that was Christ that was the anointed now my subject is the Christ of God I want you to understand the word Christ is never used in the Old Testament it's only found in the New Testament now we begin to see this quickening power that God is going to use for you to understand him because our Bible is aose book God does not reveal himself except to his elect and to whom he chooses why is it that you chose to speak Parables to the people and Jesus said because unto them somebody say them he said it's not given he said but to you it's given I want you to understand that the sovereignty of the revelation of God about his word is Sovereign and he just doesn't give it to you haphazardly right God gives it to you for a reason there's a purpose so I began to ponder over this and as I've been studying for quite some time even on this Christ of God brother Brenham throughout multitudes I even studied this morning multitudes of his sermons he's talking about God being identified the identified Christ of all the ages identified with Christ and it goes on and on and on all of these about one subject and that is the identification of Christ down Through the Ages you know brother brother Brenham tells us he says God wants you to catch the revelation of the hour in which you live that you might see the word of God for what God has done in this hour now we can see Christ in the Old Testament prophets let me give you an example he says we can see Christ in David we can see him speaking under anointing he said what was that that was Christ in David are you following me we can see it in Jeremiah Ezekiel Isaiah every one of them as they began to be moved upon by an anointing right understand this anointing this thought this logos this revealing now would come upon them and they would speak as though it was them and it wasn't them it was Christ the anointing in them many times they thought that they were speaking of themselves because they spoke in first person singular understand and you can find this out in the the sermon it's one of the smallest sermons that brother BR preaches discernment of spirit and he says now notice that every time that Christ spoke through the Old Testament Christ the anointing the anointing anoints a man of God he speaks he will say hear ye my people for I the Lord will bless he's speaking in first person singular so we all understand that but let's let's fast forward it down to the 20th century into this hour and why is it that so many people when the Christ of God Came Upon This prophet and he prophesied I'll ride this Trail one more time amen they want to make it brother brandham right they want to make a return ministry as even we find in the New Testament well who do you say that I am Thou Art Jeremiah one of the Old Testament prophets where does return Ministry come from from way back that's not a new doctrine in this hour but if you understand that when God anoints a minister and he speaks under that anointing he's speaking by divine inspiration can we say Amen to that now brother Bram said the devil is not afraid of a historical God right come on you can talk about Jesus in a mang come on you can talk about the Christ child you can sing old child of Bethlehem you can worship Him of 2,000 years ago and the devil will let you he'll not bother you a bit as long as you keep him in the past but the moment that you rise Christ up out of historyall and realize do you realize that when this message came to to you it was the Christ of God coming and anointing you little did we know David that when we got a hold of those tapes and just a bunch of young kids didn't know what didn't know nothing little did we know it was life changing take us away from our families and our education and to leave California we were together I there was a tape list and somebody gave my brother and I and Mitch a tape list and so we only had a few bucks and we could only buy about 10 or 12 13 tapes and in there was a tape that caught our eye single men we saw a tape that says choosing a bride we got David and a bunch of us together we got to his house put on the tape oh man we're having a a good time cuz brother BR said you better look that heer in the eye if she got that wild staring we're just laughing cuz here's a Kentucky hillbilly pardon me but if you can receive it here's in Kentucky hillbilly taking natural spiritual he said you better look at hepher in the eye if she got that wild stare don't you never buy her she'll never be a m a mamy to her cat he said so you better watch that woman you're thinking about marrying look her in the eye she got that wild stare and we're just laughing and we're having big time of course now brother Brenham has said a few things haha and got the people but right here at the end of the tape he says something that he normally doesn't say he says I've been trying to leave the pulpit several times now he said the steering wheel is out of my hand oh Capernaum o Capernaum thou city which calleth itself the City of Angels if the mighty Works have been done in you would have been done in Sodom Sodom and Gomorrah would and you know the prophecy repent Lo Angeles why he said judgment is ready to strike and he was just going on and here we were still in California and we didn't know we didn't know we're just a bunch of young kids and we were given now this and we hear it and Brother David can testify that we were on the floor we were crying we were on our knees oh God we didn't know where will we go we're from California I was born in Los Angeles where do we go oh my we just saying oh God be merciful to us and we just start hey within weeks within weeks we're selling we're getting rid we're this and that and we're leaving California little did we know that God would take us and keep revealing himself to us how much do I believe that La is going to sink I tell you it will sink it's thus sayith the Lord somebody asked me the other day cuz they asked did Brother Brenham say anything about La sinking before Resurrection I said yes there is one quote he said I believe before the coming of the Lord yes God will sink that place now when it sinks and it happens you will not have to wait for CNN or Fox News or anybody else to get on there and tell you oh there's let me tell you you'll feel the shaking right and it won't be at that time that you say oh God oh God make me real sincere oh god I've been playing I believe this is me now excuse me but I believe saints of God you should be Shook You should be prepared you're not waiting for something you're not waiting for LA to sink you're not waiting for all of these things why because the prophetic word will begin to compound itself there'll be prophetic word after prophetic word just last just like the last few hours of Calvary but we are being caught up right now he said the bride has only one judgment that's now somebody say now now and judgment begins at the house of God that's why we come to church not to see how good but to see where we fall short and God by his grace reveals to you you need to do better you need to be more sincere and you say oh God forgive me you know what he does he allows you oh thank God it's a self judgment we're being judged now Jud judgement begins at the house of God and the final separation will be the Rapture two in the field one taken two in bed one taken we're being caught up right now my brother the word rapture is not in the New Testament you can't find it but the Bible talks about being caught up together to meet him that word caught up in Greek is harpazo that means to intercept by force that means to catch something and when you get it get a hold of it you've been caught up you've been harpazo he grabbed a hold of you all of those that are my sheep will come to me and I'm not lost one of them God is not up in heaven ringing his hands worried about you because if he started a work in you he will finish it oh we all got our faults and our failures that's true that's got nothing to do with it you are called by grace through faith and thatall is not of yourself it is a gift of God lest any man boast Hallelujah we can see Christ in Adam Eve's Redeemer takes her unto himself we know that Adam had to quickly give her seed lest God kill her so he imparted to her seed we can see Christ in Moses in the Exodus he became God to the people we can see Christ in David a rejected King over Jerusalem we can see Christ in Boaz kinsman redeemer lord of the Harvest he redeems Ruth the Gentile bride we can see Christ in Joseph son of prosperity his brothers were jealous and he was a spiritual man Now understand something that when you look at the Christ of God in all of these they are portraying a portion of God's Great Redemptive plan they're playing their part of the Great drama now for just a second when you see Joseph has he's a spiritual man he has a dream God speaks to him in dreams he said and I oh I saw all of my brothers including my father and they were all bowing and bringing their sheaves you all know the vision well him being a immature Christian thinking all of them are going to accept his Revelation and the vision that he's gotten from God and they hated him David excuse me Joseph was given a vision of his life of what's going to happen but from the time of the Betrayal thrown into the pit Piper's wife to the right hand of pharaoh is a multitude of years and from the time of the vision until the prophetic word comes to manifestation it didn't look like God's going to bring this word to pass in fact I'm sure he said oh God your vision said but this sure don't look like the vision amen now brother Brena makes an an astounding statement he said when the bride of Christ begins to recognize who she is and what she stands for and he says and by God's spirit discern and withstand the two Spirits Within in the framework of the church we're not talking about out there we're talking about within the message I'm not here to talk doctrinal things here in fact I have found out through my Infinite Wisdom that God has given me I should say limited vision is to speak on things that we agree upon more than the things we disagree upon one says he he coming on a white cloud another said he's coming on a white horse brother R said who cares as long as we agree he's coming somebody say Amen to that amen I'd rather have a right spirit and wrong Doctrine than the right Doctrine and the wrong Spirit when the bride begins to line herself up with the scriptures she finds her position you're being moved you're being moved all of you your life is a journey Abraham go seek a city whose Builder and maker is God where do I go God just move I want all of you to understand that God is still moving you okay that God's Great GPS system has been watching over you your whole life you make a wrong move recalculating you move to the wrong City recalculating you go to the wrong church recalculating I want you to understand your life may recalculate many times but the destination Remains the Same God is going to get you to your destination regardless of your failures sometimes the wrong thing is the right thing because he'll use all things to work together for the good David was a man after God's Own Heart is that right he sees basba he lust he takes basheba he commits premeditated murder wow and yet and yet watch this it was still the plan of God though David did it wrong because God will use the wrong remember the first seed that came through basheba God took that baby David cried when God took that baby baby David quit crying washed his face and everybody said oh why he said no he says per Adventure that God would have allowed that child to live but God couldn't why it was wrong and did you know nowhere within the Bible does it ever say basba is the wife of David it says and David took unto him basba who was the wife of Uriah yet God used because out of basba and she's one of those used in the New Testament of the lineage of Christ and Tamar Tamar who dresses as a harlot under deception are you kidding me let me tell you quit looking at one another with carnal eyes quit looking well he did this he's out she did this she's out let me tell you when we get over there all of us are going to be maybe surprised oh you made it oh you made it and what's even going to be funnier is they're going to look at you and go you made [Applause] it cuz it's all going to be him God will use all things even wrong things to produce good didn't say all things would be good because he said he will use even bad to produce good now let me go on brother Brenham said in the angel of the Lord he said on the platform when someone meets me he said it's not me speaking listen when you hear my voice speaking when that inspiration is on now he's giving you an example they come up they meet me he said the inspiration is on him what is what inspiration is that the Christ of God are we together on that he says I have no more control of that than you know what you're going to to say next New Year's Day I have no control of that it speaks itself it's my voice and I'm listening to myself talk just as you're listening to me talk now I hear myself what it says to the people and sometimes take a hold of their hand I'll wait there for a while and after a while I'll hear what it speaks just myself speak talking to the people it's very strange feeling and under that anointing being that my services are so close together that it's best for me not to be too much under it at a time in one service now brother Brenham told Billy Paul he said Billy he says God has called you to work with me because my brothers physical brothers who were my managers would leave me me under the anointing too long and he says if I stay under the anointing too long he said I can't come back tonight to preach or the next day so I asked Billy Paul I had a chance to travel with brother Billy and Brother Joseph and take him around Europe and introduce him to pastors and churches so I said brother Billy your daddy said that you were called to work with him tell me some of those things tell me personal testimony of you had with your daddy he said daddy said I was called but he said even until I got converted he said no Billy you can't work with me till you get converted so he gets converted and I said how could you tell daddy's been under the anointing too long now this is what he told me how many of you have seen deep goth a deep in 20th century Prophet how many of you remember I forget which film it is Billy Paul walks across the platform he was a thin young man that time and he's looking at his daddy you see him go he's looking at him very closely and then brother renom continues to preach now here this is what Billy Paul told me he says I would be watching daddy and he says daddy would get under the anointing and he'd act like a drunk man he'd raise his foot he'd look around he'd wipe his face are you the Usher sir very very good because they always the angel stood to his right so they brought the people from the right towards the angel he said I see Daddy now he's had too much he said he would come up here come up here my brother come you yes come come here I'm just transforming you into brother brandham right now you're right here and now brother brandom excuse me now is under such an anointing but he says if I come up and I touch Daddy on his right hip like this with my right hand if brother Brenham says Billy let me go he would take his hand and tell touch Billy's and Billy would leave him in the Pulpit if that he he would fall back into brother brenham's arms and Billy would hold him up he would reach around and grab his Bible and he would look to the host Pastor I'm leaving now and take thank you man [Applause] the only way they could get brother brandom away from the people is put him in the car because many people come and steal brother Billy Paul told me he said I take him to the car put him in the back seat and I would drive away and daddy would lay down on the back seat and he says I could hear his voice in the the car from the back of the car sister in the red dress stand up God just healed you of the cancer brother you you had something on your heart stand up God is healing you God is giving you and on and he keeps calling I said why brother Billy he said because the anointing was still on him and if the prophet sought in a vision if he spoke it it would come to pass do you understand God was still operating the gift outside the building Hallelujah [Applause] then he he says then Daddy he come out from underneath the anointing he start crying Billy Billy take me home I'm so tired I I don't want to preach no more take me home Billy he said take me home I want to see Mom and the kids he said I just kept driving he says pretty soon he says daddy'd wipe his eyes he said Billy did we have a good service tonight oh yes daddy we had a good service he said how many more services do we got he said three or four he said take me to the motel he said we got we got work to do now understand the anointing leaves him he cries I'm done I don't want to preach no more I want to go home I felt that way many times huh oh just just let me go home and so I'll give you another interesting one how many of you have heard of sister Rosella Ro Rosella the converted alcoholic brother Brenham as you know is under the anointing he's calling people out and he said I see a woman up there she's uh she's the dance partner to Fred stair and there's a woman right next to her that the doctors have given her up as a wall light alcoholic are those things true well anyway you know how it goes and she got converted if any of you have ever met sister Rosella as they were going home that evening in the car this is what brother renham told Brother Billy Paul and he told me personally this is not on tape this is a personal one that brother Billy Paul shared with me he said Billy he said as far as God is concerned the meetings are over they've got two or three more meetings he said as far as God is concerned the meetings are over because I got the one God sent me after do you believe that God can do that that in a whole series and thousands of people he can call one let me tell you God loves you so much and he knew right where you were at and he had an appointment with you I don't care where you were at I don't care what you were doing you might have been washing dishes but when God calls you when he begins to open your eyes of understanding you begin to catch these things and God's moving you he started moving you then he's still moving you he's going to continue to move and they were moved by the Holy Spirit you are being moved by the Holy Spirit and God is quickening you preparing you by giving you Revelation Revelation becomes manifestation some saw a man some saw God he said it depends upon your attitude he says in the sermon faith I'm going to drop down this 1956 paragraph 79 God's Will by Divine gift only thing I do is just keep yielding myself and as I get myself completely yielded to the Holy Spirit then he starts talking not me he's using my voice but it's not me it's him could it be in this day watch watch how God operates you've got something on your heart a child a husband a promise something and you're seeking God in your prayer closet you're asking God remember me speak to me during the service and God knowing and Discerning the thoughts and intents of your heart at some time causes that minister to say something and you catch it and nobody else in the whole then the whole congregation knew why that Pastor said what he said but it was for you it was private and God giving you a word oh Heavenly Father how that we ask you to open our eyes eyes of understanding and let us see the moving of the Holy Spirit and God using a vessel and even unbeknown many time to the minister of who or why he said what he said or who he was saying it to and yet under the inspiration somebody was there it was me and many times after the Serv oh brother Ron praise the Lord thank you for that word you gave me what did I give you it wasn't me right it was him Amen in First Peter chapter 1 verses 20- 21 knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit now brother Bram said that the Holy Ghost is alone Holy Ghost alone is God's Divine interpreter of his word so you're not getting Revelation from the pastor from the preachers you're getting it from God the anointing upon Man became known as the word of the Lord now let me give you an example the Bible says and the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah if you type in parentheses in your computer in your bible program the word of the lord it's used 254 times and the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah came to Ezekiel came to Isaiah so I looked it up 234 times in the Old Testament and 257 times in the New Testament the word of the Lord in Hebrew word daar means the command a commune to speak speak to declare to pronounce to give a message duar the word a message Lord Jehovah the self-existing one so the word of the Lord is a message coming from Jehovah the first time it's used is in Genesis 15 verse1 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto ABR in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is El eer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one is born in my house is mine air see now I want you to understand he is he is debating with God Abram one in my house is born heir to me you haven't given me seed God and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir who was that that was born first ishma and God had to correct Abraham because he said oh that ishmail might live he says no this shall not be thine air but he shall come forth out of thine own bowels and shall be thy ear so now I want you to understand this here as I try to wrap this up this morning this logos thought of God because in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and that logos light that came out now actually was God's thought God's thinking now brother Brenan preaches a sermon and he only preaches it one time but he uses the word multitudes of time in that sermon it's called spiritual Amnesia he said Amnesia is quite a thing it's a loss of knowing who you are or where you come from he gives reasons about it and so I want you to understand that when God deals with you by Revelation he's replacing your mind with his mind your thoughts with his thoughts and he's taking you back to where you were he's taking you back to familiar places I'm going to ask you a question have any of you ever been somewhere gone to a church been to somebody's home met somebody and all of a sudden you said I've been here before I I know this church I've seen it I know these people now we can call it Deja Vu or whatever but I want all of you to understand that you were with God in the mind of God before there was ever a foundation of this world therefore it makes you Eternal okay I'm I I'll share some of that with you this evening now let me give you another Bible example I'll probably close with this may take a 45 minutes to close but I'll I'll close with this 1 Samuel 3: 1 through 7 how many know Samuel was a prophet called to be a prophet and that child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and a word of the Lord was precious in those days and there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to watch themm and he could not see kind like a lot of the older ministers within the message without Revelation I'm just paraphrasing don't don't lock up on me I'm not I'm not preaching at anybody it's just types and a the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran to Eli and said here am I for thou CEST me he said I called not lie down again he went and laid down excuse me and the Lord called called yet again Samuel Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou D call me and he answered I called not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him God calling him even though the word wasn't revealed to him watch this God called you before the foundation of the world but we need to go beyond calling because many are called and few are chosen right so I don't want you to just bubble dance and get all EXC I'm called God has called me I want you to go onto election and what is election adoption okay the word of the Lord has not been revealed to him but when Samuel has God revealed the word to him guess what he takes his position he comes in and now God see this is the this is the Inception of a prophetic ministry here like brother Brenham okay he said my first Bible that I read was nature I saw God in nature and he went and he didn't know God how many of you know the his first talking to God he wrote him a letter how many of you know that and he says I I I handw wrote the letter and I nailed it to a tree do you think God read his letter oh yes God read his letter do you think he understood about his strange birth why my parents told me my parents were not religious people my father was moonshine he said and they're coming through the little open window there in that little Log Cabin came an amber light stood over the bed my parents not a religious people he said but God was doing something they recognize that this was a proper child now he's carrying he does brother bandam little boy remember brother BR talks about life story here he says you know I remember uh some things as a small little child couple years old hey I don't remember hardly anything before about nine years of age brother ran went all the way back a couple years my wife can re uh remember things way back in her early early me and last week is hard to recall right now so now God's calling him he's carrying water to his father's still he said there's a whirlwind in the top of the tree he says I stopped to look it caught my attention there's an attraction he said a voice spoke to me don't drink smoke or defile your body in any way for there's a work to for you to do when you get older he said why I drop the buckets I run off went to Mama jumped on her lap she said you perhaps you had a little bit of a stroke put him to bed he's hearing voices he's feeling pulled to to to to become a minister he rides a bus the lady on behind the bus said oh you realize I can tell you the day you were born do you realize there's an aura around you do you realize all oh brother R said oh stop you guys know his life story Dr royy Davis said you need to these are demons talking to you I don't want no demons talking to me oh God take this from me he's there in a little Shack he's crying oh God I don't understand my life all these things all I know is I want to I just want to serve you I don't want demons and stuff take this from me musicians if you come he said I heard footsteps and they coming into the cabin he said I've heard his voice from my you but this is the first time I saw him in physical form I am sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you the peculiarity of your birth God watching over his Prophet you think he understood everything all the time these visions and stuff and this this loud boom why no one will live under any why an explosion like that I won't even live and he's up in Sabino Canyon God what is this vision mean are you taking me home if it's so that's okay Lord you all know he said there I am he said I I I knelt down he said he got my little cowboy hat on I'm praying oh God what does this vision mean are you done is my Ministry over he said something hit my hand he says I looked up he said it was a sword now he said it looked like a a king's sord the voice said it's not a king it's the king this message how dare you just make it a Clos line religion that's a part of it how dare we just make it Creeds and dogmas it's the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the life of God it is if you please the Christ of God you don't know the god of the Bible unless you come through Christ of the Bible you understand that he says is my Ministry over no it's not this is a furtherance of your ministry furtherance of my Ministry this is now he says I'm never going to return to World evangelism amen now I said this is where I've got it all mixed up you sisters you just play something softly here we're we're going to change this service over I thought you were done with my Ministry he said no this is the third poll see in all the visions and all the prophetic word that he had this will be the third pole you'll this and that in the little house and why in there why that little house and on on this is the third pole this is the furtherance of your ministry he come down go listen to T he said I come running and jumping screaming to the top of my V my voice oh sweetheart oh MAA it's not the end of my life it's a furtherance of my Ministry and yet now brother Brenham says I he said I've mixed this ministry my whole life a prophet don't act like an evangelist and an evangelist don't act like a prophet it's where I made my he said as far as I'm concerned he said I'm coming out now as God's Prophet not going back into World evangelist so now he comes out with thus sayith the [Music] Lord and when he begins to say he said you all think it's me I'm the prophet of the hour he said the real prophet of the hour is the holy spirit this is what he's saying the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour in fact may I say this he was the prophet of every El when he said things like I'll ride this Trail one more time if you study it in the message he says I will ride this Trail she will ride this Trail and we will ride this Trail I want to ask you which one is it I will she will or we will it's all [Music] three cuz who's doing the work right now [Music] will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the coming of the Lord yeah sure uh-huh it'll be ever so simple it'll be Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers huh and each one gifted men men like Brother David what happened God God go calls him he said brother Ron I'm not interested in trying to be the world evangelist I'm just happy here with my group I said man God bless you brother I said cuz you know what that's the way I am with my church I even say hey look I'm not trying to be some internet preacher and this and that and trying to no no hey this is to my group my group only brother brandom says that many times on tape now brandom Tabernacle I'm talking to you so and yet God is using the ministry is that right how many of you have ever come to church and you've been praying and God had your your pastor get up and give you a word and he knew nothing about what you've been praying about and yet he said now let me see your hands look at that Brother David you got witnesses oh and yet Samuel was a young man he didn't know the Lord yet yet he was hearing the calling amen God help us to and understand our placing our calling you know I realize I'm not the smartest preacher I'm not the best preacher my wife don't play the piano and I don't [Music] sing I sing in the shower and in the shower I sing pretty good I do I I Can Make a Joyful Noise in fact I had a sister told me the other day oh brother Ron you you sing pretty good you you do I said really yeah oh you you ought to sing a song special sometime oh well okay what should I sing she said on the hill far away or sing Solo solo we can't hear you you know what my brother my sister I'm not here to try to impress you not here to bring some new doctrine tickle your ears try to talk you into this because you know what if I can talk you into it somebody else can talk you out of it that's right but if God has revealed to you something no man can take you out huh why because God is calling you how many can say he called me I know it how many of you can say this message is my message behold I send unto you make it personal Elijah thank you Lord let's stand together this morning I'm glad to be here with you I'm hoping I can talk David into preaching this evening and I can sit back and relax it's kind of funny we were at dinner last night he said he just out of the blue man I'm glad I'm not preaching tomorrow the fact I don't think I preach preach next Sunday I don't think I preach the next Sunday after that you know David amen don't you love the Lord amen God has watched over you from your birth he's called you he's brought you into this amen he's moving upon you by way of the Holy Spirit he's taking unbelief Carnel I ities and things in your life out and he says listen if you'll be more sincere in the time of the third pull remember the angel of the Lord said there's one thing you need be more sincere oh if he said that to him what about you and I Lord father as we have come here this morning before your people we recognize the Christ of God all down through the scriptures why cannot we recognize the Christ in us the mystery that's been hid down Through the Ages and yet now revealed for it is Christ in you the hope of glory father I thank you that you have revealed yourself to your people and you will reveal and you will continue and though we make a wrong turn God's Jeep PPS will recalculate and if you got to get a whale as we're thrown out of a ship and seem like All Is Lost and you have a private taxi to pick us up like you did Jonah spit us out not to tarus but Nineveh father God I thank thank you for your word I thank you for your people I pray that you will bless each and everyone take this little thought that we had and bless it to their hearts reveal yourself to us more and more for revelation will bring forth manifestation I thank you and I praise you I ask these things for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you I turn the service back I'll see you this [Applause] [Music] even amen you know I think one of the greatest uh probably things that you realize is that you know it's hard to understand brother Ron talked about uh Billy Paul and the film that's over 75 years ago and very few of you are here 75 years ago but yet the whole point of the matter is he's the same yesterday today and forever thank you Lord the god of the testimonies is the same God today the the when you you hear those things and your and you hear the stories of the great ministry that took place in our age it's to show you that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he has a testimony for your life he has things that he wants to do in your life he wants to be your God he wants to create and and have you have miracles in your life so I think the greatest thing that we should always remember is that we're not a people looking back to days that have gone by we're a people that are moving as God's word's been revealing we we've all been moving and what have we all been coming into we're coming into this bride that we are this image of Christ This Love Affair this
