[29:14] seeing we've sang it a couple times stay
[29:19] just a beautiful song that speaks to my
[29:22] heart
[29:23] and
[29:25] just the lyrics resonated uh with me
[29:29] when it says I know what it's like
[29:32] [Music]
[29:34] to be in the presence of the Lord and
[29:36] anybody
[29:38] I don't know what level but if you've
[29:40] ever been in his presence and you've
[29:42] recognized him in his person
[29:46] something in you just says yeah
[29:49] yeah I know what it's like
[29:52] and if you've been there
[29:55] you don't want to be anywhere else
[29:56] [Music]
[29:57] his presence has a way of
[30:00] melting your troubles and
[30:03] has a way of
[30:04] binding up the broken heart and giving
[30:06] hope
[30:07] giving peace and
[30:10] in the midst of the trial and the storm
[30:11] gives a comfort and a peace
[30:14] to know that everything's going to be
[30:16] okay
[30:17] his presence
[30:19] I think that we've received a word and a
[30:21] message
[30:22] that's come to let the bride know that
[30:24] I'm here
[30:25] I'm with you

[30:46] character that he was molding in US
[30:48] will bring that love that he was
[30:50] expressing in US
[30:52] and then we'll be on the other side of
[30:54] it all and we'll say it was worth it all

[41:56] Lord I only wish you gave us a

[42:06] could describe you
[42:08] oh one day father

[42:13] we're going to throw our crowns at our
[42:15] feet we're going to cry holy holy holy
[42:21] Lord increase us father in you
[42:24] we ask it in Jesus precious and
[42:28] wonderful name
[42:30] amen
[42:32] amen let's open our Bible so I I like it
[42:36] tonight I like preaching to small groups
[42:39] amen I like being assembled with the
[42:42] Believers
[42:43] amen don't you it's wonderful praise God
[42:47] let's turn in Genesis I'd just like to
[42:50] continue in the thought line that we've
[42:53] been in and our brother was on that this
[42:55] morning we know we've been preaching out
[42:58] a spoken word as the Original Seed and
[43:01] tying that in with the Capstone and
[43:04] we're just going to continue
[43:07] just a short service this evening we'd
[43:10] like to read it says in the beginning
[43:12] God created
[43:14] the Heaven and the Earth
[43:18] in the beginning God and then we always
[43:21] like to read along with that we we like
[43:26] to always read in Saint John also and
[43:31] the first uh
[43:32] verse of
[43:35] Saint John The Gospel of Saint John it
[43:39] says in the beginning was the word
[43:43] and the Word was with God and the Word
[43:46] was God and the same was in the
[43:49] beginning with God Amen and all things
[43:54] were made by him and without him was not
[43:58] anything made that was made
[44:02] and in him was life and the life was the
[44:06] light of men and the light shineth in
[44:09] darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth
[44:11] it not Heavenly Father we ask you to add
[44:15] your blessings to your word in Jesus
[44:18] precious name we pray amen amen God
[44:22] bless you you may be
[44:24] seated
[44:26] halleluia and uh
[44:30] um
[44:31] we just want to
[44:35] um just continue uh on that thought just
[44:39] for a little bit this evening just that
[44:42] uh to have a greater understanding I
[44:45] believe of the expectation of of the
[44:49] bride and uh we call ourselves the bride
[44:54] and we call ourselves the
[44:57] uh elect lady in other words the and we
[45:02] preach and we teach of an invisible
[45:06] Union
[45:07] between this heavenly bridegroom and
[45:11] this Earthly bride and it's so
[45:14] beautifully ties together with creation
[45:18] and so we know that God
[45:22] had to be outside of his creation
[45:26] in order to create it
[45:28] and a lot of times that's what uh you
[45:32] know there's people that believe that
[45:35] for some reason or somehow something
[45:39] bumped together up in the sky or
[45:42] something came and and caused it to
[45:46] happen but what they don't understand if
[45:49] it was created or came into existence
[45:52] there had to be something outside of it
[45:55] in order for it to come into existence
[45:59] so God had to be outside of his creation
[46:03] but yet his creation had to be in them
[46:07] so we we know that creation that that
[46:12] the world's
[46:14] were not made by hand
[46:17] they weren't fashioned so to speak you
[46:21] take something and you fashion it you
[46:24] you build that you make it you
[46:27] you do things through it you take steel
[46:30] and iron and you make uh something from
[46:33] it so those are things that are
[46:35] fashioned something that's fashion means
[46:37] that there was something that was taken
[46:40] that in one form and fashioned into
[46:44] another form that's why we call Fashions
[46:47] we call it Fashions people take clothing
[46:50] and they form it into something it's sad
[46:53] isn't it that people pay more money for
[46:56] Less
[46:57] it just shows you that uh that the the
[47:02] thinking of man is has really moved from
[47:06] anything that's real you know uh
[47:10] I I saw a pair of flip-flops for 225
[47:14] dollars
[47:15] flip-flops
[47:18] that's a flop
[47:20] for sure and it must have surely flipped
[47:23] the mental capacity of the person that
[47:27] paid for him
[47:28] so I got good name but anyway so we
[47:32] understand that so God did not create by
[47:35] hands or by fashioning he created by his
[47:38] word so he said let there be and so if
[47:43] it's so when it was created uh God uh he
[47:49] he did it by his word God in the
[47:52] beginning he created by his spoken word
[47:54] God's method of doing things is to speak
[47:58] it that's what he does that's why even
[48:01] in your faith the prophet of God taught
[48:04] us that if you ever want to accomplish
[48:06] something by faith it can't just remain
[48:09] in you as a thought because the process
[48:12] of God has got to be confessed God can
[48:15] do nothing for you until you confess it
[48:19] first until you're able to put your
[48:22] thought
[48:23] and and what's in your heart in the form
[48:27] of an expression
[48:29] and speak it out that it could be
[48:32] witnessed that God can't do nothing for
[48:34] you
[48:35] so it's got to just remember that that
[48:38] God works upon the confession of your
[48:42] faith and that's because he put a law
[48:44] the law in the beginning is what created
[48:48] that uh to be by speaking so it comes to
[48:52] pass by speaking so if we're in the
[48:55] image of his likeness then we've got to
[48:58] begin to understand we've got to do
[49:00] things the way that he's done them so
[49:02] that by faith God had faith yes he
[49:07] believed what he would speak would be
[49:10] there so much so he could eternally
[49:13] stand behind it and say that I can do
[49:16] anything but lie
[49:20] that's the one thing God can't do if
[49:22] anybody says is there one thing God
[49:24] can't do yes
[49:26] God can't lie
[49:28] he's the Fountain of all truth he's the
[49:31] Fountain of all goodness he's the
[49:33] Fountain of all mercy and that's the one
[49:36] thing he can't he can't do so he's got
[49:38] the he he he he he does it by by
[49:42] speaking it and confessing it and and
[49:47] and saying this is what will be or he
[49:50] would say Let There Be and we know that
[49:54] being the Creator which means that he is
[49:57] the beginning in the beginning God
[50:00] created so that means that God was the
[50:04] beginning of it he was the source of it
[50:07] he was the fruit of it and he's the
[50:10] source and fruit of all his word so in
[50:15] other words there's a life behind the
[50:18] word there's a person behind the word
[50:22] there there's somebody that stands
[50:25] behind his word and there's and there's
[50:28] a me meaning behind his word no word of
[50:32] God was spoken in vain no word of God
[50:36] was spoken without an intention of
[50:38] accomplishment
[50:41] that's why you don't want to come under
[50:43] the judgments of God
[50:45] and and thank God for mercy
[50:50] you know what I mean that he that he can
[50:52] forgive and that he's got those
[50:55] attributes because we as brother Tim
[50:57] said we were the benefits of those
[51:00] attributes the benefits of what that he
[51:02] done so so we understand that it's God's
[51:06] word is still being spoken
[51:10] amen
[51:12] I think you know there's still a person
[51:15] behind it there's still a person that a
[51:19] living being with all the greatness that
[51:22] we try to describe him by and it's how
[51:25] do you describe them
[51:28] you know how do you even measure his
[51:31] love
[51:32] it's it's so vast we've made God too
[51:36] little
[51:39] we've made them too weak
[51:43] we've made them too far away
[51:47] but he's not far away he's close because
[51:50] he said he would be close how close
[51:53] would he said I'll never leave you I'll
[51:55] never forsake you for that fact I'll
[51:57] even be with you and in you
[52:01] and that's what Paul said the one God
[52:04] you know one baptism One Faith one Lord
[52:07] and Savior one God above us and the one
[52:10] God within us all
[52:14] the part of God in us that's how close
[52:17] he wanted to be to us can we've just
[52:21] made him
[52:22] we've made them too little
[52:25] and we've allowed Satan to get too big
[52:29] we've given them way more credit than he
[52:32] deserves
[52:34] I like whether how the prophet of God
[52:36] described the one thing he says he's
[52:38] nothing but a big hairy alley-oop
[52:41] anybody old enough to marry out remember
[52:43] alley-oop
[52:46] there's a few alley-oopers left
[52:50] he said just a big old caveman
[52:53] you know I remember when he got those
[52:55] Faith muscles it came off that Faith
[52:58] began to grow in him and he began to
[53:00] think of the promises of God the word of
[53:03] God what God Said and he finally got up
[53:06] and he said boo and he dissolved he's
[53:09] nothing he's a bluff
[53:13] that's right
[53:15] you know they call it Poker Face I
[53:18] believe somebody that can lie to you you
[53:21] write straight to their teeth you know
[53:24] what I mean and just keep a straight
[53:25] face
[53:27] I don't like straight-faced liars
[53:32] I I don't mind a liar you can tell he's
[53:34] lying because he knows he's lying and
[53:37] you know he's lying and therefore he
[53:39] don't think it's a lie
[53:44] but I don't like those Liars
[53:46] and Satan's a liar
[53:49] and I don't think we ought to like Satan
[53:51] at all
[53:53] I got no affinity for Satan
[53:58] I like what uh they ask uh brother Billy
[54:02] Paul gave us the testimony how that they
[54:04] quit asking to ask him he says what's
[54:06] brother brosler saying up there what's
[54:08] brother brother boss was saying there he
[54:10] said brother Rob was up there saying
[54:12] poor devil
[54:13] board devil Here Comes The Devil he's
[54:15] going to be exposed poor devil you don't
[54:18] have no affinity for the devil
[54:21] well that's not what it's all about so
[54:24] we understand that God still speaking
[54:27] his word
[54:29] he's still speaking his word he's still
[54:31] bringing his word to pass he's still
[54:34] standing behind everything he says he
[54:37] still speaks
[54:38] if God was dead then he'd be quit
[54:42] speaking
[54:43] he's not done creating
[54:47] he's still moving he's still a real God
[54:50] and so when he spoke his word another so
[54:54] God's still speaking so it's not laying
[54:56] dead on paper so man can make out of it
[55:01] what they want to make out of it heard
[55:04] them all okay do you understand so he
[55:07] just didn't leave it here and say okay
[55:09] now make out of it what you make out of
[55:12] it and that's the problem people are
[55:14] taking the word making out of it what he
[55:16] made out of it but God's word is still
[55:19] the same
[55:20] it's still the same it's still the the
[55:24] very word that it's always been and as
[55:26] our brother touched on it this morning
[55:28] and because we we've been reading this
[55:30] we know that it said that every seed
[55:33] would come forth of its kind so in other
[55:37] words when we say that that God had an
[55:39] intention
[55:42] for every seed that he spoke
[55:46] and he was Lord over that seed he was
[55:49] Lord over all the things that crept on
[55:52] the earth he was Lord he's Lord of all
[55:55] things it built everything that he spoke
[55:58] had had an intention and and as we have
[56:04] been gone through and as our brother
[56:05] touched on all those things uh were part
[56:09] of the attribute of God being expressed
[56:13] so Paul summed it up this way he said
[56:17] the invisible things of God are clearly
[56:21] seen in the visible things around us in
[56:25] creation
[56:27] the first Bible was creation
[56:29] that's what he we're being admonished to
[56:32] if you don't want to think just look
[56:35] you know I mean I love architecture I do
[56:39] but some of the best buildings in the
[56:43] world to me are old buildings I like
[56:45] watching old buildings and walking down
[56:47] old Cobble Stone streets and and going
[56:51] back to the uh cities that have towns
[56:55] that are from the 16th century I love
[56:57] that my heart beats inside of me I've
[57:00] always wanted to go to China and go
[57:02] through some of the ancient things there
[57:04] and I love history and I love geography
[57:07] but let me tell you something there is
[57:09] nothing like standing on the top of the
[57:12] peaks of the Bob Marshall Wilderness and
[57:14] looking out over that creation
[57:17] you can't imagine when you just begin to
[57:20] see the life in the uh could I bend down
[57:24] those Rivers where I can see the trout
[57:26] in them and and eating the berries and
[57:29] at the wild raspberries and wild
[57:31] blueberries oh my goodness uh man can't
[57:35] touch that they'll never be able to
[57:37] touch it
[57:38] artificial never matches up
[57:42] yeah
[57:44] I went to uh
[57:46] IHOP the other day and I ordered sausage
[57:51] oh I get this stuff and I said I want
[57:54] I'd like two eggs over easy some sausage
[57:56] patties I've cut the potatoes give me
[57:59] fruit
[58:01] and I got these two things back and I
[58:03] was eating breakfast with Richard and I
[58:05] tasted that thing and I said what's this
[58:08] I I thought I was being poisoned
[58:13] and I said ma'am I'm sorry I ordered
[58:16] sausage oh she said this is plant-based
[58:20] there's no such thing as plant-based
[58:23] sausage sausage comes from pigs it don't
[58:27] come from plants
[58:30] you understand that you see what they
[58:33] did
[58:34] they didn't use the original attention
[58:36] of a pig the original tension of a pig
[58:39] is bacon you understand and the
[58:42] originals
[58:44] thing of a plant ink sausage I'm sorry
[58:48] it's just the way I feel about it leave
[58:51] things alone leave it the way God made
[58:54] it
[58:55] that's right
[58:57] don't need our help
[59:00] it can soak every seed supposed to
[59:03] to come forth of its kind
[59:07] so in other words the the the the life
[59:10] of the seed came from the Creator
[59:18] you understand the life of it came for
[59:20] the from the Creator
[59:22] and and the life of it was it and I I
[59:27] hope that you can understand this the
[59:30] life of the fruit another the life of
[59:33] the Apple the life of the Corn the life
[59:36] of the seed is not the fruit it produces
[59:41] right that's not the life of it the life
[59:44] of it is its ability to reproduce
[59:50] because that's the life of it now let me
[59:53] tell you something a lot of Christianity
[59:56] has been preached fruit fruit fruit
[59:59] fruit fruit fruit fruit
[1:00:03] and the message a lot of times is all
[1:00:07] produced fruit you won't cut your hair
[1:00:09] you'll wear dresses you'll fruit you'll
[1:00:12] pay your tithes you'll go to church
[1:00:14] fruit fruit fruit but the life of the
[1:00:18] seed is not the fruit of the seed it's
[1:00:22] the ability to reproduce itself
[1:00:27] because if that's what hybrid something
[1:00:32] is
[1:00:33] it can't reproduce itself
[1:00:37] therefore it becomes extinct
[1:00:41] now hybrid Corn's got beautiful fruit
[1:00:46] hybrid apples
[1:00:48] whatever they they can make now it has
[1:00:53] beautiful fruit but it doesn't have the
[1:00:56] ability
[1:00:58] to reproduce
[1:01:01] now we know that if it's got to come
[1:01:04] forth from its kind in the beginning
[1:01:08] so when God created it
[1:01:11] he placed it as we realized in seed form
[1:01:15] and then when that seed found it we're
[1:01:18] talking in the natural and then we'll
[1:01:20] switch to the spiritual but when that
[1:01:22] seed found its right condition
[1:01:25] and it's right timing and that by every
[1:01:28] seed and Grain and everything brought
[1:01:30] forth it brought forth as the Earth
[1:01:32] warmed up and it was planted to whatever
[1:01:36] level it comes to and it meant the
[1:01:39] conditions of that seed you know a lot
[1:01:43] of times we get frustrated in it and
[1:01:46] witnessing to somebody and and sharing
[1:01:49] the gospel with them but we got to
[1:01:51] remember we've got to wait on the
[1:01:54] conditions
[1:01:56] and that life will come into a condition
[1:01:59] and a place if that seed is there that
[1:02:03] it'll come forth
[1:02:07] alcoholism is big
[1:02:10] uh in our family my family uh if I could
[1:02:16] say that in our gene or or whatever uh
[1:02:21] we're
[1:02:23] there's a susceptibility
[1:02:27] to alcoholism my grandparents drank and
[1:02:31] and that's one thing my dad never did
[1:02:34] he didn't drink or smoke he he was
[1:02:36] around it too much and he's seen it too
[1:02:39] much and he despised it and he he saw
[1:02:41] what it did to families I had a brother
[1:02:44] that was an alcoholic and
[1:02:47] and uh and a sister that is battling the
[1:02:52] same but you know what they always say
[1:02:54] to them he says they haven't got low
[1:02:57] enough yet
[1:02:58] to give it up they haven't gotten down
[1:03:00] enough
[1:03:01] they're not broke enough they haven't
[1:03:03] suffered enough they're they're still
[1:03:05] not ready yet
[1:03:07] because they realize they're never going
[1:03:09] to quit
[1:03:12] you know my my brother didn't even think
[1:03:18] of quitting until he saw his his wife
[1:03:22] ran over in the street
[1:03:27] and he couldn't handle it
[1:03:30] he was finally broke so low but praise
[1:03:32] God it put him in the condition that now
[1:03:37] he was ready to grab a hold of it and
[1:03:39] defeat it
[1:03:42] Echo things have got to come to their
[1:03:44] condition they've got to come to their
[1:03:46] place
[1:03:48] and maybe sometimes that even if you
[1:03:50] want to overcome something or you're
[1:03:53] Desiring for something that's why
[1:03:55] patience is part of what it means it
[1:03:57] means to wait on God
[1:04:00] doesn't mean to put up with the person
[1:04:02] that's in the lane next to you
[1:04:06] or the guy going too straight you know
[1:04:09] too slow in front of you you know I I
[1:04:11] could I have the power to control
[1:04:13] traffic did you know that
[1:04:16] yes sir will you ride with me sometime I
[1:04:18] change lanes that lane will slow down
[1:04:22] and the next Lane will go faster
[1:04:24] and sure enough I can move back to the
[1:04:26] Lane in just the opposite will happen
[1:04:29] that ain't patience
[1:04:32] patience is known you've got a promise
[1:04:35] and knowing when it's time for that
[1:04:37] promise to come to pass it'll come to
[1:04:40] pass right on God's schedule right on
[1:04:43] God's time because remember the life of
[1:04:46] it is came from its creator
[1:04:52] so I don't want to produce a hybrid life
[1:04:55] I don't want to produce my own thing I
[1:04:57] don't want to do it I want it to come
[1:05:00] when he
[1:05:01] speaks it and brings it to pass because
[1:05:04] he still speaks
[1:05:07] so we we understand then that that if if
[1:05:11] it's if it's hybrid
[1:05:14] it it won't it won't produce life it
[1:05:17] won't exist so if he's the creator of
[1:05:21] that life he put the life in it
[1:05:25] is that right
[1:05:28] you know if you if you understand the
[1:05:32] the the whole
[1:05:34] understanding if you can understand the
[1:05:37] law of the seed and the law of him
[1:05:40] putting the life in it and every seed uh
[1:05:44] has every fruit in it
[1:05:48] when that apple seed that once God gave
[1:05:52] it the life now remember the life isn't
[1:05:56] the fruit I'll if I could just lay that
[1:05:58] down and you could grab me hold of it
[1:06:01] the life was given by the Creator
[1:06:05] and when he gave that tree life he gave
[1:06:09] it the ability to reproduce itself and
[1:06:12] not become extinct
[1:06:17] so it had to be able to to go and whiten
[1:06:22] it and why was it going to just keep
[1:06:25] going and reproduce in everything so it
[1:06:29] could live on
[1:06:35] that that was the life of it
[1:06:39] that it could live on that that it
[1:06:43] wasn't going to extinct that that the
[1:06:45] conditions that it would be able to live
[1:06:47] on and live on and live on and live on
[1:06:54] and not become extinct
[1:06:57] so it it had to have
[1:07:01] it it had to have uh that ability to
[1:07:05] live on
[1:07:07] and of course we know that a seed has to
[1:07:10] go into the ground
[1:07:12] that's what Jesus said unless a seed go
[1:07:15] into the ground it will not live
[1:07:20] oh there's more to these things
[1:07:23] that then that so he made it
[1:07:27] that that seed would come
[1:07:29] it would produce fruits
[1:07:32] and the fruits was the identity of it
[1:07:36] but not the life of it
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:42] the life of it was that that seed could
[1:07:45] go into the ground
[1:07:48] and then reproduce itself
[1:07:52] and that in that seed that went in the
[1:07:54] ground was the created life of the life
[1:07:59] that was given to it by the Creator
[1:08:04] which shows that that that life was
[1:08:08] outside of the creation
[1:08:11] right put in
[1:08:14] The Creation The Creator was outside of
[1:08:18] the creation and the Creator put the
[1:08:22] life in the creation that that life
[1:08:25] might continue on
[1:08:28] and then what does the seed have to do
[1:08:31] it has to go into the ground
[1:08:33] and if it doesn't go on the ground that
[1:08:36] seed doesn't what
[1:08:38] it doesn't live
[1:08:43] so a seed outside of the ground
[1:08:48] doesn't have life
[1:08:53] you make it extinct
[1:08:56] by not planning it
[1:09:02] you make it extinct
[1:09:04] you have a bag of apple seeds you don't
[1:09:06] got nothing there
[1:09:09] it's got to be planted
[1:09:13] you understand that it's got to be
[1:09:15] planted and that's what he said and I
[1:09:18] how am I gonna I've got to go under the
[1:09:20] ground I'm the seed of life I'm the seed
[1:09:23] of eternal life
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:28] it got hybrid in the beginning
[1:09:32] at its rate
[1:09:34] without creative life man would go what
[1:09:37] extinct
[1:09:41] don't think man is living on by their
[1:09:43] own great scientist
[1:09:45] and they're by education the only reason
[1:09:48] they're living on is because their
[1:09:50] spoken word that's got to be manifested
[1:09:53] you are the nuts holding this together
[1:09:56] you are the oddballs that keeps this
[1:09:59] world going
[1:10:01] leave it
[1:10:03] so there's that law
[1:10:06] it's got to go into the ground
[1:10:09] in order to live
[1:10:11] and every Apple that came in that seed
[1:10:15] every Apple that's ever in that tree
[1:10:20] is in the life of that seed
[1:10:24] that's God's power
[1:10:27] to transform
[1:10:29] oh I hope I can I have the I don't have
[1:10:33] the education but I hope I have the
[1:10:35] grace of God to just say something that
[1:10:38] this could plan in your heart
[1:10:42] it's in there
[1:10:44] so you take that little thing it's going
[1:10:47] to produce a lot of apples
[1:10:51] but it was all in the seed every fruit
[1:10:54] that ever came from that tree
[1:10:58] was in that seed
[1:11:00] and unless the continuation of planting
[1:11:05] goes on
[1:11:07] it'll die
[1:11:09] you understand that in the natural
[1:11:12] now if you understand that you
[1:11:14] understand the law of the Great
[1:11:16] Commission
[1:11:21] he did all these great works right he
[1:11:23] did all these signs and wonders
[1:11:26] and then he says ye are my Witnesses
[1:11:31] you understand if it wasn't planted it
[1:11:35] would have died right there
[1:11:39] now we knew it wasn't going to die
[1:11:41] basically we're not talking about that
[1:11:43] we're talking about the law of it so
[1:11:46] that's why he said in Mark he said
[1:11:51] he says and he said unto them go ye into
[1:11:54] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:11:57] every creature
[1:11:58] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:12:01] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:12:04] be damned and these signs shall follow
[1:12:06] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:12:09] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:12:12] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:12:15] they shall drink deadly things and it
[1:12:17] shall not hurt them it can lay hands on
[1:12:20] the sick and they shall recover
[1:12:24] okay
[1:12:29] why the explanation
[1:12:32] because that was the fruit
[1:12:35] of the seed
[1:12:38] you understand the works that I do you
[1:12:42] shall do also because the seed that he
[1:12:45] planted the word seed had to have the
[1:12:47] life
[1:12:49] but the life wasn't the fruits of it the
[1:12:52] life was going into the world and
[1:12:55] planting the seed
[1:12:57] amen right
[1:12:59] because the life of the seed is to be
[1:13:03] able to reproduce and therefore you you
[1:13:06] the Great Commission was to plant the
[1:13:09] seed in the ground
[1:13:12] right it didn't matter by by Witness
[1:13:17] right by witnessing
[1:13:20] or what we call testifying
[1:13:23] saying this is what God did for me this
[1:13:26] is what God did for me you testify what
[1:13:29] God did for me
[1:13:30] no man lights a candle
[1:13:34] and hides it under a bushel basket God
[1:13:37] didn't do something for you so you could
[1:13:39] keep it on your shelf
[1:13:41] would you like to come over to my house
[1:13:43] I'll take you in my closet and show you
[1:13:46] all the things that God's done for me
[1:13:51] it ain't like collecting
[1:13:53] where you keep it under lock and key
[1:13:57] ah
[1:14:00] it's he's still alive
[1:14:04] Dr Quick Care witness is he still speaks
[1:14:10] he spoke to my sickness he spoke to my
[1:14:13] finances he spoke to this it isn't about
[1:14:17] teaching and it's not about education
[1:14:20] and it's not about science it's about
[1:14:22] proving the life of reproduction is
[1:14:26] still alive
[1:14:30] he's still doing it
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:36] look it didn't die
[1:14:38] healing didn't die salvation didn't
[1:14:41] start casting out of devils didn't die
[1:14:44] Deliverance didn't die it's still here
[1:14:46] it's still alive it's still reproducing
[1:14:49] there's still a witness to it that that
[1:14:52] life is still here
[1:14:55] but if it's in Fruit only
[1:14:59] you don't know it's life
[1:15:03] until it reproduces
[1:15:09] it's one thing I like about a potato you
[1:15:12] leave it in a sack long enough it'll
[1:15:14] start reproducing right there
[1:15:19] it'll start growing things on it I pull
[1:15:21] the potato out there and I wonder how
[1:15:22] long it looked it looked like a bush
[1:15:27] it's got the desire
[1:15:30] to reproduce
[1:15:32] because the Creator
[1:15:35] put it there
[1:15:37] now you're going to see the identity
[1:15:41] of the true church
[1:15:47] we think the identity is the fruit
[1:15:50] um
[1:15:50] but we're to witness by whatever way by
[1:15:53] light
[1:15:55] you are the light of the world
[1:15:58] by by what you're living how you're
[1:16:01] handling what you're going through how
[1:16:03] you deal with it people can read you
[1:16:08] you know a lot of times we think that oh
[1:16:10] people can see me for what I really am
[1:16:13] and they can see all my struggles and
[1:16:17] and they can see all the fear and doubt
[1:16:19] I have in my mind no perfect love covers
[1:16:22] all fear
[1:16:25] perfect love hides the multitude of sin
[1:16:31] you always think it's your sin that he's
[1:16:34] hiding and no or you're hiding other
[1:16:37] people saying no that's God
[1:16:39] keeping your witness alive
[1:16:43] that's God putting up a shield so people
[1:16:47] you think you made a big tractory
[1:16:49] mistake you think you're walking around
[1:16:51] you feel like Doom and Gloom you know
[1:16:53] you feel like the world's coming you
[1:16:55] feel like you're packing the whole load
[1:16:57] in God's love just hides that
[1:17:01] when they look at you they see their
[1:17:03] silk guy looking at him he's still going
[1:17:07] his love hides
[1:17:09] a multitude it's like a bunker if it's
[1:17:12] like a a fortress he just takes you
[1:17:16] under his wing and and just brings you
[1:17:18] close in him and he hide all the things
[1:17:21] that people could accuse you of he hides
[1:17:24] all the things that you think you made a
[1:17:26] mistake and you get frustrated and
[1:17:29] everything he just hides it
[1:17:32] you might pull out in front of somebody
[1:17:34] and and they're going to take all that
[1:17:37] thing and all of a sudden that person
[1:17:39] says oh
[1:17:41] go ahead
[1:17:45] he makes a way
[1:17:48] he's he's just so marvelous so there's
[1:17:50] so many ways that plant the ground that
[1:17:54] they're witnessed by light by the word
[1:18:00] by works
[1:18:02] so so the life of anything
[1:18:08] is to have children
[1:18:11] spiritually speaking
[1:18:13] I know in the natural
[1:18:16] flesh because we know in the beginning
[1:18:17] that God's children would have been
[1:18:19] brought forth by word
[1:18:23] so we don't need to go into all how we
[1:18:25] dropped out of time and everything but
[1:18:28] we're still talking but the law of life
[1:18:32] still came
[1:18:36] and and that life was given by the
[1:18:40] Creator
[1:18:41] so in the Life each of us he's been
[1:18:44] giving he gave us that life and we
[1:18:47] testify to that life
[1:18:50] and then we sit back and we we strive
[1:18:56] to look at the natural natural types of
[1:18:58] spiritual right so we understand the
[1:19:01] church age we understand the pride tree
[1:19:03] right so that seed goes into the ground
[1:19:06] and now from the beginning it's striving
[1:19:10] to reproduce itself
[1:19:14] is that right it it comes up as a
[1:19:17] sapling what's he doing it hasn't
[1:19:20] reached its goal
[1:19:23] is still struggling
[1:19:25] so it we comes up through it and we know
[1:19:27] the church history of it it comes up as
[1:19:30] in the form of a a little Tweed and a
[1:19:33] little weed as it Springs forth and then
[1:19:35] it reached a place that is up like a
[1:19:38] branch or whatever it is and we call
[1:19:40] that well that's the Justified stage
[1:19:44] in other words it's justifying its
[1:19:47] existence
[1:19:52] I know we always look at it as just
[1:19:54] being washed nope
[1:19:58] it's justifying why that he put you here
[1:20:03] you're going somewhere
[1:20:06] out not you'd just lay into the ground
[1:20:09] but you're coming up right because the
[1:20:11] Creator created and then you come up and
[1:20:14] you Branch into another stage and you're
[1:20:16] looking more like what that you're
[1:20:18] supposed to be and everybody calls that
[1:20:21] and we call that sanctification
[1:20:25] he's trying to draw a parallel
[1:20:28] he's trying to get us to catch something
[1:20:31] he's speaking to us whatever level he
[1:20:33] can wherever place he can and then it
[1:20:36] comes up farther right and it grows and
[1:20:38] finally it puts forth fruit
[1:20:45] it's got goodness and kindness It's got
[1:20:48] all those things but that's not the
[1:20:51] evidence of it
[1:20:57] right right there
[1:20:59] it's not the final
[1:21:03] to show that it has life
[1:21:08] it's got to go back
[1:21:11] to the ground
[1:21:15] can never could show that you have life
[1:21:19] you've got to plant
[1:21:22] what's in your heart
[1:21:24] somewhere
[1:21:26] that will reproduce
[1:21:29] amen now he brought this whole thing up
[1:21:35] right because the first
[1:21:38] Adam was a living soul
[1:21:41] but the second Adam was a quickening
[1:21:43] spirit
[1:21:44] and what did he want to do he wanted to
[1:21:47] have Eve was supposed to be the
[1:21:51] producing Place Adam and Eve of the
[1:21:54] first
[1:21:56] word seed
[1:21:58] but that he failed
[1:22:01] but this Eve
[1:22:03] this lady she's not going to fail
[1:22:08] because he's going to have a union with
[1:22:11] her not a union of fruit
[1:22:18] he's having the union so she can produce
[1:22:21] word children
[1:22:26] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:29] that's what shows he has the life right
[1:22:34] oh you know what Satan's stopping the
[1:22:36] church from doing
[1:22:38] putting it in the ground
[1:22:43] don't want it witnessed and placed into
[1:22:45] the word world seed
[1:22:49] first of all he gets Christians that
[1:22:51] condemn everybody who's a sinner
[1:22:55] we're looking for worthy ground oh give
[1:22:58] me somebody that's Pentecostal give me
[1:23:01] somebody that wears skirts and I'm gonna
[1:23:03] sow the word
[1:23:04] they feel they already got it
[1:23:08] give me that guy that's lost as a Goose
[1:23:14] you know what I mean
[1:23:17] I like what the prophet said the other
[1:23:19] day he said you pluck uh you pluck the
[1:23:22] right eye out of him they can't see
[1:23:24] where they're going and what do they end
[1:23:26] up they end up with a beatnik
[1:23:29] in the pulpit
[1:23:33] go look now every Big Church the guy
[1:23:36] comes out in a T-shirt
[1:23:38] and blue jeans at the cooler the better
[1:23:48] someone took a picture the other day a
[1:23:50] painting of Elvis Presley and it looked
[1:23:53] like he had a duck on his head
[1:23:56] I'm telling you the things that he spoke
[1:23:58] to us are true
[1:24:00] you're saying we haven't come this far
[1:24:04] not to have children
[1:24:08] spiritually speaking
[1:24:13] because the evidence of our life
[1:24:17] is not that we've got all these good
[1:24:21] attributes and all these wonderful
[1:24:23] blessings
[1:24:27] that people can partake of
[1:24:30] and never get the life themselves
[1:24:35] but the proof
[1:24:38] of the life
[1:24:40] is not the fruit it's the ability to
[1:24:44] produce
[1:24:45] reproduce itself
[1:24:49] so he's brought this church up to the
[1:24:52] agents
[1:24:53] he's taken the messenger shown us where
[1:24:56] we come from
[1:24:59] showing us our identity
[1:25:04] the identity of a tree is its fruits
[1:25:10] so we see the statue of a perfect man
[1:25:13] is the identity that that is
[1:25:17] the tree
[1:25:19] it is the fruit it possesses these
[1:25:22] things
[1:25:23] you understand but the union of love
[1:25:27] between the Heavenly bridegroom in the
[1:25:30] Earthly bride it produces word children
[1:25:35] so it's got to follow the same pattern
[1:25:38] the life that you have yes sir
[1:25:42] has to be placed in some ground
[1:25:45] somewhere
[1:25:47] here
[1:25:51] in order for it to produce life
[1:25:55] amen now remember you didn't produce the
[1:25:58] life
[1:26:00] as bad as you are the Creator put it
[1:26:03] there
[1:26:04] and I acknowledge it all the trouble all
[1:26:08] the mental things everything that goes
[1:26:10] wrong you we had no control over it he
[1:26:14] is the creator he makes one vessel into
[1:26:17] honor and dishonor
[1:26:19] right
[1:26:23] but if it won't sow and grow
[1:26:27] it has no life
[1:26:32] you can't take a hybrid Church seed
[1:26:36] and plant it and produce original life
[1:26:43] it's got to come forth
[1:26:46] from its original source and and no
[1:26:50] wonder the whole theme of the of our
[1:26:53] messenger was back to the word
[1:26:57] to restore back the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:27:01] what was their faith the ability to take
[1:27:04] the word and go out and produce children
[1:27:07] by it Hallelujah
[1:27:13] never dawned on me at cool I had a
[1:27:16] question that's just working on my mind
[1:27:18] I walked around that slab out there and
[1:27:21] I looked at the parking lot and I looked
[1:27:23] at everything and all I could hear was I
[1:27:26] ain't building a church for a Sunday
[1:27:28] crowd
[1:27:29] Sunday morning crowd
[1:27:35] and I thought God is that what I'm doing
[1:27:38] building a church for a Sunday morning
[1:27:40] crowd
[1:27:41] then my neighbor
[1:27:44] God will talk to a donkey
[1:27:47] don't you get so self-righteous that you
[1:27:50] won't listen to somebody give you a
[1:27:51] piece of their mind they just might be
[1:27:54] telling you something you need to hear
[1:27:57] I think we're getting way too stuck up
[1:28:00] in this message
[1:28:05] until it I couldn't believe it I'm it's
[1:28:08] like all of a sudden this guy turned
[1:28:11] into an angel
[1:28:14] he took off his hat
[1:28:17] he'd grab this shovel and he leaned on
[1:28:20] his shovel and he cut he says you know
[1:28:23] and I looked over at him and Leonia says
[1:28:28] I want you to know something
[1:28:31] I say what you're not building this
[1:28:33] church
[1:28:36] for people you
[1:28:38] know
[1:28:43] who am I building this church for
[1:28:46] you know who I'm building the church for
[1:28:48] word children
[1:28:52] whose children
[1:28:53] the bride's children
[1:28:57] I don't we're not trying to gather
[1:28:59] bushel baskets of fruit
[1:29:04] all we become is the biggest fruit farm
[1:29:10] we might as well add nuts too
[1:29:15] that's not the life of us
[1:29:20] the life of us is what he's proved it by
[1:29:24] what you freely have been given
[1:29:27] freely give go into all the world preach
[1:29:31] the gospel
[1:29:33] to them that believe they shall be saved
[1:29:37] they shall be birthed
[1:29:40] they shall receive the same life that
[1:29:43] you have you'll be able to pass this
[1:29:46] life on go listen to that day of Calvary
[1:29:49] he said the church will be given the
[1:29:51] ability to impart
[1:29:54] eternal life
[1:29:59] because as he is so is she in this world
[1:30:04] what I have Peter walked up on that day
[1:30:07] and he says Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:30:11] I don't have fruit like that but what I
[1:30:14] do have I give you rise up and walk
[1:30:20] because he knew he produced the life
[1:30:26] that would produce life
[1:30:30] he had something that was shareable
[1:30:36] he had something that he could give
[1:30:40] something he believed in
[1:30:43] do you believe in
[1:30:45] what you possessed
[1:30:50] you keep investing in something that you
[1:30:53] don't know it's going to yield
[1:30:57] great businessmen come to the place that
[1:31:00] they say this isn't going to yield
[1:31:04] you cut your losses and you run
[1:31:11] anybody heard of a money pit
[1:31:16] the minute you see your appraised value
[1:31:18] and you've put more money in that then
[1:31:21] you praise value you've got a pit
[1:31:24] and every dime you put in there's lost
[1:31:29] sorry
[1:31:31] dream all you want
[1:31:34] we got a bunch of dreamers
[1:31:37] that think that they can have enough
[1:31:39] fruit
[1:31:41] to prove they have life
[1:31:45] and when they came to him they came to
[1:31:48] him with their fruits
[1:31:52] we did this we did that we did this he
[1:31:55] said I never knew you
[1:31:57] I never had a union with you you never
[1:32:00] had children
[1:32:06] you can have one child five children ten
[1:32:09] whatever you have in the natural
[1:32:13] but spiritually
[1:32:16] and I'm not chewing anybody out I'm not
[1:32:20] talking about the past
[1:32:23] I'm talking about the maturity
[1:32:26] that the church has got to come in
[1:32:32] because the in the natural
[1:32:35] foreign
[1:32:36] these two become one
[1:32:41] and now we're at the time
[1:32:43] were these two
[1:32:45] the bride that's raised up the tree
[1:32:48] that's come to maturity comes to the
[1:32:51] maturity now God comes in that great
[1:32:54] Capstone
[1:32:55] and he unites that love
[1:32:59] that caused it to come forth in the
[1:33:01] first place the love that caused that
[1:33:04] seed to go into the ground in the first
[1:33:07] place that this bride tree might come
[1:33:10] back up
[1:33:12] and and come back and come to the same
[1:33:15] place that it could identify the life
[1:33:19] that's in it
[1:33:21] by taking its seed
[1:33:24] and sowing it in the highways in the
[1:33:27] byways in the back places and seeing
[1:33:31] life come from it
[1:33:38] we're not building to compete
[1:33:42] we're not building for so we can put a a
[1:33:46] picture on the internet of our church
[1:33:49] packed out from a meeting
[1:33:54] we ought to put communion night
[1:33:56] of course that's getting pretty good now
[1:33:58] let's go to some Wednesday night or
[1:34:00] Sunday night
[1:34:03] we're not interested
[1:34:07] I want to have children
[1:34:10] spiritual speaking
[1:34:13] a lot of reasons people can't have
[1:34:14] natural children but they can still have
[1:34:17] spiritual children
[1:34:21] said life
[1:34:23] and life more abundant
[1:34:29] you know you don't choose
[1:34:31] where they plant the seed
[1:34:34] but if it's seed
[1:34:37] it'll produce life
[1:34:41] I like this statement I I don't want to
[1:34:44] get it too complicated I just want us
[1:34:47] close right here he said I'm so glad
[1:34:50] that God is mindful of us again
[1:34:53] that he can still move on the face of
[1:34:56] the condition
[1:34:58] he promised he would do it
[1:35:00] and call a little flock which would be
[1:35:04] his bride
[1:35:07] notice here again how perfect
[1:35:09] this church types
[1:35:12] this church types of these Edens
[1:35:16] God through a seed of his word and there
[1:35:20] is only one thing that can Quicken the
[1:35:23] word and that's the spirit
[1:35:26] the life
[1:35:30] do you understand there's only one thing
[1:35:32] that can Quicken a seed
[1:35:35] so we cut we know that we always say
[1:35:38] well the seeds in us the seed's in US
[1:35:40] yes
[1:35:42] we know that just like it's but it it's
[1:35:46] it's the seed is laying there
[1:35:50] but the only thing that can Quicken that
[1:35:52] seed is the life
[1:35:56] the ability to reproduce
[1:36:01] because if you bring something that's
[1:36:03] not the original life
[1:36:05] it's not going to Quicken Original Seed
[1:36:10] because it can only be quickened by
[1:36:12] original to original it can only bring
[1:36:15] forth of its kind if you're bringing
[1:36:17] forth intellect you'll produce an
[1:36:19] intellectual believer
[1:36:23] but if you're bringing life
[1:36:26] amen then you'll Quicken life
[1:36:31] if you're not bringing what you know
[1:36:35] but you're bringing what he did for you
[1:36:39] you're not bringing theology you're
[1:36:42] bringing what changed you
[1:36:44] I want to share with you what changed me
[1:36:47] I want to share with you what made me
[1:36:49] different I want to talk to you about a
[1:36:51] God that's real a God that healed me let
[1:36:54] me tell you about something I know let
[1:36:57] me tell you about something I have
[1:36:59] anybody can preach the fruits of brother
[1:37:02] branham's message
[1:37:04] I can give any man in here four books
[1:37:07] and turn him into a preacher right
[1:37:12] anybody want to be a preacher
[1:37:14] I can make women preachers
[1:37:20] nobody can produce the life but him
[1:37:25] nobody
[1:37:27] can produce the life
[1:37:29] but him
[1:37:31] it's created life
[1:37:34] from the Creator in the beginning he
[1:37:37] produced his bride to bring forth Pride
[1:37:44] and there's only one thing that can
[1:37:46] Quicken the word and that's the spirit
[1:37:49] for it's the spirit
[1:37:51] is for it is the life-giver to the word
[1:37:58] well the life in the word meets the life
[1:38:02] of the spirit it produces whatever the
[1:38:07] seed
[1:38:08] whatever the seed is
[1:38:13] now notice what happened in the Garden
[1:38:15] of Eden that was God's economy innocent
[1:38:20] that was not one uh that was one of the
[1:38:25] dispensations and he can go on about
[1:38:28] Adam and Eve and what they would have
[1:38:29] been
[1:38:30] but I want you to understand that church
[1:38:34] we've got to know where we are
[1:38:38] a good horticulturist knows when to dig
[1:38:42] the treat at the roots
[1:38:45] he knows when to prune it he knows the
[1:38:48] season
[1:38:49] that the tree is in
[1:38:53] and I I've been trying to tell you we're
[1:38:56] in the season of the Capstone
[1:38:59] we've explained the Capstone we've had
[1:39:01] teaching on the Capstone but we are now
[1:39:04] in that time
[1:39:07] where that invisible Union takes place
[1:39:11] him and his bride become one and there
[1:39:15] is a predestinated seed out there that
[1:39:19] represents the children of this Union
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:24] payment
[1:39:26] and the spirit
[1:39:28] has got to be brought to them
[1:39:34] the spirit and the bride

[1:39:45] understand your identity
[1:39:48] understand what God's made you for
[1:39:51] he didn't live for himself

[1:40:34] even a Bad Apple
[1:40:36] if it's really got life it'll reproduce
[1:40:39] itself
