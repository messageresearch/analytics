you're Lord of all that you saw this moment and Lord we can give you the glory for the preservation for the the way that you prepared for each one to be here father we just Commit This service to you we ask that you'd move us completely out of the way our prayer is that you would anoint us father for it's by your spirit that things could be done Lord that your word can be Quicken to each one man would not be able to meet the deed even if they knew it father they could maybe see and discern what the people would have need of after a natural thing but father only you can come and break the bread of life and and minister to us the way we have need of father so we just commit it to you and we'll give you the glory we ask these things in the precious name of of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you um go ahead and turn in your Bibles and take a text and we know that in doing so that we'll be profited that the word of God's going to perform that which it was sent to do in the Epistle of Peter the first epistle if you turn into uh second chapter and the ninth verse we'd read there but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen and go ahead and also turn over into 2 Corinthians uh 6 and4 we'll just read there be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for that fellowship with for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with bow or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they will be my people wherefore come out from among them from amongst them be separate sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be the father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayeth the Lord Almighty God bless you as you'd be seated we're going to fellowship with on you on a thought of separated for a cause and just as before we enter into that I know that some time ago when we were here we shared with you that uh you know they we had gone through it towards the end of the year a time where we had a bout of sickness come against us um we we genuinely sincerely didn't know how uh severe it would be in our own assessment it was possibly terminal um and so we sought the best treatment that we could I think anybody when you're when you're sick and something gets your attention you seek the best treatment that you can and uh that ended up maybe even raising more questions than what our concerns were you know the medicine and and what they were interested in they saw some growths on our lung uh I think they call them uh pulps or something like that they they asked for us to get more extensive scanning um and you know it seemed to take up a a contrast which made them even more concerned they wanted to do blood work to determine if I'm prone uh for things being cancer and you know it raised a lot of questions at the time you know as I testified uh we know what the verdict is we know what the the diagnosis is by his stripes we're healed and the the thing that you recognize is in the way of man in the way of science it's always going to raise more questions it's always going to raise more doubt and it that was there present um we did continue to do what they've asked us to do and and on the last time they they came in for a scan I think it's the third or fourth one the thing that they were concerned about was completely gone and it it's just you know we give God the glory for that because we know what could have been it could have been a diagnosis of of cancer it and it very well may have been a a foreign life that was there a demon life but God in his grace it's gone and you have a choice anytime you're you're faced in a position of that you're going to have a choice to believe God that that is a that is God's grace present in your life and there's always going to be an explanation or an understanding or something to allow you to dismiss the grace of God in your life and and explain it away but we're people of faith we don't just we we know that we have not made ourselves but he hath made us that that God is the one who's in control and our testimony of our lips is always going to be to God and to his glory you know it man you know that whatever it was they explain it away well that's gone now the the infection must have gone away but we want to thank the Lord for what he what he's done and for the for the testimony that he that he's given so the fellowship that I want to have is going to be out of God calls for total separation from unbelief and if you just hold it before you separated for a cause if we look from the in the very beginning in the Book of Genesis you know we would read in chapter one verses 1-4 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so the very principle from the very beginning that I want you to see is that by by separating by being called out there's always going to be an identification of what is true what is light and it always is going to be in conflict with something else so you have light being separated from the darkness from the very beginning and if it had not been for the separation you would have never not you would have never known what light was um it's hard for us to understand that it's just it's a basic understanding I I was with Preston one time I believe it was Preston he says in the beginning God created the darkness and then he said let there be light I said well you know what he understood that there had to be this pre-existence of the darkness it wasn't even made manifested yet because it hadn't been separated but by the declaring of the light Darkness was made known and we know that Darkness has no place with light there's got to be a separation and anytime there is a light in your life there's going to be something whether it's doubt whatever it is it's got to make itself known by contrast just be just be expecting of it because it's going to be there now now as we read you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a a holy nation A peculiar people to show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so you're the very light you're the the vehicle you're the the the way that God even in this day is still declaring let there be light is through a people who's peculiar now the the one thing that you'll notice God calls you peculiar he says you're set aside he says you're you're you're mine you're called out you're elected I've ordained you for a purpose but there's always going to be another voice that says no you're just like the rest of them there's nothing different about you there's nothing special about you um you can just do what everybody else does and get away with it no you can't that's right you can't you can't put your face out there and and act the way that everybody else acts and get away with it there's going to be a consequence for you that the world doesn't have I'll tell you one of them you can't eat the junk and the garbage of this world without getting sick they can do it they won't get sick they're buzzards matter of fact they'll just the more sharan that the more garbage they eat the more they they want it you know I want more followers I want you know whatever it is any any uh any worldly perverted lust right is quenchable all right so you take anything whether it's money popularity you're never going to be the best athlete and then when you're out of your Prime you're going to be upset right but your ego it never died I mean look around I it doesn't matter what it is if you build yourself on a on a on a sinking sand you're going to find that you've you've put something a confidence in something a trust in something that is not going to withstand the test of time and you're going to pay the consequences for having invested and having built on something that isn't going to last it's very temporal uh the last thing I we were here we're trying to express wisdom is to know the end of the matter if you could understand by Revelation the end of the matter then you would trust that God could order your footsteps to to to to avoid the consequences just after after a Godly wisdom you know Godly wisdom is the beginning of the fear of God right it's it's not a it's not a bondage it's not a fear that that the world would try to put on us you know how you're going to pay your bills or you know there's a lot of things that orchestrate man's footsteps whether it be the law of the land or just self-preservation that's done out of fear and it it may be gives them a a moderation you know don't drink and drive they they'll put the Billboards up you know if you do the crime do the time right but we're not doing that as Christians under a law of fear we're doing it after the law of an inward man right we we've understood that Christ has come he's changed our desires the passions of our lives and we're now focused with a holy light upon the things of God but while you're under the tutor if you if you have to obey the law because you you only understand the law he you haven't been born again you haven't be been regenerated then the law should give you at least an understanding of the consequences of sin and I would hope that you'd be wise enough to avoid the transgressions right because you you'll you know God's not mocked you there's there's things that you deal with and you're you know Satan will have an opportunity to come and bring things back to your remembrance and if would be better off that there were never memories to be there now I I got to tell you why Satan has an opportunity to do that and and bring a thought into your memor you've got the opportunity to punch them in the mouth too all right because it's it's greater is the grace of God than all the things that you're bringing up the only thing you're doing is serving the testify of the grace and the Deliverance of my God if you want to start bringing up my past I'm just going to start telling you about how great the Deliverance of my God God was that's right I such as one was that but now I've been changed my I I would have something to tell you the identity I have now that what I've been called out and separated from I'm now a Son of God declaring the life of God wherein before I could only share Darkness the only thing that I could ever do that I recognize even in my best efforts the fallacy of man would be something temporal I mean I might build the best host hospital and might be able to provide the best care I may even be the best Technical College and I could impart wisdom to you all this world has to offer is temporal but as a Son of God with the word of God's on your lip you can be life to others it's the greatest privilege you ever could have is to stand in this day knowing that you have God's provided place of refuge and we don't have anything new to say we simply can say what God's already mouthed in this day and it's going to call out out it's going to dress a bride and it's going to make us reflect the very image that he desires all by his word You're simply carrier of the word is a Son of God it's progyny it's it's the genos of God it it's it's the very law of God being lived out amen so in separation God is pleased by that now it's all for a cause it's all for a purpose in Ezekiel 2 226 it says her priests have violated my law and have profaned my holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the profane neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from the sabbaths and I'm profaned among them right you could go through all through the the Bible the unjust measures an Abomination to God don't call those things which are clean unclean there's got to be a separation there's got to be something that calls out and we're not called to be a lukewarm believer I would i' would rather you be hot or cold but because you're lukewarm I'll SPO you out of my mouth we don't want to be at we don't want a semblance of the world and if you take the world and the smut of the world and you bring it onto a Christian testimony you're declaring those things which are unclean to be have no difference than that which is clean if you're deceiving yourself into thinking that you can partake in the things of the world and it not be an Abomination to God and carry a testimony that is not what God's called us to in this day I thank God that this message sets us apart that this message has a Holiness standard that this message has a righteousness that comes with it that it has a you know I could try to teach you after the law the the book in I believe it's in G Galatians it talks about how the Gentiles will do things after the heart those things which were written in the the law they're they you couldn't tell them by the law what to do but they're doing it after the nature of the law I could try to tell I I was in summer school one time and and it was after my conversion I was a real young believer and I went up to this per girl and I said you know what nowaday young ladies don't even know what the word modesty means and she in all seriousness looked at me and she says what's modesty now if you caught the essence of modesty it wouldn't even be a dress code it's a nature it's a spirit it's an atmosphere and and it's not just dress it's attitude it's it's conduct it's you know Brothers sobriety you know seriousness reverent you know we we don't just make I you know I can be an awful cut up you may not even know when I'm serious sometimes or being sincere and and Lord forgive me for that but we should have a the ability for people to understand and respect when we're serious right where that can change the atmosphere and take control and I've seen God do it with just the smallest thing and he's faithful right you could just you could say one word and it and everybody knows you know what that was wrong we shouldn't do that and they're ashamed at their conduct because the atmosphere that you carry with you can still bring conviction right and so that's the spirit that you can't do that after the letter of the law you don't sit there and you educate someone into it so we want to to do things by revelation we want to do it by an outward inward heart being lived out but the law will still make you know you're not living right in the identified Masterpiece in paragraph 58 this is 64205 to think that man was made in the image of his creator and was given a wall to stand behind that was the word could never fall fell that's that the Christian hope is this his shield his armor his Rock today is stay behind the word every believer now you must never get from behind that when you do you'll open the door to the enemy when you say oh well you can do a little of this and you can do a little of that God want God wants you to separate yourself from everything that's called sin completely set aside for him and he alone he has a purpose in your life each individual and I want you to think about that each individual so if you're called out you know you know Israel was called out as a nation okay but you're called out as an individual and and I mean that very specifically even though you're part of a church body here you're a member you you have a calling as an individual that God will move on you differently than everybody else else and if you are full you compare yourselves one to another and you say well this brother or this sister does it I can do it too and I'm not saying it's bad what I'm just saying you are called out individually okay you you have to realize the Holy Spirit leading you is because your path and the way you're going is to declare forth his Glory because he has a purpose for you as an individual each individual that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place God has got something for you you're made like that I'm thankful for that I you know we're all making a different sound for his glory we can't all make the same sound for a purpose God is Sovereign in his work he even things different we different one from another now I'm going to jump down to paragraph 63 this is you know when son's a principle of God and it's Eternal it doesn't change right so when you when you can catch something and a principle of something it's you you'll start to see it everywhere right because you're an individual to God and God has a purpose for you you he made you thus you say why did he do it he's Sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way but we find out that we're all guarded by the word in heaven we look at the celestial bodies the Bible says that even one of the Stars different from the other there's Cyrus the different ones the Mars Jupiter all the different ones the different ones from the other the sun's different from the Moon and the moon from the stars and there's the angels and there's the seraphim the cherubims the angels are great angels in degrees so there's degrees and even in the new world to come the kings of the earth bring the honor into the city ain't that something there's always going to be a hierarchy there's always going to be a way that God does things and your your place is beautiful David even said I'd rather be a door man in the house of God right there's no every part is essential you know Solomon entering the glory of his Temple I I would I would have loved to been there there no procession on the face of the Earth has ever been like that I mean you talk about holy you talk about something that you know religion in their symbolisms and all these great religions around the world and all what they tried to do in Grandeur nothing was like that and I could imagine that at all Solomon in his wisdom putting everything in place he took pleasure and even the smallest part being done properly there was a there was an order to it and we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and robot carony house he's got a variety he makes one one way and another another but we serve him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind the word and that's God's way God did it the emphasis here is is out of your place you're not behind the word that's right okay you may not realize it you may think everything as well but if you're not in your place you're you're you're allowing the Devil to have an area to come in and many fall because they've taking themselves out of their position they think that they're to be something and they're not made that way so you just fortify yourself behind God's word amen now I looked up what series and does anybody know it a Harmony houses Sears and robu Harmony House maybe someone studied fashion in college I'm not sure so thanks to the internet you can actually look up what a serir Harmony House was it was a fashion or you know thing that ran they ran it from 1940 to 1968 and this is what they would say in 1940 sir introduced the Harmony House brand as an interior decorating scheme that used four basic colors and could coordinate with each other customers were encouraged to use a color wheel that was supplied in the catalog and coordinate colors harmonizing colors had long been a problem for the company for example Rose draperies and it it goes was on and it just struck me you know man has this desire for things to be in harmony you know even to the point that they'll pull people out of the place that they're supposed to be because they just don't want the rub they would rather it just be copesthetic and match right you know what iron sharpeneth iron but nobody wants to bear with their brother when they're just a little awkward you know there's people who just get invited around because they don't quite fit in Harmony House you know you just don't match you're not fortifying yourself in the word of God every part is needful you know it it and even the less the parts you deem less needful are even more needful than you think they might just help keep the right atmosphere around right amen so be mindful right it's not what it's all for his good pleasure and this is a thing that that's upon my heart we should never esteem this is God's good pleasure this is God's order this is people that God's fashioned you may not like it but are you despising a work of God are you despising something that God's taking pleasure in you know people are so fickle you know they they get so set up in their preferences and and they even you know humans are just really bad at it we we're just predisposed to determination you know we we we judge people's capabilities and their inabilities and and everything just based off our own perception but as Christians judged by the blood you know what you want to see is Christ Living out I I want to see Christ Living in my brother I want to see Christ Living in my sister I want to be in fellowship if we have if we're walking in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen we're not we're not here to uh just esteem the things of man as carnal man does things but we've been given the eyesight of God to look at ourselves as the workmanship of his image and never belittle a work of God and we're all Made In His Image that's every person on the face of this Earth every human being is made in the image of God you'd be little no man you're profaning to to do that as a Christian and I and I trust I'm you know I'm going this way for a reason I would trust that no one naming themselves as a Christian belittles anyone I mean you you you find um it shouldn't be named amongst us and if there's circles where that that where that's done shame on you you you you you may be lacking more than you realize there's going to be someone who comes up on that day and realizes they didn't have what they thought but the blood of Christ is the same price that paid for us all to think that man was made in the image of his creator and was given a wall to stand behind he could never fail that's the Christian hope it's his shield it's his armor it's his Rock today is stay behind the word every believer amen 2 Timothy 2:4 and13 so there's going to be a a things that want to keep you from being separated from being called out and one of them is to be entangled and I find that just manifested here in the scripture says no man Warth and Tangle himself with the Affairs of his this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and that's commonly quoted I I appreciate the scripture because it's talking about someone who strives for a Mastery they recognize that they have to be in their top condition because it their life depends on it right so there's a dedication there's a fervency there's a focus there's an understanding for the calling and we have to possess that as Christians in this day we have to recognize what the prize is that we're contending for and that if there's a prize to be contended for there's going to be a method in which you're ins snarled and that's an entangling right that was that creeper that I spoke about there's those things that while you're called to be separate they're going to try to take in creep in and take you one it wears it's almost like the boiling the Frog right you slowly turn up the water so what we want to understand is things in their infancy that it's a snare before it can intangle you you want to trim it back you want to separate it out and the best way way to do that is to have a hedge right you set parameters you you you you create a a you know pattern of good works you know if you're not in the house of God where are you I mean we can look back through the scripture and David got into trouble when he should have been out on the battlefield right if you want to in avoid being entangled or you find yourself being entangled you need to start looking for where you were supposed to be what is your position where are you supposed to be fortified at and move towards that right because God hasn't called us to be entangled and the way to move for towards that is to recognize that God has a position for you to be in right he's the husbandman he's the one who's going to tend to you amen now it's all for a purpose right so there's a separation there's a being a called out the separation I know I'm emphasizing it but there's something that the separation comes with okay he doesn't call us out to leave us desolate he didn't take the children out of Israel just leave them in the wilderness but with any separating with any being called out there's there's a there's a coming out and there's a going in too amen so Matthew 19: 3-6 the Pharisees came unto him tempting saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause Jesus answered and said unto them him them have you not read that which was made them from the beginning made them male and female and he said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what wherefore God has joined together let no man put aunder there's a leaving there's a cleaving yes there's no greater type that I find in the Bible than the type of man and wife and Christ in the church is the very expression of God in the very beginning with Adam and Eve there was a Eve being in Adam being taken out just to come together and that is the very thing that's happening in our day where we were taken from the sight of Christ to Calvary the very heartbeat of God the very Life of Christ is in The Believer uniting with him in this hour and we know what he wants done with the word because we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh but there's always going to be a leave there's always going to be a separation there's got to be something and there's there's you know it's a it's a shame but there's you know I I really don't want to go there but you find in this day many don't leave they don't leave their tradition they don't leave their family there's not a true your people shall be my people you know there's there's there's women who who still listen to their family instead of their husband there's there's husbands who still listen to their mom and their dad instead of tending to the needs of their wife and and giving themselves for it as Christ did the church they're more interested in their family you know it it's it's not scriptural it's not what God chose to reflect himself in you you should you should cherish what God's given you you should lay yourself down for it you know it it it's and it it shouldn't be uh something you just use and you know um cook for my family and tend to my needs and and do this but there's a giving yes right there you know there there has to be the love that Christ had has to be on display and I'm thankful you know I these things I speak of I'm def I don't you know I on my side my mom my dad you know they very rarely come over and you know they're not telling Julia how to cook and you know or how to fix the house and you know Davey likes it this way and Davey likes it that way I wouldn't find pleasure in that anyways right I wanted I I want to be ministered to by my wife the way she wants to minister I I love to see that expression right there's there's got to be a perversion there for things to be done other ways okay so um leave and cleave but as the part I wanted to focus on was the cleave right but but you got to there has to be the separation first right there's got to be the leaving there's got to be the separation before you could enter into the blessing of something you have to have the separation and that's that's ultimately what my heart's driving at is God's called us to be separate there's no doubt about it our sisters you you have long hair there's a shame that that could come with that the modesty that you dress with the fact that you're not seeking attention the way other people seek attention you're an oddball right Brothers the way you manner your conversation I remember when God got a hold of my life I didn't bag my pants and my my shirt wasn't untucked I went to school I was like you know what I'm tucking in my shirt I'm I'm going to buckle up my belt I want to people to see that something was different I I I wanted to show forth the Holiness God had apprehended my life I've Been Changed did I praise God there if it's there's a separation that comes because God separat Ates God does the work I'm not talking about a manufactured separation I'm just telling you that if there's not a separation there needs to be a separation that God is a separator and he did it in the very beginning let there be life and the holy spirit's here to open your eyes it might cause a little bit of conviction but my desire is that the Holy Spirit would begin to move the light would start to come on and say you know what there's not the separation there there should be there's worldliness it there shouldn't be any worldliness it should be holy holy holy holy under the Lord God we've entered into the holiest of holies we're not in the outer chamber you know that's what the separation was you know there was the there was there was the there was the sacrifices there's the pertinence there there was things that couldn't enter into the holy of holies there was a separation and we've been invited into the holiest of holies we don't want an outer Court we don't want just an inner Court I believe the message it's true wow look at them seals they've been opened can you believe that we don't believe in any eternal hell that's kind of neat I guess you just fizzle out and you know that's cool that's a really neat truth you know and um water baptism I could School everybody on that one that's easy you know name of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean kabanda um you know the only ones I kind of have a problem with that you know they're a little harder as those Jesus only UPC people you know the charismatics are kind of interested no there's a there's a Holiness it's just born out because we have a word that's dressing a bride it's making her different it's changed her conduct I'm thankful for it it's spiritual food in due Seas season amen second Peter 1111 For unto us an entrance has been ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth present truth right there where are you supposed to be established at present truth we're we're not looking at a gospel gone by but there was a present truth in our day that we're to be established in it is a Malachi 4:5 it is a Revelations 10:7 it is that God sent a prophet I I love to tell people God sent a prophet I'm not ashamed of it I'm not ashamed of the picture that's not an to me that's the pillar of fire vindicating God's chosen vessel to bring a message anything could be made an idol I get that but that's we were you know in the way they call idolatry right and the way they call heresy I mean I understand there's a reproach but it's the truth God did it it was the work of his hands he chose to have the photo taken his prophet chose to publish it he chose to say the cloud he chose to say turn it this way I don't care how many people come beside it and say it was for something else it accomplished what God sent it to accomplish he's done it am and it's going to produce exactly what he wants it to produce amen as I mentioned Revelations 10:7 but I love to read it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets amen I just want to read this it's in spiritual food and due season but now God has promised us at these last days in Malachi 4 said that Jesus Christ would come and impersonate himself in human flesh like he dead Sodom that's right and he said the world would be in a Sodom condition pardon me and said it was then the son of man would be revealed in this day see the man that come down in the form of this man come down in the form of a man which was Elohim by Abraham before this promised son came look what it was Abraham said it was God the Bible said it was three men came to him dust on their clothes travel sit down and eat like man it's hard for us to understand the humanity of that moment and that being God in flesh dust on his clothes I I didn't quite understand the contrast of that till I went to Israel and speaking with the rabbi the there is nothing that equates the ability for God and man to even be in the same place like it you just don't understand God and man in the same place that's like saying we could stand on the sun right right like they get holy they get God they get Elohim they get the Creator and your man what is man that God is mindful of him you know if God's going to do anything with man it'll de be through some distant thing but and God will use you know nature and the wind and the way like he'll meet you in his nature but God and man to dwell together it's not a concept that even Judaism I think has right but then unto us unto a gentile people what is the mystery of Jesus Christ that God and man would be reconciled you know the gospel is still simple that's right it's still simple that you a sinner that God Almighty could come to sinful flesh and His Holy Spirit by the price of Calvary can touch your life and he so loved us that he declared it in his son that he was willing to Bear the shame that he would be born in a manger that he would be tempted in all manner as we were that he would suffer that he would learn obedience by the things which he suffered and I we think that uh that seems so wonderful but it was for our sake yes it was so that we couldn't have a kinsman redeemer it was so that he could be touched by The Fellowship of our infirmities did you know even in your suffering even in your suffering if you think about it on your worst day and the and I mean that in agonizing pain if you just catch that he knows what that feels like and you think about that oh my Lord you know what this is like I I had that happen and it it it was a Solace that you can't under explain that Lord you mean you know what this feels like that even in this as distracting as it is you can connect with me what can separate you from the love of God nothing so for the purpose amen Matthew 5:11 says blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake it is right here's a suffering here's a persecution but it's for his sake what's the purpose in it for his glory you may not realize it but he takes a how do you say it a pleasure in it right it's for his sake it's for his good pleasure it's for his glory it's to be separated it's to be called out brother brandom says this I don't know where I just have it jotted down I shared the quote a while ago with the brothers it's better to be ready I'd rather be a sick man ready with the Lord than to be a Wellman not ready to go with the Lord but however it'll be God so willing that he that we both well and ready soul and body for forgives us our iniquities and heals of heals us of our diseases he died for a compound purpose but the things that we esteem the thing that struck me in this is what the purpose in a lot of things are is for the perfecting of our character to make us ready to that we can inherit a glory to be shared with him and that that is what we desire the train of our faith is more precious than gold it's not that we want to have I what the world thinks is a a successful Christian Life is prosperity but if God so chooses that you may look at me and reproach me or think that I'm going through something and wow the favor of God is just is has left him but maybe God is preparing my character maybe he's making we don't we shouldn't think those things we know enough in the scripture to know what God was doing with job that we don't assess the blessings of God as as some carnal things but what what is most precious and more precious than gold is the character and the content that we have that God's instilling in us and it's better to dwell in the house of mourning than in a house of Mirth right so the things that we want to be mindful of is that we're not just seeking after fraility but we we're we're conducting ourselves in a manner that is in the position behind God's word where we're being perfected amen yes now in the separating I I you know to be honest I probably didn't flow as through this in the way I thought I would but I want to take a look back at even Joseph when he was separated out from his Brethren because he was spiritual he was persecuted there was a separation you know he's if you look at even the story it was traumatic he's thrown into prison but then there's there all of those things in him coming from that place was for one purpose we see it in Genesis 19 and 20 50 19 and 20 and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place am I in the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it was this day to save much people alive your separation is the very salvation to other people and if you lose that resonance if you lose that God can't bless you until you're separated and neither can you be a voice of Salvation if you're not called and set apart if you're if you if you conduct yourself in such a way that you just fit in with even your nominal friends or your worldly friends and they don't see a separation then you are you are the opposite of this scripture you might as well say for this Clause I've been set to be a stumbling block before you so that on Judgment Day you can say why didn't you tell me why did you let me go in the way of folly why didn't you tell me this was wrong you knew you knew I didn't even you you know when I said modesty there's people who don't even know that it's wrong they don't this world's so Godless so Godless you're the very you're the very Life of Christ the light of God but if the salts loost lost its Sabor what good is it for you know we you know I I just could to be faithful to say it you know if you want to be a witness to your family show them what means most to you okay and you are your actions speak louder than your words you are showing what so let me put it this way if you want your family to be saved right you get them into God's provided place and you don't do that being outside of it and if you're not in God's provided place then it will be the destruction of your family Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them that are the called according to his purpose amen so it's it's going to be working to the good I want you know I I want you to understand that the blessings of God for the children of God are because he has called us out and if you can recognize that in this day God through a seventh age messenger has called out a people from gross denominationalism from the understanding that we in look denominationalism is not a we're in the message we are not subject to denominationalism okay denominationalism is when people start getting in a comfort zone right we're good and you as an individual God's calling for separation yes because it's a principle it's something that has to be happening and it it's just a growth we're filling the pull you the pressure The Strain yes sir you may think that it's an election year strain you may think it's economic you may but it's you as the bride coming into the position of reflecting Christ himself that's the separating that's the pull that's the place of blessing and it's it's if you just don't understand what the travel is and what the separating is then you'll miss out on understanding that it's for a purpose just as a man Cleaves to his wife and it's the greatest blessing in the world it wasn't that he lost his family nobody assesses their marriage like look what I lost and if they do something wrong thank you Matthew said something would be dreadfully wrong right so love Christ with all your heart yes sir be willing to separate yourself from all the things that he wants to separate you from from your unbelief mostly from your own unbelief from doubting you are who God's called you to be from doubting that you are a son and daughter of God that's called out to be peculiar to be holy to be set aside to be used of him the reason we don't set ourselves aside is because we don't understand that you may be the very vehicle that God uses to save somebody you know I want to say this it's despite our righteousness it's despite our understanding of worthiness it's his election okay and you would have a lot greater confidence to allow yourself to be used by him if you just understood that you were called out and separated for a purpose okay so for your own conscience sake get rid of those things but I would say despite it God can still use you if you're just a penny God can use you I thought I was going to maybe open the this this message and read some things and and and walk through it but God had his way and led things but I did want to to read at least what and be faithful to read a lot of times I leave and I feel like I didn't deliver what was on my heart so I'm going to be faithful I'm not going to worry about the time you can fall asleep you can leave I'm going to enjoy this all these Believers we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in God's hands you'll pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollars all in coins now that's what the world is in God's hand now the world I want you to catch this picture he paints there's some people that just have to have a Penny's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way okay don't despise the pennies don't call yourself a penny I believe you're more than that that's all they can buy you may be in the place of a penny but I believe God's going to multiply you and God can only use them as a penny in a in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes lot was a penny Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make an Abraham and so it'll take a hundred carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through him Hallelujah where the word can flow through you that's you you have the ability to impart eternal life every single one of you has the ability to impart eternal life this is the greatest pyramid scheme ever this is the greatest motivation speech that I can give you you have the ability to impart eternal life Wow Wow eternal life I was a I was doomed to failure I was doomed all I could do was impart misery and heartache I could just be a wreck a walking wreck if I came in your life uhoh you know I mean I was probably going to break something and I wouldn't have told you you know I you know even in my best in intentions I could think that I was your friend and you know I'd probably end up hurting your feelings right but you have the ability to impart eternal life by being a carrier of the word by being able to have the word of God flow through you by being able to say you know in its time in its season being be able to have that word and it could be a small word you know I remember telling a person one time I I said hey can't you turn off your stereo I feel like a punk for being in your car telling you to turn off your stereo he says well oh you don't like this I've got this you know now the days you just look anything up in you but you know we had CDs all right so he breaks out his box of you know bag book of CDs he says pick something out we'll play it I said well you probably don't have what I would listen to in there I I kind of listen to church music he says oh I got some gospel in there he flips over to section he like put some gos I said actually you know I think if it's all right I'll pass on that and uh so it got quiet got real real quiet in that car this is I was a I think 19 20 years old had just taken a job and I was I was praying in the backseat I was like Lord forgive me I I should have known better than to put myself in this situation please give me the words I don't want to be in this atmosphere I don't want to be here and uh I believe his name was Brian and then I said and can you guys maybe not smoke then it was a really quiet trip to that Jack in the Box but that caused such a conviction in his life it changed him on a path that he was going on and he became a really good Christian became a Baptist Sunday school teacher hold a standard you don't know what difference it can make in someone's life even if they're Penny it's all right that God can use them yeah you know we we don't know what it's going to be like over there now I really enjoyed the thought of the penny but many people look at gifts in closing he says and try to impersonate gifts you can't do that you can't make a penny be a dollar you can't make a dime see you can't make a nickel it's a penny but if you just recognize yourself a penny and go with the rest of the change see God can use you you might not be able to do all there wasn't everybody when God called Israel out of Egypt every one of them didn't have to do the same thing Moses did but they believed it that's right they believed Moses because they knowed that it was a sign of the hour and that God had proved that he had his word you know there's there's an admonishment here that you have to understand we're so accustomed to seeing the supernatural we're we're P we we're accustomed to seeing very powerful Ministries I'm thankful for them God uses them but in God's economy we all can't do the same thing you know I there's been might Mighty things done behind the pulpit in a on the platform but I'll say there's greater that are done out and people don't even know about them okay so just because your position isn't up here doesn't mean that God isn't Desiring to declare forth his glory in your life where you're at as an individual you know as a young man and I say this to you just to understand I 19 20 years old I was in Arizona I was going down a road I believe it was thornbrier Tangerine I'll always remember thornbrier and tangerine I'm driving that the re or something but I see an ambulance go flying in the air and I I can't tell why I just see it Go airborne and like and and kind of disappear and I pull up on it and a and a gravel truck had te an ambulance it it's and what I saw was the back of the ambulance the Box flying up in the air and it had actually laid out all three s on the ground flat so the sides were flat the roof was flat and it was the exposed frame that was an ambulance that was a diesel and uh when we ran up on it you know I believe I was also calling 911 the truck two people were coming back from the truck truck driver another guy the guy says he's you know he's dead there's two ambulance drivers um and the the person in the passenger seat was the side of the impact and the the truck was on pretty much on top of him his legs were underneath the the glove box and um and he had no pulse he was dead he wasn't breathing and in that moment there's the voice that says he's dead dead but son said you've received a message in this day that God raises the dead and I got up there and I prayed and that man came back to life he went I'll never forget that I don't tell that testimony much I I don't very often but if this was going to be the last time I preached I'd want you to know God raises the dead it wasn't a fantastic show there was a voice there that said oh he was never dead he just came too but that man was dead and I saw the life come back in him and I saw him grasp and he was more coherent than the driver and that time after time I could tell you the supernatural but that's your God he's the god of your life and I believe each one of you could share testimonies and things that God's done and I say that because and I share that because that wasn't in the Pulpit that wasn't on the platform that wasn't in a prayer line but you know what he was doing to me telling me he's my God that he answers my prayers and that's your God and he'll vindicate himself to be real to you if the musicians would come if you have a desire in your heart that God would be real to you in your life know with brother brandom he took him and he walked through the woods with him turned them back young again I believe that's the hour we're living in is we're going to have a walk with the Lord it may not be in the woods it may just be another day where you're driving to work it could be you're on the job but there's going to be a voice that says come walk with me and it's going to call you away and in your life and in your heart are you walking with them is your heart in the condition that you're remembering your promise to him that you've been called out and you've been separated that it's him and him alone that you're cleaving only to him there isn't things of this world that you're still hanging on to there's not cares or ways you you do things that are just because the way you do things but you're married to Christ and he's become your head and you want to do things the way he wants you to do them I feel I could be more consecrated I'm myself if there's things that need to be separated I want them to separate them but I recognize that in the separating that this message is provided God's ministered unto us an entrance and a blessing that is to the bride and to the bride alone it is a holy holy holy and we're not here to be like other churches we're not here to be perfect on the tinsil but I would rather be a little broken down in the building and have a character that was ready to meet Christ than to have everything perfect after the Flesh and lack the character to meet them and I believe this is a perfect word that's perfecting a bride and it is accomplishing that which it's it's a Victorious time we're walking in Victory and the Victory is is we're his victory he takes good pleasure it may be a reproach it may feel like it's not for a purpose it may even seem like uh to you and to others it looks like defeat but if you're in his hands and in his will it's all working to his glory and to his good let's just stand together let's just approach him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we want to thank you Lord for your word and Lord the things that you can accomplish by it are only things that you can perform father you can cut away the the things that would hinder us father you can let us recognize the the glory that you've called us into to partake of with you and to share with you lord it's a a glory that's marvelous it may not be esteemed in the by the world the way that we see it father but it's the work of your hands we want to give you the praise for that we just commit each one to you father as you've dealt with them ask that Lord they would know that you're mindful of them that you're the god in their life and their situation and the walk that you have them individually Lord and that we would recognize that there's a path that only they can walk in there's a a position that only they can occupy Lord and by your spirit they'll be victorious father we commit it to you to your glory in Precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] amen did you enjoy that amen I was thinking about this scripture that uh Brother David read in Matthew Chapter 5 it says verse 13 He said ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost his savior he says wherewith with where wherewith shall it be it says it is therefore no good for nothing but be cast out and be thren under the foot ye are the light of the world a city set on the hill and cannot be hid there's no way to hide yourself there's no place to hide yourself and then it says neither do men light a candle and put it under bushel of uh uh bushel but but a a Candlestick it says and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before man that it May glorify that that that ye may glorify the good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so I just thought we never should forget as we walk around that we have been given something that we can shine we have been given a light that we can shine to the world you know it's the very expression of Christ being manifested if the many challenges come but I think often time we shy away and we think about our own things that we don't do but we come to church so God can put us in the right position you know the only thing that would stop you from praying for somebody is the devil pointing at you and accusing you but oh if you could be at such place and know that my sins are taken care of and I'm here because you called me to be here if you find yourself in a situation you would be boldly go forward and say I'm here because the situation God knew that I'll be here that's why I'm praying for this [Music] person we don't want to condemn we want our light to shine so that men will see that's what the scripture says they will look at you and they will ask a question what is it about you what makes you so different well I've been called out and the Very scripture called me separated person I've been called to fit the building that God is building not just any place but the very building that is building in the end time is that your heart desire tonight I pray if the let let let's lay aside the things of the world let's lay aside the things that are tripping us every day let's focus on this calling or this purpose that God has given us you'll find out that you'll never miss anything anyway the world seem to produce things but if you follow the word you realize it's made you more wiser it's changed your life it's produced more godliness it's produced more calmness it's taken care of situations where something else could have came why it's god making himself known in his people that's the message of the end time not just the God in heaven not just the God in Jesus Christ but the same God manifested in his people in the end time amen let's just sing that will have was a rest I [Music] remember well I was lost I was blind I was running is that your testimony tonight oh separated the brid was far to wide From The Far Side of the castle you held me in
