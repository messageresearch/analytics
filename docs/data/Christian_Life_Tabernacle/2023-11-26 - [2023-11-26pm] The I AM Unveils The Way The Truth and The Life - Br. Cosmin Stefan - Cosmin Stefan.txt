Description:
The I AM Unveils The Way The Truth and The Life 
Br. Cosmin Stefan
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 26, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

cross will not get heavy amen as we invite our brother cman Al at this time amen [Music] so let's low it a little bit Yeah so many times I question certain circumstances all things I could not [Music] under oh and many times trials my weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out our hand oh it's stand I am reminded i' never been forsaken oh I never had to stand a t alone oh as I look it all the victory his Spirit Rises up in me it's through the fire my weaknesses made strong oh he never promised that the cross will not get heavy and he will not be hard to CL oh we never offers of Victory without fighting but he said help always coming time oh and just remember when you're standing in the Valley of the S and the adversary says G just hold down our Lord will show up oh and he

when you're standing in the Valley of the seure and the adversary says [Music] give our will show up and he will take you through the fire again amen let's just bow our heads as we just ask his presence to come Among [Music] Us Lord here we are worth 86 cents a hand of dust but Lord you chose to put your spirit of Life inside of us Lord you chose that we would be the very ones that would carry your image you chose your sons and daughter Lords to get to know you at a personal level Lord how thankful we're for that life if we make those decisions in the valley on the Mountaintop in the good and the bad times Lord you're always there for us so Lord what would we do without you [Music] what would we what would we say without you the Bible says that let every man's word be a lie but your word to be true the only reason we know truth is because you came and you spoke everything else outside of that is false has no meaning has no life but Lord the truth shall set us free so we ask tonight that you would come Among Us Lord and that you would just touch our hearts and speak to our hearts Lord together and that your name would be glorified this tonight Lord we ask this now in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's just open our scriptures here to Matthew 25 pray for me you know sometimes when the Lord puts a thought on a heart it's it's really hard to try to bring it to an understanding but it because it's by Revelation it's it can't you can't explain it it's something that God has to reveal amen and so um just we're going to just keep our Bibles out because we're going to just go through through what what the Lord's wanting to tell us tonight amen Matthew 25: 31-35 and it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit a kingdom prepared for you for the from the foundation of the world Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for when I was for I wasn't hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in let's also turn to John 14 verses 6 and 7 Jesus said unto him I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also from henceforth ye know him and have seen him we just ask a blessing upon the reading of the word in Jesus Christ's name God bless you you can have your seats we were so blessed this morning morning by the message from Brother Billy I was really encouraged you know when when you say Amen to the word it it brings that life out because you're identifying with the very truth that's inside of you and so it's good to amen the word because amen means so be it so that means I want it that means that I want to I want to become the very word that we're we're we're speaking about is are not fairy tales the word of God is true and the reason is true is because it has a testimony because it has a witness behind it God always proved himself so um um I was thinking over the few days you know Thanksgiving and just like brother B BR brought out tonight you know Thanksgiving what does it mean well there's other people out in the world that think Thanksgiving was waking up at 4:00 in the morning and go to Black Friday and standing in the line for 4 hours five 6 hours to you get a laptop and that was Thanksgiving that might have been maybe the motivation to say that satisfied me doing that I actually felt good thinking I'm getting a good deal but they didn't realize they raised the prices so so now you see based upon the decision um that was thanksgiv giving to them some of them watched the so or the football game you know they were they were thankful that the Cowboys lost I mean or maybe there whichever other team or what that was their Thanksgiving that was that was what they're thankful about but I was thinking over the last few days and I said Lord I'm so thankful for life I'm so thankful for life amen now life could have a meaning to some others but to a Christian life has another meaning so I said Lord I'm thankful for life I want to I want to just talk a little just a few moments about you know the I am unveils the way the truth and the life amen the I am unveils the way the truth and the life and so we read in Matthew chapter 25 about the separation of the sheep and the goats um and so I was looking into the character of a sheep and I just kind of looked a little a little bit and and and try to find out really what the character of her sheep was and then I also went to the goat and I wanted to also look on the character of a goat and so I'm just going to I'm just going to read a few just walk along with us we're just trying to have the Lord tell us something because you know there's also a true but then there's also a false that's being put before us and so we have to understand what the false is we have to understand what the unbelief is and you see based on the character based on the things that God's wed to show us we have to discern it so we could understand what we are and what our purpose is and how God wants to use us a Christian life is not just a life to sit around a Christian Life is a working active life in God that's right I'm why do we exist otherwise that's right what's purpose of life what's the purpose of life amen so I know everybody in this room everybody is a sheep we're not going to take identities everybody's sheep every one of us is sheep because if we weren't we weren't we we didn't listen to the voice of God to come tonight a sheep listens to the master a sheep listens to her Shepherd so we're sheep but we're going to drag the character of of the go along so we can have a balance we want to make sure that we understand that there's also going to be put in things before us that we have to make the right choices so a sheep a sheep has rectangular P pull pills it can see 320 degrees around her so she can see all her enemies from 270 to 320 degrees she can see around her her eyes sheep have an excellent sense of smell sheep are Meek animal this was an interesting one sheep can self-medicate sheep are highly social animals sheep always stays together now here's another one it says sheep are emotionally complex with distinct personalities and that's to always depend on the shepherd it's always for the shepherd to be able to talk to her to be able to tell her so now here's the goat goats are Socia they're sociable animals goats are not flock oriented so they don't they're not they don't they don't like to stay together they always want to go their own way goats are one of the cleanest animals much more cleaner than cows sheeps or dogs goats are curious and intelligent animals they're stubborn goats like to wonder and explore so I'm sorry I know these are just the ABCs these are these are just things that we know does everybody know what brother Braham says the ABCs are always believe Christ this is just a law of life this is what God created so he can make us understand the dependence on him so now a sheep she likes to be she likes to be self-medicated she's a Meek animal you see sometimes God when he makes us he makes us and he identifies us as sheep because it was always the I am that needed to talk to the Sheep to the individual to lead her and to guide her because he is the way he is the way he is the truth he is the life now how can you know him how can you know him how can we know him it's by the revealed word because now the very revelated word the very word that now I receive it no longer remains as Doctrine or thought but now it takes life and now we express the very life of God just like a sheep does if she follows and she goes and she eats what does she do she Bears wool right when she gets when she's always together now there's some that you know they they go astray but they listen to The Shepherd they'll always come back I I I remember one time I was with brother Andrew we were in Africa and you know there's a lot of goats in Africa there there's they're they're everywhere and so you know some sometimes we would crawl through some areas and and really you would see a goat in the middle of a place that you wouldn't even think an animal would be but they would be on a rock eating something they were so curious they got so far away that you they they they and and all of a sudden they were just alone they were alone in a place eating they were they were eating clean they were eating good they were keeping themselves good but they were wondering they never stayed together so brother bam says this in that day of Calvary he says Jesus said that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats this is out of that day of Calvary 19 and 60 now just listen to this and again don't take an identity just pull with the word and understand that God has made us to depend on him like sheep this is the whole purpose because the I am he is the way so now he's going to show you the way now he's going to walk you into a direction where you depend on him go back and pick up that wallet now he didn't have to listen to that voice yeah he didn't have to listen to that voice but something inside of him said that's the voice of God I'm going to go back and walk another two miles so I can I can know for myself if that was God or not amen and so when you see it's God now you know the voice because it has [Music] life so now when it comes to pass you can recognize that voice and you can know if it's coming from the goat side where he wants to just go or if it's coming from the shepherd side where he always wants to keep together sheep live together together they smell alike they look alike they help each other you know when they get in the situation and they get their foot stuck in the fence there's going to be other sheep trying to get there trying to pull it out that's the family of God it's the law of God so brother bam says it says Jesus said at that day that he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats and he would say to the goat stand on the left side and to the Sheep stand on the right side and he said to the goats depart from me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was in prison and you didn't you did not visit me I was naked and you you you clothed me not I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me and to the Sheep he said I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and you ministered to me and notice don't don't fail to get this church so I want you I want I want you to pay attention because it's not a matter of doing the deed brother Bam's not talking about saying oh well somebody comes I you know I can put some foood on the table brother Bam's not talking about the actual works of the O of the of the of the source he says don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever so now I want to keep that in my heart forever he says it was so unconsciously done the people don't do it for a line of duty a man that gives you something or another it says because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it he's got a selfish idea he said it's your very life your very actions so it was surprising to these sheep that they said Lord why look at the attribute when were we hungry and we didn't feed you because that was the life when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and we gave you clothes when were we thirsty and we gave you drink when were you sick and we ministered to you it was so automatically out of love just their life lived in them he says good he says God let the people see what Calvary did for us automatically he says Lord we never knew that Look what Jesus turned and said in so much as you have done one un to these little ones unto me unselfish like not the second thought not to think about it but you are dead you are so dead to the things of the world and so alive in Christ and so walking on the highway that these things are just so automatic thing you just do it he says now not saying now the Lord would want me to do that it's not that see the the character of the goat always wanting to do his own thing always wanting to make sure that you know I I think there's maybe this other way that I can go or but you know there always there there has already been a provided way given to us why can't we stay with the provided way which already came to maturity in this generation that's right so now the I am will never leave you he will always show you the way he will always show you the truth but we have to have the right nature we have to have the right Nature by having the right nature like brother Billy was talking about it this morning I love that by having the right nature you fulfill the law by having the right nature you fulfilled the law now brother says here he says you you are just part of him his spirit is in you verse uh uh verse 43 and you act that way he acted do you get it there is a way that seem right up to a man but the Ender of his death not all that sayith Lord Lord shall enter in but they that do the will of the father just just from their hearts just freely now when we receive the Holy Ghost when we have the Life of Christ we become part of a family so now everybody has the right Spirit everybody has the same spirit because is the spirit of Christ the family of Christ so if the if the attribute of divine Love is in the spirit of Christ then that means that the Sheep the fold the flock that's the attribute of the flock always in love right because it ministers on to another and that's the character of the sheep that's what sheep do they stay together they travel together right and so and so we don't want to have we don't want to have the nature of the goat where it tries to wander so uh let's let's turn to John chapter 10 and let's see here what Jesus says we're just going to watch walk through some scriptures just enjoy the word of God tonight the I am is the way the truth and the life John 10 verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that enter it in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep so keep that in mind but he that enter in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter opened and the sheep hear his voice and he calth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out so your name he calls you by your name now what name is he calling you by he's calling you by his name he's calling you because you were in the name in the Lamb's Book of Life the name that was supposed to be in the beginning this is just your bypass this is just your Earthly name this is not your true identity the nature the goat nature wants to give you the the identity of Cosman because it wants to go do its own things you know I used to be a young I used to be a I can't say that but the Gary will will um I I when I was younger I'm sorry you know I know when I was younger you know I had that nature like a rooster you know you think you're 18 you're you're about to be Invincible you're going to win the world you you're you're going to be the richest man in the world or you're going to be the best soccer star or you're going to be the best doctor you know just the just that nature of just thriving thinking I got this this is it and then you realize oh that's not life you know you you start going through things you know you start you start you start finding out that really life is a process it's a process of training it's a process of fing it's a process of Trials it's a process of life now depending on what you use to travel this life start identifying truly what you are and who you are in Christ and when he comes and we're ready then he can take us home amen so verse four and he and and he and when he put it forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice they know his voice The Voice the I am the one that could speak to you in a tape I'm sorry it's there when we eat we eat the one that could speak through a Bible verse the one that could bring the the the very word of God that you know by the remembrance of your of the word inside of you when you eat the book you become the book so now all of a sudden that's that's the very life of the word you're no longer living by law we're no longer living like like like I well you know today I don't know because the law is not Grievious the Bible says my law is not Grievious so because God is love and it says that stranger they won't follow verse five a stranger they will not follow but they but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers the more you pay attention to the voice of God the more you pay attention to the one that speaks from within that you know comes to pass when he asks you to do something the more you know him so so now that's that's God he says he says this Parable spake ye unto them but they did they understood not the things that the things that they were which he spake unto them then Jesus said unto them again so here he is he's talking he's letting them know that he's going before them he's showing them the way of life he's showing The Obedience by the things that he suffered there was only one perfect sacrifice there was only one man that was able to overcome death Hell In The Grave amen there's only one name under heaven where anything has salvation there's only one name and that name is so important that that name wants to live inside of us and Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep hallelu the door I am am the door of the sheep and it says all that ever come before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them which is true he's always take care of them he's always walked with them because they were sheep right because they were wanting to be driven by the very Shepherd by the very Voice by her husband because now you're no longer living under under the law because you have the truth when you have the truth you're no longer under the law you should be made free so now law is not no longer something where I have to think about doing no it's automatic there it's a revelation it's a word it's something that you do because of the love of the god the love of the word amen and it says but the Sheep did not hear them he says I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go out in and out and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy now if you have the nature of the goat and you go that direction then then then then the consequences brings that upon us because because the devil now has access you're no longer under the authority of the word and so depending on the decision you make depending on the on the unbelief depending on the life depending on the the personal relationship we have the decisions we make the voice we listen to it defines life it defines God manifested in life because he wants to have a marriage covenant with every one of his children it says I am come today that they might have life I am come today that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for his sheep the Good Shepherd gave his life for his sheep how much more we which are part of the family of God the ones that that that that are are are Spirit of his Spirit bone of his bone flesh of his flesh we should be living for him that way because in death remember there's life in the beginning when everything was perfect and the first unbelief came what it produces death man had to till the soil even even the vegetables had to die to feed them everything was death and so now we come to the civilizations up until the second Adam and now he's restoring life now he's restoring the very life the perfect life that was in the beginning back to the beginning we're going just I love how Brother David even brought it out he says we're going backwards now we're going back to life because it's no longer about the letter it's now about the life of Jesus Christ overcoming in our life and it's no longer I that makes the decision it's no longer I that wants to go my Direction but it's Christ that speaks for me and by his blood I can overcome because remember when we pray brother bam said when we pray it's not you that prays but it's the blood of Jesus Christ that intervenes and ask for you ask anything in his name ask anything in his name and he'll give it to us now turn to uh John 17 because see this is a finished work this is something that God has already accomplished it just needs to take flesh it just needs to manifest but the only way is the I am because he is the way he is the truth he is is the life it says I pray for them verse uh ver chapter 19: 9- 15 it says I pray for them this is in the garden this is a very sacred moment this is a very special moment this is the moment where he intervenes for the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the moment where he claims them this is the moment where he sanctifies them this is the moment where he's identifying them the very ones the elected the sheep and we're in this prayer we're here this is our life he says I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for they are Dy right and all of mine are thine and all of thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world so he's no longer in the world but you are in the world because by the power of the Holy Ghost by the power of the name of Jesus Christ now he has access to his bride but it says but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thy own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou givest me I kept and none of them is lost none of them is lost but the son of predition it says that the scriptures might be fulfilled and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them my Thy word and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of this world I pray not that thou shouldn't stake them out of the world but that thou should keep them from Evil because life has to be flesh life has to manifest we can't we we can't we God wants this character to be so polished he wants to have it so perfect because it's the fullness of the godhead bodily back now in this generation this is this is the I am this is the truth this is the way this is the life this is the spirit of Christ this is the last this is the last age there's no more so this is the life this is this is the way this is the truth and and so brother Bram says says this we won't be we won't be too much longer tonight God bless you brother bam says in God's provided place of worship I'm trying to you know sometimes you you you hear these sayings you know it says I just want to nail the the nail to the Cross we I I Jesus Christ is the way Jesus Christ is the way he is the I am he is the truth he is the way he is the life he's the very one that was from the beginning to the end he's the very one that accomplished the work of Salvation it was him it was always him it says there's so many infallible proofs that Jesus is the place he is the gate paragraph 38 he is the name he is the only provided way that God has for men to meet and worship he is the way the truth the life the gate the door the alpha the Omega the beginning and the ending amen the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Morning Star the alpha the Omega he is the whole thing put together he is both the root and the offsprings of David he's the bride and The Morning Star in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead Bing where we are in there as Sons and Daughters to God he says in God's godhead in God's godhead Amen in God's godhead it says yes as Sons and Daughters we're in the family we're in there now how do we get into this place to worship that's a good question it says that's the next question how do we get into this place if Jesus is this place he is the name of God he is the place place of God's worship he is the only door to the Sheepfold and we want to find out how we get into him then now if you're into a door of course you come in like in the family you know when when when you have family you you you come in just like in the family and we was talking the other day at the breakfast about little sheep that God would not closed the door until he found that last sheep and brought him in if you've come in then you become a family you're a family of God you've come into God but you can't be a family of God under the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal it says you can't do it you have to come into Jesus Christ well you say we did it well if you did it let's find out what the Bible says 1 Corinthians chapter 12 the Bible says by one Spirit we are baptized into one body we're baptized into the body of Christ by one Holy Spirit we're not shook in it we're not joined in it we're not baptized with water in we are baptized with the Holy Ghost into the body of Jesus Christ how long does it last until you get there until you misbelieve your until you misbehave yourself Ephesians 4:30 grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption that's right argue with him not with me that's what it says I'm reading it you're sealed into the day of your Redemption until the day that Jesus comes for you he said then think of it you are then not yourself you are a new creature for the Greek there means a new creation you've been recreated again the power of God comes upon you and you become a created a new creature webrings the whole physical being spiritual being and everything subject to the word of God no other way that's the word of God that's the I am that's the way that's the truth amen so John 14 says that that I am the way the truth and the life and I wanted to just read a few quotes on I am the way brother brandham has a sermon on that it says a guide I am the way and so remember a Son of God walks only into the footstep that have been forward in before him because he knows the voice he knows that he knows he knows the decisions he can make he knows he knows his relationship with God he knows when God speaks to him he knows when when those things happen but the more you get closer to him the more now that God wants to show you the way and so it says you know when I was a child you know there would be things where I might have thought they were right but then God came and and put a condemnation in my heart and and and and I was like Lord I'm sorry I I shouldn't have done that so so now it's a matter of the repentance in my heart to know that I'm wrong if I know what the truth says now I can say Lord I'm sorry I I know I've done it I might have been maybe carried away or whatever it was but I Repent of that I'm sorry now that's the way amen that's the way that's how you know the way when you repent you know the way because now he tells you the next step he tells you what to do he tells you what you're going to be he tells you what the word that you're going to fulfill so it's brother bam says in the guide 1962 it says God sends a guide and God wants you to remember that his appointed guide and we must remember him here it says Jesus said I will not leave you but I'll pray for the I'll pray that the father he'll send you another comforter and this comforter when he was to come guide us to all truth and the word of God is truth and the word is Christ I am the way the truth the life he is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then if we follow the true the real true guide the Holy Spirit he was to tell us what he had seen what he had heard and what he was to show us things that is to come amen there you are he's going to show you things to come and when the churches today reject that how can we ever expect to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to us to a guy for a guy will take up some Cardinals some Bishop some general overse or somebody like that to guide us that's that's deep I'm sorry that's true that is the truth because we would rather seek for men's pleasure than to seek for the word of God knowing that maybe it could bring condemnation I might have to repent but now the Sheep knows what to do because she's got the right character Lord I'm sorry sorry right Lead Me Guide Me show me the way it says it says when the Holy Spirit was given to us to guide us 27 and the Holy Spirit always speaks of the word I've got many things here to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason of the okay that's the reason the come of the seals okay listen to where he's going he'll guide you that's the reason of the says the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished and it says to know who God is and what he is and how he lives his nature his being it says you're supposed to be all the way up here at that time see bringing us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God a church that's been washed in the blood of Christ that's bought without money is spay for by the blood of Jesus Christ so when the truth came we were able to see the way the truth and the life justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost in one flesh and that was the first one that came to maturity by the full stature of a perfect Son by the revealed word by the very life that he was living it says 28 it says now here we are a guide and he is God's provided guide now we're going through a Wilderness and we're on a road somewhere and we can't get along without this guide so remember the goat nature not getting along with the guide remember he's the one that knows the way amen you can't tell him that you know the way I'm sorry I just you know these are ABCs he knows the way he knows where he's taking us he knows exactly the word we need to where he's taking us so I must trust my shepherd I must trust the very one that wants me the receive full Redemption because it's by every Movement by Every Word by every every every every revelated word that now we have he's taking us on the way until we get translated like like Enoch it's a constant walk amen it says now here we are a guide and he is God's provided guide it says we're going through the Wilderness and we're on the road somewhere and we can't get along without this guide and dare anybody to try to substitute any other guide if you do he'll take you off the line this guy knows the way he knows every inch of the way he knows every thought that's in your heart he knows everything everybody that's here he knows who you are and what you've done and all about you he's the guide he's the Holy Spirit and he will reveal things to you and will tell you things that he's heard it says can't repeat your words your words right back and say what you've said amen tell you what you've been what you've got where you're going a guide is the correct guide and he will guide you to truth to all truth and his word is truth so the guide takes us to truth the guide takes you to the law in other words like brother Billy was talking about this morning that was a beautiful message the law the law has set us free because now we know the truth now he showed us the way and now he he he he he is the truth let's turn to John chapter 8 the truth we won't we won't be much longer I'm verse chap verses 25 so then said they unto him who art thou and Jesus said unto them even the same that I said unto you from the beginning I have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him now that's the life of a believer as the life of a born again believer he that sent me is true and I speak I speak it says and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him and they understand not that he spake of them of the father then he said unto them then Jesus said unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that I am he and I that I do nothing of myself but as the it says as my father had taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father had not left me alone for I do always those things that please him I do always the things that please him I believe Hebrews 11:6 for it is impossible to please God without faith without faith it is impossible to please God now Faith in the truth faith in something that has life Faith in something that when you catch it it reflects the very life of Jesus Christ inside of us it's no longer um it's no longer um it's no longer a law it's no longer uh just dead words thinking about now it becomes a life now you're living the very revelated word in love and it's not Grievious to you you just said no Lord I can do better I can live a cleaner life and he spake these words and many believed and then he said to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and he and and says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so the truth is the Fulfillment of the law the truth is the the Fulfillment of the law the law was only there to expose the devil the sin it was only there to let you know that hey if you steal that's not if you if you if you have any other God that's you know he just wants to catch your attention so now when you no longer are bound by that law but you're free in the spirit now you're fulfilling the law now it's something that God shows you by the truth so he shows you the way to the truth and then he shows you the truth he gives you the truth amen John 18 I just want to emphasize on the truth I want to um you know truth is very important truth is very important because if you believe anybody or anything they say you gather a lot of trash I'm sorry right you know you you know I do it it's okay I I have to repent of those things you know but sometimes you get caught up in the moment and you're just you know you're just looking at something and you're just you're reading more more than you should and all of a sudden you're like oh I should have never read that and you you you catch yourself you catch yourself but it's a matter of catching yourself faster and knowing you know what I I shouldn't even do that leave it alone now that's God leading you now you're being a sheep now you're going by but the heart that voice that tells you inside of you're being so sensitive to the Holy Ghost you're not grieving the Holy Ghost because if you grieve the Holy Ghost then you're no longer under the seal so grieve not the Holy Ghost because you're sealed until the day of your Redemption am you're sealed until the day of their Redemption that's what it's so important to have that marriage covenant so close with your with your husband with the with God where you you follow every leadership that he tells you to do you know sometimes we walk into stores and and things and we just we just pass by real fast we just check out or we just do you know and sometimes God said look your life could have reflected your kindness amen John 18 truth so here's Jesus pilate's got before him and he's asked a question so verse 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him verse 33 to 40 art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it the of me like do you have a revelation or are you just saying what everybody else heard like do you know when you ask the question like do you know the Revel behind it or do you just listen and and you memorize it as as as just a language okay it says pilate answered am I a Jew it says thy own Nation so see now he's he's going the other nature he says thy own nation and the chief priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king J art thou a king then he Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king and it says to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth that he should bear witness to be a witness of the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice then pilate said unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and said to them I find him no fault at all but ye have a custom that I should release unto one of the Passover will ye therefore that I release unto you a king of the Jews then cried they all again saying not this man but Barabas and Barabas was a robber so what is truth truth is the very word of God being lived in the love of God because now you're obeying the law now now he showed you the way he gave you the truth and those two produces the life amen right because now is the very life that you're walking by brother brandham says this in in the token he says God once gave a rainbow sign for a token it says got a rainbow signed for a token verse uh 61 6 1964 I've just got about 10 minutes and then have my prayer line he said he never remained true to that token he says he ever remained true to that token did he he does yet he spoke the rainbow that was a covenant that was a promise it's been in there every sense because God is true and when he speaks something it'll be there until he says so until he has the time for it it says all these thousands of years he's never once one time failed to display it he was true to that token shows us that he ever he says and never will fail to honor his token it says I don't care it says if Jesus don't come for 10,000 years you might have the token he's still got to honor it no matter how things changes and whatever more he's got to honor that token he said he would he said he expects us now to display his token over our god-given faith to every unbeliever cult in the nation and in the world that believes that signs and wonders don't follow the Believers and be true to this token and show that the fair has been paid and we've been accepted for the resurrection having the token life inside of us now that's the kingdom of God that is God in our hearts that is God in our flesh that is now the word of God taking truth because you're no longer thinking about the ways of man and the lies of the devil and all of the influence of the world we can live by truth it says that's a cutting message but it's the truth that's what we need is truth God help us to know truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen the life and we're closing Romans 6 verse 22 and 23 it says but now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruits unto Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen 8 1-4 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of the sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we can stand we'll invite the musicians to come I wanted to read just two more quotes before closing but life the I am is the way the truth and the life and nobody could get there but by him by Jesus Christ he is the door he is the shepherd He is the truth he is everything brother brandham says this in the voice of the sign 1964 there's only one form of eternal life if you've got eternal life then you yourself was in God's thinking before the world was created you're an attribute of his thinking CU eternal life never did begin or never can end you are a part of God's economy always it's just reflecting so so now it's just reflecting it's already been prophesied just like brother Billy mentioned this morning the word has already been prophesied now it has to take reflection now it has to say says it's becoming it says now you've got one more picture to develop that's death then the negative becomes positive then you're in the bride and with Christ as he thought it says like husband and wife today so God Christ and it says and the church will be the same amen death that I Must Die daily that's right death not just in a carnal death like I'm just going to go in the ground no that was the law of life is you put away death you choose the word you choose the life you choose the you choose this way every day not just on Wednesdays or Sundays it's every day it's the life where I wake up in the morning and Lord take me protect me be with me Lord let me you know all of a sudden you start walking with God and I'm telling you you walk with God and he walks with you real close he's always there for you when you're in a situation he's there for you when you're in sickness he's there for you when you're in trouble he's there for you when you're lost he's there to show you back the way when you think you got to figure it out there's still Grace and he wants to show you again hey this is the way this is the truth This Is The Life yeah this is the very one that came and you know that it wasn't going to fail because he's already overcame to him that overcome and Revelation three says will I let to sit with me on my throne even as I overcame and I sat with my father on his throne an overcomer eternal life death then the negative becomes positive now brother bam says this and who's this mkis in closing 1965 it says and then you see he come right on he says he come right down verse 33 it says and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute to it says before the foundation of the world his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life it says then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany but you bypass the theop the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting for we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God Hallelujah that's the spirit of God overcoming death this man is dead this man is death all he wants to do always run towards towards death that's the goat nature that's always that nature that takes you to death a way may see a ride unto a man but the Ender of his death but the BAM said it earlier that's that goat nature that's the one that always runs to death but the spirit of life is God himself wanting to show truly what life means it's a constant it's a constant life so you could be tempted by sin by unbelief so he can prove that the Bride of Jesus Christ does nothing but the word of God it says but look when this body receives the Holy Ghost The Immortal Life inside of you you it throws his body in subjection to God hallelujah he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin therefore is no there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws you body subject it says you don't have to say well oh if I could just quit drinking or if I could just get in Christ and it's all gone see because the body because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of a life my the importance of Life the I am the way the truth and the life he showed us what to be like I choose life every day I want to choose life every day Lord I I don't know the way but you know the way and the reason you know the way is cuz you already put the way inside of me and as a sheep I already know the way because I know the voice that tells me the way amen and when I know the way then I know that it comes to pass amen because God does nothing until he brings it to pass amen he always proves his word so now when you see God moving upon your life then now he can show you the way the truth and the life and before you know it it'll be like a moment and a twinkling of an eye and we'll be changed Saints will be changed the Life Meaning of Life Life the true kind of life was in the beginning amen Adam and Eve tasted life Jesus tasted life because he was able to live in a condition with all the sin around him and he was The Perfect Bride an adul ated lamb without a spot without a wrinkle amen that was a life amen so he came himself to show us what life is like every decision every way everything that you do is that life now that lives in you and it's no longer this death flesh this this 86 Cent Tabernacle but it's the it's the word of God made flesh and the spirit and it's the spirit now has subject upon this flesh and it says no dead flesh no dead Roman that's not what the word says you can have patience you can have meekness you can have humility you can love the Lord you can seek for the truth you can get on your knees you can say a longer prayer you can look into the message you can find life because life is in the truth hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken it so you can make a flesh so people can see you living a life hallu you don't have to say a word you walk like Peter walked in the shadow I'm I'm sorry this is truth it's not a fairy tale the presence of God so recognized in Peter's life that he Shadow was healing everyone that was walking on the street That's The Power of Jesus Christ that is Jesus Christ that is the life of God now by death to everything of this world it produces the life of god let's bow our heads what is life Lord You've showed us the life father Lord where we have been if you haven't sent Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10:7 7 Luke 17:30 this beautiful unfolding of the seals and all this work that you've done if we don't manifest the very word of God Lord let not the message just be a way of talking or a Doctrine or things that we just say but Lord let this life that was in Christ Jesus be in US Lord that we would be able to reflect the first church the one that we're restored back to life that was in the beginning life that was in in in in the garden without a Bible without a message without a tape life the very proof the very work of God manifested here among the dead but you have a living and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ Living today by your truth father what would we be without you lord I we I I I I I Lord I want I want you to make every decision for us for me lead us into the way that we should go the truth shall set us free and now that life could be living inside of us in so much that people would come in because of the life lived Behind These closed doors it's the life that attracts other life it's not the words it's the life that attracts the other life it's the Deep call it to the Deep it's the word coming to the word it's it's it's Christ coming to Christ uniting together in Divine love the Capstone Lord what a privilege what a word Lord I pray that you bless us Lord bless brother David Lord Lord return them back home safely Lord Lord continue to to keep him here as a Shepherd Lord and lead them into the into the into the ways that you know that you have Lord Lord give him truth and give him all the things that he has need of Lord protect them Lord be with there for him Lord he's been a he's been a Shepherd Lord he's been given his life for you lord lord and you can see the work that you've done bless him Lord encourage him Lord Lord bless us we love you thank you for giving us life and from this moment maybe if we can choose to get closer to life to the very revealed word of the hour knowing that we can walk with it we can talk with it we can manifest that it could always be upon our minds it could always be around us in so much that now it's it's our daily Duty it's our daily it's our daily life that speaks around us we love you father we thank you for loving us we love you only because you first loved us we commit our time this evening now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I wanted to sing this song real quick as we just invite brother Billy Jesus there's something about that name there's something about that name [Music] Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus about that name oh Master Savior [Music] Jesus the r oh Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus let all heaven and [Music] earth oh will all pass way oh but there's something about that name sing it one more time oh Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus oh there just something how about name oh Master oh Hallelujah Jesus like a [Music] fragrance after the rain oh Jesus Jesus Jesus oh let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim oh and King and kingom will all pass away but there's something about our Hallelujah aren't you thankful for life amen you know the scripture says I believe Paul says the life which I now live it says it's not his own life but I live by the faith of the Son of God who died and he gave himself for me you know we not have to great Exposition what we need in I would I I want to say this and forgive me if you don't agree with me we're not even looking for power we are looking for life amen amen I I my my desire is not to go raise everybody out of the grave no I want that life because if I have that life the life will direct me in the way that it wants me to go life will lead me when when when it's time just like he did with Jesus I only do what pleases the father people have great demonstration and they say it's the life it may not be the life because remember he said many will come in that day will say Lord if we not done this we he said depart from me you didn't do it by me you did it for so you can prove yourself so people can see you but if you have life the scripture says he that has the son has life I want the son tonight I I want his life within my life I want to him to remove the Stony heart and the dirty spirit and I want him to put a new spirit and they take his spirit and put into my spirit that's life you know the prophet will say that the the law was only a school Master because when there was no law there was no transgression because there was no law now the law was given to to to help to save but when the law showed up then everybody realized that they couldn't keep it they realized how they were rugged and they were all Sinners and they were all Breaking the Law like they were better off without it but it was there to save them but yet expose the nature of man but that was only God showing that the nature within you cannot keep my word what you need is a new spirit what you need is my spirit you cannot do it by the flesh but when you get my spirit my spirit will cause you to obey my law because
