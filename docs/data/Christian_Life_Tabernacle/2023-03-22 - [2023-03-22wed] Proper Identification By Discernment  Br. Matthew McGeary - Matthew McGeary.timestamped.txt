[34:03] you sent a message Lord faith comes by
[34:06] hearing and hearing a word Lord and you
[34:08] sent a word Lord that would produce a
[34:10] faith in us that we can believe all
[34:12] things so Lord Here We Are Tonight
[34:14] father asking that you would come Lord
[34:16] break the bread of life to us tonight
[34:18] Lord as only you can Lord may we just
[34:21] move our thoughts and our feelings aside
[34:23] Lord maybe we've had a a hard day and
[34:26] and the enemy's been after our mind and
[34:28] we're tired and body but Lord here we
[34:31] are to just lay at your feet tonight
[34:34] have communion
[34:35] [Music]
[34:37] Lord we
[34:40] just want to start letting the cares of
[34:42] the world just fall away
[34:45] Lord though we've been students of the
[34:47] word and we've heard many sermons and
[34:51] listened to
[34:53] many preachers
[34:56] Lord You're The Living Hope
[35:00] and we don't want to take this as just a
[35:03] routine
[35:04] but we want to look into your word and
[35:06] know that you're here by Divine promise
[35:08] to speak to our Heart Lord
[35:10] because your word is a discerner
[35:13] knows exactly what we have need of
[35:16] so now Lord we just Avail ourselves to
[35:18] your Holy Spirit to come and move in a
[35:20] supernatural way we pray
[35:22] and Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[35:25] amen praise His wonderful name if you
[35:27] have your Bibles let's turn in Hebrews
[35:28] chapter 5.
[35:43] just a familiar reading here Hebrews
[35:45] chapter 5 we'll be reading verse
[35:48] 12 through 14.
[35:54] maybe we'll just step back one verse of
[35:57] whom we have many things to say and had
[35:59] hard to be uttered senior dull of
[36:01] hearing for when the time he ought to be
[36:04] teachers you have need that one teach
[36:06] you again which be the first principles
[36:08] of the Oracles of God and are become
[36:10] such as have need of milk
[36:14] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[36:16] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[36:20] righteousness for he is a babe but
[36:23] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[36:25] of full age
[36:26] even those who by reason of use having
[36:29] their senses exercised to discern both
[36:33] Good and Evil Prophet when reading that
[36:36] he would say to know what's right and
[36:39] wrong by discernment we just pray a
[36:41] blessing upon the word you may be seated
[36:45] just want to read a little statement out
[36:47] of the church age book
[36:49] brother Branham says now remember this
[36:51] Christ in the true church is a
[36:53] continuation of the book of Acts
[36:56] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[36:59] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[37:01] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[37:05] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[37:08] revealing his works and attempted
[37:10] destruction of God's people and the
[37:12] discrediting of God's word right down to
[37:14] the time that he is cashed into the Lake
[37:16] of Fire
[37:17] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[37:20] knows that if the people get the true
[37:23] revelation of the true church and what
[37:25] she is and what she stands for and that
[37:29] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[37:32] an invincible Army if they get a true
[37:35] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[37:37] framework of the Christian church and by
[37:40] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[37:43] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[37:46] powerless
[37:48] before her now I just want to maybe
[37:51] speak to you a little bit about proper
[37:53] identification by discernment you know
[37:56] just just when he says here by God's
[37:58] spirit discern and withstand we want to
[38:00] be able to properly identify the spirits
[38:03] we want to be able to properly discern
[38:05] and if we're going to do that it's going
[38:07] to come by Revelation it's going to come
[38:09] by the spirit of God if we're ever going
[38:11] to have proper discernment it's going to
[38:13] be by the spirit it's going to be by
[38:16] Revelation and as our pastor spoke about
[38:18] maturing to reality he dealt with
[38:21] perception and I just really appreciated
[38:24] that because you know it's so easy to
[38:27] allow your your preconceived ideas and
[38:29] the way you think things might be or or
[38:31] maybe you studied a certain subject and
[38:33] if we're not careful we end up putting
[38:35] God into a box we kind of whenever a
[38:37] minister starts going down a certain
[38:39] Trail or something we're like oh yes
[38:41] I've already studied that I know where
[38:43] he's going and you actually start
[38:45] connecting all of the dots
[38:46] intellectually and you totally close the
[38:49] Holy Spirit out from the equation but if
[38:52] you'll just act like you've never heard
[38:54] it before and say oh God why didn't you
[38:55] start to speak to my heart what are you
[38:57] trying to say to me Lord I have a knee
[38:59] tonight I want you to speak to me and
[39:02] you count it as though you haven't
[39:03] obtained anything and you just press
[39:05] toward the mark of the high calling and
[39:07] you can learn from Jesus Christ he can
[39:09] speak to your heart but you know your
[39:11] preconceived ideas and the way that
[39:13] you've you've come to know something can
[39:15] really be a big hindrance
[39:17] you know as a certified artist you know
[39:20] I'll be called on as a tree doctor and
[39:22] I'll go out to to a customer's house and
[39:24] and you know they they'll tell me well
[39:26] this is this is what's going on and some
[39:28] of them are like well yeah my tree got
[39:30] hit by lightning
[39:31] I'm like oh you don't say they're like
[39:33] yeah you see right here uh right here
[39:35] this black mark going down the tree and
[39:37] the limbs laying over and here they're
[39:38] going to explain to me like I'm supposed
[39:40] to be the expert I'm supposed to be the
[39:42] tree doctor I'm the one that they've
[39:43] called over to see what I can do for the
[39:45] tree but they're telling me everything
[39:47] that happened it was storming and the
[39:49] winds were blowing and I heard the
[39:50] flashing the the a big Flash and a big
[39:52] boom and I come outside and this limb
[39:54] was on the ground and and after they get
[39:56] that this is their perception they're
[39:58] telling me it's like well you know um
[40:00] that wasn't lightning
[40:03] um you know that that black mark there
[40:04] is just a bad Union where where the
[40:06] limbs were growing together and it was
[40:07] promoting some rotten Decay and the
[40:09] winds came in the no I heard it I saw
[40:11] the last I saw the flash of light and I
[40:13] come out there and you see that black
[40:14] mark and you're like well I'll tell you
[40:16] what isn't that something
[40:17] but you see they they have a they they
[40:19] already know they've self-diagnosed the
[40:22] situation they they they they because of
[40:25] what they heard because of what they saw
[40:27] and because of what they felt and when
[40:29] they come out and they saw it on the
[40:30] ground they come to these conclusions
[40:33] and that's a lot of times what we do
[40:35] with our own perceptions
[40:37] we self-diagnose we come to a conclusion
[40:40] we study a certain subject we listen to
[40:42] the message and and if we're not careful
[40:45] all said we put God in a box that's no
[40:47] longer a living hope it's a dead hope
[40:49] it's a dead religion it's just a Creed
[40:51] and it's a Dogma look if you think you
[40:53] can do a book report on on the invisible
[40:55] Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[40:58] the Heavenly bridegroom and just come up
[41:00] with with a summation and say here this
[41:02] is what the prophet was saying you've
[41:03] missed it
[41:05] you've missed it now it'll speak to you
[41:07] in this season that you're living you
[41:09] can say oh this is how it spoke to me
[41:11] and this is this is what popped out to
[41:13] me this time to tell you and listen to
[41:15] it the next day listen to it the next
[41:16] week listen to it the next month and
[41:18] that word will just be a Living Word
[41:20] continuing to speak to you continuing to
[41:23] lead you and guide you why because the
[41:25] scripture says in Hebrews 4 12 it says
[41:27] for the word of God is quick
[41:30] powerful
[41:31] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[41:34] piercing even to the divining asunder of
[41:37] Soul and Spirit
[41:38] and the joints in the marrow and what is
[41:41] it it's a discerner
[41:44] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[41:47] it's not a one-time thing
[41:50] it's a discerner of the thought and
[41:52] intents of your heart
[41:54] the discerner of the thoughts and
[41:56] intents of situations and that's what we
[41:59] want is that Living Word to be alive and
[42:01] moving inside of us
[42:03] because the words are discerner
[42:06] you know the prophet
[42:08] talks about an anointed ones at the end
[42:10] time he goes let me just show you how
[42:11] deceptive the devil is
[42:13] and he starts to talk about Martin there
[42:15] I believe we just recently heard this
[42:17] and how he's there in a study and then
[42:19] all of a sudden here this this one
[42:22] appears before Martin and it looks like
[42:23] Jesus and he has a crown on his hand he
[42:25] says Oh Martin Bow Down and Worship me
[42:30] and that Prophet there he kept looking
[42:31] at him and just something didn't seem
[42:34] quite right and the prophet says look
[42:36] the scriptures kept running through his
[42:38] mind because what was he doing he was
[42:41] Discerning by the word the word is a
[42:43] discerner he was looking at the
[42:45] situation and say my this looks good
[42:47] this looks right this looks like it's of
[42:49] the Lord
[42:51] but what did he do he went to the wire
[42:53] and he said you know what what does the
[42:54] word have to say about this and that
[42:56] Prophet stood there the word now
[42:58] Discerning says no Satan you get behind
[43:01] me because the word says that the Saints
[43:03] will crown him on that day and you're
[43:05] wearing a crown right now that's
[43:06] contrary to the word of God
[43:08] and one of the Prophet go on and say he
[43:10] says you know that would have been good
[43:11] Pentecostal bait
[43:14] and something that looks good it looks
[43:16] right it has a good feeling it gots a
[43:19] lot of emotion to it oh I tell you what
[43:21] this is just this is just so good sounds
[43:24] like Peter he got all worked up one day
[43:26] man it's just good to be here isn't this
[43:29] good I'm gonna go build a tabernacle for
[43:31] for Moses and I'm gonna build a
[43:33] tabernacle for Elijah and I'm gonna what
[43:35] else and he was a pagan
[43:38] right there in the presence of this Lord
[43:40] Peter turned into a pagan
[43:42] he can make a tabernacle for three gods
[43:45] don't tell me Peter didn't think it was
[43:47] right
[43:48] he was enthused he was excited he was
[43:52] ready to get it done
[43:54] how many times do we get enthused how
[43:56] many times do we get excited how many
[43:58] times do do we feel something is right
[44:00] and we want to run off after something
[44:03] but we need to be properly taught
[44:04] because the word is a discerner
[44:08] we have to apply the word and allow the
[44:10] word to discern it that way we can step
[44:12] back and say no right here it says right
[44:15] here in the Bible no the prophet said
[44:16] this and the word will discern that
[44:19] situation in your life
[44:21] if we'll just wait on him
[44:26] remember if they get a true revelation
[44:29] of the two Spirits within the framework
[44:31] of the Christian church and by God's
[44:34] spirit discern and withstand the
[44:36] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[44:39] powerless before her
[44:42] now we are not waiting for something in
[44:44] the future to come
[44:47] and I want to just say this
[44:49] the prophet already manifested this
[44:54] this has already been manifested when he
[44:58] says if they get a true revelation of
[45:00] the two Spirits within the framework of
[45:02] the Christian church
[45:03] what did we receive look the word the
[45:07] word came in this age in this generation
[45:08] the revealing of the son of man it was
[45:10] made flesh it was a discerner of the
[45:13] thoughts and intents it was the
[45:14] discerner of the two Spirits within the
[45:16] framework of the church
[45:18] and it was by God's spirit he withstood
[45:21] that Antichrist spirit and I tell you in
[45:23] the name of the Lord Satan was powerless
[45:26] before the prophet of the age
[45:29] he was powerless before him
[45:32] and the prophet was subject to the word
[45:34] and and I just want to say this as we
[45:36] maybe get to this a little later our
[45:39] definition and our preconceived idea of
[45:42] what powerless means and what an
[45:44] invincible Army has been very obscured
[45:49] we we have our definition of what what
[45:52] it means of Satan's powerless before we
[45:54] have our definition of what it means for
[45:56] the bride to be in an invincible Army
[45:58] because we got all this Hollywood and
[46:00] television programs and we think we're
[46:02] going to be some Spider-Man and some
[46:04] Superman and we're going to be this
[46:06] invincible Army running around emptying
[46:08] out hot that is not what God had in his
[46:10] mind
[46:12] it's going to be according to the word
[46:17] that's exactly why Jesus had to rebuke
[46:19] Peter
[46:21] hear the Lord's telling Peter look this
[46:23] is I yes I'm the Messiah I have come and
[46:27] now these are the things that I have to
[46:28] do I have to die I have to go away
[46:31] but Peter tells the Lord no Lord not so
[46:34] you're not going to do those things look
[46:36] at who he's talking to
[46:38] because Peter had in his mind what the
[46:41] Lord had come to do well he's going to
[46:43] restore the kingdoms we're gonna we're
[46:45] gonna kick all the Romans out of here
[46:47] we're going to have the promised land
[46:48] all of ourselves we're going to be an
[46:50] invincible Army he's just going to go
[46:51] around and pluck all these Romans and
[46:53] throw them out of here we're just going
[46:54] to have a good old time and they were
[46:55] all waiting when is this going to happen
[46:57] and now all of a sudden he's saying no
[46:59] look I Gotta Die I got to go fulfill all
[47:00] these things that Peter's saying not so
[47:02] Lord
[47:03] that's why Jesus turned to Peter and
[47:05] rebuked him because Peter was under a
[47:07] preconceived idea Peter was leaning to
[47:10] his own understanding Peter was leaning
[47:12] to his intellect and I'm afraid that
[47:14] many of us have got caught in the same
[47:16] trap of our own intellectual
[47:18] interpretation of the message and if
[47:20] we're not careful we're just good
[47:22] Baptists and good Pentecostals with some
[47:24] fake Creator some Dogma that won't take
[47:27] you out of the grave
[47:29] we gotta die out to our own thinking
[47:32] Gotta Die out to our own ideas
[47:35] for the word with say in Romans 8 14 for
[47:38] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[47:40] they are the sons of God
[47:43] now I just want to lay in this quote
[47:44] again out of the church age book
[47:52] you can even memorize the scripture
[47:55] and though that is wonderful that won't
[47:58] do it
[47:59] it has to be a revelation from God
[48:02] it says in the word that no man can say
[48:05] that Jesus is the Christ except by the
[48:07] Holy Ghost
[48:09] you have to receive the Holy Ghost
[48:13] and then
[48:14] and only then can the spirit give you
[48:18] the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ
[48:21] God the anointed one
[48:24] no man knows the things of God save the
[48:27] spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit
[48:29] of God reveals them
[48:32] we need to call on God for Revelation
[48:35] more than anything else in the world
[48:40] now have we just become good uh message
[48:43] Believers and we just put a check mark
[48:46] by that well I have already done that
[48:48] or should we call on God for Revelation
[48:51] more than anything else in the world
[48:53] should that be something that's constant
[48:56] something we're constantly praying for
[48:58] Revelation praying for Faith In God's
[49:01] word
[49:04] we have accepted the Bible we have
[49:06] accepted the great truths of it
[49:08] I I feel like he's speaking to message
[49:10] Believers now
[49:11] you you've accepted that God sent a
[49:14] prophet you've accepted Malachi 4 5 and
[49:17] Luke 17 30 and all of these wonderful
[49:19] things
[49:21] but it still is not real
[49:25] to most people because the Revelation by
[49:29] the spirit is not there
[49:31] now
[49:33] don't let that discourage you
[49:35] that's an encouragement
[49:38] to let you know that that's why you are
[49:40] here that is why God sent the message
[49:43] that's why you believe the Bible and the
[49:45] great truths that have been revealed in
[49:47] this hour and now he's telling you that
[49:50] it will become real what did our pastor
[49:52] talk about maturing to reality
[49:55] we need Revelation by the spirit to make
[49:59] this message a reality in our life
[50:04] now as we just keep moving in a certain
[50:06] direction Jesus would say in Matthew 26
[50:09] 41 he'd say watch and pray that you
[50:11] enter not into temptation
[50:14] the spirit is willing but the flesh is
[50:17] weak
[50:19] you know one of the things about the
[50:21] flesh
[50:22] the flesh is weak you know one of the
[50:25] weaknesses is
[50:28] we're too strong
[50:31] we we try to serve God in our own
[50:34] capacity and our own ability
[50:37] what it what did Paul say in Galatians 3
[50:39] 3 said oh oh foolish Galatians
[50:43] that you started in the spirit but now
[50:45] are you perfected in the flesh
[50:48] we're guilty of that I was telling
[50:50] brother Billy they're just in the office
[50:52] I said that's a refrigerator uh
[50:54] scripture that needs to be on the
[50:56] bathroom mirror are you so foolish
[50:58] having begun in the spirit that you're
[51:00] now perfected In the Flesh many of us
[51:02] come into the great truth and the great
[51:04] revelation of the message and we catch
[51:06] some some wonderful things and if we're
[51:08] not careful we start to lean on our own
[51:10] understanding we start to lean on our
[51:13] own intellectual capacity we start to
[51:16] lean on things that we've maybe uh heard
[51:18] and if we're not careful we don't let
[51:20] the Holy Spirit by Revelation bring
[51:23] those things to a reality in our life
[51:28] the prophet would say this in perfect
[51:29] strength by Perfect weakness God passes
[51:32] those who think there's something
[51:35] to take somebody that don't know nothing
[51:40] in order to work his purpose in their
[51:43] life
[51:44] well praise God
[51:46] God passes those that think there's
[51:49] something to take somebody that don't
[51:51] know nothing oh
[51:53] well at least I got that part figured
[51:55] out
[51:56] I don't know nothing
[51:59] and Lord let me let me die out and
[52:01] humble myself where I really don't know
[52:03] nothing
[52:05] I just know what I was out there in the
[52:07] world I was nothing
[52:08] without him I have nothing I don't have
[52:11] no ability I don't have no capacity but
[52:14] oh with him
[52:16] there's the answer
[52:17] and God takes somebody that don't know
[52:20] nothing in order to work his purpose in
[52:22] their life
[52:23] that's what we get God said to Paul my
[52:25] strength is perfect in your weakness
[52:28] my strength becomes more perfect as you
[52:30] become more weaker
[52:32] more you can yield to me the better I
[52:35] can use you
[52:38] the more you can forget about your
[52:40] education
[52:42] the more you can forget about your
[52:44] denomination the more you can forget
[52:47] about your stuff
[52:49] and yield yourself to me the more I can
[52:53] use you
[52:55] because you become weak I'll make my own
[52:58] purpose
[53:00] strong
[53:01] God can make strength out of weakness
[53:04] that's the reason he always does it
[53:09] there's where the flesh
[53:12] can be weak is in thinking that we've
[53:13] obtained you know they have the old
[53:16] saying you can't teach an old dog new
[53:17] tricks
[53:20] you know you get somebody in work and in
[53:22] business if they've done something a
[53:23] certain way for so long it's really hard
[53:26] to teach them the proper way to do
[53:27] something
[53:28] and if we find ourselves approaching the
[53:31] word of God in a way that we've already
[53:33] obtained in in a way that well I've read
[53:36] this before and I tell you it's so easy
[53:40] for us to to read the Bible or listen to
[53:43] a message and if we're not careful we I
[53:46] don't mean this in a negative way but we
[53:47] kind of do it in the flesh you know we
[53:49] just it's what we do we're Christians
[53:51] we're Believers you know we read our
[53:53] Bible we pray we we listen to the
[53:56] message of the hour but but if you can
[53:58] just slow it down
[53:59] and say you know what Lord now I'm
[54:01] approaching you
[54:03] I I I need to approach you right now
[54:05] Lord and and maybe I only got five
[54:07] minutes maybe I only got 10 minutes Lord
[54:09] but I want it to mean something I want
[54:11] to be in communion with you I I just
[54:13] don't want to listen to this tape uh
[54:15] just to appease uh maybe an a religious
[54:18] uh uh a duty that I have and and so I
[54:22] can feel like I've done my job but oh if
[54:24] I can approach the Living Word if I can
[54:27] approach the word that's a discerner of
[54:29] the thoughts and intents of my heart and
[54:31] I can say Lord speak to my heart today
[54:33] give give me a word give me a message
[54:36] give me something out of this uh this
[54:38] five ten minutes of this sermon Lord
[54:40] when I open up my Bible in the First
[54:42] Corinthians or may there be a something
[54:44] that just opens up to me in such a
[54:47] greater way I want to hear from you
[54:48] today and you get on your knees and it's
[54:51] not just your laundry list of things and
[54:53] and just a routine
[54:56] just a routine vain repetition
[55:01] sometimes I wonder if you recorded your
[55:03] prayer
[55:05] and just listen them to him back
[55:08] you might find out it kind of sounds
[55:10] like vain repetition
[55:12] imagine if you talk to your wife like
[55:14] that or your husband like that like I
[55:16] mean we've had this same conversation
[55:19] like every night honey
[55:21] are we ever going to get past that
[55:24] hey I'm sorry
[55:26] right but we we want it to be living we
[55:30] want it to be moving we want it to be
[55:32] intimate we want it to be breaking we
[55:34] want it to be unfolding we want it to be
[55:36] living we want a living word that's
[55:39] living in an unfolding in our lives
[55:42] because outside of that if we're just
[55:44] comparing what we already know and we're
[55:46] just being intellectual then we're
[55:48] missing it as Paul would say in First
[55:50] Corinthians 2 verse two through five he
[55:53] says for I am determined not to know
[55:55] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[55:57] him crucified
[55:59] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[56:01] and much trembling in my speech and my
[56:03] preaching
[56:04] was not with enticing words of man's
[56:06] Wisdom
[56:07] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[56:10] Power
[56:11] that your faith
[56:13] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[56:17] but in the power of God
[56:21] that's where it is that your faith
[56:23] should not stand in the wisdom of man
[56:26] but it should stand in the power of God
[56:29] look the church is not run by the man's
[56:32] Wisdom the church is not run by man's
[56:36] abilities
[56:38] we want to be free from that that's
[56:40] nicolaidism if we're dependent on the
[56:43] intellect of man and man's abilities to
[56:45] interpret scriptures and all of these
[56:48] things then we're missing something but
[56:50] the individual has to be in a love
[56:52] relationship with Jesus Christ the word
[56:55] in your heart the spirit bringing
[56:57] Revelation to you as the individual
[57:02] now we're talking about the Bride of
[57:04] Jesus Christ in the end time now we're
[57:06] talking about a church that's that's
[57:09] growing into maturity
[57:14] the prophet of God I threw this in there
[57:16] I really like it he says I don't care
[57:18] how intellectual you are we still got
[57:21] Canary brains
[57:22] because we're only human beings
[57:27] anytime you think you're anybody or
[57:30] anytime you think you're something or
[57:32] any time you think it all got you got it
[57:34] all figured out and anytime you think I
[57:36] can just explain this and and just run
[57:38] this all the way down just oh Canary
[57:39] brain
[57:41] Canary brain
[57:45] God is known by the spirit and by the
[57:48] Revelation by the Holy Ghost
[57:51] we will never be able to understand him
[57:53] through intellectual
[57:57] oh I say Lord help me
[57:59] I've I've come to a lot of intellectual
[58:01] conclusions about the message of the
[58:03] hour I've done studies and I've done
[58:06] this and I've listened to that sermon
[58:07] and I feel like I got a pretty good
[58:10] handle of it and I've come to an
[58:12] intellectual conclusion Canary brain
[58:17] but go back to those things and say Lord
[58:19] I'm coming to you again break it to me
[58:21] further Lord I I need Revelation Lord
[58:24] Jesus I really want to I really want
[58:26] something to break to me this time Lord
[58:27] you spoke to me last time I heard this
[58:29] message Lord but speak to me again I
[58:32] really want more of you Lord speak to my
[58:34] heart speak to my life lord it's it's
[58:37] spiritual food and due season it's a
[58:39] storehouse full of the blessings of God
[58:41] Lord let this mind be in me oh God speak
[58:44] to me through your Prophet as I sit down
[58:46] and listen speak to me through your
[58:48] words speak to me through your Bible
[58:49] Lord open up Lord Jesus in prayer
[58:53] all of these things are available it's
[58:55] the inheritance to the believer
[58:58] a prophet would go on to say this in the
[59:00] church age book he says the true
[59:02] Revelation the true Revelation is God
[59:06] interpreting his own word
[59:09] by vindicating what he promised
[59:13] now
[59:16] just
[59:17] let that hold
[59:19] the true revelation
[59:21] is God interpreting God manifesting
[59:25] God interpreting his own word by
[59:27] vindicating
[59:28] what he promised he goes on to say Jesus
[59:31] completely authenticated the Old
[59:33] Testament
[59:35] when he was here on Earth
[59:38] and was comp was compiled exactly as was
[59:42] our new testament make no's mistake
[59:44] about it we have the infallible word of
[59:46] God today and no man dares takes from it
[59:48] or add to it but
[59:51] we need the same spirit that gave it
[59:54] to teach it to us
[59:57] now he says Jesus completely
[59:59] authenticated the Old Testament when
[1:00:01] here on Earth
[1:00:02] that authenticated means to prove to be
[1:00:04] real to be true or to be genuine
[1:00:09] proved to be real proved to be genuine
[1:00:13] now I don't know how to say it any more
[1:00:16] simple than this but just as Jesus
[1:00:19] completely authenticated the Old
[1:00:21] Testament when here on Earth
[1:00:23] by Divine promise according to Malachi 4
[1:00:27] 5 Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7 the
[1:00:32] ministry of William Branham completely
[1:00:34] authenticated the New Testament
[1:00:38] authenticated means to prove Hallelujah
[1:00:41] to prove to be real or Genuine
[1:00:45] it didn't matter how many Devils they
[1:00:47] lined up it didn't matter how much
[1:00:49] sickness it didn't matter how many
[1:00:51] diseases or whatever it was through the
[1:00:54] ministry of William Branham those Devils
[1:00:57] could be cast out they could be defeated
[1:01:00] why because Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:02] yesterday was proving and authenticating
[1:01:06] that he is alive and living amongst his
[1:01:09] church
[1:01:12] it was left to man's ideas it was left
[1:01:15] to man's theologies but God by Divine
[1:01:18] promise
[1:01:20] what did it say the true revelation
[1:01:24] is God interpreting his own word by
[1:01:26] vindicating what he promised
[1:01:30] that's what he did through Malachi 4 5.
[1:01:35] he Vindicated
[1:01:37] what he promised
[1:01:40] and I just want to say this that what
[1:01:42] God did through the prophet
[1:01:45] to the age
[1:01:46] right he traveled around the world
[1:01:48] almost seven times
[1:01:50] uh over 1100 sermons uh
[1:01:54] thousands upon thousands of Discerning
[1:01:57] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:01:59] uh uh uh the blind eyes opened the dead
[1:02:03] raised
[1:02:05] all of these things
[1:02:07] what was it it was God vindicating his
[1:02:10] word god vindicating what is promised
[1:02:12] and he did it to the age
[1:02:14] but I want to say that God is also now
[1:02:17] taking individuals
[1:02:19] and authenticating or vindicating the
[1:02:22] spoken word
[1:02:24] he's taken you he's taking individuals
[1:02:27] now he wants to take your life and your
[1:02:29] situation and your job and your family
[1:02:31] and now the word that has been spoken
[1:02:34] the message of the hour is now coming
[1:02:36] into your skin and into your flesh and
[1:02:38] now you are vindicating what God
[1:02:40] promised in the life that you now live
[1:02:43] what do you say you be then you become a
[1:02:45] written Epistles red of all men
[1:02:48] the word made flesh in you
[1:02:51] I like this quote out of the invisible
[1:02:54] Union the brother Branham says uh he
[1:02:57] says what is it
[1:02:58] he says can't you see where we're
[1:03:00] standing the life is in the grain again
[1:03:02] what is it just exactly like the same
[1:03:06] grain that went in the ground the same
[1:03:08] Jesus in Bride form
[1:03:12] same power
[1:03:14] same church
[1:03:16] same thing same word where
[1:03:19] in you you're the Invincible Army you're
[1:03:22] the one that is now authenticating the
[1:03:24] message because now it's that same
[1:03:26] spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from
[1:03:29] the dead is now quickening your mortal
[1:03:31] body to prove that Jesus Christ was the
[1:03:34] same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:36] staking individuals
[1:03:39] now we just keep working towards a point
[1:03:41] by God's grace we'll get there the
[1:03:43] prophet says now notice God promised in
[1:03:46] his word
[1:03:47] that he would choose his bride by his
[1:03:50] original way he chose the bridegroom
[1:03:55] I like this
[1:03:58] really going to start
[1:04:01] catching what's really taking place
[1:04:05] notice God promised in his word that he
[1:04:07] would choose his bride by the original
[1:04:09] way he chose the bridegroom
[1:04:12] I'm glad I can just keep reading
[1:04:15] he foretold it by the prophets
[1:04:19] and sent a prophet to identify it
[1:04:24] now we're talking about proper
[1:04:25] identification by discernment
[1:04:30] he foretold it by the prophets and sent
[1:04:33] a prophet to identify it and the prophet
[1:04:36] said standing on the banks of Jordan
[1:04:39] Behold the Lamb
[1:04:41] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:04:44] the sin of the world look nobody else
[1:04:47] saw the word coming
[1:04:50] but that was John's job that's why he
[1:04:53] was called he was called to identify the
[1:04:56] word he said there's one that stands
[1:04:58] among you now whose shoes lashes I'm not
[1:05:01] even a worthy but then what happened all
[1:05:04] of a sudden the word what the word came
[1:05:07] to the prophet I don't want to say the
[1:05:09] word identifies the prophet and the
[1:05:11] prophet identifies the word you can't
[1:05:13] separate them it's a perfect match and
[1:05:17] Jesus Christ the word made flesh came to
[1:05:19] the prophet of the age and the prophet
[1:05:22] said Behold the Lamb of God who takes
[1:05:25] away the sins of the world
[1:05:28] that is exactly what has taken place in
[1:05:31] our generation
[1:05:34] he foretold it by the prophets and sent
[1:05:37] a prophet to identify it
[1:05:42] the prophet properly identified the word
[1:05:46] and the word identified the prophet
[1:05:48] searched the scriptures and then you
[1:05:51] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:05:53] they that testify of me don't you
[1:05:55] realize it was the son of man Ministry
[1:05:57] all over again he wasn't quoting a
[1:06:00] scripture from 2000 years ago it was
[1:06:02] none other than the son of man Ministry
[1:06:04] taking on flesh again performing the
[1:06:06] same signs and wonders saying the same
[1:06:09] thing to the Gentiles say search the
[1:06:11] scriptures
[1:06:12] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:06:15] in them you've been blessed with
[1:06:16] speaking in tongues and I've poured out
[1:06:19] my spirit on All Flesh and all of those
[1:06:21] things in them you think you have
[1:06:23] eternal life but that's the very word
[1:06:25] that testifies of who I am
[1:06:28] and what did they do they rejected the
[1:06:30] word
[1:06:35] the word came to the prophet and what
[1:06:38] the word is a discerner
[1:06:42] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:06:45] now
[1:06:46] we'll just walk through this quickly
[1:06:50] but discerner relates to judging
[1:06:53] and when you look into the scripture
[1:06:54] there when it says the word is a
[1:06:56] discerner that word is only used one
[1:06:58] time in scripture but it comes from the
[1:07:00] root word meaning judge
[1:07:04] so we know that Jesus Christ stood there
[1:07:05] and he said look I am the bread that
[1:07:08] cometh down out of heaven
[1:07:10] I am the word made flesh I am the one
[1:07:13] that come down to heaven we know what
[1:07:15] happened in our generation 1961 was it
[1:07:17] was the mighty angel
[1:07:19] it was the bread coming down out it was
[1:07:21] the opening of the word it was the third
[1:07:23] book I'll meet you in there what was it
[1:07:25] it was it was God interpreting his word
[1:07:28] by bringing it to pass it was
[1:07:30] Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty angel
[1:07:33] coming down I am the bread that come
[1:07:36] down out of heaven
[1:07:37] I am the word I am the discerner of the
[1:07:42] thoughts and intents of the art I am the
[1:07:44] discerner I am the judge
[1:07:46] well if you can't see the judge you're
[1:07:48] not looking at it right
[1:07:50] turn it to the right
[1:07:52] what is it it's the Supreme judge what
[1:07:55] it's the quickening power
[1:07:57] it's the Discerning of the thoughts and
[1:07:59] if the word is a discerner don't don't
[1:08:01] limit that to to a prayer line
[1:08:04] my that wasn't if you if you will that
[1:08:07] was uh one part of it
[1:08:11] it was proving that it was the word
[1:08:13] because it could know things that no one
[1:08:15] else would know
[1:08:16] that way you could have comfortable
[1:08:18] Hallelujah that way you knew that when
[1:08:20] it spoke who was speaking
[1:08:25] what way the first and second pull but
[1:08:27] then it was the opener of the word look
[1:08:29] uh in The Believer there's something in
[1:08:31] us we can't deny the first pull we can't
[1:08:33] deny the second Bull oh it speaks to our
[1:08:36] soul but then when we hear the opening
[1:08:38] of the word
[1:08:39] oh you you can't help but be overwhelmed
[1:08:42] with joy because it sounds like home
[1:08:49] but all of these things have been
[1:08:51] thoroughly identified
[1:08:54] right the prophet labored on that he
[1:08:56] said look they took the picture we
[1:08:57] didn't take it
[1:08:59] turn it to right who is it that's our
[1:09:00] Lord up there it's the Supreme judge
[1:09:03] it's been thoroughly identified
[1:09:06] and that's what he says here in the
[1:09:08] rising of the sun he says and there he
[1:09:10] is standing there Supreme judge showing
[1:09:12] that he's Alpha into maker the beginning
[1:09:15] and the end what identification
[1:09:20] I couldn't identify that I'm sorry
[1:09:24] no one could identify except the one
[1:09:27] that was predestinated to be able to
[1:09:29] identify the word coming
[1:09:32] without Malachi 4 5 you cannot identify
[1:09:36] the word
[1:09:37] I'm sorry
[1:09:39] kick me out of the church call me until
[1:09:41] I know I know the pastor gots my back
[1:09:43] without Malachi 45 you cannot identify
[1:09:46] the word because God said I will send
[1:09:50] you Elijah the prophet he will turn the
[1:09:52] heart back to the original faith of the
[1:09:55] Pentecostal fathers what was their faith
[1:09:57] in the revealed word the unadulterated
[1:10:00] word of God that had been stolen from
[1:10:02] the church down Through the Ages but by
[1:10:04] Divine promise God said I'm going to
[1:10:06] send you a prophet and I'm going to come
[1:10:09] again and he will identify my coming
[1:10:12] Hallelujah
[1:10:14] it's been thoroughly identified
[1:10:22] he is the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:10:24] and end what identification quickening
[1:10:26] power did that to us
[1:10:29] quickening power lets us see his coming
[1:10:32] quickening power snatched us from death
[1:10:34] to life
[1:10:37] quickening power gives
[1:10:39] discernment
[1:10:42] to know now don't don't don't let's not
[1:10:45] move too fast to this I want to take my
[1:10:47] time
[1:10:49] quickening power gives discernment
[1:10:52] to know what's wrong with you
[1:10:57] leave this in history Church
[1:11:02] quickening power gives discernment
[1:11:06] to know what's wrong with you
[1:11:09] and what to do you want to know what to
[1:11:11] do
[1:11:15] here it is
[1:11:20] quickening power gives the sermon to
[1:11:22] know what's wrong with you and what to
[1:11:23] do
[1:11:24] what you have done
[1:11:26] and what you ought not to have done
[1:11:29] and what you should have done
[1:11:32] and what you will be
[1:11:35] quickening power all these things
[1:11:39] look that's what this message
[1:11:41] this word has done
[1:11:43] it's discerned your heart
[1:11:47] it's told you who you are
[1:11:50] it told you where you came from
[1:11:54] tells you where you went wrong it tells
[1:11:57] you what you need to make right it tells
[1:12:00] you what you should have done
[1:12:03] I love this but it tells you what you
[1:12:05] are
[1:12:06] it tells you what you will be
[1:12:09] this ain't a hope so message this is a
[1:12:11] reality
[1:12:14] that's what the word has come to do
[1:12:18] is to discern your heart
[1:12:20] to tell you who you are and what you
[1:12:22] need to do and where you came from and
[1:12:24] what you're going to be look the message
[1:12:25] is still alive
[1:12:28] it's still discerning
[1:12:31] and we just
[1:12:32] continue to move as just laying a little
[1:12:34] Foundation there first Corinthians 2 13.
[1:12:38] and 14 it says but the natural man
[1:12:41] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:12:44] of God
[1:12:46] you want to know why you had a little
[1:12:47] hard time struck today well maybe the
[1:12:50] natural man
[1:12:53] the man the natural man has a problem
[1:12:55] with the Christian Life
[1:12:59] as a problem with putting others before
[1:13:01] yourself
[1:13:03] the natural man has a problem with you
[1:13:05] humbling yourself and and always taking
[1:13:08] the back seat the natural man receiveth
[1:13:10] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:13:12] they are foolishness unto him
[1:13:15] why that is so foolish
[1:13:18] that you would make less money to be in
[1:13:20] church on Sunday why would you ever
[1:13:22] that's so foolish
[1:13:25] but we got two services on Sunday and I
[1:13:27] can make this work
[1:13:30] some people can live by that I I'm I'm
[1:13:32] not
[1:13:34] I'm just
[1:13:36] too
[1:13:37] ignorant to figure anything else out I
[1:13:40] just know that the word is right and if
[1:13:42] I can just stay with that I'm gonna be
[1:13:43] all right
[1:13:45] I mean
[1:13:46] I just know I'll be okay right there
[1:13:50] if I can just stay right there
[1:13:52] as soon as I start trying to figure it
[1:13:55] out and and try to say well yeah I could
[1:13:57] do that and then if I just came on that
[1:13:59] day and this day oh and now I'm just
[1:14:01] messing everything up
[1:14:03] because I tell you if you just stay with
[1:14:04] God's word he'll take care of you
[1:14:07] they are foolishness unto him and
[1:14:09] neither can they know them because they
[1:14:11] are spiritually discerned
[1:14:13] how we we've been dealing with
[1:14:15] discernment
[1:14:17] discern means to investigate
[1:14:19] to examine to inquire into
[1:14:23] you know sometimes you witness to people
[1:14:25] about the message
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:28] sometimes you know you you tell somebody
[1:14:30] you know tell them about serpency
[1:14:31] they're like yeah
[1:14:33] like all right all right oh man tell
[1:14:35] them about godhead tell them about water
[1:14:36] baptism man okay
[1:14:38] I mean he's taking it all in you keep
[1:14:41] running down the line like I'll tell you
[1:14:42] what happened in 19 yeah yeah and Olson
[1:14:44] you're like wait a second here
[1:14:46] he's just good with everything
[1:14:48] yeah yeah yeah that's great yeah yeah
[1:14:51] yeah I'm like you you want somebody to
[1:14:53] like to seem like they're like gonna
[1:14:55] investigate or like scrutinize or really
[1:14:57] examine it or take it back to the word
[1:14:58] like did he really say that
[1:15:01] some people are just whatever you tell
[1:15:02] them I'm good with it I'm good with it
[1:15:03] oh really I really really really oh okay
[1:15:06] is that what the prophet said okay
[1:15:10] that's not it Church
[1:15:13] how much second-hand Revelation do you
[1:15:15] want
[1:15:18] you know church we got to grow up
[1:15:21] that when somebody wants to sit down and
[1:15:24] talk to you about Doctrine or the Seven
[1:15:26] Seals or or talk to you about water
[1:15:27] baptism
[1:15:29] you can do that
[1:15:31] you got this
[1:15:33] you're the word made flesh
[1:15:36] don't don't start don't start like oh I
[1:15:38] got a call I got to call brother so and
[1:15:40] so I gotta call sister so and so
[1:15:42] and if and if you do need to do that let
[1:15:45] us let something in your heart you say
[1:15:47] you know what Lord
[1:15:49] let me be a student of Thy word let me
[1:15:51] study to show myself approved and if
[1:15:53] anything just tell them how your candle
[1:15:55] got lit and if your candle ain't been
[1:15:57] lit let's get desperate for a candle
[1:15:59] lighting and not some Catholic thing out
[1:16:01] there
[1:16:04] we don't want that
[1:16:08] we want the real fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:10] to change you
[1:16:13] to investigate
[1:16:15] to examine to inquire
[1:16:18] to question
[1:16:21] it's okay to have questions you know
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:24] that's exactly
[1:16:26] what happened to the Queen of Sheba
[1:16:29] she heard of the fame of Solomon
[1:16:32] she heard she heard of the wisdom of
[1:16:35] Solomon and there was like a deep
[1:16:36] calling to a deep
[1:16:38] and something inside her said oh could
[1:16:40] could this be true and what did the
[1:16:43] Queen of Sheba do
[1:16:45] she investigated
[1:16:47] some people won't cross the street to
[1:16:49] going to church
[1:16:52] some people won't make the effort
[1:16:55] but look at the Queen of Sheba
[1:16:58] she made that I don't know I think if
[1:17:00] you look at me I don't know six months
[1:17:02] or two years I mean it was a journey
[1:17:04] but something in her heart said I am
[1:17:06] going to investigate
[1:17:09] I am going to discern for myself I'm
[1:17:11] going to show up there and I'm going to
[1:17:14] see if what I heard is true and the
[1:17:16] scripture would say in second chronicles
[1:17:18] 9 1 it was saying when the Queen of
[1:17:20] Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
[1:17:23] now this is for this isn't just some
[1:17:25] random thing
[1:17:27] well I'm I'm trying to encourage you to
[1:17:29] how we should be approaching the word of
[1:17:31] God and how we should be inquiring of
[1:17:34] the message of the hour and how we
[1:17:36] should be crying out for Revelation and
[1:17:38] how we should be investigating the
[1:17:40] scriptures and we should be crying out
[1:17:41] for Revelation more than anything before
[1:17:43] that the Holy Ghost could so set you on
[1:17:46] fire and so illuminate your heart that
[1:17:49] that word would be a discerner of what
[1:17:51] is right and what's wrong that would be
[1:17:53] leading you and guiding you in all truth
[1:17:55] and all righteousness that you would be
[1:17:58] able by the word to discern
[1:18:03] and the Queen of Sheba heard of the
[1:18:05] famous Solomon
[1:18:06] and she came to prove Solomon with hard
[1:18:09] questions
[1:18:10] at Jerusalem
[1:18:14] have you ever proved the word of God
[1:18:17] with hard questions
[1:18:20] hey some of us come from some hard
[1:18:22] situations
[1:18:24] some of us need
[1:18:26] uh
[1:18:27] some really big answers
[1:18:29] but there's no question too hard for God
[1:18:32] there's no situation too hard for God if
[1:18:35] there's a word question there's a word
[1:18:37] answer
[1:18:39] but are you willing to come and inquire
[1:18:42] are you willing to investigate are you
[1:18:44] willing to lay on your face before the
[1:18:45] Lord and are you willing to prove this
[1:18:48] message with hard questions
[1:18:50] or do we accept an intellectual
[1:18:53] interpretation
[1:18:57] we accept all the buzzwords
[1:19:00] as the vindication
[1:19:03] that we got revelation
[1:19:08] you know I I haven't been doing it
[1:19:12] as long as some
[1:19:13] but by God's race going on 24 years of
[1:19:16] serving the lord
[1:19:17] the more you serve them the more you
[1:19:19] realize you don't know
[1:19:21] and you feel ashamed you feel little
[1:19:24] you look into the word and things that
[1:19:26] you I should have known that already
[1:19:27] Lord
[1:19:29] forgive me Lord I I thought I had that
[1:19:32] done I thought I understood it but
[1:19:34] but you you don't ever figure out God
[1:19:37] we can never get to a place where we're
[1:19:40] thinking like that we got to be in a
[1:19:42] love relationship with him where his
[1:19:44] word is leading us and unfolding us and
[1:19:46] and whatever Revelation he gives us it's
[1:19:49] there that we can help somebody else
[1:19:51] it's not there to lift ourselves up or
[1:19:54] to think we're somebody but it's for us
[1:19:56] to be the vehicle that God can use to
[1:19:58] help somebody else
[1:20:00] God's revealing himself to you and your
[1:20:02] person that you can be a a a light
[1:20:06] set on a hill not hidden under a bushel
[1:20:08] basket
[1:20:09] so let your light shine amongst men
[1:20:12] and I love the end of the Scripture it
[1:20:14] says she communed with him all
[1:20:16] that was in her heart
[1:20:20] prophet of God would say this in
[1:20:22] Ministry explained in 56 he says how do
[1:20:24] you know taste and see
[1:20:27] give God a chance
[1:20:28] see if he will take it and give you
[1:20:31] glory for your misery
[1:20:33] see if he will give you happiness for
[1:20:35] your Gloom see if he will give you
[1:20:37] health for your sickness see if he will
[1:20:39] give you the Holy Ghost for your
[1:20:41] theology try and see taste and see that
[1:20:45] the Lord is good let's give him a chance
[1:20:48] and the queen said I'll go see for
[1:20:51] myself now I want you to notice what a
[1:20:54] sacrifice
[1:20:56] when you come to see God you don't just
[1:20:59] come on a flower bed of these you have
[1:21:03] to make a sacrifice
[1:21:04] it's a sacrificial way
[1:21:08] it's a way of death you have to die out
[1:21:12] to come to him and you have to forget
[1:21:15] all you ever knowed in order to learn of
[1:21:18] him
[1:21:19] empty out that he can feel us
[1:21:23] you don't mix it now you have to empty
[1:21:26] out
[1:21:27] what did Paul say the natural man
[1:21:28] receiveth not the things
[1:21:31] of the spirit of God because they are
[1:21:33] spiritually discerned
[1:21:35] we have to empty out
[1:21:37] we got to die
[1:21:39] I know we want to move we're going to
[1:21:41] move
[1:21:42] we really want to get down to good old
[1:21:44] fashioned everyday living
[1:21:48] the words applicable in your daily lives
[1:21:51] it has to be a reality
[1:21:55] oh we're not a kajal club we're not some
[1:21:57] uh book club and some religion and and
[1:22:00] we all got the same ideas and we got
[1:22:02] some headquarters somewhere our our
[1:22:05] headquarters is the kingdom of God
[1:22:08] we've received a message of God
[1:22:11] that's introduced us to Jesus Christ and
[1:22:13] we're walking with him
[1:22:16] so we're familiar with this scripture
[1:22:18] right so we're going to try to come back
[1:22:19] to how we open the Service here
[1:22:21] you know the prophet said the bride has
[1:22:24] the mind of Christ for she knows what he
[1:22:26] wants done with the word
[1:22:27] she performs it
[1:22:29] at the command of his word in his name
[1:22:31] for she has thus saith the Lord then the
[1:22:34] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[1:22:35] comes to pass
[1:22:37] well that's a big statement that's a big
[1:22:39] mouthful
[1:22:40] but you see that's the hour that we're
[1:22:42] living in we're living in the hour of
[1:22:43] adoption the hour of the maturity of the
[1:22:46] seed
[1:22:48] but what is that well what does that
[1:22:50] mean to me brother Matthew
[1:22:51] try to make it in a simple way here
[1:22:54] the prophet of God says you see God
[1:22:57] don't make all of our decisions
[1:22:59] there's many times that God doesn't tell
[1:23:01] His prophets just what to do
[1:23:03] because they have to make the decision
[1:23:06] if there is no decision that we have to
[1:23:09] make just wait every move on God then
[1:23:12] there is no overcoming on our part
[1:23:15] so we're talking about being mature
[1:23:17] Christians
[1:23:20] look look brother Brandon when he was
[1:23:21] sitting there and he said there's a trap
[1:23:23] set for you
[1:23:25] and he and he was there preaching and
[1:23:27] that couple was doing those lewd acts in
[1:23:28] front of him he had to make a decision
[1:23:32] he had to make the decision
[1:23:36] God didn't make it whatever you say
[1:23:40] he he had to make the decision
[1:23:43] but oh I tell you that couple
[1:23:47] they're they're lucky they're fortunate
[1:23:52] that God's a god of love
[1:23:54] a god of forgiveness
[1:23:58] and what is an adopted son
[1:24:01] it's somebody whose name is just as good
[1:24:03] on the check
[1:24:05] as the father
[1:24:07] and in that moment the decision
[1:24:10] that the prophet made I believe was the
[1:24:12] exact decision
[1:24:14] that the Lord wanted him to make
[1:24:18] so we have to make decisions but if
[1:24:20] there is no decisions
[1:24:22] there's no overcoming what does it say
[1:24:25] in Revelations 3 21 to them that
[1:24:27] overcome will I grant to sit with me and
[1:24:29] my throat you I if there's no decisions
[1:24:31] you got to make there's no overcoming
[1:24:33] we've got to overcome something we got
[1:24:35] to make decisions
[1:24:37] there's no decisions we have to make
[1:24:39] there's no overcoming on our part
[1:24:43] so I say what is your choice tonight
[1:24:44] what do you choose
[1:24:46] what are you choosing what did you
[1:24:48] choose today what are you going to
[1:24:50] choose tomorrow I choose Christ I choose
[1:24:54] this message I choose life
[1:24:56] I choose let this mind be in you that
[1:24:59] was also in Christ's I choose to die out
[1:25:01] to all of my ideas I choose to listen to
[1:25:04] the message of the hour I choose to
[1:25:07] rebuke the devil I rebuke the flesh I
[1:25:09] rebuke all this demonology out there I I
[1:25:12] choose to become subject to the word
[1:25:15] that's my choice
[1:25:22] the devil tells you you ain't gonna make
[1:25:23] it
[1:25:26] tells you you're gonna you're gonna give
[1:25:28] up you you can never manifest
[1:25:30] this message it's not for you it was for
[1:25:33] your mommy and daddy but you're really
[1:25:34] never going to catch anything about it I
[1:25:36] want to ask you what do you choose
[1:25:39] you don't listen to that old liar
[1:25:42] I say I choose to tell that Old Devil to
[1:25:45] shut up
[1:25:46] that's exactly what the prophet said
[1:25:48] tell that he'll be able to shut up go
[1:25:50] sit in a corner devil I am the Bride of
[1:25:53] Jesus Christ I choose life I choose this
[1:25:56] message I choose to manifest everything
[1:25:58] the prophet spoke of the pride of Jesus
[1:26:01] Christ that's why I'm here that is my
[1:26:04] choice
[1:26:08] so now we got a good foundation to move
[1:26:11] forward
[1:26:12] he is the word of God
[1:26:15] he is the quickening power this is out
[1:26:17] of proving his word he is the Holy
[1:26:20] Spirit
[1:26:21] the Dynamics that comes into the
[1:26:24] mechanics the words that make it live
[1:26:27] and it all has to work together
[1:26:31] we don't want to just a knowledge of the
[1:26:33] word
[1:26:34] we want a revelation of the word
[1:26:37] and then when the Dynamics comes to the
[1:26:39] mechanics which the mechanic says the
[1:26:41] word which you are
[1:26:43] just you being here you're a
[1:26:45] predestinated seed word that was placed
[1:26:47] here in this age the mechanics of it
[1:26:51] the letter of this Bible is the
[1:26:52] mechanics of it
[1:26:54] the spoken word without the life
[1:26:57] of the message is the mechanics of it
[1:26:59] the body of Jesus Christ which was the
[1:27:02] word made flesh laying in the Tomb
[1:27:03] without the spirit was the mechanics of
[1:27:05] it
[1:27:08] but the quickening power has to come to
[1:27:11] the word to make it live oh I said oh
[1:27:14] God I want the quickening power to give
[1:27:17] me the discernment to make this message
[1:27:19] live and by God's spirit discern and we
[1:27:22] span this two Spirits within the
[1:27:24] framework of the church and then we'll
[1:27:26] be an invincible Army
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:31] so as we're just moving along these
[1:27:33] lines we won't hold you too much longer
[1:27:36] we're talking about discernment and
[1:27:38] proper identification by revelation of
[1:27:40] the word
[1:27:42] and God deals with individuals the same
[1:27:46] way he deals with the church
[1:27:48] so when the prophet would say this and
[1:27:49] see does not air with a shock you'd say
[1:27:51] notice see how close it looks Matthew
[1:27:54] said in Saint Matthew 24 said that the
[1:27:57] two spirits in the last days the church
[1:27:59] Spirit of the church people
[1:28:02] and the bride Spirit of the Bride people
[1:28:05] would be so close together till it would
[1:28:07] deceive the very elect if possible
[1:28:09] that's how close
[1:28:13] the church Spirit of the church people
[1:28:17] you want to know what a church spirit
[1:28:19] will make you do
[1:28:22] go to church
[1:28:27] pretty good huh
[1:28:30] Church Spirit take you to camps and
[1:28:32] meetings
[1:28:33] Church spirit will rejoice in
[1:28:35] manifestations of the spirits and gifts
[1:28:37] and operations a church spirit will do
[1:28:40] that
[1:28:42] a church spirit will rejoice in
[1:28:44] knowledge and intellectuals and bible
[1:28:45] studies and Men's breakfast and services
[1:28:48] a church spirit and a church people is a
[1:28:51] very religious spirit the washing of
[1:28:55] pots and pans and and all of the dress
[1:28:58] and everything and look at me I'm a
[1:29:00] church Spirit Church person go and
[1:29:03] church person people
[1:29:05] guy
[1:29:09] but when it comes to the word
[1:29:12] not just a portion of the word
[1:29:15] but when it comes to the fullness of the
[1:29:18] word
[1:29:20] it compromises every time
[1:29:26] the prophet of God said oh yes this
[1:29:28] false spirit
[1:29:30] that is in the last day is so close to
[1:29:32] the real
[1:29:34] can be distinguished only by its
[1:29:38] deviation from the word
[1:29:41] you gotta watch the word
[1:29:45] and whenever it is caught being
[1:29:47] anti-word
[1:29:50] it falls back on the argument we have
[1:29:54] already shown to be false I am so glad
[1:29:56] the word is a discerner
[1:29:59] without Malachi 4 5 we are lost
[1:30:06] let me rephrase that without Malachi 4 5
[1:30:08] I know I'm lost
[1:30:10] I didn't have the ability I didn't have
[1:30:12] the capacity I didn't have the
[1:30:14] discernment I didn't have the right
[1:30:15] spirit I didn't have the right theology
[1:30:17] I didn't have any ability I had to hear
[1:30:21] a message
[1:30:25] because only the word which is a
[1:30:28] discerner
[1:30:31] would discern these things for the bride
[1:30:35] can only be distinguished by its
[1:30:37] deviation from the word and whenever it
[1:30:40] is caught being anti-word it always
[1:30:42] falls back on the one argument we have
[1:30:44] already shown to be false we get results
[1:30:46] don't we
[1:30:48] we have to be of God
[1:30:52] now I'm trying to move towards something
[1:30:55] Spirits do not die
[1:30:58] now now yes Matthew 24 24 and and the
[1:31:02] two Spirits within the framework of the
[1:31:04] church it would be so closely would
[1:31:05] deceive the very elected possible that
[1:31:07] was manifested in the shock
[1:31:10] that was manifested in what brother
[1:31:12] Brandon would call the Pentecostal age
[1:31:13] or the third stage of the wheat plant or
[1:31:16] the restoration of the gifts
[1:31:17] justification sanctification restoration
[1:31:19] of the gifts the third stage of the weed
[1:31:21] plant right the shock what he would call
[1:31:23] the age of Pentecost it was a mixture
[1:31:26] of wrong seed and right seed it was Joel
[1:31:29] 2 28. I pour out my spirit upon All
[1:31:32] Flesh
[1:31:33] right the rain falls on the just and
[1:31:37] so is the rain the problem
[1:31:40] no the rain is not the problem God pours
[1:31:43] out a spirit upon the just and the
[1:31:46] unjust the difference is the seed
[1:31:49] but now we're dealing with the
[1:31:51] dispensation or an age the shock has
[1:31:53] died the shock is gone it's done dried
[1:31:57] up the Pentecostal age is long gone dead
[1:32:00] bury it
[1:32:03] but now the prophet will deal with with
[1:32:05] an age but God deals with the individual
[1:32:09] the same way he deals with the church
[1:32:11] Spirits don't die
[1:32:13] so we have the same Spirit the same
[1:32:16] church people Church spirit
[1:32:19] that same Antichrist Spirit the same
[1:32:22] shock in our own life that we got to
[1:32:25] pull away from being intellectual and
[1:32:28] thinking we got it all figured out we
[1:32:31] gotta die to that thing
[1:32:33] because as soon as you start feeling
[1:32:36] pretty good we fall back on well I get
[1:32:40] results don't I I gave my heart to the
[1:32:42] Lord I had a really good time well I
[1:32:45] went down to the altar that one time if
[1:32:47] you're not careful you start to justify
[1:32:50] your condition by previous experiences
[1:32:53] but I want to be walking with my Lord
[1:32:55] and Savior if the minister preaches the
[1:32:58] word and it convicts me in my heart I
[1:33:00] say amen I Repent Lord forgive me I want
[1:33:04] to be right I'm going to go lay my life
[1:33:06] down at the altar I'm going to
[1:33:07] rededicate my life to the Lord give me
[1:33:10] the Holy Ghost Lord give me discernment
[1:33:15] but we're so quick to Puff ourselves up
[1:33:17] well you know
[1:33:18] I've been doing pretty good for 24 years
[1:33:23] haven't missed a service
[1:33:26] that's that's that's church people
[1:33:28] Church Spirit stuff
[1:33:30] that's the same spirit
[1:33:32] we get results that showed up on that
[1:33:35] day
[1:33:36] have I not cashed out devils in thine
[1:33:38] have I not done Benny gray works we get
[1:33:42] results don't we
[1:33:45] have you not seen our meetings have you
[1:33:47] not seen our numbers have you not seen
[1:33:49] all these wonderful things that we've
[1:33:51] done depart from me you doers of
[1:33:53] iniquity I never knew you
[1:33:59] the difference is the elect seed
[1:34:02] will respond to the word
[1:34:06] they will not be satisfied with anything
[1:34:09] less than the word
[1:34:11] the pure unadulterated word I want to
[1:34:15] say that anything less than that is
[1:34:17] Pentecostal bait
[1:34:19] huh
[1:34:21] anything less than the full revelation
[1:34:25] of this message
[1:34:27] it's just Pentecostal bait
[1:34:31] it's a deviation from the word it's
[1:34:33] flashes and signs and and programs and
[1:34:36] organizations and emotions and feelings
[1:34:39] and we get results don't we but I want
[1:34:41] to be living in the Shekinah Glory I
[1:34:43] want to be shut away I'll meet you in
[1:34:46] there in the third pool where I'm eating
[1:34:48] the showbread I'm in the Shekinah Glory
[1:34:51] I'm eating the hidden manna
[1:34:54] nothing can get to you in there
[1:34:58] first John 4 1 says beloved believe not
[1:35:01] every Spirit but try the spirits
[1:35:04] whether they are of God
[1:35:07] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:35:09] into the world
[1:35:11] so we got to give it the word test
[1:35:14] the word identifies the seed
[1:35:18] has to be word coming to word you know
[1:35:19] like the magnet the great magnet
[1:35:22] give something the word test
[1:35:24] see if it fits
[1:35:27] when you hear the message you hear truth
[1:35:29] something in your heart you just it just
[1:35:31] does something for you
[1:35:33] that great magnet that great Eagle
[1:35:35] scream
[1:35:36] that that word's pulling you to
[1:35:38] Perfection it's pulling you to maturity
[1:35:40] it's pulling you it gots a hold of you
[1:35:43] and it's not going to let you go until
[1:35:44] you get to the end goal
[1:35:48] Prophet says this in discernment of
[1:35:50] spirit now we see all those prophets
[1:35:52] speaking
[1:35:54] every one of them was glorifying God in
[1:35:57] the coming Messiah
[1:35:59] would just be about 10 minutes and we'll
[1:36:01] come to a close
[1:36:04] now see all those prophets speaking
[1:36:06] every one of them was glorifying God and
[1:36:09] the coming Messiah
[1:36:11] and when they got in the spirit
[1:36:13] they acted and spoke and lived the life
[1:36:17] out just like the Messiah did
[1:36:20] if it did that
[1:36:22] that side of the cross
[1:36:25] speaking of his coming
[1:36:27] how much more will it after is coming
[1:36:30] we'll put the spirit of the Messiah in
[1:36:32] the church to act do work and live like
[1:36:37] the Messiah
[1:36:39] it's the spirit of God discern that
[1:36:42] Spirit see whether it is of god or not
[1:36:45] see whether it acts like him see if your
[1:36:48] emotions now watch
[1:36:52] catch this now you got to discern your
[1:36:54] own emotions
[1:36:56] you got to discern what spirit is
[1:36:58] working on your flesh that's working on
[1:37:00] your mind that's making you feel the way
[1:37:03] that you feel
[1:37:04] see if your emotions if somebody kicks
[1:37:07] up something against you and throws dirt
[1:37:08] upon your life
[1:37:10] when you know you're as innocent
[1:37:13] as you can be
[1:37:16] so now we're now we're getting down to
[1:37:18] where
[1:37:20] we're living
[1:37:22] we all want to go do some big great work
[1:37:24] and empty out a hospital
[1:37:26] but we don't want to turn our cheek
[1:37:30] we don't want to just be a Christian
[1:37:34] we don't want to just be the word made
[1:37:35] flesh
[1:37:41] when you know your innocent as can be
[1:37:42] and you know that you've got the spirit
[1:37:44] of God don't try to separate yourself
[1:37:46] don't try to act mean
[1:37:48] towards them don't curse them just walk
[1:37:50] on knowing
[1:37:52] that God did that to give you a test to
[1:37:54] see how you would take it
[1:37:56] now you know something struck my heart
[1:37:58] the other day
[1:38:00] and I didn't realize what some of our
[1:38:03] young people go through and the Lord
[1:38:05] just gave me a little Glimpse but you
[1:38:07] know when you're when you're in school
[1:38:08] and people
[1:38:10] talk bad about you or
[1:38:12] you know or or people treat you mean
[1:38:14] that's hurtful
[1:38:17] it can have a profound effect on
[1:38:18] somebody's Psyche on their self-esteem
[1:38:23] and and I was thinking about that and
[1:38:25] then I realized that our children are
[1:38:28] going through things that I never
[1:38:30] experienced
[1:38:31] because the very our the very ones that
[1:38:34] are supposed to be our brothers and
[1:38:36] sisters of the household of faith
[1:38:39] are the ones that are are forming clicks
[1:38:42] and being mean and talking bad about the
[1:38:44] other one and and I didn't I can't
[1:38:46] comprehend the because I never went
[1:38:48] through that the very ones were supposed
[1:38:50] to be in Fellowship the very ones that
[1:38:52] are supposed to be our brothers and
[1:38:53] sisters the very ones that are supposed
[1:38:54] to Bear our burdens the very we we have
[1:38:56] young uh uh children uh uh eight nine
[1:39:00] ten eleven twelve Thirty that want to
[1:39:02] serve God with all of their heart
[1:39:05] and I want to tell you God bless you for
[1:39:07] that and you having the holy ghost or
[1:39:09] believing for the Holy Ghost you're
[1:39:11] going you're going to battle things
[1:39:13] where you're living
[1:39:15] you're not out in the workplace maybe
[1:39:17] you're not in a public school maybe
[1:39:19] you're not doing all those things but if
[1:39:20] you want the Holy Ghost to have true
[1:39:22] reign in your life be nice to your
[1:39:24] brothers and sisters be inclusive to
[1:39:26] them Fellowship around the world ask
[1:39:29] them what you can do for them invite
[1:39:31] them over look for that one that's
[1:39:32] always left on the outside I said oh God
[1:39:35] my heart started to hurt I thought I
[1:39:37] never went through that the very ones
[1:39:39] that are supposed to be called The Bride
[1:39:41] of Jesus Christ are cutting this one out
[1:39:43] and cutting that one out but I believe
[1:39:45] it's time it's maturing time it's even
[1:39:48] maturing time for our eight-year-olds
[1:39:50] and our nine-year-olds and our ten years
[1:39:52] to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:39:54] help you live where you're living
[1:39:58] if you only knew children how much you
[1:40:02] could set your own house on fire
[1:40:06] your Mom and Dad is working and
[1:40:08] struggling and fighting all these
[1:40:10] Spirits every day and doing their best
[1:40:12] to apply the token if you could just
[1:40:14] come in there with your Bibles hell Mama
[1:40:16] listen to this I really like this
[1:40:18] scripture oh if you only knew what that
[1:40:20] would do it would change the atmosphere
[1:40:22] it would change the situation
[1:40:26] we gotta be a body we got to be a group
[1:40:31] we got a discern spirits
[1:40:37] sometimes something comes your way and
[1:40:39] it's a test
[1:40:41] quickening power gives discernment
[1:40:45] here here David's going along a rejected
[1:40:48] King
[1:40:49] and that guy comes over and spits on
[1:40:51] David
[1:40:52] I think it's abishai says who is this
[1:40:55] dog
[1:40:56] gonna spit on my king I'm going to take
[1:41:00] his head off
[1:41:02] was right
[1:41:04] if you don't I'll do it first
[1:41:07] but see he was void David was anointed
[1:41:12] the spirit of Christ was upon David he
[1:41:14] said leave him alone
[1:41:15] because it was the word it was the
[1:41:18] spirit of discernment and that's what
[1:41:20] I'm moving towards is that that spirit
[1:41:23] that life would be moving in an action
[1:41:28] so I'm closing along these lines right
[1:41:30] here
[1:41:31] because I believe
[1:41:33] we can be
[1:41:35] uh being students of the Bible and the
[1:41:37] message
[1:41:39] and having Revelation and understanding
[1:41:42] about what the prophet is speaking of
[1:41:43] when we read this a revelation of the
[1:41:45] true church and what she is and what she
[1:41:48] stands for is that she can't do the
[1:41:49] great he works that she will be an
[1:41:52] invincible Army
[1:41:53] they did a true revelation of the two
[1:41:55] spirits
[1:41:56] and by God's spirit discern or withstand
[1:41:58] all of these things and and the
[1:42:00] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:42:02] powerless before her
[1:42:04] now I want to deal with this and just
[1:42:06] end on this note
[1:42:09] she will be an invincible Army
[1:42:14] if we're not careful we get a
[1:42:16] denominational idea
[1:42:18] just like the coming of the Lord
[1:42:21] we have an expectation a denominational
[1:42:24] way of thinking of how that's to be
[1:42:26] manifested if you want to know how that
[1:42:29] was to be manifested study the life of
[1:42:31] William Branham because it was the word
[1:42:33] right authenticating the New Testament
[1:42:35] it was the word made flesh and our
[1:42:36] generation making the Bible live
[1:42:40] God living out what he spoke through the
[1:42:42] prophet in his life
[1:42:45] the problem wasn't free from mistake he
[1:42:46] was a brother just like us but God was
[1:42:48] tutoring and training him
[1:42:49] bringing them to a place of maturity
[1:42:51] that he would be a Sheaf wave to a
[1:42:53] generation a first one to maturity
[1:42:57] but we've got so locked in on a
[1:43:00] denominational way of thinking of what
[1:43:02] it means to be an invincible Army
[1:43:04] and then the devil will take a
[1:43:07] denominational interpretation of that
[1:43:09] and make you think you're falling short
[1:43:13] now listen
[1:43:15] Invincible what's the definition of
[1:43:17] invincible
[1:43:20] Hallelujah Advanced only means incapable
[1:43:24] of being conquered
[1:43:27] now I want to say Jesus Christ
[1:43:30] what's the mighty conqueror
[1:43:35] but Jesus Christ was not the mighty
[1:43:38] conqueror because of only of what he did
[1:43:41] he opened the blind eyes he raised the
[1:43:44] dead he healed the sick he did all of
[1:43:47] those things
[1:43:48] but that's not the only thing that made
[1:43:50] him invincible
[1:43:52] that's not the only thing that made him
[1:43:54] the mighty conqueror what made him the
[1:43:56] mighty conqueror is also what he didn't
[1:43:58] do
[1:44:02] he was invincible because of what he
[1:44:04] didn't do
[1:44:08] that he was able to conquer his emotions
[1:44:11] he was able to conquer the pain
[1:44:14] he was able to conquer death
[1:44:19] think about it now he's hanging there on
[1:44:21] the cross
[1:44:22] oh my
[1:44:24] he's hanging there on the cross and they
[1:44:26] came there and they started wagging
[1:44:27] their heads at him
[1:44:29] yeah look at you
[1:44:31] you're the one that said I'll tear down
[1:44:34] this Temple and I'll Build It Up in
[1:44:36] three days
[1:44:40] why don't you come down off the cross
[1:44:43] others you saved
[1:44:46] but you yourself you can't save
[1:44:49] the prophet of God said that was the
[1:44:51] greatest compliment they could ever pay
[1:44:54] him
[1:44:56] he could have done it
[1:44:58] Ten Thousand Angels say the word my Lord
[1:45:02] say the word he could have come off that
[1:45:05] cross he didn't have to do it
[1:45:10] he made the decision
[1:45:12] oh thank you Lord thank you Lord
[1:45:16] and as he hung there
[1:45:18] what was represented to his left and his
[1:45:20] right
[1:45:22] he had an unbeliever on his left and a
[1:45:24] Believer on his right
[1:45:29] and I could just see him saying
[1:45:31] yeah
[1:45:32] I could come down
[1:45:35] but I'm not going
[1:45:38] because I got one hanging next to me
[1:45:42] I said Lord
[1:45:45] when you enter into your kingdom
[1:45:46] remember me
[1:45:49] see there's a fourth tree that day where
[1:45:52] Judas was hanging
[1:45:54] to take that scoffer and that other
[1:45:56] believer to hell
[1:45:58] but it was because of what Jesus Christ
[1:46:01] didn't do
[1:46:03] he didn't come off the cross he didn't
[1:46:06] give in to his emotions
[1:46:08] he didn't give in to the pain and the
[1:46:10] agony why because he was invincible he
[1:46:13] conquered his flesh
[1:46:18] it wasn't just only what he did
[1:46:22] it was because of what he didn't do
[1:46:27] Church stop
[1:46:30] looking at some big fantastic out there
[1:46:35] the fact that you're not giving in to
[1:46:38] Lady osia Hallelujah the fact that
[1:46:41] you're not giving in to the spirits the
[1:46:43] Antichrist Spirits working against the
[1:46:45] church the fact that you sisters are
[1:46:47] dressing holy and wearing your hair long
[1:46:49] and being a testimony the fact that you
[1:46:52] young Brothers aren't looking at all
[1:46:53] that uh fashion in them sexy dressed
[1:46:56] girls out there the things you're not
[1:46:58] doing you want to see an invincible Army
[1:47:01] it's the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:47:03] stops doing those things and running
[1:47:05] after all of those things the devil has
[1:47:07] out there to offer and stop running
[1:47:09] after those things and lay in the
[1:47:11] presence of the sun to bake all the
[1:47:13] greenness out of you
[1:47:15] it's not so much the things that you
[1:47:17] have to do but it's also the things that
[1:47:19] you're not doing that makes you
[1:47:20] invincible if the musicians would come
[1:47:27] that's discerning
[1:47:33] everyday Living Church
[1:47:37] the way you talk to your wife
[1:47:39] the way you conduct yourself at work the
[1:47:42] way you respond a reaction to an action
[1:47:45] the things you don't do in response
[1:47:47] waiting upon the Lord waiting on your
[1:47:49] ministry not running out somewhere not
[1:47:51] running after something
[1:47:54] it's the things you don't do that also
[1:47:57] make you an invincible Army
[1:48:07] Jesus Christ he was invincible
[1:48:13] he was the chief wave
[1:48:17] what is the sheath wave
[1:48:20] it's the first one to maturity
[1:48:25] he was invincible because of things he
[1:48:27] didn't do
[1:48:29] say brother Matthew what does that have
[1:48:31] to do with me
[1:48:33] well I'll tell you
[1:48:35] I tell you something you haven't done
[1:48:37] you haven't given up
[1:48:41] you could have given up a long time ago
[1:48:45] you could have thrown in the towel a
[1:48:47] long time ago
[1:48:48] with a heartache and the hurt and the
[1:48:50] trials that you went through you could
[1:48:52] have given up
[1:48:53] but what was it there was something
[1:48:55] inside of you a seed of God that's
[1:48:58] invincible
[1:48:59] it can't give up
[1:49:02] even when you give up you can't even sin
[1:49:04] because the seed of God remadeth in you
[1:49:08] what are you saying brother Matthew I'm
[1:49:10] saying you predestinated
[1:49:14] The Same Spirit
[1:49:16] that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[1:49:18] dead
[1:49:20] the prophet of God said we are part of
[1:49:22] God
[1:49:23] The Offspring of God
[1:49:26] and he's the only Eternal thing there is
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:30] you can no more die than God can die
[1:49:34] because you're Eternal with him
[1:49:38] Let It Come Hallelujah
[1:49:40] I'm kind of getting tired of this old
[1:49:42] pest house anyways
[1:49:46] if that same spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:49:52] it will also Quicken your mortal body
[1:49:55] you are
[1:49:57] the Invincible Army
[1:49:59] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:02] the prophet of God said and identified
[1:50:04] Masterpiece would leave on this quote
[1:50:08] I am now identified in the baptism of
[1:50:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:13] not something out here on the street
[1:50:15] something 40 years ago
[1:50:17] I have it right now
[1:50:19] the glory and power of God of the
[1:50:22] Forgiveness of sins I seen him heal the
[1:50:25] sick open the blind eyes I've seen them
[1:50:27] foretail things read the hearts of the
[1:50:30] people I'm identified with him and his
[1:50:32] ministry at that day glory to God I'm
[1:50:35] identified with him for deliverance in
[1:50:38] this last day I trust to be a part of
[1:50:40] that great bride that's coming some of
[1:50:42] these days
[1:50:43] no matter what the world may say they
[1:50:46] may call us crazy hysterical beelzebubs
[1:50:50] Heretics whatever they want to I still
[1:50:53] want to be identified with that group
[1:50:55] I'm still here I'll remain there I was
[1:50:59] born there I want to stay there I'll
[1:51:02] always be there because God placed me
[1:51:04] there I am I left my church to come
[1:51:07] identify myself with a bunch of Holy
[1:51:10] Rollers I'm one of them I'm identified
[1:51:13] are you identified with that group not
[1:51:16] something 40 years ago don't identify me
[1:51:18] with the shock with something that's
[1:51:20] dried up dead and gone identify me with
[1:51:23] the grain identify me with pride time
[1:51:25] identify me with the Rapture identify me
[1:51:28] with the message identify me with the
[1:51:30] clown identify me with the prophet
[1:51:33] identify me with the same life
[1:51:36] that was in Jesus Christ now living
[1:51:39] and each one of you let's all stand
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:50] identified
[1:51:54] by God's spirit
[1:51:56] to discern or withstand
[1:52:00] has to be revealed to you
[1:52:03] the prophet said God said how can you go
[1:52:05] look for something when you don't know
[1:52:06] what it is
[1:52:09] how do I know what I'm becoming well
[1:52:12] I've seen the chief wave
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:16] testifying
[1:52:19] of all of the wheat seeds in the field

[1:52:47] ideas you thought you had it all figured
[1:52:50] out just just die out to that old shuck
[1:52:55] let the word discern the thought and
[1:52:56] tits of your heart and separate
[1:52:59] that you can lay in the presence of the
[1:53:01] Sun and bake all the greenness out

[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:57] before I turn it over to our pastor I
[1:53:59] just
[1:54:01] want to pray with you and give you an
[1:54:03] opportunity if you feel prayer would
[1:54:04] help you
[1:54:09] with every head bowed I am
[1:54:13] I realize more than ever before I need a
[1:54:15] revelation
[1:54:19] by God's spirit I need Revelation to be
[1:54:21] able to discern
[1:54:25] not just something of a church
[1:54:29] organization but
[1:54:31] something on a daily basis
[1:54:36] while you work and you
[1:54:38] raise your family and you have your
[1:54:41] relationships and you go to the job
[1:54:44] where you get into your car
[1:54:47] I want to move past the flesh Realm
[1:54:51] I want to move into a higher height I
[1:54:53] wanna
[1:54:55] I wanna Pierce through the unbelief
[1:54:59] I want to raise up in the Heavenly
[1:55:00] places in Christ Jesus and want to be in
[1:55:04] communion with him walking with him
[1:55:07] I see how sensitive the prophet was
[1:55:10] just a little breeze Lord is that you
[1:55:15] that's not too far from us Church
[1:55:18] that was an example
[1:55:21] that's how much God loves you he wants
[1:55:23] to walk with you he wants to hold your
[1:55:25] hand he wants to give you discernment
[1:55:26] that you know right from wrong
[1:55:30] maybe with your head bound if you
[1:55:32] feel the words dealt with your heart and
[1:55:34] you want prayer and you just want to
[1:55:35] lift your hand to him
[1:55:37] say Lord help me I need revelation
[1:55:41] I need Revelation by the spirit to give
[1:55:43] me discernment
[1:55:44] so no right from wrong to discern the
[1:55:46] two Spirits within the framework of my
[1:55:48] own life
[1:55:50] between my flesh and my desires
[1:55:53] between your word and your desires for
[1:55:55] my life Heavenly Father there's hands up
[1:55:57] everywhere
[1:55:59] Lord we want to love you more

[1:56:26] thank you for the revelation of
[1:56:29] justification Lord
[1:56:33] it'd be hard for many of us to keep
[1:56:34] going on
[1:56:37] but to know that
[1:56:40] you've forgiven us Lord
[1:56:42] but not only forgiven us
[1:56:45] you've Justified us as if we never did
[1:56:48] it in the first place
[1:56:50] that way when the devil tries to bring
[1:56:52] up our past
[1:56:54] we can even tell him I don't know what
[1:56:56] you're talking about
[1:56:58] because we're going back to Eden before
[1:57:00] the fall ever came
[1:57:02] oh that's how powerful this message is

[1:57:10] their hand to you pray that you give
[1:57:11] them Revelation by your spirit Lord
[1:57:14] deliver them from the things that have
[1:57:16] been
[1:57:17] hindering their walk with you
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:20] Lord may your word just come to them
[1:57:24] and just start to break to them in such
[1:57:26] a supernatural way that it would change
[1:57:28] their lives
[1:57:30] it changed their countenance
[1:57:32] others would inquire of of the hope
[1:57:35] that lays within them because of the
[1:57:37] change
[1:57:38] that you've wrought in their life Lord I
[1:57:40] commit them to you now
[1:57:42] and Jesus Christ's name

[2:01:19] but every man also on the things of
[2:01:21] others
[2:01:22] and let this mind
[2:01:25] be in you
[2:01:28] which was also in Christ now we always
[2:01:31] take that scripture and we go up
[2:01:36] to the first five verses but we need to
[2:01:40] take that scripture and go down to the
[2:01:42] next verse let this mind be in you that
[2:01:46] was in Christ who being in the form of
[2:01:48] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[2:01:51] with God
[2:01:55] amen that's what we want
[2:01:58] really when you think about it isn't it
[2:02:00] we want to be equal with the word
[2:02:05] and to be equal means there's no lacking
[2:02:07] yes
[2:02:10] right I mean if you have one cup and
[2:02:12] another cup and one's got full and the
[2:02:16] other one's not full it's not equal
[2:02:20] so what we want is we want everything
[2:02:22] that he is in us
[2:02:25] and when the word of God comes it
[2:02:27] doesn't it can I I just sat back
[2:02:30] listened to the whole sermon saying like
[2:02:32] I'm short
[2:02:34] of a lot of things I got a lot of
[2:02:36] growing to do I got a lot of maturing to
[2:02:39] do but thank God through the word of God
[2:02:41] I can obtain that which is in my heart
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:47] never let don't ever
[2:02:50] condemnation for them who are in Christ
[2:02:52] Jesus
[2:02:54] who walked not after the flesh but after
[2:02:56] God and who can lay anything to the
[2:03:00] charge of God's elect because the seed
[2:03:02] of God remains in them
[2:03:05] that's what our desire is
[2:03:08] Lord help me
[2:03:12] I need your spirit I need your grace I
[2:03:15] need your love I want to be everything
[2:03:19] that I hear in God's word that's what I
[2:03:22] want to be
[2:03:24] and I you're not telling me
[2:03:28] I'm short
[2:03:29] what you're telling me is I have more
[2:03:31] for you
[2:03:33] Lord that you're going to fill me up
[2:03:37] In The Same Spirit that was in you
[2:03:40] will be in me
[2:03:42] then as you are
[2:03:45] so can I be in this world
[2:03:48] that's my Pursuit father
[2:03:51] and I know those Matthew spoke I know
[2:03:54] the place that I'm going to receive the
[2:03:57] revelation
[2:03:59] to have that
[2:04:00] life
[2:04:02] you stored it up in a message
[2:04:05] father now I pray that I can see it for
[2:04:08] it
[2:04:09] personally unfold in my heart
[2:04:13] oh Church she's got so much for us
[2:04:17] he's got so much for us so much more
[2:04:20] than we could even think
[2:04:23] even ask even desire he's got so much
[2:04:26] for you do you feel tonight like he's
[2:04:28] got something for you
[2:04:30] you feel like he's got something he
[2:04:31] wants to give you you feel like he wants
[2:04:34] you to be victorious he's not condemning
[2:04:37] you for the problem you fight he's not
[2:04:40] condemning you for the sin that's so
[2:04:42] easily beset you he's sitting there
[2:04:45] saying I I want you to come up
[2:04:49] and you can grab a hold of it I love
[2:04:52] that man he finally fell down at Jesus
[2:04:55] is he Jesus said if thouks can believe
[2:04:58] and he finally looked at him and he fell
[2:05:01] down and grabbed His Garment and said
[2:05:03] Lord help my
[2:05:05] unbelief
[2:05:06] help me overcome
[2:05:09] Lord I warn you are hungry for it I'm
[2:05:12] thirsty for it amen you believe that
[2:05:16] amen think of that tonight there's two
[2:05:19] roads you can go
[2:05:22] two roads you can follow one
[2:05:25] by faith
[2:05:27] you can accept the things that you see
[2:05:31] or you can accept the things that says
[2:05:34] in his word let's play that first verse
[2:05:37] again if you would put it there for me
[2:05:40] to sing the first verse of the two roads
[2:05:43] there are two roads you may take
[2:05:47] one by sight
[2:05:50] that's what the word of God does doesn't
[2:05:52] it lets you sit there and see
[2:05:56] I'm short
[2:06:00] but there's one by faith I can obtain
[2:06:03] that
[2:06:05] which I'm short
[2:06:07] I can obtain that
[2:06:09] what I don't have
[2:06:13] praise God for that I'm predestinated to
[2:06:16] it it's mine I'm going to lay claim on
[2:06:20] it my healing
[2:06:22] everything about it I'm going to lay
[2:06:24] hold
[2:06:25] because it's mine
[2:06:27] and I can have it
[2:06:29] if I take the word of God
[2:06:32] or you can tell you what you see
[2:06:36] what you believe
[2:06:38] [Music]
[2:06:40] is what you'll believe
[2:06:42] if you believe the rich that you are
[2:06:48] then that's what you'll believe
[2:06:50] but if you believe what the word says
[2:06:53] you are that you that's quite a
[2:06:57] challenge of Faith isn't it
[2:07:00] to be able to look at yourself as a
[2:07:02] Spirit-filled
[2:07:04] love of God shed abroad in your heart
[2:07:08] oh I just think Matthew's calling to us
[2:07:10] tonight to come up to Higher Ground be
[2:07:14] more christ-like I think it's possible
[2:07:17] Lord help me tonight

[2:07:22] my life

[2:07:32] me father that I can grab it let me hear
[2:07:35] your voice of this age speak to me and
[2:07:38] keep calling me up Lord that's my
[2:07:42] heart's desire amen I'm not a very good
[2:07:45] singer but so I'll just turn it over and
[2:07:48] let Billy close with the song
[2:07:51] but
[2:07:52] foreign
[2:07:58] came on your heart tonight
[2:08:01] that wasn't a condemnation
[2:08:04] it was an invitation
[2:08:09] it wasn't a
[2:08:11] yeah wasn't a description
[2:08:15] it was a prescription
[2:08:18] amen we can rise
