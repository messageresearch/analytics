and praise you in jesus christ's name amen amen david get conquered a testimony if it could come after that and then after that but moses can come and sing a special amen certainly thankfully they have him with us god bless your sins yeah before i give this testimony i just wanted to read this scripture here out of the book of isaiah that he says but now that said the lord that created thee o jacob that formed thee or israel filled nor for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when that passes through waters i'll be with thee and through the rivers they shall overflow thee and when thou walkers through the fire that shall not be burned neither shall the flame candle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopian siva for thee since that was precious in my sight that has been honorable and i've loved thee therefore i'll give men for the and people for that life i want to give a testimony a few weeks ago you know actually two weeks from now i i went on a trip to go support one of my brother and just to take a break from the regular life and we went on a trip that saturday after we went to celebrate my brother getting my friend getting married and after the marriage so we stayed a little late just with the bros talking joking and it was like 1am we really got hungry it was just like okay let's go to the there was a taco truck somewhere in the woods we were just like okay let's go grab it since it was really far from any stores as we was driving we we grabbed the food we was just talking about life goals just i would be amongst bros just talking i'm doing this i want to do this and we was just driving every one of us that was sitting in the back seat of the car we didn't have no seat belt and just the people in the front the driver and the you know and my big brother they were on this front seat and we were just talking and we're going on a highway on a 65 mile per hour and as it was going you know there was a lady that came right in front of us she's just started driving and was just like all right school i mean we're chilling it's one am no rush we're gonna sleep maybe at three or four in the morning wake up and do the same thing the next day and stuff but as we kept on driving that lady came in front of us for a few minutes like a good two minutes or something was just talking and we didn't even pay attention to her we didn't care there was a car that a carpet saw is coming in on the opposite side at 65 also miles per hour the cop didn't couldn't follow it so the cop went on the other side of the highway and i literally saw this accident with my two eyes that lady when she came in front of us you know this is why i read this scripture because that lady when she came in front of us she was literally less than 200 feet with us i'm not good with those numbers but she was literally right in front of us driving and that car that was the person that was drunk coming in the opposite way they literally met up and both car went up in the air and the driver was just frozen like the car 300 feet like 65 miles we can't just literally go after them all the sudden the car just stopped you know i was just like this new technology is crazy but it was not the technology that was the hand of god to preserve us and you know we just literally just stopped we saw both cars went up in the air and they went both down so they were coming at the very same speed the drunk guy that came on the opposite side died on the scene they took him dead the lady that came in front of us she was the bones was broken they were taking her like a fish like something really like the body is nothing you know i sat there all of a sudden all the life goals that we was talking about i'm accomplishing this i'm trying to do this it seemed like it was nothing all of it became like a very foul of sound where i was just like you know we can plan everything but the lord really has control and he it made me see life differently i was just like god literally gave that lady for my life and my brother's life because had he not be that lady being in front of us would have been we would have been crushed because the dude's car was much stronger than ours you know it's anyway it's all plastic but the grace of god really has been kind to me so i wanted to share it it may seem little but it means a lot to me [Applause] god bless you brother william taught me a little song that he wrote and just wanted to accompany him when he sings it god bless you we're singing faith is the substance we live by faith it's by faith that we believe that the world were created by by god and in the song i'm saying i've seen so many substances we have substance all around us what we can see and touch but i was so thrilled and i had joy in my heart when i discovered that there is another substance faith is that substance that is hidden in my heart but it makes me more than able [Music] i have seen so many substances tangible substance but great was my joy when i discovered these other substances [Music] eating in my soul it makes me more than able faith is a substance event is a revelation eden in my soul [Music] faith is a revelation [Music] it makes me more than able [Music] consider the lily the lily of the field [Music] [Music] faith faith is a substance faith is a revelation in my soul but it makes me more than able what is that red mountain before the rubber shall become a plane the stone shall be brought forth in the opening of the seven seals i have come to a realization this great mystery of who i am oh yes i know i am more than able church faith [Music] or it makes me [Music] is even for my translation oh yes i know i am more than able just like enoch i'll be changed into my dear family gravity will lose its power over me oh yes it will be defeated this world stored in my heart will trigger the translation church faith is a substance faith is a revelation in my soul faith is [Music] faith is is a revelation [Music] it makes me [Music] it makes me faith is a revelation my soul and it makes me amen amen aren't you glad for the gift of faith amen let's all stand that this time as you invite put it right here father i see that you will draw me a line in the sand and i wanna be standing by your side oh and holding your [Music] oh this is my pleasure [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] i'm sure [Music] to be true worshipers amen amen just a quick announcement uh uh brother david had been mentioning over the last few services last couple weeks about questions and everything and um he just wanted to to let you know there's a container in the vestibule there in the front by the bulletin board if you want to write down questions and put them in there so he's got them i believe he said he has a notepad up there so you'd be able to just write a question down pull it off there fold it up throw it in the little container so they're all in one spot for them so i just wanted to make that announcement there and then we'll just get right into the word certainly appreciate that song and you'll understand uh the scripture we're gonna read here john chapter four and we know the story here the story of the woman at the well we just want to read a couple of the scriptures here verses 22 to 24. and well i guess we just started we'll start at verse 21. jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father as we've read your word this evening lord and lord no doubt many of thousands upon millions and millions have read scriptures before but lord we know that only the holy ghost can open the word to us for what we have need of in in our hour that we're living in right now lord we just pray that your holy spirit would walk up and down the aisles of every heart this evening lord that you'd minister the needs of your people oh god i'm just a mortal man lord who's been following their lot to to minister the word of life to your people may i just get completely out of the way lord and let your spirit have the preeminence in the service lord you're the one that knows the needs of every heart here this evening father and only you can minister to those needs father and we place it into your hands lord we deny all human ability lord for there is no human ability that can break the word of life only the spirit of god the lord that could come down and speak to your people that drew us out of the world unto yourself can do it we just place the service into your hands and ask your perfect will be done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated don't maybe necessarily have a title for the service this evening i just uh you know though i guess supposedly uh i suppose the way the lord works with each uh person who ministers is definitely different and i know the way the lord works with me it seems like the lord will give me inspirations and i just i have such a struggle to take those inspirations and put them down in a in a way that i can maybe write it down so many are much better at taking notes and things but i just have to rely upon inspiration of the spirit so you just bear with me uh you know praise the lord we don't rely on human ability if we did we'd be we'd be of men most miserable because surely i couldn't save you though it would be my desire to and we couldn't save each other but the blood of jesus christ saves each one i was just struck uh you know i i find and i'm so grateful you know as a minister you take inspiration from everywhere and from each other you hear the minister the ministries that come through and and the lord inspires them and then you just catch a little thread here and there and the lord you start pulling on that thread and the lord just starts revealing things and really just inspiring and i i i find lately i've just been really inspired by different uh the word that our pastor's been bringing and particularly last wednesday you know speaking on the influence of the age that we're living in and how we have to fight against that ins that that inspiration that the the age is the that laodicean spirit you know such a desire you know i hear this word maybe nowadays uh tossed about so much of individuality you know we have to be your own person and you have to be this and you have to be that and uh we were even discussing it after the service and and you come to realize when you have a real revelation of of what part of what this message that we've that we've received has brought is when you become a christian and the holy ghost has baptized you in the body of jesus christ you've forfeited every one of those rights we've voluntarily laid those things down at the feet of jesus christ and said lord i don't want any of my own desires anymore i don't want my own wants anymore because you know when how many could testify when we were younger and even and even now in the natural we don't even know what we want you know one day you want this and the other day you want that ask my wife you know what she wants for dinner and one second it's one thing and the next it's another you know that's that's the old joke well what do you want to eat well i don't know what do you want to eat and nobody knows what they want but we have a heavenly father who knows what we need in our lives we have we have a heavenly father who if we could just lay down at his feet for just uh just a minute maybe but you know so many times we get up and we have to go about our days and we run to and fro because the the the spirit of the ages put such a time pressure on us you know it's amazing isn't it all the technology and things that we have that try to make our lives easier and yet it seems we have less time than we ever did we're running to and fro and the scripture declares that if leaving the book of daniel men would run to and fro doing this and that and we've seen it coming to pass in our day and it's so hard because uh in the natural man and i find the lord just impressing it upon my heart that we have to as as believers and holy ghost-filled christians we must absolutely divorce ourselves from every bit of the carnal mind that has tried to to lay itself upon you in this age because this age is just constantly forcing carnality upon you as our pastor was even ministering last wednesday it comes in this age it seems right now the the big thing is is such that an identification with a certain group or a certain cause how our pastor kind of brought that out a little bit how they they want to sweep you up in a spirit of some cause or this or that get you stacked on one side or one on the other but our prophet even had to tell us over and over again that we don't take sides with any of those things because as a christian we walk right down the middle we find out you could go off into one side on fanaticism and just go off the deep end over here you can go off on one side on the other side of fanaticism and run straight on the deep end but we want to stand as christians in the middle be able to bridge the gap and say if you just come to christ all of your problems could be solved they want to talk about a pro this program and that program and this idea and that idea but we don't have any ideas than a profit the only idea that can profit as a baptism of the holy ghost into the body of jesus christ but the world tries to pull us in constantly throwing things out and it's one of the greatest tricks of the devil is he he he injects so much truth into what's being said so they'll want to run you off on this cause or that cause this idea that idea and they'll throw so much truth in with it and it may be a noble idea but noble ideas brought in a carnal manner will only bring forth carnal fruits because the only way to bring forth a true millennium which they're trying to do our prophet taught us they're looking for their superman they're looking for their their they you know we talk we talk about their their natural order of things to bring men into subjection they've been doing it since the tower of babel when that nimrod religion was trying to grab all men and start subjecting them to a certain power to bring a forced unity i believe it's what the prophet said in the church age book is that it would be a forced unity but see what we want is the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace in the holy ghost something that can't be faked by a natural system but it's brought about supernaturally by the holy ghost because we've seen it even so much in the message that people want to take one side on this and one side on that one group's got their pet doctrine here one group's got their own little ideas here i don't want to have any ideas except for jesus christ i just want to have the mind of christ we find and i know we've been talking about that natural mind and knowledge so much but if i could just interject this a little bit to tie it in here what you know so many times there's so much of a pride you know as a man us brothers can kind of relate right you don't want us so many times we won't people don't like to admit when they just don't know we want to know all the mysteries we don't know all the mysteries and then sometimes it's hard for us to admit because we've by by the grace of the lord we've got the message of the hour we've got the answer to the devil's question and it's true because the answer to the devil's question is the word of god it is the holy ghost but the devil comes well you can't explain it this way you can't do it this and that and that's why we've so many times run off on tangents because the the the noble desire is there to understand the things of god i believe the scripture even says maybe ecclesiastes get unto thy self-understanding it's it's a noble thing to have but unless it be the understanding of the mind of christ it won't profit anything but drag one over this way one over that way dividing brotherhood bringing division where we could stand judges like the brothers though you know you get a you get a you get something that you got actually my father-in-law over there they just had an ikea thing to assemble you know and what's the old joke you know you get that thing out there and then do you need the instructions now do you know how to put it together no but i'll figure it out and that's sometimes how it is spiritually we we don't have all the information yet because the lord it's not time to reveal it but we run out remember brother branham even cautioned us on that he called it presuming to venture without authority to walk out there with some grand idea or some grand plan that it looks so good but there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is death and you find it because it starts to divide brother against brother little isms and schisms start to worm their way in there what we need is the holy ghost to come down with the old weed eater and start pulling those weeds out pulling every root of bitterness out of our hearts pulling every little idea that exalts itself above the knowledge of jesus christ we've got so in heaven we literally have an infinite bountiful treasure house to pull from but we've got to learn how to pull in faith for the things that we have need of what does the scripture say he says you have not because you ask not but then when you do ask you ask to consume it upon your lusts so maybe sometimes we have to check ourselves why do i want to know these great mysteries do i want to look up like some great big man do i want to make myself a name in the message do i want to be some great preacher the lord will reveal his word by bringing it to pass he will make known the revelation you can better believe of revelation of the body change will come i'm gonna know it you know how because my body will be changed glory to god i won't need someone to pull out a diagram and tell me how it's gonna work the holy spirit will reveal it in the hour that i have needles but the but the spirit the lord is looking for true worshipers to worship in spirit and in truth a lot of people have anointings a lot of people have anointings of the spirit our prophet preached that message anointed ones at the end times surely they can bring down anointings but except accept the anointing be coupled with truth there's no profit to it because that anointing can cause that tear to grow just as much as it causes the wheat to grow in fact if you know anything about which i've learned and i've told you many times about taking care of your lawn the weeds actually tend to spring up a little bit faster [Music] that's why they say you're growing like a weed because you just sprung up two inches overnight it never ceases to amaze me i mow my lawn a little rain falls grass grew a quarter of an inch that we grew three inches i don't understand it but don't worry though if the sun comes out it'll burn it down they'll see what kind of foundation it's built upon but he's looking for worshipers true worshipers that will worship in spirit and in truth and we've received the truth we have received the gospel the rest of the world has a gospel this is the gospel and only in this gospel the gospel of jesus christ for this hour we call it the message but it's nothing other than a revelation of jesus christ we've given it a natural name but it's nothing other than the revealed life of jesus christ for a rapture age if i could put it that way just as much as noah was a revealed word for an age of overcoming through a through a flood this message is even more so because it goes back to enoch who is out of there before the flight even came but the lord is what does he say he said the father seeketh such i can testify to that he sought me out wasn't looking for him knew that there was something missing couldn't put your finger on it but when that light struck the seed all the devils in hell can't stop it from coming to life hallelujah i learned a lot through tending my yard you know they say you ever notice how in the when the winter's just ending around here that grass starts to grow earlier around that concrete you know why it's because the concrete holds the heat from the sun and then it can warm up that soil a little bit more you know sometimes when you're being held down by those worldly pressures that pressure remember pressure creates heat how many remember that from science class pressure creates heat heat just warms you up just enough or maybe you can receive something from god thinking that strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you they are more precious than gold hallelujah those trials are made for you tailor made just for you oh we put we put see we put bible characters on on a pedestal you know who the only bible character is it's jesus christ because job was a bible character but it was the character of christ in job that could say though he slay me i will trust him i imagine when jesus was on the cross that scripture went through his mind as he laid there oh my god save me my god my god why is thou forsaken me and then that scripture may be crossed through his mind though he slay me yet i trust him i lay my life down i'll take it up again hallelujah that's the character of christ in job and when you're going through those fiery trials and the devil's taking everything that god let him take from you because he can't touch you without permission he can't touch you without permission i remember i remember looking at well forgive me maybe it's a carnal example but it just came to my mind i remember i used to really like watching basketball and they'd always had the little nba thing at the end and they said this broadcast cannot be disseminated without express written consent from the nba that means the nba owned it in order to broadcast you needed permission that's what the devil has to have from you he says he has to go up to god say lord because the devils believe in trash oh the devil knows who's really in charge he may not act like it that's the difference is the devil knows but iniquity was found in his heart iniquity remember means you know what the right thing is and you won't do it anyhow so he knows god is god he was the covering cherub thou has been a need of the garden of god but he has to go and say lord could i maybe just please try manasseh one time and the lord you know he does he looks down at brother manasseh he sees you know what he can take it how do i know that he says because he won't put anything on you that you cannot bear see the see the the script he's got the answer every time for the devil's question well why am i going through this because he won't put anything on you that you cannot bear and you know what that gold has got to go through the fire it's got to go through the fire it's got to get heated up and then after it's gone through the fire it's got to go to the anvil and get beaten down a little more and we wonder why we're going through trials praise the lord for the test that trial you don't even know what's happening like we preached last time about that butterfly it doesn't even know it's being broken down and reassembled bit by bit molecule by molecule and you don't even know when you're going through that trial the master's hammer beating on you beating you know who the master's hammer is the devil he ain't nothing but a tool in the hand of god to bring you closer to him the devil ain't nothing but a tool in the hand of god he is god's servant he is god's servant unwilling though it may be all things will serve our god you know i work i'm an air traffic controller and we have a book we call our bible i hate to use that that's almost the sacrilegious but we call it's the 71 10.65 it's rules and regulations for air traffic it's like 5 000 pages longer it feels like it because it's written by lawyers and they have definitions for terms and in one of those is the word must or shall indicates that something has to be done that way so there's no question about it every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess there's no ifs ands or buts that includes you devil [Music] and he doesn't even know it that's why i love our god so much because the scripture says he'll catch the crafty in their own snare he'll catch the wicked in their own devices the lord is 500 steps ahead of these so-called geniuses out there because he saw the end from the beginning and he planned it so perfectly the devil is literally trying to do everything he can opposite of god and everything he's doing is playing right into his hands praise our god and it's so fixed it's a rigged game that's why he hates you that's why he despises you because though you fall seven times you get up and god's standing there saying come back i'm right here and the devil says i didn't get that and the lot god says you couldn't have it he said i gave you your shot cain i told you what to do and you wouldn't do it praise the lord for grace see when i'm weak i am strong why because his grace is sufficient because his grace is strong it has nothing to do with your strength his strength is made perfect by your weakness his glory is exalted because of your failures not that we glory in our failures but we get glory in the fact that we know no matter how much we fail he will he has grace for you to take it back that's why the devil hates so much he screwed up forgive me for saying it that way he messed up one time he's down kicked out all done why because the lord already knew what was in his heart and yet here you are looking in the mirror of god's word because you're faithful your desire you know brother branham said that there's something in a christian that always desired perfection that just good enough wasn't enough for a christian it's not good enough for a christian why because god's in you and god is perfect and there's a word that says be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and so there's a part of you that says i can't help but desire to be perfect because it's the word of god to me and see that's what i love see his grace is so far beyond anything that we've ever mentally been able to grasp oh my we need to have more grace with each other we need to have more honestly sometimes we need to have more grace for ourselves look look at yourself through god's filter look at your brothers and sisters through the filter of god's word so easy to throw stones when you're on the mountaintop those thrones are a little bit heavier when you're in the valley easy to roll the stones downhill from the mountaintop but when you've got to throw them uphill from the valley brother they don't fall they don't go very far they usually roll right back down to you you know how it goes but see god's grace is sufficient he's looking for true worshipers we've received a word for our day you don't got to figure it out i kind of ended up here again just talking about figuring out we're so worried about figuring it out every you know the the devil the devil is trying to put you in a box just like the just like the whole world throughout all of what we call religious history in the church has that church has always at some point tried to put god in their little box this far and this is as much as we'll take this this is as far as we can go with luther we'll justifications that that's great but sanctification i don't know if we can deal with that and so god says okay i'll just move on because sanctification is part of me and then they go beyond that to pentecost and restoration of the gifts and somebody said well we just can't take that's fanaticism and yeah it did run into fanaticism but there's truth to it the devils put up all those scarecrows over the gifts of god you know brother branham said every local body should have those nine spiritual gifts in operation in the church each local body should have though you know he said therefore he said for the cleansing of the church to call out sin to bring things to life that need to be rooted out but you see the devil had put this scarecrows up sure there's carnal impersonations there's men out there looking for money sitting out there oh someone in the back's got a backache and like everybody has a backache because that's what happens when you turn 35. i mean they're you know it's it's amazing because everything that the devil would accuse the true prophet of doing is everything he's doing because that's what he does he is a manipulator he's a liar how do you know the devil's lying because his mouth is moving but see the devils put up all these scarecrows and say oh well that's just a money scheme so these gifts can't really be real or they went all into fanaticism and they glen they cling only to the gifts no sir see we we are beyond that we ought to be more mature than that we are more mature than that because we can take the gifts of god and filter them through the word of god to understand how to use it properly but we've got to get ourselves in the channel to where god can move because god's not going to come to our channel we need to get in his god is not going to be on our side we need to be on his side that's i believe as moses said whosoever is on the lord's side not my side he wasn't talking about himself he said who's on the lord's side so we need to be cognizant of that the lord is looking for true worshipers we've got to identify ourselves with him with him and him alone the world is vying for your attention particularly the young people vying for your attention whether when you're when you're in school what are all the different things you have the nerds you got the band geeks i was a band geek so i know you you beca what is it it becomes what is it becomes an identification are you a sports person are you are you a teacher's pet as they say are you this and are you that what are they trying to do they're trying to pin identifications to you and when you be when you when you grow up and you get into the into the into the job world and and in the collegiate levels and stuff it's like where are you going to be this are you going to identify as this are you going to be a liberal arts major you're going to be this what are they trying to do they're trying to take your identity and attach it to something carnal our identity is only in one thing and that is jesus christ that's why paul could say he said one says i'm of apollos one says of a peter one says i'm a paul he says was paul is christ divided was paul crucified for you no sir so what is our identification the devil's trying to put all these isms and schisms put little things everywhere by the grace of god we're rising above that we're rising above that so what do we do we become true worshipers we worship in spirit and in truth but it's got to be more than just see because if you're identified with it if there's an identification there's a mark that comes with it how did you know the guys were on the football team because every friday before the football game they wore those jerseys man they wore those jerseys around the school all the cheerleaders wore their little things and everything and everybody was wearing their stuff what were they doing they were identifying themselves as to who they were if it'd be that way for the world how much more do we have to identify ourselves with christ you've got to be willing to lose your own reputation your own social standing your own carnal level of whatever it might be and condescend to his level why because christ said take take my yoke upon you and learn of me he says for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest into your souls people don't want to be meek people don't want to be lowly particularly in america where we're americans we've got it down everybody bows to us because we are the world empire we have been a world empire for a long time and i'm not even talking about the natural i'm talking about spiritual because we had a prophet that came and condemned to this nation already already indicted her she's gone and only now are we seeing more of the fruits of that and people and we know people think that they're going to save it but all that is is lot doing his thing lot pleading with the sodomites all my brothers do not this wicked thing he called them brothers that showed who did he identify with but see if that's going on now that's why we don't get caught up in that why because if that's going on there's something else going on up the hill where nobody else could see and something was happening with abraham brothers and sisters something was happening with sarah they were about ready to receive a promise and you know what you know what the powerful thing is is god will use you god will use this bride god will use that royal seed of abraham to even save the lots because that's what he did not once but twice pulled them out of the fire one time when they got kidnapped and their prayers are what pulled them out the second time before it all burned that's why we ought to be sighing and crying sighing and crying for the abominations lord help me we ought to be have more tender hearts the the world has hardened our hearts when it comes to being sensitive to the holy ghost why because you can't be a manly man and you got to be tough and tough it out no jesus wept on the top of that mountain and said jerusalem jerusalem how i would have hovered you but you would not that's the spirit of christ that's the spirit of a real man who can enter into the sufferings of another and and get into that channel and and weep before god and be broken before god we need to break up the fallow ground but something was going on with abraham and sarah brothers and sisters and we've been hearing a little bit about our pastor minister around melchizedek but there was something happening there there was a change taking place didn't even they didn't know it many of us have been on that road just like abraham and sarah a long while just pressing the battles yeah you're failing sometimes but you're getting back up and you're pressing you're just going on going on but there's a change happening the whole time and every once in a while you get before lord and say lord just like abraham and say lord is this going to happen or not and you know what the lord gives grace i know because i've experienced it where i've got i said lord is this going to happen and he'll come down and send a refreshing through your life and confirm that promise again and then you just keep on pressing i believe a god even god even confirmed it to abraham in one way or another at least three times maybe four times before even melchizedek came just the lord would come down and abraham would be distraught and say is this is this is this man gonna inherit everything that i have this this eleazar and the lord has to say no out of your out of your bowels it's coming your seed will inherit the gates of the enemy they're going to take the gates of the enemy had to confirm it to him and and i thank the lord for that because we need those times but all the while there's a change happening he doesn't even know it they're just it feels like they're wandering sometimes it feels like you're wandering don't know what direction you're going but the only thing we know is to follow the bloody footprints you stick with the word you follow the leading of the spirit he's looking for true worshipers not not people that just want to be there's a lot of hangers on it's easy see because true identification is more than surface deep there were many that were identified and i put that in air quotes identified with jesus for a season when he was on the scene but when he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man to drink his blood you have no part with you and i tell you what i feel like right now in the message with all the things that have happened over the past year year and a half kind of feels like a moment like that to me where all of a sudden things people are looking at certain things and questioning and saying i don't understand i don't understand why things are the disciples didn't understand they didn't know but the only thing they knew was that revelation that they had received from the beginning thou art the christ the son of the living god and that's what i've received is this message thou art the christ the son of the living god this word is the son of the living god the very god of heaven condescended down in this age to bring his bride to a rapture i don't know anything else beyond that except what he'll reveal me and i praise the lord you know what i only want to know what i need to know anyway i have a hard time keeping track of the stuff i know right now and i don't say that to jest it's because you know what it is it's because the lord is trying to get us out of our carnal minds relying on your carnal mind relying upon your own understanding relying on your own ability is to lead you down a path of heartbreak and sadness and depression and all these things god because because you're going to come to the cruel realization that without jesus christ you are nothing without the holy ghost you're nothing from dust you came and dust your return but with that scene of god in you more than ten thousand worlds it's worth more than than you could even possibly imagine but it's that paradox it lays in there and yet we've got to be humble enough to understand that without him he said what he said jesus told them he said without me you can do nothing without me you can do nothing i i don't know anything else outside of him i have no ability i have no ability i know that because i've tried i've tried to figure things out on my own whether it be in the spiritual or even in the natural when it comes to just natural life we'll fret and run to and fro lord what about this lord what about that lord what about this and you know what he wants sometimes he just wants that pressure to get you down on your knees to have some fellowship with him and then he'll make it he'll he'll he'll take take care of all that i hope this is all right you've got to identify yourself with him regardless of the surroundings he said he said if you deny me before man i'll deny you before my father i believe the way things are going now we're going to get pushed we're getting pushed into a corner brothers and sisters i mean they're they're already like police shutting down churches that have done that up in canada that's just on our doorstep so if you think we're just gonna cruise through and it's all going to be nice smooth sailing we got another thing coming because it's going to go to a test because it's always our our prophet told us right right before before that art can make it through it's got to go through the hall of critics it's got it's gotta pass the test and the test is it's happening even now the rapture is happening even now but it's just gonna that's why it's a squeeze because it's pressure's building pressure's building you know what he's doing he's squeezing more of him into you and more of the world out i i appreciate see it's a paradox i don't understand he said brother how can he squeeze more in at the same time he's squeezing it out i don't know but i know he's doing it because he promised it because as he he says you draw nigh to me i'll draw an eye to you we need to talk about it more we need to be in the spirit more when we come to church we ought to have our licks of fire ready to go you know how many times maybe do we not get ourselves prepared for service we call it service we're here to perform a service to the lord to worship him to give him all that we have and how many right now just ahead we're having thoughts about what they're going to have for dinner i'm not saying i'm not saying that to accuse anybody i'm just saying let's identify the devil call him out pull out the sword and start to swing brothers and sisters because god deserves everything that you've got everything that you got doesn't save you but if you've been saved you'll give him everything that you've got another paradox but i love the lord for paradoxes because i look at myself i look i look at my shortcomings and i shouldn't be here i shouldn't be serving them i thought i'd given up so many times in so many places i'm sure many of us have been in those despairing places where we just wanted to throw our hands up and say lord i can't do it and the lord says yes that's exactly what i've been trying to get through to you for the last year you can't do it if you would rely upon me if you'd stop trying so hard according to your natural mind you'd find you know we run to and fro trying to find solutions to problems and though the solution is always right there standing next to you the presence of jesus christ just call if you would just fellowship with me if you just come and learn of me come just come fellowship with me a while i want to hear the the spirit of god speak to me like he spoke to the prophet after the storm and said would you just walk with me for a while i don't know about you i want to have a garden of eden experience i want to have an experience like enoch the scripture only says what did he do he walked with god what does that mean he put everything else aside but god he put his family aside that'd trip up some people because whether you realize it or not anything we can become an idol if it exalts itself above the knowledge of jesus christ you put you put your family before god that's an idol you put your work before god that becomes an idol you and as noble as it may seem there are things you can put before god that look good on the outside that will become an idol the pharisees are a perfect encapsulation on the outside looking perfect but their idol had become their position in standing and they kept that position in standing by appearing to be a certain thing regardless of what they truly believed on the inside because they never truly believed had they believed they would have followed jesus but don't worry unbelief doesn't hinder god i got a quote here that i'm going to read and we'll just actually we'll close here in just a minute but realize that promised seed had to come through sarah had to come through sarah god had told abraham he said he said no it won't come through anywhere anywhere else it's coming through sarah and where that sarah that type of the church though difficult as it may seem though dead is her womb looked but the scripture says she received strength to conceive seed didn't it didn't look like anything how could it happen other than a supernatural move she was a she was 90 years old old woman ceased to be with her as the way of women to be able to have children womb dead dried up all it could be there's a reason why the scripture you see the prevalence of that kind of a theme sisters in the bible not able to have the children why because god's showing something to us that when it looks the darkest it looks like it can't happen god comes on the seat he makes all of his appointments why because his word he said the word has gone forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me bored so have i spoken so shall it be and he's spoken i can't again i can't speak for you i just know what he told me when i came to this the truth of this message he said you're going to make a rapture he spoke my name in my ear he whispered it to me i felt it as an audible wind i haven't told i haven't told everybody that but it's one of the only times ever did that he whispered by name in my ear i know what he told me i can only tell you what he told me but make your calling and election sure and when you've nailed that down then nothing can stop you when god's revealed it to you and he's told you said brother andy said andy mohan and i've called you from the foundation of the world you're going to make a rapture and you're part of my bride all these different ones he's called you he's chosen you make your calling and election sure and it's dark as it looks it doesn't matter because the promise is sure he that endureth unto the end shall be saved there's nothing that can be done about it nothing because the word went forth it won't come back void it has to be fulfilled he won't let one word of his fall to the ground and it's for his own sake because he can't deny himself and he can't deny his word and his word is in you you didn't know it for much of your life but then one day that light just swooped by maybe just an instant of time when you heard something i think about our pastor's testimony being a hippie and all these things but all it took was one time to hear the voice of a prophet speaking the true gospel and something struck and then it started a chain reaction that's going to this day i can testify i heard the word of god i heard the voice of god for this age and it started a chain reaction that can't be stopped it can't be stopped it's like a nuclear weapon [Music] it's a nuclear power once that chain reaction starts brother they pulled all the control rods out of my reactor a long time ago that chain reaction's going to a rapture one of these days that chain reaction is going to bubble up so much this flesh body's going to burn away in an instant [Music] this body of flesh is going to get nuked by a spiritual fire when this mortal shall put on immortality why because one day a son of god a son of atom atom met another son of atom and you know what happens when two supernaturals collide if the supernatural the miraculous has got to happen adam's collided brother spiritual atoms spiritual fire see get out of the carnal mind all these things that are happening around the world in the natural the bride can see below the surface because she can she can see above and below and see all the things that's happening and understand these things are happening for you they're happening for me to get us in position to get us maybe a little more desperation i tell you i'm feeling a little more desperate for my family members when i see this the way the world's going you know and maybe my dad wouldn't like it if he'll hear it down the line but i know he's coming eventually but when my dad's got his like all of his all of his weapons and he says i'm a second amendment guy they ain't taking my guns i said the only the only weapon i need is the sword of the spirit and the word of god because my our weapons are not carnal but they're mighty to the tearing down of strongholds the rest of the world can go off on their isms and all their their little schemes and all their causes and many of them may look noble and people are getting caught up in them left and right but you know what's happening is there's a spiritual cause that's getting pulled together right now the wheat is being gathered together by the word of god supernaturally it's not a forced unity by one pulling one church over here and saying you come join this and you come join that but the very holy ghost the spirit of god is brooding over his bride drawing the circle tighter drawing you when you don't even know it our prophet said he said those people you thought you didn't like in the church one day your tears are going to drop when you have to leave their presence because the love of god is going to be so strong in the hearts of its people we need to find love more than we've ever needed [Music] we need love one for the other we've got to pray one for the other we've got to have forgiveness one for the other i get jealous almost of the world and how they can accept people that have done insane things preachers do crazy things a year later they accept them back it may be carnal and that preacher maybe not have ever even repented but if they can do it that in the natural how could we not have love one for the other in the spiritual pride of jesus christ lord help us he's going to help us he is helping us my help cometh from the lord i'm gonna we'll just close on this quote i read this quote today i shared it with brother david in the back and it whew it got me because i tell you what it just shows you how rigged this thing is brothers and sisters it gets me it gives me why because there's so much pressure there's so much pressure to perform in this world you got to be some big this you know you young people all the instagram snapchat facebook all those demon infested little things that you let nest on your phone that you ought to delete right now and get rid of you know amen oh my lord have mercy but what is it doing it's putting spirit of complexes on our on our children because you got to live up to certain images you got to look a certain way you got to act a certain way you got to be cool a certain way you got and that's nothing but the devil but it puts complexes on you thinking you've got to live a certain way to be accepted by the world news flash a true christian will never be accepted by the world he said the world hates you because he hated me first so you better get used to it you better get used to it it's not going to get any better and if you're trying to fit in there you won't fit in to the pattern of jesus christ and his bride you're going to fit into one of two patterns you're going to fit the pattern of the holy ghost and the bride are you going to fit the pattern of the world you choose free moral agency now it's rigged for the beginning brothers and sisters you're going to make it i'm speaking positively for every single one of you because you're going to make it it's got it rigged brothers and sisters i'm going to read this quote this is from abraham's covenant confirmed in 1961. he says one more thing i want to get to the church now some of you sitting here last night when the anointing struck me i could feel them little flares in there i've been trying to think of it i jotted it down here so i wouldn't forget it i caught that last night that you think well i i did do and so or i did so and so many times i find people won't even come in the prayer line and won't even take their number when they're called they're afraid that we'll be called up certain things kind of sounds like why many people may be scared of the holy ghost really bringing some things into the church and working the gifts maybe people don't want things rooted out but you know our prophet said then ananias and sapphira gospel is coming i i want to root out lord root everything out of me i want to have that spirit of david that said lord if there be any wicked way in me take that gospel plow and start plowing it out oh my that's my that's my desire i don't want to be wrong i want to be right and lord if there's something in me that that's pulling me the wrong way of to be wrong lord root it out and give me deliverance he's going to do it brothers and sisters he said they're afraid they'll bring up certain things now you i love the way brother brainer even has to say here he says now i used to blast that right out you all know that and not unless i'm actually led to do it i don't do it no more now you will make your mistakes you say i love this he says you say brother branham no matter what i'd ever do i'd never be worthy that's right but look you say brother branham at one time i didn't believe this message that's right i guess many of you didn't now listen to what he says here he says i wouldn't have done it i guess myself i couldn't have done it lest god revealed it to me see you have it's a revelation the whole church is built on revelation without revelation you'll never see it you're blind jesus the bible said i believe matthew 12 i believe it was where he said though jesus had done so many miracles before them yet they could not believe because isaiah said they got eyes and can't see ears and can't hear and very really holy people the cream of holiness so holiness is not all holy living is not all faith is the main thing now see this is the lord just struck something when i read this in my heart the signs follow the believer we've already received our of what we could call this our age sign we've received the sign of the son of man in malachi 4 come down and given us that sign and we believed that sign so now the signs follow the believers but so many times i feel and maybe this is just and lord forgive me if i'm wrong but this is at least what maybe this is just me this is the way i feel like the lord's dealing with me it's many times maybe my faith is always waiting to see another sign before we step out and grab it but he's given us the sign we've received our sign so if we could really grab a hold of the sign that he's already given the rest of the signs will follow behind because the signs follow the believer we don't have to go following the signs but once we've apprehended the sign that we've been given this message the signs were sweeping behind that's why he could say those local those by that local body has the gifts in it because when the local body when we come together in one accord one spirit just like that upper room and we can grab a hold of that sign that we've received then that tongues and prophesy might go forth tongues tongue's interpretation one could enter in and say truly god is among these people but if we're always looking for signs what happens you end up as a pentecostal church of this day i know because i was there where everybody's chasing after this side oh this gift over here let's run over here let's run over there and look for this that that's so with the true believer a true believer is anchored in jehovah anchored down strong and stands at their post of duty now we keep going on this quote he says now listen church now this is where to me it gets really good and it's already good it says now listen church i want to drop this in here because i believe the holy spirit told me to do it so if the holy spirit told him to do it how many do you want to hear it i want to hear it he says well listen i want you this is how fixed it is brothers and sisters you may be sitting there which some of you are i know you now listen this is a prophet talking so i want you to hear he's i believe brother branham in this moment it just seems like he's stepping into that prophet role and letting everybody know what the position is it's not about the man but it's the position that god gave that man to say remember he preached that message respects it's that office because that office was ordained of jesus christ to bring the people to a message so he's standing there he says he says you may be sitting there which some of you are i know you are disagreeing with me right now he says now i can call your name if you want me to now i love this says so i know that but i also can see farther than that that you're going to believe it one of these days hallelujah oh my that's how it gets me right oh my goodness i'm you know what makes me think about i'm looking i'm thinking about my family right now i can see farther than that you may not see it right now but i can see a little why because the spirit of jesus christ he says he says he says so i know that he says but i can see farther than that that you're going to believe it one of these days so i'm just going to put this in so you'll understand so i can give you a little spot of grace here when it ain't going to be too long until you're going to change your mind i'm telling you what that gives me such a such a peace [Applause] it ain't going to be too long till you change your mind some of you some of you won't but remember this is why i was talking about sarah and us think about that melchizedek but remember when sarah first heard that man which she is a type of the church when she heard that seeing the sign take place to abraham she actually laughed about it in her heart and she disbelieved and doubted it ever being so is that right at that time god would have rubbed her name right off is that right but he couldn't she's part of abraham they're one and brothers and sisters how many of you have had moments if you're honest with yourself when you've looked in the mirror of god's word because it's the only mirror we're truly looking into and you say lord there is no way in the carnal mind why because that carnal mind is always there trying to wiggle its way in even though that seed is saying yes lord the word is the only truth and that carnal mind is right there just whispering as he always is and he said no it can't happen and in that moment of weakness just like john right john in prison he said are you the christ or do we look for another it didn't change who he was he was a man subject to like passions struggling just like anybody else would in that situation in prison after you say lord i sold out everything i was eating locusts and honey i saw the messiah and here i am in prison and none of us have had the privilege of having that elevative in office and then been thrown in prison so how much more would we mean we struggle but he says he says but she disbelieved it and doubted it ever being saw and i know i've had my moments of weakness where i said lord there is no way lord this just and i love we were i was talking with our pastor here a few days ago i think right before he uh left on his trip and he had mentioned they said one surefire way he said if the devil's always telling you you're not going to make it that's a pretty good sign that you're on the right track because he's a liar i take comfort in that and what is it because it's not about you it's because you're in him because his faith was accepted christ's faith was accepted and now we are accepted in the beloved it's not about what you can do it's about what he already did all we got to do is remain in him glory to god he says and if you've really not been excited not worked up an emotion not got some church creed but really received the holy ghost and you're really part of christ and listen to this listen to this he said he's done all that you've received the holy ghost it's not just a motion you've received it he said and you're really part of christ he says and still a little skeptic in your mind that devil says oh you had a mind battle and you didn't think you were gonna make it you're definitely ain't gonna make it you ain't got the holy ghost brother brandon i'm sitting here saying even if you've got a little skeptic in your mind and you've already received it god will not shove you off from that because he can't you're a part of christ listen to this he will bring you to the truth now if you've never maybe you've spoken tongues danced in the spirit and done all these things that don't mean you got the holy ghost oh my my that's a million miles from it jesus never did say now remember i believed that you that when the holy the fullness of the holy ghost you'll speak in tongues right jesus never did there's no scripture in the bible that says that's the evidence to the holy ghost if you want to produce it if it is but there's no such scripture as that jesus said by their fruit you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit is not speaking in tongues that's a gift of the holy ghost after the holy ghost has come that's one of those gifts that goes with the preaching speaking in tongues interpretation interpretation of tongues all those things are gifts of the holy ghost but listen to that he says even if you've received the holy ghost let's just stand we're talking about identification who have you been identified with identify yourself with christ he says even if you're a little skeptic in your mind god won't shove you off of it because he can't because you're a part of him and i love he says he will bring you to the truth we ought to be the most confident and i'm not talking about arrogant there's a lot of spirit in the message that's gone over into arrogance and i think i've said it before the lord kind of gave me this years ago i call it bride pride i'm bride i'm bright i'm bride but i always thought about the the story brother branham told about the slave that was the son of a king he didn't have to tell anybody who he was it was the life that he led that expressed that nature that was already in him wasn't anything he had to put on and don't you worry your bride of christ the lord you've identified yourself with him he'll identify himself with you because he has to he can't deny himself sarah laughed within her heart he couldn't wipe her out because she was part of him you you and right now you know what you may have had your struggles you may be even struggling now the devil whispering in your ear all your faults and your failures but don't worry you're part of him and you just keep pressing just like abraham you know abraham went down to egypt two different times and egypt is the type of the world we know that went down there sojourning just trying to find his way but he came back you know it didn't stop the promise from coming to pass abraham's sarah sarah's laughing in her heart didn't stop in fact god puts her in the hall of fame when says she counted him faithful that promised praise the lord he'll that we've counted him faithful have you counted him faithful ah he's been so faithful to me he's been beyond faithful to me when he should have cast me off he drew me back by bands of love when i should have been a castaway even just like paul would say he said though i was chief of sinners and then standing by and watching the the persecution of the church and yet god would call him out praise the lord thank the lord for his grace thank the lord for his his sure word of prophecy for this hour oh my let's just bow our heads into a word of prayer let's just leave our heads bowed this evening and just asked the question maybe you haven't received that sure word in your own heart the scripture says to make your calling in election sure but maybe the devil's been fighting you with doubts in your mind and thoughts and different ideas and different polls from different places all around how the world has so many different spirits our prophet even taught us that it believes two hundred thousand thousand demons reese loose from the river euphrates i believe in one place even called those ancient demons antediluvian devils that would come out to try to and and attack the bride of christ we're in a battle brothers and sisters but the lord's given a more sure word of prophecy in this hour but maybe you've had questions and maybe just say lord i want to be more sure lord maybe as as the one had said to jesus even lord i believe but help my unbelief lord may you just go and if there's one that would have that desire you just raise your hand and say lord help my unbelief when i've gotten down into those places where i feel like john in prison i look around and there's just bars everywhere lord i tried to do the best i could but it
