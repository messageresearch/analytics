[23:13] sister Gail here has a prayer request
[23:15] tonight
[23:17] this is my
[23:19] premature great grandson Harrison turned
[23:22] eight months today he used a CPAP for
[23:25] he says for the first several days of
[23:27] his life and sometimes had breathing
[23:29] problems he is now again hospitalized
[23:31] for breathing difficulties
[23:34] please join me in prayer of faith for
[23:37] his absolute healing so she's asking
[23:39] prayer for her grandson
[23:42] I also pray for brother Christian
[23:45] Mackie I believe he's also sick
[23:47] but I have a testimony tonight
[23:51] God's the same
[23:53] he never changes
[23:55] a few days ago my father-in-law started
[23:58] feeling really sick
[24:00] he had a really heavy pain in his chest
[24:03] and they took him to the emergency room
[24:04] he was actually
[24:06] he was claimed he couldn't move and they
[24:08] had to take a wheelchair to take him in
[24:10] and so they did tests for two days
[24:12] trying to figure out what's wrong with
[24:14] him
[24:16] yesterday did the test today
[24:19] and the Lord put it on my heart where me
[24:21] and Holly just went and prayed for him
[24:23] and we just heard a few hours ago right
[24:25] before serves that they released him to
[24:27] go home
[24:33] the scripture says that perfect love
[24:36] casteth out fear
[24:39] amen and fear has no torment
[24:42] because love is him amen
[24:45] if you have a prayer upon your heart
[24:47] tonight
[24:48] you can raise it before him
[24:49] [Music]
[24:51] amen brother Matthew if you just want to
[24:54] come lead us tonight in prayer
[24:56] [Music]
[25:06] thank you
[25:09] [Music]
[25:14] now why don't we just stand together
[25:18] maybe if you have an unspoken request
[25:21] and you just want to lift your hand
[25:24] before the Lord
[25:26] Lord Jesus we just approach you
[25:30] pleading the blood of Jesus Christ
[25:32] knowing that that's the provided place
[25:35] of worship for the believer
[25:38] that if we can come under that blood and
[25:40] that atonement
[25:42] it's there we find forgiveness it's
[25:44] there we find Grace there we find Mercy
[25:47] Lord
[25:49] so Lord we just ask that you'd forgive
[25:51] us for all sin all in belief
[25:54] our iniquity Lord the sins that so
[25:56] easily beset us
[25:58] [Music]
[26:00] we plead your blood Lord
[26:03] and we're so thankful that there's power
[26:06] in the blood
[26:07] it washes away our sins
[26:11] cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[26:14] and Lord by faith we can approach you
[26:16] now with a boldness knowing that we're
[26:19] redeemed knowing that we're Justified
[26:22] knowing that we never did it in the
[26:24] first place
[26:26] and Lord we've received a word to
[26:28] produce a perfect faith in this hour
[26:30] that we can believe all things Lord
[26:34] I think of this little baby just maybe
[26:36] six months old
[26:38] that baby can't have faith for itself
[26:41] but you're believing children Lord
[26:45] your word says that by your stripes we
[26:48] are healed
[26:50] and father we bind our hearts together
[26:52] right now in the name of the Lord
[26:55] father we send the Holy Ghost to this
[26:57] little one may you touch it in a
[26:59] supernatural way may the doctors be
[27:02] astounded May the parents be astounded
[27:04] Lord may you give words to Sister Gail
[27:07] that they might know that Jesus Christ
[27:09] is alive he's resurrected amongst his
[27:12] people once again the same yesterday
[27:14] today and forever Lord even as brother
[27:17] Cosman testified Lord You're risen
[27:20] amongst us father so we can approach you
[27:23] with these petitions and know that we
[27:25] shall have what we have need of Lord
[27:27] because you're here proving it you're
[27:29] here showing it Lord you're not a dead
[27:31] God but you're alive Lord You're present
[27:34] now right here amongst us Lord
[27:36] so Lord we pray for
[27:40] Christian who's at home Lord
[27:44] maybe he's here father I have not seen
[27:46] him but Lord there's an infirmity in his
[27:49] body
[27:50] Lord we rebuke that Devil
[27:53] he's a redeemed Son of God and we say
[27:56] take your hands off of him in the name
[27:58] of Jesus Christ that he come back to the
[28:01] house of God Lord for all these hands
[28:03] that were lifted up as an unspoken
[28:05] prayer request Lord you know the heart
[28:09] you're still Discerning the thoughts and
[28:11] intents of the heart today
[28:13] and you're right here now amongst us
[28:16] father so we pray Lord that by the
[28:19] preaching of the word you would go to
[28:20] each heart each soul lord each family
[28:23] member that was represented by that
[28:25] uplifted hand father and may you just

[37:55] [Music]
[37:57] in my savior
[38:05] [Music]
[38:12] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[38:17] father when I
[38:20] heard your messenger say that all of
[38:22] that
[38:24] God was he poured into Christ
[38:27] and all what Christ was he poured into
[38:30] the church
[38:32] father I heard that again and I thought
[38:35] oh I need to know that
[38:37] I need to understand that
[38:40] I need to have a greater revelation
[38:44] and father that's why we're here tonight
[38:47] that we might come to a greater
[38:50] realization of what that you have
[38:53] in mind for your children
[38:56] Lord we ask that you would bless us this
[38:59] evening and be with us in Jesus precious
[39:02] and holy name we pray
[39:05] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[39:08] just a moment this evening and
[39:13] I don't know if
[39:15] if Joseph and grace are here are you in
[39:18] here
[39:19] no yes no
[39:21] I guess they're not here
[39:24] as well anyway they're probably getting
[39:26] ready to get married
[39:28] and which is certainly uh an all right
[39:32] thing to do but I I just I I wanted just
[39:36] to say a few things about
[39:39] Grace
[39:41] and Joseph is a really fine brother I
[39:45] don't know him well but I I really watch
[39:48] grace through
[39:50] life and she's always been such a
[39:53] a shining the light you know somebody
[39:56] that you could just trust and know
[39:58] wherever she was out or wherever she was
[40:01] she was just living and shining the
[40:04] gospel
[40:05] of the Lord
[40:07] and
[40:08] and so she'll be leaving us of course
[40:12] you know her husband will take her away
[40:15] and and so I mean this will be the
[40:19] second grace that I've lost
[40:21] and but I know we're getting a Grace so
[40:24] the Lord's good but so I just want to
[40:28] let you know don't name your girl's
[40:29] Grace
[40:31] no I haven't had anything
[40:35] but anyway uh I just wanted to say I'm
[40:39] just really happy for him and and
[40:41] everything so
[40:43] um uh there's
[40:45] a a kind of a reason
[40:48] on my heart tonight that I want to
[40:51] share with you before we open the
[40:54] scriptures and and
[40:57] uh just to kind of tell you
[41:01] um what's on my heart and the direction
[41:03] that I'm going in and what that I
[41:08] sensing and and you may be going through
[41:11] this too but
[41:13] um
[41:15] I just don't think that we can just
[41:17] survive
[41:20] uh
[41:21] letting Satan beat on us all the time
[41:26] you know what I mean
[41:27] um
[41:28] and uh just you know where all you see
[41:34] is the times getting worse and the world
[41:38] falling apart and and uh and everything
[41:42] just gets so Dreadful and and and you
[41:47] just can't uh stand it um and and
[41:52] there's a a great
[41:55] uh his Spirit of hopelessness
[41:59] and if you can make people feel hopeless
[42:03] they will look for something that they
[42:06] can rely on
[42:08] right that's just how man is
[42:12] the prophet of God said if you get a
[42:14] person hungry enough
[42:16] they'll eat out of a garbage can
[42:19] and I thank the Lord I've never been
[42:22] that hungry but I have been hungry
[42:25] before
[42:27] but there's there's just you know we
[42:31] just can't uh
[42:34] let Satan's Army
[42:38] uh just keep bringing because this is
[42:42] what he brings he brings uh he brings
[42:45] destruction I think that's what the
[42:48] prophet of God describes in the message
[42:51] the greatest battle ever fought he says
[42:54] that Satan's Army brings destructness
[42:57] sickness death
[42:58] and he just battles your mind all the
[43:01] time
[43:02] and so I I just see people and and and
[43:08] this continuous
[43:11] oppression that putting on not only us
[43:16] as Believers you think we've got it bad
[43:20] because there's 200 000 demon demons
[43:23] loosed on us
[43:24] you know but you just look at the world
[43:27] too
[43:28] I mean without hope they just have this
[43:32] continuous uh bombardment and so I on my
[43:38] heart I I just uh have just been
[43:42] thinking in My Heart Lord what is our
[43:45] answer
[43:47] to these things and it brought me to
[43:51] this message that I I want to just
[43:56] minister to you tonight out of in and
[43:59] read a few quotes to and
[44:02] and hope it'll lift your heart this
[44:05] evening so I just want to share a little
[44:07] bit out of this message that's called
[44:10] works is Faith expressed
[44:14] and I begin to see something in there
[44:17] like I've never seen before
[44:22] um
[44:23] and I thought well this seems like a
[44:25] type of message that would have been
[44:28] maybe preached earlier in brother
[44:31] branham's Ministry but it was preached
[44:34] in November of 65.
[44:37] and many of us who look at the message
[44:40] and and hear statements that brother
[44:43] Branham made brother Brandon made a
[44:46] statement he says a man knows when God's
[44:49] fixing to call him home
[44:51] he's got that sense I
[44:54] um
[44:55] thankfully I have an experience that yet
[44:59] but someday I will if the Lord tarries
[45:03] and if it's not for death I will
[45:06] experience for the rapture
[45:09] but so I think that towards the end of
[45:14] his ministry
[45:16] there's a whole series of messages he
[45:19] starts to give especially in
[45:22] 1965. now let there be no mistake I
[45:25] believe all the messages the word of God
[45:28] and just a valuable from 1940 to
[45:32] 1965. I I don't believe that the message
[45:36] changed any I know it moved into a
[45:40] different pull but everything was
[45:43] perfectly laid out by God every aspect
[45:47] of it every reason he only gave us what
[45:51] we could eat he nursed us like babies he
[45:55] gave us milk through the first poll and
[45:58] the second poll and then finally when it
[46:00] came time he started laying up meat he
[46:03] didn't feed us all the meat he stored it
[46:06] up for us
[46:08] amen he had the vision store it up and
[46:12] so there's a great Storehouse of uh of
[46:16] things that are stored up so this
[46:19] message took on the new significance to
[46:22] me simply because of the
[46:26] of where it's placed
[46:28] in the
[46:29] sermons and I began to realize there's
[46:32] something in this message that he's
[46:35] trying to get across to his church and
[46:39] and there's something in my heart that's
[46:42] burning and this begins to make contact
[46:45] with that so let us open our Bibles and
[46:49] let's stand and and I just want to read
[46:52] a couple's scriptures
[46:55] um there's so many scriptures that we
[46:59] could read but I want to read out of
[47:01] Hebrews the sixth chapter
[47:04] and
[47:06] and
[47:17] he makes this statement and
[47:21] um
[47:22] sometimes it's good when you sit down to
[47:24] read like The Book of Hebrews that you
[47:27] read it from beginning to end as one
[47:29] letter
[47:30] you know and we always have a tendency
[47:33] to break out chapters but if you kind of
[47:36] get a theme then you can understand what
[47:38] he's what he's pointing to here in
[47:41] chapter six he jumps over into chapter
[47:44] 11. and picks it up after he covers some
[47:48] things in between but he picks it up
[47:51] what the Perfection is
[47:53] he says therefore leaving the principles
[47:56] of the doctrine of Christ
[48:00] let us go on
[48:02] unto
[48:03] perfection
[48:06] not laying again the foundations of
[48:09] repentance from dead works and Faith
[48:13] towards God
[48:15] of the doctrines of baptism of laying on
[48:19] of hands and of the resurrection of the
[48:22] dead and of Eternal judgment and this we
[48:26] will do if God so
[48:30] permit
[48:31] so they want to turn there and then I
[48:35] also want to turn over to James
[48:42] which is just the next book after
[48:46] uh
[48:47] Hebrews and I just want to read one
[48:50] scripture there
[48:52] the 17th and 18th verse
[48:57] it said even so faith
[49:01] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[49:10] so we we don't want our faith to be
[49:13] alone
[49:15] and he says yea a man may say doubt hath
[49:19] faith
[49:21] and I have works
[49:23] show me thy faith without thy works and
[49:28] I will show thee my faith by my Works
[49:33] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[49:35] word to us in Jesus precious name we
[49:39] pray amen amen God bless you may be
[49:42] seated
[49:47] I I like what
[49:51] the
[49:53] Paul says here and it yeah and James
[49:57] says that it certainly could be
[50:02] misunderstood and misdirected and I'm
[50:05] certainly I don't want to go into the
[50:08] all the aspects of dividing them
[50:11] scriptures
[50:13] but I I've come to the place where
[50:20] I just don't want to keep hashing over
[50:23] what I believe
[50:25] you know what I mean I mean I I could
[50:28] preach a sermon tonight about you being
[50:30] the bride and the the son of man
[50:34] Ministry and how deity came in flesh in
[50:37] our day and dwelt in the prophet of God
[50:40] and how he was totally Vindicated and
[50:43] how the seals were open and the Word was
[50:46] broken to us and and and how that were
[50:52] elected and and how that were were
[50:56] chosen and how our names were written on
[51:00] the Lamb's Book of Life and we could go
[51:02] over all that uh once again and I would
[51:07] think looking out here this evening that
[51:11] you all believe that I mean every head
[51:15] will nod everybody loves to hear that
[51:18] they're eternally secure
[51:21] everybody loves to know that uh that I'm
[51:25] in his hands and everything's good and
[51:29] uh and Paul talks about a Perfection
[51:34] that goes on past that
[51:38] and in my heart I I I'm just so Desiring
[51:43] that uh that my that what what did he
[51:49] have in mind
[51:51] when he spoke in Ephesians and he says
[51:54] we are his workmanship in Christ Jesus
[51:59] foreordained unto good works that we
[52:03] should walk in them
[52:05] and we we talked about the the word of
[52:09] God how that uh
[52:12] uh as we look about our election and we
[52:16] know we're elected and we know we're
[52:20] chosen
[52:21] if can you imagine that all that is been
[52:26] spoken to us for a reason
[52:29] God has a reason for everything that he
[52:33] does
[52:34] he had a reason for every sermon that he
[52:38] had his messenger preach
[52:40] he had a reason why that he put them in
[52:44] the order that he put them in he he
[52:48] there was something that he was trying
[52:51] to tell us and and he was delivering to
[52:55] us a message
[52:57] Nick it wasn't a book of theology it
[53:01] wasn't uh it wasn't just straightening
[53:04] out everybody and giving us his
[53:08] interpretation of the message because
[53:11] this is a love letter to you if it's
[53:16] something that he's trying to
[53:18] uh uh get to you or get across to you or
[53:24] deliver to you so what the the message
[53:28] isn't just given
[53:31] to remain intellectual
[53:34] it's not given just to be discussed
[53:37] though I love discussing it
[53:40] but it's given because it possesses a
[53:45] substance
[53:47] that can be possessed
[53:52] there's something that he's preaching
[53:56] that the church world doesn't know
[53:59] that you didn't know and I didn't know
[54:04] and and just to say this humbly when I
[54:08] recognize that the prophet of God was a
[54:12] prophet that he had a message
[54:15] when I read Christ The Mystery of God
[54:17] revealed and then I saw that deity
[54:21] standing there in that Ministry of the
[54:25] son of man that didn't mean that I knew
[54:30] all that he was trying to get to me
[54:36] so it wasn't I've got the revelation
[54:40] or belief
[54:42] and now I've I have
[54:46] all that God's done
[54:49] God sent a prophet I believe that he
[54:52] opened the seals I believe that he was a
[54:54] seventh Church age messenger uh I
[54:57] believe that and and so there there's
[55:01] there's there's something that's talked
[55:03] about
[55:04] that the believer can establish that
[55:09] and then move on from that into a
[55:15] perfection
[55:16] and that's what strikes me we talk about
[55:21] the chief offering and the first fruit
[55:25] and how he was ripened but whatever a
[55:29] life
[55:30] that it was that came up through this
[55:33] stock that came up through these Church
[55:35] ages that came up that came into him and
[55:40] and that he possessed because he went
[55:43] through the polls
[55:46] he uh I know this I hope I can say this
[55:51] in a way that isn't offensive in any way
[55:55] but but he grew
[55:58] as he went along
[56:00] uh well I might use this statement to
[56:04] help explain it better
[56:06] if and this is in this message works is
[56:09] faith
[56:10] expressed paragraph 99 he says well
[56:13] that's the same way with preaching
[56:16] Divine Healing or anything else
[56:21] as you go along you begin to learn
[56:25] if you don't learn there's something
[56:29] wrong
[56:30] see you've got to learn and you've got
[56:34] to learn how to accept God and what it
[56:39] really means
[56:42] so you you've got to learn you've got to
[56:45] grow in to uh the acceptance of what it
[56:52] is that God is trying to do
[56:56] and so a lot of times we talk about
[57:00] faith and you know and we say things
[57:04] like this we allow sometimes we'll say
[57:07] this guy didn't have enough Faith this
[57:09] guy didn't do this and this and there's
[57:12] a reason there for that there's a reason
[57:16] for it
[57:17] so sometimes he said it's unconfessed
[57:20] sin so much other things but so there's
[57:24] there's something that's
[57:27] lying out there
[57:30] and I don't want to sit back and try to
[57:34] explain what it is or what that I think
[57:37] it is
[57:38] okay I just want to say I believe
[57:42] there's something greater for us
[57:47] and not to put it in the form of a
[57:50] Revival
[57:51] not could put it in a move of some
[57:54] movement but there's something that God
[57:58] has got for each of us individuals a
[58:01] Perfection of maturity something that
[58:05] we're learning and moving into because
[58:08] we can't sit in this state of being a
[58:13] punching bag for the devil
[58:19] you know what I mean I mean in other
[58:21] words we we've got to to finally come to
[58:27] the the place wait a minute he didn't
[58:31] put me here
[58:32] for this he had a purpose he had
[58:36] something he wanted to express and again
[58:39] so we begin to uh even look at the basic
[58:46] a description
[58:49] of Malachi 4 5. and that it was that God
[58:54] was going to send us Elijah the prophet
[58:57] to restore back to us the faith that our
[59:01] fathers had
[59:03] so there was there was a revelation
[59:08] that he was trying to get across to us
[59:13] and that uh that was to to grow
[59:20] in us as believers and so I think that
[59:24] we know that without faith it's
[59:28] impossible to please God and we read
[59:31] this scripture I believe it was in
[59:33] Hebrews I think it may I forget exactly
[59:37] what
[59:38] verse that it was but we spoke about
[59:41] Enoch
[59:42] and he said by by faith Enoch was
[59:46] translated
[59:47] now every time that God does anything
[59:51] he's got to do it the same way
[59:55] so he's got to translate this church by
[59:59] faith also
[1:00:02] could you understand he can't he can't
[1:00:05] do Enoch one way and somebody else one
[1:00:08] way that's why we know as a believer
[1:00:11] that if anybody approaches God on the
[1:00:16] same terms that anybody else approached
[1:00:19] him on
[1:00:21] then God has to respond the same way
[1:00:24] Elsie responded wrong the first time
[1:00:28] that's why it's so important to read
[1:00:31] your Bible about those stories of Faith
[1:00:34] how that they approach God what took
[1:00:37] place in their life and when that you
[1:00:41] can grasp a hold of those things then
[1:00:44] you can learn
[1:00:47] some of us just don't learn
[1:00:52] you know and and I don't need to give
[1:00:55] you the definition of insanity
[1:00:59] but uh
[1:01:03] so there there's
[1:01:06] just something that uh
[1:01:10] that there's a substance out there
[1:01:14] and I'm I'm
[1:01:17] striving for this along with you
[1:01:21] Paul makes a statement in the scriptures
[1:01:24] he says I'm not saying as if I have
[1:01:27] obtained
[1:01:28] you know what I mean but uh if if God's
[1:01:32] moving
[1:01:34] and he can speak to us I believe that
[1:01:37] that we could move together
[1:01:40] that we can grow together I don't
[1:01:43] believe in nickelodeonism where the
[1:01:46] minister sets himself up above the
[1:01:49] people like I I've obtained all these
[1:01:52] great things and you poor pathetic
[1:01:55] people you better listen to my great
[1:01:58] Fountain of wisdom you know what I mean
[1:02:02] I I believe that when we sit down to a
[1:02:05] meal we all eat together
[1:02:08] we say grace together
[1:02:10] you know what I mean and remember the
[1:02:13] guy that's doing all the Talking at a
[1:02:15] dinner table doesn't get very much food
[1:02:20] I would rather just dig in and eat
[1:02:23] on God's word amen so we're feasting
[1:02:26] together this evening now we always
[1:02:30] refer to as faith
[1:02:34] faith is a big word that
[1:02:38] is kind of uh maybe misunderstood a lot
[1:02:44] because
[1:02:46] believing in faith is not the same thing
[1:02:53] faith is not a belief system
[1:02:58] you know what I mean or articles
[1:03:02] of doctrine that we agree on
[1:03:05] I believe this
[1:03:07] I believe that
[1:03:10] the other day somebody was wanting me to
[1:03:12] explain and I sat there and I started
[1:03:14] said well we believe this and we believe
[1:03:16] this and we believe that and I I just
[1:03:19] got I stopped them and I said well wait
[1:03:21] a minute that's really not what I
[1:03:23] believe
[1:03:24] what I believe is Jesus Christ is
[1:03:27] present right now to do exceedingly and
[1:03:30] abundantly above what I can even ask her
[1:03:32] thanks
[1:03:35] and that was the Super sign
[1:03:38] the super sign was a virgin shall
[1:03:41] conceive in other words I'll be with you
[1:03:44] even in you tilled again the end I will
[1:03:48] not leave you comfortless but I personal
[1:03:51] pronoun will come again and I will be
[1:03:55] there with you I will not leave you I
[1:03:58] will not forsake you I I will be there
[1:04:02] for you
[1:04:03] and I I I I feel that's one of the great
[1:04:07] things that Satan is trying to Blind the
[1:04:10] church from by looking in the mirror it
[1:04:14] is just causing us to not be able to
[1:04:17] come to that spot
[1:04:19] so we substitute a false definition
[1:04:25] for faith
[1:04:27] and Faith becomes what we doctrinally
[1:04:30] believe what we believe
[1:04:34] and we have 111 messages that are a
[1:04:39] thousand uh 100 I believe 1100 or so
[1:04:42] that we can go through and say I believe
[1:04:45] this I believe that I believe this I
[1:04:48] believe that and we have Great
[1:04:50] Fellowship in that and and and I'm not
[1:04:53] against that and and so many means but
[1:04:56] faith is really something different
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:00] so I I'm trying to move to something
[1:05:03] because I I don't want like I said to
[1:05:07] just be stuck and be battling and
[1:05:12] building a wall up so that hoping that
[1:05:17] Satan doesn't penetrate it
[1:05:21] you know I don't want to hold the fort
[1:05:28] because James says that that faith
[1:05:34] without works is dead that kind of faith
[1:05:39] is dead
[1:05:40] and and it's it I don't take that like
[1:05:44] it it you don't believe it and you don't
[1:05:46] have it but what he's saying is that
[1:05:49] kind of Faith
[1:05:51] it's not working
[1:05:56] it's not working
[1:05:58] it's not accomplishing anything it's not
[1:06:01] doing anything so there's got to be a
[1:06:04] different faith that he's wanting us to
[1:06:08] have and a greater understanding and so
[1:06:11] I think that he's been bringing this to
[1:06:15] us
[1:06:17] by
[1:06:18] bringing us the message by bringing the
[1:06:21] messenger because we know that the
[1:06:23] teaching Reign has to come before the
[1:06:25] latter rain and so there's we we have to
[1:06:28] learn
[1:06:30] you know I can sometimes I I sit back
[1:06:32] and I don't think that that we've really
[1:06:35] got all the lessons but he's so patient
[1:06:39] with us and so long suffering with us
[1:06:42] and it has such regard for us as his
[1:06:47] children that he keeps reminding us and
[1:06:50] reminding us trying to bring us along
[1:06:53] and trying to get us to grow to a
[1:06:57] greater State and leave behind the idea
[1:07:02] that faith is what I I believe
[1:07:07] Faith Comes fresh
[1:07:11] faith is fresh manna
[1:07:16] it's fresh
[1:07:18] it's new
[1:07:20] it's it's living
[1:07:23] and I'm not talking about sound Doctrine
[1:07:27] he said we're not laying again the
[1:07:30] principles of sound Doctrine water
[1:07:32] baptism of the opening of the seals the
[1:07:36] church age Messengers the godhead
[1:07:38] explain we're not laying on again the
[1:07:42] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:44] Spirit we're not laying those but we're
[1:07:47] moving into something that's more
[1:07:49] perfect for the believer something
[1:07:52] that's more real more fresh more living
[1:07:56] more active
[1:08:01] something that's so genuine that it's
[1:08:04] unshakable
[1:08:06] and undeniable
[1:08:10] so let's just if you help me here I'm
[1:08:14] going to read out a paragraph
[1:08:17] and I know we say these things all over
[1:08:19] and over and over again but there just
[1:08:21] comes a time where the spirit of God
[1:08:24] just cracks it open for you and you just
[1:08:27] get a little more light
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:30] just like a scripture all of a sudden
[1:08:33] takes on a new meaning for you
[1:08:37] so never read your Bible thinking you
[1:08:39] know what it says
[1:08:43] I don't read the Bible I read read 20
[1:08:46] years ago
[1:08:49] that was all marked in yellow
[1:08:51] and now it's been marked in blue and
[1:08:54] it's been marked in red now it's been
[1:08:56] underlined now words are circled and
[1:09:00] pretty soon the Bible's old and I have
[1:09:02] to get a new one because it's full of
[1:09:04] fresh manna
[1:09:07] okay
[1:09:08] so this is what he says now Faith is a
[1:09:11] revelation from God
[1:09:16] now just listen oh we know Faith's a
[1:09:18] revelation the church is built on
[1:09:20] Revelation but do we really understand
[1:09:24] that
[1:09:26] now Faith is a revelation there's where
[1:09:30] I want to stay
[1:09:33] they're just a moment
[1:09:36] now there's a need
[1:09:39] for him to stay there Now understand now
[1:09:43] he's not
[1:09:46] trying to give us
[1:09:48] some doctrinal truths
[1:09:51] he's trying to actually create in US
[1:09:56] by the word of God
[1:09:59] a mind like Jesus had
[1:10:04] let this mind be in you
[1:10:07] that was in him
[1:10:10] he's actually trying to get the spirit
[1:10:14] that Jesus had
[1:10:17] in you
[1:10:19] because if the same spirit that was in
[1:10:22] him dwelleth in you it will also Quicken
[1:10:26] your mortal bodies what does Quicken
[1:10:29] mean means make a lie
[1:10:33] don't think that's the rapture
[1:10:38] you've got to be made alive before the
[1:10:41] rapture
[1:10:44] you've got to be quickened you've got
[1:10:47] the word has got to come alive
[1:10:51] and that's not done through Doctrine
[1:10:55] that's why Paul said let us move on to
[1:10:57] Perfection let us leave those things
[1:10:58] behind let us move on there's something
[1:11:01] else here that the elders obtained a
[1:11:04] good report by that without it's
[1:11:07] impossible to please God in fact he even
[1:11:09] comes down when he talks about Enoch he
[1:11:12] says he had this testimony before he was
[1:11:16] translated that he pleased god without
[1:11:20] faith it's impossible to please God put
[1:11:24] them together don't break those
[1:11:25] scriptures up Enoch was translated
[1:11:28] because he had faith
[1:11:33] and what is it that he's trying to get
[1:11:35] to us
[1:11:37] is a real faith
[1:11:42] so
[1:11:43] he says
[1:11:45] now I want to say that in just a moment
[1:11:47] it's a revelation
[1:11:50] he has revealed it to you by his grace
[1:11:57] Faye Revelation is something that's been
[1:12:00] hid from you
[1:12:02] and now is made known to you
[1:12:08] you can get a revelation of an ant pile
[1:12:14] you didn't know those fire ants were
[1:12:16] there but all of a sudden you become
[1:12:19] aware and you completely realize that
[1:12:23] those ants are there they exist it's
[1:12:26] real it's exactly the way it is
[1:12:30] now there's a difference in believing
[1:12:32] there's red ants in your backyard and
[1:12:34] coming in contact with them
[1:12:40] I don't know why I came up with that
[1:12:42] analogy it don't seem very spiritual but
[1:12:45] sometimes we just gotta get bit
[1:12:51] he said
[1:12:52] he said
[1:12:54] he has revealed it to you by his grace
[1:12:59] it's nothing you
[1:13:03] did
[1:13:09] so it's not
[1:13:11] I believe
[1:13:14] I believe I believe this I saw this I
[1:13:17] saw that this was opened up to me
[1:13:24] it's beyond that
[1:13:26] it's something that he he said he did so
[1:13:32] let me bring it in present tense not
[1:13:34] changing the quote it's something he's
[1:13:36] doing
[1:13:40] the church is built on what
[1:13:42] revelation
[1:13:44] God moves his church
[1:13:47] by Revelation he changes lives by
[1:13:51] Revelation not by your increase in
[1:13:54] Doctrine
[1:13:55] not by your increase of the Mysteries
[1:13:58] and the teachings that you continually
[1:14:01] to learn
[1:14:04] but it's an active participation
[1:14:09] of God in your life
[1:14:12] speaking directly to you and showing you
[1:14:17] things personally
[1:14:22] it is not a group
[1:14:25] revelation
[1:14:31] because sometimes you do things that
[1:14:33] nobody else does
[1:14:37] so it's it's and it's by grace
[1:14:41] you didn't work yourself up into faith
[1:14:49] notice you didn't read the book
[1:14:51] you didn't read the promises
[1:14:54] you didn't do it
[1:14:56] there's something that took place you
[1:14:58] read the word
[1:15:00] God by Revelation quickened that word to
[1:15:04] you
[1:15:04] by his Spirit by Grace right the word
[1:15:08] don't Quicken
[1:15:10] the spirit quickens you read the word
[1:15:13] and by Revelation he made that word a
[1:15:18] reality to you
[1:15:20] not an understanding
[1:15:24] not a piece of a puzzle
[1:15:27] he made it a reality
[1:15:31] not a perception but the word now
[1:15:35] becomes reality
[1:15:38] it is what is
[1:15:43] you can't work yourself into that
[1:15:49] that's why you pray for it
[1:15:55] if you ever have faith
[1:15:58] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:16:05] now the church is absolutely wearing
[1:16:09] itself out
[1:16:12] preachers just keep thinking
[1:16:15] maybe I shouldn't say that
[1:16:18] maybe I keep thinking that if I keep
[1:16:22] pounding you with the doctrine keep
[1:16:24] pounding you with the Revelation keep
[1:16:26] teaching the Malachi 4 5. keep teaching
[1:16:30] the opening of the seals keep teaching
[1:16:32] the doctrine keep teaching the son of
[1:16:34] man keep talking all those things to you
[1:16:37] explaining it this way and explaining it
[1:16:40] that way somehow you're going to get
[1:16:43] Faith
[1:16:44] you're not
[1:16:48] you're not you're not going to give
[1:16:50] faith that way
[1:16:51] faith is given to you by God personally
[1:16:55] and it's by his grace
[1:17:00] and we're substituting
[1:17:04] education
[1:17:06] emotion
[1:17:09] teaching Doctrine
[1:17:11] self
[1:17:13] belief and group belief as being our
[1:17:18] faith
[1:17:19] we believe that God sent a messenger
[1:17:23] fine
[1:17:25] show me that faith
[1:17:34] the best most of us could do is have an
[1:17:37] intellectual argument with someone that
[1:17:39] don't believe
[1:17:41] then we Pat ourselves on the back and
[1:17:43] come away man I won that argument
[1:17:48] that guy he couldn't stand up to what I
[1:17:50] said and all you're doing is throwing
[1:17:52] out things that brother Branham thrown
[1:17:54] out not for him right but for you and
[1:17:59] the Very fact that you're in that
[1:18:01] argument shows you didn't get what he
[1:18:03] was saying
[1:18:07] am I okay
[1:18:10] okay God reveals it to you therefore
[1:18:14] faith is a revelation
[1:18:16] and the whole Church of God is built
[1:18:19] upon the revelation
[1:18:21] and we could just
[1:18:24] uh
[1:18:26] go down here and
[1:18:28] uh
[1:18:29] maybe 114 just to read this he says now
[1:18:33] he talking about the Protestant says
[1:18:36] it's Jesus and the and the Catholic said
[1:18:39] it's Peter and he says now they could be
[1:18:42] right but to me they're both of them
[1:18:45] it's wrong
[1:18:46] it was upon spiritual revelation of who
[1:18:50] he was Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:18:53] this to you
[1:18:55] Peter but my Father which is in heaven
[1:18:59] hath revealed this to you Upon This Rock
[1:19:03] in other words the whole church is built
[1:19:07] on the whole church is going to grow by
[1:19:09] the whole church is going to go forward
[1:19:12] by God personally
[1:19:15] revealing to you
[1:19:18] not only Doctrine
[1:19:22] or teaching
[1:19:24] but all things
[1:19:26] concerning life
[1:19:32] God revealing to you so much so
[1:19:35] that the prophet of God made this
[1:19:37] statement and I know we throw it out all
[1:19:40] the time and we put it in our thing but
[1:19:43] every time we make this statement
[1:19:46] in our Consciousness we're always
[1:19:49] thinking about it in the realm of
[1:19:51] Doctrine teaching message books and
[1:19:54] tapes but he said the bride does nothing
[1:19:57] until she has thus saith the Lord
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:06] another God told me
[1:20:08] God spoke to me and oh we get so scared
[1:20:13] of getting to that place because we
[1:20:16] think that we're going to be attacked or
[1:20:18] our belief structure is going to be
[1:20:20] attacked
[1:20:23] or someone's going to bombard us with
[1:20:25] quotes
[1:20:27] I've seen people take quotes and Destroy
[1:20:31] more faith than they've ever built up
[1:20:36] maybe I'm getting too personal
[1:20:39] but I gotta move on
[1:20:42] I've got to move out
[1:20:44] I've got to get going I want to know
[1:20:46] what this messenger is talking about
[1:20:52] what does he mean
[1:20:57] works
[1:20:58] is the expression
[1:21:01] of the revelation
[1:21:03] that I have
[1:21:05] and he because he says it it he says
[1:21:08] Upon This Rock the revelation of who he
[1:21:10] is
[1:21:11] it's upon the Revelation he is the word
[1:21:16] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:21:18] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:21:20] against it it shows that the gates of
[1:21:23] hell would be against it
[1:21:27] so he's he's not against your Doctrine
[1:21:30] Because he believes in fears and
[1:21:31] trembles he's against the relationship
[1:21:35] that you personally have with God
[1:21:38] showing you
[1:21:40] and revealing to you and leading you
[1:21:44] oh he'll let you believe everything you
[1:21:47] want
[1:21:49] but don't let God tell you to do
[1:21:52] something
[1:21:55] you know and
[1:21:58] and so let's read
[1:22:01] 117. I'm going to try to move quickly
[1:22:06] he's expressing this trying to draw the
[1:22:10] difference
[1:22:11] between what we call intellectual Faith
[1:22:14] what we call doctrinal Faith teaching
[1:22:17] how many knows that God's A Healer
[1:22:20] we all believe that you believe God's A
[1:22:23] Healer sure you believe God's A Healer
[1:22:27] but that don't get you healed
[1:22:33] like someone says well I'm not sick
[1:22:37] yeah you're sick
[1:22:40] you're sick as a dog
[1:22:43] well God's A Healer
[1:22:46] well show me
[1:22:52] because that's not what we're talking
[1:22:53] about
[1:22:57] we're not we're talking about he's
[1:22:58] talking about something
[1:23:00] moving on to
[1:23:02] if I could tie this into perfect Faith
[1:23:05] but
[1:23:06] you you have your messages and your
[1:23:09] books I'm just sharing my heart with you
[1:23:11] the direction that I'm going in
[1:23:14] personally
[1:23:15] the direction I'd like to lead this
[1:23:17] flock in
[1:23:19] and I I think I'm obligated to let you
[1:23:22] know that
[1:23:24] he says in an audience of people we're a
[1:23:28] prayer line comes through
[1:23:30] you'll find some
[1:23:33] and they were all good people
[1:23:37] they will say their
[1:23:39] there's something that's trying there's
[1:23:43] some that is trying hard to believe it
[1:23:47] trying to work themselves into it
[1:23:53] some just can't do it at all
[1:23:56] and others
[1:23:58] it's just by grace
[1:24:02] it's just given
[1:24:04] to them
[1:24:06] and now there is the difference
[1:24:10] see
[1:24:12] that does it that's the real Revelation
[1:24:16] because faith is a revelation from God
[1:24:20] it must be revealed first
[1:24:26] so you in other words you can see it I
[1:24:30] read it all the time Jesus Christ the
[1:24:33] same yesterday today and forever God's A
[1:24:36] Healer by his stripes we are healed we
[1:24:38] confess that you understand we confess
[1:24:41] it because we believe it that's our
[1:24:43] foundation but once we keep saying that
[1:24:46] one day
[1:24:49] he reveals to you that this is your hour
[1:24:54] of possession
[1:24:57] I've come to fulfill this scripture that
[1:25:03] you've hung on to I've come to fulfill
[1:25:07] it in your life today
[1:25:09] a virgin shall conceive
[1:25:13] every generation a virgin shall conceive
[1:25:16] a virgin shall conceive of urgency but
[1:25:19] one day that word was revealed to the
[1:25:24] predestinated person that was called to
[1:25:27] receive it
[1:25:30] because amen
[1:25:33] and Mary said what
[1:25:36] Let It Be unto me
[1:25:41] according to thy will
[1:25:46] now that's where he's trying to get us
[1:25:47] to
[1:25:50] right not using one another as a crutch
[1:25:53] not using song service not using the
[1:25:56] Fellowship of the church not using our
[1:25:59] programs and all that we've got he's
[1:26:02] trying to rise us up to a higher place
[1:26:09] he said it must be revealed first Jesus
[1:26:12] clearly expressed this when he said no
[1:26:16] man can come to me except the father
[1:26:19] draws him first or reveals me to him
[1:26:23] first
[1:26:25] Revelation is a real action
[1:26:32] it's something that actually takes place
[1:26:37] man it's like grabbing a hold of 277. it
[1:26:41] might look like a wire there but Betty
[1:26:44] when you grab it you know that that
[1:26:47] wire's got life
[1:26:49] it looks like a wire you don't see it
[1:26:52] nobody can explain what electricity is
[1:26:55] nobody's ever been able to Define it
[1:26:58] they know it's electrons and magnets and
[1:27:01] negative pole and negative push but once
[1:27:03] you get a hold of that wire you become
[1:27:06] alive
[1:27:08] or dead
[1:27:15] that's scriptural
[1:27:17] the same word brings some to life and
[1:27:20] kills others
[1:27:28] draws him first
[1:27:30] he says you ought to read this
[1:27:33] is Saint James
[1:27:35] 6 and 14.
[1:27:37] to 46. they didn't know who he was
[1:27:41] they thought he was was just an ordinary
[1:27:45] man
[1:27:46] they thought he just to be as people
[1:27:50] does today some prophet he was a prophet
[1:27:53] but he was an ordinary man but there was
[1:27:57] more than that
[1:28:02] so we we understand that that in
[1:28:06] paragraph 22 he says that Jesus said
[1:28:08] that no man could come to me except my
[1:28:10] father draws them first
[1:28:16] maybe I'm just redundant or maybe I've
[1:28:19] been so far behind you all first for so
[1:28:22] long that I'm just catching up
[1:28:27] but
[1:28:31] we've eliminated the drug
[1:28:38] because we already believe
[1:28:43] I believe God's A Healer if you believe
[1:28:45] God's A Healer then you should be
[1:28:47] looking for the draw
[1:28:48] you should be looking for the Revelation
[1:28:51] you should be looking for the the spark
[1:28:53] you should be looking for it to come to
[1:28:55] pass you don't sit there and say I
[1:28:58] believe God's A Healer and sit there and
[1:29:00] let the letter kill you
[1:29:08] start looking for it you start look at
[1:29:11] you start revealing that well man you
[1:29:14] start walking to it why you know it's
[1:29:17] coming you know it's coming I believe in
[1:29:20] a Rapture that don't mean I'm going to
[1:29:22] get raptured I gotta look for it
[1:29:25] look up your rejection I got to prepare
[1:29:28] for it
[1:29:31] I got to get a faith
[1:29:35] that'll let me possess it
[1:29:40] so he says here
[1:29:42] he says
[1:29:43] draws him first
[1:29:45] and all that the father has given me
[1:29:47] will come to me no man can understand
[1:29:50] who he is or how it is
[1:29:55] who he is or how it
[1:30:00] is
[1:30:04] how it
[1:30:07] is he lays that in there because he's a
[1:30:11] prophet
[1:30:12] he stores it up
[1:30:14] we've got that scripture so already made
[1:30:17] up in our mind that we read it and Buzz
[1:30:20] through it in our preconceived idea and
[1:30:23] we never stop and say wait a minute I
[1:30:26] can't even know how it is
[1:30:33] until I get a revelation
[1:30:36] it's a perception
[1:30:41] it's a perception you're living by
[1:30:44] perception and not by Revelation I'm
[1:30:47] sorry I'm living by perception and not
[1:30:49] Revelation but God show me how it is
[1:30:54] n't that amazing
[1:30:57] no man can understand who he is or how
[1:31:00] it is
[1:31:02] except it be revealed to you by the
[1:31:06] revelation of God
[1:31:08] and then faith in that you'll Act
[1:31:13] accordingly
[1:31:16] and we could go read some more because
[1:31:19] it's also fabulous at paragraph 125 he
[1:31:22] says that's the reason you stagger out
[1:31:25] of these things and stagger into what
[1:31:28] you have now
[1:31:29] it was God leading you to the place
[1:31:33] where he had ordained for you to be
[1:31:39] now listen to this
[1:31:41] if the ground isn't prepared beforehand
[1:31:44] it can't grow
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:53] that's the reason the seed of faith
[1:31:57] when you preach faith
[1:32:00] you see the discernment of the Lord and
[1:32:03] you see what takes place and all the
[1:32:06] gifts of the Bible working people
[1:32:08] working themselves out oh Hallelujah I
[1:32:11] believe it and come up and find
[1:32:14] themselves disappointed see the ground
[1:32:17] has to be for ordained and you know when
[1:32:22] it
[1:32:24] strikes you
[1:32:29] oh I hope
[1:32:31] something's striking you tonight
[1:32:34] it's all I can say
[1:32:36] so you you see that that there's a
[1:32:41] preparation
[1:32:43] that has to be prepared what do you
[1:32:46] think this message has been doing
[1:32:51] we've been believing it and studying it
[1:32:54] and we've never seemed to ever get to
[1:32:57] the place wait a minute this message is
[1:33:00] preparing me the ground has to be
[1:33:02] prepared first in others he can't put in
[1:33:06] what he wants to put in he can't plant
[1:33:09] what he wants to plant he can't have to
[1:33:13] grow what he wants to grow until he
[1:33:16] prepares the ground first
[1:33:22] Lord
[1:33:25] I don't know I've been in this 50 years
[1:33:29] I probably have only let you prepare me
[1:33:31] about a month
[1:33:34] but I know that you got something
[1:33:36] that you want to grow up in me
[1:33:40] I'm going to go along if you have to go
[1:33:42] or you're busy don't let me hold you
[1:33:46] back go ahead feel free
[1:33:48] he said paragraph one chain just seed
[1:33:51] has to have the ground prepared first
[1:33:54] therefore all he foreknew he called
[1:33:58] all he foreknew he predestinated if you
[1:34:02] want to read it it's Romans 8 28-34 and
[1:34:05] also Ephesians 1 1-5 all he foreknew he
[1:34:09] called all he called he justified all he
[1:34:13] justified he has already glorified
[1:34:14] there's nothing out of order we think
[1:34:18] there is but
[1:34:19] look at the scriptures
[1:34:22] it's just hitting exactly the way God's
[1:34:25] word said it would we see the messages
[1:34:28] rejected today isn't that just what the
[1:34:31] scripture said it would do sure all
[1:34:34] these things are ordained of God oh it
[1:34:37] should make you happy that's the trouble
[1:34:39] with we today
[1:34:41] so much differences in Christianity
[1:34:43] alone he just goes on to say a few
[1:34:49] more things there and
[1:34:53] and so I just want to go back
[1:34:58] and I said those things till late
[1:35:02] a foundation because
[1:35:07] we've got to get to a place
[1:35:10] where our faith
[1:35:12] will be a working faith
[1:35:17] of a faith that we can show that we have
[1:35:22] by the actions that are according to the
[1:35:26] revelation
[1:35:30] in there we're just we don't sit back
[1:35:32] but actually now we can actually take
[1:35:37] The Works of God the revelation of God
[1:35:42] and it actually becomes something that
[1:35:45] is no longer in our minds no longer in
[1:35:48] our hearts but it's actually manifested
[1:35:51] in flesh
[1:35:53] now we've all got the idea that the
[1:35:56] words manifested in flesh in other words
[1:35:58] I'm the word I'm the seed you know
[1:36:01] against God in flesh and God's
[1:36:03] manifested in flesh God's manifested in
[1:36:06] his health and you're unfruitful
[1:36:11] that's not
[1:36:12] what our messenger taught us
[1:36:15] that's not even what Jesus taught us he
[1:36:18] says the works that I do the pastor
[1:36:20] shall do also the works that I do the
[1:36:22] preacher shall do also the works that I
[1:36:25] do the Elder shall do also
[1:36:32] so I just Proclaim myself to be one of
[1:36:34] them that's not what it says
[1:36:38] in other words you're not going to do
[1:36:40] anything that he doesn't show you that
[1:36:42] you have a revelation he's got a church
[1:36:45] that he's preparing
[1:36:48] so he can start give him give them
[1:36:51] revelation
[1:36:52] so each of them can play their part a
[1:36:55] body fitted and joined together each one
[1:36:58] plots us playing the need children
[1:37:00] teenagers everybody led to the spirit of
[1:37:04] God by what Revelation Lord speak to my
[1:37:07] heart I believe it I know it but I know
[1:37:10] when it strikes me Let It Strike me Lord
[1:37:13] make this scripture alive let me see it
[1:37:16] lead me have something in my life I'm
[1:37:18] tired of sitting on a dead stump
[1:37:20] believing all the things that I believe
[1:37:23] and not seen any fruit
[1:37:33] people have been in this word for years
[1:37:35] and don't have one convert
[1:37:41] they never knelt down with nobody
[1:37:44] they never took them by the hand and say
[1:37:47] I'd like to lead you to the Lord
[1:37:53] all you're doing is leading them to the
[1:37:55] one that reaches down and touches them
[1:37:59] if you believe he's there
[1:38:01] if you believe he hears his prayer if
[1:38:04] he's shown you
[1:38:09] revealed to you if you lay your hands on
[1:38:13] that sick person they will get well
[1:38:17] I'm almost to the place I just don't
[1:38:20] want to have somebody come up in the
[1:38:23] prayer line me lay my hands I'm going to
[1:38:25] say God's A Healer in everything now you
[1:38:27] go away and be it done according to your
[1:38:30] faith
[1:38:34] I believe there's something there that
[1:38:36] he has for his sons and daughters of God
[1:38:39] that they can confront that situation
[1:38:42] that they possess the Revelation to say
[1:38:45] to that person this ends here
[1:38:52] and not by a workup
[1:38:55] amen not by any motion
[1:38:58] but by a revelation
[1:39:00] and a revelation you you're as cool as a
[1:39:03] cucumber
[1:39:09] I remember sitting in places in big
[1:39:12] meetings and everybody's sending the
[1:39:14] Holy Spirit over here Holy Spirit go
[1:39:16] over here go over there do this do that
[1:39:18] you know yeah
[1:39:21] wait a minute
[1:39:23] Lord reveal to me
[1:39:26] how it is and what you're going to do
[1:39:31] sometimes brother REM said they're not
[1:39:33] going to live
[1:39:37] that would shake a lot of people's faith
[1:39:41] but I don't want the saith my
[1:39:44] inspiration
[1:39:47] now the question I'm trying to ask you
[1:39:49] this morning is it given to us to move
[1:39:52] into that type of faith
[1:39:55] I say yes
[1:39:59] not scolding anybody I'm putting it on
[1:40:02] myself tonight
[1:40:05] I believe there's coming a time because
[1:40:09] we've been prepared
[1:40:11] we've been taught
[1:40:13] we've been
[1:40:15] elected
[1:40:16] we've come to the realization of that
[1:40:19] that now he can impart to us
[1:40:23] you can there's no need be doing a big
[1:40:26] explanation of adoption or taking over
[1:40:29] the thing he simply said it this way the
[1:40:32] works that I do you shall do also
[1:40:35] because I do nothing unless the father
[1:40:38] reveals it to me first
[1:40:41] put those two together
[1:40:44] and then you don't have a church that's
[1:40:46] trying to produce wool you have a church
[1:40:49] that's bearing wool
[1:40:52] am I making sense
[1:40:54] are you with me
[1:40:56] I'll try to close
[1:40:59] because with faith and revelation
[1:41:03] you have an ability to do things by
[1:41:06] faith that can't be done any other way
[1:41:17] by revelation
[1:41:19] you can do things
[1:41:22] that cannot be done any other way things
[1:41:26] that seem impossible
[1:41:30] only have Revelation all things are
[1:41:35] possible
[1:41:39] no negativity you take it out David
[1:41:43] by revelation
[1:41:45] defeated Goliath
[1:41:50] okay amen his faith was expressed by the
[1:41:55] work of killing Goliath
[1:42:00] that's what he said wait a minute
[1:42:02] you uncircumcised Philistine what are
[1:42:05] you trying to do to the five-day armies
[1:42:07] of the Living God
[1:42:09] you can't do this
[1:42:13] he says I'm going to pluck you on the
[1:42:15] tree he said if you pluck me on the tree
[1:42:17] what Samuel told me that I was going to
[1:42:19] be the king of Israel and come into pass
[1:42:21] you're a dead man
[1:42:23] I'm going to cut your head off
[1:42:30] that wasn't words
[1:42:32] because he had the revelation
[1:42:35] the Revelation was expressed because he
[1:42:40] acted accordingly
[1:42:42] now the work came from the revelation
[1:42:46] you can't go reproduce that work
[1:42:50] now you could if you got the Revelation
[1:42:53] then the revelation will produce the
[1:42:55] work but you can't read the story and
[1:42:58] create the Revelation you can read the
[1:43:01] story and pray for the Revelation as for
[1:43:05] the Revelation seek for God to make it
[1:43:08] real to you
[1:43:10] and then act upon it when you know it
[1:43:14] strikes you
[1:43:18] but that's what faith does
[1:43:20] that's what Revelation does he wants a
[1:43:23] church now
[1:43:25] that can come up that he's in such
[1:43:28] personal contact with with such Union in
[1:43:31] that he can start having them do things
[1:43:34] that are seemingly impossible
[1:43:40] that they can express
[1:43:45] by their works
[1:43:47] their revelation
[1:43:50] because if it's not
[1:43:53] expressed
[1:43:55] it's all in you
[1:43:59] and the whole Commission of the church
[1:44:02] was to take it out of you and give it
[1:44:08] so Revelation allows you to do things
[1:44:11] that you couldn't do
[1:44:13] you know
[1:44:15] you know he only did it by faith
[1:44:21] Dave only did what he did by the
[1:44:24] Revelation he had
[1:44:27] he didn't figure out a plan they tried
[1:44:29] to give him a plan
[1:44:33] but he waited until he knew beyond the
[1:44:37] shadow of a doubt God spoke to his heart
[1:44:42] all these Great Men
[1:44:44] Sampson
[1:44:46] what he did he did by faith
[1:44:50] by revelation
[1:44:52] he felt his hair
[1:44:55] he said God Revenge my eyes I told him
[1:44:58] to tie the things up and he did what he
[1:45:01] did Moses did what he did Daniel you can
[1:45:05] just go on and on and on because you
[1:45:09] know like we say you know
[1:45:12] sickness that that has no other hope
[1:45:16] but faith
[1:45:20] it has no other hope the only hope it
[1:45:22] has
[1:45:23] right is God's going to reveal to me and
[1:45:27] make this word come alive in my life
[1:45:29] that's what I'm waiting for
[1:45:32] I'm not going to try to produce it I
[1:45:35] know it's by Grace faith is the evidence
[1:45:37] of things hoped for not yet seen
[1:45:40] you don't make it come to pass it comes
[1:45:43] to pass in his time by his grace you
[1:45:47] just have the great hope so sickness has
[1:45:49] no other hope but faith faith produces
[1:45:54] what was hoped for
[1:45:58] you're hoping for it
[1:46:01] right you've read it you know it's yours
[1:46:05] but you're waiting on something
[1:46:08] you're waiting on the Revelation from
[1:46:11] God to make that real to you by his
[1:46:15] grace that you can say the saith the
[1:46:19] Lord I'm well until then keep hoping
[1:46:23] keep praying keep hanging on
[1:46:28] but he's trying to bring his church from
[1:46:31] that place
[1:46:33] to the place that he can start giving
[1:46:36] them
[1:46:39] the Striking Force
[1:46:41] that you know it's yours and you'll act
[1:46:44] accordingly
[1:46:47] he prepares you to receive revelation
[1:46:51] or as I would call it working faith
[1:46:56] he wants to take all that we've been
[1:46:59] taught
[1:47:00] and all that we believe
[1:47:02] and put it to work
[1:47:06] and it won't be a public show
[1:47:11] it won't be a great big
[1:47:13] movement
[1:47:17] it'll be on the individual
[1:47:20] basis
[1:47:22] you walking into the library
[1:47:25] at school in the spirit of God just
[1:47:28] giving you that Revelation go sit next
[1:47:30] to that girl
[1:47:32] pray for
[1:47:36] you don't know what thought she's in
[1:47:39] but you're a daughter of God
[1:47:42] you're a son of God
[1:47:44] he wants to start taking you because he
[1:47:48] made a promise The Works that I do shall
[1:47:51] you do also the thing is he had to
[1:47:54] prepare the ground
[1:47:57] he had to prepare us he had to give us
[1:47:59] to the place where we really knew what a
[1:48:01] revelation was
[1:48:03] you know what message he preaches right
[1:48:05] along with all this
[1:48:08] doing God of service
[1:48:11] without it being his will
[1:48:13] church this message is fantastic
[1:48:22] get reacquainted with it
[1:48:25] go back into it go back into the
[1:48:28] storehouse
[1:48:29] start asking yourself wait a minute God
[1:48:32] I know you got more for me
[1:48:40] I remember one time I told I told
[1:48:42] somebody I says there's more to this
[1:48:44] message and I'm seeing they used to call
[1:48:46] me a more boy

[1:48:50] well I I'm a more and more boy than I've

[1:54:00] I've had it all right
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:19] but
[1:54:21] yet I understand

[1:55:25] Lord hear my prayer
[1:55:29] of you you know there's a
[1:55:33] a situation that I've come across and
[1:55:37] in life I'm not at Liberty to
[1:55:42] speak all that it is but it's it's a
[1:55:45] good person
[1:55:47] that's in a desperate way
[1:55:51] and I believe that
[1:55:55] God hears prayer
[1:55:58] amen I believe if we would just bow our
[1:56:02] hearts and our head we don't need to
[1:56:03] know what it is for he knows what we
[1:56:06] have need of even before we ask
[1:56:09] but the word of God tells us that we
[1:56:11] have not because we ask not and we ask
[1:56:15] not because we don't believe
[1:56:18] and I believe that God can rescue this
[1:56:21] young person from a very
[1:56:27] tough situation that Satan's put him in
[1:56:31] so right before dismissal I'd like for
[1:56:33] you to join in prayer with me I'd like
[1:56:38] you just to say Lord you know the
[1:56:39] circumstance you know all about it
[1:56:42] Brother David can't tell what it is
[1:56:46] but Lord you know what it is
[1:56:49] and I'm going to join with him because
[1:56:51] we believe that through you all things
[1:56:54] are possible
[1:56:56] Lord and we're we're just knowing that
[1:56:59] you will strike it and do something
[1:57:02] because you said that you would hear our
[1:57:04] prayers
[1:57:06] amen you said wherever two or three
[1:57:08] agreed together Lord that didn't come to
[1:57:10] pass
[1:57:11] Lord sparked the Revelation in our heart
[1:57:13] that we know that it's finished
[1:57:16] let us pray together you all pray would
[1:57:19] you our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:57:22] Lord you know how dark the enemy is

[1:57:34] that we could separate those spirits
[1:57:37] and Lord we can't do it I'm helpless
[1:57:41] the only help I have Lord is the
[1:57:45] is the invitation to bring my petition
[1:57:48] to you
[1:57:50] Lord and you invited me to bring my
[1:57:52] petition to you and to lay it at your

[1:57:57] intercession on my behalf Lord I'm not

[1:58:03] else that's in desperate need and Lord

[1:58:16] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[1:58:19] could even ask her thanks father because
