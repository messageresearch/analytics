[29:59] Psalm 8 4-6 it says what is man that
[30:02] thou art mindful of him
[30:04] and the son of man that thou visit him
[30:07] for thou has made him a little lower
[30:10] than the angels and as crowned him with
[30:13] Glory and Honor
[30:15] what did you deserve to get this Crown
[30:18] of Glory and Honor
[30:20] thou mayest him to have dominion over
[30:23] the works of thy hands he made them and
[30:26] God gave you permission to
[30:28] dictate or have dominion over it thou
[30:31] has put all things under his feet now

[41:56] promised you will do in the midst of the
[41:58] Believers Lord be lifted up tonight Lord
[42:00] we commit what we are and ask such
[42:02] things in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[42:04] pray amen and God bless you want to
[42:07] welcome everyone back in the house of
[42:09] God
[42:10] let's open our Bibles
[42:13] will try not to be too long and
[42:17] Romans chapter
[42:19] 6.
[42:49] yeah let's start reading from verse 12.
[42:53] it says
[42:55] let not sin therefore reign in your
[42:58] mortal body that you should obey it in
[43:02] in the lust of there in the last thereof
[43:05] neither yield your members as
[43:08] instruments of unrighteousness to sin
[43:10] but yield yourself to God and those that
[43:15] are alive from the dead and your members
[43:19] as instruments of righteousness to God
[43:21] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[43:26] don't you believe that isn't that the
[43:28] promise to the believer whatever it is
[43:31] that we're fighting whatever it is that
[43:33] we seem to not be able to get over
[43:35] whatever it is sin cannot have dominion
[43:38] over you this is the word of God it says
[43:42] sin cannot have
[43:45] dominion over you for you are not under
[43:48] the law but under grace what then what
[43:52] shall what shall we well it says shall
[43:55] we sin because we are not under the law
[43:57] but under grace God forbid it says know
[44:01] you not that to whom you yield yourself
[44:04] servants to obey his servant you are to
[44:08] whom you your to whom you obey
[44:13] were for to whom hold on one second
[44:20] 16 know you not that to whom ye yield
[44:24] yourself servants to obey his servant
[44:26] you are to whom ye obey whether is sin
[44:30] to death or
[44:32] of obedience to righteousness but God
[44:36] but by God be thanked that you were the
[44:41] Servants of sin but you are you have
[44:43] obeyed from the heart that from of a
[44:47] Doctrine which was delivered to you
[44:48] being then made free from sin you become
[44:54] the servant of righteousness
[44:56] speak after the manner of man because of
[45:00] the infirmity of your flesh as for as
[45:05] you have yielded your member servant to
[45:08] uncleanliness and to iniquity to Unique
[45:12] to iniquity to iniquity even so now
[45:15] yield your member servant to
[45:17] righteousness to Holiness for when you
[45:21] were the servant of sin you were free
[45:24] from righteousness
[45:25] what fruit had you then in those things
[45:29] whereof you were you you you are now
[45:32] ashamed for the end of those things is
[45:35] death but but now being made free from
[45:39] sin and become servant of God you have
[45:42] your fruits of you have the fruits to
[45:44] Holiness and then Everlasting and then
[45:48] everlasting life
[45:49] it says for the wages of sin is death
[45:52] but the gift of God is eternal life
[45:55] through Christ Jesus our lord father we
[45:58] ask that you bless your word to us in
[45:59] the name of Jesus we pray and ask amen
[46:01] you may have your seats tonight
[46:05] there's just been a couple of things and
[46:09] that Brother David attached on this
[46:11] morning I had a thought in my mind but
[46:14] it completely just went different from
[46:17] what we heard this morning and and we
[46:21] will get there as we progress I want to
[46:24] speak about uh the the end time
[46:27] expression
[46:28] the end time expression we as we
[46:32] understand even as we was described this
[46:34] morning we we could certainly say that
[46:36] we live in the days of Expressions
[46:38] there's so many Expressions out there
[46:42] everybody is have a desire to express
[46:45] something the world is expressing a
[46:47] bunch of things and I want to say this
[46:49] the the the the it's gone so much that
[46:53] things that people used to be ashamed of
[46:56] they no longer ashamed of it they're not
[46:59] ashamed to say what they are whether
[47:01] it's something that changes today to
[47:03] tomorrow they don't really care and and
[47:06] they they just freely expressing
[47:08] themselves what they are and we we
[47:11] understand as the children of God that
[47:13] that's the work of the devil that's what
[47:15] was promised when you take God out of
[47:17] everything all you left off with is
[47:19] chaos people can't agree with anything
[47:22] they seem to today it's it's one thing
[47:25] tomorrow it's another and it seems like
[47:27] they want you to be okay with her
[47:30] expression of whatever they choose to be
[47:32] but your expression is offensive to them
[47:35] so how can it be a free Society where
[47:38] everybody can express themselves
[47:40] whatever they are but your expression is
[47:42] offensive to them so you find out that
[47:44] they are not ashamed to to express and
[47:47] to say what they are and all of those
[47:49] things and I believe as Christians we
[47:51] shouldn't be ashamed of Who We Are one
[47:54] who's been born out of sin and and God
[47:58] has come and this saved your life and
[48:00] they changed your life from what you
[48:02] were to what you are today there's
[48:04] nothing to be ashamed of because the the
[48:07] world is is built in a way where you
[48:11] know there's nothing there's no
[48:13] expectation of God doing something uh
[48:16] people they go about their things all
[48:18] they think of is evil continually as we
[48:21] heard it this morning all they think all
[48:24] of all they have to express is the
[48:26] darkness that surround us because that's
[48:28] the only thing that's left in the world
[48:30] and God is wanting us to be the
[48:33] expression that he promised for us to be
[48:35] in the end time so we have to understand
[48:37] that we are here for the purpose of
[48:40] expression and that is to express God so
[48:43] therefore as the world is not ashamed to
[48:45] express what they are as Believers we
[48:48] shouldn't be ashamed to express what God
[48:50] made us to be and I want to say this
[48:52] it's important important we also realize
[48:54] as Believers of this message that the
[48:57] end time expression is no different from
[48:59] the beginning expression when God came
[49:03] and he created the heavens and the Earth
[49:05] by his word as we know it when he came
[49:07] in he said letter b and he created all
[49:10] of those things and he came he came back
[49:12] and he said let us make men in our image
[49:14] in our likeness that expression is no
[49:17] different from you that are sitting here
[49:19] even as he came in the form of Jesus
[49:22] Christ to come and to die on the cross
[49:24] and to give up of his life so we could
[49:27] be saved and to pay for the sins that we
[49:30] had committed and all of those things
[49:31] that expression is not different from
[49:33] the expression that is sitting here
[49:35] today why because it's the same God
[49:38] fulfilling his word
[49:41] what makes it the same is is the same
[49:43] God who's continually bringing his word
[49:46] to come to pass the vessel may be
[49:48] different the person by which it does it
[49:50] may be different but it's the same God
[49:52] expressing himself so therefore we have
[49:55] to be happy and proud of the expression
[49:58] that God made us so we can know that we
[50:00] are here and the same God who promised
[50:03] for us to be here the same God who
[50:05] fulfill his word in the beginning is
[50:07] here to fulfill his word in the end time
[50:09] so we find out do people are here
[50:12] they're expressing themselves uh what
[50:14] what they like what they dislike the
[50:17] political parties and the sexual
[50:19] orientation and all those things what
[50:21] food they like and what they don't like
[50:23] what what they are and what they are not
[50:25] and we as Believers we have to
[50:28] understand as the prophet will tell us
[50:30] we are the only lights that's left to be
[50:33] made to be manifested in the end time
[50:35] the world is in total darkness as we
[50:39] know that and so we the Prophet will say
[50:42] that it's a time uh even uh but David
[50:46] touched it on it they said it's a time
[50:48] where you know like this no longer
[50:50] enough
[50:51] and I want to say this because when we
[50:54] say that it's got two sides because the
[50:58] prophet tells us that the the world is
[51:00] looking for the true manifestations of
[51:02] sons
[51:04] and that's the scriptures he talks about
[51:06] how nature is groaning for the true
[51:09] manifestation of sun and it says even
[51:12] ourselves the scripture will say we are
[51:14] groaning for the true manifestations of
[51:16] sons and daughters and the world is
[51:18] looking for genuine true Christians
[51:22] so we we as we are the expression we
[51:26] have to understand what kind of
[51:28] expressions are we to be what Venom
[51:31] talks about the story of his friend I
[51:33] believe his name was burnt who went to
[51:35] hand with him who had a whistle that he
[51:37] would uh whistle and call the little uh
[51:40] uh uh uh fund and he will come out and
[51:42] he wanted to shoot him and he said he
[51:45] will come he had no pity he had no
[51:47] remorse or any form of uh uh sadness
[51:51] towards doing things like that and then
[51:53] he said he will blow on and then he says
[51:55] the Fawn came and he said then the
[51:57] mother dear when he heard that she said
[51:59] she came and he looked at him he saw
[52:01] that he was ready to shoot him but he
[52:03] looked at him right in the face why
[52:05] because the mother dear heard the voice
[52:07] of a little one and he couldn't help it
[52:09] and he said that action by itself
[52:12] changed him why because he saw something
[52:15] that was real
[52:17] and I want to say this let's be real as
[52:20] Christians we we are not interested in
[52:23] anything that's fake we don't want to
[52:26] come to church even as our Pastor said
[52:28] this morning the devil will want us to
[52:30] come here and just fill the pews and
[52:33] come as one and more service and like
[52:36] the sincerity and come without
[52:38] expectation and come and just say well
[52:40] we went to church and we went and we
[52:42] came back he's wanting a church that
[52:45] that is a lukewarm Church he's wanting a
[52:47] church that's built after his character
[52:50] he doesn't want a church that's built
[52:52] with power and and and wonders from God
[52:55] a people that can come into the church
[52:57] with expectation I was reading somewhere
[53:00] where the Prophet is talking and they
[53:02] said oh we just gather here we don't
[53:04] know what God is going to do with us
[53:06] I thought I said that's how we need to
[53:08] come in the building of God and when we
[53:11] assemble ourselves together there has to
[53:13] be some expectation of the supernatural
[53:16] we there has to be some expectation that
[53:19] if a sinner walks in they can't go back
[53:21] the same way they came in
[53:23] there has to be because remember the
[53:26] prophet the same Prophet will tell us
[53:28] that we can only receive according to
[53:30] our own expectation so if we come we
[53:33] just like a desical well I'll just go
[53:35] and hear the preacher whatever
[53:36] Revelation they've got so they can tell
[53:39] me we will miss the mark we'll miss what
[53:42] God is trying to do with us God is here
[53:44] wanting us to be motivated to be sealed
[53:47] up and to be the people that come under
[53:50] the expectation is it today is this the
[53:53] day that I'm going to get my Deliverance
[53:54] this is today that that sister is going
[53:57] to be healed that brother over there
[53:58] will be saved is it today that my son
[54:01] will come back home what is it we come
[54:03] with the expectation
[54:05] when we pray when we sing we hold our
[54:09] needs before him and with the
[54:11] expectation that he will touch it oh
[54:14] like those on the pull of Bethesda they
[54:16] went with expectation oh
[54:19] oh they jump and they did all that they
[54:21] could but oh that was only enough for
[54:24] one
[54:25] more today we have the word and we have
[54:28] God the spirit of God moving in our
[54:29] meeting we can come with the expectation
[54:32] God touch me
[54:34] do something for my son do something for
[54:37] this one do something for that one so we
[54:40] we have such a great promise let's not
[54:43] miss it let's not just be like any other
[54:45] Church let's be a people that's on the
[54:48] expectation of the supernatural anytime
[54:52] we are told the Rapture can happen any
[54:54] moment
[54:55] we are told we don't know perhaps this
[54:57] is our last service so we have to live
[55:00] with the expectation that this could be
[55:02] it
[55:04] so we just can't come and and you know
[55:07] oh I don't know and and and our mind
[55:10] goes to whatever trouble we have going
[55:12] on and you know how am I going to pay
[55:15] this how am I going to get this how am I
[55:16] going to get this no when we come we
[55:19] have to have an understanding that I am
[55:21] in the presence of the almighty God if I
[55:24] have a need he knows about it if
[55:27] something I've been doing he knows about
[55:28] it before it even happened so I'm here
[55:31] I'm gonna put my needs to the side I'm
[55:34] going to worship him with everything
[55:35] that I have and I know he knows what I
[55:38] have need of he'll come and answer my
[55:40] name
[55:42] don't let that get in the way of God
[55:45] moving don't let get in don't let your
[55:48] needle whatever you have in your heart
[55:50] get in the way of God moving why because
[55:52] he knows your need and he will come to
[55:54] answer you in due time
[55:57] that's the kind of expectation so I want
[56:00] to say this as the elect
[56:02] the elect is here in the end time
[56:07] we as the elect
[56:09] the elect is a hungry for the reality of
[56:12] God
[56:13] oh I tell you they they you know there's
[56:17] not come the time where when we read the
[56:20] word and the expectation of the hour
[56:22] that our hearts just burns aflame to see
[56:26] the promises come to pass to see the
[56:30] things that God has promised for this
[56:31] time come to pass so we are not
[56:34] satisfied to just be a church member we
[56:36] are here not to follow in the Traditions
[56:39] or we you know we go to church we sing
[56:42] couple of songs the preacher comes and
[56:43] they preach no we are here as a group of
[56:46] people that have received the message of
[56:48] the hour and we are under the
[56:51] expectation that the message is working
[56:53] to transform Us in what God is wanting
[56:56] us to be
[56:59] you know the prophet is no one has ever
[57:02] come in the presence of God and go back
[57:04] the same so why do we think we go back
[57:07] the same why do we come with that
[57:09] expectation why do we come without
[57:11] sincerity why do we come we're just
[57:14] trying to just say oh we don't know
[57:16] what's going to happen we have to come
[57:18] under the expectation that God is here
[57:20] to fulfill his word
[57:23] our hearts should be a flame the
[57:26] anticipation that God's promise will
[57:29] come to pass we come with the
[57:31] expectation that God is going to move
[57:33] his word will be made True To Us
[57:35] whatever we have need of will be
[57:37] answered
[57:39] so the prophet will tell us that this is
[57:43] the time he he says it this way and I'm
[57:46] just trying to not take too long and and
[57:49] most of this I'm probably paraphrasing
[57:51] it then most of you know it so he will
[57:54] I said this is Satan zeed and as we know
[57:57] it
[57:59] and it says
[58:01] time where hell is on Earth
[58:06] you know just look at the temperature
[58:08] you know
[58:11] laughs
[58:13] I mean you have to look far everywhere
[58:16] you go it tells you that hell is on
[58:19] Earth
[58:19] but we know that there's a promise that
[58:22] heaven will also be on earth
[58:26] so to the believer your focus is not
[58:29] hell your focus is heaven
[58:31] and if your focus is heaven you need to
[58:34] look for the manifestation of Heaven
[58:36] wherever Heaven has to be made known so
[58:40] we have to come and know that I know God
[58:43] promised for heaven to be manifested I
[58:45] know he promised that heaven will be
[58:47] manifested the same as hell is being
[58:49] manifested I want to see the
[58:51] manifestation of Heaven in my life if by
[58:55] my eyes I see the manifestation of hell
[58:58] outside I need the manifestation of
[59:00] Heaven in my heart in and in my life
[59:04] why because heaven is not manifested in
[59:07] the air Heaven is manifested in you
[59:10] Heaven is manifested through your flesh
[59:12] Heaven Is the End Time expression for
[59:15] the Believers
[59:19] oh my
[59:21] the prophet will say
[59:23] in the greatest battle ever fought
[59:25] this is perhaps one of my just favorite
[59:28] quotes to just read and and he just
[59:32] reminds you and he puts you in position
[59:34] for you to know what's really happening
[59:36] around you he says Satan's Army brings
[59:39] diseases
[59:40] That's what Satan is he's the Destroyer
[59:44] Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is
[59:47] sickness death sorrow frustration
[59:49] worries all on Satan
[59:53] and anybody experienced any of that
[59:55] that's Satan
[59:58] God is not the author of frustration
[1:00:00] he's not the auto of sickness he's not
[1:00:03] the author of all of that so if you find
[1:00:05] yourself with sickness with death with
[1:00:08] sorrow frustration worries all of that
[1:00:10] is on Satan and if you could put it up
[1:00:13] it's fine it says God is life
[1:00:16] in paragraph 341 God is life Faith joy
[1:00:21] peace over here he says now that's the
[1:00:25] two forces that's coming together right
[1:00:27] now they are battling they are battling
[1:00:30] right now in the building right now
[1:00:35] we I I think we we forget as well a
[1:00:38] Pastor said the awareness that there's a
[1:00:41] battle going on
[1:00:43] you know it is you you go you come the
[1:00:46] service will hear the word and all of a
[1:00:48] sudden you feel on the mountain top and
[1:00:50] you feel good and you go out and before
[1:00:53] the week is over my my the devil will
[1:00:56] pour it on you and you'll really realize
[1:00:58] that this is the battle I just thought I
[1:01:00] was winning this what's going on it's
[1:01:02] why it wants you God wants you to be
[1:01:04] aware that anytime you see that it's the
[1:01:07] devil battling against you but he also
[1:01:10] wants you to be aware that at the same
[1:01:12] time that the spirit of God is said to
[1:01:15] battle for you
[1:01:17] I'll be dismayed don't lose it all don't
[1:01:21] be all broken up because something
[1:01:23] didn't go the way you expected just know
[1:01:25] that God when the army of Satan is there
[1:01:28] battling you the army of God is there to
[1:01:30] do battle for you
[1:01:33] so here he says it says God is Faith joy
[1:01:37] peace over here now that's the two great
[1:01:40] spirit that's coming together right now
[1:01:42] they are battling they are battling here
[1:01:45] in the building right now they are
[1:01:47] battling day by day with you every Force
[1:01:51] Satan he says following you along that
[1:01:54] great big kindly priest Goliath trying
[1:01:57] to scare the liver out of you
[1:02:00] so you actually got it from the message
[1:02:03] China scared to live to live here he's
[1:02:06] right
[1:02:12] it's a gospel with a word of Truth
[1:02:15] around your loin so now I want you where
[1:02:18] is our fortification coming from it's
[1:02:21] coming from the word of Truth what is

[1:03:27] culture you meet me with the name of
[1:03:29] organization you meet me in the name of
[1:03:31] this or the name of the author but I
[1:03:34] meet you in the name of the Lord God of
[1:03:36] Israel
[1:03:38] we have to learn to do battles
[1:03:41] don't don't let the enemy get you out of
[1:03:43] your element and you lose it all you got
[1:03:46] to be fortified you got to have the word
[1:03:48] of Truth you got to have the word of the
[1:03:51] Lord that you can go to battle with I'm
[1:03:53] coming after you give way even death
[1:03:57] itself can stand there
[1:04:02] but what I'm says
[1:04:04] the power of Satan
[1:04:09] the if you if you take it and compress
[1:04:12] it all together
[1:04:13] the best that it could do
[1:04:16] is death
[1:04:19] but it says faith looks at death
[1:04:22] and he sees the resurrection
[1:04:27] just take that
[1:04:29] I mean what what skin did the devil do
[1:04:32] apart from creating debt nothing else
[1:04:34] but God we have a God who came he went
[1:04:39] into hell death in the grave he actually
[1:04:42] took death and he took the sting out of
[1:04:44] death and the prophet is telling us now
[1:04:47] Death Becomes a doorway for the
[1:04:49] Believers he comes and says there is
[1:04:51] taken he took death and he took the
[1:04:53] sting out of death the ability for him
[1:04:56] to keep you in the grave and to keep you
[1:04:58] dead and everything God came and he took
[1:05:00] that away from you so the thing that he
[1:05:03] can do the worst that he can do is Bluff
[1:05:05] at you
[1:05:09] you have nothing to fear nothing
[1:05:15] but yet we are
[1:05:16] oh my it looks like I won't be able to
[1:05:19] get this one over
[1:05:21] no
[1:05:22] come to him
[1:05:24] who in the name of the Lord God of
[1:05:26] Israel come to him with the word of God
[1:05:29] in your mouth come to him with the where
[1:05:32] it says the truth the truth around your
[1:05:34] loin it says come to him with faith as
[1:05:37] your Shield the sword waving The Sword
[1:05:40] and then he says sword and waving it in
[1:05:42] your hands that we may have the word of
[1:05:44] God in our hands
[1:05:46] he says chop a hole right through it
[1:05:49] that's right whatever it is just take
[1:05:51] the word drop a hole
[1:05:54] why because Christ has done it for you
[1:05:57] Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army
[1:06:00] is commissioned to cast them out amen
[1:06:04] there you are every every time Satan
[1:06:07] throws anything unto you God's Army is
[1:06:12] cast them out God's Army is to cast him
[1:06:15] out cast them out it says that's the
[1:06:17] very technique that God used it says
[1:06:20] Satan uses Army of Destruction to
[1:06:23] disbelieve God's word and to set him up
[1:06:26] for a better Kingdom than Michael had
[1:06:28] God cast him out
[1:06:32] God's method
[1:06:35] how many believe God's method is our
[1:06:37] method
[1:06:38] so you don't have to wonder well God's
[1:06:41] method in fact is made for you
[1:06:45] so he had to create a pattern that we
[1:06:49] can go and use when God creates
[1:06:52] something is for his children it's for
[1:06:54] his heartstring it's for anybody who has
[1:06:57] a part of him in him so when he creates
[1:06:59] his method his children will use his
[1:07:02] method he says God method is cast out
[1:07:06] the devil gas down reasoning cast down
[1:07:09] Superstition cast down worry cast down
[1:07:12] diseases cast down sin amen you are
[1:07:16] above it
[1:07:24] I think a lot of friends needs to climb
[1:07:27] to a ladder a little bit you know
[1:07:29] we keep putting ourselves way down there
[1:07:33] you are above it right
[1:07:37] resurrected in Christ Jesus sitting in
[1:07:41] Heavenly places
[1:07:43] where with with with every devil under
[1:07:47] your feet or your foot it says if he
[1:07:51] starts to stick his head in there what
[1:07:56] just think about it
[1:07:58] so anytime the devil seems to just you
[1:08:01] just step on him
[1:08:04] that's where he belongs
[1:08:07] oh this is not going right just step on
[1:08:10] him
[1:08:12] let me say this outside of this position
[1:08:15] we are fighting out of position
[1:08:20] outside of what we are reading tonight
[1:08:22] you are fighting out a physician and
[1:08:25] you're never going to win
[1:08:27] the only place you have to take is what
[1:08:30] the word says is giving you is what the
[1:08:32] word is making you is what God is making
[1:08:35] you is what the scripture says to go
[1:08:37] with him where you go with the word
[1:08:39] because God is giving you the word
[1:08:42] so let me say this and I said I was not
[1:08:46] going to be long I guess
[1:08:47] preach
[1:08:52] so so and I want to say this because we
[1:08:56] we need to get off of this habit of
[1:08:58] being down and up and up and down and
[1:09:01] down and up and and all those things and
[1:09:04] I'm not even talking about necessarily
[1:09:06] sinful but I'm talking about you you you
[1:09:09] constantly being down because something
[1:09:12] is not going the way you think you
[1:09:14] should be the the prophet will tell us
[1:09:16] it says put the word in your mouth and
[1:09:18] he says you'll start to sing you'll
[1:09:21] start to Rejoice I I want us to get to
[1:09:24] where we can stop practicing what the
[1:09:26] prophet is telling us when when things
[1:09:28] are going wrong you start to sing a song
[1:09:30] and praising God
[1:09:32] and I want to say this we need to get in
[1:09:36] the spirit of the word
[1:09:38] we need to get in the spirit of the word
[1:09:40] because the Brother David read it this
[1:09:44] morning I believe in it
[1:09:46] most of what I'm saying here it just
[1:09:48] came from what we heard tonight and I
[1:09:50] and I just want he says there is two
[1:09:53] ways it says one was carnal carnal
[1:09:57] conception and the other was spiritual
[1:10:00] revelation
[1:10:01] I'm not sure if you heard it when we
[1:10:03] were reading when we went through the
[1:10:05] message he says the one is carnal uh
[1:10:08] conception of man the other is spiritual
[1:10:11] Revelation so what's the difference
[1:10:13] carnal conception is by knowledge it's
[1:10:17] by understanding it's by a man's ability
[1:10:20] to take the scriptures and put the
[1:10:22] scripture together and and try to figure
[1:10:25] out what it means and all those things
[1:10:27] and but the spiritual Revelation is God
[1:10:30] himself opening your eyes for you to see
[1:10:33] what it really is
[1:10:36] no don't ever forget that because
[1:10:41] conception it's easy to come to the same
[1:10:44] conclusion
[1:10:47] why because you've taken the scripture
[1:10:49] you've taken that scripture oh we can
[1:10:51] see that but but Revelation it's God who
[1:10:54] gives the revelation
[1:10:58] you you can look at your life I was
[1:11:01] thinking oh
[1:11:03] all about how uh he went to the hospital
[1:11:06] to pray for this child you know whose
[1:11:09] parents they called him and the nurse
[1:11:11] comes in and he looks at him and they
[1:11:12] are rejoicing after the child is prayed
[1:11:15] for nothing has changed nothing
[1:11:18] everything's so the same the same
[1:11:20] reading the same condition the same
[1:11:22] everything but yet they are rejoicing
[1:11:24] what was that that was spiritual
[1:11:27] Revelation they believed that the
[1:11:30] prophet had come and prayed they believe
[1:11:32] with all the heart that the child was
[1:11:34] healed regardless of the condition
[1:11:36] spiritual Revelation sees the results
[1:11:38] before anything can be moved
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:43] carnal goes by how is it feel today you
[1:11:47] feel better oh praise God you feel bad
[1:11:50] well I guess we're gonna go have to go
[1:11:53] back to prayer again
[1:11:56] that's what we do
[1:11:59] what did Abraham what was counted to
[1:12:02] Abraham for righteousness
[1:12:04] Sarah how are you feeling today no
[1:12:06] different praise God we're gonna get a
[1:12:09] child praise God Sarah how are you today
[1:12:13] well same thing praise God we're going
[1:12:16] to get a child the condition was not
[1:12:19] what was manifesting the faith
[1:12:21] hallelujah it's the faith that kept
[1:12:24] moving and moving and moving and moving
[1:12:27] Faith was able to produce something even
[1:12:31] when there was nothing to be brought
[1:12:35] isn't that what the prophet said faith
[1:12:38] will bring things that are not in
[1:12:39] existence it will call from the kingdom
[1:12:42] of God it will bring it into
[1:12:44] manifestation it's not how you feel
[1:12:46] today how you feel tomorrow it's what
[1:12:49] the word said
[1:12:54] let's not walk by carnal conception
[1:12:58] let it be spiritual revelation
[1:13:01] that I know
[1:13:03] my life is in his hands but when it
[1:13:06] talks about it in India he talks about
[1:13:08] those animals that
[1:13:10] moved away from the buildings and they
[1:13:13] came in there was an earthquake that was
[1:13:15] to be and they yeah they are shifted
[1:13:17] away from all the buildings and
[1:13:19] everything and here are humans looking
[1:13:21] at animal going what's going on with
[1:13:24] these animals
[1:13:26] and then days later the earthquake
[1:13:28] happens and only then people realize
[1:13:32] what was really happening says if God
[1:13:35] can do that with animals how much more
[1:13:36] can you do with the sons and the
[1:13:38] daughters
[1:13:39] we need is faith in the word of God what
[1:13:42] we need is to know what an inheritance
[1:13:44] is what we need is to know what are we
[1:13:47] being brought into the word of God will
[1:13:49] produce the result every time
[1:13:55] we need to lift up the word in our lives
[1:13:59] for whatever is happening let the word
[1:14:02] be lifted up the scripture says in
[1:14:05] Galatians 5 and 6 then it says
[1:14:08] this I say then a walk in the spirit
[1:14:11] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:14:13] flesh
[1:14:15] so automatically you realize that carnal
[1:14:17] impersonation will only end with the
[1:14:21] Fulfillment of the desires of the flesh
[1:14:24] quickly
[1:14:25] the only way to avoid fulfilling the
[1:14:28] desires of the flesh is to walk
[1:14:32] by the spirit walk in the spirit then ye
[1:14:35] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:14:37] and then he says in Galatians 5 and 25
[1:14:41] it says if we live in the spirit let us
[1:14:45] there let us also walk in the spirit
[1:14:50] no I've always thought about this and
[1:14:54] you know and there's been times I
[1:14:58] remember you know you you you watched
[1:15:02] Sports and different things and
[1:15:05] um I I like to like especially you know
[1:15:07] when there's a big game usually they
[1:15:09] make this uh little eclipse of people
[1:15:12] how they prepare themselves and
[1:15:14] everything and I was watching one and
[1:15:17] you see how people will move away from
[1:15:19] the families and they will go into a
[1:15:22] camping to prepare whether to be a
[1:15:24] boxing or whatever they'll put
[1:15:26] themselves away and they will do all
[1:15:28] that they can what they what are they
[1:15:30] trying to do they're trying to get into
[1:15:32] the spirit of whatever is about to
[1:15:34] happen so that they are ready they can't
[1:15:36] live and and be subject to all other
[1:15:39] emotions and everything and then expect
[1:15:42] to go fight the next day they need to
[1:15:44] get them in condition for them to be
[1:15:47] ready for the big game I want to say
[1:15:50] this as Believers of this message but
[1:15:52] when I'm and I'll read it here but says
[1:15:55] the message of the end time is here to
[1:15:57] prepare the bride for the rapture
[1:16:00] yes so you can be out of the message of
[1:16:04] the hour feeding on whatever you need
[1:16:06] and then be ready for the Rapture those
[1:16:08] things can come together so as Believers
[1:16:11] the way we get into the spirit of God Is
[1:16:14] by feasting on the word of God it's by
[1:16:17] being inspired by the word of God it's
[1:16:19] by getting into the word of God because
[1:16:22] remember the spirit is the spirit of the
[1:16:25] word it's not a different spirit it's
[1:16:27] the spirit of the word that gets us
[1:16:29] ready for the word but whatever it says
[1:16:31] get into the get into the spirit first
[1:16:34] before it happens
[1:16:39] oh imagine if we can just all come to
[1:16:43] church already on fire for God already
[1:16:46] our hearts burning are not talking
[1:16:49] without necessarily screaming and all
[1:16:51] kind of thing but our hearts prepared
[1:16:53] and come under expectation and all that
[1:16:56] God is going to speak to me I'm here I
[1:16:58] know I don't care what that preacher
[1:17:00] prepare God is going to speak to me
[1:17:02] through that preacher my brother my
[1:17:04] sister this is the reality of the word
[1:17:06] of God
[1:17:10] amen we have
[1:17:12] taken and let our traditions cover over
[1:17:17] the very Supernatural of God
[1:17:20] which means we become satisfied we're
[1:17:23] just coming and clocking in and
[1:17:26] 12 o'clock or 12 30 we are already
[1:17:29] anxious to clock out we're already
[1:17:31] thinking about everything else that's
[1:17:33] supposed to happen
[1:17:35] what if God wanted us to stay here for
[1:17:36] another five hours
[1:17:41] it'll be a stunner
[1:17:45] I wonder how many people will just say I
[1:17:47] don't know what's going on here
[1:17:50] it's good
[1:17:52] I want to be under the expectation I
[1:17:55] don't care if we come for 30 minutes for
[1:17:57] one hour time is not of in essence it's
[1:17:59] what God is wanting to do the word of
[1:18:02] God is transcendent it's past all things
[1:18:05] it's the very creator of all things the
[1:18:08] word of God is the thing that makes
[1:18:10] things happen
[1:18:13] who knows if you were trying to get
[1:18:15] fired and God was over there fighting
[1:18:17] for you
[1:18:19] who knows if something bad was gonna
[1:18:21] happen for you and God is over there
[1:18:23] fighting for you and you are here just
[1:18:25] anxious oh I got to get out I gotta get
[1:18:26] out and God is trying to keep you away
[1:18:28] from all trouble
[1:18:34] foreign
[1:18:37] will say this he will say this in the
[1:18:40] patma's vision it says I it says I was
[1:18:43] in the spirit it wasn't it says I was in
[1:18:45] the spirit isn't that uh isn't that just
[1:18:49] beautiful my I love that he says you
[1:18:51] could just call those words the whole of
[1:18:55] Christian Life
[1:18:56] if you are going to live as a Christian
[1:18:59] we have to be in his spirit
[1:19:05] I'm not talking about emotions his
[1:19:08] spirit amen
[1:19:09] amen God your word is going on right now
[1:19:11] I want to be in the spirit when the word
[1:19:15] of God came they came with the intention
[1:19:17] of changing things
[1:19:19] it wasn't sent just so we can take it
[1:19:21] and add to our knowledge it was saying
[1:19:24] so it could actually bring births so he
[1:19:27] could change lives so he could take away
[1:19:29] the things of the world so it could
[1:19:31] change a person and make it or son and
[1:19:33] the daughter to God so when I received
[1:19:35] the word I have the same expectation
[1:19:37] that the word will do the same in my
[1:19:39] life
[1:19:43] paragraph 43 if you could put it out
[1:19:46] there I'm not sure if that's the yeah
[1:19:49] 43. he says
[1:19:52] if we are going to live we live as
[1:19:55] Christians we have to be in his Spirit
[1:19:57] John was not talking about being in his
[1:20:01] own Spirit it says that would that would
[1:20:03] not that would not have brought the
[1:20:06] these Visions he has he says he had to
[1:20:10] be in the spirit of God he had to be in
[1:20:13] the spirit of God he says it has to be
[1:20:15] the spirit of God with us too or all the
[1:20:19] efforts are in vain
[1:20:24] said I pray in the spirit I will sing in
[1:20:29] the spirit I will live in the spirit if
[1:20:32] there be anything good that will come to
[1:20:34] me as to be he says it has to be
[1:20:37] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:20:40] word and made manifest by the results it
[1:20:44] bears
[1:20:48] so we we can't receive the word as some
[1:20:52] form of intellectual connections that we
[1:20:55] are building or exchange an intellectual
[1:20:58] exchange and forget to understand that
[1:21:01] there's a spirit that's here to make
[1:21:03] that word a reality
[1:21:06] every word when we read it from the
[1:21:09] Bible from the message there has to be
[1:21:11] an expectation there is a God behind
[1:21:14] this word who can take this word and
[1:21:16] change my life by my stripes you are
[1:21:19] healed there's a God who stands behind
[1:21:21] and let me say this every word of God
[1:21:24] every promise of God the prophet tells
[1:21:26] us God when he came to the Cross he says
[1:21:29] this is a finished work
[1:21:32] it's a finish work so when you receive
[1:21:35] the word you are receiving the final
[1:21:38] product you are receiving something
[1:21:40] that's been tested that went through all
[1:21:43] kinds of tests that went through all
[1:21:44] kinds of things so that when you take it
[1:21:47] it will produce the exact result that he
[1:21:49] promised you will do
[1:21:52] it's not a clinical trial
[1:21:57] it's not something with a bunch of side
[1:21:59] effects that you gotta wonder whether
[1:22:00] you should take it or not
[1:22:02] it's a finished product it means God
[1:22:05] himself as a proof of it God himself has
[1:22:09] been a goal to do it when he gives it to
[1:22:12] you he stands behind his own words
[1:22:15] he says now it says end as I assure
[1:22:19] assures John needed to be in the spirit
[1:22:21] to receive this tremendous Revelation it
[1:22:25] says fresh from from Jesus we need to be
[1:22:28] in the spirit to understand the
[1:22:30] Revelation that God had given to us to
[1:22:32] live by in his word
[1:22:39] think about that
[1:22:44] the prophet will talk about
[1:22:47] people like
[1:22:50] George Washington
[1:22:52] they said
[1:22:54] he saw victory in his heart
[1:23:00] this is before any defeat has happened
[1:23:05] not enough guns no shoes not enough
[1:23:10] things to fight with and all the kinds
[1:23:12] of stuff
[1:23:13] yet somebody sees sin there and
[1:23:16] something within the hearts tell them
[1:23:18] you are an overcomer
[1:23:24] now God is not waiting for you to get to
[1:23:27] the other side for him to tell you I see
[1:23:28] I told you no he's here telling you
[1:23:31] through his word you are an overcomer
[1:23:33] you you keep looking at your defeat what
[1:23:36] about I'm defeated yeah I know but you
[1:23:38] are an overcomer
[1:23:42] don't look at your defeat look at the
[1:23:44] word
[1:23:45] be inspired by the word growing the word
[1:23:50] let the word lift you up
[1:23:52] so you can become the Overcomer that he
[1:23:55] said you are
[1:23:57] he says paragraph 44 says look at this
[1:24:01] way all too many read the Bible where it
[1:24:04] says in Acts 2 38 repent them be baptize
[1:24:07] every one of you in the name of the in
[1:24:10] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:24:12] remission of your sin and knee shall
[1:24:13] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it
[1:24:15] says listen to this and we just pass
[1:24:18] right on they don't see it if they saw
[1:24:21] it by getting it says if they saw it by
[1:24:25] getting in the spirit they would know
[1:24:27] that if they want to receive the Holy
[1:24:30] Ghost the Holy Spirit they would need to
[1:24:32] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:24:34] the Lord Jesus then and then God will be
[1:24:38] Duty bound to fulfill his word by
[1:24:40] filling them with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] now he's explaining
[1:24:49] I want the Holy Ghost no the word tells
[1:24:53] me if I repent and I'll be back I repent
[1:24:56] and I'll be baptized in the name of the
[1:24:58] Lord Jesus it shifts from being my
[1:25:00] responsibility to God's responsibility
[1:25:05] now that's that's been in the spirit of
[1:25:08] it
[1:25:09] being outside of the spirit of it is a
[1:25:11] healthy I have it today I don't have it
[1:25:13] tomorrow but getting in the spirit of it
[1:25:15] is God I have repented I have been
[1:25:18] baptized now I'm here because you
[1:25:20] promised it's no longer my business but
[1:25:23] it's yours
[1:25:24] to fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:27] and I say this this is for every promise
[1:25:30] in the Bible
[1:25:32] let's not come defeated let's not lift
[1:25:36] up our problems as if they were more
[1:25:38] than the word
[1:25:41] I think we shouldn't come to church
[1:25:44] and the one that the devil is attacking
[1:25:46] the most should be the one just jumping
[1:25:48] up and rejoicing the most praise God
[1:25:51] praise God imagine that
[1:25:57] it's God fulfilling his prophecy it's
[1:26:01] God bringing his word to capture price
[1:26:03] he says they never get in the spirit or
[1:26:07] it would happen to them exactly as the
[1:26:10] word says pray to God for Revelation by
[1:26:13] his Spirit he says that is the first
[1:26:16] step get in the spirit
[1:26:19] again
[1:26:21] he says did you ever ask for the holy he
[1:26:25] says I'll skip for the sacred time sorry
[1:26:32] he paragraph 44 and 3 says
[1:26:35] now if you ever notice how the world
[1:26:37] gets into the spirit of things that are
[1:26:40] in the world
[1:26:43] they go to the ball games
[1:26:48] they're sporting events and the dances
[1:26:50] they enter into the spirit of it they
[1:26:54] don't sit there like Wallflowers
[1:26:58] like old dried up sticks they enter
[1:27:02] right into it into the field of things
[1:27:05] and become part of them of things
[1:27:10] but oh it says how they hate to create
[1:27:14] the Christians for getting into the
[1:27:16] spirit of God's word they call us
[1:27:18] Fanatics Holy Rollers there's not it
[1:27:21] says there's nothing they won't do they
[1:27:24] won't do to show their hatred and
[1:27:27] disapproval but ignore that
[1:27:30] you can expect it knowing that they were
[1:27:33] coming for they were the way they were
[1:27:35] doing where it is coming from just go on
[1:27:38] and get in the spirit of worship
[1:27:42] do you think they don't have troubles
[1:27:46] the people that paint the stomach and
[1:27:49] and all the faces and everything that
[1:27:52] they don't have any bills to pay or
[1:27:53] whatever
[1:27:58] I'm just asking
[1:28:02] they get lost
[1:28:05] they forget about all of that in fact
[1:28:08] they say it's okay if it comes right
[1:28:10] after but right now I gotta enjoy myself
[1:28:14] they get drunk they get told by the same
[1:28:16] problem still there but they do it
[1:28:18] anyway
[1:28:20] how much more we knowing that if we get
[1:28:23] in the spirit not only God is going to
[1:28:26] bless us but he also promised to take
[1:28:28] care of our needs
[1:28:33] all right
[1:28:37] he says the Christians ought to be as
[1:28:41] exuberant and full of pleasure in the
[1:28:44] Lord as the world is in the savior of
[1:28:47] the light of its pleasure
[1:28:51] both Christians and the world are human
[1:28:53] both have emotions they have he says the
[1:28:57] difference the difference is the
[1:28:59] Christians the heart hearts and emotions
[1:29:02] are purely on the Lord on The Lord Of
[1:29:05] Glory and his love while the world
[1:29:09] satisfies the flesh
[1:29:11] as long as you don't do it for some
[1:29:14] fleshly emotions
[1:29:16] yeah but we could do it for God
[1:29:20] I want to say this God is expressing
[1:29:23] himself in the end time
[1:29:26] and it's important we we understand that
[1:29:29] even as we see here
[1:29:31] we are expressing something whether we
[1:29:33] we understand it or not whether we know
[1:29:36] what it is or what is not we are every
[1:29:39] day our lives are expressing something
[1:29:43] our lives are in fact the prophet will
[1:29:46] say that you know it says that our Our
[1:29:49] Lives speak louder than our words what
[1:29:51] we say is not necessarily because our
[1:29:54] lives they dare to be an expression what
[1:29:57] we do how we conduct ourselves is a form
[1:29:59] of an expression and we need to pay more
[1:30:02] attention to find out what is it that
[1:30:04] I'm expressing because I'm here to
[1:30:06] express him
[1:30:07] yeah and here's what the prophet said in
[1:30:10] the message the end time evangelism he
[1:30:12] says
[1:30:13] but the evening time but in the evening
[1:30:16] time that same great power of Christ
[1:30:19] would come upon the church like he did
[1:30:22] back there on the Eastern it says in the
[1:30:26] in the west it would be the same so
[1:30:29] that's why I want to speak on end time
[1:30:31] evangelism so this is a promise of the
[1:30:35] same light the same word the same God
[1:30:38] coming in the west to do the same things
[1:30:40] that he did in the East so that's why I
[1:30:43] said it's the same one he continues and
[1:30:45] says that's what it is it says getting
[1:30:48] the bride ready that's what it is it
[1:30:49] says now we are going to we are going to
[1:30:53] the end right here uh by by saying this
[1:30:56] the end time message is to get the bride
[1:30:59] ready and prepare for Rapture he says
[1:31:02] what can I do what can what can he do
[1:31:05] according to malachite 4 is bring them
[1:31:08] back to the faith of what was once
[1:31:11] delivered to the Saints bring them back
[1:31:13] to the face faith of the father
[1:31:15] Pentecostal part in it says in the
[1:31:18] restoration time I will restore saith
[1:31:21] the Lord the end time evangelism so as
[1:31:24] relievers of the end time message we
[1:31:27] have to understand that the message is
[1:31:29] here to equip us the message is here he
[1:31:33] has the power inside of it to bring us
[1:31:36] back to the rapturing faith to give us
[1:31:39] what we have need of so it's not God
[1:31:42] said I'll send a message and then we'll
[1:31:45] find out what he will produce no the
[1:31:47] message in itself if you hear it if you
[1:31:50] listen to it if you eat it if you drink
[1:31:53] it it has within it the power to change
[1:31:57] and produce rapturing faith
[1:32:01] so there's no or I wonder what he will
[1:32:04] produce no rapturing faith the message
[1:32:07] has the power to produce a bride
[1:32:11] and I want to say this you can't to
[1:32:15] become the voice you need to hear and
[1:32:18] Believe The Voice
[1:32:22] right we cannot self-proclaim ourselves
[1:32:25] the voice of God in the end time if we
[1:32:28] didn't hear the voice that he sent if we
[1:32:31] didn't believe the voice that he sent
[1:32:32] because when he speaks to John when he
[1:32:35] says it's when you eat the book that you
[1:32:37] prophesy when you become one with a book
[1:32:40] that's when you prophesy so in order for
[1:32:42] me to for us to be the proper
[1:32:44] representation of the voice we need to
[1:32:47] hear the voice
[1:32:51] in Hidden life in Christ it says
[1:32:55] if you'll notice
[1:32:57] in the perfect type God did his own son
[1:33:01] the same way
[1:33:04] it says
[1:33:06] he taken three Witnesses in our pastor
[1:33:09] rated this morning where this is a
[1:33:10] different message
[1:33:11] he says
[1:33:13] they were on the uh there were it says
[1:33:16] where uh two or three witness every word
[1:33:19] be established Peter James and John love
[1:33:22] Faith and Hope he says it says he had
[1:33:25] taken them up on the mount that part uh
[1:33:27] from the rest of the world and there
[1:33:30] before before uh official Witnesses God
[1:33:34] adopted his own son he was transfigured
[1:33:37] before them and his Remnant did shine as
[1:33:41] the sun and the voice out of out of the
[1:33:44] cloud said this is my beloved Son uh he
[1:33:47] says hearing him he says he set him up
[1:33:50] on the mountain and put a witness there
[1:33:52] to see it clothe him in a robe as right
[1:33:56] as the sun shining
[1:33:58] um and the sun shining in this they they
[1:34:01] even Shine Like the Sun in its strength
[1:34:04] and God spoke out this is my beloved Son
[1:34:07] here he him God adopted his own his own
[1:34:11] child into the family here he him no
[1:34:14] longer no longer it says hear me no
[1:34:17] longer but this is my son whom who
[1:34:21] taketh over from here from here on amen
[1:34:25] he says that adoption is near the end
[1:34:29] time in parable of the church it's time
[1:34:33] for that
[1:34:36] Hallelujah
[1:34:42] when we read it we have to
[1:34:45] are we under the expectation of that
[1:34:50] they they is a word that when we read
[1:34:53] this morning that just strike me and
[1:34:55] I'll read the same paragraph We read
[1:34:58] this morning and that's the title I
[1:35:00] wanted to give my thought
[1:35:02] it says
[1:35:04] as a progressing son
[1:35:08] I thought I want to be a progressing son
[1:35:12] a progressing son the prophet say that
[1:35:15] but before I read that I want us I want
[1:35:18] us to really understand
[1:35:20] the the week we we desire to be the
[1:35:24] voice but we can only be The Voice by
[1:35:27] listening to The Voice
[1:35:30] we can only be The Voice by following
[1:35:32] The Voice
[1:35:34] Paul says be follow of me as I am of
[1:35:37] Christ so there's always this handing
[1:35:39] over from one to another it's never just
[1:35:43] coming out of the blue it's always God
[1:35:46] if God sent the message and he came and
[1:35:49] the prophet was a full expression of
[1:35:51] what God sent and we behold them we
[1:35:54] behold his life and notice that he was
[1:35:56] truly the expression of what God Said
[1:35:58] then in order for us to become the
[1:36:00] expression we have to believe the same
[1:36:03] word
[1:36:03] the same voice and I want to say this
[1:36:07] it's important we establish this God's
[1:36:10] desire was not so the prophet could
[1:36:12] preach and we recorded in tapes and we
[1:36:14] set it there and the expression remains
[1:36:16] on the tape no it was so that the people
[1:36:19] will come who will believe the word that
[1:36:22] the prophet said and the things that the
[1:36:24] prophet said will manifest into their
[1:36:26] lives
[1:36:27] what was it it's the expression of the
[1:36:30] hour
[1:36:31] God manifesting in his body
[1:36:36] Paul Peter said in First Peter 2 uh
[1:36:39] first Peter 2 and 5 it says ye also
[1:36:43] as Lively stones are built up a
[1:36:47] spiritual or built up a spiritual house
[1:36:50] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:36:53] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:36:57] Christ
[1:36:59] he's speaking about you
[1:37:01] he says but ye are not but ye are chosen
[1:37:05] a chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:37:08] holy nation A peculiar people that ye
[1:37:11] show forth the Praises of him that had
[1:37:14] called you out of Darkness Into The
[1:37:17] Marvelous Light
[1:37:22] it says in that day you shall know
[1:37:25] the same way
[1:37:27] that I was in my father
[1:37:30] and my father in me
[1:37:32] and I in you and you and me
[1:37:36] how can you ever divide that
[1:37:39] how can you ever divide that
[1:37:42] we are his sons we are his daughters we
[1:37:45] are his servants we are his wife we are
[1:37:47] everything
[1:37:49] you can't touch it it's all God together
[1:37:53] manifesting himself whichever way he
[1:37:56] chooses
[1:38:04] so it's in hearing him
[1:38:08] we were the one in Spokane were the one
[1:38:11] we listened to it this morning so I'm
[1:38:13] going to read two portions of it so you
[1:38:15] can see paragraph 49 he says
[1:38:18] here God was standing here now
[1:38:22] he was doing exactly what he asked them
[1:38:25] to do now enough it says in the father's
[1:38:28] great heritage he says where he where he
[1:38:32] had he had many hired man working for
[1:38:36] him
[1:38:39] if he could find it he says now this is
[1:38:41] a little teaching here I hope I don't
[1:38:44] hurt I hurt I don't I hope I don't hurt
[1:38:46] but I just want to make a point get
[1:38:49] Faith started right so when you get
[1:38:51] started started we'll be on right we'll
[1:38:55] be on the right foot notice he says now
[1:38:57] when a baby son was born in the fam in
[1:39:00] in this family
[1:39:01] of this father he was born a son but yet
[1:39:05] he had no inheritance just as a son he
[1:39:08] says now
[1:39:10] it says there's where I think
[1:39:14] I think that the Full Gospel people let
[1:39:16] down a little bit on the our Doctrine
[1:39:19] see we take a person and say well now
[1:39:23] he's filled with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:39:26] speaks in with tongue that's it it says
[1:39:28] no that's not the only that's only it
[1:39:31] says that's just only begun it says you
[1:39:35] just begun you just been born into the
[1:39:37] family that's that's all that's the
[1:39:40] reason today that we our churches is not
[1:39:45] progressing the way we should be
[1:39:49] let me ask you today
[1:39:52] what is the Holy Ghost
[1:39:55] is supposed to be according to what the
[1:39:58] God is requiring for that age
[1:40:03] the requirement for the first age was
[1:40:06] justification
[1:40:07] and that's what was good for them the
[1:40:10] requirement for the second age was
[1:40:11] sanctification that was good for them so
[1:40:14] you can't just get sanctification or
[1:40:16] justification and think you've gotten
[1:40:18] there
[1:40:20] or you just can't be born and think
[1:40:22] you're an adult
[1:40:23] God is looking for maturity at the end
[1:40:27] time so therefore when we are to be born
[1:40:30] again in the end time the same spirit
[1:40:32] that births us is the same tutor that
[1:40:35] guides us to maturity so he can teach us
[1:40:39] so we can be placed son God is not going
[1:40:42] to place a baby that's just born today
[1:40:48] or therefore we see someone struggle we
[1:40:51] say they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] it's just a baby
[1:40:55] the baby struggle that's okay let him
[1:40:58] give him a little bit milk give him a
[1:41:00] little more let him grow a little bit
[1:41:02] when he grows he'll be able to stand for
[1:41:04] for meat and now here's where I got this
[1:41:07] particular paragraph 67 he says
[1:41:11] now there you are he says what what a
[1:41:15] disgrace it says what a Pity that must
[1:41:18] there must be before the father when the
[1:41:20] tutor comes it comes up and the Holy
[1:41:23] Ghost and he brings that it says because
[1:41:25] he is he is our tutor we know that he
[1:41:28] says now this he says and the Holy
[1:41:31] Spirit wrote the Bible the Bible says so
[1:41:33] let me says man of all the move by the
[1:41:36] Holy Ghost wrote the Bible so the Bible
[1:41:39] is written by inspiration there's no
[1:41:41] private interpretation it's just the way
[1:41:44] it's wrote he says he says right there
[1:41:47] just take it believe it act on it God
[1:41:51] will bring it to pass it says it will
[1:41:54] never it says I've never seen him
[1:41:57] promise anything yet but what he done
[1:42:01] amen
[1:42:02] now that's maturity right there to see
[1:42:06] that regardless of the opposition the
[1:42:10] opposition seems great
[1:42:12] it seems scary remember it's like a
[1:42:15] roaring lion it will come and it will
[1:42:17] move everything that he can move but to
[1:42:20] stand there and say that I'm standing on
[1:42:22] God's word and God will do what he
[1:42:24] promised he will do that's maturity
[1:42:28] because if not mature you will run away
[1:42:30] you'll think your weapon is not good
[1:42:33] enough
[1:42:34] but God is telling you stand there
[1:42:36] believe it keep staying at it
[1:42:39] it says anything but he would do it he
[1:42:42] says he will always do it now Here Comes
[1:42:46] Here Comes it says here comes the tutor
[1:42:49] up
[1:42:50] now what if as it comes up before the
[1:42:55] father how that he how he feels he says
[1:42:59] he feels my comes up and say oh your son
[1:43:02] is progressing
[1:43:05] yeah your son is progressing I said God
[1:43:09] I want to be a progressing son I don't
[1:43:12] want to be just stuck here all the time
[1:43:14] every time the tutor comes it's the same
[1:43:17] thing every time it's the same thing no
[1:43:20] I want to be a progressing son what is
[1:43:23] progressing means I'm making ground I'm
[1:43:26] leaving I'm moving I'm I'm moving I'm
[1:43:29] doing something I'm in a movement
[1:43:31] something that is in move is dead is a
[1:43:35] progressing son he's just like a chip of
[1:43:38] all the of the old block as we call it
[1:43:40] down in the South it's just exactly like
[1:43:43] you he's just so interested in all in in
[1:43:46] all the sick and and The Afflicted he's
[1:43:49] so interested in Salvation of the people
[1:43:51] he says he says he's so interested in
[1:43:55] all of it he believes that every word
[1:43:57] you say you know what he's running the
[1:44:00] church just exactly like like like you
[1:44:03] would run it if you were there you if
[1:44:05] you were you were there he says you know
[1:44:09] the way that you your son runs he says
[1:44:11] when he was there when he when he was
[1:44:13] there
[1:44:14] yes that's the same way he's doing it
[1:44:18] he says you know
[1:44:20] it says you had to wrote it in there and
[1:44:24] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:44:25] forever well that's that's just exactly
[1:44:28] what he's doing he says oh my now how
[1:44:31] the father must say that's my son that's
[1:44:35] my child
[1:44:40] do we desire to progress
[1:44:44] do we desire to make ground
[1:44:46] you know the prophet talks about that
[1:44:48] fight that says he says if you can't
[1:44:51] bite him it says government you know if
[1:44:55] you can't move your hand move your toe
[1:44:57] move your finger what is that make
[1:45:00] progress
[1:45:03] cry out
[1:45:04] do whatever you can
[1:45:06] blow it up if you need to
[1:45:09] he will fix it don't just stay stagnant
[1:45:13] don't just get caught up in the today
[1:45:16] and tomorrow everything let God cause
[1:45:19] you to move move me oh God let me make
[1:45:23] progress
[1:45:24] he says in a message
[1:45:27] the word comes in flesh it says now
[1:45:31] you can express it by mental conception
[1:45:35] but if it comes if it becomes a reality
[1:45:39] a real revelation of God
[1:45:41] that you see it before it happen and
[1:45:45] Express in the word form that word takes
[1:45:48] hold and becomes material
[1:45:54] I want you to think of that
[1:45:56] oftentimes we try to express it
[1:45:59] with some mental
[1:46:02] you can express it by mental conception
[1:46:05] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:46:10] God
[1:46:11] that you that you see that you see
[1:46:13] before it it happens and expressed in
[1:46:16] the word form that word takes a hold and
[1:46:20] becomes material
[1:46:23] what is the scripture says faith is the
[1:46:26] substance
[1:46:28] faith is the very evidence of things not
[1:46:31] seen when I have faith it's just as good
[1:46:34] as I have it if the musician could come
[1:46:37] and then it says Endo expressed oh my
[1:46:42] how God could if you if your heart and
[1:46:45] your mind is so and infilled with God's
[1:46:49] spirit until your thought becomes his
[1:46:51] thought it says amen there you are when
[1:46:54] your mind and your and when you're when
[1:46:57] your mind and your leading and you're
[1:47:00] guiding becomes a direct place a direct
[1:47:04] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:47:06] moving your mortal being oh my what kind
[1:47:11] of people we should be if the very Holy
[1:47:14] Spirit has you so embodied or empowered
[1:47:19] that you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:47:22] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:47:24] your own opinion you yes but the Holy
[1:47:27] Spirit as you so built up until your
[1:47:30] thoughts and your being is God's spirit
[1:47:34] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:47:38] of church we would be
[1:47:41] is a reality this is not some figment of
[1:47:44] imagination this is God manifesting his
[1:47:47] word what kind of people we would be
[1:47:49] this morning if if this Branham
[1:47:52] Tabernacle this morning was so filled
[1:47:54] with the presence of God
[1:47:57] why shouldn't we even use our own mind
[1:48:01] why we it says when we shouldn't even be
[1:48:04] used our own mind we didn't even use our
[1:48:06] own thoughts didn't even have no
[1:48:09] alternative to our own thought but just
[1:48:13] to be led by the spirit
[1:48:15] and let me say this
[1:48:17] this is the reality of what God is
[1:48:19] bringing us to
[1:48:21] and all of us together with one heart
[1:48:24] and one Accord we should say we want to

[2:24:01] amen he can do exceedingly and
[2:24:03] abundantly above what we ask or think
[2:24:06] let us pray Our Father
[2:24:09] you visited us tonight
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:14] you anointed our brother and you put
[2:24:16] words in his mouth father that it was
[2:24:20] not him speaking
[2:24:22] father you just laid it out so
[2:24:25] magnificent
[2:24:28] how your children can be an expectation
[2:24:32] because they have a promise that your
[2:24:35] word would not return void
[2:24:37] and father when they hear that word and
[2:24:40] they speak that word now father those
[2:24:43] two have to manifest a result
[2:24:46] because it's true
[2:24:49] and we read in second John where you
[2:24:52] said that your word was true
[2:24:55] and anyone that didn't speak the truth
[2:24:57] was a liar
[2:24:59] and that they did not confess your son
[2:25:02] oh God we confessed this evening that
[2:25:06] the message that you delivered father
[2:25:09] that you delivered to us through your
[2:25:13] servant
[2:25:15] your prophet
[2:25:16] and father then you took the message
[2:25:19] that he preached and Vindicated it in
[2:25:23] flesh and the hearers and the
[2:25:27] proof
[2:25:29] of the Vindicated word and in him as a
[2:25:33] servant we can look and say father
[2:25:35] that's nothing but thus Faith the Lord
[2:25:40] and we believe it with all our heart
[2:25:45] Lord we've just begun to fight
[2:25:49] we've just begun
[2:25:51] father to fulfill
[2:25:54] what you promised and we rejoice in
[2:25:58] Thanksgiving tonight
[2:26:01] for what you've done for the needy that
[2:26:04] we're here tonight God may you always
[2:26:08] receive the honor and glory in the
