[54:39] then we'll read 17 we'll just read a
[54:41] couple of uh scriptures in uh 15 uh
[54:44] verse one it
[54:46] says it says and after these things the
[54:49] word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a
[54:52] vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy
[54:56] sheep shield and thy exceeding great
[54:59] reward and Abram said Lord
[55:03] God what will that give me seeing that I
[55:07] go
[55:08] childless and the steward of my house is
[55:11] this eler of
[55:13] Damascus let's Also let's turn now in 17
[55:16] we'll start from verse
[55:20] one it says
[55:22] and and Abram was 90 years old
[55:26] old and
[55:28] nine and the Lord appear unto Abraham
[55:31] said unto him I am the almighty God walk
[55:35] before me and be thou perfect and I will
[55:38] make that my Covenant between me and
[55:41] thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
[55:45] and Abraham fell on his face and God
[55:47] talked with him saying as for me behold
[55:51] my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt
[55:54] be a father of many nations
[55:57] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[56:00] Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for
[56:04] a father of many Nation if I made thee
[56:09] and I have made thee exceeding and I
[56:12] said I will make thee exceedingly
[56:13] fruitful and I will make nations of thee
[56:17] and Kings shall come out of Thee I will
[56:20] establish my Covenant between me and
[56:24] thee thy seed after thee in their
[56:27] generation for an Everlasting Covenant
[56:30] to be a god unto thee and thy seed after
[56:33] thee and I will give unto thee and to
[56:36] thy seed after thee the land wherewith
[56:40] thou are a stranger and all the land of
[56:43] Canaan for an everlasting possession and
[56:46] I will be their God and God said unto
[56:49] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[56:52] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[56:56] in their
[56:57] generation this is my Covenant which I
[57:01] which ye shall keep between me and you
[57:04] and th seed after thee every man shall
[57:07] among you shall be circumcised and he
[57:11] shall circumcise the Flesh of of your
[57:14] foreskin and it shall be a token to the
[57:18] Covenant between me and you let's just
[57:21] bow our heads gracious father we so
[57:23] thankful of your word this morning we
[57:26] come to you Lord and we pray that you
[57:28] just take this words and multiply it to
[57:30] us father your Prophet will often times
[57:33] say that the man can take the Bible and
[57:35] read and try to put two and two together
[57:39] but it takes you to actually bring out
[57:41] the revelation of it so therefore we ask
[57:43] you do that to us in the name of Jesus
[57:46] Christ we pray amen God bless you may
[57:48] have your seats this morning man it's
[57:50] good to be gathered in the house of God
[57:53] I know we have uh many that are out many
[57:55] that that went to uh the meetings in
[58:00] Louisiana and others
[58:03] traveling amen but I'm glad we are here
[58:06] amen so whatever number we have here
[58:09] this morning we keep marching forward
[58:11] amen I want to speak for a moment this
[58:13] morning on elshadai the strength
[58:17] Giver elshadai the strength
[58:21] Giver as we read in the Bible in the
[58:24] Genesis 17 and even 15 the scripture
[58:28] will speak and God is expressing to
[58:31] Abraham what God is going to do uh to
[58:35] offer as a part of his Covenant now we
[58:39] understand from the Bible reading and
[58:41] the scripture reading that when God uh
[58:45] made a covenant weam will talk about how
[58:48] the first Covenant that God made with
[58:51] Adam it was a conditional Covenant that
[58:54] you you will obey this you will do this
[58:57] you shall not touch up the tree you will
[58:59] do this and we understand that through
[59:01] that Covenant that man fall he fail
[59:04] because he was unable to obey God's word
[59:08] or to keep his part of the bargain of
[59:10] what God told him to do so we understand
[59:12] the fall came through that so therefore
[59:15] but the prophet will tell us that when
[59:17] God came and he made a covenant with
[59:19] Abraham uh the scripture will call it an
[59:22] unconditional Covenant it was not a
[59:24] covenant that was based B on what
[59:26] Abraham was going to do but it was based
[59:29] upon everything that God was offering to
[59:32] Abraham and all Abraham had to do was to
[59:36] believe the promise was to believe that
[59:38] this all was already given to him that
[59:41] the the the Covenant wasn't
[59:43] unconditional it wasn't based on uh
[59:46] Abraham goodness that God will do it it
[59:49] wasn't based on Abraham's ability that
[59:52] everything was based on what God was
[59:54] offering to him
[59:56] and so as we read we could see here God
[59:59] is is expressing to Abraham what he's
[1:00:02] going to offer him as part of his
[1:00:04] Covenant God is listing the blessings
[1:00:07] that follow the Covenant that he has
[1:00:09] made with Abraham it says in other words
[1:00:12] he's giving him what the benefit of the
[1:00:14] covenants are he will tell him that if
[1:00:16] you going he says that if you are part
[1:00:19] of this Covenant in this Covenant I will
[1:00:21] make you exceedingly fruitful he said I
[1:00:24] will make you a father of Nations and it
[1:00:27] says Kings will come after thee so and
[1:00:30] Abraham we understand by the scripture
[1:00:32] that Abraham is a type of a Believer so
[1:00:35] when a Believer when we come and we
[1:00:37] believe the word of God God is making a
[1:00:40] covenant with us and he's letting us
[1:00:42] know that if we believe the promise that
[1:00:44] God promised that he will provide for
[1:00:46] you that will provide protection that he
[1:00:49] will lead you and whatever you have need
[1:00:51] of is there to give to you the promise
[1:00:54] is not made so that you can come and and
[1:00:57] generate some works for God to look and
[1:00:59] say that these are the works that are
[1:01:01] acceptable but the Covenant is given to
[1:01:04] get you out of the condition that you
[1:01:06] are in so you can come into the Covenant
[1:01:09] or in the condition that God wants you
[1:01:11] to be let me say this this morning God
[1:01:14] is not looking for us to be perfect to
[1:01:16] come to him he wants us to come the way
[1:01:18] we are God is calling upon us the way we
[1:01:22] are it doesn't matter what your
[1:01:23] challenge is this morning the Covenant
[1:01:26] that God made is if you come in the
[1:01:28] condition that you are in I will do the
[1:01:30] cleaning I will do the calling I'll do
[1:01:33] the providing I'll do everything you
[1:01:36] just have to believe my word you just
[1:01:38] have to believe my Covenant and through
[1:01:40] the Covenant I will bring you in the
[1:01:43] condition that I want you to be so even
[1:01:46] as we read God told Abraham he says be
[1:01:48] thou perfect but we understand that God
[1:01:50] wasn't requiring for Abraham to go and
[1:01:54] produce his the perfect by himself or
[1:01:57] find a way for him to actually become
[1:01:59] perfect but it was through the provision
[1:02:02] of the Covenant that if Abraham was to
[1:02:05] partake of the Covenant that he was
[1:02:07] going to be changed from what he was
[1:02:09] into the Perfection that God was looking
[1:02:12] for so the promise and again after
[1:02:15] Abraham being a type of a Believer I
[1:02:17] want to say this the promise that God
[1:02:20] makes every part of the scripture
[1:02:22] because remember this promise was not
[1:02:24] just made to Abraham and himself God
[1:02:27] said he was made to Abraham and the seed
[1:02:29] after him so when we come as children of
[1:02:33] Abraham the promise was made to the
[1:02:36] believer not the unbeliever not the one
[1:02:39] who's going to come doubting not the one
[1:02:41] who's going to come to criticize not to
[1:02:43] the one who's going to come and say well
[1:02:45] God requires this how am I going to get
[1:02:47] there no the promise is made to the one
[1:02:50] that's going to come up and show and say
[1:02:52] that God I'm I'm here because I believe
[1:02:55] your word and I'm I'm here because you
[1:02:58] said I should be here and I'm here
[1:03:00] because you open my eyes so I can see
[1:03:03] what you are talking about I'm here
[1:03:05] because you have made a way for me to
[1:03:07] hear your word in the end time I'm here
[1:03:10] because of the promise that you have
[1:03:11] made and I believe that through the
[1:03:13] promise that you have made you God has
[1:03:17] the ability to change me in what I need
[1:03:19] to be in the end
[1:03:21] time so the promise is for those who are
[1:03:24] waiting for his coming the promise is to
[1:03:27] those that are believing and waiting for
[1:03:30] the manifestation the promise is not
[1:03:33] made for the critics you know many times
[1:03:36] people have the approach where they will
[1:03:38] come and they will read and they will
[1:03:40] try to to find and and said well what
[1:03:43] does this mean or or why are they doing
[1:03:45] things a certain way why is this done a
[1:03:47] certain way now the promise is not made
[1:03:50] for those that questions the promise is
[1:03:52] not made for those uh will try to
[1:03:55] understand Ed intellectually the promise
[1:03:58] is made to the Believers the promise is
[1:04:01] for those who come and say that God
[1:04:03] spoken his word I don't care how much I
[1:04:06] don't understand what he said but I will
[1:04:08] believe it anyhow how was Abraham going
[1:04:11] to have a child Abraham didn't know how
[1:04:14] all that God knew that or that Abraham
[1:04:17] knew was God spoke it and I believe it
[1:04:20] all that Abraham knew is that God said
[1:04:22] that I was going to have a child how
[1:04:24] he's going to transform from what I am
[1:04:26] into having a baby I have no idea in
[1:04:29] fact the time that I thought I had much
[1:04:31] time to have the child the time is
[1:04:34] passed by I don't know the more time
[1:04:36] goes by the more my body is dying the
[1:04:38] more impossible the mission it seems
[1:04:41] like I will have a baby but one thing I
[1:04:43] know is God told me I'm going to have a
[1:04:45] child and I'm going to stand here until
[1:04:48] that comes to
[1:04:51] pass so if you come it's made for those
[1:04:55] will believe and but if you come it it's
[1:04:59] made for those that would come and they
[1:05:01] will come with an expectation that will
[1:05:04] come and I want to say this even this
[1:05:06] morning when we come to the house of God
[1:05:08] we don't just come because it's a Sunday
[1:05:10] or it's another Sunday I have to go to
[1:05:12] the house of God or it's another
[1:05:14] Wednesday I have to go and all of this
[1:05:17] things but there has to be in the
[1:05:19] believer's heart and in the believer's
[1:05:22] life and expectation for the promise to
[1:05:25] come to pass and butam says if he
[1:05:27] doesn't come today he'll come tomorrow
[1:05:30] if he doesn't come tomorrow he'll come
[1:05:31] the next day and it's just not for is
[1:05:33] coming but it's for every promise I'm
[1:05:36] standing on the promise of God if he
[1:05:38] doesn't heal me today he'll heal me
[1:05:40] tomorrow if it's not today it's the next
[1:05:43] day why I'm living in constant
[1:05:46] expectation that the promise will happen
[1:05:48] at any moment that's the believer's
[1:05:51] attitude that's the approach that God is
[1:05:54] looking for God is is not wanting us to
[1:05:56] just come and sit down and say well
[1:05:58] he'll do it whenever he wants to he'll
[1:06:01] do it whenever it's time that he wants
[1:06:03] to do it no God is wanting us to come
[1:06:05] with an expectation this morning that I
[1:06:08] I'm in the house of God I'm expecting
[1:06:11] good things to happen I come to the
[1:06:13] house of God God can answer to my needs
[1:06:16] this morning whatever my need is this
[1:06:18] morning I'm on the expectation that God
[1:06:21] will speak to
[1:06:23] me we we then I continually go day in
[1:06:27] and day out and be completely tired and
[1:06:31] and that's don't know and almost barely
[1:06:33] making it no God wants us to constantly
[1:06:37] be under the expectation of his promise
[1:06:39] in our life whatever the need is every
[1:06:42] day when we walk up it's another
[1:06:44] opportunity for the supernatural to be
[1:06:46] made known unto us when we come out and
[1:06:49] and when we walk around everywhere we go
[1:06:52] it's we have to be under the expectation
[1:06:55] that there Supernatural will break in
[1:06:56] any
[1:06:58] moment so and so the scripture will say
[1:07:02] as we read and when Abraham was 99 years
[1:07:06] old it says 90 90 years old and nine and
[1:07:11] the Lord appeared unto him and said unto
[1:07:13] him I am the almighty God I love this
[1:07:20] walk before me and be thou perfect now
[1:07:23] brother Ram takes that word the almighty
[1:07:26] God it says the translation for that
[1:07:29] word is l sh L sh the L meaning the
[1:07:37] allmighty god l meaning the all
[1:07:40] sufficient God l meaning is the all
[1:07:44] powerful God in other word it's not one
[1:07:47] who's lacking anything it's not one who
[1:07:50] needs help in fulfilling anything he The
[1:07:53] God Who created heaven and earth now I I
[1:07:56] love this because if you go out
[1:07:57] throughout the scripture you go back
[1:07:59] from Genesis you find out the one thing
[1:08:02] that God is doing the the the God is
[1:08:05] constantly revealing himself to his
[1:08:07] children by changing forth his name and
[1:08:10] with every name is bringing forth a
[1:08:13] characteristic of himself that was never
[1:08:15] known before through his children he
[1:08:18] will come and he will say by my name
[1:08:20] Jehovah was I not known by this and it
[1:08:23] says I am God and in beginning God and
[1:08:27] and then he became the Lord God and and
[1:08:29] then but we talk about God and he says
[1:08:32] God is Elohim l l Elohim the one who
[1:08:37] existed by himself the one before there
[1:08:39] was an Earth was before there was an
[1:08:41] Adam before there was a void and before
[1:08:44] there was anything he was by himself and
[1:08:47] he was the god who created everything
[1:08:49] let me say this my brother my sister if
[1:08:52] God makes a promise he's able to fulfill
[1:08:54] it
[1:08:57] he's not a God who needs our help and
[1:09:00] he's not a God who need our begging and
[1:09:02] and us coming we have to judge him
[1:09:05] sufficient for the promise we have to
[1:09:07] judge him The God Who exists by himself
[1:09:10] and his L Elohim and one who's not
[1:09:13] lacking in anything and I thought about
[1:09:16] how will even say he's the the the
[1:09:19] absolute he he will pull up just forgive
[1:09:22] me if I could just pull this out he
[1:09:24] talks in the message AB Abol I thought
[1:09:26] this was just linking so perfectly
[1:09:28] paragraph 10 uh I believe it's 10 uh uh
[1:09:32] 102 one or 10 sorry in the message
[1:09:36] absolute it says I was hearing a man
[1:09:38] speaking not not long ago and he used
[1:09:41] the word absolute and I thought it's
[1:09:44] very fine word and then it says I hear
[1:09:46] many time used absolutely that's right
[1:09:49] it says now I look it up in the
[1:09:51] dictionary in the Webster according to
[1:09:54] Webster it's perfect in
[1:09:58] itself it's it's Unlimited in its power
[1:10:03] it's primarily an ultimate an ultimate
[1:10:07] is an amen that's all an absolute it's
[1:10:11] an unlimited in
[1:10:14] power in its power it says the word
[1:10:17] absolute is perfect in itself that's all
[1:10:21] it is that settles it and then I thought
[1:10:24] he said that's a glorious thing that's a
[1:10:27] wonderful thing so when God speaks it's
[1:10:30] an absolute when God speaks it's a final
[1:10:33] word when God speaks there's nothing
[1:10:36] else that could be added now in fact bam
[1:10:39] will go back and say that that that you
[1:10:42] know we understand even when Dr best was
[1:10:45] debating about the uh Jehovah of the Old
[1:10:48] Testament and Jesus Christ of the new
[1:10:50] and he will quote the scripture and say
[1:10:53] isn't the seven compound names of
[1:10:55] Jehovah in the Old Testament and all
[1:10:59] translated in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:01] why because he was wanting to bring to
[1:11:03] the people the understanding that this
[1:11:06] is the god in the Old Testament who
[1:11:08] presented himself as the Mighty God the
[1:11:11] one who existed by himself the
[1:11:13] all-sufficient God he's the god who's
[1:11:16] not liking in anything he says to the
[1:11:18] Believers now it's the name of the Lord
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ when you take the name of
[1:11:23] the Lord Jesus Christ you are taking God
[1:11:26] in his unlimited
[1:11:29] power you are taking God in the form
[1:11:33] that he wants to reveal himself you are
[1:11:36] taking God in his fullness you are
[1:11:39] taking because remember the scripture
[1:11:41] says in Christ was the fullness of God
[1:11:47] manifested and and let me say this what
[1:11:50] what God wants us when we come to his
[1:11:52] word when the word of God is presented
[1:11:54] to us he he wants us to consider in whom
[1:11:58] we are receiving the word from who are
[1:12:00] you believing in this morning you are
[1:12:03] believing in a god who's Unlimited in
[1:12:05] his
[1:12:08] power you are believing in God who's all
[1:12:12] sufficient you are believing in God who
[1:12:15] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:12:17] that's why you will look at Abraham and
[1:12:19] it says is there anything impossible to
[1:12:21] God
[1:12:26] but yet we are we are presented with
[1:12:28] challenges we we we come in and and and
[1:12:32] every day seems like the battles get
[1:12:35] harder and and and and stronger and
[1:12:38] everything and and and and often time we
[1:12:41] we fail to understand the ability that
[1:12:46] lies within the promise of God or the
[1:12:49] promise the one who gave the promise God
[1:12:52] wants us to consider him who gave the
[1:12:54] promise he wants you but will say one
[1:12:57] place that Abraham didn't even care what
[1:13:00] the promise was he didn't care what God
[1:13:04] Said was going to be why because he
[1:13:07] considered he who said the
[1:13:11] promise hear me out he didn't care how
[1:13:15] complicated how hard how impossible how
[1:13:19] extremely difficult what is it that he
[1:13:22] was asking if he was asking for a new
[1:13:24] world
[1:13:25] if it was asking for God to create
[1:13:27] something that never existed if he was
[1:13:30] asking for something that's never
[1:13:32] happened before what he cared about was
[1:13:34] who told me this whose words am I
[1:13:37] believing whose words am I standing on
[1:13:40] who's giving me this promise and he knew
[1:13:42] that if it's God that's giving me the
[1:13:44] word then I believe
[1:13:52] it he wants you to consider
[1:13:55] his
[1:13:56] abilities he wants you to consider his
[1:14:00] reputation he wants you to consider his
[1:14:05] works but one will say in the
[1:14:08] message the unconditional
[1:14:12] Covenant that God made with his
[1:14:15] people he says and now watch now first
[1:14:19] thing you
[1:14:20] know I see when is 90 and
[1:14:23] N paragraph 52 God appeared to
[1:14:28] him to conf appeared to him to kind of
[1:14:32] confirm the things 17th chapter of
[1:14:34] Genesis he appeared to him in the name
[1:14:39] elshad which
[1:14:41] eladi in the Hebrew word means the
[1:14:45] breasted the breast or the breasted one
[1:14:48] like the mother with her
[1:14:51] baby it says you take a little baby it
[1:14:55] says said now Abraham I am
[1:14:59] eladi the almighty God now you are old
[1:15:03] your strength are all gone Sarah's wom
[1:15:07] is dead she's 0 she's 90 little Grandma
[1:15:11] it says like like now great great great
[1:15:14] grandma it says 90 years old it says
[1:15:18] she's awful old and the people are
[1:15:20] laughing at you and making fun of you
[1:15:23] but I am the breasted one oh my brother
[1:15:28] my sister let me say this whenever you
[1:15:31] are waiting for the promise of God and
[1:15:33] we'll see throughout the Bible people
[1:15:36] are going to make fun of you people are
[1:15:38] going to laugh at you oh look at him and
[1:15:40] he's been waiting and nothing is
[1:15:42] happening and look at him how long are
[1:15:44] you going to keep waiting and look at
[1:15:46] you there's nothing going on people
[1:15:48] laugh at no when they went and they look
[1:15:50] at the ark they started laughing and and
[1:15:53] and they continue to preach the word
[1:15:55] continue to laugh it's going to rain
[1:15:57] it's 120 years old how long is he going
[1:15:59] to wait and he continue he never that
[1:16:02] never stopped him why because his
[1:16:04] Revelation didn't come from man he
[1:16:06] didn't do what came from man his
[1:16:09] Revelation came directly from God that's
[1:16:12] why I say this morning what we need is
[1:16:14] not an electure what we need is a true
[1:16:17] Revelation from
[1:16:21] God and they continue to make let me say
[1:16:24] this people like going to make fun of
[1:16:25] you oh where is the promise when is that
[1:16:28] baby going to come you're getting old
[1:16:30] and you passing the age it looks like
[1:16:33] it's never going to happen my brother my
[1:16:35] sister I want to say this morning you
[1:16:37] keep waiting on God God will vindicate
[1:16:42] you it says I am the breasted one like a
[1:16:46] mother now God is wanting us he's taking
[1:16:49] now the type of a believer in the word
[1:16:51] of God he's taking you as comparing the
[1:16:55] relationship between a mother and the
[1:16:57] child and I thought it's so wonderful
[1:16:59] because it doesn't matter how old you
[1:17:01] get to your mom you're still a baby to
[1:17:04] your mom you still get treated like a
[1:17:06] baby you get asked question God wants us
[1:17:09] he wants when he's looking at us he's
[1:17:11] treating us like we were baby now he's
[1:17:13] saying like like a mother with a sickly
[1:17:16] he says a Fred baby now when the little
[1:17:18] baby is all weakened and run down his
[1:17:21] strength is gone the mother pulled it
[1:17:24] right to her
[1:17:26] Bome and he says and you know the child
[1:17:29] nurses his strength from the mother the
[1:17:33] mother's strength becomes the child's
[1:17:36] strength as he draws from
[1:17:41] her my brother my sister don't get tired
[1:17:44] when is Rapture going to come it's going
[1:17:46] to come when God wants it to come when
[1:17:49] am I going to get my healing it's going
[1:17:50] to come when God wants it to come when
[1:17:52] am I going to get a child it's going to
[1:17:54] come when God wants it to come but in
[1:17:57] the meantime God wants you to nurse of
[1:17:59] the promise because within that promise
[1:18:03] not only is going to produce a child but
[1:18:05] it will give you the strength that you
[1:18:07] need while you're waiting for the
[1:18:13] child let let me ask you how did you get
[1:18:16] here this morning what brought you here
[1:18:19] this morning is the strength of the
[1:18:21] promise that you are nourishing on
[1:18:25] is the strength of the Rapture promise
[1:18:27] if God is going to Rapture you God has
[1:18:30] to put you in Rapture
[1:18:34] condition and if God is going to put you
[1:18:37] in Rapture condition he has to work on
[1:18:39] you daily to put you in a Rapture
[1:18:43] condition so when the time has come you
[1:18:45] are taken out of
[1:18:47] here it's not a waking up in the morning
[1:18:50] one day and then say Oh Rapture is here
[1:18:53] no it's a and daily walking and
[1:18:56] nourishing from the strength of the
[1:18:58] promise and God constantly putting his
[1:19:01] strength in you why because what as you
[1:19:06] nourish as you pull off the strength of
[1:19:09] the promise as you feed on the promise
[1:19:12] you are gaining the strength from the
[1:19:15] promise 52 he said and so he said now
[1:19:20] Abraham you are old you are past the age
[1:19:23] and Sarah is past the age age but I have
[1:19:26] the bless I have to bless her through
[1:19:28] you so you just lean upon my bosom just
[1:19:33] keep nursing amen hallelujah I'll give
[1:19:36] you your strength draw it of
[1:19:41] me he he he's not sending you somewhere
[1:19:44] to go get your strength he's not saying
[1:19:48] while you waiting for the promise I need
[1:19:50] you to master up all the strength that
[1:19:52] you can and then at the end say Well
[1:19:55] done yes a promise no while you are
[1:19:58] waiting for the promise I want you to
[1:20:00] nurse I want you to get to draw your
[1:20:03] strength out of me Oh my he says now
[1:20:08] watch the breasted one not one but two
[1:20:13] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:20:15] with the stripes we are healed just turn
[1:20:18] your head yet that turn your head if you
[1:20:21] need healing amen and the breast of God
[1:20:25] that's what I mean it says in so many
[1:20:28] words Abraham I am the breast of God now
[1:20:32] I will have to I says I will have to do
[1:20:36] I'll have I'll give you eternal life by
[1:20:38] nursing from from here now I'm going to
[1:20:41] do some Divine Healing in your body if
[1:20:45] you will nurse from
[1:20:52] here but one of them will say
[1:21:04] he's the same paragraph
[1:21:07] 54 he's the same El sh ey
[1:21:15] tonight and I think this is
[1:21:18] where uh we we we instead of and I want
[1:21:21] to say this instead of using your mind
[1:21:23] use your heart
[1:21:25] because often time we try to put all the
[1:21:27] numbers and everything up if it matches
[1:21:31] and why am I saying that if you don't
[1:21:34] understand it you don't have to just
[1:21:38] believe if you don't understand it how
[1:21:41] is it the same I don't understand it
[1:21:44] just believe why because whatam said
[1:21:47] that the Jehovah all the all the Old
[1:21:50] Testament is Jesus Christ of the new
[1:21:53] that all that God was every bit every
[1:21:57] attribute remember what was he in the
[1:21:59] Old Testament he was the Fulfillment of
[1:22:02] all the promises that all the prophet
[1:22:04] have talked about that's why brother I'm
[1:22:06] could say that if you go back and you
[1:22:08] read your Bible you read the whole
[1:22:10] testimony says if you don't see Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ go read it again why because he
[1:22:15] was everything that the prophet talked
[1:22:17] about in fact brother will go that's why
[1:22:20] Jesus Christ never wrote any book why
[1:22:22] because he was the Fulfillment of
[1:22:24] everything that was
[1:22:25] written he didn't need to write one it
[1:22:28] was already written about him and all he
[1:22:30] did is he came back and he fulfill
[1:22:33] everything that was written on
[1:22:35] him and if Jesus did so he should you
[1:22:39] why because the bride is part of the
[1:22:41] bridegroom if Jesus fulfilled everything
[1:22:44] that was written of him the bride in the
[1:22:46] end time will fulfill everything that's
[1:22:49] written of
[1:22:51] her you say why you tell me how Jesus
[1:22:55] fulfilled his I'll tell you how you
[1:22:57] fulfill yours how did he fulfill it it
[1:23:00] was the word of God by the spirit of God
[1:23:04] because remember everything that was
[1:23:06] written of him the scripture says that
[1:23:08] no propety no prophecy of of is of anyit
[1:23:12] interpretation that the word can never
[1:23:14] be broken God by his power made it to
[1:23:18] come to pass and if he made it for him
[1:23:21] he's going to do it for you
[1:23:29] it
[1:23:29] says it's the same as shal tonight he
[1:23:33] changes not and and it says and his
[1:23:36] Covenant with his people is the same
[1:23:38] privilege to draw from the same
[1:23:40] resources that Father Abraham had drawn
[1:23:44] he says cause God SW he says he swore by
[1:23:48] the same
[1:23:49] Covenant that he give up that is that he
[1:23:52] give us uh that give us the promise
[1:23:55] hallelujah oh my there you are that's
[1:23:57] where my hope is built upon nothing less
[1:24:00] but Jesus blood and his righteousness it
[1:24:03] says well all around my soul gives way
[1:24:06] is my hope and stay on Christ the solid
[1:24:09] rock I Stand All Out the grounds are
[1:24:11] sinking tent there you are
[1:24:14] elhadi the bosom the breast of God if
[1:24:19] you need salvation for your weak Soul
[1:24:22] draw from this side if you need healing
[1:24:25] for your body draw from this side my for
[1:24:29] my Covenant was with Christ my son and
[1:24:33] in there was was wounded for your
[1:24:37] transgression and he was by his stripes
[1:24:40] you will heal I am the almighty just
[1:24:44] lean upon just lean up here and go to
[1:24:48] draw from them
[1:24:51] promises oh my brother my sister that's
[1:24:54] why the B the prophet will tell us it's
[1:24:57] important for us to read our Bibles and
[1:24:59] pray why because when we are reading we
[1:25:01] are drawing strength for the day for the
[1:25:05] challenge that's in front of us by
[1:25:07] reading our Bible and praying we are
[1:25:09] drawing the strength of the Living God
[1:25:12] of the god who's never fail of the god
[1:25:15] who's Unlimited in power of the god
[1:25:18] who's all sufficient we are drawing his
[1:25:20] strength into our bodies
[1:25:26] th this is not a natural
[1:25:29] Affair this is not often time how we do
[1:25:33] it where we we we draw a promise and or
[1:25:36] we we we go into the word of God and and
[1:25:39] and we try to figure out something or or
[1:25:42] a scripture that we never seen before or
[1:25:46] or something that we can debate with no
[1:25:48] that's the wrong approach the approach
[1:25:51] is I have a need in my body the approach
[1:25:54] is I need healing in my body I need
[1:25:56] Deliverance in my body I have a problem
[1:25:59] that I need a solution I'm going to grow
[1:26:02] from elsh I'm going to go strength from
[1:26:05] the scripture and his strength will
[1:26:07] become my
[1:26:09] strength his overcoming will become my
[1:26:21] overcoming in the message
[1:26:24] the approach to God but one of will uses
[1:26:28] and it's the
[1:26:29] same he's speaking about the same thing
[1:26:32] but he's bringing it from a different
[1:26:33] angle it
[1:26:42] says paragraph 50 approach to God he
[1:26:46] says now the Hebrew
[1:26:49] word L Almighty means elsh which means
[1:26:54] the almighty
[1:26:56] God l means god and Shad means breast
[1:27:01] Shi in the plural I am the
[1:27:06] allmighty the strong one the alls
[1:27:09] sufficient one you see
[1:27:13] it we didn't come this is not a
[1:27:15] gathering to a man this is not a
[1:27:18] gathering for us to just read some
[1:27:20] scriptures and go home this is the
[1:27:23] understanding that we are in the
[1:27:25] presence of the almighty God this is an
[1:27:29] understanding to the believer that when
[1:27:30] I become a Christian I don't longer
[1:27:33] belong to myself I believe I belong to
[1:27:36] an almighty God I belong to someone
[1:27:38] who's more powerful it's his
[1:27:41] responsibility to feed me it's his
[1:27:43] responsibility to take care of me when I
[1:27:46] when I become when I believe his word
[1:27:49] I'm taking him at his word I'm
[1:27:51] transferring my responsibility over to
[1:27:53] him him I'm taking in him his word and
[1:27:57] he's the one who's going to protect
[1:27:59] me it says now Abraham watch what what
[1:28:03] was what was the name he says watch
[1:28:05] watch the
[1:28:07] name that he that he appeared I am Al
[1:28:10] Shadi in other word I am the breasted
[1:28:13] one it says the god the it says really
[1:28:17] really the word Shad comes from the in
[1:28:21] the Bible it means uh it means woman the
[1:28:24] woman that says the place the nursing
[1:28:28] place of a baby in other words it says
[1:28:30] in other words Abraham I am the strong
[1:28:34] one listen to this I am the
[1:28:42] lifegiver I am the lifegiver not only a
[1:28:46] lifegiver like the baby fright I am the
[1:28:50] satisfier
[1:28:55] oh my brother my sister often time we
[1:28:57] try to draw satisfaction from the things
[1:29:00] of the world let me say this alcohol
[1:29:02] doesn't provide satisfaction drugs will
[1:29:05] not provide satisfaction the things of
[1:29:08] the world will not provide satisfaction
[1:29:10] it will only provide a temporary
[1:29:13] satisfaction if you want to drown away
[1:29:15] your problem you drink once you you get
[1:29:18] sober your problems will be waiting for
[1:29:20] you but if you come and you nurse from
[1:29:23] this house I once you come sober your
[1:29:26] problems are
[1:29:30] gone I am the
[1:29:32] satisfier I am the one who actually
[1:29:35] quenches The Thirst whatever you have
[1:29:38] need of I can actually give you
[1:29:43] satisfaction do we understand that well
[1:29:46] well I tell you life can bring you all
[1:29:49] kinds of trouble life is full of trouble
[1:29:52] every day but where can you find
[1:29:54] satisfaction God is saying I'm the only
[1:29:57] one who can provide
[1:30:00] satisfaction today it's this problem
[1:30:03] tomorrow it's another problem if we live
[1:30:05] long enough it's just stumbling from
[1:30:07] trouble to trouble but oh there's only
[1:30:09] one that can
[1:30:15] satisfy you know you you you can go the
[1:30:18] scripture says that sin will take you
[1:30:20] farther than you want to go but it never
[1:30:22] says that uh sin will actually satisfy
[1:30:25] you what is it what what is it doing
[1:30:28] it's only taking you away for something
[1:30:31] that actually brings through
[1:30:34] satisfaction I never heard a man say oh
[1:30:37] I got drunk and I was really
[1:30:43] satisfied oh I was dragged up and I was
[1:30:45] really satisfied oh I did this and the
[1:30:49] moment that is done you come right back
[1:30:52] to where you started
[1:30:54] but this is satisfaction for eternity
[1:30:57] that's why let me say this my brother my
[1:30:59] S when God Saves you it's the permanent
[1:31:03] satisfaction you never want the things
[1:31:05] of the world
[1:31:07] anymore when God comes and he does a
[1:31:09] work in your life he saved you from the
[1:31:12] things of the world and every time you
[1:31:14] come closer to it your heart don't want
[1:31:16] anything to do with
[1:31:20] it now we have all kinds of stuff we
[1:31:23] have you know all kinds of social media
[1:31:26] anything you like there is out
[1:31:29] there but does it provide satisfaction
[1:31:32] zero if it does how come the people that
[1:31:35] are producing content they're killing
[1:31:38] themselves if they were really satisfied
[1:31:41] how come their satisfaction lead to
[1:31:44] death the scripture says the wages of
[1:31:47] sin is
[1:31:49] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:31:52] life and let me say this that's the only
[1:31:55] satisfaction there is in the
[1:32:00] world the
[1:32:03] satisfier oh I love
[1:32:06] this I want satisfaction this morning
[1:32:10] you know David will say though I walk
[1:32:14] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:32:16] death behold thou are with me it says it
[1:32:21] doesn't matter it says I believe it's in
[1:32:24] Psalm 119 it says though I made my bed
[1:32:28] in hell behold thou are there though I
[1:32:32] run to the uttermost part of the O the
[1:32:35] Earth behold th are there there's no
[1:32:38] place I can hide from thee it says my
[1:32:41] members were made before you you know
[1:32:44] everything about me when I was curiously
[1:32:46] wed I knew all about me it says such
[1:32:50] knowledge is too wonderful I cannot
[1:32:52] attain it with my mind
[1:32:54] but that's the only thing that's satisfy
[1:32:57] when you have the understanding that God
[1:32:59] knows me more than I even know
[1:33:02] myself I can never run from
[1:33:05] him they said
[1:33:07] oh that's why the scripture will say
[1:33:10] that it's not necessarily the situation
[1:33:12] that you are going through is to know
[1:33:14] that God is with me it doesn't matter
[1:33:16] what I go through but what I'm looking
[1:33:18] for is God are you really with me
[1:33:21] because if you are with me then I'm
[1:33:23] satisfied
[1:33:24] my satisfaction doesn't come because of
[1:33:26] how the circumstance turned because if
[1:33:29] that's the case then every day I'm in a
[1:33:31] different mood every day when the
[1:33:33] circumstance goes a different way then
[1:33:35] I'm not satisfied anymore but my
[1:33:37] satisfaction whether be good whether it
[1:33:40] be bad whether it goes according to my
[1:33:42] thinking or not my thinking one thing I
[1:33:44] know is God is with me blessed be the
[1:33:47] name of the
[1:33:50] Lord you know I like this I think it was
[1:33:52] Brother David who said it you know
[1:33:54] people are are trying to present a
[1:33:57] Christianity that's void of
[1:34:00] testing that's void of it it seems like
[1:34:02] a happy all the time just flying around
[1:34:06] oh God is good and all the time and on
[1:34:08] all of those things no it's one who can
[1:34:11] understand that regardless of what I'm
[1:34:13] going through regardless of my
[1:34:15] circumstance regardless of how terrible
[1:34:19] the things are how hard the battle is
[1:34:21] I'm still going to serve him because his
[1:34:24] goodness is far exceeding everything
[1:34:26] that I can
[1:34:29] see God is not building up some hot
[1:34:33] horse plant and and some things that
[1:34:35] need to be purer God is looking for some
[1:34:38] original Believers those that can stand
[1:34:41] there but what I'm says the original has
[1:34:44] the repellent built in it you don't have
[1:34:46] to spray
[1:34:48] it but stand there and say devil depart
[1:34:52] away from me they can stand there they
[1:34:55] can endure challenges they can do
[1:34:58] difficulties they can go through trials
[1:35:01] they can be tempted over let me say this
[1:35:04] job was
[1:35:06] tempted job was tempted and I have a
[1:35:09] here and I probably even won't read it
[1:35:11] but says job didn't approach it and said
[1:35:15] oh I hope so one day I'll see God and in
[1:35:18] my Temptation it says no he looked at
[1:35:21] his condition he looked but what I'm
[1:35:24] said that God gave him a vision and he
[1:35:26] saw the Lord Jesus Christ and he looked
[1:35:29] at everything that he was going through
[1:35:31] and he says I know my redeemer
[1:35:35] liveth and if my redeemer liveth I shall
[1:35:39] live
[1:35:42] also as long as he lives I cannot die it
[1:35:47] doesn't matter what what the the flesh
[1:35:50] what this flesh goes through but one
[1:35:52] thing I know is if God is real I will
[1:35:55] stay
[1:35:59] here
[1:36:01] no the end time is for those that are
[1:36:04] rooted and grounded those that will
[1:36:07] stand the test of time to know that
[1:36:10] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:36:12] and
[1:36:15] forever sorry I got off my sub
[1:36:25] I
[1:36:26] am the
[1:36:51] satisfier he says in paragraph 51 of the
[1:36:55] approach to
[1:37:02] God the little
[1:37:04] baby if it's fretting
[1:37:08] sick still got the tummy AEG oh I love
[1:37:12] this and as long as it's laying in his
[1:37:15] mother's arm
[1:37:16] nursing it satisfies
[1:37:19] him it says oh my you get it he may be
[1:37:23] sick and his little head is swimming all
[1:37:27] around and everything else but if he's
[1:37:30] laying in on his mom's breast on his
[1:37:33] mother's breast nursing it pacifies him
[1:37:38] no matter how sick you are what takes
[1:37:42] place how long the Lord is answering how
[1:37:46] long it says as long as you are laying
[1:37:49] in on his breast pulling from the word
[1:37:54] it satisfies the
[1:38:00] Believers the now the connection is not
[1:38:03] you through somebody else and then
[1:38:06] through God the connection is not the
[1:38:08] Believers to the pastors and then to God
[1:38:11] or the Believers to some no this is a
[1:38:13] personal relationship to understand that
[1:38:16] God is my mother God is my strength God
[1:38:21] is the one that I'm drawing for I have a
[1:38:24] reput I have a relationship with him the
[1:38:27] life that's in me comes from him I'm
[1:38:30] here because he placed that life inside
[1:38:33] of me and that life cannot survive by
[1:38:35] itself I cannot feed the things of the
[1:38:38] world and accept that life to no as long
[1:38:40] as I'm laying in his bosom I'm laying
[1:38:44] there and drawing strength from his word
[1:38:48] that is
[1:38:50] satisfying it says that's my Approach
[1:38:54] he said that's the way I'm asking you to
[1:38:57] approach me I am your
[1:39:00] satisfier do you believe it he said he
[1:39:04] said you are a hundred years old but you
[1:39:07] are just a baby to me I love that you
[1:39:11] are 100 years old but you're just a baby
[1:39:14] to me well he said look at my flesh how
[1:39:18] it is wrinkled up and my hair is gray
[1:39:21] and my shoulders are Stoopid
[1:39:23] but I am the lifegiver amen that's it
[1:39:27] Abraham do you see it Abraham believed
[1:39:30] God he believed God and then ca he says
[1:39:35] he approached through the symbol through
[1:39:37] his name he says so we and approach
[1:39:41] through his name Jesus what does Jesus
[1:39:44] mean to us savior amen elsh ey to
[1:39:49] Abraham satisfier strong one salvation
[1:39:53] salvation Giver strength Giver the same
[1:39:56] thing elhadi was to Abraham Jesus is to
[1:40:01] the
[1:40:02] believer oh
[1:40:04] my that doesn't just carry you
[1:40:08] away what Jehovah was to Abraham Jesus
[1:40:13] Christ is to the believer tonight this
[1:40:15] morning to just say you are my
[1:40:19] satisfier now I know I don't want to I
[1:40:22] could just go I don't want to take too
[1:40:24] long I want to say this the trouble is
[1:40:28] our approach is mostly most of the time
[1:40:32] intellectual and I I just hope I could
[1:40:34] say this to help us the the the trouble
[1:40:37] we run into is we try to come by
[1:40:40] intellect we try to approach with the
[1:40:42] human faith our faith is tied to how are
[1:40:46] the circumstance going if the
[1:40:48] circumstances is tending towards the
[1:40:50] good my faith is increasing if my
[1:40:53] circumstance starts to go towards the
[1:40:55] bed my faith is going down that's not
[1:40:58] how God wants us to
[1:41:00] approach the the trouble is our faith is
[1:41:03] too much dependent on what we see the
[1:41:06] the the the our faith we are we we have
[1:41:08] a hop so we have an approach where it
[1:41:12] seems like we are not really sure we
[1:41:14] have this attitude this passive attitude
[1:41:17] is God really going to do it if he does
[1:41:19] it that's good if he doesn't do it
[1:41:21] that's okay too no God is Not not
[1:41:23] looking for that God wants us to believe
[1:41:25] no matter
[1:41:27] what but whatam says this in the message
[1:41:31] the handmade of the Lord is upon me upon
[1:41:33] him the hand of the Lord is upon Him
[1:41:36] paragraph 11 it says the salvation of
[1:41:39] Jesus Christ is not a hope Soul it's a
[1:41:43] no
[1:41:46] soul the salvation of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:49] Christ the salvation of Jesus Christ is
[1:41:52] not a hope hope so it's a no so you know
[1:41:56] when you are it says you know when you
[1:41:58] are when when you are Christ he says the
[1:42:01] Holy Spirit Bear record with you your
[1:42:04] spirit that you are a son and a daughter
[1:42:06] of God the old things are passed away
[1:42:09] All Things become new and I hope we get
[1:42:12] it tonight not a borderline Minister not
[1:42:15] a borderline Christian it it it says if
[1:42:18] it's a if it's a crowd that's going this
[1:42:21] way
[1:42:23] you go with it and if it's that way you
[1:42:25] go with it stay in the road stand in the
[1:42:30] Liberty where Christ had made you free
[1:42:33] be not again entangled in the Yoke of
[1:42:36] your bondage or halfway God said it make
[1:42:40] it stick said I would it says I would it
[1:42:44] says how would you I would you would not
[1:42:48] uh be hot or cold or for look warm I
[1:42:51] will spew you out of my mouth so God
[1:42:53] doesn't want a person that's just a
[1:42:58] professor without being a
[1:43:01] possessor oh of all the of the blessings
[1:43:06] of God God grant to the they it says
[1:43:10] hurries to uh Louisville Kentucky and
[1:43:14] All America when Christians that
[1:43:16] professes to be Christian will just it
[1:43:19] says will be just what they profess to
[1:43:21] be God granted so in other word when we
[1:43:24] come we have to come with a
[1:43:27] determination we have to come with
[1:43:29] expectation we have to come knowing that
[1:43:32] if God said it because he's the almighty
[1:43:35] God he's going to bring it to pass if
[1:43:37] God said it because is the god who never
[1:43:40] failed he's going to bring it to pass so
[1:43:42] our approach to God is I have been born
[1:43:46] again I have been redeemed from sin I've
[1:43:49] been saved from the things of the world
[1:43:51] I'm here because God told me to be here
[1:43:54] and God is here to fulfill his
[1:44:01] promise God don't want us to be church
[1:44:06] members you
[1:44:09] know if we're not
[1:44:13] careful the only identification we have
[1:44:15] is what church we go
[1:44:19] to you said no
[1:44:21] no well
[1:44:24] but when I remember he was about to pray
[1:44:25] for that lady and the other one says
[1:44:29] close the
[1:44:30] curtain it says well AR you a Christian
[1:44:33] it says I'm a
[1:44:36] Methodist it seems like we have the same
[1:44:38] behavior today aren't you a Believer
[1:44:41] well I'll go to Christian Life
[1:44:43] Tabernacle I go to uh what so so in
[1:44:47] church we become identified to some
[1:44:50] preachers some church that becomes your
[1:44:55] identification that's not your
[1:44:58] identification it doesn't matter where
[1:45:00] you go the question is do you have a
[1:45:03] relationship with him do you know him
[1:45:07] has he done a work in your life and if
[1:45:09] he has then then seek to establish a
[1:45:13] personal relationship then your
[1:45:15] identification is not a church
[1:45:17] relationship but it's him you and him
[1:45:20] relationship
[1:45:26] and here's another one I'm a message
[1:45:31] believer what do that even
[1:45:35] mean what is that even
[1:45:38] mean you don't come for communion you
[1:45:41] don't come on Wednesday you don't come
[1:45:43] Sunday night you're a message
[1:45:47] believer I just said
[1:45:51] it what is our
[1:45:55] identification God is not interested in
[1:45:58] us carrying up some
[1:46:00] name he wants us to bear his
[1:46:03] life he wants his life to be your life
[1:46:08] he wants what's in him to become yours
[1:46:11] but what I'm saying this it's like it's
[1:46:13] like a piece of the laundry the Chinese
[1:46:15] Laundry man remember he talks about that
[1:46:17] he says what God does he says he takes
[1:46:20] the two pieces
[1:46:21] of it's a same piece of paper God takes
[1:46:25] it and then he cuts it in two it says
[1:46:27] now one God has it the other is in your
[1:46:31] heart so when you hear the message of
[1:46:33] the hour when he come through the
[1:46:35] message of the hour when others are
[1:46:38] rejecting it when others are calling it
[1:46:40] a name when others are just producing it
[1:46:43] and looking at it intellectually but
[1:46:45] into your heart is the two pieces coming
[1:46:48] together what God is looking for and the
[1:46:51] prophet said what God is trying to do is
[1:46:54] to take the life that was in Christ who
[1:46:57] was dead and crucified Calvary he says
[1:47:00] he took his body up on high and he takes
[1:47:03] his spirit and he send it to the
[1:47:06] believer the same life that was in
[1:47:11] Christ when that life was in Christ the
[1:47:15] scripture says it was his custom to go
[1:47:18] to
[1:47:19] church when that life that was in Christ
[1:47:23] was in Christ the scripture says that he
[1:47:25] only did what pleased the father when
[1:47:29] our life was manifested in Christ the
[1:47:31] scripture says that he gave himself for
[1:47:33] the need of others when that life was
[1:47:36] manifested in Christ he said that I have
[1:47:39] it says I only do what the father showed
[1:47:42] me now when when that same life is in
[1:47:45] you what is that life manifesting
[1:47:54] God God is not interested in us being
[1:47:56] church
[1:48:00] members
[1:48:03] now
[1:48:10] remember but but but I'm going to say
[1:48:12] this we we heard it in the message how
[1:48:14] can I overcome he says to
[1:48:18] overcome is to keep life in you
[1:48:25] he didn't say to overcome is to keep all
[1:48:27] the doctrines and know every scripture
[1:48:31] and know how to translate it and know
[1:48:33] just exactly what it means the
[1:48:36] overcoming is to keep life whose life it
[1:48:40] is the Life of Christ in
[1:48:43] you in fact it said there are those that
[1:48:46] are in in the church it talks about the
[1:48:49] log in the water and the purpose of the
[1:48:53] water is to give life to the log but the
[1:48:56] log is is rotten right being in the
[1:49:01] water why because it didn't keep the
[1:49:04] life in
[1:49:08] it let me say this the things of the
[1:49:11] world are not made to keep the life in
[1:49:15] you everything that's out there is made
[1:49:19] to challenge and try to take every bit
[1:49:21] of the Life of Christ Christ out of
[1:49:26] you this happen and this will go on and
[1:49:29] and and somebody tell me if there's ever
[1:49:32] been anybody who's gotten money and
[1:49:34] gotten enough and say I got enough money
[1:49:37] and I'm satisfied I mean if Elon musque
[1:49:40] is not satisfied who can
[1:49:46] be it's the nature of the
[1:49:51] world who who can build enough of the
[1:49:54] worldly things and say I have built
[1:49:57] enough now I can go serve
[1:50:03] god what the devil wants you to do we we
[1:50:07] we rather we we listen to it the other
[1:50:09] time he wants you to focus on the things
[1:50:12] that are concerning him so in the
[1:50:15] meantime as you are doing your life that
[1:50:18] is supposed to grow in Christ is
[1:50:21] dwindling it's getting weak it's getting
[1:50:24] frat it's getting low oh my brother my
[1:50:27] sister this morning God saying that if
[1:50:30] your life is gotten low just come to the
[1:50:32] breasted one this morning just come to
[1:50:35] mcdc this morning just come to alaria
[1:50:38] this morning drink from the breasted one
[1:50:41] nurse from him and he will restore your
[1:50:45] strength he's not condemning you for
[1:50:48] going after the things of the world he's
[1:50:50] reminding you this morning that what you
[1:50:52] need to put your focus on is to put your
[1:50:55] focus on the life that he's placed
[1:50:57] inside of
[1:51:03] you I'll just skip some for the sake of
[1:51:08] time it's the promise that God has given
[1:51:14] you that will keep
[1:51:18] you but want say
[1:51:26] he said that God
[1:51:29] Abraham being fully
[1:51:33] persuaded that he was able persuaded of
[1:51:37] who of God that he was able to keep that
[1:51:41] which he had promised and Bam says this
[1:51:46] if God has made a
[1:51:49] promise God will keep that promise
[1:51:56] that is just as simple as could be don't
[1:51:59] don't complicate it don't don't don't go
[1:52:03] and change the circumstance and see if
[1:52:06] the answer is going to change it
[1:52:10] doesn't if God made a promise God will
[1:52:14] keep the
[1:52:15] promise if God made a promise that he
[1:52:18] will save you it doesn't matter how deep
[1:52:21] in sin you are he will save
[1:52:24] you if God made a promise he will heal
[1:52:27] you it doesn't matter how sick you are
[1:52:30] if the doctors are saying that death is
[1:52:33] the next step it doesn't matter because
[1:52:36] if God made a promise he will heal you
[1:52:38] God will heal
[1:52:40] you being fully persu he says God will
[1:52:43] he being fully persuaded that that what
[1:52:47] God had uh he promised he was able to
[1:52:49] perform it God keeps his promise and
[1:52:53] Abraham was fully persuaded no matter
[1:52:56] how ridiculous it looks to the conal
[1:52:59] mind or any or anyone else he says it
[1:53:04] looked all right to Abraham because
[1:53:07] Abraham never looked so much at what the
[1:53:12] promise was how ridiculous it was he
[1:53:15] looked at who gave the
[1:53:19] promise it depended on what it depends
[1:53:23] on what you are looking at so if you are
[1:53:27] looking at how difficult the promise is
[1:53:29] that's a problem but if you are looking
[1:53:32] at who made you the promise then he's
[1:53:35] able to bring it to
[1:53:48] pass then I ask you this morning
[1:53:54] who are you believing in this
[1:54:00] morning whose promise Are you standing
[1:54:02] on this
[1:54:05] morning the god of the Bible is the
[1:54:08] Alpha and the
[1:54:11] Omega is the beginning and the
[1:54:14] end the promise that he has given you
[1:54:18] was in existence before there was an
[1:54:21] Adam a molecule or anything
[1:54:25] else think about
[1:54:28] it but one them
[1:54:30] says before there was a sickness there
[1:54:33] had to be a
[1:54:36] Healer otherwise it would run in
[1:54:38] contradiction with God being all
[1:54:40] sufficient or An
[1:54:43] Almighty in other word before your
[1:54:45] problem came into an
[1:54:47] existence God already made a reservation
[1:54:51] for a solution to that
[1:54:54] problem before you can run into the
[1:54:56] situation that you are in this morning
[1:54:59] there was provision in God for you in
[1:55:02] fact let me say this when he thought
[1:55:04] about you he thought about the
[1:55:07] overcoming power that you needed for
[1:55:09] every circumstance that will come along
[1:55:11] your way so when he made the promise
[1:55:14] when he made when he made you he made
[1:55:17] also the promise of overcoming with you
[1:55:22] so he didn't make you and say
[1:55:24] well now Billy's got all the challenges
[1:55:27] that he's going through how are we going
[1:55:29] to save him from it no remember the
[1:55:31] scripture says that the lamb was slain
[1:55:34] before the foundation of the world the
[1:55:37] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:55:39] the world why was the lamb slang before
[1:55:41] the foundation of the
[1:55:43] world it was to take care of all the
[1:55:46] challenges it was to cover up for all
[1:55:48] the things that's going to happen and
[1:55:50] then when he makes the promise is for
[1:55:52] him to know that when I make the promise
[1:55:55] the promise will come to pass exactly as
[1:55:58] I made
[1:56:08] it if the musician will
[1:56:21] come what
[1:56:27] say God doesn't learn
[1:56:34] anything when he makes a
[1:56:37] promise he doesn't do something and then
[1:56:40] come back and fixes it and say the first
[1:56:43] way I did it is not really right I need
[1:56:45] to go back and change it it says when
[1:56:48] he's done something when he speaks a
[1:56:51] word that remain remains for
[1:56:53] eternity when he does something he does
[1:56:55] it it says if God can learn then he's
[1:56:58] really not
[1:56:59] God then he really not all sufficient
[1:57:03] but when God speaks something it's the
[1:57:05] same for
[1:57:08] eternity and it
[1:57:11] says God hasn't learned it is not CAU by
[1:57:16] surprise he's the same everything that
[1:57:19] he spoke from the beginning is the same
[1:57:22] every time so those who trust in him the
[1:57:25] scripture will say will never be
[1:57:29] ashamed if you stand upon the promise of
[1:57:32] God it doesn't matter how ridiculous it
[1:57:35] looks it doesn't matter how dark it gets
[1:57:38] it doesn't matter how terrible the
[1:57:41] situation looks like if you stand upon
[1:57:43] the the word of God God will make his
[1:57:46] promise to come true what he's asking
[1:57:49] from us this morning is do you believe
[1:57:51] my word word Are you standing upon my
[1:57:54] promise Are you standing upon what I
[1:57:56] have given are you feeding are you
[1:57:59] Nursing From The Promise because if you
[1:58:02] are then you cannot fail as much as God
[1:58:05] cannot
[1:58:08] fail but what I'm say that when God
[1:58:11] calls a Believer he gives you something
[1:58:13] to believe with that's
[1:58:16] right when God calls a preacher he gives
[1:58:19] you something to preach with
[1:58:22] it's not even your own faith it's the
[1:58:24] faith of God but says I believe it's in
[1:58:27] uh uh uh uh perfect Faith the to the
[1:58:31] believer it's the faith of God that
[1:58:34] moves in
[1:58:36] them it's the faith of God that brought
[1:58:39] you to church this morning it's the
[1:58:42] faith of God that makes you an overcomer
[1:58:44] it's the faith of God that causes you to
[1:58:47] come here it's the faith of God when you
[1:58:49] run into trouble that Faith begin begin
[1:58:52] to go to battle that Faith begin to move
[1:58:54] that Faith begin to feed upon the word
[1:58:56] of God that Faith begin to move around
[1:58:59] it's the faith of God that does the work
[1:59:02] all he's asked you to believe all he ask
[1:59:04] you to do is to believe his
[1:59:08] word oh I came across this
[1:59:12] and I'm pretty sure some of you have
[1:59:14] heard it it's called Uh footstep up
[1:59:17] footsteps upon the sand of time and and
[1:59:21] it's speaks and it speaks about a man
[1:59:24] and who wrote this I believe it's a poem
[1:59:27] and he and he wrote and he says it says
[1:59:30] this it says one night a man had a dream
[1:59:34] and and he dreamed he was walking along
[1:59:37] the beach with the Lord across a
[1:59:41] colorful Sky flashing scene from his
[1:59:45] life for each scene he noticed two sets
[1:59:49] of footprint one belonging to him and
[1:59:52] the other belonging to God to the
[1:59:55] Lord it says when the last scene of his
[1:59:58] life flashed before him he looked back
[2:00:02] at the footprint and noticed that many
[2:00:05] times along the path of his life there
[2:00:08] was only one set of footprint Footprints
[2:00:12] he also
[2:00:14] noticed that it happens at the very
[2:00:16] lowest and saddest time in his life this
[2:00:20] really bothered him
[2:00:22] and he questioned the Lord about it and
[2:00:24] he says Lord you said that once I
[2:00:27] decided to believe you that you will
[2:00:29] walk with me all the way but I noticed
[2:00:33] that during my most Troublesome time in
[2:00:35] my life there's only one set of
[2:00:39] footprint maybe that's how you feel
[2:00:42] toight you said you know I I go
[2:00:44] sometimes and I I I pray it seems like
[2:00:47] heaven is shut up I ask it seems like it
[2:00:51] never really had happens and and and I
[2:00:53] knock it seems like opportunities are
[2:00:55] just fleeing away and I I seek it seems
[2:00:59] like I can't find and it seems like I'm
[2:01:01] stuck I I just don't know what to do it
[2:01:04] seems like I'm all alone and God is not
[2:01:06] even hearing my
[2:01:08] prayer it said I see one foot Sprint I
[2:01:11] don't understand why when I needed you
[2:01:15] the most you abandon
[2:01:18] me and he said the Lord said unto him my
[2:01:21] pray Precious Precious Child I love you
[2:01:26] and I will never leave you it says
[2:01:29] during your times of trials and
[2:01:32] tribulation when you see only one set of
[2:01:35] footprint it was then that I was caring
[2:01:39] you the only reason you didn't see the
[2:01:42] other footprint is because you were in
[2:01:44] my arm the only reason you didn't see
[2:01:46] the other of footprint you were nursing
[2:01:48] from me for my strength the only time
[2:01:51] you see that one set of footprint is
[2:01:53] because you didn't have the strength to
[2:01:55] carry on you couldn't put your foot in
[2:01:58] front of the other you didn't know what
[2:02:00] I was doing what you were doing and it
[2:02:02] is in that time that I picked you up I
[2:02:04] carried you over why because I made a
[2:02:07] promise to you I'll never leave you I'll
[2:02:10] be with you till the end my brother my
[2:02:12] sister that's the same promise is made
[2:02:14] to you
[2:02:16] tonight let me say this there's only one
[2:02:19] man who has the right to say that God
[2:02:22] has forsaken me and that was Jesus
[2:02:24] Christ why because heaven forsake Him
[2:02:27] Earth forsake Him why God forsake Him so
[2:02:31] you don't have to be
[2:02:33] forsaken you don't have the right to use
[2:02:36] that scripture and say God you forsaken
[2:02:38] me why because he forsook Christ so you
[2:02:41] don't have to be
[2:02:44] forsaken the one fruit print you see
[2:02:47] it's him taking you in his arm and
[2:02:50] walking you over and and understanding
[2:02:53] your need and saying you don't
[2:02:55] understand what I'm doing you don't
[2:02:58] understand where that opportunity was
[2:02:59] shut up you don't understand what that
[2:03:01] opportunity was shut up why because it
[2:03:04] was going to lead you astray it was
[2:03:06] going to take you in the path that you
[2:03:07] didn't know it was when you were lacking
[2:03:09] strength I am El Shadi ey whatever
[2:03:13] you're going through this morning you

[2:04:13] Abraham now after Abraham when he was 9
[2:04:16] and9 years old the Lord came to him
[2:04:18] chapter 17 the next chapter and God
[2:04:20] appeared to him and said when he
[2:04:22] appeared to him him to this time he
[2:04:25] appeared to
[2:04:26] him in the name the almighty God the

[2:05:04] good as dead after he has made him a
[2:05:08] promise that he was going to have a baby
