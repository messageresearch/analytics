[7:52] is what i call it
[7:53] [Music]
[7:55] you could have a cold you could have a
[7:58] regular
[7:58] ordinary flu you could have an allergy
[8:03] but everything nowadays is clumped into
[8:06] one
[8:08] big disease so
[8:11] everybody if you're sick you're sick
[8:13] you're only sick with one thing
[8:15] so just to be safe what we'd like to do
[8:17] is just take these next four services
[8:20] off not off but have live stream
[8:24] you can still support the church online
[8:27] or you can mail your offering or
[8:30] whatever you want to do to keep us
[8:32] running financially
[8:34] or you can just hold it over until we
[8:36] come back again
[8:37] but don't forget us and so we're just
[8:40] going to do that and then you look at
[8:42] yourselves watch yourselves if you're
[8:44] still feeling good
[8:46] you haven't come down sick with anything
[8:49] then everybody's just safe
[8:53] so i think that's the best approach we
[8:55] have just clip it in the bud
[8:57] don't let anything spread through the
[8:59] congregation
[9:01] uh the couple of people that have tested
[9:04] positive they
[9:05] they're a hundred percent they don't
[9:07] have any uh
[9:09] symptoms whatsoever i think they call
[9:11] that being asymptomatic
[9:13] so we just wanted to take control of it
[9:16] real early
[9:17] put an end to it don't let it spread
[9:20] anybody that's sick can run their course
[9:24] and you just watch yourself over the
[9:26] next two weeks and
[9:27] if everybody's fine and we don't have a
[9:30] any type of outbreak or a lot of people
[9:33] coming down sick
[9:34] the people that are sick now will be
[9:36] better by then
[9:38] and then we can be able to come back
[9:40] together
[9:41] it's very difficult on me to make these
[9:44] decisions
[9:44] but i really do it with
[9:48] in my heart what i feel is best for the
[9:51] body
[9:52] best for our reputation uh
[9:55] best for our due diligence
[9:58] and uh so we know the lord's been
[10:01] merciful and gracious to us and he's
[10:03] just
[10:04] showered us with blessings so we're
[10:07] thankful to him
[10:08] and we commit everything into his hands
[10:10] so i hope you understand remember if you
[10:13] have any questions
[10:15] feel free to call me the children's
[10:18] sunday school
[10:19] will outing which was planned for the
[10:22] 31st
[10:24] that will be postponed uh one
[10:27] weekend i believe till november 7th
[10:30] so we're not going to do it on the 31st
[10:33] we're going to do the young
[10:35] sunday school age outing on the 7th
[10:39] i think the youth get together
[10:42] on the 30th i believe that will be the
[10:46] same i'm not sure on the date on that
[10:49] but so that's what we are
[10:50] and we're back to preaching to an
[10:53] invisible
[10:54] congregation but the holy spirit's
[10:57] invisible
[10:58] amen but yet we know that he's here
[11:00] because we see the
[11:02] results and the sign of his presence we
[11:05] don't see
[11:06] jesus christ in the physical but yet we
[11:08] know when he comes by
[11:10] because people are made well people are
[11:12] delivered people are uplifted because
[11:15] our god
[11:16] lives so lord richly bless you tonight
[11:19] we're going to
[11:20] ask cosman to come and sing and
[11:24] there's no congregation to cover
[11:27] his singing up so i but i know it's good
[11:30] so worship at home
[11:32] be a part of god's plan at home
[11:35] and november 1st we'll gather back
[11:37] together
[11:39] in the framework of our sanctuary but
[11:42] right now let's gather together around
[11:44] god's word
[11:45] and worship in the name of the lord
[11:47] jesus in the presence of
[11:49] his spirit so let's bow our heads as we

[12:26] heart in feasting at the work
[12:29] and father i ask that
[12:32] with no visible pull from the people but
[12:36] that he could feel the push of your holy
[12:39] spirit
[12:40] he can just feel the word just move
[12:42] through him
[12:44] though it might appear that he's
[12:46] preaching to empty walls
[12:49] may he know that your spirit can move on

[32:38] god
[32:39] and the word of the lord came unto him
[32:41] saying get the
[32:42] hands and turn eastward
[32:45] and hide thyself by the brook
[32:49] cherub cherith and
[32:53] that is before jordan and it shall be
[32:56] that thou
[32:57] shalt drink of the brook and i will i
[32:59] have commanded
[33:00] the ravens to feed there to feed thee
[33:03] there

[33:06] of the lord
[33:07] for he went and dwelt in the brook
[33:10] cherith and before that is before jordan
[33:13] and the raven brought him bright and
[33:15] and and fresh and fit and flesh
[33:19] in the morning and bread and fresh in

[34:18] certain of god
[34:20] and that's where this thought just came
[34:22] to me i was just
[34:24] you know meditating on it and it came on
[34:26] my heart to just speak on that
[34:28] um and so as we read the scripture
[34:31] we realized even as i continue
[34:35] in first kings chapter 17 i believe in
[34:38] verse 14
[34:40] 13 it says and elijah went unto her
[34:43] speaking of the woman that he commanded
[34:45] for her for him to
[34:47] for her to feed him he says and he said
[34:50] unto her
[34:50] fear not go and do as thou
[34:54] has said but make make me before
[34:58] of the cake first and bring unto me and
[35:01] after make one for thee and thy son
[35:04] for thou saith the lord the god of
[35:06] israel
[35:07] the barrel of of mill shall not waste
[35:09] neither shall the cruce of oil fail
[35:12] until the day that the lord send it rain
[35:14] upon the earth and she went and did
[35:17] according to the word of the prophet
[35:20] she went and did according to the word
[35:22] uh according to the word saying of
[35:24] elijah and she
[35:25] and and and he and the and and her house
[35:29] it did eat many days and the barrel of
[35:32] meal wasn't
[35:33] wasted not neither did the cruise of oil
[35:36] fail according to the word of the lord
[35:38] which
[35:38] he spake by elijah so verbatim
[35:41] makes this statement and i thought you
[35:44] know it was just at the very beginning
[35:47] he begins he reads this paragraph i'll
[35:49] just read and he says now
[35:51] now lord bless thy word as it goes forth
[35:55] and many uh many of the holy
[35:59] spirit captures our mind may the holy
[36:02] spirit capture
[36:02] our mind and our thoughts and prepare us
[36:05] for his visitation
[36:06] as we have asked of him for we do not
[36:09] come to the house of the lord to be seen
[36:12] or to see but to learn of thee
[36:16] and and that to know thy nature
[36:20] and thy ways that causes
[36:23] that we might be able to face the
[36:26] problems
[36:26] of life with the with the real assurance
[36:29] being certain of god
[36:31] so i just thought this spoke to me even
[36:34] in regards to everything to just know
[36:36] that we want to face the problems of
[36:38] life with the real assurance to be
[36:41] certain of god
[36:42] it says in the name of the lord jesus
[36:44] amen and i thought
[36:46] you know you think about what was
[36:48] happening at that time you think about
[36:50] the conditions
[36:51] and i thought you know brother brian i'm
[36:53] even describing this so
[36:55] in so eloquent words it says now elijah
[36:58] came and says that by the word of the
[37:00] lord it says
[37:01] i'll say it spoke to the king saying
[37:03] that there shall not be
[37:05] any rain according to my word because it
[37:08] was spoken of him to go
[37:10] and to speak to the king so we find out
[37:12] that those things
[37:13] happen and you begin to imagine what was
[37:16] the the time and the situation that was
[37:19] transpiring in that land
[37:21] because of lack of rain you realize that
[37:23] everything began to dry up you look at
[37:27] the condition it says it became a very
[37:30] uh
[37:30] hot time because there was no rain so
[37:32] there was
[37:33] dust everywhere i was thinking about the
[37:36] fruits that were
[37:37] close to maturity how that because of
[37:40] lack of rain
[37:41] they begin to dry up and they begin to
[37:44] just become
[37:45] very mediocre and everything you think
[37:47] about
[37:48] people in the land because we we live we
[37:51] know there's a principle that you plant
[37:53] and when you water the seed it's going
[37:55] to come out and people will rejoice and
[37:57] eat off the fruit of it
[37:58] but you realize that all of those things
[38:01] were
[38:02] were taken away they were not able to
[38:04] plant and to rip
[38:05] off the the the harvest of the hard work
[38:09] i began to think about even permanent
[38:10] i'm talking about a cactus you look at a
[38:13] plant that's supposed to be a beautiful
[38:15] flower
[38:16] but because his condition was changed
[38:19] and
[38:19] there was no water a plant that was
[38:21] supposed to be a beautiful flower
[38:23] began to change because things were no
[38:25] longer the same
[38:27] things changed the condition changed and
[38:30] that was apparent by
[38:31] everything that was around them they
[38:33] could walk around and begin to see
[38:36] that life was not the same as it used to
[38:38] be
[38:39] uh no doubt that they could have uh had
[38:42] some buckets of water or some containers
[38:45] places where they
[38:46] save water but as this began to go on
[38:49] and on
[38:50] they will go and use of that water and
[38:52] come to a place where they didn't have
[38:54] any more water and
[38:55] no doubt there were those that were
[38:57] crying because of famine and things and
[38:59] and you begin to realize it was such a a
[39:03] condition that was really bad we can
[39:05] even look at today
[39:07] the prophet looks at it and he picks it
[39:09] up he says that was kind of the
[39:11] condition
[39:11] things are changing things are not the
[39:14] same
[39:15] things are no longer reliable where they
[39:17] need to be and everything
[39:18] and and so i was looking at even the
[39:21] very definition of being
[39:22] certain it talks about to know for sure
[39:25] to be
[39:26] established beyond the doubt to come
[39:29] something that is
[39:30] unquestionable something that is sure
[39:33] something that is definite so you find
[39:36] out that
[39:36] it's in the times like that that
[39:38] somebody needs to be
[39:40] sure of what god is and who he is
[39:43] it's in the time where there is
[39:45] uncertainty where situation
[39:47] don't seem to be the same anymore where
[39:50] you know we live in the time where
[39:52] man has put all his confidence in
[39:55] science they're
[39:56] praying and wanting to see a solution
[39:58] come out
[39:59] and they putting all the goods they're
[40:02] putting all the eggs in one basket
[40:04] hoping that somebody will come up with
[40:06] the solution churches and everybody and
[40:09] they the church wall they're looking and
[40:11] and praying and
[40:12] hoping and and coming to a place and
[40:15] nothing is happening
[40:16] it's in that time that a true believer
[40:19] needs to know that there's a living god
[40:22] and the living god is about his own
[40:24] business is in the process of bringing
[40:27] his word to come to pass
[40:29] that we we we can come here tonight and
[40:31] those that are home
[40:33] and we can have an assurance that the
[40:35] things that are upon us
[40:36] those things didn't come upon us unaware
[40:39] these things were promised they will
[40:41] come these things are a prophecy that's
[40:44] coming to pass
[40:45] but we understand that in the same time
[40:47] there's always
[40:48] god always has a true believer who would
[40:51] stay
[40:52] with his word amen so we find out as we
[40:56] we just talked and and so they began
[40:59] to look at the situation and they began
[41:01] to realize that life was no longer the
[41:03] same
[41:04] and things were going to change forever
[41:06] they will never be the same like they
[41:08] were before
[41:09] but you realize that the the the reason
[41:12] why they got in the situation that they
[41:14] were in
[41:15] was because they rejected god
[41:18] they rejected the promises of god and
[41:21] they they had a king and and the
[41:24] scripture says that
[41:25] ahab was the most evil king that israel
[41:28] has ever had
[41:29] and the reason being because here is one
[41:32] who knew better
[41:33] about the word of god who was instructed
[41:36] and knew the ways of god
[41:38] there is one who comes and he goes out
[41:41] and
[41:41] marries uh uh the daughter of the king
[41:44] of tyra
[41:45] jezebel and he brings her into the
[41:47] kingdom
[41:48] and from there uh idolatry began to be
[41:52] introduced in
[41:53] israel it came to a place where uh
[41:56] they would worship the the unknown god
[41:59] and they will worship this god and
[42:01] they'll have
[42:01] all kinds of gods for everything and and
[42:04] and you cannot prevent them except
[42:06] statement you cannot displease
[42:09] god and keep on going in the same way
[42:12] and i hope nothing will happen the world
[42:15] cannot reject the word of god that was
[42:17] sent to them
[42:18] and expect to roll out with the programs
[42:21] and
[42:21] and to do to get married and to drink
[42:24] and to do all those things
[42:26] and continue on and think like life is
[42:28] going to go on
[42:29] no there is a creator of this earth he
[42:32] created it for a purpose
[42:34] he brought it here in order for him to
[42:36] achieve his purpose
[42:37] and once his purpose is done he will do
[42:40] away with all of it
[42:41] and those that are part of his program
[42:44] are going to be saved
[42:45] those that are going to be part of his
[42:47] program and he's doing and what he wants
[42:49] to do at the very end
[42:51] those are the only ones that are going
[42:52] to be saved and so
[42:55] so we find out when him speaks and i
[42:57] thought that's what's so wonderful
[42:59] he he speaks and and he begins to say he
[43:02] says
[43:02] what we need today is not a lot of
[43:05] material thing
[43:06] so we can come out because remember
[43:09] these people they knew better to serve
[43:12] god
[43:13] they knew better that there were a
[43:14] people that were given the name of god
[43:17] he called them and he says this was my
[43:19] people and
[43:20] and they were raised to be the people of
[43:22] god him
[43:23] the people that god himself put his name
[43:25] on them that all the nations will look
[43:28] at upon them
[43:29] as the standard that god wanted to
[43:31] elevate that those that will believe
[43:33] will be based upon
[43:34] what they see god do with this nation
[43:36] but yet there were
[43:38] with the king who didn't know who didn't
[43:40] obey anything of god
[43:42] they prabhanam says they came to a place
[43:44] where what the king said
[43:46] uh the priest looked at it and they
[43:49] followed through
[43:50] in other words what the government said
[43:52] and what the priest looked at and said
[43:54] well
[43:54] if the king said we're going to do this
[43:56] then we should be fine with it
[43:59] a believer doesn't do what the king says
[44:02] a believer has another king and that's
[44:04] jesus christ
[44:05] a believer has another king and that's
[44:07] the creator of heaven
[44:09] we only do what the word says we only do
[44:12] what god
[44:12] said and then from then on he began to
[44:15] talk about how
[44:16] the moral became to go down and all the
[44:19] situation began to deteriorate
[44:22] why because they elected the king and
[44:24] they enjoyed the things of the world
[44:26] and they thought by just coming and
[44:28] offering sacrifices
[44:30] that will be acceptable they taught the
[44:32] things that they can just comment
[44:34] and follow in this religious realm and
[44:37] and they thought that was acceptable
[44:38] god is not interested in our religion
[44:41] god is not interested in our gathering
[44:43] as people
[44:44] god is looking for spiritual sons and
[44:47] daughters
[44:48] those that will be led by his spirit
[44:51] those that will be led by
[44:52] him the holy spirit dwelling inside of
[44:55] them
[44:55] guiding them every day
[44:58] if you follow what politics says it will
[45:01] be one thing today will be another
[45:02] tomorrow
[45:03] if you follow what a man say they will
[45:05] tell you this today and tell you
[45:06] tomorrow
[45:07] oh but there's one when he says what he
[45:10] says
[45:10] is true for now till the end of time
[45:13] what he says
[45:13] is true and it will never change so he
[45:17] says here what we need is not material
[45:19] thing and i want to tell us
[45:20] what we need today is not somebody to
[45:23] come up with the vaccine
[45:24] because once we get the vaccine for this
[45:27] one when the next diseases
[45:28] will be in line for us to get another
[45:30] vaccine from another person
[45:32] and then if you give us another one when
[45:34] something else come
[45:36] we'll be in line waiting for that one
[45:37] person to do what we need today is not a
[45:40] stimulus
[45:41] they will give you one today next year
[45:43] you need another one
[45:44] but it says what we what we meet today
[45:46] is not material thing
[45:48] what we need today is the power of god
[45:51] to come into the church
[45:53] so we can become to a place where we are
[45:55] elevated and taken out of this earth
[45:58] where this world means absolutely
[46:00] nothing for us
[46:01] where we reject all the things of the
[46:03] world where our soul is in connection
[46:05] with the one who made us the one who
[46:08] sent us here
[46:09] where we could be in purpose for the
[46:11] father the things that he wants to see
[46:13] out of us
[46:14] where we are have nothing we have no
[46:16] agenda
[46:17] about what god desires to see out of us
[46:21] the thing that we get a fact is is when
[46:24] we find ourselves caught up in the
[46:26] things of the world
[46:27] caught up in this and caught up in that
[46:29] and because we are caught up
[46:31] we begin to innocent and want something
[46:33] good to come out of it
[46:35] because we have a hulk and we have this
[46:37] we have we are part of this program
[46:39] we are part of that program therefore
[46:41] the program has to work
[46:43] in order for us to be sustained oh but
[46:45] there's one program
[46:46] that works today and will work forever
[46:49] that's the program of god
[46:52] what we need today is not material thing
[46:55] we have that what we what he says
[46:58] we don't have we don't need the greater
[47:00] churches
[47:01] we don't need greater congregation we
[47:04] don't need more radio and tv television
[47:07] we don't need many and many more things
[47:09] of these things
[47:10] but what we need today what we need
[47:13] today
[47:14] to be spiritual to be to be spiritual
[47:18] is the person that will humble
[47:20] themselves before god
[47:22] if they don't have a penny they will
[47:24] they will pray till
[47:26] their spirit within them is satisfied
[47:29] with the goodness of god
[47:32] oh i tell you our god is wonderful i
[47:35] tell you
[47:36] if there's a people in the midst of all
[47:38] of this
[47:39] that can just sit and begin to rejoice
[47:42] and begin to sing the presence of god
[47:45] it's the children of god why
[47:47] because the scripture tells us that
[47:49] heaven and earth will pass away
[47:51] but my word will never pass away my
[47:53] brother my sister if they give you a
[47:55] house today
[47:56] you will live and you'll live you'll go
[47:58] out of here and leave that house behind
[48:00] if you had all the lands you own it
[48:02] until you die
[48:03] if you had all the money you buy all the
[48:05] things that you want but you couldn't
[48:07] buy
[48:07] life but we have a god who's giving us
[48:10] eternal life
[48:11] i tell you this well from within me i
[48:13] begin to think about this thing
[48:15] this comes us and brings us to a place
[48:17] where we get to be so
[48:19] thankful about eternal life because you
[48:21] begin to realize
[48:22] after all this world is nothing after
[48:25] all this world
[48:26] it will go back from where it came from
[48:29] after all this world is nothing but
[48:31] death this world will offer nothing but
[48:33] death
[48:34] but we have eternal life in christ jesus
[48:37] and we can begin to rejoice in those
[48:39] things
[48:41] he says what we need in the spirit is to
[48:45] humble ourselves themselves
[48:47] before god even if it says
[48:50] if they don't have a penny and they will
[48:53] pray
[48:54] till the spirit within them is satisfied
[48:56] with the goodness of god
[48:59] and a revival take place inside of the
[49:03] heart
[49:04] the change that that changes the
[49:06] attitude
[49:07] and the atmosphere that they live in it
[49:10] says
[49:11] you might not have a pair of shoes on
[49:13] your feet you might not dress
[49:15] you might you might be dressed in rags
[49:17] but something in your heart is singing
[49:19] the melody of god
[49:21] i'd rather have it i'd rather have it
[49:23] than all
[49:24] than all the money in the world so you
[49:27] don't say
[49:28] the natural things is always the signs
[49:30] that god is a blessing
[49:32] david spoke in uh uh david spoke that
[49:35] the lord
[49:36] he says that he had seen the wicked
[49:39] spread forth like a great uh bay tree
[49:44] he says but god asked him did you ever
[49:46] consider
[49:47] uh him at the end no matter how good
[49:51] of clothes we were how much we have to
[49:54] eat
[49:54] that isn't what we got that what goes in
[49:57] the presence of god
[49:59] this body that we have we we we dwell in
[50:02] perishes regardless how it be it will be
[50:05] taken care of but there's a soul that's
[50:08] in the man
[50:09] it's a condition that the spirit that
[50:12] must
[50:13] must that must move into the presence of
[50:16] the living god
[50:17] we need to move into that condition
[50:20] where we are moved into the presence of
[50:23] god
[50:24] it's like the tabernacle once you're
[50:26] still on the outside
[50:27] you're affected by the sunlight you're
[50:29] affected by the rain
[50:31] when you move into the holy place you
[50:33] are affected by the light
[50:35] about the candlesticks and all those
[50:37] things but god is calling his church to
[50:40] move into the holies of holies
[50:42] a place where sun like this is gonna not
[50:44] gonna affect us
[50:45] rain is not gonna affect us the kind of
[50:48] light is not gonna affect us
[50:49] what we are secured with him in that
[50:52] place
[50:53] whatever happens to in in the world we
[50:55] have a joy
[50:56] we have something within our heart that
[50:58] rejoices about the goodness of god
[51:01] why because we have seen him do
[51:03] according to his word
[51:05] [Music]
[51:06] god i'll say this god is not a guy who
[51:09] hides himself in
[51:12] in times of hard time and and like just
[51:14] left his children
[51:15] to fend for themselves no it's not that
[51:18] kind of god
[51:19] in fact it's a god who wants to see you
[51:22] in that condition
[51:23] so he himself can come and make himself
[51:25] known unto you
[51:27] and show you who he is he's the god who
[51:29] will let you try all that you want
[51:31] you go you do all that you want after
[51:33] you fail you come to realize
[51:35] where is your goodness coming from it's
[51:37] coming from him
[51:40] amen he says you find our prayer our
[51:43] prayer meetings are so weak
[51:46] just about a minute of prayer jump in
[51:49] bed
[51:50] and we find out we find that that
[51:52] happens about once
[51:53] twice a day when all
[51:56] when all of us are guilty our nation
[51:59] moral decay
[52:01] we've got billy graham and our robert
[52:03] everywhere
[52:04] but until they can they there comes
[52:07] a thirst in the heart of america
[52:10] to bring it back to a living god again
[52:14] by the living experience not some dead
[52:17] experience where we can come and say
[52:19] well you know i gave my heart to the
[52:20] lord and no no where you've come in
[52:23] contact with that goodness of god
[52:25] where you know i only live because he
[52:28] let me live
[52:29] i should have died i should have not
[52:31] been here
[52:32] the life that which i now live like paul
[52:35] said i live by the grace of god
[52:37] who loved me and you gave himself for me
[52:40] i know
[52:40] that from the way that i was growing the
[52:43] end of it was
[52:44] death i know from the things that i was
[52:46] doing the end of it was death
[52:48] but if i can stand here and speak to you
[52:51] i'm speaking from the goodness of god
[52:54] who loved me and gave me a chance
[52:56] for me to live this life and testify of
[52:59] his goodness everywhere
[53:01] and be a testimony for people to know
[53:03] that there is a living god
[53:05] that's the kind of experience he's
[53:07] looking for he's not looking for some
[53:09] educated punch that will just come and
[53:11] speak about
[53:12] what they know what they've learned out
[53:14] of the bible he wants to not just be the
[53:16] god of the bible but he wants to be your
[53:18] god
[53:19] one that you can speak to what did what
[53:22] where do you find him you find him in
[53:24] your closet
[53:25] on your knees you call upon his name and
[53:27] he comes and he talks to you
[53:31] now i'll say this this is just a
[53:32] foretaste of things to come
[53:34] we are promised the churches will be
[53:36] closed we are promised that persecution
[53:39] will come upon us
[53:40] we are promised that all those things
[53:42] will happen but how do we
[53:44] how do we save ourselves from all those
[53:46] things is to get
[53:47] into his presence to be satisfied like
[53:50] the prophet is talking about
[53:52] a soul that is satisfied with the
[53:54] goodness of god
[53:56] where you know it's not riches that i'm
[53:58] interested in
[53:59] it's not money that i'm interested in
[54:01] i'm interested in the goodness of god
[54:04] where i can look at myself and see that
[54:06] god
[54:07] is walking with me
[54:10] he says to bring it back to the living
[54:14] god the living experience
[54:16] to the undying faith in the living god
[54:20] we are only beating our brains out as it
[54:22] would say
[54:24] we would say out it says we might walk
[54:27] with our chest out without a collar
[54:31] turned
[54:32] turn turned in the back walk down the
[54:34] streets
[54:36] and and desire to be called doctor and
[54:39] reverend
[54:40] you might be pastor you might you you
[54:42] might pass to the greatest
[54:44] church that there is in the land you
[54:46] might be
[54:48] as pious as could be that man he
[54:52] says that no man can put a finger on
[54:55] your life
[54:56] but but until that soul
[54:59] that's on the inside of us is on fire
[55:03] for god
[55:05] is on fire for god it says
[55:09] until something in there that is
[55:11] yearning
[55:12] after him like that like the heart
[55:15] planet for the water brooks
[55:17] it says my soul thirsteth for thee oh
[55:19] god
[55:20] until we get to that type of experience
[55:23] i tell you we we so attached to the
[55:26] world
[55:26] we live in the world every day we
[55:28] communicate with it we touch it
[55:30] we through our five senses and all those
[55:32] things and
[55:33] if we are not careful it rubs off of us
[55:36] that's why we continually have to be
[55:37] washed by the water of the word
[55:39] but the soul when it comes to the end of
[55:42] it
[55:42] when it comes to the essence of who we
[55:44] are it has to be that soul that stands
[55:47] alone
[55:48] and desire god more than anything in the
[55:50] world
[55:54] so he speaks on
[55:57] it says he speaks on
[56:00] it says it talks about this woman
[56:03] as we read the condition of the people
[56:06] and
[56:07] and and and what random speaks and it
[56:09] continues on
[56:10] it speaks about how they came to a place
[56:13] where
[56:14] uh basically the the permanent
[56:18] speaks about this king ahab he says he
[56:20] came to a place where
[56:22] because he says in his reign that he had
[56:25] a greater
[56:26] army he had such a powerful army
[56:29] so he thought that god was with him and
[56:32] he said that
[56:32] people under his uh reign were
[56:35] prospering
[56:37] they were doing well they had all kinds
[56:40] of things that they desired they were
[56:41] prospering
[56:43] and that was an indication for him that
[56:45] they had god
[56:47] and then he says but yet within that
[56:49] condition they began to exalt those
[56:51] things
[56:52] and because they had goods because they
[56:54] had theirs it means god was with them
[56:57] and and that's why he makes that
[56:58] statement to say that
[57:00] just because you have worthly good it
[57:02] means absolutely
[57:03] nothing god is not with it's not with
[57:05] those that have
[57:06] not easy just the god who does that
[57:09] don't have he gives according to his
[57:11] will
[57:12] but is a god who protects his children
[57:14] they begin to elevate those things
[57:17] and before too long those things begin
[57:19] to take the place of god within their
[57:21] hearts
[57:24] and that's the challenge with a believer
[57:26] is we constantly have to come to a place
[57:28] if we are not careful the things of the
[57:31] world don't take the first place
[57:33] but ram says a man makes of everything
[57:36] an idol
[57:37] you makes your job an idol you makes a
[57:40] movie story in idol
[57:41] and we can say well i don't watch movie
[57:43] your job could be your idol
[57:45] and i began to think about this you know
[57:48] we come to the place
[57:50] if we're not careful we begin to elevate
[57:53] fear
[57:53] so much that we cannot operate
[57:57] until we feel like what we have to do
[57:59] has to go above our fears
[58:02] we elevate fear so much until we choke
[58:06] out the faith
[58:07] we don't give faith the room to operate
[58:10] we get to such a place where you know we
[58:13] have to touch it in order for us to
[58:15] believe it
[58:15] we have to see it with our eyes in order
[58:18] to believe it we have to come out in
[58:20] contact with it
[58:21] god is not called us to be that kind of
[58:23] people god
[58:24] has not called us to operate by the five
[58:27] senses of outside
[58:28] neither the five senses of the spirit
[58:30] god has called the people
[58:32] that would look at the situation when
[58:35] the senses tell them that this
[58:36] is impossible and they will acknowledge
[58:39] this is impossible
[58:40] but yet they will come to a place where
[58:42] they know that i have a god
[58:45] i have a faith within me that i have god
[58:48] who can move this mountain in front of
[58:50] me
[58:50] i have a god who can change the
[58:52] situation that i'm in
[58:54] i have a god who can blind the eyes like
[58:56] he did in the time of elijah
[58:58] i have a god who can open the right sea
[59:00] like he did with the children of israel
[59:02] i have a god who can bring healing
[59:04] whatever the need is
[59:06] god is here to bring it to pass
[59:10] if we elevate our fear where do we leave
[59:13] room for that faith to operate
[59:15] because remember during this condition
[59:18] where
[59:18] things seem to have been deteriorated in
[59:21] israel
[59:22] god had the sweeter woman and i was so
[59:25] struck how the
[59:26] the bible writes it now this woman was a
[59:29] widow woman
[59:30] and for all i know she was desperate she
[59:32] was a
[59:33] a woman she didn't have anybody to
[59:35] support her
[59:36] she had to do the best that she can to
[59:38] take care of her baby
[59:40] boy and she added everything and and and
[59:43] she was
[59:43] one who's in the position where they've
[59:46] lost somebody
[59:47] and and the part of them is hurting one
[59:50] who's in the position where
[59:52] they lack all the resources like to the
[59:54] other one
[59:55] and but yet brother the scripture is
[59:57] speaking where
[59:58] the bible says that god is telling his
[1:00:01] messenger
[1:00:02] that i have commanded a with a woman
[1:00:06] oh my i thought that just struck my
[1:00:08] heart when i read it
[1:00:10] i have commanded it with a woman and yet
[1:00:12] this widow woman sits here
[1:00:14] with no knowledge of what's happening
[1:00:16] about her
[1:00:18] with no knowledge of what god has been
[1:00:20] saying about her
[1:00:21] oh i tell you in this end time god has
[1:00:24] sent
[1:00:24] the people on earth they may look weak
[1:00:27] and
[1:00:27] they may look not strong and all those
[1:00:29] things but god
[1:00:31] has commanded them to manifest this word
[1:00:33] of the end time
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:36] not because of our might not because of
[1:00:39] our strength
[1:00:40] but because it's the commandment from
[1:00:42] god so therefore when this messenger
[1:00:44] came
[1:00:45] and as she began to speak as he began to
[1:00:47] speak the word to her
[1:00:49] even after she came to a place he says
[1:00:51] it says
[1:00:52] give me water he says well you know
[1:00:56] water no doubt if i give him a cup i may
[1:00:59] have another two cup for me i'm not
[1:01:00] bored
[1:01:01] so we should be able to drink it and
[1:01:02] that's no problem and as you turn
[1:01:05] around to go get water it says the
[1:01:08] messenger said again it says
[1:01:10] as you go get me water make sure you
[1:01:13] bring me a muscle of bread
[1:01:15] oh that struck home that struck home
[1:01:19] you talk about reading the mind and
[1:01:21] reading the spirit
[1:01:22] that really touched home only she knew
[1:01:25] what was about to happen i'll tell you
[1:01:28] this she was
[1:01:29] cooking it to eat it so they can die
[1:01:32] she was ready and prepared to die but
[1:01:35] oh my god takes the very meal that they
[1:01:38] can eat and die
[1:01:39] he takes it and he turns it into a meal
[1:01:42] that produces
[1:01:43] life that's the kind of god we're
[1:01:45] serving
[1:01:46] he says you make it to me first you
[1:01:48] bring it to me first
[1:01:50] you just go and do as you said you've
[1:01:52] prepared it
[1:01:53] you've taken the the flour and you've
[1:01:55] mixed it with oil
[1:01:57] you've taken the word and mixed it with
[1:01:59] all you've done well
[1:02:00] and now you're about to put the fire off
[1:02:02] the holy spirit on it
[1:02:03] after you've done that don't take it for
[1:02:06] yourself
[1:02:06] bring it to me first and after i eat it
[1:02:09] according to the word of the living god
[1:02:12] oh i tell you that woman was a believer
[1:02:14] she didn't go and take half a cake and
[1:02:16] say
[1:02:17] well i'll give you half and keep half no
[1:02:19] she took it
[1:02:20] according to the word but madam says
[1:02:23] elijah obeyed the word the woman who
[1:02:25] paid the word
[1:02:26] oh you take two people there forbade the
[1:02:28] world come together
[1:02:30] something is bound to happen
[1:02:34] oftentimes we run into situations
[1:02:36] because we either don't obey what he's
[1:02:38] told us to do
[1:02:40] we either don't have the confidence to
[1:02:42] stay with what he's told us
[1:02:44] but oh if we can only stay with what he
[1:02:46] said
[1:02:47] if we can only take him by his word i'll
[1:02:50] tell you this
[1:02:51] it's in the uncertain time that you need
[1:02:54] to know that there's a living god
[1:02:56] the prophet speaks and he says he says
[1:02:59] he speaks about this woman he says
[1:03:02] oh how that little woman must have been
[1:03:06] must have been off her caliber of elijah
[1:03:09] so she takes the woman
[1:03:11] and elevates him on the caliber of
[1:03:14] elijah
[1:03:15] it says because why because usually your
[1:03:19] action shows who you are
[1:03:21] oh i thought that was so wonderful oh
[1:03:23] because your action shows who you are
[1:03:25] and again she had been chosen to
[1:03:28] entertain the prophet
[1:03:30] she was chosen for that purpose remember
[1:03:34] she was a gentile not a jew it says and
[1:03:37] the land was burning up
[1:03:39] and no doubt that that this little woman
[1:03:42] being of this caliber
[1:03:44] being a believer type for we see that
[1:03:46] god
[1:03:47] would not have called her if she was
[1:03:50] if she hadn't been uh worthy of the en
[1:03:53] to entertain the prophet
[1:03:54] for he would never send a prophet to to
[1:03:57] to a house that was unworthy it was not
[1:04:01] he uh if it was not his choosing
[1:04:05] it was god's choosing it wasn't her
[1:04:08] abiding in him
[1:04:09] it was god abiding in him he had been
[1:04:13] placed by the brook the raven
[1:04:16] with uh where were feeding him
[1:04:20] but when when by went to a believer of
[1:04:23] the same nature as of
[1:04:25] elijah she was a widow woman and we all
[1:04:28] know
[1:04:29] uh we all know what she
[1:04:32] a widow woman would have been with a
[1:04:35] went through
[1:04:36] with her husband dead and a young boy to
[1:04:38] raise
[1:04:39] oh i thought that was so wonderful
[1:04:42] it's not she it's not she that chose to
[1:04:45] be there
[1:04:46] it's god that shows her it's god that
[1:04:49] place said to
[1:04:50] the place that she was the role that she
[1:04:52] was playing in this plan of god
[1:04:55] it was a role that was given by god to
[1:04:58] her
[1:04:58] oh if we can only play the role that's
[1:05:01] been given to us
[1:05:02] we are not called to produce anything
[1:05:04] like our pastor said last sunday
[1:05:06] we are not called to produce or to
[1:05:09] manufacture something
[1:05:10] we are only called to believe the word
[1:05:13] and let god
[1:05:14] take that word and manifest it into our
[1:05:16] life the only thing we are called to do
[1:05:19] is to be obedient to the word that we
[1:05:21] have received
[1:05:22] oh i began to think yes the land that's
[1:05:25] dying and
[1:05:26] people are dying everywhere people
[1:05:28] screaming
[1:05:29] and all that does the head money the
[1:05:32] puppy had enough saved up where they
[1:05:34] could live
[1:05:36] and they were rejoicing within their
[1:05:37] homes because they had set up all that
[1:05:40] but yet all the people over here were
[1:05:42] suffering but in that situation
[1:05:45] god wanted to make sure that he has a
[1:05:47] witness on earth
[1:05:48] to show that his word was true god
[1:05:51] wanted to make sure that people knew
[1:05:53] that he was a living god god wanted us
[1:05:56] to use the scripture today
[1:05:58] and to sit here and quote off the bible
[1:06:00] and be reminded of the woman of saratha
[1:06:03] how that she believed and god came on
[1:06:06] the scene
[1:06:07] god wanted to make sure that people knew
[1:06:09] that he was a living god
[1:06:11] he was the one who had it all under his
[1:06:13] control nothing is out of cater he knows
[1:06:16] everything
[1:06:19] but what we need to do is to move in the
[1:06:22] holy of holiest place
[1:06:25] perhaps we stay too much on the outer
[1:06:27] court
[1:06:28] we've been affected by the sunlight and
[1:06:30] by the rain
[1:06:32] perhaps we've been affected by the
[1:06:33] candlesticks
[1:06:35] we've been affected by the lights and
[1:06:38] how
[1:06:38] the oil runs out and it goes down and we
[1:06:41] have to power it up and put more oil
[1:06:43] and turn it back on god wants us to move
[1:06:46] into that place
[1:06:47] it's remember it's the uncertain time
[1:06:50] that you need to make sure that there's
[1:06:52] a certain god
[1:06:55] but when i'm sad and then we find out
[1:06:58] that no doubt she went and prayed at
[1:07:00] night
[1:07:01] oh she went and prayed
[1:07:04] he said perhaps the barrel was full she
[1:07:07] kept praying that god will
[1:07:09] provide something before everything goes
[1:07:12] down
[1:07:13] and they said god just certainly kept
[1:07:15] looking
[1:07:16] and watching in her it says she prayed
[1:07:19] and the
[1:07:19] the flower kept going low the oil kept
[1:07:22] going low
[1:07:23] and she prayed that she prayed perhaps
[1:07:26] the night before she felt like she just
[1:07:28] needed to pray a little differently
[1:07:30] oh she prayed out and prayed and prayed
[1:07:34] it said because the night before he
[1:07:36] talks about how her son
[1:07:38] began to christ as mama i want to eat he
[1:07:41] says i know you're hungry but let's wait
[1:07:43] until the morning
[1:07:44] let's just wait until the morning
[1:07:46] perhaps god will do something
[1:07:48] it comes and she prays and nothing seems
[1:07:51] to happen
[1:07:52] oh my brother my sister it's in that
[1:07:55] time
[1:07:55] where you prayed where you've done all
[1:07:58] that god has required for you to do
[1:08:00] it's in the time where you've laid
[1:08:02] you've turned every stone
[1:08:04] down everything that he desires if we
[1:08:06] have sin we repent and
[1:08:08] if we're done wrong we go we do right
[1:08:10] when we've done
[1:08:11] all of those things and nothing seems to
[1:08:13] work that's when you need to know that
[1:08:15] god is certain god
[1:08:19] the scripture tells us that having done
[1:08:21] all that you could do to stand
[1:08:23] stand there for
[1:08:27] it says but you know
[1:08:30] it's just strange things
[1:08:34] it says may god let this soak
[1:08:38] into every one of you
[1:08:41] if you ever hear me preach again let
[1:08:44] this be a message
[1:08:46] it's strange most strange
[1:08:49] that that sometimes that god
[1:08:52] does things that way he says you know
[1:08:56] when we have confess our sins and meet
[1:08:58] every requirement
[1:09:02] that god requires we believe on god
[1:09:05] there's actually circumstances that has
[1:09:07] been
[1:09:08] circumstances that has been met
[1:09:11] and we've confessed our sin and made all
[1:09:15] the made all the wrong
[1:09:16] made all the wrongs and have have that
[1:09:19] we
[1:09:20] have did and write and and and done
[1:09:22] everything that
[1:09:23] we ought to do it says every requirement
[1:09:25] that god has made
[1:09:26] or ask we have met that requirement yet
[1:09:29] he lays silent
[1:09:31] he says he just don't answer us i'm sure
[1:09:34] i'm speaking to people
[1:09:36] this morning who have been to that place
[1:09:40] i wonder if you've been to that place
[1:09:42] tonight
[1:09:43] i wonder if you know what the messenger
[1:09:45] is talking about
[1:09:47] it says i've seen there many times
[1:09:49] myself
[1:09:50] it says i've went back and traced my
[1:09:53] life and turn over
[1:09:54] every stone and find out to find out
[1:09:57] what i've did
[1:09:57] wrong i've got to confess and say lord
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:01] it says i'll make it right and go and do
[1:10:04] so
[1:10:05] then come back right again and say now
[1:10:07] lord thou are god
[1:10:09] i will answer he says i will you will
[1:10:11] answer me
[1:10:12] surely i meant every request that you
[1:10:15] require
[1:10:16] me to do in every requirement i've met
[1:10:18] it
[1:10:19] and still it won't move it says it seems
[1:10:22] to sit silent
[1:10:23] when you've got to be it says that's
[1:10:25] when you've got to make sure that it is
[1:10:27] god don't be discouraged the only thing
[1:10:31] is
[1:10:31] that god is in your heart to be certain
[1:10:35] in your
[1:10:36] in in god it says my text today first is
[1:10:39] before we do
[1:10:41] is to be certain of god in your heart
[1:10:44] that's god and when you've met every
[1:10:46] requirement
[1:10:47] he says you've be you've got to be
[1:10:50] certain of god
[1:10:52] and says that faith goes to work
[1:10:55] right there faith stand steady for in
[1:10:59] those
[1:10:59] years the scripture says he that cometh
[1:11:02] to god must believe that he is
[1:11:04] that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:11:06] diligently seek after him
[1:11:08] god wants to taste our faith to bring us
[1:11:11] to a place where that faith can be
[1:11:14] activated because remember if we if all
[1:11:17] the situations are just
[1:11:18] as they're supposed to be if everything
[1:11:21] is rolling out just the way we think it
[1:11:23] should be
[1:11:24] when is that faith gonna be activated so
[1:11:26] he can get to work
[1:11:28] when is our faith gonna grow so we can
[1:11:30] come to the maturity
[1:11:31] to confirm to you that god is god when
[1:11:34] is our faith gonna be
[1:11:36] tested i wanna say this we oftentimes we
[1:11:39] make a lot of claim
[1:11:40] that god is my god and god is my
[1:11:43] deliverer god is my healer
[1:11:45] god i tell you this there's not a
[1:11:47] statement we say that we're not going to
[1:11:49] be tested upon
[1:11:51] does not any confession we stand upon
[1:11:54] that we expect to just walk away and
[1:11:56] keep confessing
[1:11:58] and not planning for somebody to come
[1:12:00] and challenge you on it
[1:12:02] why because the devil is there to make
[1:12:04] sure that everything we say
[1:12:06] he challenges it to make sure that it's
[1:12:08] either god or it's not god
[1:12:12] that's where a true believer has to
[1:12:14] stand he says that that faith brings a
[1:12:17] showdown
[1:12:18] if you have met god's requirement that
[1:12:20] has been met
[1:12:21] you have fulfilled the con and
[1:12:23] considered
[1:12:24] and you have made done everything that
[1:12:26] god requires you to do
[1:12:28] then your faith rests right there your
[1:12:31] friend will stay right there
[1:12:33] and then he says then he is be certain
[1:12:37] and you know he loves to test us
[1:12:40] he loves to see the reaction of your
[1:12:42] faith did you know that
[1:12:44] god likes to see your reaction
[1:12:47] god likes to see his believers come to
[1:12:51] the place
[1:12:52] after everything has fallen apart after
[1:12:55] everything is gone being gone in the
[1:12:57] wrong direction
[1:12:58] he likes to see a people that will stand
[1:13:01] there and testify of his goodness
[1:13:04] and people that will come just like the
[1:13:06] hebrew boys
[1:13:07] i'll tell you this it's not the lack of
[1:13:09] confession
[1:13:10] they confess it's not the like of
[1:13:13] believing in what they say
[1:13:14] they believe in what they say but they
[1:13:17] their confession
[1:13:18] could not go unchallenged there was a
[1:13:21] king who heard it
[1:13:22] there was a people that heard it they
[1:13:24] called them to a task and he says
[1:13:26] if that's what you believe then we're
[1:13:28] gonna put you in the lake of fire
[1:13:30] and they said if that be the case we'll
[1:13:32] go into the fire
[1:13:33] we will not back down and yet they all
[1:13:36] they stood there and brahmana
[1:13:38] says that god watched until the very
[1:13:40] last minute
[1:13:42] and watched him oh we know how we
[1:13:46] dramatize it
[1:13:47] how different angels just wanted to come
[1:13:49] and blow the whole place away
[1:13:50] but it says no just let just watch and
[1:13:54] let's
[1:13:54] watch them oh perhaps they're within
[1:13:56] their hearts they begin to think
[1:13:58] is this really going to work is this
[1:14:00] really going to work but it was
[1:14:02] in the uncertain time a time where
[1:14:04] everything seems to have been challenged
[1:14:07] that's when something within the heart
[1:14:08] spoke up and say
[1:14:10] that even if he doesn't save us even if
[1:14:12] he doesn't deliver us from this fire
[1:14:15] we will not back down that's the kind of
[1:14:18] believer that god is looking for
[1:14:20] someone who will not back down somebody
[1:14:22] will not give up
[1:14:23] somebody will stand on god's word
[1:14:26] regardless of what the situation
[1:14:28] is oh i tell you so many times we like
[1:14:30] to protect ourselves
[1:14:32] what is it if this flesh goes away what
[1:14:34] is it if we lose this natural life
[1:14:37] there is an eternal life that paul says
[1:14:39] that if this body of flesh be dissolved
[1:14:42] there's one already waiting on the other
[1:14:44] side oh i tell you if we are done
[1:14:46] with if god is done with us on this
[1:14:49] earth we don't have any business living
[1:14:51] here anymore
[1:14:52] if as long as and if he has business
[1:14:54] with us living on earth
[1:14:56] there's nothing that can take us out of
[1:14:58] this
[1:15:00] that's where we have called being called
[1:15:02] to stand that's the kind of faith we've
[1:15:04] been called to produce
[1:15:05] to come to a place where we are so
[1:15:09] satisfied with this goodness
[1:15:12] the reason we find ourselves in so much
[1:15:15] trouble
[1:15:16] is because people are looking for
[1:15:19] satisfaction in the things of the world
[1:15:24] we feel like if i get more money i'll be
[1:15:26] satisfied
[1:15:28] if i get a better home i'll be satisfied
[1:15:31] if i get a better more land more money
[1:15:35] more cars more houses that's where my
[1:15:38] satisfaction will come from
[1:15:40] we failed to see all of the thousands
[1:15:42] that have gone before us
[1:15:45] from the world where we've seen suicide
[1:15:47] after suicide day in and day out
[1:15:50] yet they had it all we failed to see
[1:15:53] all that the world is speaking to that
[1:15:56] is
[1:15:57] nothing where people with billions of
[1:15:59] dollars they're leaving it behind
[1:16:01] and taking their own lives because why
[1:16:03] they couldn't find
[1:16:04] a lack of satisfaction in all those
[1:16:06] things what we need is to be satisfied
[1:16:09] with the lord
[1:16:10] jesus come to a place where i know
[1:16:13] god you can take away all that i have
[1:16:15] you in fact i will give off my life lord
[1:16:19] i'll only watch for one thing not that i
[1:16:22] may be satisfied with you inside of me
[1:16:25] that i can come to a place where i know
[1:16:27] what you say
[1:16:28] is what i want if you say it then i like
[1:16:31] it
[1:16:31] if you don't say it then i hate it i can
[1:16:33] come to a place where
[1:16:35] like jesus on the garden of ghettomani
[1:16:37] i'll tell you this
[1:16:38] he died there before he can die on the
[1:16:40] cross of calvary
[1:16:42] he came to a place where nothing of the
[1:16:44] world would have worked
[1:16:46] his intellect couldn't save him all his
[1:16:49] thinking couldn't save him
[1:16:50] he looked at himself he said father not
[1:16:53] my will but thy will
[1:16:54] when he died to himself at that place he
[1:16:57] already overcame the calver even before
[1:16:59] he could get there
[1:17:02] we need to place where we can overcome
[1:17:05] ourselves
[1:17:06] come to a place where is it god's will
[1:17:09] then i'm satisfied with it
[1:17:11] but madame talks about how he went to
[1:17:13] this big man's place and
[1:17:15] he talks about all roberts and and and
[1:17:17] and billy graham's
[1:17:19] thousands of computers programs and
[1:17:21] people typing out that mailing and all
[1:17:23] those things
[1:17:24] and just an entire enterprise and people
[1:17:27] working and just the kind of machinery
[1:17:30] but yet it was this little man with this
[1:17:33] one bag
[1:17:34] oh he looked at it it says oh i know god
[1:17:37] couldn't trust me with all those things
[1:17:39] that's why he didn't give it to me
[1:17:41] why in his heart he was satisfied with
[1:17:44] him
[1:17:45] and then god came and told him he says i
[1:17:47] am your portion
[1:17:49] i am your portion oh if god can be a
[1:17:52] portion tonight
[1:17:53] oh i tell you the overcoming challenge
[1:17:55] we need is to continually move moved
[1:17:58] into this presence
[1:17:59] let's move past all of this other places
[1:18:02] let's move past the holy place
[1:18:04] the outer court let's move into the holy
[1:18:06] of holies
[1:18:07] let's stay there let's not go in and out
[1:18:10] in and out
[1:18:10] let's be locked in nowhere i'm satisfied
[1:18:13] with your presence
[1:18:15] let y'all stand tonight i'm satisfied
[1:18:19] with you
[1:18:21] i don't need anything i don't need any
[1:18:25] another dollar i don't need anything i
[1:18:28] know lord
[1:18:30] that what you give me you give me
[1:18:31] because you want to give me
[1:18:34] lord your holy spirit
[1:18:38] your eternal life that you've placed
[1:18:40] within me
[1:18:41] is more than i can ask for lord that it
[1:18:44] in itself
[1:18:45] is there to sustain me in this journey
[1:18:49] that in itself is there to make sure
[1:18:51] that you provide for every single one of
[1:18:53] my
[1:18:54] needs as long as you still have me on
[1:18:56] this earth
[1:18:57] and you need me on this earth you will
[1:19:00] provide and protect
[1:19:01] you will provide and supply to all our
[1:19:04] needs that's what we have to
[1:19:06] realize but the holy spirit that you've
[1:19:08] placed within us
[1:19:09] in more than anything the world can
[1:19:11] offer that's just by
[1:19:13] it's our gracious father lord your
[1:19:16] goodness to us
[1:19:17] is more than we can say lord we come to
[1:19:20] you father tonight

[1:19:25] [Music]

[1:19:30] life
[1:19:30] natural life that we have the body
