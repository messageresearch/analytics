[37:50] amen God bless you
[37:53] s I actually uh I actually wanted to
[37:56] share a little testimony of something
[37:57] that has done for me lately you know we
[38:00] had a prayer line I believe two Sunday
[38:02] or three Sundays ago you know and uh
[38:06] deep within me I was struggling with
[38:08] giving uh social media a lot of time you
[38:11] know I felt like part of my life it was
[38:14] like I was leaving everything constantly
[38:16] in my phone and uh you know I was
[38:19] praying about it I was struggling a lot
[38:21] with that and then we came to the altar
[38:24] we prayed about it you know there was a
[38:26] a message I kept on going in my head
[38:28] where brother bham was talking about
[38:30] egyp the the Egyptians and the children
[38:33] of Israel where brother bham says the
[38:36] enemy that you once was serving one day
[38:39] will bow to you you know that he will be
[38:42] serving you you know I'm just grateful
[38:45] that uh God has helped me to take the
[38:48] tool that I once was serving you know
[38:51] now it's helping me reach out to other
[38:53] young people and bring the gospel to
[38:55] them and uh short test testimony to that
[38:58] is last night I went to bed like almost
[39:00] at 3:00 a.m. in the morning so we went
[39:02] live with uh you know my friend here
[39:05] brother Ben Ben and then we were just
[39:07] talking about the gospel reaching out to
[39:09] other people and then after that you
[39:12] know I had a call from a young man he
[39:14] was just like hey I was born and raised
[39:16] in the message but I've never taken it
[39:19] serious like just help me you know that
[39:22] made me really want to cry I was just
[39:24] like this has been my heart desire for
[39:26] the longest you know when I was ready to
[39:29] run away from the social media God took
[39:32] it as a tool to bring somebody closer to
[39:34] him so uh I hope the song I will sing

[48:29] could we'll just get right into the
[48:31] word to Genesis chapter
[48:38] 1 I know I really appreciate the word
[48:41] this
[48:42] morning I was telling Brother David in
[48:44] the back you know I F I felt in his
[48:46] shoes when he said when he listened to
[48:48] that message how he was seeing things in
[48:50] a whole almost like he'd seen it for the
[48:52] first time again that's the way I felt
[48:53] too this morning so certainly enjoyed
[48:55] that and just appreciate the word of God
[48:58] we're going to read out of Genesis
[49:01] 1: 26-
[49:09] 28 Lord willing we just maybe preach a
[49:12] message uh this morning or this evening
[49:15] I should say on uh if I give it a title
[49:18] it would be a tree of
[49:20] life a tree of
[49:23] life and God said let us make man in our
[49:26] image
[49:27] after our likeness and let them have
[49:29] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[49:31] over the fowl of the air and over the
[49:33] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[49:36] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[49:37] the Earth so God created man in his own
[49:40] image in the image of God created he him
[49:43] male and female created he them and God
[49:46] blessed them and God said unto them be
[49:48] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[49:50] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[49:54] over the fish of the sea and over the
[49:55] foul of the air and over every living
[49:57] thing that moveth upon the
[50:00] Earth and
[50:02] uh let's just also turn to Genesis
[50:05] chapter 3 just over a little bit
[50:29] and we'll go down excuse me to
[50:34] uh verse
[50:39] 14 and the Lord God said unto the
[50:42] serpent because thou Hast done this Thou
[50:44] Art cursed above all cattle and above
[50:46] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[50:49] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat
[50:51] all the days of thy life that I will put
[50:53] enmity between thee and the woman and
[50:55] between thy seed and her her seed it
[50:57] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[51:00] bruise his
[51:01] heel and let us also go to verse 22 of
[51:05] chapter
[51:09] 3 and the Lord God said behold the man
[51:12] is become as one of us to know good and
[51:14] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[51:17] and take also of the tree of life and
[51:19] eat and live forever therefore the Lord
[51:21] God sent him forth from the Garden of
[51:23] Eden to till the ground from whence he
[51:26] was taken
[51:27] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[51:30] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[51:32] and a flaming sword which turned every
[51:34] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[51:37] amen let's bow our heads in word of
[51:38] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[51:41] so grateful to you Lord Jesus and Lord
[51:44] if we were to look at ourselves as our
[51:47] pastor spoke this morning Lord it'd be
[51:49] so easy to to stumble upon each one of
[51:52] our own insufficiencies and our own
[51:54] faults and failures but Lord this
[51:56] evening we Look to You the author and
[51:57] finisher of our faith oh God we're
[51:59] looking at your Perfection Lord Jesus
[52:01] your Holiness your righteousness oh Lord
[52:04] Jesus we just ask tonight that you would
[52:06] come and speak to your bride Lord may
[52:07] you draw us closer into your bosom Lord
[52:10] to live more for you than we did the day
[52:12] before Lord Jesus to have more love for
[52:14] you Lord to increase Lord in brotherly
[52:17] kindness and faith and charity all these
[52:20] things that you've given to us Lord
[52:21] Jesus we just ask right now that you'd
[52:23] anoint the service Lord let your perfect
[52:25] will be done may we just fly up in into
[52:28] the heavens Lord on the Winds of the
[52:30] Holy Ghost Lord may we just set our
[52:32] wings Lord and let you carry us into the
[52:34] in the heaven heavenlies Lord and may
[52:36] you just speak unto us this evening
[52:38] father we just ask your blessing upon
[52:40] the reading of your word in the name of
[52:41] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may
[52:44] be
[52:45] seated if you just forgive me just uh
[52:48] you know I try just pray pray for me
[52:51] sometimes the Lord gives you an idea or
[52:53] a thought and you just pray Lord help me
[52:55] to maybe give it across the way he
[52:57] showed it to you but you know about
[52:59] supernatural things that you can't
[53:00] explain the supernatural so but you know
[53:03] what the Holy Ghost is The Interpreter
[53:05] so he'll he'll bring it to your heart
[53:07] the way the Lord would have it so I just
[53:11] really struck you know as we've been
[53:14] ministering over the last so many
[53:16] services on the work of the Lord and
[53:19] what the Lord's called us to in this
[53:22] hour
[53:23] and it's so easy to get caught up in our
[53:26] own faults and our own failures and to
[53:30] to lay in a if I could say an indirect
[53:33] way so many times we lay those things
[53:36] almost at the feet of the Lord because
[53:39] we think because things don't go the way
[53:41] we think they should that somehow the
[53:44] word of God has been made of none
[53:46] effect but if there's one thing I really
[53:49] just really spoke to me this morning
[53:51] that really kind of goes along with the
[53:53] idea the Lord put on my heart was that
[53:56] how our pastor spoke about being that
[53:58] one man
[53:59] denomination and and when I was thinking
[54:02] kind of on that when I was on the way
[54:04] home and getting ready for the service
[54:06] today and just thinking on these
[54:08] things something just really struck me
[54:11] at the how the scripture says because of
[54:15] the traditions of men you've made the
[54:18] word of God of none effect and so and
[54:22] and it just it came to my mind how even
[54:24] without thinking we so many times fall
[54:27] into that channel of
[54:30] tradition and and we become rigid when
[54:33] it comes to the ways of God yeah we we
[54:36] don't how brother brandom how he
[54:37] described if you remember that
[54:39] overgrowth and and that old dead burnt
[54:41] out forest and how they were all rigid
[54:43] and the wind would blow through they
[54:45] said it was a spooky oo why because the
[54:48] trees had been dead they had no life in
[54:51] them and so they couldn't do anything
[54:53] but just oh the days of Miracles has
[54:55] passed oh the word of God just doesn't
[54:58] seem to work the way that it used to oh
[55:00] I just don't see the the life of God
[55:02] being made manifest the way it ought to
[55:04] be but then when he could see the the
[55:07] little saplings that were growing up and
[55:09] how when the wind would blow over those
[55:11] little saplings he said the little
[55:12] leaves would flutter and their little
[55:14] branches would flop around and what was
[55:16] it they they were they were living they
[55:18] were flexible they could take the the
[55:21] spirit of God the anointing that God
[55:23] would bring to a person because remember
[55:26] a tree represents a
[55:28] person and how that that young flexible
[55:32] tree that had life in it could could
[55:35] flex and bend and move with the will of
[55:37] the spirit and just go wherever the
[55:39] spirit would lead but so many times we
[55:42] find maybe without even thinking about
[55:44] it we come to these traditions in our
[55:46] own minds because we just think well
[55:48] that's just the way it's got to be well
[55:50] maybe we've taken this tradition that
[55:52] well my family always did it this way
[55:55] well my dad always did it this way well
[55:57] this person always did it this way and
[55:59] this person always did it this way but
[56:01] unless that unless that comes back to
[56:02] the word it doesn't profit you anything
[56:05] and then in the end we might find
[56:06] ourselves coming to a place where we're
[56:08] so locked in we become a onep person
[56:11] denomination because we've gotten so
[56:12] many Traditions we've boxed ourselves
[56:15] into that we just can't break out of it
[56:19] but I I just I guess it just really
[56:21] struck me with that because I was
[56:23] thinking about this this kind of text a
[56:25] tree of life and how the lord gave a
[56:29] commandment see God's God's word is yeah
[56:33] and amen it's unchanging when God has
[56:36] says one thing one way it will always be
[56:39] that way he doesn't Veer to the left or
[56:41] to the right he's not a man that can
[56:44] make a decision one second and then say
[56:46] Oh I did it wrong I got to redo it no
[56:48] when he made a decision the first time
[56:50] that was the right decision and when he
[56:53] told Adam and Eve in the garden that at
[56:55] that point still their name being Adam
[56:57] being one and he said be fruitful and
[57:00] multiply replenish the Earth subdue the
[57:03] Earth have dominion over the Earth
[57:06] that's the command that went out of
[57:08] God's mouth and I'm telling you that
[57:10] there's going to be a people that are
[57:12] going to fulfill that word and I believe
[57:16] I'm looking at part of that people right
[57:18] now there is a people that are going to
[57:22] be fruitful there is a people that are
[57:25] going to multiply that are going to
[57:27] bring forth after their kind see God set
[57:31] forth the law in the Book of Genesis
[57:34] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[57:38] and no matter what the devil's tried to
[57:39] do in this age and throughout all the
[57:42] ages God's seed cannot be
[57:45] diluted God's seed cannot be hybrid it
[57:49] can't be hybrid with any you cannot mix
[57:52] the true word of God with anything
[57:55] that's right
[57:56] if it if it mixes with something else it
[57:59] never was the true word of God to begin
[58:01] with and even throughout all the church
[58:03] ages and we see those Riders going forth
[58:06] and how from the very beginning that
[58:07] nielan Spirit came and tried to twist
[58:10] the word well as soon as that word's
[58:11] been changed one iota it's no longer the
[58:14] word no matter how they could dress it
[58:17] up in their forms and their Fashions and
[58:19] that like our Pastor said it's nothing
[58:22] no matter what name they claim it's
[58:24] nothing but a Catholic spirit
[58:26] because it always goes back to
[58:28] Rome and I believe brother bradam tied
[58:31] that all the way back to Nimrod all the
[58:33] way back there it all goes back to
[58:36] Genesis that Gene
[58:38] chapter so God's seed can't be
[58:42] diluted and when he says he's going to
[58:44] bring forth of its kind it's going to
[58:47] bring forth of its kind so if that tree
[58:51] of life we're talking about a tree of
[58:54] life if the Tree of Life life was going
[58:57] to bring forth more see what's a tree a
[59:00] tree being a person remember brother
[59:03] brandom said these trees they were a
[59:05] type of people that's probably that
[59:06] mystery of the original sin being hidden
[59:09] in the Book of
[59:10] Genesis you're a tree you are a fruit
[59:14] tree and God having put it in even in
[59:17] the nature how we could see that every
[59:20] animal stays within that kind and they
[59:23] bring forth that's why the the world's
[59:25] version Evolution couldn't have happened
[59:27] anyway cuz God didn't say let every let
[59:31] every creature bring forth something
[59:33] mutated that'll bring forth something
[59:35] else mutated and bring forth something
[59:37] else mutated no he said brother brandham
[59:39] said God may have created it in an
[59:41] evolution he started with the lowest
[59:44] frog and then he went up to maybe a cat
[59:47] to a dog and and so far and then we get
[59:49] up to the and then he comes to the
[59:50] Pinnacle of a
[59:52] man and and and see how the devil would
[59:54] just take an idea of God and pervert it
[59:58] and make this this idea of well well we
[1:00:00] just started from a sludge and then we
[1:00:03] came up to an amoeba and then we just
[1:00:06] kind of all of a sudden that amoeba
[1:00:07] sprouted some legs and started hopping
[1:00:09] and then that thing just started doing
[1:00:11] this and doing that and here we are just
[1:00:13] a mistake a cosmic accident see and
[1:00:17] that's an anointing of the devil and
[1:00:19] there's no wonder why children in the
[1:00:22] schools today can't find meaning in
[1:00:24] their life when they're taught from the
[1:00:26] very beginning that you're nothing but a
[1:00:28] random sample of Adams smashed together
[1:00:32] over billions of years and there's
[1:00:34] really no reason for you to be here
[1:00:36] other than nature just said well blop
[1:00:39] here you are but God had a purpose for
[1:00:42] your life God has a reason for you to be
[1:00:45] here he's got a a mission just for you I
[1:00:50] don't care what how insignificant the
[1:00:53] devil tries to make you feel it does
[1:00:56] doesn't matter I tell you what when I if
[1:00:58] I had a you know I work in in the
[1:01:00] aircraft industry I'm an aircraft
[1:01:01] controller so I but I don't necessarily
[1:01:03] work directly with the airplanes
[1:01:05] mechanically but anybody that
[1:01:08] would one little screw out of place on
[1:01:11] that airplane and you better believe me
[1:01:13] they're going to be out it to fix
[1:01:15] it because every piece is
[1:01:18] critical every little part is important
[1:01:21] it doesn't matter how small the spring
[1:01:23] is in the watch you take that spring out
[1:01:26] it won't keep time right so is it with
[1:01:29] you as a part of the body of Christ you
[1:01:32] have a part to play that is so vitally
[1:01:36] important that even that without you we
[1:01:38] can't make it that's right there's no
[1:01:41] wonder why we got to keep seeking out
[1:01:43] that last seed because we can't make it
[1:01:46] without him and if we just sat back and
[1:01:50] rested in our predestination and just
[1:01:52] Bast in the bride Glory of I'm just so
[1:01:55] pred destinated meanwhile Souls
[1:01:58] languishing out in the world another
[1:02:00] seed as you once were out there
[1:02:04] somewhere without hope not understanding
[1:02:08] why they feel that there's something
[1:02:10] more for them that God is more than just
[1:02:12] an imagination or or just a little poof
[1:02:15] of smoke or a grandfatherly figure but
[1:02:18] he's a real living
[1:02:20] force that can change your
[1:02:23] life and without you
[1:02:26] to go out and seek why because you're
[1:02:30] his hands you're his feet you are his
[1:02:33] mouth peace you are and you are the
[1:02:36] light shining in the darkness in this
[1:02:41] day that God works through man and when
[1:02:45] I say man I I mean brothers and sisters
[1:02:47] man in
[1:02:50] general you got to be careful nowadays
[1:02:52] with the if you say man or woman and if
[1:02:54] you're not inclusive of everybody but we
[1:02:57] understand so God has called us to
[1:03:00] fulfill the scripture be fruitful and
[1:03:04] multiply replenish the Earth you're
[1:03:07] going to when now we're talking
[1:03:10] spiritually he want you to be fruitful
[1:03:13] he said I would above all things that
[1:03:14] you prosper and be in
[1:03:16] health God has a desire for you to have
[1:03:19] a life so prosperous not just in the
[1:03:22] natural but in the spirit that that your
[1:03:26] cup could
[1:03:27] overflow that that your life could
[1:03:30] overflow and spill over to your neighbor
[1:03:34] that doesn't know God that your life can
[1:03:36] overflow and spill over to your coworker
[1:03:40] that's searching for something but he's
[1:03:43] got to have someone to work through and
[1:03:45] that just happens to be
[1:03:48] you God's word can't be
[1:03:51] diluted it it can't be but see so many
[1:03:55] times the devil tries to turn our eyes
[1:03:58] put it put it in the mirror and look at
[1:04:00] all your faults and
[1:04:01] failures as if your failures are somehow
[1:04:06] going to stop the working in the program
[1:04:07] of God
[1:04:09] on it can't happen because God's word is
[1:04:14] immutable did not the prophet say
[1:04:16] unbelief does it hinder God no no sir it
[1:04:19] does not hinder God God's will will be
[1:04:22] done that's why Jesus said I'll teach
[1:04:25] you how to pray thy kingdom come thy
[1:04:27] will be done on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:04:31] and we know God's will is done perfectly
[1:04:33] in heaven and so will his will be done
[1:04:36] here on
[1:04:37] Earth but he wants to express that
[1:04:40] through a vessel he wants a vessel to
[1:04:44] express that through and it doesn't
[1:04:46] matter what your faults look like it
[1:04:48] doesn't matter what you think of
[1:04:50] yourself see we've got to stop thinking
[1:04:53] with our own brain and start thinking
[1:04:56] with the mind of Christ who saw you
[1:04:59] before the foundation of the world a
[1:05:01] perfect son or daughter of God in his
[1:05:04] presence standing before him faultless
[1:05:07] filled with the spirit of God covered by
[1:05:09] the glory of God in the Perfection of
[1:05:12] his
[1:05:14] son and you've got to start seeing
[1:05:16] yourself that
[1:05:18] way because otherwise you will always
[1:05:22] stop short of fulfilling the word of God
[1:05:26] because you'll always find an excuse to
[1:05:28] get out of
[1:05:29] it just like
[1:05:31] Moses God speaking with them face to
[1:05:34] face I sending you Moses what did he do
[1:05:37] he immediately turned his eyes from the
[1:05:39] burning bush not maybe not literally but
[1:05:42] inwardly he turned his eyes away from
[1:05:45] the very God Of Heaven in the burning
[1:05:48] bush speaking to him and looked at a
[1:05:50] mirror and all the devil magnified all
[1:05:53] of its faults well I can't speak so good
[1:05:58] well neither could brother brandom
[1:06:00] apparently I well I I'm a man slow at
[1:06:02] speech I can't do this I can't do that
[1:06:05] I've got these failures I've got this
[1:06:07] failure and and the Lord said it doesn't
[1:06:09] matter
[1:06:10] Moses it's not about you
[1:06:12] anyway but it's about the word of God
[1:06:15] being
[1:06:17] fulfilled you know the Lord really gave
[1:06:19] me I feel like a a revelation of
[1:06:21] something that that not not that I
[1:06:23] struggled with it in any way but I I
[1:06:26] don't know how many of you have ever
[1:06:27] heard the story of you know Abraham and
[1:06:31] ailec and you think about how Abraham
[1:06:34] says to Sarah just pretend you're my
[1:06:35] sister they're going to kill me you're
[1:06:37] beautiful I don't want to die really
[1:06:40] being a coward in that sense I mean
[1:06:42] let's just be let's just be honest about
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:44] situation being kind of a coward and
[1:06:46] wanting to run away said just pretend
[1:06:48] you're my sister all these things so she
[1:06:50] says fine I'll do it I'll save your life
[1:06:53] so he takes them and then he has the
[1:06:54] dream he says you're as good as a dead
[1:06:56] man I'm going to shut up all the wombs
[1:06:58] in your country if you don't restore him
[1:07:01] his wife and have him pray for you your
[1:07:04] country's gone your seed line's dead and
[1:07:07] I always kind of puzzled me because so
[1:07:10] many times I so see this is some of our
[1:07:12] problems so many times we put too much
[1:07:14] on a prophet and I and I'm not and I say
[1:07:17] that in this way because I used to
[1:07:19] public people say well it's because he's
[1:07:20] a prophet no it wasn't because Abraham
[1:07:22] was a prophet it was because and I heard
[1:07:25] it in the in that the message I'm
[1:07:26] probably going to read a few quotes from
[1:07:27] it restoration of the brid tree brother
[1:07:30] brandham said I don't have this quote in
[1:07:32] particular but brother brandham said
[1:07:33] that he said God had made the promise to
[1:07:38] Abraham that by Sarah the seed would
[1:07:43] come so he could not allow that vessel
[1:07:47] to be
[1:07:49] defiled because the word of God had to
[1:07:52] be fulfilled in that vessel
[1:07:55] so it wasn't anything even necessarily
[1:07:58] with Abraham himself but what did he say
[1:08:01] he said because I have sworn by
[1:08:04] myself to protect his own
[1:08:08] words God said you better restore
[1:08:11] her and Abraham just happened to be in
[1:08:14] the spot of the Prophet where he had
[1:08:16] could you imagine Abraham even that
[1:08:19] feeling when abic righteously could say
[1:08:21] you lied to me he says yeah I know and
[1:08:25] then had to Humble himself and say now
[1:08:27] could you pray for me and a could you
[1:08:30] imagine Abraham now there were I'm sure
[1:08:32] there were battles in his mind said oh
[1:08:34] Lord I know you gave me the promise but
[1:08:36] how could I being this cowardly deed
[1:08:39] that I did and yet what was it God
[1:08:41] honored his
[1:08:43] word god honored his word so it it's the
[1:08:48] it's the word that matters that what you
[1:08:51] think about yourself doesn't mean
[1:08:53] anything when he gave you a
[1:08:56] promise he's got to fulfill that word he
[1:09:00] will move Heaven and Earth before he
[1:09:03] he'll let a he'll let a word of his fall
[1:09:05] to the
[1:09:06] ground Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:09:09] but his word would never pass
[1:09:13] away it's his word that he's holding to
[1:09:17] why he can't he can't do anything but
[1:09:19] that because he is his word and if he
[1:09:22] can't fail his word can't fail anything
[1:09:25] that tries to get in the way that
[1:09:27] includes
[1:09:28] you he will make sure that it works
[1:09:32] around so that it's word is fulfilled in
[1:09:38] you that's the grace of God that's
[1:09:44] predestination that's the love of God
[1:09:46] for you he wants you to be fruitful and
[1:09:49] multiply he wants you to go out into the
[1:09:53] highways into the B ways into the hedges
[1:09:57] he want and that could be that's at your
[1:10:00] workplace that's at when you go to the
[1:10:03] store that's even when that's when you
[1:10:05] come to
[1:10:06] church that that's when you go out for a
[1:10:09] walk with your dog or your family it
[1:10:12] it's wherever you are God is wanting to
[1:10:15] fulfill his word through
[1:10:17] you and it doesn't always have to be see
[1:10:20] we make it this this this great thing in
[1:10:22] the eyes of man oh you know Peter
[1:10:24] walking down the thing that say rise up
[1:10:26] and walk and just Miracles flying
[1:10:28] everywhere and shadows passing over
[1:10:31] people and people rolling off the graves
[1:10:33] and everything that's not what it is
[1:10:36] many times the work of God goes so
[1:10:39] unnoticed it goes so unnoticed you
[1:10:43] wouldn't even see it
[1:10:44] happening that's why he gave us these
[1:10:46] types that's why to let us know that
[1:10:50] even when we can't see it the law of God
[1:10:54] still stands the word of God still
[1:10:57] stands it doesn't matter what you see on
[1:10:59] the outside brothers and sisters it
[1:11:01] doesn't matter if the word has been
[1:11:04] spoken if you can pull together and
[1:11:07] believe it wherever two or three are
[1:11:10] gathered in my name I'll be there in the
[1:11:12] midst if any two of you if any if any of
[1:11:15] you agree as concerning one thing and
[1:11:18] you ask it in my name I will perform it
[1:11:22] if you can hold on to that that's a law
[1:11:26] amen that's a law God promised
[1:11:30] it I'm going to read this here from
[1:11:32] restoration of the brid tree he says now
[1:11:35] we have a law the law of life in us we
[1:11:39] don't only thing you have to do you're
[1:11:42] made and born and placed here in the
[1:11:44] body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:46] God you don't have to knck down to the
[1:11:49] devil we've got a law That's the Law of
[1:11:52] the Holy Spirit the only thing thing you
[1:11:55] know have to do is know how to let go
[1:11:58] and let God you keep fighting at it see
[1:12:02] and it won't never work when you let go
[1:12:04] and let God that's all if the fish said
[1:12:07] wait I'll catch my breath real good I'll
[1:12:10] breathe up a little oxygen in me and
[1:12:12] I'll see if I can go down no he does
[1:12:14] that he'll burst open
[1:12:16] see see that's what many times we try to
[1:12:19] do or if only I could just pray
[1:12:22] enough to to to witness to that person
[1:12:26] if only I could just listen to enough
[1:12:28] messages to get enough anointing on me
[1:12:31] where I could feel good about
[1:12:33] myself it's not about what you feel
[1:12:36] about yourself it's about what God said
[1:12:39] about you and then into what he said
[1:12:42] about his
[1:12:46] word see because if if you look for it
[1:12:50] you're going to get what you
[1:12:51] expect if you're constantly looking for
[1:12:54] reason
[1:12:55] to to sit down in the ditch and and be
[1:12:59] because that's the that's the age we
[1:13:00] live in it's so it's an age of
[1:13:02] negativity if we ever seen it before I
[1:13:05] heard that brother give the testimony
[1:13:06] about getting off the social media I
[1:13:09] mean it's just it's basically pure evil
[1:13:12] because they they Revel in the flaws of
[1:13:15] others it's what they it's what what
[1:13:17] happens that like Brother David said
[1:13:19] this morning they've got their Idols
[1:13:21] they and they just flat out they used to
[1:13:22] call them Stars fallen stars is more
[1:13:25] like it but now they just flat out call
[1:13:27] them Idols the American Idol that little
[1:13:30] singing show that they do oh I'm a I'm a
[1:13:32] football Idol I'm a basketball they just
[1:13:35] call them what they are now they don't
[1:13:37] even try to hide it but man they love it
[1:13:40] when when when one of these people they
[1:13:42] what do they do they build them up just
[1:13:43] to tear them down why because that's
[1:13:46] just how the devil works it doesn't
[1:13:48] matter well how much you gain in this
[1:13:50] world it doesn't matter how much fame or
[1:13:53] popularity you can get in high school
[1:13:55] cool because as soon as you do something
[1:13:57] silly all your so-called friends are
[1:13:59] going to be laughing at you just as much
[1:14:00] as everybody
[1:14:02] else if they're really your friends see
[1:14:04] what happens when you witness to them
[1:14:06] the Gospel of Jesus
[1:14:08] Christ and see e see if they'll stick
[1:14:10] with you then make a stand for God
[1:14:13] against all the garbage in the world and
[1:14:15] see if a real friend will stick with you
[1:14:17] then but I know a friend who sticketh
[1:14:19] closer than a
[1:14:20] brother Jesus Christ will stand with you
[1:14:23] no matter what
[1:14:25] yes amen sometimes you know you probably
[1:14:28] heard it all you ones that are in high
[1:14:29] school you know they talk about peer
[1:14:31] pressure you know there's such a thing
[1:14:32] as positive peer pressure too that's
[1:14:35] right hey brother you com to church hey
[1:14:37] you going to come to that Bible study
[1:14:39] maybe I'll put a little positive peer
[1:14:40] pressure on each other sometimes and
[1:14:42] that goes for all of us young and old it
[1:14:44] doesn't matter you know because there's
[1:14:46] some things it seems like even adults
[1:14:47] never grow out
[1:14:48] of you
[1:14:50] know I speak as a as as one of them I
[1:14:53] I'm pointing right here
[1:14:57] so we'll just keep reading here says the
[1:15:00] bird says I'll see how fast I can run
[1:15:02] down here and maybe I'll take off no he
[1:15:05] won't do it he'll fall down see he's got
[1:15:07] to know how to control no how that law
[1:15:11] can control him and the same way it is
[1:15:14] with us it isn't if we fight and Pull
[1:15:17] and hurry and oh if I don't get this if
[1:15:20] I don't get that that's not it it's to
[1:15:23] know that the law of life
[1:15:25] is in you
[1:15:27] am and you just let go and let God then
[1:15:31] he takes you to your healing takes you
[1:15:33] to the baptism of the spirit or anything
[1:15:36] that he's promised any claim that he's
[1:15:38] given is yours and by letting go and
[1:15:42] letting God now if you if the officer
[1:15:44] was going to going to take the fellow
[1:15:47] that stole your property was going to
[1:15:49] take him to court and you keep pulling
[1:15:52] him back well I don't know just whether
[1:15:54] he should do this or
[1:15:56] not he will never get him
[1:15:58] there just let him
[1:16:01] go that's the way you do let Satan just
[1:16:04] get away all the doubts and everything
[1:16:06] flee from your mind then God will raise
[1:16:08] you up
[1:16:11] good that's what we got to do is get out
[1:16:13] of our own way just let let go and let
[1:16:16] God I really like that in the the what
[1:16:20] we were Brother David was ministering
[1:16:22] and listening to and what we read about
[1:16:23] how so many times it's just and I'm
[1:16:26] paraphrasing how he just sometimes it's
[1:16:28] we just don't do the things that God
[1:16:29] tells us to do because it seems so hard
[1:16:31] we don't I think he's the way he said it
[1:16:33] was we don't give God the service that
[1:16:35] he's do he's done all these things for
[1:16:38] us and then he says go go pray for this
[1:16:40] brother and it seems so hard to do it
[1:16:43] come on he says oh maybe go uplift this
[1:16:45] person or go do this little thing or go
[1:16:47] do that little thing and then it seems
[1:16:49] like it's such a
[1:16:50] burden but that's about letting go and
[1:16:54] letting God am if you could submit when
[1:16:56] the Lord puts that on your heart when he
[1:16:59] gives you something to do being faithful
[1:17:02] in little then being faithful in much he
[1:17:05] says oh go pray for this person oh go
[1:17:07] talk to I'm using just natural things
[1:17:09] but these are the everyday things that
[1:17:11] we let
[1:17:13] slip and and if we could get to the
[1:17:16] point where in in our everyday little
[1:17:18] things we could just let go oh the
[1:17:22] remember I I know I've T spoke this
[1:17:24] before but oh the the the Lord puts it
[1:17:27] on your heart go maybe call that brother
[1:17:28] or sister and pray for him just puts it
[1:17:30] on your heart you have no idea what's
[1:17:32] going on but I like I said it ain't the
[1:17:35] devil anointing you to pray in the name
[1:17:39] of Jesus Christ for a brother or
[1:17:41] sister but we will reason our way into a
[1:17:45] figurate not how to get out of it oh
[1:17:49] well I just I had a bad day today I kind
[1:17:50] of had a bad attitude I I don't think
[1:17:52] you know that anointing wouldn't be
[1:17:54] there the way it should and you know
[1:17:56] they're you know they're going to hear
[1:17:57] it in my voice I'm having a bad day and
[1:17:59] you know to be honest I their life's
[1:18:01] probably really good anyway I don't need
[1:18:02] to talk to them oh they don't even want
[1:18:04] to talk to me anyway they're always so
[1:18:06] busy see how the devil likes to lie to
[1:18:09] you and all the while the Lord just say
[1:18:11] just let go let God just let me work
[1:18:15] through you right there the Lord is
[1:18:17] trying to say just this is my work I
[1:18:19] want for you to do right now little or
[1:18:22] big it doesn't
[1:18:23] matter and we're getting somewhere with
[1:18:25] that
[1:18:26] because when we see what God has called
[1:18:29] for each one of us in our in our just
[1:18:30] even our daily lives it's so much
[1:18:33] greater than you can imagin amen it's so
[1:18:36] much greater you you have been called to
[1:18:40] be a tree of
[1:18:43] life that's right you have been called
[1:18:46] to be a tree of you're not the tree of
[1:18:48] life but you've been called to be a tree
[1:18:51] of life why because God seed cannot be
[1:18:56] diluted when his seed was placed in you
[1:19:00] it's going to produce the exact same as
[1:19:03] the original because God doesn't do
[1:19:06] hybrids he doesn't do half and half have
[1:19:09] you ever thought about the fact that
[1:19:11] we've never seen a purebred human
[1:19:16] being did you know that we've never seen
[1:19:18] a purebred human being because according
[1:19:21] to the flesh it all got mixed up
[1:19:25] as soon as the guard of Eden and then
[1:19:27] after the flood when everything got
[1:19:29] messed up messed up after that that's
[1:19:32] why we don't we that's why know we no
[1:19:34] man after the
[1:19:36] flesh oh they want to run Bloodlines and
[1:19:38] do this and do that you know Israel can
[1:19:40] do that because that's for them they can
[1:19:42] know who's who because God's called
[1:19:44] that's even in the scripture that they
[1:19:45] would know who's who but we know no man
[1:19:49] after the Flesh and yet the devil always
[1:19:51] points that's the only thing he can
[1:19:52] point to because
[1:19:55] when when you have come into the Holy
[1:19:57] Ghost into the word and been
[1:20:00] separated severed by the word of God
[1:20:03] from the desires and the love of the
[1:20:05] flesh it has no hold on you you start to
[1:20:08] come to a revelation that's not even you
[1:20:10] to begin with that's not who you
[1:20:13] are but that's the only hold the devil
[1:20:15] has the scripture says that God
[1:20:18] condemned sin in the flesh if I can say
[1:20:21] it another way he trapped it in the
[1:20:24] flesh
[1:20:25] he sealed It Away In the Flesh and it's
[1:20:29] constantly trying to get out that's why
[1:20:31] you got to Die daily every day you got
[1:20:34] to seal him back up and say get behind
[1:20:37] me Satan kill that flesh put him back in
[1:20:39] the
[1:20:41] ground it's kind of interesting we know
[1:20:44] the numerologies and everything and how
[1:20:45] six is the number of man there's a
[1:20:47] reason why they bury him six feet under
[1:20:49] that's where man belongs that's where
[1:20:51] the flesh belongs put him under your
[1:20:53] feet s feed under every
[1:20:57] day but he's called you to be a tree of
[1:21:02] lifeall you are a tree of life whether
[1:21:05] you think so or not brothers and sisters
[1:21:08] you may not even see it yet it on you
[1:21:10] may not see it yet but you are why
[1:21:12] because you can't be anything other than
[1:21:15] what the original
[1:21:17] is you can't because God doesn't produce
[1:21:21] anything other than himself
[1:21:26] every seed will bring forth after his
[1:21:28] kind so if the first was deity was
[1:21:32] Perfection was a tree of life then his
[1:21:36] offspring will be Perfection will be
[1:21:39] deity a tree of life now oh brother
[1:21:41] that's going too far no I'mma chip off
[1:21:44] the old
[1:21:45] block I'm a part of my daddy I came from
[1:21:49] my daddy I'm going back to my
[1:21:52] father I I can't help it it's who I am
[1:21:56] it's who you
[1:21:57] are yeah many people would go too far oh
[1:22:00] I'm God I'm this and I'm that no sir you
[1:22:03] are that because he put it in
[1:22:05] you and everything that's why he said I
[1:22:08] am the vine you are the branches without
[1:22:11] me you can do
[1:22:14] nothing hallu if the if the if the brand
[1:22:18] if the if it abideth alone it doesn't
[1:22:19] bear anything but if it abides in the
[1:22:21] vine it'll bear forth much fruit
[1:22:25] so you are a tree of life yeah you may
[1:22:28] you may not haven't come into your
[1:22:29] season yet that's okay you're going to
[1:22:30] bloom soon enough you know every tree
[1:22:34] has its season you know every tree has a
[1:22:37] different number of fruits that it Bears
[1:22:40] it has a different type of fruit that it
[1:22:42] Bears it has a different part of the
[1:22:44] year that it Bears its fruit it has a
[1:22:46] different a different part of the world
[1:22:48] that it Bears its fruit in the different
[1:22:50] temperatures it's got to be
[1:22:52] under apples don't always necessarily
[1:22:54] bear fruits you know they say it takes a
[1:22:56] pineapple like a year or something or
[1:22:59] more to just to Bear one
[1:23:02] pineapple I I remember I talked to a to
[1:23:04] a guy at work and he was talking about
[1:23:06] planting asparagus it takes I think
[1:23:08] three years before you can even get one
[1:23:11] asparagus stalk off that thing before
[1:23:14] it's able to be eaten but brother once
[1:23:16] it thing's eaten you can cut that thing
[1:23:18] off almost every day and it just keeps
[1:23:19] growing and growing and growing and you
[1:23:21] got food for days so don't get
[1:23:24] discouraged enaged when when when it
[1:23:26] looks like oh Lord I'm just maybe not
[1:23:28] bearing the way out to I don't see as
[1:23:30] much as I should you just stay in the
[1:23:32] presence of the sun you just keep eating
[1:23:34] the word your season's coming
[1:23:38] hu your season's on its
[1:23:42] way God has a fruit that he wants to see
[1:23:45] out of your life that only you can
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:52] bear he's got a purpose for you you he's
[1:23:55] got a reason that you're here right now
[1:23:58] we're just shoveling we're just we're
[1:23:59] just watering it with the washing of the
[1:24:01] Water by the word we're just shoveling
[1:24:03] you know those trials that's just you
[1:24:05] know sometimes that's what did he say
[1:24:06] when the tree if a tree said what would
[1:24:08] you do what would the master do with the
[1:24:10] tree that didn't bear any fruit he said
[1:24:12] they try to they dig around it they dig
[1:24:14] a ditch around it and dung it they'd
[1:24:15] fertilize it you know sometimes you're
[1:24:18] stinky horrible smelling trials that's
[1:24:20] nothing but God digging a ditch around
[1:24:22] you putting some fertilizer on there
[1:24:25] Hallelujah sometimes those things you're
[1:24:27] going through the Lord says I desire
[1:24:29] that it bear much
[1:24:31] fruit sometimes he's got to get the
[1:24:32] pruning shears out and start slicing a
[1:24:35] couple branches off CU a few things
[1:24:39] maybe some poison ivy trying to glom on
[1:24:41] you come on now trying to leech itself
[1:24:44] off you're trying to leech the life off
[1:24:47] but the Holy Ghost will come with a
[1:24:49] two-edged sword and start slicing and
[1:24:52] hacking and as long as the life it's
[1:24:55] still in the roots it'll just start
[1:24:57] sprouting forth more fresh shoots that
[1:25:00] are flexible again that are free from
[1:25:02] those
[1:25:05] parasites don't you worry about it it's
[1:25:07] coming to pass the life was in the
[1:25:10] seed it doesn't matter what it looks
[1:25:14] like that's why you're so important
[1:25:17] because your life is a light and that
[1:25:21] seed needs light to J
[1:25:26] terminate when you're going about your
[1:25:28] day at
[1:25:29] work and you're just kind of forgive me
[1:25:32] for saying down in the dumps or you just
[1:25:34] kind of feel like I just I'm such a
[1:25:37] failure I can't how can I witness to
[1:25:40] anybody you got to let your light
[1:25:43] shine you're in a dark place we're in a
[1:25:45] dark
[1:25:46] hour and that light has even more of an
[1:25:49] effect you know the effect of light is
[1:25:51] magnified the darker it is
[1:25:54] what little light you think you got
[1:25:56] might as well be a giant Spotlight in
[1:25:59] this world that's right for the darkness
[1:26:02] that is
[1:26:04] here and how do you
[1:26:06] know that that light just even your life
[1:26:09] is a
[1:26:11] light you it doesn't even if you didn't
[1:26:13] say anything just your life has an
[1:26:16] atmosphere behind it has a power behind
[1:26:20] it has something behind it that someone
[1:26:23] would be uncover aable about and
[1:26:24] wouldn't even be able to
[1:26:26] explain why because it's a presence of
[1:26:29] God it's not about you it's about what
[1:26:32] you're packing it's about what you're
[1:26:34] carrying you know if you took if you
[1:26:37] took a big ball a uranium 235 what they
[1:26:39] use in the nuclear weapons stuff that
[1:26:41] baby in a suitcase you may not be able
[1:26:43] to see it but put a Geer counter up to
[1:26:45] it and that thing's going to
[1:26:47] go that's what it's like for you when
[1:26:50] you get around the devil sometimes when
[1:26:52] those when those people that you're
[1:26:53] working with they don't know know
[1:26:54] something's making them twitch and
[1:26:56] something's making them mad at you
[1:26:58] something's making them be nice to you
[1:26:59] even you don't even know but something
[1:27:01] produces something they can't see it
[1:27:04] they don't know why they doing
[1:27:06] it but there's something in you it
[1:27:09] produces a
[1:27:12] reaction and you just let that light
[1:27:15] shine you may not even see it because
[1:27:18] but all it takes it doesn't matter how
[1:27:21] deep in the muck and me it is
[1:27:25] I we'll read a quote about it here in a
[1:27:27] minute
[1:27:28] but how that seed could be buried under
[1:27:31] 30 feet of
[1:27:32] mud it could have Frozen brother Bram
[1:27:36] talks about how it could freeze and the
[1:27:37] pulp burst out and everything all it
[1:27:40] takes is that sun to shine on it one
[1:27:44] time and that baby will
[1:27:48] germinate it it'll germinate it can't
[1:27:50] that's life it can't stop
[1:27:53] it so how do you
[1:27:55] know that your light shining that one
[1:27:58] time wouldn't catch that seed that's way
[1:28:01] down deep in that person you never
[1:28:02] thought about oh no you know oh brother
[1:28:05] I didn't see nothing I've witnessed to
[1:28:07] so many people I've I've done this I've
[1:28:09] done that you don't even know what's
[1:28:11] going on behind the scenes because we
[1:28:13] are living by what we can see and well I
[1:28:16] didn't see him come to church and I
[1:28:17] didn't see him do you don't know what's
[1:28:18] going on in the
[1:28:20] inside remember our brother bandam
[1:28:21] talked about Reverend Lily
[1:28:24] that seed buried underneath down
[1:28:27] underneath the pond and then below the
[1:28:29] pond beneath the mud but all it took see
[1:28:32] nothing can stop that light those little
[1:28:35] light photons or whatever go shooting
[1:28:37] through the
[1:28:39] ground poof there's the life can't stop
[1:28:42] it you don't even see it but it's
[1:28:46] working you you can't you can't see
[1:28:48] nothing yet there oh there ain't no
[1:28:50] fruit there there ain't no life there
[1:28:51] you can't see it's working behind the
[1:28:52] scenes you don't don't worry about it
[1:28:55] it's going to do what the life was made
[1:28:57] to do because there's a law in that seed
[1:29:02] that it must bring forth and so that
[1:29:05] thing just starts to grow in it starts
[1:29:07] to push in it starts to grow in and
[1:29:09] pushing up pretty soon oh you still
[1:29:11] can't see anything oh it's out of the
[1:29:12] mud but now it's below 30 feet of water
[1:29:16] it just keeps on going just keeps on
[1:29:18] going keeps drawing in what it can and
[1:29:20] then pretty soon you see the flower on
[1:29:22] the surface and then it amazes us
[1:29:26] someone come to church that you never
[1:29:28] thought about that you witnessed to 5
[1:29:30] years ago you didn't know that it struck
[1:29:33] the seed then and it's just been
[1:29:38] percolating it's been growing it's been
[1:29:40] churning little by little you didn't
[1:29:43] know what was going on behind the
[1:29:46] scenes it's but it's so simple but you
[1:29:49] got to let your light shine you've got
[1:29:51] to be out there it's like it's like how
[1:29:54] do we talk about that magnet brother
[1:29:55] brandom spoke of that's going through
[1:29:57] how it power up and it would start
[1:29:59] carrying all the junk and different
[1:30:01] things and carrying it off he's like oh
[1:30:02] my it's like that gospel magnet that's
[1:30:04] coming you know you're a gospel magnet
[1:30:07] too when you're walking through life you
[1:30:10] know yeah you you ever had you ever
[1:30:13] maybe witnessed to certain people and
[1:30:15] you could feel the pull you could see
[1:30:18] that there's something there you could
[1:30:20] almost see the Revelation
[1:30:22] catch but but then it's almost like
[1:30:24] something holding what's it they're
[1:30:25] bolted down still why because that
[1:30:28] magnetism is trying to pull them but
[1:30:31] they're pulled back by denomination
[1:30:33] maybe they're bolted down by a family or
[1:30:35] something something they just can't let
[1:30:36] go of yet you don't worry about it you
[1:30:38] don't worry about it because the light
[1:30:40] struck the
[1:30:41] seed and if it comes if that seed was on
[1:30:44] good ground it'll come
[1:30:47] forth and then there's some time you may
[1:30:49] be walking along again and not even know
[1:30:50] it and blink now all of a sudden
[1:30:53] somebody's coming to church
[1:30:54] mag ties right J say I didn't do
[1:30:56] anything that's right you didn't do
[1:30:57] anything you remember one sews one
[1:30:59] Waters but God gives the
[1:31:03] increase so many times you know we're
[1:31:05] just reaping we say oh praise the Lord I
[1:31:08] I got this guy that you know this this
[1:31:10] this guy off the street this brother the
[1:31:12] sister to come to
[1:31:13] church it's like well praise the Lord
[1:31:16] you don't even know you may hear a
[1:31:18] testimony beyond that what was happening
[1:31:20] behind the scenes for years before that
[1:31:23] time time of harvest came that's why
[1:31:26] it's so important you are a tree of
[1:31:28] life and and as a tree of life that we
[1:31:31] ought to be always ready to give of
[1:31:34] ourselves yes when someone asks that's
[1:31:37] why I just I was so praising the Lord
[1:31:39] for it how how we were talking about
[1:31:41] that artisian well because brother
[1:31:43] brandom dramatized it when that little
[1:31:45] artisian well had a little personality
[1:31:47] he says well what makes you bubble up so
[1:31:50] much what makes you do this and do that
[1:31:53] that's right and what was one of the
[1:31:55] characteristics of that well was that it
[1:31:57] let all the creatures just come up and
[1:31:59] drink freely whenever they needed it he
[1:32:02] said oh there's nothing like a cool
[1:32:04] drink of artisian well water he said we
[1:32:08] appreciate those things and that's what
[1:32:10] you are it said if you could take this
[1:32:12] word out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:32:14] of Living
[1:32:16] Water and we got to be ready when
[1:32:19] someone comes don't even know they need
[1:32:21] a drink give them a drink that's don't
[1:32:25] even know that they're getting a drink
[1:32:27] and you don't even know what it's
[1:32:28] feeding down in their soul that's right
[1:32:32] we think oh it's got to come this
[1:32:34] certain way and this person's going to
[1:32:35] come the way I think they're going to
[1:32:37] because I they just seem to see it you
[1:32:38] don't know what God's doing behind the
[1:32:40] scenes we got to have so much more
[1:32:43] patience with with the with the will of
[1:32:45] God because we want to we want that
[1:32:47] microw wave thing just I want it to be
[1:32:50] done oh so do I don't get me wrong I'd
[1:32:53] love to snap my fingers and see my
[1:32:55] family all believe in this message but
[1:32:57] you know what they're coming
[1:32:59] anyhow they're coming anyhow it doesn't
[1:33:01] matter it doesn't matter where your
[1:33:03] loved ones at if they're below that 500
[1:33:06] feet of mud that light could to strike
[1:33:08] the seed it may have already struck the
[1:33:11] seed and you don't even know what's
[1:33:13] going on behind the
[1:33:16] scenes just because you haven't seen the
[1:33:18] manifestation yet doesn't mean it ain't
[1:33:21] happening there you go there you go
[1:33:24] I like this in the restoration of the
[1:33:26] brid tree we'll just read a few more
[1:33:27] here he said now it's Easter time oh I
[1:33:29] like Easter yes sir but there's too much
[1:33:31] on Easter today about bunny rabbits and
[1:33:33] ducks and pink chickens I've never seen
[1:33:36] a pink chicken but and pretty hats and
[1:33:39] new dresses and that's not Easter Easter
[1:33:41] is the resurrection restoring to restore
[1:33:44] back it's God's restoring time you look
[1:33:47] out over the Earth God is restoring
[1:33:49] restoring what nature that's right he's
[1:33:52] restoring the flower
[1:33:54] he's restoring the leaves he's restoring
[1:33:56] the fruits of the field what is it God
[1:33:58] is restoring it's Easter means to bring
[1:34:01] it back what is it there's been a
[1:34:03] sentence a claim Easter claims are the
[1:34:06] flower now I want you to listen to this
[1:34:08] the flower claims it has a right to rise
[1:34:13] again oh I like that see you don't know
[1:34:17] we want to think that we know all that's
[1:34:19] going on inside the inside of someone
[1:34:23] that we're witnessing to her or family
[1:34:24] members but inside they don't even
[1:34:27] understand it I mean how many times
[1:34:29] maybe you could go back in your own life
[1:34:31] and see when the Lord brought
[1:34:34] you what was it that did it was it your
[1:34:36] great desire to serve God was it you
[1:34:40] just doing as much as you could no God
[1:34:44] it was almost like a light switch just
[1:34:45] turned off what was it God said it's
[1:34:48] your time Glory am the light struck the
[1:34:50] seed and there was a seed that said I
[1:34:53] have a claim to enforce here I got a
[1:34:57] right to rise again that seed that he
[1:35:01] placed before the foundation of the
[1:35:03] world said you know what I got a ticket
[1:35:05] I got a claim to a resurrection and it's
[1:35:08] time to redeem it's time to redeem that
[1:35:14] prize so don't you worry about it don't
[1:35:17] worry about it on your own time he says
[1:35:19] the flower claims it has a right to rise
[1:35:22] again and God law of nature pulls the
[1:35:25] Earth around and makes the law of God in
[1:35:28] nature bring forth an Easter a
[1:35:30] resurrection listen to that listen to
[1:35:32] that again he said and God's law of
[1:35:36] nature pulls the Earth
[1:35:39] around and makes that law of God in
[1:35:42] nature bring forth an Easter it's
[1:35:44] beautifully the return of the sun to
[1:35:47] restore what the winter killed while it
[1:35:49] was from the
[1:35:51] earth God sends the Earth back around
[1:35:53] the Sun as we're told from way back here
[1:35:56] the earth the earth went away from the
[1:35:58] sun went back out here that's the way
[1:36:00] the sinner does gets away from the S so
[1:36:02] n isn't that what winter is how many of
[1:36:05] you remember some of your your
[1:36:07] astronomical classes how when we have
[1:36:09] winter here it's because the Earth is
[1:36:11] farther away from the Sun and we're
[1:36:13] tilted away so the sun's Rays don't hit
[1:36:14] us as directly so we're colder that's
[1:36:17] all it is it's just a season you let the
[1:36:20] law of God work he says it got away from
[1:36:23] it but when this Earth begins to come
[1:36:26] back and when it's out there death
[1:36:29] strikes it it's winter we're just coming
[1:36:30] out of that now it kills every living
[1:36:34] thing it can kill out in Here and Now
[1:36:37] when the earth gets back around the
[1:36:39] seeds is laying in the ground they're
[1:36:41] frozen the pulps run out of them the and
[1:36:44] everything's gone but there's a little
[1:36:46] life
[1:36:49] preserved I'm going to say that there's
[1:36:51] a little life preserved
[1:36:54] don't you worry about your loved ones
[1:36:57] don't you worry about the ones that
[1:36:58] you've been praying for for all these
[1:36:59] years how cold and dark it looks I don't
[1:37:03] care if it looks like their life is
[1:37:04] exploded and everything's burst out
[1:37:06] there's a life
[1:37:08] preserved there's a life preserved in
[1:37:11] there and when the season comes cuz what
[1:37:14] was it it's working according to God's
[1:37:16] law yes sir when that when that Earth
[1:37:19] when that little vessel that person
[1:37:21] whoever it may be starts God starts to
[1:37:23] move move them just a little closer all
[1:37:25] of a sudden things start to thaw out a
[1:37:27] little bit all of a sudden the lights
[1:37:29] begin to shine and then all of a sudden
[1:37:31] this light strikes the seed sir you
[1:37:33] still may you still might not see it
[1:37:35] then those things are germinating
[1:37:37] beneath the surface you just give it
[1:37:39] time pretty soon it'll start you'll
[1:37:41] start to see the fruits of it you'll
[1:37:43] start to see that little Sprout come up
[1:37:45] you'll start to see it put forth
[1:37:47] leaves it's the law of
[1:37:51] God a little life preserved and as soon
[1:37:54] as the sun gets back in position with
[1:37:56] the Earth again then there is an Easter
[1:37:59] a restoration up comes the flowers again
[1:38:02] up comes everything all that the winter
[1:38:04] killed the sun restores all that
[1:38:07] Winter's death killed the son of life
[1:38:11] restores oh I like that and so is it now
[1:38:14] with the people all that the Winter's
[1:38:16] coldest of cold former religion killed
[1:38:19] out there the nearing of the Son of God
[1:38:21] in these last days coming to his church
[1:38:23] restores it back to life again I will
[1:38:27] restore sayeth the Lord see God restores
[1:38:29] his flowers his leaves his nature his
[1:38:32] seed of the earth and therefore we know
[1:38:34] then that God will restore also his
[1:38:37] habitation he will restore his Eden he
[1:38:41] will restore everything that death
[1:38:43] killed that's right Hallelujah now the
[1:38:45] only way that can ever remain dead is to
[1:38:48] let it lay in the wrong place but if it
[1:38:50] falls in the right place it's got to
[1:38:52] come back to life life again so God let
[1:38:55] us fall in the right channel for
[1:38:57] restoration so we've already we've
[1:39:00] already been see that's the
[1:39:01] predestination though that seed's
[1:39:04] already fallen on good ground so now all
[1:39:06] it needs to do is to bring its life
[1:39:10] forth that seeds I'm good ground I don't
[1:39:13] know about you but for the foundation of
[1:39:15] the world God planted a seed yes in that
[1:39:18] good ground you are that good
[1:39:21] ground and now all you got to do Let It
[1:39:23] Grow doesn't matter how cold it got
[1:39:26] doesn't matter what winter looked like
[1:39:28] and how desolate it looked sometimes it
[1:39:30] needs to get a little desolate like the
[1:39:33] scripture said this morning be desolate
[1:39:36] be grieved sometimes it needs to get
[1:39:38] that way so then we can really get to
[1:39:41] that point how brother randam said let
[1:39:43] go and let God where we're finally just
[1:39:45] say Lord I'm going to let the life do
[1:39:47] its work I'm not going to try to hinder
[1:39:49] it I'm not going to put man's hands to
[1:39:52] it see there was a reason in the
[1:39:54] scripture when they built an altar in
[1:39:55] the Old Testament in the beginning and
[1:39:58] the Lord told him he said don't even
[1:39:59] lift a man's tool upon
[1:40:03] it don't even lift your hammer on it
[1:40:06] don't lift the tool of a man on that
[1:40:08] altar why because it's not made to be
[1:40:10] touched by man get those denominational
[1:40:13] hands off my bride get those
[1:40:16] denominational hands off my people get
[1:40:18] man's ideas off that that's what we're
[1:40:22] doing if you start put your hand to it
[1:40:24] the tree will grow
[1:40:26] crooked let God's work do its
[1:40:31] thing oh you'll you'll see you'll see
[1:40:34] that tree maybe get uproot a little bit
[1:40:37] it's big storm came and shook it out a
[1:40:39] little bit man wants to go and put a
[1:40:41] steak in and tie it to it it'll pervert
[1:40:43] the tree but brother ramam said when
[1:40:45] those storms come if it's planted by the
[1:40:47] river of waters those storms and those
[1:40:50] shakings only come to make those roots
[1:40:52] grow deeper
[1:40:54] there's a purpose behind it but man
[1:40:56] would come and put their hands on it and
[1:40:58] pervert it don't even lift a tool upon
[1:41:00] it don't try to figure it out yourself
[1:41:03] don't try to make something happen you
[1:41:06] can't make it
[1:41:08] happen that's right you could take a
[1:41:10] person off the streets that wasn't born
[1:41:12] a born a child of God and educate him in
[1:41:16] every single word of this book but
[1:41:18] educate them in every word of this
[1:41:19] message and they'd still die a sinner
[1:41:22] and go to hell that's right but you
[1:41:24] could take a son or daughter of God that
[1:41:26] come from the garbage heap that look
[1:41:29] like nothing drug addled
[1:41:32] drunk
[1:41:34] apostate looking like
[1:41:37] garbage out there on the road running
[1:41:40] with women or men doing whatever but
[1:41:42] that light strike the seed once and it
[1:41:45] comes to
[1:41:46] life it's not about what you can do it's
[1:41:49] about the word of God and the Holy Ghost
[1:41:52] working through you
[1:41:55] that's we got to stop trying and when I
[1:41:59] say that we got to stop trying to force
[1:42:01] the issue to make it happen though in
[1:42:02] our own
[1:42:04] mind you just got to let the light
[1:42:07] shine don't make it
[1:42:10] complicated well I got to show them this
[1:42:12] scripture and I got to show them exactly
[1:42:13] if the Lord leads you that way sure but
[1:42:16] so many times we just get it locked in
[1:42:17] our head oh I got to I got to do this
[1:42:19] and I got to do that you don't have to
[1:42:20] do anything except yield to the spirit
[1:42:23] of
[1:42:24] God let that light shine we're not going
[1:42:27] to hold you much longer we'll close here
[1:42:29] in just a
[1:42:31] minute but you know you are you're that
[1:42:34] tree of
[1:42:36] life when when when when God sends
[1:42:39] someone your
[1:42:40] way to take of the Tree of Life to eat
[1:42:44] so they could be refreshed so that they
[1:42:47] could receive life you say brother well
[1:42:49] we can't do that yeah you know your
[1:42:51] Prophet called you little Messi
[1:42:54] you can impart eternal
[1:42:56] life it it's not see oh well that lifts
[1:42:59] us up too much no because it's not about
[1:43:00] you it's not about you it's about what's
[1:43:04] inside of you it's about the what you
[1:43:08] carry see the devil would come along oh
[1:43:10] you're trying to make yourself something
[1:43:12] I didn't make myself anything God made
[1:43:13] me who I am and I know that this outside
[1:43:17] person you see is garbage anyhow why why
[1:43:20] do I know that because in order to go
[1:43:22] back into his presence I got to let go
[1:43:25] of this and get a new one but there's
[1:43:27] something inside sir that's going to
[1:43:29] make the whole journey brothers and
[1:43:32] sisters they can't help it because we
[1:43:34] won't well oh man it he I I didn't put
[1:43:38] it there you didn't put it there so why
[1:43:41] do we keep thinking we can shove it into
[1:43:43] somebody
[1:43:46] else all of your desires can't force the
[1:43:51] issue that's right that doesn't mean
[1:43:54] there's it's bad to have that desire but
[1:43:56] if that's what you're relying on that
[1:43:58] it's
[1:43:58] misplaced rely on the word of God he
[1:44:02] promised
[1:44:03] it that's why you know when when the
[1:44:06] Lord revealed this message to me I had
[1:44:09] two brothers come and give me a Bible
[1:44:11] study on serpent seed and baptism and
[1:44:13] the entire Bible study was four
[1:44:16] scriptures and they had they had only
[1:44:18] seen this seen the truth of this message
[1:44:20] for about a week and they didn't know
[1:44:23] nothing either but when the light
[1:44:25] strikes the
[1:44:26] sea I couldn't explain it but I had to
[1:44:30] go back to my family I had to go I had
[1:44:33] phone calls from my former
[1:44:35] denominational pastor's wife try to tell
[1:44:38] me that this was a
[1:44:39] cult that this wasn't of God and I
[1:44:42] didn't know anything up here but there
[1:44:46] was something in
[1:44:47] here that was already anchored so deep
[1:44:51] that I had to tell her look I I don't
[1:44:53] know I don't know nothing about no cult
[1:44:56] I don't know nothing about nothing else
[1:44:57] the only thing I know is that what I see
[1:44:59] is in the word of
[1:45:00] God and I got to run with it I got to
[1:45:04] run with this thing and the Lord ain't
[1:45:06] disappointed he ain't he ain't
[1:45:07] disappointed nothing I've disappointed
[1:45:09] him many times but he ain't disappointed
[1:45:12] nothing and so is it with any of you you
[1:45:15] think oh I can do this and do yes we
[1:45:17] pray for our loved ones we get on our
[1:45:19] knees and we weep and we're going to cry
[1:45:21] out for them but you know what when all
[1:45:23] comes to it we drive a stake in the
[1:45:24] ground and say Lord your word
[1:45:29] said Hallelujah that it would bring to
[1:45:32] pass that's where we lay it because if
[1:45:34] your if your if your desires lay
[1:45:37] anything inside of you of what you can
[1:45:39] do well then you failed from the get-go
[1:45:41] because you're a failure to begin with
[1:45:44] In the
[1:45:45] Flesh oh my goodness why because it's it
[1:45:48] proves it's an anointing of the Catholic
[1:45:50] Spirit anyway because that's what the
[1:45:52] Catholic Spirit does
[1:45:53] convert or
[1:45:55] die and many times whether we think so
[1:45:58] or not we almost want to take people
[1:46:00] just believe
[1:46:02] it how can't you because why because
[1:46:05] when he's revealed it to you it's so
[1:46:07] obvious you can never see anything
[1:46:09] else but how could if the Lord has
[1:46:12] opened your eyes to see the sun and a
[1:46:15] blind man who ever never even knew the
[1:46:17] sun
[1:46:19] existed why can't you see the Sun come
[1:46:22] on and the poor blly man says well I
[1:46:24] don't have any eyes to begin with how
[1:46:27] can you be mad at the
[1:46:29] man why because it doesn't lie in your
[1:46:31] ability to do it anyway and see in that
[1:46:34] example it's easier for us to get out of
[1:46:36] the way because NE none of us can form
[1:46:40] eyes how much more in the spiritual you
[1:46:44] know now in the natural they're getting
[1:46:45] to a point if if the Lord were to Terry
[1:46:47] another 20 years I have no doubt they'll
[1:46:49] be able to plug in bionic eyes into a
[1:46:50] person's brain and make them see can
[1:46:53] only do at the hearing to an extent man
[1:46:56] will be able to counterfeit anything
[1:46:59] just about that God can do so if man is
[1:47:03] is working towards that but we would
[1:47:05] just put that off in the natural and say
[1:47:06] well of course I couldn't do it I can't
[1:47:08] create eyes then how could we ever put
[1:47:10] ourselves in a position where it's up to
[1:47:13] us to bring someone to to to make them
[1:47:17] accept life or not why because if the
[1:47:19] life is there and you Shine the Light
[1:47:24] and you're there to offer that drink of
[1:47:26] water you're there to offer life you're
[1:47:30] there to shine the light of the Gospel
[1:47:32] if the seed's there it will follow the
[1:47:35] law of God and it will come to pass it
[1:47:38] will come to life because it's the law
[1:47:40] that was placed in it didn't have
[1:47:42] anything to do with
[1:47:44] you get yourself out of the picture I
[1:47:47] want you to think about this as we close
[1:47:49] think about and I'm not going to turn to
[1:47:51] the scripture but we know it think of
[1:47:54] Mary and we we just had our our brother
[1:47:56] I can't remember the name preach a lot
[1:47:58] about Mary and all those things a few
[1:48:00] weeks ago when he came and think about
[1:48:03] Mary though she receives a promise
[1:48:05] you're going to have a son his you're
[1:48:07] going to call his name Jesus now I want
[1:48:09] you to think about this nothing in the
[1:48:11] natural what's special about Mary
[1:48:13] nothing there were many other
[1:48:16] virgins many other women many other
[1:48:18] devoted there may have been more there
[1:48:20] may have been many women that were more
[1:48:22] devoted than
[1:48:25] married I mean that's just a fact if you
[1:48:27] read the church age book right at the
[1:48:28] end brother brandom talks about the
[1:48:30] false and the true you know brother
[1:48:32] brandom said that the false will
[1:48:33] outshine the true in works and
[1:48:37] Zeal think about that the next time you
[1:48:39] think that just because someone on the
[1:48:40] outside is working like crazy that means
[1:48:44] anything it doesn't mean it's
[1:48:46] bad you know we can go too far off on
[1:48:48] the other side but see the the devil is
[1:48:51] always trying to make you look at the
[1:48:52] negative see you see someone out there
[1:48:53] on fire for God trying to do the work of
[1:48:55] the Lord and then what's the devil going
[1:48:56] to do he's going to be right there in
[1:48:58] your ear say you could never achieve
[1:48:59] that see how they're working for God you
[1:49:01] need to love God you need to do just
[1:49:02] what they're doing in order to do it
[1:49:04] because that's how the life would
[1:49:05] produce it well it produces it in them
[1:49:07] but that's not my calling maybe maybe
[1:49:09] I'm not called to that well then see
[1:49:11] what the devil see i' I've said this
[1:49:12] before but I'm going to say it again
[1:49:13] he's going to get you coming and going
[1:49:15] because now I'll say something like this
[1:49:17] out of the church age book The the false
[1:49:19] lot Shine the true and works in Zeal now
[1:49:21] the next time you see someone on fire
[1:49:23] for God and trying to do God a service
[1:49:25] and doing something wonderful for the
[1:49:26] Lord the devil's not going to be there
[1:49:27] saying oh you can't do it he's going to
[1:49:28] be like oh you don't want to be like
[1:49:30] that because that ain't nothing but
[1:49:30] serpent seed anyway that's the false see
[1:49:33] how he get you one way or the other so
[1:49:35] that's why we stick with the word we
[1:49:37] stay with the word and we say Lord I
[1:49:40] don't know what you have for that one I
[1:49:42] don't know what you have for this one
[1:49:43] but what do you have for me let me
[1:49:45] fulfill my part and you know what that's
[1:49:48] what Mary Did did she not she said let
[1:49:50] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:49:52] now I want you to think about this she
[1:49:54] had a life in her she was literally
[1:49:57] carrying the Son of God but that's a
[1:49:59] type remember a woman types the
[1:50:01] church but put yourself in this position
[1:50:04] now she didn't she wasn't anything
[1:50:06] special in that sense she wasn't out
[1:50:08] there doing anything she's just living
[1:50:09] her life doing what God called her to do
[1:50:13] which was let go and let God the Holy
[1:50:16] Ghost will overshadow you you're not
[1:50:17] going to have really a part in this
[1:50:18] other than being the vessel and you
[1:50:20] shall bring forth the son and shall his
[1:50:22] name Jesus and I love the way brother
[1:50:24] brandom dramatized it because remember
[1:50:26] now her cousin Elizabeth also had a had
[1:50:29] a
[1:50:30] seed but remember that seed was
[1:50:33] dead she still had a seed
[1:50:35] though I want you to think about how
[1:50:38] powerful how you can impart life you
[1:50:41] don't even see it you not even think
[1:50:42] you're doing anything special remember
[1:50:44] brother brandham dramatized and said
[1:50:46] they came together and they were meeting
[1:50:47] I believe Elizabeth was already six
[1:50:49] months pregnant but the baby hadn't even
[1:50:50] moved still born dead baby but she was
[1:50:54] promised she had a promise and she was
[1:50:56] standing on that promise now Here Comes
[1:50:58] Mary not even thinking anything see this
[1:51:01] is the wonderful thing I love about this
[1:51:03] is because it wasn't about Mary and it
[1:51:07] wasn't even about Elizabeth but it was
[1:51:09] about God performing his
[1:51:12] word because what did she do brother
[1:51:15] brandom kind of dramatized it and said
[1:51:17] he basically just kind of told her what
[1:51:19] had happened gave her a salutation and
[1:51:20] said Elizabeth you'll never believe what
[1:51:22] happened happen an angel came and told
[1:51:25] me I'm going to have a
[1:51:26] son without even knowing a man and you
[1:51:29] know what's going to happen I'm going to
[1:51:30] I'm when he's born I'm going to call his
[1:51:32] name Jesus and he said at the very
[1:51:34] mention of Jesus out of the the name the
[1:51:36] Mortal lips she said the Babe whooped
[1:51:39] within her uh leaped within her womb and
[1:51:41] she and then she goes on whence cometh
[1:51:43] the mother of my Lord and all these
[1:51:45] things but what was it she imparted
[1:51:50] life to that baby
[1:51:55] it's something as simple as a testimony
[1:51:57] she wasn't doing nothing but giving her
[1:52:00] testimony we think we got to go out
[1:52:02] there and preach a crazy
[1:52:04] sermon we got to we got to preach the
[1:52:06] house down we got to have people falling
[1:52:09] out of the
[1:52:11] aisles when the miracle happened just by
[1:52:14] her telling a
[1:52:16] testimony she came see but why did it
[1:52:19] work because Mary was a seed who has
[1:52:23] happened to be carrying a seed and
[1:52:25] Elizabeth was a seed who happened to be
[1:52:27] carrying a seed that hadn't been
[1:52:29] quickened yet and all she had to do was
[1:52:32] let her light shine all she had to do
[1:52:36] Elizabeth let me tell you what God did
[1:52:38] for
[1:52:39] me I don't know a lot of things I'm not
[1:52:43] a great philosopher I'm not a great
[1:52:45] priest or a rabbi but L but there's an
[1:52:49] angel that came to visit me I'm going to
[1:52:51] tell you what he told told me and what
[1:52:54] he showed me and what he did for me and
[1:52:57] just by telling that
[1:52:59] testimony brought life to a seed that
[1:53:02] was
[1:53:04] dead so is it with you you have to let
[1:53:06] your light shine you are a tree of life
[1:53:09] that's right and when people come to you
[1:53:12] looking for something you say I don't
[1:53:13] know what to give them just give them
[1:53:14] what you got that's why brother brandom
[1:53:16] could say just tell them how the candle
[1:53:18] got lit why because it took something as
[1:53:21] simple as a testimony
[1:53:24] to bring forth a John the
[1:53:27] Baptist how do you know that your
[1:53:29] testimony won't bring forth someone
[1:53:31] that's going to shake down something for
[1:53:33] the Lord you don't know that's right but
[1:53:37] the devil tries to oh it's got to be
[1:53:38] this great big thing it's got to be
[1:53:39] prayer lines a mile long and it's got to
[1:53:41] be healings and limbs coming back oh I
[1:53:43] believe that too I believe every bit of
[1:53:45] it I take all of
[1:53:46] it but it it but we we've gotten this we
[1:53:50] have to get to the little before we can
[1:53:51] get to the big
[1:53:53] so let's focus on the little things
[1:53:55] let's not leave the little things
[1:53:57] undone I hope this is all right I just
[1:54:01] it's just really on my heart because you
[1:54:03] know we've come to the point
[1:54:05] where you know just shining your light
[1:54:07] right
[1:54:08] now is such a powerful thing because
[1:54:12] it's in such a
[1:54:14] minority you know we were brother
[1:54:16] brother David was ministering this
[1:54:17] morning on on that denominational spirit
[1:54:19] and these broken sisters and I thought
[1:54:21] about it I said well that's nothing but
[1:54:22] the truth when it comes to e every
[1:54:25] individual's
[1:54:27] life because how Jesus could say he said
[1:54:30] I the vine you are the
[1:54:31] branches if you cut that vine off if you
[1:54:34] cut that Branch off the branch becomes
[1:54:37] stagnant it's dead it has no
[1:54:40] life and and so many times it's because
[1:54:43] if you want to so we our light needs to
[1:54:46] shine how how does it Shine you got to
[1:54:49] be in contact with the power source
[1:54:52] you got to be in constant contact with
[1:54:54] the power
[1:54:56] source and it's got to come to a place
[1:54:59] where as Jesus said I and my father are
[1:55:02] one and I would that they be one even as
[1:55:06] we are one see it used to be in the
[1:55:09] outer Court you would have the Sun that
[1:55:11] would come up and go down it would come
[1:55:13] up and go down they'd go through light
[1:55:15] and dark light and dark so we came a
[1:55:18] little farther and now they're in the
[1:55:20] the the the inner Court and they're in
[1:55:23] the Holy place where well there's some
[1:55:25] light shining but it's it's kind of more
[1:55:26] of a man-made
[1:55:28] light yeah they could shine a little bit
[1:55:30] here and there but how did brother
[1:55:31] brandom say it get a little smoky they
[1:55:34] need to do a lot of maintenance on it
[1:55:36] but see we are coming to a place where
[1:55:39] in that restoration of the brid tree
[1:55:40] where the the uniting time where you
[1:55:45] with your light and the power source are
[1:55:49] going to become one are becoming one
[1:55:52] where your light is always shining
[1:55:54] whether you know it or not and and why
[1:55:57] because that's that shakina of Glory the
[1:55:59] holy of holies that Holy Ghost Light
[1:56:02] that never stops shining day or night it
[1:56:05] doesn't need any cleaning it doesn't
[1:56:08] smoke anything up but it's an
[1:56:10] everpresent
[1:56:12] life all the time 247 when he speaks you
[1:56:16] follow his his his smallest thought is
[1:56:19] your greatest desire that's where he's
[1:56:22] bringing his people in this day and he
[1:56:25] wants you to be that tree of life if you
[1:56:27] take remember he wants to there there's
[1:56:30] there's almost there's two ways to
[1:56:32] stagnate right either you get cut off
[1:56:35] from the source or you refuse to let the
[1:56:38] source
[1:56:39] flow if the S if the if the Lord has
[1:56:43] poured himself his spirit in you but you
[1:56:47] don't do anything with it what's going
[1:56:49] to happen you're just going to stagnate
[1:56:50] you're just going to be never moving but
[1:56:53] that water that's always flowing we got
[1:56:55] to open up those channels and let them
[1:56:57] flow let that light shine let the water
[1:57:01] of life flow through you because he's
[1:57:02] looking for you to deliver it to
[1:57:04] others let's just all
[1:57:08] stand remember it could be something as
[1:57:10] simple as a
[1:57:12] testimony what's the Lord done for you
[1:57:14] that could bring life to that
[1:57:16] seed oh my
[1:57:23] let's just bow our
[1:57:31] heads oh Lord Jesus we just are grateful
[1:57:35] to you
[1:57:38] Lord Lord you've done so much for
[1:57:44] us Lord
[1:57:46] you've given us more than we ever
[1:57:48] deserved according to the flesh oh God
[1:57:50] if it were left up to us us we would
[1:57:52] have
[1:57:53] been just out in the world somewhere not
[1:57:56] knowing what to do or who we were but
[1:57:58] Lord you reach down your Mighty hand
[1:58:00] Lord and you opened our
[1:58:02] eyes filled us with your spirit
[1:58:05] Lord Lord we just ask right now oh
[1:58:08] God that you would help us to be willing
[1:58:11] yielded vessels to you
[1:58:14] lord lord when the devil would come in
[1:58:19] and try to point us out all of our
[1:58:21] faults so God may we just throw our
[1:58:23] faults underneath the
[1:58:25] blood and look to you the author and
[1:58:27] finisher of our
[1:58:29] faith Lord Jesus you are the one that
[1:58:32] that we look to Lord Jesus we're not
[1:58:34] Lord when you were on Earth even you
[1:58:36] told your
[1:58:38] disciples it's not I that do the works
[1:58:40] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:58:41] doeth the
[1:58:43] works and Lord if you could say that how
[1:58:45] much more should we be saying that lord
[1:58:47] it's not us that are trying to do
[1:58:49] anything but Lord you that dwell in US
[1:58:51] Lord you'll do The
[1:58:52] Works Lord help us to be willing yielded
[1:58:56] vessels help us to be a tree of
[1:58:59] life lord always willing like that
[1:59:01] artisian well to offer a drink of cool
[1:59:04] water to those that would be
[1:59:06] thirsty Lord that we would let our light
[1:59:08] shine that our lives would go out and be
[1:59:11] salty Lord and cause others to
[1:59:16] thirst Lord you'll do it for us Lord
[1:59:18] because it's in your word you promised
[1:59:20] it there's a law of that seed that's
[1:59:21] going to bring forth Lord may you give
[1:59:24] us patience Lord to endure to continue
[1:59:27] to press forward Lord and know that your
[1:59:29] word will come to pass Lord because it's
[1:59:31] not our ability Lord but it's your law
[1:59:33] it's your power
[1:59:36] lord lord your Holy Ghost is the one
[1:59:38] that enforces these laws lord it's not
[1:59:41] us that has to do it but Lord we just
[1:59:43] rest and we let you do it Lord Jesus we
[1:59:46] just ask right now that you'd go with
[1:59:47] each and every one as we go our separate
[1:59:50] ways Lord may we not be separated ated
[1:59:52] from that Source Lord that Holy Ghost
[1:59:54] Lord that fills us and energizes us to
[1:59:57] do your will Lord may it us and that the
[2:00:01] Holy Ghost we we just can become one
[2:00:03] Lord
[2:00:05] Jesus may you just go with us Lord this
[2:00:09] evening Lord all the needs that are in
[2:00:11] the hearts of your people Lord you knew
[2:00:13] them before the foundation of the
[2:00:15] world andure our sufficiency Lord to to
[2:00:18] fulfill all the things that we have need
[2:00:20] of we just ask you be with us now in the
[2:00:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[2:00:26] amen you know just as the last little
[2:00:29] thing you
[2:00:31] know you know your life just by living
[2:00:33] your life you know being that salt how
[2:00:37] brother brandom talked about that salt's
[2:00:38] got a contact to
[2:00:40] preserve so as you're out there shining
[2:00:42] your light being salty you know just
[2:00:44] living your life for the Lord if he
[2:00:47] doesn't put it on your heart necessary
[2:00:48] to say something specifically all the
[2:00:51] time your very life in the way you carry
[2:00:54] yourself in the atmosphere you you
[2:00:56] possess will actually make others
[2:00:59] thirsty when they see all around you
[2:01:01] everything's falling apart in the world
[2:01:03] and the insanity that's going on and yet
[2:01:05] you can go into work smiling praising
[2:01:07] the Lord singing the songs of Zion you
[2:01:09] know brother brandom told the story
[2:01:11] about the slave that was the the son of
[2:01:14] a
[2:01:15] king you know that's us on this Earth uh
[2:01:20] we're not slaves in so much as that but
[2:01:23] maybe trapped in this flesh sometimes it
[2:01:26] feels like but you know there was
[2:01:29] something about that that man that
[2:01:31] carried himself in such a way that even
[2:01:34] those around him notice something about
[2:01:38] him and they had to
[2:01:40] inquire that's what we want to be have a
[2:01:44] life that's so salty that they don't
[2:01:46] have a choice but to inquire well why
[2:01:48] everybody else is this way but why are
[2:01:49] you this way cuz you're you're something
[2:01:52] different and whether you think so or
[2:01:55] not that Holy Ghost in you believing the
[2:01:58] word of this hour you're something way
[2:02:01] different you're something way different
[2:02:03] brothers and sisters you know so many
[2:02:05] times we keep our circles so tight here
[2:02:08] which is good that we don't even we and
[2:02:11] we have no concept of the way the world
[2:02:12] sees us oh brother and sisters believe
[2:02:15] me the world if you just live that life
[2:02:17] and you let the Holy Ghost flow they're
[2:02:19] going to they're going to be thirsty
[2:02:21] you're going to be sorry Sal Y and and
[2:02:23] you want to be that that River of
[2:02:25] flowing water flowing out that you can
[2:02:27] offer something to drink you could be a
[2:02:28] tree of
[2:02:29] life to offer life when they come
[2:02:33] asking amen we'll have our pastor come
[2:02:36] and how many of you love the
[2:02:38] Lord amen praise the
[2:02:44] Lord enjoy that this
[2:02:47] evening you know I think one of the most
[2:02:49] in important parts about
[2:02:52] letting our light shine is
[2:02:54] to entertain the presence of the Lord
[2:02:59] you know in too many times we we just
[2:03:02] run off or we close
[2:03:05] service but I thought this morning or
[2:03:08] this evening as brother Randy spoke I I
[2:03:12] thought of our our brother and sister uh
[2:03:17] mother Anette and sister Deborah were
[2:03:19] coming back from El Paso
[2:03:22] and the brother told me he said I was
[2:03:25] driving and I knew I had to get the gas
[2:03:27] and I passed this one I pass that one I
[2:03:31] I finally was led to this gas station or
[2:03:34] this place to eat and he said we were
[2:03:38] there eating and a couple come up to us
[2:03:42] and they asked us they
[2:03:44] said are you uh
[2:03:48] Apostolic and uh the brother said no but
[2:03:51] we're
[2:03:52] Pentecostals or we're Christians is what
[2:03:55] he said we're Christians and they talked
[2:03:59] a little while and the brother man gave
[2:04:03] them the card
[2:04:05] and and I text the man the other day and
[2:04:08] I said brother Driscoll I couple of my
[2:04:12] people met you and and uh they said that
[2:04:17] uh you might be interested in discussing
[2:04:21] the way that
[2:04:22] we uh serve the
[2:04:25] Lord and he texts me back he says yes
[2:04:29] I'm really interested I really want to
[2:04:31] get together and fellowship with you and
[2:04:35] and uh I you know and I just thought
[2:04:38] just the brother just driving through
[2:04:40] led by the Lord and the man wants to he
[2:04:43] said I'll call you later I want to sit
[2:04:45] down I want to talk and I thought my
[2:04:47] heart you know it doesn't matter whether
[2:04:50] he wants to convert me or I want to
[2:04:52] convert
[2:04:54] him
[2:04:57] God
[2:04:59] hallelujah he's in control how many feel
[2:05:01] his presence tonight I do and so I'd
[2:05:05] like I'd like to take a few moments for
[2:05:08] each of us individually as we worship
[2:05:11] and we sing a song just take a moment
[2:05:14] and let that artisian Wells bubble up a
[2:05:18] little
[2:05:19] bit let the spirit
[2:05:23] mellow your spirit and let the words
[2:05:26] that were spoke today settle in I'm
[2:05:30] going to let my light shine I'm going to
[2:05:32] let the spirit flow through me I'm going
[2:05:35] to spend a few moments to evening just
[2:05:39] worshiping the Lord and praising the
[2:05:42] Lord and letting his presence soaked in
[2:05:45] I'm not just going to run out I'm going
[2:05:47] to wait a minute at this
[2:05:50] feet just just going to sit here and see
[2:05:54] what he has to
[2:05:55] say maybe he'll reveal to me my healing
[2:06:00] yes maybe he'll speak to my heart and
[2:06:02] tell me which way to go or what attitude
[2:06:07] to change or what
[2:06:11] nature what better way I can be this
[2:06:14] Shining Light but nothing's going to
[2:06:17] happen outside of him would you just
[2:06:19] want to spend a moment in in his
[2:06:23] presence just letting it soak in let's
[2:06:26] just entertain him for a few moments
[2:06:29] this evening and let the Holy Spirit
[2:06:33] move through us let this word that our
[2:06:36] brother preached to us the tree of life
[2:06:39] that that maybe that life can move up
