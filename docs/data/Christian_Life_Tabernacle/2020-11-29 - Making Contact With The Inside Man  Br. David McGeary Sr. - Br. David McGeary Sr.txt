========================================

[Music] every day [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] is [Music] amen i love the last three lines i'll soar in him amen amen the spirit leads me on amen you know it's really about the person of the lord jesus christ amen in fact that's really what the holy spirit is it's the personal revelation of jesus christ to you personally when you have the lord you have the spirit of god hey amen let's just pray i have a nice picture of myself on the screen which i i don't really need i don't like looking in the mirror i surely don't want to look at myself here amen well god bless you this morning all of you that are here are visitors and different ones and the brothers in the choir i can't recognize you all but we certainly appreciate all our visitors this morning on this thanksgiving weekend let's approach them in prayer this morning if you have a desire in your heart something that you would like the lord to do for you maybe you have a loved one that is in a time of trouble we certainly want to lift them up and sister karen barley such a lovely sister and brother kyle's wife and her mother was ill in italy and because of the pandemic and the italian laws she couldn't go [Music] and be with her mother and lovely christian lady and so i want to keep her in prayer this morning and ask the angels of the lord to come give her peace in her spirit if i could take her sorrow away i would but it's only natural to sorrow and to grieve but we grieve with her in the spirit this morning and we grieve with her in the hope of the resurrection this morning let's approach the lord in prayer our gracious heavenly father [Music] we come be for your throne this morning because there was a gate great price that was paid that we could enter into your gates and that we could kneel at your feet and lay our petitions before you lord and we know that you're a merciful god full of grace and goodness [Music] and father we have a sister that's a part of us lord who's going through the time of loss and we ask that you comfort her in your scriptures father that you comfort her with the hope that we'll meet again for we don't sorrow as other people we sorrow but we don't sorrow as other sorrow having no hope we sorrow having a hope that soon will be quickened forever to be with the lord father others that have loved ones with needs we ask that you meet with them this morning that you touch them father made they realize that no matter how dark this hour gets you have risen and it's a final resurrection it can never be undone you're the same yesterday today and forever we ask you to help us this morning in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you let's turn over to the book of colossians this morning and and uh i'll see where we want to kind of read this morning um if i can find my spot this morning that i'd like to read from let's see if i think it's the ninth verse let's start in the ninth verse it says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding amen isn't that what we want the knowledge of his will wisdom and spiritual understanding that we might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meant to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and i want to hold this thing because i want to talk just a moment on a part of this subject who has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins our gracious father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning we we have a lot out this morning but i'm certainly happy to be here with all of us this morning so we can certainly have a wonderful uh time in the lord and um so you know yeah sometimes during the week you know i i pray and i just you know i just kind of go through my week if i could say it this way with one ear always listening you know just waiting for the lord to give me unction and i think that's what a christian does is they wait on the lord many things we don't understand many things we don't we don't even know what's going to come our way but we have promises in the scripture and and the promises of in the scripture tell us that he'll lead us and guide us in all truth and and so you you christian just lives his life if i could express it like that with one ear towards the sky always listening for the lord always waiting for that impression on his heart and and i often do that when i get done ministering and i've poured my heart out on a certain thought it leaves me very empty it leaves me like what am i going to preach next you know and i start to feel the pressure and and then i start looking to find out who's in town to preach for me and and then i get and find out who can come and and i start making a big list of everybody that i'm going to get to take my job and then retirement starts crossing my mind and and and you go through that process but in that process you just start to listen and the lord will come and he'll just lay something on my heart and and usually he he will lead me to a um a message or a sermon or a scripture or even sometimes a song but what came to me was the message and knoweth it not and and there's a there were several uh questions that have kind of floated around and and and things that have popped up and uh so i just thought you know um this morning this message just seemed to come and answer so many of those things for me and and you know one of the things that we realize that um you know i just want to take a moment is this great political a turmoil that is in the land and and yeah as you noticed i i've never went down those roads and i've never endorsed uh anything or tried to influence anybody or or talk much of politics over here but i i want to talk a few second seconds this morning on politics and uh and i i want to use my thing i did preach a sermon called that we have a candidate amen and uh and i'm i'm i'm standing for that candidate again this morning hoping that's where you've cast your vote and it says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and you know i i notice sometimes if we're not careful and i i say this especially to young people when usually college students and young professionals you are more apt to get caught up in the political environment than someone like myself you know i haven't been through too many presidents i believe that i don't know if truman was president when i was born or eisenhower but that's how many presidents i've been through and uh the world just keeps going you know just people that don't have nothing else to talk about talk about that and uh but uh and and you're more inclined to get involved you know and be influenced and because spirits are out there to influence to try to push you to one side to the other and and so that's what we battle we battle spiritual wickedness in high places and as it as we would call it the power of darkness and i want just to read you as couple statements this morning it says we will we will never do any good with politics it's rotten okay now you can sit down all day long and someone can tell me how wonderful donald trump is and another person can tell me no matter how wonderful mr biden is but they're rotten okay now pick your rotten apple all right they're rotten so alls people have done is they came up the two rotten apples and they said i like the look of this rotten apple better than i like the look of that rotten apple but they will both make you sick they will both make you spiritually sick that's just how it is and and he says it's rotten god's idea of having a king a righteous king is right so why do you think god translates you into a kingdom if you're in politics you've not been translated yet if you're packing a bumper sticker on your car that says trump is hating or abiding his greatness or i mean that must be your car speaking you understand because if a person that's driving that car has been translated then you're in another kingdom you know and that's what happens but let me tell you there's a lot of emotion in um and and in having a cause and get fired up and want to straighten out injustice and and want to go out there and oh this is so bad and we need to straighten this out and have something to fight for and and we need to rise up and march you know and it's vain it's vain you've got to remember these men do not control this world satan controls the world that's why we read and went through god of this evil age satan controls this world they have a leader and it's satan amen you know what i mean so if you want to march for satan's cause because it's got a different face on it and then you know or then this the other side over here has a face on it i want you to listen this because i i want if i can help some of you escape politics politics is a spirit of the devil it's the spirit of the devil it's not the holy spirit and and it's it's very enticing because they absolutely make you feel like you're making a difference you know what i mean if he could offer adam all these kingdoms to jesus yes sir you know what i mean if he could say i'll give you all the kingdoms of all the world you can have all this if you'll fall down and and worship me he was willing to trade that for worship because he already had the worship of the world there was only one person that wasn't worshiping it was the one that had another kingdom his own kingdom and his kingdom wasn't going to bow down for to that kingdom so my goal this morning is to get you to step back and take a breath and not get caught up in all this hatred that's out there all of this division trying to divide us from what country we come from what land we've come from what how that our the the people have been treated well do you want me to spend the next two months letting you know how bad the irish people were treated i could have you in tears how irish babies starve to death because the british wouldn't feed them how they were indentured enslaved in slavery and oh my goodness and but guess what it's all gone right and in those days there was an elect lady of the bride that listened to the gospel of patrick and patrick was no more catholic than [Music] then i don't know who but it's just vain so listen listen this morning never do any good by politics it's rotten god has god's idea of having a king a righteous king is right but politics is just simply spread out you can buy anything out cheat lie steal everything else as i said a few sundays ago and look where you're at see nothing but just a crooked mass of everything but a righteous king can make his own laws he says and you can kill a man you know a good politics that's all right you get out of it and so it is the democracy is a good idea but it won't work just like communism and all things in common sounds good but it won't work no the god oh let me did you you have that on the board thank you the the god way of having a king like david was right you got one mind centered over like one leader and a bunch of peace and so forth you you can't take two or three of them then you mess them all together you come up with any kind of idea now don't you see what's happening you've got conservatives you've got moderates you've got progressives you can't take two or three ideas mix them all together you'll get it all messed up god's way is having a king one mind let this mind be in you that was in christ that's what it's about it's not about anything else but the lord jesus amen you know and and satan appears as an angel of light always offering something if you follow me okay but the father in heaven knows what you have need of even before you ask a righteous man shall not beg bread if we are about a kingdom another kingdom we preach the gospel so people can be born into the kingdom of god where the king is ruling their life the king has one message the king makes the law amen not a group of men called congress not a group of men called senator not an executive order we don't live by the sec executive order we live by divine order amen so the season's over in a few months they'll still be fussing and arguing and carrying on let's just set our wings and soar above all this stuff amen i hate to see that creep into the church that's right i really do i hate it i hate to see i hate to think that young people and believers in this message are promoting and talking about such things i just feel i want to warn you so much he says let me read another statement this is paragraph 58 in tucson arizona we've got a woman judged there in the city that's the reason the city is so polluted we got a woman ain't got no business in politics amen think of it just let that soak a minute i don't think a christian has much business in it either but that's my personal opinion a woman ain't got no business in politics she's got no business over any authority in the church her place is a man's queen at home outside of that she has nothing we know that to be the truth you'll never you'll never find no that sounds old-fashioned but i'm responsible and i know that after my going away from this earth them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find in the days to come that that's exactly the truth because i speak it in the name of the lord now you know you can start to judge yourselves especially in the political environment that we're in when you hear a statement like a woman has no place in politic you young sisters make sure that a spirit doesn't rise up in you you know this woman's rights and and you know we've got to say and we're just as equal i would thank god if i wasn't equal to the world i would thank god if i had a special crown of life and a special position that god hath gave me and and you know every woman can look around at the world and realize that there wouldn't be anybody here if it wasn't for them you know i have a mother i got here i was cast upon this world from my mother's womb it's all part of god's plan you know and and even the scripture says that a woman saved in child bearing now i'm not here this morning to go through all the situations for those that haven't been able to have children you know are they saved i'm not here to go through those of you that have to have jobs who are working we understand those things we have single mothers that's not the things i'm talking about i'm not talking about specific situations that that we have to follow the leadership there is leadership for every single one of those situations in the scripture but the scripture and this word of god is to present to you an understanding of the view and the thinking of god the word of god is the thoughts of god expressed and and so i i just want to just reach out to you this morning and and encourage you not to get caught up in that not to let that fire get started in you that rage in everything amen i i know there's there are people in the world that hate there's people in the world that call people names and and are prejudiced and and degrading and and and full of vile and evil there's evil women in the world there's evil men in the world people killing one another that there's there's women that aren't good women they'll just live in moral no matter what you do it's their spirit it's their nature you know and that's what the scripture says the scripture says that he has delivered us from the darkness which is the world and the world's dark and he's delivered us from that darkness and he's put us into another kingdom another life to live by another set of rules to live by another law to live by satan's eden they have a whole law that they live by the rule of thought that they live by the survival of the fittest all these laws and rules but in god's eden there's none of those laws there's none of those rules there's not even the natural rules that govern us like gravity and and barriers and and thought barriers and creative power and all those things in the other land all that's lifted amen he said if you had faith even in the kingdom you could say to this mountain or you could say to this tree what was he pointing out he's pointing out there's another kingdom with another set of laws and another set of ruling powers but we're ruled by the spirit of what darkness we fight the principalities of the air spiritual wickedness in in high places and politics is a spiritual wickedness and and we've got to stay away from that and we've got to stay away from uh getting caught up in in those things and and let me just say this let me prophesy something to you paragraph 82. to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is groping in insanity and will get worse and worse and worse until they'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's almost that way now can you imagine a man driving with his lights off on the wrong side of the road a ricky young kid supposed to be right out of high school and kill a bunch of people does that stop them isn't it amazing that that's what happened to brother branham does that stop them the next one comes right behind him doing the same thing what's the definition of insanity to keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result behind him doing the same thing can you imagine a young man that thinks any anything of himself getting out here and acting the way they do and you know it it's just you can finish reading the rest of that but let let's realize this morning and let's don't get politics in the church we're not talking we're not here to talk about what's going to happen to this country i've already got the saith the lord about this country it's gone it's gone but god did not leave us without a leader he did not leave us without a country he did not leave us without a land we have a land is there injustice in the world yes jesus even told them the poor you will always have with you and but there's something else that we're a part of and i just hope to hold that that you you hold that dear and true amen so i'd like to uh catch uh say one other thing um and i i told you this morning that this message uh and knoweth it not the lord put it on my heart i i believe i've got several and and many people are sending to me a a youtube post that rather tim hymns has placed in and i'd like to make this a statement concerning my brother i want you to know that i i believe that brother tim is a good godly brother he loves the lord he loves the scriptures he's a good pastor to the sheep that god has allowed him to lead he has a wonderful charismatic personality and i can uh i can consider him a brother amen and i can sit down and fellowship with tim in the lord jesus whom i know well and i can fellowship with him in the scriptures in the lord jesus i know the lord i know the power of his resurrection amen i know the power of his love everything i love the scripture there's no scripture in this bible that you can lay out to me that i can't believe i hope this doesn't offend anybody i have wonderful pentecostal brothers who i love the fellowship with we talk about miracles and the power of god and and the works that god is doing you know and and i i don't want you to be astounded in any way but there are people being healed this morning in churches all over dallas fort worth i mean you do not have an exclusive on the power of the resurrection in fact many times the people in the message are less likely to use the power of god but they're out there today and i love it god's a healer you know what i mean i i i pity the man that when somebody gets healed they get all upset because a baptist did it a real christian's happy that the guy's healed does any everybody know where healing comes from it comes from the lord praise the lord if he chooses to heal somebody i don't care if he uses a doctor i don't care if he uses a uh some sort of money scheme guy that's got some kind of hokey pokey oil and he goes out there and he anoints them with hokey pokey oil and that person has faith in that and they get well it's like the guy said hey i was blind but now i see [Music] now i i don't know you guys are the guys that are the the kings of israel you are the guys that know all the word of god just because it didn't come from the scribes or the sadducee or the pharisee or or the message pastor it's still healing i praise god for healing amen healing was a benefit of calvary he died for everyone [Music] amen if they go up and drink from the healing fountain is because the lord jesus made the healing fountain available to whosoever will you think all the people that were healed in brother branham's campaigns all came to the message no were they healed did we praise god for it yes what what a sorry place that we get in you know it's about him that's what it's always been about so i i want to say this i i don't need anybody else to send me brother tim's video brother tim knows me i love brother tim brother tim can call me yes i'll be happy to fellowship with brother tim i call him brother you know i i don't need a get my opinion and i know people sent send me things for my opinion i have no opinion i'm happy for the guy i'm happy he's happy he's free i rejoice for him he's doing what he feels he needs to do that's wonderful amen i pray for him i hope he's successful yes sir he's not hurting me okay and i noticed that one of the things that he pointed out and i i know it's an invite for people to go watch this and then seek this and seek that it's just what you do when you believe something didn't we read last week the quote that a a jehovah witness believes in what he believes and and a methodist believes what they believe and they're zealous about it in everything well you ought to have something in you that makes you salad you know and and and also i i notice my brother and in in he's right in doing it he pointed out all the bogus things that have come out of this message and i know one of the things that bothers my brother deeply it's the nature and the spirit of most people in this message who don't have the joy of the lord who are that really don't know where they're standing that they've they haven't gone far enough to get the baptism of the holy spirit and they fight amongst themselves now i don't feel we've been guilty of that here and and i don't feel that we've entered into that political arena out there i haven't brought uh uh even conversations like this but you know i i i'll be honest with you when this is several years ago i've changed quite a bit since then but i i was a great i liked the football coach called tom landry and everybody liked him because he looked like brother branham and he wore a hat like brother branham so my carnal mind i liked him and then they fired him and got this other guy in well i hated that other guy simply because i love the one guy but one day that guy made a statement i believe his name was it jimmy jones or jimmy johnson or something like that he made a statement he said i've sold my soul for football i thought that's my kind of man i like people that sell out you know what i mean if he loved football that much that he's willing to give his soul for it then i say hallelujah be the best football coach you can be win the super bowl or be all out eat live drink football i remember uh brother billy paul told me i believe that his father told him this he can correct me if he want but it was something on these that this line i'm paraphrasing something like billy if you're going to be a bum you don't work a day in your life you be the best bum you can be and that's even the way the lord wants things he wants you to be sold out you know what i mean and so we know there's been a ton of different doctrines a ton of different men's ideas trying to pull us this way in that way that's no excuse to not have a christ-like nature in attitude [Music] what we've been preaching is what the lord is trying to do to with his bride is get her to possess the same divine attributes that he possessed the fruits of the spirit the statue of a perfect man and yes there's been many false interpretations and doctrines that's true but remember and wherever the best tree is that's where the most scarecrows are egg men and and so uh there there are many bogus dollars but remember every bogus only testifies that there's a reel somewhere i started collecting silver dollars and and as i was collecting i began to talk to other collectors and one today a man said something to me that shook me in my boots he said boy you got to watch out there's a lot of bogus ones out there i thought what i mean someone would really do something like that you know oh yeah he said they take the certification cases and they open up and they put a lower grade dollar in there and they glue them back together and you can't tell the difference and they they sell them you know and all this stuff and i'm thinking my goodness you've got to have some you know verified you know and remember we've always been taught this we verify everything by the what the word of god this is how we verify things we verify them by the scriptures every person i have fellowship with we fellowship in the scriptures they open their bible and they read the scriptures and have you ever sat down with a really really good seventh-day adventist and had him run the sabbath through the scriptures well when you're done you're going to have church on saturday you won't be eating bacon that'd be hard but that is and there's there's something that that's that's transpiring and so you've got to respect somebody who stands what they believe now i'm going to share with you what the lord put on my heart and actually the holy spirit led of the lord and and to share with you and and and i want to share this with you this morning and he says now that the church this is paragraph 120 that his very whole purpose was the church and how do we get in to this church by one spirit we are all baptized into one body the church the body of christ it cannot fail now he says now here is what happens and i i want you to see what he's saying he says now here is what happens i now watch this just a little figurative picture here and brother bannon again shows his drawing of three rings so i don't know if you can draw three rings or i i drew three rings and he says now on the outside man is flesh i'm going to use brother billy here come here my brother i love you okay now billy's here and i'm here now brother branham did this with the piano but we just want to talk about it the only way that billy can make contact his flesh with me is through one of his senses is that right so he's got five senses so he might not be able to see me now is that right but he can hear me i hope he can't smell me but now he feels me right so now i make contact through the senses of feeling i'm making contact with him through the census of hearing now i'm making contact with him through the sight feeling sound and maybe he can smell my cologne which would be smelling and i'm not gonna let him taste me but right now maybe we have four of the five census going on okay so that's the outside mind thank you i love you that that's the outside man and that's how that that outside man is contacted he's not contacted by any other means and then inside of that we have the uh the spirit man right that was the inside ring and he said he says here he says now the inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life is breathed in to him that spirit is of the worldly nature because it's not given from god so we know that those are like conscious love reasoning memory they're like spiritual faculties that you contact things by you contact the spirit have any of you ever remembered something that you've done that was quite embarrassing and then you got that whole embarrassing feel all over you again look that's that spiritual man that is on could be in in side of you and and so that person inside of there is a a sinner to begin with so another way that you can describe this inner man is spirit is nature it's his nature it's his spirit it's not carnal fleshes it's a life that's in you is your spirit that's your spirit and it's got ways that you contact that you were taught things is that right as you grew up you have certain likes and dislikes because of where you were brought up and who taught you and who influenced you you know and my dad shared his his political ideas with man his philosophy of life in those things and of course when i left his kingdom and entered into another kingdom i put on another mind amen but this spirit man is subject to all those things he says so that he says is a spirit man and that spirit is of the world he he says but it it was given or permitted by god now you got that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies that's right so that person on the inside there is a sinner to begin with and it's got five inlets and he says i i i can call them right off now i can't call them right off now first i know is thought conscience love choice no uh conscience love reason there's five outlets the spirit you can think with your you can't think with your body you think with your spirit that you saw you see the difference right there there's another part of you that's not just flesh you you've got a conscience you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reasoning doesn't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is laying their dead but your spirit can still reason there is five senses that controls the inside man so you have that and and you know many people they want to ask for a uh an answer to questions well this is a wonderful answer now in the last man paragraph 25 now to the last man which is the soul there is the only one sense that controls that and that's free moral agency moral agency free will to choose or to reject now let me tell you what happens many times to people who grow up in the message they all their life they've been raised from day one they can give you a litany of their family lineage in the met message who who their family members were where they were what positions they held and they can give all those all those all those great histories of all those things and what happens is is that they're raised up a certain way and therefore their outward man is molded and shaped by the things they like the taste the things they like to smell the things they like to bend i i when i went over to korea and we went into some places there in the marketplaces and everything and the person we were with they walked into this place that smells wonderful and i was reeling are we smelling the same thing you know it's just like really because he was he associated that smell with other senses that he has so that person that's born up into something they have these senses and so all their life they're taught this is where we go this is this is what brother such and such did this was what brothers left and such did this is what this and then they're inside man that is contacted it's raised up you know i mean i raise my kids not to wear this not to do that to do this to do that all the religious part of it okay but there's that but they're still and that all those five senses and all that inner spirit that spirit man is influenced in fact it gets its whole conception of god and the scriptures through that influence they're taught people that are raised catholics are taught to be catholics they're taught to go to mass they're taught to take communion they're taught to go to confession they're taught their religion and they have a religious experience in that spirit man that's been taught to them and they're just been taught that and taught that and they're raised up in that and then you'll see that's the complaint all my life i was raised up this way all my life i never questioned i never thought it out well that person has something lacking in their life okay they find out that they've never made contact with that inside man for years their life has been ruled by the conversations they've heard by the people they've hung out with by the religious circles it was in it molded their ministries it molded their thinking it molded their defense god doesn't need an attorney he doesn't need anybody to defend him he is lord supreme jesus christ is lord supreme his word is truth and truth alone let every word of god be true and every word of man alive end of story but if you've never in your life been driven to the place of choice or rejection then in your being you don't feel complete so if you find somebody in their life they feel incomplete and they want to know what brought me here now i know that by experience amen i i i i've dealt with years the way i am and why i'm that way i finally went back and spent three years working for my father flying out to california to work with my father to watch the way he did things to to look at the way he think to look the way he reacted look at the way he responded and in doing that i began to find out why i was the way that i was i was driven to that inner man that inner being to where i had to make a choice now don't condemn a man that god is driving to get to that inner circle that center being that's the person that you've got to make contact with and way too many people live in this message in the outer man keeping all the rules in the inner man but they've never made contact with the part within them that chooses or rejects that opportunity never afforded them that they were swept into the ministry swept into the word swept into a position swept into being a spokesman swept into being an ambassador and it all came from those two outer realms but it never came from way down on the inside [Applause] and i'm not condemning i'm defending amen you you've got to make the choice if you're not presented with that opportunity you are an incomplete person and too many people live in complete lives and they're never able to stabilize because they haven't been able to anchor that inside of the inside circle if i don't know if you can see that but this dot this outward man this inward man but now it comes someday that you're going to have to meet that amen that's right now let's listen about that spirit now the reason that people today and don't forget this now you will see what the initial evidence of the holy ghost is now people can live in this spirit this realm the spirit you were born with you can live in that spirit they can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit they can go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have a real spirit of god anointing on that spirit a real genuine spirit of god anointing on that spirit they can heal with that anointing god doing the healing through them in that spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit and you want a scripture right many will come to him in that that day and say lord lord didn't we do that because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman that she was wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her bobbing her hair was wrong well what's your hair got to do with it you know he says well it did the samson whatever whoever shall add one word to this or take one word away you've got to have an ultimate somewhere okay now that ultimate isn't in your five senses right you can't rely on your five senses to know whether something's good or bad for you amen you know you know it's like like you like the feel of a uh maybe a viper most poisonous stink oh that's smooth that feels good i can trust that it feels good you better not trust your feeling he might look good oh that's a pretty snake you know what i mean but it there's death in the pod it's death you can't rely on your five senses you can't rely on how can you rely on a spirit that can get the absolute anointing of god do signs and wonders and then get to the throne and have him depart from me you're a doer of iniquity i never knew you you you you can't do it but there's something that's got to be the ultimate there's something that comes on the inside man something that there yes sir that makes the absolute choice now just stay with me a moment he says so everybody's got to have an ultimate is that right now he said let's read 133 if you're a catholic and i tell you it's not in the bible to eat meat on friday and all these things like this the holy eucharist isn't a wafer because it's a spirit and so forth did you hear that it's not a wafer it's a spirit that you commune with that you take in communion and so forth and you go to your priest and your priest says here's what wrote in our doc in our document if the church is your ultimate you don't have a hoot what anybody else says it's your ultimate now let me say this oh i hope this sinks in to me the whole thing is wrong god's word is the ultimate whatever that word says that's the ultimate now you've got to go back in the beginning was the word this bible though i've seen people extremely skilled in this bible to my amazement and to my shame how they can take the scriptures don't sit down with somebody that a good united pentecostal brethren who believe speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy spirit and think you're just going to get past him with throwing out a few statements that brother branham made he's not moved by brother branham it might be okay for you to pat yourselves on the back and say this is believed but you've got to know why it's not the evidence of the holy spirit you can't run and put some sort of religious covering over you called the message and just because you're in the spirit world and in the flesh world with a bunch of message believers now you have to understand to me the message is jesus christ the person of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i just happen to believe that william branham preached jesus christ the same yesterday and day and forever he wasn't preaching his interpretation of the bible he was preaching the word of god amen but so he so we we see that we want to know that he says the whole thing is wrong god's word is the ultimate whatever that word says that's what's right now the only way up here in this sphere the only way up here in this inside person here the only way in this spear that you could ever be in this little inside man you have to be for ordained because you was with god and you're a part of god [Applause] so this inside man here that you're inside that inside part that makes the choice look there's something that is in you put in there because you were with god in the beginning right he thought you if we go back and read in colossians which i probably should have done all things that were made all things that were created by him all things that consist if it weren't so that inside man that's in there the man that is going to come to the place to make the choice now the only way that man has to be foreign because you is with god you're a part of god i was in my father i was in my grandfather my great father by seed i was in that and i was in christ you were in christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him hallelujah his children that was in him now so there's got to be something in there that's going to make the choice okay now listen let us sink in let it sink in i was in christ you were in christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own that was in him now don't forget that hallelujah his children that was in him he never came to save the devil's children they never will know it they won't know it they're blind miserable poor wretched naked right and don't know it why don't they know it that's the question and and they are so shrewd in the ways of their intellect learning that you can't compare with them at all you can't out-talk them but by faith you see it now science don't need any faith science proves what they're talking about they don't need any faith now that's why someone will say let me take my bible let me sit down and reason with you let's go back over all the history all the events all what you call vindication believe me this message didn't need one miracle to be vindicated to me [Applause] it didn't need newspaper articles it didn't it the healing the divine healing and all those things it doesn't need it now science don't need any faith science proves what they're talking about they don't need any faith they don't need it what is faith revelation so let me just read another statement and i'll close let's just go down we can read um paragraph 144 the bible said so i can't explain how it happens but it happens god said so i tell you you have you can't tell you nothing about it faith doesn't explain it did you know that faith just believes it now so you understand there now here's something that is working in some buddy that causes them to believe so they're finally brought to that choice so you can live in the fleshly realm which there's people out there that live totally in the flesh there's people that live in the spirit realm but they've never been brought to that inner man now when someone tells you that paul went to the mountain come let us reason together and he went over here and left sign there's reason and let's reason and let's reason and let's reason paul never went there to change their mind he went there to see if the seed was in there he was using that reasoning for them to go through their experiences and all of a sudden realize wait a minute there's another man in here there's another person in here that's in air scriptural air to say that paul went to have an intellectual change of mind when paul believed you must be born again and filled with the holy ghost we wouldn't go in there to try to get them to come to some mental conclusion no he was preaching to see if there was something in there a conviction in there i was hippie as can be there's no physical evidence that you can see that i used to have a lot of hair most of my early years 18 or so 19 almost every day i was in under the influence of some form of narcotic but when a man told me that it wasn't right for a man to have long hair i told him jesus had long hair the disciples had long hair i gave him everything he wanted every excuse and everything but something in my heart stung [Applause] i tried to explain it away re reason reason reason it away what did they want to do they want come reason with me come sit down let's talk about it let's go through the scriptures everything that's not what i'm built on you can believe every bit of every miracle that's been performed through all the church ages every vindication it won't do you a bit of good to believe that cloud if there isn't something in there ordained to choose it amen so when a man comes to that point that choice on the inside and there's not something ordained in there to choose it he's going to have to go back out to the five senses and to the spirit realm i don't believe this message for any other reason except that god put something in me to receive it this message is not to the world it's not to the baptist it's not to the methodist it's not to the presbyterian it's not to anybody that whom it was for ordained and sent to and the question i can't answer is why is that seed there [Applause] you'll never be able to answer it you can take me you can't not one scripture you're gonna read to me that i don't believe i hear a man in 99 what he's talking about complaining about the attitude in the message complaining about the lack of faith in the message i agree with every single one of it i've preached the same thing i agree with the complaint i agree with the discouragement yes sir yes sir i agree with the lack of people coming to the place and finding that inward man but when you get to that inward man if that seed of god's not in there you will not have anything in you to make the choice you can spend years in those other two realms but one day you're going to come to the hour of your decision and your choice and reasoning okay i see everything you're saying there's no proof about how many people died here there's no proof whether this person was healed because this this evidence falls apart this evidence falls apart all that evidence but there's one thing i can look you straight in the eye and say friend what about this evidence that's on the inside oh yeah go ahead and sit down brother just just sit down it's okay it's just the gospel it's the same gospel that's been preached for 2 000 years what are you going to do about that okay what are you going to do about this thing that's in here when i hear this it says amen that's the truth how do i get free from that how are you going to explain that away i believe that voice before i ever knew there was a miracle done if you ever before i ever knew there was such a thing of malachi 4 5. you can not reason that out of me i've got a i don't write them down i've led many a people to the lord i prayed for many sick and had them healed i've seen signs and wonders it's not what i'm made out of i came in contact one day with the inner man and when some people finally got to the inner man they found out there wasn't a seed there so when the seed's not there then you've got to go back out to the spirit man and what's the shuck pull away from it pulls away from the sea not from the message this message is just another man-made religion not the word not the ultimate word that was in my god's thought from the beginning but this organizational conventions and churches and ministerial groups and all that that's just a man's carnal put together what god's church is what that word was was the seed that he planted in that inner man [Applause] that's what he came to redeem not somebody who wants to present a better attitude we need a better attitude we need a better nature we need to more spirit we need more scriptures well let me tell you it's to our shame that we're not well versed in this book i deem that complaint accepted and well deserved i deem the complaint that people aren't led by the spirit of god and they're led by the letter as well deserved and received but i believe i have record people that know me that even go to church in certain places that i've always believed that it's a personal relationship with jesus christ but you cannot make a god choice without god being in you to make that choice paragraph 45 jesus said to nicodemus the sanhedrin economic counsel of his day came to him by night and said master we know you're a teacher come from god because no man can do the things that you do unless god be with him now that goes for anybody he said verily i say to you except the man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of god he said me and old man enter into my mother's womb and be born he said now how am i going to tell you heavenly things when you won't even believe earthly things he said one day except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you did he explain it he didn't have to explain it you understand because peter who didn't know what in the world he was talking about everybody else went and reasoned it out and they said wait a minute there's no vindication here there's no proof of that no science for that no newspaper articles that no vindication for that and jesus says will you also leave he says where can we go that was in peter's mind that wasn't peter's reasoning there was plenty of youtube tapes in israel pointing out lots of different ways that was something that was in peter on the inside man not the old nature that snake nature that always chooses the other two realms this was something that was in him that was predestinated there from the foundation of the world that now took over the control tower and its signal was limited to one thing only divine revelation he said where am i going to go i've listened to everybody around you alone have got the words of eternal life let me tell you people aren't preaching a new gospel they're just trying to preach a new attitude a new approach to the world a more kindly experience a more loving christ-like nature praise god i believe in that this isn't that this isn't christianity this is a direct divine signal from heaven aimed at a reception that's in the heart of us elected predestinated people we should have everything every christian has we see they have the love the nature the works the movement of the holy spirit signs and wonders following us we should have all that from the scriptures we should have all that from the anointing of the holy spirit but the connection between this does not connect with the spirit man it only connects with what's on the inside of the inside of that do not de-christianize people who don't see what you see they don't have it inside of them to believe with and when they looked it wasn't there and they were honest god i can walk with an honest man i can go preach the gospel with an honest man i can go preach with an honest man a man that will say to me brother david i love the lord i love the scriptures i'm filled with the holy ghost i don't see it okay brother don't condemn me because i see it because i can't help it i already tried to shake it i can't help it i'm not pretending with you i love you i understand when it came down to it there wasn't that thing in there that by divine revelation said amen because you couldn't explain it or you couldn't understand it or you couldn't reason it that does not make a person not a christian that does not keep a person out of the kingdom of heaven quit treating everybody that don't believe what you believe like a devil you're having a spiritual jihad you've got the gift of casting on of devils instead of casting off of devils i don't need the comfort of somebody agreeing with me i have a comfort that was put on the inside man that was put in there but found the foundation of the world something a seed of god that came from god because i was a part of him in the beginning that's what says amen not my mind not my senses not everything else what do you do everybody wants to send me videos and what's my opinion i have one opinion if you have eternal life you always had eternal life amen if you were in his thinking in the beginning you'll be there if your name was written in the lamb's book of life you'll be there but don't put me outside because i don't agree with you i'm just going to draw a bigger circle around you brother and put you on the inside i totally understand you don't have anything in you to believe with that's okay with me and if you want to go gather up everybody else who doesn't have anything in them to believe with i'll help you but i can't get rid of the unbelievers i can't get rid of the make-believers and go ahead and criticize the make-believers but there's one thing you can't criticize is the divine province of god to put the seed in the heart of his choosing i do not believe this message by historical vindication i do not believe this message by quote unquote experience i don't need experience i believe this message because god put something in me i can't reason it away you show me all the proof that brother branham's a liar he's a cheater he faked everything everything he said is not true all that brother i'll accept all that but what are you going to do with what's in here [Applause] do you want to lay hands on me and cast that out of me is that a devil now call me false i'll accept that call me deceived i'll accept that yes sir call me in bondage i'll accept that call me any name criticize me according to every outside circle in realm and religious explanation but you'll never do away with the fact i know whom i believed that i've met jesus christ personally that my name's written on the lamb's book of life whether the seventh seal is opened or not open has nothing to do what's in here it's great for fellowship but what's in here is foreign you don't have to criticize this message to have a wonderful experience in the scriptures you don't have to criticize this message to live in the spiritual realm to pray for people to help people to to do good things to preach a christ-like attitude to preacher christ-like nature that's fine i'm for that i support that but if this is in here you can't help it it's like steel to a magnet you don't believe it here see if it goes down and it doesn't anchor here if it goes down and it doesn't connect with the part that was there from beginning if it doesn't connect with the other side of the paper right the part that was in heaven before and the part that's placed inside of you if it doesn't connect together and you can't make that connection then this makes no sense it makes no sense without the seed word connection and god sent this part it's called the word and he put this part in you before the foundation of the world amen so you could be raised up in this part all in your childhood all in your religious experience but one day you question what is this where did it come from why am i believing it so you run it through the flesh man and you run it through the spirit man and then it finally comes down to see if it finds a place to anchor and if it's not there and god didn't put it there it don't draw the picture amen so all of a sudden you start saying the picture don't fit it don't fit this message doesn't fit it doesn't fit no it doesn't fit for people who don't have the other part of god in their heart [Applause] you don't have it he separated eve out of adam it don't fit and we become worse than the accuser for condemning somebody who's honest enough to say i brought it to my heart and it didn't fit thank you brother for being honest enough spiritual enough to leave our ranks but there's many many many many many people sitting in mets at churches who have never taken it to find out if it fits they just live in a religious realm a church realm and that's what i'm saying to you young people you better make sure it fits because you'll fall apart somewhere down the line you have got to get to the place where you've got to ask yourself is this in me does does this come together now you can't reason that out of me do you understand i can't help it it fits for me now if it's the devil then i was preordained for ordained to be a devil but because it doesn't fit for you doesn't make it wrong it makes it wrong for you and i respect that i respect that a hundred percent you've got a lot more courage than a lot of the hypocrites that we have in this message who just thrive on intellect they thrive on and make living out of preaching the gospel to people that have grown up in it and don't know nothing else i recommend that you go to the back side of the desert do you pray fast if necessary till you know in your heart but on the shadow of a doubt this fits what's on the inside of the inside of me and i'm not anchored because of stories i'm not anchored because of history of miracles i'm not anchored by intellectual understanding i'm anchored because that voice matched something that god put in me [Applause] and nobody's clever enough or smart enough to take that part out now you may have not found it yet but it didn't come from man it came from god don't tell me it's unscriptural you give people a math book they'll come closer together you give them a bible they'll go far apart the kingdom of god flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven revealed it to you upon this rock i'll build my church the church is not built on reasoning it's based on the revelation that the seed of god is in you paul when he said come reason he was saying let's use that faculty of the spirit man to see if we can find an avenue to the soul that's in the inside and see if the things that i'm saying will stick amen if they don't stick the fellowship is right here and that's all the poor soul is saying i don't have it on the inside so i'm looking for fellowship here who will come fellowship with me i will i will i'll come fellowship with you there i'll fellowship with you in that realm i'll fellowship you with you in that spirit i have that i have that i have this bible i have the spirit i have laying on of hands i have good works i don't like talking like this sister jeanette chewed me out because i run myself down so i told her i'll lift myself up i've got those things that's right i know what it's like to give i love to give i love to help i love to have people conquered that's in my nature because i've been born again and the love of god is shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit i love those things i have fellowship in all those things but i don't believe the message because of anything i don't believe the message because of anything in this realm or this realm it's something that god put in me that it connected with those apostles in them of that day paragraph 150 who was ordained to life he noted said all the father hath given me will come the only thing you have to do is just make my voice known they know it for my sheep know my voice okay so tell me it's not his voice okay it's not his voice it's not his voice to you out and take somebody's pet you know call him by a name my son's got a cat that's a dog oliver over here he comes no other cat responds it's not a generic call now if you want to preach a hear kitty kitty gospel go ahead here kitty kitty kitty i've got something for you i've got a better attitude i've got a better nature i've got a better interpretation of the scripture here kitty kitty kitty kitty but this isn't a kitty kitty gospel this is a gospel that's got a name on it it's got my name on it they know it my sheep know my voice and a voice is a word expressed they believe it anyhow they don't have to scientifically prove anything or ask any sadducee or pharisee or anything else about it i said it they believe it my sheep hear my voice can you imagine something that's supposedly preaching the unadulterated word of god directing you to places of question or say listen to this person he's got a good personality i'll tell you where god meets a man he meets the man on the word of god by the baptism of the holy spirit and if you don't have this inside we can talk until we're blue in the face nobody can prove it a trial are you putting the predestinated seed of god on trial who in the world do you think you are yes sir 817-909-5154 i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god [Music] that's not the question you know why it's successful because so many people have never made contact with the inside man what they've got is not genuine and they just criticize it and their criticism is true and it'll swallow up people who see the same thing they believe it for my sheep know my voice and this is the voice of god in letter form because this is the entire revelation of jesus christ old and new testament put together there you are why you say these are good people what makes them because one thing their thai post is on a church and you remember last sunday a week ago how many was here and heard the sermon the anointed ones in the last days i think all of you see they are anointed their spirits are anointed in this second realm let's just eat here he says let's paragraph 160. now you tell her that it's wrong for her to cut her hair the bible said so it's wrong for her to wear them shorts the bible said so and she says it's nonsense why her ultimate is not down here in that third man the soul that's predestinated and sent from god but her ultimate is on the organization out here that some some man or some organization outside of this so what happens is it's not on the inside so what does he do he turns to somebody on the outside a good brother oh brother such and such fine brother i've known him for such a long time wonderful brother wonderful spirit go listen to what he has to say go ahead go ahead i would rather have 10 people with the seed of god that could do something go ahead i don't have to fight it you don't need to fight it you understand it's all ready there i didn't receive a new message half of the message was already in me all the message did was made me whole it didn't make the the brother whole so he's returning to what he's hold a good godly spirit-filled man fill of the holy ghost a wonderful pastor a wonderful brother amen commendable for the healings that have followed his ministry for the wonderful deliverance i believe if someone came for them about he'd give him godly counsel there's nothing wrong with the person as far as being a christian it's just this message isn't for christians but if the word of god is down in that soul okay what is the soul it's the free will that makes the choice if there's so isn't something in there driving that choice you only have one place to return to to make the decision right your flesh or your other senses but if that word of god is down in that soul it says amen i see it it lines up with it wait a minute not carnally lines up with it that's where the air is that's why we've taught the gospel wrong but if that soul's in there it lines up with it it matches it fits now can you imagine me going home saying sweetheart i really love you you're a beautiful woman to me i think you'd look prettier in a pair of pants if you think i can sell that to leslie you don't know her very well because if it comes down to the word of god she's going to say sweetheart i love you take a hike but if it's not inner can you imagine my wife coming to me and saying you know dear i don't really see everything brother venom sees what they testify to i don't really see this i don't really see that i wouldn't divorce her i'd say honey i'll pray for you i believe it's in there and i believe if you pray long enough and you pray for me long enough and you'll help me that one day those pieces will slide together and they'll match but if someone drops it on you like this and that part matches up you can go on that a long time but until it matches up on the whole picture you're not complete you've got religion instead of life it lines up with it now look here therefore the man that's born of the spirit of god see here on the outside i'm speaking in mix audience and he'll just go down to that we won't go there i had such a so many wonderful wonderful statements that can be read uh in in the great things of god this morning he says a real genuine this is paragraph 181 a real genuine christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was back yonder at the beginning which is the word is am i drawing the picture clear enough for you this morning without a shadow of a doubt so when you hear these things you can sit there and say i understand where he's coming from i totally understand it because if it's he said a real genuine christian will hope with that inside man that spirit that was back yonder at the beginning which is the word he was it was as he was the fullness of all of you look at that statement is it up there he was the fullness of all of you you were in him back yonder at calvary he foreknew you would be here he only broadcast what would take place and you were in him you died with him you died to your pride you died to your fashion you died to the world you died with him in calvary and you rose with him when he rose again on the third day and because and because you've accepted it now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus there you are it's that inside man that inside that will punctuate the word hang with the word regardless you can't help it hallelujah that's right i can't help it my reasoning don't work i i i i can't help it i can't help it fits i can't help it's putting something there i don't condemn you for not having it maybe you do have it and you've got to go through this i am not going to draw a circle and put somebody out draw a bigger circle he goes and he gives the end of the book if you want to go home and read it he explains his experiences that brother branham does why he's anchored but i'm not anchored because of what brother branham was anchored to i didn't know brother branham i know when brother brahm died because i was in a car when it came over the rodeo and for some strange reason it made me cry i heard a tape listening to it drove up the street and saw exactly what was on the tape there i personally don't need any outside vindication i have my own vindication that's right now god makes some vessels to honor some to dishonor if if you choose to put me in the vessel of being dishonorable you have a right to do that but the fact that you can't reason it out and you can't find scripture for it and if you don't believe what's said that doesn't make it wrong it's been proved to me beyond a reasonable shadow of doubt so you have to know this gospel beyond reasoning so when someone invites you to reason and says let's reason remember they're inviting you out to the second circle and the only reason you'll go there is because there's not a seed on the inside of the inside to keep you there now i asked you this morning you say what should i title this sermon how about making contact with the inside man and so that's where i stand i'm open to fellowship i've given my phone number out as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord amen and i'm i'm not going to war against christians i'm not going to try to dis de-christianize anybody i'm thankful i want soldiers that stand next to me that are willing to die for the cause that believe what what i have experienced that have got on the inside of them what i've got on the inside of me i am not the one who chooses to put it there it's predestinated foreordained and that's what the prophet said i preach this message to some people and they just take it and they believe it and they go with it he says that's because it was foreordained and some people grew up in it in their life they were raised in it they were taught in every experience they had was in it could they never they never was able to really come and get to that experience and don't let that happen to you don't let that happen to you you make sure you pray and you get into the presence of god and you say like peter flesh and blood hath revealed this to me there's something in here that it matched up god bless you this morning amen oh it's stained this morning [Music] is [Music] he's so good is [Music] [Music] any [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] answers [Music] among us all that he does [Music] could never contain [Music] [Music] [Music] to me [Music] [Music] this night hallelujah [Music] is [Music] [Music] i [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] up [Music] god has been good [Music] who is [Music] [Music] whom shall [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] i am [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] again one more time [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so you could see so you can have it in your heart hallelujah amen [Music] truly lord we have been blessed father we're just so thankful that you speak to us lord that you come and you minister a minister to us lord that that lord that you gave us that seed lord that there's that connection that takes place it's
