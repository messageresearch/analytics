[35:13] well I don't know but I just wanted to
[35:15] be well and today in the service I think
[35:18] like last week I kind of noticed it but

[41:33] offerings we don't have any written
[41:34] requests but continue to pray for those
[41:37] that are still out and need help and you
[41:39] know sometimes when the Lord puts a
[41:40] burden on your heart it's for a purpose
[41:42] and it's for a
[41:43] reason and so it's not in vain that the
[41:46] Lord puts something on somebody's heart
[41:47] and so if you have a burden to pray for
[41:49] somebody or keep somebody on your heart
[41:50] do it because it's from the
[41:52] Lord and it could change things because
[41:55] now we're playing the position of a body
[41:58] and everyone's desire becomes one
[42:00] another's desire to carry us through
[42:02] together because we're a family amen

[50:52] your Bible and you want to turn with me
[50:54] we'll go to mark
[51:13] 11 certainly happy for the testimonies
[51:16] of our Lord and how he's undertaken for
[51:18] us we know that brother Tommy had a
[51:21] request for his sister Vicki and we're
[51:23] just believing with him that the
[51:24] supernatural God that we believe in will
[51:27] be his portion and and that Vicki will
[51:31] soon see the hand of God once again
[51:34] Amen in Mark 11 we're going to read
[51:37] verse
[51:38] 12-4 it says this and on the tomorrow
[51:42] when he was come from Bethany he was
[51:46] hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off
[51:50] having leaves he came if happily that he
[51:53] might finding any of any anything
[51:56] thereon and when he came to it he found
[51:59] nothing but leaves for the time of figs
[52:02] was not yet and Jesus answered and said
[52:05] unto it no man eateth fruit of thee
[52:08] Hereafter
[52:11] forever and his disciples heard it amen
[52:15] we also want to read if you could turn
[52:17] with me to Philippians chapter
[52:19] 3 you know it's our heart's desire that
[52:22] the Lord would move upon us and the Lord
[52:25] is the word amen so we want to say Lord
[52:28] let your word come into my heart and put
[52:30] me into action inspire me by your word
[52:33] we know that it has to drop through the
[52:35] channel of our mind but we want it to
[52:37] anchor down in our heart where the
[52:39] spirit of the Lord will overshadow his
[52:41] word in our heart and it's just now that
[52:44] faith that we've heard this morning amen
[52:47] I want that
[52:49] Victory so in
[52:52] Philippians if you found it say amen
[52:56] praise the
[52:57] Lord we're going to read there in verse
[53:00] we'll start with verse 17 3 and 17
[53:05] Brethren be followers together of me and
[53:09] mark them which walk so as ye
[53:13] have us for an example well I thank God
[53:16] that he has men that are examples that
[53:19] we can follow after
[53:21] amen for many walk of whom I have told
[53:25] you often and now tell you even weeping
[53:29] that they are enemies of the Cross of
[53:31] Christ whose in is destruction whose God
[53:34] is their belly whose glory is in their
[53:37] shame who mind Earthly things for our
[53:41] conversation is in
[53:43] heaven you know that word
[53:46] conversation in the in the reference
[53:48] reading it says our
[53:50] citizenship I really like that for our
[53:53] citizenship is in heaven
[53:55] from whence also we look for the Savior
[53:59] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change
[54:02] our vile bodies that it may be fashioned
[54:06] liken unto his glorious body according
[54:09] to the working whereby he is able even
[54:13] to sedo All Things unto himself amen if
[54:17] we could also read there one more
[54:19] scripture passage in Philippians 4 and
[54:22] we'll find that in verse 4 Philippians 4
[54:26] just one chapter forward rejoice in the
[54:28] lord
[54:29] always and again I say
[54:33] rejoice I like that emphasis amen if
[54:36] you're sad today Rejoice doesn't matter
[54:39] what the doesn't matter what the
[54:41] situation is the word says that you can
[54:43] Rejoice he wouldn't tell you that and
[54:45] then confirm it by saying it again if
[54:48] you can't do it no matter how dark the
[54:51] situation Rejoice Amen Let Your
[54:55] moderation be known unto all men the
[54:59] Lord is at hand be careful for nothing
[55:02] but in everything by prayer and
[55:05] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[55:07] request be made known unto God and the
[55:11] peace of God which pathe all
[55:13] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[55:15] Minds through Christ Jesus finally
[55:18] Brethren whatsoever things are pure
[55:22] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[55:24] Things Are honest whatsoever things are
[55:27] just whatsoever things are pure
[55:29] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[55:33] things are of good report if there be
[55:36] any virtue and if there be any praise
[55:39] think on these things these things which
[55:42] ye have both learned and received and
[55:45] heard and seen them in me do and the
[55:50] peace of God shall be with you amen we
[55:53] trust the Lord will add a blessing to
[55:55] the reading of his word you may have
[55:56] your
[55:57] seats well I certainly appreciate that
[56:00] you know it's you
[56:02] know we we need a time right now that
[56:07] the peace of God would be in our hearts
[56:10] now everything in the world jobs School
[56:13] the demands of life and things like that
[56:15] is to rob the peace of God from our
[56:17] lives but we have within the word of God
[56:22] we can make I love this it says be
[56:24] careful for nothing but in everything by
[56:26] prayer and supplication with
[56:30] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[56:33] known unto God and that for a title I
[56:35] want to speak to you a little bit about
[56:38] letting let your request be made
[56:41] known you know it's it's so important
[56:45] you know in relationship if you never
[56:47] tell your friends or your loved ones
[56:50] what your request for them is and there
[56:53] there's no way for them to respond back
[56:54] there's no way to to Really share with
[56:58] you like hey I want to do this because
[57:01] You' requested this of me and I want to
[57:03] do what's pleasing to you right you know
[57:05] it's so important that we let our
[57:08] request be made known even with our
[57:09] relationships with one another you know
[57:12] sometimes it's so hard just to like the
[57:15] scripture says because there's all these
[57:17] things that our minds are are being
[57:21] polluted because we're in a world that's
[57:23] polluted and there rejecting God but the
[57:26] scriptures admonishing us to think on
[57:29] these things think on things that are
[57:30] pure Things Are Holy and you know we
[57:33] don't have to succumb to the world
[57:35] that's right we don't have to bow down
[57:37] to all of the thinking all of its
[57:40] impurities all of its requirements you
[57:43] must work you must this you must but the
[57:45] scripture says think on these things
[57:48] amen so we want to forsake everything
[57:51] else we want to let the word of God have
[57:54] preeminence
[57:55] we want to think on these
[57:59] things you know that's that you know the
[58:02] enemy is not just trying to steal away
[58:03] our peace but like we heard today he's
[58:06] trying to he's he's attacking our
[58:08] faith you see if we just get so like
[58:12] like it says there in uh Philippians
[58:14] 3:19 he says like there was destruction
[58:17] because their minds were on Earthly
[58:20] things you know and the belly is a type
[58:22] of appetites the things that are fleshly
[58:26] man it Wars against the spirit and it's
[58:29] going in One Direction that's
[58:32] destruction but who shall change our
[58:34] vile
[58:36] bodies
[58:39] amen and our
[58:41] citizenship is in heaven
[58:44] amen and I was just thinking you know I
[58:49] in my own personal study and you know
[58:51] you sometimes probably do the same thing
[58:53] but you know the script SC saying by
[58:56] prayer and supplication with
[58:57] Thanksgiving you know we're living in an
[59:00] atmosphere where people are unthankful
[59:02] they're Unholy you know but the
[59:05] scripture is saying clearly it's it's
[59:07] there's no Shadow of Doubt it's saying
[59:10] clearly by prayer and supplication with
[59:13] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[59:16] known so it doesn't matter how hard the
[59:18] trial is by prayer and supplication with
[59:22] Thanksgiving we don't want to miss that
[59:24] part I like how brother Billy pointed it
[59:26] out it's not in our frustration that
[59:28] we're going to God and speaking the word
[59:31] you know you know I like it how even
[59:34] Brother David said something or maybe it
[59:36] was brother Matthew but you know
[59:38] sometimes someone runs you off the road
[59:39] you know I just let them die you know
[59:41] it's like that's not the right attitude
[59:43] you know it's like wait a minute am I
[59:47] speaking out of my
[59:49] frustration you know is that is that
[59:51] Earthly minded or is is that taking the
[59:54] citizen ship that I have in Christ and
[59:57] letting it speak
[1:00:01] amen you know just for a little subject
[1:00:04] as you know the scripture says in
[1:00:08] another place it says whosoever shall
[1:00:11] say and I thought that's an important
[1:00:13] subject because sometimes it's
[1:00:17] whatsoever you say we we dwell on that
[1:00:19] part of it like what you say but now the
[1:00:22] scripture also says in another place
[1:00:25] whosoever whosoever shall say to this
[1:00:30] mountain and you know this is so
[1:00:33] important because because we are
[1:00:35] citizens from another
[1:00:37] kingdom because you have power that's
[1:00:41] backing up your
[1:00:43] word so now we want to make
[1:00:45] sure that we're speaking those things
[1:00:48] that are pure that are honest that are
[1:00:50] of a good report things that are lovely
[1:00:54] amen we want to be mindful we want to be
[1:00:56] conscience that God wants to use our
[1:00:58] testimony he wants to use our expression
[1:01:01] of our mouth our face our actions the
[1:01:04] way we dress how we conduct ourselves
[1:01:07] with the co-workers who who just
[1:01:10] slandered your name slandered your
[1:01:12] character hey that your school buddy
[1:01:15] said you were cheating well if you were
[1:01:16] cheating you need to go make it right
[1:01:18] but if you weren't you know just bear it
[1:01:20] you know like I I thank God for such an
[1:01:23] example that we can follow like brother
[1:01:25] Brandon you know we said oh you know uh
[1:01:28] they said he wasn't at the meeting and
[1:01:29] he's back there behind you know but he
[1:01:33] he's not going to destroy the man and
[1:01:35] his character he held his peace we have
[1:01:38] power to hold our
[1:01:41] peace we have power to speak the truth
[1:01:44] in
[1:01:45] love amen but we want to be in the
[1:01:47] spirit so when he comes upon us it's him
[1:01:51] speaking I'm tired of me speaking I want
[1:01:54] God to
[1:01:56] speak cuz you know as we know that our
[1:02:00] minds we've been feeding on the word of
[1:02:03] God God has been ministering to us and
[1:02:07] the word is in our heart but like I like
[1:02:10] it how brother Billy brought it out we
[1:02:12] need God to come upon that word and
[1:02:14] anoint it so it can live
[1:02:22] amen man
[1:02:25] you know I was studying in perfect faith
[1:02:27] and then brother Billy jumps right in
[1:02:30] there and praise God I love
[1:02:33] it yeah just something out of uh perfect
[1:02:37] faith that I wanted to draw some
[1:02:38] attention to also is you
[1:02:41] know I believe that it's in
[1:02:47] um it was read this morning but just a
[1:02:49] little bit further in 39 he says now I
[1:02:51] want to get this now we the church has
[1:02:55] got to lift itself in the power of
[1:02:58] God how we are too close to the end now
[1:03:03] I believe the church is in a condition
[1:03:06] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:03:08] things to rub out some of the UN the
[1:03:10] make belief
[1:03:12] out and get into real something real
[1:03:16] see it's got to be something that you
[1:03:21] know and if if you say brother Brandon
[1:03:25] that isn't
[1:03:27] light I'm looking at it well how do you
[1:03:30] know that you could be wrong my sight
[1:03:34] has always declared to me that that was
[1:03:37] light see and that's the reason I
[1:03:39] believe those Visions CU it's always
[1:03:42] declared to be the truth cuz if it comes
[1:03:46] from the word then if it's he says it
[1:03:50] then that settles it and then it
[1:03:53] declares like that there's no guesswork
[1:03:56] it's going to
[1:03:58] be then you go beyond human
[1:04:03] thinking it's up into the realm of the
[1:04:06] Lord's
[1:04:08] thinking but when you're standing here
[1:04:11] just as he just as the branches produce
[1:04:15] the fruit that's in the vine see God
[1:04:19] uses man and man only God doesn't use
[1:04:23] machine
[1:04:25] God doesn't use groups of men God
[1:04:28] doesn't use
[1:04:29] organization God uses individuals always
[1:04:33] amen I love that because that includes
[1:04:36] everybody in here amen who's an
[1:04:38] individual in here hallelujah God uses
[1:04:42] individuals praise God our citizenship
[1:04:46] is not of this world each and every one
[1:04:49] of us have a part to play God wants to
[1:04:52] express Christ through your
[1:04:55] world
[1:04:58] right I certainly appreciated the word
[1:05:01] of the
[1:05:02] Lord amen you know I um I trust in the
[1:05:07] Lord will take the service completely
[1:05:10] into his hands because I've been
[1:05:12] battling something about a while of
[1:05:16] giving a little testimony but I just
[1:05:18] trust the Lord will help but I wanted to
[1:05:20] share this out of perfect Faith you know
[1:05:23] brother brandom sometimes it just seems
[1:05:25] so simple as he's kind of just
[1:05:27] introductory just talking and letting
[1:05:30] his heart just speaking you know and and
[1:05:33] all of a sudden God takes even just your
[1:05:36] natural course of life just your natural
[1:05:38] interactions with people and the world
[1:05:41] and different things it's already Christ
[1:05:43] bubbling up that Fountain it was already
[1:05:46] living out it's not just come to speak
[1:05:49] to you a a speech but he's declaring The
[1:05:52] Life of Christ
[1:05:54] amen and and it was also like Paul Paul
[1:05:59] said follow me as I followed Christ you
[1:06:03] know I just so love that
[1:06:06] and praise the
[1:06:11] Lord you know at the very introduction
[1:06:13] it says this in in paragraph 8 he says
[1:06:16] now many of you you were uh waiting over
[1:06:20] there till the morning and you've got a
[1:06:22] long distance to go and appreciate that
[1:06:25] some of you will drive tonight because
[1:06:27] you got to work by daylight in the
[1:06:30] morning I know that's hard how many's
[1:06:33] got to drive tonight got work you see
[1:06:36] you see the scripture how he identifies
[1:06:40] present don't think about just brother
[1:06:42] brandham so far away but God he's here
[1:06:45] he's telling you the same
[1:06:47] thing I know it's hard and then when I
[1:06:50] think and see see that you know I got
[1:06:54] spells too you know I get moody I get to
[1:06:57] a spot where what gets me is when I get
[1:07:01] to those spells when I get all
[1:07:03] overworked and Satan tells comes telling
[1:07:07] me why nobody cares for you you really
[1:07:10] haven't got a friend in the world
[1:07:14] see he's still the same Devil he's got
[1:07:18] the same tactic but we got the word of
[1:07:21] God faith in the word of God will
[1:07:23] overcome that
[1:07:26] devil
[1:07:28] remember I'm not immune to Temptation I
[1:07:31] love it how he's identifying that as a
[1:07:35] Temptation oh nobody cares for
[1:07:40] you oh
[1:07:42] my my praise God I love how he gives the
[1:07:47] remedy he gives the Cure against it he
[1:07:50] says remember I'm not immune to
[1:07:52] Temptation see I've got to to overcome
[1:07:54] that then when I look back and see like
[1:07:58] this and it puts it right back in his
[1:08:01] face and says what about that see he was
[1:08:04] given testimony amen he was given
[1:08:07] testimony and then he goes on and says
[1:08:09] another one he says like a certain
[1:08:11] friend of mine sitting here the clan
[1:08:14] doesn't believe in Divine Healing come
[1:08:18] to this young fellow recently and said
[1:08:20] that stuff that is just preaching there
[1:08:23] about Divine Healing there's nothing to
[1:08:26] it and this man lived in Kentucky right
[1:08:30] near this old woman and then the act
[1:08:33] acting cramp grounds so you know this uh
[1:08:36] I believe it was brother Ben you know he
[1:08:39] was playing tapes and believing and one
[1:08:41] day they felt to go up there
[1:08:44] and take this handkerchief and pray for
[1:08:47] them and you know it ca it came to be
[1:08:50] that this woman that she was going to
[1:08:52] die there was no hope for her and God
[1:08:55] raised her up and she's making like
[1:08:57] fried apple pies and she's you know and
[1:09:00] brother brandom saying see that put the
[1:09:02] devil to shame see that brought an
[1:09:05] encouragement to brother Brandon you
[1:09:08] know when the temp when the tempter
[1:09:10] comes to you and starts with this
[1:09:12] nonsense you just go back and see you
[1:09:14] count your blessings and she see how
[1:09:16] many times God was faithful to his word
[1:09:19] that'll put it to shame right back in
[1:09:21] the devil's face I'm here to put shame
[1:09:23] right back back in the devil's
[1:09:26] face you're your your life your
[1:09:29] individual life is to put the devil to
[1:09:32] shame he he said you ain't going to be
[1:09:35] nothing for God and now
[1:09:38] what now what there's a blood there's a
[1:09:43] promised
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] word but the devil to
[1:09:49] shame that's my
[1:09:52] business not not because anything I did
[1:09:55] but because what he said would happen in
[1:09:57] me and I've received it I've accepted it
[1:10:00] I believed on it and I've acted on
[1:10:03] it and God confirmed
[1:10:06] it I'm just a recipient amen that's what
[1:10:10] Amazing Grace
[1:10:11] is
[1:10:13] hallelujah praise the Lord I'm getting
[1:10:16] excited love the
[1:10:18] word you know if we just double back a
[1:10:21] little bit and say you know this this
[1:10:24] supplication I was I was pondering it
[1:10:26] because you know we want peace the peace
[1:10:29] of God to rule in our lives and you know
[1:10:32] if if you know Faith Masters all
[1:10:34] circumstances and and you know brother
[1:10:37] Bram said pray for Revelation and so
[1:10:40] part of what Paul was saying here and
[1:10:42] I'm I'm just was picking up on it you
[1:10:44] know this is a this is a requirement for
[1:10:48] the believer is to pray for Revelation
[1:10:51] and said not only pray for revelation
[1:10:53] but he says let your request be made
[1:10:56] known unto God you know sometimes we
[1:10:58] make our our petition known unto man you
[1:11:01] know what do you think I'm thinking and
[1:11:03] so we constantly sometimes we get
[1:11:06] frustrated because we're not going to
[1:11:08] God this says go to God make it known to
[1:11:12] God sometimes there's something that
[1:11:14] we're going through if we'll just make
[1:11:17] it known to
[1:11:18] God you know sometimes when you start
[1:11:21] sharing different things all of a sudden
[1:11:23] it's fueling the fire of the enemy
[1:11:26] against you it actually hurts your own
[1:11:30] faith we want to we want to let the
[1:11:33] power that God vested in us to control
[1:11:36] our tongue when it's time to be silent
[1:11:40] let's be silent when it's time to speak
[1:11:42] we'll
[1:11:45] speak so I just I was thinking about
[1:11:48] that supplication and I was searching
[1:11:51] you know what what did Brother Brandon
[1:11:53] say anything about this word
[1:11:54] supplication cuz well I want I want all
[1:11:57] of the word I want every bit of it don't
[1:11:59] you feel that way if there's something
[1:12:01] in the word I want
[1:12:03] it if it's because it's for me it's for
[1:12:07] you you're the individual that the word
[1:12:10] wants to manifest
[1:12:11] in amen you believe it's for you it is
[1:12:16] for you praise
[1:12:18] God one one uh commentator said this for
[1:12:21] the Latin translation says sub suppli
[1:12:24] care meaning to plead humbly
[1:12:27] supplication can also be summarized as a
[1:12:30] request to God in our request or
[1:12:34] supplication we must be wise to ask God
[1:12:37] for
[1:12:38] things that will truly enrich in our
[1:12:41] lives like wisdom strength health and
[1:12:44] love you know I just thought it was
[1:12:48] interesting the way that supplication
[1:12:51] was broke down in this was like Supply
[1:12:54] and Care together Supply and care you
[1:12:58] know and what a perversion someone would
[1:13:00] be um you know inspired by Commerce the
[1:13:05] God of this world you know Satan's Eden
[1:13:08] to call uh something that supplies
[1:13:11] everybody's needs every day they call it
[1:13:13] a Amazon but it's so close to amazing
[1:13:16] but you know what this supplication is
[1:13:19] not just for our needs but for our
[1:13:21] families for our burdens for our loved
[1:13:25] ones you know it's just suppli
[1:13:29] care my another commentator said
[1:13:32] supplication is prayer to
[1:13:35] God or a re respectful request to
[1:13:39] someone in Authority for help well I
[1:13:42] really like that one you know when you
[1:13:45] pray and you're going to God in
[1:13:46] supplication there's no higher authority
[1:13:50] than the word of God and God likes to
[1:13:53] hear his word
[1:13:59] amen and this also says he raises his
[1:14:03] arms as a gesture of
[1:14:06] Supplication the government has today
[1:14:09] resisted all supplication appeal prayer
[1:14:13] pleading I just thought that was neat
[1:14:16] you know it's really you know when
[1:14:18] you're desperate and you're Earnest like
[1:14:22] if you know it's life and
[1:14:23] death you you know someone got a gun
[1:14:26] you're going to raise your hands you
[1:14:28] know I just you know this is for me you
[1:14:30] know I just say sometimes you know we
[1:14:33] take prayer and supplication to
[1:14:35] haphazard you know and we value or
[1:14:39] esteem other things and I'm talking
[1:14:41] about me I'm just being honest from my
[1:14:43] heart you know and I'm just saying I'm
[1:14:46] letting my request be made known enough
[1:14:48] of that enough of that if if God can
[1:14:51] give me a revelation how power powerful
[1:14:53] prayer and supplication is giving thanks
[1:14:56] to God Amen then we can do what he said
[1:15:00] do but we have to lay aside other
[1:15:06] things prayer and supplication is prayer
[1:15:08] that lifts up request to God
[1:15:10] supplication is often divided between
[1:15:12] requests for ourselves petitions and the
[1:15:16] requests that are made on behalf of
[1:15:17] others intercession so we've been made
[1:15:20] Kings and Priests amen you I just love
[1:15:23] the word of God because you know every
[1:15:26] time we open the word of God it gives us
[1:15:28] Vision you know we need Vision to walk
[1:15:32] forward it's a lamp to our
[1:15:39] feet you know I just
[1:15:42] um I I'll share this little testimony
[1:15:45] and um Lord's
[1:15:47] really you know this week has just it's
[1:15:50] really been overwhelming to me how um
[1:15:54] you know it just I was reflecting back
[1:15:57] you know
[1:15:59] um back in 2000 or I'm sorry 1999 in
[1:16:04] January you know I gave my heart to the
[1:16:06] Lord and it was very um it was very
[1:16:11] painful time for me and um I had I had a
[1:16:15] friend that he he just was a worldly guy
[1:16:18] you know he's a drug dealer and he did
[1:16:20] all kinds of stuff not too far from here
[1:16:22] and you know it was that night and uh I
[1:16:26] ended up getting arrested for driving
[1:16:28] well intoxicated and and I'm not
[1:16:29] glorifying that situation but I'm saying
[1:16:32] this to testify of what God can do when
[1:16:37] you commit your life to his hands you
[1:16:40] know I'm like that woman that says I'm
[1:16:42] not what I
[1:16:44] was you
[1:16:46] know it's so wonderful and so you know
[1:16:49] we we we look back to see this is all
[1:16:53] been God's hand in our lives the entire
[1:16:55] time you know I'm I'm s in the drunk
[1:16:59] tank overnight here in Bedford in this
[1:17:01] old he was like 90 years old he was like
[1:17:03] some Methodist Minister he came out and
[1:17:05] he said you know he was talking with the
[1:17:07] guy across the way and I was sitting on
[1:17:08] the bunk and you know just regretting a
[1:17:11] lot of my choices and just seeing my
[1:17:13] condition how I was I didn't want to
[1:17:15] live you know I I didn't have no hope I
[1:17:18] didn't have no vision and so as I was
[1:17:20] pondering that and you know I was
[1:17:24] thinking you know uh what is this guy
[1:17:26] talking about he's talking to some guy
[1:17:28] and there was just two cells you know
[1:17:29] it's not just a little city jail
[1:17:31] whatever and so um he turned and looked
[1:17:35] at me and I I jumped off the the bunk
[1:17:37] and I started walking over to him and
[1:17:40] and I was like you know you know I just
[1:17:42] had a lot of Shame you know like how
[1:17:43] could I let this be and so he ended up
[1:17:47] saying he goes you know there's a lot of
[1:17:48] people that find God in these places and
[1:17:50] I just you know in my heart you know it
[1:17:52] was what I needed to hear at that time
[1:17:54] you know and and God knows what you need
[1:17:57] to hear tonight amen you know and and
[1:18:01] what that caused was a chain reaction of
[1:18:03] things in my life it caused
[1:18:06] opportunities to rise where I really I
[1:18:09] didn't want to but at that time what he
[1:18:11] said had such an impact on me because I
[1:18:14] had a lot of questions and I had a lot
[1:18:16] of fears and doubts and you know it
[1:18:19] caused me to start looking
[1:18:21] inside you know if you if you really
[1:18:25] give yourself time and quiet your own
[1:18:28] Spirit quiet your own thoughts and your
[1:18:30] own mind and you get along with God you
[1:18:32] get along with God somewhere you know
[1:18:35] what the first thing you're going to
[1:18:36] come in contact with your
[1:18:39] heart and if you're a sinner it's
[1:18:42] darkness and it's scary to to see what
[1:18:45] you become to see the kind of person
[1:18:49] that you didn't want to be that you
[1:18:51] didn't want to do do all of those things
[1:18:54] but you couldn't help it you were born
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] way you were under a
[1:19:01] sentence you were separated from God and
[1:19:04] you come into that condition and so I I
[1:19:08] I found within me that I said I could
[1:19:10] not live this way
[1:19:11] anymore something something must be
[1:19:15] different and so it set me on a course
[1:19:17] of searching out what is truth you know
[1:19:21] and and I began to do what they call
[1:19:24] soul
[1:19:28] searching and so as I was journeying
[1:19:30] through that you know someone said you
[1:19:33] know hey you know cuz I thought oh yeah
[1:19:35] you're an alcoholic and this is your
[1:19:37] problem it's an incurable disease and oh
[1:19:40] that's the answer that's why I'm so you
[1:19:43] know under this oppression and I can't
[1:19:45] get Victory and I'm because now I know
[1:19:48] this is and so that went on for a season
[1:19:51] but when they're going through through
[1:19:53] and they telling me that these steps
[1:19:54] that you must take are biblically Bas
[1:19:56] stepped I'm like why go through the
[1:19:58] middleman let me just go directly to the
[1:20:01] man so I'm like wait a minute if you're
[1:20:03] taking and pulling and saying this and
[1:20:05] that why don't I just go directly to it
[1:20:08] the source and so as I began to read it
[1:20:10] I'm like wait a minute oh my goodness
[1:20:12] and so now I had to go back and make
[1:20:14] these things that I did where I hurt
[1:20:16] people I did things that wrong I lied I
[1:20:20] stole that things that Sinners do
[1:20:23] and so then I was like wait a minute so
[1:20:25] one of the things that just became so
[1:20:27] hard for me to see is how I needed even
[1:20:31] though I felt a right to be angry at my
[1:20:33] dad which my mom and dad separated when
[1:20:35] I was like three months and I have never
[1:20:37] met my dad and so at that time I felt
[1:20:40] Justified yeah if I ever see him if he's
[1:20:42] still alive and now I'm 22 years old at
[1:20:45] that time I'm just going to let him know
[1:20:47] what I really think and then maybe I'll
[1:20:50] hug him but I was really because I
[1:20:53] didn't know like everything in life
[1:20:56] seemed to be oh you're the reason you're
[1:20:58] the reason I don't have this and I don't
[1:21:00] have that or I don't have these
[1:21:02] opportunities because of this situation
[1:21:04] that I'm
[1:21:05] under and you know that God began to
[1:21:09] deal with my heart and so as I as I I
[1:21:13] begin to realize you
[1:21:15] know you I like how brother brother
[1:21:17] Matthew said in his sermon he said I
[1:21:19] want Victory amen don't you want victory
[1:21:23] and that's what that's where I was in my
[1:21:24] heart I said I want Victory and whatever
[1:21:26] it
[1:21:27] takes let me search through cuz I don't
[1:21:30] want to be bound by anything that I've
[1:21:32] done in Life or anything that I'm
[1:21:34] thinking in my heart wrong Lord and so
[1:21:37] all of a sudden I realized you know what
[1:21:39] the Lord moved on my heart and said you
[1:21:40] know what we go to the to the internet
[1:21:43] and at that time it was just kind of
[1:21:44] launching out but I I bought this little
[1:21:47] service for you know finding people and
[1:21:49] I paid the fee and and I thought well
[1:21:51] maybe he's alive I need to you know see
[1:21:53] if he's alive at least maybe I can you
[1:21:56] know make contact with him I don't know
[1:21:58] but I'm just praying about it because
[1:22:00] one of the things they told me like if
[1:22:01] you're going to make amends or if you're
[1:22:03] going to do something don't do it just
[1:22:05] to get it off your chest and then you're
[1:22:07] free from it because you got to consider
[1:22:09] the other party you don't go and just
[1:22:11] tell them a and now you're delivered but
[1:22:13] it puts them in bondage and they want to
[1:22:14] take their own life that's not the right
[1:22:17] approach so what I did was I I I found
[1:22:20] his I'm like whoa he still lives in the
[1:22:22] same place where I was born and what
[1:22:24] he's a lot you know and so I wrote his
[1:22:26] number down his address and I put it in
[1:22:28] an envelope or I put it in a little
[1:22:30] piece of paper in my wallet and I was
[1:22:32] praying about it and I wanted I knew
[1:22:36] that I needed to do this because in my
[1:22:38] heart it was still I had bitterness
[1:22:40] towards it I had bondage but I wanted to
[1:22:42] be free and so I was asking the Lord I
[1:22:44] said Lord I don't want it to be me I
[1:22:46] want it to be you
[1:22:49] amen and so I held that in my wallet for
[1:22:52] almost two
[1:22:53] years and so one day uh in 2002 and this
[1:22:57] is around Christmas couple days before I
[1:23:00] was reading in the scripture and we'll
[1:23:02] just turn there and just see what the
[1:23:04] Lord has for us but the scripture I
[1:23:06] believe is in uh in
[1:23:09] Mark we were just there
[1:23:14] but Mark chap
[1:23:17] 11 and so as I was reading this
[1:23:21] scripture
[1:23:24] and I'll read it there in verse 22 it
[1:23:27] looks like U where we'll begin but it
[1:23:29] says Jesus answered saying unto them
[1:23:32] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[1:23:35] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:23:39] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:23:42] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:23:45] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:23:48] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:23:52] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:23:56] therefore I say unto you what things
[1:23:58] soever you desire When you pray believe
[1:24:02] that ye receive them and ye shall have
[1:24:05] them and when ye stand praying
[1:24:09] forgive if you have ought against any
[1:24:12] that your father which also which is in
[1:24:15] heaven May forgive you your
[1:24:18] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:24:20] neither will your father which is in
[1:24:22] heaven Heaven forgive your
[1:24:24] trespasses you know and I think that you
[1:24:27] know when I was there you know when I
[1:24:29] gave my heart to the Lord I I um the
[1:24:33] Lord was so gracious to um around six
[1:24:37] months after that or a year I had a
[1:24:40] friend named Shane and he was testifying
[1:24:42] to me and so I started going to his
[1:24:43] church and so I'd been going to church
[1:24:45] for years um up to this point maybe two
[1:24:49] years and as I was reading that
[1:24:51] scripture though the the Lord put that
[1:24:53] burden on my heart you know and and I it
[1:24:57] it brought like a like in my heart I I I
[1:25:02] knew that he had already forgive me and
[1:25:05] it was so weird now I'm challenged in
[1:25:07] another way you know aren't you thankful
[1:25:10] that God wants to challenge
[1:25:12] you he he wants you to be all that he
[1:25:16] spoke of
[1:25:18] you he's gonna express it amen and so as
[1:25:21] I was I was there pondering this I'm
[1:25:24] like wait a minute how is this
[1:25:27] saying I won't be forgiven since I'm
[1:25:29] already forgiven but then I realized now
[1:25:33] God wanting to free me amen and this was
[1:25:36] the hour this was the moment and so when
[1:25:39] it dawned on me I must act on the word
[1:25:43] of God I just pulled that out of my
[1:25:45] phone out of my wallet picked up the
[1:25:48] phone and I made the call you know and
[1:25:52] and I didn't have time to ponder too
[1:25:55] much what because I've had a lifetime of
[1:25:57] wondering if he was alive or what and so
[1:26:01] when I when I got an answer on the other
[1:26:03] end and I told him who I was and you
[1:26:06] know it just it was a moment that you
[1:26:10] know I it's just hard to express but it
[1:26:13] was it was a blessing and so from that
[1:26:16] time I told him I said you know I'm a
[1:26:19] Christian he said I just told him I said
[1:26:21] I don't need to know all the stuff that
[1:26:23] would happen between you and my mom but
[1:26:25] I want you to know that I'm a Christian
[1:26:28] and I had bitterness in my
[1:26:30] heart and and I had unforgiveness
[1:26:33] because I couldn't understand but I want
[1:26:35] you to know that the Lord's given me
[1:26:37] peace over this and I'm letting you know
[1:26:39] now that the door is wide open if you
[1:26:42] want to have fellowship or relationship
[1:26:44] with me I I have nothing hindering that
[1:26:46] and so you know I believe that that did
[1:26:50] something for me and and opening the
[1:26:52] door I think could do something for him
[1:26:55] but I'm not trying to control what's the
[1:26:57] outcome of it and so as I'm praying and
[1:26:59] then you know I find out that I have a
[1:27:02] sister and two other brothers and I'm
[1:27:04] just like you know the like sometimes in
[1:27:07] life you know you if you've never known
[1:27:10] your father you could have like a lot of
[1:27:14] people say well you know you do that
[1:27:16] just like your father and you'd be like
[1:27:18] I don't understand what do you mean how
[1:27:21] is it that I'm doing and acting in a
[1:27:23] certain way when I've never seen him do
[1:27:25] that or watched him do that but you know
[1:27:29] that's what the scripture says let every
[1:27:30] seed bring forth after its own kind its
[1:27:33] likeness and image so now God began to
[1:27:35] deal with my heart after that because I
[1:27:38] obeyed the word of God God began to say
[1:27:41] to me speaking back to me I'm your
[1:27:44] father you see as isn't it wonderful
[1:27:47] God's looking for
[1:27:48] obedience God wants you to do what he
[1:27:51] said do do without conditions like God
[1:27:55] if you do this then you know I'm or or
[1:27:58] God if I do this I want you you know
[1:28:00] it's like uh we ain't going to put God's
[1:28:03] hand in no no shackles you know he'll do
[1:28:06] exactly what he said but the timing's up
[1:28:09] to him and so as I you know I begin to
[1:28:13] realize you know hey I want to have
[1:28:16] fellowship with my dad and um finding
[1:28:18] out that I had the sister and everything
[1:28:20] like that was kind of exciting but you
[1:28:22] know they live in Utah and I hadn't been
[1:28:24] to Utah since I was you know born and so
[1:28:27] anyway we ended up uh you
[1:28:30] know maybe within a short time six
[1:28:32] months or something I I made a call one
[1:28:35] time to talk to him and and the current
[1:28:37] wife you know who they'd been married
[1:28:39] like like basically the entire time
[1:28:42] except maybe four or five years when I
[1:28:43] was four or five years old so he said he
[1:28:45] waited but then he got married so
[1:28:47] anyway I I was on the other line with
[1:28:50] her and she said something to the effect
[1:28:53] that made me feel like I might have um
[1:28:58] like my interactions may have stirred
[1:29:00] something and so I didn't know how to
[1:29:02] take that and so I just kind of backed
[1:29:04] off like I don't I don't want to upset
[1:29:06] things you know and this is like 20
[1:29:08] years ago and so you know as I was going
[1:29:12] through that and and realizing like you
[1:29:14] know you can imagine somebody and I know
[1:29:17] there's people here that maybe their
[1:29:19] father's passed away or they don't know
[1:29:21] their father and similar way but um you
[1:29:24] know it's interesting that you
[1:29:27] know like like I I had one picture that
[1:29:30] I can look and say oh that's my father
[1:29:33] you know but I would never know because
[1:29:35] I only had the picture I never talked to
[1:29:37] him and I never was able to ask him
[1:29:39] questions or anything like that in
[1:29:40] person but one day I wanted to come face
[1:29:43] to face with him you know it wasn't it
[1:29:46] wasn't the man it was the life in the
[1:29:49] man and so as I I was beginning ending
[1:29:52] you know to desire this and you know it
[1:29:56] wasn't too long ago that um Brother
[1:29:58] David preached a message called you know
[1:30:02] our fellowship is with the
[1:30:03] father and it was on Father's
[1:30:06] Day and you know it it's interesting uh
[1:30:11] for me because I had never met my father
[1:30:13] face to face and so after he preached
[1:30:16] that the Lord began to deal with my
[1:30:18] heart and and um you know just the time
[1:30:22] in the season it seemed very difficult
[1:30:24] to to um to
[1:30:27] bypass and just take up for Utah and and
[1:30:31] to go visit him and I you know without
[1:30:33] getting too much in the details because
[1:30:35] it would take a while but I would have
[1:30:37] to say this that that we ended up doing
[1:30:40] that and um you know what was so special
[1:30:43] to me is you know just like the faith of
[1:30:46] Abraham you know he waited so many years
[1:30:50] but he held on to the promise promise
[1:30:52] because he believed that God was
[1:30:55] able you know and
[1:30:58] so I
[1:31:00] um we we were able to connect like even
[1:31:04] even I'll say it like this even after
[1:31:07] Brother David preached that message on
[1:31:09] Father's Day it was like I went home
[1:31:13] that night and I called him because you
[1:31:16] know it was it was so awesome brother
[1:31:17] David talking about his father and
[1:31:19] saying how he was part of the the the
[1:31:21] teachers union and things like that he
[1:31:24] he said he began to understand a little
[1:31:25] bit more about himself as he saw his his
[1:31:28] father and the way he did things and
[1:31:29] things like that and I love it how those
[1:31:31] things are just so natural typing the
[1:31:33] spiritual like you there's things that
[1:31:35] you do that the faith of God in you is
[1:31:39] moving God is moving in you sometimes
[1:31:43] Faith just is so subconscious or
[1:31:45] unconscious to your own thinking but if
[1:31:47] we'll just let the love of God that we
[1:31:51] have for the word of of God move on us
[1:31:53] amen that's what we want and so I went
[1:31:56] home and I talked to him and you know
[1:31:58] it's amazing I spent the next uh like
[1:32:02] almost 4 hours it was like 1:00 in the
[1:32:04] morning we we still going to go on it
[1:32:07] was so amazing you know what's
[1:32:09] comforting to me sometimes if there's
[1:32:12] something going on in your life with the
[1:32:14] relationship a lot of times you have
[1:32:16] your idea and why people are doing
[1:32:19] certain things but but my heart became
[1:32:22] burdened for him because like his
[1:32:25] upbringing was
[1:32:27] terrible and um it it really it you know
[1:32:32] like they say if it doesn't matter how
[1:32:35] thin you slice it there's always two
[1:32:36] sides to every situation and so as I
[1:32:39] began to realize like his condition his
[1:32:42] situation wow with what he had up
[1:32:45] against him he was in no position to
[1:32:48] raise children and so you know my heart
[1:32:51] became burdened and I was I was
[1:32:53] realizing that God's dealing with my
[1:32:56] heart by a burden and I wanted
[1:32:58] fellowship with my father because now I
[1:33:01] realize God's in
[1:33:03] it the moment that something starts
[1:33:06] dealing with your heart God's in
[1:33:08] it right now I'm not talking about your
[1:33:11] head or your emotion I'm talking about
[1:33:13] your
[1:33:14] heart when you have the truth in your
[1:33:17] heart and God begins to move on your
[1:33:19] heart and you know you can tie it back
[1:33:21] to the word of God then you know God's
[1:33:24] on the scene amen now but we're in that
[1:33:28] that great Crossroads what are you going
[1:33:30] to do about it like he showed his care
[1:33:32] for you now can you show your care back
[1:33:36] it's like he loved me he saved me he did
[1:33:39] this for me I know that gives me
[1:33:42] confidence that he wants to use me
[1:33:45] sometimes we're like there you want to
[1:33:46] use me there like man it's going to be
[1:33:49] nerve-wracking going and visiting him
[1:33:52] and all of that what could that be like
[1:33:55] how is it going to feel like but casting
[1:33:57] down
[1:33:59] reason when God puts a burden on your
[1:34:01] heart and by faith you're moving forward
[1:34:04] God will meet you there and you'll have
[1:34:06] boldness in that moment and so that was
[1:34:09] what we recently did is we went and
[1:34:11] visited him and I could say much about
[1:34:14] it but one thing I'll say is you know I
[1:34:18] thank God for the message because it has
[1:34:20] changed me I couldn't imagine if when I
[1:34:22] first got saved and and the Lord really
[1:34:26] started you know getting saved is to
[1:34:29] take you out of
[1:34:30] sin to take you out of the bondage of
[1:34:33] sin to where you can believe God and
[1:34:36] manifest the word of
[1:34:38] God right because before when you're a
[1:34:40] sinner you just you didn't believe you
[1:34:43] had that Amnesia oh I'm I'm just you
[1:34:46] know I'm just 4 foot six or whatever but
[1:34:50] no there was a life inside of you that
[1:34:53] can come to life
[1:34:55] amen so I thank God that we were able to
[1:34:58] go and you know I I um I was able to
[1:35:02] talk to him and and find out many things
[1:35:05] and and visit with family and and and
[1:35:09] like I said I'm thankful that I didn't
[1:35:12] necessarily jump to the occasion because
[1:35:15] you know God promised a restoration of
[1:35:17] the brid tree and you know unless the
[1:35:21] seed is planted this this seed the
[1:35:25] sewing seed rain the teaching rain you
[1:35:28] know how is someone going to see the
[1:35:29] fruit of it it's so important that we
[1:35:33] pray for Revelation but we go and hear
[1:35:35] the word of
[1:35:37] God because now it's like I go and I'm
[1:35:40] fellowshipping with him and I'm talking
[1:35:42] to him and I mean he's he's a he's a
[1:35:45] college professor of of Theology and
[1:35:48] they're you know latterday Saints Mormon
[1:35:51] and things like that but you know that
[1:35:53] doesn't shake me because I know what we
[1:35:56] have it's the real genuine product and
[1:36:00] it the fruit of it there's people it
[1:36:02] doesn't matter what bondage they're in
[1:36:04] they want to partake in something that's
[1:36:06] real something that's that's food in
[1:36:10] season and so as we were fellowshipping
[1:36:12] I I just you know I was able to share a
[1:36:14] few things and you know at the end of it
[1:36:16] when we left Utah and this was you know
[1:36:18] not too long ago when we were gone but
[1:36:21] it it was amazing that my uh one of my
[1:36:24] half Brothers the one that I got to meet
[1:36:27] he was we were saying our goodbyes and
[1:36:30] um he said you know he said you know the
[1:36:34] way that your family is how they are and
[1:36:37] and your wife and you know he said it's
[1:36:41] a real Testament to me and and I'll just
[1:36:45] say this so you can kind of understand
[1:36:47] where he's coming from you know he was
[1:36:49] raised Mormon and recently he you know
[1:36:52] my sister Rachel was saying you know
[1:36:55] John's not in church anymore he's he's
[1:36:57] away from the church and he's and he
[1:36:59] even told me he's like I don't even know
[1:37:01] where my faith is I don't even know what
[1:37:02] I believe and so you you talk about the
[1:37:06] Life of Christ on display and I'm not
[1:37:09] lifting up anything but I'm lifting up
[1:37:11] the word and the what God said he would
[1:37:14] do the works that he would perform he's
[1:37:17] doing it am so if you got doubt about
[1:37:20] your experience you know what just wait
[1:37:23] a while he'll confirm it to you that all
[1:37:26] this time all of this time as you're
[1:37:30] feeding as you're praying God he's going
[1:37:34] to use your testimony
[1:37:37] amen so we were really rejoicing knowing
[1:37:42] that you know the the gospel is
[1:37:46] effectual you know the fruit of this
[1:37:48] message will make a difference in so and
[1:37:51] else's life so just be faithful to
[1:37:54] continue to pray and let your requests
[1:37:57] be made known you know it's just so
[1:38:00] important and I'll just say this
[1:38:03] and I don't know how much time we've
[1:38:06] been here clock's wrong here I don't
[1:38:10] know I want I wanted to read you this
[1:38:13] portion of a message called believest
[1:38:16] thou this and brother brandom made this
[1:38:18] statement and it's a little bit few um
[1:38:22] paragraphs but I think this will help us
[1:38:25] and so we'll go ahead and read this it
[1:38:27] says now when Jesus said to the tree in
[1:38:31] Mark 11:23 no man eateth from thee from
[1:38:35] henceforth he might not have yelled it
[1:38:38] out why as
[1:38:40] frankly he was so easy about it till his
[1:38:44] disciples just I think one of them heard
[1:38:46] him and it when when that epileptic when
[1:38:50] it came up before the Lord Jesus the boy
[1:38:53] had the hardest fit he ever had perhaps
[1:38:55] fell on the
[1:38:57] ground like he was dead but he realized
[1:39:01] that he met someone who had Faith far
[1:39:05] above those
[1:39:06] Apostles now I like for someone that
[1:39:10] didn't believe in Divine Healing to
[1:39:12] watch this Jesus had given them power to
[1:39:15] cast out to cast the spirit out the
[1:39:19] spirits out and they had failed not the
[1:39:23] power had failed but they had failed
[1:39:26] Jesus told them why couldn't we cast
[1:39:30] them out he said because of your
[1:39:32] unbelief the church still has a power
[1:39:37] God has never taken the power from the
[1:39:39] church but the church don't have enough
[1:39:43] Faith to act upon it yes that's all it's
[1:39:47] just that simple we try to make it so
[1:39:50] complic licated sometimes but the more
[1:39:53] simple you make the gospel the more
[1:39:56] reality you'll have amen oh I love that
[1:39:59] that's medicine amen that's right when
[1:40:02] you just get real simple with it God
[1:40:06] said so and that settles it that's all
[1:40:08] and just believe it and go ahead when
[1:40:10] Jesus said no man eat from thee why the
[1:40:13] leaves were still pretty bright and as
[1:40:15] they ever was the bark looked the same
[1:40:18] but why way down in the ground in those
[1:40:22] roots the life begin to dwindle away so
[1:40:25] it is upon a cancer or upon any kind of
[1:40:29] disease that that you might want to
[1:40:33] think when you can accept the word of
[1:40:36] God way down in The Roots the cancer may
[1:40:39] be there your hand may be just as stiff
[1:40:42] it don't have anything to do with Divine
[1:40:44] Healing if you can't believe see way
[1:40:47] down somewhere it's already done the
[1:40:50] work
[1:40:51] it's already gone to work yes sir amen
[1:40:54] Jesus said if you say to this mountain
[1:40:57] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:41:00] but believe that what you say will come
[1:41:03] to pass you can have what you say isn't
[1:41:07] that
[1:41:09] lovely who' who'd that come from the Son
[1:41:12] of God whose words Heaven and Earth will
[1:41:16] pass away but his word won't now the
[1:41:20] only way that you can do
[1:41:22] that now this is important now the only
[1:41:26] way that you can do that is you've got
[1:41:27] to have the right objective and the
[1:41:29] right motive now if I want now if I went
[1:41:34] out here and said I'll show you I can
[1:41:37] move this mountain be moved Mountain it
[1:41:42] will never move certainly not no matter
[1:41:45] what I had it's got to be first you got
[1:41:49] to find the will of God
[1:41:51] God and that's the reason usually in the
[1:41:54] prayer
[1:41:55] lines it gets very hard and because
[1:41:59] sometimes that's went through the lines
[1:42:01] and so forth and we're we get it back
[1:42:04] you see if you've gotten confess
[1:42:08] sin did you ever notice on a Case before
[1:42:11] I
[1:42:12] asked the evil spirit to leave I watch
[1:42:16] the case real sure to be certain that
[1:42:19] there's nothing in the life that would
[1:42:21] hinder anything see because remember all
[1:42:25] these gifts you can get in trouble with
[1:42:27] them you know I just think that's that's
[1:42:29] a cautionary thing you know just to let
[1:42:32] our Christian experience be from the
[1:42:34] heart you know we have things we want
[1:42:36] from God we're making our requests known
[1:42:38] but if there's things in our heart let's
[1:42:41] deal with that first
[1:42:43] amen if you don't doubt in your heart
[1:42:46] you can ask whatsoever you may have amen
[1:42:55] continuing there it
[1:42:57] says God you remember one time gave a
[1:43:01] prophet made the prophet out of a man
[1:43:03] Moses and told him to go down and speak
[1:43:06] to the Rock and that Prophet was all
[1:43:09] excited and he went out and smote The
[1:43:11] Rock speaking of the weakness of
[1:43:13] Christ that he had to Die the second
[1:43:16] time and Smit it the second time he had
[1:43:19] power to bring it but it wasn't the will
[1:43:21] of
[1:43:23] God I never could believe that it was
[1:43:26] God's will that Elijah would go around
[1:43:28] and cause them children was teasing him
[1:43:31] about being baldheaded I don't think he
[1:43:34] should have done
[1:43:36] it but he was a prophet and he was angry
[1:43:41] and he put a curse on those children and
[1:43:43] those two she bears in killed 42 little
[1:43:46] innocent children but I don't believe he
[1:43:48] should have done it and it just before
[1:43:52] we put his power in his church he tries
[1:43:56] his church to see what it'll
[1:43:58] do oh I love it you know you know that
[1:44:02] when you're going through a trial you
[1:44:04] know that's the hand of God to a son or
[1:44:07] daughter of God Amen so so if you're not
[1:44:10] in a trial right
[1:44:12] now and you're a Son of God hello
[1:44:15] somebody it's
[1:44:17] coming it's
[1:44:19] coming
[1:44:21] God tries his church to see what it'll
[1:44:24] do you have the
[1:44:26] power and sometimes God's waned to give
[1:44:29] you this Faith but now what he wants is
[1:44:32] to see a character that reflects his
[1:44:37] character is this your will we know if
[1:44:41] it's his will we can have confidence
[1:44:43] that we can have it now this is
[1:44:49] mine
[1:44:56] but if if you'll just speak the word and
[1:44:59] say Lord I believe it don't doubt mean
[1:45:02] it in your heart now say for instance I
[1:45:06] was in a valley and I don't I'm
[1:45:08] preaching to millions of people but just
[1:45:12] across the mountain here is a group of
[1:45:15] people of 100 and they are dying without
[1:45:19] Christ well
[1:45:21] I've got a million here to preach to but
[1:45:24] yet something in my heart's telling me
[1:45:27] get across to those people get to them
[1:45:31] they're
[1:45:32] perishing I don't want to go myself but
[1:45:35] yet there's something in me is there
[1:45:37] something in
[1:45:40] you now listen to the reasoning the
[1:45:44] rational you you the devil's got his
[1:45:47] narrative to you why not to do what's in
[1:45:49] your heart
[1:45:58] see that's when God moving see what the
[1:46:02] objective
[1:46:04] is see what your
[1:46:06] motive is of going not for self now if I
[1:46:11] say well if my objective is right and
[1:46:14] get over there but then I get there and
[1:46:18] there's this big mountain I say if you
[1:46:21] know if I get over that mountain and
[1:46:23] save all those hundred people someday
[1:46:26] they'll have a statue there brother
[1:46:28] brand I'm a great missionary now my
[1:46:31] motive is not right that Mo that
[1:46:33] mountain won't fall no sir but when my
[1:46:37] motive and objective is right and God in
[1:46:40] my heart is leading me I can't get over
[1:46:44] the mountain around the mountain Under
[1:46:46] the Mountain I say mountain move amen
[1:46:51] maybe it when when I said when I say
[1:46:54] that no more than I say it with all the
[1:46:56] kinds of the right Spirit leading of the
[1:46:59] holy spirit in the will of God there
[1:47:02] might not be but one little spoonful of
[1:47:05] that mountain drop down but it's on its
[1:47:11] Road the next day there might be two
[1:47:13] pounds fall the next day a quarter of a
[1:47:16] ton and then maybe in a month five tons
[1:47:19] drop in what of it may not even see it
[1:47:23] yet but she's moving it's on the road
[1:47:27] it'll stay right there and watch the
[1:47:29] thing be done because God said so and
[1:47:32] that just settles
[1:47:35] it can you think that about your mother
[1:47:38] here tonight all right if you'll think
[1:47:41] it she'll get well all right that's if
[1:47:45] you just believe just speak the word and
[1:47:48] say stay with it just believe it hang on
[1:47:51] to it it's eternal life I think that's
[1:47:54] so special you know I I love it how he
[1:47:58] says that you know and and I don't want
[1:48:00] to just put this back and say you know
[1:48:03] brother Brandon was talking to them but
[1:48:04] I believe the Lord's talking to us we
[1:48:07] all have mothers
[1:48:09] here you know he says can you think that
[1:48:12] about your mother here tonight how many
[1:48:15] has a know that your mother has a need
[1:48:17] tonight I know my mother has a need
[1:48:21] you know and I'll say this about you
[1:48:22] know I was I was going out to
[1:48:26] to you know in my heart I wanted to do
[1:48:28] the will of the Lord I wanted it to be
[1:48:31] you know because I believe God's the god
[1:48:32] of restoration but I wasn't trying to
[1:48:34] figure out what the outcome was going to
[1:48:36] be in all that I just simply had it on
[1:48:38] my heart and I know that when God works
[1:48:40] by the heart he's got miraculous things
[1:48:42] that are going to happen and so when I
[1:48:45] came back and I I was able to to talk to
[1:48:48] my mom and little did I know I was
[1:48:51] sharing with her that I was able to go
[1:48:53] and the whole family was able to meet my
[1:48:55] dad and and uh some of the you know I
[1:48:58] really believe that it broke bondage off
[1:49:00] my mom and it was one of those
[1:49:02] unforeseen blessings and so I wanted to
[1:49:05] say that and and to say this you know
[1:49:08] when you are obedient to the word of God
[1:49:12] when he tugs on your heart to do
[1:49:13] something in doing it there is people
[1:49:17] that will see it it'll bring a light and
[1:49:19] it'll bring Deliverance
[1:49:21] so don't just think that Deliverance
[1:49:23] comes when people come up to be prayed
[1:49:25] for on the altar or if they jump in the
[1:49:28] service and there's Victory but when you
[1:49:30] do the will of God when you know to do
[1:49:33] the will of God and you do it it can
[1:49:35] bring Deliverance for those who are
[1:49:37] watching you that's right you're the
[1:49:39] individual that God wants to bring to
[1:49:42] pass this word of God Amen you believe
[1:49:46] it you spoke it by his stripes I'm
[1:49:48] Healed you hold hold on to the Word of
[1:49:51] Promise cuzz God can't fail he can't lie
[1:49:55] he he's it's on the road you might have
[1:49:57] only seen a drop of sand fall from that
[1:49:59] mountain maybe you even haven't seen
[1:50:02] that much but God can't lie even greater
[1:50:05] a miracle Our Father Abraham he Sarah
[1:50:08] you feel any different no God's still
[1:50:11] more than
[1:50:13] able we don't want to lower our sights
[1:50:17] based on circumstance
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:21] praise the Lord I don't know how long
[1:50:22] I've been but trust that the Lord's
[1:50:25] blessing you Sunday night praise the
[1:50:28] Lord is God good bring the rain it was
[1:50:30] in my heart too I'm like Lord the
[1:50:32] farmers
[1:50:34] my they they want us to eat out of tubes
[1:50:36] and paste and we need some we need some
[1:50:40] rain praise the
[1:50:45] Lord you know if we can just go back to
[1:50:48] Mark 11 here I'll just try to
[1:50:50] close up but you know it that scripture
[1:50:53] just really struck me and if if I could
[1:50:55] share what the Lord put on my heart
[1:50:57] about that scripture I just thought you
[1:50:59] know we want to be like like whatever
[1:51:03] you say whosoever shall say and it be
[1:51:07] from the heart of faith brother Brandon
[1:51:10] preached a message I believe it was
[1:51:12] called believe from the heart and within
[1:51:14] that he gave testimony about when the
[1:51:17] lord gave the vision about the Woods
[1:51:18] Brothers and how they were to go out and
[1:51:21] one day they were going to it was going
[1:51:22] to be nothing no fishing you know and
[1:51:25] and and then the next day they were
[1:51:27] going to get all of these catfish they
[1:51:29] were going to cat and and these were
[1:51:30] Jehovah's Witness right and so you know
[1:51:33] it it was the leading of the Lord you
[1:51:35] know and so as they were out there
[1:51:37] fishing and you know they came to that
[1:51:40] spot where I I believe I don't know if
[1:51:43] it was Banks but one of the boys they
[1:51:45] they pulled the the fish out too hard
[1:51:47] and it pulled out all of his um inro and
[1:51:50] and all of a sudden the one said oh you
[1:51:52] shot your last wad that was it for him
[1:51:55] and so as they were talking and
[1:51:58] testifying one of the one of the boys
[1:52:01] you know he just said you know I you
[1:52:03] know it would be so good you know that
[1:52:07] that that woman that used to care for us
[1:52:09] when we were little for her to know that
[1:52:11] we're serving God now and and brother
[1:52:14] brandham said that word found favor with
[1:52:18] God hallelujah that word them thinking
[1:52:21] of somebody else somebody that impacted
[1:52:24] their lives when they were a young
[1:52:26] person if they I want to I want someone
[1:52:30] else to know the power of God that has
[1:52:33] transformed this
[1:52:36] life you know I was like I was like a
[1:52:40] tree that couldn't bear the fruit what
[1:52:42] was in my
[1:52:43] heart right but one day one day God
[1:52:48] overshadowed that seed brought it to
[1:52:51] life and it was through testimony amen
[1:52:54] we're Witnesses of his majesty and so I
[1:52:57] just thought you know that brother
[1:53:00] brandham said that that kind of it
[1:53:03] brought an
[1:53:04] atmosphere that the word could drop on
[1:53:07] brother brandom's heart and he can speak
[1:53:09] yes that's what we want to do we know
[1:53:13] that we've
[1:53:14] been spoken over that we're living in an
[1:53:18] hour of the third pool
[1:53:20] you know squirrels
[1:53:22] manifested right but I I I so thank God
[1:53:25] that you know God's ways of doing that
[1:53:29] are so far beyond our ability to
[1:53:31] comprehend it has to be a
[1:53:33] revelation you know and even another
[1:53:36] place I believe brother Brandon was
[1:53:37] saying you know about telling those
[1:53:39] those men they were oil guys and he said
[1:53:41] hey there's the gushard it's over there
[1:53:45] and they they failed to act on it right
[1:53:48] then how many times do do we fail to act
[1:53:50] on just the Simplicity of God's present
[1:53:54] if you would just take it take your
[1:53:57] opportunity God wants to fulfill it and
[1:53:59] so then they ask later hey he goes it
[1:54:02] doesn't work like that see I couldn't
[1:54:05] have confidence in God to ask him to
[1:54:08] show me where the oil gusher is because
[1:54:11] it would not be it would be the wrong
[1:54:14] motive I don't have need of it but what
[1:54:17] do you have need tonight what is your
[1:54:20] need you know I'll say this I'm I'm just
[1:54:24] going
[1:54:25] to you know as as we read the scripture
[1:54:29] and try to find a
[1:54:32] close you know it said there it says um
[1:54:36] and on the tomorrow when they had come
[1:54:39] to Bethany they were hungry and seeing a
[1:54:42] fig tree of far off with the leaves he
[1:54:45] came and happily that he might find
[1:54:48] anything that there on and when he came
[1:54:50] to it he found nothing but leaves for
[1:54:54] the time of figs was not yet and Jesus
[1:54:57] answered and said unto it let no man eat
[1:55:01] of thee Hereafter and forever and his
[1:55:05] disciples heard it you know to think
[1:55:07] that God would use the power to curse
[1:55:12] the fig tree and it wasn't even in
[1:55:15] season you know and that's another
[1:55:18] expression of the power the spoken
[1:55:21] word you know and I I just believe
[1:55:24] sometimes we don't realize the presence
[1:55:27] of the Lord in our lives when we start
[1:55:28] talking to people or even talking to one
[1:55:32] another we have power in our words and
[1:55:36] and just
[1:55:38] think you know he he cursed this fig
[1:55:41] tree you know and and we have the word
[1:55:44] of God that in our situations you know I
[1:55:47] don't want to Lord help me me I don't
[1:55:50] want to be a
[1:55:51] complainer I don't want to be some
[1:55:53] crabby old guy that sees the world and
[1:55:57] the way it is and all the oppression but
[1:56:00] I want God to overshadow me for somebody
[1:56:04] else that I can speak the word of God if
[1:56:07] I'm going to curse something let me
[1:56:09] curse the devil and the works that he
[1:56:12] has over the people that I
[1:56:15] love you know it's it's already been
[1:56:18] proven
[1:56:20] you know that we've been
[1:56:22] commissioned go into all the world you
[1:56:25] shall cast out
[1:56:27] Devils you know and God uses individuals
[1:56:31] so praise the Lord You're that
[1:56:34] individual yes let's not wait on
[1:56:37] somebody else to do it let's look for
[1:56:39] our opportunity
[1:56:41] amen praise the
[1:56:45] lord
[1:56:46] well why don't we stand together
[1:57:09] you know as brother Billy was preaching
[1:57:11] this morning and I certainly appreciate
[1:57:12] that so much really I think it just
[1:57:16] dealt with me in another way and I'll
[1:57:18] share this as we close but you know as
[1:57:21] as we read this I want you to ponder
[1:57:24] somebody that's in your world that you
[1:57:27] want to see you
[1:57:29] know if there's bondage in someone
[1:57:32] else's life and we're we're Kings and
[1:57:35] Priests you know and if if pre-venture
[1:57:38] God in this night would give you power
[1:57:42] by what you say and and you're you're
[1:57:46] called of God for this now now you think
[1:57:50] about that person as we read the
[1:57:52] scripture that person that's under the
[1:57:54] oppression of the enemy and you want to
[1:57:56] curse that thing in the name of the Lord
[1:57:59] cuz you in your heart know what victory
[1:58:01] tastes like and you want somebody else
[1:58:03] to taste victory so I have somebody on
[1:58:06] my heart and he's the guy that
[1:58:08] introduced me to my wife or was part of
[1:58:11] that and it actually just so happen to
[1:58:14] be the same guy that I was with the
[1:58:16] night I got arrested How can I through
[1:58:19] the years of complication in my mind why
[1:58:23] wrestling but now I can see that God
[1:58:26] works all things together for good I
[1:58:29] just visited him this week and I so much
[1:58:32] want he he's like you're coming to me
[1:58:34] with the same thing that everybody else
[1:58:36] has but yet he hasn't seen the power of
[1:58:40] God to transform the life and so you
[1:58:43] know I would be the same as him oh you
[1:58:46] know smoking pot drinking doing
[1:58:48] carousing and all these things it's not
[1:58:51] a bad deal I would still be thinking
[1:58:54] that way if it wasn't God who's rich in
[1:58:57] Mercy you would be the same way you were
[1:59:00] ever being if it wasn't God who was rich
[1:59:02] in Mercy and it's not just to be a stuff
[1:59:05] shirt and say look see God did this for
[1:59:07] me but now we want our faith to go in
[1:59:10] action we have an opportunity
[1:59:13] tonight don't let nothing hinder don't
[1:59:16] let no reason God is here whatever you
[1:59:20] say whatsoever you say let it be from
[1:59:24] your heart and brother Billy was saying
[1:59:27] this in the scripture just really spoke
[1:59:28] to me but in he in Hebrews uh 11 and and
[1:59:33] uh verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered
[1:59:36] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:59:39] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[1:59:44] he was
[1:59:45] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:59:49] and by it being dead yet speaketh and
[1:59:53] how can a man or a woman be speaking
[1:59:57] from the
[1:59:59] dead that's what I want to happen
[2:00:01] tonight with every single one of your
[2:00:02] request you're dead in Christ now let
[2:00:06] God fall on you let God go to work and
[2:00:09] be that Ambassador for Christ for
[2:00:12] somebody tonight amen is that your
[2:00:14] desire whatever you say let's
[2:00:18] pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we
[2:00:21] thank you for your goodness to us Lord

[2:31:50] [Music]
[2:32:04] [Music]
[2:32:45] for
[2:33:15] well
[2:33:17] we're thankful to be gathered here
[2:33:20] tonight uh we got meetings coming up
[2:33:22] next week we're looking forward to what
[2:33:25] the Lord has in store for us we know
[2:33:28] that he had a predestinated moment in
[2:33:31] his mind of the things he was going to
[2:33:33] accomplish and we're just entering in
[2:33:35] with faith we ask that those things that
[2:33:37] he desires to accomplish would become
[2:33:40] real to us that our hearts could enter
[2:33:42] in and and uh anticipate the burden that
[2:33:47] will be on The Minister's heart to be in
[2:33:48] prayer because we know that we're needy
[2:33:51] people and we have need of the lord we
[2:33:54] can't do anything without him if he
[2:33:55] doesn't come and perform what only he
[2:33:58] can perform then it'll just be the works
[2:34:00] of man nothing could come of it and
[2:34:04] we're just asking him to have his
[2:34:05] complete will and way in the services to
[2:34:07] come
[2:34:09] um it's important that each of us
[2:34:11] sanctify Our lives our hearts our minds
[2:34:14] and consecrate ourselves because we
[2:34:15] don't want anything to hinder the moving
[2:34:17] of the lord we want to reverence his
[2:34:19] Sanctuary set this aside as a place of
[2:34:22] worship where we know that he comes
[2:34:23] deals with hearts changes lives delivers
[2:34:27] us from the things that would afflict us
[2:34:30] and we're going to give him the praise
[2:34:32] and the glory for those
[2:34:33] things yeah it's that plus 12 was
[2:34:44] just yeah
[2:34:49] I it was feedback yeah because you had
[2:34:52] it was so wide open just at the mic
[2:34:55] which was that was a new challenge um
[2:34:58] you know what can you do something for
[2:34:59] me start to I don't have the tablet but
[2:35:02] just start to give me monitor like uh
[2:35:05] maybe turn the house down completely the
[2:35:07] house completely off and then just start
[2:35:09] to turn up number one until you until
[2:35:13] you can hear it um so
[2:35:16] I'm on the lapel and we're just G to
[2:35:19] well when I say one Ox one yeah so on Ox
[2:35:23] one just start to turn up number two
[2:35:27] until
[2:35:28] we and it's like man it ain't nothing
[2:35:31] happening uh so we're on number two so
[2:35:35] um I can just start to hear myself now I
[2:35:38] think if I was to have instruments just
[2:35:40] a little louder so where you're at right
[2:35:43] there would be I think a good level for
[2:35:45] monitor like no and no feedback and this
[2:35:49] should be so that level right here I can
[2:35:52] hear myself now I do think potentially
[2:35:56] we may have a PO a par polarity thing
[2:35:59] because I feel like I'm getting like
[2:36:02] that speaker could
[2:36:04] be on a because it almost feels like I'm
[2:36:07] noise cancelling between
[2:36:10] these but this is great I think this is
[2:36:13] great o that doesn't sound good at
[2:36:17] all
[2:36:18] um well it's probably looping can you
[2:36:21] hear that that's the feedback it's
[2:36:23] actually catching feedback but it's not
[2:36:26] squealing so
[2:36:29] that's oh you can't it's it's happening
[2:36:32] up here but I think it's self that it's
[2:36:34] self-limiting or something here sounds
[2:36:37] great
[2:36:39] but when you get too close to the
[2:36:41] speaker and that's what I mean I think
[2:36:42] it's that noise cancelling effect I
[2:36:46] it's something there's something
[2:36:54] weird yeah might as well wait hold on
[2:36:57] I'm wondering if it's just if that
[2:37:00] speaker done blue I I sure hope
[2:37:03] not well I'll tell you what come up here
[2:37:06] and listen to the speaker with me not on
[2:37:08] the microphone like I don't know if it's
[2:37:10] because I'm getting close or if it
[2:37:12] really sounds that way so if it really
[2:37:16] sounds that way that's
[2:37:18] horrible they they should both be on but
[2:37:21] tell me if that doesn't sound like real
[2:37:22] like tin foil like that you know if
[2:37:26] that's really the way that speaker sound
[2:37:28] then it's done blown or
[2:37:29] something can you is it is it sounding
[2:37:32] that way or is it pretty clear just
[2:37:34] clear right no it sounds hot it's like
[2:37:40] overloaded yeah there's definitely a lot
[2:37:42] of settings on
[2:37:44] there that's all it is we just got well
[2:37:49] if it is you're going to have to send it
[2:37:50] more volume which is fine send it more
[2:37:53] volume here so it does sound good down
[2:37:56] here it does see I'm telling you it's a
[2:37:57] noise cancelling thing sounds perfect
[2:38:00] it's crystal clear right here see that's
[2:38:02] I think there's a I think there's so if
[2:38:05] your head's right here it's
[2:38:08] weird yeah because you're in a spot
[2:38:10] where you're not catching That
[2:38:12] acoustic you see what I'm saying it's an
[2:38:14] acoustic cancellation
[2:38:16] then I think it's the I think
