be gathered once again in the house of God Amen we [Music] try not to be too long tonight for communion service let's open our Bibles first in Joel chapter 2 The Book of Joel chapter 2. let's read from there's a buzzing sound back here so if you could just help he says and I will wish Joel chapter 2 let's read from verse 25 it says and I will restore unto you the years that the locusts had eaten that the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great Army which I have sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else it says in my people shall never be ashamed I like that reassurance is wanting you to know you're never going to be ashamed you're never going to be ashamed he says and I will come and and he shall and he shall come to pass that afterwards that I will poured out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and and your those sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon your servant upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days I will pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in in the heavens and in the earth it says blood and fire and pillow of smoke Also let's turn in Psalms chapter one a very familiar scripture reading um Psalm chapter 1 it says blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly no standeth in the way of Sinners no sitteth in the seat of scornful it says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doeth he dwell meditate day and night and it shall be like a tree planted by the river of rivers of water and that bringeth forth his fruits in his season his life also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but but are like the the shaft which the winds drives away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in in judgment nor The Sinner in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated man just for a few minutes I believe perhaps just trying to see if it could tie it in with what was spoken in this morning because remember we were told that we want to ask and be able to receive and I thought that perhaps this is something I've been looking at it could probably just help us understand to what extent God is wanting and Desiring to bless us as we read in Psalm it says blessed is a man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly uh in in other words this man it doesn't pay any mind to what the unbeliever is saying he's not paying any mind to what the devil is saying his mind is all focused in what God wants to give him he's not interested in anything else except what God is in store for him he doesn't stand nor in in the way of Sinners nor city with the with in the state of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord his heart desire Burns for God and and he looks at and brother tells us that the word of God is the law of God he's he's always constantly in the word of God in the in the word of God and then he says and in his law he does meditate day and night in other words he's constantly looking at it and his desire is to see the manifestation of what God has spoken for the time and the age that they are living in and they are not interested like our pastor was saying this morning being interested in in in amassing wealth here on Earth they're not interested in oh I got to get a good job I got to get that all of that is fine but the focus of the life is in the law of God what is God wants me to do how can I be a better servant how can I do a good job his Delight is in the law of God and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water and but when I'm says one place he says the rivers the many rivers but one water and then he says that signify I believe it says nine gifts of the Spirit but all of him the same Spirit nine different gifts but the Same Spirit The Same Spirit that's giving all of that and he bringeth forth his fruits in his season his leaves shall not shall not wither whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now I want you to see how he's talking and he's talking about the setting of this tree he's planted by the river of water and is giving his fruits in his season in other words the the very source of worry is he's planted in the water he's not planted out somewhere where someone needs to go get a bucket of water and every once in a while water this tree so they can keep it alive no his very feet his very Roots is in the water and in there he brings forth the water and he transforms the water into fruits and his fruit is eaten up by others his fruits is for the the blessing of the people they can come and get a fruit from him and eat of this tree and this tree also have leaves that people can come in and stay under the shade for fellowshipping they're coming it's a tree that stands there people can come and they shade and they will will hide and they will come and they will come and help fellowship and they said and everything and Brahman says it is fruit as you can see it comes from the fact that it's connected to the roots and The Roots signify predestination so in other words the fruits that is bringing forth is just not any kind of fruits it's just not any kind of fruit so I want this fruit I want a shout I want to do this no the fruits is well it was predestinated for him to bring in the age that he was living in in the season that this tree was in so if it was time for it to bring a type of fruit it will bring it and it will be the best fruit it will be a fruit that you can take and taste it has all the sweets in it it has it produces and you can tell it's a real fruit it's amazing because I was talking about a while ago and we were talking how he said I went to Walmart and I got me some fruit some oranges he says but I took him and I eat him it tasted so different and it tasted so bitter it seems like he didn't have any much sweet in it and everything I said well because you got him out of season because you got him if you don't get something in the season of it it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste it doesn't really bring what he's supposed to bring but when you get it in the season that it's supposed to bring it it comes from with the full maturity and the fruits of it can be enjoyed and those fruits are permanent fruits they're not temporary fruits they're permanent fruits so he says his leaves creates a shade under which the people can come and rest they provide a place for Fellowship it produces the fruits which comes down from predestination this tree has life as long as it's in the water in other words Barbarian says this tree can never die this tree can never die and you look at it why because it's planted in the water as long as there's life flowing as long as there's water flowing this tree shall live forever why because it's planted in the water all he needs to do is continue to drink out of that water continue to take out of that water and then from then on it can produce the leaf that people can come and stay under he can come and produce the fruits that people can come and stay here and this is not just a treat this is the type of a True Believer who's in Jesus Christ and that's why we Rejoice because we're not just talking about some random tree somewhere we're talking about a Believer who's planted in Christ who knows the position who know that they have been planted here in this generation in this time for a purpose yeah they just don't run out to anything to hear oh behold this year to run over here no where he's planted he knows that God did the planting God did the watering and God is only expecting me to bring the fruits under which I'm planted where he has planted me this tree represent the elected of God he represented those that are in Christ and and the outside doesn't bother this tree oh it's not well you know I didn't have that so that's happening over there it cannot move it's planted in Christ it's sealed in Christ it's protected by Christ it will bring forth his spirit in his season if he doesn't bring for fruit it doesn't get all wrong that poor I can't believe I'm not breathing as long as he knows it's in Christ that's its security I this is not just a man this is more than a man this is a man who's planted in Christ when you are planted in Christ you're not just a natural man you become a supernatural person because it's no longer your life that's coming out it's his life being lived through you oftentimes we get caught up because we look so much our Humanity we're trying to perfect the humanity always Humanity Humanity but you be planted in Christ you will forget about Humanity what matters to you is where you are planted and who planted you yeah man but what I will say and it says David saw it and he speaks about this tree it says David saw it and he speaking he said blessed is a man he says notice he said he could not die his leaves his leaves would not weather he says no no no matter what they do that it says they will never kill it that tree why he says it's that's where he's planted that's it says that's what he does that's where he's planted is planted by the rivers of water he says now notice he says his roots won't die he says it says when strong wind and it says and then he says and then he says and then when the way of the markers and knows the last come and make fun of a Christian he says what it does it just pers it says is is persecution check the Christian it says it makes him pray more dig down get better hold so so that he can stand the storm oh my I would like to be this tree this is a representation of what we are being brought into this is the representation now remember I guess I didn't give a title so I I want to speak on the bridegroom restoring his bride the bridegroom restoring his bride so when he's talking about this tree and what this tree is able to do and what is able to endure he's telling you the representation of what you are called to be in the end time and is wanting you to know that this is what I'm bringing you to so you can be one that's planted by me so you can be one that's pointed in me that will not move he says when the storm comes when he moves the tree it only helps it to have a better hold he says he says now this is in the message restoration of the Bright Tree paragraph 156 of 156. it says now what if what what if what if a man is planted in such a thing by the river he says where the Springs of nine different Springs feed unto him oh my what an established uh he has he says he says and the man that's planted by the river it says the river of water one water it says of one water one Spirit there are Gifts of healing the same Gift gifts of Prophecy it says send gift uh Same Spirit and all Same Spirit many gifts one Giver he says now David saw him and it was planted by by the by this tree now he couldn't die now notice why he had the Life in The Roots his life didn't come from the the all because it was happening he was receiving sunlight that was receiving no the very life was being drawn out from the roots the sun was calling but the very life was being drawn from the root and I was everything would project when he would project the life was coming from the very roots and coming into the manifestation it says all he says or the life of the tree he says staying in The Roots certainly come up and bears its fruits all right he says watch his root had life in them to bring forth his fruits in his season now remember this tree will not cast its fruit it says now you take a tree that's put away from the water he says the first thing you know your fruit your your little old Apple uh your old apples it says they are all tardy and and warm eaten and casted out a cup that's how sometimes we become you know you get and then you know the the the fruits withered and they become small and they don't taste like they're supposed to taste and they don't look like they're supposed to look the leaves are all yellow and everything in life is being drawn out of it why because you have been taken away from the very water that you're supposed to drink and let me say this the the answer to every problem that a Believer has is in the word in the water that you're supposed to drink said oh I need this so I need this to either or I need money to pay my rent I need this you go you drink the water God will provide it for you you grow you drink the water God will provide whatever means he will call who he will touch and whatever he will do you just drink the water God will do the producing of the fruits you just stay in The Roots You just continue to bring off that water and God will produce the rest oftentimes we don't drink the water and then we try to solve the problem ourselves we run here we run here we run here and then we don't have a solution we take this problem to solve that problem and then we take that problem too so you can't solve one problem with another problem you need to forget it all and go back to the roots and sort of fresh that's why the prophet told us he says if this tree will bring forth another Branch an original Branch not a grafted Branch but it'll reach it off Branch it will produce the same act that he had the branch produced he says that's paragraph 1 6 it says that's what's the matter with the church today you done you've done gone away by the river you've done gone away from the river got away from them gifts of the Spirit they've just gotten Church natural they've gotten away from the spirit the spiritual gift and spiritual gift and they cast They cast their fruit it says do you do they do that it says what do they do they believe they Believers live in the world act like the world still cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble have uh a Banco party is in the church to pay to pay the preachers and everything else soup suppers dance see they cast their fruits it's just like the world and now it says in the next paragraph and the unbeliever who can say there's no difference in that person and me the scripture says by their future shall know them you shall see them by the fruit and the only way you can get the real fruits is to be rooted and grounded in this water that God has provided in the same time water that we are put into so we can bring forth the fruits that he wants us to do it says that's a man that's planted he says there's no stuck out by the man that's planted is not stuck out but planted by the river of water he shall bring forth his fruit watch is fruit his fruit in his season are you reading it he says someone it says blessed is a man that said it not in the seed of the sconeful sitting not in the way of Sinners he says he shall he shall be like a tree that's planted by the river of water and they shall bring forth his fruit in his season whatsoever he doeth shall prosper why because it's not doing his own idea it's not going about his own business just trying to get rich or do whatever everything that he does is connected to what's in the root every time he wants to do something is this going to reflect what's in the root no I'm not going to do it it's just going to is this going to show forth the predestinated life no then I don't need it whatever he does will prosper because it's the same thing and let me just jump and say that's why the prophet will say even you know in regards to the restoration it says oh that the harmony that existed between the Father and Son it says that same Harmony must exist between Christ and the bride why it's the harmony of the tree knowing I have no business looking for anything outside except what's coming from the root it says let me just skip something for this it says now it says he shall bring forth his fruit in his season watch he's he's he says the person the this personal uh this it says he is personal pronoun it says there his fruits God's fruits in the season that the prophet is bringing it God's fruits in the season that the prophet is bringing in not not just any other kind of fruit but the fruit that the prophet has told us that we shall bring forth the fruits that have been prophesied that we shall bring forth that's the fruit I'm looking for if if the word says in this age the bride shall be like the bridegroom that's the fruit I want to see it's not the fruit of just oh rejoicing rejoicing is part of it it's not just the bread of shouting it's part of it but the fruit is to identify the life and say this is the life that was promised for this moment it says it's in that prophet's season God's fruit God it says In God's Time by The Prophet's season see it shall bring forth his fruits in his season see if there isn't two it says is there it says bring forth his God's fruit see in the season that the messenger is ordained to come he will bring forth those now remember that the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring in God's season in the season of the bringer see he will bring forth his fruits in his season and he cannot wither he says why his God predestinated fruit in there it can destroy it because it's predestinated we can't be destroyed we we can't be turned aside we can go this way or that way we are predestinated to be here for this hour and now let me say this before I can move on and I know I'm running against time I'm just trying to lay a foundation we'll probably pick it up next time um when I'm situation of the bright tree is we know he talks about what restoration is to bring back to the original owner and all those things and I just want to say this statement before I can move on so we can kind of establish what my mind is tonight now I just want to say now restoration was only for the end time everything else that was me on it was it was a build up to it but it wasn't the proper Restoration in other words for you to say something is restored it's not until it produced the same properties the same everything like the original now it can produce some and Will Rejoice about it because God is in the middle of working his program but it's not until it comes in it's a full maturity that you can say uh this is it this is what was promised in other words we could say we could sit here but when it says restoration is not replacement respiration is not taking one and replacing it with another restoration is to bring forth the same one that went in the ground the same one that went Wicked Christ came he was the word of God in fullness but it was not until he took his life and replaced it into his bride it's not until he took that life and press it into the bride that we could see another man come back and do the same work that Christ head that's why we can call restoration now now it's just not a restoration it's just not one thing it's a restoration of the full word because partial word bring partial restoration that's why we can say there was in three stages as the prophet will say it it came there was the first part where he came and says Luther came and Wesley came in those messages came so he was in the build up that God was doing but full restoration is not until the end time so restoration is to bring forth like I said the harmony that existed before the fall and I want to say this in the end time this message is the message of restoration when you come in contact with this message it restores you right back into the original Christian that God desires to see in this generation there is not another message under the face of the Earth that will do this for you another message will give you partial restoration it will make you just a church member it will cause you to be an intellect but this message tells you what was in God's mind and what God desires to say in the end time now let me say this when we Barbara is when he preaches there he talks about this comes with the process of of of of of enforcing the rightful condition of something so we understand by saying that that if we were if we were to say we are being restored it means we are being restored to something that existed before we could be what we are today so when we speak about the Bright Tree there had to be somewhere somehow that we were the bright tree that we read in Psalm chapter one we were that kind of tree we had all those attributes within us and somehow we had fallen and God is trying to get back with us to that place that he had in the original mind so we let me say this it's not by chance that we are in the flesh that we are in it's not by any chance it was all part of God's plan that we may come into this world but before we can come there had to be some predestination somewhere that can say that you even though you came this way I've made you with the ability that you could be returned back to this and and that's God's law that's God's word that's him doing it that's him promising it that's him uh proclaiming but no greater than himself that this is gonna happen and there's nothing that can stop it so he barabbana speaks now and I thought this was so amazing this is the and I heard about a master prayer and I thought it was stepping on my Note already it's in the same message that brother Branham talks about I believe it was brother Evan's car that was stolen it's in the same message before he can actually start preaching now oh that's that's why I love this message so much but one of them is giving you a preview of what actually happened before he can preach the word to you to let you know I'm just not giving you some stories that you can go like that you can go and tell your friends and tell others no what I'm about to preach right now has just happened and I know about what I'm talking about what I'm preaching right now is a result of something that God just did so we can sit here and know if I take the same word if I come back with the same attitude if I come back with the same way the same God will restore the car the same God will restore me why because he didn't just give the word he proved it so that I know that his word is true so now he speaks here he says uh if if something was to be stolen like you were to lose your property or something that you would have to have something that proves or some laws that that would stay that would support that this particular property belonged to you and if it was yours if you could prove it then then uh the laws of the land will support you so I'll just read quickly so we can move on paragraph 88 it says enforcing it says then we have the privilege to enforce let me just go up a little bit paragraph 85 it says like if someone stole some properties if they are holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law in law the love and the law of forces enforces this person to restore the property back to its natural owner it goes to someone that it doesn't belong to the law of the land whatever that situation is will force so that the person can return it back to the original owner it says the first estate enforcement oh it says what attacks I'd like to have two days on this enforcing it says now but now let me skip that so it says enforcing then it says we have the privilege listen to this to enforce upon Satan they claim that God gives us now let me just profess this the word of God is the law of God the word of God is the law that governs everything and the law is God's word being enforced now it says God God has a law and his word is a law God in his word made a certain claim to the church are you in the Church of God tonight tell you we can identify and say I'm the church why are you in the church I've been born by the spirit of God I didn't get to this by myself I didn't just wake up and say I desire God I want God no I've been birthing to this Kingdom and someone something within me connected with this word and I'm sure I am God's word I'm God's Church now that there's so many other things that's still out there I still have this I still have that I still have so many other things hanging off of me but he's wanting you to know what is your your personal identification yo you as you're sitting here how can you identify yourself therefore we have the right to force those claim upon Satan give me back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit I love that because I you know so much we stop about the Holy Spirit what is the Holy Spirit and and what is job you know again I thought Brother David just touched on and maybe you didn't pay attention the reason I I was sitting back there I knew I was going to say something tonight so these things were just constantly on my mind as you were saying it so in other words when the word is given the holy spirit is the agent who takes the word and brings it to pass not another Spirit from somewhere else not some other something falling off of the sky and coming upon you no when the world is spoken there is a spirit attached to it that would come and take that word and make it a reality to you when you believe the word you activate the agent to come to you and show you that what you believe is the reality of God oh I love how he places it so the agent is always there around the world all you need is the word all you need is to hear the word all you need is to come in contact with the word the agent will come back and will prove to you but that what you heard is the word if that's why well I just spoke to you now if what I said is the truth Hallelujah if what I just spoke to you is God's word then he's ancient he's he's bound to come around and show you that this is God's word don't go look for the edge and look for the word because where the word is the ancient is also there no word people are just oh what are you screaming about for the year look for the word for the world because the agent is not far near because his job is to make the world a reality to your heart like I said we're not going to go anywhere tonight foreign the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say that saith the Lord he he says he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it he didn't say you go make the devil do it he didn't say you scream till the devil does it he didn't say you have to do nothing you believe the word what's the agent San Diego with the word say God I believe your word I believe what I just heard where is the agent I need the agent to make this a reality to my heart the ancient will come and we will make it a reality to you now he says the law of the land enforced to enforce it says by the law by the land and the land he says but the law of the spirit paragraph 89 but the law of the spirit of God is to enforce Satan to give up that which he has unwhitefully deceitfully taken from God he says Souls of man he took from God Souls of women children sicknesses on them on their body he says he placed them upon people where God made him in his image but like to be like to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal right by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and to enforce upon them now I just want to give you the order I said I wasn't going to do this but Branham talks about the stolen car and I'm not going to go through all of it but there's a prayer that he makes that he says that I just started so wonderful it's important when we come to God we put his words on our lips like we heard it this morning the idea is not to come and to cry and to ball and to turn around on the on the platform it says oh God oh God oh God no what God wants to hear is his word coming back to him what God wants to know is what law are you bringing in front of me why did I promise you I was going to do when did I promise it and how did I say I was going to do it if you're looking for something beautiful Cain offered Something Beautiful he offered the great exceeding great worship that anybody will look and say I will take that but that's not what God took why because the agent could not come near that what God was looking for was a representation of something that he did it's always the word my brother my sister we can never talk enough about the word of God so now hear this prayer he says paragraph 95 it says now we got on our knees about five men it says brother Fred softman and many of the others that were there uh four or five men he says we went down on our knees now listen to this paragraph 8 95 it says I pleaded this case before God and then I took the word or the promise and send it forth it says the great Holy Spirit as he took the word to serve the summon it says a vision broke and I saw the man going down towards bowling alley it's not complicated we complicate stuff by ourselves we come and oh it has to be the celebrate uh machine going on and you know praise have to hit this high before I can go no you can come in into the morning you can come to God's service this morning or tonight you can say you come and you go down on your knees you say God I have a law that I want to enforce this morning this has happened that has happened I'm calling upon your word you said in your word that if I ask you shall be given you said in your words that the righteous shall never break Pride you said in your word this and you said that you said that this is the restoration of the bride and I'm here say that the Holy Spirit can come and take your word and enforce that which you have promised to your people how do I get from here to that tree in Psalm chapter one enforcement enforcement what is God said what is his word proclaim and promise for this age and then you take that give it to the Holy Spirit and let him take it gladly and little by little bring you right into your position I know we have communion ours up here we'll continue another day God bless you [Applause] more hallelujah praise God wonderful Hallelujah doesn't that make you feel good doesn't that just want to make you have communion don't you just feel sorry for the people that aren't here my goodness Hallelujah my and I've done this feel like a meeting right now you're in the atmosphere right now's the time to ask right you've got everything laid down you know how to ask you know who you are you don't have amnesia all things are possible right what hindereth you amen we've got water we have everything we have need of that just it just wonderful I believe that our Sunday school kids are in we think we're grateful for that and we're grateful for everything let's be in anticipation and uh and uh really have faith uh for all the things that God can do for us and and uh you know buy these great and exceeding precious promises amen we're partakers of divine nature but don't you just love the enforcement part amen you've got your part to play amen it's just you know you've got your part the believing the taking the word the applying of the word the same issue is no good having a tool bag if you don't use it right and so I just love that I just don't want to stay in here for a while I just can't preach I tell Billy all the time Billy I'm just going to give you the idea you go preach it you know what I mean um you know age does a lot of things to you but one of the things I think it does for you is it gives you wisdom and part of the wisdom is as you know that if you follow the law it'll work amen and so uh let's go ahead and find our our communion scripture and I I got to get over in First Corinthians he was the 11th chapter of Corinthians and and I believe our communions prepared but you know one of the things that we have to realize is that Satan never wants you to ever come to the realization of who that you really are and remember he said when we can recognize Who We Are and our position that's when you become an invincible Army because it's not you it's the acceptance that God gave you his word and when you know he's giving you his word he didn't give you his word so you could put an intellectual stamp on it that it's true you know what I mean because his word isn't just the pages of this book his words Living Word and then you know and I I thought that when he said if you're living the word then everything you do is the will of God you know you don't have to fall into that great battle is this the will is that the will light brother Billy said he is his will and the mind of God is the will of God and God's Will and of his word so if you're in that Living Water you know what I mean and your trees are alive and your fruits are being expressed then that is the will of God and then anything that takes you from that that's what you cut off you don't burden yourself do I go here do I go here do I do this do I do that that's somebody who's not sure of themselves but amen you know you're not a snob but you got confidence amen and there's one thing you know if I do it in the right spirit that God will make it right amen if I get in the permissive will he'll lead me to the perfect will you can't live you can't live being afraid Jesus Takes the fear away the spirit takes the fear away the life in the love of God being shed abroad in your heart with the Holy Spirit if I could sum up in kind of an understanding of everything that Billy said it's the Capstone is that perfect love of his word it's applying the word in perfect love and the believer takes control of every circumstances amen you get a circumstances you know you can take control of it if you're in him sickness death family members everything there's nothing that we can't climb to in the heights of the Lord amen I love how brother Bram said just keep coming up just keep coming up we're coming up Church don't you love them amen we don't want partial restoration do we we want full restoration amen amen so let's stand together we'll have communion at this time and that's what communion is it's you and him getting together brother Branham said there's healing in communion so you can come with your petition this evening you can come knowing that you're doing the word of God and communion itself becomes enforcement amen you can come and say I'm partaking of the word I'm coming and doing what I'm told to do I'm keeping his commandment so Satan by doing this I'm going to lay my petition and I'm going to claim what my promise is and you can have what you ask for tonight amen so let's read he said in the 23rd chapter verse of the 11th chapter of Corinthians he speaks these words he says I have for I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do ye in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as often as she drink it in remembrance of me for for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore wherever who shall wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home till you come not together unto come the nation and the rest while I set in order when I come amen aren't those beautiful words a wonderful things I can just imagine how it was when Paul was established in communion and the wonderful spirit of the Lord I feel such a wonderful spirit here amen I believe that you could have whatever you asked for tonight believe had Faith let your petitions rise before the Lord tonight our brother has given us the word of authority that we can go forth and claim all that we have need of I bless you let us all pray together and you joined and you asked the blessing on the bread that you're going to eat you ask the blessing on the wine that you're going to take you put yourself this evening in communion not just the
