[38:15] a few announcements as you know we've
[38:18] we've tried to gear this towards the

[38:23] limited with spaces or things that we
[38:25] can do and we realize that we may be
[38:28] doing something outside in this weather
[38:30] we might not have to show up
[38:33] so we we've tried to make some
[38:34] arrangements

[38:41] helpers out of town guests my home will

[38:53] able to accommodate you that way we
[38:55] don't have to put you out there in 100
[38:57] degree Heat

[40:40] something softly we'll say a prayer over
[40:42] the tithes and offerings I don't believe
[40:45] there was any request turned in
[40:49] um but one thing I do know
[40:52] we have a lot of needs
[40:54] and maybe
[40:57] as they begin to play maybe just start
[41:01] forming something in your heart that you
[41:04] want God to do
[41:05] why don't we just start to
[41:07] form an expectation
[41:14] Maybe
[41:16] the family member or loved one
[41:20] maybe somebody wants to stand in the cab
[41:22] tonight why don't you lift your hand for
[41:24] that loved one yes
[41:26] foreign
[41:34] Heavenly Father
[41:39] what an amazing
[41:41] opportunity to be able to stand in your
[41:44] presence
[41:45] [Music]
[41:47] to know that there's been a blood that's
[41:49] been shed
[41:52] that we could be forgiven Lord
[41:55] or do we want to start out the meeting
[41:57] by asking or they they forgive us for
[41:59] all of our sins Lord
[42:01] for our unbelief Lord where we failed
[42:04] you our iniquities lordly we need the
[42:07] blood Lord and we know there's still
[42:09] power in that blood

[42:13] Water of the word Lord so we're we just
[42:15] want to lay down all of our cares Lord
[42:17] all of our iniquity our sins our
[42:20] failures Lord we just plead the blood
[42:22] that was shed Lord
[42:24] that we could be forgiven Lord Jesus
[42:28] now Lord we can approach you with a
[42:30] boldness knowing that it's finished
[42:33] that we have been forgiven Lord
[42:36] we can stand in the gap for our brothers
[42:38] and for our sisters and
[42:40] for our children and those that are in
[42:43] need Lord and we can stand upon your
[42:44] word

[42:49] whatever we would ask in your name that
[42:52] you would do it Lord

[42:58] and now our faith anchors in your word

[43:02] which you've promised
[43:04] Lord these hands that were lifted for
[43:06] unspoken prayer requests

[56:50] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:52] and I wanted to say what a privilege it

[56:57] a lot of Youth in the back too with gray
[56:59] hair and I have to say that because I'm
[57:01] getting there myself so but I just want
[57:04] to say it's a real privilege to be here
[57:06] and I want to thank Brother David and
[57:08] sister Leslie for their invitation and

[57:18] we just appreciate them and this
[57:20] opportunity to be here you know we're
[57:22] all Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[57:24] and we probably would have never met
[57:27] except for what we have in common
[57:30] because we've come from all over the
[57:32] world all walks of life all kinds of
[57:36] different paths but God rich in Mercy

[57:58] Saints back home in Sarasota Florida so
[58:00] we're looking forward to what God will
[58:02] do in these Services
[58:03] he knows who would be here and I believe
[58:06] that he plans these things and he lays
[58:10] these burdens upon the ministry's hearts
[58:12] and then he has a harvest of that burden
[58:16] and he's going to see that in your life
[58:19] I believe that amen let's bow our heads
[58:21] if we can Heavenly Father
[58:23] together

[59:24] bring fruits and harvest of it Lord in
[59:27] Jesus name we pray amen and amen God
[59:30] bless you this evening if you turn in
[59:32] your Bibles
[59:34] over to the book of Isaiah
[59:38] the 14th chapter I'm going to read to
[59:41] you very
[59:44] familiar portion of scripture
[59:49] and we have
[59:51] more
[59:53] than one service
[59:55] um
[59:56] this week so we may carry this thought a
[1:00:01] service or two with the help of the Lord
[1:00:04] but this is very familiar Isaiah 14 and
[1:00:08] verse 12.
[1:00:11] how art thou fallen from heaven
[1:00:15] o Lucifer son of the morning
[1:00:19] how art thou cut down to the ground
[1:00:21] which did weaken the Nations
[1:00:24] for you have said in your heart
[1:00:27] I will Ascend into heaven
[1:00:30] I'll exalt my throne above the stars of
[1:00:34] God I will also sit upon the Mount of
[1:00:37] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:00:39] north I'll Ascend above the heights of
[1:00:41] the clouds
[1:00:42] I will be like the most high
[1:00:46] yet you shall be brought down to Hell
[1:00:49] to the sides of the pit
[1:00:51] and they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:00:54] look upon thee and consider these saying
[1:00:56] is this the man
[1:00:58] that made the Earth to tremble
[1:01:01] they did Shake kingdoms
[1:01:03] that made the world as a wilderness
[1:01:07] and destroyed the cities thereof
[1:01:09] that opened not the house of his
[1:01:13] prisoners notice
[1:01:15] the prophet Isaiah
[1:01:17] he is speaking of a great person
[1:01:20] a man who has had great influence
[1:01:24] and perception
[1:01:27] a conception of what he is and you can
[1:01:30] see as he's
[1:01:32] saying these things how the perception
[1:01:34] is changing
[1:01:36] and so we want to speak on this this
[1:01:39] evening you can be seated
[1:01:43] I appreciate once again Brother David to
[1:01:47] be here and and I've appreciated the
[1:01:50] fellowship we've had today with all the
[1:01:53] brothers around the the best
[1:01:56] pork chops in the world according to
[1:01:58] brother Matt amen everything's bigger in
[1:02:01] Texas
[1:02:02] and I appreciate amen the the
[1:02:06] opportunity
[1:02:08] to come but we don't come just to
[1:02:11] meet one another we come because we're
[1:02:14] going to have services and and there's a
[1:02:17] burden that's here that that's that's
[1:02:19] beyond me amen but it's the Lord's
[1:02:22] burden I believe he knows our hearts
[1:02:25] and and sometimes and this is just me uh
[1:02:28] as a minister you know it doesn't get
[1:02:32] any easier in the sense of of uh of
[1:02:37] ministering because it's always a
[1:02:38] nervous place for me and it's not that
[1:02:41] we lack something to say because we have
[1:02:44] more material and more access now than
[1:02:47] at any time in history
[1:02:49] but God knows the heart so it's to the
[1:02:51] need that that we want to speak hi
[1:02:54] brother John amen and and and God knows
[1:02:57] that need and so for a minister it's it
[1:03:01] can be it can be a shaky place because
[1:03:03] he doesn't want to come and and project
[1:03:06] himself but but he wants it to be amen
[1:03:09] the mind of God Amen that's being spoken
[1:03:13] and I had I had been I had been reading
[1:03:15] these certain statements that brother
[1:03:17] Branham was making and it attracted me
[1:03:20] to it and and he said that he wanted to
[1:03:22] preach on this subject of the trail of
[1:03:25] The Serpent and uh and I'm obviously
[1:03:28] nobody to replace a prophet for speaking
[1:03:31] on a subject we realize that he said I
[1:03:34] want to go home and I want to speak on
[1:03:35] this it'll be about a four-hour sermon
[1:03:37] amen I'll probably take about the same
[1:03:39] amount of time but not all at once amen
[1:03:42] and and uh but but but I am not I'm not
[1:03:46] going to this evening try to say well
[1:03:48] this is what he really meant or this is
[1:03:50] who he was speaking to but I just want
[1:03:52] to use the outline of what he said
[1:03:54] because I remember as a young Minister
[1:03:58] it's kind of hard for me to say that
[1:04:00] anymore because I I used to enjoy being
[1:04:03] the young Minister I'm not there anymore
[1:04:06] it's been many years but when I started
[1:04:08] ministering my my wife's grandfather who
[1:04:10] was a pastor he's went on to be with the
[1:04:12] Lord he began to tell me he said you
[1:04:15] know when you're dealing with people and
[1:04:17] their their bound with sickness or some
[1:04:20] kind of thing he said the first thing
[1:04:21] you have to deal with is the fear that's
[1:04:25] upon them
[1:04:26] before you ever deal with a disease
[1:04:30] with the situation you have to deal with
[1:04:32] the fear because what accompanies
[1:04:34] anything that Satan tries to bring to
[1:04:37] you is going to bring a fear
[1:04:40] with that fears of hopelessness and a
[1:04:43] worthlessness and and and I can't be
[1:04:45] delivered type of thing but but you know
[1:04:48] what what the prophet did is he came and
[1:04:51] he exposed the enemy
[1:04:54] amen this is the purpose of God Amen to
[1:04:58] expose him amen this is why the prophet
[1:05:01] said he hates the Book of Revelation and
[1:05:03] he hates the Book of Genesis the Book of
[1:05:06] Genesis shows how he came into the human
[1:05:08] race how how he deceived the human race
[1:05:12] amen and the Book of Revelation shows
[1:05:15] how he'll be destroyed and he hates to
[1:05:18] be exposed if he hates to be exposed on
[1:05:22] any level he hates to be exposed on a
[1:05:24] corporate level come on he hates to be
[1:05:28] exposed on an intimate level
[1:05:31] he hates exposure why does he hate
[1:05:33] exposure because if he is this
[1:05:36] all-powerful if he is this person that
[1:05:40] doesn't open up the house of his
[1:05:42] prisoners if he is this person who has
[1:05:45] seemingly so much power over the human
[1:05:48] life why does he hate exposure
[1:05:53] so we want to expose him
[1:05:55] and the only way we can expose him is
[1:05:58] the Vindicated way
[1:05:59] and the Vindicated way is the word I
[1:06:02] listen I'm a person that believes in
[1:06:04] experience but that experience must be
[1:06:07] rooted in the word of God that
[1:06:10] experience cannot take you back to the
[1:06:12] word it's not going to hold but if it
[1:06:14] can come back to the word there is
[1:06:17] nothing Satan can do to take it away
[1:06:19] from you because you have what he Lacks
[1:06:24] I don't tell you the youngest person in
[1:06:26] here can have what Satan Lacks
[1:06:30] I just want to encourage you Satan can't
[1:06:33] get healed he can't get delivered he
[1:06:35] can't get free amen all these feelings
[1:06:37] you get come from him they're not yours
[1:06:40] there is
[1:06:41] come on church amen Satan knows he
[1:06:45] cannot be free he knows he's lost his
[1:06:48] first estate he cannot get it back but
[1:06:51] this is the hour of Redemption where God
[1:06:54] is redeeming those bringing them back to
[1:06:57] the original
[1:06:59] well this is a dangerous place whoo
[1:07:03] we just might as well go to work
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:08] hallelujah praise the Lord I'll preach
[1:07:10] myself out in 15 minutes
[1:07:13] amen so so now I want you to think
[1:07:20] he is speaking to this great being
[1:07:26] it's only time we seem called by his
[1:07:28] original name
[1:07:32] but he is actually addressing
[1:07:35] the Babylonian power
[1:07:37] it's what Satan has hit himself and
[1:07:40] worked through
[1:07:41] you want to see that
[1:07:43] that the scripture
[1:07:45] will rarely give you
[1:07:48] a physical description
[1:07:51] of what he looks like
[1:07:53] but he'll tell you what he sounds like
[1:07:57] he'll tell you his characteristics
[1:08:00] because this is how you're going to know
[1:08:02] it he's not going to look the same as he
[1:08:04] did
[1:08:05] back when Isaiah said this
[1:08:08] amen but you'll know him the prophet
[1:08:10] said by his characteristics
[1:08:13] is that right amen and so so now as he's
[1:08:17] addressing this this man Lucifer
[1:08:20] and he's saying
[1:08:22] amen you're not in your original
[1:08:24] position
[1:08:26] you have fallen from heaven
[1:08:30] you used to be the son of the morning
[1:08:34] amen but now you've been cut down to the
[1:08:37] grounds
[1:08:39] your influence has weakened the Nations
[1:08:42] what power
[1:08:43] that he would weaken the Nations
[1:08:46] weakness to keep them from their
[1:08:49] potential
[1:08:50] to keep them from what they were meant
[1:08:52] to be he would weaken them until the
[1:08:55] power that was supposed to be displayed
[1:08:57] through them would come to nothing
[1:09:01] amen and he said the reason you've been
[1:09:04] cut down is you lifted yourself up
[1:09:07] and you lifted yourself up to a place
[1:09:10] that was not yours you are not content
[1:09:13] with where God had placed you so you
[1:09:15] begin to desire something that was not
[1:09:18] given to you
[1:09:20] amen you looked upon your talent and you
[1:09:22] looked upon your gift and you looked
[1:09:25] upon the Perfection of your beauty amen
[1:09:27] but you didn't realize you never got
[1:09:29] that by yourself it was something that
[1:09:32] God gave to you amen and you thought
[1:09:34] that what you were would cause you to
[1:09:37] ascend into this place
[1:09:40] hey man you said that you would be above
[1:09:43] the stars of God Amen you said you would
[1:09:46] sit upon the mount amen of the
[1:09:49] congregation in the sides of the north
[1:09:51] you said you would Ascend to the heights
[1:09:53] of the clouds and I'll be like the most
[1:09:56] high you have said this in your heart
[1:09:58] that you would be like God
[1:10:03] amen you thought you could stay there
[1:10:08] and the Prophet come along and he said
[1:10:11] and he's had great success
[1:10:14] because amen Isaiah says yet you'll be
[1:10:19] brought down to Hell so he he brings him
[1:10:21] to this place of you have risen you have
[1:10:24] come to this place that you have risen
[1:10:26] to but you'll be brought down
[1:10:30] now he never told him he wouldn't rise
[1:10:33] there
[1:10:35] but he told him he would be brought down
[1:10:39] now I want to read out of second
[1:10:41] Thessalonians 2 and you can you can turn
[1:10:44] with me if you will
[1:10:46] laughs
[1:10:50] and I believe
[1:10:51] I believe to our young people
[1:10:54] amen we can preach the full word of God
[1:10:58] amen of our young people if our young
[1:11:00] people can go into the depths of sin and
[1:11:03] go into the the depths of the world and
[1:11:06] Hey listen most of you young people here
[1:11:08] probably know far more than me about
[1:11:09] Electronics or anything else
[1:11:12] your minds
[1:11:14] you're set in a place where
[1:11:17] Brilliance and and smart and intelligent
[1:11:21] and somehow we come to the word we think
[1:11:23] oh we got to be dumb
[1:11:24] we can't understand the word
[1:11:27] see that's Satan because he doesn't want
[1:11:31] you to know
[1:11:37] he wants you to think that you can't
[1:11:39] know
[1:11:42] you can
[1:11:45] second Thessalonians 2 verse 1 now
[1:11:48] I read to you out of Isaiah is it was
[1:11:51] Isaiah because it was out of Isaiah
[1:11:55] amen now second Thessalonians Paul
[1:11:58] he's writing another prophet
[1:12:01] but there costs been hundreds of years
[1:12:02] later now we beseech you brethren
[1:12:05] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:07] and by our gathering together unto him
[1:12:10] that in be not soon shaken in mind
[1:12:16] or be troubled
[1:12:19] neither my spirit
[1:12:21] you know by word or by letter as from us
[1:12:25] even if it's attributed to us
[1:12:28] a letter from US
[1:12:30] as at the day of Christ is at hand let
[1:12:33] no man deceive you by any means
[1:12:35] for that day shall not come except there
[1:12:38] cometh of Falling Away first and that
[1:12:40] man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:12:42] perdition
[1:12:44] notice he said he'll be revealed the son
[1:12:47] of perdition
[1:12:48] who opposes and exalted himself
[1:12:51] above all that is called God you
[1:12:54] understand now the reason I'm reading
[1:12:55] this don't just just don't don't sit
[1:12:57] here this evening and say well well I've
[1:12:59] heard that before I I've read that
[1:13:01] before so I I understand I understand
[1:13:04] that no he is saying I exalt myself
[1:13:06] above all
[1:13:09] so he's exalted himself above your
[1:13:12] experience
[1:13:14] he has exalted himself above your walk
[1:13:18] with the Lord he is telling you it is
[1:13:20] not strong enough
[1:13:22] I will take you and I will turn you hell
[1:13:26] yeah I'll let you sit in this church a
[1:13:27] Christian Life for a while but I'll get
[1:13:30] a hold of you because my strength is
[1:13:33] stronger than yours
[1:13:34] oh but God did not send you down into
[1:13:37] this age Amen to be lost he sent you
[1:13:40] down into this age to be saved Amen to
[1:13:43] prove that that attribute of God is
[1:13:46] still the same yesterday today and
[1:13:48] forever I'm the one that believes is
[1:13:50] that way tonight
[1:13:52] well how do you know brother Danny
[1:13:53] because I've experienced him
[1:13:56] I found out this with God when he speaks
[1:13:58] to you it's going to be from his word if
[1:14:00] it's not from his word it's not God
[1:14:03] you cannot base where you are with God
[1:14:05] on anything else but the word of God
[1:14:08] because if he tells you anything it's
[1:14:10] going to come from here
[1:14:13] 's the difference now amen Jesus said
[1:14:16] Satan or brother Branham said about
[1:14:18] Jesus that said that he said Satan has
[1:14:20] no part in me and I have no part in him
[1:14:23] Satan would like to prove that
[1:14:25] difference
[1:14:28] so he'd like to prove
[1:14:30] that he has a part
[1:14:33] Hallelujah did somebody be revealed
[1:14:37] so he exalteth himself above all that is
[1:14:40] called God or or that is worshiped
[1:14:43] so that he has God
[1:14:45] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[1:14:47] himself that he is God what a fake
[1:14:51] what a liar
[1:14:53] what a Deceiver
[1:14:54] sitting in a place of worship
[1:14:57] being worshiped as God and he's not the
[1:15:00] one amen they think they're worshiping
[1:15:02] right
[1:15:03] what a deception
[1:15:05] hold out to grab our hearts to think
[1:15:08] that something can be so deceiving
[1:15:10] people would look and say well here's
[1:15:12] God
[1:15:14] and he would deceive them that way but
[1:15:17] God said I reveal him
[1:15:21] I reveal him
[1:15:23] you'll find out he's not God he's a son
[1:15:25] of perdition
[1:15:26] him and remember you not when I was yet
[1:15:28] with you I told you these things it says
[1:15:30] there's a thing with a prophet he'll
[1:15:32] tell you he'll tell you what is
[1:15:34] happening he'll tell you how Satan is
[1:15:36] deceiving he'll tell you how he sounds
[1:15:42] amen and know you know and you now you
[1:15:45] know what withholdeth that he might be
[1:15:48] revealed in his time for the mystery of
[1:15:51] iniquity does already work
[1:15:54] only he who now letteth will let until
[1:15:56] he be taken out of the way
[1:15:59] and then shall that Wicked be revealed
[1:16:01] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:16:04] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:16:06] with the brightness of his coming now
[1:16:08] I'm just reading those things and I'm
[1:16:10] taking my time because I feel too much
[1:16:12] at home amen but Satan's purpose amen
[1:16:15] from Eden amen was to make his own self
[1:16:18] in Eden right his own place amen where
[1:16:23] what happened in Eden it was a place of
[1:16:25] Fellowship it was a place amen where God
[1:16:28] came down and he fellowship with this
[1:16:30] man his men and his people had a
[1:16:33] commandment from God to keep it and
[1:16:35] preserve it
[1:16:37] to guard it
[1:16:39] he desired that place because it's the
[1:16:42] highest intimacy
[1:16:44] that there could be between God and man
[1:16:47] and he's looking at this and says I'll
[1:16:49] make myself a needle
[1:16:51] amen and I'll exalt myself above the
[1:16:54] stars of God so that their worship me
[1:16:57] Sons would worship me I don't I can't
[1:17:01] think of anything more degrading than
[1:17:02] sons of God
[1:17:04] worshiping the wrong one
[1:17:09] here Prophet stands in our age he says
[1:17:12] he's absolutely carried it out
[1:17:15] it's what he's done and he's brought it
[1:17:17] to the church
[1:17:18] amen he said and that's exactly the hour
[1:17:21] we're living in and as Satan has done it
[1:17:25] he's done it through educational
[1:17:27] programs he's done it through a better
[1:17:29] fit what is a better fit a better fit is
[1:17:32] something that is more to my likes I
[1:17:34] find a church I find a place of worship
[1:17:36] that that more lines up with how I think
[1:17:39] worship should be amen so he Satan will
[1:17:42] provide that for you if you want all
[1:17:44] inclusion he'll be all inclusive if
[1:17:47] you're if you're a legalist here be a
[1:17:49] legalist he'll be whatever you want to
[1:17:51] be
[1:17:53] you find that taste for you
[1:17:56] amen and so he said it's a better fit
[1:17:58] it's better this it's better that and
[1:18:00] not knowing all the time walking right
[1:18:02] into death oh we're a blessed people
[1:18:04] tonight amen blinded leading the blind
[1:18:07] blind leaders of Nations blind leaders
[1:18:09] of science
[1:18:10] blind leaders of the church let me say
[1:18:13] it again blind leaders of the nation
[1:18:15] blind leaders of science blind leaders
[1:18:18] of the church Jesus said let them alone
[1:18:21] they're falling the ditch
[1:18:23] he said you notice now two eat and so
[1:18:25] close together till they almost deceive
[1:18:28] the very elected so don't sit here and
[1:18:31] think okay amen I've got this figured
[1:18:33] out and and I can read what has been
[1:18:35] said and so I will not be deceived
[1:18:37] almost deceive the very elected there'd
[1:18:41] be only one thing that will stop you
[1:18:43] from not being deceived and that is
[1:18:46] called election
[1:18:48] thank you
[1:18:51] you understand that this is also what
[1:18:54] exposes Satan
[1:18:56] because Satan himself he hates amen the
[1:19:00] revelation of election
[1:19:03] because he's never been able to overturn
[1:19:05] it
[1:19:06] he has sent he has seen men and women go
[1:19:10] so far that he begin to relax
[1:19:14] amen and Danny election
[1:19:18] amen begin to have a voice
[1:19:21] book of redemption was still being read
[1:19:23] I want you to know tonight the book of
[1:19:26] redemption is still being read and
[1:19:29] there's still people that God Amen is
[1:19:31] pulling into his kingdom
[1:19:39] am I yelling too loud Brother David
[1:19:42] you know in the Mennonite church we
[1:19:43] didn't get the opportunity to do this
[1:19:45] I'm taking opportunity to do it
[1:19:48] you know everybody's on YouTube today
[1:19:49] even the church we came out of I don't
[1:19:51] know why they would put it on
[1:19:53] because there's well somebody will like
[1:19:56] it Hallelujah
[1:19:59] better fit
[1:20:03] amen so now amen this is what Satan
[1:20:06] hates he hates election
[1:20:09] because he knows it'll expose him
[1:20:11] brother man said amen here we notice two
[1:20:14] types of Eden so close together till
[1:20:16] almost deceive the very elected
[1:20:20] Matthew 24 24 said it would be that way
[1:20:23] and he identified that that's exactly
[1:20:25] the hour we're living in now is Matthew
[1:20:28] 24 24. he said but I want us to stop and
[1:20:32] consider these two Edens
[1:20:34] one thing especially how the Bible tells
[1:20:37] us that God's word did produce that Eden
[1:20:40] and how God
[1:20:42] warns that that other Eden would come
[1:20:47] so there's got to be another Eden
[1:20:49] oh we know this is where we're at
[1:20:53] the Baptist Church
[1:20:55] the Catholic Church
[1:20:57] the denominational world
[1:20:59] not one of them produced a Satan's Eden
[1:21:01] message
[1:21:03] none of them preached that
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:08] but God's voice
[1:21:10] preach Satan's Eden
[1:21:12] and now brother Branham proceeds to read
[1:21:15] the scripture we just read to you II
[1:21:16] Thessalonians 1. and he said or two
[1:21:19] verse 1 and on down he said now you
[1:21:21] think of it
[1:21:22] now Isaiah 14.
[1:21:25] the prophet said he saw Lucifer in his
[1:21:27] heart
[1:21:29] through a vision under inspiration of
[1:21:31] God
[1:21:32] saying he would do that
[1:21:34] and in Isaiah 800 years before Paul or
[1:21:38] approximately but now 800 years later
[1:21:41] Paul sees him come to that position
[1:21:44] and it heads up
[1:21:46] his scientific Aiden with his scientific
[1:21:49] world with a scientific bride
[1:21:53] a scientific Church
[1:21:56] all under the word of knowledge
[1:21:59] and they'll tell you that knowledge is
[1:22:00] the word
[1:22:01] great seminaries great degrees
[1:22:04] educational programs you notice Satan's
[1:22:07] not called the god of any other age but
[1:22:09] this age
[1:22:11] so it took him with all that ambition
[1:22:15] to come to this last age and be called
[1:22:19] that
[1:22:20] all the way to the end he has come to
[1:22:24] the desire of his heart
[1:22:26] to be God
[1:22:29] into heaven Eden
[1:22:32] and and the prophet stood in this
[1:22:34] generation and said he's got it
[1:22:39] he has that Eden
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:44] that was his ambition to be worshiped
[1:22:47] like God
[1:22:48] you know
[1:22:50] as we talk about the trail of the
[1:22:52] serpent
[1:22:53] but you'll find that his Trail
[1:22:56] will lead always very close
[1:23:01] to the election
[1:23:04] he's always wherever the election is
[1:23:07] because he knows where the election is
[1:23:09] there's life
[1:23:11] you see in him he wants that life
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:18] he is desired to be worshiped now he's
[1:23:22] being worshiped he's desired to have his
[1:23:24] church he has his church he desires to
[1:23:27] have his Eden he has his Eden but that's
[1:23:31] not his full desire
[1:23:35] I'll be above
[1:23:38] the stars of God
[1:23:41] I will sit in the Mount of the
[1:23:42] congregation
[1:23:44] I will Ascend into your place
[1:23:48] he desires
[1:23:50] the positions
[1:23:52] of sons of God
[1:23:56] now Satan is cruel
[1:24:00] the Bible says he don't open the house
[1:24:02] of his prisoners
[1:24:04] he will not
[1:24:05] provide an escape
[1:24:09] I've never seen an age it's so Afflicted
[1:24:12] it was prophesied that men's Hearts
[1:24:13] would fail with fear
[1:24:15] and we've seen it
[1:24:17] it's afflicting our young
[1:24:19] it's afflicting our old
[1:24:21] this country is is probably the most
[1:24:25] medicated country
[1:24:26] a number of years ago I read that out of
[1:24:28] 300 and something million people in
[1:24:30] America over 120 million of them are our
[1:24:33] men are impaired through drugs
[1:24:36] through some kind of condition
[1:24:38] where they're trying to to medicate a
[1:24:41] position medicate a problem
[1:24:44] something they can't escape
[1:24:46] we've come to that age
[1:24:48] we've come to the age where amen amen we
[1:24:52] wrestle with with great problems of of
[1:24:55] nervous breakdowns and depressions and
[1:24:58] Suicidal Thoughts
[1:25:00] it's coming from his scientific Eden
[1:25:03] right it never that kind of thinking
[1:25:05] never came from God's even it comes from
[1:25:07] the the scientific Eden because the
[1:25:09] human mind was not made to live in that
[1:25:12] even
[1:25:14] we're not made we're not conditioned to
[1:25:16] live in the Eden that Satan makes
[1:25:19] he doesn't create it he perverts it so
[1:25:23] we're not made to live in that
[1:25:25] right and so it keeps us all restless
[1:25:27] and and you know I'm saying oh I'm
[1:25:29] identifying it it keeps us it keeps us
[1:25:32] Restless unsatisfied oh he's looking for
[1:25:36] for for something to to grab our
[1:25:39] attention that's why people can hardly
[1:25:40] sit in church anymore because they have
[1:25:42] to be entertained and they don't they
[1:25:44] can't say it's still long enough to call
[1:25:46] on God and and to pray to have their own
[1:25:49] time with God it's got to be sass it's
[1:25:52] got to be I got to be able to see it I
[1:25:54] got to quickly see what somebody thinks
[1:25:55] about me or oh did they like my pose and
[1:25:58] holy you know it's always rush rush rush
[1:26:00] Satan knows if he can keep you out of
[1:26:03] the sound of the voice of God
[1:26:06] amen because he knows what a prophet
[1:26:08] preached about first a deep call into
[1:26:11] the deep he knows that Jesus stood there
[1:26:13] and said amen if you hunger and thirst
[1:26:16] after righteousness you'll be filled he
[1:26:18] knows what he said so he's trying to get
[1:26:20] your attention
[1:26:23] if I can get it tonight look at that
[1:26:26] crazy preacher up there what does he
[1:26:28] think he's doing jack God you actually
[1:26:30] think to you I'm going to get something
[1:26:31] out of this service
[1:26:33] it does look foolish doesn't it there's
[1:26:35] word for that
[1:26:36] amen by the foolishness of preaching
[1:26:39] souls are saved amen and so God he's
[1:26:43] trying to get your attention
[1:26:46] and so Satan he's keeping you running
[1:26:57] we have young people that
[1:26:59] have given up
[1:27:03] because in their mind they went too far
[1:27:07] there's no hope
[1:27:12] and I can't be free
[1:27:14] brother Danny I've had
[1:27:16] uh hopelessness and torment
[1:27:21] I speak to you as a man I understand
[1:27:25] I understand what it's like to have
[1:27:27] those kind of feelings I want to tell
[1:27:28] you something here tonight
[1:27:30] help of the Lord you can take this home
[1:27:32] with you
[1:27:33] those feelings you feel
[1:27:36] they're not yours
[1:27:38] that torment
[1:27:39] that hopelessness
[1:27:42] that's his
[1:27:49] he's the one on the verge of a nervous
[1:27:51] breakdown because he's sitting in a
[1:27:53] position he can't handle
[1:27:56] that's right that's good he wasn't made
[1:27:59] to be worshiped by everybody come on
[1:28:02] come on imagine
[1:28:04] being that popular with people
[1:28:06] you're not made to be there
[1:28:08] you can't handle it
[1:28:11] it's going to bring you down
[1:28:14] Satan's on the verge of a nervous
[1:28:16] breakdown
[1:28:20] he's full of nervousness he's tormented
[1:28:22] in his nights
[1:28:25] you can't sleep but he can't sleep
[1:28:29] good there you go
[1:28:31] it's his because I want to tell you
[1:28:33] something else young people
[1:28:35] if Satan could have took you and killed
[1:28:37] you
[1:28:39] he'd already done it
[1:28:42] but I find out by the word of God
[1:28:44] he has to have permission for everything
[1:28:50] what kind of King has to ask permission
[1:28:57] oh you might as well help me preach now
[1:28:59] I said what kind of King has to ask
[1:29:03] permission Amen to come against your
[1:29:06] life
[1:29:08] it's a king who is a liar he's lying
[1:29:12] about his position over you
[1:29:16] Jesus said when he speaks anything it's
[1:29:18] a lie so that means anything he tells me
[1:29:21] I can't be saved I'm not a part of God I
[1:29:24] can't get the Holy Ghost I cannot be
[1:29:26] healed amen he is a liar
[1:29:29] it is my job to stand up and say Satan
[1:29:34] you're a liar
[1:29:37] thank you
[1:29:40] good job
[1:29:42] the reason I can get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:45] it's not because you told me I could get
[1:29:46] it it's because God
[1:29:49] has destinated my hour to receive he has
[1:29:53] I want to preach to you this evening he
[1:29:55] has sent me to this age Amen to prove
[1:29:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:30:01] forever he wants to live in me to show
[1:30:04] the enemy his deed and has no power
[1:30:08] position of the son of God
[1:30:15] I'm not asking you Amen to do anything
[1:30:18] but believe
[1:30:20] [Applause]
[1:30:21] that's all I'm asking you to do all I'm
[1:30:24] asking you to do is when the word
[1:30:27] again to identify I want to say
[1:30:29] something else Amen brother Billy God
[1:30:31] wrote this word and this is my Bible
[1:30:37] this is my word it was meant for me it
[1:30:41] was designed for me it was promised to
[1:30:44] me he even said when I come into Christ
[1:30:46] I'm joined Heirs of God
[1:30:49] all that God is I am
[1:30:52] because I'm a part of him
[1:30:55] well then Satan come on come on come on
[1:30:58] shake my hand come on Satan is under my
[1:31:01] feet
[1:31:05] what kind of King is under the feet of
[1:31:10] the people in his Eden
[1:31:17] all that means his lust can't hold you
[1:31:21] up his lies can't hold you drugs can't
[1:31:24] hold you nothing the enemy has designed
[1:31:27] against you can hold you in this house
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:35] blessed be the name of the Lord Satan
[1:31:38] likes to Triumph he likes to flaunt his
[1:31:41] victories
[1:31:43] yeah he likes to parade amen The Lost
[1:31:46] Ones before the people especially
[1:31:48] friends
[1:31:49] so-called Believers people that have
[1:31:51] fallen he likes to parade them
[1:32:02] I got news for you
[1:32:04] I read in the Bible
[1:32:07] amen where the enemy took the heads of
[1:32:09] Saul
[1:32:10] Jonathan and Sons of Saul and they
[1:32:12] pinned him to the walls
[1:32:14] but there are some people that
[1:32:16] Saul had been good too
[1:32:20] we need Brothers like this
[1:32:23] you know I'm not trying to pin anybody's
[1:32:25] head to the wall but the devils
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:31] and then men went up by night and said
[1:32:33] we're not going to allow those heads to
[1:32:34] stay up there as a trophy
[1:32:36] and they recovered those trophies from
[1:32:38] the enemy
[1:32:40] they took him back and gave him Proper
[1:32:42] Burial now the enemy has done that with
[1:32:43] some of ours
[1:32:46] you see there's something called a Roman
[1:32:49] Triumph
[1:32:50] or help me
[1:32:51] everybody looking everyone everybody
[1:32:53] beside you and say help brother Danny
[1:32:56] thank you
[1:32:58] I haven't even started my message this
[1:32:59] is a bad place to be amen
[1:33:04] brother David's praying
[1:33:10] there's a thing called a Roman Triumph
[1:33:12] in the time when Rome was
[1:33:14] at their height of their Glory
[1:33:16] and their generals would be out in their
[1:33:18] campaigns this was not the time of
[1:33:20] social media it'd take years sometimes
[1:33:22] to hear
[1:33:24] get all the news back of everything
[1:33:26] that's happened
[1:33:28] and there's a Roman Triumph where they'd
[1:33:29] have a great Victory maybe maybe this
[1:33:31] General is out there he's fighting for
[1:33:32] Rome and he's he's overcome Britannia or
[1:33:35] Germania or somewhere and he a certain
[1:33:38] tribe and he
[1:33:39] takes captives
[1:33:41] and the Roman Triumph is when they've
[1:33:43] sent word ahead that we've won the
[1:33:45] battle now
[1:33:47] these people worshiped
[1:33:50] these men these were their Stars
[1:33:54] and they would come back and if it was a
[1:33:57] big campaign it might took years they
[1:33:59] said the Roman Triumph could take two to
[1:34:01] three days
[1:34:03] of them parading All The Spoils of War
[1:34:06] down the Main Avenue of Rome
[1:34:09] showing them the great Victory they had
[1:34:11] and they would bring these carts
[1:34:14] carts of
[1:34:16] weapons that they had recovered from the
[1:34:18] battlefield the weapons that that their
[1:34:21] enemy had used and they would put all
[1:34:23] these on the cart and show
[1:34:26] show
[1:34:28] they're people their weapons weren't
[1:34:30] good enough
[1:34:32] then they'd bring behind them the
[1:34:34] captives leaving the highest ranks the
[1:34:38] captains the generals the Chiefs the
[1:34:41] leaders
[1:34:42] bring them in Chains
[1:34:44] it's quite a spectacle
[1:34:47] bring all these Vanquish people
[1:34:49] for this great power
[1:34:53] and they were showing that they're the
[1:34:55] masters of the world
[1:34:59] and appearing at the last would be the
[1:35:01] general he would be in his carriage
[1:35:04] and everybody would be screaming and
[1:35:06] hollering
[1:35:08] and screaming and
[1:35:11] adoration for this great champion
[1:35:15] and he would be in his best clothes he'd
[1:35:18] be in gold and the people would be
[1:35:21] screaming worshiping and they knew that
[1:35:24] that worship could get so high
[1:35:26] that that man would begin to think he's
[1:35:29] something he's not
[1:35:30] so they'd put a Slave
[1:35:32] right behind him
[1:35:35] and he'd be whispering in his ear
[1:35:37] through the whole procession
[1:35:39] remember
[1:35:45] you too
[1:35:47] are man
[1:35:50] because this man would think because I
[1:35:52] have vanquished his people and had such
[1:35:55] a successful campaign
[1:35:57] I could be God
[1:36:01] oh we've come to an age
[1:36:05] where he is paraded
[1:36:09] he has paraded failure
[1:36:12] before
[1:36:13] the people
[1:36:15] he's paraded friends
[1:36:18] people you know
[1:36:21] people that held the same Bible you held
[1:36:26] the same weapons
[1:36:30] same weapons
[1:36:31] of war that we use
[1:36:34] same message
[1:36:37] it didn't work
[1:36:40] it didn't work and oh how Satan loves
[1:36:43] to pile up their words
[1:36:46] and their some of these folks could give
[1:36:48] good testimonies and he loves to pile it
[1:36:50] up
[1:36:52] and parade it before you
[1:36:54] that's right you see it isn't going to
[1:36:55] work
[1:36:57] it isn't going to work
[1:37:01] here's this General
[1:37:03] it could be God
[1:37:05] look at this war I've won
[1:37:07] I could be God I just want to be that
[1:37:09] guy behind him
[1:37:14] here stands up Isaiah and said now
[1:37:16] listen
[1:37:18] is this the man
[1:37:20] right come on this guy's nothing but a
[1:37:23] man
[1:37:24] all right
[1:37:27] he has acted in this age like he's he's
[1:37:30] uh invincible
[1:37:33] he's acted like his arguments are
[1:37:35] actually right
[1:37:37] he actually wants to tell you that the
[1:37:39] Vindication was not real
[1:37:42] well you know it wasn't real he man he's
[1:37:45] got so many bruises
[1:37:51] you know how many prayer lines he's been
[1:37:52] cast out of yeah
[1:37:54] brother Branham lined him up it goes
[1:37:57] down the road boom boom boom boom boom
[1:37:58] boom boom boom boom call them by name
[1:38:02] and that was minor
[1:38:05] that's right brother said Divine Healing
[1:38:07] was minor that's right those those
[1:38:08] things were minor and this minor saying
[1:38:11] so I'm the winner I'm the winner Here
[1:38:12] Comes The Miner right right come on now
[1:38:15] come on you live on so and so and your
[1:38:19] name is so and so and you've been
[1:38:20] thinking this and you have this problem
[1:38:22] and you got that problem oh and this
[1:38:24] Spirit over here is called out it's got
[1:38:25] the same problem over here I want to
[1:38:27] tell the devil this evening you are just
[1:38:30] a man you don't have the power you think
[1:38:33] you have your Trail is of the serpent
[1:38:37] it's not God
[1:38:41] he said why are you preaching like that
[1:38:42] brother Danny you just you're just
[1:38:43] trying to be emotional you're trying to
[1:38:44] get me stirred up well you know
[1:38:46] sometimes getting you stirred up is half
[1:38:48] the problem
[1:38:53] amen because you know very rarely
[1:38:55] anymore do people come half hour ahead
[1:38:58] of time and begin to pray and begin to
[1:39:00] read their Bible
[1:39:01] we rush in and we rush out and then
[1:39:03] we're not sure if we actually heard God
[1:39:05] or not
[1:39:07] and if somehow the message would touch
[1:39:10] on your life amen the enemy would say
[1:39:12] well that way they want you
[1:39:14] well he is a liar
[1:39:19] and praise the Lord
[1:39:22] huh
[1:39:23] it's his hopelessness Jesus said when he
[1:39:25] speaketh Allah he speaks of his own for
[1:39:28] he is a liar and he is the father
[1:39:32] of it
[1:39:34] now brother Graham said in Satan's Eden
[1:39:37] that he's had great success
[1:39:39] what is his success in this hour
[1:39:42] explaining
[1:39:44] right
[1:39:45] he is a good talker
[1:39:51] he knows how to explain away the value
[1:39:56] of the word
[1:39:59] and his explanations are so good
[1:40:02] they seems so anointed
[1:40:07] but I found
[1:40:09] I found that in every Exodus
[1:40:13] God
[1:40:15] taught his men
[1:40:16] how to handle snakes
[1:40:22] right
[1:40:24] I want to speak about one for just a
[1:40:26] moment
[1:40:27] and I'm going to ask you if this is all
[1:40:29] right
[1:40:32] let's speak about one
[1:40:35] brother Batman said that amen The Exodus
[1:40:37] the first Sexes that happened down there
[1:40:39] in Egypt he said it came at a specific
[1:40:41] time in history
[1:40:44] right
[1:40:45] God has set times
[1:40:48] yes set times of Deliverance
[1:40:51] and it came at a set time
[1:40:54] and that was what he had told Abraham
[1:40:57] you're be in this country he said then
[1:41:00] after 400 years
[1:41:02] I'll call you out with a mighty hand
[1:41:05] so he said it's a set time
[1:41:08] and then he said and even more
[1:41:10] specifically when the people cried for
[1:41:12] it
[1:41:14] when they cried for deliverance when
[1:41:16] their attitude was set toward it when
[1:41:18] they got tired of slavery
[1:41:22] and then on the other end God was
[1:41:24] working because he knew their desire so
[1:41:26] he would be working on the other end
[1:41:29] because there's a deep calling to the
[1:41:30] deep and he told a backslidden prophet
[1:41:35] he had been preparing him for many years
[1:41:37] in the in the wilderness and he told him
[1:41:40] I've heard their cry
[1:41:44] you know
[1:41:46] you forgive me as I as I talk about this
[1:41:48] but
[1:41:50] God has a way of training his people to
[1:41:53] get ready
[1:41:58] you know God is not like historians that
[1:42:01] are come from a certain country and they
[1:42:03] try to make the country look the best in
[1:42:04] the world and give you all the good
[1:42:05] details God is a different kind of
[1:42:07] historian
[1:42:09] he tells you everything
[1:42:11] about that person and a lot of it
[1:42:12] doesn't it doesn't look good
[1:42:15] I mean you wouldn't like to be told that
[1:42:17] you know ah yeah he lied
[1:42:19] you know brother Danny lied who like you
[1:42:22] would you like that to be told about you
[1:42:23] brother Andrew is Andrew Andrew you know
[1:42:26] he got under come here Andrew I love you
[1:42:28] brother yeah you know here he doesn't he
[1:42:29] look good he's in church and you got to
[1:42:31] type you know he told a lie
[1:42:34] he got in so much pressure
[1:42:36] well that was Abraham
[1:42:41] got in so much pressure he told a lie
[1:42:45] caused his wife to tell one
[1:42:47] thank you brother Andrew look just like
[1:42:49] Abraham
[1:42:50] and and uh
[1:42:53] and then God turned around told that
[1:42:55] King go ask him to pray for you
[1:42:58] it's just unusual it's uncomfortable
[1:43:00] yeah
[1:43:03] you know Moses he was one of the
[1:43:05] smartest men That Ever Walked the Earth
[1:43:08] we can read that in the Bible brother uh
[1:43:11] cosmon that he was learned in all the
[1:43:13] wisdom and and you read history about
[1:43:15] him he was learned in science he was a
[1:43:18] scientist he was he was learned in in uh
[1:43:21] in their religion he was learned at
[1:43:23] everything
[1:43:25] very smart he was mighty the Bible said
[1:43:29] in word and deed he just wasn't ready
[1:43:32] for an exodus
[1:43:34] he was equipped to meet the challenges
[1:43:37] of the world but not the challenge of
[1:43:40] the word
[1:43:42] he had every ability he had
[1:43:51] it but he wasn't ready
[1:43:53] he wasn't ready
[1:43:56] so because he tried to do it through his
[1:43:58] own understanding and he ends up on the
[1:44:01] backside of a desert for 40 years he
[1:44:03] left when he was 40 and he's over in the
[1:44:06] desert for another 40 years and brother
[1:44:07] Branham he has a sense of humor in fact
[1:44:09] he said God must have a sense of humor
[1:44:11] he said
[1:44:12] he said Moses problem was he had a
[1:44:15] temper and he said so God married him to
[1:44:17] a woman who had a temper as bad as his
[1:44:22] I know this don't seem like the trail of
[1:44:24] the serpent to you
[1:44:28] and he said it must have been something
[1:44:33] on the back side of the desert
[1:44:36] when both of their tempers got out of
[1:44:38] him
[1:44:40] oh I don't know a thing about what
[1:44:42] that's like
[1:44:47] can you imagine
[1:44:50] prophet and his wife
[1:44:52] needing therapy
[1:44:56] the man said it must have been something
[1:44:58] you know he said that was God's school
[1:45:00] has that ever felt like school to you
[1:45:02] well some of you young folks you don't
[1:45:04] you ain't gonna know this
[1:45:07] he called that God School
[1:45:10] he was schooling into the mind of Moses
[1:45:14] the program of God that is not your
[1:45:17] ability I need it's you I need yeah
[1:45:21] yeah not your ability
[1:45:23] it's you
[1:45:24] and he said it must have been something
[1:45:26] back there when he's arguing I can
[1:45:27] imagine he's arguing you know Moses he's
[1:45:29] a shepherd and he's he's got the sheep
[1:45:31] and he comes in and you know they're hot
[1:45:34] they're tired he's dirty his sandals are
[1:45:36] dirty she screams at him take his shoes
[1:45:38] off you're getting the rugs dirty in
[1:45:40] here and all this kind of thing and then
[1:45:42] people going by outside listening to him
[1:45:44] fight and it was God getting his Prophet
[1:45:47] ready for an exodus it don't even seem
[1:45:49] like it's possible
[1:45:51] that man is is getting so he's so far
[1:45:55] from God that brother man said all
[1:45:57] faults of Freedom were gone
[1:45:59] he thought God had forgot about him his
[1:46:02] place in The Exodus was gone he's not
[1:46:04] going to be a part of it God's going to
[1:46:06] raise someone else up God hadn't forgot
[1:46:08] him he's just patient
[1:46:13] say it again God hadn't forgotten he's
[1:46:15] just patient
[1:46:17] and you know we think we know God can
[1:46:19] use us when I'm at my best and God says
[1:46:22] I can use you because I'm always at my
[1:46:25] best
[1:46:30] go ask Abraham
[1:46:33] come on
[1:46:34] yeah right I had to get him when he
[1:46:36] finally had lost his own abilities
[1:46:39] that's when I could use him when he gave
[1:46:41] up and said God I can't do it anymore
[1:46:45] here's his Mighty Man a word indeed and
[1:46:47] he gets him in that place
[1:46:50] and Moses for 40 years that's a long
[1:46:52] school I think anybody in here has ever
[1:46:54] took school that long
[1:46:57] School of a prophet's longer than
[1:47:00] you know to be a doctor or something
[1:47:05] after 40 years he's just tottering
[1:47:08] around out there in the wilderness and
[1:47:09] he sees a bush burning up on a mountain
[1:47:12] he says to himself I'm gonna say I ain't
[1:47:13] never seen a burst burn before
[1:47:15] and it's not consumed so he goes over
[1:47:18] there
[1:47:20] and as he gets closer
[1:47:22] a voice speaks to him
[1:47:26] Moses
[1:47:30] take off your shoes
[1:47:33] he's heard that before
[1:47:36] he's had 40 years
[1:47:40] he's had 40 years to hear it from
[1:47:43] another voice
[1:47:46] is he married
[1:47:49] he's had 40 years
[1:47:52] hear someone else tell him take his
[1:47:53] shoes off
[1:47:54] now it was so important that he took him
[1:47:57] off
[1:47:58] the prophet said if he did not respond
[1:48:00] to it he'd never spoke to him again
[1:48:05] you know that's amazing to me that God
[1:48:09] be so patient with the person for 40
[1:48:11] years and then you say this is your
[1:48:12] change
[1:48:15] and I'm going to make it plain to you
[1:48:17] that it's me
[1:48:19] I want to show you something that it'll
[1:48:22] burn and it will not consume it you're
[1:48:23] going to know it's God
[1:48:25] you're going to know
[1:48:28] it's not going to be an imagination
[1:48:31] come on and I'm going to give you an
[1:48:33] experience Moses after that experience
[1:48:35] you can go tell someone else too about
[1:48:37] it and lead them back to the same place
[1:48:43] it's a place that you don't imagine God
[1:48:46] it's a place that you don't walk away
[1:48:49] and wonder if God talked to me it's a
[1:48:51] place that if you come into His presence
[1:48:54] you'll never be the same again
[1:48:58] in five minutes
[1:49:01] right
[1:49:03] come on
[1:49:05] stand up
[1:49:07] Moses
[1:49:08] take your shoes off
[1:49:10] well I love this guy
[1:49:14] he I don't think he kicked him toward
[1:49:15] the bush
[1:49:17] amen
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] um
[1:49:22] I'm gonna take you to school Matt
[1:49:25] now
[1:49:27] Moses had learned obedience by the
[1:49:29] things he suffered
[1:49:35] do you think Moses was enjoying his
[1:49:37] school
[1:49:39] in that hot you know if God is going to
[1:49:42] deal with the temper please lead him to
[1:49:44] the north
[1:49:48] give him some snow
[1:49:50] but he takes him to Dallas
[1:49:54] takes him where it's hot
[1:49:59] scorching living in tents
[1:50:02] The Prince of Egypt living in tents
[1:50:05] I used to speak to multitudes
[1:50:09] no only time I speak is
[1:50:11] hey and they go ah
[1:50:19] prophet deliver
[1:50:22] Prince
[1:50:23] I can barely be a husband
[1:50:29] but I have learned
[1:50:31] to take my shoes off
[1:50:37] something little simple
[1:50:40] to show reverence
[1:50:42] that when I take off my shoes I'm no
[1:50:44] longer walking under my own power
[1:50:48] what I've walked in I'm not walking in
[1:50:49] anymore and I'm approaching a voice
[1:50:54] it's going to tell me what to do now I
[1:50:57] already got the equipment in me to be a
[1:51:00] deliverer I just not been lit
[1:51:05] but my first step toward being lit
[1:51:08] is I took my shoes off yes
[1:51:10] and I approached this service like it's
[1:51:13] my last one
[1:51:16] and God I found out when he began to
[1:51:19] speak he said I have heard the Cry of
[1:51:21] Egypt and I have come down and Moses I
[1:51:23] have not forgot you yes
[1:51:26] I am sending you Hallelujah
[1:51:29] me it can't happen I can't do it
[1:51:33] I I I I I
[1:51:36] oh
[1:51:37] I oh
[1:51:41] I
[1:51:43] they won't believe me
[1:51:50] well you got in your hand Moses
[1:51:53] yeah
[1:51:55] throw it on the ground
[1:52:00] oh
[1:52:02] it turned into a serpent
[1:52:07] into something that God wants to train
[1:52:10] you
[1:52:13] right to how to deal with serpents
[1:52:16] and I love the scripture the Bible says
[1:52:19] he fled
[1:52:21] imagine a prophet running for his life
[1:52:27] I'd love to see it in your socks he ran
[1:52:32] in his he the Bible said he fled
[1:52:36] you know God is so unusual he'll teach
[1:52:38] you certain things that and you know
[1:52:41] here's Moses he he's
[1:52:44] he has been totally equipped in his own
[1:52:46] mind before to just live this message I
[1:52:49] didn't tell you to sat down I read this
[1:52:52] message
[1:52:52] I can do it
[1:52:54] I can do it I want you to know there's
[1:52:57] not one of you equipped in your own
[1:52:59] ability to overcome the enemy and
[1:53:02] produce what this message says there's
[1:53:04] not one of you can live it
[1:53:07] the way the message calls for
[1:53:10] with your own ability no matter how
[1:53:13] you're dressed how clean you look how
[1:53:15] much you worship you do not have the
[1:53:18] ability
[1:53:20] to withstand the serpent you see the
[1:53:22] serpent amen was the representation of
[1:53:25] the power of pharaoh
[1:53:28] and so God says you take this Dead stick
[1:53:30] throw it down and it turns into a
[1:53:32] serpent and the Bible says Moses ran for
[1:53:34] his life he wouldn't say for his life he
[1:53:36] fled from it okay he fled I would have
[1:53:39] loved to seen that because fled means
[1:53:41] he'd kind of lost function
[1:53:43] he's running he's not controlled he's
[1:53:46] out there and God says come back
[1:53:51] I'm back
[1:53:53] Moses comes back praise the Lord
[1:53:56] praise the Lord and stealing his socks
[1:53:59] there's that snake said and Lord you are
[1:54:02] you're you're showing out that's
[1:54:04] something
[1:54:05] I've been carrying that thing for 40
[1:54:07] years I didn't know it could do that
[1:54:09] and God said I'm not done
[1:54:12] now you pick it up
[1:54:15] God knows how to deal
[1:54:17] he knows how to deal with every fear
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:21] hey man I'm going to give you power over
[1:54:23] the serpent he's not asking you to go
[1:54:26] pick up snakes he is telling I'm going
[1:54:28] to deal with your complex I'm going to
[1:54:30] deal with your fear Moses amen I'm going
[1:54:33] to get you to a place you're going to be
[1:54:35] able to walk as an old man into the
[1:54:37] presence of the superpower and believe
[1:54:40] what I have said
[1:54:42] it's the kind of fire god a lot in you
[1:54:45] that you know that when you approach
[1:54:47] that superpower it can't stop you it
[1:54:50] can't hold you he's going to work on
[1:54:52] your behalf and the word you say is what
[1:54:55] he has taught you to say amen amen
[1:55:01] pick it up now the Bible doesn't tell us
[1:55:03] how long it took
[1:55:07] but if it's like you
[1:55:09] oh and sometimes you're in sometimes
[1:55:13] you're out
[1:55:15] God is passionate go pick it up yeah
[1:55:18] Lord can I just come to church and not
[1:55:19] be challenged
[1:55:22] I said pick it up come on I'm wanting
[1:55:24] you to deal with it
[1:55:26] Lord I know I don't like I don't like
[1:55:27] snakes
[1:55:29] I said I want you to deal with it
[1:55:32] well can I can I just come and worship
[1:55:36] I said pick it up
[1:55:41] come on I don't know maybe the Lord let
[1:55:42] us see one day brother Andrew Billy was
[1:55:45] like would you like to pick up a snake
[1:55:46] it may be a gardener amen
[1:55:52] Moses didn't even let anybody to show
[1:55:54] off to
[1:55:56] God
[1:55:58] I'm challenging you
[1:55:59] take your fear
[1:56:02] and pick it up
[1:56:04] and it'll become a stick again
[1:56:06] it'll be inanimate right
[1:56:14] I'm gonna use it to show the devil
[1:56:18] my first step in Victory
[1:56:21] yes somehow he got to it and he'd done
[1:56:24] it
[1:56:26] and then God gave him a disease
[1:56:29] put his hand in come out lepers
[1:56:32] shown in the signs you know
[1:56:36] after all that God showed him of his
[1:56:38] Supernatural
[1:56:41] God says now you go
[1:56:44] and you tell them
[1:56:47] it's time for The Exodus and Moses said
[1:56:50] I can't go
[1:56:52] I'm not gone
[1:56:53] and the reason I'm not going is I can't
[1:56:55] speak
[1:56:58] now from the time of 40 years old at the
[1:57:01] time of 80 he developed a stutter
[1:57:05] he used to be a man Mighty in word
[1:57:07] indeeds but you know them marriages
[1:57:11] when you argue
[1:57:13] I don't know why I'm looking you don't
[1:57:14] know you do
[1:57:17] the stutter was developed from not being
[1:57:19] able to get a word in
[1:57:25] now I
[1:57:27] and he had lost such confidence that in
[1:57:31] the presence of God he said I can't do
[1:57:33] it
[1:57:34] that's right
[1:57:36] and I'm closing this is strange
[1:57:41] I had to wrestle to get here tonight
[1:57:46] but God knows who I'm talking to
[1:57:52] and God said
[1:57:54] I am the one who has made men's mouth I
[1:58:01] will teach you
[1:58:03] what to say
[1:58:08] God can be with you just like he was
[1:58:11] with Moses and a prophet stood in this
[1:58:14] generation says if there's ever a time
[1:58:17] to speak it's now what are you going to
[1:58:20] speak you are going to speak as the
[1:58:22] Oracles of God you are going to say what
[1:58:25] God tells you to say because what you
[1:58:29] say is not going to work but what God
[1:58:31] puts in your mouth will be just like God
[1:58:34] speaking it when it comes from a burning
[1:58:37] bush
[1:58:39] amen now I'm speaking to Sons and
[1:58:41] Daughters of God people whose positions
[1:58:44] Satan cannot Ascend above unless they
[1:58:46] let him
[1:58:47] right
[1:58:49] do you understand the elect is the last
[1:58:51] people that Satan's not above
[1:58:54] even in socks
[1:58:56] amen
[1:58:58] Hallelujah you're a good Moses you look
[1:59:00] like him amen little Charlton Heston
[1:59:03] there
[1:59:09] God
[1:59:11] said I'll be with your mouth
[1:59:15] I'll tell you what to say why do we keep
[1:59:17] speaking back to him and tell him I
[1:59:19] can't do it
[1:59:20] I can't overcome
[1:59:23] I can't I can't do this finish this work
[1:59:25] I I can't I can't be a part of this
[1:59:27] Exodus God said I am with you
[1:59:30] you are going to reveal me in fact your
[1:59:33] enemy is going to say I've never heard
[1:59:35] of of Jehovah but by the time Moses got
[1:59:39] done talking to him not only did they
[1:59:40] know who Jehovah was he had ruined their
[1:59:43] Nation they were no longer a superpower
[1:59:45] they could not hold their families
[1:59:47] anymore they could not stop their
[1:59:49] worship they could not stop their
[1:59:51] children
[1:59:53] that's the God I serve
[1:59:58] oh
[1:59:59] that was just in the first Exodus God
[2:00:01] exposed the trail of the serpent all
[2:00:03] right all right it says you pick him up
[2:00:06] show him he has no power
[2:00:12] no I'm speaking
[2:00:13] to Sons and Daughters of God
[2:00:18] Satan has said I'll Ascend above these
[2:00:20] here in Dallas I'll send above these
[2:00:22] kids there be my trophies
[2:00:24] this meeting's not going to have an
[2:00:26] effect upon them
[2:00:27] I let him get stirred up a little bit
[2:00:29] and then they're going to go back and
[2:00:30] they're going to go right back to the
[2:00:32] same habits and the same things they're
[2:00:33] doing but I want to say this if God lays
[2:00:36] a burden on somebody's heart God will
[2:00:38] have a harvest because he does not call
[2:00:40] a man to preach he doesn't call a church
[2:00:43] to come to an area without God calling
[2:00:45] and having a harvest he will have a
[2:00:48] harvest from this meeting here is going
[2:00:50] to be young people and he'll raise up
[2:00:53] like he did Moses no you won't be the
[2:00:55] prophet but you'll be the prophet's
[2:00:57] expression
[2:01:00] Hallelujah
[2:01:02] you'll be who he saw in this age
[2:01:05] you'll be those ones Walking In step to
[2:01:08] the gospel yeah
[2:01:10] brother thank you you say well what
[2:01:12] about my life what about where I've been
[2:01:14] what about what I've done what about my
[2:01:16] sin what about the trail of the serpents
[2:01:18] being exposed and he cannot hold you
[2:01:20] there
[2:01:22] because I found out that when Isaiah
[2:01:25] said he don't open the house of his
[2:01:26] prisoners I can come right down and read
[2:01:29] in the Bible where amen my Jesus went to
[2:01:33] that prison
[2:01:35] and opened it up
[2:01:39] and took the keys
[2:01:42] of death and Hell
[2:01:44] so the word tells me that that prison
[2:01:47] doesn't have a lock on it anymore right
[2:01:51] so if you choose to stay Bound in that
[2:01:55] lust in that pornography in those things
[2:01:59] you're dabbling in if you choose to stay
[2:02:01] there you're in a prison with no lock
[2:02:03] you chose it
[2:02:06] but my God is here this evening to tell
[2:02:10] you that the god of the burning bush is
[2:02:13] the same Pillar of Fire that has come in
[2:02:16] this hour and he is speaking to this I
[2:02:19] wrestle to get to this service amen but
[2:02:22] God rich in Mercy knew who would be here
[2:02:25] and he knew the serpents hold you gotta
[2:02:28] pick it up and let it know it has no
[2:02:31] power over you come on Moses come on
[2:02:34] Moses pick up that serpent come on Moses
[2:02:39] he cannot stop you I'm going to show you
[2:02:42] there's an exodus coming
[2:02:45] what about you Elders out there come on
[2:02:48] Moses pick it up
[2:02:57] you can stay up
[2:02:59] coward
[2:03:02] somebody lost all the ability and
[2:03:03] thoughts of freedom
[2:03:05] it came rushing back
[2:03:08] I'm still called
[2:03:10] because of God who had called him had
[2:03:13] rejected to him he would not be God
[2:03:16] because God has said in his word I'll
[2:03:19] not lose one
[2:03:21] and I'm here to talk to that one tonight
[2:03:24] yes I said I'll not lose you
[2:03:27] now I want you to know this we're taught
[2:03:30] by a prophecy you come to God you come
[2:03:33] to him amen telling him his promises
[2:03:36] don't come to him telling him how bad
[2:03:38] you are he already knows it you just
[2:03:41] tell him you're sorry for that condition
[2:03:43] and you begin to say and you said in
[2:03:46] your words come now let us reason
[2:03:49] together though your sins are a Scarlet
[2:03:52] they'll be as white as snow God has not
[2:03:55] forgot one word that he said he'll back
[2:03:58] it up
[2:04:00] I went too far brother Danny come now
[2:04:03] yeah you come to him speaking his words
[2:04:05] not yours
[2:04:08] to get his attention
[2:04:10] because you're saying Lord
[2:04:13] I believe that's you that is speaking to
[2:04:16] me
[2:04:17] I believe that's you
[2:04:19] and you've got his attention
[2:04:24] he respond back
[2:04:26] you're not hopeless
[2:04:29] you're not so far out he cannot forgive
[2:04:32] you
[2:04:34] he has promised to
[2:04:37] the worst conditions in scripture he
[2:04:39] sowed I'm God over it
[2:04:44] when when the person we get so far from
[2:04:46] God that religion says give them up God
[2:04:49] says you haven't met me yet
[2:04:53] I'm the god that takes a woman found in
[2:04:56] adultery I'm the god
[2:05:01] that's the god that's here
[2:05:03] that's the god who's speaking through me
[2:05:06] that's the god who's responding from you
[2:05:09] he's that God
[2:05:12] you take off your shoes now
[2:05:15] reverence him
[2:05:17] you tell him I believe
[2:05:21] you see people don't wait for God to
[2:05:23] speak back to him
[2:05:25] we all want to feel him we all want to
[2:05:27] Rejoice we all want to shout will you
[2:05:30] let him speak to you yes
[2:05:33] he will
[2:05:36] I remember when he called me to the
[2:05:37] ministry 37 years ago he called me and I
[2:05:40] was in prayer do you know you'll find
[2:05:42] God In Prayer
[2:05:44] you'll find him in prayer and I was in
[2:05:46] prayer and God spoke to me he says
[2:05:48] you're going to preach
[2:05:50] and I said no
[2:05:53] you know that we're human I said no I
[2:05:56] don't I don't want to do it I don't want
[2:05:57] to do it I was 17 years old
[2:06:02] and he only spoke to me
[2:06:05] two scriptures he said acts 5
[2:06:08] 19.
[2:06:10] he's gone
[2:06:12] I want to say if God does anything for
[2:06:14] you
[2:06:15] 'll find it in the word
[2:06:18] if it's God
[2:06:20] it'll be in the word I didn't know what
[2:06:23] that scripture was
[2:06:25] you know it's not that I hadn't heard it
[2:06:26] just when he said it to me I didn't know
[2:06:28] what it was can I tell you it
[2:06:31] because I'm just trying to encourage you
[2:06:33] that he'll give you a word experience
[2:06:38] and you'll find out that it was God
[2:06:41] speaking to me and when it's God because
[2:06:43] you need it
[2:06:45] when it comes to those times Satan's
[2:06:47] going to question everything about you
[2:06:48] you've got to turn and say but it was
[2:06:50] him
[2:06:52] it was him that called me
[2:06:55] it was him and so I didn't know what
[2:06:58] this what the scripture was and I turned
[2:07:00] back to it and it said here in Acts 5 19
[2:07:03] but the angel of the Lord by Night
[2:07:05] opened the prison doors and brought them
[2:07:07] forth and said go and stand and speak in
[2:07:09] the temple to the people all the words
[2:07:11] of this life his word
[2:07:14] turn my no
[2:07:16] into a yes
[2:07:20] the difference is it hasn't made it easy
[2:07:25] but he's with me
[2:07:27] and he never promised that your road
[2:07:30] would be easy right
[2:07:34] but he promised I'd be with you yes
[2:07:37] and you just remember
[2:07:39] when God come and spoke to you tonight
[2:07:42] that it was him
[2:07:44] that was speaking to you
[2:07:46] and you can turn into the enemy and say
[2:07:48] you can't take that from me
[2:07:51] amen do you know you know we sing the
[2:07:55] song Oh taste and see that the Lord is
[2:07:57] good
[2:07:58] do you know when that song was written
[2:08:01] David wrote that song after he came out
[2:08:04] of the the city of philistia where he
[2:08:07] had joined himself to the Philistines
[2:08:11] because he was on the run from Saul
[2:08:13] he joined and he's there and some of the
[2:08:16] princes they're getting ready to go to
[2:08:18] war with Israel and some of them princes
[2:08:19] look at him says now is not this that
[2:08:22] man
[2:08:23] that they sang songs about
[2:08:26] is this not the one that they sung he's
[2:08:28] killed his thousands
[2:08:31] and David began to fear for his life
[2:08:33] because he was not supposed to be down
[2:08:36] in philistia
[2:08:37] he is supposed to be there in Israel
[2:08:39] where he's he's born
[2:08:42] where he's elected to be king
[2:08:45] and you're not supposed to be in
[2:08:46] Felicity either
[2:08:49] he looks at you like aren't you supposed
[2:08:51] to be over here
[2:08:54] and David changed himself into a Madman
[2:08:57] and scrambled on the door let me out of
[2:08:59] here and spit running down his face
[2:09:01] because he was afraid for his life and
[2:09:03] they sent him out and he went up to the
[2:09:05] caves and he wrote this song Oh taste
[2:09:07] and see that the Lord is good
[2:09:11] she realized God had spared his life and
[2:09:14] I want to just say young people God Gave
[2:09:16] You hunger not to go satisfied on
[2:09:18] anything else
[2:09:19] but he gave hunger to you to take you
[2:09:23] further into the Realms of God Take You
[2:09:26] Higher and take you higher hunger that's
[2:09:29] dimensional Take You Higher and Higher
[2:09:32] into the things of God oh taste and see
[2:09:35] that the Lord is good
[2:09:39] we get too heavy
[2:09:42] we lie too many things to pull us down
[2:09:45] and you can come and have a good service
[2:09:46] and you go right back out heavy and go
[2:09:49] right back to the same habits
[2:09:52] let those things go now
[2:09:56] and let him give you everything
[2:09:59] give you everything stand with me
[2:10:02] everybody stand with me
[2:10:05] I wonder if we have a Moses here tonight
[2:10:09] want to lift a hand say God you spoke to
[2:10:11] me
[2:10:12] might not have been a burning bush but
[2:10:14] it was through a preacher you spoke to
[2:10:16] my heart there's a lot of hands went off
[2:10:19] you mean that
[2:10:21] amen you believe that's God to spoke to
[2:10:23] you
[2:10:24] well if he did he didn't speak to you to
[2:10:26] leave
[2:10:28] just to leave
[2:10:30] what's now just talk to your heart
[2:10:33] let him speak forgiveness
[2:10:36] let him speak love
[2:10:39] don't think about what the enemy has
[2:10:41] done now
[2:10:43] think about his love
[2:10:46] let's close our eyes and bow our heads

[2:11:00] wanting to go this way
[2:11:03] but you're rich in Mercy Lord
[2:11:06] you make it uncomfortable for preachers
[2:11:10] because she loved your children so much
[2:11:13] do you want to reach a heart
[2:11:17] Maybe
[2:11:19] they've listened to the LIE of the enemy
[2:11:22] he and me told them you can't be free

[2:11:29] say I believe

[2:20:04] you've been in a jail cell and there's
[2:20:07] no luck
[2:20:09] and all you do by faith you just gotta
[2:20:11] reach out and push that door open
[2:20:15] whom the son has made free
[2:20:19] is free
[2:20:21] indeed
[2:20:25] a Roman Triumph
[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:28] parading around all that had been
[2:20:30] defeated
[2:20:31] I got a little inspired
[2:20:35] I think there's such thing called a
[2:20:37] bride Triumph
[2:20:39] cause I know what I was
[2:20:41] I know when I was in bondage too I know
[2:20:45] the sin I know the alcohol I know the
[2:20:48] drugs I know the lust I know the
[2:20:51] pornography
[2:20:53] but I heard my name
[2:20:55] was written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:20:58] and it says son I've given you the
[2:21:02] victory over every one of those Devils
[2:21:06] if you'll just take me at my word
[2:21:09] you're my son you're my attribute you're
[2:21:13] more than a conqueror cause I've made
[2:21:15] you an overcomer
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:18] I'm teaching you how to fight take that
[2:21:21] thing
[2:21:23] no longer devil
[2:21:25] I'm tired of it
[2:21:28] you don't have to leave here tonight
[2:21:31] still in bondage
[2:21:34] look don't don't leave tonight still in
[2:21:36] bondage
[2:21:37] don't wait
[2:21:39] for Saturday night
[2:21:42] Saturday night might never come
[2:21:45] but what you do have
[2:21:48] it's right now
[2:21:50] and maybe something inside of you says I
[2:21:53] want to have a bride Triumph
[2:21:56] that devil that's been trying to ruin my
[2:21:58] life
[2:22:00] trying to exalt himself above the stars
[2:22:03] of God
[2:22:05] trying to put him in himself in a
[2:22:06] position that's not given to him
[2:22:10] you know what has been given to the
[2:22:12] bride
[2:22:13] is to put that devil
[2:22:15] under your feet
[2:22:18] yeah it starts with a little humility
[2:22:22] taking off your shoes and saying Lord
[2:22:25] I'm in the presence of God
[2:22:28] and now what did he start to do he
[2:22:30] started to listen to what he was saying
[2:22:32] what is it that's in your hand
[2:22:36] what is it in your hand
[2:22:38] I don't know what it is
[2:22:41] but whatever's in your hand
[2:22:43] you give it to God
[2:22:45] you don't have to be a preacher you
[2:22:48] don't have to be a song leader you don't
[2:22:51] have to you don't have to have position
[2:22:52] you don't you don't have to have some
[2:22:54] some something where people are looking
[2:22:56] you don't have to all you have to have
[2:22:58] is to know that you're a son and
[2:23:01] daughter of God
[2:23:03] and you take that faith
[2:23:06] because what did he say he said election
[2:23:09] predestination exposes
[2:23:14] it exposes the wicked one
[2:23:17] well what does that mean brother Matthew
[2:23:19] your election brought you to the house
[2:23:21] of God tonight
[2:23:25] it's exposing the devil because he
[2:23:27] didn't want you to be here
[2:23:29] but something predestinated you
[2:23:33] to be here tonight
[2:23:37] exposing the devil he can't keep you
[2:23:40] he can't have the victory over you
[2:23:44] now what are you gonna do you have a
[2:23:46] choice to mate
[2:23:48] are you gonna stay in that prison cell
[2:23:53] are you gonna push it open

[2:24:01] God
[2:24:02] chance

[2:24:07] given the world so much of your time and
[2:24:09] so much of your effort what has it done

[3:02:45] friends

[3:02:52] [Music]
[3:02:57] all right I pray
[3:03:02] [Music]
[3:03:26] and it's greatness
[3:03:31] I believe the Lord certainly spoke test
[3:03:33] didn't it
[3:03:35] you know
[3:03:36] we were told about a devil
[3:03:40] that
[3:03:43] shuts his prison doors
[3:03:46] and that the brother spoke that in
[3:03:49] brought my heart
[3:03:51] to a scripture found in Luke
[3:03:54] in the fourth chapter in the 17th verse
[3:03:59] and it says there was delivered unto him
[3:04:02] the book
[3:04:03] of the prophet Isaiah
[3:04:07] and when he had opened the book
[3:04:10] he found the place
[3:04:12] where it was written yeah
[3:04:15] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[3:04:19] because he hath anointed me
[3:04:22] to preach the gospel to the poor
[3:04:26] he hath sent me to heal
[3:04:30] the Brokenhearted
[3:04:32] to preach Deliverance
[3:04:34] to the captives
[3:04:37] and recovering the sight of the blind
[3:04:41] to set at Liberty
[3:04:43] them that are birds
[3:04:46] you know our brother made a statement to
[3:04:48] my tonight could you play that song
[3:04:51] There is a blood
[3:04:53] Julia you know that song
[3:04:56] [Music]
[3:04:59] he made a statement tonight no matter
[3:05:01] how hard you try
[3:05:03] you can't do it
[3:05:07] no matter how hard the preachers pray
[3:05:10] [Music]
[3:05:12] no matter how
[3:05:13] [Music]
[3:05:14] much they lay their hands on you
[3:05:19] the difference is the blood
[3:05:22] [Music]
[3:05:24] the difference is because one came
[3:05:29] and he paid a price
[3:05:32] for your deliverance
[3:05:34] [Music]
[3:05:36] and the prison door may be unlocked
[3:05:41] but sometimes you're just too bruised to
[3:05:44] open it
[3:05:45] [Music]
[3:05:48] but he came
[3:05:52] and
[3:05:53] it's him yes thank you Lord that's
[3:05:57] what's so beautiful about it all
[3:06:00] I know what it's like to be so lost you
[3:06:03] can't find your way
[3:06:07] to be so imprisoned
[3:06:10] and so addicted
[3:06:14] that there was nothing
[3:06:19] that I could do
[3:06:22] [Music]
[3:06:24] but I was purchased
[3:06:27] by a blood
[3:06:31] and
[3:06:34] I wouldn't want to go tonight
[3:06:39] wonderful for the believer to be
[3:06:42] delivered
[3:06:44] it's wonderful for those who know
[3:06:49] him
[3:06:50] and are not where they're supposed to be
[3:06:53] to rededicate their life
[3:06:57] but it's something totally different
[3:07:00] for them who don't know him
[3:07:05] who are on the outside
[3:07:08] and they're lost
[3:07:11] only he can do that
[3:07:15] and I don't know tonight if there's one
[3:07:18] here
[3:07:20] that doesn't know him
[3:07:27] they they know that he's not
[3:07:31] dwelling
[3:07:32] in them
[3:07:37] not that you know him and you haven't
[3:07:39] done or you've done wrong
[3:07:41] maybe someone that doesn't even know
[3:07:43] what wrong and right is
[3:07:44] [Music]
[3:07:48] but they know they're not
[3:07:50] with God
[3:07:52] and they know they're not right with God
[3:07:57] and they know they're lost
[3:07:58] [Music]
[3:08:02] those little ones I wanted to tell you
[3:08:05] tonight there's a blood
[3:08:08] there's something that made it possible
[3:08:10] for you to walk out those doors
[3:08:14] it's not by will not by might but by my
[3:08:18] spirit
[3:08:19] saith the Lord there was a price paid
[3:08:25] and he said I'll meet you there I'll
[3:08:27] meet you under that blood
[3:08:29] [Music]
[3:08:32] so if you go out tonight and
[3:08:36] you've determined in your mind that
[3:08:38] you're not going to do it you've done
[3:08:40] you've made up your mind tonight's been
[3:08:43] different
[3:08:47] when that enemy comes back and starts to
[3:08:49] suck you back into it I want you to
[3:08:51] remember one thing there's a blood
[3:08:55] there is a blood there was a price that
[3:08:59] was paid there was a life laid down for
[3:09:02] you
[3:09:04] and you can look to that person
[3:09:07] and say Lord I need you
[3:09:09] I need your help
[3:09:11] I need you to do this for me I want to
[3:09:15] be free but I can't go free
[3:09:18] Lord you purchased me there's a blood
[3:09:21] and that's what makes the difference
[3:09:23] tonight
[3:09:24] that's blood is what allows his Spirit
[3:09:27] to come unto you because it cleanses you
[3:09:30] from all unrighteousness just want you
[3:09:33] to donate
[3:09:34] [Music]
[3:09:36] if you know that
[3:09:39] you're away from him
[3:09:44] all you can simply do is say Lord I know
[3:09:48] I'm away from you I know I need you
[3:09:53] I've got to have you in my life I want
[3:09:56] you in my life
[3:09:58] I don't know how to pray
[3:10:01] I don't know how to act I don't know
[3:10:04] what to do
[3:10:06] [Music]
[3:10:08] but there is three words
[3:10:13] just three little thoughts
[3:10:15] that made all the difference in my life
[3:10:20] I said God to help me
[3:10:23] God help me
[3:10:25] I don't know what I am
[3:10:28] but I'm not this
[3:10:29] [Music]
[3:10:34] from that point on it was up to him
[3:10:37] I could do nothing
[3:10:40] and we can't do nothing without him
[3:10:43] so I want to close tonight
[3:10:47] with this song
[3:10:50] and I want you when you leave this
[3:10:52] [Music]
[3:10:54] place tonight I want you to know that
[3:10:56] there was somebody that
[3:10:59] went to Calvary
[3:11:02] he had Nails driven in his hands
[3:11:05] he was scourged and his side was
[3:11:09] pierced
[3:11:11] so that door could be open
[3:11:15] and you owe
[3:11:18] everything
[3:11:19] [Music]
[3:11:20] to him
[3:11:22] and he loves you
[3:11:23] [Music]
[3:11:25] that's why he died for you no greater
[3:11:28] love hath than man
[3:11:30] than to lay down his life and God so
[3:11:34] loved the world that he gave his only
[3:11:36] begotten son
[3:11:38] so as we
[3:11:40] go tonight
[3:11:43] rejoicing in the word of God knowing
[3:11:46] that we've been set free let's not
[3:11:49] forget
[3:11:50] what set us free
[3:11:52] it wasn't our ability to push that door
[3:11:55] open and it wasn't our ability to walk
[3:11:58] out it was that there was a price paid
[3:12:01] and a power given the gift of God
[3:12:04] blessed any man should boast
[3:12:08] the wonderful love
[3:12:10] [Music]
[3:12:11] all can you imagine
[3:12:14] when we can reach the Lost
[3:12:19] Lord help us
[3:12:20] reach the loss May that blood shine in
[3:12:24] our life into the person that I'm
[3:12:27] talking to and they know I'm talking to
[3:12:29] them
[3:12:30] I want you to know that there's a blood
[3:12:34] there's a Jesus
[3:12:36] that died
[3:12:38] and that's your only hope
[3:12:40] it's your only strength it's the only
[3:12:44] thing that can help you
[3:12:47] don't be afraid to ask him
[3:12:50] to touch you
