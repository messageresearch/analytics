[12:47] giving you thanksgiving lord just want
[12:49] to
[12:50] invite you to come amongst us once again
[12:52] lord and speak to our heart
[12:54] lord we're so grateful that you've shown
[12:57] us in this evil age how to overcome
[13:00] knowing that it's not in ourselves lord
[13:02] but
[13:04] that your word has come and it's exposed
[13:06] to the devil and revealed the son of
[13:08] perdition but in doing that you've
[13:10] revealed the son of man which is christ
[13:12] the hope of glory living in your brain
[13:15] and that's how we overcome is
[13:17] recognizing that you are greater because
[13:20] greater is he that is in us than he that
[13:22] is in the world
[13:23] lord jesus as your prophet said and
[13:26] pointed out that you were able to
[13:28] recognize yourself in the word and have

[13:39] are bone of your bone and we're flesh of
[13:41] your flesh and life of your life and
[13:43] power of your power
[13:45] lord then if you came and revealed those
[13:47] things to us then we can start to have
[13:49] faith in what you made us lord that we
[13:51] can do the greater works that we can
[13:54] speak to the mountain that we don't have
[13:56] to cry but we can speak the word lord
[13:58] that we're coming into the the
[14:00] manifestation of the sons of god and uh
[14:02] realizing who we really are in you lord
[14:05] what a great hour this is lord we're
[14:06] thankful that we sit right now in the
[14:10] realms where all things are possible
[14:12] because you've given us a faith to
[14:14] believe all things lord and you've given
[14:16] us a perfect word to produce a perfect
[14:19] faith which is putting us into a perfect
[14:21] rapture oh how thankful we are lord how
[14:24] excited we are to live in the
[14:26] culmination of all things right now at
[14:28] this time and lord as we come in the
[14:30] evening time tonight

[38:41] that overcome i i will grant to sit with
[38:45] me in my throne every night also
[38:47] overcome and sat down with my father in
[38:50] his throne he that has an ear
[38:53] let him hear
[38:55] what the spirit says
[38:57] unto the churches amen and one more
[39:00] scripture john chapter 21
[39:04] i think verse 17
[39:08] 17.
[39:14] he says unto him
[39:17] in the third pool
[39:19] in the third time
[39:22] simon son of the dove
[39:25] lovers tell me
[39:28] peters was grieved because he said unto
[39:31] him the third time lovers told me
[39:34] and he said unto him lord thou knowest
[39:36] all things
[39:37] thou knows that i love thee
[39:40] jesus said unto him
[39:42] feed my
[39:44] sheep may the lord as the blessing of
[39:46] the living if you can take out our we
[39:48] can take our seeds
[39:51] amen
[39:52] thank you thank you
[39:54] so how can i overcome
[39:56] in this morning we we start our journey
[39:59] to
[40:01] point it to
[40:04] to find out
[40:07] to remember
[40:08] because everything what is for us
[40:11] necessary to step in another dimension
[40:14] we already received it
[40:16] in the form of a message
[40:19] a man
[40:20] of an hour so
[40:21] every all the inspiration we have it is
[40:24] only from
[40:25] this message and once you see the
[40:29] message
[40:30] all the rest became a filler
[40:34] once
[40:34] you see the message
[40:37] once you see
[40:39] you see
[40:41] not understand
[40:43] what once you see
[40:45] you always see
[40:47] and the rest will be a filler
[40:50] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[40:52] find out that
[40:53] the first step
[40:55] to overcome
[40:58] first of all the prophet said
[41:00] we must
[41:02] have a dream of god
[41:05] this is what he just said the light in
[41:07] you is god he knew this is the gene of
[41:11] god the gene of god in 1464 and 65 he
[41:15] intro the prophet used a terminology
[41:18] actually
[41:19] it is not us that we reinvent english
[41:23] the prophet did it
[41:25] because he has to create new words
[41:28] because this message is a new song
[41:32] so he has to create english words
[41:35] because we have a new song
[41:37] as this new song is the message of the
[41:39] hour
[41:41] can you say amen
[41:42] amen blessed be the name of the lord so
[41:45] in 64 the lord
[41:47] really wanted us to know
[41:49] before nobody nobody will speak about
[41:52] these things that there is a gene
[41:56] a gene god has a gene
[41:58] god has a seed
[42:00] it is not the seed of jesus
[42:02] it is jesus didn't had seed after
[42:05] natural his natural body but we are the
[42:08] seed seeds of christ
[42:11] amen seeds of christ
[42:14] sons of light
[42:15] sons of god
[42:17] we are living in the manifestation of
[42:19] the sons
[42:21] in the revelation of the sons
[42:24] we are not anymore in the pentecostal
[42:25] age
[42:27] that's finished
[42:29] since the opening of the world we have
[42:30] the world and the world world
[42:33] world only
[42:35] invisible union
[42:38] so we must have we must be we must
[42:42] it's also important for god to
[42:44] let us know to inform us
[42:47] that we are we have in our
[42:51] world of our hearts a gene
[42:54] coming from the pillar of fire club
[42:57] global tongues
[42:59] with your name written on it
[43:02] a cloven tongue
[43:04] with your name written
[43:06] on it
[43:08] you are a problem tongue you are a light
[43:12] apart because of the day of pentacles we
[43:14] just had pentecost was god dividing
[43:20] himself
[43:22] god dividing himself so first steps
[43:24] first thing that
[43:25] the
[43:26] the the message revealed to us
[43:29] making us aware
[43:31] is from the beginning you are an eagle
[43:34] you have never been another species
[43:37] because the species you cannot change
[43:41] that's why only
[43:42] only the seed of god can be rebirthed
[43:46] he didn't say born again
[43:49] he said reborn
[43:51] in order to be reborn have nothing to do
[43:53] with the flesh
[43:55] to be reborn is
[43:57] to be born again from this message
[44:00] we need to be reborn from this message
[44:04] spoken word is the original seed
[44:08] and there must be an or an original womb
[44:11] an eternal womb
[44:14] that can match
[44:16] hallelujah so first step that we find
[44:19] out that we are we have
[44:24] we contain
[44:25] a gene
[44:28] so every morning you
[44:29] can have a revival
[44:32] hallelujah so the same things we realize
[44:36] what we just find out from how can i
[44:40] overcome
[44:41] because this is in this coming
[44:44] of the lord in the bright form
[44:47] he came in a bright form
[44:50] in your form
[44:53] that should make us happy
[44:55] we are the most happiest people on earth
[44:58] because he's hiding against under skin
[45:01] [Music]
[45:03] i am happy on this
[45:05] that make me happy
[45:07] yeah so we
[45:09] then he said we must have his faith
[45:12] or his revelation
[45:14] maybe i can have proverbs chapter 3
[45:17] verse 5
[45:18] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5.
[45:21] this faith is not an intellectual faith
[45:26] trust in the lord with all your
[45:30] with all your gene
[45:32] so in the seed in the gene you have
[45:36] already because the faith is unconscious
[45:40] you not even know that you have it
[45:42] it was in the line when
[45:44] a sister came from the prophet to pray
[45:46] for ferrari says sister you are already
[45:48] here i didn't know that you have faith
[45:50] she didn't know
[45:52] because faith is unconscious
[45:54] it's not something that you produce
[45:57] it is not that i believe i believe i
[45:59] believe is right there
[46:02] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[46:03] lord so you we must have his revelation
[46:06] from your heart
[46:08] amen
[46:10] now
[46:11] we want to continue we want to continue
[46:13] this this evening with the third step
[46:17] this step because we know that the holy
[46:20] ghost baptist is not make you perfect
[46:24] it's just
[46:25] that is helping you to stay in the in
[46:27] the in the
[46:29] in the when he is working on you
[46:32] to stay in the trials
[46:34] to not divorce
[46:37] amen do not be disappointed when they
[46:39] show you how many
[46:40] mistakes are in the message
[46:42] it keeps you
[46:44] is helping you to continue till the end
[46:47] to be a martiro
[46:49] a martyr
[46:50] a witness
[46:52] hallelujah it is not you
[46:54] i mean it is his faith in you
[46:57] it is the holy ghost in you
[46:59] it is the holy ghost in me so so how can
[47:02] i overcome first you have to be a gene
[47:04] of god the second thing you have to have
[47:06] his faith
[47:08] not your face
[47:10] his face
[47:12] and you cannot produce it
[47:14] it is given to you
[47:16] it's already in the gene
[47:18] it only need to to let at the atmosphere
[47:21] to create an atmosphere in that
[47:23] atmosphere
[47:24] the faith comes
[47:26] now the third things the prophet said
[47:29] you we must receive his word
[47:34] it is not enough to be a dream of god
[47:36] and not enough to have his faith you
[47:38] need to do something
[47:40] to know also something
[47:42] you need to open your heart and make a
[47:45] full surrender
[47:46] you know he you we need to accept
[47:50] his word so i have a quote here because
[47:54] this is our
[47:55] our food we in the morning we left it
[47:58] here
[47:59] when jesus said when the prophet said he
[48:01] he has had faith with his power because
[48:04] because he relied upon what he was
[48:08] he relied in knowing that he was the
[48:10] world
[48:11] and then the most
[48:12] what is for us
[48:15] verse 65 in perfect faith he said
[48:17] therefore he relied upon what god had
[48:20] made him
[48:21] and if he did that then can't we rely
[48:24] upon what god make made us as believers
[48:30] he had faith in what he was
[48:33] and if you are a believer you have faith
[48:36] in what you are
[48:38] you are a believer
[48:41] hallelujah
[48:43] blessed be the name
[48:45] of the
[48:46] lord amen
[48:51] so i am the code number five
[48:56] so we want to continue with
[48:59] with this code
[49:01] are you blessed in this evening
[49:04] amen
[49:05] because he blessed
[49:08] us
[49:09] now the only things we have to do then
[49:12] is to have and to have faith in what you
[49:15] are
[49:16] have fed faith in what the world says
[49:19] you are
[49:21] and jesus had faith in the word of god
[49:23] and he said that he was
[49:26] it is written of me
[49:28] so you can say in this evening it is
[49:30] freedom of me
[49:33] tell to somebody it is written of me
[49:38] it is written of me too didn't david in
[49:40] the psalms and the prophets and all of
[49:42] them speak of him
[49:44] i am the bread of life that cometh from
[49:46] god out of heaven and the prophet said
[49:49] amen
[49:50] i am the tree of life
[49:52] from the garden of eden
[49:54] i am all these things i am that i am and
[49:58] he knew with that perfect faith
[50:01] that he was the anointed messiah
[50:04] and you we need
[50:07] we know
[50:08] with that perfect revelation
[50:12] that you are the messiah nights
[50:16] hallelujah
[50:18] the prophet said that we are the
[50:20] anointed messiah knight
[50:22] you are the anointed messiah
[50:25] you are the anointed messiah
[50:28] you are the messiah
[50:29] you are the anointed one of the because
[50:32] the word has anointed us
[50:34] and that the spirit of god was upon him
[50:37] he said
[50:38] now i in myself do nothing but is my
[50:41] faith in god
[50:43] and god was in hebrew
[50:45] the word made
[50:47] manifest
[50:49] and when the word of god comes in you
[50:52] here we are
[50:55] it's made manifest
[50:58] for you are
[51:00] a believer
[51:02] see and the believer
[51:05] are you ready
[51:06] is the face of god
[51:09] that moves
[51:10] in you
[51:13] hallelujah it is not my faith that is
[51:15] moving in me it is his faith
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:23] a super sense
[51:25] 59 in the morning he he preached about
[51:27] the super sign
[51:29] and in the evening
[51:31] in the evening message
[51:32] he preached a super sense
[51:35] paragraph 54
[51:37] and we are grateful to god that we have
[51:39] the five senses
[51:41] not only these senses but we have the
[51:43] spirit senses
[51:45] by no means that was five senses given
[51:47] to you to guide you
[51:49] they were given to you for earthly
[51:51] contact
[51:52] but there was given to you
[51:56] it was given to you
[51:59] it was given to me
[52:01] it was say it was given to me let's make
[52:03] the message personal
[52:06] hallelujah the sixth sense
[52:09] and that sixth sense belongs only
[52:13] to the christians
[52:16] actually brother brown said if you in
[52:19] order that you believe the message of
[52:21] the hour you need the gift of faith
[52:26] good evening bride
[52:28] you have the gift of faith to if you
[52:32] believe this message is because you have
[52:35] a gift of revelation
[52:37] hallelujah somebody say praise the lord
[52:41] amen you cannot have these six or six
[52:44] cents until you become a christian is
[52:46] the only way that you ever can have any
[52:49] more than the five natural
[52:52] senses for a natural person but the
[52:54] sixth sense is better no to the
[52:56] christian as faith
[52:59] is the one that governs and guides you
[53:02] and it's superior
[53:05] i am happy
[53:06] to all other senses
[53:08] it's superior to all other senses five
[53:12] senses so first step
[53:15] you need to be a gene of god by his
[53:17] grace we are the second thing we we need
[53:20] to have his faith
[53:22] which coming by revelation the third
[53:24] things we need
[53:26] to accept his word
[53:29] now let me see the end time sign said
[53:32] but branham said and the people sit in
[53:35] the church and hear the messages of god
[53:38] and believe them
[53:40] and want accepted
[53:43] they wouldn't say well no i don't
[53:45] believe that's right some of them will
[53:48] come say
[53:49] and agree with it
[53:51] i believe it's right
[53:53] but you won't do it see you will die
[53:57] dying in the pews of the church because
[54:00] they won't accept the remedy
[54:03] actually the people when they come to
[54:05] church when they listen the message they
[54:07] come not to eat
[54:10] they come to filter
[54:12] so
[54:13] when you go to eat you are not filtering
[54:17] you go to eat
[54:18] when you listen to this message we don't
[54:21] filter anything
[54:22] we just absorb everything
[54:28] hallelujah
[54:30] we are not here to judge
[54:33] we are need to eat the book
[54:37] this message is not something that you
[54:39] have to
[54:40] let do it there it is there's somebody
[54:43] to prove me that this message is truth
[54:47] i thought the message don't need to be
[54:49] proven he's already proven
[54:53] [Music]
[54:57] this message is nothing but the truth
[55:00] and you know why
[55:02] because i believe it
[55:11] because you believe it
[55:13] is a deep calling to the deep
[55:16] hallelujah
[55:18] in order to see the third pull in
[55:20] manifestation we have to have the same
[55:23] attitude as heti the right one
[55:26] hath is the right one
[55:29] it is nothing but the truth
[55:34] you know it's the power of creation in
[55:36] you
[55:38] in each one you feel the prophet said is
[55:40] creative powers
[55:44] [Music]
[55:45] right
[55:49] hallelujah
[55:53] but the question is can you receive it
[55:57] do you believe it
[55:59] now here he is here
[56:02] well if he is here the only one thinks
[56:06] he keeps his word
[56:09] just believe
[56:11] that you receive it
[56:13] and accept it
[56:15] and rise up and say lord god i am here
[56:19] to accept it
[56:22] hallelujah
[56:23] now it comes
[56:25] the essence of it the flavor
[56:28] and by accepting then his word
[56:33] not by fasting
[56:35] not by praying
[56:38] not by good deeds
[56:43] and by accepting
[56:46] making a full surrender
[56:48] then his word
[56:51] brings life
[56:53] brings christ back in us
[56:58] not but coming at the altar not because
[57:00] i try to manipulate you sentiment
[57:04] sentimentally or to work you in such a
[57:07] way to tell you stories about grandma
[57:10] and some nice boy that he died in an
[57:13] accident or you know i don't i'm not
[57:16] here
[57:18] you know the only thing that you you
[57:20] will see results is to make a
[57:24] full surrender to accept it to make a
[57:28] clear-cut decision to say lord from this
[57:31] day all
[57:32] i will believe
[57:34] with all my heart these magics i will no
[57:37] doubt anymore
[57:42] and the holy spirit will come right
[57:44] there
[57:45] and you will be filled with the holy
[57:47] ghost
[57:50] and always the the holy ghost will
[57:53] guide you to the light
[57:56] nobody can deceive you anymore
[58:00] because the token
[58:02] that's right
[58:04] you know that the message is the blood
[58:05] yes
[58:07] now first you apply the blood
[58:09] and the token automatically come
[58:14] the token
[58:17] is
[58:18] the literal life of the law of jesus
[58:20] christ turn back in the believer
[58:23] that's why you are here christian life
[58:25] tabernacle
[58:28] in order to see that in manifestation
[58:30] we need to apply the message
[58:34] it's so simple the people like to come
[58:37] in the church and they say can you say
[58:39] it sermon brother david that we all cry
[58:42] here you know and you try to bring the
[58:44] music in
[58:46] and the people feel so nice it's so
[58:49] wonderful and then we go out and
[58:51] everybody does
[58:53] how what they want
[58:58] i i didn't supposed to say that huh
[59:04] yeah we are not a you know sandy message
[59:07] believer
[59:09] we need to apply
[59:10] the message
[59:14] every day
[59:16] in our relationship
[59:19] in our thinking
[59:21] in our businesses
[59:24] in everything
[59:26] and the holy spirit which
[59:28] just fell
[59:30] fresh upon you how do you know about the
[59:32] gabriel because i did i i went to it
[59:37] i was a good pentecostal
[59:39] i spoke in tongues i still speak in
[59:41] tongues
[59:43] i had visions i had manifestation i was
[59:46] floating in the air
[59:48] but i had the holy ghost only over my
[59:50] spirit
[59:51] but one day i heard i was
[59:54] listening to the mark of the beast it
[59:56] was 12 o'clock in the night in the
[59:58] midnight and i i stood up on my feet i
[1:00:01] said from this day on i will accept the
[1:00:04] doctrine the teaching of this man
[1:00:06] and i make a full surrender when i did
[1:00:09] that the holy spirit changed my soul
[1:00:14] since that day on so i know what it
[1:00:16] means the holy ghost baptist without
[1:00:18] sensation
[1:00:20] not too many people are happy to hear
[1:00:22] that
[1:00:26] but the only things that kept me on
[1:00:28] track the only things that kept me away
[1:00:30] from all the compromises
[1:00:33] not for sale
[1:00:35] you know why
[1:00:36] because i made the full surrender
[1:00:40] and the message took over my life
[1:00:45] oh hallelujah
[1:00:47] by accepting then his word
[1:00:50] brings life brings christ back in us
[1:00:55] brothers is so simple
[1:00:57] why i should make it more complicated
[1:01:00] why i should have a church spirit over
[1:01:02] me instead to have the holy ghost
[1:01:05] why i should not be enough sincere to
[1:01:08] realize that you are not my property you
[1:01:10] are not my sheep
[1:01:12] you are his property
[1:01:14] you are not my bro you are his bride
[1:01:18] he purchased you by his
[1:01:21] precious blood on calvary and all these
[1:01:25] ages it was ignorance and he had to stay
[1:01:28] there for the ignorance of the people
[1:01:30] but in the end days lord god was open
[1:01:34] his heart
[1:01:36] and he was not afraid to do it because
[1:01:38] on earth he will have a sensitive bride
[1:01:41] to his world
[1:01:44] hallelujah
[1:01:46] because christ
[1:01:48] is the world
[1:01:51] now he continues
[1:01:53] you don't have enough place for me to
[1:01:55] preach
[1:01:57] because you know what the prophet said
[1:01:59] i am stimulated by revelation
[1:02:01] i am still the only thing that
[1:02:03] stimulates me
[1:02:14] let the prophet say something anointed
[1:02:18] and this is enough for me to have a
[1:02:20] revival
[1:02:21] to change my life
[1:02:24] this message is this greatest life that
[1:02:27] struck the earth forever
[1:02:30] since the foundation of the world
[1:02:32] there is nothing like this message this
[1:02:34] light
[1:02:36] and we are the children of light
[1:02:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:02:42] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:02:44] make you free
[1:02:47] because christ is the word
[1:02:50] the spoken word
[1:02:52] all right my goodness hallelujah christ
[1:02:55] is the word brother bit spoken word amen
[1:03:00] this will our
[1:03:02] this has to be our satisfaction
[1:03:05] spoken word
[1:03:07] is christ
[1:03:09] we are uniting
[1:03:12] so the third step
[1:03:14] is
[1:03:15] receive
[1:03:16] his spoken word
[1:03:18] receive not understanding
[1:03:22] not agreeing
[1:03:25] not believing
[1:03:27] but
[1:03:28] accepting even the devil knows we spoke
[1:03:31] with your pastor said even the pope
[1:03:34] knows that the message is
[1:03:37] not only be agreeing yeah yeah we know
[1:03:39] the message is good the message is from
[1:03:41] the road in the bible yeah yeah it's
[1:03:43] biblical it's biblical
[1:03:45] accept
[1:03:49] not agreeing
[1:03:51] accepting
[1:03:52] and you say
[1:03:54] praise the lord
[1:03:56] dean of god
[1:03:57] his faith
[1:03:59] accepting his spoken word
[1:04:02] the fourth thing
[1:04:05] you must take the right decision
[1:04:09] slowly so we are coming in the message
[1:04:12] parables
[1:04:14] message parable i like that
[1:04:17] hallelujah
[1:04:20] you remember the situation this is in
[1:04:24] in standing in the gap 63
[1:04:27] standing in the gap
[1:04:31] are you happy
[1:04:33] maybe i behave
[1:04:35] i don't look to my wife in other than i
[1:04:37] can be free
[1:04:41] she will tell me later on then
[1:04:46] don't love brothers you are the same
[1:04:49] be sincere
[1:04:51] hallelujah if you are the perfect
[1:04:53] husband
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:04:56] so brother branham wanted to have a good
[1:04:59] desire
[1:05:00] he wanted to a prophet like in the world
[1:05:03] he wanted to go in the mountain
[1:05:05] and the anointing strike him had a
[1:05:06] message for somebody come down the dust
[1:05:09] says the lord
[1:05:11] many are so
[1:05:12] spiritual
[1:05:14] but you need to take the right decision
[1:05:16] that's right
[1:05:17] now listen to this parable paragraph
[1:05:20] 117 so he speaks how he was driving to
[1:05:24] canada
[1:05:25] you know better reading
[1:05:27] this message at home
[1:05:29] and then brother brahm is telling
[1:05:31] oh he went to sleep and he went
[1:05:33] speeding down i went leading down he was
[1:05:36] driving
[1:05:37] 55 mile on an hour in the truck over the
[1:05:39] mountain coming home to arizona but i
[1:05:42] was coming now into utah
[1:05:45] and as i got there coming down from the
[1:05:47] mountain
[1:05:48] about 20 miles out of the city you you
[1:05:52] have heard it as i told you about the
[1:05:53] morning about the squares
[1:05:55] and all these things
[1:05:57] somebody went
[1:05:59] talking to me
[1:06:02] a voice just the same
[1:06:05] as you
[1:06:06] hear mine
[1:06:09] i like that
[1:06:13] let's put this this way
[1:06:18] somebody
[1:06:20] was talking to me
[1:06:22] a voice
[1:06:24] the same as you hear mine
[1:06:26] so what we hear is his voice
[1:06:31] hallelujah
[1:06:32] the voice
[1:06:34] just the same as you hear mine
[1:06:37] for somebody
[1:06:39] for us it makes sense
[1:06:41] we give something to it because when we
[1:06:43] hear the prophet we hear his voice
[1:06:47] so i know it sounds neurotically but as
[1:06:50] i i go through expressing have i ever
[1:06:53] told you anything but was right
[1:06:56] i like the way the creator speaking to
[1:06:58] him
[1:06:59] is like husband and wife
[1:07:03] and the voice go a voice got to talking
[1:07:06] i was talking to him

[1:07:11] spiritual ears
[1:07:13] carry out your plans
[1:07:15] and you will be like that
[1:07:18] we need to take the right decisions
[1:07:22] how can i overcome
[1:07:26] we need to take right decisions
[1:07:30] because you have creative power in you
[1:07:33] every son of god and every daughter of
[1:07:35] god have creative powers now the devil
[1:07:37] knows that that's why he went to jesus
[1:07:40] say you can change these stones in
[1:07:44] because
[1:07:45] this is exactly
[1:07:46] how we are
[1:07:48] we have creative power now if we accept
[1:07:52] thoughts from the devil
[1:07:53] it will come
[1:07:55] in manifestation
[1:07:59] so carry out your plans
[1:08:01] it will be like that before that he had
[1:08:03] the dream
[1:08:04] that he will be like fletcher you know
[1:08:06] his his brother-in-law how he was
[1:08:08] hunting between the
[1:08:10] like a bomb
[1:08:12] so the lord warned his prophet
[1:08:15] he sought his right
[1:08:19] and he was driving here
[1:08:21] and the voice i am so happy for the
[1:08:23] voice somebody said the voice
[1:08:27] the voice is not there with different
[1:08:30] churches and ministers
[1:08:32] the voice is here
[1:08:34] working among us
[1:08:37] hallelujah and said
[1:08:39] look at here no remember think about
[1:08:41] think about think about
[1:08:43] now this great ministry there is no
[1:08:45] other ministry like the ministry of the
[1:08:47] prophet
[1:08:48] is god
[1:08:49] prophet fight for ministry come on say
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:54] we are under him
[1:08:56] we are not equal with him
[1:08:58] we are never above him
[1:09:00] god
[1:09:02] messenger
[1:09:03] fight for
[1:09:04] ministry we need to be humble enough
[1:09:08] to realize
[1:09:10] and to say only
[1:09:12] what he said
[1:09:19] but also my brothers
[1:09:22] with this great ministry
[1:09:24] he had a wife
[1:09:27] now think about
[1:09:28] sister meda you know what madam means
[1:09:31] prophetess
[1:09:32] now
[1:09:33] meda
[1:09:35] prophetess
[1:09:38] she had a great influence
[1:09:41] over his ministry
[1:09:44] your wife
[1:09:45] has a great influence in your life
[1:09:48] you need to be wise enough
[1:09:51] to treat properly your wife
[1:09:55] look at here are you still with me
[1:09:58] so the voice told him
[1:10:01] your wife will go too
[1:10:05] she will leave you
[1:10:08] she won't live up there in them hills
[1:10:11] like that so don't try my brother to be
[1:10:14] too spiritual
[1:10:20] if a man with this caliber with his
[1:10:22] quality
[1:10:23] with his high position
[1:10:27] his wife
[1:10:29] what he she saw she knew his problems
[1:10:32] he she she lived with him in the house
[1:10:36] with such a prophet
[1:10:40] she will leave him
[1:10:42] my for me was
[1:10:44] really shock striking when i realized
[1:10:48] how important
[1:10:50] is the relationship between husband and
[1:10:53] wife
[1:10:57] she won't live up there in them hills
[1:11:01] and you will become a bum
[1:11:03] this is god speaking
[1:11:06] to william brown and the prophet the
[1:11:07] messenger
[1:11:10] think about only think about
[1:11:14] just as the dream showed you
[1:11:18] you would
[1:11:20] now i said i don't want to be i did i
[1:11:23] don't want to have to live like that i
[1:11:26] just wanted to do something different
[1:11:28] you know lord
[1:11:30] that you have called me to be a prophet
[1:11:32] i want to live in the wilderness
[1:11:35] like a prophet
[1:11:37] but you know
[1:11:39] i was using my own excuses
[1:11:43] so i could hunt
[1:11:45] brothers
[1:11:46] let's be more sincere
[1:11:50] my own good
[1:11:53] and he said
[1:11:54] but that was the prophet the prophet of
[1:11:56] the old testament you have been called
[1:12:00] to be
[1:12:01] there in a much higher office than that
[1:12:05] you have more gifts beside that
[1:12:08] you was called to pray for the sick and
[1:12:11] to preach the gospel in an apostolic
[1:12:13] form
[1:12:15] of greater things
[1:12:17] many great gifts
[1:12:19] he said why do you wait for me to move
[1:12:22] you every time you move
[1:12:26] where is your reward
[1:12:30] we need to take the right decision
[1:12:32] brothers
[1:12:35] are you sure that if you want to move
[1:12:38] is that says the lord
[1:12:40] or is that says i
[1:12:51] then i seen
[1:12:53] and then said do you remember
[1:12:56] i told you
[1:12:58] do you remember what brother robertson
[1:13:00] told you in your dream in his dream or
[1:13:03] vision
[1:13:04] that you had done like moses
[1:13:08] i like the message parables
[1:13:11] they are sweet
[1:13:13] you've forgotten the feelings of your
[1:13:16] people you forgot the call
[1:13:18] that i called
[1:13:20] you
[1:13:24] quote number seven
[1:13:28] we need to do
[1:13:30] to take good decision if we are the seed
[1:13:33] of god a gene of god the bride
[1:13:36] we need to take good decision
[1:13:42] standing in the paragraph 136
[1:13:46] in the same line of thinking
[1:13:49] the prophet remember to the church
[1:13:52] what the holy ghost told about him
[1:13:57] now here is what he said
[1:13:59] because thou have
[1:14:01] chosen
[1:14:02] the narrow path
[1:14:05] the harder way
[1:14:08] thou has walked in your wall
[1:14:12] choosing now i can see that moses had to
[1:14:16] make his choice too see
[1:14:19] tao has speak the precise
[1:14:22] and correct way
[1:14:24] correct
[1:14:25] decision
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:28] it is
[1:14:29] my way
[1:14:39] it is it is good with microphone
[1:14:42] shall i put it okay
[1:14:47] it's my way
[1:14:50] underlined my way
[1:14:53] the holy spirit speaking back because of
[1:14:56] this momentous decision
[1:15:00] i trust that the lord can say about me
[1:15:04] that i take good decisions
[1:15:09] a huge portion
[1:15:11] esther
[1:15:13] a huge portion
[1:15:15] half of the kingdom
[1:15:17] half of the kingdom is not half of
[1:15:19] america
[1:15:21] is the same power
[1:15:22] that jesus had
[1:15:25] half of the kingdom is half an authority
[1:15:29] is the is the same power as christ
[1:15:32] spoken word
[1:15:37] awaits you
[1:15:39] and you know what is heaven
[1:15:42] consist
[1:15:44] in the world
[1:15:46] to be in the heavenly poor
[1:15:48] in the heavenly
[1:15:53] places
[1:15:54] is to be in the world
[1:15:57] what a glorious decision
[1:16:00] what a glorious decision now listen
[1:16:01] across the prophet said
[1:16:03] tau has made this is in itself and that
[1:16:08] which will make and come to pass the
[1:16:10] tremendous victory in the love divine
[1:16:16] can you say praise the lord
[1:16:22] first gen of god second his faith
[1:16:25] third receive his spoken word you have
[1:16:28] to take the right decision now listen to
[1:16:30] his to this
[1:16:35] this is in the countdown
[1:16:38] when they beg
[1:16:39] began with believe the sign and all
[1:16:42] things against the message i was so
[1:16:44] curious
[1:16:46] what in the world they have against this
[1:16:48] message
[1:16:49] because this message is so biblical
[1:16:54] if we don't see it in the bible
[1:16:57] it's good to see it and to find it in
[1:16:59] the bible
[1:17:01] because you know the bible they cannot
[1:17:03] throw away the bible
[1:17:05] and the message we have is nothing but
[1:17:06] the bible
[1:17:08] is the perfect interpretation with
[1:17:10] divine vindication
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:18] so
[1:17:19] you know sometimes when they throw to
[1:17:21] the garbage
[1:17:23] it's good for me
[1:17:26] what they hate i love
[1:17:28] what they stumble
[1:17:30] is making me happy
[1:17:33] hallelujah
[1:17:35] so they they speak about the brown bear
[1:17:38] the big one grizzly bear
[1:17:41] so i thought to myself lord how comes
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:45] they
[1:17:46] they speak against these visions and the
[1:17:49] way it is something hidden
[1:17:52] they cannot see it
[1:17:54] but for us
[1:17:56] we have eyes to see
[1:17:58] and
[1:17:59] here here to here
[1:18:02] and then i i started to study a little
[1:18:04] bit about this parable of the message
[1:18:07] and i found something so sweet
[1:18:10] i i preached that homo sermon about it
[1:18:12] is is wonderful
[1:18:15] and is a lesson for us
[1:18:18] and what branham was world he said three
[1:18:21] times
[1:18:22] to take the right decision
[1:18:25] so the god's vision is the bible
[1:18:28] god's vision in our time is the message
[1:18:31] of the hour
[1:18:32] we when we know what's next because the
[1:18:35] message already taught
[1:18:37] us what is the next stage what
[1:18:40] expectation we don't need somebody to
[1:18:42] tell us what we expect
[1:18:45] because already the messenger told us
[1:18:48] what's next tell to somebody what's next
[1:18:52] you read it in the message is the sir
[1:18:54] pulling manifestation hallelujah we
[1:18:57] praise god for the message of the hour
[1:19:01] so brother brahm said in
[1:19:03] okay is that so in this 30 going on 32
[1:19:07] years of ministry i have tried to stay
[1:19:10] true to the world
[1:19:12] may the lord help us
[1:19:15] to have the same testimony
[1:19:17] we have tried to stay true to the world
[1:19:21] i don't know
[1:19:22] of one things i ever had or on to alter
[1:19:25] on because i just read it about in the
[1:19:28] bible say just what the bible said and
[1:19:31] let it go like that
[1:19:33] and so i haven't had to take back on
[1:19:35] rearrange
[1:19:37] or tell to the people that this vision
[1:19:40] happened in this way
[1:19:42] the message don't need to be defend
[1:19:44] defeat defended
[1:19:46] the message
[1:19:48] is nothing but the truth
[1:19:51] he will prove prove it by manifesting it
[1:19:54] just wait a little more sunset
[1:19:58] you will see don't miss it
[1:20:01] the prophet said in one golden nugget
[1:20:03] this is my new ministry 59th he said one
[1:20:06] of these days
[1:20:07] the same pillar of fire that lead israel
[1:20:10] in the wilderness
[1:20:12] will lead us again
[1:20:14] loaves and fishes will be multiplied
[1:20:18] so don't be scared about the squeeze and
[1:20:21] the prices because something
[1:20:24] something huge is going to happen
[1:20:27] that person that is speaking to our
[1:20:29] hearts is going to be materialized again
[1:20:32] among us
[1:20:34] because this message is not coming from
[1:20:36] the baptist or the pentecost
[1:20:38] this message is coming
[1:20:40] from god
[1:20:43] that's why we cannot be measured with
[1:20:45] different doctrines
[1:20:47] this message is not to be measured with
[1:20:50] the baptist doctrine or pentecostal
[1:20:51] doctrine of adventist doctrine this
[1:20:54] message is coming from the throne of god
[1:20:58] so i try to i try to stay true to the
[1:21:00] world and so i having to take tobacco
[1:21:02] rearrange because i said i just said it
[1:21:05] the way the bible says it
[1:21:08] and i found out if god has spoken
[1:21:10] anything we must go with that word
[1:21:14] in order to make it be fulfilled
[1:21:18] my
[1:21:20] we are coming to know something now
[1:21:24] we must stay with that message
[1:21:27] in order to make it be manifested
[1:21:32] don't try to say the message is not true
[1:21:35] it is mistake is his opinion you know
[1:21:39] maybe miss this on that you maybe may
[1:21:43] better be sure that you did exactly
[1:21:47] how he said
[1:21:50] because noah
[1:21:51] did exactly
[1:21:53] according
[1:21:55] with what the lord has shown to him
[1:21:59] because he who is behind his word
[1:22:02] we seen that as i told you last night of
[1:22:05] a vision just recently
[1:22:08] and he speaks about this vision about
[1:22:10] that are you with me
[1:22:13] okay now look at this
[1:22:15] i headed to be there
[1:22:18] and learning to be there
[1:22:20] so in that vision the lord told to the
[1:22:23] prophet
[1:22:24] take care is that says the lord
[1:22:27] is it will be exactly and never failed
[1:22:33] and telling me six months before
[1:22:36] to be on that spot
[1:22:39] and stand there and saying
[1:22:41] go
[1:22:42] down
[1:22:43] there
[1:22:44] three times
[1:22:46] with them
[1:22:47] my brother and sister
[1:22:50] you better watch
[1:22:52] to go with the right kind of crowd
[1:22:56] who is the right
[1:22:58] person
[1:23:00] go down there
[1:23:02] so the same god that gave brother
[1:23:04] branham vision and never felt the vision
[1:23:08] the same god warned him
[1:23:11] it's a parable for me and you to realize
[1:23:14] stay with the truth
[1:23:18] in order to see
[1:23:21] manifesting
[1:23:22] what the prophet has said
[1:23:25] you need to
[1:23:27] stay exactly
[1:23:29] with what the prophet have said
[1:23:33] that's what happened with this it's a
[1:23:36] wonderful lesson
[1:23:38] for us to don't do
[1:23:42] that's right
[1:23:45] somebody say praise god
[1:23:48] so the when
[1:23:50] he heard that says the lord brother
[1:23:52] brown said it that says the lord never
[1:23:54] fell will be there
[1:23:57] and then he is there in the intersection
[1:24:02] and then the lord is telling him go down
[1:24:05] with them because the group of hunting
[1:24:08] was split into
[1:24:10] so the spirit of the lord told to
[1:24:12] brother iran
[1:24:13] go to this group
[1:24:18] three times
[1:24:20] i like that
[1:24:22] and i just walked one with the other man
[1:24:27] to whom are you working
[1:24:31] to whom i am working
[1:24:33] you know in the internet
[1:24:36] it's a net
[1:24:38] we have access to all kind
[1:24:41] of people
[1:24:46] you don't know exactly who is who till
[1:24:49] you are there
[1:24:51] when you are there you find out
[1:24:53] that you jumped from the lake
[1:24:57] in the battle
[1:25:01] in the battle
[1:25:03] is the saying we have it
[1:25:08] in the vision pass passage rise to
[1:25:11] exactly
[1:25:13] god's part
[1:25:17] and i was left standing
[1:25:22] so don't let us not blame the message
[1:25:26] because this is only for the
[1:25:28] eagles
[1:25:30] ghouls i try to say right eagles
[1:25:34] it is only for the bride
[1:25:37] this is nothing this is not from
[1:25:38] buzzards this is not from hoax
[1:25:41] house oaks
[1:25:44] this is for eagles
[1:25:47] for me this is
[1:25:49] an extraordinary lesson
[1:25:51] for it's blessed my soul
[1:25:54] because the message is no mistaking
[1:25:57] more than 30 years i was i feeding
[1:25:59] myself from this message i never saw a
[1:26:01] mistake
[1:26:04] when they say this is something wrong
[1:26:05] and not don't happen what with umbrella
[1:26:08] had a vision and they are so
[1:26:10] intellectual they are for me they are
[1:26:12] totally blind and i'm stimulated and i
[1:26:15] have a revival oh lord
[1:26:19] thank you for this
[1:26:21] because i see
[1:26:24] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:26:26] lord the vision pass it right through
[1:26:28] exactly god's part
[1:26:33] god's
[1:26:34] part
[1:26:36] what about my part
[1:26:41] the bright revival
[1:26:43] is when
[1:26:45] she started to speak in tongue
[1:26:49] and prophesying
[1:26:50] having vision
[1:26:52] he get it bravo
[1:26:55] when she line up
[1:26:58] with the world
[1:27:01] this is the kind of revival i want
[1:27:04] to line my life
[1:27:06] with this messenger
[1:27:10] this is a revival
[1:27:12] not to play tricks and to
[1:27:15] we are not here to entertain people
[1:27:18] go to jimmy sogart
[1:27:22] or different
[1:27:28] we are not jimmy subwood revival
[1:27:32] i don't it's not coming in my mind some
[1:27:35] peristome
[1:27:37] no
[1:27:38] we have a dividend
[1:27:40] we line up with the message of malachi
[1:27:42] 4.
[1:27:44] this is my revival if they come to my
[1:27:47] church and say do you have a revival
[1:27:49] what do you mean
[1:27:51] look to my people how they are dressed
[1:27:53] look how they live
[1:27:55] look how they think
[1:27:57] we have a revival
[1:28:00] we have a spirit the revival is the
[1:28:02] spirit
[1:28:03] is the spoken word spirit
[1:28:06] is the same spirit as prophet have over
[1:28:10] it
[1:28:11] i am happy to to see that in the real
[1:28:14] real ministry have the same anointing
[1:28:17] because we received the message in the
[1:28:19] spirit was given
[1:28:22] we don't put words in prophet mouth
[1:28:26] we want to see the same spirit of the
[1:28:29] same anointing coming that that is
[1:28:32] over the because brother brown said the
[1:28:34] anointing is on the tapes
[1:28:36] so we want the same anointing to come
[1:28:39] it is not what i say what i preach the
[1:28:42] more
[1:28:43] complicated or interesting i preach but
[1:28:46] at the end has to come the same
[1:28:47] anointing
[1:28:50] and the bride is so sensitive
[1:28:52] because we are seeing the bright people
[1:28:54] are simple people but they feel the same
[1:28:57] anointing
[1:28:58] and we are not feeding on a man
[1:29:01] we are feeding on the
[1:29:03] body world of the son of man
[1:29:05] which is the holy ghost himself
[1:29:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:29:13] god's part
[1:29:14] and i was left standing
[1:29:17] sometimes you know
[1:29:19] we are left standing
[1:29:20] so we want to remember
[1:29:23] you've got to stay on the world
[1:29:27] just stay
[1:29:29] right
[1:29:30] with the world
[1:29:31] and where the world leads
[1:29:34] you go right with the world and will
[1:29:37] bring you out all right
[1:29:40] i'm sure
[1:29:43] can you say praise the lord
[1:29:47] gene of god
[1:29:50] faith of god
[1:29:54] accept and receive
[1:29:56] the spoken word
[1:29:59] take the right decision
[1:30:02] the fifth one
[1:30:04] is in the quote number eight
[1:30:07] i am finished the
[1:30:09] quote number eight
[1:30:12] adoption
[1:30:14] 60
[1:30:17] and that's right the prophet said
[1:30:20] he foretold me things that i never felt
[1:30:23] to happen just exactly
[1:30:26] i'll bring any man to trial for that
[1:30:29] that's right
[1:30:30] i don't claim to be a prophet
[1:30:32] but you listen to me
[1:30:34] thus says the lord
[1:30:38] it will take
[1:30:39] perfect love
[1:30:45] to put you in that place is
[1:30:49] not it's not all doctrine
[1:30:52] you know to tell explain everybody
[1:30:56] all the doctrines
[1:30:58] sometimes the people need bread
[1:31:00] you don't give a quote
[1:31:03] you don't give him a
[1:31:05] bible verse
[1:31:06] the people need heat
[1:31:09] they are sheep
[1:31:11] the sheep need to be careful to be taken
[1:31:15] care of
[1:31:18] perfect love
[1:31:21] to put you in that place
[1:31:24] and that's all there was there
[1:31:27] no matter what money how much religious
[1:31:31] demonstrations
[1:31:32] how many good deeds you've done
[1:31:36] whatever you done
[1:31:38] that won't count nothing on that day
[1:31:42] it will take perfect love
[1:31:49] perfect love somebody say perfect love
[1:31:52] my
[1:31:53] you see
[1:31:54] you are prophesying again
[1:31:57] so whatever you do
[1:32:00] lay aside everything else
[1:32:03] until you are just so filled with the
[1:32:06] love of god
[1:32:09] till you love those
[1:32:12] who loves you
[1:32:14] no who hate you
[1:32:21] john 21
[1:32:23] i finished john 21
[1:32:27] i don't want the children to say always
[1:32:29] he said i am finishing and he still
[1:32:31] preach half an hour more
[1:32:34] this is not nice
[1:32:36] it's father's day
[1:32:39] hallelujah
[1:32:42] are you happy
[1:32:44] we are a family here you know this is
[1:32:46] the family of god
[1:32:49] we are on our way we have heard the
[1:32:51] message shalom
[1:32:53] we are the sons of daughter of god
[1:32:57] praise the lord
[1:32:59] john 21
[1:33:01] it was in his appearing
[1:33:04] after
[1:33:05] chapter 21 verse 1 after these things
[1:33:08] jesus showed himself again to the
[1:33:12] disciples of the sea of tiberias this is
[1:33:15] in galilee the place of revelation
[1:33:17] and there were seven disciples
[1:33:20] seven
[1:33:22] simon peter said unto them
[1:33:25] you see the intellectual faith
[1:33:27] he was not yet
[1:33:29] you know born again he didn't receive
[1:33:31] the holy ghost yet
[1:33:32] he was still in audition condition
[1:33:37] till
[1:33:38] he received the holy ghost
[1:33:41] and the you see the intellectual face
[1:33:43] we also go to tea so they went and they
[1:33:46] started to fish and you know how today
[1:33:49] we try to fish
[1:33:51] with all
[1:33:52] only intellectual conception
[1:33:55] not be really send
[1:33:58] commissioned
[1:34:00] so they entered in a ship and they
[1:34:02] they caught nothing
[1:34:05] you see why because
[1:34:08] only the third pool will catch
[1:34:10] the rainbow trout
[1:34:14] the rainbow trout
[1:34:16] are catched by the silk pool
[1:34:21] not what people tries
[1:34:24] to do
[1:34:25] to catch them
[1:34:29] and then
[1:34:30] in that morning
[1:34:31] when the morning was now come jesus
[1:34:33] stood on the shore you see revelation 10
[1:34:37] putting the feet on the
[1:34:39] on the on the on the dry land and one on
[1:34:41] the water
[1:34:43] jesus was there
[1:34:46] so but the disciple knew not that it was
[1:34:49] jesus
[1:34:50] they didn't know that he is in a new
[1:34:52] he's
[1:34:53] in a new form
[1:34:54] they didn't recognize him
[1:34:57] and jesus said children have any to eat
[1:35:00] they say no
[1:35:01] cast the net
[1:35:04] on the right side
[1:35:07] turn the picture to the right
[1:35:10] if you turn again is a heart
[1:35:14] turn it to the right side
[1:35:17] do it the way
[1:35:19] he said it
[1:35:20] obey
[1:35:22] to what he said
[1:35:24] cast the net on the right side
[1:35:27] and you shall find that they cast
[1:35:28] therefore and now they were not able to
[1:35:30] draw
[1:35:31] before the multitude of the fishes
[1:35:34] and that disciple
[1:35:37] that jesus loved this is love
[1:35:39] told to peter
[1:35:41] you see only the love will recognize him
[1:35:44] not peter the intellectual faith
[1:35:47] but love
[1:35:48] john
[1:35:49] bride
[1:35:51] it is him
[1:35:53] my ministry is to declare that he is
[1:35:54] here
[1:35:56] so love love recognizes him
[1:35:59] your heart will recognize him maybe you
[1:36:02] don't understand too much but
[1:36:04] it is the lord
[1:36:06] this message is the
[1:36:08] lord
[1:36:10] so peter it was still in the laodicean
[1:36:12] condition
[1:36:14] he didn't have the garment on
[1:36:16] but when he heard the message
[1:36:19] it is the lord
[1:36:22] the bible says he girled
[1:36:24] with his fisher coat
[1:36:27] for he was naked
[1:36:29] normally
[1:36:30] when you want to
[1:36:32] to
[1:36:33] to
[1:36:34] throw yourself in the water you take off
[1:36:36] the clothing
[1:36:38] he thought
[1:36:39] he can walk on the water
[1:36:42] he saw that he could again because he's
[1:36:44] the lord
[1:36:46] and he can walk on the
[1:36:50] water he arrayed
[1:36:53] with the message
[1:36:55] his bride
[1:36:57] prepared herself
[1:36:59] with the fisher coat
[1:37:01] and jumped
[1:37:04] and as soon as they come to the lane
[1:37:05] they saw the fire and jesus said bring
[1:37:08] some fish
[1:37:09] he knew that they didn't have because
[1:37:11] our own abilities our own programs will
[1:37:15] not catch that gold or that that rainbow
[1:37:17] trout
[1:37:18] and jesus said jesus says come and die
[1:37:21] and then he he said go again and throw
[1:37:24] in the right side right
[1:37:26] in the right way in the
[1:37:27] right side
[1:37:28] and it was full of fishes
[1:37:32] hundreds
[1:37:33] and fifty three
[1:37:38] you know how many squares
[1:37:41] brother branham hunted in his season
[1:37:47] is this message readers
[1:37:50] 149 plus 4
[1:37:53] to be a full measure
[1:37:56] this message
[1:37:58] it's amazing
[1:38:02] then jesus
[1:38:04] took peter aside
[1:38:07] peter
[1:38:10] three times he was asking him
[1:38:13] no you don't see it in
[1:38:15] in english but i tell you in in greek
[1:38:18] how it is
[1:38:19] the first the first time when
[1:38:22] he want to restore
[1:38:24] peter
[1:38:26] to put him back
[1:38:28] in his favor
[1:38:29] to show him grace because this message
[1:38:32] is nothing by the grace
[1:38:34] he said simon
[1:38:36] do you love me now the prophet told us
[1:38:40] that we have different words for love
[1:38:42] eros
[1:38:48] is the perfect divine love perfect love
[1:38:51] now jesus here the first time when he
[1:38:54] want to restore
[1:38:56] simon peter he asked him do you agape me
[1:39:00] do you love me
[1:39:02] you know how peter is answering i feel
[1:39:04] your tea
[1:39:06] i don't have divine love
[1:39:09] i just
[1:39:10] i just have a human
[1:39:12] if the message if you listen to my
[1:39:14] prayer
[1:39:15] if you do how i say
[1:39:18] i love you
[1:39:19] i love the message till the message
[1:39:22] everything is going exactly how i like
[1:39:24] it
[1:39:25] they preach how i like it
[1:39:27] they do how i like it they behave with
[1:39:30] me how i like it i feel you
[1:39:35] then jesus went
[1:39:38] and then asked him again do you agape me
[1:39:42] the message was asking peter the
[1:39:44] intellectual faith do you agape me do
[1:39:47] you love me with divine love anything
[1:39:49] what is going on what happened with you
[1:39:52] you still agape he said no i am filioti
[1:39:56] now the third time
[1:39:59] verse 17
[1:40:01] he says
[1:40:04] the third time he says
[1:40:09] so he understood he understood that
[1:40:12] intellectual faith
[1:40:14] even he if he was a
[1:40:16] predestinated seed
[1:40:18] he had the key
[1:40:19] he had the
[1:40:20] revelation jesus understood that we are
[1:40:23] a human being
[1:40:24] he never asked him agape me
[1:40:28] he said feel me it's okay
[1:40:32] if you cannot love me now
[1:40:36] divine
[1:40:38] it's okay i accept any kind of love
[1:40:42] if you don't love me the message the way
[1:40:45] i treat you
[1:40:46] if you don't understand the way
[1:40:48] what i am doing that in your life
[1:40:50] everything is according to the plan in
[1:40:52] nothing out of order
[1:40:54] everything is exactly
[1:40:56] because i am forming you
[1:41:00] body member
[1:41:02] when you are going to be mature enough
[1:41:08] when you have been young
[1:41:10] your god is your style self
[1:41:12] you went whatever you want
[1:41:15] you did
[1:41:17] whatever you want
[1:41:19] you decided whatever you decided
[1:41:23] you had just failure
[1:41:26] but when you shall be old
[1:41:30] when you come to your maturity
[1:41:35] thousands stretch for thy hands
[1:41:39] and another charge
[1:41:41] and carry

[1:41:50] we will surrender
[1:41:53] our lives to him
[1:41:55] and he will
[1:41:57] take us

[1:48:43] before there ever was a star
[1:48:46] before the universe was put in place
[1:48:50] he put the wedding band
[1:48:53] a predestination

[1:49:18] what he said but i've got the love and
[1:49:20] the grace to make her different
[1:49:23] i've got the power to change her
[1:49:26] i'm going to put something in her

[1:49:31] outside in it's going to work from the
[1:49:33] inside out
[1:49:36] and i'm just going to keep
[1:49:38] watering her and
[1:49:40] feeding her and what i spoke is going to
[1:49:45] come to life
[1:49:47] in human form
[1:49:50] hallelujah
[1:49:53] and god provided a way to do that
[1:49:56] he provided to send a voice

[1:50:22] because they're so beautiful
[1:50:25] and so i i just

[1:51:00] amen in your heart
[1:51:03] don't keep it in let it out
[1:51:06] you can't help give god

[1:51:10] when you give it's rewarded to you a
[1:51:13] hundredfold in this life
[1:51:16] and the life to come
[1:51:18] so we just trust that
[1:51:22] this beautiful message tonight that
[1:51:25] you'll go wrap your arms around the
[1:51:27] message of the hour that
[1:51:28] you'll bring it back personal to you
[1:51:34] that
[1:51:35] it'll be so
[1:51:38] so sweet to you
[1:51:40] and as our brother said you'll have a
[1:51:42] hundred percent confidence
[1:51:45] you can never amount to nothing if
[1:51:47] you're uncertain
[1:51:49] you've got to finally come to the place
[1:51:51] that says i'm certain
[1:51:54] this is the truth
[1:51:56] amen you know there's easier ways
[1:52:01] sure there is
[1:52:03] you know i i know that
[1:52:07] maybe i'm a little strict on the kind of
[1:52:09] music we listen to i i try to be open to
[1:52:12] i'm not as liberal as
[1:52:15] a lot of places but
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:17] there's one thing i've never done is
[1:52:19] i've never tried to keep you from this
[1:52:21] message
[1:52:22] that's our absolute yes
[1:52:27] and i i just you have to know how i
[1:52:29] believe i want to let you say this with
[1:52:31] all my heart
[1:52:34] i don't believe the message has come and
[1:52:37] we've heard the message and now we know
[1:52:40] what the message is and
[1:52:42] and we we understand all what brother
[1:52:45] branham taught and said
[1:52:47] and so now we're waiting for the spirit

[2:01:44] physician
[2:01:46] there's one last place that we can take
[2:01:48] them lord and it's you
