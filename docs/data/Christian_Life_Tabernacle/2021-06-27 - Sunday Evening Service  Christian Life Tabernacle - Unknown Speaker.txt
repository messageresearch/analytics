open ear an open heart lord quicken it to us we pray we asked all these things the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen amen but a cleverest especially if it could come at this time god bless you i was just thinking of the song and the message this morning about how the easter seal is alive in us and and i thought god's power is alive is definitely a great testimony about that so i'll be singing about that today people say that our god's dead has no power or might they deny that is living think this faith is alive we can't help that they say this for they do not understand they wonder and reason think jesus was just a man what about the truth what about the light [Music] what about the message is [Music] it's not just some story [Music] god's power is alive there's no purpose in leaving god's voice in this day don't cling to reason and the world's filthy ways we have a vision and no power can hold us back just stay faithful in jesus and he'll keep you on track so i ask you what about the truth [Music] is goodness what is done in your life it's not just some story god's power is still the truth this is still the love this is still the message yes it is [Music] god's power is alive this is still the truth this is still the light this is still the message [Music] yes it is it's not just some story god's power is goodness what is done in your life it's not just some story god's [Applause] amen you believe god's power is alive amen let's all stand as we invite our pastor this time [Music] oh gee [Music] why my heart and soul will fade [Music] he said be free to worship me singing [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] send me his holy name [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] let's pray father that's our song we heard our messenger say that man was bound and in prison [Music] father they had no look past death but one day you came and opened the tomb father and you paid the price and you made a way for all of us to be resurrected and to return back to from whence we came back to eden oh lord that thrills our heart we just ask you to bless us again tonight as we fellowship around your word in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen let's open our bibles and just read that verse that our messenger used this morning and it found there in romans the 8th chapter and the 11th verse and the one that we we know uh so well it's it's in my message book here but i i like to read it out of the bible so um it's good so and let's so let's read this romans uh the 8th chapter in the 11th verse but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated tonight we're going to continue with 16 more minutes of the message that we're studying and uh it just it's beautiful and we'll just enjoy these great things you know i i thought how beautiful that romans 11 ties in to melchizedek and who he was and when how he says we no longer hear of melchizedek because he became jesus christ and now we see that that god was now veiled in that that's the scripture says he prepared a body for himself and and and it's just beautiful when we see that but we just we just started our message this morning and there's just several beautiful statements that brother bannon makes we just want to mention them to us as as we before we go forward and and you know someone mentioned to me at lunch today they said that first part of the message you played has so many uh what they call one liners you know where just statements that just stand alone out just one after the other and and i thought is this one of them that we read this morning he said to me that's the real seal of it when something is said and then it's turned around and proven so anybody can make a confession but when you bring it to pass then that just puts the seal right there on it and then i thought this was a another thing how brother branham will go through the scriptures as he's preaching and he will give a definition for something that when you go back and read it it makes that scriptures come so alive and we all know the scripture matthew ye are the salt of the earth and if the salt loses its savor then what good is it but to be cast out and and then so we get the definition of salt and it makes that scripture just stand out so much more to us and he says he says the world is looking for this salt and he says for this salt and when we can prove by our lives and by the bible that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that's the day we're looking for so there's two great things is that we're looking for a day that there's a quickening power delivered to us that we can make every promise in this bible live now i believe we're in that time of transition into that because we believe every promise we've settled that question in our hearts and minds we know this message is true but now we realize that it's not we're not looking back on the message as something that's come and gone that we believe but we're understanding more and more that that the message was delivered through a prophet because it was prophecy and the word came to the prophet and the prophet was speaking i could almost use this terminology if you don't take it too far the other way but it was almost like he was speaking the bride into existence because the word was what quickened that bride and brought her to life and and and that bride was quickened by the spirit bringing that word to that hearer by revelation and so we're looking for that day and we just feel and then he goes on to talk here he says that we've come to this day he said that's the day we're looking for and it says and he's talking about the believer them who promised and say they believe he's given us a definite understanding of it just think of that this message has given us a definite understanding of it so there's a definite understanding if you have a question there is a definite understanding lying in god's word for you it's it's just these are just little statements that he made that i thought was a deafening understanding of it that these signs would follow them that believe it would be the proof of their testimony now we can say we believe but until we are until we are have the proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we are just confessing to be a believer and not a possession of believers so this is what we said that we have proof of of of the sign that he said would be upon us so i like that because i if he said it would be upon us then it's going to be upon us okay if i lack it i can look forward to it i can pray for it i can ask for god to manifest it someplace in my life to make it real to me so that's why i said the the word is never given to the hearer as condemnation that it it may approve you of sin or correct the sin in your life but but along with every chastisement there's a peace that follows because the believer is set free from that which is holding them down brother rem says correct does not mean to punish it means to change the path of the believer to make a navigation correction yeah you know so uh that is a wonderful thing so and i thought that was a wonderful statement and then we come over and we read another where he said we're going to break into this subject so that kind of lets me look forward to the rest of the book that we're going to break into something that the messenger certainly wants to bring out and kind of teach it for a few minutes how that we are quickened and can we be sure that it's the truth well we know what quickens right we know it's the spirit but the spirit only quickens the word so it's a marvelous thing and then he says he says now it's the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens so the word by by itself becomes what letter and it kill us a lot of people have got the scriptures and they've lined the scriptures up they've studied the scriptures they've put their ideas to the scriptures and and they've drawn a picture but as time changes then a lot of their their teaching has tried to change because they built their teaching on the historical events that were transpiring and you know back in world war one when they had the uh the the countries came together many people taught that that was the ten toes of daniel and and that this event was taking place and and they laid it all up i remember even in the day that we were living in when israel and the suez canal was closed and and and people placed that as a certain event taking place in history but history keeps changing but god's word never changes and so we understand that history doesn't interpret god's word god's word god interprets his own word by bringing it to pass so we understand that it's the spirit that quickens the word and so we don't have to search for a definition we don't have to search for a conclusion we can pray and lay before the lord and the spirit of god will bring us into remembrance of all things that he taught so he didn't leave us comfortless he said i'll come again to you i'll be with you even in you in other words i'll quicken the word to you the things that i taught i will bring to your remembrance i'll quicken him to you i'll make him alive and he says it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word now that's that's the only thing the spirit will quicken because it didn't come to speak of itself or to put a testimony of itself or or the point the spirit of god came to quicken the word to make it live to show you what he said to bring it to your remembrance that you know that's why this bible becomes such a wonderful book and as you grow in the word of god i know when you first when we first enter into the message we have a lot of of understanding and teachings and definitions that were laid down for us there are certain words like rapture that i had a certain idea in my mind what it meant because people shared that with me so much what evidences were but so when i heard the message it i i knew i could feel like the sense it but i still couldn't go back and as the more i saw the understanding the more that this word begin to to come alive to me and fit together and it always marveled me how our messenger would say so many times he would say go back and read it again and see if that's not what it says and well this only person that can do that is the spirit giving you eyes out and quick and you that that that's what it said and and we just grow into this message he says now he says it quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access now i like that i'd like to just preach a whole sermon right there on the access of the spirit in other words the spirit comes down makes that word of life and now that word can go into your circumstance it now has access to your circumstance it now has access to your problem it no longer no longer can anything block it when you have access to something you know these access codes that they have you know and you walk up to them and you can't see the numbers so there's only four numbers that you can't read well you know if you can get those four numbers in the right order you have access you know that's why they change those numbers all the time but we were heard that the spirit is what gives us access it gives us access to the promise it quickens the promise to us makes that word alive and now we have the the the uh backing the filling the leadership of the spirit to go take that promise and apply it to the circumstance oh it just it changes things for it you know it you might have the word like he goes on and says you might you might uh believe it but until it's made alive and quickened to you then it's something you believe and it's not something you possess it's like me looking at a job and saying i need a phillips screwdriver have you ever needed a phillips screwdriver and the only thing you can find is a flathead so you go out and get a bunch of flathead screwdrivers you know what i mean our phillips screwdrivers and pretty soon you know it turns just the other way around you got a bunch of phillips and you know and it just thing well that's kind of like what it is if you believe something but you can't make it work you know you know what you need but you don't have the tool well this the spirit quickens the tool it becomes the tool for what you need and so the letter without it is dead it's intellectual but once the spirit's there quickens and makes it alive it can then it gives access it's the spirit that does that the spirit that gives you access and gives the word access amen allows the word to come into your life and doing you what it promised to do and and i like that because i need a lot of work you know what i mean i mean he's still working on me you know because i'm not what i want to be and i'm not what i ought to be but i know i'm not what i used to be so i know the path that i've taken from where i was when i started this journey that i'm not the same of course as the farther i go down this journey the more baggage i realize i'm carrying with me the cares i'm carrying with me the fears that i'm carrying with me that i don't need to carry you know i mean he's got me thus far he'll take me all the way through that's a that's a promise and and you know as you get closer and and you retire you know there was a a time i felt well i've got some a a little bit of money in a ira i i took comfort that i had that there and because it was there you know i couldn't touch it but at least i knew it was there and then i get a letter that i've got to take it all out i said i'm that old that i got to take it all out and they said yeah you've got to take this out and i says then what do i do with it you go pay taxes on it so i don't have as much as i had before you know i'm just talking a few thousand dollars but and nevertheless you know you don't really want to give any of it away for nothing and and sure enough and all of a sudden i got to thinking said you know really what was that doing for me it was giving me a false sense of security you know i wonder how many people have a false sense of security in the medical world or false insecurity in our government or a false sense of security in even society itself that that you know that they'll say peace and safety but all of a sudden sudden destruction comes we're only safe in one thing and that's in the shed blood of jesus christ that's where we're safe that he promised us that he would never leave us nor forsake us nothing would pluck us out of the palm of his hand that no matter how dark it gets he promised that his elect lady would not go through that tribulation and so that gives us a great a great uh comfort in those things and then he said this he says look at the millions on earth that didn't this is paragraph 60 i probably should be giving you the paragraphs but look at the millions on earth that didn't receive it when jesus was here but how thankful that we should be this morning now this it i think that's real important to god that we're thankful you know how thankful we are to have heard this message i i know each one of us has a different way that we hear it a different way that we follow it a different way we believe it it it's an individual affair and and there's certain basic truths that we can communicate upon but that part of it that's in your heart is personal you know it's a personal revelation and and and we're thankful how thankful we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the bible proof that we are included in that great resurrection morning coming oh that's what we want to make sure everybody has is that great proof that that thankful for direct evidence in other words not secondary evidence not a note from brother david that saying you're going in the rapture i'm sure of it you know but you have direct evidence personal evidence in your life that that resurrection life uh spoken of in romans is living in you he says that great easter and we have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies the the predestinated ones are the first of course to be quickened when the holy spirit comes to claim its own now did that catch anybody else's attention i mean it just i i just stopped in my tracks because he said the predestinated ones are the first of course to be quickened now i wonder i'm not saying i have an answer for this but it looks like that there's a space of grace or an allotment for some to be there you know what i mean that there may be others that follow that are quickened i don't know whether they come out of the millennium i don't know whether god takes his own and then he looks and he sees people that love them and that you love and his grace makes a way for them but that'll that that gave me great rest you know who if there's a first then it it you understand that no i would have expected him to say the only ones that are going to be quickened are the predestinated and i just believe um this is me personally speaking i don't believe that brother branham made random statements that didn't have no meaning you know i i don't know by grace if he was making a way or he maybe there was people there that were just they just god didn't open their eyes they couldn't see it but they'd done so much to help him you know i think so many of the full gospel businessmen that gave the opportunity for brother branham to open the door for him this was at that breakfast but i thought that was a pretty outstanding statement you know that really caught my eye he says the predested ones are the first of course to be quickened when the holy spirit comes to claim his own i thought that was a tremendous statement and then up here he goes on to explain and he says in paragraph 61 he makes this statement his great plan begin to unfold and isn't that what really our messenger has been showing us is the great plan of god unfolding and then this is another great statement he makes in paragraph 63. we won't read the whole thing he says it's the foreknowledge of god taking place god's word and uh so that's what we're just really resting heavy on as we begin to watch this easter seal unfold i believe as the lord unfolds it to us but that work it's the foreknowledge of god taking place that's what the word of god is it's the foreknowledge of god taking place so he said you sitting here tonight right where you are everything is pre-planned by god he knew it he knew it by poor knowledge and now the foreknowledge of god is taking place and we talked that in questions and answers last sunday about how the fullness how what the fullness of god was because everything that was made was made by him and there's nothing that was made that was not made by him so that everything came from him so he knows it all knows when it would be here how it would be here what it looked like and that's why you said the color of your hair the color of your eyes color of your skin the stature you're in every bit of you he knew before the foundation of the world and he knew you'd be sitting here that's pretty comforting unless of course you're not living right and then that puts you under a lot of conviction because if he knew you would be here then he knows what you're doing okay and that's the time you stop and ask for help there's nothing ahead lord you know how i'm going through you know what's my battle and my mind is you know the battle in my flesh you know where i'm at i i can't hide it from you but you can help me and that's what our messenger said about the woman at the well he said that i'm not the woman at the well the woman that washed jesus feet when she went and sold and bought the the appointment the prophet god said she stood there and she said look at him sitting there with dirty feet and so she ran he said and cut the oil and come back but when she got back he was still at the feast when she got back nobody had washed his feet and she she wanted to go but then the mind battle started and he said she wanted to go but she knew he knew where she had got the money okay so she knew he knew okay so the fear of rejection was there do you know he said all ye that are heavy laden come unto you and i'll give you rest and no wise will i cast you away or cast you out so she sat right there she knew all those things were going on and the prophet of god said but she knew he was the only one that could help her i i can you imagine coming up at walking into that presence as you know a messenger would say you know that warm feeling that you're feeling right here that's him or he'd say he's right over you now you can feel that presence on you and then he'd let you know there's no secrets that you know and he would knew but yet he'd stand there and the meanest man in town would come and he'd still have that tender mercy and that spirit and that forgiveness and offer him everything that he purchased at calvary healing deliverance discernment all the things that he purchased he would offer them for them and and yet having complete knowledge of of those things i just think that's that that's so beautiful and then as we read here he said in the 65th verse he said this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out let me read this he says o wayward man or woman this morning when you're sitting here and there's something in you telling you this is right and remember we just read that where he talked it's not something you could put in it's not something you could do but he's telling them there's something in you telling you that this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out to bring you to a knowledge of the truth of this hour that we're now living not some hour that's gone by but the hour now and just think of that i i my own personal way i take this word and i tie it up to the other one it's the foreknowledge of god taking place this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out to bring you to the foreknowledge to what god had in mind of you to be and that's what the holy spirit still does you can believe this and live it but if there's some place that god wants you to be in your life some character some work that he has for you to do some way for you to please and serve him that spirit will keep working on you and calling you to bring you to that place amen he will not leave you nor forsake you he'll forgive you of all unrighteousness and that his will can be performed in you i just i just think these things and then as we we closed up with it's the hour that's what makes that new creation so we're gonna listen to 16 more minutes uh tonight and uh i i hope that those that were here this morning that are going to follow with us through this easter seal that they listen at home of course you are at home i wish you were here but that's all i can do i guess is wish maybe i could send an email or a text out or something but i guess that won't work and i i hope that someday i don't say i wish you were here in the rapture you know but i'll be happy if i make it so i just trusting i'll make it so i know there's a lot of circumstances some people on vacation we pray for them we don't want to uh uh forget uh i i forget how you say her name annadell or on the dale is how you say it or addedale little two and a half pounds 15 ounce baby that was there and and uh that doesn't scare me uh guys i saw brother caleb he was pretty little remember sister jeannie my goodness i don't think he was as big as this water bottle was he what did you feed that boy you know anyway god certainly took care of him and natalie was a a few pounds she wasn't very uh big when she sprung up i want to say like a flower everybody says weed i just decide that doesn't sound good but uh she certainly a lord took care of her and we've seen very we've seen god do a little thing and and i guess uh brianna when she was come home she was only three pounds something but she was full term full healthy and everything it's just uh you know that's about half as much as gabrielle weighs so that's uh anyway the lord's the lord's been good to us hadn't he so we're grateful for that and we just trust that the lord will bless you so i think you'll enjoy this next uh 16 minutes because remember what the prophet of god saying he says i want to open this up to you because there's something in this hour this quickening power and how you get it and i know this is but this messenger's word was something that had to be preached right and now if that word's preached and it's in your heart now the spirit has something it can come bring to life it's got to be something it can identify with so you can have people out there and they can preach and what they get is they get an anointing they get the spirit that falls on the just and unjust the scripture says but they know it not but when that seed is in there he remember he drew that little serpent and you could do that little thing and he said this can fall but that falls on that seed then when that word falls on that believer's heart and that believer's seed now he can quicken that word because the holy spirit come to quicken that word we don't want the rain that falls on the justin unjust we want the resurrection life okay so i i don't want to get too doctrinal and separating but there is a reign a blessing of the holy spirit that falls upon everybody and then there's something that's given to the elect that's going to resurrect them and put them in the rapture that has a way to be delivered and the way it was delivered was through the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 delivering something to the elect and brother ben's going to talk about it here i'm just preempting about something that's magnetized and and drawn that can be connected that the spirit can quicken so he came forth he preached out his message it falls into the ears of the believer it goes down in their heart now that spirit can come and make that alive if you don't sow it it can't be quickened and brought to life so we understand the importance of the message being preached in our day because god sends a messenger but he predestinates a seed to be there to receive it that he can now prove it to be true so you see where you are in the process you're receiving the word we've received the word now we come to that point where we know it we know it's true we know who we are we believe it with all our heart and there's a hunger in us to to make it a reality in us like i i like uh the prophet of god talks about the the laundry ticket remember it's got two parts and so now we've got this part is who we are and to have faith in who we are and what the word of god says about it so we have this part and we believe this part but there seems to be a chasm in between a gap in between and now we're crying uh for completion we're crying that this that we know is now connects up with us and makes us the full image that we grow into the full image but the first thing that god does is as we hold this so picture yourself on this side of the chasm and you believe who you are you know who you are you believe every word but yet you you sense in your spirit that you're calling for something to make it real in your life in every part of your life and he knows that so what he does he says right before the end he sends his angels to mark them that are sighing and crying so he's got to put us in a position that we're sighing and crying in order that he can mark us that we don't go into the judgment and then this connection is going to take place and we're going to have the full life the full token the full resurrection and and that's our messenger plays a great part in that in our lives so we're going to pick back up if you have your phones i guess or your books or or you can read on the board in paragraph 68 as he begins to speak and we're just going to read over through uh paragraph 105 16 minutes i think you'll enjoy it and god bless you tonight it sounded a little sacrilegious but i hope it don't tell you this morning the farmer that set the eagle or set the hand and had an eagle egg many of you remembers the story of the old eagle giving birth to to this uh or the hand giving birth over here to this chicken or egg of eagle under her chicken feathers see it's the atmosphere the presbyterian church methodist church baptist church any of them can bring forth these eagles sure it's the atmosphere that does it as dr bosworth you say you could take a hand egg and put it over a under a pup and time down a puppet hatch out of chicken wow it's the atmosphere and when any church or any group that'll civil themselves together and pray until they're throw away their creeds and things look straight in the face of god it'll bring forth eagles just as hurt as i'm standing here amen that's what i think this businessman's group has done trying to break up the atmosphere we're getting to clannish one belongs to this and that let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a heavenly worship get the atmosphere right eagles will be born and out of any church anywhere right and this little eagle walked with the end for a long time but the the clocking was kind of strange he didn't understand what the hen meant when she scratched in the the the waste of the manure piles in in the yards and that wasn't food to him and she eat bugs and so forth that eagle doesn't eat so it seems strange all to him and he was an ugly duckling he was uh not saying this sacrilegious maybe it's a free will baptist and but something on that order or presbyterian but you know one day his mother knew that she had laid an egg there had to be a child somewhere so she throwed her big wings into the winds and she searched and she searched screaming to the top of her voice and one day she passed over the barnyard and when this little eagle heard this familiar scream he had never heard it before but he realized that it fit him like a glove over him and he knew that was his mother she knew that was her son she was looking for him so has god in every age ordained his church for that age a message for that age and they could have laws in anything that they want to but when that hour comes the holy spirit of god which is at the beginning thought out and spoke out for that age that spirit hunts that egg and when he hears that message there is no church denomination going to hold it it'll rise to the heights oh hallelujah it's got to it's a different bird it's a different creature he's an eagle and he'll hear the scream my sheep hear my voice someone said brother williams sheep food my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow no matter how loyal the church has been how much its bigger name is scott when my sheep hear my voice which is the word amen a stranger they will not follow they'll go right straight to that word they can't do it it's like a a magnet one day up in indiana i was visiting them steel mills and the whistle blowed and everybody took off their aprons and began to sweep the out from their lanes out into the middle of the floor the shavens that they made through the day and i was walking along with the man that was taking me through and he said watch this and so every man ladies is bench dressed up on the up on the table walked away way back in the back he touched the little button and here come a big magnet through and it picked up every bit of that the iron that was shaved off of those pieces now it went out it demagnetized it it dropped into a cupola and was melded over for another piece of of goods the same thing axles or whatever they were building and i stood there and looked at that until i i just lost myself and i said i'm wondering something he said what is it sir and i said i noticed that some of that didn't go up he said it's aluminum and the magnet is not magnetized to the aluminum i said i see and he said then i said well you notice there's a piece of iron laying across but you see sir it was bolted down i said i see and uh when he took it out and i said now what happened is that out there it says it goes right back into the mill poured out through the cupola he comes right back and makes another wheel i said praise the lord that's it see there is a great magnet sitting in the sky that god one day i'll touch his fingers to no man knows the time is coming not even the angels of heaven doesn't know god alone knows that's it but there has been some trimmings that's come off of the bible bible christians believers for this hour one of them might have been an axel back in another day this might be some other part it's going on to make the big regime of god but it'll be molded into the pop of god's great cupola and poured out again into the images of god and just those who are magnetized to it will be taken up oh out of what a privilege it is to know that there is something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us now notice it recognize the call of god's word which is a part of and it's an eagle to an eagle now if that mother would have screamed like a a buzzard he'd never noticed he'd been just as well off in the barnyard but it was a scream of an eagle there was something inside that little fella that he knowed he was an eagle and the same thing is with every true believer when this preaching of god's word comes forth and vindicated and proved that it's god's word for this hour then there's something within the believer i don't care how loyal his father was to a church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents and if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message there's something in him it screams out he'll leave the barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this is eagle hour see it's a different it's something that he must leave the old cook and fly away into the blue then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of god's word now when this holy spirit represented as an eagle flying over the land and finds the believer no man can come to me no man can come to me as he wants to all the father has given me will come to me but no man can come by himself it isn't your own thinking your own drawing it's god drawing see all the father has given me will come to me now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on jesus christ the great super son of god he who redeemed us all it comes down and takes his place of abode into the human life now notice brought the quickening power now that quickening power that come upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery holy spirit if it's not the devil mock in the holy spirit but is the real true holy spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour when it fell upon luther it manifested that promise of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell upon moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell upon noah it manifests the promise of that hour when it fell upon jesus it manifests the promise of that hour see it's a holy spirit coming down to quicken make alive those people that's four ordained of god to be in the rapture most that is if he is a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle now the little eagle problem in the barn yard was eating all right but he you know it wasn't just exactly right but then when he heard the truth then he received this truth now in john 14 uh john 5 24 rather jesus said speaking this way he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment but pass from death unto life just think how simple it is he that believeth now the correct way of saying that he that understandeth now while you're on the street and say to this prostitute you believe sure you believe the son of god certainly been baptized sure grant the drunkard say you hear that you're that preacher preached yeah you believe that sure see but he that understandeth amen he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into judgment but it's already passed from death unto life then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality let me say again when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential like if you ask me for an oak tree and i'll give you an acre now the the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up so do we when you receive the holy spirit of god it's god's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you're sealed by the spirit of promise of god into the body of christ when god looked down at calvary and seen jesus dying he not all he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word of god for the age whether his feet body head or wherever it is see it's christ was bleeding and dying and god looking upon him saw his resurrection and the church raised with him on easter now i want you to get all this together cause i got something here a little bit i want to say the lord willing i notice it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you [Music] you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the grace and knowledge of god you are baptized into the holy spirit now as a pentecostal church baptized into the holy spirit it's begin growing limbs has died it's pruned them all but the trees still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickness come the first limb second limb third limb or if it just keeps quickening the spirit of god keeps quickening to you notice that pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received that makes me feel religious think now here was man fishermen tax collectors the humble little women other just ordinary housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth they believed that when jesus died they believed on him and rose up again from the dead they believed that to be the absolutely testimony of god that he had quickened him to life now they go up to the day of pentecost to receive their abstract you know what an abstract is is when a deeds been cleared they went up there to receive their abstract and they become quickened or what a thrill they bought the land been bought for him they had received it is it true or not we seen him raise up but now what about us we are witnesses we stood and seen the man crucified we seen the clouds come over the earth and darken the skies and the the earthquake and shook and had nervous prostration then when they put him in the grave they speared him in the heart with the spear and they took his body down and laid in the grave of joseph from armenia and then they find out that on the third day he raised up again and as the disciples said we are witnesses of this we seen him raise up we know he's alive now what did that do that took all the fear out no wonder jesus said fear not i'm he that was dead and is alive forevermore you're taking all the fear out when they did that now but when they went up to pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive now there's where i think that you presbyterian and meth i'll point out another statement that uh brother branham made that um to me there's the there are these little hidden comments that they slip by us so quickly and it's in paragraph 73 if we could put up there and and again uh it's it's one of those inserts that brother branham makes in statements that he's preaching and he'll insert something in there and and you know i've probably you know like i said i've probably listened to this message several times over the course of um my years in the message but it seems like it becomes more alive every time you know and i i went back in who is this melchizedek and i found an old copy of who is this malteser that and to went and to look at the things that i underlined and there wasn't one thing that i underlined in my most recent listening that was in what i underlined ten years ago you know i just i just i marveled at what stood out to me then well that's what i needed then you understand it was perfectly ordained of god because that's what i needed and he said as we grow into the statue of a perfect man as we grow into the rapture we can't be afraid of the fact that we're growing you know nobody can come up and challenge you and say that you ought to be further along than this or you ought to know these things are you out of this no man makes that determination but the tutor himself he's the one that teaches he's the one that reshapes and molds the clay so he's the one that's doing the work but i want to if if you don't mind we're just we're taking our time right and we're looking at this message we can go home and read it we can listen to it other things will stand out to you that that don't stand out to me as the pastor i'm just giving us an opportunity for all of us to listen to it and i can just share with you what things stand out to me um and i'd be more than happy to listen to the things that stand out to you also but he says so god so has god in every age ordained his church for that age a message for that age now look at this next sentence i mean it struck me and they could have laws in anything that they want to but when the hour comes the holy spirit of god which was at the beginning throughout and spoke out for that age the spirit hunts that egg now it's almost like a warning you understand he says there's going to be laws and you know that that there is a great move amongst the the idea that to do away with the privileges that churches have they've always through our country they've given benefits tax benefits to churches little subtle tax benefits for ministries and different things because they felt that those ministries helped with the morals of the country and helped to promote a a lifestyle that didn't involved in crime also that they promoted charity of doing good works and helping everybody so man thought it was beneficial to have religion uh uh at work in our country a few years back and i'm not going into politics is as far as what's right or wrong you know it's like our messenger said i don't care whether you're a republican or a socialist it doesn't mean uh one thing uh but a few years back they they were going to do a program where they were going to take money and give it to charities and let the charities distribute the money if it was they were going to try to plate the welfare department and distribute it through charities and i think that it meant a challenge of the separation of church and state but the idea was the thought of it do you understand now there's millions and millions of dollars of untaxed property in the country plus they give you a tax benefit that if you give dollars to charitable organizations that's just what they do and they do not charge property tax on churches and the land the churches own but as our our country and our lifestyle means more and more uh for economic help and as as you you know the the gap between uh wealth and poverty always grows larger and it's just because people that have money they make money it just it's just one of the things that is almost the law the that's why the love of money is the root of all evil but they sit back and they say we could use that tax money to do a lot of social good and they probably could you know i might not agree with it but if what our country is based on what the majority of the people vote for then that's how that we'd go i mean that's just how we live in it in this place we don't have a dictator we don't have a king god's way to rule is with a king not with the president to have a righteous king that's that's that god would have the the rule be a king that had a heart for the people but this is what he said he said they may have laws so they're thinking about taxing i don't know what rate it would be at it might not be as high as your property tax i know some of you here own homes some of you rent homes some of you rent apartments but the owner of those things pays property tax i don't know if any of you got your last property tax bill but i like to died you know i had a little old house and they just decided that that house was worth uh 30 more percent than it was last year and i didn't see it you know but they don't care they just say hey pay some more money look if if they came to us and they said okay we're re-changing your tax structure now you're going to have to pay taxes and we we've got four acres here that we have in this building this building is appraised on the tarrant county tax rolls for eight hundred thousand dollars the property next to us is appraised for i don't know three or four hundred thousand dollars but because we're tax exempt then it's it's not the problem but can you imagine all of a sudden that they want the taxes even at two percent you you understand or or three it or three percent i lost my mic or something fell oh it's okay what phil you you dropped something you're scaring me to death yeah but i i i i'm just pointing out that to you because it's very easy for us to put our heads in the sand you understand and i know we forget about the world around us but this message as the world goes more and more and takes on satan's thinking the more and more they feel they don't need you and the more and more they feel that you become an obstacle to what they're doing you know just like who when they wanted to begin to teach our young children i'll just use the that this terminology you'll remember that when they begin to teach our children they wanted to start teaching in fifth and sixth grade the reproductive system of human beings and they wanted to you know take the girls and tell them all this and the boys and and and and you know now me personally i believe that belongs between mother and daughter and and it's a responsibility of the fathers to talk to their boys and and to tell them how to be gentlemen and how to act and how to talk and and the things we we don't do we can cover those things generally in church in terminologies that's understood but if it wasn't given to the school to do that that was my opinion and christians were a voice against that but the trouble is our voice is becoming in a minority they don't need to hear from us anymore because there's another thing that has to get fulfilled and that's the iniquity of the amorites it's got to get to a place where god can no longer stand it and we can no longer stand that and we start crying out for our deliverance from this because it's going to become abominable to us the the things that that trans expire and that abomination of daniel is going to come to that place where it's got to be fulfilled so i i thought it was something that the prophet of god said they may make laws now what would inspire him to in assert that statement and they could have laws in anything they want to what a warning god in every age has a message for that age and they could have laws in other words laws that i can't sit here and say that this this acceptance of homosexuality as being a normal way of life when the word of god directly says it's contrary that god give them over to a reprobate mind working that which is unseemingly the word of god's very plain on that you know but you become a it's a hate crime to preach life to people and we can't sit back and ignore the fact that this great uh eden that satan has made that he takes the position of the god of this evil age and we know that god is an object of worship so satan's developing a society he's developing a way of thinking he's developing a social network he's developing a social consciousness he's developing uh what what people feel is right and wrong and how they should treat one another and make up for past sins and and all these things he's inserting all these things into our society that are contrary to the word of god they're just contrary to the word of god i thank god that he sent his prophet in the time he sent them because that was probably the last time that that voice could have went out without some sort of legal you couldn't even use some of the words the prophet of god used now it would be offensive but we're not offended in the word of god i'm not offended by the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god unto salvation i'm not going to let the the social world divide my heart from the love of my brother look a christian has the love of god shed abroad in their heart by the holy spirit it's not their love it's not david mcgary's love this quickening power that he's talking about that comes on the believer before the rapture is a quickening power that is the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ and he died on the cross for all men he died on the cross for all sicknesses he died on the cross for everybody that would receive him and we can't be any different and and we're talking about a time that what was prophesied to us that a squeeze would come and we're feeling that squeeze we're feeling the embarrassment i hate to sit in a restaurant and i get stirred up and i start talking and everybody's going shh he said what did i say you can't say that you can't talk like that today can you imagine that what we're pretty sure we're just gonna have to walk around with our hands in our pockets you know and and draw a little uh uh a little pillar of fire in the sand you know just a just a little switch like that and we know it's that pillar of fire right there you know we just know just the right angle to draw it you know i look at you and you look at me and you put your hand out peel our fire and we don't hallelujah you know in other words he says he's given us an understanding of these things they said they'll take these places and turn them into a storehouses so cook what happens if the squeeze comes if they tax us out of existence you know what i mean if we can't preach the gospel freely because there's so many things that people become offended in and the scripture is blessed is he who's not offended in me any christian that stands up regardless of race color creed you're going to meet it amongst the very uh society that you come from that the christian is going to stand out as an oddball that's thus saith the lord from the messenger of the hour and we're not always going to have the freedom that we have so it behooves us well the opportunity is present and as this messenger begins to talk about this power that is quickened to the believer that can't be taken away just he's saying that she is going to go on and hunt that egg so that spirit in us even if the government tells us no we are still going to be looking for that last soul we are still going to be preaching this word we are still going to be trying to deliver the resurrection power to whoever will receive it we are not identified with anything my identity lies in the word of god which is christ jesus and every one of us is going to have to make that stand it's easy for me because i'm in the twilight of my life but it's harder on you young people i noticed the other day that they could they just eliminated 500 so many million dollars of student loans well i know who those guys are going to vote for i just felt terrible bad i didn't have one nice to go borrow money and just have someone wipe the loan away you know let me tell you you borrow something you still owe it you know so you know it that's just the way it is you know i mean i can i i tell a lot of people don't worry about it you don't owe me nothing and i'll let it go but let me tell you there's another side of that scripture you understand you better pass the same grace onto somebody else you know when you get something you better be able to help give down the road you know what i mean you just don't go take something and then use it for your own benefit and think you got away with it you don't get away with anything with the lord he may give you forgiveness and mercy but he said as i have loved you so do you love others what i've done for you you also do for others father forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us i i just thought how amazing it was he said there could be laws but it's not going to stop the spirit of god from moving so i think this is a great time that we listen to this message and we understand that he's laying the framework here and he's go talking and he's going to get deeper into what that quickening power is what effect that quickening power has how it brings that word to life what that kicking power does for you and what that quickening power does through you to others and so we would we would i think would be naive if we didn't feel that the world is not going to give us resistance i don't think we have to be afraid because he said that eliminates our fear but you know he is going to make it scary he may threaten you with your job you may say you have to work on sundays i don't know what he'll do but i know one thing the righteous shall not date bread you say how's it going to work i don't know but that's what he said you know i don't know if we can go places without you know different things i know this vaccine was a great thing about vaccinated passports and where you've got to be vaccinated before you can travel and and all those things and all that control let me tell you something you guys know this it's planted as a seed first ah there it is yes sir and then eventually it works toward it you go read in the church age book about the trail of sin and the joining of the church and the state and how it started out and how it does and then everybody that has a claim of christianity all the trinitarian churches all join together and they back with the government yeah we're the ones we're the social ones this is just a cult you know what i mean and they hate people you know they preach against divorce and drug use and alcohol abuse and and and having televisions when my children were young my children were young they went to school first and second grade or something and told the teacher that we didn't have a television and the child protection agency sent someone out to our house to check us out it was just god's grace that i wasn't there because by the time leslie got done talking to her she felt that she might need the holy ghost you know but and you say birmingham this isn't what we want to hear i just want you to know that there's wolves out there that's right okay and we would we would not we would be foolish not to realize that our enemy is fixing to do battle and the battle is going to be in our minds and we have a weapon and that weapon is not the bible unrevealed but it's the revealed word of god for the hour and that's why you'll hear them throughout this message talk about the word for the hour not for another day the word for the hour the word for this hour he said baptist methodist and presbyterian could not produce eagle food we just heard it it's not there this is where it is that's going to be able he said they cannot meet the challenge for the hour there's one place that meets the challenge for the hour and that's the revealed word of god for the age i know that he's going to try to make us embarrassed that we have a picture like this in our church or make us embarrassed that we listen to tapes you're following a man i hope that you can look past that veil and see that we're not following a man there was something else that was revealing himself through that man that we heard and caught because we caught the eagle stream and god's going to have that church whether they make laws or not that's going to listen to it i just thought that was a very interesting insert in there and i i hope that you get involved in those of you that are at home uh that you that you join us in this study of the easter seal and that you enjoy it in and you would contribute through your prayers and through your pulling from the word of god so lord bless you he it's perfectly how he said that we're just going to grow up into that statue of that resurrection so lord richly bless you tonight ask billy to come and lead again in a song and dismissal this evening hey man it's our stand [Music] gee [Music] oh and i hear the call [Music] moving me
