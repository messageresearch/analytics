[24:38] Jesus Christ's name
[24:41] amen amen so good to be in the house of
[24:44] the Lord and I tell you it's wonderful
[24:46] to think about the love of God that
[24:49] gives us fellowship with the Beloved
[24:51] thank you musicians we certainly
[24:53] appreciate all of you and we just go
[24:56] right to the word of God and I have a
[24:58] little thought that I wanted to speak to
[25:01] you tonight Lord where is your
[25:05] Elijah amen you want to turn with me to
[25:08] Psalms
[25:11] 46 just a little inspiration thinking
[25:15] about some of the things that our pastor
[25:17] has been ministering on and some of the
[25:19] other brothers you know I I think it's
[25:21] an hour and a time where you know we
[25:24] really need to be in prayer you know I
[25:27] think that uh a lot of times people ask
[25:30] for vision and things like that and me
[25:31] being one of them but I believe that if
[25:34] we can go consecrated in prayer God
[25:37] would give us a whole lot amen real
[25:40] consecrated prayer for the cause I
[25:42] believe can move mountains Amen in
[25:46] Psalms 46 says
[25:49] this God is our refuge in strength a
[25:53] very present help in time of
[25:57] trouble he is always
[26:00] present our God is here tonight he's
[26:03] here to meet your needs he's here to
[26:05] meet my needs we're needy people and God
[26:08] is here
[26:11] amen therefore will not we fear though
[26:16] the Earth be removed and though the
[26:18] mountains be carried into the midst of
[26:21] the sea though the waters thereof Roar
[26:24] and are troubled though the mountains
[26:26] shake with swelling their of sa there is
[26:29] a river and the streams thereof shall
[26:33] make glad the city of God the holy place
[26:36] of the Tabernacles of the most high God
[26:39] is in the midst of her and she shall not
[26:42] be moved God shall help her and that
[26:46] right early amen thank God for that and
[26:49] if you want to turn over to Matthew
[26:51] chapter 17 we're just going to read a
[26:53] couple more scriptures and then we'll
[26:55] have you take your seats but there in
[26:57] Matthew 17 a familiar scripture in verse
[27:00] 10 it says this we'll give you another
[27:03] minute to get
[27:09] there Matthew 17:10 it says and his
[27:12] disciples asked him saying why then say
[27:15] the scribes that Elias must first come
[27:18] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[27:21] Elias truly shall come first and restore
[27:24] all things but I say unto you that Elias
[27:27] has come already and they knew not that
[27:30] they had done unto him whatsoever they
[27:34] listed likewise shall the son of man
[27:36] suffer of them amen and one more
[27:39] scripture found in John first
[27:42] John first John chapter 1 we'll read
[27:46] those five verses 5 through 10 chap 1
[27:51] John chapter 1 verses 5-10
[27:59] this then is the message which we have
[28:02] heard of him and declare unto you that
[28:06] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[28:09] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[28:13] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[28:16] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[28:20] light as he is in the light we have
[28:22] Fellowship one with another and the
[28:24] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[28:27] us from all sin if we say that we have
[28:31] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[28:35] truth is not in us if we confess our
[28:39] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[28:42] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[28:47] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[28:49] not sinned we make him a liar and the
[28:52] word is not in US amen you have your you
[28:56] can have your seats we trust the Lord
[28:58] Lord will open his word to us
[29:01] tonight you know I I thought it was
[29:03] interesting it says if we confess our
[29:07] sins God is faithful and we know the
[29:11] scriptures and these are all familiar
[29:12] scriptures but you know I got to
[29:15] thinking about you know how God made man
[29:17] in his own image and God Made You and I
[29:21] creators amen you're living in a world
[29:25] you know we've heard the quote that says
[29:27] you know a man filled with the spirit of
[29:30] God can go create a world and live on it
[29:33] and I believe that's what we do every
[29:35] day every single day you're creating a
[29:39] world that you're living in how do you
[29:41] how do you make that statement brother
[29:43] well there's many times people they are
[29:46] doing like what they they would tell a
[29:49] you know like hey I'm going to have a
[29:51] misfortune or I'm always you know it's
[29:54] just this and that and I've always
[29:56] failed here and I've always failed there
[29:58] there well they're creating a failure to
[30:00] come amen but when we take and confess
[30:03] the word of God and God has something to
[30:05] work with then if we confess the word of
[30:08] God now God is a high priest that now
[30:11] makes intercession upon those things
[30:13] that you profess and what we're Desiring
[30:15] is to come into Unity of heart we want
[30:18] the love of God to constrain us to go
[30:21] and obey every word amen that's the Cry
[30:24] of the believer's heart tonight is to
[30:26] have a certain kind of atmosphere where
[30:28] God and man can become one and now God
[30:30] can come and materialize his word and
[30:32] flesh again amen that's what we want to
[30:35] be we want to be yielded vessels amen I
[30:38] want to be like a real handmade amen
[30:42] that's just just a little subject I
[30:43] wanted to talk about I believe that
[30:45] Jesus Christ Bride is a real handmade
[30:48] she just like Mary said be it unto me
[30:50] according to Thy word
[30:52] amen but this little inspiration came to
[30:55] me and I just you know there there so
[30:58] many things in our world in your world
[31:00] in the world that's around us that they
[31:03] try to get like our nature is sticky so
[31:06] there's things that try to corrupt and
[31:08] pollute our atmosphere and make us talk
[31:11] like the world act like the world think
[31:13] like the world but God has come to cut
[31:16] away and bring the Waters of separation
[31:19] and that we by the blood of Jesus can
[31:21] express the Life of Christ amen that we
[31:24] don't no longer say oh I'm just a sinner
[31:27] oh I'll never be this and that I'll be
[31:29] exactly what he said amen by the grace
[31:31] of God I am what I
[31:34] am you know and I just said like you
[31:37] know it it it's powerful to know that
[31:40] you're a Creator and you're creating you
[31:43] know there's people that you just love
[31:44] to be around why is that because they
[31:47] create a certain atmosphere you know no
[31:49] matter the negativity that comes their
[31:51] way they always try to find the positive
[31:54] in it amen that's what like what faith
[31:56] does is it takes the negative and turns
[31:58] it into a positive what he intended for
[32:01] a curse God brings and pulls it back as
[32:03] a blessing the scripture says all things
[32:06] work together for the good to those who
[32:08] love God how many love God tonight the
[32:11] trials the struggles the different
[32:13] difficulties it's working for
[32:15] good the circumstances doesn't dictate
[32:18] the goodness of
[32:20] God praise God you know but this
[32:24] atmosphere of prayer that's what I want
[32:26] to have you know the Bible says that
[32:29] pray without ceasing we pray continually
[32:32] I realize there's a lot of things that
[32:33] try to pollute our atmosphere but I want
[32:36] to keep my mind stay on the word of God
[32:38] I want to be in prayer I want an
[32:41] atmosphere of prayer that when God comes
[32:43] by my way I can just know God that's you
[32:46] that's what I believe God did in this
[32:48] generation brother brenham's walking and
[32:50] he' been praying some situation happened
[32:52] he's like oh God said just go walking
[32:55] and he started walking there was this
[32:57] communion there was this Unity there was
[32:59] Oneness you know the scripture says the
[33:01] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[33:04] Amen that's what I'm expecting tonight
[33:06] I'm expecting the spirit of God to
[33:08] move not just to you know to fulfill my
[33:12] expectation that he's going to do it but
[33:14] God that you're going to be here to
[33:16] reveal what your expectation for us is
[33:19] amen I don't want it to just be
[33:21] one-sided I want it to be the two parts
[33:24] coming together ah God I'm here to serve
[33:27] you and your purpose not my will
[33:35] amen oh praise the
[33:40] Lord you know this atmosphere of prayer
[33:43] with the love of God in our hearts amen
[33:47] that's what I want I want an atmosphere
[33:49] of prayer constantly with the love of
[33:51] God in my heart amen because you know
[33:53] when when when that is in a reality it's
[33:56] not just a teaching or workup but this
[33:59] is something that is it was just out of
[34:01] Thanksgiving God you paid the price can
[34:03] you imagine if I still felt the guilt of
[34:06] my sin and my shame and but but he's
[34:09] come and he's liberated the burden of
[34:11] sin now I know that it was oh God you
[34:15] know it was God coming to display his
[34:18] attribute of Savior how can I know God
[34:21] in the power of his resurrection as a
[34:23] savior if I wasn't lost how would
[34:26] anybody ever know unless they been been
[34:28] sicken you know there's a lot of
[34:30] sickness going around but praise God our
[34:33] God is able to do for us what we need
[34:36] amen God is an everpresent help in the
[34:39] time of need
[34:41] amen but I I want to display something
[34:44] real a real handmade amen that's what
[34:47] the world is dying for is the love of
[34:50] God in our hearts acting and doing and
[34:53] breathing and moving not reacting on the
[34:56] negativity
[34:58] but acting on the word of God the bubble
[35:01] the bubbling Fountain amen I'm just here
[35:04] to open my heart to you and just let God
[35:07] speak amen we might be here for just a
[35:10] few minutes but maybe
[35:15] not you
[35:17] know you know they say
[35:20] uh it's supposed to be a special day
[35:23] tomorrow but you know it's just like

[35:30] Christ on Christmas every day is Merry
[35:33] Christmas amen every day God can
[35:36] resurrect and come in and be born in our
[35:39] flesh amen that's the kind of attitude I
[35:41] want to have every day I'm looking for
[35:44] the love of God to move in my heart to
[35:47] see the power of the Resurrection on
[35:49] display to bring my flesh subject praise
[35:53] God we might be looking and say it's a
[35:55] lot easier for that fellow but for me I
[35:57] want to to say tonight God let me be thy
[36:00] handmade amen amen this was preached in
[36:03] 1956 I want to quote to you out of the
[36:06] message love in 1956 on July 26
[36:12] 7:26 he says you
[36:15] believe in being led by the spirit of
[36:19] God I turned and started walking back
[36:23] passed on by a hotel and kept walking I
[36:26] looked at my wife
[36:28] watch already already seven I missed my
[36:31] limousine on down on down till I came
[36:34] down in a little color district and the
[36:37] where the color people sun was way down
[36:40] or way
[36:41] up that
[36:43] way yeahall miss my plane but something
[36:47] just kept telling me to walk so I just
[36:50] kept walking he says that's the way
[36:53] don't question God do what he tells you
[36:56] to do amen so I just kept walking and
[36:59] after a while laying at AR across the
[37:02] gate there was a little typical Aunt
[37:04] Jima with her man's shirt tied around
[37:08] her head she was tears running down her
[37:11] cheeks and I passed by she said good
[37:14] morning Parson and I said good morning
[37:17] Auntie walked on by I said well how she
[37:21] said Parson and I turned back and says
[37:24] pardon me a minute
[37:26] Anthony he says you called me Parson she
[37:29] said yes sir I said how did you know I
[37:32] was a
[37:33] Parson said I know you was
[37:37] coming I said you knew I was coming said
[37:42] yes sir she said I've been standing here
[37:46] since
[37:47] 4:00 and I looked at her I said well
[37:49] bless your heart she was wet on her back
[37:53] she said yes sir I've been standing here
[37:56] said do you did you ever read in the
[38:00] story of the shemite
[38:03] woman I said yes ma'am she's like she
[38:07] said I was that kind of woman she said I
[38:11] had promised the Lord if he'd give me a
[38:14] baby I'd raise him for
[38:17] him and said he gave me a fine boy she
[38:22] said Parson I raised that boy and when
[38:26] he got to be a man said a young man he
[38:29] got with some of the wrong
[38:31] company and he gone wrong and said he
[38:35] got a bad
[38:37] disease a Venero disease and said and he
[38:41] is in there dying and said two days he's
[38:45] been unconscious and the doctor man says
[38:49] there's no
[38:51] hope we's good family here we've never
[38:54] thought of anything like that he's dying
[38:57] he's backslid she said
[39:01] Parson I just can't stand to know that
[39:04] my baby's dying without knowing the Lord
[39:06] Jesus
[39:10] Christ you know I
[39:13] just I can't help but think about it the
[39:17] power of a mother's love The Power of a
[39:20] Praying
[39:22] Mother a a woman a mother a handmade
[39:26] that knows the Promises of God that's
[39:31] powerful
[39:32] Parson I can't stand to know my baby
[39:37] dying without knowing the Lord Jesus I
[39:40] said what Mother
[39:42] Love she said I prayed for two days and
[39:47] said this morning around 3:00 I was
[39:51] dreaming I dreamed I was talking to the
[39:54] Lord the Lord where is your Elijah he
[39:58] said I seen a man coming in a gray suit
[40:01] with a little bitty semi-western
[40:04] hat that's the way I was
[40:08] dressed my just think about
[40:11] it the the power of prayer to bring God
[40:16] on the scene Amen in a time of
[40:20] need oh my think of that
[40:28] he was a great fine boy there he looked
[40:30] about to be 18 and the blanket was over
[40:33] his hand going it's dark it's dark here
[40:37] I said what's the matter with him can't
[40:39] talk no he's been unconscious two days I
[40:42] think he he thinks he's out in a big
[40:45] deep sea he's in a dark and lost and the
[40:48] tears running down her big old fat
[40:52] cheeks and she said that's it Parson I
[40:56] can't stand to he that my baby died and
[40:59] had that in my heart the rest of my days
[41:02] that's that my baby was
[41:04] lost think about this you think about
[41:08] the situations you're going through but
[41:10] this real handmade of God did not want
[41:14] the testimony of her son to be lost she
[41:17] said I can't live with this kind of
[41:19] testimony why because the word of God
[41:23] promised thy house amen huh I mean there
[41:27] is something about a real believer a
[41:31] real handmade to take God at his word
[41:34] and hold to the promise she was there
[41:36] praying two days that boy was
[41:39] unconscious and she identified with the
[41:41] word I'm like that shite woman I made
[41:44] the vow and promise that I would raise
[41:46] him and I did so but he got around the
[41:49] wrong
[41:51] crowd I mean there's a lot of folks that
[41:54] we know that the environment the
[41:56] atmosphere has pulled people into the
[41:58] wrong crowd but we can be like this
[42:00] shemite woman we can be in prayer and we
[42:04] can go to God and we can know that he
[42:06] promised it you ask anything in my name
[42:09] and I'll do
[42:11] it we just want to have the atmosphere
[42:14] of prayer with the love of God in our
[42:16] heart
[42:20] amen you get so caught up in your closet
[42:23] you start speaking things you don't even
[42:24] know nothing about get into that channel
[42:28] where intercessory starts activating
[42:31] amen get so turned loose of this world
[42:34] we're not worried about the bills we're
[42:35] not worried about health conditions on
[42:37] our of ourselves if we're about his
[42:39] business he'll take care of ours
[42:50] amen I
[42:52] can't I can't to stand to hear my baby
[42:56] die
[42:57] and have that on my heart the rest of my
[43:00] days that's my baby was
[43:03] lost I thought baby weighed 800 180
[43:09] lbs now but that was a mother's love no
[43:14] matter what he done he still he was
[43:18] still
[43:20] baby he was still her loving
[43:24] child I looked at it and I couldn't
[43:26] hardly choked back to tears looking at
[43:29] her and he was very bad he is a dying
[43:33] he's a dying Parson the doctor man said
[43:37] don't call him no more he's
[43:39] gone I felt his feet they were real
[43:42] sticky and I felt like oh you you how a
[43:46] person gets real cold and sticky and the
[43:48] feet felt cold well I guess maybe he is
[43:53] then so
[43:55] then he just kept pulling this
[43:59] and will you let us pray then
[44:04] auntie and she got down there and looked
[44:07] over me and and got the foot on I got at
[44:11] the foot of the bed and held the boy by
[44:13] the foot by the feet I said Auntie will
[44:16] you lead us in prayer she said yes
[44:19] pawson oh brother you talk about a
[44:22] prayer I just cried like a baby to hear
[44:25] that Old Saint and it was just quiet and
[44:29] cool said Lord Jesus she said last night
[44:33] when I spoke to
[44:35] you when you
[44:37] spoke to me your poor handmade in a
[44:41] dream and you told me that this Parson
[44:44] was coming and I know that my baby was
[44:47] going to speak to me and say he's saved
[44:50] before he
[44:52] goes I'm talking about an atmosphere of
[44:55] prayer like like you can get a
[44:58] confirmation in prayer that's what we
[45:00] want amen this is you know the
[45:02] scriptures in the Bible and the message
[45:04] is for admonition this is something that
[45:07] we can say if God did it for her God can
[45:09] do it for me you put yourself in the
[45:12] story
[45:20] amen and she was talking like
[45:23] that and the tears running on both
[45:26] cheeks and she got through praying she
[45:29] reached down to her apron and wiped her
[45:31] tears she said now will you pray paron I
[45:35] said yes ma'am and I put my hands over
[45:38] on the boy and said God my plan's gone
[45:41] and I don't know why but you told me to
[45:43] walk this must be the case I pray God
[45:48] that you'll be merciful to this boy and
[45:50] somehow The Sovereign Love of this woman
[45:53] praying for her baby you brought me down
[45:56] here
[45:57] just then I heard him go
[46:00] M mama she saides honey said it's
[46:05] getting light around here
[46:08] now I'm near the shore in just a few
[46:11] minutes he was sitting up in the
[46:13] bed amen that's what the atmosphere of
[46:17] prayer that's that's the kind of
[46:20] atmosphere that we have the potential to
[46:23] create amen I want to point to the
[46:25] examples there's power in your prayer
[46:28] it's the greatest it's the atomic bomb
[46:30] as we're going through in life we don't
[46:32] want to forget prayer we don't want to
[46:35] slack up on anything but prayer
[46:40] amen you know I just wanted to speak to
[46:43] you a little bit and just kind of tell
[46:45] you how the enemy just comes and tries
[46:47] to corrupt our atmosphere you know like
[46:50] we want the love of God to be shed
[46:52] abroad in our heart and that we can be
[46:55] free when when trouble come when times
[46:58] of distress when sickness Financial
[47:01] duress political duress all of those
[47:03] things we want to have an anchor that
[47:05] holds us amen that God said so and I he
[47:08] told me in prayer just like this woman
[47:11] God you told me your where's your
[47:14] Elijah that's what I want to know is
[47:17] where's your Elijah that's what you can
[47:19] ask not like well where has he been in
[47:22] history but where is the god of
[47:25] Elijah in your life in my life
[47:29] amen you know there was another
[47:31] atmosphere that I believe that brought
[47:33] the power of God down and this was out
[47:36] of a message in 1957 in June 23rd called
[47:40] believe from the heart but this is what
[47:44] he said he said then brother wood and
[47:46] and his brother and I we ran off to a
[47:48] place to fish again for a night a day
[47:51] and a night and this is on paragraph 130
[47:55] and that afternoon sitting back there
[47:57] brother wood began to speak about an old
[47:59] woman that used to belong to the
[48:01] Anderson Church of God up there when
[48:04] they were in their
[48:07] Bloom oh how
[48:10] good said how how she used to take them
[48:14] little Jehovah boys and love on
[48:18] them and brother wood said to his
[48:21] brother Lyle said
[48:23] ly would it not be great if if we would
[48:27] go find that old sister and let her know
[48:30] that we're
[48:32] saved I mean just just just talking
[48:34] about the Lord and fellowshipping and
[48:36] all of the sudden you know when the B
[48:38] the woods boys were little you know they
[48:40] had some A Mother's Love or just another
[48:44] Christian know you know she used to just
[48:46] love on them and treat them good and
[48:48] special and that's what we should do we
[48:50] should treat each other with love and be
[48:52] you know you're special
[48:59] but he said now that word found favor
[49:02] with God after talking about God for a
[49:05] long time but that word found favor and
[49:07] those two Jehovah Witness boys both them
[49:10] aged men wanting to find that old woman
[49:13] and tell them that they were saved two
[49:14] brothers when they said that the spirit
[49:17] of God and his sovereignty fell on me
[49:20] sitting there in the boat oh I wish I
[49:22] could had the voice some way that I
[49:24] could sink it into the people's heart I
[49:26] could not no more control myself than I
[49:30] could fly to the moon and just by that
[49:32] word I said boys there's something
[49:35] fixing to happen it's a little animal of
[49:38] some sort it'll be brought to life
[49:41] there's going to be life connected with
[49:44] it and you'll see right away and I
[49:46] thought now what have I said I I begin
[49:49] to think of something what made me say
[49:52] that no vision it was just something
[49:54] spoke what was it it wasn't my
[49:57] intellectuals I couldn't even think of
[49:59] such a thing I
[50:01] was down below that it was in the heart
[50:07] that God came into he was going he was
[50:10] doing the speaking I didn't even wasn't
[50:13] even thinking of such a thing it spoke I
[50:16] think there is where Jesus said if thou
[50:18] believest in thy heart shall say to this
[50:21] tree or to this mountain then don't
[50:23] doubt but believe what you have said
[50:26] will come to pass you will have what you
[50:28] say there's my point get to the spot
[50:32] where it's something is not yourself
[50:35] it's something beyond your reasoning
[50:38] that speaks it out amen just think about
[50:41] your words and how you create because
[50:43] that word just wanting to go you know
[50:46] you think about us we're so mindful and
[50:49] you know we we make preparations and
[50:51] different things like that but this was
[50:52] not selfish this was going insane you
[50:55] know what what what you did we want to
[50:57] honor the effort and the love that you
[51:00] bestowed upon us amen that word them
[51:03] wanting to go back and say it was your
[51:05] labor wasn't in
[51:08] vain but that word found favor that the
[51:12] Resurrection Life came and resurrected
[51:14] that little fishy he said little fishy I
[51:16] give your life back amen that's you
[51:20] know oh we could
[51:23] just we could just say so much but
[51:27] praise the Lord you know if if you want
[51:30] deity in your midst welcome and receive

[53:17] you brother Joseph I think it was
[53:20] Brother Joseph Bose but anyway he was
[53:22] saying this in I think it paragraph
[53:24] eight but I'm not sure brother Joseph
[53:26] was talking about my home my wife if
[53:30] there's any credit to be given to any
[53:33] brandom give it to my wife amen that's
[53:35] right she's the deserving one 36 years
[53:40] old completely Whitehead a girl she
[53:43] never knows what it is to lay down she
[53:47] had a hard time in our country that's my
[53:51] hometown pardon me brother brandom CS he
[53:53] says that's where I was raised raised at
[53:56] or born raised at she tried this week
[54:02] with any price that she could give
[54:04] anyone who can come and watch
[54:07] Joseph while she would come up here and
[54:09] spend those last couple of nights with
[54:12] us I offered women as much as $35 $40 a
[54:18] week and let
[54:20] the a week of expenses if they would
[54:24] come and do nothing but take care of the
[54:27] children and we find no
[54:30] one M can you imagine this I mean Allie
[54:35] wants to do is just have or you know get
[54:37] me to come and spend the last few days
[54:40] and there was no one there to
[54:44] help but she's there burying
[54:46] it
[54:49] my you know and I I think that if you
[54:52] were in a situation like that it might
[54:55] Ponder your heart or mind to say well
[54:58] did I do something wrong is there is
[55:01] there something like huh uh you know why
[55:05] isn't there anybody helping you know
[55:09] surely and brother brandom he makes this
[55:12] statement he said so it's seemingly that
[55:14] the holy spirit is moving me away from
[55:17] Jeffersonville I'm watching for a place
[55:20] where he wants me to
[55:22] go Chicago will be all right with me if
[55:25] he moves me this way and whatever I go
[55:28] wherever I would go so I'm just in
[55:31] prayer you pray for me that I make the
[55:34] right
[55:35] decision but I can't hardly stay any
[55:39] longer it looks like other things
[55:42] too there's
[55:45] nothing no one's against me that I know
[55:48] of there's nothing no one's got against
[55:51] me that I know
[55:53] of you know it would be it would be
[55:55] wonderful if you would know if something
[55:58] if someone's got something against you
[56:01] then you can go to that brother like
[56:03] brother brandom's saying here if it was
[56:05] so I would be at his doorstep the next
[56:09] morning finding out about
[56:11] it but you know you find out that
[56:13] brother brandom he's saying it was the
[56:15] Holy Spirit that he was getting ready to
[56:17] move it wasn't the people so much is
[56:20] that God was getting ready to relocate
[56:24] him my
[56:27] you know but I I thought this was an
[56:29] important thing because brother brandom
[56:31] is invoking you pray for me and I'll
[56:33] pray for you you know we want to
[56:34] maintain this atmosphere and not jump
[56:37] you know just to conclusions on certain
[56:39] things but you know God he knows what
[56:41] he's doing with us and he's in control
[56:45] amen says this in 34 what if he held my
[56:48] sin against me what what an awful person
[56:52] I was but he loved me so much that he
[56:55] forgave me of for them when I was undone
[56:59] I for he forgave me he loved me a pure
[57:02] love and when Adam separated himself
[57:06] from the pure love of keeping God's word
[57:09] in his heart my think about that you
[57:13] know he separated
[57:16] himself and when he did that then he
[57:20] began those other faculties came in
[57:23] Malice Envy Strife hatred and so forth
[57:27] then when God seen that his children had
[57:31] separated he come down for
[57:34] Fellowship there was no one there to
[57:37] welcome
[57:39] him you know when he comes we want to
[57:42] make him welcome
[57:44] amen 35 he says look when Israel was
[57:47] divided up in the lands there was I
[57:50] believe in Gad was one of them or
[57:53] perhaps half a tribe they didn't go up
[57:56] to the promised land they
[57:59] stayed on this side the
[58:02] borderline Jesus visited that same
[58:05] people and look at the results of
[58:08] staying out of the full
[58:11] benefits of God's
[58:14] love when Jesus visited them when he
[58:18] went into
[58:20] gadera there was there they that's where
[58:25] they dwelt that's where they made that's
[58:28] where they came from right there and
[58:30] their attitude was still the same way
[58:32] because they it cost them a bunch of
[58:35] hogs to have a meeting they asked Jesus
[58:38] to leave the land can you imagine how
[58:41] carnal like some people they just they
[58:43] look at natural things as a value but
[58:46] I'm telling you you can't put a value on
[58:49] Revelation in the
[58:51] natural you know it's Revelation that
[58:53] brings your healing it's Revel that
[58:56] brings you life
[58:59] amen but they they had this attitude
[59:03] that was oh you know what hey the last
[59:06] time he was here it cost us a bunch of
[59:09] you know so they just started driving
[59:11] him out that was the Pharisees
[59:14] atmosphere you know we don't want to
[59:15] have those kind of attitudes and
[59:18] atmospheres influencing us but we want
[59:20] to know that they're there so we can
[59:21] guard against them amen
[59:26] but ah they didn't want nothing to do
[59:29] with it their they wanted their own ways
[59:32] and their own churches but they didn't
[59:34] want nothing to do with Jesus so they
[59:36] asked him to leave the land but he went
[59:39] on anyhow because there was one Soul
[59:41] calling for him just think cross that
[59:44] stormy Lake over across and find one
[59:49] soul in need and that was his love for
[59:52] that one needy Soul Hallelujah
[59:57] thank God that he's faithful even to One
[59:59] Soul that's what this service could be
[1:00:02] you might say ah you know what the God
[1:00:04] can come for one needy Soul tonight you
[1:00:07] just let that be you I'll let it be me
[1:00:10] amen he will leave Glory tonight he came
[1:00:13] from Glory tonight to this Auditorium
[1:00:16] for one needy soul that will believe him
[1:00:19] and so then when sin came in and
[1:00:21] separated man from fellowship notice
[1:00:24] what God did to bring man back act to
[1:00:26] Fellowship he introduced the world a
[1:00:29] blood
[1:00:31] Redemption God killed an animal and put
[1:00:34] those skins showing a blood
[1:00:37] Redemption and their God after being
[1:00:41] separated from his creatures God laid
[1:00:44] out the welcome mat back home by the
[1:00:47] shed shedding of the blood and then and
[1:00:52] that was then and has been been and
[1:00:56] always will
[1:00:58] be God's provided preparation for
[1:01:01] fellowship with him is through the shed
[1:01:04] blood I love the Simplicity of the
[1:01:07] Gospel you know you can look back and
[1:01:09] see you know the worshipper used to just
[1:01:11] slay the lamb but their conscience
[1:01:14] constantly was going back going back but
[1:01:16] praise God whenever the blood of Jesus
[1:01:19] comes it rids you of the desire for sin
[1:01:22] amen God has resurrected in my heart I
[1:01:24] don't even want to smoke I don't want to
[1:01:26] drink I don't want to do the things that
[1:01:28] displease him how do you know he's
[1:01:30] raised from the dead well I tell you I'm
[1:01:32] a new creature amen how many can
[1:01:36] testify
[1:01:39] Hallelujah
[1:01:42] my praise the lord
[1:01:45] well I was going to read a few more
[1:01:48] things but if U you have your device I
[1:01:51] just wanted to take a minute and listen
[1:01:53] to about 30 uh 40 minutes of a message
[1:01:56] and we might make a comment afterwards
[1:01:59] but if the brothers can um get this
[1:02:01] message I wanted to listen to he carth
[1:02:04] do you care and in this message if you
[1:02:07] listen and just focus in on it I believe
[1:02:10] that there are certain things that
[1:02:12] pollute our atmosphere that God wants us
[1:02:15] to make us aware you know overcoming is
[1:02:18] recognizing the devil and every one of
[1:02:20] his tricks and I think it's very
[1:02:21] important to recognize how he's trying
[1:02:24] to affect us as individuals and as a
[1:02:27] congregation you know the world tries to
[1:02:30] creep into the church but listen how the
[1:02:32] prophet of God comes to deal with our
[1:02:36] hearts in the conditions that we're in
[1:02:37] today so if the brothers will uh play
[1:02:41] from paragraph
[1:02:48] 51 is become such a thing until it's
[1:02:52] absolutely struck the nation and whole
[1:02:55] not only in Nation but the world and
[1:02:57] home many things I can say here but to
[1:03:00] save time the healing service coming up
[1:03:03] I I could speak at large on this but I
[1:03:06] won't I'm sure you'll understand what I
[1:03:10] mean this uh uh it struck the political
[1:03:14] world the political life the social life
[1:03:17] the moral life of the nation other
[1:03:20] peoples around the world it's got to a
[1:03:23] place the man wants to be a politician
[1:03:26] just to have the name of being a
[1:03:28] politician got plenty of money and can
[1:03:30] pull votes and hire machines to do it
[1:03:33] and and so forth Just for the name and
[1:03:35] worth millions and millions of dollars
[1:03:38] see just for the name of being some
[1:03:41] great
[1:03:42] politician enough has said it that you
[1:03:44] know what I'm talking about in social
[1:03:47] life that people try to get together in
[1:03:50] this insane social life don't tell me
[1:03:53] the world's not insane doing the way
[1:03:55] doing it sure is it's an erotic world
[1:04:00] and by the grace of God was only way
[1:04:04] we'll Escape it notice in this social
[1:04:08] life the people has come to a place that
[1:04:12] they they socialize little Clans and
[1:04:15] they get into there and think we're
[1:04:17] better than the next group see and it's
[1:04:20] just gun that way and it's the morals
[1:04:23] it's hit the morals of people until
[1:04:24] honest friends I don't even believe that
[1:04:26] the world the word moral is recognized
[1:04:30] among 90% of the people of this nation
[1:04:33] they don't even know what the world word
[1:04:35] moral means it's it's escaped from him
[1:04:39] and it's done it's so trickery Satan is
[1:04:41] very subtle see and he does it so easy
[1:04:45] so so subtle just a little teeny bit ear
[1:04:49] and a little there let he's got plenty
[1:04:51] of time so he just runs a little bit in
[1:04:53] here and a little bit in here and the
[1:04:55] first thing you know people just
[1:04:56] gradually move into it what would have
[1:04:59] happened of a woman uh back when I was a
[1:05:02] boy of 16 years old and she walked down
[1:05:05] the street like she does today in this
[1:05:08] strip teas Farm while they'd have had
[1:05:10] her in
[1:05:13] jail well if it was wrong then it's
[1:05:15] wrong now see but you see Satan just
[1:05:19] begin to cut off the skirts and to lower
[1:05:22] them down and and it'll come to pass
[1:05:25] that there somebody will Design One a
[1:05:27] little beyond the mackini or what you
[1:05:30] call the thing to a fig Leaf you
[1:05:32] remember that's right it'll go right
[1:05:34] straight back and it's it's there
[1:05:36] practically now and now we find all
[1:05:40] those things is because people are
[1:05:43] trying to find Comfort they're trying to
[1:05:47] find something that they and remember
[1:05:50] your comfort is your
[1:05:52] religion and you make those things your
[1:05:56] religion
[1:05:59] see what a Pity in realizing that death
[1:06:02] lays right before you
[1:06:04] think until all this has happened until
[1:06:07] it seems like that there's not a a solid
[1:06:11] foundation left in the nation to build
[1:06:13] anything on just let me ask you
[1:06:17] something you can't believe nothing
[1:06:20] hardly but the Bible we still have
[1:06:23] Christ thanks to God
[1:06:26] you you can't believe anything you get
[1:06:28] on for instance when you turn your
[1:06:30] television on you that have such and
[1:06:33] when you turn your television on and see
[1:06:36] the the
[1:06:37] commercials well if a person tried to
[1:06:40] live by one hund of those commercials
[1:06:43] you die in a week see you couldn't do it
[1:06:46] and the very thing that some company
[1:06:49] will break down like a product and say
[1:06:53] this is the thing here and don't have
[1:06:55] have this one over here and the same
[1:06:58] company sells the same product then
[1:07:00] another commercial come on take this on
[1:07:02] this side and not that in the same
[1:07:04] company the American people fall for
[1:07:07] such stuff as that till the whole thing
[1:07:10] is become a rot until there's no hopes
[1:07:16] at all nobody knows what to believe but
[1:07:20] I'm going to tell you after a while what
[1:07:21] you believe if you want Comfort he if
[1:07:25] the Lord willing the people they lie
[1:07:29] cheat steal tell you almost have to have
[1:07:33] a bond of security to borrow $5 from
[1:07:37] somebody it's uh you know the Bible
[1:07:40] speaks that that there be no love in the
[1:07:42] last days but just among the elect
[1:07:44] people that's right the scripture speaks
[1:07:48] of that that uh husband to be against
[1:07:51] wife and wife against husband children
[1:07:53] against parents just among the elected
[1:07:56] of the Lord will there be any love
[1:07:59] left the churches has got into the same
[1:08:03] thing out of social life they brought it
[1:08:05] into the church their social life and
[1:08:08] their
[1:08:09] politics and their other things until
[1:08:12] they've got the church so confused that
[1:08:15] it doesn't know what to do they brought
[1:08:18] politics into the
[1:08:20] church they brought also social life
[1:08:23] their social life in the church social
[1:08:27] activities uh bingo or Bunko what they
[1:08:30] call it and uh these suppers and dances
[1:08:34] and so forth in the house of the Lord
[1:08:38] amen why it's it's a pity they say well
[1:08:41] now that isn't that's on the annex
[1:08:44] remember it was the annex also that
[1:08:46] Jesus beat the the merchants out with
[1:08:50] their merchandise and said it's written
[1:08:52] My Father's House made a house of prayer
[1:08:54] and you made it at d the thieves see
[1:08:57] it's wrong I don't care where it's at as
[1:09:00] long as the church the church is not so
[1:09:02] much the building it's a people in the
[1:09:04] building and if those people are
[1:09:07] anticipating in this why it's wrong and
[1:09:11] they brought that practice now we find
[1:09:14] out that the churches too are always
[1:09:16] promising something like television and
[1:09:19] so forth that they never get to the the
[1:09:21] thing they
[1:09:23] promise is I all said an old quotation
[1:09:27] man is always praising God for what he
[1:09:29] did praising God for what he will do
[1:09:31] looking forward to what he will do and
[1:09:33] that ignore what he's doing see they
[1:09:35] they they fail and that's the way they
[1:09:37] become history after a while of the
[1:09:39] polluted see because they fail to
[1:09:42] recognize now you can talk of the
[1:09:44] Comfort Christ give once and say that a
[1:09:46] comfort he will give in the ages to come
[1:09:48] but refuse the comfort that he's got
[1:09:50] here now far you see it's on the same
[1:09:53] basis we find that
[1:09:56] which become a great thing I find out
[1:09:59] that there they come that's even
[1:10:02] becoming
[1:10:04] Pentecost in the
[1:10:06] churches it's become into the
[1:10:08] Pentecostal reals that there always a
[1:10:11] promising something that they never get
[1:10:14] to it it's always that every fell has a
[1:10:18] different sensation and and make it
[1:10:20] whether scriptural or not they're
[1:10:21] promising something that they never do
[1:10:24] get to it until it seems like it's got
[1:10:27] to a place to where there doesn't seem
[1:10:29] to be any
[1:10:33] sincerity the the people don't get down
[1:10:35] to that real kernel of
[1:10:39] sincerity it's lost the the very English
[1:10:42] word of sincerity has lost its its
[1:10:47] value to the people or by the people's
[1:10:51] way of of living it's lost its sin
[1:10:55] sincity to
[1:10:56] them now they don't seem to understand
[1:11:01] even to our
[1:11:04] confessions now I want you people that
[1:11:07] are coming or here and hold or on the
[1:11:12] the
[1:11:13] tape I want you to listen close now for
[1:11:16] a moment to this
[1:11:19] quotation it if you if unless you are
[1:11:22] deeply sincere and you cannot be sincere
[1:11:25] until your
[1:11:28] positive
[1:11:30] understand if you're presuming or
[1:11:33] guessing or hoping so then there cannot
[1:11:37] be a depth of sincerity that God
[1:11:41] requires it faith is not a hope s or it
[1:11:45] could be right it's got to be
[1:11:48] absolutely
[1:11:50] amen it's your
[1:11:53] ultimate it it it's your it's you're
[1:11:56] absolute it's a thing that you're tied
[1:11:59] to see you have come to your altimate
[1:12:04] that it is the truth and there's it's
[1:12:06] nothing but the truth and it must be
[1:12:11] thus and then when you realize that in
[1:12:13] your
[1:12:14] mind then you've got to approach it with
[1:12:18] your whole life soul
[1:12:21] body all that's in you just completely
[1:12:25] sell out everything to it as Jesus so uh
[1:12:30] graciously taught us in the man buying
[1:12:33] pearls and he found the one of great
[1:12:35] price and he sold all his others to get
[1:12:37] to it all the truths and everything that
[1:12:40] he had though they were good pearls he
[1:12:42] this one meant all to him and when you
[1:12:45] find God's ultimate his word a promise
[1:12:50] Upon A Certain thing you must know first
[1:12:52] that it is God's word that the thing
[1:12:56] that you're seeing being done is God
[1:13:00] there there's no there's no maybe so it
[1:13:02] could be it looks like it might be it is
[1:13:07] God now when you get to that spot then
[1:13:10] it's the pearl of great price you must
[1:13:13] get away from anything that anybody else
[1:13:16] tells you contrary to it you must not
[1:13:18] look to what man has achieved you must
[1:13:21] look to what God has said and what he
[1:13:24] prom promised and see him to do it then
[1:13:27] that's your ultimate right there then
[1:13:29] everything that you are everything that
[1:13:32] you was everything that you hope to be
[1:13:34] must be placed upon this just as though
[1:13:37] it was death and life to you at that
[1:13:42] moment I think one of the thing that
[1:13:44] keeps our people from being healed is
[1:13:46] the lack of
[1:13:48] confession is the LA of sincere
[1:13:53] confession now for instance this might
[1:13:55] sound a little bad but I don't mean it
[1:13:58] in this way but looking at my wife
[1:14:01] sitting here if I would go out here
[1:14:05] today and throw my arms around some
[1:14:07] other woman and and make love to
[1:14:10] her and I'd uh know then after I did
[1:14:14] that that I was wrong so wrong of course
[1:14:18] my comforter would keep me from doing
[1:14:19] that see see but I mean if I if I did
[1:14:23] that and I it had that I did it or
[1:14:26] anything similar to it and then I know
[1:14:29] the first thing is to say to my wife
[1:14:32] before I can say to God forgive me
[1:14:34] because I sinned against
[1:14:35] her if you come to the Altar and
[1:14:38] remember you have ought go make that
[1:14:39] right first before you offer your gift
[1:14:42] so I've got to go to her I believe in
[1:14:45] confession is straightening up
[1:14:48] also it isn't True Confession unless it
[1:14:51] is amen what if I said now I'm going to
[1:14:54] confess it that I done wrong I say good

[1:15:06] forgive me you know old friend I I
[1:15:08] didn't mean it that way see I you say
[1:15:11] that's
[1:15:12] sacrilegious it is to make a confession
[1:15:15] like that it is but what if I go say uh
[1:15:19] uh Lord uh I didn't mean to do it just
[1:15:22] that way and you help me now I won't do
[1:15:24] it again he'll refuse My Sacrifice until
[1:15:28] I first go and make that right with my
[1:15:30] wife then what if I come to her with the
[1:15:32] same irreverence and say say old girl
[1:15:35] old friend of mine oh mother of my
[1:15:37] children old sweetheart you know we've
[1:15:39] been old Chums for a long time say what
[1:15:41] if I put my arms around another woman
[1:15:43] what do you say about old kid would you
[1:15:44] forgive
[1:15:47] me I imagine how she'
[1:15:50] look she' think what's happened to my
[1:15:53] husband now
[1:15:55] the first thing she wouldn't know
[1:15:57] whether I was kidding or whether I
[1:15:59] wasn't and you don't go that way to make
[1:16:02] a confession to your fellow man are
[1:16:06] God you go with the dips of sincerity
[1:16:10] with Godly sorrow of your
[1:16:13] Sinise Lord first you must be sorry I
[1:16:17] must tell her sweetheart come here it
[1:16:19] may mean the rest of our married life
[1:16:22] the woman that I live with it's my
[1:16:24] sweetheart
[1:16:25] and how I've loved you all these years
[1:16:27] but now you may leave me from this on
[1:16:30] you may not stay with me you may not
[1:16:32] accept me and I'm knowing that but yet
[1:16:35] to make it right I got to get right I
[1:16:38] got to tell her with the depths of my
[1:16:40] heart then I've got to tell God the same
[1:16:42] way and tell both her and God with the
[1:16:46] sincerity that I'll never do it again by
[1:16:48] the grace of
[1:16:49] God don't just really now I might be
[1:16:52] able to put it over her and she see well
[1:16:55] see maybe my speech to her would would
[1:16:58] convince her but my speech won't
[1:17:00] convince God he looks in my heart and he
[1:17:03] knows and after all just a few more
[1:17:06] years with her if God permits and we'll
[1:17:08] be taken out of this world but with God
[1:17:10] it's eternity so I must be deeply
[1:17:14] sincere with God and then if I am
[1:17:17] sincere he'll hear me but if I'm not
[1:17:20] sincere there's no need of me wasting
[1:17:23] God's time listening to me
[1:17:26] that's where it's come to today amongst
[1:17:27] people there doesn't seem to be that
[1:17:30] depths of sincerity that that they ought
[1:17:33] to have and I believe that a man or
[1:17:36] woman coming to be prayed for should
[1:17:39] first confess everything that they have
[1:17:43] did and make everything right because
[1:17:46] you see you notice lots of times on the
[1:17:48] platform you notice watch how far away
[1:17:51] that thus sayith the Lord is see see the
[1:17:55] people the vision will materialize of
[1:17:57] course with their faith God promised
[1:17:59] that by a gift but the healing is
[1:18:01] something different see God recognizes
[1:18:05] it then
[1:18:06] see now we notice that as the people
[1:18:10] making their confession has got to come
[1:18:13] with deepness of sincerity I have here I
[1:18:15] ain't got time to read it but is it
[1:18:17] beaming toon New
[1:18:19] York uh I believe or I got that wrong is
[1:18:23] Beamon I believe it's right the place
[1:18:25] where the anot shoe company is there uh
[1:18:29] Binghamton I believe it's called Bing
[1:18:31] bingamon that's right uh New York we was
[1:18:34] there in the anacott Johnson uh shoe
[1:18:38] place the big Auditorium and was having
[1:18:40] a meeting there and one morning Billy
[1:18:44] Paul was next door to me real cold winds
[1:18:47] blowing and I found among the people a
[1:18:52] lack of sincerity seemed like
[1:18:55] and I I wondered why here was one man
[1:19:00] that was heal purpose or one man in in
[1:19:03] particular I'm speaking of the man had a
[1:19:06] great Affliction and he was healed this
[1:19:09] night standing there and before we left
[1:19:12] 5 days the Affliction was back to him
[1:19:14] again see because in the presence of the
[1:19:17] Holy Spirit he took that off of him just
[1:19:21] like it did this young woman a while ago
[1:19:23] out here in the yard the young man last
[1:19:26] night see but there must be a deep
[1:19:30] sincerity to know that the god that can
[1:19:33] take it away from you now with that same
[1:19:35] anointing only he can keep it away from
[1:19:37] you
[1:19:38] see Hallelujah and then the Holy Spirit
[1:19:40] spoke to me one morning about daylight
[1:19:42] and said get up on the platform or
[1:19:45] somewhere and bring these people up
[1:19:47] there and make them confess everything
[1:19:50] that they've did before you pray for
[1:19:52] them the deepness of sincerity unless
[1:19:56] the world repents it's got to
[1:19:59] perish and
[1:20:01] confession is what the world needs today
[1:20:04] is honest confession it's like medicine
[1:20:07] for a disease we all can read on the
[1:20:11] bottle what kind of a medicine it is and
[1:20:13] what disease it is to
[1:20:16] cure but uh you
[1:20:19] know the reading the directions I'm
[1:20:23] going to apply that back to the Bible
[1:20:26] our schools and seminaries can read all
[1:20:28] the word but you know just reading the
[1:20:32] directions and how to take it it it
[1:20:35] doesn't cure the disease see it it's got
[1:20:39] the medicine so has got to be taken so a
[1:20:43] man can say I am a a
[1:20:46] theologian now don't speak to me I I I
[1:20:50] about such and such I know the
[1:20:52] scriptures I I know that the Bible
[1:20:56] speaks thus and th that he that heareth
[1:21:00] my word St John 524 for instance he that
[1:21:04] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:21:07] that sent me has eternal life or King
[1:21:10] James puts it Everlasting which is
[1:21:13] eternal
[1:21:15] rightly has eternal life because he's
[1:21:17] believed many people say they
[1:21:21] believe now that is true the the the
[1:21:24] scripture is
[1:21:26] correct I I'm reading the the the
[1:21:31] prescription or I'm reading what the
[1:21:33] prescription is I'm the antidote for my
[1:21:37] sin but can I take
[1:21:40] it can I
[1:21:43] believe I might say I believe but do I
[1:21:47] believe that's the next
[1:21:50] thing just read it and know the
[1:21:54] direction doesn't cure the disease the
[1:21:57] trouble is that the in our case we won't
[1:22:01] take what the remedy says do we got the
[1:22:06] remedy but we won't take it Hallelujah
[1:22:10] we say we do because we can read it but
[1:22:13] to really take it we don't do it see the
[1:22:18] gospel is the same way of medicine in
[1:22:20] this
[1:22:21] case if the patient and the remedy has
[1:22:25] been proven
[1:22:28] to cure the
[1:22:30] patient and the uh patient reads all
[1:22:35] about the the uh discovery of this
[1:22:39] drug and they know every ounce of
[1:22:42] medicine that's in it they know all the
[1:22:45] the scientist name that found this
[1:22:48] certain drug like the salt vaccine and
[1:22:51] so forth if we if we know all the world
[1:22:54] about it but refuse to take it it won't
[1:22:58] help us see it it won't help us but and
[1:23:03] then how we say but we've tuck
[1:23:06] it and if you say you tuck it and the
[1:23:09] patience shows no
[1:23:11] results he didn't take
[1:23:15] it that's
[1:23:18] all how if that clock on the wall wasn't
[1:23:22] such a busy body see
[1:23:25] I'd like to say here and bring down real
[1:23:27] strong for our our people since the
[1:23:31] gospel has been proved these
[1:23:33] things and they claim they take
[1:23:37] it and they show that they don't take
[1:23:42] it how can a person read the scriptures
[1:23:45] upon the little thing that talk about
[1:23:47] about women with the bob hair and
[1:23:48] wearing shorts and so forth like that
[1:23:51] how can they call themselves Christians
[1:23:53] when the very medicine itself says that
[1:23:56] it's different hallu see how you said
[1:23:59] but I danced in the spirit I spoke in
[1:24:01] tongues that don't mean one thing your
[1:24:04] own life proves that you didn't take it
[1:24:08] Hallelujah Glory you said you you took
[1:24:12] it but you
[1:24:14] didn't for you still are showing all the
[1:24:18] symptoms that the medicine is supposed
[1:24:20] to cure that's right and the medicine in
[1:24:22] the gospel line is a guaranteed
[1:24:28] cure it's got to
[1:24:31] be
[1:24:33] now you see you got to show
[1:24:37] results you take a person says that
[1:24:39] there I am a a
[1:24:42] Believer I believe Let The Gospel Light
[1:24:46] Strike them brother they take it right
[1:24:48] now and they'll show
[1:24:50] results certainly you'll not see that
[1:24:53] man in any more pool room
[1:24:55] you not see him out he with a cigarette
[1:24:57] in his hand you won't see him drinking
[1:24:59] oh no you won't see him flirting with
[1:25:01] other women no no no I don't care how
[1:25:05] much they throw their female flesh
[1:25:07] before him he'll turn his head towards
[1:25:08] the skies and look towards Christ what
[1:25:11] is it shows that the remedy took
[1:25:14] effect and if it don't take effect you
[1:25:16] say well I know I took it well then
[1:25:19] where are you at today then you're dying
[1:25:23] you show I'm looking at you as
[1:25:28] diagnosing your case by the by the Bible
[1:25:32] that you're still in
[1:25:34] sin and the wages of sin is
[1:25:41] death don't think it has to be made any
[1:25:43] pler see your own actions
[1:25:47] prove your own actions prove that you
[1:25:51] didn't take it you thought you did
[1:25:53] that's right
[1:25:56] heyen you you might have been all
[1:25:59] sincere in doing it but you didn't do it
[1:26:03] for if you did God promised it would
[1:26:06] take effect on
[1:26:10] you and the old sin is still there the
[1:26:14] old Adam nature still lingers there the
[1:26:16] old unbelief yet you try to make
[1:26:19] yourself before your fellow man say well
[1:26:21] I'm a Believer Oh Glory to God yes I'm a
[1:26:23] Believer but you see it didn't help you
[1:26:27] any maybe the patient itself wasn't even
[1:26:31] predestinated to the medicine if it
[1:26:34] didn't it'll never take effect hlj seeu
[1:26:38] but look at that little imar woman when
[1:26:40] the light struck her there was something
[1:26:42] laying there to take care of her
[1:26:46] condition if we believe and sincerely
[1:26:49] confess this remedy of God's
[1:26:53] way or takes effect God has a provided
[1:26:57] way for these things now see man will go
[1:27:00] say well I join the church that settles
[1:27:03] it with me that isn't God's provided way
[1:27:06] God's provided way is repentance
[1:27:10] confession and showing a
[1:27:13] results bringing forth fruit meat par
[1:27:16] repentance showing
[1:27:20] sincerity if you people that just do
[1:27:22] that this morning is going to be prayed
[1:27:23] for are and you people will hear this
[1:27:26] tape all over the world and after this
[1:27:28] tape is played and the minister of the
[1:27:30] person is playing it in congregation
[1:27:33] groups out in the jungles wherever you
[1:27:34] are that's playing it well first make
[1:27:37] your confession
[1:27:39] clear and then come with nothing in your
[1:27:43] heart at all but faith and be prayed for
[1:27:45] it there's the medicine will take
[1:27:48] place Jesus said repent every one of you
[1:27:52] I mean Peter did on the day of Pentecost
[1:27:54] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:27:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:27:58] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:27:59] Holy Ghost when you thoroughly
[1:28:02] repent and believe on the Lord and are
[1:28:06] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:28:08] make God a liar if you don't receive the
[1:28:10] Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost if Jesus said this the last
[1:28:15] commission to his church these signs
[1:28:17] shall follow them and believe if they
[1:28:20] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[1:28:22] recover and you see those signs
[1:28:24] fallowing a Believer and you come up and
[1:28:26] that believer lays hands on you and
[1:28:28] something doesn't take
[1:28:29] place then there's something wrong with
[1:28:31] your belief
[1:28:33] see the believer God promised a provided
[1:28:38] way we try to find Comfort but saying I
[1:28:40] don't have to listen no that's true you
[1:28:42] don't have to listen to it but if you
[1:28:44] are predestinated to eternal life you
[1:28:46] will listen to it and you'll Rejoice to
[1:28:49] it it's your comfort it's a thing you've
[1:28:51] longed for all your life it's it's Pearl
[1:28:54] that you're you're ready to forsake
[1:28:56] everything hallah you want
[1:29:00] it because you know it's God's loving
[1:29:03] care for you it's something to settle
[1:29:05] the sin question to settle the unbelief
[1:29:08] to settle everything to you if you want
[1:29:11] it it's he that's really sick and knows
[1:29:13] he's sick this hunts a
[1:29:15] physician not he that's not sick doesn't
[1:29:17] need one Jesus said but it's those who
[1:29:20] are sick if you can realize your
[1:29:22] condition then you've got to do he said
[1:29:24] do then it's got to take place or God
[1:29:27] told something was wrong see so many
[1:29:29] people sometime healing Services you
[1:29:32] don't start from the bottom of it you've
[1:29:34] got to get our life cleaned up You' got
[1:29:36] to be in condition you've got to really
[1:29:38] say yes I believe it and that's got to
[1:29:40] be from your heart then you nobody have
[1:29:43] to Baby around say now oh brother dear
[1:29:46] sister dear you ought to do this you
[1:29:47] ought to do that you're a Believer
[1:29:48] there's nothing can take it away from
[1:29:50] you I don't care what anybody else would
[1:29:53] say what any consolis what any uh
[1:29:56] comforter what any doctor what any
[1:29:58] Hospital what any diagnosis and say you
[1:30:01] still don't believe it you just know it
[1:30:03] there's no need to say anything else
[1:30:05] about it you know it now that's the
[1:30:06] genuine thing we have so much
[1:30:09] impersonation in all things it has to be
[1:30:12] that way don't feel bad about it it's
[1:30:14] got to be there it's always has been and
[1:30:17] it will be but I'm telling you this
[1:30:19] morning what's truth and
[1:30:21] facts we're at the end time we got the
[1:30:24] lay this thing down at the
[1:30:25] truth and let it know what's the
[1:30:28] truth
[1:30:30] now um we find out that people won't
[1:30:34] take God's way about it they won't they
[1:30:37] God has a way provided for your comfort
[1:30:39] God has a way provided for all these
[1:30:41] things but people don't want it people
[1:30:43] go after other ways and every time they
[1:30:46] do it some other way besides God's way
[1:30:49] they bring the wrath of God up on them
[1:30:53] every time they do it all
[1:30:56] right and all these things that I have
[1:30:59] spoken of it brings us to this the world
[1:31:04] all of these going after other
[1:31:07] scientific achievements going after
[1:31:09] church achievements going after
[1:31:11] different things has brought us to the
[1:31:15] end of the
[1:31:17] world we're at the
[1:31:20] end there's not one hope left
[1:31:25] we are without a hope of survival we
[1:31:29] haven't even got one
[1:31:32] chance of
[1:31:34] survival now just let me break this down
[1:31:37] just for a few minutes and just prove it
[1:31:39] to you and each one of you you get if
[1:31:42] you don't you ought to get a medical
[1:31:43] journal you ought to take the reader
[1:31:45] digest and so forth where you read these
[1:31:49] achievements now to make a minister here
[1:31:53] is sing this message around the world to
[1:31:56] make a statement like that it we're
[1:31:58] without
[1:31:59] hope that we are Beyond
[1:32:03] Redemption that we have passed the line
[1:32:06] between uh uh Redemption and judgment
[1:32:10] now I must give the congregation some
[1:32:14] grounds to base this statement upon
[1:32:17] there must be some reason that a man if
[1:32:21] he's in his right mind as I think that I
[1:32:24] am uh would make a statement like that
[1:32:27] to tell his Nation to tell his
[1:32:30] congregation to tell the people where
[1:32:33] it'll go around the world and 30 40
[1:32:36] different nations maybe around the world
[1:32:38] and peoples and languages that we're at
[1:32:40] the end time it behooves us to give a
[1:32:44] statement or or or explain a little of
[1:32:47] it till we get down to our main text for
[1:32:50] the morning look now let us look what
[1:32:54] science and education has brought us to
[1:32:56] and that's the very thing that man
[1:32:58] accepted instead of the word of God
[1:33:01] right a scientific
[1:33:03] approval and Sciences always have to
[1:33:06] take back what they
[1:33:08] said I was reading years sometime ago
[1:33:10] where a French scientist said about 200
[1:33:13] years ago or 300 rolling a ball around
[1:33:15] the earth and said if this ball at this
[1:33:18] speed uh if the world ever invented some
[1:33:21] kind of a something that would make them
[1:33:23] the travel at least 30 miles an hour
[1:33:26] something like that around the world
[1:33:28] that he scientifically Pro it that it on
[1:33:30] its weight would be lifted by
[1:33:32] gravitation from the
[1:33:33] earth now you think will a science ever
[1:33:36] refer back to that guy certainly not
[1:33:39] that's an app pass to
[1:33:40] them now let's just think now we all
[1:33:45] want to say I want to scientifically
[1:33:47] prove it that's what a lot of
[1:33:50] denominations of religious people say
[1:33:52] they they want a scientific
[1:33:54] proof well I could turn right back
[1:33:56] around and say scientifically prove me
[1:33:58] God in your
[1:34:00] congregation prove me anything
[1:34:03] scientifically that's
[1:34:05] real prove what is real
[1:34:08] life I want you to get me a quarter's
[1:34:11] worth of it or or let me sell everything
[1:34:12] I got to get that part of life and is
[1:34:16] life
[1:34:17] real if it isn't what are we all here
[1:34:21] for life Faith love joy peace
[1:34:28] longsuffering gentleness meekness
[1:34:32] patience science can't touch it and
[1:34:35] that's the only real lasting thing that
[1:34:37] there is the whole Christian armor is
[1:34:40] looking at the Unseen but the senses
[1:34:43] don't declare those things but they're
[1:34:44] there that's the reason it takes Faith
[1:34:46] to believe it and it produces in you
[1:34:48] what faith has declared is out there it
[1:34:51] brings it to you Divine Healing and
[1:34:53] things
[1:34:55] they can't prove what heals divinely but
[1:34:58] they know there is a Divine Healing uh
[1:35:00] they can't prove what saves from sin but
[1:35:03] they know people are saved from sin so
[1:35:05] it cannot be proven scientifically but
[1:35:08] it is scientifically in God's way of
[1:35:11] looking at it now what has science
[1:35:14] brought to us now you may be shocked
[1:35:16] just for a moment science has brought to
[1:35:20] us sickness death and
[1:35:25] diseases now you're only being taught
[1:35:28] one side of the
[1:35:31] picture but there's two sides to it amen
[1:35:36] hallelujah you say science has invented
[1:35:38] this that and the other well we're going
[1:35:40] to grant you that privilege but let's
[1:35:42] look at the other side science has
[1:35:44] brought us
[1:35:46] sickness science has brought us
[1:35:49] diseases death look scien I ific high
[1:35:57] breeding has brought death to the
[1:36:00] generation of foods and
[1:36:03] things it's got the people
[1:36:06] so uh
[1:36:09] soft and so
[1:36:12] until the the man and women are made up
[1:36:15] out of a bunch of muck and there's no
[1:36:19] there's no there's no structure in it
[1:36:23] it's become a bunch of soft
[1:36:26] jellyfish amen hallelujah they can't
[1:36:31] live without an air conditioner they
[1:36:33] perish they can't play a baseball game
[1:36:35] when them gets tapped somewhere kills
[1:36:36] him in the boxing rings and what
[1:36:39] more and So Soft to man and women oh
[1:36:44] it's perverting them and they're
[1:36:46] injecting this H bre into cattle which
[1:36:50] has come back into mankind now according
[1:36:52] to science himself
[1:36:54] and is making perversions out of them
[1:36:57] because when a a cow is hybr or any food
[1:37:01] is hybrid that food makes blood cell and
[1:37:05] blood cell is your
[1:37:08] life see what it's done and then into
[1:37:11] meat they inject these your injections
[1:37:15] into the meat and now it's prove that
[1:37:18] these injections take effect upon the
[1:37:20] human race scientific
[1:37:24] they spray the fields with this DDT I
[1:37:26] seen the other day and now we got 800
[1:37:29] sick people in this community from
[1:37:31] eating
[1:37:34] eggs do you remember years ago when I
[1:37:37] first when we had the little bitty
[1:37:39] structure here and I was prophesying and
[1:37:41] said it shall come to pass in the last
[1:37:43] days don't live in a valley and don't
[1:37:45] eat
[1:37:47] eggs I've got it on my book I thought
[1:37:49] there something about that and went and
[1:37:50] looked at it don't eat eggs that was way
[1:37:52] back in 193
[1:37:54] 3 Lord EGS has got something in them now
[1:37:58] and I see where science says that a man
[1:38:01] over 50 years old should never eat an
[1:38:03] egg because it's the hardest thing on a
[1:38:05] heart that can be
[1:38:06] eaten diseases milk it used to be our
[1:38:10] most balanced diet was milk the doctors
[1:38:13] will tell you stay away from it it's
[1:38:15] making scientists and everything else
[1:38:17] it's the same human being that used to
[1:38:20] drink it and live for years and never
[1:38:21] know science but the in breeding and so
[1:38:24] forth has broke down the structure of a
[1:38:26] human being till it's nothing but a
[1:38:28] bunch of
[1:38:30] mock b a ball of sickness what done it
[1:38:35] science look it's caused the genes
[1:38:39] between the the man and the woman to
[1:38:42] weaken the physical weakness of the
[1:38:44] human
[1:38:45] being through the genes and the increase
[1:38:48] of children is around
[1:38:51] 30% Mongolian is is on the great
[1:38:54] climb and these weakness of
[1:38:58] interbreeding of the foods that we are
[1:39:00] eating for life is weakening the body
[1:39:03] which causes cancer mental troubles and
[1:39:08] all kinds of diseases is setting upon
[1:39:10] the human body because its
[1:39:14] weakness
[1:39:16] scientific destroying themselves getting
[1:39:20] away from God's plan he said let every
[1:39:22] seed bring forth of his
[1:39:26] kind Hallelujah see where we're
[1:39:29] at I could go on and on are times
[1:39:32] getting
[1:39:33] away but
[1:39:35] notice what's it's doing it science has
[1:39:39] brought death sickness and
[1:39:44] destruction and I seen the other day I
[1:39:47] talking to my good friend Dr ve sitting
[1:39:49] here there were there's an article that
[1:39:52] people getting killed a penicillin it
[1:39:54] really isn't a p penicillin it's a filth
[1:39:57] that they let get into it when they're
[1:39:59] manufacturing the
[1:40:01] penicillin it's a moneymaking greed
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:08] scheme doctors giving it sometime who
[1:40:11] don't even know the farmer of an
[1:40:13] aspirin and the father sends them away
[1:40:16] to get a a specialist and something and
[1:40:18] other and don't know even how to cure a
[1:40:21] tummy ache for a kid
[1:40:25] but what have we got greed some pull a
[1:40:28] little something they don't have harly
[1:40:30] anymore the oldfashioned country doctor
[1:40:32] they used to get down and talk to you
[1:40:34] and console you and do everything they
[1:40:36] leave God right out of the picture am
[1:40:39] because it went after their own ways in
[1:40:42] order to get God out of the picture they
[1:40:43] explain him PL
[1:40:46] away there we are that's what we've
[1:40:50] done by in breeding
[1:40:53] you see the body what makes a healthy
[1:40:57] plant a germ can hardly get to it it's
[1:41:01] these hot bed plants these hbrd plants
[1:41:03] you have to keep sprayed all time and
[1:41:06] many of you read my message on hbrd
[1:41:08] religion keep it sprayed and baby and
[1:41:11] and so
[1:41:13] forth notice but the real genuine plant
[1:41:17] don't have to be sprayed he's an
[1:41:19] original what makes disease come to the
[1:41:22] H human body is the body is I'm told by
[1:41:25] a precious doctor friend of mine that I
[1:41:28] wouldn't want to call his name right now
[1:41:29] but he's a very fine Brother reading to
[1:41:32] me recently out of a medical journal a
[1:41:35] book in his office where he keeps All
[1:41:37] These Fine books of the latest stuff on
[1:41:39] medicine it is weakness you notice
[1:41:42] anybody that's real you say your body's
[1:41:44] run down you take a coal right quick
[1:41:46] what is it it's a weakness of your body
[1:41:49] it produces a
[1:41:51] mucus out of your gland and in that the
[1:41:54] cold germ beds itself and you got a cal
[1:41:57] but if that body was strong it would
[1:41:59] throw away that cold germ it couldn't
[1:42:01] touch
[1:42:02] it so you see when God uh constructed a
[1:42:06] man in the first place he was immune
[1:42:09] from any
[1:42:10] disease see but unbelief and science
[1:42:15] science and education was the first
[1:42:18] thing to took a man away from God and
[1:42:20] it's still taken him just look what
[1:42:24] cigarettes and drinking and these strip
[1:42:27] teases and so forth has done to the
[1:42:30] decline of this
[1:42:33] generation I guess you always wonder I'm
[1:42:35] going to make a statement here I wasn't
[1:42:37] going to do it but I believe it will
[1:42:38] amen see I they Wonder sometime they
[1:42:41] always telling me brother
[1:42:43] brandom what what makes you always
[1:42:45] picking on things like that you don't
[1:42:48] hear it say you go to a man's church I
[1:42:50] can take my women folks and they can't
[1:42:52] even in Comfort where you're speaking
[1:42:54] you're always balling them out well
[1:42:58] about your short hair about wearing
[1:43:00] clothes pertains to man and all these
[1:43:02] things like that say why do you do it
[1:43:05] now I I I'm this may be my last message
[1:43:07] till next summer you know but I want to
[1:43:10] tell you amen there it is it's a spirit
[1:43:13] of discernment for this last days that
[1:43:16] knows that that's a cursed thing before
[1:43:19] God I just wonder sometime a Minister's
[1:43:21] got any discernment of the last
[1:43:25] days the very God that tells on the
[1:43:29] platform here the conditions of you what
[1:43:31] you've done and and what is going to be
[1:43:34] and and what troubles you got that same
[1:43:37] Spirit within you looks out and conern
[1:43:39] the signs of time and it can't keep from
[1:43:41] crying out it's a spirit of discern
[1:43:44] because the Holy Spirit himself says
[1:43:47] that thing is sin and whoever partakes
[1:43:49] of it perish and then how can I be
[1:43:53] justified in the sight of God and seeing
[1:43:55] my sisters and brothers in that kind of
[1:43:57] condition if I don't call out against it
[1:43:58] even though they get angry with me I
[1:44:01] still must call out against it it's
[1:44:05] discernment sometimes they different in
[1:44:06] the word and so forth It's lack of
[1:44:09] discernment come face it down by the
[1:44:11] word see see we we know that's right
[1:44:15] well it's it's a no it's a truth it's a
[1:44:17] discernment of the last days now we see
[1:44:19] about science I I don't want to go any
[1:44:21] further on that my time just get so
[1:44:24] running away now let's take a second
[1:44:26] look at education see what it's done see
[1:44:30] now we have two churches at large now we
[1:44:35] realize that it
[1:44:37] was that it was
[1:44:40] reason common reasonings that started
[1:44:43] the ball of sin rolling at the first
[1:44:46] place it was reasoning what reasoning
[1:44:49] against the word of God when God told
[1:44:53] Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof
[1:44:54] that day you die that's settled that's
[1:44:57] all of it and he fortified them against
[1:45:00] the enemy behind his word but when Eve
[1:45:04] listened to Satan's reasonings see
[1:45:08] culture understanding education
[1:45:11] advancement that's right see she stepped
[1:45:14] out behind there and listened to Satan's
[1:45:17] reasonings and did the thing that God
[1:45:19] said don't
[1:45:21] do and if one reasoning listening to One
[1:45:24] reasoning against the word caused all
[1:45:27] this chaos one reasoning against the
[1:45:30] word again won't take you back to the
[1:45:31] same place because how foolish it be of
[1:45:34] God to bring man back upon the same
[1:45:36] basis you send him out from see see
[1:45:39] you've got to come to the shed blood of
[1:45:41] Christ your denomination won't work and
[1:45:43] your reasonings won't work it's the
[1:45:45] blood and birth and it produces in you a
[1:45:48] new creature Christ and after the
[1:45:51] fashion of Christ you live because the
[1:45:54] toxine that you take shows it kills the
[1:45:57] sin of unbelief against anything but the
[1:45:59] word of God Amen education give us that
[1:46:03] we got two churches at hand this morning
[1:46:06] one of them is the Church of Pentecost
[1:46:08] that was organized at Pentecost by the
[1:46:10] Holy Spirit the second is the Church of
[1:46:14] the Roman Catholic which is organized in
[1:46:16] N of
[1:46:18] Rome one of them is a spiritual uh birth
[1:46:23] the other is the intellectual
[1:46:27] membership from that church come all
[1:46:30] Protestants all denominations come
[1:46:32] that's the first denomination all
[1:46:35] denominations come from that one and are
[1:46:38] relation to that one Revelation 17 says
[1:46:41] so she was a and she was a mother
[1:46:44] of harlots right so there's no pot can't
[1:46:47] call K greasy see because it's it's
[1:46:51] right amen it's just one it's organized
[1:46:54] it's gone it's in Rome I don't care what
[1:46:56] it is it's gone the Bible we've just
[1:46:59] come through those Church ages to prove
[1:47:01] that one is based on spiritual
[1:47:05] discernment the other is based on
[1:47:08] education and intellectual
[1:47:12] conception now that puts us right back
[1:47:15] in the Garden of Eden
[1:47:16] again right back the same place the
[1:47:19] woman church was the one who listened
[1:47:23] not
[1:47:24] Adam the
[1:47:26] woman now want to be mother Church go on
[1:47:29] it's exactly right there's nothing out
[1:47:31] of time they make their own confession
[1:47:33] see see right back to the same thing to
[1:47:38] disbelieving the word of God at n Rome
[1:47:41] when the question come up about water
[1:47:43] baptism about other things like that
[1:47:45] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:47:48] the Bishops all together organized what
[1:47:50] was called the Roman Catholic Church
[1:47:52] which was Royal Roman it was called just
[1:47:54] got through taking the history yesterday
[1:47:56] and listen looking over it again and it
[1:47:57] was only to be for Rome alone in Rome
[1:48:00] was a royal Church others are just
[1:48:02] little sister churches to it it's called
[1:48:04] Catholic our church is also the Catholic
[1:48:07] Universal Church which is a a universal
[1:48:10] belief of all believers one of them is
[1:48:13] borned of the spirit of God and has the
[1:48:18] holy spirit in
[1:48:19] it and it proves by its life Doctrine
[1:48:23] and action that the Holy Spirit ends in
[1:48:25] there because it's a comforter that PRI
[1:48:28] Christ promised working in his church
[1:48:30] doing the same thing he did at the
[1:48:32] beginning am amen that's how the toxine
[1:48:35] of Christ salvation worked in the
[1:48:37] beginning that's way it works today
[1:48:38] brings forth the same thing the other is
[1:48:40] a interal conception of a denomination
[1:48:44] made up by a group of man amen which has
[1:48:47] a form of godliness as the prophet told
[1:48:49] us and denied this truth of power
[1:48:54] that's just as plain as I know how to
[1:48:55] make it now there is the two church one
[1:48:59] of them was born at Nia and the other
[1:49:02] was born at Pentecost and and one has
[1:49:06] always been against the other we come
[1:49:08] through the church ages to prove it
[1:49:10] one's against the other one of them is a
[1:49:12] fine dignified intellectual church with
[1:49:15] fine Scholars and so forth the other is
[1:49:18] class is a bunch of Holy
[1:49:20] Rollers it was at the beginning drunk
[1:49:24] illiterate fisherman and it's the same
[1:49:26] thing today it's still classed in the
[1:49:28] same category one of them is
[1:49:32] scientific the other one is spiritual
[1:49:35] one is scientific Arrangement the other
[1:49:37] one is spiritual discernment of the word
[1:49:40] one is scientifically arranged what
[1:49:42] groups of man says intellectual Bishops
[1:49:45] the other is absolutely born of the
[1:49:48] spirit of God and lives by the spirit of
[1:49:50] God and it performs and makes come to
[1:49:53] pass the words that God
[1:49:57] promised shows what toxine you're taking
[1:50:01] have you got educational toxine have you
[1:50:03] got the Holy Spirit toxine am all right
[1:50:07] all that subtleness of Satan how he can
[1:50:11] paint that
[1:50:12] picture intellectually can make a man
[1:50:15] that's not born to the spirit of God
[1:50:17] just turn around and around and there's
[1:50:20] no way intellectually to down them with
[1:50:22] it there's not a way it is a discernment
[1:50:26] by
[1:50:27] faith a discernment we see what the word
[1:50:30] says we believe it then brother Brandon
[1:50:31] they say they have the discernment then
[1:50:33] let the Holy Spirit produce exactly what
[1:50:36] he promised to produce then we believe
[1:50:38] it there's the evidence of it how did
[1:50:41] the toxine act when it struck the person
[1:50:44] these signs shall follow them that
[1:50:46] believe he said if the toxine struck
[1:50:48] that then that's all right amen
[1:50:55] praise the Lord you can stand with me
[1:50:58] you know it's one of those things that I
[1:51:01] like to get the word unadulterated
[1:51:03] straight from the prophet you know and I
[1:51:05] think that it's an hour where there's so
[1:51:08] many ways to deceive and be de you know
[1:51:12] to deceive and be deceived but praise
[1:51:14] God where is your Elijah you know God
[1:51:18] has sent Elijah to come and to divide
[1:51:23] the darkness and the light and so we're
[1:51:26] so grateful and you know it's just
[1:51:28] important that we maintain an atmosphere
[1:51:30] of prayer and the love of God because
[1:51:33] when we do that I believe God gives us
[1:51:35] Revelation amen and those are the things
[1:51:38] that are going to come upon the land
[1:51:39] that are all now manifesting we see
[1:51:42] there's an intellectual church that was
[1:51:43] born at NAA Council and but there's also
[1:51:46] a born again church amen you know and I
[1:51:49] just love the example of that shemite
[1:51:51] woman even that woman
[1:51:53] Aunt uh Jima you know she she was there
[1:51:56] and and I believe it's it's those that
[1:51:59] are sighing and crying for the
[1:52:01] Abominations done in the city I believe
[1:52:03] that God is going out now and he's
[1:52:05] marking and sealing those who are there
[1:52:08] in their prayer Closet in intercessory
[1:52:10] prayer and you know sighing and crying
[1:52:12] so let's be about our father's business
