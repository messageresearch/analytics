people meetings as long as you don't fall asleep on me if you fall asleep on me I could preach three and four hours so you got to stay awake in order to keep this thing moving that's our agreement can everybody agree with Meen if you don't amen me I slow down and we could be here till evening then I'll pick up the evening service so just keep going it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's turn in our Bibles Deuteronomy chapter 32 everybody hear me okay Deuteronomy chapter 32 and we're going to read verse nine Deuteronomy 32 verse 9 good job look at all these Bibles proud of you say Amen when you're there well I got to I got to hear you louder than that all right all right let's let's start with verse n for the Lord's portion is his people and Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling Wilderness he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest and fluth over her young and spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings I want to speak this morning on God's eaglets and if you have a need and and and I want and I I mean as we stand before God even our young people have needs I want you to lift your hand and say Lord remember me in these these meetings would you speak to me you know what it would mean what the value would be for God to speak to your need and God cares so God sees every hand let's have a word of prayer together Lord God Of Heaven Lord as we're gathered in this youth meeting Lord we want to welcome you as you had told Peter Peter do you love me he said you know I love you Lord he said feed my Lambs Lord we know that you care about your young people and what they're going through and I pray Lord Jesus as we lord are coming to the most important part of the service dear God that you would bless the word of God bless the understanding to our hearts speak to us this morning in your own way to every heart we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you can have your seats how many like animals raise your hand let me see how many enjoy animals that's all I thought there' be well hold them up high I guess there's more I love animals and I love nature because you can see God in nature you can how many like to be in the mountains how many like the mountains how many like the sea how many like the desert God is a god of variety isn't he how many like how how many like lions how about grizzly bears jellyfish no no go on Jelly one two jellyfish a few jellyfish how many like birds peacocks crows chickens Eagles that's what I want to preach about this morning how did you know I'm going to preach on Eagles an eagle is an interesting Bird yeah it's God builds everything God is a god of variety and so he makes the deserts different than the mountains and different than the sea and then all of God's animals they're distinct and they got their own qualities their own ability to camouflage their they've got their own nature and it's it's just marvelous to see how God designs creatures but one of the most interesting creatures of the Bible uh that God has made in creation is the eagle and the eagle not only is an amazing creature but he has spiritual significance in the scriptures and uh he's a bird of prey do you know what that means that means he's a hunter he's an avid Hunter he sees well he's quick and he can kill and not all animals are that way like a dove you know a dove is not a a predator a dove just eats grains and things but an eagle has sharp eyes and he has the ability to to catch his prey and he's he's a a bird that lives in the heavens now a chicken is a bird but a chicken lives in the earth amen he's got wings but he cannot fly to the heavens Like an Eagle an eagle is real special it's specially built brother Brenham said it's one of the highest flying birds and he said that it's its uh feathers are so tight in its body that you can't even pull a feather out with pliers because when he gets up there could you imagine if he soared into the heaven where the mountain tops and all a sudden he started losing his feathers he's like a and he plummets to the ground he's got to keep those feathers and so God makes sure he puts those feathers in there real tight so when he Soares to the heaven he won't lose a feather he needs everyone to get up there praise the Lord he's a special built bird I'm going to see if I can make make this work look at him how many like that picture he's got binocular vision I can't remember how many times his their eyes are better than ours and and they can see when they get up in the Heights they can see so far that any movement and and they can get to their prey very quickly I just love his eyes and God build him so he so he lives in the heavens uhoh Houston we got a problem oh look at that how do I go back see what impatience does there look at that no no no no go back back go to go to go to two there we go yeah go back one more there we go look at that how many would like to be an eagle to fly in the heaven wouldn't that be so fun to be an eagle for a day how many want to be a chicken for a day how many want to be an eagle for a day praise the Lord now he's specially built he's made to soar to soar into the heavens and brother brandham said that that not every bird a chicken could never live at this altitude even his ability to breathe his ability to see his ability just to just to soar through the heavens and brother brandham said Christians are special built people that God has created as he created this Eagle to live in the heavens God has created us to live in a spiritual Heavenly atmosphere we are built to be filled with the Holy Spirit we are built to see the things of God by faith we are God's Eagles and the eagle is special because God types himself as an eagle his wing tips go from tip to tip about eight feet and so he's a big bird and he needs big wings to carry his weight in the heavens God made him that way isn't that awesome he's got he's got a ratchet claw so when he catches something he sinks his claws in and he don't turn it loose and I think that's the way Believers ought to be when God gives you something we are in these meetings just sink your sink your Talons into it and the old ratchet claw won't turn it loose someone had told me that it's like a like a ratchet and he's got to eat the meat out from between his fingers in order to turn it loose praise the Lord he can go 40 miles per hour that's fast and he can go a 100 miles per hour in a dive so they can fly and they their their ability to sail through the air is absolutely incredible Supreme hunters and they kill duck and they kill rabbits and they kill deer and they can kill they can just kill about anything it's amazing and what I want to explain is he is designed for that place God made him to be there praise the Lord I love it and God calls himself an eagle Papa eagle Jehovah eagle and God calls His prophets Eagles you know why because a a prophet is a Seer and the higher he goes in the spirit the further he can see and he could see storms coming he could see judgment coming he could see things coming so God had called His prophets Eagles and this is the best part God calls his children Eagles we are eagles we're spiritual Eagles how beautiful God wants us to climb into spiritual attitud altitudes we are not Earthbound we're Heavenly bound and I believe when we come together in worship it should be Heavenly places that our worship should be Heavenly worship that our faith should be in the heavens our mind should be in the heavens our heart should be in Heavens our our our affections upon things above we are looking upward our destiny is upward praise the Lord now another detail that I love about the eagle is that h a a husband and wife Eagle they are mates for life they stay together which is really neat see if I can I do the next slide please I think that might be the easier way to go brother Craig was messing things up so bad can everybody can everybody read that in the back it says doth the eagle Mount up at thy command this is out of the Book of Job or make her nest on high she dwells and abides upon the rock upon the crack of The Rock and the Strong place from then she seeketh the prey and her eyes Behold a far off her young also suck up blood and where the slain is there is she praise the Lord the eagle builds her nest in the mountain peaks far above the coyote far above the fox or the snakes or ones that would want to eat her babies she flies so high that nothing on the earth can can harm them and that's where God wants to put his church this morning so high from the devil that he cannot reach you a wolf would love to to sink his teeth into a baby eagle how many like to eat chicken fried chicken I imagine a young a young eaglet would taste like fried chicken to a coyote oh he licks his lips if I could just sink my teeth in the water and be like just having a a a chicken dinner but how is he supposed to get there when he when he builds his nest in the mountain peaks he lives there how beautiful and look look at there builds him a Nast out of sticks and up there who who's going to get him and you know when you come to the Lord God is our protector and we are in the CFT of The Rock and nothing can harm us when God build when God births Us in the mountain peaks praise the Lord everybody love the Lord Brother bham told a story of a time he went to Cincinnati Zoo I won't hold you long and if if if you start lessening on the amens I might just break into my long preaching so stay with me brother Bram went to Cincinnati Zoo and he said I saw the wor one of the worst things that I had ever seen in my life he said I Saw an Eagle he was in a cage and he said the eagle was looking up to the heavens and he said it was trying to get out of the cage and it would it would make flops and it would hit the cage and it would fall back onto the floor and he said his eyes was rolling and he said he had bruised his head and his wings was all beat up and he said said and he was looking up he looked bewildered and he wanted out of the cage he said it was so sad because he was not meant to live in a cage but he was meant to live in the heavens in the mountaintops with the clouds but his heart was longing to be there but a man had put him in a cage isn't that sad here God had created him to be free God had created him to live in The Wide Open Heavens and here he is some man outsmarted him and stuck him in a cage and brother Brenham said it was one of the saddest sights that I ever saw he said but there is a sadder sight he said a son or a daughter of God that was meant to be a son or daughter of God he said that is caged up with addiction caged up with sickness and caged up with sickness when he ought to be free in the heavens and brother brandham said what I would have done the money I would pay to set that to set him free because he's longing for the heavens because he was meant to live in the power of God I'm trying to let you know young people we Are Spiritual Eagles we are not an Earthbound people our souls are to be in the Heavenly places that God can speak to us and God can deal with us how many say Lord I want more faith I want to climb up higher in my experience we are created to live above the world and above sin and death we're created to live above all the dangers of the earth praise the Lord and you know Jesus when Jesus came do you know the Bible said he said the spirit of the Lord has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and so forth and he said to open the prison do you know that's what Jesus does is when eagles are in the cage Jesus opens the cage and he said you're free and you could fly out of that cage into the heavens that's what sin did Sin put us in a cage that's what the devil did to the human race it stuck us in a cage but Jesus opened the C ages said fly little ego you're free hallelujah how many would it be free whom the son is made free is free indeed I want you to tell the devil that I'm free indeed that's the way God made us to be as free as that eagle we saw flying that's what God wants you to be in these meetings God wants you to be free from the world free from sin free from complexes free from Fear God wants you to be free Hallelujah we ought to be soaring like a flying eagle this morning I pray I praise the Lord for his goodness to us free from sin forgiven free from the past and bear with me here she builds her nest in the mountain peaks yeah would you go back to the one you just had how beautiful that's a gold eagle look how high right up there in the cliff nothing can harm him nothing can hurt him now when she prepares her nest go back yeah when she prepares her nest look how big that is some of the biggest Nest uh I don't know I don't have the dimensions but they can make some huge nests and so they go get sticks and grap V and twigs and and they build them strong enough to to be up there in that mountain place and she line she goes down brother brandom said she'll go down and she'll find a rabbit she'll kill that rabbit and has anyone ever petted a rabbit raise your hand if you've touched a rabbit you ever felt how soft and warm it is will that eagle will line that that nest with with soft rabbit fur or he'll go kill a little lamb and he'll take that lamb skin and he'll make it real soft and then he'll take straw whatever he could find soft and he will he will build the inside see how many sticks are on the outside he'll build the inside real soft like a mommy tries to wrap her baby real sweet and snuggly that's what the Eagles do to their babies so that she builds the nest real nice and she starts brooding over it and so well do you know what brooding is who knows what brooding is what's brooding is what well what they what it is have you ever seen a a bird just cover their eggs like this they sit on the eggs they're creating an atmosphere because eggs cannot just come forth without an atmosphere and God has baby eagles here and they've got to have an atmosphere and it's got to be the right kind of atmosphere how many want to see some Eagles hatch out of this meeting we need an atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and Mommy Eagle creates that atmosphere that's what the pastor is doing that's what the elders are doing they want to see Eagles come out of this meeting so they create an atmosphere that'll keep that I I saw a picture of of an eagle totally covered in snow it was totally covered in this its nest and it had eggs under it because the snow was not going to harm those eggs whatever happens in this world it's not going to harm this atmosphere it's determined to create an atmosphere and if the atmosphere is created whether we live in the darkest Tower or not Eagles will be born Hallelujah and so now she Broods that's what brooding is honey she Broods over that that's her job now she's got to stay on those eggs creating an atmosphere until they break out of that egg is that wonderful in other words you see look at the there we go perfect picture she's right over top of those eggs nothing is going to hurt them there's a special Nearness of God in these kind of meetings how many feel that the Lord is near God is speaking to us God Is wooing Us special what the whole purpose of the brooding is to bring forth the eagle out of the egg and the yet now on on the outside that's what you see but on the inside of the egg something special is happening God is forming this little Eagle inside of this egg and as it gets bigger and bigger pretty soon it gets too big for the egg and God created what's called a pipping tooth on the beak of the little eaglet and that pipping tooth is a tool that'll fall off after it gets out of the egg it's a tool to help crack itself out so the mama can create the atmosphere but the eagle has to have their own faith the eagle has to have its own desire that I'm getting up out of this egg I'm going to come into the congregation of the Saints I'm going to come into the presence of God and God built on the neck of that eagle a muscle it's a pipping muscle strong and it starts losing its air it can't breathe through the pores of that egg as it as it fills that egg so it's got to get out or it'll die and that's the way God wants you to come to the promises I've got to have the Holy Ghost I've got to know God is my savior and so he starts pipping he starts amening the word I'm going to receive something in this meeting God's going to meet with me in this meeting and now the mom can produce the atmosphere but it takes the eagle to want to get out of that egg how many want more of God you young people how many want more of God see you God sees that desire and God has put a little pipping tool in your heart that cries Amen to the word of God that that faith will start beating on that shell I've got to come out of here it's life and death you've got to know God as your own Savior and so he starts pipping and it takes two to four days to get out of there and then he breaks it and when he breaks it oxygen comes in what's he doing he's trying to break into another world let me tell you there's something much more than this Dimension when we come into these meetings that's our desires to break to that other world the place where all things are possible Hallelujah tipping its way out of the egg Satan get off me Satan move out of my way I'm coming through I'm coming out of this condition I'm coming out of this depression I'm coming out of here hallelujah the eagle designed to break out of that ache and the mother is sitting there watching her babies Jehovah Eagle is watching this meeting he's watching you on the front row and on the second row he knows your name he cares about you and he's watching over you when he does all he can do he watches because now it's got to be something that comes out of you Hallelujah the word Eagle means feed her with the beak have you ever seen an eagle feed it or any bird have you ever seen any bird feed its babies how do they feed them yeah good job good job that's exactly what they do she if you didn't hear her she said they go hunt worms and they take them in their mouth and when they get to the nest the babies are going like this and they drop it right into their mouth and so Eagle is called theater of the Beast or Ripper of the beak because they only eat meat years ago I was studying on my front porch and it was as quiet as could be and in my pine tree all of a sudden I heard out of nowhere these little birds start out of nowhere it was totally quiet and when I looked into the pine tree the mama had just brought food and as soon as food arrived a Revival started and that's why God feeds his b his baby eagles he feeds them with his beak the word of God he feeds us from heaven with his mouth and when God feeds us with his mouth a Revival breaks over the church mommy me next me next me next how many are hungry for the word of God hallelujah hallelujah Wonder hungry-heart people fresh meat every day every service praise the Lord now this is where it gets good am I doing okay on time it's because you're amening I was afraid we're going to be here for a long time but you're aen and well so the one thing it's a little gross about the eagle is when he eats he regurgitates I'm talking about the babies so I want you to picture now that Nest I described nice and cozy and soft but the longer they're there the Nester The Nest gets and you got to remember he's catching fish he's dropping fish in there dropping snakes in there dropping rabbits in there and then the babies are regurgitating and so the nest is full it starts getting filled with waste it starts getting nasty in other words comes a time where we got to leave the nest there comes a time where God wants to call us to what he made us for there is a nurturing stage of our journey and when we come to the Lord God babies us he softens everything thing around us Andy and it closes a special love a special closeness of his presence but there comes a time where God said you will not always be in the nest am you will not always be a baby but I have plans for you what me sailing in the heavens you have ego potential and that ego wants to see you live your potential right now we have a little lot of baby eaglets and our job is to protect them and to feed them the word of God and to create an environment where they hear the word of God and can be born again but they will not always stay little eaglets God made them to be Sons and Daughters of God God made them in such a way that they can believe with their own faith and cast out devils and lay their hands on the sick and they recover God made them to be Sons and Daughters of God God knows the potential lays in them so you know what the eagle does the eagle starts stirring the nest and that stirring of the nest what that means is she begins to remove all of the soft comfortable all of the Lamb skinned all of it she begins throwing the down out out of the nest and and all of the sudden the the the little eots are getting poked and and uncomfortable and what he what God is trying to do is make them willing to take a leap of faith pretty soon The Nest that they loved it becomes it becomes a place that is no longer comfortable and Mommy Eagle is trying to get them to set their affection above so it removes the Comfort sometimes God gives us trials he gives you hard trials to make you so he is not trying to harm you he wants to P pull your potential out you don't have to have the pastor's Faith you've got to have your own faith pretty soon that warm little Nest now this is all the little ones know God's about ready to do something wonderful so she pulls out the down she starts stirring the nest I like that that word stir means awaken she is trying to awaken the eagle to what it is he wants you to know your own potential he wants you to know that all things are possible to them that believe yes and he stirs and he stirs and the more that she stirs the more uncomfortable the little eaglets become and there's nowhere to go what do we do young people what do we do where do we go there's one chance the Eagle's like this is absolutely miserable I feel like a chicken my life has come to this after a few days usually they lay two eggs brother Eagle said hey I got an idea what is it look what is this we got wings like Mama got look you look just like like Mama thank you you look like Papa thanks hey we don't have to stay in this Nest I think no you don't I think we can how many feel like they can we're going to have to stay in this old nest a stinky nasty Nest oh that poke me in my back is so sore is the bang gone no more b g we have one chance let's fly are we going to try it it'll take a step of Faith we've never done it before but we were born to be Eagles Something Is Calling into the heavens and I believe we can do it the brother looks over to sister said you think we can she said oh yeah I think we can they start going like this and they up up up o how did I do that was amazing have you ever thought of the Olympics no let me try I'm F I'm f a little practice and I think we can do it look at me how much time 20 seconds I'm going to go to 30 yeah if if there's such a thing as a wing five and all a sudden it strikes I'm out of here brother I'm getting tired I'm my landing gear is down I'm going down spread your wings the wind catches and lifts him Hallelujah come on Brother come on sister out the N goes I'm getting TI No spread your wings and the wind catches her and now they're having a Revival on the front row now they're soaring like God made them to soar you are eagles you are God's Eagles Hallelujah [Applause] God wants us to fly he brother brandham told a story he was hunting elk in Colorado and he said a storm come through and he said it crystallized all of the of the pine trees and he said the storm blew by Brother Bram hid behind a a tree and when he come out he said the sun was setting and it threw a rainbow over the over the backdrop and he said it was just beautiful and he heard a wolf start calling to its mate and then he heard an elk bugle they had got separated in the storm and they were calling to each other and brother brandham said God is calling to his church brother brandham was just taking it all in because God reveals himself in nature and he said he heard a chipmunk he called it a pine squirrel is that picture that there he is brother random called him the policeman of the woods he said he is just chatter chatter chatter chatter he's like what is he all worked up about and he said he looked and there was a big eagle that got pushed down in the storm and he said ah that's what he's so upset about days of Miracles are passed that was for the apostles God don't send prophets you can cut your hair it's okay and that eagle was standing there he said just looking brother brandom said wow God caught his attention he said aren't you afraid of me I've got a gun and he said that eagle just sat there and kept flexing his wings he said why aren't you afraid of me he said then it struck him oh you have confidence in your god-given wings he said you could fly out of here any time and brother brandom said God has given the church two Wings the old and the New Testament and how we ought to have confidence in our god-given promises cheddar cheddar cheddar cheddar chatter ched you're a Brandon M ched God don't do that pillar fire is not ched chatter chatar he said he got sick of hearing itl in other words you don't have to listen to it and he said when he got tired of it he said he leaped and pumped his wings twice and then set them and he said when he set those wings he began to go higher and higher riding upon the wind and brother Bram said yes that's what we've got to do we have got to let the wind of the Holy Spirit carry Us carry us to the mountain peaks many of us are trying too hard we're pumping and struggling but God wants you to set your Wings of Faith young
