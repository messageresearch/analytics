Description:
The Evidence of Election
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Service: August 23,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

lord jesus christ we ask amen amen good to be gathered in the presence of the lord this morning i want to welcome everyone amen god bless you as you invite remind you for our psalm reading amen god bless you good morning i read in psalm 113 this morning you know there's a verse in psalm 113 verse 1 it says praise ye the lord praise o ye servants of the lord praise the name of the lord you know it's interesting here in many places in the scriptures the lord makes a distinction between praising the lord and praising his name and those are you know kind of two different things and i got to thinking about a name what's what's the what's the difference what's the distinction between praising the lord praising his name you know in matthew 18 20 there's a verse that we we know by heart you know it says that for where two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst of them you know it's you know i think that what we have to remember is it's this isn't a magic spell right this isn't an incantation we say that if we're in his name suddenly he's there right but in exodus 20 24 he makes a statement to the children of israel he's talking about the places where he's going to set up to worship and he makes a statement there in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee and will bless thee you know i think the thing that is important remember is he chooses where to put his name he chooses what to associate his name with you know even when you're about your daily lives or you're coming in contact with people how many times have you heard someone look at a project or look at a work and say hey i don't want my name associated with that i don't i don't want anything to do with that that does not reflect me right and likewise how many people are so proud to ascribe their name to a great work or to an achievement it's considered an honor to apply someone's name to something that was done that was good well the lord is no different there's only certain things that he's willing to associate his name with it's his identity it's his characteristics it's his attributes in fact in second chronicles when he was talking to the children of israel trying again to find a place to worship he said i'm not i didn't choose any city i didn't choose any man to put my name but you know i chose jerusalem to put my name there a very specific place right you know he's very careful about what he associates his name with the name is more than a a label right if i rattle off names like nick shafer or chris brunetti or joan logan those names probably don't mean anything to anyone in this room but they mean something to me because they're people i know when i hear those names there's attributes and there's characteristics and there's behaviors and there's certain work styles things that i know they would do things when i see work i recognize as being part of them things that i know they would say or they wouldn't so what's interesting there is you can't know a name really until you know the person that's involved in the name not only that but there's there's people that are called by his name in ii chronicles 7 14 it says if my people which are called by my name the moment you put your name to something it becomes part of you it belongs part of it's part of it's part of your your character in fact he's not going to share it with anything in isaiah 48 10 it says behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another he's not going to share his name with any human characteristics or skill sets or talent or reputation or anything and usually he's only going to give his name to those who have been through a refining and a preparation process his name is a precious thing right you know there are many people that go about saying they're going to do things in his name you know matthew 7 22 says many will say to me in that day lord lord have i not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and what does he say he says and then while i profess unto them i never knew thee depart from me ye that work iniquity so you have to know the person before you can truly know what that name involves and finally in psalm 91 14 he says this because he has set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name so when we talk about praising his name his name is a very special set of characteristics and it's his signature and he will only sign his name to something that reflects him but then when somebody reflects him and bears his name then his name is continually being praised in the earth living epistles red of all men praise his name how many of you would like to see his name praised amen in your life so every time you read that verse that says praise his name may that be me may i be praising his name in the image that i bear so let's read psalm 113 together it's just a short short scripture starting in verse 1 praise ye the lord praise ye servants of the lord praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord from this time forth and forevermore from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the saint the lord's name is to be praised the lord is high above all nations and his glory above the heavens who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children praise ye the lord amen amen that's what we're here to do this morning praise the lord you may have your seats man let's sing fill my way every day with love amen oh let me walk boys

you talked about a an explanation that was a complete different perspective for me you know in my pursuit for perfection in christ even in my physical pursuit so oftentimes i beat myself i'll just say you ought to be bigger than this or you ought to be in a higher place than this you know and then when you talked about that and i said okay okay god's judgment his opinion about what i need to be where i need to be and so he's pushing me he's teaching me that every lesson and my wife asked me the question and say can you tell me why but you prayed about this and you prayed about that and it was everything was good so what's the problem she's just asking me she wanted to know i said i couldn't give you an answer but then two days ago and i sat down and it just came to me and said well i'm teaching you i'm teaching you every step of the way you go i'm teaching you and i said lord please just help me i was reading brother brown where he said i think the report from africa was talking about permissive will and perfect will and i said oh lord i just want to be in your perfect will and so i'll sing this song please pardon me if my melody seems a little off uh but he's still walking

[Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] wish they had a vocabulary to express your greatness or a heart big enough to show you the love that you deserve lord you've been so marvelous to us oh it slips us by we don't understand quite yet all that you have prepared for us what the wonders and glorious of the world that we're going to we just asked this morning father that you receive our praise you receive our worship this morning that you share with us your word this morning and that we fellowship around the great things that you have to offer we ask you to bless us this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's turn over to the book of corinthians the 12th chapter of the book of corinthians and so we want to welcome brother joelle and sister rachel tobaya our newlyweds are here with us today where are you hiding back here somewhere i don't see him there they are now god bless you both today and and uh we married them here a week or two ago and and they're still together so that i must i must have done a good job okay and then so we're grateful for that we're also uh like to welcome any of our guests and visitors this morning that are here with us the lord richly uh bless you we want to kind of have a little bible study this morning i hope that i can bring this in a manner to express it to you what's on my heart uh so will uh like a friend of mine shared with me the other day said i never can figure out how you get from where you start to where you finish but uh but maybe there will be something in between that'll be a blessing to you this morning so lord richly bless you uh and as we just pray that the lord will bless his word to us this is uh this is kind of a little foundation of where that we want to go uh but so we just hope that it'll be a blessing to you this is found in the first corinthians the 12th chapter and where there's uh paul goes through the the different gifts and the different things that god has manifested he says but the manifestation of the spirit given to every man to profit with all and so he talks about these different gifts and now he comes down and he's placing those gifts and bringing to the church to the realization of the body so let's read these scriptures 4 12 first corinthians 12 12 for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not the i i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him let me read that again but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we've bestowed more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but god has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that parch which lacketh that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another whether one member suffereth all members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of christ and members in particular our heavenly father we ask you to bless us today in jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning we're only having one service until september 6 and then we'll resume our evening services uh september 6th with our communion service we tried to expand a little more parking places over here as you noticed because we might start working on the farther part we're making some changes as we're working towards our our uh program if the lord would continue to bless us and we have submitted our plat to the city so they have 30 days to approve the plat and then we should receive our building permit so we just ask you to continue to pray that the lord will bless us um we'd like to if we titled this message this morning this little thought that's on my heart i would probably like to call it the evidence of election the evidence of election and it might be kind of uh i want to make sure that we that it's expressed this way not necessarily the proof of it so i don't want to take it from the side of what we do if we're elected we want to get to that part but there's the part on the beginning that god does in our election and we read the scriptures of the body because uh i think that it's necessary for us that our individual desire i believe is we all want to be more christ-like we all want to go on higher ground and and i think that as a body of believers that we want to rise to higher heights we want to we want to accomplish more we want to do more and we want to rise up in in uh uh greater spiritual realms than we've ever been before we'd uh you we just you just don't want to sit still because you find out that when you sit still things get very common to you yeah and and you get used to it and then it doesn't seem to do for you what it used to do for you and it just seems to uh you come to the place where you just you know you just go grow tired and and uh but you know if you're if you're going greater and you're entering in and you're experienced things and fellowship with god greater than you ever have before it creates an expectation and without an expectation without something that you believe you can obtain then there's only one thing left and that's almost a form of spiritual depression and so we don't want to get to the place where it just seems like we're laboring in vain but we want to we want to rise up into higher heights a greater experience more fat more fellowship with god more love with god and so we want to talk a little bit about election for just a few moments as we move on but it's important that you answer the question about your election that has got to be settled in your heart first and and you you've got to you've got to come to that conclusion that you're chosen and and that that election uh is of god and that god orchestrated that election in your life in other words it's not you didn't choose him he chose you and so once that election is established in your heart and that's settled that doesn't mean you're free from failures it doesn't mean you're free from mistakes it doesn't it does it doesn't mean that you don't have things you've got to overcome but it's the one thing that's totally settled in your heart is that he chose me he picked me and that's what election is election is a choice made by god and we could read in the scripture if you wanted to turn in your bible up with me to uh the gospel of saint john at in just a few little scriptures in in saint john 6 and 37 he says all the father giveth me shall come to me and he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out and and so we we have that assurance that all that the father had chosen or the father hath given to me they'll come to me and i'm going to receive them so if if god has called you and elected you and and chosen you you will come uh you know paul i think experienced that firsthand uh he was set out to put havoc in the church and he was going to put an end to this heresy that these people were uh preaching uh concerning the christ being the messiah and the fulfilling of the law and this new practice that they had entered into of of gathering together and worshiping in the spirit and he thought man now this has got to stop and so he went and got orders from the high priest that uh i'm going to put an end to this i don't think this is good but he he didn't understand one thing that he was elected that he was chosen and all that the father had given him will come and so he settled that another scripture we could turn to is in saint john the 15th chapter and it's another great uh comforting scripture to the believer and he says here in saint john 15 15 he says henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord does but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you now hold that there because we're going to touch on it in a little bit ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things i command you that ye love one another now that is a a tremendous scripture and once again he said i you didn't choose me i have chosen you and so election you we have to come to this place that that would be what we'd have to to settle on is the fact that god chose us and you know coming from my background i battled that for a very long time until i surrendered because coming from the background that i had and and the complexes that i grew up with and and just overall uh that part of me that didn't seem to fit in in society that i always wanted to look at my flesh and look at my works and look at what i was doing and weigh those things as the source of my election and they didn't have anything to do with my election because god is the potter and we could read this scripture in this statement in the church age book he says here in is now set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons and that's always daughters is always attached to the family of sons sons like himself therefore before him lies all mankind is one lump of clay and out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love and another way of his love there is not there cannot be so we we see that it's his choosing so the lump of clay is the same but he makes one lump under honor and another lump on the dishonor that's why he says who can the pot say to the potter why hath thou made me thus it's his election for his own good pleasure he makes the choice and so if you try to weigh yourself or or measure yourself or or say that you know if i i'm chosen when i accomplish this or accomplish that then you've molded your own vessel but if you understand that he can tear that vessel down he can rebuild that vessel the way that he wants to he set it in motion the choosing was his own choosing and he's going to reprove and he's going to correct and he's going to chastise and he's going to instruct and you know i know what it's like to be completely torn down it is not fun it is not even as no chastisement is pleasant at the time but afterwards it brings forth a fruit of of uh you know okay and a piece that comes with it and and you know they they've found that even even with children now i i don't believe in it and maybe in my life i've might respond spank my children too hard i don't believe in beating children and i don't believe in spanking them when you're angry but is a correction out of love even if it comes with a a a few uh you know attitude adjustments uh it they they they receive that as someone that cares for them that cares about their their outcome that is interested in them they don't take it all from a negative standpoint in fact they crave that they need that and many times a neglected person will find themselves out to doing things and things that aren't right because they want that chastisement they want that correction because they need that direction you just can't turn the child loose out on the door and say go fend for yourself go take care of yourself go raise yourself they're created to have a guiding hand and and so they need that and they they need that correction and that's the love of god to show interest in it so you you've got to take the measuring of yourself out of the picture in other words you don't provide the only evidence of your election that that that's not where it is but when you understand why that he elected why that he chose and then you can you go back to look at what's the evidence of your election so how do i know he elected me in other words what did he do to me that would let me realize that i was elected so let's just read a little bit i know i'm not a very good reader and but if you will bear with me i'd like to uh read in a little portion out of the church age book found on page 336 of the church age book and it says here he says he says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it is of whom it is said in genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth also it says in exodus 20 11 for in six days the lord made heavens and earth the sea and all that is in them is and rested the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of the finished physical creation surely we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that god created god how could god create when he himself is the creator he said now but now he is standing in the midst of his church and we know that in the book of revelations that was the first picture that john drew of the seventh church ages was christ standing in the midst of his church so in other words he's interested into this church he's it's his church and he's in the midst of the church he's not standing afar off seeing if you can make it through the maze he is present with his church our part is to come to the realization and to receive i sav that we can see him standing in this church we can recognize his presence with us this morning but he is standing in the midst of a church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last day he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church you understand so it he is the creator of that church so this elected body is a created body it's a created election it's not just somebody that made a few adjustments to themselves and meant the mold this is not a remodel you understand you are not a remodel you are more than a remodel god just didn't take what you were and remodel you do a few little changes on you make a few little adjustments and everything no he makes you a new creation we are new creations in christ jesus he does it he does it with nail scarred hands he does it with chastisement he does it with rebuke he does it with sometimes breaking it all down he does it with nail scarred hands it's the love of god but he's the creator of this he says he is the creator of the church the heavenly bridegroom creating his own bride oh my god okay let's start look at this wonderful relationship of election so you've been elected to be created amen that sounds good as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cell from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cell in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to the human ovary supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lo a body hath the father prepared for me god not mary provided that body merit was a human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was god man he was the son of god he was the new creation man and god meant and joined as he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race okay and we ministered that subject one time that that we are not a religion we are a people we are a new created race we're all of the same uh uh origin we're all of the same life you understand we are not a body made up of uh parts that keep pulled together it doesn't matter where that you came for or where you come or what your rapper is you are in this church in the living church of the living god you are now part of a new race that's why that we don't defend any other race but the race of god that what we are i don't know what the world's out there talking about today and everything if you want to talk race to me this is the race i talk about this is the race that we are we are a new race a new creation a new people in christ jesus it's his spirit we are born of the same spirit by one spirit we are all born partakers of one nature because that's where we are so you've got to understand what your election is too i'm just reading it i uh uh so he actually by he says he says he was the of the new creation god met man he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new therefore can you see that through man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ has become the new creation of god you leave the old order behind and you realize that i've been elected or chosen to be a part of a new creation now if you're not sure of your election how are you going to be sure of this new creation why halt you between two opinions choose this day whom you're going to serve are you going to serve the world are you going to serve the old man are you going to serve the old order or are you going to be part of the new creation the new race the new person the body of christ don't halt between the two opinions don't get stuck out there between the two of them okay you the old order is going to fail you'll never be able to straighten it up [Music] they're trying to create a a kingdom they try to create health through medicine medicine isn't the answer uh to health you know what the cause of bad health is is sins amen man sinned and that's why there's sickness that's why there's death it's the attribute of sin it's the attribute of disbelief you can take all the drugs create all the pills mix all the herbs and vitamins together i haven't found one pill outside of the gospel that ever gives life there's no life outside of it no life they they're they work hard but they're never they're never going to keep man there's only one thing that keeps man from passing from from death and that's if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body there's that that's the only way of life that there is you can trust in science science has changed for mankind at one time if you were sick they would cut you and they'd take two or three pints of your blood out of you well i guess you felt so bad that the minute you felt better you thought you were well there's no talent science is not man's answer education is not man answer the only answer for man is the new birth is to be part of a new creation and that created people are chosen of god it's his choosing it's his election that that's what settles it he says he says the old creation he says and ye are let me go back here he says and you have passed away behold all things are become new there you are seek that through that through man was of the old order or creation now in the union with christ he has become the new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus made unto good works ephesians 4 2 24 and that ye put on the new man which is after god is created in the righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is a new creation it is a it is another creation distinct from the old one and remember that was the curse of lady osea was to get in this luke warm state of mixing the two creations in other words you can't take religion and the new creation and ever take it and fix the old creation because all you would be doing is making that old creation over this is a death to the old man it is a death to the old world it is the laying down of the ideas laying down of the systems laying down of the education laying down of the science it is delaying and leaving those things which are behind behind and pressing for a higher calling in christ jesus now you see your election is is not an education that would be like getting a scholarship to a a university or something that they're going to re re-educate you no this is not this is a creation it's him creating a bride for himself so if you you you haven't been elected to have a knowledge you've been elected as a part of a new creation and he is going to perform that and make that creation come to pass he says new creation it is not another he says that's exactly what it says a new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh not dealing there so you could that that's what we we talked a little bit last week or before that it takes revelation that if you have to overcome something in the flesh you've got to deal with it in the spirit flesh can't war against flesh it takes more than something natural to defeat something natural it takes something supernatural to defeat something natural so it's like you can't fight at with the the saying you can't fight fire with fire you just got a whole lot more fire and if you try to fight flesh with flesh you end up with a whole lot more flesh that's why it's important that even in your dealings with members of the body or with other people you can't fight something that's carnal with a carnal nature you can't fight anger with anger you can't fight criticism with criticism all you've got is a whole lot more criticism you understand there's got to be some form of supernatural intervention in our lives to overcome the flesh you can't overcome the flesh with flesh kingdom doesn't war against itself so it it it comes to the realization because what we're talking about this morning is coming up higher not just as individuals we preach there's too much individuality we're talking about coming higher as a body each member fitted and joined together supplying to the other their need he said this is distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham in abraham issued to uh godly isaac la line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has proposed a new creation hallelujah i represent maybe the irish from the old into the new you could go back i don't care what your heritage is what your background is but you the only reason that you're here and you are where you're from and you have the background you do and the country you do was the one purpose only and that was to fulfill his word because he said from every tongue every kindred every nation that was so he could fulfill his word so it could be a new creation it would be his creation it wouldn't be a man-made creation oh i could go there hallelujah isn't that beautiful but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god satan's the one that came up with the religion satan's the one that came up with denominations in churches and dogmas and creeds and and i'm this and i'm that i'm methodist presbyterian baptist catholic pentecostal they're blasphemous names they've all got a program to produce something and they produce a spirit but when you're re-created you're recreated by the spirit of god that's the only thing you know i i know what it's like to be a hot head you have a temper that that was you know that was the what was in the old man you know i i came i i got in a little fight with the fella and he was a lot bigger guy than i was but somehow we got on the ground and and i i was on top of him and he bit me you know i mean i'd have bit myself i think but he bit me up you know on the on the you know i was kneeling on his shoulders and he reached over and bit me on the inside of my leg and i i it hurt and it made me so angry that i grabbed the lunch pail and in a rage an insanity i could have killed that kid if somebody didn't get to me and drag them off of me and i was foaming and i was angry and i was totally beside myself it was nothing but a spirit it was just the hand of god that i i don't have that in my life but you talk about having to be something else has to come in there this is the true revelation of god that was his purpose this purpose took form through election so god's purpose was he wanted to create a church he wanted to create a bride that's that what he was he didn't want religions he didn't want he wasn't looking for church houses he didn't want holy buildings he wanted a chosen people that he created that he molded that he taught that he formed with his hands they they didn't vary from the path they they didn't have their own program they weren't trying to fix the world they weren't trying to do that that they had died out to south and now they were allowing god to perform this creation and he already showed us in shadow and type in genesis that creation with god is a transitional process it's a transformation so in other words god didn't instantly take us from one to the other he elects us and then he starts the process of transformation so if we could ever settle on the on the fact of our election then we could allow the transformation to take place but if we keep looking for the trans uh the transformation to prove the election you're always in a defeated state you look here a while and then you look there a while you look here a while then you look there a while so we're trying to move away from the applying the transformation to the evidence of elections there's a process that you went through before the translation transformation excuse me the transformation took place are you with me am i am i up am i all into myself up here i don't mean to be this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of his church as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass okay you you understand praise god there's a sovereign power that's going to bring this to pass we can solve the question of election then we're able to submit ourselves to the sovereign transforming power of god because it doesn't matter what he has to transform all you have to know is he chose you to transform and if he chose you he's going to do it because nothing can stop it that's all satan tries to do is delay the transforming of transformation he just tries to delay it getting everybody caught up in this and everybody caught up in that even the angel coming to daniel said man i was on my way a long time ago but but i there was something that withstood me and i had a battle you know so don't let the battle get you down once you get your election secure his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation by his own decree he is oh hallelujah he elected the members of this new creation remember your members in particular if every member of the body and you say body in this scripture he referred to it as a race that that we're a people right we're an elected created people not of this world come from out amongst them my people and be ye separate my people and be separate oh don't get trapped in this political america do not get trapped in this political world do not get trapped in prosperity don't get trapped in those things let's put on the mind that was in christ let's rise up to our position in the new creation of god why defend anything that's man-made why defend the catholic church why why defend some man-made doctrine or some man-made creed or some man-made work why defend something that is man-made when he is making a new creation and this creation is brought forth and brought to pass by election all that you'd have to know is hallelujah praise god i've been elected by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to adoption of children according to his good pleasure of his will by his omnipotence and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church revealing glory from his receiving glory from his bed brethren if he did not make sure oh my all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass ephesians 2 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will hallelujah aren't you glad that you belong to him so i i would say that let's just talk a moment about this election what what are the things that i know about myself that shows me i'm elected now we're not talking about the transformation that takes place after the election we're going back to the choosing process right so here you are in life just tooling through life you might be kicking the ball on the soccer field you might be playing baseball you might be a musician you know what i mean okay you might just be a restaurant hopper i i don't know whatever you are you're just going through life you go to church with mommy because they drag you to church i was an altar boy because i was raised a catholic and i was in catholic school and i figured that if i was a good alter boy that they might give me a break it's a good political move don't you think you know that maybe the nuns would stop pulling my hair out this is just the result of all those times that the the nuns pulled on my hair i was just going through life as we're all going to life and and i'm just going to take four things that i think are evidence of our election and the first one's conviction you know that's what the scripture says that the holy spirit would do it would reprove sin and righteousness so all in your lives you're just living your life and then for some reason in your life there's something in you that's a conviction when you are doing wrong you know it now you might not be trained to listen to it but because of your election there was a conviction in your life excuse me there was a conviction and an awareness of doing good and evil there was a consciousness in fact the scripture says that a man can turn down that conviction to the place that his conscience is finally seared with the hot iron but every elected seed has experienced conviction because that's what the spirit does when god's going to call you he's got some place in your life start to intervene on the path that you're on now this is before your knowledge i i'm i'm sure i'm not positive but i'm pretty sure none of you came out of the womb and at about eight months old looked up at your parents and said did you know the seven seals have been opened no but there was a time when you're convicted that sense about yourself that you realize that there was an awareness of two spirits it could have been when you were five it could have been later it could have been some time in your life but there was a conviction so now we're saying here's the evidence how do i know how do i know that i was elected i can look back and say there was a conviction that came in my life and started convicting me of sin i consciously was aware and felt it it was a feeling convictions of feeling if you can sit in the church house and if the preacher starts preaching on something he doesn't know where you are he doesn't know what condition you're in he doesn't know what you said and what you talk about but all of a sudden he starts preaching and it doesn't matter he could be preaching about the the sheep going into the sheepful and all of a sudden you're vibrating you feel every eye in the place he's talking about me and everybody knows it i've had people come up to me and say were you talking about me i said which part let me know no you don't know i don't know what's going on in your life i don't know what's going on in your mind unless it's a physical manifestation of an attitude or an atmosphere you create or words that come out of your mouth i don't know where you're at it doesn't look like anybody in here starving but if i saw you were frail and hungry then i could do it but that's what the spirit does that's what conviction does it starts working on the inner man that you're not even aware of conviction it's an evidence of election another ones what brother billy so beautifully spoke on wednesday evening was that thirst a painful desire an emptiness in your spirit that you long to be filled nothing can fill it it's a void okay it doesn't matter you could be raised in church and nothing will fill that void but the creator of that void because he created the void and he's got the plug look he created that it doesn't matter if you tried to satisfy it with drugs if you try to satisfy with alcohol if you try to satisfy with lust if you try to satisfy with sports no matter what you do no matter what praises that people heap on you down on the inside of the inside there's a hollowness and a hunger and a thirsting for that to be filled this is pre realization this goes on in your heart and in your life when the election and the purpose of election that god is calling you for a purpose the revelation of him living and creating his bride he's got to reach out to you and call you and find you he'll leave the 99 and he'll go after that one and what is he done in the spiritual realm he starts convicting you you start to get hungry you start feeling empty there's a painful desire inside of you you don't know what it is but that's an evidence that he's calling you now each of you individually can go back to your own life and and realize those desperate places that you were in you could have been a teenager you were convicted you were unhappy and you are thirsting and hungry blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled it was one of the evidences that god placed there for election walk through the process you're just fine and all of a sudden conviction comes on your life now you're not so happy now you're hungering and thirsting for relief you're hungering and thirsting everything starts to go awry everything starts to fall apart you don't fit the harder you try the more lonely you feel on the inside the more personality you pump up the more social positioning you get the more charm you try to expose the more in with the in-crowd you want to be in with the emptiness and the thirst and the hunger gets deeper and deeper and deeper you could rise up the positions in the church you could be a trustee you could be a deacon you could be a helper you could be a singer you could be a piano player you could do whatever that you want to do but until that thirst is filled it will continually call you to your elected position because he wants to settle it with you he's not worried about your transformation he's already has that planned out he's got every gospel he's going to preach to you he's got every sermon he's going to preach to you he's got every word that he's going to bring you he's got every song that's going to bring you in tears have you ever been driving by the road down by yourself and have a song come on and before you know it you're crying like a baby can't even help yourself all of a sudden it starts cracking at your heart and you think man you're going like this and you're looking you hope nobody sees you don't worry he sees you he's the one that's cracking that heart he's the one that's reaching in there he's the one you don't care where you are it's how he works he had to he's got to go through the process of contacting you whenever you're chosen he's got to contact you it's the evidence of your election is but the method by which he contacts you and he reaches out to you you know you can witness to somebody but you're not going to circumvent the process because he wants the question answered so we realize there's the thirst and then he says in the scriptures he says my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow he says the shepherd goes before the sheep and they know his voice and the voice of a stranger they will not follow there's something in the elected that know his voice remember we just listened in the message first he said there's something about that control tower something about that thirst something about those that have that seed in him that thirst that that seed that's in the inside calling out to be to be birthed there there's something about it and there's something about that person who's under conviction who's thirsting they have an identification and a built-in recognition of the voice of god my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow it doesn't matter how many much religion was presented to you it doesn't matter how much philosophy was presented to you it doesn't matter how many social programs and and all these things that are coming there's not one thing that that will respond to except for the voice of god it hears the voice it hears truth and that truth begins to set you free a little bit of word goes a long way when you're under conviction and you're thirsty and you're longing for righteousness each of you in your life you had an identity with the voice of god whether it was reading your bible and then as the gospel came forth you heard the voice of god in the last day there's something that you know about that voice a stranger you will not follow i know people that heard this message they believed especially they live and forgot it all but they'll slay you before you say anything against this message they know it's the voice of god they know it's the truth they know it's the word of god they can't help themselves it's part of their election this identity that we have in our heart for the voice of god it moves on us and when you hear it there's something about it you remember the first time you heard a tape there's something about the voice i'm okay a believer there's still something about that voice to a believer it resonates it's like music to you you can't explain it because that's part of election my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow there's no other voice that's going to attract them there's no other voice that's going to lead them it might catch their attention for a while but all of a sudden they're they're trying to get fed they're trying to eat this maybe they go from this church to that church maybe they go from this place to that place they're looking they're hungering they're they're thirsting they're they see things they're under conviction they can't be satisfied but when that voice comes there's an identity that takes place maybe not one bit of transformation yet maybe not one sin laid down the evidence of election comes before the results of election i want to make that clear he was working on you before you knew it he even planned your birth your grandparents your great-grandparents how that you were brought to where you were brought remember he has a purpose to create a bride that bride is going to be created and manifested by election so the elected person may not even ever come to the realization how that it was that god was choosing them but if you would reflect on in a moment and you would watch the hand of god in your life before your conversion because you couldn't have a conversion unless he chose you and elected you to have that conversion you didn't just walk up and say hey convert me i got nothing else going today no he was doing every little thought he knew where you had to be in order to hear he knew how to create the hunger in you so you were thirsting after god's word remember god has not left us he's still with us his purpose was to stand in the midst of his church having sons and daughters like himself a new creation and so there's this identity that we have with a voice so we we have a feeling of conviction we have a thirst which is a desire and then we have here blessed are they that hear my voice he who hath an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit's saying to the churches there he placed in us that hearing that hearing was there before you heard it's the process of the evidence of election that you possess these these unseen attributes that are working inside of you that you have no conscious of consciousness of because you're trying to view them through the flesh but he's not viewing them through the flesh he's viewing him through election in other words that he's working these things in you and let me just end with this fourth one that i wrote down here and it's called revelation and so we we we see that in in that that revelation is the ability to see you just see it it just opens up to you and so i could go back i could come through all the things that you've seen but one day you get the revelation you're lost that you're a sinner you see that he died for you and young people don't try to make it in on church teaching he still only has one provided place to meet man and that's under the shed blood you've got to know that all the history you have in your mind all the conviction you have all the thirst you had all the things that you heard are true all the things that brought you under one thing there's one thing that pays the price for that and that's the blood of the lamb you can't be a new creation cut and try to make over the old creation you've got to take the old man and put it under the shed blood you say well i still make mistakes praise god for the blood amen well we were yet sinners he died for us and if we'll confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive them he's still that kind of god but all of a sudden you see now look at all the things you've seen since your election you saw the church ages you saw the pillar of fire you saw malachi 4 5 you heard the voice of malachi 4 5. you heard the gospel you heard serpent seed and you believed it you saw the godhead you saw it do you understand that that sight was in you because it was an evidence of the election the first time that you saw something the first time you got your glimpse of god the first time you realized there was another realm another dimension another spiritual form not just church not just the church family not just religion not just growing up in it but one day you personally had an awakening consciousness and your eyes were open to the reality of god and you saw that there was a god these are evidences of your election that once you can settle that you can look back and say wait a minute i can remember how he chose me i can remember coming under conviction i can remember being hungry and empty on the inside i can remember hearing his voice i can remember seeing now i can say all right i get it i'm chosen i'm chosen to be transformed i'm elected to be transformed i'm elected to be molded i'm elected to work i'm elected to have god i can lay down the fact of my election i've settled it i've looked at it i can see his hand of choosing me in my life how that he did it it doesn't matter how satan delayed it it doesn't matter the battles that you've gone through you personally know that something was working in you when you weren't even aware of who it was or what it was it was an evidence of you being chosen i i i've seen it in my life i've seen people just sit there all bowed up they're not going to hear one thing they made up their mind before they walked through that door they got so much ear wax in their ears and they got corked them all up and they've shut their soul down and they're not going to let one thing happen to him but you know something that old conviction comes rolling in they don't even understand that the presence of the lord's there they don't want to feel it they don't want to touch it they don't want to be a part of it but they just know that they ain't right with god they know they're not in fellowship with god they know they're living outside of the presence of god and they know that they may have 80 years they may have a hundred years but one day they're going to have to meet that god and they don't even believe in them but there's something starts to happen and that old thirst comes it might start out as just being the desire to get rid of the conviction but it goes to work and it goes to working it will never stop those who are outside the kingdom of god that are elected they are going to be haunted with conviction until their surrender and if your heart condemns you god is greater than your heart that that and i i've watched them get thirsty and and they don't get down the road just a little way and they look over at the person that problem says what did he mean by that it works and then pretty soon you know what they heard as stopped up as they were they heard and then they see and one day the reality of their election comes to him and that's half of the sermon i wanted to preach this morning i wanted to move into the body more and standing in the gap and go through that but maybe by god's grace if he tarries i'll pick that up next sunday but if we're going to advance as a body if we're going to be fitted and joined together if if we're going to resume the position that he elected us for we've got to settle the question of our election not of the condition you're in he can fix the condition not of the sin that so easily besets you he can forgive the sin but answer look at yourself look at what you've been through look at how he called you look what worked in your life these are my ways of expressing it you might have your own ways of expressing it of how that it transformed in you and just take a moment and look at yourself look at how it is when you hear the truth you amen it's like you don't even want to aim in it and you're going it's just a here this is right you just can't help it because that seed is working its way out of that lily path that seed is pressing that elected seeds got a spot in the body it's got to take it's got gifts that are departed it's got things that's got to transpire in its life because he had a plan he had a body he had a bride he's creating and he's creating that bride by the elected this plan comes to pass through election and my heart's desire for every member is that you settle the question of your election look at the evidence in your own life of your election and when you're elected and you know you're elected then you can surrender to that election and let god take your lump of clay and start molding it he takes the clay all mankind lies before him and one lump of clay and the choosing's his and you say lord you've chosen me i'm in your hand how are you gonna mold me how are you can i i know i'm elected i know there's a purpose and by predestination i know that you're going to bring it to pass and so i know now that all things work together for a good of them who are called according his purpose and i can settle that question in my heart and the quicker that we do that individually the stronger we'll grow as a body and be about the father's business not just as individuals but of part of something part of a body members in particular but when the election question's there the membership in the body is there too and and we've gone into way too much individualism way too much non-participation and tell me that ain't the spirit in the land today it's the spirit of non-participation what do i have to do satan says to keep this body from rising to its potential how can i keep this invincible army still but she's going to rise up she is going to rise up she is called elected and chosen settle the question in your heart individually and then when you know you're chosen then you can report to duty and say lord whatever you have to do not my will but thy will be done children you're not too young to have god deal with you god bless you this morning we're going to baptize joseph this morning uh other mom boy i think bro john you'll help me do that i think where are you i don't see you there oh there you are how could i miss you anyway would you and your son get ready and come to the back and and i'll ask brother billy to come if you have to go this morning uh i had about another hour out of standing in the gap but i've preached myself under conviction so i've got to go digest a little bit of this myself tremendous book maybe you could get it next week and read through it and and uh tie it back to the sermon but god bless you i love you remember you're a part of something don't think you're not because you've been elected to be a part of the body god bless you brother billy where if you become musicians you could come too amen let's go ahead and stand and we'll have a word of prayer and those of you who need to be dismissed feel free to go and those who'd like your stay for the baptism where we put a little tent up here and we just i'm gonna see if that kind of helps provide some shade and keep us out of the sun and then we'll put four or five of them you notice there's no more trees amen because there's it's supposed to brook supposed to spring up in a barren land and water is supposed to come out of the desert so that's why it looks a little barren up there but one day if the lord carries and it's his will we'll have a beautiful place oh god bless you brother good to see you i couldn't quite recognize you but now i kind of got you there billy's brother lord richly bless all of you this morning i hope you spend a few moments this week just looking back in your life and meditating just a few moments on how he called you [Music] that you could just reflect back and say lord i know you chose me us pray together our gracious father this morning [Music] what a beautiful purchase price the body of christ and how you went out through life and sought your own and they didn't seek you you chose them you sought them no man seeketh the father but the father draws [Music] and or we could come back and find out though it may have been many years ago [Music] we could sit back and reflect of the loneliness the misery and the hunger the conviction that was in our lives [Music] how we heard that voice and how it resonated in our heart and how we started seeing things that we totally were blind to all of a sudden you opened them up and when we know that [Music] we were elected to be a body to be a member in a body to play a part in the body the mystical body of christ that we weren't called to be loners we weren't called just to sit on a seat somewhere and agree to a certain teaching or a certain doctrine but we're called to be lively stones spirit-filled about our father's business may that anchor so deep in our heart and father as we baptize this young man this morning lord he's come through this place in his heart [Music] where he's made the decision that he needs to be baptized and he needs to serve you and he wants to do what's right father as he fulfills the promises and the commandment of water baptism lord i pray that you fill him with your spirit and that you make him and mold him into the son of god that you so predestinated him to be and father that you'd place him in that body right where he can serve whether he be a commonly part a part with greater honor or lesser honor it doesn't even matter because the greatest watch we can look at the face of that watch and it may be studded with diamonds they may be gold-plated but if it isn't for that little main spring and that little spring the face of that watch is worthless and father no matter [Music] how a church is on the outside it's the inside of the believer's heart it's the movement of the spirit in the heart of every member that gives the church the life and father our desire is that the life of christ be our portion we asked it this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you is that our brother from serving there god bless you good to see you this morning lord bless you to just worship him a moment as we've prepared your [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] how [Music] oh [Music] here [Music] me [Music]

[Music] on me [Music] oh [Music] broken places [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh broken praises [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] my first song [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that was a beautiful setting on that day of pentecost the spirit of god coming down and in doing people with power and and as they began to preach people fell under conviction and they became hungry for what it was that those people had and as they began to explain the scripture to him their eyes became open and they received revelation and what a marvelous thing then they said what can i do how can i act upon this revelation how can i quench this thirst how can i relieve this conviction and what a beautiful answer and it starts in the second chapter of acts and the 37th verse says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this upward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls amen this morning we're here to baptize joseph we felt the stir of the lord in his heart and he wanted to be baptized and we're with glad and we know that the promise of the lord will be that he'll be sealed in and receive the holy spirit and the holy spirit's a tutor amen it teaches you and convicts you and guides you and shows you things and sometimes it'll take the vessel and completely tear it down but wouldn't you rather be in his hands than anybody else's hands amen so this for this reason our brother comes today amen my precious brother according to god's holy word to go into all the world and baptize them in the name of the father the son the holy ghost one name of these three offices was in the wonderful name of emmanuel with us and according to the word of god in the revelation of the godhead we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you let's all stand amen let's sing that song i have been blessed as our dismissal this morning amen [Music] when he walks among god all of his mercy and all of his [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music]
