[9:55] gathered in the presence of god i want
[9:57] to welcome everyone
[9:58] amen those that are online we welcome
[10:00] you to this morning as you invite me to
[10:02] mike
[10:02] for our song writing this morning god
[10:04] bless you
[10:10] good morning you know i appreciate about
[10:13] the word of god is
[10:15] it's so very precise every single word
[10:19] every specific phrase is specifically
[10:21] set up
[10:22] by the lord to make something
[10:26] very plain about himself we want to look
[10:28] at psalm 99 this morning
[10:31] you know there's a verse in there
[10:32] statement it's in psalm 99 verse 5
[10:36] and it's one of these words and it says
[10:38] exalt ye the lord our god
[10:41] and worship at his footstool
[10:44] for he is holy you know the footstool of
[10:48] the lord is only mentioned a handful of
[10:50] times in the scriptures
[10:52] you know he has a throne and he has a
[10:55] footstool
[10:57] you know the throne is the place where
[10:58] he sits
[11:00] but he has a footstool while he sits on
[11:02] that throne in isaiah 66
[11:04] 1 it says thus saith the lord
[11:07] the heaven is my throne and earth
[11:11] is my footstool you know and in matthew
[11:15] 5 jesus said but i say unto you
[11:17] swear not at all neither by heaven for
[11:20] it is god's throne
[11:22] nor by the earth for it is his footstool
[11:26] right you know what's also interesting
[11:29] about this
[11:30] is as we read here in psalm 99 it's also
[11:33] a place of worship
[11:35] so not only is it the earth but it's a
[11:38] place of worship in
[11:39] in psalm 132 7 david said this we will
[11:43] go into his tabernacles we will worship
[11:46] at his footstool and in first chronicles
[11:50] 28 2 when david was talking with all of
[11:52] his
[11:53] all of his rulers about his desire to
[11:55] build a temple
[11:56] he said hear me my brethren and my
[11:58] people for as for me
[12:00] i had in mine heart to build and house
[12:03] of rest for the ark of the covenant of
[12:05] the lord and for the footstool
[12:07] of our god and had made ready for the
[12:10] building so it's both
[12:12] the footstool is both the earth and a
[12:15] place of worship
[12:18] you know what is this footstool what is
[12:20] this earth
[12:21] you know that it speaks about this this
[12:23] this place of worship
[12:24] you know we're all familiar with the
[12:26] story in john 4
[12:27] of where jesus met the woman at the well
[12:31] it's one of my favorite stories in
[12:33] scripture
[12:35] she comes in contact with her seventh
[12:37] man
[12:38] you know and as he as she begins to
[12:40] realize who this
[12:42] is the first question out of her mouth
[12:45] is she wants to try to figure out what's
[12:46] the right way to worship
[12:49] she says you know my people say that you
[12:51] worship in this place in this way
[12:53] and this type of thing the jews say that
[12:55] we worship in this place in this type of
[12:56] thing
[12:58] you know and he says that worship isn't
[12:59] in either one of those places
[13:01] right he says he says in verse
[13:05] 23 of john 4 he says the hour cometh
[13:08] and now is when the true worshipers
[13:11] shall worship the father in spirit and
[13:13] in truth
[13:15] for the father seeketh such to worship
[13:17] him god is a
[13:18] spirit and they that worship him must
[13:22] worship him
[13:23] in spirit and in truth
[13:26] you know the true worshiper worships him
[13:28] in spirit and truth
[13:30] you know it's it's interesting that it's
[13:32] not a place
[13:33] physical place it's not a building right
[13:35] it's not
[13:36] a song service or an atmosphere that you
[13:39] put in a building or even a style of
[13:41] praise
[13:42] worship is a condition right where a
[13:46] true worshiper finds himself in
[13:48] it's where worship is the merger of the
[13:50] worshipper
[13:52] with the word right it says that
[13:55] in it says in ephesians it says the
[13:58] sword of the spirit
[13:59] is the word of god so spirit is the word
[14:02] and then in john 17 jesus says thy word
[14:04] is truth so
[14:05] truth is word so the true worshiper will
[14:08] worship him and spirit it in truth
[14:10] by the word right you know
[14:13] you think about that that if you think
[14:15] about what it is to really be a work
[14:17] true worshiper it's where your identity
[14:19] your thoughts your actions everything
[14:23] is completely taken over by him and the
[14:26] only
[14:26] image that you represent it's that place
[14:28] where if you've seen me
[14:30] you see the father right you know so
[14:33] it's
[14:34] a worshiper is where the earth this
[14:37] earth
[14:39] becomes the word where you lose your own
[14:41] life
[14:42] and you become his image a leaving
[14:44] living breathing
[14:46] continuous memorial of him
[14:49] his footstool right so
[14:52] how many of you would desire to be his
[14:54] footstool
[14:55] to be his place of worship on the earth
[14:59] right exalt ye the lord or exalty the
[15:01] lord our god and worship at his
[15:03] footstool
[15:04] for he is holy let's read psalm 99
[15:07] together
[15:09] the lord reigneth let your people
[15:12] tremble
[15:12] he sitteth between the cherubims let the
[15:15] earth be moved
[15:17] the lord is great in zion and he is high
[15:20] above all the people let them praise thy
[15:23] great and terrible name
[15:24] for it is holy the king's strength also
[15:28] loveth judgment
[15:29] thou dost establish equity thou execute
[15:32] his judgment and righteousness in jacob
[15:35] exalt ye the lord our god and worship at
[15:38] his footstool
[15:39] for he is holy moses and aaron among his
[15:42] priests
[15:43] and samuel among them that call upon his
[15:46] name
[15:47] they called upon the lord and he
[15:48] answered them
[15:50] he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar
[15:52] they kept his testimonies
[15:54] and the ordinance that he gave them thou
[15:57] answer is to him o lord our god
[15:59] thou was the god that forgave us them
[16:02] though thou took us
[16:03] vengeance on their inventions exalt the
[16:05] lord our god
[16:06] and worship at his holy hill for the

[45:45] if you knew us before the world ever was
[45:50] and you're the alph and the mega the
[45:52] beginning and the end
[45:55] certainly you could make provisions
[45:57] before we ever came to the time of need
[46:01] and that provision would be waiting for
[46:04] us
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] we were healed before we ever were sick
[46:12] and that healing was there waiting for
[46:14] us father

[46:27] people

[46:40] in
[46:41] we just asked for you presents this
[46:44] morning father

[46:57] heart of the believer today
[47:00] we ask these things in jesus precious
[47:02] and holy name we pray
[47:05] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[47:08] this morning
[47:13] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[47:15] and we want to just once again
[47:18] say that september 6
[47:22] we will be resuming our sunday evening
[47:25] services
[47:26] along with our foot washing service and
[47:30] and so we will just uh proceed
[47:33] forward starting on the 6th then
[47:38] uh this coming week you notice we've
[47:40] started to do a little bit of work on
[47:42] the property next door and
[47:44] uh this coming week we're gonna add some
[47:47] uh temporary paving
[47:50] along where the dirt is out there
[47:53] and so we'll add a little more parking
[47:56] for you so
[47:58] anyway we're working on a few things on
[48:00] your behalf as we are
[48:02] waiting for the final uh uh
[48:05] plat approval from the city so we would
[48:08] certainly like that
[48:10] do we have a baby dedication or anything
[48:12] this morning okay i'm not gonna sing so
[48:15] god bless you musicians so much enjoyed
[48:17] the singing this morning
[48:21] you know i'm going to do a little
[48:22] something this morning that we haven't
[48:25] maybe done very much of we've
[48:29] always played just a small portion of
[48:31] tape but
[48:32] this morning i'm going to play a little
[48:34] longer
[48:35] portion of tape this morning because
[48:40] i i honestly feel in my heart and and it
[48:43] came upon my heart and
[48:45] and and then i listen to the the message
[48:49] and many times i'll listen to a message
[48:52] and find
[48:52] certain parts in it that i want to
[48:55] emphasize and i feel the holy spirit's
[48:58] leading me to emphasize
[48:59] well i really felt led to
[49:02] that he just pressed upon me
[49:06] to play the whole portion
[49:10] and that's always difficult for me when
[49:12] that happens because i know that we have
[49:15] interpreters
[49:17] and the interpreters are trying to
[49:20] interpret i know many times people bring
[49:23] visitors to church and and
[49:26] they say well we'd like you know to have
[49:29] you hear our pastor
[49:31] or we would like um uh
[49:34] you know something from that standpoint
[49:37] something with
[49:38] people and i know a lot of people say
[49:39] well i can listen at home
[49:41] and and there's many different things
[49:45] that
[49:46] that come up again so every time i feel
[49:48] led to
[49:50] to do a certain i feel compelled
[49:53] believe me there's a lot of things that
[49:55] start popping up you know what i mean
[49:58] and and then i start finding myself
[50:01] trying to battle and and and come up
[50:04] with reasoning but you know what i
[50:05] thought
[50:06] my heart the most if god tells me to do
[50:09] it
[50:09] and i do it then god will be here to
[50:12] stand behind his word
[50:15] and this this message
[50:18] is that we're going to play
[50:22] is called god doesn't call man to
[50:24] judgment
[50:26] without warning first it's also been
[50:30] referred to as warning
[50:32] and then judgment but
[50:35] this there is such a tremendous
[50:39] understanding and teaching in this tape
[50:44] and remember that god's always hid
[50:47] in simplicity and so i'm just going to
[50:50] read just a few
[50:52] quotes pretty and and
[50:55] just kind of uh
[50:58] to to just say some of the things so
[51:01] that you could be listening to them
[51:03] so it's about an hour and if we could
[51:06] just focus for an
[51:08] hour just put yourself in the story
[51:11] listen to the word of god
[51:15] and and it's it's uh
[51:18] it's a tremendous thing and where we're
[51:20] going to start is in isaiah the 38th
[51:23] chapter and
[51:27] and this is the story of hezekiah and
[51:30] we're going to read from there and
[51:34] and these are just some of the
[51:36] statements that the prophet of god
[51:39] makes in uh this message that i
[51:43] i'd like us to be able to hear
[51:46] he says and that's the way it is with
[51:49] people
[51:51] we've all the body of christ
[51:54] has has got to be in their position
[51:59] in harmony and then we
[52:02] can look around and see what time
[52:06] of day it is
[52:09] then and
[52:13] then worlds are looking to see
[52:16] what it is see but we're
[52:20] but they're watching you
[52:23] and you've just a little hairspring
[52:26] mainspring or whatever
[52:28] you are you do the very best
[52:31] job you can at that
[52:35] and and i hope that when when we come to
[52:38] hear that
[52:38] portion that it strikes he says
[52:42] the world today is just like hezekiah
[52:45] was
[52:45] then it's been warned
[52:48] it's constantly being warned the church
[52:52] is being warned
[52:54] and now these things just don't happen
[52:56] by chance
[52:58] they've got something behind them
[53:02] now let me tell you what's going on just
[53:04] doesn't happen by chance
[53:06] it's got something going on behind it
[53:11] and and i sincerely believe
[53:14] that it is a warning that god is
[53:18] warning the church because men's
[53:21] thinking the decisions that they're
[53:24] making
[53:24] that this great pressure economically
[53:27] and let me tell you
[53:29] our government spent billions of dollars
[53:32] and sent lots of people money to
[53:35] postpone the effect
[53:39] of the economy but let me tell you
[53:42] that the effect is still there
[53:46] all they've done is pushed it down the
[53:49] road
[53:50] okay but the struggles and the hardships
[53:53] are coming
[53:57] i would like to tell you something else
[54:00] you know what i mean but you you don't
[54:04] you don't shut down thousands of
[54:06] businesses
[54:08] thousands of restaurants thousands of
[54:11] retail stores
[54:13] you don't cut travel in this country in
[54:16] half
[54:17] and then expect everybody to have
[54:19] something
[54:21] so i i you know all i can do
[54:24] is if i could tell you the wolves are
[54:27] coming
[54:29] the wolves are coming but you
[54:32] as an individual have to have your heart
[54:36] in the right place with god
[54:39] and this message is
[54:42] a message that reaches out to god's
[54:45] children
[54:46] and set tells them god has
[54:49] warned this nation over
[54:52] and over and over again and
[54:56] judgments are coming and you have
[54:59] a part to play you don't run from the
[55:03] judgments
[55:03] you have a part to play in the judgment
[55:07] and it's very important that each of us
[55:10] find our
[55:11] plot i know what we'd all like to do is
[55:14] go hide in the woods somewhere
[55:16] right you know you know can you imagine
[55:20] me coming up and saying well church i
[55:22] just feel that
[55:23] i'm going to take a couple years off and
[55:26] go out
[55:27] this san diego and stay with my mother
[55:30] and just fish on the ocean for two years
[55:33] and
[55:33] not do anything but go fishing for two
[55:37] years
[55:38] man that sounds good
[55:42] but that's just the same thing as
[55:44] burying your talent
[55:46] no we're soldiers amen we're here to be
[55:49] a soldier
[55:51] he makes this statement nineveh was a
[55:53] great fishing
[55:55] industry there and the people fished
[55:59] and they must have had a great
[56:02] sinful country there plenty of money
[56:06] and where money is plentiful
[56:09] the people are in a popular opinion
[56:13] of the day sin always
[56:16] sets in and violence
[56:22] i mean how greater a warning
[56:26] when you see a popular opinion come in
[56:30] the way that they're going
[56:33] and i'm not a politician i'm not here to
[56:36] try to get you to vote one way or the
[56:38] other that's not
[56:38] my job but my job is to tell you the
[56:41] gospel
[56:43] and we see the idea of this very
[56:46] scriptures itself
[56:47] says that god has put men in authority
[56:50] in law enforcement to carry out the
[56:53] judgments of god
[56:54] against the wicked and we find out that
[56:57] they want to
[56:58] eliminate that and and it becomes the
[57:02] popular opinion
[57:04] and wherever there's a popular opinion
[57:06] sin rises
[57:07] the murder rate rises the burglary rises
[57:10] violent climb rhine
[57:12] and violence comes in that is a warning
[57:16] that that is a warning it it
[57:19] it it is it is definitely
[57:23] speaking to certain things that are
[57:26] are transpiring and we can see that
[57:29] and that's always been the sign when you
[57:32] see these things coming
[57:34] know that the day of the lord is at hand
[57:37] and and we don't want to get dull on
[57:40] that he says
[57:41] so you know god's able to do great
[57:43] things
[57:44] if we'll just listen at him
[57:50] and that was a complaint that god always
[57:52] had is that the people became dull of
[57:54] hearing
[57:56] you know what i mean because in others
[57:58] we sit down and we listen to a tape and
[58:00] we say i heard that tape before
[58:02] i know what's in it and and we don't
[58:05] listen at
[58:06] it we don't say okay the holy spirit
[58:10] wants us to hear this this morning
[58:13] he wants us to take heed to it there's a
[58:15] message in it
[58:16] there's a message for the country
[58:19] there's a message for the body
[58:21] and there's a message for the individual
[58:24] i want to hear
[58:25] all three and he says
[58:29] see he make he'll make
[58:33] he'll make he'll make ways where there
[58:36] is no way he is the way
[58:39] and when the message is absolutely
[58:42] urgent
[58:43] as it is today god provides
[58:46] a way amen it's urgent
[58:51] and then this uh other statement i'd
[58:54] like to read because
[58:56] i uh this is one of the main things that
[58:59] i want us to
[59:00] understand this morning as we listen to
[59:03] this
[59:04] and this is something that's very
[59:07] important
[59:08] that you comprehend especially when
[59:12] there's going to be so much
[59:14] criticism against the messenger
[59:17] because of time
[59:20] but listen to this very carefully and
[59:22] then the brothers will start
[59:24] what we'll do is we'll just stand and
[59:27] we'll listen to the scripture
[59:29] and then we'll be seated he says a
[59:32] prophet foresees
[59:35] way off see
[59:39] the things that is coming
[59:42] he sees the cup of god's wrath full
[59:46] before it's filled
[59:50] see he can say thus saith the lord
[59:55] god will destroy this city except
[59:58] you repent why he's an eagle
[1:00:02] he rides way up in yonder see
[1:00:06] and he looks away off there and he sees
[1:00:10] that cup of breath poured out
[1:00:13] that's what the prophet's looking at
[1:00:16] he ain't looking at what's going on here
[1:00:20] he's looking yonder he says it's coming
[1:00:26] he can he can he can go
[1:00:29] so high until he can see that
[1:00:32] shade he says the world will be
[1:00:36] in dark darkness and gross darkness
[1:00:40] he's up high enough the sun's shining
[1:00:43] now
[1:00:46] but he sees that shade coming
[1:00:50] and he says what he's
[1:00:53] looking at it ain't here yet
[1:00:58] but it'll sure be here
[1:01:02] that's right it's going to be here
[1:01:05] gross darkness upon the people he knows
[1:01:09] it's coming years away
[1:01:12] yet he sees it
[1:01:17] amen that's why this
[1:01:20] message is a living
[1:01:23] message that's why we can play these
[1:01:27] tapes
[1:01:28] right now today and it's not
[1:01:31] oh i'd rather have live preaching or
[1:01:34] i'd like to have something what you're
[1:01:36] going to hear
[1:01:38] is what a prophet saw coming
[1:01:43] and i can say not only did he see it
[1:01:46] coming
[1:01:47] and we haven't recorded what he saw
[1:01:50] coming
[1:01:51] but that shade is finally upon us
[1:01:55] and there was a warning in it of a quick
[1:01:59] turn of repentance back to god
[1:02:03] and so i i believe with all my heart
[1:02:07] church i i i just can't get away from it
[1:02:10] you know i believe in the fivefold
[1:02:12] ministry brother branham explains the
[1:02:14] fivefold ministry
[1:02:16] but we received a
[1:02:19] message from god because
[1:02:22] god doesn't call man to judgment without
[1:02:26] warning him first
[1:02:28] and it it it it really
[1:02:32] should set in our heart that this
[1:02:34] message
[1:02:35] was a gift of god warning us
[1:02:38] that this world has turned away from god
[1:02:41] it's entered into a complete apostasy
[1:02:44] it no longer wants to retain god in
[1:02:48] its knowledge and what's waiting for
[1:02:50] them
[1:02:51] is judgment but
[1:02:54] there's something also waiting for us
[1:02:58] and he said every believer looks for the
[1:03:02] pending judgment
[1:03:03] and the escape
[1:03:07] please let this message teach your heart
[1:03:10] this morning
[1:03:11] i know it's hard for the interpreters i
[1:03:14] know maybe it's hard for
[1:03:17] a visitor this morning that might not
[1:03:20] understand
[1:03:22] the promises of malachi 4 5 and
[1:03:25] luke 17 30 but for us this morning this
[1:03:28] is life
[1:03:29] so let's stand together and open our
[1:03:31] bibles
[1:03:37] and listen to what the prophet of god
[1:03:39] begins to talk about your position
[1:03:42] your responsibility and the thing stay
[1:03:46] with
[1:03:46] it and follow it through if you have
[1:03:48] your cell phone
[1:03:49] and maybe you can find the message in
[1:03:52] french
[1:03:53] feel free to take your cell phones and
[1:03:56] find the message in french or
[1:03:58] spanish if you can read along uh just
[1:04:01] be very free to do that this morning
[1:04:04] and anyway as we turn into this
[1:04:08] isaiah the 38th chapter
[1:04:11] and uh and we'll listen as the
[1:04:15] as we hear the great uh
[1:04:19] word of god this morning so god bless
[1:04:21] you brothers if
[1:04:22] you would begin to pray sit back and
[1:04:25] enjoy the word of the lord
[1:04:27] and i just hope you have confidence in
[1:04:29] this morning that
[1:04:30] the lord's led me to do this god bless
[1:04:33] you
[1:04:39] now my uh sight falls upon a texture of
[1:04:44] isaiah isaiah 38.
[1:04:51] let's read over to isaiah
[1:04:54] isaiah 38
[1:04:57] in those days was hezekiah
[1:05:00] sick unto death and isaiah the prophet
[1:05:04] the son of amos came
[1:05:08] unto him and said unto him thus saith
[1:05:11] the lord
[1:05:13] set thine house in order for thou shall
[1:05:16] die
[1:05:16] and not live then hezekiah turned his
[1:05:20] face
[1:05:21] towards the wall and prayed unto the
[1:05:23] lord
[1:05:24] and said remember me oh lord i beseech
[1:05:28] thee
[1:05:28] i have walked before thee in truth and
[1:05:31] with a perfect heart
[1:05:33] and have done that which is good in thy
[1:05:35] sight
[1:05:37] and hezek hezekiah wept
[1:05:40] sore then came the word of the lord to
[1:05:44] isaiah saying
[1:05:46] go and say to hezekiah thus saith the
[1:05:48] lord
[1:05:49] the god of david thy father
[1:05:52] i've heard thy prayer i have seen thy
[1:05:55] tears
[1:05:56] behold i will add unto thy days 15 years
[1:06:01] may the lord add his blessings to this
[1:06:04] reading
[1:06:05] it's a very uh
[1:06:09] outstanding uh subject for a
[1:06:12] short message here i believe i want to
[1:06:15] call it
[1:06:16] god doesn't call man to judgment without
[1:06:20] first warning
[1:06:22] amen and we are we're we're it gets the
[1:06:25] the background or the platform of it
[1:06:28] here and this text tonight
[1:06:30] god warning man before bringing him
[1:06:33] to uh is death
[1:06:36] now every
[1:06:39] one has this we might say well this
[1:06:43] fellow died without a warning no no
[1:06:45] no god never you don't know what was
[1:06:47] that man's heart you don't know what's
[1:06:49] been going on in his life
[1:06:51] see god never brings any man to his
[1:06:53] death without first warning about it
[1:06:55] tell him
[1:06:55] it's something of preparation god
[1:06:58] is is sovereign and he he knocks at the
[1:07:02] heart of every man giving him the
[1:07:04] opportunity
[1:07:05] to come now he might ward away and turn
[1:07:08] it down and
[1:07:09] and shake his head to it and walk away
[1:07:10] so it's just a funny feeling
[1:07:12] i'll get over it but anyhow it was god
[1:07:16] god speaking to him amen and
[1:07:20] god never even brings judgment upon the
[1:07:22] earth without first giving the people a
[1:07:24] warning
[1:07:26] god never does nothing without declaring
[1:07:28] it first
[1:07:30] what he's going to do and he gives
[1:07:32] people a choice and you can
[1:07:34] you can do right or wrong that's his see
[1:07:36] god can never
[1:07:37] change his nature his program can never
[1:07:41] change
[1:07:42] from what he started with because he's
[1:07:44] infinite in his program
[1:07:46] and his ideas are all perfect so if he
[1:07:49] would change it that would show that
[1:07:51] he'd learn more so being infinite he
[1:07:53] cannot learn more his
[1:07:55] his first his first decision is always
[1:07:58] perfect and there's nothing can ever
[1:08:00] change it then
[1:08:02] god before a man ever was put uh
[1:08:05] had a chance to do wrong god put him on
[1:08:08] the basis to where he could accept
[1:08:10] our deny he could receive or
[1:08:14] or not say by the way if that minister
[1:08:16] in here brother
[1:08:17] baker uh i believe was on the
[1:08:20] the interviews the other day i've got
[1:08:23] these questions that he had
[1:08:24] rolled out for me on the serpent seed i
[1:08:26] got him a laying
[1:08:28] back here now if he's sure why
[1:08:31] well i don't see him anywhere right at
[1:08:33] the present time but it sure he and his
[1:08:35] wife
[1:08:35] a very fine man and a woman
[1:08:39] but they they couldn't understand a few
[1:08:41] things about
[1:08:42] the teaching of the serpent seed how
[1:08:45] that
[1:08:45] that some questions about what i'd said
[1:08:48] in
[1:08:48] sermons beyond that and and talking
[1:08:51] about the
[1:08:52] the impregnation and so forth but uh uh
[1:08:56] then it's just like a a brother a fine
[1:08:59] man just a christian for a couple years
[1:09:01] or two
[1:09:01] but just didn't understand you see it's
[1:09:04] hard if you don't you have to depend on
[1:09:07] the holy spirit because this bible is
[1:09:09] rotten riddles
[1:09:10] you just can't sit down and read like a
[1:09:12] newspaper it's hid
[1:09:14] yes sir how would you ever justify god
[1:09:16] when he
[1:09:17] told moses uh up there
[1:09:20] said uh now don't you make any engraving
[1:09:23] images in his commandments
[1:09:24] don't you make anything like heaven any
[1:09:26] any angel or anything else don't make
[1:09:28] any engraving images
[1:09:29] and yet on the same day told him to mold
[1:09:32] to
[1:09:33] angels out of brass and put them right
[1:09:35] at the mercy seat
[1:09:36] where mercy's at you have to know god in
[1:09:39] his nature
[1:09:40] before you can understand his word he he
[1:09:44] he has a key to that word himself and he
[1:09:46] he's the only one
[1:09:48] can handle it open it and so he's the
[1:09:51] one has to reveal it
[1:09:53] and now we find out that is
[1:09:57] nature wash here that always to warn a
[1:09:59] man
[1:10:01] before judgment the warning nation
[1:10:04] before
[1:10:04] judgment and so forth he always gives
[1:10:06] his warning
[1:10:07] a reminder to we
[1:10:10] of a responsibility we are
[1:10:14] responsible and god is punisher on the
[1:10:18] earth for
[1:10:19] a reason and that reason that he is
[1:10:22] punisher for
[1:10:23] we are responsible to him for that
[1:10:26] reason
[1:10:27] you should go to him and find out what
[1:10:29] he wants you to do
[1:10:31] if you don't if you went to work for a
[1:10:33] man he'd give you a job on a ranch or
[1:10:35] something other than you just went out
[1:10:36] to the barn
[1:10:38] and just sit down out there and say well
[1:10:40] see you must go
[1:10:41] ask him what he wants you to do and then
[1:10:44] do it
[1:10:45] if you're working for a man find out
[1:10:46] what your duties is and then if our
[1:10:48] life is on the the earth here then we
[1:10:51] should go to the one who punisher
[1:10:54] lord what would you have me do what what
[1:10:57] must i do why am i here
[1:10:59] if it's to be a housewife dishwasher if
[1:11:02] it's to be whatever god wants you to do
[1:11:04] then you do that the very
[1:11:05] best that you know how to do it no
[1:11:07] matter how little
[1:11:10] no matter how little it is you must do
[1:11:12] it you say well
[1:11:13] the trouble of it is each one of us
[1:11:15] wants to do the next man's job we all
[1:11:18] want to pack the ball as we say you see
[1:11:20] like this watch here
[1:11:22] now every little movement in there has
[1:11:25] its place
[1:11:27] now every part of it can't be the hands
[1:11:30] now i only look at the hand to see what
[1:11:31] time it is
[1:11:33] but if one of them little wheels in
[1:11:34] there gets out of order
[1:11:36] that won't keep the right time that's
[1:11:39] the way it is with people
[1:11:41] we've all the body of christ has got to
[1:11:44] be
[1:11:44] in their position and harmony see
[1:11:47] and then we can look around and see what
[1:11:50] time of day it is see
[1:11:51] then the world's looking to see what it
[1:11:53] is
[1:11:54] see but they're watching you and if
[1:11:57] you're just a little hairspring
[1:11:58] mainspring
[1:11:59] or whatever you are you do the very best
[1:12:03] job you can at that
[1:12:05] now because we have a responsibility
[1:12:08] that we've got to answer to god
[1:12:10] someday for every man that come on to
[1:12:12] face the earth
[1:12:14] has to answer to god for our
[1:12:15] responsibility and to many of us
[1:12:18] a stewardship we have to answer for
[1:12:21] we this responsibility is a stewardship
[1:12:23] that's been committed to us by god
[1:12:25] i don't care what it is as i said a few
[1:12:28] moments ago a housewife then be a
[1:12:30] genuine housewife that's right if it's
[1:12:33] to be a farmer be a genuine farmer
[1:12:36] whatever it is that god has put you to
[1:12:38] do you got a stewardship to that you've
[1:12:40] got to answer to god for because
[1:12:42] it takes all these things to do it
[1:12:44] hezekiah
[1:12:46] was told to make ready to get ready
[1:12:49] because
[1:12:50] that he had to meet his maker
[1:12:53] hezekiah was a king and a great man
[1:12:57] do you notice his plea here lord i
[1:12:58] beseech you to consider me
[1:13:01] i've walked before you with a perfect
[1:13:03] heart
[1:13:04] what a testimony that is to to us today
[1:13:07] this should be
[1:13:08] a man that walks before god even
[1:13:12] death was pronounced upon the man and
[1:13:14] yet god changed his mind about him
[1:13:17] because
[1:13:18] hezekiah wanted to do something and god
[1:13:21] said he would give us the desires of our
[1:13:23] heart
[1:13:23] and hezekiah's time had come and he got
[1:13:26] a cancer on him or something other and
[1:13:28] they call it a bar on that day but we
[1:13:30] know borah don't regularly kill you they
[1:13:32] just get well
[1:13:33] but it's perhaps a cancer and it opened
[1:13:36] up like a boil and
[1:13:37] and god told isaiah said go up there and
[1:13:40] tell him that
[1:13:40] he's going to die and hezekiah had
[1:13:43] something he wanted to do yet he yet
[1:13:45] yet when you plead anything to god you
[1:13:47] got to be a reason for it
[1:13:49] it's just like this scripture that is so
[1:13:51] often referred to if you say to this
[1:13:53] mountain be moved and don't
[1:13:54] doubt but believe that what you've said
[1:13:56] will come to pass you can have what you
[1:13:58] said
[1:13:59] now that's all together controlled on
[1:14:01] motive and objective
[1:14:03] thing or it won't happen so you just
[1:14:06] can't go out here that's where
[1:14:07] many of us makes uh many mistakes is
[1:14:10] going on saying i'll show you i got
[1:14:11] faith to do this
[1:14:13] now you're wrong to begin with god don't
[1:14:15] give you gifts just to play with it
[1:14:18] as i was saying a while ago they don't
[1:14:19] show you visions just to play with
[1:14:21] that's nothing to play with that's
[1:14:23] sacred just
[1:14:24] use it in as the lord will let you be a
[1:14:27] prisoner
[1:14:28] to him no matter how much you want to
[1:14:29] tell that guy is wrong and
[1:14:31] what this the other you hold still to
[1:14:33] god says so
[1:14:34] then when god says so then you can come
[1:14:36] with thus saith the lord and tell that
[1:14:38] just forget about him the the world
[1:14:42] today just like hezekiah was then
[1:14:45] it's been warned it's constantly being
[1:14:49] warned the church is being warned
[1:14:51] and now these things just don't happen
[1:14:53] by uh by a chance
[1:14:56] they've all got something behind him now
[1:15:00] hezekiah being sick having this bar that
[1:15:03] wasn't by chance
[1:15:04] god sent isaiah up there and told him to
[1:15:07] set his house in order now because
[1:15:09] he's going to die in hezekiah wept and
[1:15:12] told god i
[1:15:13] walk before the perfect heart and i i
[1:15:16] pray you spare my life for a cause
[1:15:19] a good cause the cause of god god told
[1:15:21] the prophet said go back and tell him
[1:15:23] now isn't that strange hezekiah was the
[1:15:25] greatest man in the land
[1:15:28] hezekiah was a king and a godly man
[1:15:32] he was a real man if he could plead that
[1:15:35] before god and god didn't rebuke him far
[1:15:38] i've walked before you with a perfect
[1:15:39] heart
[1:15:41] now that's a saying a whole lot and god
[1:15:44] never said no hezekiah you didn't do it
[1:15:46] but he admitted he did do it and he said
[1:15:48] i'm going to
[1:15:48] i'm going to spare your life a little
[1:15:50] longer see i'm going to give you a
[1:15:52] request
[1:15:53] see because he had been a just man he
[1:15:56] had been a
[1:15:56] a real servant to christ and then we
[1:15:59] feel that we have a right to ask
[1:16:01] something if if our objective is right
[1:16:03] and then our motive to it now we see
[1:16:06] today
[1:16:07] that for the past many years
[1:16:11] i'd say for the past 15 to more years
[1:16:15] that constantly there's been a warning
[1:16:17] out across the nation repent
[1:16:20] our parish you notice
[1:16:23] i was talking today to the wife just uh
[1:16:26] early this morning
[1:16:28] and i uh early breakfast we were setting
[1:16:30] a table talking before i left
[1:16:32] i said wife uh she's talking about
[1:16:36] billy graham and about his wife is how
[1:16:39] common and everything they tried to live
[1:16:41] i said that
[1:16:43] is a real servant when he tries not when
[1:16:45] he man maybe he makes two or three
[1:16:47] million a year
[1:16:48] out in his campaigns but he doesn't
[1:16:50] receive it his foundation
[1:16:52] takes it placing it back into the work
[1:16:54] and the broadcast and so forth and billy
[1:16:56] gets
[1:16:56] about 25 000 years she said how would he
[1:16:59] ever spend 25 000 here i said
[1:17:01] he he takes just what he has to have
[1:17:03] that's all he's got a home to pay for
[1:17:06] everything that went on i said i've got
[1:17:08] lots of respects for billy graham
[1:17:10] i said because he has a message and that
[1:17:13] message is repentance
[1:17:15] and i i'll tell you there's nobody and i
[1:17:18] know of
[1:17:19] in the lands today that god is used with
[1:17:21] that message like billy graham
[1:17:23] oh he's got a down pat he just stands
[1:17:26] there and i mean he calls them
[1:17:28] politicians and church members to your
[1:17:29] repentance but that's as far as he goes
[1:17:32] and here comes
[1:17:33] uh brother oral roberts another great
[1:17:36] servant of the lord
[1:17:37] and there's nobody that comes out there
[1:17:39] and compared with oral roberts that
[1:17:41] bulldog grip of if uh just casting out
[1:17:44] evil spirits and
[1:17:46] calling the name of the lord and and
[1:17:48] little sensations and so forth
[1:17:50] about divine healing that's exactly
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:54] there is a messenger to the pentecost
[1:17:56] there is a messenger to the church
[1:17:58] denominational world see
[1:18:00] and the coal world and then look around
[1:18:02] at our own little humble ministry
[1:18:04] standing jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:18:07] today and forever you see
[1:18:09] what's that doing calling that bride
[1:18:11] group you see
[1:18:12] hallelujah it calls from both those
[1:18:16] groups
[1:18:16] it's taking a wheel out of the wheel you
[1:18:18] see what i mean
[1:18:20] and then god confirms that message that
[1:18:22] billy graham preaches
[1:18:23] god heals the sick by oral robert's
[1:18:26] prayers
[1:18:27] and god produces the things that jesus
[1:18:29] proved that jesus christ is the same
[1:18:31] yesterday and forever
[1:18:32] and it's calling those things it's
[1:18:34] messages of the
[1:18:36] hour and each one of those messages is
[1:18:39] calling repent
[1:18:40] or perish that's right
[1:18:44] repent or perish there's no hopes it's
[1:18:47] all gone
[1:18:49] world's warned of his coming each one of
[1:18:52] the messages
[1:18:52] speaks and warns of the coming of the
[1:18:55] lord jesus
[1:18:56] both through the church denial remember
[1:18:59] god's always in threes
[1:19:01] like father son and holy ghost and
[1:19:02] justification bap and sanctification
[1:19:04] baptism holy ghost so forth these and
[1:19:06] threes
[1:19:07] now god is that message of repentance to
[1:19:09] the church nominal
[1:19:11] god's in that message of divine healing
[1:19:13] to the church pentecostal
[1:19:15] god's in the message to the bride amen
[1:19:18] so we find out that
[1:19:19] all of them calling
[1:19:22] one to this this to that and that's that
[1:19:24] god calling the church out of the world
[1:19:27] the calling the church in the
[1:19:30] nominal church into pentecost and
[1:19:32] calling the bride out of pentecost
[1:19:35] see like luther wesley
[1:19:38] and now see it says oh perfectly typed
[1:19:42] up
[1:19:42] and there's no mistake about it i've hid
[1:19:45] all around the ends of it and sides of
[1:19:46] it inside and outside of it
[1:19:48] and showed it by the scripture and the
[1:19:50] chronology of it till we know that it's
[1:19:52] absolutely the truth
[1:19:55] there's no mistake sunday i hope that
[1:19:58] god
[1:19:58] sinks it so deep that you'll never be
[1:20:01] able to get away from it sing
[1:20:03] now god giving warning
[1:20:07] prepare for a judgment
[1:20:11] the atomic bombs are in the hangars
[1:20:13] everything's setting ready
[1:20:15] and god before he can let this thing
[1:20:17] happen he makes a call
[1:20:20] down to like he did in sodom come out of
[1:20:22] it get ready there's something going to
[1:20:25] happen
[1:20:26] like in the days of noah before
[1:20:29] god sent the waters to destroy the world
[1:20:33] in the great andaluvian world that had
[1:20:35] come off into sin as
[1:20:37] jesus clearly said that it was a day
[1:20:40] just like this as it was in the days of
[1:20:44] noah
[1:20:44] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:20:47] of man
[1:20:48] how that uh the women on the rampage and
[1:20:52] and marrying and giving in marriage and
[1:20:54] and the
[1:20:55] great scientific achievements and the
[1:20:58] smart educated going into the
[1:21:00] intellectual sides
[1:21:01] and the little humble flock setting off
[1:21:03] to one side waiting
[1:21:05] the pending judgment and the escape and
[1:21:08] before
[1:21:09] god set that judgment he set a prophet
[1:21:15] just like you did to hezekiah said get
[1:21:17] ready
[1:21:18] for the judgments are ready to fall and
[1:21:21] he made
[1:21:22] the people ready for the time
[1:21:25] noah made the people ready
[1:21:29] and it was a call of mercy before
[1:21:32] judgment nineveh was made to know
[1:21:35] before their time god looked down to
[1:21:38] nineveh and he said
[1:21:39] i'm i'm just sick and tired of these
[1:21:43] things
[1:21:44] i i understand that if the though that
[1:21:48] great
[1:21:48] heathen gentile world their city
[1:21:51] as it was in them days it judged them by
[1:21:53] sitting outside nations now
[1:21:56] after the population spread the way it
[1:21:58] has he said that great cities give over
[1:22:00] all together to sin and god
[1:22:04] before he would send judgment he
[1:22:07] sent a warning message
[1:22:11] come out of it get it right watch the
[1:22:14] prophet never
[1:22:15] said nothing but but to get
[1:22:19] said within 40 days this city
[1:22:22] will be destroyed and all
[1:22:25] how sometimes it's hard
[1:22:29] to do such things is that to tell people
[1:22:31] if the prophet don't watch
[1:22:33] he'll get in trouble because he'll kind
[1:22:35] of go off to one side try to make it
[1:22:37] easier
[1:22:38] compromise a little bit here in a little
[1:22:39] bit there but the real
[1:22:41] prophets got the order from god should
[1:22:44] never compromise
[1:22:45] nothing he should absolutely lay it
[1:22:49] right on the line
[1:22:50] that's the reason he used the spirit of
[1:22:52] elijah so much see because
[1:22:54] at that spirit always carried out his
[1:22:57] orders you see
[1:22:58] it brought his orders just exactly what
[1:23:00] it was and always a come back to the
[1:23:02] word
[1:23:03] i think always or bring him back to the
[1:23:06] word
[1:23:07] now we find nineveh in
[1:23:10] sin and the prophet was heston because
[1:23:13] it was a gentile worlds he is a gentile
[1:23:15] nation
[1:23:16] a gentile people not his own it wasn't
[1:23:19] hebrews
[1:23:20] they were gentiles a great uh ship
[1:23:23] commercial
[1:23:23] sea port that nineveh was great
[1:23:27] fishing uh industrial there the people
[1:23:30] fished and and the they had must have
[1:23:33] had a great
[1:23:34] sinful country there plenty of money and
[1:23:36] and more
[1:23:37] money is plentiful and people are in the
[1:23:39] popular opinion of the day
[1:23:41] sin always sets in and violence god was
[1:23:44] tired of it
[1:23:46] so he had a prophet in the land so he
[1:23:49] said to his prophet
[1:23:50] go down there to nineveh and cry out and
[1:23:52] say within 40 days the
[1:23:54] city is going to be destroyed now
[1:23:57] jonah thought now you know i might get
[1:24:00] in a little trouble
[1:24:01] so he wanted to be more sure so he
[1:24:03] thought he'd take a little vacation
[1:24:05] and go down to tarshish and we found out
[1:24:08] that the there's just 40 days left
[1:24:12] see so the message is urgent the time is
[1:24:16] at hand
[1:24:18] don't play around with other things and
[1:24:20] get a bachelor of art degree and
[1:24:23] find out something the hour is at hand
[1:24:26] so it's a matter of people today we're
[1:24:28] trying to
[1:24:29] build up big schools and have big things
[1:24:32] like that when
[1:24:33] mercy why if we preach the coming of the
[1:24:36] lord what do we need we're schools
[1:24:38] we need repentance towards god amen
[1:24:42] like hudson taylor said to the young
[1:24:44] missionary
[1:24:45] he said a young chinese boy come to him
[1:24:47] and said mr taylor
[1:24:49] said the lord jesus says fill me with
[1:24:51] his spirit
[1:24:52] said i'm so happy said shall i take 10
[1:24:56] years now
[1:24:56] and get my degrees and so forth he said
[1:24:59] son
[1:25:00] don't wait for degrees if the candle's
[1:25:03] lit
[1:25:03] go tell it go tell it don't wait for
[1:25:07] degrees
[1:25:08] oh you'll be half burnt out before you
[1:25:10] get on with your degrees
[1:25:12] that's when it's lit if you don't know
[1:25:14] nothing else just tell how i got lit
[1:25:16] just don't try to take somebody else's
[1:25:18] place or something place where you know
[1:25:19] let's tell what you know to be the truth
[1:25:21] this is the way it come on me and this
[1:25:22] is how i feel about it that's
[1:25:24] if you don't know any more than that say
[1:25:25] that let's go
[1:25:28] the message is urgent the time is at
[1:25:30] hand
[1:25:32] and what if isaiah and say well now i'll
[1:25:33] wait and see how he gets along with that
[1:25:34] barrel first you see see i
[1:25:36] i see god totally go up here and tell
[1:25:38] him right now
[1:25:41] and he told jonah to go oh my
[1:25:45] and money got out there in that ocean
[1:25:47] and that deep sea and
[1:25:49] and the ship got stalled in a storm
[1:25:53] that harshed up the sails and turned
[1:25:54] around around they wonder what the world
[1:25:56] was the matter out there
[1:25:57] but they couldn't make out looked like
[1:25:59] the thing getting waterlogged
[1:26:01] and every man calling on his god and
[1:26:03] first thing you know jonah was on his
[1:26:05] vacation so
[1:26:06] he thought he might as well sleep he
[1:26:08] must went out in the book head of the
[1:26:09] ship and
[1:26:10] laying up there his feet propped up
[1:26:12] asleep
[1:26:13] and he said awake old slugger and call
[1:26:15] upon your god
[1:26:17] and jonah knew what was wrong
[1:26:21] so does every man know
[1:26:24] what's wrong today hey and he said
[1:26:27] it's all my fault take me and buy my
[1:26:30] hands and throw me out in the sea and
[1:26:32] then this trouble i let up
[1:26:34] and they were kind of a gentleman like
[1:26:36] bunch of fellas and they didn't want to
[1:26:38] do that but
[1:26:39] they found out he was a prophet and
[1:26:41] knowed what he was talking about he said
[1:26:42] i thought i'd take my vacation first but
[1:26:45] but the lord don't want me to take this
[1:26:47] vacation
[1:26:48] i got to get down there i got a job to
[1:26:50] do i thought i'd rest up a little bit
[1:26:51] before it went but
[1:26:52] i gotta go the the message is urgent i
[1:26:55] got to get there
[1:26:56] i'd imagine when that certain prepared
[1:26:58] fish
[1:26:59] uh got uh jonah down in his stomach he'd
[1:27:02] done about face and throat water all
[1:27:04] over the country and tuck out for an end
[1:27:06] of as hard as he could go
[1:27:08] god was taking that message over there
[1:27:11] and that
[1:27:11] certain prepared fish and he took out
[1:27:14] for nineveh just as hard as he could go
[1:27:17] because he he had the messenger board
[1:27:20] and
[1:27:20] he had to get him over there he took the
[1:27:22] wrong but god had provided a ship
[1:27:24] for him so
[1:27:25] you know god's able to do great things
[1:27:27] if we're just
[1:27:28] listening and see he'll make he'll make
[1:27:30] ways where there is no
[1:27:32] way he is the way
[1:27:35] and when the message is absolutely
[1:27:37] urgent as it is today god
[1:27:39] provides a way we notice again when
[1:27:43] amos i preached on this fellow amos if
[1:27:46] you'd like to read the story sometimes
[1:27:47] it's great
[1:27:48] read the story of amos first a chapter
[1:27:51] of amos
[1:27:52] he's another type of the the warnings
[1:27:55] before judgment strikes sin now
[1:27:59] um the city that he was uh going to
[1:28:02] warn against over there was a bunch of
[1:28:04] jews that
[1:28:05] they all got kindly off of the beaten
[1:28:08] line
[1:28:09] and become a great tourist center and
[1:28:12] i imagine as i give the illustration
[1:28:14] that morning speaking on him
[1:28:16] that when his ball head come up over the
[1:28:18] top of the hill his little eyes narrow
[1:28:20] it as he looked down
[1:28:21] seeing the sin of that great nation
[1:28:25] and people uh his white beard as he
[1:28:28] fingered it like that my what a thing
[1:28:31] but
[1:28:32] nobody knows where he come from nobody
[1:28:35] knows those prophets they just rise up
[1:28:37] from somewhere and go
[1:28:38] the same way but he went into the city
[1:28:42] with
[1:28:42] thus saith the lord repent or
[1:28:46] perish or god will destroy this nation
[1:28:50] he'll he'll
[1:28:51] wipe this place off of the earth you've
[1:28:53] made an agreement with your enemy
[1:28:55] and you're you're at peace you think
[1:28:57] with your enemy but all the time the
[1:28:59] assyrians are
[1:29:00] are building up out there you can't walk
[1:29:03] to the other unless you'd be agreed
[1:29:04] that's all
[1:29:06] so always god wants us to separate
[1:29:08] ourselves he wants us to come out from
[1:29:10] the world
[1:29:11] not try to live with the world and god
[1:29:12] too not try to fascinate the world
[1:29:14] after god you have to live for one or
[1:29:17] the other you have to believe
[1:29:18] one or the other now we find out
[1:29:22] that this amos he certainly predicted a
[1:29:26] judgment upon this people except they
[1:29:29] repented
[1:29:30] and mine so
[1:29:34] so well does it fit our day i think this
[1:29:38] great
[1:29:38] city as looking back to this again the
[1:29:41] great city down there how that is all
[1:29:43] give over and
[1:29:44] and a great uh an economy they had of
[1:29:48] everything prosperous and they thought
[1:29:50] they were just exactly
[1:29:52] in the will of the lord because they
[1:29:53] were prospering
[1:29:55] but they found out that god is not
[1:29:59] always the author of prosperity
[1:30:02] no god sometimes when prosperity
[1:30:06] strikes the church usually gets away
[1:30:08] from him
[1:30:09] you know god spoke of israel one time so
[1:30:11] they found your blood in the field and
[1:30:12] washed you up and brought you in to be
[1:30:15] his own child and then when he got big
[1:30:16] and a beautiful young woman
[1:30:18] you played the part of he said you
[1:30:20] you just give yourself to every passer
[1:30:22] by
[1:30:23] see but when you were poor and needy
[1:30:27] when you had need you serve me but when
[1:30:29] i blessed you and gave you plenty then
[1:30:31] you went away from me
[1:30:33] and it's just about proved that way oh
[1:30:36] my now we find out that this prophet
[1:30:39] really struck down on that nation
[1:30:43] this amos he's just a plow boy
[1:30:46] but we find out that when he did
[1:30:49] struck down and told him what it would
[1:30:51] be
[1:30:53] and told him that they didn't get right
[1:30:55] with god that the
[1:30:56] enemy that they had taken in partnership
[1:30:59] would be the very one that destroyed
[1:31:01] them
[1:31:02] now we find out that our proud america
[1:31:06] is not going to escape the wrath of god
[1:31:09] as i spoke one day since i've been here
[1:31:12] i'm sure it was your
[1:31:14] uh of the everything at the end
[1:31:17] you know i can't see nothing to build to
[1:31:21] you can't build a politics it's gone
[1:31:25] you you can't build uh to uh
[1:31:29] social life because it's so demoralized
[1:31:32] there's
[1:31:33] there's nothing that you can build to
[1:31:34] there and uh
[1:31:36] you can't put no hopes to nothing how
[1:31:39] about the church
[1:31:40] well you can't deal with the church it's
[1:31:42] so firmly gone there's nothing left
[1:31:45] they've done sold out their birthrights
[1:31:47] for a mess of potting
[1:31:49] and they're just waiting judgment the
[1:31:51] holy spirit has crossed this
[1:31:53] nation showing his signs and wonders
[1:31:55] they continually spurn his grace
[1:31:58] he vindicates himself and proves by his
[1:32:01] great
[1:32:02] a vindication that he's a word of god
[1:32:05] manifested in this day
[1:32:07] and they still turn it down there's
[1:32:10] nothing left now
[1:32:11] you just can't always do that to god see
[1:32:15] all right we find out the first he sends
[1:32:19] his prophets with warning he doesn't
[1:32:22] change his way his method of doing
[1:32:24] things
[1:32:25] he does not always strike when he warns
[1:32:30] i want you to watch this quotation god
[1:32:33] gives a warning but he don't always
[1:32:34] strike the same time he warns
[1:32:37] did you notice that amen and then when
[1:32:40] he doesn't strike when he sends a
[1:32:41] warning
[1:32:42] then the prophet is mocked
[1:32:45] you didn't have it you told a lie
[1:32:48] amen you wasn't right
[1:32:52] that this same thing might have been
[1:32:54] said to isaiah
[1:32:56] what do you think that man thought when
[1:32:58] he went up there and prophesied
[1:33:00] the king was going to die then come back
[1:33:02] down and say no he's going to live
[1:33:03] what about jonah going through the
[1:33:04] streets saying oh this city is going to
[1:33:07] be destroyed
[1:33:08] within so many days 40 days and then god
[1:33:11] didn't do it
[1:33:12] see you have to watch god don't always
[1:33:15] strikes when he warns
[1:33:17] but he uh here's one thing then the
[1:33:20] prophet is mocked but
[1:33:22] if he is a vindicated prophet
[1:33:27] with the word of the lord see
[1:33:30] signs of god vindicated as god
[1:33:33] said the prophet would be vindicated
[1:33:35] which these men were see
[1:33:37] his word is not his but it's
[1:33:40] god's and it will come to pass
[1:33:44] it's got to come to pass if it's god's
[1:33:47] word only one thing can stop it that's a
[1:33:49] quick repentance
[1:33:51] notice amos he he lived to see his
[1:33:55] prophecy
[1:33:56] but when amos spoke of that city how it
[1:33:59] was going to happen how god was going to
[1:34:01] cause the syrians come in and take them
[1:34:02] over and so forth
[1:34:03] like that how their own corruption would
[1:34:05] eat them up well i believe
[1:34:07] if it's right now i'm looking down here
[1:34:09] upon the scripture
[1:34:10] and if i've got this counted right it's
[1:34:12] around about 50 years
[1:34:15] after amos prophesied and now what do
[1:34:17] you think a whole generation passed
[1:34:20] before amos's prophecy come to pass
[1:34:24] but if you'll read over here it tells
[1:34:27] you
[1:34:28] and it happened just exactly word by
[1:34:30] word what he's saying
[1:34:33] amen john saw the book of revelations
[1:34:37] it never happened in his day but we see
[1:34:40] it coming to pass just exactly
[1:34:42] daniel prophesied of the day of his day
[1:34:45] and all down through
[1:34:46] he never lived to see it he said go your
[1:34:48] way daniel shut up
[1:34:50] the book and close the book but you'll
[1:34:52] sleep in your life but at that day
[1:34:54] you'll stand
[1:34:55] see now i see you god always god strikes
[1:34:59] as soon as he prophesies
[1:35:01] amos prophecy as i said was 50 years
[1:35:04] later
[1:35:04] it come to pass but it did come to pass
[1:35:07] that the prophet
[1:35:09] is uh is a of the bible
[1:35:12] a real genuine prophet is
[1:35:16] a special uh a person not a specialty
[1:35:19] any different from anybody else
[1:35:21] but he's got a special job see
[1:35:24] in having a special commission he's got
[1:35:27] to be special
[1:35:28] a little out of the way from the others
[1:35:31] in order to do that
[1:35:33] it's just like god likes his prophets to
[1:35:35] be an eagle
[1:35:37] now eagle is a special bird he's just a
[1:35:39] bird
[1:35:40] but he's a special bird and he can fly
[1:35:43] higher than other birds
[1:35:44] he can see farther than other birds and
[1:35:46] now in order to go higher
[1:35:48] he's got to be built so he can go higher
[1:35:51] and what good would it do
[1:35:52] to go up there unless he could see what
[1:35:53] he was doing that you got up there see
[1:35:55] so it has to be a special built
[1:35:58] bird see he's kind of in the hawk family
[1:36:02] is a ripper with the bill
[1:36:04] and he eats uh uh many of them are
[1:36:06] scavengers it's about 40 different kinds
[1:36:08] of eagles
[1:36:09] but you see in the church there is a
[1:36:11] pastor
[1:36:13] and that pastor is a special person
[1:36:16] he's built to where he can uh he can put
[1:36:19] up with the fusses of the people
[1:36:21] he's a burden barrier he's the ox
[1:36:25] of the team he's a man that can
[1:36:28] sit down when the somebody's got
[1:36:30] something against somebody else
[1:36:31] and sit down with them two families and
[1:36:33] take neither side and reason it out and
[1:36:35] bring it right back into sweetness
[1:36:37] he's a pastor he knows how to take care
[1:36:41] of things
[1:36:42] the evangelist is a special man he's a
[1:36:45] man that's burning like a fireball
[1:36:47] he runs into a city and preaches his
[1:36:49] message and gets out of there somewhere
[1:36:51] else see
[1:36:52] he's a special man the teacher is a
[1:36:55] special man
[1:36:56] he sets back under the anointing of the
[1:36:58] spirit it's able to take the words and
[1:37:00] put them together
[1:37:01] by the holy spirit that the pastor
[1:37:03] advances either one could not compare
[1:37:05] with him
[1:37:06] and then we find out the apostle is a
[1:37:08] special man
[1:37:09] he's a he's a saturn order he's a man
[1:37:13] that's sent from god
[1:37:14] to set the things in order the prophet
[1:37:17] is a special man
[1:37:19] a prophet is a man of whom the word of
[1:37:22] the lord comes to
[1:37:23] because the prophet is so designed life
[1:37:27] that his subconscious and his first
[1:37:29] conscience
[1:37:30] is so close together that he doesn't go
[1:37:33] to sleep to dream his dream he sees it
[1:37:35] when he's wide awake
[1:37:37] now that's something god has to do see
[1:37:39] he sees what's going
[1:37:41] a prophet four seas way off
[1:37:45] see the things that is coming
[1:37:48] uh uh he sees the cup of god's wrath
[1:37:52] full before it is filled
[1:37:57] he can say just saith the lord
[1:38:00] god will destroy this city except you
[1:38:02] repent why
[1:38:04] he's an eagle he rides way
[1:38:07] in the honor see and he looks way off
[1:38:10] there and he sees that cup of wrath
[1:38:12] poured out
[1:38:13] that's what the prophet's looking at he
[1:38:16] ain't looking what's going on here
[1:38:18] he's looking younger he's saying it's a
[1:38:20] coming
[1:38:21] he can go so high until you see that
[1:38:23] shade he said the world will be
[1:38:26] dark darkness and gross darkness he's up
[1:38:28] high enough the sun's shining now but he
[1:38:30] sees that shade coming
[1:38:32] and he's he's he's saying what he's
[1:38:34] looking at amen
[1:38:35] it ain't here yet but it'll surely be
[1:38:37] here that's right it's going to be here
[1:38:40] gross darkness upon the people he knows
[1:38:43] it's coming
[1:38:44] years away yet he sees it amos that
[1:38:47] anointed prophet of god
[1:38:49] he saw the darkness and the judgment
[1:38:52] he's seen syria come down with their
[1:38:54] chariots and sweep to their
[1:38:56] slaughter them people out he saw it
[1:38:58] coming and the
[1:38:59] judgment of god upon him now 50 years
[1:39:03] before it happened
[1:39:04] but to see being a prophet he was lifted
[1:39:07] up into the spirit
[1:39:08] and he saw it far off see
[1:39:12] he saw the cup full before it was filled
[1:39:15] like abraham god told abraham
[1:39:18] your seed shall come into this country
[1:39:21] and sojourn here
[1:39:23] for 400 years and then i'll bring him
[1:39:26] out with a mighty hand because
[1:39:28] the iniquity of the amorites is not yet
[1:39:31] full
[1:39:32] see god knew that cup was going to fill
[1:39:35] up
[1:39:36] he's speaking with his prophet he told
[1:39:38] him i you see that cup of the amorites
[1:39:41] down there see
[1:39:42] but their iniquity's not filled up yet
[1:39:44] abraham don't say anything about it now
[1:39:45] hold off but it will come and when their
[1:39:49] cups filled up
[1:39:50] then 400 years i'll draw them out like
[1:39:53] locust
[1:39:54] is before you and i'll establish your
[1:39:55] seed here in this land
[1:39:57] amen that's
[1:40:01] the prophet of the lord now
[1:40:04] when he speaks of his vision whether
[1:40:06] it's wrath or whether
[1:40:08] it's healing it may linger but it's got
[1:40:10] to come to pass if he speaks it in the
[1:40:12] name of the lord
[1:40:14] it might be a blessing that he speaks
[1:40:16] for you he might tell you a certain
[1:40:18] thing
[1:40:19] you can't see it at all you say how can
[1:40:21] it be what's uh
[1:40:22] uh he told me thus saith the lord this
[1:40:25] is gonna happen that was gonna happen
[1:40:26] and it ain't happening the man's wrong
[1:40:29] now you'll be judged for disbelieving it
[1:40:32] but it's gonna happen anyhow
[1:40:36] got to happen thought anger in the bible
[1:40:38] said
[1:40:39] yet will it speak in a season it'll come
[1:40:42] to be
[1:40:42] the prophet's only looking off and
[1:40:44] seeing something he's talking about what
[1:40:46] he's looking at
[1:40:48] he ain't thinking about it yeah what you
[1:40:49] look like now he's looking what it's
[1:40:51] going to be
[1:40:52] and when he speaks that if it's in the
[1:40:54] word of the lord it's already been
[1:40:55] spoken there's
[1:40:56] nothing in the world can stop it you see
[1:40:58] that's right only god himself
[1:41:01] notice now we find that when he speaks
[1:41:04] his vision
[1:41:05] the prophet does now sometimes he speaks
[1:41:08] good things
[1:41:08] he speaks of your healing all right you
[1:41:11] might think it just can't happen
[1:41:13] i haven't got any better then what does
[1:41:16] that do
[1:41:17] that this brings the judgments of god
[1:41:19] upon you
[1:41:20] that's right see jesus promised to save
[1:41:23] you if you believe it if you don't
[1:41:25] believe it it won't
[1:41:25] it won't happen to you you've got to
[1:41:28] accept that you got to believe it
[1:41:30] hey and you got to know from where it
[1:41:32] comes from that gives your faith
[1:41:33] in god are your prophet see you've got
[1:41:36] to believe it
[1:41:38] and now we find out here that these
[1:41:40] prophets have spoke they
[1:41:42] they spoke and what they said come to
[1:41:44] pass
[1:41:45] if the wrath of god is poured upon the
[1:41:48] people
[1:41:48] there's only one thing if that prophet
[1:41:51] says that something other is going to
[1:41:52] happen
[1:41:53] there's only one thing that'll stay the
[1:41:55] hand of god that's repentance
[1:41:59] that's repentance towards god that stays
[1:42:02] his wrath
[1:42:02] now don't wait for it do it then
[1:42:07] god says anything you do at la then
[1:42:09] hezekiah
[1:42:10] as soon as he knew he's a good man but
[1:42:13] god said
[1:42:14] your time has come hezekiah and i i must
[1:42:18] take you
[1:42:19] i i want to i'm going to take you out
[1:42:21] put all your house in order
[1:42:22] and he he said it'll take me 15 years to
[1:42:25] do that lord
[1:42:26] uh it's you i i know i'm going but it's
[1:42:29] going to take me 15 years to put my
[1:42:31] house in order i can't do it right now
[1:42:34] i haven't got the time to do it i i just
[1:42:37] can't get it done
[1:42:38] lord let me live another 15 years so i
[1:42:40] can get this thing done i can't put my
[1:42:42] house see
[1:42:43] god's commission was put your house in
[1:42:45] order
[1:42:47] and hezekiah said i can't do it this
[1:42:49] year it's going to take me time i take
[1:42:51] this back and make this up and take it
[1:42:52] over this fellow here
[1:42:53] i take me 15 years to do it just spare
[1:42:56] me to do it
[1:42:57] let me let me give me a little time to
[1:42:59] do it
[1:43:00] see then god said i'll i'll be lenient
[1:43:03] but he had to die anyhow and begin it
[1:43:06] took his time he backslid during that
[1:43:08] time
[1:43:09] see it it'd be better if it went on
[1:43:11] without it being set in order
[1:43:12] that's right but he gave him 15 years
[1:43:15] longer to put his
[1:43:16] house in order because quickly what did
[1:43:18] he do he said lord
[1:43:19] i'm slow i need 15 years to do this
[1:43:22] you commission me to put my house in
[1:43:24] order i can't do it for 15 years because
[1:43:27] i got a loan here and i got this over
[1:43:29] here and i got this over here to do
[1:43:30] now he was a godly man and god's word's
[1:43:33] got to happen anyhow
[1:43:35] it's going to come to pass anyhow but he
[1:43:37] just stayed it for a little while
[1:43:40] see hold it off to him then he done a
[1:43:42] sin during that time he said i won't
[1:43:44] make you come up on him but i'll
[1:43:46] visit it up on his children after him
[1:43:48] you know the story
[1:43:49] now we find out that a quick repentance
[1:43:53] sometimes
[1:43:54] holds the wrath off a while now we find
[1:43:57] out that nineveh
[1:43:59] god said go down there and cry out to
[1:44:01] that city now
[1:44:02] and tell them if uh within 40 days the
[1:44:05] things go to fall
[1:44:07] and my did they ever repent as soon as
[1:44:10] they seen that prophet coming through
[1:44:11] the street
[1:44:12] saying thus saith the lord the place of
[1:44:14] fall within forty days
[1:44:16] the place will fall the even the king
[1:44:19] commanded
[1:44:20] a a fast to the country mourning put on
[1:44:23] sackcloth put ashes not upon your own
[1:44:25] head and upon your
[1:44:26] body and upon your flesh but upon your
[1:44:29] cattle upon your beasts to the field
[1:44:31] put ashes and sacko what a repentance
[1:44:36] now when we find out there we notice
[1:44:39] if the prophet don't watch real quick
[1:44:42] see
[1:44:43] get his wits together and go to god
[1:44:46] you'll find out something right there
[1:44:49] if you don't watch now look at isaiah he
[1:44:52] just
[1:44:52] spoke his prophecy went all back into
[1:44:54] his little wilderness hut
[1:44:56] and when he did the lord never spoke
[1:44:58] back to the king that was praying
[1:44:59] he has a way of doing things there's a
[1:45:02] prophet in the land the word of the lord
[1:45:03] comes to his prophet
[1:45:04] he went out there and said isaiah go
[1:45:07] back and tell him i have heard his
[1:45:09] prayers
[1:45:10] i have understood that he thinks it's
[1:45:13] going to take him 15 years to do this
[1:45:15] i seen his tears because he wanted to do
[1:45:18] the job so bad
[1:45:20] it's going to take him 15 years he said
[1:45:22] to do it go tell him i'll let him have
[1:45:23] it then
[1:45:24] see why he commissioned he commissioned
[1:45:28] isaiah to go tell him thus saith the
[1:45:30] lord
[1:45:32] then if there's any change in that or
[1:45:34] linger he's going to happen anyhow he
[1:45:36] died just the same
[1:45:37] but said if there's anything in that
[1:45:39] then he's obligated to come back to the
[1:45:41] man that he sent
[1:45:42] thus saith the lord to he told isaiah
[1:45:45] go back out there and tell you now jonah
[1:45:48] took a different attitude
[1:45:50] gets up on top of the hill and said why
[1:45:52] be good never was born and
[1:45:54] oh how he went on and god had a little
[1:45:56] gourd to come up make him some shade
[1:45:57] till he got cooled off up there
[1:45:59] but he said now here i went out there
[1:46:00] they're going to say i'm a false prophet
[1:46:02] and
[1:46:02] god spoke to him said look at that city
[1:46:04] down there
[1:46:06] look at our jonah that the whole
[1:46:09] city is repenting with sackcloth in
[1:46:11] ashes
[1:46:13] then he told him about the little gourd
[1:46:16] and the worm that cut it down
[1:46:18] one day the lord believed i'm going to
[1:46:20] come to the tabernacle and take a series
[1:46:22] just on joan oh there's so many great
[1:46:24] that east wind blowing and all
[1:46:26] oh my there's so many things in there
[1:46:27] just it's thrilling and look it's in
[1:46:29] there it's all types right
[1:46:31] it even brings jesus christ in it and
[1:46:33] everything else of course every
[1:46:34] line of the bible brings jesus christ
[1:46:37] yes sir that's our sunday's lesson
[1:46:39] so we'll let's find that the lord
[1:46:40] willing but notice
[1:46:42] these things that you if you're sincere
[1:46:46] and tell god now you have to watch i'm
[1:46:48] going to show you

[1:46:54] lady maybe some other people here

[1:47:10] wow they were they were real friends of
[1:47:12] mine

[1:47:14] people when a revival was going on they
[1:47:16] could come to church
[1:47:18] when the revival was off and the load
[1:47:19] was pulling nobody to pull
[1:47:22] and all the children was here on the
[1:47:24] cradle roll they had when we had her
[1:47:25] classes and things

[1:47:30] years ago or five something like that
[1:47:32] and this young girl which is about eight
[1:47:34] years old when she's on the crater oh

[1:47:39] and she was laying out in the hospital
[1:47:41] out here at the point of death
[1:47:43] she was about four months five with a
[1:47:47] baby
[1:47:48] and the baby had died and they couldn't
[1:47:49] operate because she had uremic
[1:47:52] and they couldn't operate so i had to

[1:47:57] like that so they had she was just dying
[1:47:59] that's all what no chance far

[1:48:04] i went into the hospital and
[1:48:06] there she was under oxygen tent i raised
[1:48:10] up a little flap
[1:48:11] talked to her a little bit and i said

[1:48:29] brother bill i i
[1:48:30] i i'm not ready to go well there
[1:48:34] we got down and prayed and her mother
[1:48:36] and her husband

[1:48:51] sorry for her sins the way she lived and
[1:48:53] went on with her repentance and crying
[1:48:55] and after a while

[1:50:48] you don't come to the lord jesus because

[1:50:55] mother dozed off sleep she said
[1:50:58] called her said mother and she said yes
[1:51:00] honey what do you want

[1:51:05] said i'm at peace with god and said oh
[1:51:08] how fine it is
[1:51:10] in a few minutes again she called back
[1:51:11] she said mother said yes
[1:51:13] said i'm going home and she said i know
[1:51:16] you are
[1:51:16] she said yes sweetheart said the doctor

[1:51:27] and your hubby and
[1:51:28] little children and be a christian and
[1:51:30] live for god
[1:51:31] she said mother i mean i'm going on my
[1:51:33] heavenly home
[1:51:34] she said sure honey at the end of the
[1:51:36] journey she said this is the end of the
[1:51:37] journey
[1:51:40] or she said nah what's the matter said
[1:51:42] it the end of the journey
[1:51:43] so it said yes mother within a few
[1:51:45] minutes i'll be gone
[1:51:48] well she thought she just got nervous
[1:51:50] and hilarious she called the nurse the
[1:51:51] nurse taking her respiration everything
[1:51:53] is normal
[1:51:54] and within five minutes she was gone she
[1:51:57] was dead
[1:52:00] and then when i come back home and a
[1:52:03] week or two after that i think brother
[1:52:05] grimm
[1:52:05] preached the girl's funeral when i come
[1:52:08] back home and meet he told me that that
[1:52:09] girl
[1:52:10] died that night nah i couldn't i would
[1:52:14] see the mother
[1:52:15] yeah i i i don't know what caused me to
[1:52:19] do it but i said lord god
[1:52:21] you owe me an understanding after me
[1:52:25] going out there and
[1:52:26] and telling that husband and him coming
[1:52:29] to the lord after you've done these
[1:52:31] things for him and
[1:52:32] all that got and then take that girl's
[1:52:34] life like that
[1:52:35] i said you owe me understanding when you
[1:52:38] tell god something like that he'll leave
[1:52:39] you sitting alone
[1:52:40] i don't mean nothing i'm in debt to him
[1:52:43] well he just let me pout it out for a
[1:52:45] few days you know
[1:52:46] and after about three or four months one
[1:52:48] day i was
[1:52:50] out on the creek bank and the lord spoke
[1:52:52] to me
[1:52:53] in a vision and said now go to her
[1:52:56] mother
[1:52:58] and say this to her mother did not her
[1:53:02] time come the year before that
[1:53:06] when she was drowning in a creek on a
[1:53:08] picnic
[1:53:10] she should have went at that time but i
[1:53:13] had to take her when she was ready to go
[1:53:17] that's why all this happened why you
[1:53:20] went out there
[1:53:22] then i got down and cried i said lord
[1:53:25] jesus forgive me
[1:53:27] yours poor stupid servant i should have
[1:53:30] never said that lord
[1:53:32] now i went back down to the ladies
[1:53:35] little market street
[1:53:36] now i want to work two and i said i want
[1:53:38] to ask you a question
[1:53:40] she said sure brother bill and i said
[1:53:44] is it true that this girl uh
[1:53:48] uh almost actually that's right brother
[1:53:50] branham said her husband and
[1:53:51] they they had to get her out of the
[1:53:52] crick that said they had to use
[1:53:54] artificial respiration and prone
[1:53:55] pressure
[1:53:56] and they had to get a machine and pump
[1:53:58] the water out of her so she
[1:53:59] had her skirt on this having a picnic
[1:54:01] she was out there and stepped in some
[1:54:02] sand slipped off overhead and strangled
[1:54:04] in the water
[1:54:05] they didn't notice her and directly seen
[1:54:06] her coming up and going down
[1:54:08] and they're running and got her and
[1:54:09] brought her out and said she almost died
[1:54:11] said you
[1:54:12] i said that was her time to go see god
[1:54:16] knows what he's doing now the lord
[1:54:19] probably would have told me that if i
[1:54:20] had to take the attitude that i did
[1:54:22] lord you owe me to tell me about that he
[1:54:25] don't owe you
[1:54:26] nothing i stood at a meeting one night
[1:54:28] and heard a
[1:54:29] an evangelist uh praying for a sick
[1:54:32] person said
[1:54:33] god i command you to heal this person
[1:54:37] who command god see
[1:54:41] i it isn't it isn't even intelligent
[1:54:44] see uh because god
[1:54:48] he does what he wants to can the
[1:54:51] can the clay say to the potter why did
[1:54:53] you make me thus
[1:54:55] see certainly not but if the prophet
[1:54:58] will keep still
[1:55:00] and then seek the lord for the answer
[1:55:02] there's the answer there
[1:55:03] see just like on this person's asking on
[1:55:06] the
[1:55:07] the the serpent seed question you see
[1:55:10] just just watch and don't don't be don't
[1:55:12] be in a bigger hurry
[1:55:14] and then now god always brings to pass
[1:55:18] everything to work together for good to
[1:55:20] them that love the lord
[1:55:22] now if if nineveh would not have
[1:55:26] repented
[1:55:27] then the judgments of god would have
[1:55:28] been upon him now remember
[1:55:30] the prophet must listen it was
[1:55:34] a warning
[1:55:37] now the same thing to this nation then
[1:55:40] you say brother brown last sunday you
[1:55:41] said there was no hope yes why
[1:55:43] it spurned its call
[1:55:46] it's got to receive it it's going to
[1:55:50] receive it
[1:55:51] there's coming a time when this nation's
[1:55:54] going to go to pieces
[1:55:56] i saw it in 1933. see
[1:55:59] i looked off you said you might have
[1:56:01] said well it happened then
[1:56:02] but it's going to happen neither was
[1:56:04] mussolini in power neither was imaginary
[1:56:07] line built
[1:56:07] neither did a car look like an egg in
[1:56:09] them days anything
[1:56:11] neither did the women elect a president
[1:56:13] that would look like a
[1:56:14] a college boy and all these other things
[1:56:16] there would be a catholic president
[1:56:19] and so forth spoke of about 30 years ago
[1:56:22] or more these things were predicted but
[1:56:25] he only showed me way off down to the
[1:56:28] end
[1:56:29] and as that thing approaches time by
[1:56:32] time that cup's filling up
[1:56:35] and repentance has been preached by
[1:56:38] billy graham or robertson who else
[1:56:41] prophets and so forth this cross the
[1:56:43] nation with signs and wonders and she
[1:56:45] continually
[1:56:46] wades into sin that's the reason they
[1:56:50] don't repent
[1:56:51] repent brings it notice ahab never
[1:56:54] repented at the rebuke of elijah
[1:56:58] if ahab would have repented and walked
[1:56:59] softly before god
[1:57:01] the thing would never happen would they
[1:57:03] have come down there
[1:57:04] and done nabop's vineyard and had him
[1:57:08] murdered and
[1:57:08] all these evil things and jezebel that
[1:57:11] prophet walked out there with thus
[1:57:13] saith the lord but what did they do
[1:57:17] she only threatened to kill him
[1:57:20] what happened his prophecy was fulfilled
[1:57:24] the dogs he heard licked ahab's blood
[1:57:27] just exactly according to his word he
[1:57:29] saw the cup
[1:57:30] full amen that's the reason that little
[1:57:33] micah
[1:57:34] saying the same thing how could he bless
[1:57:36] what god had cursed
[1:57:38] see his his word his prophecy was in
[1:57:41] harmony
[1:57:42] with the word herod he never repented
[1:57:45] when john said it's not lawful for you
[1:57:47] to have that your brother's wife
[1:57:50] he never repented but what did he do his
[1:57:53] wife required the head of the prophet
[1:57:56] yeah look at the filth he went into
[1:58:02] look what happened to him look even
[1:58:04] today and switzerland
[1:58:06] the blue waters are rejecting him still
[1:58:09] borrows as a
[1:58:10] commemoration so he didn't repent
[1:58:14] when he was rebuked of the lord
[1:58:18] john told him no matter what he was a
[1:58:20] proclamatory or whatever he was
[1:58:22] or the emperor whoever he might be he
[1:58:24] must repent when god
[1:58:26] calls or wraths upon him how many times
[1:58:29] does the prophet say i got
[1:58:30] um you know wrote down here but we won't
[1:58:33] have time because
[1:58:34] we got about 10 minutes longer if no
[1:58:36] repentance
[1:58:37] then judgment is sure to come
[1:58:41] hezekiah repented
[1:58:45] see nineveh repented
[1:58:48] ahab never repent nebuchadnezzar never
[1:58:51] repent
[1:58:52] the people in noah's times never repent
[1:58:55] and the judgment swept right on in the
[1:58:58] now
[1:59:00] but he first warns everybody everybody
[1:59:03] gets a warning
[1:59:04] now seeing the time is at hand
[1:59:08] let everyone that feels that there is a
[1:59:11] warning
[1:59:12] repent quickly before the wrath of god
[1:59:16] strikes now let's bring it down to the
[1:59:19] branham tabernacle
[1:59:21] see we have seen these things and know
[1:59:25] them to be the truth
[1:59:28] we know that it's absolutely the truth
[1:59:31] the commission of the word is if you
[1:59:33] will repent
[1:59:34] and be baptized into the name of jesus
[1:59:37] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:59:39] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:59:41] ghost
[1:59:43] for the promise is to your children to
[1:59:45] them it's far off
[1:59:46] okay now a man mr dow
[1:59:50] asked me here not long ago he said
[1:59:52] brother branham
[1:59:54] i'm getting old i'm getting weak 91.
[1:59:58] he said do you do you think i'm i'm
[2:00:00] ready to die
[2:00:02] do you think i'm ready to go you think
[2:00:04] i'm saved
[2:00:05] i said mr now did you ever go to a
[2:00:09] doctor
[2:00:10] for a physical checkup he said yes
[2:00:13] and you tell him now what the doctor
[2:00:15] does he's got a book laying there
[2:00:18] and he takes this book and he finds out
[2:00:20] now the first thing i ought to do to
[2:00:21] that man
[2:00:22] check his heart so he gets the steer
[2:00:23] scopes and puts him in his ear checks
[2:00:25] his heart
[2:00:26] i said then the next thing he gets he
[2:00:28] finds out his blood pressure with a
[2:00:30] with a pressure on his arm then the next
[2:00:32] thing he does he takes a urine specimen
[2:00:34] and whatever more and some blood out of
[2:00:35] him and
[2:00:36] all these different things he goes
[2:00:37] through all of it and if you can't find
[2:00:39] nothing
[2:00:40] takes the x-ray if you can't find them
[2:00:41] they say mr dow
[2:00:43] you're physically all right what's he
[2:00:45] based not upon
[2:00:46] on the conditions out of his medical
[2:00:48] book that if there's anything wrong
[2:00:50] according to the head scientist it'll
[2:00:52] show up here it'll do this year it'll do
[2:00:55] that there
[2:00:55] therefore as far as he can know anything
[2:00:57] about it you're all right
[2:00:59] see physically now i said in this case
[2:01:03] i'm given a soul examination
[2:01:06] see and god for the soul only has
[2:01:10] one instrument that's right that's his
[2:01:12] word
[2:01:14] that's his word and jesus said in saint
[2:01:17] john
[2:01:18] 5 24 he that heareth
[2:01:21] my word now that here doesn't mean just
[2:01:25] a
[2:01:25] listening noise that here means to
[2:01:28] receive it
[2:01:30] who can receive my word amen
[2:01:34] he that hears it don't stand still so
[2:01:36] nonsense something says nothing to it i
[2:01:38] don't believe that
[2:01:39] he that hears my word
[2:01:42] that's the word of jesus which he is the
[2:01:44] word there you are
[2:01:47] if you can hear my word he said and
[2:01:49] believe on him that sent me
[2:01:52] he has passed from death unto life
[2:01:55] and shall not even come to the judgment
[2:01:57] but already passed from it
[2:02:04] said how's your heart beating now he
[2:02:06] said i
[2:02:07] believe it i have heard it
[2:02:11] i have received it i said then according
[2:02:14] to the head
[2:02:15] specialist the chief operator the chief
[2:02:18] doctor of eternal life says you've
[2:02:21] passed from
[2:02:22] death unto life and shall never come to
[2:02:24] the continent amen
[2:02:27] so when i heard you preach on the name
[2:02:28] of jesus christ for water baptism
[2:02:30] i walked right in behind you and you
[2:02:32] baptized me
[2:02:34] said i'm the man that i once was i'm not
[2:02:36] that man no more something's happened to
[2:02:38] me
[2:02:38] i used to care nothing about it went on
[2:02:40] the other way but i've turned and
[2:02:41] started back this way my heart burns day
[2:02:43] and night to get tortured to him
[2:02:46] every word of it i believe i say amend
[2:02:49] every bit of it i don't care how it cuts
[2:02:50] me
[2:02:51] i want to measure right up to it and i
[2:02:53] have as far as i know
[2:02:54] i said it seems to me like your heart's
[2:02:56] beating pretty good i believe you're
[2:02:58] spiritually able now he said wonder if
[2:03:01] there would be when the rapture comes
[2:03:03] can i go in it brother branham i said
[2:03:05] it's not me to say who goes in or who
[2:03:07] does not
[2:03:08] he said would like to be living i want i
[2:03:10] want to see the rapture so bad
[2:03:12] i said all right let me see what the the
[2:03:14] science book says you're doing
[2:03:16] the soul science here i said well it
[2:03:18] says this
[2:03:19] in ii thessalonians the fifth chapter it
[2:03:21] said we which are alive and remain
[2:03:24] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[2:03:26] prevent that means hinder
[2:03:28] those that are resting asleep
[2:03:32] for the trumpet of god shall sound and
[2:03:34] those who are asleep
[2:03:35] are resting shall wake up first take on
[2:03:39] immortality
[2:03:40] then we which are live at that day that
[2:03:42] time after they've done raised up
[2:03:45] see then we shall be changed in a moment
[2:03:48] a twinkle lie
[2:03:49] and meet with them and they go up to
[2:03:50] meet the lord in the air be caught up
[2:03:52] together with them
[2:03:55] whether you sleep whether you don't
[2:03:57] whether you do or whether you don't
[2:03:58] wherever you're buried if you're not
[2:04:00] even buried at all
[2:04:01] you're coming anyhow there's nothing can
[2:04:04] hold you
[2:04:05] you'll be there i said brother now if
[2:04:08] jesus doesn't come
[2:04:10] until my great great great
[2:04:12] grandchildren's grandchildren
[2:04:14] you'll still be there right on the
[2:04:15] moment yes exactly
[2:04:17] and it'll be there before they're ever
[2:04:18] even changed that they go
[2:04:20] that's right amen there is a coming
[2:04:24] blessing
[2:04:24] just the same as there is a coming wrath
[2:04:27] oh we have to be looking for one of it
[2:04:29] tonight
[2:04:30] you have to either be looking for the
[2:04:31] wrath to fall upon you and for a
[2:04:33] destruction
[2:04:33] or either you have to be looked for the
[2:04:35] resurrection of jesus
[2:04:38] i'm so glad i'm watching for the coming
[2:04:42] of that glad millennium day but our
[2:04:45] blessed lord shall come and catch his
[2:04:47] waiting right away
[2:04:48] oh my heart is yearning and groaning
[2:04:52] for that day of sweet release when our
[2:04:55] jesus shall come back to earth again
[2:04:58] then sin and sorrow pain and death up
[2:05:00] this dark world shall cease
[2:05:02] in a glorious reign with jesus of a
[2:05:04] thousand years of peace
[2:05:06] oh my hallelujah and shall forever be
[2:05:10] with the lord
[2:05:12] what god said it's got to come to pass
[2:05:16] they shall build houses they shall
[2:05:17] inhabit them they shall plant vineyards
[2:05:20] and they shall
[2:05:21] eat the fruit of them they shall not
[2:05:22] plant in another inherited
[2:05:25] they'll plant their own vineyards and
[2:05:27] stay with it amen
[2:05:29] amen they shall not hurt or destroy all
[2:05:32] my holy mountains hey
[2:05:34] this bottle takes on immortality this
[2:05:37] this death is swallowed up in victory
[2:05:39] then we shall see him as he is and have
[2:05:41] a body
[2:05:42] like his own glorious body oh what a
[2:05:45] time to come the same
[2:05:46] god and the same prophets that predicted
[2:05:49] the word of god or the wrath to be
[2:05:50] poured out
[2:05:51] poor also told of these coming blessings
[2:05:54] amen
[2:05:54] i'm so glad god never does
[2:05:58] give a a nation a destruction without
[2:06:01] warning
[2:06:02] he never gives a man a destruction
[2:06:03] without warning
[2:06:05] and now if he does that we have got
[2:06:08] something that's happened to us the
[2:06:10] vindication of the signs of the last
[2:06:12] days
[2:06:13] with us the great holy spirit moving
[2:06:16] among us
[2:06:17] and charging the church with his
[2:06:19] presence vindicating his word
[2:06:22] then the church is getting ready for a
[2:06:23] climb into the sky
[2:06:25] one of these days by the power of god
[2:06:27] because it's a warning
[2:06:29] to lay outside ever wait in the sin to
[2:06:32] see easily beset us we might
[2:06:33] fly with patience this race is set
[2:06:36] before us
[2:06:37] to the author and finisher of our faith
[2:06:39] god bless you church
[2:06:41] hold to god's unchanging hand yes sir
[2:06:45] if you feel his presence go to him if
[2:06:48] there's anything wrong in your heart
[2:06:49] make it right we ain't got much time
[2:06:52] left
[2:06:52] the coming of the lord is at hand do you
[2:06:54] believe him hallelujah
[2:06:56] oh my won't that be wonderful there
[2:07:00] what a time when i see the old veterans
[2:07:03] that kind of walking down to that
[2:07:05] paradise oh my
[2:07:07] i'm looking for that hour
[2:07:13] hey man
[2:07:17] there's a lot of in there and
[2:07:20] i i wonder if as you listen to it
[2:07:25] you took it as personal
[2:07:29] a warning to you a warning to
[2:07:33] a look at at your life i thought how
[2:07:37] that he started out
[2:07:39] and he said you know he says we've got a
[2:07:42] responsibility
[2:07:44] he says he's always gives his warning a
[2:07:47] reminder to we
[2:07:49] of a responsibility a place a position
[2:07:54] something that we're supposed to do he
[2:07:55] said it it's up to a man
[2:07:58] to go to god and ask him what am i doing
[2:08:01] here
[2:08:02] what would you have me to do yes sir and
[2:08:05] we've got people nowadays they just want
[2:08:07] to throw in the towel
[2:08:10] it's not the time to run it's a time to
[2:08:13] stand
[2:08:14] find out your position in the lord find
[2:08:17] out what you can do to the kin
[2:08:19] he called it a stewardship
[2:08:23] wouldn't it be strange that god would
[2:08:25] give us a stewardship in a time like
[2:08:27] this
[2:08:29] you know why he doesn't remember why he
[2:08:31] said
[2:08:32] because people are watching you they're
[2:08:35] looking at you
[2:08:36] you're the timepiece every spring has
[2:08:40] got to be in order
[2:08:41] every part of our life has got to be in
[2:08:43] harmony
[2:08:44] because now we're god's timepiece yes
[2:08:47] sir
[2:08:47] they look at you what's the hope you
[2:08:49] have why are you getting ready why are
[2:08:51] you living this way
[2:08:53] you become a living epistle a living
[2:08:56] testimony
[2:08:57] to the to the things of god i also
[2:09:01] thought it was very important that we
[2:09:03] pick this up
[2:09:04] because we saw it in our day you know
[2:09:07] that here just a few years ago the
[2:09:10] message
[2:09:11] came under a great amount of criticism
[2:09:15] and people begin to leave the message
[2:09:18] and what was their thing what he said
[2:09:22] hadn't come to pass
[2:09:26] and he said the prophet's mocked
[2:09:29] well here he tells us
[2:09:33] that the prophets mocked
[2:09:37] but it was a warning
[2:09:41] you see see when we we get to listening
[2:09:44] so much in the present tense
[2:09:48] that we don't understand that the the
[2:09:51] this messenger was caught up
[2:09:54] he said the sun was shining and he's
[2:09:57] saying it's gonna be dark
[2:10:00] now people stand in the presence and
[2:10:02] they say oh we don't see this
[2:10:04] i start they start mocking the prophet
[2:10:06] they start mocking the prophet
[2:10:08] oh he didn't prophesy right that didn't
[2:10:10] come to pass
[2:10:12] we can't find it any place in history in
[2:10:14] everything
[2:10:15] and they totally mock it because they
[2:10:18] don't see it
[2:10:19] but they fail to see that it's coming
[2:10:25] how do you think the prophet of god
[2:10:27] sounded in 1956 when he started talking
[2:10:30] about
[2:10:30] homosexuality being rampant
[2:10:35] and the whole country given over to it
[2:10:39] you weren't even born yet
[2:10:45] and it happened just like he said it
[2:10:48] would happen
[2:10:49] you've got to understand this being
[2:10:52] caught up
[2:10:54] and when you can understand that prophet
[2:10:56] being caught up
[2:10:58] and and and god's showing him he says he
[2:11:02] sees the cup
[2:11:04] filled when it's not even half full yet
[2:11:08] and yet he's telling you
[2:11:11] of what's coming he's telling you the
[2:11:14] wrath is at hand
[2:11:15] he's telling you he said if this nation
[2:11:18] would have repented
[2:11:19] god would have stayed the wrath but they
[2:11:21] didn't
[2:11:23] so he draws the parallel so again what
[2:11:26] does that do
[2:11:27] he tells you the only way to stay
[2:11:31] the wrath is by what a quick repentance
[2:11:35] and then he says don't wait to repent if
[2:11:38] you've come under conviction or
[2:11:39] something spoke you
[2:11:41] do it right now
[2:11:45] that's a warning you understand it's a
[2:11:48] warning of an attitude
[2:11:50] it's a warning of a nature it's a
[2:11:53] rewarding to a correction to yourself
[2:11:56] because this is lady osea lukewarm
[2:12:00] always putting everything off always
[2:12:03] wait until tomorrow
[2:12:04] so in this very message is a warning to
[2:12:08] us of an attitude we need to take
[2:12:13] it's a warning to us you better have an
[2:12:15] attitude
[2:12:16] and a spirit of a quick repentance
[2:12:21] that's right don't put it off when you
[2:12:23] offend your neighbor be quick to repent
[2:12:26] be quick to say you're sorry be quick to
[2:12:28] make things right
[2:12:30] don't linger because he's talking about
[2:12:33] what happens
[2:12:36] you just slip away you slip away you
[2:12:39] slip away
[2:12:40] you don't you don't even realize you're
[2:12:42] sliding
[2:12:43] you don't even realize you're going back
[2:12:46] you don't even realize you're getting
[2:12:47] away from god
[2:12:49] you're getting cold and informal
[2:12:52] and you find yourself in it you find
[2:12:54] yourself with things
[2:12:56] just going on because what did he say
[2:12:59] they got dull of hearing he said let's
[2:13:01] bring it down to branham tabernacle
[2:13:03] let's bring it down to us this morning
[2:13:05] we hear the message we hear the message
[2:13:07] we hear the message
[2:13:08] and pretty soon it just becomes doctrine
[2:13:14] i thought this was i thought this was a
[2:13:17] term
[2:13:17] a tremendous statement she said
[2:13:22] he says and he made the people ready for
[2:13:24] the time
[2:13:25] noah made the people ready and it was a
[2:13:28] call of mercy before judgment
[2:13:33] warning and he said this message had the
[2:13:36] warning
[2:13:38] and i i thought this was this was a
[2:13:41] a tremendous statement and i'd like to
[2:13:44] let this set in
[2:13:46] and the reason i'm saying these things
[2:13:48] to you is because the prophet of god
[2:13:50] is telling us that these attitudes and
[2:13:54] natures are coming upon us
[2:13:57] listen to this one
[2:14:00] one night there was eight people that
[2:14:02] come here
[2:14:04] the lady make
[2:14:07] maybe some of her people here tonight
[2:14:11] so i won't call their name you probably
[2:14:14] know who it is but they come here a fine
[2:14:18] bunch of people
[2:14:19] from down in kentucky and they come here
[2:14:23] for years
[2:14:24] but the people being fine people good
[2:14:27] friends of mine
[2:14:29] they were they were real friends of mine
[2:14:32] but just one of those kind of people
[2:14:36] that when a revival was going on
[2:14:39] they could come to church when the
[2:14:42] revival was
[2:14:43] off and the load was pulling
[2:14:47] nobody would pull
[2:14:57] i wonder if if when you heard that
[2:15:01] did that ever strike out to anybody
[2:15:05] you know why because churches go through
[2:15:07] times where it's a
[2:15:09] pole it ain't a push
[2:15:13] it's a pull everybody having to pull
[2:15:16] it's like being on a journey you go from
[2:15:18] an oasis
[2:15:20] and you go through the mountains and you
[2:15:22] go through the valleys and you go to
[2:15:24] where the fruit is
[2:15:25] but now there comes a time that you have
[2:15:28] to go through the desert
[2:15:30] and everybody i ain't going through the
[2:15:33] desert
[2:15:35] i ain't going to pull through the desert
[2:15:37] i ain't going to push through the hard
[2:15:39] times
[2:15:41] well that's a warning
[2:15:45] you know don't be like that get in there
[2:15:49] find a farm find your part find what
[2:15:51] part of the spring you
[2:15:52] are find out what part of the clock you
[2:15:55] are
[2:15:56] do whatever you can do do it the best
[2:15:58] you can do
[2:15:59] okay you know what to me
[2:16:02] it's like the the prophet of god is
[2:16:05] giving us the
[2:16:06] answers to the test
[2:16:12] you know when school we all
[2:16:15] you know we had classes i don't know
[2:16:18] what your high school was like
[2:16:20] but when i was in high school we went
[2:16:21] from classroom to classroom
[2:16:23] and a different teacher taught history
[2:16:25] and then we changed periods and we'd go
[2:16:28] and have another history i don't know
[2:16:30] how they do school
[2:16:31] nowadays but that's how they did it in
[2:16:33] my day well some kids had history at the
[2:16:36] first period
[2:16:37] well my history class or my math class
[2:16:40] or whatever class it was
[2:16:42] some of my classes i had in the periods
[2:16:44] after lunch
[2:16:46] so at lunch time what do you think
[2:16:47] everybody was doing
[2:16:50] what questions were on the test you know
[2:16:52] what it wouldn't answer this give me all
[2:16:54] the answers
[2:16:55] you know when guys would write down the
[2:16:57] answer they put the answer and they
[2:16:59] write down the answer a little
[2:17:00] paper you think any of us ever got the
[2:17:02] same test
[2:17:04] do you think that teacher was was
[2:17:06] totally
[2:17:08] stupid no we didn't get the same test
[2:17:13] then we'd be mad at the other guy
[2:17:14] because he gave us the
[2:17:16] wrong answers to the right test
[2:17:21] you see you can't disassociate yourself
[2:17:27] with the living gospel and the living
[2:17:30] church
[2:17:32] yes sir you can't you can't separate
[2:17:35] yourself
[2:17:37] you're a part of a body a living body
[2:17:40] it doesn't matter i'm not talking about
[2:17:43] the body that's in this
[2:17:44] building i'm talking about the body
[2:17:47] which is christ
[2:17:48] jesus a church that's fitted and joined
[2:17:50] together
[2:17:51] a place that has to pull that's why he
[2:17:53] said everybody should have a
[2:17:55] be at a post of duty somewhere
[2:17:58] yes sir somewhere
[2:18:02] doesn't have to be here but it has to be
[2:18:04] somewhere but you're fooling yourself
[2:18:07] if you think you can just go off
[2:18:09] somewhere and be happy
[2:18:14] warning warning
[2:18:18] amen there's a judgment that comes for
[2:18:20] that there's a judgment for re
[2:18:24] shirking your responsibility
[2:18:27] we should ask the lord what we
[2:18:31] should be doing and you know i loved how
[2:18:34] he finished it up
[2:18:37] didn't you he said the same god
[2:18:40] that prophesied the warning prophesied
[2:18:43] the blessing
[2:18:46] amen he's the same god that said yes
[2:18:49] judgment's gonna fall but i provided an
[2:18:52] escape he said you've got to be looking
[2:18:56] for one or the other you're either
[2:18:59] looking for judgment
[2:19:01] either looking for for a wrath to come
[2:19:04] down you're either
[2:19:05] setting in fear or you're looking up
[2:19:08] because your redemption does not
[2:19:10] you either have on your heart even so
[2:19:12] come quickly
[2:19:13] lord jesus i have gone to prepare a
[2:19:16] place for you
[2:19:17] if it was not so i would not tell you if
[2:19:20] i go to prayer place for you i'll come
[2:19:22] again
[2:19:23] that you may be where i am also amen
[2:19:26] he's made that coming in our
[2:19:28] generation veiled himself
[2:19:33] in a prophet use the veil of flesh
[2:19:38] to deliver to us a message
[2:19:42] to communicate with us to our hearts
[2:19:46] to that seed that we could catch what
[2:19:49] we're a part of
[2:19:52] that we could recognize our calling
[2:19:55] that we could separate ourselves from
[2:19:57] the world and the things of the world
[2:20:00] and live holy unto the word of god
[2:20:03] being in full obedience because we
[2:20:06] know the blessing that's associated with
[2:20:09] it
[2:20:10] what's the show associated with
[2:20:12] disobedience
[2:20:15] wrath and judgment what's associated
[2:20:18] with
[2:20:18] obedience escape and reward
[2:20:21] he placed it within each of us to make
[2:20:24] that
[2:20:25] choice so really what this message was
[2:20:29] was a warning against being lukewarm
[2:20:34] it's a warning against lady osea it's a
[2:20:37] warning against being
[2:20:38] lukewarm it's it's a warning to to
[2:20:42] be so complacent that we don't think the
[2:20:46] judgments and the repentance
[2:20:50] that went across this nation for year
[2:20:53] after
[2:20:53] year after year that what he spoke
[2:20:57] isn't going to come to pass
[2:21:00] no it is coming to pass we're seeing it
[2:21:05] it's darkness
[2:21:09] i was at my mother's house and
[2:21:13] and and so i i turned on the news there
[2:21:16] and
[2:21:18] leslie came down to the room and she sat
[2:21:21] next to me and was watching the news
[2:21:23] and they were showing these riots and
[2:21:26] these
[2:21:26] burning things and police all in gear
[2:21:29] and
[2:21:30] and all these things like that and she
[2:21:33] sat there and she watched it she said
[2:21:36] i didn't know this was going on i didn't
[2:21:39] know all this was happening
[2:21:42] she says i can't take this
[2:21:45] she's gotta walk down
[2:21:49] she couldn't even believe that this was
[2:21:53] what was happening and
[2:21:56] and you can't
[2:21:59] be an ostrich
[2:22:03] you can't go down into the basement
[2:22:07] and say the sun's not shining
[2:22:12] you can't close your heart
[2:22:16] and your mind to the fact that we're
[2:22:19] living in the day of judgment
[2:22:23] but we have one promise
[2:22:28] that thou that love him and serve him
[2:22:32] and follow his word with all their heart
[2:22:35] are promised and escape
[2:22:40] so if he promised and escaped
[2:22:44] and he promised judgment and now we can
[2:22:48] see the promised
[2:22:49] judgments coming to pass
[2:22:53] how much more should we prepare
[2:22:56] ourselves
[2:22:58] for the escape amen if
[2:23:02] if you know and i that
[2:23:05] there's things that you need to do
[2:23:07] better
[2:23:09] i encourage you start doing better
[2:23:13] if you need to be kinder more gentle
[2:23:17] more forgiving more giving
[2:23:21] more helping
[2:23:27] more in love
[2:23:32] with this book then
[2:23:37] a warning is always mercy
[2:23:43] a warning is always mercy
[2:23:47] and so take the warning this morning
[2:23:50] i know it's hard when we play a tape
[2:23:54] but that tape really was wonderful
[2:23:57] it contained wonderful
[2:24:01] wisdom and truth in it
[2:24:05] so at this time i think we're having a
[2:24:08] baptism isn't that
[2:24:09] right hey brother marco's going to be
[2:24:12] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:24:15] christ a good tape for baptism when he
[2:24:17] he hit right in there on water baptism
[2:24:21] so
[2:24:22] as we go prepare for that baptism and as
[2:24:25] brother billy
[2:24:26] lead you in worship would you look in
[2:24:29] your own heart
[2:24:31] and maybe you started getting some
[2:24:33] attitudes
[2:24:35] that aren't right
[2:24:38] maybe you become a little discouraged
[2:24:41] maybe you've worried a little bit about
[2:24:44] your future
[2:24:48] and i i believe that brother branham
[2:24:50] told that story
[2:24:51] about the girl and how that god had
[2:24:55] spared time
[2:24:56] and how that he himself said to god you
[2:25:00] owe me an
[2:25:00] explanation it
[2:25:04] reflects back on us that sometimes we
[2:25:07] think god
[2:25:08] owes us something and he said god
[2:25:11] doesn't owe me a thing
[2:25:13] i owe him everything
[2:25:16] maybe there's a chance to reflect a
[2:25:18] little bit on what your
[2:25:20] attitude has been lately
[2:25:23] what just your approach to everything
[2:25:27] and and i'll i and i am warning you
[2:25:31] that harder times are coming
[2:25:35] that's the truth
[2:25:38] but also he said
[2:25:43] also he said i have not seen the
[2:25:45] righteous big bread
[2:25:48] neither will i leave thee nor forsake
[2:25:51] thee
[2:25:51] but i'll be with you even in you till
[2:25:54] the end
[2:25:54] that's right maybe our spirits just need
[2:25:57] to get to the place
[2:25:59] where we're a little more content with
[2:26:02] his
[2:26:02] presence and his blessings than we are
[2:26:06] with worldly contentment
[2:26:08] and worldly things every single one of
[2:26:11] us should be in the place today
[2:26:13] that if we lost that automobile or we
[2:26:16] lost that house
[2:26:18] or we lost our job or whatever it was
[2:26:21] and we're not making as much as we used
[2:26:23] to be
[2:26:24] as long as he's with us and in us
[2:26:27] we're happy amen because we know
[2:26:31] no matter how bad it gets here that this
[2:26:34] here
[2:26:35] can't take that away from us and he
[2:26:38] that is in us is greater than he was in
[2:26:41] the world
[2:26:42] and we will not live by bread alone but
[2:26:45] we will
[2:26:46] live by every word that proceeds out of
[2:26:49] the mouth of god
[2:26:51] if you've been in a trial for a season
[2:26:53] doesn't mean that god's against you
[2:26:56] amen amen because he said i'll be with
[2:26:58] you
[2:26:59] you know you might go through a time of
[2:27:01] suffering physically mentally or
[2:27:02] spiritually
[2:27:03] but every day you take that with a with
[2:27:06] the right attitude
[2:27:08] and the right spirit an angel walks up
[2:27:11] there
[2:27:12] buffs a great big stone and puts it in
[2:27:14] your crown
[2:27:17] amen they say someday this person's
[2:27:21] going to take this crown
[2:27:22] and throw it down the master's feet
[2:27:25] church
[2:27:26] it'll be worth it all right in a
[2:27:28] twinkling of an eye
[2:27:29] it'll be worth it all don't quit now
[2:27:33] let's fight let's hang in there god
[2:27:35] bless you brother billy
[2:27:36] if you had a brother let us go and as we
[2:27:38] prepare
[2:27:39] for baptism if you need to go up just
[2:27:42] feel free
[2:27:43] you can go with no uh don't feel bad at
[2:27:47] all
[2:27:47] if you need to go if you'd like to stay
[2:27:49] for the baptism
[2:27:50] god bless you anyway for those that
[2:27:53] streamed
[2:27:54] i hope the tape came across good for you
[2:27:57] and
[2:27:58] god bless you church love one another be
[2:28:00] in harmony
[2:28:02] and we can see what hour that we're

[2:36:34] foreign
[2:36:52] good morning it's once again this had
[2:36:54] beautiful fruits of the
[2:36:56] preaching of the gospel and to
[2:37:00] see god continually add to the church
[2:37:03] and
[2:37:05] people many people love the lord and
[2:37:07] they've come to the realization that
[2:37:09] they haven't been baptized correctly
[2:37:12] many have never given their hearts to
[2:37:14] the lord
[2:37:15] and they choose to be baptized but
[2:37:18] whatever way that a man comes
[2:37:22] some good people some sinners
[2:37:26] but we all come this one way we all come
[2:37:31] through the blood of the lord jesus
[2:37:32] christ
[2:37:34] and through water baptism and today
[2:37:37] brother marco has
[2:37:38] come to made the decision in his heart
[2:37:42] to be baptized so
[2:37:43] i'd like for him to just give you a
[2:37:46] little testimony from his heart
[2:37:48] before we baptism the mark of god bless
[2:37:51] you
[2:37:53] talk out loud
[2:37:58] when the lord wants you to to basically
[2:38:01] work for him
[2:38:02] you'll know he's going to come toward
[2:38:04] you
[2:38:05] he's going to approach you it could be
[2:38:07] through your friends
[2:38:09] your family even the people you hang out
[2:38:12] with that you've never thought
[2:38:13] or a biblical related like bible related
[2:38:17] church in any way and when the time
[2:38:20] comes you'll know
[2:38:21] amen and i feel the time has come
[2:38:25] and for my testimony i want it to be how
[2:38:27] i live my life
[2:38:29] to see how i live my life not just from
[2:38:32] now
[2:38:33] but when i met god when god revealed
[2:38:36] himself to me
[2:38:38] brother matthew 2 1 two
[2:38:42] two wednesdays past uh spoke to us about
[2:38:45] how
[2:38:46] uh when the lord reveals something to
[2:38:49] you
[2:38:50] it can't be revealed another man cannot
[2:38:52] reveal it to you again
[2:38:54] so when a man reveals something to you
[2:38:56] you could be revealed to another macro
[2:38:57] revealed to you
[2:38:58] when the lord reveals it to you no man
[2:39:00] can change that
[2:39:02] and that is what i received and i'm i'm
[2:39:04] thankful to the lord for that
[2:39:06] that's why i'm here today
[2:39:11] am i not mistaken like you were at work
[2:39:14] and somebody that wasn't even a
[2:39:16] christian at all yes sir
[2:39:17] tell them that part of it yes sir uh so
[2:39:20] i was working
[2:39:21] and uh a random person this was this uh
[2:39:25] two weeks past that was the same week
[2:39:27] brother matthew spoke to us
[2:39:28] in the meeting um randomly that whole
[2:39:31] week
[2:39:32] everywhere i went was about getting
[2:39:34] baptized my friend would ask me have you
[2:39:36] gotten baptized yet
[2:39:37] i'm like what do you mean i mean okay
[2:39:40] i'll think about it
[2:39:43] something like that and the whole
[2:39:44] throughout the week it was baptism
[2:39:46] everywhere i went
[2:39:47] was back to him that's when i knew this
[2:39:49] is the lord speaking to me
[2:39:51] through different ways and here i am now
[2:39:54] [Music]
[2:39:55] amen can you imagine just someone that's
[2:39:59] not even a christian
[2:40:00] or don't even you know go to church
[2:40:03] you've got conviction on your heart and
[2:40:05] they walk up and say
[2:40:06] have you been baptized yet oh my
[2:40:10] god knows how to do things doesn't it be
[2:40:12] wonderful
[2:40:13] let us read in our scriptures found in
[2:40:15] the book of acts and
[2:40:17] on the day of pentecost you know the
[2:40:19] story
[2:40:20] that the disciples came out of the upper
[2:40:23] room
[2:40:23] being filled with the holy ghost and
[2:40:26] they began to testify
[2:40:28] concerning the things of god and
[2:40:31] somebody said unto them all these men
[2:40:33] must be drunk
[2:40:34] and he said no these men aren't drunk
[2:40:36] but this is what was
[2:40:37] prophesied by the prophet joel that i'll
[2:40:40] pour out my spirit
[2:40:42] upon all flesh and the scripture says
[2:40:45] and we'll pick it up here
[2:40:47] and when they heard this they were
[2:40:50] pricked in their heart
[2:40:52] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:40:55] apostles
[2:40:56] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:40:59] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:41:02] baptized
[2:41:03] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:41:06] christ for the remission of sin
[2:41:09] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:41:12] holy ghost
[2:41:13] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:41:17] children
[2:41:19] and to all that are far off even
[2:41:22] as many as our lord our god shall call
[2:41:26] and with many other words did he testify
[2:41:29] and exhort saying
[2:41:30] save yourselves from this up towards
