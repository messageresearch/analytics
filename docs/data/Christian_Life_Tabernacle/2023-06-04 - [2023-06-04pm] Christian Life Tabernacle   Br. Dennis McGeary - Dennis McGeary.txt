know what he does I don't know where he goes I we have great leaders all across the world famous people but we don't know but just think we have the privilege to know the Lord Of Glory and not at a distance [Music] personally and close and he doesn't even treat you like a subject treat you like a son and a daughter and you know it it's it's just marvelous the Great privilege and that's what we're doing this evening is we're communing we're taking a time out to remember what that he did for us at Calvary and how he left himself with the church in other words I will feed you and and my word is life my word is bread and my sacrifice my blood My Sacrifice will always be with you always atoning for you always there making intercession for you I I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you always even until the end and of course sister Rebecca the sun tonight one of my most favorite songs I think she knows that your prayers have woke in the master uh isn't that what we want tonight we want to awake him in our lives and and bring them back into our situations and and I love the song that the young groups saying testify of the battles You've Won amen and you are my portion when there wasn't enough amen didn't that isn't that wonderful just tonight you can go back over and and uh and just think of it you know many times I know we think about all the things that we've done in all of our failures but he beat you to it all well you are yet sinner he died for you on the cross he made intercession to you go way down and therefore he said all that the father hath given me will come oh if we could just enter that rest like Dennis spoke to us this morning and let him be our government let him come over our lives I think it makes such a a wonderful wonderful fellowship and relationship for the Lord so we just love them so let's sing this course again this evening as we in bright uh brother Dennis to come and break the word of the Lord to us and that I told him I said I wish he'd could stay a little longer he's got to leave in the morning but if you get a chance to shake his hand and tell him how much you appreciate him that be wonderful we hope to have them buy more and when finally we get everything done around here and I think we'll be able to put some money into the missions and and I'm looking for great things in the Lord aren't you amen so help me sing it on that day [Music] and my time has come still my soul will save memories [Music] foreign [Music] oh my soul oh my soul I worship His holy name take my never before [Music] [Music] delicious [Music] word Lord It's just been so good for me Lord to have been here we just want to express our heartfelt appreciation to you Lord you've been so so good for so so long Lord so long suffering and so good and we just love you and appreciate you and as we look into your word tonight Lord we pray you'd give us the portion that's needful for this Sunday evening Lord a portion that you know that needs to sustain us Lord for our service to you Lord and what we have to face we pray you give us from your great Storehouse Lord and come and water it to our hearts that it seek deep within we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen God bless you tonight if you'd like to turn with me in your Bibles and just enjoying the worship then it's time to come up and preach I just felt like seeing him but it's been real good we appreciate the uh welcome that we feel here and I don't believe it's just because it's my family and my brother I believe it's because it's my family and Christ and ever since we started in this way we've felt the same that uh Believers and Christians and people that love the Lord just the cream of the crop and I'm appreciate I'm happy to be associated and be part of the family so just praise the Lord tonight if you'd like to turn with me to the first Peter and the first chapter it's hard to break into this opening uh chapter but we'll start at the seventh verse first Peter first chapter seventh verse that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desired to look into may the Lord bless his word oh you may be seated that's what I think that's what you're waiting to hear you know I I heard a minister make a remark the other day and he said when God spoke to Moses in the burning bush and and God asked Moses who are you Lord and the Lord said I am and he made the comment and he said wherever God is moving at the time that's the I am he's the I am God so where where whatever dispensation or whatever way God is moving where where he's at now makes him the I am and so when when Jesus was on Earth and and uh and he and he told them he said before Abraham was I am so he's the I am God and you know many times I believe in our life we're always looking for tomorrow and we're always feeling like well I'm getting ready I'm preparing myself I'm kind of getting set up that tomorrow I'm going to perform tomorrow I'm going to do this and and we we live in this state that you know this isn't the real thing but tomorrow it's going to be the real thing but what we have now saints of God is today and we are living now in our Glory Days this is it this is the thing and and it's a very beautiful thing I I I thought of a portion if we're just going to try to go back where we were this morning and read a very small portion that I left out but it brought me to this scripture that it was the spirit of Christ in these prophets not another Spirit you know the the what a great and glorious Deliverance it was for God in our day to straighten out this mess of the trinity and I'm you know this this country of Bulgaria when you look on your map in the back I like that because I saw your world map and I thought if you position yourself perfectly in the middle of that mat and if you're about five eight I think I am it'll be perfectly at your eye level and in the center Bulgaria and I thought praise the lord they're going to remember Bulgaria and uh but that country had two men that wrote the Cyrillic alphabet because they didn't want that Roman Latin Doctrine in their country so they made another alphabet so they could teach the people in the Cyrillic to the gospel and they were going to combat that Roman trinitarian idea and and spread the gospel in another language and that's the language that all of Russia and all of Eastern Europe they all have that alphabet and they all have that Slavic language but you see here in verse 11 it says searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ that was in those Prophets that was that same spirit that that rock that followed the children of Israel that rock was Christ it's not a third person in a trinity it's not another person but it's that spirit of God that Holy Spirit that was in them and it was moving in them and they were writing of the things that were for us and how casual we are sometimes and how much we take for granted these things that are revealed in our day and so this salvation that we are receiving the end of our salvation we're rejoicing because our faith looks to the end of the road and we see this as a finished work we know that were foreordained to the adoption of sons we know that God brought us here to bring us to the fullness of our inheritance and our confidence is in him that he's going to do this work and so we we walk forward in this confidence that he's going to perform his word in us because this salvation that we're partakers of the Holy sages and prophets of old time they were searching diligently and the spirit of God was moving on them and they're saying what is this Lord what is this blessing and not even knowing the things that they were speaking they were speaking the things that we would fulfill what a glorious thing it is knowing that he knew that he would have someone that would stand the test in the end time he's always got somebody that's going to represent him on this Earth he's already going to have he's always going to have somebody who's going to represent him and I remember when the when uh in Revelations chapter 5 when no one was worthy to open the book and and and there was nobody in heaven and nobody in Earth and no one was worthy to look in the book and finally John he looked for the the Elder said don't don't fear John don't weep and and they said the lion of the tribe of Judah he is worthy to open the book and when he looked to see the lion he saw a lamb and that lamb had seven eyes which are seers which we can see that all the way from Zachariah all through the Old Testament the seven spirits of God which were seven manifestations of just the one great spirit God but also when he went and he looked at that lamb that lamb had seven horns and what did Brother Branham say those seven horns were his representation his power on Earth because he all through each age he had somebody to to uh uh a horn represents a power or a kingdom and he's got his kingdom on Earth through each of these ages he's got somebody that represents him and I and I've told it so many times and I it just sticks with me and I've I've said it a lot but I I like to talk about it but you know when I go some of these far-off places many of these people had to uh leave their homes and go to work and go to work overseas and then they they they don't want their homes taken over while they're gone and this is just really hard like in Bulgaria for the Gypsy people to look at a beautiful home not not occupied for a year or two well they would just go and move into it and and you know then we'll face it when the people come back well the the people know that so they have some grandma or somebody some relation and they say just live in that house and represent our claim to the house now grandma might not be you know power have much power but she's got the place and the authorities she represents the ownership of that house and God's gonna have somebody on the earth that represents his claim to this earth until he comes again of course brother Graham said the policeman you know he don't have much power but he's got Authority and so here these Prophets they're searching diligently for this salvation that we have and we live our life and we conduct ourselves receiving the end of that now speaking of these Prophets testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things it's not a kind of a phenomena that here they are ministering and they're speaking the things hundreds of years before by the spirit of Christ and they're ministering to us my this gospel is Supernatural there's more Supernatural going on in our lives than I believe that we realize and the word of God is having an effect in empowering us and and feeding us and securing us and comforting us and energizing us and inspiring us and and we just read our Bible and we say glory to God and here it is one of the prophets and sages who is diligently seeking what is this Lord what is the spirit on me he's speaking things that he doesn't really understand a virgin shall conceive maybe he didn't even know what he was saying I heard brother Branham uh uh speaking about brother Neville and he said he said it it was after a service and the spirit of the Lord was moving and he said this is what Joel prophesied of he said this Holy Spirit moving amongst us in the service this is it and he said that God could take the man and have him stand up and he doesn't even know what he's going to speak and put words in his mouth and God now this is Brother Brown I'm talking about it's not my commentary but Brother Brad him on tape saying God using Brother Neville to speak to me now I was just amazed at the fact that you know God could speak to brother Branham live to ear he didn't have to use brother Neville but he said he brother Neville stood up and didn't even know the words that were going to come out of his mouth and the spirit of the Lord told Brother Brown and said don't worry about your itinerary I'll take care of that and I I'm just going to fellowship with you tonight Saints I love these tapes because I feel like God's talking to me and there was just a rebuke in there and said you know what's wrong with you thinking that brother Neville is some kind of Junior shame on you you know shame on me what what what kind of thought am I uh uh uh thinking when I heard brother Branham said that that a man could be so yielded to a holy spirit that he'd just stand up and not even know what's going to speak I thought I would like a little bit of that I'd like to be so moved on by God that I didn't know what was going to come out of these lips but I like that black man said he said he said well what if what if that Bible said you know jump through that brick wall and he said I go to jump and he said there'd be a hole there when I get there I want to live my life like that there's going to be a hole there when I get there no all those little cousins came around that gal that believed the word of God and she's up at night sowing a little gown and all the other cousins you know they they they went to the parties and everything else but she didn't she didn't go to no party she's working in the kitchen but when the when the son of the owner came and saw her said I see in you a character that's the kind of woman I want and she just staying up at night so and and saving her pennies and she's getting her wedding down ready and they all laughed at her and said my goodness look at that you out here in this hot sun and you look ridiculous yeah you look ridiculous what has gotten into you and you're out here in the middle of this desert out on this Ranch in a wedding gown you got to be kidding me she said that's all right I got 30 minutes I'll just out here sweat I'm just holding my bouquet I'm just sweating and just trying to be as fresh as I can for my bridegroom when he comes and pretty soon the sound of those wagon wheels in the sand going through those Wagon Wheels she just jumped out all those critics and she went home with her bridegroom it's okay it's a personal fair this is not a public show and I know when God's talking to me and he's talking to me out of this word he's talking to me through brothers and sisters man I I I you know sometimes I'm in fellowship and I hear a little word and I'm you know with brothers and sisters and somebody's testifying and I'm thinking um oh that hurt let's we don't have to tell nobody about that but but that hurts you know I want to do better or something you know you just somebody testifies a certain way I I went into a place and when so many stories up and this sister had you know things conditions were so bad in that place and she said well come in she said well I want you to see our new apartment and I'm thinking my goodness this building is of wreck and she's five stories up and she's got this family of kids and I'm just thinking I'm not even feeling comfortable my own self I'm just and then she comes in and she says you know the Lord just knew I like the morning son and she gave us this apartment and he said look at the morning sun and it wasn't the morning sun that was getting me it was what was shining in her countenance and she's so thankful and so sweet and she looks over the balcony and we looked down at that play yard five stories down with these Steel toys that looked like a death traps to me you know this this park and she says I can look down and see the kids playing in the in the park there said isn't this wonderful well I'm going on that yeah it's wonderful sister but you know God speaking and here it is these men are moved of God to speak words to us that God knew that that would be our food and it was his provision and he stored up for this this food for us and how Supernatural this Manna is that it never gets old you listen to a tape again and you think Lord I never heard that and it's and it's moving it's kind of like that radium remember those women that they were making those watches and one of them touched that radium and then they dug up the school a little while later and that radium's still moving still moving still moving and you know I what frustrates me you know we're not um you didn't have a visiting minister to complain up here but I do have a complaint brother McGarry and that's I get a hold of these things and I get a little bit of that radium and that thing's moving and then I get a hold of something else and that starts moving and I got all this word of God moving and me and the things that the prophet said and that's connected to that and that's connected to that you know all the roads are connected and everything's connected and I'm thinking what was that you know that little bit of radium I hear that rolling in the back and I'm thinking Lord remember you talked to me what what what was that and maybe God just says well child that's old you know we're moving on you well you know whatever you got from that we're moving forward that was yesterday's lesson that was yesterday's food and you're getting pulled forward and you're thinking Lord but that was so good I'd love to go back there someday I love to go back to that my that's a problem of abundance God's just so good unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel with the Holy Ghost Sent From Heaven which things angels desired to look upon that's where we're at we're sitting in Heavenly places enjoying the things that these prophets and scribes and even angels desired to look upon and they're revealed to you that's why I love that song that song uh this is the air I believe you know this this is my daily bread your very word spoken to me wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ so all of these glorious things that we are seeing and the way that they break upon us and we say oh God that is so beautiful that's so wonderful if you could really get in the spirit and don't ever let anybody tell you some kind of Catholic thing like you know well that's for priests and that's for the spiritual people and that's for the preacher that's for somebody besides me you know I I don't seem to get it no you you you stay in there you just keep digging you're going to hit gold you are going to hit gold and it's going to be sweet and you're going to know the taste of the honey of the word of God God don't put that thirst in your soul to for you to come up empty oh no Jesus said when he was on Earth he said blessed are you that thirst and hunger for righteousness for you shall be filled Jesus ain't no liar Jesus's words don't fall he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek them you don't have to get what somebody else got God God's got something for you hey man oh and I get excited because I when I see young people just out in the parking not visiting with these young people and I I miss those days when my kids were young like that had all their friends over and all of that life but you know I and I look back and I think men I was 19 come out of Catholicism walked right out of it I didn't know what I was doing but I walked right out of that dark dingy religious death dungeon cold dead would have sealed me away in death religion and gone to church like that the rest of my life maybe become an altar boy or a priest or just in some dead Church the rest of my life and the grace of God at 19 years old did I know what I was doing but I started to read my Bible the prophet of God said if you want to be more spiritual do what read your Bible and pray okay so we missed something this morning and that's what's wonderful about being able to be in the evening service is there something really precious in here to me that we didn't read now it says in Isaiah 22 22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulders so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signified at the time is a mere Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage so it's just interesting that a lot of times we think of prophecies and we think well that was Jesus first coming that was when Jesus was on Earth and when the you know like in the Book of Psalms and they talk about the David talks about the crucifixion my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me my bones stare at me and he you see all of these Prophecies of things in Jesus's Earthly Journey and then there was other prophecies about his kingdom and his Reign and his power and his and and about the Millennium and the second coming of the Lord and so a lot of times we're looking at these prophecies and we're saying is that his first coming is that his second coming but very interesting that brother Branham points out here that this was a prophecy in Isaiah 20 22 22 it was a prophecy about Jesus's Ministry in the church in the church ages because he was walking in the midst of those seven candlesticks and this was him this was him himself walking amongst us brother Graham said walking meaning in action and he's revealing himself and he's governing and he's moving amongst us in his church and in these Church ages he's manifesting his seventh the Sevenfold Glory of his person and you want to know Jesus well sometimes there's a little study in it you know sometimes we we sing songs and we say oh Jesus I want to know you more and and we pray and we read our Bible and but if you if you press in a little bit then this is not so academic you know if the Lord will help you a little it's not so academic it's him revealing who he really is to you now how would you like it if uh if uh I started I'm up here and I started talking about who brother Ben is and you know how he feels about things and maybe who he likes and who he doesn't like and you know I start all talking about brother Ben here well pretty soon brother Ben's going to say wait a minute can can I say who I am why why does somebody else have to say what kind of guy I am let me just tell you what kind of guy I am and this is how God in his word he wants to commune to you because he wants you to get it right and that's why he built his church on Revelation he didn't built it on hearsay he didn't build it on on theology he didn't build it on reasoning and rationality and and you know let's reason this all out and leave him out of the picture no he comes himself and reveals to you who I am and he wants to tell you what he thinks about you yeah it's wonderful so I just thought that was just really beautiful how that brother Branham brought to our attention that here's a prophecy in the Old Testament saying that he's going to be in the church with that Key of David on his shoulder and those prophets in old they were ministering those things to us so we could understand our relationship to him in this day because he's going to have a church and did he know who was going to be in his church sure did he know when you were born what color hair you'd have you know what color eyes you'd have did he know what kind of temperament that you'd have and what kind of complexes what kind of Hang-Ups and what kind of strengths and what kind of affections my I heard that old sister the other night and she's so excited about hearing some of the things the prophet said and it just blessed my soul and I thought shame on you Dennis don't you never talk to an older person and think that they can't come to the Lord and come into the message of the hour because confession is good for the soul I've had that where you know I thought well you know the person's pretty old they're probably just setting their ways and you know make no sense in talking to him shame on me my okay well I just wanted to read a few quotes is this all right brother David just just want to read a couple quotes about communion because as I was coming over to church I thought about how brother Branham talked about communion being a showdown and I remember being overseas and you know we have these words and then you've you know and somebody asked you what does Showdown mean and so I have to tell them you know what I know from like the western movies when the two guys come out and one said I'm the fastest in the west and the other guy said I'm the fastest of the West well a lot of talking can go on and and you know they can argue or you did me wrong and I did you wrong but there come a day when they one day one day all that that's over with and now we're standing out in the street and this is The Showdown yeah this is The Showdown we're going to figure out who's the fastest in the West now if there's another definition of Showdown then uh I don't know it brother Bram said and now we're going to have communion tonight and that's the time that we all enjoy I'm sure I think it's the Delight of a Christian's heart is to know that he is coming to keep a Commandment that Jesus left us there's two Commandments that Jesus left us two material things one of them is communion service and the other is water baptism otherwise there's no touch and handle nothing else left in it see just nope Penance and dragging on your knees and all these other kinds of things it's just water baptism and communion so we're always happy to come to this and I believe the Bible said blessed is he that does his Commandments they have the right to enter into the tree of life for into the city or the holy city for without our dogs and whoremongers and so forth which is to be Cast Away and then the communion service is always a real strict one because it brings us to a showdown see as we'll read in a little while in the scriptures just wanted to read another one with that expression showdown in it if you bear with me just a minute now that doesn't need any explaining it's just this if we eat and drink unworthily we eat and drink damnation to our own self not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weakly and sick among you and many are dead see when we come to take communion every Christian should take communion it's your duty it's a showdown see Jesus said if you don't take it you have no part with me see but he that eateth and drinketh thee unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself that is if you're still out with the world and doing things of the world and people see you taking communion you're doing wrong you're only bringing disgrace to you and it'll only harm you it isn't that it'll harm God it'll harm you and so a person should examine themselves you see The Showdown to it for I truly think that it's the duty of every Christian to take communion the Bible said if you take this knot you have no part with me and I believe that it's a showdown time for the Christians if we do not take it we have no part with him and if we take it unworthily then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ so it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up when he comes to the communion we should come reverently solemnly sacredly walking up confessing all of our wrongs praying one for the other not only that but we should feel if there's a brother or sister Among Us that we feel is just a little bit out of line somewhere our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially to see them that they'll be able to walk up and take communion not be condemned with the world because there are brothers and sisters God bless you tonight it's been a real privilege to be here with you pray the Lord's blessings on you and we'll just turn the service over now God bless you thank you as Sharon with Dennis on the way over that of all the knights of church communions always the weakest night and uh don't you I like that quote don't you want to get to that place where you can win that Showdown you know where you can come up and have fellowship with him and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that yes you've done wrong yes you failed but the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all righteousness and we've confessed our sins and our sins are gone before us and that's what he said he says if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive him and to accept that forgiveness you know our messenger told us that a Christian can never amount to anything till he accepts what Calvary has done for him and that's what tonight is it's you know it's not to talk about them but it's for you to get to know him and how do you get to know somebody spend time with them you commune with them that's always been a thrill in my life when I've got to sit down and meet somebody being a pastor there's a lot of people come to your church you don't get to know very well you love to know them you long to know him you wanted to come over to your house you want to get close to them and then you've got an opportunity to spend some time with them in such a delightful side of their personality comes out or you find out something about them and it just lifts your heart uh on the inside because you've drawn closer and this is what tonight is it's a time for you to draw closer to him for for you to commune with him and talk to him and just to think that he knows what you have need of even before you ask so it's not always a time of just asking asking but it's a time to ask the Lord oh like Dennis said reveal yourself to me that I might know you better you know me Lord for you you know me before I ever got here but I've come to commune with you and to to know for you touch me and speak to my heart give me Revelation gotta open a window that I could look out or open my heart that I might receive something just like he said that blessing of having a burden for those that are open my heart today Lord so I can receive that kind of care that kind of Burden open my heart today that I could have eyes have that I could see when somebody's in need or somebody needs something open my eyes make me tender to the church around me and the people around me do you believe he could do it if you ask him amen do you think he can make you different amen that's what communion does can make you different amen the prophet of God said there's healing in communion many of people have come and taken communion and been made well so let's stand together and the brothers could go prepare the uh uh not communion for our service tonight and of course we'll turn to our scriptures found in the first 11th chapter of First Corinthians when Paul brought communion uh to the church and introduced it to them I sure there might have been a question on Paul's heart as the disciple shared with him the experience that they had in the upper room and I'm I'm I bet your heart Paul's heart burned within them as he heard them tell them about the Lord Jesus and the experiences and the stories uh that they had with him you know people say that people get tired of the stories of the Prophet I love to hear every story anything somebody can tell me about him just sets my soul on fire and then Paul he he no doubt being what he was he looked into it and then he received it from the Lord and then he brought it to this church and I believe to every Gentile church I don't know why the church world has abandoned communion be honest with you I don't know why this message has abandoned communion so much could we do it once a month here because the best of my of knowledge that's the way brother Branham did it I know many places don't have communion once a year maybe but regardless you have communion in your heart all the time let us read for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup Ed Show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another for If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come I like the part of what Dennis brought out or the prophet of God said you have that burden for your brother that he might take communion to that that's part of that tearing that's part of Discerning the Lord body who's sick among us who's needy Among Us who's in financial trouble Among Us who's going through a hard time Among Us don't you want to take the whole burden of the body on I want to be a part of it everybody a member of the bodies sacrificing and supplying the need to every other one Lord don't let my heart be selfish let me come in communion to you this evening that I can be more like you father that you can open my heart to your attributes you can open my spirit that I can be tender Lord and more kind and more aware of my atmosphere and the needs of others Lord I I come to this evening to tell you I'm sorry for my shortcomings but father I do want to follow in your footsteps and Lord I'm asking tonight that you give us a personal touch that that love could shed abroad in our heart by your spirit we ask these in Jesus name Amen Let Us bless the bread and the wine this evening you all you all bless it too and pray for it too let us all bust the bread together you pray in your heart in your spirit our gracious Heavenly Father this bread represents your body Lord not only the one that was sacrificed on our behalf and paid the price for our sins but the whole Universal Body of Christ every member fitted and joined together every member having a portion of you living in them as the great prophets were spoke of you as our brother spoke this evening that it was you and them ministering to us father this body represents that tonight your spirit in US ministering to others father may it burn deep in our heart father May Our Testimony be that we walk and live as you have walked and lived father made this bread father bring that strength into our body heavenly father in this wine representing the life father and the stimulation that returns back onto the believer father as we know that the word says that every other sacrifice just stood as a substitute and a representation but this sacrifice allowed the sacrifice to return back upon the believer and make a difference in their lives Lord may this communion deceive me make a difference in each of Our Lives as we're stimulated with the life that was in the sacrifice that you would come into our lives father and our lives have become more like yours we ask you to breast this bread and this wine to us this evening in communion in Jesus precious name we pray amen foreign
