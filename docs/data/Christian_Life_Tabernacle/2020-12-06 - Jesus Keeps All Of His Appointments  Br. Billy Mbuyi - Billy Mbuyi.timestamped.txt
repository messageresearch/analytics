[35:26] uh in Luke's chapter
[35:28] uh
[35:52] seven we will start reading from verse
[35:56] 36
[35:58] it says and one of the Pharisees desired
[36:01] him that he would eat with him and he
[36:06] went into the Pharisees house and sat
[36:08] down to meet and behold a woman in the
[36:11] city which was a
[36:13] sinner when he knew that Jesus set at
[36:15] meat in the Pharisees house brought an
[36:18] alabaster box of anointment and stood At
[36:23] His Feet behind him weeping and began to
[36:26] wash his feet and with tear tears and
[36:28] with uh and did he uh wipe them with the
[36:32] with with the hair of of her head and
[36:35] kiss his feet and anoint and anointed
[36:38] them with the anointment it says now
[36:41] when the Pharisees which had bidden him
[36:44] saw it he spake within
[36:47] himself but what says remember now not
[36:50] loud but within himself saying if if if
[36:54] if this man was a prophet he would know
[36:57] who and what manner of of woman this uh
[37:02] this is that touched him and for she is
[37:06] a sinner and Jesus answered and said
[37:08] unto him Simon I have somewhat to say
[37:11] unto thee and he said Master say
[37:15] on there was a certain creditor which
[37:18] had two dors and they owed and one of
[37:22] them owed
[37:24] 500 uh pants and the other 50 and when
[37:28] they had nothing to pay he frankly
[37:30] forgiv them both he says tell me
[37:34] therefore which one of them will love
[37:36] him most Simon answered and said I
[37:39] suppose to he to whom he forgave the
[37:43] most and he said unto him thou has
[37:45] righteously rightly judged and he turned
[37:49] to the woman and said unto Simon seeth
[37:52] that this woman I entered into thy house
[37:55] thou Gest me no water to wash my feet
[37:59] but she was she has washed my feet with
[38:03] the tears and has wiped them with the
[38:06] hair hairs of her head and thou has
[38:10] given me no kiss but this woman since
[38:12] the time I came uh I came in has no ceas
[38:16] to kiss my feet my head with uh my head
[38:20] with oil thou did not anoint but this
[38:23] woman has anointed my feet with oil
[38:27] wherefore I say unto unto her I say unto
[38:30] thee her sin which were many are
[38:33] forgiven for she loved much but to him
[38:37] little Is Forgiven same loveth little
[38:41] and he said unto her thy sin are
[38:44] forgiven and they and and they that sat
[38:47] at at meat with him began to say within
[38:51] themselves who is he that forgiveth the
[38:54] sins also and he said unto the woman
[38:58] thy faith has saved thee go in peace

[39:05] Lord so you may speak to us before
[39:06] communion we commit everything we are
[39:08] and ask this in the name of Jesus Christ
[39:10] amen amen you may have your
[39:14] seats amen just before we go on before I
[39:18] can just uh give a title of some of the
[39:20] things that just on my heart uh to speak
[39:23] tonight
[39:25] um I was just moved by some of the
[39:28] things that I uh Pastor spoke about this
[39:31] morning and uh I just wrote down a few
[39:34] of the things that just uh uh just just
[39:39] spoke to my heart it you you you begin
[39:42] to look
[39:44] around the world and around even the
[39:46] message you one of the things that just
[39:49] jumps that you you realize that uh uh
[39:53] people are looking for things that make
[39:55] sense people are looking for a gospel
[39:58] that's easy to swallow they're looking
[40:00] for a word of God that's mainstream they
[40:03] they don't want anything that's God you
[40:06] know things that just seem like it's
[40:08] going to cause a reproach they want
[40:10] something easy something they can take
[40:12] on something they can live by something
[40:15] they can explain something that their
[40:17] minds can comprehend and and and because
[40:21] it's the nature of men we you know I was
[40:24] thinking about this and I was speaking
[40:26] with Matthew a couple of days ago weeks
[40:28] or so we were speaking and he just done
[40:30] on me that the mankind find it very hard
[40:35] to live by faith you know it's easy to
[40:38] know that I have money in the bank to
[40:40] buy the food that I need to pay the
[40:42] rents that I need it's very easy to know
[40:44] that I have a job and I have this I have
[40:47] this when you have everything mapped out
[40:49] when you don't have a question life is
[40:51] easy you know if I'm sick I I have a
[40:54] doctor that I can go through and
[40:56] everything but but it we we understand
[40:58] that a Believer is not called to live
[41:00] that way we are called to live by faith
[41:04] and to live by faith means there's going
[41:05] to be challenges there's going to be
[41:07] opposition it means there's going to be
[41:09] time where that faith will be put at
[41:11] test there's going to be some sleepless
[41:14] night where you're going to be on your
[41:15] knees crying out to God for him to bring
[41:17] his promise to come to pass and there
[41:19] was also going to be a time where
[41:22] there's a peace inside of you when
[41:23] everything is in chaos we living my
[41:26] faith means you've taken your life and
[41:28] you've placed it in the hands of the one
[41:30] that you trusted and you know that he's
[41:32] going to take care of you no matter what
[41:35] living by faith meaning the enemy is
[41:37] going to be after you because he the the
[41:39] every time faith is Manifest there's
[41:41] always a trying of Faith that's along
[41:43] that's coming along so it's easy that's
[41:46] why uh we could see it in the world and
[41:49] and that that same mentality or that
[41:51] same reasoning is trying to be brought
[41:53] into the message where people are
[41:55] looking for things that make sense and
[41:57] they're trying to make sense of
[41:58] everything and so I began to think and
[42:01] and and I begin to realize I just
[42:02] thought for a moment even about the very
[42:06] uh uh Christianity that we believe today
[42:09] even as we see here
[42:10] tonight you you you look in the Bible we
[42:14] we we could talk our very Foundation
[42:16] which we can say is our background it
[42:18] talks about a a man who who who claimed
[42:21] to stop the
[42:26] sun with believe that a man said that
[42:29] son ST stand still and it stops now
[42:32] scientifically you can't explain that to
[42:34] me because the sun is not spinning
[42:36] scientifically we are told that the sun
[42:39] is standing till it's the Earth that's
[42:41] going around the Sun scientifically we
[42:43] can't make sense of that but we believe
[42:45] that he stopped the sun because that's
[42:47] what the word says and you begin to read
[42:49] it talks about people who came and who
[42:52] were Believing by faith that Moses
[42:54] opened the righted sea how do you
[42:56] explain they say that some will say well
[42:58] you know it was the reads and then the
[43:00] water came down and there's all kinds of
[43:02] explanation but as Believers we know
[43:04] that God parted the Red Sea he opened it
[43:08] wide open for his children to go through
[43:10] he did it because his word said he did
[43:13] it and he proclaimed that he did it and
[43:14] we know that that God did it because
[43:17] that's what he wanted to achieve in that
[43:19] time you read about a man who receive a
[43:21] son how that he was past the age of
[43:24] conceiving not just that they receive a
[43:26] son but God took their bodies their
[43:29] natural bodies and he turned them young
[43:32] and he gave them a
[43:34] son we we We Gather here we can go back
[43:37] in the New Testament we believe that the
[43:40] very founder of the church was born by a
[43:45] virgin you talk about things that don't
[43:47] make no sense we are not faith is not
[43:50] built on any understanding of men and
[43:52] brother Bram tells us that it's easier
[43:55] for us together today and talk about
[43:57] those things because they've been made
[43:59] mainstream and people have believed them
[44:01] we know there's millions and millions
[44:03] and and I'll say this if God made it
[44:05] challenging in that time that God will
[44:08] be unjust to make it easier for us it
[44:11] would have to be something that by
[44:13] natural mind I cannot understand it I
[44:16] cannot put it together but something
[44:18] within my heart believes this
[44:21] word it's not by sight it's not by
[44:24] understanding faith is not looking for
[44:27] some science or some records or
[44:29] something that I can put together and
[44:31] once I've put it together then I have
[44:33] faith no that's human Faith but the
[44:36] faith that comes from God is as Jesus
[44:39] looked at Peter and says flesh and blood
[44:41] has nothing to do with this your
[44:44] understanding your human mind and
[44:46] everything that the efforts of men can
[44:48] put in is nothing to do this this is a
[44:50] direct Revelation for my father into
[44:53] your heart for you to say the things
[44:55] that you're saying
[44:57] that's the foundation we are built on he
[45:00] talks about here he is and and he comes
[45:02] down to the uh uh uh River Jordan to be
[45:05] baptized and his cousin is the
[45:11] prophet and his cousin is the prophet
[45:13] and he came and somewhat some story
[45:16] about how his cousin was dead in his
[45:18] mother's womb and and Mary came and he
[45:20] poked the word spoke the word and he
[45:22] came alive and all those things and and
[45:25] and you take a Jew you sit him there and
[45:27] expect them to believe
[45:30] that it was a hard thing to swallow it
[45:33] was difficult the word of God is not
[45:35] built upon men's intellect upon men's
[45:39] understanding or ability to put things
[45:41] together this is another kingdom that
[45:44] God is manifesting around us that God is
[45:47] pulling things and is placing things so
[45:49] that the intellect will fail to
[45:51] understand it so that the human mind the
[45:53] wise and those that are educated will
[45:56] not be able to put it but so that he
[45:58] himself can come down and put it
[46:01] together for you and place within your
[46:03] heart something that will believe the
[46:05] hard
[46:06] things it's not we're not called to
[46:09] believe the easy thing if if if every
[46:11] Church on the corner believes it then
[46:13] what's wrong with it the whole world
[46:15] will believe it but we are called to
[46:17] believe something that men will look at
[46:20] and call crazy why because the wisdom of
[46:23] God is crazy to men anyway but it's the
[46:26] understanding that we have received by
[46:28] Revelation to know that that's the
[46:33] truth and all of those things were
[46:36] people's personal
[46:41] accounts who was there when the angel
[46:43] came to
[46:48] marry it was their personal account they
[46:51] testified of what happened to them they
[46:53] testify of things that God done for them
[46:56] they testify of how he came and he
[46:58] manifested himself and I want to say
[47:00] this if if that's the way God started
[47:03] his church it's the way that God is
[47:05] doing it today otherwise he will be an
[47:08] unjust God because the word of God is
[47:11] never without a reproach he always
[47:13] placed he's always brought in a manner
[47:15] where he misses the intellect but he
[47:17] goes straight into the seed into the
[47:21] heart butam says this and I thought I I
[47:25] thought that was just so awesome says in
[47:27] the message the talken it says it says
[47:30] we are it says we are we have not come
[47:32] together to talk about a message we have
[47:35] come together to get into the message it
[47:39] says and the message is Jes is Christ he
[47:43] is the word that's right we are to get
[47:47] into into get into it beneath it sir it
[47:51] says that's what we are supposed to do
[47:54] the message is not a bunch of
[47:56] understanding where we can come and say
[47:58] well we believe this we believe this we
[48:00] believe this therefore if you believe it
[48:02] I believe it then we believe the message
[48:04] no the message is the word of God is
[48:06] Christ is the anointing that have been
[48:09] come that has come into the heart of the
[48:11] individual that is bringing him into the
[48:14] program of God into what God is
[48:16] intending to do at the end time in fact
[48:19] what we have been called to do is to eat
[48:22] of the message and to become the very
[48:24] word that's what Pastor said the problem
[48:27] we have the challenge we have is we have
[48:29] too many people with intellect but very
[48:31] people with the
[48:32] Revelation it's it's intellect all over
[48:35] and intellect is clashing against
[48:37] intellect because if it's Revelation
[48:39] then there's no way there's no question
[48:42] to dispute it there's no need for you to
[48:45] explain it because why your very life
[48:47] manifests what you
[48:50] believe it it will be without a dispute
[48:53] it will be without a question that's why
[48:56] the book the spiritual speaks in uh
[48:58] Revelation chapter 10 John was
[49:01] instructed to eat of the book he was
[49:04] specifically instructed that you go you
[49:06] take the book and you eat it and when he
[49:09] ate it the very book became part of
[49:11] himself and that's why we have to come
[49:14] here tonight and realize even as we
[49:16] heard it this morning it's by eating of
[49:18] the book by obeying the things that he
[49:21] said by staying with the things that he
[49:23] said that's how we are transformed into
[49:25] the very promise that he has given us
[49:28] it's not a bunch of understanding when
[49:30] we can come and explain this and explain
[49:32] this that we are fun because the people
[49:34] that will go in the Rapture are going to
[49:36] be the only one that have eaten of that
[49:38] book and become what the messenger said
[49:41] they would
[49:42] be butam
[49:45] says he
[49:47] says he says and and and he speak now uh
[49:52] here um he says he has not we are not we
[49:57] have not come together to talk about the
[49:59] message we have come together to get
[50:01] into the message and the message is
[50:04] Christ and he is the word that's right
[50:07] we are he says we are to get into it get
[50:10] beneath it yes sir that's what we are
[50:12] supposed to do he's not responsible for
[50:16] any person out from under the blood no
[50:19] one no matter who he who he was or who
[50:23] who was not who he was not responsible
[50:25] he says he had to take only he it says
[50:31] all he had to take not only himself but
[50:35] the whole family now this is in the
[50:36] message the token the whole family the
[50:39] only safe place was the token to be
[50:41] displayed he says we cannot feel safe
[50:44] until this token is displayed that life
[50:48] becomes undisplayed that's right you
[50:51] must be under this token God's holy
[50:54] spirit and its display it's it display
[50:58] to you Jesus Christ because because it
[51:02] comes and lives in
[51:05] you so so you realize it's not uh uh the
[51:10] understanding of the message but it's
[51:11] the application of the token in the life
[51:14] of a believer that makes him safe it's
[51:17] when we have applied of this message
[51:19] follow the instructions of the message
[51:21] applied it to our life and be led by the
[51:24] spirit of God in our lives that's when
[51:26] we are Sav it's not even I like what
[51:29] brother Matthew said the other Wednesday
[51:30] it's by humbling ourselves dying to our
[51:33] own selves and letting his life live
[51:35] through us that's what that's our safety
[51:38] that's always been the safety of a
[51:39] Believer and and and so often time you
[51:42] know here we are people are calling it
[51:44] all kinds of Nam they're saying all
[51:46] kinds of things but they're failing to
[51:47] realize that yeah he is I was thinking
[51:49] about Samuel y came and Israel is
[51:52] looking for a king and Y he comes he
[51:55] gives them the word of the Lord and they
[51:57] rejected they want a King Samuel goes
[52:00] back and and he tells God and I believe
[52:02] it's in Samuel 8 and7 it says he goes
[52:05] and he says and he tells God he says
[52:07] they have rejected me and and the word
[52:10] that you've given me to give them and
[52:12] God looks at him and says no don't worry
[52:14] about it it's not you that have rejected
[52:16] it's me that have rejected in other
[52:18] words the messenger and his own message
[52:21] was a direct mouthpiece of what God
[52:23] wanted to tell Israel to reject the
[52:26] message messenger is to reject the word
[52:28] of God that's been sent to
[52:31] you that's right to reject what he said
[52:35] to question the things that he has
[52:37] brought us is to question directly
[52:39] because what oh the understanding of
[52:42] what a prophet is I don't even want to
[52:44] go because we don't have time it's not
[52:46] that the prophet has his own word and he
[52:48] can come and explain the things we are
[52:51] told that these men were men of God that
[52:54] were moved by the spirit of God to say
[52:56] things even themselves could not
[52:58] understand but they would adorate and go
[53:01] back and hold their head and wonder what
[53:03] did I just
[53:05] say man that God will take a life and
[53:08] spread it and and and break it into
[53:11] pieces and CA want to go marry a
[53:13] prostitute and and do things that just
[53:16] doesn't make any sense those were the
[53:18] prophets of God so that they will come
[53:21] to a place when when they spoke it was
[53:23] the word of God what they breathed it
[53:26] was the word of God everything they say
[53:28] was a direct word from God to the people
[53:31] they didn't have any respect of any
[53:33] Kings or for any
[53:35] man and to reject him was to reject the
[53:39] word of God so he says here he says that
[53:43] if any man this is in the message a man
[53:45] running from the presence of God if any
[53:47] man if any young man
[53:49] looks and he's looking for a wife to be
[53:52] married and here he stood here stood a
[53:55] girl that every that that meets every
[53:57] qualification and I thought and and that
[54:01] and qualification that I thought it
[54:03] would make it will make a woman it says
[54:07] why normally uh she was a queen lovely
[54:10] fine personality real Christian
[54:13] everything that could that you could
[54:14] think of to make a good wife he says no
[54:18] matter how much I say she's perfect
[54:21] she's ex she's exactly right she isn't
[54:24] mine till I accept her and the
[54:27] responsibility of being on my
[54:31] wife it's not once the responsibility is
[54:34] accepted and the person is accepted then
[54:37] that's when the qualification came it
[54:39] says that's the same thing with with
[54:41] with the same thing the message is you
[54:44] might say that's right it says this is
[54:47] right or the other and say I sympathize
[54:50] with it I believe it's the truth but
[54:52] you've got to accept it and it's got to
[54:55] become a part of you and you are part of
[54:59] it so you become one it's the bridegroom
[55:02] and the bride becoming one in other word
[55:04] whatever you say about it you're talking
[55:06] about me it's the little boy looking
[55:09] himself in the mirror I have seen myself
[55:11] I can't excape what I saw it's me in
[55:14] there and whatever it says I am you
[55:17] can't separate the two and and you a
[55:20] part of it it says when when when you
[55:23] marry a certain woman that you have
[55:25] chosen you are you are you are one then
[55:29] it says and that's the way you are you
[55:32] are with Christ when you see him
[55:35] manifested and made real then you are
[55:38] part of him he is part of you and
[55:41] together you are part of the
[55:46] message the message is not some
[55:49] understanding or some
[55:50] theological understanding that we can
[55:52] come in and debate upon we are the
[55:56] message who could put a collection of
[55:59] people from different countries from
[56:01] different background as diverse as this
[56:04] who could do that who could come and and
[56:07] speak a word that would reach somebody
[56:09] from Asia from Africa from Europe from
[56:12] America and bring them into the same
[56:15] understanding and mold their life to
[56:17] where whatever this life is speaking
[56:19] this one is believing whatever is
[56:21] happening here it's the same life it's
[56:23] the same heartbeat the same God moving
[56:26] in all of them you couldn't do that with
[56:28] science you couldn't do that with
[56:34] education so I thought that just spoke
[56:36] to me this morning and and so I just
[56:38] want to get to my my text just for a few
[56:41] minutes we're not going to be too long
[56:43] tonight because we have communion uh as
[56:46] we read the scripture in Luke uh I want
[56:49] to speak but when I'm preach this
[56:51] message I thought it would just go uh so
[56:53] very much along uh with what we we heard
[56:56] this morning and the title of the
[56:59] message is Jesus keeps all his
[57:02] appointments Jesus keeps all is
[57:05] appointment and and that just rejoices
[57:08] my soul because I know there's no
[57:10] appointment that he won't come that he
[57:12] won't me and when you speak about
[57:13] appointment it speaks about an the
[57:16] definition goes to speak about
[57:17] engagement or a meeting or something
[57:20] that is's PL to do something that he
[57:22] wants to manifest something and we
[57:24] realize that that's what we are living
[57:26] living in that we live in the time where
[57:28] we have received an appointment this is
[57:31] that's why people getting confused
[57:33] because they failing to realize that
[57:35] what's happening today or the message
[57:37] itself is the Bible prophecy about the
[57:40] things that we're supposed to transpire
[57:42] in this time a pastor asked a question
[57:44] today can anybody look outside and say
[57:47] that this is not Sodom and gomorra can
[57:49] anybody look outside and say this is the
[57:52] Lan Church AG can anybody we look in the
[57:55] very message that we have received it
[57:57] speaks to us clearly of the condition
[58:00] that's happening out there to show us
[58:02] that God has made his appointment for
[58:05] this time God has come and made his
[58:07] appointment for this time and and so and
[58:11] and brother talks about how it don't
[58:13] matter who you are it don't matter what
[58:15] your background is if you make an
[58:17] appointment with him he'll come and meet
[58:19] you right in fact the scripture tells us
[58:23] that it's appointed to man wants to to
[58:25] live and then die and then after we die
[58:27] we have an appointment with him and so
[58:30] the prophet tells us that it's so
[58:31] important that we set up the appointment
[58:34] in this end so that when we go over
[58:36] there that we already settle everything
[58:38] here we want to make an appointment with
[58:41] him here so that our sin may go before
[58:43] us so we can confess and and say all
[58:46] that we done wrong and receive his life
[58:49] so that that appointment will be a
[58:51] joyous appointment but when I'm speaks
[58:53] in the message conference with God it
[58:55] says that Every Man Has a right to a
[58:58] conference with
[58:59] him and and I just want to just touch on
[59:03] what we the story we read if Simon who
[59:06] was inviting him in order to ridicu him
[59:11] to make fun of him to call him a false
[59:14] prophet to expose him if he would invite
[59:18] him and Jesus will stand up and show up
[59:21] for the appointment if the devil will
[59:24] come before God and talk to him about
[59:27] Job make an appointment with God and
[59:30] show up and talk to him about Job how
[59:32] much more a son and a daughter of God
[59:34] tonight we don't we fail to realize just
[59:37] all the opportunity and the benefits
[59:40] that we have in
[59:41] him if if those will come and they will
[59:45] with the need to destruct and with the
[59:47] need to destroy and everything they will
[59:49] make an appointment with him and he'll
[59:50] show up how much more you and I
[59:54] tonight so he comes com in and he meets
[59:57] all his appointment butam says in the
[59:59] message the unwelcome chrisis says Jesus
[1:00:02] is here tonight just keep he says Jesus
[1:00:05] keeps all his appointment no matter no
[1:00:08] matter how you are how or where you are
[1:00:11] he keeps all his appointment he keeps
[1:00:13] all his appointment with Jonah in the
[1:00:15] belly of the well he kept his
[1:00:17] appointment with Daniel in the Lion's
[1:00:20] then he kept his appointment with the
[1:00:22] with the Hebrews children in the F in
[1:00:24] the uh furnace it says uh uh praise God
[1:00:29] he keeps his appointment with me at the
[1:00:32] death bed he says and is here tonight
[1:00:36] where two or three are gathered together
[1:00:38] in my name I'll will be in the midst
[1:00:42] Jesus keeps his appointment always he's
[1:00:45] leaving Glory here in a little in a
[1:00:48] little he's leaving the glory maybe a
[1:00:50] little early so he can be here on time
[1:00:54] oh my what what privilege do we have as
[1:00:57] Sons and Daughters of God where we can
[1:00:59] pick up the phone and ring and it will
[1:01:01] be on the other end to just hear our
[1:01:04] prayers and our concerns and whatever
[1:01:06] needed I I tell you we need to get in
[1:01:08] the practice of calling him up and and
[1:01:11] just to ring him up and find out how
[1:01:13] he's doing and and talk to him a little
[1:01:16] bit and I tell you remove the confusion
[1:01:18] about the message being true or not true
[1:01:21] because at that time you know him and he
[1:01:23] himself and you've come in contact and
[1:01:26] he talk to you and and you won't need
[1:01:28] anybody to tell you whether is is a real
[1:01:31] or is not real because you yourself have
[1:01:33] met him and talk to him I tell you when
[1:01:36] our Trouble Comes our way or whatever
[1:01:38] the need is you got to pick up your
[1:01:39] phone and call because he's over there
[1:01:42] on the other side waiting for you and
[1:01:45] brother bam says I want you to imagine
[1:01:47] how busy he could
[1:01:49] be but there's not an appointment you
[1:01:52] can make and it will turn you down but
[1:01:55] talks about how he met him in the wood
[1:01:57] it says I took a pen and a paper and I
[1:01:59] wrote and I went and I stick it up on
[1:02:01] the tree and I thought I call him out
[1:02:04] and and he said and and and and things
[1:02:06] like that and then he says he didn't
[1:02:08] know how to pray and everything and he
[1:02:10] says Mr Jesus I want to talk to
[1:02:13] you he didn't even know the proper uh uh
[1:02:17] uh religious way to approach but he
[1:02:20] called him up and he says the most
[1:02:22] wonderful thing is he came and he talked
[1:02:25] to him
[1:02:26] but yet there are sons and daughters
[1:02:28] that have not ring up a phone for a
[1:02:30] while they're just busy with their own
[1:02:32] world and busy and and Jesus is waiting
[1:02:35] for his appointment waiting for you to
[1:02:38] call
[1:02:40] amen it says so find out that's he has a
[1:02:46] uh uh he always meets his appointment
[1:02:48] and and brother bam talks about this and
[1:02:51] and I'll just jump quickly as we move to
[1:02:54] along uh and he's presenting this in in
[1:02:57] in some form in paragraph 45 he says I
[1:03:01] I'm making this a little drama for
[1:03:02] everybody so they can catch it so he
[1:03:05] just dramatizes the story for a little
[1:03:07] bit just for the sake of understanding
[1:03:10] and and he talks about how uh there
[1:03:12] could have been this young man who who
[1:03:14] who was sent to go and deliver the
[1:03:17] invitation and and no doubt at that time
[1:03:20] you know they didn't have internet or or
[1:03:22] phone or whatever you may call it no
[1:03:24] Facebook and no uh uh Twitter No status
[1:03:28] check on online and everything and and
[1:03:31] so he must have went different places
[1:03:33] perhaps he went to capernum they said oh
[1:03:36] well it was here three days
[1:03:38] ago because news was basically just you
[1:03:41] asking people in the street have you
[1:03:43] seen such and such no you continue to go
[1:03:46] well you know the last time we heard it
[1:03:47] was over here and then you go and so
[1:03:49] this young man he goes and works so hard
[1:03:52] and he goes and finally he's able to
[1:03:54] track him down and and he comes and it
[1:03:58] says says perhaps it was just right
[1:04:00] after meeting and he had just preached
[1:04:01] and he was just sitting there tired all
[1:04:04] sweated up and you know just a little
[1:04:06] thirsty and tired and sitting right
[1:04:08] there and the young man comes and said
[1:04:10] oh perhaps Philip came and says well you
[1:04:12] know the meeting is over you can't talk
[1:04:13] to him and you know he's just preach and
[1:04:16] he's tired just leave him rest for a
[1:04:17] little he said well you know I have a a
[1:04:19] very important message for him and and I
[1:04:22] was sent by one of the high priests and
[1:04:23] he wants to meet him and everything and
[1:04:26] and you know so they came and they let
[1:04:27] him in and and Jesus took the time to
[1:04:30] see him what a
[1:04:32] gentleman regardless of how tired he was
[1:04:35] he was never too busy to pick up your
[1:04:37] phone or to answer your message or to
[1:04:40] talk to you he came and he sat down and
[1:04:44] and so he said well you know my master
[1:04:46] is organizing a feast and he wants to
[1:04:48] see you and everything and he came and
[1:04:51] and Jesus looked at it and he said for a
[1:04:53] while he looked at it he said tell you
[1:04:55] master I'll be there oh the young man's
[1:04:59] heart was so joyful oh he accepted the
[1:05:03] invitation and he ran out but when I'm
[1:05:05] asked the question it says oh what an
[1:05:08] opportunity this young man missed he
[1:05:11] came face to face with
[1:05:13] Jesus and all he was caught up in was
[1:05:16] the message that he was sent to deliver
[1:05:19] all he was caught up in was oh I got to
[1:05:21] go my master sent me oh if we could just
[1:05:24] ask for an audience even if minute and
[1:05:26] say master remember me I have a I have
[1:05:29] trouble and I need you to touch me I
[1:05:31] need my sins to be forgiven I need
[1:05:33] Deliverance for one minute his life
[1:05:36] would have been changed oh I tell you
[1:05:38] when I heard that my heart sink and
[1:05:40] because we don't want to make Church com
[1:05:42] in a tradition where we come in we know
[1:05:45] there's a song leader there's a pastor
[1:05:47] and we come and we just sing and we we
[1:05:49] hear the word and we go back no we're
[1:05:52] coming into the presence of the Living
[1:05:55] God he said it were two or three I got
[1:05:58] I'll be in the midst so we walking into
[1:06:01] his presence whatever you have need of
[1:06:03] make it known to
[1:06:06] him brothers and sisters these churches
[1:06:09] will be closed we know that but we want
[1:06:11] to use of make use of every opportunity
[1:06:15] every time we ring up his phone to make
[1:06:17] known unto him our needs and and and to
[1:06:20] to just take a moment for you to speak
[1:06:22] to
[1:06:23] him this young man
[1:06:26] missed a really big opportunity it just
[1:06:29] came in and he was caught up and Bam
[1:06:32] says that's the same church somewhere
[1:06:34] with the church people get caught up in
[1:06:36] the system and you know our church is
[1:06:39] bigger than yours and our music is
[1:06:41] better than you guys is and you know we
[1:06:43] just come and this is how we do things
[1:06:45] and and the moment somebody does
[1:06:47] something different all eyes are on him
[1:06:50] and you know because we have we've built
[1:06:53] a tradition we've made we've created
[1:06:56] what's acceptable and what's not it's no
[1:06:59] longer uh the spirit of God moving into
[1:07:01] your heart for you to do things that are
[1:07:03] according to the word of God but it's oh
[1:07:06] what does everybody do before I can
[1:07:08] follow that's not how he's wanting us to
[1:07:10] be he want as a people that are led by
[1:07:13] his word that speaks his word and that
[1:07:16] wants to reach out and touch him I have
[1:07:18] a need and I'm touching you
[1:07:20] tonight that's the kind of people is
[1:07:22] looking and and so find out it wasn't it
[1:07:26] strange this Pharisees that hated him
[1:07:29] the most that wanted to kill him
[1:07:32] plotting to kill him every day yeah they
[1:07:34] are inviting him to a
[1:07:39] fist he knew they were going to make fun
[1:07:41] of him but he went anyway you see he was
[1:07:46] feeling sorry for them because they just
[1:07:48] never had an eyesight to understand what
[1:07:50] was
[1:07:51] happening it was never about himself it
[1:07:55] was always is about what he can extend
[1:07:57] the grace of God what his mission was
[1:08:00] someone who lived by the word of the
[1:08:03] father someone who took his life and
[1:08:05] placed it in the hand of God and and he
[1:08:07] knew that whatever happened to me is
[1:08:10] according to the will of my father I'm
[1:08:12] here to do my father's business and not
[1:08:14] my own so he stands up and he goes and
[1:08:18] and he goes and and and he finally takes
[1:08:20] the invitation and he goes so this young
[1:08:23] man misses his opportunity so when he
[1:08:25] gets
[1:08:27] there they he talks about the road's
[1:08:30] condition how that there's all kinds of
[1:08:33] things happening the animal uh uh uh uh
[1:08:36] uh uh faces and all the things and the
[1:08:38] dust and everything how that it's a
[1:08:40] tradition that when you get there they
[1:08:43] wash your feet and and they anoint it
[1:08:45] with oil they wipe it and they anoint it
[1:08:47] with oil and they take your beard they
[1:08:49] groom it and and they groom it all
[1:08:51] nicely and put it with oil and so that
[1:08:54] you can go and grease
[1:08:56] and and and then be kissed by the host
[1:08:58] he comes and he talks about how Jesus
[1:09:01] went and he showed up and they watch him
[1:09:04] just sited
[1:09:06] there no greetings
[1:09:09] nothing people enjoying their own
[1:09:12] programs and and and it says that Feast
[1:09:14] already started they were drinking and
[1:09:16] they were talking and everything and yet
[1:09:18] they watch him just sit there they watch
[1:09:21] him just sit there and as he sat
[1:09:24] there says and then we find out that in
[1:09:27] the alley there was this young woman
[1:09:29] whose heart was beating and she came and
[1:09:32] she noticed the streets were pretty
[1:09:33] quiet and nobody in the streets and she
[1:09:36] goes out and and she finds out that
[1:09:38] there was a a a reception and something
[1:09:41] going on at the house of Simon and she
[1:09:44] came and then she was walking by because
[1:09:46] that's where the attraction was she
[1:09:48] notices Jesus sitting there with dirty
[1:09:52] feet you know I begin to think if we've
[1:09:56] allowed him to have dirty
[1:09:59] feet you know God in our lives is there
[1:10:03] for us to worship him to praise
[1:10:05] him is there for us to give him all that
[1:10:09] we
[1:10:09] are is there for us to do all that we
[1:10:13] can so he could be he can feel welcome
[1:10:16] is there so we can give all that we are
[1:10:19] the best that we are to
[1:10:22] him but often time he's left over to the
[1:10:25] side we have our jobs and we have our
[1:10:28] families we have this and this after
[1:10:30] we've done everything then we turn back
[1:10:33] to him to try to talk to
[1:10:35] him he comes and this young woman comes
[1:10:39] and and she comes and she sees she
[1:10:42] notices that his feet are not washed and
[1:10:45] so she stood there and she noticed
[1:10:47] everybody's feet is Washed by his
[1:10:50] something within our heart began to beat
[1:10:53] and begin to pump but yet there's a
[1:10:56] great battle within her Minds because
[1:10:59] she's wanting to go but something within
[1:11:01] her is reminding her of her own life you
[1:11:04] you look at you and look at the kind of
[1:11:06] life you're living and you can't go
[1:11:09] there you're not fit to be there and
[1:11:11] that's not your place and all those
[1:11:12] things and and but yet she's sing there
[1:11:15] and and just trying to figure out how do
[1:11:17] I get in how do I what do I do I can't
[1:11:21] just sit him uh sit here or stand here
[1:11:23] watching him sit there with the feet
[1:11:26] unwashed but R makes this statement that
[1:11:29] just touched my heart it says that for
[1:11:31] whatever battle she had in her mind
[1:11:34] something within her heart just wanted
[1:11:35] to serve God she just wanted to do
[1:11:38] something so she ran out and she went
[1:11:41] and got all the money that she had and
[1:11:44] she went and bought this perfume and she
[1:11:46] run back now
[1:11:48] remember before you can get in there's a
[1:11:51] process you have to have an invitation
[1:11:55] you you have to be checked your feet
[1:11:56] have to be washed and everything had to
[1:11:59] be done before you can get in but makes
[1:12:01] a statement it says but if you want to
[1:12:04] serve God God will make a way for you to
[1:12:07] get
[1:12:09] in if we have it in our hearts to serve
[1:12:12] him if we want to give him all our best
[1:12:15] God has a way and I want to say this
[1:12:17] it's not the way that we have made it's
[1:12:20] the way that he has
[1:12:22] made I want to even say about this woman
[1:12:26] I want to say this you know often time
[1:12:28] we talk about even about the woman at
[1:12:30] the well how she came and she began to
[1:12:32] talk about Jesus because that was also
[1:12:35] another appointment she began to talk
[1:12:37] about how they worship and how those
[1:12:39] worshippers worship uh uh we worship in
[1:12:41] Jerusalem and how those others do Jesus
[1:12:44] looked at him and says The Hours come
[1:12:47] where the true worshippers is worship in
[1:12:49] truth and and in spirit and in truth now
[1:12:53] I want to say this Jesus Jesus is not
[1:12:55] looking for worship for something that
[1:12:58] he didn't do that's the
[1:13:00] devil God is Not Looking for worship
[1:13:04] outside of his word God Is Made A Way
[1:13:08] the scripture says that God has made a
[1:13:10] way is looking for people that are going
[1:13:12] to worship him for what God has done in
[1:13:15] your life for what God is doing in your
[1:13:18] life for how he got you out of sin and
[1:13:21] what he done for you and how he saved
[1:13:24] you how we delivered you that's the kind
[1:13:27] of worship is looking for and he himself
[1:13:30] he making those
[1:13:33] worshippers it's a people that have
[1:13:36] received something like brother Mike
[1:13:38] said it this morning there's a people
[1:13:40] all they looking for is just to reflect
[1:13:43] back to him oh God I'm one that you
[1:13:46] saved I was a sinner I I I just was in
[1:13:49] the world I didn't even know who you
[1:13:51] were but you came down my way and you
[1:13:54] saved my life
[1:13:55] and I'm here to let the people know that
[1:13:57] you are a wonderful
[1:14:01] God so she came and she find a way to
[1:14:05] get in how did she pass the people who
[1:14:07] were checking the invitation only God
[1:14:10] knows how did she went past the people
[1:14:12] that were uh uh setting up all the
[1:14:14] things only God
[1:14:16] knows she comes and she begins to was
[1:14:19] his
[1:14:20] feet and before she got in there she
[1:14:22] said within herself
[1:14:26] he will
[1:14:27] know what I am and where I got this
[1:14:35] money you know that that speaks
[1:14:38] volume it it's not about the challenges
[1:14:41] that goes within your
[1:14:44] head it's not about the challenges that
[1:14:46] you have to overcome within your mind
[1:14:49] all those battles it's about what's
[1:14:51] beating in your heart to
[1:14:53] do what is it in your heart to do for
[1:14:56] him because at the end of the day
[1:14:59] regardless of what level you are in
[1:15:02] there's always going to be a mind battle
[1:15:04] but what counts is what's within your
[1:15:06] heart to do for
[1:15:09] him so he gets in and he began to wash
[1:15:12] his
[1:15:14] feet and Bam says he knew that if you
[1:15:18] just move his foot just a little bit she
[1:15:21] would run
[1:15:22] off it just stays still and it move for
[1:15:25] a
[1:15:27] second she let him serve
[1:15:30] him brother and sister I want to just
[1:15:32] say
[1:15:33] this perhaps on the planet right now
[1:15:36] there's nobody who can worship God like
[1:15:38] the people that have received this
[1:15:41] message to think about the treasure that
[1:15:44] we have received and even how people are
[1:15:47] calling it all kinds of names we are the
[1:15:51] best worshiper that could be on this
[1:15:53] planet why are we running away what are
[1:15:56] we not running to him and just sit there
[1:15:59] and let our tears let our life let
[1:16:02] everything know we all just worship Him
[1:16:04] Just Praise Him Just Praise Him what an
[1:16:07] opportunity we've been given to be
[1:16:10] called The Bride of Jesus Christ let me
[1:16:12] tell you this this message is not for
[1:16:15] everybody and if that hurts your feeling
[1:16:17] I'm sorry this message is for a selected
[1:16:21] group in particular hand ped group of
[1:16:24] people people that God has chosen on the
[1:16:27] face of the Earth it's not by
[1:16:30] understanding it's not by education but
[1:16:33] it's a people that God himself chose
[1:16:35] before the foundation to be as members
[1:16:38] of the
[1:16:39] Bride it's not for everybody If somebody
[1:16:43] walks away from it it was not for him
[1:16:45] God bless him but we that have received
[1:16:48] it that we know that we can't run away
[1:16:51] from it I tell you when those people are
[1:16:53] going away we should be standing up and
[1:16:56] giving him the best worship that he
[1:16:57] deserve like no man can offer
[1:17:05] it he says
[1:17:07] that Simon
[1:17:09] noticed it says we got him yeah I told
[1:17:14] you he was a false prophet now remember
[1:17:17] he said within his heart if this man
[1:17:20] only knew what that woman
[1:17:22] is he would have not even let her touch
[1:17:25] her
[1:17:28] feet and Jesus waited until the woman
[1:17:31] was
[1:17:34] done he said
[1:17:36] Simon I have something to
[1:17:39] say and I believe he commands attention
[1:17:42] when he
[1:17:43] speaks it
[1:17:45] says there are two debtors one of them
[1:17:48] owed more and the others order little
[1:17:50] and they were forgiven who do you think
[1:17:53] will will be happiest the most he says
[1:17:58] logically speaking it would seem like
[1:18:00] the one that owed more they said that's
[1:18:03] right he said Simon you invited
[1:18:07] me I came I honored your invitation and
[1:18:11] I showed
[1:18:13] up but I showed up you didn't wash my
[1:18:16] feet you didn't give me oil even to put
[1:18:19] then grew my beard you didn't even give
[1:18:21] me a
[1:18:22] kiss but this woman
[1:18:26] since I walked in has not ceased to do
[1:18:29] those things I tell you my brother my
[1:18:32] sister when people are rejecting this
[1:18:35] message and calling it all kinds of
[1:18:37] names and want to expose it so to speak
[1:18:41] want to expose the error so to speak God
[1:18:44] has predestinated a bride this woman was
[1:18:48] a predestinated woman she didn't she
[1:18:52] woke up she started walking up the
[1:18:55] aisles not knowing where she was going
[1:18:57] she didn't understand what was happening
[1:19:00] she got hungry she didn't know just like
[1:19:02] the prophet in Memphis the plane got
[1:19:04] grounded and he just began to walk the
[1:19:06] AL not knowing it's the same exact God
[1:19:09] and it's the same exact thing why
[1:19:11] because there was a specific woman that
[1:19:14] God intended that when Simon turned him
[1:19:17] down and turned the opportunity to
[1:19:19] worship him that this woman will show up
[1:19:22] and worship him oh I tell you it's not
[1:19:24] different from the end time when people
[1:19:27] rejected this message and they call it
[1:19:29] all kinds of name there was a woman a
[1:19:32] bride predestinated bride who's been
[1:19:35] sent to wash Jesus feet at the very end
[1:19:37] of
[1:19:39] it let's not miss our opportunities
[1:19:43] let's not miss what we have been given I
[1:19:46] don't care if everybody uh call this
[1:19:48] message of the devil there's something
[1:19:50] within my heart that will not give up I
[1:19:53] Want To Worship
[1:19:55] Jesus if I had 10,000 lives I worship
[1:19:59] him oh I tell you and often time I feel
[1:20:02] so small by the things that sometimes we
[1:20:05] get caught up within but my heart desire
[1:20:07] is with every bit of strength that I
[1:20:10] have that I may show and worship this
[1:20:13] Christ not just any Christ the revealed

[1:24:59] I
[1:25:01] amen I I enjoyed that
[1:25:04] tonight you know what struck my heart
[1:25:06] the most is when brother Billy said God
[1:25:10] made his
[1:25:13] Believers amen he made you by what he
[1:25:17] done for you can't take that
[1:25:20] out
[1:25:23] amen and anybody that's ever had that
[1:25:26] they're joined in a
[1:25:28] union that that's
[1:25:33] infallable and I I just love that so
[1:25:35] much if you have your
[1:25:38] Bibles the deacons who are to serve can
[1:25:41] go get ready I I just think that if I
[1:25:45] was
[1:25:47] to have anything to add I would just say
[1:25:50] it's time for us to get about our
[1:25:52] father's business
[1:25:55] amen it's time to forget the critics and
[1:25:59] we know they're there and I felt led to
[1:26:02] address the situation because of having
[1:26:07] the minister in my Pulpit but I think
[1:26:11] there's another great scripture it says
[1:26:14] leave those things which are behind
[1:26:16] behind and press for a higher calling
[1:26:19] amen let's press to have an atmosphere
[1:26:22] that people can walk into the Pres pres
[1:26:24] of God and know they have hope to be
[1:26:27] healed they know they have hope to be
[1:26:30] delivered know that there's a presence
[1:26:33] here that is welcoming that offers to
[1:26:37] them every promise in this book without
[1:26:41] prejudice without fear without hope
[1:26:45] that's standing shoulder toosh shoulder
[1:26:47] with Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:26:50] today ever back and pray for every
[1:26:52] Minister that St stands and asks for the
[1:26:55] great blessings of God if we'll
[1:26:59] we'll uh turn over to the book of
[1:27:02] Corinthians and the 11th chapter of the
[1:27:06] book of Corinthians
[1:27:09] and Paul bringing to the
[1:27:14] church a
[1:27:16] communion and it's amazing when you read
[1:27:19] these scriptures about communion and you
[1:27:21] read these scriptures about footwash
[1:27:24] you read the scriptures about baptism
[1:27:27] it's amazing how many Christians today
[1:27:30] don't take
[1:27:31] communion they don't wash
[1:27:34] feet and and yet it it's such a glorious
[1:27:39] blessing that comes with
[1:27:43] it and this is Paul for I have received
[1:27:46] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:27:49] unto
[1:27:51] you that the Lord Jesus the Same night
[1:27:54] in which he was betrayed took
[1:27:57] bread 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter the
[1:28:00] 23rd
[1:28:02] verse now the 24th verse and when he had
[1:28:06] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:28:11] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:28:16] you this do in remembrance of me and
[1:28:21] after the same manner also he took the
[1:28:25] cup when he had SED saying this cup is
[1:28:29] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:28:34] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:28:37] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:28:41] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:28:44] Lord's death till he
[1:28:47] come wherefore whosoever shall eat of
[1:28:50] this bread and drink of this cup of the
[1:28:53] Lord worthy shall be guilty of the body
[1:28:56] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:28:59] examine
[1:29:01] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:29:05] and drink of that
[1:29:07] cup what a beautiful examining message
[1:29:10] we had this evening but let a man
[1:29:13] examine
[1:29:17] himself let's say that again but let a
[1:29:20] man examine
[1:29:22] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:29:25] and drink of that cup for he that eateth
[1:29:29] and drinketh unworthy eateth and
[1:29:31] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:29:33] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:29:37] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:29:39] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:29:42] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:29:46] when we are judged we are chasen of the
[1:29:48] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:29:52] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:29:55] when you come together to eat carry one
[1:29:58] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:30:02] him eat at home that you come not
[1:30:05] together un condemnation and the rest
[1:30:08] will I set in order when I
[1:30:12] come amen God richly bless
[1:30:15] you amen let's stand as we pray
[1:30:26] you all join in
[1:30:29] prayer once again there's healing in
