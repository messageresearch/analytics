Description:
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Be Certain of God
Wednesday Evening Service: October 21,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is what i call it [Music] you could have a cold you could have a regular ordinary flu you could have an allergy but everything nowadays is clumped into one big disease so everybody if you're sick you're sick you're only sick with one thing so just to be safe what we'd like to do is just take these next four services off not off but have live stream you can still support the church online or you can mail your offering or whatever you want to do to keep us running financially or you can just hold it over until we come back again but don't forget us and so we're just going to do that and then you look at yourselves watch yourselves if you're still feeling good you haven't come down sick with anything then everybody's just safe so i think that's the best approach we have just clip it in the bud don't let anything spread through the congregation uh the couple of people that have tested positive they they're a hundred percent they don't have any uh symptoms whatsoever i think they call that being asymptomatic so we just wanted to take control of it real early put an end to it don't let it spread anybody that's sick can run their course and you just watch yourself over the next two weeks and if everybody's fine and we don't have a any type of outbreak or a lot of people coming down sick the people that are sick now will be better by then and then we can be able to come back together it's very difficult on me to make these decisions but i really do it with in my heart what i feel is best for the body best for our reputation uh best for our due diligence and uh so we know the lord's been merciful and gracious to us and he's just showered us with blessings so we're thankful to him and we commit everything into his hands so i hope you understand remember if you have any questions feel free to call me the children's sunday school will outing which was planned for the 31st that will be postponed uh one weekend i believe till november 7th so we're not going to do it on the 31st we're going to do the young sunday school age outing on the 7th i think the youth get together on the 30th i believe that will be the same i'm not sure on the date on that but so that's what we are and we're back to preaching to an invisible congregation but the holy spirit's invisible amen but yet we know that he's here because we see the results and the sign of his presence we don't see jesus christ in the physical but yet we know when he comes by because people are made well people are delivered people are uplifted because our god lives so lord richly bless you tonight we're going to ask cosman to come and sing and there's no congregation to cover his singing up so i but i know it's good so worship at home be a part of god's plan at home and november 1st we'll gather back together in the framework of our sanctuary but right now let's gather together around god's word and worship in the name of the lord jesus in the presence of his spirit so let's bow our heads as we turn our service over our gracious heavenly father brother billy's going to minister the word to us tonight father [Music] lord there's nobody here but just a few of us to operate the mechanics there's no one to hear to pull in person but father we can pull where we're sitting online we can pull with our prayers and our heart in feasting at the work and father i ask that with no visible pull from the people but that he could feel the push of your holy spirit he can just feel the word just move through him though it might appear that he's preaching to empty walls may he know that your spirit can move on the hearts of the people [Music] that you can perform monday wonderful works mighty works father wonderfully performed by the movement of your presence in the ministering of your word we invite you father into this time of decision lord if we not make the correct one we certainly ask you to forgive us and we trust father that even that our permissive will that you allow us that you will mightily work it father towards your perfect will and that all things will work together for the good to them that are called and elected according to your purpose bless us father we ask you not to forsake us but ever to be gracious to us bless each listener this evening and father we just extend your invitation to come in our presence we ask these things in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen god bless you join in because brother cosman comes [Music] hey man god bless you i would [Music] testing [Music] hello there we are i would say uh to be seated but since we don't have anybody in the congregation you guys could be sitting at home god bless you let's just praise the lord this evening and even though we're home we can still worship the lord and be in one mind and one accord it's what the bible says and i know god will hear every voice singing behind the scenes amen let's start singing with that song uh he set me free in the key of g once like a bird in prison i dwelt amen once like a bird in prison i dwelled oh no freedom from my sorrow i fell glory to god he set me free he set me free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me i'm glory bound

free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me i'm glory bound my jesus to see glory to god he set me free i'm rejoicing night and day as i walked a narrow way as the comforter and now and now i see and the reason for my bliss yes the secret all is this that the comforter abides with me he abides here [Music] abides with me once my heart was full of sin once i had no peace with him till i heard how jesus died upon the tree then i fell down at his feet and there came a piece so sweet now the comforter abides with me i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the narrow way for the comforter abides with me he's with me everywhere and he knows my every care i'm as happy as a bird and just as free for the spirit has control jesus satisfies my soul since the comforter abides with

home um we have a prayer request here from brother manuel reho and he's asking for prayer as well as he's not feeling well so we know it's the flu season and there's a lot of things going around but we know a god that just could deliver every sickness even though it's a flu or whatever it may be and we just trust in the lord that everybody will just end up being well and and return back to church together and amen um if you have a prayer request for the next few services you're more than welcome to write the church on email uh either text by the billy or text brother david and we could read

desire tonight and as we gather in his presence amen you know we we live in a changing world changing circumstances you walk up one day it's one thing you walk up another is another thing but one thing we know for sure is we're an unchanging god amen as scripture says heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away and that's where we put our comfort tonight to know that we serve a god who doesn't change amen if you could just open your bibles we'll read a scripture quickly so we can get to our text uh first king chapter 17. uh we're going to read verse 1 through 16. it says first kings chapter 17 it says and elijah the tishbite who was uh who was offered the inhabitants of gilgad said unto ahab as as the lord that as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be a dew no rain these these years but according to my word and the word of god and the word of the lord came unto him saying get the hands and turn eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherub cherith and that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i will i have commanded the ravens to feed there to feed thee there so he went and did according to the word of the lord for he went and dwelt in the brook cherith and before that is before jordan and the raven brought him bright and and and fresh and fit and flesh in the morning and bread and fresh in the evening he drank off the brook and it came to pass that after a while that the brook dried up because because there was there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to xeropath which belongs to c dot zedon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee let's just buy our heads gracious father we ask you bless us tonight we commit everything that we are to you and ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen just for a few minutes this is i know this is a very familiar story and scripture reading we're not going to try to be too long we're just going to say what we have on our heart um well for for this i i was listening to uh the message that run and preach be certain of god and that's where this thought just came to me i was just you know meditating on it and it came on my heart to just speak on that um and so as we read the scripture we realized even as i continue in first kings chapter 17 i believe in verse 14 13 it says and elijah went unto her speaking of the woman that he commanded for her for him to for her to feed him he says and he said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make make me before of the cake first and bring unto me and after make one for thee and thy son for thou saith the lord the god of israel the barrel of of mill shall not waste neither shall the cruce of oil fail until the day that the lord send it rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the word of the prophet she went and did according to the word uh according to the word saying of elijah and she and and and he and the and and her house it did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasn't wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah so verbatim makes this statement and i thought you know it was just at the very beginning he begins he reads this paragraph i'll just read and he says now now lord bless thy word as it goes forth and many uh many of the holy spirit captures our mind may the holy spirit capture our mind and our thoughts and prepare us for his visitation as we have asked of him for we do not come to the house of the lord to be seen or to see but to learn of thee and and that to know thy nature and thy ways that causes that we might be able to face the problems of life with the with the real assurance being certain of god so i just thought this spoke to me even in regards to everything to just know that we want to face the problems of life with the real assurance to be certain of god it says in the name of the lord jesus amen and i thought you know you think about what was happening at that time you think about the conditions and i thought you know brother brian i'm even describing this so in so eloquent words it says now elijah came and says that by the word of the lord it says i'll say it spoke to the king saying that there shall not be any rain according to my word because it was spoken of him to go and to speak to the king so we find out that those things happen and you begin to imagine what was the the time and the situation that was transpiring in that land because of lack of rain you realize that everything began to dry up you look at the condition it says it became a very uh hot time because there was no rain so there was dust everywhere i was thinking about the fruits that were close to maturity how that because of lack of rain they begin to dry up and they begin to just become very mediocre and everything you think about people in the land because we we live we know there's a principle that you plant and when you water the seed it's going to come out and people will rejoice and eat off the fruit of it but you realize that all of those things were were taken away they were not able to plant and to rip off the the the harvest of the hard work i began to think about even permanent i'm talking about a cactus you look at a plant that's supposed to be a beautiful flower but because his condition was changed and there was no water a plant that was supposed to be a beautiful flower began to change because things were no longer the same things changed the condition changed and that was apparent by everything that was around them they could walk around and begin to see that life was not the same as it used to be uh no doubt that they could have uh had some buckets of water or some containers places where they save water but as this began to go on and on they will go and use of that water and come to a place where they didn't have any more water and no doubt there were those that were crying because of famine and things and and you begin to realize it was such a a condition that was really bad we can even look at today the prophet looks at it and he picks it up he says that was kind of the condition things are changing things are not the same things are no longer reliable where they need to be and everything and and so i was looking at even the very definition of being certain it talks about to know for sure to be established beyond the doubt to come something that is unquestionable something that is sure something that is definite so you find out that it's in the times like that that somebody needs to be sure of what god is and who he is it's in the time where there is uncertainty where situation don't seem to be the same anymore where you know we live in the time where man has put all his confidence in science they're praying and wanting to see a solution come out and they putting all the goods they're putting all the eggs in one basket hoping that somebody will come up with the solution churches and everybody and they the church wall they're looking and and praying and hoping and and coming to a place and nothing is happening it's in that time that a true believer needs to know that there's a living god and the living god is about his own business is in the process of bringing his word to come to pass that we we we can come here tonight and those that are home and we can have an assurance that the things that are upon us those things didn't come upon us unaware these things were promised they will come these things are a prophecy that's coming to pass but we understand that in the same time there's always god always has a true believer who would stay with his word amen so we find out as we we just talked and and so they began to look at the situation and they began to realize that life was no longer the same and things were going to change forever they will never be the same like they were before but you realize that the the the reason why they got in the situation that they were in was because they rejected god they rejected the promises of god and they they had a king and and the scripture says that ahab was the most evil king that israel has ever had and the reason being because here is one who knew better about the word of god who was instructed and knew the ways of god there is one who comes and he goes out and marries uh uh the daughter of the king of tyra jezebel and he brings her into the kingdom and from there uh idolatry began to be introduced in israel it came to a place where uh they would worship the the unknown god and they will worship this god and they'll have all kinds of gods for everything and and and you cannot prevent them except statement you cannot displease god and keep on going in the same way and i hope nothing will happen the world cannot reject the word of god that was sent to them and expect to roll out with the programs and and to do to get married and to drink and to do all those things and continue on and think like life is going to go on no there is a creator of this earth he created it for a purpose he brought it here in order for him to achieve his purpose and once his purpose is done he will do away with all of it and those that are part of his program are going to be saved those that are going to be part of his program and he's doing and what he wants to do at the very end those are the only ones that are going to be saved and so so we find out when him speaks and i thought that's what's so wonderful he he speaks and and he begins to say he says what we need today is not a lot of material thing so we can come out because remember these people they knew better to serve god they knew better that there were a people that were given the name of god he called them and he says this was my people and and they were raised to be the people of god him the people that god himself put his name on them that all the nations will look at upon them as the standard that god wanted to elevate that those that will believe will be based upon what they see god do with this nation but yet there were with the king who didn't know who didn't obey anything of god they prabhanam says they came to a place where what the king said uh the priest looked at it and they followed through in other words what the government said and what the priest looked at and said well if the king said we're going to do this then we should be fine with it a believer doesn't do what the king says a believer has another king and that's jesus christ a believer has another king and that's the creator of heaven we only do what the word says we only do what god said and then from then on he began to talk about how the moral became to go down and all the situation began to deteriorate why because they elected the king and they enjoyed the things of the world and they thought by just coming and offering sacrifices that will be acceptable they taught the things that they can just comment and follow in this religious realm and and they thought that was acceptable god is not interested in our religion god is not interested in our gathering as people god is looking for spiritual sons and daughters those that will be led by his spirit those that will be led by him the holy spirit dwelling inside of them guiding them every day if you follow what politics says it will be one thing today will be another tomorrow if you follow what a man say they will tell you this today and tell you tomorrow oh but there's one when he says what he says is true for now till the end of time what he says is true and it will never change so he says here what we need is not material thing and i want to tell us what we need today is not somebody to come up with the vaccine because once we get the vaccine for this one when the next diseases will be in line for us to get another vaccine from another person and then if you give us another one when something else come we'll be in line waiting for that one person to do what we need today is not a stimulus they will give you one today next year you need another one but it says what we what we meet today is not material thing what we need today is the power of god to come into the church so we can become to a place where we are elevated and taken out of this earth where this world means absolutely nothing for us where we reject all the things of the world where our soul is in connection with the one who made us the one who sent us here where we could be in purpose for the father the things that he wants to see out of us where we are have nothing we have no agenda about what god desires to see out of us the thing that we get a fact is is when we find ourselves caught up in the things of the world caught up in this and caught up in that and because we are caught up we begin to innocent and want something good to come out of it because we have a hulk and we have this we have we are part of this program we are part of that program therefore the program has to work in order for us to be sustained oh but there's one program that works today and will work forever that's the program of god what we need today is not material thing we have that what we what he says we don't have we don't need the greater churches we don't need greater congregation we don't need more radio and tv television we don't need many and many more things of these things but what we need today what we need today to be spiritual to be to be spiritual is the person that will humble themselves before god if they don't have a penny they will they will pray till their spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of god oh i tell you our god is wonderful i tell you if there's a people in the midst of all of this that can just sit and begin to rejoice and begin to sing the presence of god it's the children of god why because the scripture tells us that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away my brother my sister if they give you a house today you will live and you'll live you'll go out of here and leave that house behind if you had all the lands you own it until you die if you had all the money you buy all the things that you want but you couldn't buy life but we have a god who's giving us eternal life i tell you this well from within me i begin to think about this thing this comes us and brings us to a place where we get to be so thankful about eternal life because you begin to realize after all this world is nothing after all this world it will go back from where it came from after all this world is nothing but death this world will offer nothing but death but we have eternal life in christ jesus and we can begin to rejoice in those things he says what we need in the spirit is to humble ourselves themselves before god even if it says if they don't have a penny and they will pray till the spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of god and a revival take place inside of the heart the change that that changes the attitude and the atmosphere that they live in it says you might not have a pair of shoes on your feet you might not dress you might you might be dressed in rags but something in your heart is singing the melody of god i'd rather have it i'd rather have it than all than all the money in the world so you don't say the natural things is always the signs that god is a blessing david spoke in uh uh david spoke that the lord he says that he had seen the wicked spread forth like a great uh bay tree he says but god asked him did you ever consider uh him at the end no matter how good of clothes we were how much we have to eat that isn't what we got that what goes in the presence of god this body that we have we we we dwell in perishes regardless how it be it will be taken care of but there's a soul that's in the man it's a condition that the spirit that must must that must move into the presence of the living god we need to move into that condition where we are moved into the presence of god it's like the tabernacle once you're still on the outside you're affected by the sunlight you're affected by the rain when you move into the holy place you are affected by the light about the candlesticks and all those things but god is calling his church to move into the holies of holies a place where sun like this is gonna not gonna affect us rain is not gonna affect us the kind of light is not gonna affect us what we are secured with him in that place whatever happens to in in the world we have a joy we have something within our heart that rejoices about the goodness of god why because we have seen him do according to his word [Music] god i'll say this god is not a guy who hides himself in in times of hard time and and like just left his children to fend for themselves no it's not that kind of god in fact it's a god who wants to see you in that condition so he himself can come and make himself known unto you and show you who he is he's the god who will let you try all that you want you go you do all that you want after you fail you come to realize where is your goodness coming from it's coming from him amen he says you find our prayer our prayer meetings are so weak just about a minute of prayer jump in bed and we find out we find that that happens about once twice a day when all when all of us are guilty our nation moral decay we've got billy graham and our robert everywhere but until they can they there comes a thirst in the heart of america to bring it back to a living god again by the living experience not some dead experience where we can come and say well you know i gave my heart to the lord and no no where you've come in contact with that goodness of god where you know i only live because he let me live i should have died i should have not been here the life that which i now live like paul said i live by the grace of god who loved me and you gave himself for me i know that from the way that i was growing the end of it was death i know from the things that i was doing the end of it was death but if i can stand here and speak to you i'm speaking from the goodness of god who loved me and gave me a chance for me to live this life and testify of his goodness everywhere and be a testimony for people to know that there is a living god that's the kind of experience he's looking for he's not looking for some educated punch that will just come and speak about what they know what they've learned out of the bible he wants to not just be the god of the bible but he wants to be your god one that you can speak to what did what where do you find him you find him in your closet on your knees you call upon his name and he comes and he talks to you now i'll say this this is just a foretaste of things to come we are promised the churches will be closed we are promised that persecution will come upon us we are promised that all those things will happen but how do we how do we save ourselves from all those things is to get into his presence to be satisfied like the prophet is talking about a soul that is satisfied with the goodness of god where you know it's not riches that i'm interested in it's not money that i'm interested in i'm interested in the goodness of god where i can look at myself and see that god is walking with me he says to bring it back to the living god the living experience to the undying faith in the living god we are only beating our brains out as it would say we would say out it says we might walk with our chest out without a collar turned turn turned in the back walk down the streets and and desire to be called doctor and reverend you might be pastor you might you you might pass to the greatest church that there is in the land you might be as pious as could be that man he says that no man can put a finger on your life but but until that soul that's on the inside of us is on fire for god is on fire for god it says until something in there that is yearning after him like that like the heart planet for the water brooks it says my soul thirsteth for thee oh god until we get to that type of experience i tell you we we so attached to the world we live in the world every day we communicate with it we touch it we through our five senses and all those things and if we are not careful it rubs off of us that's why we continually have to be washed by the water of the word but the soul when it comes to the end of it when it comes to the essence of who we are it has to be that soul that stands alone and desire god more than anything in the world so he speaks on it says he speaks on it says it talks about this woman as we read the condition of the people and and and and what random speaks and it continues on it speaks about how they came to a place where uh basically the the permanent speaks about this king ahab he says he came to a place where because he says in his reign that he had a greater army he had such a powerful army so he thought that god was with him and he said that people under his uh reign were prospering they were doing well they had all kinds of things that they desired they were prospering and that was an indication for him that they had god and then he says but yet within that condition they began to exalt those things and because they had goods because they had theirs it means god was with them and and that's why he makes that statement to say that just because you have worthly good it means absolutely nothing god is not with it's not with those that have not easy just the god who does that don't have he gives according to his will but is a god who protects his children they begin to elevate those things and before too long those things begin to take the place of god within their hearts and that's the challenge with a believer is we constantly have to come to a place if we are not careful the things of the world don't take the first place but ram says a man makes of everything an idol you makes your job an idol you makes a movie story in idol and we can say well i don't watch movie your job could be your idol and i began to think about this you know we come to the place if we're not careful we begin to elevate fear so much that we cannot operate until we feel like what we have to do has to go above our fears we elevate fear so much until we choke out the faith we don't give faith the room to operate we get to such a place where you know we have to touch it in order for us to believe it we have to see it with our eyes in order to believe it we have to come out in contact with it god is not called us to be that kind of people god has not called us to operate by the five senses of outside neither the five senses of the spirit god has called the people that would look at the situation when the senses tell them that this is impossible and they will acknowledge this is impossible but yet they will come to a place where they know that i have a god i have a faith within me that i have god who can move this mountain in front of me i have a god who can change the situation that i'm in i have a god who can blind the eyes like he did in the time of elijah i have a god who can open the right sea like he did with the children of israel i have a god who can bring healing whatever the need is god is here to bring it to pass if we elevate our fear where do we leave room for that faith to operate because remember during this condition where things seem to have been deteriorated in israel god had the sweeter woman and i was so struck how the the bible writes it now this woman was a widow woman and for all i know she was desperate she was a a woman she didn't have anybody to support her she had to do the best that she can to take care of her baby boy and she added everything and and and she was one who's in the position where they've lost somebody and and the part of them is hurting one who's in the position where they lack all the resources like to the other one and but yet brother the scripture is speaking where the bible says that god is telling his messenger that i have commanded a with a woman oh my i thought that just struck my heart when i read it i have commanded it with a woman and yet this widow woman sits here with no knowledge of what's happening about her with no knowledge of what god has been saying about her oh i tell you in this end time god has sent the people on earth they may look weak and they may look not strong and all those things but god has commanded them to manifest this word of the end time [Music] not because of our might not because of our strength but because it's the commandment from god so therefore when this messenger came and as she began to speak as he began to speak the word to her even after she came to a place he says it says give me water he says well you know water no doubt if i give him a cup i may have another two cup for me i'm not bored so we should be able to drink it and that's no problem and as you turn around to go get water it says the messenger said again it says as you go get me water make sure you bring me a muscle of bread oh that struck home that struck home you talk about reading the mind and reading the spirit that really touched home only she knew what was about to happen i'll tell you this she was cooking it to eat it so they can die she was ready and prepared to die but oh my god takes the very meal that they can eat and die he takes it and he turns it into a meal that produces life that's the kind of god we're serving he says you make it to me first you bring it to me first you just go and do as you said you've prepared it you've taken the the flour and you've mixed it with oil you've taken the word and mixed it with all you've done well and now you're about to put the fire off the holy spirit on it after you've done that don't take it for yourself bring it to me first and after i eat it according to the word of the living god oh i tell you that woman was a believer she didn't go and take half a cake and say well i'll give you half and keep half no she took it according to the word but madam says elijah obeyed the word the woman who paid the word oh you take two people there forbade the world come together something is bound to happen oftentimes we run into situations because we either don't obey what he's told us to do we either don't have the confidence to stay with what he's told us but oh if we can only stay with what he said if we can only take him by his word i'll tell you this it's in the uncertain time that you need to know that there's a living god the prophet speaks and he says he says he speaks about this woman he says oh how that little woman must have been must have been off her caliber of elijah so she takes the woman and elevates him on the caliber of elijah it says because why because usually your action shows who you are oh i thought that was so wonderful oh because your action shows who you are and again she had been chosen to entertain the prophet she was chosen for that purpose remember she was a gentile not a jew it says and the land was burning up and no doubt that that this little woman being of this caliber being a believer type for we see that god would not have called her if she was if she hadn't been uh worthy of the en to entertain the prophet for he would never send a prophet to to to a house that was unworthy it was not he uh if it was not his choosing it was god's choosing it wasn't her abiding in him it was god abiding in him he had been placed by the brook the raven with uh where were feeding him but when when by went to a believer of the same nature as of elijah she was a widow woman and we all know uh we all know what she a widow woman would have been with a went through with her husband dead and a young boy to raise oh i thought that was so wonderful it's not she it's not she that chose to be there it's god that shows her it's god that place said to the place that she was the role that she was playing in this plan of god it was a role that was given by god to her oh if we can only play the role that's been given to us we are not called to produce anything like our pastor said last sunday we are not called to produce or to manufacture something we are only called to believe the word and let god take that word and manifest it into our life the only thing we are called to do is to be obedient to the word that we have received oh i began to think yes the land that's dying and people are dying everywhere people screaming and all that does the head money the puppy had enough saved up where they could live and they were rejoicing within their homes because they had set up all that but yet all the people over here were suffering but in that situation god wanted to make sure that he has a witness on earth to show that his word was true god wanted to make sure that people knew that he was a living god god wanted us to use the scripture today and to sit here and quote off the bible and be reminded of the woman of saratha how that she believed and god came on the scene god wanted to make sure that people knew that he was a living god he was the one who had it all under his control nothing is out of cater he knows everything but what we need to do is to move in the holy of holiest place perhaps we stay too much on the outer court we've been affected by the sunlight and by the rain perhaps we've been affected by the candlesticks we've been affected by the lights and how the oil runs out and it goes down and we have to power it up and put more oil and turn it back on god wants us to move into that place it's remember it's the uncertain time that you need to make sure that there's a certain god but when i'm sad and then we find out that no doubt she went and prayed at night oh she went and prayed he said perhaps the barrel was full she kept praying that god will provide something before everything goes down and they said god just certainly kept looking and watching in her it says she prayed and the the flower kept going low the oil kept going low and she prayed that she prayed perhaps the night before she felt like she just needed to pray a little differently oh she prayed out and prayed and prayed it said because the night before he talks about how her son began to christ as mama i want to eat he says i know you're hungry but let's wait until the morning let's just wait until the morning perhaps god will do something it comes and she prays and nothing seems to happen oh my brother my sister it's in that time where you prayed where you've done all that god has required for you to do it's in the time where you've laid you've turned every stone down everything that he desires if we have sin we repent and if we're done wrong we go we do right when we've done all of those things and nothing seems to work that's when you need to know that god is certain god the scripture tells us that having done all that you could do to stand stand there for it says but you know it's just strange things it says may god let this soak into every one of you if you ever hear me preach again let this be a message it's strange most strange that that sometimes that god does things that way he says you know when we have confess our sins and meet every requirement that god requires we believe on god there's actually circumstances that has been circumstances that has been met and we've confessed our sin and made all the made all the wrong made all the wrongs and have have that we have did and write and and and done everything that we ought to do it says every requirement that god has made or ask we have met that requirement yet he lays silent he says he just don't answer us i'm sure i'm speaking to people this morning who have been to that place i wonder if you've been to that place tonight i wonder if you know what the messenger is talking about it says i've seen there many times myself it says i've went back and traced my life and turn over every stone and find out to find out what i've did wrong i've got to confess and say lord god it says i'll make it right and go and do so then come back right again and say now lord thou are god i will answer he says i will you will answer me surely i meant every request that you require me to do in every requirement i've met it and still it won't move it says it seems to sit silent when you've got to be it says that's when you've got to make sure that it is god don't be discouraged the only thing is that god is in your heart to be certain in your in in god it says my text today first is before we do is to be certain of god in your heart that's god and when you've met every requirement he says you've be you've got to be certain of god and says that faith goes to work right there faith stand steady for in those years the scripture says he that cometh to god must believe that he is that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him god wants to taste our faith to bring us to a place where that faith can be activated because remember if we if all the situations are just as they're supposed to be if everything is rolling out just the way we think it should be when is that faith gonna be activated so he can get to work when is our faith gonna grow so we can come to the maturity to confirm to you that god is god when is our faith gonna be tested i wanna say this we oftentimes we make a lot of claim that god is my god and god is my deliverer god is my healer god i tell you this there's not a statement we say that we're not going to be tested upon does not any confession we stand upon that we expect to just walk away and keep confessing and not planning for somebody to come and challenge you on it why because the devil is there to make sure that everything we say he challenges it to make sure that it's either god or it's not god that's where a true believer has to stand he says that that faith brings a showdown if you have met god's requirement that has been met you have fulfilled the con and considered and you have made done everything that god requires you to do then your faith rests right there your friend will stay right there and then he says then he is be certain and you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that god likes to see your reaction god likes to see his believers come to the place after everything has fallen apart after everything is gone being gone in the wrong direction he likes to see a people that will stand there and testify of his goodness and people that will come just like the hebrew boys i'll tell you this it's not the lack of confession they confess it's not the like of believing in what they say they believe in what they say but they their confession could not go unchallenged there was a king who heard it there was a people that heard it they called them to a task and he says if that's what you believe then we're gonna put you in the lake of fire and they said if that be the case we'll go into the fire we will not back down and yet they all they stood there and brahmana says that god watched until the very last minute and watched him oh we know how we dramatize it how different angels just wanted to come and blow the whole place away but it says no just let just watch and let's watch them oh perhaps they're within their hearts they begin to think is this really going to work is this really going to work but it was in the uncertain time a time where everything seems to have been challenged that's when something within the heart spoke up and say that even if he doesn't save us even if he doesn't deliver us from this fire we will not back down that's the kind of believer that god is looking for someone who will not back down somebody will not give up somebody will stand on god's word regardless of what the situation is oh i tell you so many times we like to protect ourselves what is it if this flesh goes away what is it if we lose this natural life there is an eternal life that paul says that if this body of flesh be dissolved there's one already waiting on the other side oh i tell you if we are done with if god is done with us on this earth we don't have any business living here anymore if as long as and if he has business with us living on earth there's nothing that can take us out of this that's where we have called being called to stand that's the kind of faith we've been called to produce to come to a place where we are so satisfied with this goodness the reason we find ourselves in so much trouble is because people are looking for satisfaction in the things of the world we feel like if i get more money i'll be satisfied if i get a better home i'll be satisfied if i get a better more land more money more cars more houses that's where my satisfaction will come from we failed to see all of the thousands that have gone before us from the world where we've seen suicide after suicide day in and day out yet they had it all we failed to see all that the world is speaking to that is nothing where people with billions of dollars they're leaving it behind and taking their own lives because why they couldn't find a lack of satisfaction in all those things what we need is to be satisfied with the lord jesus come to a place where i know god you can take away all that i have you in fact i will give off my life lord i'll only watch for one thing not that i may be satisfied with you inside of me that i can come to a place where i know what you say is what i want if you say it then i like it if you don't say it then i hate it i can come to a place where like jesus on the garden of ghettomani i'll tell you this he died there before he can die on the cross of calvary he came to a place where nothing of the world would have worked his intellect couldn't save him all his thinking couldn't save him he looked at himself he said father not my will but thy will when he died to himself at that place he already overcame the calver even before he could get there we need to place where we can overcome ourselves come to a place where is it god's will then i'm satisfied with it but madame talks about how he went to this big man's place and he talks about all roberts and and and and billy graham's thousands of computers programs and people typing out that mailing and all those things and just an entire enterprise and people working and just the kind of machinery but yet it was this little man with this one bag oh he looked at it it says oh i know god couldn't trust me with all those things that's why he didn't give it to me why in his heart he was satisfied with him and then god came and told him he says i am your portion i am your portion oh if god can be a portion tonight oh i tell you the overcoming challenge we need is to continually move moved into this presence let's move past all of this other places let's move past the holy place the outer court let's move into the holy of holies let's stay there let's not go in and out in and out let's be locked in nowhere i'm satisfied with your presence let y'all stand tonight i'm satisfied with you i don't need anything i don't need any another dollar i don't need anything i know lord that what you give me you give me because you want to give me lord your holy spirit your eternal life that you've placed within me is more than i can ask for lord that it in itself is there to sustain me in this journey that in itself is there to make sure that you provide for every single one of my needs as long as you still have me on this earth and you need me on this earth you will provide and protect you will provide and supply to all our needs that's what we have to realize but the holy spirit that you've placed within us in more than anything the world can offer that's just by it's our gracious father lord your goodness to us is more than we can say lord we come to you father tonight oh father i just begin to think about [Music] lord how do you give us even the very life natural
