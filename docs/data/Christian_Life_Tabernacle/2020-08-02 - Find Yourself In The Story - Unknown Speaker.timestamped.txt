[13:27] all our visitors and those are streaming
[13:30] from home we welcome you this morning as
[13:32] you invite budy Mike for a Psalm reading
[13:34] this morning God bless
[13:40] you I
[13:43] uh was chatting briefly with my uh with
[13:46] my dad this yesterday
[13:48] morning um and he was describing how
[13:51] exhausted he was after moving across the
[13:54] country and restarting his life and
[13:56] getting settled in a new house and all
[13:58] the stuff that you move and all the
[13:59] stuff that breaks and all the stuff
[14:01] that's different one thing that he
[14:03] commented on was that my mother seem to
[14:07] be continually propelled with that
[14:09] energy that Homemakers do where even
[14:12] long into the night after the man has
[14:14] collapsed into a
[14:15] coma the wife is about the Homemaker
[14:18] making sure that everything is just so
[14:21] to create an atmosphere for the home you
[14:23] know you know and I just got to thinking
[14:25] about that you know that's her place as
[14:27] a homemaker Amen to make a house a
[14:31] home and you know the man might go about
[14:34] building a house yes sir and he might
[14:37] make the strongest Foundation you can
[14:39] make he might make the thickest walls he
[14:41] might make a roof that can withstand six
[14:43] pound hailstones he's the home builder
[14:47] but she's the home
[14:48] maker she comes in and she's the one
[14:51] that sets the atmosphere puts the
[14:52] curtains in a certain place puts the
[14:55] rugs in a certain place puts all the
[14:57] knicknacks where they are you've all
[14:59] been there all right how's this
[15:02] look move it to the left a bit no that's
[15:06] too far you know we've all been there
[15:09] you know that's the hom maker right you
[15:12] know and I was thinking about how we
[15:14] were talking about a dwelling place a
[15:15] couple weeks ago and how he has a
[15:17] Dwelling Place he as our groom has a
[15:20] home right he said in John 14 I go to
[15:23] prepare a place for you and if I go and
[15:26] prepare a place for you I will come
[15:28] again and receive you unto myself that
[15:31] where I am yes sir there you may be also
[15:35] so you know we we spoke a little bit
[15:37] about how a groom and a bride in a
[15:39] dwelling place together here
[15:42] right so you just wonder is as if he if
[15:48] that isn't a pattern for what his taste
[15:50] is you know here he is where he's come
[15:53] and he's presented us with a dwelling
[15:56] place that he's built a place for us to
[15:58] enter enter into and be with him but now
[16:00] he's looking for a bride to come in and
[16:03] make that a
[16:04] home to put everything just so to
[16:08] welcome him that it would be pleasing
[16:11] and comfortable and hospitable for
[16:15] him amen you know in Psalm 93 verse 5
[16:19] we're going to read out of Psalm 93 this
[16:21] morning there was a phrase there that
[16:24] caught my
[16:25] attention and it says this thy test
[16:28] tonies are very
[16:30] sure Holiness becometh thy
[16:34] house you know the Amplified Bible says
[16:37] it this way that Holiness is becoming to
[16:41] your
[16:42] house you know when you say something is
[16:44] becoming it means it's attractive it's
[16:48] pleasing it's lovely it's pretty it's
[16:51] comely it's tasteful it's
[16:55] fashionable that's according to you know
[16:57] one of the the soures that you can look
[17:00] at but you know the Lord has a home
[17:01] decorator for his home and it's his
[17:03] bride right and the adornment of his
[17:07] house is Holiness that's the fashion
[17:11] that's the taste that's what's pleasing
[17:14] to him of all the patterns of the world
[17:17] available for her to choose from she
[17:19] chooses Holiness unto the Lord and
[17:23] that's the pattern the
[17:25] atmosphere the decoration the fashion if
[17:29] you will that his bride adorns his house
[17:33] to welcome him in his home that it would
[17:36] be pleasing to him and comfortable to
[17:39] him you know Psalm 29:2 says give unto
[17:42] the Lord the glory do his name Worship
[17:45] the Lord in the beauty of Holiness
[17:49] Holiness is an attractive adornment for
[17:51] his house that he leaves it to his bride
[17:55] to decorate with so he's looking for
[17:58] someone one a people a bride who would
[18:01] welcome him into his house with the
[18:05] adornment of Holiness and not a Holiness
[18:09] of you know dressing right and living
[18:11] right and all that Holiness is
[18:13] separation from all other loves except
[18:16] your love for him as we read last week
[18:19] unite my heart that's right to Fear Thy
[18:23] Name you know so how many of you would
[18:26] want to welcome him yes amen make him
[18:30] pleased to dwell welcome him into not
[18:33] only just the presence of this house but
[18:36] into the house that he has ministered an
[18:37] entrance to you to on a daily basis may
[18:41] we be pleasing to him as it song says
[18:43] pleasing pleasing let me be pleasing to
[18:45] you that's we attract his presence we
[18:48] make him feel at home content to dwell
[18:51] by an adornment of Holiness separation
[18:54] from all others unto him so that phrase
[18:56] kind of caught my attention this morning
[18:58] so just a short Psalm this morning we'll
[19:00] go ahead and read together Psalm
[19:02] 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with
[19:06] Majesty the Lord is clothed with
[19:08] strength wherein he hath GED himself the
[19:11] world also is established that it cannot
[19:14] be moved thy Throne is established of
[19:17] old thou art from Everlasting the floods
[19:20] have lifted up O Lord the floods have
[19:23] lifted up their voice the floods lift up
[19:26] their waves the Lord on high is mightier
[19:29] than the noise of many Waters yay than
[19:31] the mighty waves of the sea thy
[19:34] testimonies are very sure Holiness
[19:37] becometh thine house O Lord forever

[47:05] uh 24th chapter I'm I'm if you find 24
[47:10] chapters in Mark you let me know okay
[47:14] because I want that
[47:16] Bible I want all the word of God no this
[47:19] the 7th chapter of Mark the
[47:22] 24th
[47:24] verse
[47:33] it says in the uh Gospel of St Mark the
[47:37] 7th chapter and the 24th
[47:41] verse it says and
[47:43] from from then he rose and went into the
[47:48] border of Tyra and sedon and entered
[47:52] into the into an house and would have no
[47:57] man know it but he could not be hid for
[48:02] a certain woman whose young daughter had
[48:05] an unclean Spirit heard of him and came
[48:09] and fell at his feet and the woman was a
[48:14] Greek a seropian by nation and she
[48:19] besought him that he would cast forth
[48:23] the devil out of her daughter
[48:26] but Jesus said unto her let the children
[48:29] first be filled for it is not meant to
[48:33] take the children's bread and to cast it
[48:37] unto the
[48:39] dogs and she answered and said unto him
[48:43] yes Lord yay the dogs under the table
[48:47] eat of the children's
[48:50] crumbs and he said unto her for this
[48:53] saying go thy way

[49:10] father once again bless your word to us
[49:13] in Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[49:16] bless you you may be
[49:24] seated
[49:26] what I would like to do this morning and
[49:29] I know
[49:30] it's uh maybe difficult uh with the
[49:38] streaming and things the way it is and
[49:41] we appreciate the uh this streaming that
[49:46] um the people that have been
[49:49] streaming and the support that we've got
[49:52] online from uh those that come
[49:56] fellowship with us many come afterwards
[50:00] and um follow but you know our heart is
[50:06] set
[50:07] on doing our best to follow this message
[50:11] just the way it was given and I've
[50:15] always felt in my heart that it's always
[50:19] important for us to listen to the word
[50:23] of God together
[50:26] as
[50:27] Believers not just individually at home
[50:31] uh there's a lot of benefits to that and
[50:34] I believe that you should listen to
[50:35] tapes but and and you you make that
[50:40] choice of of what tape that you decide
[50:43] to listen to some start in 40s and go
[50:46] all the way through and some start and
[50:48] go backwards and some just let a title
[50:51] come on their heart but when when I come
[50:55] to the message and I want to play a
[50:57] portion this morning with you is uh
[51:01] because I try to find something that the
[51:04] Lord lays on my heart that is fitting
[51:08] the
[51:09] circumstances that we're
[51:11] in and so this message uh very common uh
[51:17] many of you heard it brother Brandon
[51:19] preached the subject matter I I think
[51:22] almost five times it's called persever
[51:27] perseverant uh but uh we'd like to take
[51:30] this this morning this next 25 minutes
[51:34] as kind of a
[51:36] foundation as our approach this morning
[51:40] that you can uh listen to what's being
[51:44] said and then when we go back and talk
[51:47] about it uh we can
[51:50] uh we can Fellowship on it and if I if I
[51:54] was to have a a title this
[51:58] morning I'd like to title this find
[52:01] yourself in the
[52:04] story find yourself in the story so I
[52:09] just read the scripture that brother
[52:11] Bram read and so we're going to pick up
[52:13] in the message called
[52:15] perseverance starting at paragraph uh uh
[52:21] I uh paragraph um 16
[52:25] I believe it is and then we will just go
[52:29] through uh paragraph 64 just a small
[52:33] portion of it I believe it's about 25
[52:36] minutes long and if if you just listen
[52:40] uh just pick up little things as you
[52:44] goow away but uh remember what I'd like
[52:47] just to fellowship with you a little bit
[52:49] this morning is finding yourself in the
[52:53] story and and so I hope this this is a
[52:55] blessing to you this morning it it's
[52:58] it's a wonderful message uh it really
[53:01] came upon my heart and uh it's
[53:05] really a blessing so uh we'll just do
[53:10] that at this time let's just ask the
[53:12] Lord to bless his word and then we'll
[53:15] listen to it this morning heavenly
[53:17] father bless your word to us the next
[53:20] moment as we
[53:22] listen
[53:24] to
[53:26] your message that you sent us the letter
[53:31] that you sent us from
[53:33] eternity that was written to us in this
[53:36] day that we could sit back and and and
[53:40] hear what you would have to speak speak
[53:43] to our hearts this morning Father help
[53:45] us stay true to this word we ask you to
[53:48] bless the people now as they hear your
[53:51] voice father the vessel that you chose
[53:54] to speak through in this this hour we
[53:56] ask you to bless it to the people in
[53:58] jesus' name we pray amen this is
[54:01] perseverance toeka Canyon uh to Pika
[54:04] Kansas excuse me uh June 19th
[54:10] 1964 God bless
[54:24] you
[54:30] you might say brother Brandon that's a
[54:32] that's a very small word for 3 or 400
[54:36] people sitting here tonight or whatever
[54:38] there is I'm a poor uh judge of of of a
[54:42] audience and you say that's a very small
[54:47] word well it isn't the the size it's
[54:51] it's it's really what I'm going to say
[54:52] about it now
[54:55] perseverance according to Webster it's
[54:59] um it's to be uh it's it's uh a word
[55:04] that you're to be
[55:07] persistent to means to be persistent in
[55:10] trying to make a goal try to to put
[55:14] something over try to do something you
[55:18] are perseverant when you are
[55:22] persistent now all Christians must be
[55:26] persistent they must be
[55:29] perseverant and the only way that you're
[55:32] able to to do this is the first to have
[55:36] faith in what you're trying to do and if
[55:40] you have no faith you're just jumping at
[55:42] it then you you you can't cannot be
[55:45] persevering but when you really know
[55:48] it's the truth then there's nothing
[55:51] going to stop you you are really
[55:54] persevering
[55:55] then and man of all ages that's ever
[55:59] been able to do anything and had faith
[56:01] in what they were trying to do were
[56:04] persevering for instance like the what
[56:07] we call the father of our nation George
[56:10] Washington uh he was
[56:14] persevering uh when he trying to achieve
[56:18] that victory over the British and cross
[56:21] the icy Delaware he was
[56:25] persevering there was nothing his
[56:28] soldiers half of them didn't even have
[56:30] shoes on their feet their feets was
[56:33] wrapped in
[56:34] rags the wind was blowing but he had
[56:37] prayed all
[56:38] night and he had the victory in his
[56:42] heart and there was no British army or
[56:45] nothing else was going to stop him
[56:47] neither could the iy river he had prayed
[56:51] through and there was no hindrance going
[56:55] to stop him he was
[56:58] perseverant and he achieved the task
[57:01] that he was trying to to do because he
[57:05] had the answer from God when a man gets
[57:09] his answer from God there's nothing
[57:12] going to stop
[57:14] him most people today as I will repeat
[57:17] myself from last night saying they have
[57:20] hope instead of Faith you find people
[57:21] coming on the platform they're they're
[57:23] just built up in Hope
[57:26] but faith is the substance of things
[57:30] hope for the evidence it's not a myth
[57:33] it's not imagination it's something
[57:35] you've got you've already got it and
[57:38] you're just as happy with it that faith
[57:41] that you have as you would be if you had
[57:43] the substance in your hand for instance
[57:46] like this if I'm starving to death and a
[57:48] loaf of bread cost us a quarter which
[57:50] will will buy the loaf of bread now when
[57:54] when I have the quarter in my hand I'm
[57:57] just as happy as if it was a loaf of
[57:59] bread because it's a purchase price of
[58:02] the bread amen and when I know in my
[58:05] heart that I have accepted it and I
[58:08] believe that God has given to me I'm
[58:11] just as happy as that Faith as if I was
[58:13] if I was healed because I'm going to be
[58:15] healed anyhow Hallelujah I've got the
[58:17] substance right now nobody can take it
[58:19] away from me I know it's right and I can
[58:22] be perseverant with that when God tells
[58:26] something is going to happen like the
[58:27] Visions or something I've seen tens of
[58:30] thousands of them and many of you are
[58:32] witnessed and not one of them has ever
[58:35] failed and When God says anything I
[58:37] don't if he would say tonight go to the
[58:39] National Cemetery for I'm going to raise
[58:42] up George Washington in the morning I'd
[58:44] invite the whole world come watch it
[58:46] it's going to happen amen God's word
[58:49] Can't Fail he's never failed and he
[58:50] can't fail there's one thing God can't
[58:53] do and that's fail he cannot fail in God
[58:56] is his word now Noah was living in a
[59:00] scientific age when they was perhaps
[59:03] could shoot the moon with radar Jesus
[59:05] said it was a day like this as it was in
[59:07] the days of Noah so will it be in the
[59:09] coming of the son of man now we know
[59:11] down in Egypt we see these pyramides we
[59:14] could not reproduce them today we have
[59:16] no power to do it they had a hold of
[59:18] atomic power or some kind of power that
[59:21] built the pyramids we couldn't put those
[59:23] Boulders up there by no means neither
[59:25] could we reproduce that Sphinx there's
[59:27] no way of doing it we don't have the
[59:30] material to make a mummy uh in bomb a
[59:32] body that looks even natural for
[59:35] thousands of years we've lost that art a
[59:37] diey that won't fade out many things
[59:40] they had then that we are completely
[59:42] blind of and they built that pyramid
[59:45] soour setting so Center in the earth no
[59:47] matter where the sun is there's never a
[59:49] shadow around it never a shadow at the
[59:51] pyramid all the architectur the the the
[59:54] instruments they they had is far beyond
[59:57] now and Noah lived in that intellectual
[1:00:00] scientific age Noah did and he was a
[1:00:05] prophet and the Lord told him that it
[1:00:09] was going to rain and after Noah hearing
[1:00:13] the voice of God being a prophet to the
[1:00:16] voice of the Lord word of the Lord comes
[1:00:19] to his prophet and he knew it was going
[1:00:22] to rain no matter what anyone else said
[1:00:24] whether ever rain and it never had
[1:00:25] rained before God irrigated the ground
[1:00:29] with the vegetation with with irrigation
[1:00:32] from the springs and so forth in the
[1:00:33] earth there had never been a cloud in
[1:00:35] the sky but yet Noah knew there was
[1:00:39] coming water from above how does he go
[1:00:41] to do it he doesn't know but he was so
[1:00:44] perseverant he went and build an
[1:00:48] ark according to the uh specification
[1:00:51] that God said for him to build it
[1:00:54] because he had heard the voice of God
[1:00:58] and was standing in the presence of God
[1:01:01] when the voice of God was made manifest
[1:01:04] to
[1:01:05] him that ought to set this Born Again
[1:01:09] Church AAR amen
[1:01:13] perseverance I don't care how many
[1:01:16] critics laugh about it how many says it
[1:01:18] can't be so and they go out there and
[1:01:19] scientifically prove it shoot the radar
[1:01:22] to the moon and show there is no such a
[1:01:24] thing as water in the
[1:01:25] skies but Noah knew that if God standing
[1:01:29] in his presence and his the god that had
[1:01:32] spoke to him and he was clearly
[1:01:34] identified that it was God's word and
[1:01:37] standing in the presence of God he was
[1:01:40] he was persistent he would build the ark
[1:01:42] anyhow nobody wanted to help him he'd
[1:01:45] build it
[1:01:46] himself he was persistent because he was
[1:01:51] know that it was the word of God
[1:01:55] and he buildt
[1:01:57] it I can think of of how Moses a great
[1:02:03] scholar he was so smart that he could he
[1:02:06] could teach the wisdom to the Egyptians
[1:02:09] he could teach the teachers he knowed
[1:02:12] all of the the
[1:02:15] theology uh of that the Egyptians knowed
[1:02:18] and of his Hebrew family and he was a
[1:02:22] smart witty man a great we taught his
[1:02:24] was a military man but it totally
[1:02:29] failed because one
[1:02:32] thing he slew this Egyptian and his
[1:02:36] education ceased when they accused him
[1:02:39] then will you slay us as you did the
[1:02:41] Egyptian thinking his brethen would
[1:02:44] understand it and he he miserably
[1:02:50] failed and that brings me to a thought
[1:02:52] of this that's the reason tonight that
[1:02:56] our systems has
[1:02:58] failed that's the reason that we will
[1:03:00] never be able to educate people to God
[1:03:03] we'll never be able to denominate them
[1:03:05] to God we've tried all these systems and
[1:03:08] they all fail like fell like the Tower
[1:03:12] of
[1:03:13] Babel and they always will do that God
[1:03:18] the unchanging God made his decision at
[1:03:23] the Garden of Eden how he would save man
[1:03:26] and when God ever makes a decision it
[1:03:28] has to ever remain that
[1:03:31] way he cannot
[1:03:33] change he cannot get smarter he's the
[1:03:36] source of all intelligence no matter
[1:03:39] what our science says if it's against
[1:03:42] the intelligence or the word of God it's
[1:03:45] contrary it's not right I don't care how
[1:03:48] scientifically can be proved it's still
[1:03:51] wrong God decided he would save a man by
[1:03:54] by the shed blood of an innocent one
[1:03:57] they've tried to build cities they've
[1:03:59] tried to unite them they've tried to
[1:04:01] build towers educate them into it and
[1:04:04] they get further away all the time
[1:04:07] you'll never be able to save man till he
[1:04:09] comes back to the blood amen that's the
[1:04:13] only place that God will ever meet a man
[1:04:15] not by his intellectuals not by how
[1:04:17] smart he is how many man has made him a
[1:04:19] priest or bishop or state overseer
[1:04:22] whatever he might be min Minister Deacon
[1:04:25] that isn't the grounds that God meets a
[1:04:27] man on he meets him on the grounds when
[1:04:30] he's under the shed
[1:04:32] blood that's the only place Israel ever
[1:04:34] was able to meet God to worship was
[1:04:36] under the shed blood that's God's
[1:04:38] provided way no other way will work and
[1:04:41] under the shed blood God meets man and
[1:04:45] stands in the presence of
[1:04:48] man Moses this runaway intellectual
[1:04:52] runaway prophet out on the back side of
[1:04:55] the desert and married this beautiful
[1:04:56] Ethiopian woman and was living had a
[1:05:00] child little
[1:05:02] gersham one day while walking around on
[1:05:05] the desert the back side of the desert
[1:05:06] an old man of 80 years old looked like
[1:05:09] was come out of use as a minister but he
[1:05:12] found a bush that was burning with fire
[1:05:15] and it did not consume and he went aside
[1:05:18] to see what had happened and come into
[1:05:22] the presence of God and heard the
[1:05:25] presence of God heard the voice of God
[1:05:28] while he was in his presence when this
[1:05:31] Pillar of Fire was laying in this bush
[1:05:33] talking to him where he was afraid to
[1:05:37] even go near Egypt knowing if Pharaoh
[1:05:40] would take his life there's nothing
[1:05:42] going to stop him now and sometimes when
[1:05:47] a man gets in the presence of God and
[1:05:50] hears the voice of God he does sing so
[1:05:54] so radical to the ordinary thinking of
[1:05:57] people it sounds
[1:05:59] ridiculous the next day now a man that
[1:06:02] was afraid to take an army to
[1:06:05] attack Egypt all the slaves there was in
[1:06:08] Egypt he's afraid to attack Pharaoh like
[1:06:11] that here he is the next day 80 years
[1:06:15] old beard hanging all the way to his
[1:06:17] waistline his bald head shiny a crooked
[1:06:20] stick in his hand his wife sitting on a
[1:06:22] mule with a young on her hip going down
[1:06:24] with his eyes set up glorifying God
[1:06:26] where are you going Moses going down to
[1:06:28] Egypt to take
[1:06:29] over a one-man Invasion amen why he had
[1:06:34] been in the presence of God Amen he seen
[1:06:38] what God could do with a stick he didn't
[1:06:40] know what he could do with an army he
[1:06:41] know what he could do with a stick
[1:06:44] amen I don't know what he can do by
[1:06:46] denomination I know what he can do with
[1:06:48] one man that'll surrender himself
[1:06:50] completely to him it's all he needs one
[1:06:54] person that's
[1:06:55] you then he's persevering nothing's
[1:06:58] going to stop him Moses had come in the
[1:07:02] presence of God heard his voice in a a
[1:07:06] miracle sign he know he was a consuming
[1:07:10] fire and here he is in the pillar of
[1:07:12] fire back in the bush all of his
[1:07:14] education all of his theology left him
[1:07:16] and he know one thing there was a God
[1:07:18] and he had his orders a Crooked Stick
[1:07:21] was good enough amen amen been in the
[1:07:24] presence of God don't make any
[1:07:26] difference how many trained men Egypt
[1:07:28] had any of these things didn't mean a
[1:07:30] thing to Moses he had been in the
[1:07:32] presence of God and he was persevering
[1:07:34] he's going down to take
[1:07:36] over against Shields and trained Man by
[1:07:39] the tens of thousands with a crooked
[1:07:42] stick in his hand stop him if you can
[1:07:44] there's nothing can stop him amen and he
[1:07:47] did it he went out and took over because
[1:07:50] he was perseverant when he absolutely
[1:07:53] know that he was had been in the
[1:07:54] presence of God and had heard the voice
[1:07:57] of God out of the presence of God amen
[1:08:00] amen not only the voice was but it was a
[1:08:02] scriptural voice there's all kinds of
[1:08:05] voices check it with the
[1:08:07] word the voice said I'm the god of
[1:08:11] Abraham Isaac and Jacob I made a promise
[1:08:14] that I would deliver those people the
[1:08:16] time is at hand I've heard their
[1:08:18] groaning seen their uh taskmasters
[1:08:21] burdening them and I remember my promise
[1:08:24] have come down to deliver him and I'm
[1:08:26] sending you to do it that's good
[1:08:29] enough you seen his glory and away he
[1:08:32] went David was very
[1:08:36] perseverant when he come over to the the
[1:08:40] armies of Israel which was standing in a
[1:08:42] bluff at that time and uh across the
[1:08:46] little creek and over on the other side
[1:08:48] was the the
[1:08:50] Philistine there was Goliath the great
[1:08:53] Challenger
[1:08:54] about twice the size height of an
[1:08:57] ordinary man 14 in fingers and a great
[1:09:01] spear several feet long that could stand
[1:09:04] there and just pick man on it like that
[1:09:05] and throw him off punch him out pick him
[1:09:07] up on the spear and throw him off as
[1:09:09] they come up the hill and when the enemy
[1:09:11] knows that he's got the upper hand on
[1:09:13] you he likes to
[1:09:15] brag so he said let's not have so much
[1:09:18] Bloodshed said Saul let some of your man
[1:09:22] come over here and fight me if I kill
[1:09:24] him well then you serve us but if he
[1:09:26] kills me uh uh we'll serve you see when
[1:09:29] the enemy's got that upper hand and
[1:09:32] every Soldier was just so shaky that he
[1:09:36] could hardly hold his armor up and saw
[1:09:39] the most able of all of them Head and
[1:09:41] Shoulders above his army he wouldn't
[1:09:43] dare touch him and yet supposed to be
[1:09:46] the anointed of the Lord but there come
[1:09:49] from the
[1:09:50] Wilderness a little stoop shouldered
[1:09:53] Ruddy looking fell that had a slingshot
[1:09:56] in his
[1:09:57] hand and that giant made his brag before
[1:10:00] the wrong man
[1:10:02] amen and David said do you mean to tell
[1:10:05] me that you'll let that uncircumcised
[1:10:09] Philistine stand there and defy the
[1:10:12] armies of the Living God Amen do you
[1:10:15] mean to tell
[1:10:17] me that you'll do such a thing as that
[1:10:21] now his brother said now you're naughty
[1:10:23] you get back out there at the Sheep
[1:10:25] where you belong and the News come to
[1:10:27] Saul Saul said bring the lad here let me
[1:10:30] look at him when he come up little stoop
[1:10:33] Ruddy looking F standing there probably
[1:10:35] hair hanging down his eyes and he said
[1:10:38] would you you can't fight that man said
[1:10:40] you're nothing but a little fell little
[1:10:43] little readyy man in your Youth and he's
[1:10:45] been a warrior since his youth he said
[1:10:49] you can't fight him I admire your
[1:10:50] courage but the uh That's too great
[1:10:54] what
[1:10:56] happened he said let me see if you could
[1:10:58] use my armor so he put his armor on him
[1:11:02] give him his shield well poor little
[1:11:04] David couldn't stand up he he he said he
[1:11:07] he didn't know nothing about it he found
[1:11:10] out that Saul's ecclesiastical vest
[1:11:13] didn't fit a man of God so he said I'll
[1:11:16] send him away and get him a school in a
[1:11:17] PhD lld and so forth and see what he can
[1:11:20] do about it he said I don't know nothing
[1:11:23] about these things take them off of me I
[1:11:25] I don't know nothing about this but
[1:11:27] here's one thing I do
[1:11:29] know I was hurting my father's sheep and
[1:11:33] a lion come in and got one of them and I
[1:11:36] went after
[1:11:37] him because my father had G me charge to
[1:11:41] watch those
[1:11:43] Sheep amen and any good shepherd is a
[1:11:47] watcher of the Sheep amen and he said I
[1:11:50] don't have nothing but this slingshot in
[1:11:52] my hand but I knocked him down and when
[1:11:55] he rose up against me I slew him and a
[1:11:58] bear come in and got one I run after him
[1:12:00] and tuck it out of his mouth and when he
[1:12:02] rose up I killed him and said how much
[1:12:06] more will God of Israel God Of Heaven
[1:12:10] deliver that uncircumcised Philistine
[1:12:13] into my hand that little fellow was
[1:12:16] persevering because he know what he was
[1:12:19] talking
[1:12:21] about he know who he had believed and
[1:12:24] was fully persuaded is able to keep that
[1:12:27] which he committed to him against the
[1:12:29] day now he had just a slingshot that's
[1:12:32] all he had he said I'll go fight the
[1:12:36] Philistines because the reason he was so
[1:12:39] persevering he know if God under the
[1:12:41] care of a
[1:12:43] sheep had helped him deliver the Sheep
[1:12:46] back to his father how much more a
[1:12:50] man now think of that all min ERS and we
[1:12:54] feel that way about you sheep tonight
[1:12:56] the devil has come and smoked you with
[1:12:59] the
[1:13:00] disease it's trying he's tuck you out
[1:13:03] from the good health I I don't have no
[1:13:06] PhD I don't have no lldd I don't even
[1:13:09] have a grammar school education but I
[1:13:11] know what I do have I'm coming after you
[1:13:15] tonight to bring you back to the Shady
[1:13:18] Green Pastures and the Still Waters
[1:13:21] Hallelujah that's what we're here on the
[1:13:23] platform for tonight is to come get you
[1:13:26] snatch you out of the hand of the lion
[1:13:28] out there bring you back be patient
[1:13:31] listen close and watch try to find what
[1:13:34] we're trying to do is try to help you
[1:13:38] now David was very persistent because
[1:13:42] that he knew who he had believed and he
[1:13:44] know he was able to commit what he
[1:13:48] committed to him he was able to keep it
[1:13:50] we find out that
[1:13:51] Samson another a great judge in
[1:13:55] Israel and that some people picture
[1:13:59] Samson is having uh shoulders about like
[1:14:03] a barn door now it would be nothing
[1:14:05] strange about that to see a man who
[1:14:07] could pick up the gates of Gaya and walk
[1:14:09] out with it or take a line and pull him
[1:14:11] apart but you know Samson was just a
[1:14:14] little bitty in the street expression a
[1:14:16] little shrimp little bitty old
[1:14:18] curly-headed sissified mama's boy seven
[1:14:22] curls it was a strange thing when they
[1:14:24] thought that a man a great big uh
[1:14:28] 10-foot man could pick up a line sure
[1:14:31] and kill him but the strange thing was
[1:14:34] this little fellow seemed to be helpless
[1:14:36] until the Spear of the Lord come on him
[1:14:38] it wasn't Samson it was the spirit of
[1:14:41] the Lord amen that's the reason that it
[1:14:43] wasn't the apostles Jesus chose them all
[1:14:47] practically every one of them without
[1:14:48] even enough education to sign their name
[1:14:51] he didn't choose priest he didn't choose
[1:14:54] theologians he chose fishermen and
[1:14:56] herdsmen the ignorant and unlearned so
[1:14:59] that he could take that in his hand and
[1:15:01] take nothing and make something out of
[1:15:04] it amen that's his
[1:15:07] nature so he doesn't take train schools
[1:15:10] and train Scholars he takes something
[1:15:13] that realizes it's nothing and gets into
[1:15:16] it and makes something out of
[1:15:18] it we find that this
[1:15:22] Sam
[1:15:24] now it's all you can go listen to the
[1:15:26] rest of it at home amen amen and I hope
[1:15:30] you do I I hope you do we just want to
[1:15:34] take uh some thoughts uh from this uh
[1:15:40] this morning to minister and and it's
[1:15:44] like he said you know a pastor wants to
[1:15:48] uh
[1:15:50] snatch you know out of the hands of the
[1:15:54] devil you you hate to see the enemy
[1:15:57] having
[1:15:59] uh influence the the way that he does
[1:16:03] and you know when we look at this uh the
[1:16:07] hour that we're living in now you know
[1:16:11] there all this uh politics everywhere
[1:16:15] nothing's without politics you you don't
[1:16:18] know what a person's saying what their
[1:16:21] motive and objective is it's yeah I
[1:16:23] don't think we've ever seen such a time
[1:16:27] of
[1:16:28] confusion uh going on we we don't know
[1:16:32] what the future is and you know you're
[1:16:35] you're scared to death to sit next to
[1:16:37] somebody because you think that they're
[1:16:40] going to get you and and uh uh you know
[1:16:45] and that that's just the the thing is uh
[1:16:48] you know there's it's different and
[1:16:51] there's different opinions every where
[1:16:53] and there's fear everywhere and there's
[1:16:57] uncertainty everywhere and and that's
[1:17:01] just the way it is you know but uh
[1:17:04] that's not our
[1:17:05] world Amen that's not our world we don't
[1:17:09] live there that's right amen we don't
[1:17:12] think there uh we don't rest there we
[1:17:16] don't have a part of it that that's just
[1:17:19] not our world this is what the prophet
[1:17:22] of God said he said God promised his
[1:17:24] seed to be a Stranger in a Strange Land
[1:17:30] amen and be misjudged by the people and
[1:17:36] that they would sojourn Abraham's
[1:17:40] seed can you imagine that that God
[1:17:43] promised you to be a
[1:17:46] stranger amen because that's not our
[1:17:48] world we're not part of that world we're
[1:17:51] sojourners here we're just traveling
[1:17:55] through and so we don't want to get
[1:17:57] caught down that's not our world we're
[1:17:59] not a part of it you know our world's a
[1:18:02] Bible World our world's a word word
[1:18:06] world that's what we are you know it's
[1:18:10] like we there's our world and then
[1:18:13] there's the other world Amen we live in
[1:18:16] a world of Promise that's what that's
[1:18:19] what we are we're Children Of Promise
[1:18:22] Abraham and his seed were the children
[1:18:25] of Promise they were the result of a
[1:18:29] promise that's what we are the result of
[1:18:32] a promise we live by God's promised word
[1:18:35] and it's by these great and precious
[1:18:38] promises that were partakers of divine
[1:18:43] nature and and we look at it and people
[1:18:46] trying to find security and and and
[1:18:50] trying to uh uh press forward but our
[1:18:54] whole effort it are put forth to keep
[1:18:58] the other world out of our world we want
[1:19:02] to keep that other world out we don't
[1:19:04] want it to start flooding in and and
[1:19:07] that's what's that's what's uh we're
[1:19:11] beginning to see it uh no doubt we we'll
[1:19:15] uh be criticized for uh coming together
[1:19:18] this morning uh there's nothing you can
[1:19:21] do that you can't find a critic anymore
[1:19:25] every everybody's on one such one side
[1:19:27] or one thing uh you know you can Edge
[1:19:30] your lawn and and uh someone think well
[1:19:34] it's just not straight enough there's
[1:19:35] just nothing you can do that you don't
[1:19:38] have a critic but aren't you glad you
[1:19:39] have to go through the Hall of critics
[1:19:42] before you can get to the Hall of Fame
[1:19:44] so we understand this morning that that
[1:19:47] we don't draw our resources from the
[1:19:50] world we're not of this world World
[1:19:53] we're not part of this world this is not
[1:19:56] our world that's not our inheritance
[1:19:59] amen we have an inheritance and The
[1:20:01] Inheritance say I give you a peace that
[1:20:04] surpass understanding I give you a joy
[1:20:08] unspeakable and full of Glory that's our

[1:20:15] brought down we're not going to be taken
[1:20:17] apart we're not going to uh like I said
[1:20:20] we're not going to shelter and we're
[1:20:23] going to Fellowship in place you know
[1:20:25] we're not going to let what's ever going
[1:20:28] on destroy
[1:20:30] us and that's why this message just
[1:20:33] seemed to uh speak to my heart in in in
[1:20:39] the way that it is
[1:20:41] about about being uh
[1:20:45] persevering and you know and he said he
[1:20:48] said what the definition of perseverance
[1:20:50] means is to keep after it you just keep
[1:20:53] going you keep pressing you have an a
[1:20:56] journey and you have something that you
[1:20:59] want to fulfill but you know I noticed
[1:21:01] something and why this struck out so
[1:21:04] much to me was I I see so many people
[1:21:09] getting to the place that they just want
[1:21:11] to throw in the
[1:21:15] towel you know what I mean I'm just
[1:21:18] going to give it all up and I'm going to
[1:21:20] go to the mountain somewhere and I'm
[1:21:23] just going to take the little bit of
[1:21:25] money that I have and I'm just going to
[1:21:27] live on it they just don't want to go
[1:21:30] forward they don't want to keep
[1:21:32] pressing they just want to give it up I
[1:21:34] I talked to a friend of mine he owns a
[1:21:37] restaurant and we were sitting there
[1:21:39] talking to him and and he said you know
[1:21:42] when all the restaurants
[1:21:44] closed he said I thought about throwing
[1:21:47] in the
[1:21:50] towel he said but I you know I I didn't
[1:21:53] want to
[1:21:54] quit he said so I I I I cook the food
[1:21:59] myself amen my wife helped me and and we
[1:22:03] kept pressing we kept persevering and
[1:22:06] then it opened up a little bit and
[1:22:08] opened up a little bit but he said so
[1:22:10] many of other restaurants have shut down
[1:22:14] they're gone they threw in the towel yes
[1:22:17] sir they're never going to
[1:22:19] recover why because they didn't Pur
[1:22:22] exist they didn't go up against the odds
[1:22:26] they didn't press the channel they
[1:22:28] didn't fight against what's coming
[1:22:30] against them you understand this whole
[1:22:33] thing out here is nothing but a great
[1:22:35] big
[1:22:37] depression just wants to get you in a
[1:22:40] spirit of
[1:22:42] quitting why why keep going why do this
[1:22:46] why do
[1:22:48] that don't matter that's not our world

[1:23:14] stay six feet away from everybody and
[1:23:17] you wrap a mask around your mouth and
[1:23:19] and that's fine that don't stop me from
[1:23:21] testifying

[1:23:26] testify to you through my mask I'm
[1:23:33] commissioned we got to we got to press

[1:23:38] perseverant you you keep pressing the
[1:23:40] mark you don't just fold uh at at at
[1:23:44] everything there's things that that we
[1:23:47] we want to achieve
[1:23:49] am there's something that we're after he
[1:23:52] said now notice what he did in this
[1:23:54] scripture when he's talking about
[1:23:56] perseverance he went back through the
[1:23:59] scriptures and use scriptural stories to
[1:24:04] show you the value of what it takes to
[1:24:08] persevere these men were
[1:24:12] persistent and there's a promise made to
[1:24:16] us a promise is made to us
[1:24:20] today that this message was sent to us
[1:24:24] to restore back to us the Faith of Our
[1:24:29] Fathers I'd like to read this again to
[1:24:33] you if if you would allow me to I know
[1:24:36] I'm not a good reader but you're very
[1:24:38] patient with
[1:24:39] me he said most people today as I
[1:24:44] repeated myself from last night say they
[1:24:48] have hope instead of faith
[1:24:54] so
[1:24:55] and Hope's
[1:24:58] Good Hope is the is the it is the
[1:25:02] breeding ground of
[1:25:05] Faith you hope for
[1:25:07] something but one day you get it and the
[1:25:11] Hope's done away with now you have the
[1:25:14] evidence of what you hope
[1:25:17] for just like a little uh child that
[1:25:21] maybe puts in their Christmas
[1:25:24] request oh I hope I get a fire truck I
[1:25:27] hope I get a fire truck or a doll or or
[1:25:31] or whatever it is you know and uh or I'd
[1:25:35] like to get this for my birthday or
[1:25:37] something like that you know nowadays we
[1:25:40] don't even ask anymore we just say what
[1:25:42] do you want for your
[1:25:43] birthday you know and then you say well
[1:25:46] I'd like this I'd like
[1:25:48] that and so that's a hope yeah you're
[1:25:52] you're hoping you get it I hopeing I get
[1:25:54] it but when it it
[1:25:56] arrives you don't hope for it anymore
[1:25:59] you possess
[1:26:01] it and so there's something that we're
[1:26:04] trying
[1:26:05] to to to
[1:26:08] achieve George Washington he wanted to
[1:26:10] achieve that Victory he how can I win
[1:26:13] this how can I defeat these British he
[1:26:16] sought the Lord he got out before the
[1:26:18] Lord Lord what should I do what can I do
[1:26:23] to win this
[1:26:25] war they we're outnumbered we're out
[1:26:28] we're out fed we're out we're not
[1:26:31] equipped the way they are how can what
[1:26:33] can I do speak to me he sought the Lord
[1:26:36] he prayed for the Lord give me what what
[1:26:40] move do I need to
[1:26:45] make he had
[1:26:47] something that he wanted to accomplish
[1:26:50] he wanted freedom they were fighting for
[1:26:53] freedom of
[1:26:55] religion the freedom to live and do
[1:27:01] right and he
[1:27:03] prayed all
[1:27:06] night and the Lord showed him if you'll
[1:27:09] cross the Delaware I don't know was it
[1:27:11] Christmas Eve or something that he
[1:27:13] crossed the Delaware Christmas day or
[1:27:15] something he said if you do this you
[1:27:18] will catch them by
[1:27:21] surprise no matter how treacherous it
[1:27:23] looked he from he received a vision from
[1:27:26] the Lord he got an answer from God if
[1:27:29] you will go do this you will be
[1:27:33] victorious but it looked crazy didn't
[1:27:37] it but he he's stuck with it yes sir you
[1:27:42] understand he had to chop the ice off
[1:27:44] the boats he had to get the men together
[1:27:47] he could you understand there took a lot
[1:27:49] of effort that went into that we just
[1:27:52] read it like a Bible story but we need
[1:27:55] to put ourselves in the
[1:27:59] story put yourself in the story put
[1:28:02] yourself as that man making that
[1:28:04] decision for all those other
[1:28:09] people think of those
[1:28:12] soldiers each one had to play their part
[1:28:15] they got behind
[1:28:18] them they join forces together yes sir
[1:28:21] they got got one spirit and one
[1:28:24] mind with one goal and one objective and
[1:28:29] when they United together into the
[1:28:32] achievement that they wanted to achieve
[1:28:34] they became Victorious
[1:28:39] together takes you all to do
[1:28:42] it take it it took them all but when you
[1:28:46] put yourself in your story you
[1:28:48] understand there took a lot more to be
[1:28:51] persistent yes
[1:28:53] sir there's a lot of other things to
[1:28:55] battle
[1:28:56] against I don't like to be
[1:29:00] cold I would have said George I don't
[1:29:03] want to leave the
[1:29:07] fire sometimes it takes
[1:29:09] courage to be brave to stand up so we
[1:29:13] know that he had something that he
[1:29:15] wanted to
[1:29:17] achieve so he wasn't hoping for it he he
[1:29:23] knew if he would cross that River come
[1:29:26] on and attack them troops that they
[1:29:29] would be drunken they would be lazy they
[1:29:32] wouldn't be expecting it yes
[1:29:35] sir and he got his
[1:29:38] victory well I'll tell you something on
[1:29:41] that's where a lot of Satan gets a lot
[1:29:43] of Christians is they lay down on the
[1:29:46] job they they just get amnesia they
[1:29:49] forget they're in a battle they they
[1:29:51] forget they're trying to struggle for
[1:29:53] something to achieve something to
[1:29:55] accomplish something everybody's just
[1:29:57] sitting on their Laurels
[1:30:01] waiting amen we know we don't wait we're
[1:30:05] about our father's
[1:30:09] business we we're people that are called
[1:30:11] to something we have a goal did you hear
[1:30:14] what he said he said be persistent in
[1:30:17] trying to make a goal trying to put
[1:30:20] something over
[1:30:22] trying to do something we're trying to
[1:30:25] put something over we're trying to let
[1:30:27] the people know that God has sent a
[1:30:30] Divine message to this world today to
[1:30:34] save them from the uncoming
[1:30:37] destruction right it's an
[1:30:41] arc this message is an
[1:30:45] arc and so you you see what he says he
[1:30:48] says but when a man gets his answers
[1:30:50] from God there's there's nothing going
[1:30:52] to stop
[1:30:54] himen he says many people today I said
[1:30:57] last night say they have hope instead of
[1:30:59] faith we find people coming on the
[1:31:02] platform they're just built up in
[1:31:06] hope I hope I get it I hope I get it I
[1:31:10] hope I get it I hope it's right do you
[1:31:14] understand we've got to move past
[1:31:19] hope that's right we have got the come
[1:31:22] to the place that we have a vision we
[1:31:26] understand what our lives about we
[1:31:29] understand where we're going we
[1:31:31] understand what we're doing we know what
[1:31:33] we're trying to achieve we know what it
[1:31:36] is that we want to
[1:31:39] possess now you may not have
[1:31:43] it but if you're hoping for it and
[1:31:46] you're persistent and you keep pressing
[1:31:48] the mark you keep going towards it
[1:31:51] working towards it one day you'll have
[1:31:54] it in your
[1:31:58] hand you know I talk to a lot of people
[1:32:01] about houses I've sit down with lots and
[1:32:04] lots of
[1:32:06] people the first thing they do is they
[1:32:09] DW they draw out their
[1:32:12] dreamhouse sitting there talking to a
[1:32:14] little somebody you know what I mean and
[1:32:17] and oh they got this plan maybe make 4
[1:32:21] $30,000 a year and they draw up a five
[1:32:24] bedroom house you know three bath twocc
[1:32:27] car garage on an acre of
[1:32:32] land okay that what you're hoping
[1:32:36] for but if they would have hold that
[1:32:39] Vision they'd go live in that
[1:32:41] two-bedroom house and fix it up on they
[1:32:44] would go get the next house and work on
[1:32:46] it and they go do the next thing and the
[1:32:49] next thing and they'd be persistent one
[1:32:51] one day they take possession of that but
[1:32:54] as long as they sit around in a dream
[1:32:57] and do nothing they have
[1:33:05] nothing and we're what do we
[1:33:11] got scripture says we have not because
[1:33:13] we ask not we have not because we do
[1:33:18] not you do nothing you get
[1:33:24] nothing you have something to show for
[1:33:28] so he goes on he say he says faith is a
[1:33:32] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:33:36] evidence it's not a myth it's not
[1:33:40] imagination it's something you've
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:49] got you already got it
[1:33:52] amen and you're just as happy with it
[1:33:56] the faith that you
[1:33:58] have as you would be if you had the
[1:34:02] substance in your hand you're just as
[1:34:05] happy with the
[1:34:08] faith that's right just as much joy in
[1:34:11] the faith is if you had the
[1:34:15] result and I love how he explains this
[1:34:19] because this is what we're trying to be
[1:34:21] persistent to this is what we want to
[1:34:24] achieve this statement right
[1:34:28] here I feel is what we as a body should
[1:34:32] be trying to
[1:34:38] achieve this is what we should be after
[1:34:41] this is what we should be pressing
[1:34:44] to a belief in every word of
[1:34:50] God
[1:34:52] that's right and I love how our
[1:34:54] messenger explains
[1:34:57] it he says for instance like this if I'm
[1:35:03] starving to death now put yourself in
[1:35:07] the story has anybody in here no I won't
[1:35:11] ask it because I can look at
[1:35:14] you you all look like you're nice and
[1:35:17] plump and doing real fine none of us
[1:35:20] have been starving to
[1:35:22] death but put yourself in the story if
[1:35:26] you're starving to
[1:35:31] death you're in bad
[1:35:33] shape you're
[1:35:36] weak you're you're you're
[1:35:39] trembling you're on the verge of of of
[1:35:45] collapse you're fixing to
[1:35:48] perish you're not just hungry
[1:35:52] you're past
[1:35:53] hungry you're starting to look at your
[1:35:55] fingers and they're starting to look
[1:36:00] good you know you're starting to figure
[1:36:02] out which parts of you you can live
[1:36:04] without you're hungry you're starving
[1:36:07] put yourself in the story yeah yes
[1:36:12] sir he said like I'm starving to death
[1:36:16] and a loaf of bread cost a
[1:36:20] quarter a quarter will buy the loaf of
[1:36:23] bread amen now when I have the quarter
[1:36:26] in my hand I'm just as happy as if it
[1:36:32] was the loaf of bread because it's the
[1:36:35] purchase price of the bread oh my if we
[1:36:39] could when we could start coming to that
[1:36:42] when we're just as happy with the
[1:36:46] promise because we know the promise is
[1:36:49] going to come to pass
[1:36:51] amen we got the message we know the
[1:36:55] rapture's
[1:36:56] coming we know we have the purchased
[1:36:59] price we're just as happy like today as
[1:37:03] if the Rapture has already taken
[1:37:09] place
[1:37:11] that's that's the kind of
[1:37:15] Faith yes sir see we're all we get oh
[1:37:20] let me just finish the
[1:37:23] statement because it's the purchase of
[1:37:25] the bread and when I know in my heart
[1:37:29] that I've accepted it and believe that
[1:37:32] God has give it to me I'm just as happy
[1:37:38] with that Faith as I was if I was
[1:37:46] healed because I'm going to get healed
[1:37:50] anyhow
[1:37:54] see we're on the back end of
[1:37:58] it I'm going to get happy when I get
[1:38:02] healed I'm going to testify when I get
[1:38:06] healed you don't need
[1:38:09] persistence if you're healed you need
[1:38:12] the persistence until you
[1:38:17] obtain what's been
[1:38:20] promised just as happy with the
[1:38:24] promise just as happy with your
[1:38:29] election I'm chosen my name's written on
[1:38:32] the Lamb's Book of Life I'm happy with
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:37] that I know I'm going in the Rapture I'm
[1:38:41] just content how do you know I heard the
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:48] voice I heard Malachi 45
[1:38:52] I saw Revelations 10:7 I saw Luke 17:30
[1:38:57] I've seen the word of
[1:39:01] God it was give to
[1:39:04] me I didn't earn it I didn't deserve it
[1:39:09] it came by the shed
[1:39:14] blood so this is what we're talking
[1:39:18] about this is what we ought to be Pur in
[1:39:21] to this is what we ought to be fighting
[1:39:24] to this is what we ought to be pressing
[1:39:26] to is a faith that says I'm just as
[1:39:31] happy with the promise as I am with the
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:39] result but that's the spirit of the
[1:39:42] age the spirit of the age isn't one of
[1:39:45] Faith it's one of
[1:39:48] science it's one of Education
[1:39:52] come on so in other words we don't get
[1:39:55] excited
[1:39:56] till we got it cuz nobody believes
[1:40:00] anybody
[1:40:03] anymore you don't trust
[1:40:09] nobody we
[1:40:12] don't and there's more
[1:40:14] mistrust being sown every
[1:40:18] day nobody's trusting in everybody
[1:40:21] everybody's picking on everybody
[1:40:23] everybody's a scared of everybody you
[1:40:26] know I me but praise God there's
[1:40:29] light there shall be light in the
[1:40:32] evening time the path of Glory we shall
[1:40:35] surely find amen we're not throwing in
[1:40:38] the
[1:40:40] towel
[1:40:42] amen you know there there's no such
[1:40:45] thing as Retirement for a Christian
[1:40:47] that's
[1:40:49] right someone says ' when are you going
[1:40:52] to retire I said' I get retired every
[1:40:57] morning at the end of the day I'm
[1:40:59] retired I'm all tired all over again but
[1:41:02] what am I going to enter into my rest
[1:41:05] I'm going to get up the next morning I'm
[1:41:07] going to live that day I'm going to
[1:41:09] fight that day I'm going to stand for
[1:41:11] the gospel that day I'm going to testify
[1:41:14] that day that I'm a possessor of the
[1:41:17] promise and if I have the promise I
[1:41:20] possess the
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:27] result what this is the
[1:41:30] atmosphere this is what the people of
[1:41:32] the world needs to walk into was what
[1:41:35] our messenger presented to us day after
[1:41:37] day he didn't care what the problem was
[1:41:40] cuz he knew there's God that he was in
[1:41:43] you was greater than he was in the
[1:41:48] world he just got tired of seeing seeing
[1:41:51] people give up that's
[1:41:54] right they didn't have the result they
[1:41:56] think the promise is no
[1:41:58] good the result doesn't make the promise
[1:42:02] the promise makes the
[1:42:06] result if you don't believe in the
[1:42:09] promise the result's not going to make
[1:42:11] you believe the promise you know why cuz
[1:42:14] I'll tell you what Satan does people
[1:42:16] don't believe the promise God does
[1:42:18] something for them and then they
[1:42:20] attribute it it to somebody else other
[1:42:22] than the word of
[1:42:25] God they don't walk into the doctor
[1:42:27] saying praise God doc God's going to use
[1:42:30] you to heal me because the word of God
[1:42:32] says I'm Healed by the stripes of Jesus
[1:42:34] Christ I just thought maybe you'd like
[1:42:36] to work along with the Lord but if you
[1:42:39] don't I'm going to get healed
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:47] anyway you don't say oh now fix me up
[1:42:51] doc and then I'm all healed and then you
[1:42:52] say oh I'm Healed oh the promise is
[1:42:57] true come
[1:42:59] on no no that's not what he wants this
[1:43:04] church to achieve he wants this church
[1:43:07] to achieve an
[1:43:09] absolute absolute belief in the
[1:43:13] unadulterated word of God every promise
[1:43:16] in the book is mine every chapter every
[1:43:20] verse every ly if he said so that
[1:43:23] settles
[1:43:25] it I believe for my children I believe
[1:43:29] for my loved ones I believe for
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:34] anybody I don't care I'm not looking its
[1:43:38] symptoms that's not my world I don't
[1:43:42] live in the world of symptoms I don't
[1:43:44] live in the world of Education I don't
[1:43:46] live in the world of science I live in
[1:43:48] the world of promise
[1:43:51] [Applause]
[1:43:52] I live by these
[1:43:56] promises so we we just see and and I I'm
[1:44:01] just talking of the
[1:44:03] pattern that he followed we don't want
[1:44:05] to throw in the towel I hear it all over
[1:44:08] the
[1:44:09] place I never hear a person say oh I'm
[1:44:11] just tired of this world I'm going to
[1:44:13] quit I'm going to
[1:44:16] retire wait a
[1:44:19] minute well what about does God have
[1:44:23] something for me to
[1:44:25] do what would what would you have me to
[1:44:28] do Lord yes sir my time's running out I
[1:44:33] I I'm I'm not going to be on this job
[1:44:35] I'm not going to be on that job my I'm
[1:44:37] school's coming out I'm running out of
[1:44:39] school time's up I'm going to graduate
[1:44:42] now I've got something set before me
[1:44:45] well you don't you don't retire from
[1:44:49] school
[1:44:51] it's about time you can get in God's
[1:44:55] School spend some time in the word and
[1:44:57] wash all that stuff out that they're
[1:44:59] trying to put in your head out there I
[1:45:02] feel sorry for kids cuz you know who's
[1:45:05] teaching them all the people that I
[1:45:07] smoked pot with back in when I was a
[1:45:12] hippie that's who's teaching them I mean
[1:45:15] there are some good Godly teachers but
[1:45:17] I'm talking about the general run of the
[1:45:20] m
[1:45:21] yeah right aren't you glad you got a
[1:45:23] real teacher sent from God the latter
[1:45:27] rain amen the former Reign the teaching
[1:45:30] rign to bring forth the fruit so we're
[1:45:32] talking morning about finding
[1:45:35] yourself in the
[1:45:39] story so brother Bram took these Bible
[1:45:43] stories and he brought those stories to
[1:45:47] us and he goes talks about Mary he talks
[1:45:49] about all these great people through the
[1:45:52] scriptures how that they stuck with
[1:45:55] God's word how they persisted how that
[1:45:58] they battle and and and so we've got to
[1:46:02] take ourselves and put ourselves in the
[1:46:07] story yes sir put yourself in the
[1:46:11] story look at it for yourself make
[1:46:14] contact with the word of God when you
[1:46:17] start reading your Bible you should only
[1:46:19] you should see Jesus Christ in every
[1:46:22] scripture you should see the word of God
[1:46:25] the presence of God the wisdom of God
[1:46:28] the instruction of God for all
[1:46:30] scriptures given for instructions in
[1:46:33] righteousness for
[1:46:36] reproof well you look at
[1:46:39] Moses you know and I always say this you
[1:46:42] know a lot of times people have a a lot
[1:46:45] of negativity towards
[1:46:47] education now I'm not an educated person
[1:46:51] many of you know I never graduated from
[1:46:53] high school in a
[1:46:55] four-year uh
[1:46:59] program and so I like the
[1:47:02] scriptures
[1:47:04] about God using uneducated
[1:47:09] men but you know I can hold that
[1:47:11] scripture in
[1:47:14] unrighteousness cuz God doesn't like
[1:47:16] ignorance
[1:47:18] either amen he don't like an excuse he
[1:47:22] wants people that are working that are
[1:47:24] persistent that are going forward but I
[1:47:26] thought many of you have college
[1:47:29] education which I'm I'm very thankful
[1:47:32] for and if you were to sit down with me
[1:47:35] I'll just make it public if you can
[1:47:37] afford college and you can go to college
[1:47:39] I'm happy that you go to college
[1:47:43] amen if it can earn you more then you
[1:47:47] can earn more you can give more you can
[1:47:49] help your family but Moses was
[1:47:53] educated but it shows what a surrendered
[1:47:56] person can do that has an
[1:48:00] education so you put yourself in the
[1:48:03] story yeah I got a college degree but
[1:48:05] Moses had a college degree but he
[1:48:09] surrendered that hallu to the hands of
[1:48:12] God you put yourself in this story Moses
[1:48:16] was a complete
[1:48:19] failure yes
[1:48:21] sir I don't know if many of you have
[1:48:24] even have had the experience of being a
[1:48:27] complete
[1:48:29] failure but I'll tell
[1:48:31] you when you're a complete failure sir
[1:48:34] it's hard to get out of bed amen it's
[1:48:37] hard to put your feet on the ground you
[1:48:39] don't know where to turn you don't know
[1:48:41] how to think you don't know which way's
[1:48:44] right you don't know which way's left
[1:48:46] you don't know what's wrong you don't
[1:48:49] know anything you're lost you're
[1:48:51] disconnected you're defeated you're
[1:48:54] you're so good every you put everything
[1:48:56] you had into something and it's worked
[1:48:58] out nothing you're broke come on
[1:49:05] pre and you're forced to your
[1:49:08] knees in total
[1:49:12] desperation that was
[1:49:14] Moses I'll never forget that verse it
[1:49:17] stuck with me all my life is from the
[1:49:19] movie The 10 Commandments when Moses is
[1:49:22] being driven into the Wilderness and it
[1:49:24] says Moses didn't know whether to bless
[1:49:27] or to curse the spirit that drove
[1:49:32] him sometimes God drives you to
[1:49:35] places but being a total failure doesn't
[1:49:38] mean anything with
[1:49:40] God that's
[1:49:43] right fact sometimes he might have even
[1:49:46] been the cause of your failure on you
[1:49:48] may have brought it upon your
[1:49:50] yourself you may have made wrong
[1:49:52] decisions but unbelief don't stop God
[1:49:55] that how you put yourself in the in the
[1:49:58] story Moses was educated Moses was
[1:50:02] a complete failure yes sir and God got a
[1:50:05] hold of him God meant him God brought
[1:50:08] him to the burning bush God didn't bring
[1:50:11] me to the burning bush amen I believe
[1:50:13] that God's brought us to the pillar of
[1:50:18] fire you start putting yourself in the
[1:50:22] story look at it look at yourself spend
[1:50:27] time in the story yes
[1:50:30] sir oh I honestly I believe that's what
[1:50:33] brother brandom did I'll never forget I
[1:50:35] heard him preach and he said now here
[1:50:37] comes Jesus and he drops by and picks up
[1:50:40] his friend
[1:50:42] Lazarus
[1:50:43] Hallelujah I'm thinking
[1:50:46] what I grabbed my
[1:50:49] Bible I never saw that before but
[1:50:52] somebody saw
[1:50:54] it someone who put himself in the story
[1:50:57] not just in his mind I think he
[1:50:58] literally put himself in the story but
[1:51:01] he went down and picked up Lazarus to go
[1:51:04] down and see
[1:51:06] John you start finding yourself you
[1:51:09] start finding yourself in the scriptures
[1:51:11] you look at Moses you talk about Moses
[1:51:14] being persistent he kept
[1:51:17] going amen he turned the water
[1:51:20] to
[1:51:21] blood you think that would do it that
[1:51:24] didn't
[1:51:27] work he didn't say okay I'm leaving

[1:51:41] way I I went I thought this would
[1:51:45] work well I walked in there I thought
[1:51:48] man I got a stick
[1:51:53] put yourself in the story how how he
[1:51:56] must have thought what what you think
[1:51:59] that he was up against when he threw the
[1:52:02] stick down and they threw the stick
[1:52:05] down and he stood there what did he go
[1:52:09] back to he didn't go back to the stick
[1:52:12] he went back to the voice that spoke to
[1:52:14] him out of the burning bush he knew that
[1:52:18] God spoke to
[1:52:22] them there he
[1:52:26] was his stick ate that thing then he
[1:52:29] goes down let my people go

[1:53:47] the result that we're after we're after
[1:53:50] the faith in God's word that's what we
[1:53:53] got to be persistent for every single
[1:53:56] one of those denials drove him back to
[1:54:00] the word and he reconfirmed that word in
[1:54:03] his heart God said so I don't care if
[1:54:07] what Pharaoh
[1:54:09] does I'm going to
[1:54:12] do what the Lord told me to do I'm going
[1:54:15] to be persistent I don't care what the
[1:54:18] obstacles are I don't care what the

[1:55:12] boils now Pharaoh was a hard
[1:55:18] nose in fact this scripture says that
[1:55:20] God hardened his
[1:55:22] heart you would think any reasonable
[1:55:27] man would have give up maybe the first
[1:55:31] one's a
[1:55:32] fluke but the second one wait a minute
[1:55:36] something's going on here you think any
[1:55:38] man would give
[1:55:41] up put yourself in the
[1:55:44] story Satan
[1:55:46] resists God loves to try his children
[1:55:50] the prophet of God preached and be
[1:55:51] certain of God you be certain of God God
[1:55:54] loves to put his children to the test he
[1:55:57] will loves to see if they'll stick with
[1:55:59] it if they'll keep pressing for it I'm
[1:56:02] asking you this morning are you pressing
[1:56:05] for that faith that was once delivered
[1:56:08] to the Saints it is the promise of the
[1:56:12] age that this church would be a second
[1:56:15] book of
[1:56:18] Acts because there's people yes sir that
[1:56:22] are just as joyous with the promise
[1:56:25] Hallelujah they don't need the see the
[1:56:28] result the result doesn't have to come
[1:56:30] in any time in any season the result is
[1:56:35] in their faith and in the promise it'll
[1:56:38] come when it comes but it's
[1:56:45] coming he kept going hail Locust finally
[1:56:50] the firstborn in
[1:56:52] Egypt and that didn't even stop
[1:56:56] them they had to be
[1:56:59] persistent until they got to that
[1:57:01] Promised Land yes sir put yourself in
[1:57:05] the
[1:57:06] story maybe there's things pressing
[1:57:09] against you maybe you're trying things
[1:57:12] and you think they ought have
[1:57:14] worked don't give up yes sir don't quit
[1:57:19] amen if God be for you who can be
[1:57:21] against you you have a desire in your
[1:57:26] heart it's God's desire to give you the
[1:57:29] desire of your heart fear not little
[1:57:31] children yes sir it's the father's good
[1:57:34] pleasure to give you the kingdom but F
[1:57:37] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:57:41] everything will be added unto you other
[1:57:43] words seek first the peace that comes in
[1:57:48] believing every Pro promise and then
[1:57:50] you'll be content in whatever state
[1:57:53] you're
[1:57:54] in we don't measure Faith by Prosperity
[1:57:59] we don't measure Christianity by
[1:58:02] Prosperity amen if fact it's harder for
[1:58:05] a rich man to enter the Kingdom of
[1:58:08] Heaven than it is for a camel to crawl
[1:58:10] through the narrow needle
[1:58:14] gate it's not our
[1:58:18] world
[1:58:20] we can't start measuring ourselves by
[1:58:22] the world our faith doesn't fit in the
[1:58:26] world we're
[1:58:28] sojourners amen yes God promised us oh
[1:58:33] Hallelujah it it's not a description
[1:58:36] it's a
[1:58:38] promise that we would be sojourners it's
[1:58:41] a promise we won't get attached to this
[1:58:43] world it's a promise we won't be a part
[1:58:46] of the world it's a promise God promised
[1:58:49] his children that they'd be sojourners
[1:58:52] in a foreign land this is a foreign land
[1:58:55] to me it is not our world thank God for
[1:58:58] the promise that I don't live by that

[1:59:10] son and daughter of God lives by the
[1:59:13] word of God man shall not live by bread
[1:59:17] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:59:21] from the mouth of the
[1:59:23] father that's what we're contending for
[1:59:26] we're contending for the faith amen that

[2:06:06] injury maybe God saved you from an
[2:06:08] accident maybe he did something for you

[2:07:28] in amen he made his
[2:07:31] stand with the word in closing we could
[2:07:33] take just a few more this morning but my
[2:07:38] point is put yourself in the
[2:07:42] story one of the things the prophet of
[2:07:44] god mentioned over and over again David
[2:07:46] was an ordinary man Abraham was an
[2:07:49] ordinary man there was nothing special
[2:07:52] about
[2:07:55] him since when do we have to be
[2:07:58] extraordinary since when do we have to
[2:08:01] be Superman since when do we have to be
[2:08:05] popular I'll tell you I thank God for
[2:08:08] the brothers in this
[2:08:09] church I thank God for brother Paul and
[2:08:13] brother Randy and brother Billy and
[2:08:15] brother Matthew and the brothers that
[2:08:17] work with the young I thank God for
[2:08:19] their
[2:08:20] Ministries I thought man I don't even
[2:08:22] have to come
[2:08:24] home these guys can all preach yeah
[2:08:27] better than I can don't say Amen too
[2:08:29] loud I I still got
[2:08:33] feelings no why because it's the word
[2:08:37] we're not about personality we're not
[2:08:39] about places we're about what can we do
[2:08:43] to further this gospel what can we do to
[2:08:45] make this gospel live what can we do to
[2:08:48] to share this gospel what am I doing to
[2:08:51] further the kingdom of God am I going to
[2:08:54] throw in the towel or am I going to be
[2:08:57] persistent am I going to let my flesh
[2:08:59] rise up a sin in my flesh a sin in my
[2:09:04] past and I'm going to stop right there
[2:09:08] I'm going to let Satan build a lie wall
[2:09:11] and I'm not going to press through
[2:09:13] it no put yourself in the
[2:09:17] scriptures the woman that touched the
[2:09:19] Hem of His
[2:09:21] Garment she had a personal
[2:09:25] problem I presume it's not the kind of
[2:09:27] problem you talk about
[2:09:31] much
[2:09:32] and she' done all she
[2:09:36] could she had spent all her
[2:09:42] money she's
[2:09:44] broke maybe you've tried and tried and
[2:09:47] tried
[2:09:51] maybe you spent your money on
[2:09:53] therapy maybe you spent your money on
[2:09:56] doctors maybe you spent your money on
[2:09:58] things to make you feel
[2:10:00] good whatever she spent everything she
[2:10:04] had and
[2:10:06] finally she
[2:10:08] had no
[2:10:10] hope but maybe she
[2:10:13] heard about this
[2:10:16] woman her DET test Tony maybe she saw
[2:10:20] something else so she thought she would
[2:10:23] go in there and Touch the Hem of His
[2:10:24] Garment but you realize she had to fight
[2:10:27] herself through the crowd to Touch the
[2:10:29] Hem of His Garment you know many times
[2:10:32] you have to fight yourself through the
[2:10:35] church crowd the crowd that's sitting
[2:10:38] right here the people that you know the
[2:10:40] way that we act the atmosphere that
[2:10:43] we're in you got to fight your way
[2:10:45] through that you got to fight your way
[2:10:47] past what they'll think you got to fight
[2:10:50] your way past what the norm is you got
[2:10:52] to fight your past oh I'm going to make
[2:10:54] a disturbance oh I might break down and
[2:10:57] cry I might shout oh no she had to fight
[2:11:00] she had to be persistent she had to push
[2:11:03] herself through the crowd all the
[2:11:05] backsliding lazy
[2:11:10] unbelief she had to press her way
[2:11:12] through she had to fight the way
[2:11:15] through and all she did is said if I
[2:11:18] could just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[2:11:22] she didn't even need
[2:11:31] recognition you don't have to run to the
[2:11:37] altar if your heart's
[2:11:39] right you can Touch the Hem of His
[2:11:42] Garment of course you touch to him a
[2:11:45] garment it might make you come to the
[2:11:46] altar right
[2:11:49] but she was satisfied with that just
[2:11:52] touching him and that's all she wanted
[2:11:55] to do when she came to that church
[2:11:57] service that morning all she wanted to
[2:12:00] do was Touch the Hem of His Garment she
[2:12:03] didn't want to sit through a two-hour
[2:12:05] service didn't want to listen to that
[2:12:07] balded beard guy for two hours she
[2:12:09] wanted to touch the ham of His Garment
[2:12:12] she wanted to touch him she was going to
[2:12:15] be persistent she was going to press
[2:12:17] through she was going to everything that
[2:12:19] was said that she didn't agree with she
[2:12:21] just spit out the seeds she just kept
[2:12:24] going there was one thing one purpose
[2:12:26] one goal on her mind and that was to
[2:12:29] touch
[2:12:32] Jesus put yourself in the story
[2:12:38] amen do we come in church and worry
[2:12:41] about how packed we are do we come to
[2:12:43] church worrying about what people think
[2:12:46] do we come to church or do you walk
[2:12:48] through that door say I've got a loved
[2:12:50] one my husband's not saved time's
[2:12:53] running out Lord I Need To Touch the Hem
[2:12:56] of your garment I'm here to touch him
[2:12:58] for you Lord I know you can do a miracle
[2:13:00] I put myself I watch the miracle you did
[2:13:03] in Moses I watch the miracle you did in
[2:13:05] David I watch the miracle that you did
[2:13:07] in this woman that touched the Hem of
[2:13:09] His Garment I'm putting myself in the
[2:13:12] story I'm that woman this morning I'm
[2:13:15] that brother this morning I'm the one
[2:13:17] here that touched K you put yourself in
[2:13:19] the
[2:13:21] story cuz you're
[2:13:23] persistent you're
[2:13:26] persevering you press through the
[2:13:30] crowd you press through the
[2:13:33] atmosphere you press
[2:13:35] through wouldn't it be terrible if that
[2:13:39] we got such to such Church manners and
[2:13:43] such a church program and everything
[2:13:46] just so set in order and and everything
[2:13:49] that we can't have a
[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:53] breakthrough that a breakthrough is kind
[2:13:55] of against our
[2:13:58] custom our our instant pot roast might
[2:14:02] get too
[2:14:05] dry we'll lose all the gravy in our
[2:14:08] crock
[2:14:10] pot we don't
[2:14:13] carry but sometimes you got to press
[2:14:15] through the church crowd you got to
[2:14:17] press through the church atmosphere you
[2:14:20] got to be persistent if nobody else is
[2:14:22] persistent you're persistent if
[2:14:24] everybody's going to leave you're not
[2:14:25] going to leave you're going to do what
[2:14:28] it takes you're desperate you've got to
[2:14:31] Touch the Hem of His
[2:14:33] Garment I think of the woman that washed
[2:14:35] his
[2:14:37] feet I love this
[2:14:40] story because I'm not a woman but I
[2:14:44] certainly was a man that because every
[2:14:47] bit is
[2:14:49] guilty and the prophet of God said as
[2:14:52] she sat
[2:14:54] there she looked and she saw Jesus
[2:14:58] sitting there
[2:14:59] and and they she saw how he was being
[2:15:03] treated and she had money in her
[2:15:06] pocket and she was so moved
[2:15:09] upon how he just sat there and was
[2:15:14] humiliated and looked at all those guys
[2:15:17] making fun of him and she knew they were
[2:15:21] Hypocrites and she said you know what I
[2:15:24] can't take
[2:15:26] this she is going to do something a
[2:15:31] prostitute ill- famed
[2:15:34] woman some places wouldn't even wand her
[2:15:37] in the house of the
[2:15:41] Lord it just be like if some person
[2:15:43] would come in here this morning and
[2:15:45] maybe they don't wear their hair the way
[2:15:47] we do maybe they don't have their dress
[2:15:50] as long as we do maybe they have high
[2:15:52] heels on earrings on maybe they just
[2:15:54] don't
[2:15:55] know I question are they
[2:15:58] welcome or are we oh my goodness look at
[2:16:01] that brother mcgary's people wear high
[2:16:05] heels praise God I wish you all had high
[2:16:08] heels and you all got
[2:16:12] saved what we
[2:16:16] want
[2:16:18] I believe Billy Paul said that that he
[2:16:21] he never caught a fish that was already
[2:16:25] cleaned did you hear what brother
[2:16:27] brandom said in this tape he said we're
[2:16:30] here to snatch you out of the hand of
[2:16:33] the devil that's what he said that's a
[2:16:36] direct
[2:16:38] quote he said stay and listen we're here
[2:16:41] to get you out of that to snat you out
[2:16:44] of
[2:16:46] that put yourself in the
[2:16:49] story where are you in the story are you
[2:16:53] glad she's
[2:16:55] there are you praying for her to have
[2:16:58] the
[2:16:59] courage to lift her hand are you praying
[2:17:03] for her that she might just step forward
[2:17:06] to receive prayer are you calling on the
[2:17:09] angels of the Lord to encamp about them
[2:17:12] and make a difference in their life or
[2:17:15] do we fall into some self-righteousness
[2:17:20] there's no slits in our church
[2:17:22] everywhere wears Flats in our church
[2:17:24] there's no makeup in our
[2:17:26] church well you want to know something
[2:17:29] we need more
[2:17:34] makeup not on theel believer they've
[2:17:36] been washed but we need to bring people
[2:17:39] into the washing power of the Holy
[2:17:42] Spirit we need to invite them into a God
[2:17:45] that loves them and can change their
[2:17:47] life put yourself in the
[2:17:51] story how would you like to have been
[2:17:53] that woman the prophet of God said she
[2:17:56] sat there with that ointment in her hand
[2:17:59] and she looked at him and all of a
[2:18:01] sudden it dawned on her he will know
[2:18:05] where I got the money from to buy
[2:18:11] this
[2:18:13] oh then the
[2:18:15] reproach then the accusation
[2:18:18] everybody will know where I got the
[2:18:23] money what what are people going to
[2:18:26] think will I get him in trouble will I
[2:18:29] do this will I do that the old man mind
[2:18:32] battle
[2:18:34] started but brother B said she looked at
[2:18:37] him she said he'll know where I got this
[2:18:40] money but she said he's the only one
[2:18:45] that can help
[2:18:46] me
[2:18:50] she wanted to be
[2:18:55] different and there he came and boy they
[2:18:59] went off didn't they oh if he would know
[2:19:02] who she was oh she got her money this is
[2:19:05] how she got the money if he was a man of
[2:19:08] God he wouldn't let somebody like that
[2:19:10] touch
[2:19:12] him she was literally touching the Hem
[2:19:15] of His Garment washing his feet put
[2:19:18] yourself in the
[2:19:20] story sometimes the guilt and the shame
[2:19:23] you have to fight past the guilt and the
[2:19:25] shame sure she knew better she probably
[2:19:29] was in
[2:19:30] church she knew she was a failure she
[2:19:33] knew she was dirty she knew all those
[2:19:37] things maybe Satan does that to you
[2:19:40] maybe you look at your past but that day
[2:19:44] she was stepping out of that world in
[2:19:47] into this world Amen she was no longer
[2:19:50] going to be a part of that world she was
[2:19:52] leaving that world she was coming out of
[2:19:55] that world she was going to enter into a
[2:19:57] new world because of the blood and the
[2:20:00] love of Jesus
[2:20:02] Christ when you put yourself in the
[2:20:04] story she was full of
[2:20:07] Shame she was
[2:20:10] hopeless she was
[2:20:13] helpless how am I going to pay my
[2:20:16] rent how am I going to feed how am I
[2:20:19] going to pay my bills how am I going to
[2:20:21] do this how I'm going to do
[2:20:24] that faith says there's a promise amen
[2:20:29] hallelujah Faith said there's a
[2:20:32] testimony faith says if God ever does
[2:20:34] one thing he always will do it the same
[2:20:37] way her faith said he healed that woman
[2:20:40] over there he did this for that person
[2:20:44] maybe she saw blind barus every day when
[2:20:47] she walked by and blind bar ma couldn't
[2:20:50] see blind bar ma didn't know what was
[2:20:52] going on blind bar Ma just heard things
[2:20:55] but Brian bares has cried
[2:20:57] out maybe sometimes if we just put
[2:21:00] oursel in the story maybe you can't see
[2:21:03] tomorrow maybe you can't see the future
[2:21:06] maybe you can't see yourself with the
[2:21:08] husband with the wife maybe you can't
[2:21:10] see yourself with a job maybe you can't
[2:21:14] see you have no vision before you
[2:21:17] you've got
[2:21:19] nothing put yourself in the story think
[2:21:22] of blind Barn
[2:21:24] mayus
[2:21:26] begging every day hoping somebody would
[2:21:29] throw
[2:21:30] something in his
[2:21:33] cup but he cried
[2:21:36] out
[2:21:38] Master have mercy on
[2:21:42] me it wasn't he didn't hear the cry with
[2:21:47] his ear he heard the Cry of the
[2:21:51] heart and anytime there's a crying heart
[2:21:55] Jesus is on the scene his love obligates
[2:22:00] him to the scene and there may we could
[2:22:04] talk about Samson as brother random did
[2:22:07] you would have never expected it from
[2:22:10] Samson he didn't look like a
[2:22:13] preacher he didn't look like a prophet
[2:22:16] he didn't look like had muscles in fact
[2:22:18] that's quite a state in saying he was
[2:22:21] kind of a
[2:22:23] shrimp kind of a mama's
[2:22:25] boy with seven curls not what you
[2:22:29] expect well maybe nobody expects
[2:22:32] anything from
[2:22:34] you but God
[2:22:38] does least he expects you to
[2:22:42] ask and
[2:22:46] so
[2:22:48] I think that it's
[2:22:50] important that we don't let this
[2:22:54] world cause us to throw in the
[2:22:59] towel if they don't want to
[2:23:02] hear I'm not quit
[2:23:05] talking I'm not going to quit testifying
[2:23:08] I'm not going to quit praying I'm not
[2:23:11] going to quit offering to pray for
[2:23:13] people I'm not going to quit giving
[2:23:16] people an opport opportunity to
[2:23:20] hear I'm not going to let that world
[2:23:24] change my world I'm going to be
[2:23:27] persistent in the world I live in to
[2:23:30] achieve the
[2:23:32] goals of Faith that's right to achieve
[2:23:36] Faith a faith that I'm just as happy
[2:23:41] with the promise as I would be if I was
[2:23:46] healed
[2:23:47] amen what an achievement amen what a
[2:23:51] goal to be persistent to what what a re
[2:23:59] setting of our
[2:24:01] mind every
[2:24:03] Christian must be
[2:24:06] persistent they must have a goal
[2:24:09] something they're trying to achieve and
[2:24:12] I believe I want to achieve the promise
[2:24:14] father that the faith
[2:24:18] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:24:20] would rest in me that I would be so
[2:24:25] happy to have the promise just as happy
[2:24:29] to have the promise from you that
[2:24:32] promise means just as much to me as my
[2:24:34] healing this morning because I have 100%
[2:24:38] confidence that the world that I live in
[2:24:42] you created for me and I'm living in the
[2:24:45] world of promise you you put me here
[2:24:48] you'll keep me Lord I put my heart and
[2:24:53] my mind and my soul into your hands
[2:24:57] father let thy will be done we ask it in
[2:25:02] the name of the Lord let's stand
[2:25:12] together go ahead and put this
[2:25:14] on the musicians could come
[2:25:24] play maybe we could ask oursel a little
[2:25:28] question this
[2:25:39] morning have I been
[2:25:43] perseverance to increase my faith
[2:25:50] have
[2:25:51] I have I sought out the promises of God
[2:25:55] in the word of God cuz by
[2:25:59] these precious promises we're partakers
[2:26:03] of divine
[2:26:05] nature and maybe this morning you would
[2:26:09] say maybe you're at home and this is
[2:26:11] just for our congregation
[2:26:13] today say Lord I've just kind of on the
[2:26:19] sidelines I've kind of thrown in the
[2:26:21] towel just a little
[2:26:24] [Music]
[2:26:25] bit i' I've been developing an Exit
[2:26:29] [Music]
[2:26:32] Plan Lord I've been trying to get out of
[2:26:35] work instead of going to
[2:26:40] work I've just thought since I'm just
[2:26:43] nobody
[2:26:44] and nobody sees me and nobody recognized
[2:26:49] me
[2:26:50] [Music]
[2:26:54] and that I'm just kind
[2:26:57] of to the place it really don't matter
[2:27:00] nobody would
[2:27:02] miss
[2:27:05] me and I've just thought maybe I just
[2:27:08] ought
[2:27:10] to just
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:15] withdraw Lord and I have haven't been
[2:27:17] very
[2:27:20] persevering I really haven't had
[2:27:23] anything set before me that I wanted to
[2:27:28] achieve Lord I haven't really tried to
[2:27:32] overcome put an effort into overcoming
[2:27:35] the sin that so easily besets me Lord I
[2:27:39] haven't been persevering in applying the
[2:27:42] token to my
[2:27:44] life I haven't been pers perseverant in
[2:27:48] trying to be
[2:27:51] Sanctified Lord I haven't been very
[2:27:53] perseverant in laying a pattern of Good
[2:27:59] Works visiting the Widow and their
[2:28:01] Affliction and the
[2:28:04] fatherless Lord I don't even know of one
[2:28:06] scriptural work that I'm
[2:28:11] doing Lord I haven't really been very
[2:28:14] putting much
[2:28:15] effort in into achieving
[2:28:19] anything father and I recognize this
[2:28:22] morning that that's the spirit that
[2:28:24] Satan's trying to place on the
[2:28:27] world everybody's talking about a new
[2:28:30] normal just giving up the old don't even
[2:28:34] fight for any principles don't fight for
[2:28:36] nothing just let it all go everything's
[2:28:39] going to
[2:28:41] change I ain't joining that world
[2:28:45] Satan I am not going to become a part of
[2:28:49] that
[2:28:50] world I have a world and it's the Bible
[2:28:54] world it's got Bible stories in it that
[2:28:58] I can place myself in that
[2:29:01] story I can make myself the
[2:29:05] character I can ask myself what would I
[2:29:07] do how would I
[2:29:10] think aren't I in the same spot but just
[2:29:13] in a modern day setting Lord
[2:29:17] and what you did for David you'll do for
[2:29:19] me what you did for Moses you'll do for
[2:29:24] me Lord what you
[2:29:27] did you will do for my loved ones for my
[2:29:36] children oh

[2:29:42] Spirit of
[2:29:45] perseverance may it
[2:29:49] be enkindled in our hearts once
[2:29:53] again may we understand that there's
[2:29:56] supposed to be a book of

[2:30:56] look up for our Redemption draws nigh
[2:30:59] and we would purpose this morning to
[2:31:02] fight the fight to press the mark to
[2:31:06] leave those things which are behind
[2:31:08] behind and press for the higher calling
[2:31:11] in Christ Jesus we ask for it this
[2:31:15] morning if there's any one that's sick
