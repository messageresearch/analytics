[37:48] days with my mother and she's just

[38:44] tonight am i not on
[38:48] i can hear me better
[38:50] okay
[38:53] i'd like to just take a thought tonight
[38:55] this thought
[38:57] came to me
[38:59] and
[39:00] of course we we've been studying the
[39:02] book of uh
[39:06] it is the rising of the sun but
[39:08] as i was going along
[39:11] this certain message stood out to me
[39:14] and especially what's with what's going
[39:17] on
[39:18] everywhere
[39:19] in the world
[39:21] you know
[39:22] i i sit back and i marvel
[39:25] at the things oh mike and ellen's here
[39:28] god bless you thank you there my good to
[39:31] see you i i marvel at the the things
[39:34] that are being spoken
[39:36] and the things that are being said
[39:39] and
[39:41] and
[39:43] hearing them
[39:45] talk about
[39:46] at my mom's house i had an opportunity
[39:49] to
[39:50] watch the news and they showed the
[39:52] filming of all these empty store houses
[39:57] and they were talking about food
[39:59] shortages
[40:01] you know
[40:02] and the possibility of uh
[40:06] with this war that's going on a famine
[40:10] and i thought
[40:12] they don't realize that they're already
[40:14] in a famine
[40:15] that's right
[40:17] so it struck my heart hearing some of
[40:20] the things that they spoke
[40:22] and some of the things that they said
[40:25] i uh this thought come in my heart i'd
[40:27] like to just share with you for a few
[40:29] moments this evening it's called the
[40:31] word is the measure
[40:34] of all things
[40:36] the word is the measure of all things
[40:41] and usually
[40:42] something
[40:43] has to
[40:45] rise to a certain occasion
[40:49] or to a certain
[40:50] level before you use it as a measurement
[40:56] for example in the in the athletic field
[41:01] they
[41:02] they
[41:03] have a man that used to hit a lot of
[41:06] home runs
[41:08] and his name was babe ruth
[41:11] and no matter how many home runs anybody
[41:14] ever hit
[41:15] babe ruth is the measure
[41:17] of home runs
[41:19] because of how many he hit
[41:22] and how many times that he did it so
[41:26] anytime anybody would look at something
[41:28] to measure something by they would say
[41:31] well such and such hit so many home runs
[41:34] but they'd say but he didn't do it in
[41:36] the same time frame
[41:37] someone say he did this but he didn't do
[41:40] it you know
[41:42] the measure of how many games a person
[41:45] can play
[41:46] for a long time it was somebody called
[41:48] ty cobbs but then cal ripken did it now
[41:52] he's the measure
[41:54] every player that comes along they
[41:56] measure how many games are they're going
[41:58] to play so something becomes a measuring
[42:02] stick
[42:03] because it's risen to the occasion
[42:07] and allowed us to see what could be done
[42:12] what could be done what is what's the
[42:15] measure what could be done
[42:17] every sport has uh
[42:19] has the person that they
[42:22] uh
[42:23] that they measured everything by and
[42:26] and and sometimes we come along in those
[42:29] measurements uh fall into disgrace
[42:32] certain person
[42:34] does a certain thing i remember there
[42:36] was a uh
[42:39] a bicycle rider and he did more runs and
[42:42] did everything faster then they found
[42:45] found out that he was under the
[42:46] influence of a drug
[42:49] and therefore his
[42:51] measuring was tainted
[42:54] so you couldn't use him as a measuring
[42:56] because it it wasn't pure
[43:00] so it just declined to lay it out this
[43:03] evening because i just want this to be
[43:05] kind of words of comfort to us
[43:08] this evening is what that we're
[43:10] measuring things by
[43:13] okay we are not measuring
[43:16] current events and that's the title of
[43:20] this message modern events are made
[43:23] clear by prophecy
[43:26] so our measure of what's going on isn't
[43:30] measured by any other thing other than
[43:34] the word of god
[43:35] the word of god is what becomes the
[43:39] measure of all things and the
[43:41] determination of all things and when we
[43:45] can uh
[43:46] rest in that and have an understanding
[43:50] and i like the way that
[43:53] uh our our messenger introduced
[43:57] this
[43:58] and it it's important when we begin to
[44:01] understand
[44:02] that the word of god is prophecy
[44:06] it says for i'd like
[44:08] and he's talking about here as he starts
[44:11] this scripture and i warned you the
[44:13] scripture heaven and earth will pass
[44:15] away
[44:17] so if you're going to have something
[44:19] that you measure something by it can't
[44:22] be measured by something that's
[44:24] constantly changing
[44:27] okay so
[44:28] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[44:32] word won't pass away so if something
[44:35] remains
[44:36] under any circumstance any condition any
[44:40] situation then that's got to be what you
[44:43] measure it by because it is the firm
[44:46] constant
[44:48] and he's saying everything else you see
[44:50] it changes
[44:52] well how would you like to
[44:55] go back when
[44:57] christopher columbus was the mode of
[45:00] transportation
[45:03] i would hate that to be the thing i
[45:06] would have had to have gone seen my
[45:08] mother on horseback
[45:12] i'd still be in midland odessa
[45:18] i mean
[45:19] you you you know and and
[45:21] so
[45:22] you it's it's got to be something if
[45:25] you're going to measure it by if you're
[45:27] going to look out today
[45:30] on all the events and everything that's
[45:33] transpiring you're going to have to be
[45:36] able to look out and what are you
[45:37] measuring it by
[45:40] you understand what
[45:42] what is it
[45:44] that you're seeing
[45:46] and what is it that
[45:48] that's influencing you
[45:51] because there's nothing uncertain in
[45:54] god's word the only thing that is
[45:57] certain is god's word
[46:01] in fact we were admonished to be certain
[46:04] of god
[46:05] no matter what the circumstances is no
[46:08] matter how it appears around us no
[46:11] matter
[46:12] what our senses tell us or what our
[46:15] emotions tell us we can be anchored in
[46:18] the fact that heaven and earth will pass
[46:21] away but my word will not pass away
[46:26] so we're talking this evening about
[46:28] putting on the binoculars of god's word
[46:33] and bringing
[46:35] the situation that the world's in and
[46:38] bringing it into
[46:40] focus
[46:42] and when we do that
[46:45] in the midst of great trial
[46:49] our heart leaps
[46:51] for joy
[46:53] so he he makes this statement he said
[46:57] the story is based on when
[46:59] he jesus was walking on the roads
[47:02] to emmaus
[47:04] and
[47:05] they asked him he says are you but a
[47:07] stranger here
[47:10] don't you know of all that's happened
[47:13] and and and how the
[47:15] the young prophet of galilee
[47:18] how they took them from us
[47:21] and they crucified them and they buried
[47:23] them and we thought this was the one
[47:27] we thought this was going to be our
[47:29] nation and and we were going to come
[47:32] forth and and it was going to be a great
[47:35] thing see
[47:36] they they were looking at
[47:39] the conditions they were looking at the
[47:42] political climate
[47:44] they were looking at the economical
[47:46] climate they were looking at everything
[47:48] around them but they failed to measure
[47:52] it
[47:54] by the word of god
[47:56] and that's what he rebuked them for
[47:59] he said oh slow and hard
[48:04] you know to believe all that the
[48:07] prophets have spoken
[48:10] and i look at myself and i think why
[48:13] i'm
[48:15] sometimes we get slow
[48:18] to really believe
[48:20] what is happening
[48:25] there's something happening
[48:28] there's something moving there's
[48:29] something going on and we want to make
[48:32] sure that we're measuring all that's
[48:34] transpiring as fast as it's transpiring
[48:38] that we're measuring it by the word of
[48:40] god
[48:41] because it's the measure of all things
[48:43] the word is the measure of all things
[48:46] so he he makes this statement he said
[48:51] he said
[48:52] now i'd like to take the subject i'd
[48:54] like to take this
[48:56] the events
[48:57] modern events i made clear by prophecy
[49:02] and it's always been god's unchanging
[49:06] it's always been the unchanging
[49:09] god's way
[49:11] to let his people fore know
[49:15] before certain events
[49:18] happen
[49:20] so prophecy
[49:22] you know you found that that's good
[49:24] that was paragraph
[49:26] 17 i believe
[49:28] so
[49:29] it always
[49:33] it's god's way
[49:36] so that's god's way prophecy is god's
[49:39] way
[49:40] of letting you know
[49:42] or or a foretelling you
[49:44] or letting his people fore know be
[49:47] between certain events happen
[49:51] now don't miss that word certain it
[49:53] isn't like certain things
[49:56] it's events that are certain
[50:02] see they're certain
[50:03] if they're prophesied what's going to
[50:06] happen when god says anything it's going
[50:08] to come to pass if god speaks it it's
[50:10] going to come to pass if he prophesies
[50:13] it's going to come to pass and that's
[50:15] what he told them he said hey
[50:18] guys
[50:20] what happened was what the prophets
[50:23] said would happen
[50:28] and you weren't
[50:30] looking
[50:31] you weren't looking through the eyes of
[50:34] prophecy or in other words you weren't
[50:36] looking through the measuring of god's
[50:39] word if they would have sat back and
[50:42] measured the events by god's word if
[50:45] they would have taken them through god's
[50:47] word they would have seen that
[50:50] everything was perfect right in order
[50:53] and on time
[50:56] so okay we we see that that's that's
[51:00] what's that's the way god
[51:02] does it so again and we look at that
[51:05] because
[51:07] here we are in the lady osean church age
[51:13] now
[51:14] i know when i came into the message i
[51:16] always was
[51:17] thinking that i would be out of here
[51:20] before it got this bad
[51:25] but
[51:26] it's it's beyond reach
[51:31] can you imagine that what we see on the
[51:34] surface
[51:35] and i'm not trying to stimulate your
[51:37] imagination in any way but i don't want
[51:40] to speak about things that the scripture
[51:42] said that are are in darkness and
[51:45] shouldn't even be spoken of but if we
[51:47] can see this condition on the outside
[51:50] what do you think is happening in the
[51:52] hearts and man's
[51:54] hearts and minds of men
[51:59] because the scripture said that they
[52:02] they choose not to retain god in their
[52:04] mind
[52:05] in their thinking and god's given them
[52:08] over to a reprobate mind
[52:14] and
[52:15] and it's terrible even in this
[52:19] message he talked about
[52:22] when the church
[52:23] came under persecution
[52:26] and before the seed went into the ground
[52:28] we'll get into that he said that the
[52:30] soldiers would take uh
[52:33] expecting mothers and and bet
[52:36] on what what the uh the whether it was a
[52:40] boy or a girl
[52:42] boy they'd have a hard time betting
[52:44] nowadays wouldn't they
[52:49] and that that's how cruel
[52:53] and wicked people get
[52:56] remember
[52:57] people
[52:59] the the world will get into such a
[53:01] condition
[53:03] and into such self-righteousness having
[53:06] no regard for god at all the scripture
[53:09] said that they would kill you
[53:11] thinking that they were doing god a
[53:13] service
[53:15] could you imagine if the nominal world
[53:17] today thought it would be best for
[53:20] christianity if they purged this thing
[53:23] in their midst that calls themselves the
[53:26] bride
[53:32] but if we look at it through god's word
[53:36] and so we
[53:38] we look at it through
[53:39] the scriptures so i'm talking about us
[53:42] now
[53:43] coming into an understanding
[53:46] of why
[53:47] our world
[53:50] has got to where it's at
[53:55] why there's everybody's so divided
[53:59] because there's only one thing
[54:02] that unites
[54:04] and that's the love of god and the word
[54:06] of god should have brought in your heart
[54:09] by the holy spirit
[54:12] brother branham said it would let make
[54:14] silk and burlap
[54:16] hug one another
[54:19] you know so
[54:20] uh
[54:22] it's
[54:22] we're talking about taking a moment and
[54:25] looking at what's going on out here and
[54:27] all the craziness that's going on and
[54:30] just pull back for a moment
[54:33] and and let's get us back on
[54:35] measuring it
[54:38] by the word
[54:40] in other words measuring it by prophecy
[54:44] and so
[54:45] if you
[54:46] since you're putting paragraphs up there
[54:48] he said
[54:50] and so
[54:51] just like those disciples they missed
[54:54] what god was doing and he says that's
[54:56] going to repeat today so in paragraph 19
[54:59] he makes this statement
[55:01] he says do you realize
[55:04] that that's promised again in this very
[55:07] age
[55:08] that we're living
[55:09] the lady of sea and age
[55:13] now so what's promised in this age
[55:16] that the word would not become the
[55:18] measuring
[55:20] that events
[55:22] would not be looked at through prophecy
[55:26] and there's the only way you can make
[55:28] any sense
[55:30] out of what's transpiring if you look at
[55:34] it through prophecy
[55:36] if you don't look at it through prophecy
[55:39] you're going to have one political
[55:41] battle you're going to be siding with
[55:43] this group you're going to be siding
[55:45] with this group you're going to be
[55:46] taking this view you're going to be
[55:48] taking that view and all of a sudden
[55:51] you're off
[55:53] into
[55:54] a whole nother realm you've got all
[55:57] kinds of anger you've got all kinds of
[55:59] bitter uh
[56:01] spirits going on you know what i mean
[56:03] you hate people
[56:05] just because somebody told you to hate
[56:07] him
[56:14] you know the prophet god said catholics
[56:16] were some of the nicest people and
[56:17] defended him more than anybody else
[56:22] no we don't judge by anything other than
[56:25] what
[56:26] the word of god
[56:29] so he says now
[56:32] he said the lady of seeing age this
[56:34] seventh church age
[56:37] that we're in now
[56:39] is naked
[56:41] miserable
[56:43] blind
[56:44] and don't know it
[56:47] now just follow this for a moment
[56:50] the same as he blinded them
[56:54] back there
[56:55] for the purpose
[56:57] of getting his message through
[57:01] to
[57:01] the elect
[57:03] people
[57:05] in other words lady the hope it's a
[57:08] prophesied
[57:10] condition you understand lady osea is a
[57:14] prophesied condition if you if we could
[57:18] if you could ever get the world or any
[57:20] people to stand back and look exactly
[57:23] what was prophesied for this day we
[57:26] would sit back and say this is exactly
[57:29] according to the word of god and it
[57:32] makes sense
[57:35] if you measure it by god's word if you
[57:38] don't make look at it through god's word
[57:41] you're confused you're tired you're
[57:43] weary you're sick
[57:49] you don't have any joy
[57:53] you're saying oh i want out of here i
[57:54] don't want to be a part of this anymore
[57:57] instead of saying bring it on even so
[58:00] come quickly lord jesus
[58:04] because you you see
[58:06] that it is perfectly
[58:10] on track
[58:11] it's prophesied the condition
[58:15] was prophesied
[58:18] in order
[58:20] for for the purpose of getting the
[58:23] message through
[58:25] to the elect
[58:28] because the elect has a quality about
[58:30] him
[58:33] that's right the elect
[58:35] has the ability
[58:37] to measure things by god's word
[58:42] not by what's on the surface
[58:47] not back how slick it is
[58:50] or how good it looks or how it tastes
[58:53] smells feels
[58:54] or none of those things
[58:57] it has a sixth sense
[59:00] on the inside it's got a built-in
[59:03] antenna
[59:06] something that's able to receive
[59:10] the word of god
[59:11] so they've got a built-in measuring
[59:14] stick
[59:15] but we can't set that measuring stick
[59:17] aside
[59:18] we've got to understand i've got to walk
[59:21] each day
[59:22] look out each day at the unchanging
[59:25] events because god forewarned me that
[59:29] they would be here he prophesied
[59:33] that ladies would be here when we read
[59:36] it we didn't know how blind miserable or
[59:39] wretched they could get
[59:44] now that took me by surprise
[59:46] but the fact that it's the way that it
[59:48] is should have never taken me by
[59:51] surprise because the word of god told me
[59:54] that they would not
[59:56] retain god in their knowledge and they
[59:59] would be given over to a reprobate mind
[1:00:04] you can't help it
[1:00:07] even in your own experiences how many
[1:00:09] people have you seen you've shared the
[1:00:11] message with they've walked in the
[1:00:13] message for a season and the minute they
[1:00:15] come they leave the message they leave
[1:00:18] everything
[1:00:22] i mean if they used to their lips they
[1:00:24] used to say it's an abomination for a
[1:00:26] woman to cut their hair a was an
[1:00:28] abomination for a a a a woman to pay put
[1:00:32] on a a garment pertaining to a man they
[1:00:36] would refer to jezebel's being the only
[1:00:38] one that paint their face they'd quote
[1:00:40] peter about
[1:00:42] being ordained all these things and
[1:00:44] instantly
[1:00:46] when they no longer want to view the
[1:00:50] events through prophecy
[1:00:53] those events no longer become wrong
[1:01:01] okay so when once you leave that
[1:01:03] leadership
[1:01:06] you understand the divine inspiration
[1:01:09] leadership
[1:01:10] that god's given us to to increase our
[1:01:14] understanding that that that our
[1:01:16] understand would increase the minute
[1:01:19] that you leave that and you walk away
[1:01:21] from that
[1:01:22] now you start to view things
[1:01:26] in a different light in a different
[1:01:28] context and they're no longer measured
[1:01:31] by the word of god people that have done
[1:01:34] those things quit measuring it by the
[1:01:37] prophesied word and they begin to
[1:01:40] measure it by
[1:01:42] the sweet spirit
[1:01:48] jesus died for the world
[1:01:51] but the world's not going to heaven
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:01] because i came for my own
[1:02:06] just think
[1:02:09] they they no longer see
[1:02:13] they they they left looking at the lady
[1:02:16] osean age
[1:02:18] looking at the sodom condition
[1:02:20] looking at everything that was
[1:02:22] prophesied even to the point that they
[1:02:26] rejected the the message and the word
[1:02:29] that was prophesied
[1:02:33] so no longer they lost their measuring
[1:02:35] stick
[1:02:38] their lives were no longer measured by
[1:02:40] the word
[1:02:41] oh god don't care if you do this god
[1:02:43] don't care if you do that it doesn't
[1:02:45] matter to god
[1:02:47] well why would god even put it in the
[1:02:49] book
[1:02:55] he put it there
[1:02:58] william branham didn't put it there
[1:03:04] but you if we if we don't stay steadfast
[1:03:09] on those things then we begin to see
[1:03:13] so the whole purpose of everything
[1:03:16] so understand this this is a prophesied
[1:03:19] condition
[1:03:21] and and the reason it's a prophesied
[1:03:24] condition
[1:03:25] because the the purpose of it was to get
[1:03:28] the the message out
[1:03:30] and that's what he said here in the 24th
[1:03:33] uh
[1:03:35] quote i could just read it but they can
[1:03:37] put it up so quick nowadays
[1:03:39] now we want to be posted
[1:03:42] to know what's to take place for this
[1:03:45] age that we're living in
[1:03:51] so we want to know we want to be posted
[1:03:54] what's to take place in the age that
[1:03:56] we're living in
[1:03:58] right so i want to know what's supposed
[1:04:00] to take place
[1:04:02] not only around me
[1:04:06] but in me
[1:04:09] not only what what the events are out
[1:04:12] there i don't want to be posted because
[1:04:14] i've already been told that he let the
[1:04:17] condition come
[1:04:19] in order to get the message to me
[1:04:23] so i want to be posted because the
[1:04:25] message that he's going to get to me is
[1:04:28] is going to have an effect on me
[1:04:31] personally and what is going on around
[1:04:35] me
[1:04:38] has a purpose
[1:04:42] so he said if you don't understand it he
[1:04:45] said what good would it do
[1:04:47] he said
[1:04:49] like if
[1:04:50] if moses took noah's message
[1:04:55] so he walks into egypt and says hey
[1:04:58] i know how we're going to get out of
[1:04:59] here
[1:05:01] let's build boats and float down the
[1:05:03] nile
[1:05:07] it wouldn't have worked
[1:05:11] you you understand so
[1:05:13] a part of measuring it by the word is
[1:05:16] not only to measure what's out here by
[1:05:18] the word but then to look at us and to
[1:05:21] be able to measure our condition
[1:05:24] and and where we stand and what we
[1:05:27] possess by the same measuring stick
[1:05:31] so he goes on he says here he said so
[1:05:35] you know whenever luther couldn't uh
[1:05:38] you know stay with the catholics what
[1:05:40] good would it have done luther to stay
[1:05:42] with the catholics
[1:05:46] he would have never grown he'd never
[1:05:48] come out he'd never understood
[1:05:49] justification
[1:05:51] or what good would have done wesley to
[1:05:52] stay with the lutherans
[1:05:56] it wouldn't have done any good ok what
[1:05:58] good would it
[1:06:00] have done pentecost to stay
[1:06:03] uh with the methodist
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:07] see it wouldn't work so you you we've
[1:06:10] got to be um moving forward with god's
[1:06:14] word and so he comes down he says what
[1:06:17] good will it do
[1:06:21] what good will it do pentecost
[1:06:25] to continue on
[1:06:28] when the bride's being called
[1:06:33] what good would it do
[1:06:35] to continue on in pentecost when the
[1:06:39] bride's being called
[1:06:42] now we've got to take this calling very
[1:06:45] dear to our hearts
[1:06:47] a very deep revelation and understanding
[1:06:51] that you're being called out of
[1:06:53] something
[1:06:54] up into something
[1:06:57] that the battle no longer is you just
[1:06:59] trying to to to bring this flesh under
[1:07:03] subjection and be in this constant
[1:07:05] warfare with the flesh but we as we've
[1:07:08] been preaching but that god's got a
[1:07:10] quickening power that's going to quicken
[1:07:13] something but now it's not pentecost
[1:07:16] power
[1:07:21] it's not always you need the baptism of
[1:07:23] the holy ghost the baptism of the holy
[1:07:25] ghost you've got to have the baptism and
[1:07:27] holy ghost without the baptism of the
[1:07:29] holy ghost you better understand exactly
[1:07:32] what the holy ghost is
[1:07:34] the holy ghost didn't even come to speak
[1:07:36] of itself
[1:07:40] but to bring you into what remembrance
[1:07:43] of all things that were spoken
[1:07:49] see what what they were rejecting is
[1:07:52] what they always rejected they always
[1:07:54] rejected the word
[1:07:58] so he goes on to say he says what good
[1:08:01] would it do if pentecost to continue on
[1:08:04] when the bride's being called
[1:08:06] now listen see
[1:08:08] we're right up into the seed time
[1:08:12] so this is this is a
[1:08:15] this is a seed time
[1:08:18] we've come out of
[1:08:20] the pentecost he says what good does it
[1:08:22] do you to remain in pentecost
[1:08:26] well i've had gifts restored
[1:08:31] i lay my hands on the sick i've got
[1:08:34] signs and wonders
[1:08:37] he said it won't do you any good to stay
[1:08:39] there
[1:08:41] because this is seed time
[1:08:47] now we're viewing this through the word
[1:08:48] of god
[1:08:51] we're measuring it by the word of god
[1:08:54] we're not measuring it by noah's message
[1:08:57] we're measuring it by the word of god
[1:09:00] and the word of god says it's seed time
[1:09:04] welcome
[1:09:05] so
[1:09:09] it's a
[1:09:10] i guess the best way
[1:09:12] is just read paragraph 31 it kind of
[1:09:14] helps explain it
[1:09:16] he says so
[1:09:18] before we hit that 31 we understand that
[1:09:21] the scripture
[1:09:23] is only understood by inspiration
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:28] the scribes the pharisees all them were
[1:09:32] reading the same book
[1:09:35] and jesus said search the scriptures
[1:09:40] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:09:43] life but they are rich that speak of
[1:09:46] me so he said if you would measure my
[1:09:50] life
[1:09:51] by the word
[1:09:53] you would find out that i fulfilled
[1:09:55] every jot every tittle every line every
[1:09:58] verse but you failed to move up
[1:10:04] into what god's doing
[1:10:09] because there was an exodus
[1:10:13] and so it takes that inspiration
[1:10:16] so we understand the reason that we're
[1:10:19] work we're talking and we're talking
[1:10:21] about measuring because if we sit back
[1:10:24] and we measure it by the word of god
[1:10:27] we're not looking for expectation
[1:10:30] of days gone by
[1:10:35] we're not looking for a blessing of old
[1:10:39] we're not looking for an anointing
[1:10:44] we're not looking of anything
[1:10:47] that compares ourselves
[1:10:49] one with another
[1:10:54] we're into now
[1:10:55] an understanding that i'm going to
[1:10:57] measure everything
[1:11:00] even my my life
[1:11:02] by not
[1:11:04] how i feel
[1:11:07] or not by what works i've done
[1:11:12] because he said man you'll come to my
[1:11:14] day and say lord lord i never use but
[1:11:17] now
[1:11:18] it's going to be measured i am now going
[1:11:20] to measure myself
[1:11:23] by the revealed word of god for the hour
[1:11:28] that's how i measure myself up
[1:11:33] it doesn't matter it's a good church
[1:11:40] are you all they baptized in the name of
[1:11:42] the father son and holy ghost they do
[1:11:44] all they but they're good people they're
[1:11:45] loving people that's good now if i
[1:11:48] measure that by the word of god i look
[1:11:50] at myself said i don't fellowship with
[1:11:52] him
[1:11:54] but i can't go in there and eat food
[1:11:57] that sacrifice to idols
[1:12:03] especially when i know the title written
[1:12:06] on their door is blasphemous names see
[1:12:10] now you're not measuring it by your
[1:12:12] feeling you're not measuring it by your
[1:12:14] own measure of christianity you're not
[1:12:16] measuring it by the personality let me
[1:12:19] tell you satan's got the best
[1:12:20] personality
[1:12:28] but you're measuring sticks the word
[1:12:32] what did the word said he would be
[1:12:36] an angel of
[1:12:38] light
[1:12:41] i'm going to bring you freedom
[1:12:44] from all the way you have to dress
[1:12:47] i'm going to bring you freedom and
[1:12:48] liberty you're now going to be free and
[1:12:51] liberated in christ
[1:12:56] you're going to have love
[1:12:59] for everybody
[1:13:04] that ain't love
[1:13:07] that woman said oh i love that preacher
[1:13:10] and that woman was running around he
[1:13:11] said oh but he's such a good man he
[1:13:14] loves him and i love him so much they're
[1:13:15] such love he said it's not love if it's
[1:13:18] not the word
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:23] that's the measuring stick
[1:13:26] it's not love us if it's not the word
[1:13:30] no satan's
[1:13:34] appearing
[1:13:35] as an angel of light
[1:13:38] but what he's trying to do is change
[1:13:40] your measuring step
[1:13:41] what did he get eve change the measuring
[1:13:44] stick eve
[1:13:45] surely he said surely he won't die don't
[1:13:48] measure it by that
[1:13:50] measure by what you'll become and how
[1:13:53] you'll have the wisdom between god and
[1:13:55] evil and how that you have knowledge and
[1:13:57] to understand all things wrong
[1:14:01] measurement
[1:14:07] it's hard
[1:14:09] especially when the world's accusing you
[1:14:16] of not being open-minded
[1:14:19] well i want you to know i am not
[1:14:21] open-minded
[1:14:23] i don't care about the government i
[1:14:25] don't care about their laws i'm not
[1:14:27] afraid of the irs i'm not afraid of that
[1:14:31] i'm not afraid if i get every dollar
[1:14:33] bill and everything in the right place
[1:14:35] and all that i'm not afraid of those
[1:14:37] things
[1:14:40] because if god don't watch the city the
[1:14:42] watchman watches in vain anyway
[1:14:48] you know okay you can't
[1:14:50] you just can't do things anymore without
[1:14:53] them
[1:14:54] you look at it through one set of eyes
[1:14:56] it's impossible you look at it through
[1:14:59] the word which is the measuring stick
[1:15:01] all things are possible
[1:15:07] all things are possible
[1:15:09] that's what the word of god says and it
[1:15:10] just you've got to have a place that
[1:15:13] you're measuring it by that you're
[1:15:14] influencing it by
[1:15:16] that it's saying and without faith it's
[1:15:19] impossible to please god
[1:15:22] so it's got to it that's got to be the
[1:15:25] measuring stick so the measuring stick
[1:15:27] has got to be the word that's inspired
[1:15:30] to you let's take verse
[1:15:33] 1
[1:15:36] uh 30
[1:15:39] and he is the word
[1:15:42] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:15:44] word was with god and the word was god
[1:15:48] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:15:50] among us he is the word
[1:15:54] so
[1:15:57] putin is not controlling it
[1:16:01] our president's not controlling it
[1:16:05] we know who controls the world
[1:16:08] powers principality and spiritual
[1:16:10] wickedness in high places
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:22] now let's measure it by the word of god
[1:16:24] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:16:27] god that is christ jesus
[1:16:34] no sickness no death no peril no sword
[1:16:37] or nothing
[1:16:39] all that the father had given me will
[1:16:42] come
[1:16:43] see if he's the the thing that all this
[1:16:46] he's trying to do is discredit the word
[1:16:49] of god and separate us from our
[1:16:52] measuring stick
[1:16:55] he said now
[1:16:57] he said therefore
[1:17:01] paragraph 31 therefore we're living in
[1:17:04] the day
[1:17:06] when the
[1:17:07] manifestation
[1:17:09] of the word of god
[1:17:10] has come to a different
[1:17:14] age
[1:17:22] in other words there's a different
[1:17:25] manifestation
[1:17:28] of the word than pentecost
[1:17:34] this word is going to be manifested a
[1:17:36] different way
[1:17:38] now understand
[1:17:40] what
[1:17:42] the one blessing was
[1:17:44] the one blessing was from the outside
[1:17:47] down
[1:17:50] right it was an anointing
[1:17:54] and therefore
[1:17:55] the wheat
[1:17:56] rejoiced in it
[1:17:59] and the other grain
[1:18:02] weeds
[1:18:03] rejoiced in it it was gone it was coming
[1:18:06] from the outside
[1:18:09] working
[1:18:10] in this is a different
[1:18:13] dispensation
[1:18:16] he says it this way he says
[1:18:19] he says the word of god manifests in a
[1:18:21] different age than the pentecostal age
[1:18:24] it's manifested in a different age than
[1:18:27] the pentecostal way it's manifested in a
[1:18:30] different way than it was manifested in
[1:18:33] pentecost
[1:18:35] therefore there's only one way we can
[1:18:37] measure it
[1:18:39] we can't measure it by blessings that
[1:18:42] have gone by
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:46] we can only measure it by what it time
[1:18:50] it is
[1:18:52] and what time is this this is
[1:18:55] seed
[1:18:56] time
[1:19:01] that's how we measure it it's seed time
[1:19:03] i'll close up
[1:19:04] because it's starting to get so good
[1:19:10] so
[1:19:11] it's a different manifestation
[1:19:14] it's not from the outside in
[1:19:20] see that's that's the way it was
[1:19:24] it was from the outside in
[1:19:27] they received a blessing they received
[1:19:29] an anointing
[1:19:31] they received the leadership that led
[1:19:33] them and guide them but this was beyond
[1:19:36] that
[1:19:38] this age this is seed time
[1:19:41] this is
[1:19:42] god's working from the inside out
[1:19:48] because there's something in there
[1:19:51] right there's a seed in there this is
[1:19:54] the time of the seed never was a time of
[1:19:58] the seed before
[1:20:03] you know what pentecost was
[1:20:06] it's what protected
[1:20:08] the seed
[1:20:11] that's all it was it was a protection of
[1:20:14] the seed but the minute that seed
[1:20:16] started to get germinated it pulled away
[1:20:22] it went denominated it pulled away
[1:20:26] all the blessings and all the anointings
[1:20:29] and all those things was to keep you
[1:20:31] right there
[1:20:33] until you could be germinated
[1:20:39] by the pure unadulterated
[1:20:42] word of god
[1:20:47] that's where it grows from
[1:20:50] it grows from the inside out
[1:20:53] it doesn't measure it anymore by what's
[1:20:56] transparent what's transpiring on the
[1:20:59] outside it measures it by what's
[1:21:01] transpiring on the inside in other words
[1:21:04] god's enlightening me he's giving me
[1:21:07] revelation he's given me isab that i can
[1:21:10] see he's given me gold tried in fire
[1:21:13] character he's giving me white raymond
[1:21:17] i'm supping with him
[1:21:23] it's
[1:21:25] it's a seed time
[1:21:31] this is the time we're in
[1:21:33] it's in the time of the personal
[1:21:36] germination
[1:21:40] the word of god is
[1:21:43] uh i
[1:21:44] i probably bit off more than i can
[1:21:46] choose so
[1:21:48] uh
[1:21:49] but anyway
[1:21:51] he says
[1:21:53] he says
[1:21:55] the bible is a different book
[1:22:00] the bible is not like any other book
[1:22:02] it's a different book
[1:22:04] in other words it's god's thoughts
[1:22:06] expressed
[1:22:09] it's god in word form
[1:22:12] in other words god's doing what he's
[1:22:14] doing
[1:22:16] and he's doing it
[1:22:19] how many we all thought remember when
[1:22:21] rory brown talked about russia and
[1:22:23] russia and i just sit back i'd shrink
[1:22:25] back and think oh my goodness it's not
[1:22:27] even called russia
[1:22:31] it's the soviet union
[1:22:34] what's he talking about
[1:22:39] i know none of you are old enough to
[1:22:40] remember that
[1:22:47] i mean i believed it
[1:22:50] but it just embarrassed me
[1:22:55] you know
[1:22:57] when i first came in i didn't have a
[1:22:59] revelation of the son of man
[1:23:01] i had a revelation of malachi 4 5 but
[1:23:04] when he talked about those two
[1:23:05] messengers going down to some sodom one
[1:23:08] being billy graham and one being over
[1:23:09] office i thought you know this mess
[1:23:10] would be a whole lot easier if he left
[1:23:12] it out
[1:23:16] but it was in there yes sir
[1:23:19] you you understand because a seed
[1:23:23] the word of god's a seed
[1:23:25] jesus described it as
[1:23:28] as a seed because that that's what it is
[1:23:31] it's it's a seed and and because it's a
[1:23:35] seed
[1:23:36] if
[1:23:38] he said he said
[1:23:40] now the bible's a different book from
[1:23:42] any other sacred book
[1:23:44] that's 46. there's no book like the
[1:23:47] bible because the bible is god in word
[1:23:50] form
[1:23:51] a word is a thought expressed god's
[1:23:54] thinking expressed it
[1:23:57] his words through the prophets
[1:24:00] that they wrote the bible which was in
[1:24:04] word form jesus called it a seed
[1:24:08] and any seed will bring forth in
[1:24:11] of its kind
[1:24:12] if it's in the right condition and the
[1:24:15] right atmosphere now let me tell you
[1:24:18] something
[1:24:19] about this wicked evil world
[1:24:22] it will produce
[1:24:24] real christians
[1:24:29] you've got to be a real christian to
[1:24:31] live according to this word
[1:24:35] you can have tons of anointing on you
[1:24:39] but it's not anointing time
[1:24:42] it's seed time
[1:24:45] remember the three circles and then that
[1:24:47] down inside one had a little snake and
[1:24:49] the other had a seed and it took the the
[1:24:52] only thing that they they would know it
[1:24:54] is because that seed was terminated how
[1:24:57] many of you look at yourself you're a
[1:24:59] wreck you don't like what you see in the
[1:25:01] mirror you want to change but there's
[1:25:03] that seed inside of you that you're
[1:25:06] trapped
[1:25:07] as matthew says it's a setup
[1:25:19] because he's not working from the
[1:25:21] outside in
[1:25:23] he's working from the inside out
[1:25:29] he's moving you he's changing he's
[1:25:31] calling you
[1:25:33] he says
[1:25:35] so that's why we're where we're at
[1:25:38] it takes this condition
[1:25:44] for the elect
[1:25:46] to be called out
[1:25:49] the church world teaches you how to cope
[1:25:51] with it
[1:25:54] they explain it
[1:25:56] the worse it gets the more good works
[1:25:58] they try to do
[1:26:03] now i believe in works don't get me
[1:26:04] wrong
[1:26:05] just like i believe in shouting i
[1:26:07] believe in being blessed
[1:26:12] i believe in being anointed
[1:26:16] i'm all good with that but it ain't the
[1:26:18] evidence of anything
[1:26:22] it don't mean you got it
[1:26:26] you know what it means you've got it
[1:26:28] this thing in here keeps going back to
[1:26:30] the word going back to the word
[1:26:33] and when you're not doing right this
[1:26:35] thing in here haunts you like a hound
[1:26:38] dog
[1:26:42] he said
[1:26:43] he said so it's a seed in the right
[1:26:46] condition it'll come first
[1:26:48] it's got to come according to the word
[1:26:51] if it comes from god paragraph 48
[1:26:54] because it's to vindicate or to prove
[1:26:57] god's
[1:26:59] presence
[1:27:03] how do i know god's with me
[1:27:06] because everything he's prophesied is
[1:27:10] coming to pass
[1:27:12] that's exactly right i see
[1:27:16] it i recognize it
[1:27:19] i'm measuring it by the word
[1:27:25] it's beautiful
[1:27:29] it's hallelujah it's not woe's me it's
[1:27:32] praise god
[1:27:35] hallelujah amen
[1:27:38] if
[1:27:39] he said
[1:27:41] and he foreknew
[1:27:43] all these things
[1:27:45] by his foreknowledge
[1:27:47] he ordained and foreign
[1:27:50] it's called in the bible predestinated
[1:27:54] ordained foreordained it
[1:27:56] called predestinat
[1:27:58] predestinated every age to its place
[1:28:03] every man to its place
[1:28:06] every messenger to its place
[1:28:10] he's god
[1:28:11] the devil ain't pulling nothing over on
[1:28:13] him
[1:28:15] and he's god and he has ordained
[1:28:17] everything to take place
[1:28:20] and falls just exactly in line with his
[1:28:26] word
[1:28:29] peace like a river
[1:28:32] glory to god
[1:28:33] lord i never thought it would be this
[1:28:35] way
[1:28:36] i never thought it would get so dark you
[1:28:38] said perilous times would come i didn't
[1:28:41] think they would be this perilous
[1:28:46] but it was ordained
[1:28:48] it was ordained because the condition
[1:28:52] has got to be ordained in order for the
[1:28:56] seed
[1:28:57] to come to life
[1:29:03] and i think that's where a lot of us
[1:29:05] missed it
[1:29:08] we had to get it mentally first
[1:29:13] before it could drop into our heart
[1:29:17] and then start coming to life
[1:29:19] and growing
[1:29:21] in into life
[1:29:23] so it it's it it it's
[1:29:26] everything is perfect
[1:29:29] according what god
[1:29:30] intended
[1:29:32] to accomplish
[1:29:33] he intended to have a bride
[1:29:36] he intended to prove her
[1:29:39] he intended for the world to be the most
[1:29:42] wicked
[1:29:43] delightful pleasurable sin
[1:29:48] he elected to tempt you
[1:29:51] and to try you
[1:29:53] and to prove you
[1:29:56] everything's exactly
[1:29:58] get drawn away and then get out there
[1:30:00] like the prodigal son and just can't
[1:30:03] stand it and just got to make your way
[1:30:05] back you come back and you know it's god
[1:30:08] because you come back right in the same
[1:30:10] place i'd just rather be a servant in
[1:30:12] your house father
[1:30:16] i'm not worthy to be called your son
[1:30:20] here let me work in the field i'll just
[1:30:22] be happy
[1:30:23] just to be on your property
[1:30:27] a seed time
[1:30:29] kill the fatted calf
[1:30:31] get the road
[1:30:33] my son which is lost
[1:30:36] has returned
[1:30:38] amen
[1:30:39] this is seed time
[1:30:42] it's a glorious time
[1:30:45] it's a wonderful time so the the word
[1:30:49] is the measure
[1:30:51] of all things
[1:30:52] fox news is not the measurement
[1:30:57] of current events
[1:31:02] or is
[1:31:03] c
[1:31:04] b n and
[1:31:06] and m s n
[1:31:08] b
[1:31:09] c or
[1:31:10] whatever
[1:31:11] there are
[1:31:13] it's not the measure
[1:31:16] the measure for us is
[1:31:18] wow
[1:31:20] the word of god is coming to pass
[1:31:23] the word of god's coming to pass and i'm
[1:31:26] coming to pass
[1:31:31] the condition
[1:31:33] is going to produce
[1:31:36] the bride
[1:31:39] the condition produced the message
[1:31:43] to produce the bride
[1:31:45] behold
[1:31:47] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:31:48] lord
[1:31:49] i'll send you elijah the prophet and he
[1:31:52] shall turn the hearts
[1:31:57] of the children
[1:31:58] back to the fathers
[1:32:00] if it's not movements
[1:32:03] it's not politics
[1:32:06] you see but you see the promised word
[1:32:12] the purpose condition
[1:32:15] all the things are viewed
[1:32:18] through the word
[1:32:20] so when they say food shortage
[1:32:23] how many knows they've been actually
[1:32:25] talking about food charges
[1:32:28] fuel shortages
[1:32:32] world war three
[1:32:37] oh i kind of i sit back and i think you
[1:32:39] know what
[1:32:42] i don't know
[1:32:45] there may not be enough food
[1:32:47] but i've always had a model
[1:32:50] as a christian
[1:32:51] where there's any there's plenty
[1:32:57] and i'll not suffer my righteous to beg
[1:32:59] bread
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:04] i just got to do things through god's
[1:33:06] word
[1:33:09] i've got to put the blinders on i got to
[1:33:12] turn off the voices
[1:33:15] and i've got to look at it
[1:33:18] else not we're no different
[1:33:21] than anybody else
[1:33:23] we're walking down the road saying do
[1:33:25] you see the whole world's falling apart
[1:33:26] and
[1:33:27] such and such and i don't know
[1:33:29] such-and-such you know and
[1:33:31] and
[1:33:32] and
[1:33:33] you know
[1:33:34] no i hate to inform everybody but
[1:33:38] donald trump might be a bigger devil
[1:33:40] than the devil we got
[1:33:47] i'm just honest with you
[1:33:49] there's no political party that's going
[1:33:51] to save this boat
[1:33:53] there's no movement there's no college
[1:33:55] there's no there's no unity
[1:34:00] i don't know i heard the other day one
[1:34:02] of the movie stars went up and slapped
[1:34:04] another movie star place has gone crazy
[1:34:10] looney tunes was something we used to
[1:34:12] watch on
[1:34:13] on saturday morning
[1:34:17] you know with this loony out here
[1:34:22] but isn't it exactly what he said
[1:34:25] oh rejoice as you see the day coming
[1:34:28] look up for your rejection draws nigh
[1:34:32] amen rejoice as you see the day coming
[1:34:36] the fulfillment of god's word
[1:34:38] let's measure it by god's word let's
[1:34:41] measure yourself by god's words how's
[1:34:44] your faith
[1:34:48] you don't think he's going to get this
[1:34:50] world in a condition that you've got to
[1:34:52] use faith why do you think he's going to
[1:34:54] get it to where you've got to use faith
[1:34:56] why is it going to take faith
[1:35:00] we got to do something about this
[1:35:01] building
[1:35:03] we had 293 people
[1:35:06] as much as i'd like to fire marshall to
[1:35:09] to receive this message i don't want him
[1:35:12] here until
[1:35:15] he don't have to cheat on his job

[1:35:24] and 64 people watching online
[1:35:30] lumber's going through the roof

[1:35:38] huh
[1:35:40] how what do you think lumber cost noah
[1:35:42] i'll guarantee it was higher than it
[1:35:44] ever was
[1:35:48] pitch was probably
[1:35:51] 20 shinglings a barrel up from five
[1:35:58] don't matter
[1:36:00] you understand we're in it together
[1:36:02] we're going to build the church i'm not
[1:36:04] building the church
[1:36:07] the only reason i'm the contractor is
[1:36:09] there's no separation between me and you
[1:36:13] we are building this church together
[1:36:16] those that have a vision
[1:36:19] and understand the pastor's vision and
[1:36:22] are behind the pastor's vision they're
[1:36:24] the ones that's going to build this
[1:36:26] church
[1:36:27] not the rules of the government or the
[1:36:30] law of everything you measure it by
[1:36:32] god's word and all things are possible
[1:36:35] where are we going to get the money i
[1:36:37] like what brother tim pruitt he said
[1:36:38] we've got the money but it's in your
[1:36:40] account
[1:36:51] all things are possible
[1:36:53] when we bind together in faith
[1:36:56] when we don't let all the craziness
[1:36:58] that's on in this world and all the fear
[1:37:04] i mean i can't tiptoe around the gospel
[1:37:10] i mean
[1:37:11] i can't be careful i don't preach
[1:37:13] against this and careful i don't preach
[1:37:15] against this
[1:37:17] you know you get so
[1:37:19] afraid that you're going to offend
[1:37:20] somebody that
[1:37:22] you know what i mean you can't hardly
[1:37:24] preach against nothing
[1:37:26] and then nobody gets fed that's right
[1:37:29] now let's go forward
[1:37:31] let's stand strong
[1:37:34] on god's word
[1:37:36] let's believe
[1:37:38] some of the old-timers that remember
[1:37:40] brother mike got i remember me and mike
[1:37:42] sat down there's no way we was going to
[1:37:43] build this church
[1:37:46] this church
[1:37:47] all a hundred and seventy thousand
[1:37:49] dollars of it
[1:37:52] we couldn't believe it
[1:37:54] mike great big long history in banking
[1:37:56] he knew how to put the stuff together so
[1:37:59] we finally go to the bank and we're all
[1:38:01] timid and everything and the banker
[1:38:03] walks out
[1:38:05] and he's a friend of mine
[1:38:07] hey dave what's up
[1:38:09] what are you doing great i said oh
[1:38:11] you're over here and now yeah yeah what
[1:38:13] do you guys want to do build the church
[1:38:14] no problem
[1:38:22] when we moved into this building we only
[1:38:24] filled up the first four rows
[1:38:27] wow
[1:38:28] we are scattered in here and people are
[1:38:30] looking what have we
[1:38:33] done
[1:38:37] hey amen what have we done
[1:38:40] it was like an echo like a can in here
[1:38:47] and nights like this are going to feel
[1:38:49] like that over there
[1:38:51] until we get on fire
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:55] till we get in it together but god's
[1:38:58] moving
[1:39:00] and i want you know everything's perfect
[1:39:02] everything's according to his time
[1:39:04] everything's wonderful
[1:39:07] and if we stick together if two can put
[1:39:10] or one can put ten thousand to flight i
[1:39:12] don't got the scripture a thousand then
[1:39:15] two of us can do ten thousand
[1:39:17] we can do all things
[1:39:19] and and it's gonna get better and god's
[1:39:22] gonna move
[1:39:23] and it's wonderful
[1:39:25] and after
[1:39:28] about two and a half years they finally
[1:39:30] accepted our application for our first
[1:39:32] permit

[1:41:10] heavenly father
[1:41:14] lord these modern events around us
[1:41:17] are made clear by prophecy
[1:41:20] they're made clear that malachi 4 5 had
[1:41:24] to come
[1:41:25] it's made clear that the church world
[1:41:27] had to reject the word
[1:41:30] father it was made clear that the seed
[1:41:32] had to go into the ground that first
[1:41:34] great church
[1:41:36] and come up again
[1:41:38] it's made clear father every aspect of
[1:41:43] america and democracy being lost
[1:41:47] father every prophecy of
[1:41:50] people going in their houses and
[1:41:52] wearing masks in the lady in a purple
[1:41:55] dress it doesn't matter father when we
[1:41:57] view it through the word of god father
[1:42:00] we know
[1:42:02] that everything
[1:42:03] is according to thy word
[1:42:06] and father everything was for
[1:42:09] your word
[1:42:12] and father you declared us that pride
[1:42:14] this is pride time
[1:42:17] this is not another age
[1:42:19] this is seed age this is word age it's
[1:42:23] where the original seed that was in your
[1:42:25] mind
[1:42:26] in the beginning is not coming up
[1:42:29] through organizations or through systems
[1:42:32] or through blessings of days gone by
[1:42:34] it's germinated fresh
[1:42:37] by fresh life
[1:42:39] fresh manna
[1:42:41] father with i sav
[1:42:43] that we can see
[1:42:44] we're grateful for that lord we're
[1:42:46] grateful for your plan

[1:42:54] father because it stands so clear by
[1:42:57] itself
[1:42:58] to the elect
[1:43:00] father the condition was so the elect
[1:43:03] could be called out
[1:43:05] the condition was so the seed could be
[1:43:07] germinated
[1:43:09] the condition father is perfect we're in
[1:43:12] a new age
[1:43:13] a new time a new life
