[music] Just that little bit of faith that we've had in our life and [music] what God can do with it and multiply it.

And we also want to remember uh brother Billy as he is traveling and also brother Andrew as he'll be traveling back from Colorado. And we're just looking forward to what [music] the Lord would have for each of us. Why don't we go before the Lord? Heavenly Father, [music] we're thankful that we'd be able to come here. We could be many other places drawn to many other things [music] Lord but something is drawing us calling us Lord and it's you [music] Lord we want to thank you for the call of God that you've placed in our life Lord that we would come here not to be seen of man Lord but to hear from our creator [music] the one who formed this earth and created the heavens. We know that you're present right here with us by divine promise. [music] And Lord, you ordained to use a vessel that you would speak through. [music] And that word would bring forth a faith that would make the word become a living reality in the believer's life. And Lord, we pray that we'll just take one more step towards that body change and the catching away. We love you, Lord. We thank you for [music] each one that's come, our visitors that have been able to come. Lord, I pray a special blessing for them. We're just looking to you now and ask that you come and break the bread of life as only you can. We just ask it in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, um I want to be reading out of um Acts chapter 2 and also Ephesians 2:8. So maybe we'll read Ephesians 2:8 uh first and we'll just see how uh we'll progress through this little thought we had in our mind. we on our heart we just um see how the Lord would bring this out. Um you can just keep it there on the opening slide. They're identified by the pillar of fire slide one. That's where we want to just stay there and reading out of Ephesians uh 2 and 8. I just want to read this here as uh if we have the time to get um towards a little further in this thought. Um, but Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." Amen. You may be seated. I I always love the word and encouraged by the word, especially when you read things that eliminate your humanity as a part of the as a part of the process. you know, I mean, uh, I don't know any of you, uh, but, uh, if you've ever received a gift, um, you know, it's something that's given to you and and of course your kids, a lot of times they ask for certain things, but you know, when somebody just comes up and says, "Here, I want to give this to you." They're not requiring um, maybe anything back. Of course, we as humans many time we we're we're maybe a little selfish in giving because we want to get back. But, you know, the the Lord freely gave, he laid down his life for us. And and I love that scripture, Ephesians 2:8. It it's a gift and we there ain't no works. There's nothing that we can do. There's nothing that we can boast about it. And it's by faith. And just I want to um just read in Acts chapter 2. Um also just to this will be tie together with a quote for our um thought here in Acts chapter 2 verse 1 through 4. And if you have your Bibles, feel free to um try to follow along. We'll be putting up some scriptures and quotes and just see how the Lord progress. I'm I'm wanting to be short. We've had a long day, especially uh with the Sunday school kids and and those that have been helping. We thank so much and um you know, just as things continue to open up, it seems like it keeps getting uh bigger and bigger, but we'll try to move quickly and by God's grace find a place to close. Acts 2 1-4 says, "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all in one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." Now, I just want to read this quote. Um, I just maybe I find out how do I advance it on here? You want to somebody Do I hit enter? Do I hit uh forward backwards? Let's see here. I I don't know. I'd like to get that set up in the beginning uh to see if I can advance this um to see if it'll work. I want to move to a quote out of questions and answers. Um and that's uh really be the source of my inspiration. If we're not able to advance it, I can just have them. Um, now what am I hitting to advance it? &gt;&gt; Okay, then. Thank you very much. All right. My brother David always to the rescue. All right. Questions and answers. Brother Brandham says this. Now on the day of pen, now on the day of Pentecost, it come down the pillar of fire and broke apart like that. And tongues of fire sat upon each of them. Not their tongues, but tongues of fire set upon each of them. an elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that God had separated himself into man. Do you get it? God the logos separated himself into man. God not in one person. He's in his church universal. That's the reason Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also more. Now I I know the King James says greater but but the right translation there is more than this shall you do. God was bottled and confined in one man, Jesus Christ, but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living God. And that's what I just want to maybe minister to you on this evening. Uh by the help of God is identified by the pillar of fire. And and if we can just move into a thought here, we'll also maybe mention the characteristics of a believer. But just what's on our heart is is ministering to you on identified by the pillar of fire. And notice he said tongues of fire set upon each of them an elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that God had separated himself into man. So it was the same life. It was the same works. It was the same actions. It was the same ministry of Jesus Christ. But now it was tabernacle in itself in a many membered body. Amen. you believe that? So, it was the same life, same ministry, and we know that Christ and the bride is becoming one. And brother Brandham said why? It's the most beautiful thing you could ever see. And and in this questions and answers, uh they're asking brother Brandham the question. They're saying I is if if the son of man and the pillar of fire are the same thing. And and what a really good question. And brother Brandham just says, "Was the pillar of fire the son of man?" No. The pillar of fire is the anointing. And so we KNOW THE PROPHET HAS TAUGHT US CHRIST is the anointing. He said in in I believe it's in um a paradox he says Christ is the anointing. The spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live. So what is going to make that word live? It's going to be the anointing that comes upon the word and quickens that word and makes it a living reality. Uh it's and what was it? It's the very logos. It's the very logos that the fullness of God that was in Christ Jesus. And on the day of Pentecost, what did he do? He broke that apart and you saw tongues and licks of fire settling down upon man. And now a portion of that logos was in a many membered bride body. And we believe and know that the word of God has been swed into us. Brother Brandon would even make a mention about the disciples that the word was swed into them. And then as they were gathered together on the day of Pentecost, Christ came upon that seed word and anointed that word bringing it to a reality or in a manifestation. And and I and I pray that that word is in your heart. And and I believe you know there's many things are a paradox, but God put a predestinated seed on the inside of you. And and it's when that word comes and strikes that seed and faith comes by hearing that word and you believe it, then the spirit of God comes and waters that seed. It be begins to grow into the fullness of the very thought that God had of you in his mind from the very beginning. And I love that because there's nothing that can stop that. &gt;&gt; Now, just just kind of want to just lay a foundation here uh in questions and answers. Brother Brandon would say this. He uh continuing on he says now that pillar of fire is the logos that went out of God. The logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God. When God become into a form to where it could be seen. It was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth. It's condescending coming down. God the father the logos that was up over Israel. He was holy. He could not bear sin. a and and just oh, YOU COULD YOU COULD GET OUT THERE AND START THINKING ABOUT the unveiling of God and God CONDESCENDING AND AND GOD AND morphe and and we could start to get into ALL THOSE THOUGHT THOUGHTS. And I encourage you to study the message of the hour and to look at how brother Brandham brings many of those things out. But I I just want to uh uh uh show this here in Exodus 13 and 21. It says, "And the Lord went before them by day, a a pillar of cloud to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night." He took not away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people. And so you you're starting to, BROTHER GRANT HAVE SHOWN THIS LOGOS, THIS THIS THAT THAT GOD HAD FORMED HIMSELF INTO. You know, you could never even begin TO TO GRASP GOD OR EVEN THE CONCEPT OF THE LOGOS is such a paradox. But yet HE SHOWS HOW GOD IN MORPHE, GOD JUST FORMING HIMSELF now into the logos, maybe this this great burning LIGHT OR THIS GREAT FIRE. AND NOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY PICK IT UP in scripture and actually see where this great fil FIRE OR THIS PILLAR OF FIRE or this logos is actually according to scripture, IT'S A PILLAR OF CLOUD BY DAY to them to lead them in the way and it's a pillar of fire by night. and and and that might not mean a lot to a LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT I I THINK IT'S PROFOUND TO ME to think that the same PILLAR OF CLOUD THAT WAS LEADING the children of Israel, we understand that that there would be a season and a time that it would lead the children OF ISRAEL THROUGH THE WILDERNESS AND THEN HE WOULD BUILD A TABERNACLE OF BADGER SKINS AND THEN THAT THAT PILLAR OF CLOUD AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE WOULD COME AND IT WOULD TABERNACLE ITSELF INTO A TENT AND AND YOU WOULD NO MORE MAYBE SEE IT OUT THERE, BUT YOU WOULD KNOW BEHIND IN THE SHAKINA OF GLORY BY PROMISE THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, THAT LOGOS IN THE HOLIEST OF HOLIES. IT WAS THERE. And then as you would follow through the scripture, you would see it. IT WOULD COME BACK. WHAT YOU would see the Holy Spirit descending AS A A DOVE UPON OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. AND THEN YOU READ INTO in into ACTS AND THAT LOGOS, that pillar of fire. NOW IT'S BREAKING APART LIKE CLOVEN TONGUES UPON THE DISCIPLES. AND THEN IF YOU FOLLOW LATER IN the scripture, what do you see? YOU SEE IT STRIKING DOWN PAUL. A AND AND I SAY A AFTER 2,000 YEARS TO THINK we are a privileged PEOPLE THAT WE CAN SEE A picture of that pillar of cloud that was LEADING THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. And to think THAT THAT PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS THERE AT NIGHT IS THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT HAD ITS PICTURE TAKEN ABOVE MALACHI 4:5 WHICH THE MINISTRY OF WILLIAM BRANDON WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF MALACHI 4:5, LUKE 17:30, REVELATIONS 10:7. WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS THE mighty angel coming down and in TABERNACLING UH UH TAKING CONTROL OF A VESSEL AND IT WOULD BE THE VERY WORD OF GOD TO YOU TO SHOW YOU where we're living, where you COME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT WAS THE VERY MIND OF GOD BEING REVEALED TO US. AND TO THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN A PICTURE OF THAT LOGOS IN THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, I THINK IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL THING TO look at that. and and and AS WE JUST PROGRESS HERE UH IN OUR SLIDE JUST IN EXODUS 14:24 IT WOULD SAY AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT IN THE MORNING NOW WE'RE just looking at a few scriptures here as God would lead the children of Israel [snorts] hey I'm going to take advantage of that handy hook somewhere uh God would lead the children of Israel and and and and the pillar of fire was with them AND WE'RE JUST BACKING UP A little in the STORY IT SAYS IN EXODUS 13:21 says and the Lord went before them we read that now we're in Exodus 14 And it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians. And I was just thinking about that. YOU JUST THINK OF THE very story of the children of Israel. It is amazing to me that they could even begin to murmur and complain. the fact that GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THEIR BONDAGE and being WHIPPED BY BY TASK MASTERS AND BEATEN and their children being taken FROM THEM AND THEIR WIVES AND BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND AND OH NO NO NO TELLING HOW REALLY CRUEL AND HOW BAD IT REALLY WAS AND THEN GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT BY A MIGHTY HAND AND AND HERE YOU ACTUALLY SEE IN THE STORY THAT THAT THEY THEY'VE COME INTO A PLACE AND ACTUALLY THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS STANDING before the children OF ISRAEL AND IT'S STANDING before the enemy and I I love HOW THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ISN'T IT? IT WHAT DID IT SAY? And it troubled the host of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; It troubled the enemy. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS JUDGMENT TO THE ENEMY. IT WAS TROUBLE TO THE ENEMY. BUT WASN'T WAS IT? IT WAS PROTECTION AND DELIVERANCE TO THE BELIEVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND TO THINK THAT THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE HAS COME BACK IN OUR GENERATION, I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT WILL TROUBLE THE ENEMY. IT WILL BE JUDGMENT TO THE WILD. BUT TO THE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN, OH, I'M SO THANKFUL THAT IT'S DELIVERANCE, IT'S FREEDOM, it's protection. It says here in our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world. I want to say without the pillar of fire without the logos WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST WITHOUT THE TOKEN YOU ARE IN TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE AS THOSE EGYPTIANS. YOU ARE OF A A WORLD THAT IS DYING AND GROPING in darkness. And without that logos, WITHOUT THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, I TELL YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO BE TROUBLED AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED. BUT WHY CAN WE HAVE boldness in the DAY OF JUDGMENT? BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE. WE ARE BEING LED BY A pillar of fire. THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT was leading THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. COME ON, HELP ME OUT NOW. THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS LEADING THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. THE SAME LOGOS THAT WAS THE ANOINTING THAT COME UPON THEM AT THE DAY OF PENTECOST HAS RETURNED BY DIVINE PROMISE IN THE LADYAN AGE. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S JUDGMENT TO THE WORLD. BUT WHAT IS IT? IT'S DELIVERANCE. It's safety. It's salvation. It's everything that we have need of. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, just moving on, I WANT TO JUST MAYBE LAY SOMETHING IN THERE IN MATTHEW 7 and22. It says, "Many will say to ME IN THAT DAY, LORD, LORD, HAVE NOT WE PROPHESIED IN THY NAME? And in thy name HAVE GOT CAST OUT DEVILS AND IN THY NAME DONE many wonderful works? And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, YE THAT WORK INIQUITY. AIN'T THAT amazing to THINK THAT THERE'S A CLASS OF PEOPLE AND A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE RELIGIOUS. THEY WILL HAVE SIGNS and they they'll have wonders. THEY'LL FEED THE POOR AND AND THEY'LL have soup kitchens AND SOUP SUPPERS AND ALL THESE THINGS AND THEY'LL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO UH UH TALK ABOUT ALL THESE THESE WONDERFUL WORKS AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT THEY DONE. BUT HERE IN THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "DEPART FROM ME YE WORKERS OF INIQUITY." WHAT IS INIQUITY? IT'S KNOWING WHAT IS RIGHT BUT DENYING TO DO IT. AND I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING THING IN THE DAY AND AGE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN THAT GOD WOULD COME BY DIVINE PROMISE A AND THROUGH A PROPHETIC MINISTRY AND DISCERN THE THOUGHTS AND INTENTS OF THE HEART. BLIND EYES BE OPEN, THE DEAD BE RAISED UP UH UH COUNTLESS UPON. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE THE UNFATHOMABLE MIRACLES THAT GOD WROUGHT THROUGH THE PROPHET'S MINISTRY. I I TELL YOU WHAT, I DON'T THINK THE SCROLLS, THE BOOKS COULDN'T CONTAIN IT. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE HALF. WE DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF THE PROPHET'S LIFE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE interacted with AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HEALED AND AND THE THOUGHTS AND INTENTS OF THE HEARTS THAT WERE DISCERNED. AND IT WAS ON DISPLAY AROUND THE WORLD SEVEN TIMES. AND TO THINK THAT THAT VERY WORD COULD BE MADE FLESH BEFORE A PEOPLE THAT WERE BELIEVING FOR THE Messiah &gt;&gt; and they WOULD REJECT IT. &gt;&gt; THE PRESENCE OF GOD UNRECOGNIZED. BUT yet he could show THEM IN THE SCRIPTURES SAYS IT'S NOT LAWFUL. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO DO THIS AND SHOW THE HOW WE SHOULD DRESS AND HOW WE SHOULD CONDUCT OURSELVES. BUT WHAT WOULD THEY DO? THEY WOULD REJECT THE word &gt;&gt; and the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; And therefore you have a scripture like THIS THAT SAYS, "DEPART FROM ME YE THAT WORK iniquity for I never knew you." WE KNOW THAT JESUS TAUGHT US IT JUST BEFORE THAT. HE SAYS, "IT'S BY THEIR FRUITS YOU SHALL know them." I like that. HE SAID FRUITS. PRAISE GOD. HE DIDN'T SAY WORKS CUZ I'D BE ONE CONFUSED PUPPY. IF HE SAID BY YOUR WORKS YOU WILL KNOW THEM. WELL THEN I BETTER START PLAYING CATCHUP BECAUSE THE PENTECOSTALS WILL OUTSHINE YOU. I TELL YOU THERE'S BAPTISTS THAT'LL OUTSHINE YOU. YOUR NEIGHBOR WILL OUTSHINE YOU. BUT I'M SO THANKFUL IT'S NOT BASED ON MY WORDS. BUT HE SAID YOU SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUIT. WHAT? THE FRUIT OF THE WORD. The fruit of the LIFE OF CHRIST ON DISPLAY in an individual's life. Amen. IT'S &gt;&gt; NOT OF WORKS LEST WE SHOULD BOAST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, just laying that in for a foundation. And and then uh uh we we we JUST BEEN GETTING A LOT OF INSPIRATION AS WE CAME OUT OF QUESTION AND answers been BEEN LISTENING TO GOD IDENTIFYING HIMSELF BY HIS CHARACTERISTICS. AND BROTHER BENAM in this message, HE WOULD START TO SHOW HOW YOU KNOW CERTAIN ANIMALS THEY HAVE certain characteristics. you you might IF YOU'RE GOING OUT HUNTING AND HE WOULD USE HUNTING AND SHOW THAT HOW THERE'S CERTAIN rams and and certain uh uh ones that maybe there's certain distinguishing marks and features that THAT YOU CAN TELL them one from another just like you would UH MAYBE BIRDS IF IF you're looking out and I mean I don't know but it's pretty simple usually to that's a cardinal. Why is that a cardinal? Because the CHARACTERISTIC OF A CARDINAL it's red and and that's a blue jay. THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE THEY CAN JUST HEAR THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. LIKE, OH, THAT'S THAT BIRD. AND WHY? IT'S THE CHARACTERISTIC. IT'S SOMETHING THAT identifies the nature or the character of what that is. &gt;&gt; Now, in this message, I I think there's just A WE WON'T HAVE TIME MAYBE JUST TO mention it, but brother Brandham, IN THIS MESSAGE, HE TALKS ABOUT HOW UH THINGS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND AND THERE'S A PLACE WHERE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL NOW they're they're coming through the wilderness and they come to the land of Moab. And it's AN AMAZING THING THAT THEY COME TO THE LAND OF of Moab. And here's a here's a THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, GOD'S ELECTED CHOSEN, AND HE'S COMING TO TO TO the Moabites. And here are these Moabites. THEY'RE JUST AS FUNDAMENTAL AS ISRAEL IS. They they have their prophets. They have their altars. Uh they they have their religion. They have their big churches. They go to CHURCH ON SUNDAY. EVERYTHING that they have I it if you were TO LOOK AT IT FUNDAMENTALLY THEY WERE JUST AS CHRISTIAN SO TO SPEAK AS ISRAEL was &gt;&gt; right they come to him and and I think it's AN AMAZING THING WHEN YOU LOOK INTO the scripture AND THEN UH THEY'RE WANTING TO PASS THROUGH BUT WHAT DO THEY WANT THEY DON'T WANT TO LET THEM PASS THROUGH AND THEY'RE TELLING WHAT DOES BALAM WANT TO DO HE WANTS TO CURSE THE HE WANTS TO CURSE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND HE KEEPS SEEKING AFTER GOD HE WANTS TO CURSE THEM AND AND WE'RE TAUGHT THAT THAT THAT THEY HAD THEIR PROPHET THEY HAD HAD THEIR ALTARS, THEY HAD THEIR CHURCH, THEY HAD EVERYTHING. BUT THE ONE THING that they lacked, THEY LACKED THE PILLAR of fire AND A VINDICATED PROPHET OF THE AGE AMONG THEM. SO IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND IT WAS. IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT THEY COULD SAY THE LORD'S PRAYER. DIDN'T MATTER IF THEY WENT TO CHURCH AND HOW MANY ALTARS THAT THEY LAID AND HOW MANY SACRIFICE. THE ONE THING THAT THEY LACKED WAS RECOGNIZING THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND THE VINDICATED PROPHET WAS AMONGST THEM. All right. &gt;&gt; This thing's going to pop off my head eventually. &gt;&gt; So, just laying laying that IN THERE TO THINK WHAT WAS IT THAT THEY LACKED. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They could HAVE POINT TO THE THE HINDER PART. THEY COULD HAVE POINTED TO THE MISTAKES AND OH, LOOK AT THE CHILDREN. They did THIS AND THEY DID THAT. BUT ONE THING THEY DIDN'T have is they didn't have that pillar of fire. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE LOGOS WHICH WAS WHAT THE ATTRIBUTE of the fullness OF THE WORD TO THINK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD THE attribute &gt;&gt; the fullness of the WORD WAS PRESENT WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BENAMAN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF BY HIS CHARACTERISTICS would say in chapter and in in uh uh paragraph 51. But you see Moses BEING THE CORRECT PROPHET OF GOD NOT ONLY HAD THE fundamental part but he had the identification of God. &gt;&gt; See he was in the line of duty. Exactly what was promised for that age. Not for the age of Noah but for the age then. I will take you to a land that's flowing with milk and honey. They were on their way. AND ISRAEL WAS IDENTIFIED WITH their prophet Moses with the message of that age. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I KNOW I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL GO SAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE UH MY GOOD FRIEND, BROTHER JOSH BENNETT, ONE TIME HE WAS IN A DISCUSSION WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL AND HE TOLD HIM, HE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID?" AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHY WHY CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE HIM OUT OF IT? YOU KNOW, WE WE you know, WE WE BELIEVE THE GOSPEL. WE BELIEVE IN CALVARY AND AND WE'RE ALL CHRISTIANS. WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GOT TO POINT? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GOT TO SAY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID? AND AND YOU KNOW MY BROTHER BROTHER HE SAID HE JUST GOT TO THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND AND THOUGHT HE GOES YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IF YOU CAN TELL THE STORY OF THE ARK AND not mention Noah. IF YOU CAN TELL THE STORY ABOUT ISRAEL GOING IN AN EXODUS AND NOT MENTION MOSES. IF YOU CAN TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND LEAVE OUT JOHN THE BAPTIST. WELL THEN MAYBE I CAN'T SAY BROTHER B. BUT IF YOU GOT TO SAY NO TO TELL THAT STORY, IF YOU GOT TO SAY MOSES TO TELL THAT STORY, IF YOU GOT TO SAY JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT INTRODUCED THE MESSIAH, THEN WHAT ABOUT IN OUR DAY? WE GOT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE. And I'm NOT ASHAMED TO SAY THAT GOD HAS SENT US A MESSAGE THROUGH A VINDICATED PROPHET AND HIS NAME IS WILLIAM MARY AND BRANDON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's true. That might sting, &gt;&gt; but I'm going in an Exodus. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE SOME FRIENDS, BUT I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; HEY, I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WELL, there's a reason I don't wear this thing. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll grab a handheld. [crying] &gt;&gt; I like that what he's saying right there. They were on their way and Israel WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THEIR PROPHET Moses &gt;&gt; with the message of the age. God's characteristics identified in Moses. &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE WAS FOLLOWING THEM. HE ALSO HAD THE ATONEMENT IN ACTION. NOT SPEAKING OF IT, BUT HAD it in action. Not what will be, what is right now. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAD THE pillar of fire. They had the identification, &gt;&gt; the attributes, the characteristics of the word of the age that they were LIVING IN. COME ON. THEY HAD DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They had mana from heaven. &gt;&gt; They had A BRAZEN SERPENT. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD A SMITTEN ROCK. THEY HAD LIVING WATERS. BECAUSE WHY? THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD WAS PRESENT WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT US CHILDREN OF GOD? WE HAVE BY REVELATION REALIZED THAT GOD HAS RETURNED THE FULLNESS OF THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE LOGOS BY DIVINE PROMISE HAS COME BACK IN THIS AGE AND HE HAS MADE YOU A PARTAKER. &gt;&gt; OH, praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm done wrestling with that thing. Can you hear me now? &gt;&gt; Well, I feel back at home. Y'all better watch out. &gt;&gt; All right. Just trying to move on right here. Uh, see where we're at. [crying] &gt;&gt; But it was that pillar of fire. What was IT DOING? IT WAS SHOWING THAT GOD WAS IN THE CAMP. &gt;&gt; God was present with his people. But those THAT WERE COMING IN CONTACT, WHAT DID THEY FAILED TO SEE THE pillar of fire? THEY FAILED TO SEE THE SMITTEN ROCK. THEY FAILED TO SEE THE FULLNESS OF GOD. THEY FAILED TO SEE THE LOGOS. AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD GO ON TO SAY THIS. HE WOULD SAY, "THEN THEY WERE TRAVELING IN THE LINE OF PROMISE." THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO be doing, church. WE NEED TO BE TRAVELING IN THE LINE OF PROMISE. WE ARE GOING IN AN EXODUS. WE ARE GOING IN A RAPTURE. AND THAT WAS THE OTHER IDENTIFICATION TO SHOWING GOD'S CHARACTERISTICS. NO MATTER HOW FUNDAMENTAL THIS OTHER ONE WAS WITH THE WORD, HE HAD THE FUNDAMENTALISM PLUS THE identification and THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD AMONG THEM. GOD IDENTIFIED himself two prophets, both of them prophets AND BOTH OF THEM FUNDAMENTAL. BUT GOD IDENTIFIED HIS CHARACTERISTICS IN MOSES BECAUSE HE HAD THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam goes ON TO SAY, GOD'S CHARACTERISTICS are supernatural because God is supernatural. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, I I there's there's people all over the world. They they GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY AND THEY SAY THEY'RE CHRISTIANS, but they don't live any different. &gt;&gt; They drink, they smoke, BUT YOU SEE THEY THERE there's no atonement IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FUNDAMENTAL. GO. I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST. HE'S THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD. I GO TO CHURCH. I PAY MY TITHE. I I TAKE COMMUNION. I'M A CHRISTIAN. I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I I I HAVE A GOOD LIFE. BUT YOU SEE, GOD IS A GOD OF THE SUPERNATURAL. WHERE IS THE TESTIMONY? WHERE IS THE DELIVERANCE? WHERE IS THE HEALING? WHERE IS THE TESTIMONY? WHERE IS THE CHANGE IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE? WHERE THEY CAN POINT TO THE SCRIPTURE AND SAY, "I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND. I ONCE WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I'M SEE. I AM A NEW CREATURE IN JESUS CHRIST. OLD THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY, AND ALL [screaming] THINGS HAVE BECOME NEW." Brother Rand said it's always it's unusual always to the modern trend of thinking of the day. These great MEGA CHURCHES AND AND ALL OF THESE BIG GROUPS OUT THERE AND AND AND NO DOUBT, YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO I LIKE TO SAY IT TO UH BROTHER JASON WATKINS WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS. HE SAYS THEY'LL GET A FAIR TRIAL. &gt;&gt; They will. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY WILL GET A FAIR TRIAL. BUT THIS IS ONE GUY THAT CANNOT COUNT ON A TRIAL. THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; I WILL [screaming] NOT MAKE IT THROUGH WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T BE GOOD TO ENOUGH PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; There's only one way that I know THAT I CAN BE SAVED. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I'm saved." Saved from what? &gt;&gt; What are YOU SAVED FROM? WELL, I'M SAVED FROM MY SINS. IF YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT, YOU ARE NOT SAVED FROM YOUR SINS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY AN unrighteous man COULD STAND IN THE PRESENCE OF God and be ABLE TO POINT TO ANY OF YOUR GOOD WORKS AS A MERIT FOR SALVATION. NO, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAID. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE MAKE IT. AND HE SAID, "BY FAITH." ARE YOU SAVED BY GRACE? ARE YOU SAVED THROUGH faith &gt;&gt; and not of yourself? IT IS A GIFT FROM GOD. THE ONLY WAY THAT MATTHEW MCGARY IS GOING TO MAKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS A GIFT FROM ALMIGHTY GOD. BUT THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT A GIFT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO? YOU GOT TO ACCEPT IT. YOU GOT TO TAKE IT. YOU GOT TO RECEIVE IT. YOU GOT TO OPEN UP. AND SURE, HE SAID, "FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE. BUT MANY WILL SAY ON THAT DAY, OH, I was a Christian. I did this. &gt;&gt; Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity. I never knew you. &gt;&gt; See, YOU CAN DRAW IT DOWN where we want to look at where we're being IN THE LINE OF DUTY. And the only way we're going to be able to navigate AND GET OUR WAY OUT OF HERE IS IF WE HAVE A GUIDE. &gt;&gt; And God sent A GUIDE BY DIVINE PROMISE. THERE WAS NO WAY THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE GETTING OUT OF EGYPT WITHOUT A GUIDE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GETTING OUT OF LADY OSIA WITHOUT A GUIDE. AND JUST AS GOD SENT NOAH, JUST AS GOD SENT MOSES, GOD HAS SENT A PROPHET TO LEAD HIS CHILDREN IN AN EXODUS TO A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So you just you SEE THIS PILLAR OF FIRE THAT WAS WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND THAT SAME PILLAR OF FIRE NOW THE LOGOS WAS MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US. WE KNOW THE SCRIPTURE IN IN JOHN 1:1 IT SAYS IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD and the word was &gt;&gt; God. And and notice uh if if you didn't notice, BROTHER BRANDON WILL ALWAYS TIE JOHN 1:1 WITH JOHN 1:14. That's good. &gt;&gt; He he reads it consecutively AND HE GOES RIGHT INTO AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH AND DWELT among us. &gt;&gt; SO NOW WHERE IS THIS PILLAR OF FIRE? WHERE IS THIS LOGOS? &gt;&gt; THIS THIS THIS CLOUD THIS THIS PILLAR OF FIRE THIS ONE THAT LED HIM IN the in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Now where is it? What was it? That logos was the attribute of the fullness of God. And now it's in one man, Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Man was made &gt;&gt; in the image of God. &gt;&gt; And God was made in the image of man. As Paul would say in Colossians 1:15, who is the image of the invisible God? &gt;&gt; Now, just jumping to back to questions and answers here. Speaking of that, Brother Brandham says, "Heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other. &gt;&gt; God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship &gt;&gt; when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us." Jesus said, "I am come from God and I go to God." Is that right? After his death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, WHEN THE BODY WAS TAKEN UP TO SIT at the right hand of God, NOW I DON'T MEAN GOD'S GOT A RIGHT HAND. God's a spirit. But at the right hand means in power and authority of God. That in that name, everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it. Everything in earth is named after it and subject to it a name above all names Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says in everything you do in word or deed do all in the name of &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That includes water baptism. Amen. &gt;&gt; I created a firestorm over in India &gt;&gt; when I had that meeting with some 200 ministers and they had their testimony AND I JUST FLAT OUT TOOK MY BIBLE OUT AND I SAID, "IF THAT IS YOUR TESTIMONY, IT'S CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD." &gt;&gt; But you know, I say it's TIME WE GET SOME BOLDNESS IN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT BECAUSE THEY ALL LINED UP FOR WATER BAPTISM. I SAY THERE GOTS TO BE A PEOPLE WHO AIN'T AFRAID TO SAY WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS, REGARDLESS OF THE RELIGIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE DENOMINATIONS, REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY'VE STUDIED IN THEIR DLD, PCP AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF THAT THEY'RE ON. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT I CAN SAY I'VE PROVED. I'M ABOUT TO GET ON A TANGENT. JUST LIKE DAVID, HE HE COULDN'T SAUL'S ARMOR WASN'T GOING TO WORK, BUT ONE THING HE KNEW THAT HE WAS ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That stuff's not proven. &gt;&gt; But I say what we got to do is we got to stay with the original artillery. &gt;&gt; Hallelu. I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD. WE GOT TO STAY WITH THE ORIGINAL ARTILLERY. WHAT DID BROTHER BRAD SAY? HE SAID, "LET'S DO THE JOB RIGHT." &gt;&gt; WHY GET OUT A 22, RIGHT? LET'S GET OUT FAITH, THE REAL THE REAL BOMB, THE REAL ARTILLERY. FAITH IN GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; So just uh UH PROGRESSING IN THIS THOUGHT HERE IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. AND AND JUST SHOWING THIS HE says find my place quickly. He says NOW THIS LOGOS WAS IN HIM WHICH WAS THE SPIRIT of God. The anointing through the sanctifying grace OF THE BLOOD BROUGHT MANY SONS TO GOD WHICH anointed which is anointed with this same &gt;&gt; logos. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me. Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, we're talking about identification. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the characteristics of a believer. It's one thing to say it. It's another thing to demonstrate it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Are we we doing okay? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, just looking at this, LOOK AT WHAT PAUL SAYS HERE IN Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 9. And he says, "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR, THAT HE BY THE GRACE OF GOD should taste death for every man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by him who are all things, in bringing many sons under glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering." I'm so thankful that he is the captain of my salvation. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he's the captain OF MY SHIP. I'M SO THANKFUL he's the captain OF MY PREDESTINATION. SEE, THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF US WANT TO BE THE CAPTAIN OR WE WANT TO BE CO- CAPTAIN. &gt;&gt; GOD GOD BRINGS YOU THIS FLIGHT. YOU SAY, "OKAY, I GOT IT PRETTY GOOD, LORD. I THINK I CAN TAKE OVER. LET ME JUST TAKE OVER THE HELM NOW." &gt;&gt; SO MANY TIMES WE DO THAT, BUT HE IS THE CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. WE'LL JUST TRY TO TO PLUM THE LINE HERE. IN HEBREWS 10:5, HE SAYS, "WHEREFORE, WHEN HE COMETH INTO THE WORLD, HE SAID, "SACRIFICE AND OFFERINGS THOU WOULDEST NOT, BUT A BODY HAST THOU PREPARED ME." &gt;&gt; What was it? HE HE WASN'T WANTING TO DWELL IN IN TENTS MADE WITH HANDS. HE WASN'T WANTING TO BE THE THE THE LOGOS IN THE PILLAR OF FIREH BY NIGHT AND THE CLOUD BY DAY AND THEN COME IN AND AND LIVE IN THIS THIS MAKESHIFT TENT THAT WENT ALL OVER THE WILDERNESS. EVEN WHEN WHEN THE TEMPLE WAS BUILT, IT WASN'T THAT GOD WAS WANTING TO DWELL THERE, BUT GOD'S WANTING TO DWELL IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in perseverance. HE SAYS, "NOW GOD PREPARED HIMSELF A BODY IN THE FORM OF THE LORD JESUS, WHICH was the Christ, meaning the anointed one. And now all that GOD WAS WAS IN CHRIST. HE WAS THE FULLNESS of the Godhead bodily." That's what the scripture says. Now, AND ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED OUT INTO CHRIST. He was Emmanuel, God with us. And all and ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, HE POURED OUT INTO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly. &gt;&gt; He lived by the word of the father. Man shall not live BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT proceedth from THE MOUTH OF GOD. AND THE CHURCH DON'T LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY THE WORD of Christ. And the Holy Spirit comes in and takes the word of Christ and makes it a living action today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I JUST IF I COULD SAY WHAT'S ON MY HEART, THE HOLY GHOST, THE ANOINTING, THAT LOGOS THAT WAS DIVIDED UPON THE CHILDREN UPON THE DISCIPLES THAT WERE GATHERED THERE IN THE UPPER ROOM. WHAT DOES IT DO? IT TAKES THE WORD OF GOD. IT TAKES THE BIBLE. IT TAKES ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE HEAR AND IT makes the word a living action. LOOK, DON'T COME AND TELL ME THAT YOU GOT THE SOLUTION TO ALL MY PROBLEMS AND SIT WITH ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT I GOT. &gt;&gt; You You're COMING OVER JUST AS SICK AS I AM AND SAY, "I GOT JESUS. LOOK, I NEED SOMETHING REAL. I NEED A REAL GOD." IT REMINDS ME OF THAT STORY HOW THAT THAT LITTLE BOY, HE WAS UPSTAIRS AND AND YOU KNOW, THE THE LIGHTNING WAS FLASHING AND IT WAS ALL CRASHING AROUND. HE STARTED CRYING, "MAMA, MAMA, MAMA, UH, COME HERE." AND SHE COME UP THE STAIRS AND BEING THE GOOD MOTHER THAT SHE WAS AND SHE COME IN HER ROOM. SHE SAYS, "WHAT IS IT, LITTLE SUNNY? WHAT WHAT DO YOU NEED?" HE SAYS, "I'M SCARED." HE SHE SAID, "NOW DON'T WORRY." SAID, "YOU KNOW JESUS LOVES YOU." YEAH. SHE SAID, "MOMMY, DON'T DON'T LEAVE ME, MOMMY." SHE GOES, "YOU KNOW JESUS IS WITH YOU." HE SAID, "I'LL BE WITH YOU. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU." HE SAID, "YES, MOMMY, THAT'S GOOD." HE SAID, "BUT I WANT A GOD WITH SKIN ON IT." &gt;&gt; LOOK, it's one thing to do A LOT OF TALKING, BUT I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'S REAL. I WANT TO SEE THAT GOD THAT CHANGES LIVES. I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'LL DELIVER THE ALCOHOLIC. I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'LL DELIVER THE DRUG ADDICT. I WANT TO SEE A GOD THAT'LL PULL SOMEBODY OUT OF THE DENOMINATIONAL REALMS OF DEATH AND RESTORE THEIR SOUL AND SET THEM FREE AND REVEAL THE LIVING WORD OF THE HOUR TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND THEN THAT WORD TAKE ON FLESH. [screaming] I HAVE NOT LOST MY MIND. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A living action. CHRIST THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WORD NOW LIVING IN A people in his bride. NOT JUST ON SUNDAY, not just on Wednesday, &gt;&gt; Monday, &gt;&gt; Tuesday, at your job, at your school, &gt;&gt; NOT &gt;&gt; IN YOUR HOME, IN YOUR CAR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DISPLAYING THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT, HAVING THAT LOVE, THAT HUMILITY, THAT MEEKNESS, THAT PATIENCE, THAT LONGSUFFERING, GENTLENESS. I guess we don't like that. Okay, we're all brother Matthew, don't get on the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? &gt;&gt; WE JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE CAN KNOW AND GO AROUND AROUND THE CITY AND TOOT OUR HORN AND SAY, "WE'RE we're going in the rapture and everybody else is going to hell. H, GOOD LUCK." THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME to do. &gt;&gt; This message came in meekness and humility AND BROKENNESS AND sacrifice &gt;&gt; a LIFE POURED OUT [screaming] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU AND I COULD BE A beneficiary &gt;&gt; of the benefits. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, WE SEE THAT JUST AS CHRIST, HE WAS THE ANOINTED ONE, &gt;&gt; we are the anointed ones. &gt;&gt; Help me out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever Is that Have y'all not heard that before? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We are the anointed ones. HE WAS THE ANOINTED ONE. &gt;&gt; He was the Messiah. We are &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; What is it? IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT COMING IN INTO YOUR LIFE, taking that word now and make it a living action. &gt;&gt; Now, we'll just see how we can move towards a close. But as we talk ABOUT A LIVING ACTION, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS. &gt;&gt; You look into THE BOOK OF ACTS and that's WHERE WE GOT OUR TEXT in Acts 24. It said they WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. And our PROPHET SHOWS US HOW THIS IS OFTEN CALLED UH THE THE THE THE BOOK OF ACTS of the apostles, BUT IT WAS NOT THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles. &gt;&gt; Just as we READ THE OPENING QUOTE, HE SAID, "GOD WAS BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN ONE MAN, JESUS CHRIST, BUT NOW HE'S BOTTLED and confined IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD." ISN'T THAT A STRANGE WORD THAT THE PROPHET WOULD USE THE WORD CONFINED? &gt;&gt; God confined. &gt;&gt; HE'S CONFINED TO HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHAT MAN IS GOD'S AGENT?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm glad you asked. Let's look AT SOME SCRIPTURES. LOOKING INTO Acts 8, Philillip, he's coming BY THE WAY. HE'S CAUGHT UP AND HE COMES OVER AND HE SEES A UNIC THAT'S READING THE SCRIPTURE OUT OF ISAIAH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And he says to him, the spirit OF GOD LEADING PHILADELPHIA AND HE SAYS, "DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE READING?" And he SAID, "HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M READING LEST SOME MAN SHOW ME?" SOMETHING IN THE UNIC'S HEART WAS DESIRING UNDERSTANDING FROM THE WORD. BUT BECAUSE GOD HAD SEPARATED HIMSELF INTO MAN, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SENT A MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Here the UNIT IS DESIRING, UNDERSTANDING, AND GOD NOW TAKES HIS BODY, HIS AGENT, AND he sends him to the unit. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL? HERE'S THAT LOGOS. WHAT DOES IT DO? It strikes. This is amazing. &gt;&gt; What is the logos? It's the attribute of what? &gt;&gt; The fullness of God. So there in that picture, AS HARD as it is to understand, the fullness of God is before Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. And what does THE FULLNESS OF GOD TELL PAUL? HEY, there's I'm I'm going to show you a brother BY THE NAME OF ANAS. ANANAS. I'M I'M ALSO DEALING WITH HIM. I'M GOING TO SEND YOU DOWN THERE AND HE WILL PRAY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I thought you were the actery. I thought you were THE FULLNESS OF GOD. I I I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THE ATONEMENT AND EVERYTHING W WAS RIGHT THERE. YES. BUT GOD IS CONFINED TO HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; God is using man. &gt;&gt; Now he's ONLY CONFINED TO HIS BODY BECAUSE HE wants to be he wants to use you. He wants to use each and every single one of you. YOU ARE THE VERY THOUGHT OF GOD THAT WAS EXPRESSED. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING? WERE PLAYING OUT OUR part &gt;&gt; and God wants to use YOUR LIFE. OH, BROTHER MATTHEW, YOU DON'T KNOW. I RUINED MY LIFE. I DID SO MANY BAD THINGS. YOU'RE JUST THE RIGHT ONE THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. GO AHEAD AND LOOK ON DOWN THROUGH THE BIBLE. IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE THAT HAD NO HOPE. IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE WHERE THERE WAS NO WAY. AND GOD LOOKS AT THE IMPOSSIBILITY, SAYS, "THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF SON AND DAUGHTER THAT I'M [screaming] LOOKING FOR. I'M LOOKING FOR ONE THAT CAN'T LOOK AT HIS ABILITY. HE CAN'T LOOK AT HIS ATTENDANCE. HE CAN'T LOOK AT HIS GOOD WORKS. HE CAN'T LOOK AT, WELL, I DID THIS GOOD. I DID THAT. HE WANTS TO FIND THE ONE THAT SAYS, I'VE REALLY MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'VE TRIED SO MANY TIMES, BUT I CAN NEVER MAKE IT RIGHT. BUT OH, GOD, IF YOU'LL JUST HAVE MERCY ON ME. &gt;&gt; GOD TAKES NOBODYIES AND MAKES THEM SOMEBODY. AND I CERTAINLY WAS A NOBODY. BUT I'M SO THANKFUL THAT GOD GOT A HOLD OF MY LIFE. I TRIED TO FIT IN OUT THERE IN THE WORLD, AND I COULDN'T FIT IN AS MUCH AS I TRIED. WHY? BECAUSE I DIDN'T BELONG OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ACTS 10. I LOVE THIS ONE, TOO. HERE'S CORNELIUS, RIGHT? I believe he's of the Oh, I forget the band. He's believe a soldier. Cornelius. He's He's seeking God and and an angel appears to the angel of God appears to him by vision. What What does Cornelius Cornelius? HE'S DESIRING GOD. HE WANTS the Holy Ghost. HE HE HE WANTS MORE OF GOD. HERE'S THE ANGEL OF GOD STANDING BEFORE HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? HEY, uh there's a guy named Peter. Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL OF GOD is here. Won't he just give me the Holy Ghost? Won't he just give me what I have need of? No. because God is confined to his body. &gt;&gt; So, we could jump over there where Peter, you know, he's he's up on the roof sleeping. He's he's having and here he sees the big net and things coming down and things clean and unclean and God tells him, "Eat." Goes up, comes down, eat. YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, I'VE NEVER eaten any unclean thing in ALL MY LIFE." IF YOU understand the Levitical law, uh there were certain uh uh uh uh foods that the the children of Israel couldn't eat, and now the Lord's telling them to eat it. And what a contradiction. &gt;&gt; But what is he showing? HE'S SHOWN HIM THAT THERE'S A CROSSING THERE. THERE THERE IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE JEWS, BUT IT'S FOR THE GENTILE. AND AND AND HE TELLS THEM, "DON'T DON'T CALL THAT WHICH I'VE MADE CLEAN, UNCLEAN." HOW I DON'T CARE HOW UNCLEAN YOU'VE BEEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. GOD CALLS YOU CLEAN. GOD CALLS YOU FORGIVEN. GOD CALLS YOU HIS OWN. GOD CALLS YOU A SON. &gt;&gt; GOD CALLS YOU DELIVERED. GOD CALLS YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; And so what IS IT DOING? GOD'S BRINGING THE BODY TOGETHER NOW. PETER, I BELIEVE FROM JED NOW COMING OVER. AND WHAT IS HE COMING? AND PETER STARTS TO MINISTER the word. And as Peter YET SPAKE THESE WORDS, THE HOLY GHOST fell upon all them that heard the word. &gt;&gt; What was it? Jesus now in his body. &gt;&gt; And these are the characteristics OF THE BODY. THE BOOKS OF BOOK OF ACTS IS THE ACTS OF THE HOLY GHOST in his believing children. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say this. HE SAID AND AND WHAT JESUS BEGAN TO DO IN GALILEE, he continues to do now through his display of the token of THE HOLY SPIRIT BACK UPON THE CHURCH. For it was not the acts of the apostles. IT WAS THE ACTS OF THE HOLY Ghost in the apostles. And that was the token. Look what he said. his display of the token. It's Christ the Holy Ghost displaying the token life in you. &gt;&gt; Who Who's doing the acting? &gt;&gt; Who is doing the acting in your life? Who who is doing the acting? IS IT THE HOLY GHOST OR IS IT HOLY your flesh? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look, &gt;&gt; we Sunday's almost over. And if the Lord carries Monday's coming, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN YOUR SAME CAR WITH YOUR SAME COUNTRY MUSIC. &gt;&gt; You're going to go back TO YOUR SAME JOB WITH THE SAME DIRTY JOKES. &gt;&gt; AND NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO about it? &gt;&gt; YOU HEARD WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THIS MORNING ON THE TAPE. HE SAID, "TODAY, IT'S YOUR CHOICE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You get TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU'LL BE IN 5 YEARS. YOU MIGHT BE IN A BURNING HELL OR YOU MIGHT BE IN GLORY. YOU CAN BE A SINNER OR YOU CAN BE A SAINT. BUT BY HEARING THE WORD BY FAITH, I SAY IT'S TIME TO MAKE A CHOICE. IT'S A GIFT. JUST CHOOSE TO RECEIVE IT. A PARDON IS NOT A PARDON UNLESS IT'S ACCEPTED. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THEN ONCE YOU ACCEPT IT, SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO GET THEIR LIFE CLEANED UP FOR GOD. HE'S KNOCKING on your heart. And you keep saying, "Lord, hold on. My room's dirty. My kitchen's dirty. I'm a mess." And he's out there banging on the door. And you keep waiting. No, Lord. I I'm I'M I'M I I STILL GOT MORE WORK TO DO. You cannot get your living room clean enough for Jesus. &gt;&gt; There ain't enough bleach. &gt;&gt; There ain't enough incense. [applause] &gt;&gt; There ain't enough maids. there there is not enough things that you can DO TO TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR LIFE AND MAKE YOURSELF READY FOR JESUS. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO IS SAY, "LORD, I've made a mess of things. I I've made a mess of a lot of things, Lord Jesus, but you're knocking ON MY HEART. JUST COME ON INSIDE, LORD. I'M BROKEN. I'M A MESS. I I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. I FALL DOWN. I GO THROUGH CYCLES. I QUIT DRINKING. I START DRINKING. I QUIT SMOKING. I START SMOKING. I DO THIS AND I DO THAT. I look AND I LOST. THEN I DON'T AND THEN I DO. LORD, I JUST NEED YOUR HELP. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Why don't you just choose to let them in tonight? &gt;&gt; What is it?" And until that happens, there's that old nature in you. And if you're seeing the characteristics of an old nature when your wife talks back to you, well, if you had the Holy Ghost, you would recognize I'm the headship of this home. Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Well, MAYBE IF YOU HAD THE HOLY GHOST, YOUR WIFE WOULDN'T FEEL THE WAY SHE FEELS. &gt;&gt; Maybe your WIFE IS SUCH A NERVOUS WRECK BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AND WATCHING THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AND WATCHING AND SHE'S ALL NERVOUS AND SHE'S ALL ON EDGE AND SHE DON'T EVEN KNOW WONDER WHY THE HOUSE IS IT FEELS THE WAY IT IS. IT'S CUZ SOME OF YOU MEN ARE DOING THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING AND YOU'RE BLAMING IT ON YOUR WIFE. SHAME ON YOU. THAT'S NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S NOT TO CONDEMN YOU. THAT'S TO SHOW YOU THERE'S HIGHER HEIGHTS. THERE'S DEEPER DEPTHS. THERE'S GREATER DELIVERANCE. THERE'S GREATER SURRENDER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Just quickly moving towards a close. Brother said, "You are THE TEMPLE OF GOD. YOU ARE the temple that God wants to dwell in and express himself through it that all nations might know him." &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word, Lord. Scripture says, "Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me because I live, ye live also." &gt;&gt; You see what these the book of Acts is? It's the very life of Jesus Christ now acting itself out in his believing children. And if you don't see the fruits of that in your life, GOD IS CALLING TO YOU TO TELL YOU there's more for you. There's a greater surrender. There's deeper depths. There's more revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Because he was THE WORD AND THE WORD always corrects the error. &gt;&gt; The word always corrects the error of the age, the church, and the individual. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then THAT'S WHY WE THANK GOD FOR SENDING US A MESSAGE. NOT ONLY DOES IT CORRECT THE HEIR TO THE AGE, TO THE CHURCH, AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL. IF I COULD SAY IT LIKE THIS, IT EXPOSES WHAT'S WRONG AND REVEALS what's right. Now, we don't have time for it, BUT WE COULD ROLL THROUGH THE DAYS OF NOAH AND AND ROLL THROUGH certain uh uh things in scripture, BUT BROTHER BANNER SAID UH UH SPEAKING UH HE HE SAYS OF CHRIST, HE SAID HE WAS THE SPOKEN WORD OF THAT AGE. SO THEREFORE, THE IDENTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD WAS IN CHRIST. AND I'M TRYING TO SHOW THAT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOW TO be in the body of Christ. And it only COMES BY ONE WAY AND THAT'S the logos, the anointing. Is that what he said, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, I I can start over. It's what the vindicated prophet said, right? The logos is the anointing &gt;&gt; that comes upon the word, &gt;&gt; right? Now, just because there's imitators, impersonators, and just because the the rain falls on the just and the unjust &gt;&gt; that that don't let that don't let the scarecrow scare you, &gt;&gt; but the logos is the anointing. &gt;&gt; Now, I wasn't in Pentecost, so I'm not, you know, I don't I'm not worried about it. I'm I you know I I I've been raised up right by a believing pastor who's preached this message with all of his heart for for 50 years. So So I haven't had to battle through a lot of those things and worry about those things. I I say because I'm freeborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. HALLELUJAH. I DON'T I don't have all that. so that I could look at the PURITY OF THE WORD. AND WHEN MY PROPHET TELLS ME THE LOGOS IS THE ANOINTING AND THAT LOGOS IS WHAT DIVIDED ITSELF OUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I NEED. &gt;&gt; Because it makes a living action in your life. &gt;&gt; Now, just trying to move quickly uh by the help of God, we'll bring this to a close. Now, I just want to uh show this here in the scripture. Now, but uh earlier in this message and God identifying himself, he he he he he brings out and shows how that Satan was tempting Jesus. But what did Jesus do? He stayed with the word. That's a characteristic of a believer. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. Get behind me. He stayed right with the word. Now, look at this. I I just want to to lay this in as we'll come to a close. I hope we're all doing okay. We have a a water baptism uh right after this. Uh so we're we're we're excited about that and looking at what the the Lord will have for us there. Uh Mark 16 verse 17 through 18. It says, "And these signs shall follow them that think or gather enough information." These shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils, and they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Now, I I love what brother Brandham says in why Christ speak. I believe it is. He says, "Faith sees what God wants you to see." Faith sees what God sees. &gt;&gt; We know that faith is what? A revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, just in closing, think of I believe Elisha with Gahhesa. His servant comes in and says, "We're done for." We are surrounded by the enemy. &gt;&gt; And that's what many of us feel like in our life. We're surrounded by circumstance. We're surrounded by trouble. We're surrounded by impossibilities. We we we only can see the negative things, right? Many times we can only see the opposition. Are you hearing me? Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, in this story in the Bible with Elijah and Gahesa, GAHESA WALKS OUT AND HE SAYS, "OH, MASTER, WE ARE SURROUNDED by the enemy." &gt;&gt; And what does he say? He said, "THERE'S MORE WITH US." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Than that ARE AGAINST US. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S MORE GOOD FOR YOU &gt;&gt; THAN THERE'S BAD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S MORE BLESSINGS THAN CURSINGS. THERE'S MORE DELIVERANCE THAN BONDAGE. &gt;&gt; But what DID HE NEED TO HAVE DONE? &gt;&gt; HE NEEDED HIS EYES TO BE OPEN. NOW, HE WASN'T BLIND, &gt;&gt; but he needed TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION THE WAY THAT GOD WAS LOOKING AT THE SITUATION. &gt;&gt; You look at your situation, it's impossible. OH, I'LL NEVER. BUT HOW DOES [screaming] GOD LOOK AT THE SITUATION? &gt;&gt; By revelation, WHAT DID HE SAY? LOOK, JUST turn the PICTURE TO THE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT SOME SUPERSONIC CLOUD. THAT'S NOT SOME ROCKET. THAT'S NOT JUST SOME SOME SOME CLOUD THAT WAS DRIFTING BY. NO, THAT'S OUR LORD UP THERE. &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS DAY. THE QUICKENING POWER HAS COME TO US. OPEN THE SEVEN SEALS. WHAT WAS THAT? THE INTELLIGENCE OF A MAN. NO. THE QUICKENING POWER OF GOD. SEE, THE QUICKENING POWER FORETOLD THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE. THE QUICKENING POWER OF GOD MADE THE WORD TESTIFY TO IT. IT'S the truth. The angel of the Lord, I TOLD YOU, was around IN THE PILLAR OF FIRE, QUICKENING POWER. LET THE WORLD TESTIFY THAT IT'S THE TRUTH. And in that, they didn't know what it was, right? The world don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE STILL ARGUING AND FUSSING ABOUT IT. THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET ON UH UH UH UH UH THINGS AND TRY TO TRY TO SAY WHAT IT REALLY WAS, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. AND WE knew &gt;&gt; just look this away. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S OUR LORD UP THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A PROPHETIC INSIGHT. IT TOOK A REVELATION TO SAY THIS IS MORE THAN A MAN. THIS IS MORE than the intelligence of man. THIS ISN'T JUST BECAUSE SOME GOOD PREACHER. THIS JUST AIN'T A PROPHETIC GIFT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE VERY INTELLIGENCE OF GOD COMING TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Just a little bit further. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just five more minutes, we'll be done. &gt;&gt; John 14 and 12. Are you going to notice a theme here? Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth, you got to believe. &gt;&gt; But I love how we opened our scripture because you can only believe if it's given to you to believe. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't walk away. &gt;&gt; That's why you run and you come back. &gt;&gt; That's why you give up and come back. Because it AIN'T YOU, IT'S CHRIST IN YOU holding on. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I'd have been DEAD OR LOCKED UP OR 6 feet deep a long time ago. Oh, but something inside of me HAS BEEN HOLDING ON, WAITING FOR THE DAY I FINALLY JUST SAID, "LORD, I'M READY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall you do also, and greater works than these shall you do because I go unto my father. &gt;&gt; I'll just invite the musicians to come as we finish out these couple quotes. God identified himself by his characteristics. Now notice in John 14:12, he that believeth on me, he said, has my identification. &gt;&gt; My characteristics. He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he DO ALSO. THAT IDENTIFIES THAT THE character of Christ is in him. Displaying the characteristics of him. Amen. I feel pretty religious right now. I I'm a little horse. Yes, sir. Oh my. See, there is no mistake about it. HIS LIFE. HE THAT BELIEVETH on me, the works that I do shall he do also. See that identifies the characteristics. Same thing he said. If my character if my character doesn't identify myself, God in him, then don't believe him. Now he also said that he would be identified in that. Then if it doesn't identify him, then he isn't what he says. Look, if God says he's a a savior, if God says he's a deliverer, &gt;&gt; he's a savior and he's a deliverer. &gt;&gt; And today, IF CHRIST DOESN'T identify himself, the characteristics of Christ identify us as being of Christ, believing the word. Jesus was the word. So, he had to believe the word. And how can we say that we are of Christ and then deny any word of that Bible? &gt;&gt; Don't look at that as a negative. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A NEGATIVE. WHAT HE'S TELLING YOU IS YOU ARE WHAT THE WORD SAYS YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PREDESTINATED. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. YOU WERE IN [screaming] HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE GOING IN A RAPTURE. YOU ARE VICTORIOUS. IF GOD BE BEFORE US, THEN WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO THESE THINGS? IF GOD BEFORE [screaming] US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:6, BUT WITHOUT FAITH, maybe on uh what is that on the wings? Hebrews 11:6, "BUT WITHOUT FAITH IT is impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe, &gt;&gt; not must have a perfect attendance at church, must memorize five books in the Bible. Come on, help me out. &gt;&gt; Because look, SATAN WANTS TO MAKE US GOOD message Catholics. &gt;&gt; We're always wanting a part in it. &gt;&gt; What can I do? What can I do? You can't do nothing. Haven't you figured that out? Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't. I would say he can, but he already did. &gt;&gt; You're already forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While we were yet sinners, Christ died for you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you were ever born and manifested in this age, he already forgave you when he was the lamb slain before the FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; It's rigged. [singing] &gt;&gt; Satan loses. GOD WINS. YOU'RE PART OF GOD. That makes YOU A WINNER. YOU EITHER BELIEVE IT OR YOU DON'T. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because without faith it's impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God. That's what you're doing tonight, brother Jacob. You're coming to God. &gt;&gt; And all you got to do for he that cometh to God must believe that he is. And he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. But the Bible says you can't even seek him. &gt;&gt; If he wasn't drawing you, &gt;&gt; the very reason you're seeking him is because you're his. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. So something in you is crying out. &gt;&gt; I need more. &gt;&gt; I NEED GOD. &gt;&gt; I NEED DELIVERANCE. What is it? It's the real you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's that real you down on the inside and saying all this other stuff, it never worked. &gt;&gt; But there's something in my soul crying out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says this in Romans 4:19. He says, "And being not weak in faith," [music] speaking of Abraham, "he considered not HIS OWN BODY NOW DEAD WHEN HE WAS about 140 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. HE STAGGERED NOT AT THE PROMISE of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. And being fully persuaded what he promised, he was also able to perform. &gt;&gt; I've had a lot of people make me promises. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I've had A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME, "I'LL PAY YOU BACK." I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "I'LL be there tomorrow." I've had a lot of PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE the character or THE ABILITY TO BRING TO PASS WHAT THEY SAID. But my Bible tells ME THAT GOD is not a man that he should lie. AND IF HE TOLD you if you call on the name OF THE LORD YOU SHALL BE SAVED THEN I SAY CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD my God is able to PERFORM THAT WHICH HE PROMISED. IF HE SAID BY MY STRIPES you are healed then you are already healed. If he's GIVEN YOU A PROMISE BY HIS WORD [cheering] that God will perform that which he has promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Oh, there are two roads. Amen. If you could help brother Jacob go and get ready, brother Chris. Oh, it takes [music] Oh. There [singing] are two roads you may [music] take. One by side, one by faith. Oh, [singing and music] take the word of God. What you see oh [singing] is what will be. Oh set your wings to the winds [music and singing] of faith. Oh you can fly in a high place. Lord, do not struggle. [singing] It's by grace. [music] Set [singing] your wings to the [music] wind. What's your name? What's your cry? Watch your cry. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; the word of God. I am by the world. Set [music] your way to his [music and singing] I [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. We're going to have a baptism [music] and brother Matthew is going to baptize. I believe Jacob is a a longtime friend, right? school made uh of Matthew and and I I just think it's wonderful [music] and uh you know I I I thought of when Matthew is preaching he said we want a God that can go out and deliver the alcoholic can deliver the one that's in the bondage the one that that can come to the Lord but he's got to use you to do do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that's the marvelous thing is and I think one of the thing really I wanted I know Matthew was trying to get across to you this evening. Don't sell yourself short. You're anointed for the job. &gt;&gt; You know anointed also means appointed. &gt;&gt; Do you you know what I mean? And so you're appointed and if he appoints you for the job, he's going to equip you &gt;&gt; with the things to do the job. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to worry. You know, even they even said, don't take no thought of what you said. The spirit of God will give you the words to say. And I don't know if you've ever testified to somebody, all of a sudden the word of God's just flowing out of you and it's almost like you're revelating yourself. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And that's the kind of God we serve. And I also another point that I thought Matthew brought out so beautiful was about the call and how you know when you talk about not letting Jesus into your house. Open the door, let Jesus in. He'll help you clean it. &gt;&gt; He'll help you clean the living room. That's the kind of God he is. &gt;&gt; He'll put stuff in their place. He'll come in and he'll clean it. He'll go into your bedroom. He'll go in every part of your heart and your life and he'll take it through. But all you got to do is open that door. And I just couldn't help but get away from Romans. I just want to read this to you as they're as uh um uh Matthew's preparing for baptism. And it said in Romans 9, he said, "And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. And I that I that's the thing that if you could only get that part down when he's calling you and he's tugging on you and he's reaching out to you for no matter what it is, it's a deep calling to a deep, &gt;&gt; you know, whether it's to go higher in the Lord, whether it's to lay for yourself a pattern of good works in your life, whether it's to ask the Lord, what can I do for you, Lord. It It's a deep that's got to start on his end. &gt;&gt; And he calls. So you might think it's conviction, but it's not conviction. It's a call to a higher, right? And and he won't call you if he doesn't have it. I just read in oncoming storm. He said, "Before God can warn you of a storm, he's got to provide a place of safety &gt;&gt; for that storm. that &gt;&gt; and I thought that was marvelous. There's got to be a place of safety first. And if the and and the world warned you, you know, if you know in in alcoholics anominous and I'm not against that thing. Anything that helps people, I'm for it. But they finally come to a place that they hear the warning. If you continue down this road, you will perish. They hear that warning and of course they as a group of men and women they try to provide a place of safety and I think that's wonderful but we know the real deliverance place. &gt;&gt; They teach they teach you'll always be an alcoholic so come to our place of safety. We teach we have a place of safety where alcohol doesn't exist anymore &gt;&gt; and and that's what's marvelous. But just listen to this as we finish reading it. He says, "It was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I love, and Esau have I hated." What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I'll have compassion." So then, it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but of God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; And and isn't that what we're all here? We've all just God's just all showed us mercy. And and so uh Jake, God bless you, my brother. Lord be with you. And it's as brother Matthew baptized this young man. Uh it's God showing mercy. &gt;&gt; It's God that calleth. &gt;&gt; So you're actually seeing the scripture come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's him making himself known. And I'll just say one, I'm going to give you a little testimony. Matthew said he was raised up in a good Christian home by a good pastor. But that's not what saved him. &gt;&gt; What saved him was when God come down and dealt with his heart. &gt;&gt; And you can't teach that. &gt;&gt; God's got to do that. And now we see the continuing fruit being manifest. So don't give up, buddy. God loves you. God's with you. Don't give up. You can have what you ask for. Just have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Believe they have it miked. Uh this this is a wonderful opportunity u to be able to baptize my friend Jacob Cox. We uh he knows because I was the instigator. I was the I ran pretty hard. But um God got a hold of my life some 25 years ago around that time. Me and Jacob were were very good friends and we've remained friends. And uh I've always believed that he was a son of God and and we've kept in contact over the years and at some point when the time is right I'm I'm I know he can share some testimonies but I'll just say this there was a there was a time where Satan tried to take his life but because he was a son of God he couldn't do it because as the scripture says in Jeremiah 29:11 I know my thoughts that I think toward you they're They're not evil thoughts. They're thoughts of peace to bring you to an expected end. And Satan and the enemy has always tried to bring a certain result, but God's always been there. That pillar of fire has always been there standing between the seed and the enemy because God knows what he wants you to become. And there's nothing that can stop that. And I'm so thankful that that Jacob is is responding to that call. Is there something you just want to say, brother Jacob? &gt;&gt; I'm ready for God to be in this temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. that's that's good enough for me. He's ready for God to be in this temple. And and I and I was sharing him with the gospel. I said, "That's the promise is [music] to repent. Then you get the Holy Ghost. Then you get the power to bring the flesh under subjection uh uh to the Holy Ghost and those things of the word." So I just want to read the scripture here as we know that we were given a commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. And we know by divine revelation what that name is because Peter here in Acts chapter 2 he said now when they heard this they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,"repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he's able to perform &gt;&gt; that which he's promised? Amen. Praise the Lord. Not yet. Just Jacob according to the word of the Lord that says go into all the world and preach the gospel and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost. I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Why don't we sing that song? [applause] Victory is mine. Hallelujah. Let's just sing that. Why don't you stand and praise the Lord? And [applause] we'll just hands Ben and help us to sing this song. Well, victory is mine. Oh, victory. [music] [music] I told Satan to leave me behind. Victory [music] is mine. I knew that the Lord would bring me [music] out. Oh, I got him on my knees [music and singing] and I got up singing and shouting the victory. Victory today is mine. [music] I to leave behind. Victory [music] today is mine. Amen. I want to sing another song. and night might not fit in the flow of things, but I I really like it. And it it's the song that says, "I was made for more." &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And and that's what I want you to believe. Just think, I mean, you know, when when my when my kids weren't living so good, I always used to think, well, it was because I was a hippie. Well, that's not what it was. Their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm just grateful to God. You understand that he used Lesie and I to bring them into [music] the world, but they would have come into the world anyway and they had been preachers anyway. It's a blessing to me that I have three sons that preach the gospel. But you would have never you would have never believed it looking at the kid that walked down the streets of California. And if you look at yourself, John, there's no way you'd ever think it could happen to you, right? You know, John's listening to the radio and this guy on the radio m mentions the name William Brandom. So John says that's that strikes him. So he starts reading and listening to brother Brandham. It's the truth. How he got you, I don't know. &gt;&gt; But he found every single one of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. And it doesn't mean that because you're brought up in a a message home that that's your message religion. &gt;&gt; God will make himself real to you personally. &gt;&gt; And if he's calling you, [music] well, that's a good thing. We all got records. Ain't that right, Matt? Yeah. We don't even want to know. I know a lot of things about people's lives. And I'll tell you something. God is greater than everything that we've ever done. He that is in us is greater than he's in the world. Let God call you. &gt;&gt; Don't fight him. Just surrender and say, you know, I I I've been made for more. Why should I stay in this condition of beating myself down and and everything when I know I was made for more? Help me sing it. [music] You know who? Oh, the cross of salvation [music and singing] was only the start. [music] I love that verse. Oh, [singing] now I am chosen, [music] free and [music] oh, and I have a future [music] and he's worth living. [music] Oh, cuz I [singing] was amazing. I was called by morning [music] [singing] praise to life. God was [music] all and [music] so why would I [singing] be my shame when mountain of grace is running my [music and singing] way. I know I am yours. I was faithful. Oh, I know who I [music] am. Cuz I know who you [music] are. Oh, the cross of salvation. Oh, was only your son. Oh, [music] now I am chosen. free and forgive. [music] Oh, and I have a future [music] and it's worthless. [music and singing] I was made in the grave. I was called by [music and singing] raised back to life again. I was faithful [music and singing] and so I when [music] I b [singing] my shame with the mountain of grace is running my [music] way. I know I am thallelu. [music] You call [music] my name [singing] so I'll sing out your praise. Hallelu. [music] You bear my name. I'm not going. might [music] you might sing [music] God your praise you [music] my God [music] I was amazing I was falling [singing] Lord and raise back [music] to life again. Oh, I was faithful. I love this. So why [music] would I be my shame with a mountain of running [music] my [singing] way? &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope this evening [music] that you know you've been made for more and that God's got a job for you to do. Let the anointing of God's word quicken the word to you. Let him speak to your heart. Lay for yourself a pattern of good works [music] that your good works might glorify your father in heaven. Bring Christ into your life. [music] bring the word into your life. Let it live out from you that others may see what the hope is in Christ Jesus. [music] Amen. God bless you. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, I believe every person that's in here this evening, regardless [music] of what they may think of themselves, Father, you look on them as your child and you want to break every chain Satan has on them. They weren't made to tend a grave. They weren't made to lay in a bed of shame. They were made for more. Father, may we seek the more in our life. More of you, Father. May we just grow in the understanding of your grace and love towards [music] us. May we open the riches that the pillar of fire has brought to us in our day. Father, may we determine that we're going to leave this place this evening a better Christian than when we came in more effort to our spiritual life. Father, give us a spiritual mind. The carnal mind is emn with God, but the spiritual mind is life and liberty. Father, increase our faith because without faith, we have no spiritual reality. And Father, we pray today that our faith has been lifted up that we'll change the way we look at life and we'll have a choice of faith. We choose you, heavenly father. [music] We ask you to continue to bless us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for coming out. [music] I know it's cold, but we're going to a place where the weather's perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish there was a song that really could describe heaven. But alls I can say is he knows exactly what you like. If you like 78, it'll be 78. And I'll be there and it'll be 80 for me and 78 for you. and it's going to be perfect. Whatever you want. It's tailor made just for you. And there's a place at that table that nobody can sit but you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody can take your place. Amen. Go in peace. God bless you. A amen. You are dismissed. [music] Oh, you're &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And this word is true [music] all the time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I will shine [singing] light all the time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
