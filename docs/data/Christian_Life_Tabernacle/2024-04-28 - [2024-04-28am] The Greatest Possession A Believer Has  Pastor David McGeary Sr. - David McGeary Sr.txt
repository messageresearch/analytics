father please accept our humble service this morning to your greatness as unworthy as we are you chose to love us and father we thankful for that today and we ask you to bless us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated I uh uh would like to just listen to 20 minutes of a sermon uh this morning before we start I think it's uh mindful you know uh the uh this week we got a a testimony um I believe that I I think it was sister uh Lily uh Matt and Heidi's daughter uh they diagnosed uh some uh complication that can come with pregnancy and and so I I don't know the words are exactly all that it is but it can be harmful to the mother so they rush her to the hospital and when they get to the hospital the people at the hospital said of course Heidi put out prayer request and you know maybe some of you got it and we prayed and so when they get to the hospital they say they get her there and they say to her they say uh well how in the world did they come up with this diagnosis and they sent them back and I thought well they asked the wrong question you know what I mean no what they needed to ask how did from there to here did everything go away you know sometimes it's important that you ask the right question you know what I mean and and that that I just thought you know I just thought that was striking you know that God moves in such a way that he's always hides himself in simp licity uh uh so many times we we think a miracle is something that's got to have a a a great uh big orchestration and got to be way out and you know like they show in the movies you know uh those leopards were healed and nobody even knew only one even came back to said Thank you and so you can just imagine that uh we think all these great things took place but believe it or not all the great miracles of god took place in the midst of unbelief there was only a very few people that even recognized them as Miracles you know that people explain them away and there's coincidence in everything but I just thought that was marvelous the hand of God doing something and once again here he is in our midst and he goes unrecognized but praise God we recognize who it was he amen amen so if you have your Bibles let's turn to uh we're going to turn over to the uh St John the 9th chapter and we're going to start with the 26th verse and I'm not going to read it uh our messenger is going to read it and I just this just say 21 minutes but I want it to be the foundation of where uh that we're going uh this morning CU I want to preach on uh a a little subject called the greatest possession of the believer the greatest possession of the believer what it what is it that the Believers possesses that's the greatest thing so uh we' like to talk about that but before we do this this is from the message called taking sides with Jesus very important message I think it's very timely uh for the atmosphere and the things that are transpiring around us not only within the political natural scientific worlds but also within the church world it's very important that we learn to take sides with Jesus so the minute we're done reading these scriptures uh then we just uh simply uh and the last uh statement of this scripture says and Jesus has heard heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the Son of God so at that point we'll sit down so God bless you I hope you enjoy this this morning after the scripture reading sit down and and we'll have a good time of Fellowship for the Lord richly bless you now in St John the 9th chapter I want to read from the 26th verse unto the 35th now just for a few minutes and then we'll we'll close in the next 20 to 30 minutes or maybe before that time the Lord willing now I want to read these scriptures now from St John 26 to uh St John 10 9 uh 26-35 I've got roll down here just something I was thinking of then said they unto him again what did he do to thee how open he thine eyes and he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear again will you also be his disciples then they reviled him and said th his disciples but we are moses' disciples we know that God spake unto Moses but for this fell we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he has opened mine eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and and doeth his will him he heareth since the world began has it not heard that any man has opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing then answered they answered and said unto him thou was altto together born in sin and does thou teach us and they cast him out and Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the Son of God now I'd like to speak just for a few minutes to you Brethren knowing at my little talk here I don't know what will become of it trusting that God will use it in some way and now in this upon his word word so I know that brother Saint brother Neville or one of you ministers usually preach and just being here with you uh if you pardon me I just like to speak to you a little bit on this manner now I want to take a subject here of taking sides with Jesus the Pharisees and leaders of his Day always tried to belittle him before the people that was just a way that the devil had a working all the Pharisees and the teachers of his day constantly tried to belittle Jesus they all the throw that they could give to him they done it they watched him constantly to find where they could find a fault and they never spoke of that they could belittle him about and say you see look here here if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it this way or if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it that way they were trying to cast The Shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieve him amen that's the work of the devil and that old scheme has never ceased there's many times that a minister will make a mistake and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who who's trying to do what's right and to lead the people right everything that the devil can point to the unbeliever or the so-called Christian in that neighborhood to throw off on that man he'll do it you know the real Christian way is to hide everything you can from a brother don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell what you know about him's good if anything's bad let it alone poor Fell's got enough against him anyhow don't try to take a pole and shove a man further into the ditch the Christian attitude is pick him up and take him out of the ditch they don't never try to shove him down he's down already try to help him up and but too many of us today too many people today I might say try to do that if they could just get something and other that they could say that was real bad now for instance if if one of you brethen make a mistake and do something's wrong which you're subject to do it I am too every one of us but as we go along let's remember we are brothers we are brothers and if we got any fighting let's fight with one another bring it together bring it before our Brethren and settle it now they used to in the Brandon family if one of the little ones done something he go tell Bill about it because I was the biggest and I had to stand there and see which was right and wrong well my decision was that uh if they uh which one is right and wrong if they still didn't believe it then they got around behind my back and fought it out but they were still Brothers you see that fight in the backyard with one another and fight in the front yard for one another so that's the way it was see and it were still Brothers well that that's the way we we got to do this see if you got something against somebody you're a brother don't tell somebody else about if it's wrong go to him and tell him and then if if he go to argue with you then take somebody else with you then bring it up the way the Bible said but Jesus they they just tried to find every little shadow that they could find to try to belittle him in the sight of the people and that's what the devil wants they want to they want to hurt your influence before the people that's why you want to watch careful what you do walk like real man of God talk like man of God see act like man of God live like man of God because a devil your adversary is going about like a roaring line trying to devour what he can why did they do this they were jealous of him that was what's the reason they tried to belittle him they were jealous of his ministry and that's the reason they were trying to belittle but he had the ministry of God and they knew that but it was contrary to their Creed so they were trying to belittle him make everything every little flaw that they could find get him out of the way they want him to quit they want the people to denounce him they want to say now uh this guy's nothing look here now there he is he he he did this and you know that's not right we've been taught all of our life that we should believe the elders and Y he just stood right there and Bal that Elder out he disagreed with the tradition of the fathers and we've been we are to believe the tradition of our fathers we've been taught that by each Rabbi all the years through and here this man comes around and disagrees with him see well the man like that ain't fit to be a preacher see they were trying to belittle him but in all of that the ones that believed him and loved him and had seen his scriptural Miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him amen those who loved him stood F they would not see what others pointed out to them oh if we could do that if we could just not see if somebody turn around here and say you know what they say you're a Pentecostal not by denomination what you was the you you the kind of baptizes in Jesus name yep that's right well let me tell you something I Know a Man one time was baptized like that and he did so and so but look it that has nothing to do with it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow on you amen they're always trying to point you to some old ship that got wrecked upon the seashore but they're not pointing you to that one that made the void safely that's right that's right they're always trying to throw a crowbait out there and say this is example here's what did it uh I know a certain preacher that was a Holiness preacher and he did this that the other but they don't point out others that wasn't Holiness did that also you see and they don't part the great things that God did like somebody say oh he this man went too far he he went too far he might have done that he wrecked himself up he went too far he become a fanatic he might have done that but while they're pointing to how many that went one that went too far how about these millions that never went far enough Fable to see that see what I mean so the people tried them Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians and all tried to cast the Shadow on Jesus but them True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and see no fault in it at all same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with these people they just see Jesus and that's all they're they're they're it predestinate eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and stay there we used to write sing a little song brother Roy uh R we used to sing a little song here I guess time you come here I take the way with the Lord's dispise few I started in with Jesus and I'm going through I'd rather walk with Jesus alone and have far my pillow like Jacob a stone well you've heard the little song that's right I'd rather take the way of the discard take the way of the despised take the way of the talked about and walk with Jesus see no fault in it at all don't see another Fell's eror just keep on going that's all now that's the way they did to Jesus they didn't they didn't and you must teach your people you pastors to do the same if somebody comes along and says uh you know uh your church they was so and so they yes sir they maybe a dozen of them sitting there then but about that one it's it's it's all right sitting there see you're you're you're you just can't see the woods for the trees that's all that's it right back again see now and so they tried they was not willing to admit that he was doing the work of God so they were trying to so discard and get the people not to believe but them people who believe him stayed right with him they took Sid you know I thought you're a couple of people I got wrote down here the blind man would not be changed by them that man he just give his s we know the story and um he gave them a very stinging question beside now they come up there and Jesus walked by and he was a man that was despised and hated the Bible said he would be rejected uh there be no beauty of him we should desire him and all we like sheep have gone astray is a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and and how all the Bible said what he would be he'd be despised and rejected and we see that man now those who believe the word they know that the very things that Jesus was doing and the things was of his life they knew who he was so they couldn't put nothing light on him because they couldn't see it and you know love is blind anyhow Same Love covers up a multitude of sin you know perfect love cast out fear and sin sin all Discord love does now this blind man was sitting there and Jesus and his disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave them a little lesson here when they seen this poor blind man they thought well now surely there's a sin behind that somewhere when we see something happen to a man we always say well he sin he got out of the way of the Lord somewhere brother Chris hit the post he got out with a lord somewhere somebody's idea when the gun blow up on me well is is out of the will of the Lord Brother Neville hit the car is out of the will of the Lord that's not exactly right no sir it isn't God permits those things Jesus turned around and taught him a lesson they said his father must have sinned or or did his mother sin or did he sin Jesus said neither of them sin but that the works of God might be made manifest amen see God lets things happen just to for the works of God to be made manifest now and so he said told the man and give him his sight and he went he's waiting and here come the Pharisees up when that was rumored around here was the man as blind set now they're begging and here he could see and that's a rumored around among them and oh my that stirred up something and here they come up there and they see that the blind man could see and first they went wanted to find some way to put a fear of upon all the people because they had already said if anybody goes after this new doctrine and this new Prophet called Jesus of Nazareth immediately they'll be handed their paper and fellowship from the church they cannot go to synagogue no longer if you associate with him 10 one of his meetings or anything you can't go no more so they want to make a big display out of it because they hated him they wasn't thinking that poor blind man but they wanted to make a big display to make the people keep away from him they said they wanted to ask his father and mother so they went and got the father and mother they said is this your son he said yes sir was he born blind yes sir and uh what means does he see and the father and mother was afraid the Bible said because they know they'd be put out of the synagogue if they admitted it it was and see there it was taken down they said now we know this is our son all probably a few thousand people stand there but if he could if them stinking Pharisees could only put a blight on his name right there or done something to scare the people they running out of there for that meeting see all his influence have been lost so they said uh a bunch of them come up there at their Priestly garments on and they said uh speak for him they said we know this is our son we know he was born blind but now how he sees I don't know you asked him he's of age all right so they went over and got him said who give you your sign how do you heal him he said uh one called Jesus of Nazareth give me my sign and they said give praise to God said well we know this man's a sinner said uh and I said when is he he said I don't know he just come by and heal me that's all I know about I know one thing I do know I couldn't tell you about him being a sinner or not I don't know I've just met the man today but if if he could give me my my sight I know this one thing that where I was once blind I can now see I'm sure of that where I was blind a half hour ago and now I got just as good as sign as any of you fellas so I know I can see oh what a stinger that put on them so they thought well he said well I said you all want to be his disciples too that's good that's good solid testimony that that that's good that's good backgrounds that that that's really good witnessing what I think said to you all here's a lay member a blind man standing on the street after meeting Jesus now asking the disciple asking the Pharisees if they want to be his disciples the Bishops headman you want to be his disciples also they said nay you're his disciple we're Moses disciple looking way back down through history you know we're his disciple this man we don't know nothing about him we don't know where he come from well we haven't got a rule of any of our schools you ever come up you never come and ask us about these things see we don't know nothing about it you people out there you realize that man's not arain that man's a souser or something he's B you're being Bewitched why he doesn't have any Authority we haven't give it to him yet see we don't even know when this man comes from this old boy standing there could see said now this is a marvelous thing see he's not get the people be down these Pharisees was make them afraid see but he had done tough size with Jesus see so he said uh this is a marvelous thing let me break it down some of the words he might have said now you fellas around here has been running all the religious end of this for hundreds of years and uh you speak of a coming Messiah and something is going to take place just in the shadows of time when the deliverer is coming to see us and you tell us that when he comes that that what all he's going to do and here you the spiritual leaders the high priest and priest of this community standing here together before these people trying to Blacken his name trying to say something evil against him and the man come and open my blinded I was born blind here's my father and mother giving witness that I was born blind been sitting right here among you for all these years born blind and that has never happened since the world began and you're a man can come and perform a miracle that hasn't been done since the world began and you the spiritual leaders and don't know nothing about it am and I say this is a marvelous thing you took sides with Jesus see he was permitted to be blind so the works of God could be manifested see because he come on the side of the Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he put a stinger to him you know what they did they said now we know you were born in sin try to teach us and shoved him out of the church knocked him out pushed him out throw him out but as soon as he was sold out to did you notice Jesus found him again amen amen Lord Jesus found him again so don't worry if they throw you out he'll find you again all right and he said to him does thou believe on the Son of God he said Lord who is he he didn't even know but the only thing that he know that where he was blind he could then see I know this one thing brother you might call this fanaticism and whatever you want to but wh and I was once the sinner I've come into Grace now something has happened to see this one thing I I now know by trusting his word by believing him I've been kicked out of every organization are the face of Heaven there's none of them that will receive me anymore you know that some of their man will out here good man will AC but every organization is thumbs down on me that's right but he's found me you find me somewhere that's that's right come along like that and um so it'll be all right because we want to take sides with Jesus and the only way you take sides with Jesus is taking sides on what he said believe in his word so let's take sides with him great lesson there amen and we want to U Fellowship a little bit along those lines about the greatest uh possession that a Believer could have and I I believe our messenger uh mentioned it when we were reading and listening there in paragraph 150 uh he made this statement and see if I can find it here for us real quick and read it again now those who I'm sorry um he said and now those who believe the word they know that the very thing that Jesus was doing and the thing was of his life they knew who he was and they couldn't put nothing bright on it him because they could couldn't see it and you know love is blind now I want you to know what they said they couldn't find any criticism in them because they couldn't see it and you know the the the prophet of God is telling us right here he says don't let somebody come and bring you something negative about somebody else don't don't let them try to get you to see something that you're not seeing you know point it out they couldn't they couldn't accept it because they couldn't see it and and so uh and he makes this statement he said they were always always want to put a a blight on them something on them a mark on them you you know that uh like when a plant's got blight it's got black marks on it you know it's it they always some sort of criticism trying to put over them oh he don't believe this he don't believe that he don't you know and and just and he's telling us right here don't you listen to it don't don't don't do it if you love them you don't see it if you love them you don't see it and this is what he says he says because they couldn't see it they so they couldn't put nothing blight on him because they couldn't see it you know love is blind anyhow to them things love covers up a multitude of sin you know perfect love cast out fear and sin and all Discord love does and and so from that Foundation I'd like just to uh share a little fellowship with you this morning um in along the lines of the greatest possession that the believer has what is the greatest possession that you could have as a Believer and there words if you could take something out of Christianity or something out of the Bible or or something that you could lay your hands on and say this is what I would like to have this is you know I have a coin collection and and I've I've collected all the coins uh in this certain collection except for one coin it's the one coin I don't have and it's a very rare coin and uh uh uh and if I was in the realm of of the coins I would say I would love to possess this one coin if I could have this one coin and now I didn't know that when I started collecting these coins I just would buy one and was good and buy another one it's good and then somebody sold me some and and all of a sudden I have this all the coins except for this one so I went to look for this one and when I finally got out there I found out that this one coin the cheapest price on this one coin is $65,000 and I thought m i I don't have that in all my coins but this is the one coin now that I'd like to have it's the one thing I'd like to possess yes if I could say anything about anything I would say I would like to say I have a you know 1892 uh S silver dollar that might not be the exact description because I don't want any of you to go out and buy that for me but it be now it's if I had that I I would have more than all that I have so that one coin becomes the greatest possession of all the coins so what is the greatest thing that a a a Christian the greatest possession a Christian could have and I believe that greatest possession that a Christian could have is love that that's the greatest thing and and when you possess something it's something you know that you have it's yours you have the evidence of it right if if I had that coin I could go in there and open my little box up and I could take the coin and and and I could hold it in my hand and I would know that I possess it I have this it's mine I have it I own this no I I can talk to you about this coin I can tell you all about how many were printed and the dates it was printed and what kind of conditions they they are but it's unobtainable for me you you understand I realize that I'm not going to go out and put that kind of money into that when there's so many other things to do but but uh so I can know about it I can have great conversations and I've had tremendous conversations about that coin that guy meant a man that has one he has it in mint condition I even wanted to look at it and I don't think he wanted to take it out you know the coins worth over a million dollars one coin and he's got it oh it was great talking about but get when I walked out of there he had it and I didn't I didn't possess it and I couldn't talk him out of it because he knew what he had he knew what he possessed he knew the value of it he knew the Rarity of it and may I say this today that real genuine Christian love is a very rare thing very few people possess it and we just we just heard our messenger go through talking about uh uh what Satan does and and and how he casts doubt on people and he says bad things about people and he just runs people he just jealous as as can be and And yet when he begin to describe the he described a Christian don't do that a Christian don't see that a Christian doesn't think evil a Christian doesn't take sides with that that's our brother that's our brother he said we we we we fight in the backyard but we stand together in the front yard you don't the how does Satan uh destroy a army he gets it divided against itself gets it criticizing itself gets it taking sides take sides with this Doctrine take sides with that Doctrine take sides with this approach this is the way this this church does this this is the way this church does that do this church does it right this church does it better wait a minute every church is sovereign we don't we're not trying to denominate it isn't about it's about whether us as individuals whether you as an individual possess the love of God God so loved the world that when he projected his love he gave us his only begotten son that as many as believed on him had power to become the Sons and Daughters of God to possess that love that the father had for you and if you would turn in your Bibles and you would and we would look at the gospel of of uh St John in in the 17th chapter and the starting at the 20th verse uh I want you to see that this is something that Jesus possessed because if God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son then Jesus was the love of God Jesus possessed the love of God and so when he came across that blind man The Compassion that he had and the love that he had he caused him to go down and mix that mud and put it on his eyes and and and I love that Bible story I just love it I love the how that somebody could be so cold in their heart have such so caught up in the pride of what they believe so caught up in the pride of the stand that they take so filled with such self-righteousness you know my interpretation right my vision's right the way that I interpret things is right the way I believe is right that actually they could take no joy and a a boy that been blind all his life now he was he was old enough to speak for himself in our country we'd say was 18 then it might be 12 I don't know but he he sees and they couldn't even lift their hand to go praise God this boy sees God is with Israel no they were so jealous that they didn't do it that they could take no joy in it they they lacked they they didn't possess the compassion that Jesus had they didn't possess the feeling that Jesus had for that boy oh his mama sinned his daddy sinned it's the sins visiting oh I don't want you know if you take that judgment seat that's the Judgment seat that you're going to be judged by he told us when somebody somebody something befalls somebody you don't all of a sudden say oh there's a reason behind that you know I know why they got in that wreck you know I know why they lost their job great discerners of life you know you just you you sit back and you think what's happened to people we don't we don't need to sit in the Judgment seat of one another we don't need to be comparing ourselves one to another it's not about that what is it to you if he terries till I come follow thou me I want to know that I have and possess the greatest thing a Christian can possess and that's the love of God shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost that's what every believer ought to be contending for no bitterness no hatred no vile words no backbiting why the scripture says what's wrong with us we we you're devouring one another it gets to be like a cancer you know I don't care what's going on I I I I do not step into this Pulpit preaching to anybody who's online if you want to know what I believe I don't believe in online preaching we have it because of covid and we have it because some of our people can't make it but when if you staying home when you could be in the house of the Lord don't count that as a mark for you it's evidence against you and I just don't want to get out there I don't want to be caught up in all the fussing I don't want to be caught up in all the fighting I don't want to be come up in all the doctrinal explanations in anything I want to follow the word of God Amen I want to take sides with the word I want to stay with the message of the hour that's why we played this this morning because our messenger telling us don't go there you don't need to figure out who's right and who's wrong if you stay with the word of God you find out that in the word of God all things are covered you know the prophet of God said that sometimes God allow a preacher to go out astray what seemingly is astray just to go out somewhere that he might pick somebody up and bring them back in now could you imagine me somebody going oh that preacher's off on a false Doctrine he's going down the wrong road he's doing all this all this and all the time it's God right that's what they did oh this guy's blinding because who sinned his parents his grandparents all this everybody wanted to know why did this curse come and the whole reason he was blind is that the glory of God might be manifested what side of that judgment would you have wanted to been on would you like your opinion to have fallen on the side that his family was sinners that's what the Pharisees said you were all together born in sin that's right in other words they said you were born blind that was the result of sin Jesus saying no it's not he was been born blind that the glory of God might be manifested now the only way you would have been able to make that judgment and that discernment is if you possessed the love of God cuz you wouldn't be thinking no evil so it's the greatest possession that the believer in St John 17 Jesus says this the 20th verse he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word hallelujah I like that scripture because it places me in every scripture in the Bible it makes every word in that book for me I don't have to put an age on it I don't have to put history on it I don't have to say this days are gone these days aren't gone no I believed it I received it by their word and Jesus prayed for me that's right and this is what he prayed for me and I and I believe it was placed in that order so we could grab a hold of it this is what he's praying for all them that believe on me through their words this is what I'm praying that they have that they all all of us them and the US that believed that they all might be one no not we're here of this city or of this ministry I go to Brother David mcgary's Church no you don't you go to your church it's not mine it's yours and if you're sitting here not believing it's yours not believing that it's your body it's your brothers and sisters it's your care it's your it it it's your ministry it's your works it's your concerned then you are you're you're you're in a denominational mindset this isn't about we're here and we're there and and and we're under this ministry we're under that Ministry well I'll tell you something let me let it be known where but this is my absolute yes that's right you put these together and you have the interpretation of this book you can't read this book without reading it through this this is the code the spiritual code that makes this come [Music] alive the letter kth but divine revelation Faith which cometh by hearing brings this to life quickens it that's what we're one with that's what we're taking sides with we're not taking sides with a Ministry we're not taking sides with a type of preaching we're not taking sides with an approach we're not taking sides with worship or how somebody worships whether this guy has drums or doesn't have drums we're not taking sides with that we're taking sides with Jesus the word of God you do that within yourself either you love him or you don't he who loves the world and the things of the world does not possess the love of God the greatest thing you can possess is love of God and I'm not talking about your love of God I'm talking about you possessing God's love let's read on further if if you would bear with me for a few more moments that they be me one father that thou art in me and and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me now how in the world are we going to tell the world about Jesus when we're devouring one another when we've got to where we're arguing about doctrines and gifts and and and all kinds of stuff where we've turned our eyes on one another instead of turning our eyes on the lost the sick sir and the needy visiting the Widow and their affle Affliction the fatherless and the homeless go being compelled to go the mile turning the other cheek what what what you know that's what he said why the disciples were arguing oh who's going to be the greatest who's going to sit at the table who's going to say that I'm closest to him oh I'm closest to the prophet I I'm closest to his Doctrine I I I I'm I know more what he understands and teaches than than anybody else you're dead I think you spell it d e a d dead dead in unbelief and don't know it not about all that it's about possessing the same love that he had let us read and the glory which thou givest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one the glory he gave us the spirit of God that he poured out on us was never given that we might receive Glory that we might receive accolades that we might receive spiritual judgment you're spiritual you're more spiritual your church is more spiritual our church is more spiritual I'm telling you Church there's a sickness in the land the love of God is dying out people are receiving Doctrine without possessing The Giver the greatest possession that you could have as a Christian above anything above Joy above above peace above anything is the love of God the same love that could love you as a sinner as vile as you were and still come down and pay the price for your sins and then once you receive that love then that love ought to return back into a life worthy of the Gospel don't keep telling me how much he loves me and then you just do all the stuff that you do you're a hypocrite the best thing we could possess is the love of God devouring somebody doesn't make you something like taking a baseball bat and and going to all your team members in basketball there's five and maybe you go out there and you hit all the other four guys on the head with the bat and they're laying on the ground and you can say I'm the only one standing I'm the best player here I'm number one but you know what you end up losing you lose the great battle you lose the great race what do you think say Satan's trying to do he's trying to create confusion he's trying to create bitterness he's trying to get us to disbelieve he's trying to get us our eyes off the greatest thing that we have the greatest thing we have is we know that you they'll know that you are my disciples by your love one for another it's the identification of a Christian it's never been doctrin some people just are not mentally capable or spiritually positioned to receive and understand certain doctrines and if you're going to destroy him because of that because you think you're more exalted cuz you can explain this and you can explain that I'm telling you you're on the wrong road he didn't do that he gave us the glory for one thing that the love of God could be shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit that we might be one that we might cover one for another that we might lift one another up well what what's happened today we've got the polls out everybody's got a pole pushing somebody in the ditch what good does that do it it seemingly that one time Silas and Barnabas and some of them maybe they had a little stripe or something in the scripture so they decided to go it wasn't maybe overd doctrin but one was pressed with a need to go a certain direction and the other one was press with a need to go a different direction and and they parted ways but down the road they remained one you don't hear Paul going on saying don't you listen to those two guys you know you better not go listen to that you better not listen to this or do that or have anything to do with those guys no later on they says hey send that guy here I need what he has to offer I need his ministry I need his gift I need his inspiration I need his anointing you know the very person that you might criticize one day you might need and are you going to burn the bridge that they can get across to help you are you going to become so bitter in your heart that there's no way back back for them and you heard our Prophet say it they cast him out and Jesus found him again we heard him say it brother they cast me out but don't worry Jesus will find me again Hallelujah this was 1962 Jesus found him again he put a sword in his hand and open the seals that's right I wouldn't want to said nothing sometimes it's good just to wait and pray but let's just finish our scripture and I'm going to try to move on are you all okay if if I if I get long feel free just to to go ahead and step out it says he says that that they may be one even as We Are One what was Jesus's description of the way he and the father were one I do nothing unless the father first reveals it there's no virtue in criticism listen I am them and thou in me that they may that they may be made perfect in one you're not going to be perfect without the person sitting next to you without you being able to love them care for them nourish them pray for them you will never be perfect without them and that the world may know that thou hath sent me and hath loved them as thou hath loved me that that is what is so important to take sides with Jesus I want to talk about the possession of love for a moment that if that's the greatest thing a Believer could have is to have their life their motivation their thoughts their actions driven by the love of God when they meet somebody that you could look past that first impression you could look past their social standing you could look past everything about their outside appearance and have such a love that penetrated past all that that you could have some sort of feeling some sort of compassion if you could have something that that you possessed that was such a Guiding Light in your life that when you looked out you could find the need that somebody hasn't been walking by you day after day that's been hungry that hasn't been able to pay their light bill hasn't been able to have gas in their car and yet you're moved by the spirit the love of God in you becomes mindful of that that your antenna the love antenna just picks up on the needs around you you don't care about your social standing that's right you're not worried about what people think about you that's right can you imagine somebody coming to the Judgment seat and they say well wait a minute Lord I was picked number one in the overall draft I made the allar team I had 40 million followers huh but Jesus is going to say when I was sick you didn't visit me I never knew you I never saw myself in you I had no identification with you oh you were great in Doctrine you're a theologian above all theologians you understood all the Mysteries you spoke with the men of tongues and Angels you've done all these things but I I couldn't identify with you I couldn't find myself in you I couldn't find my love in your heart what do you think you're going to be judged by there's a lot of good people that don't see what you see you don't see it because you came upon it yourself that's you see it by the grace and mercy and love of God then why do we exalt ourselves as though we have not received it but let's just read in Corinthians once again we'll go to the 13th chapter of Corinthians and I want to approach this a little different this morning because I I I'm not saying that you don't possess the love of God I believe you wouldn't be here your love for God has br brought you here but we want to go to a higher level if I could say that and that's the love of God resting upon you in the form of a Capstone the crowning of your life the crowning of your existence giving the final full purpose of why that God put you in this world you say why was I born why was I put here why do I go through the things that I go through that the love of God might abide with you and in you and shine out of you that's why you're here amen may I approach this in a way this morning to put emphasis on what it is that I'm trying to say each of you myself included individually have got to take a look in the mirror and say is the love of God abiding in me not my love for him but is the love that he is cu God is love is that love that Glory that spirit is it in my heart and how is it being demonstrated a lot of people take the book of Corinthians and they substitute the word charity for love and I don't want to do that this morning because if I do that this morning you we're going to miss I believe a great portion of what Paul is speaking about so I'd like to do it like this love is the noun how many of you took English does anybody know what a noun is a noun is the identity of something Dylan noun Dylan this is Dylan it's the it's the identity of something okay it stands alone alls it is is an identification love God is love now charity is the verb okay a verb is used to describe action love is the noun charity is the verb love is the substance charity is the action of that substance you could say poison that's the noun but what's the action of poison death this is what poison does this is what it is this is what it does poison is the description death is the verb love is the substance charity is what that that love does so you can't separate love love is a substance faith is a substance is something that's possess you can realize that you have it and you can realize that it's working in you faith that worketh by love it's something that's that's real and that can be identified I know in school that they they have testing and and the reason that they they they test uh some's aptitude something I don't have the word for what the test is but they want to know how far along are you so they say if you're at a certain age or a certain grade level you should have accomplished or be able to accomplish these tasks there should be a performance level that identifies whether or not you have received what that you have been taught and so you you have a level of performance in sales they give it maybe they might call it a quota they think if you continue at what you're doing and you continue working as hard as you can because obviously your boss don't want you to slack off you know they want you to work harder but you should be able to meet this goal you should be able to be identified by by by the amount of work that you put put in should have a resolve well there should there's a way that you can determine whether the love that's in you is working whether it's in use or whether it's dormant and if my love's dormant I say oh God F me revive me breathe life in me that this love might be shed abroad I hope I've been able to lay this and let's read this together if you would he says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I become as the sounding brass or a tinkling symbol he's already made a great separation between gifts and love it would be sad to think you could have one without the other that's why our messenger said I would rather have the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine then the right Doctrine and the wrong Spirit he said I have become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol in other words I have it doesn't have any effect it's got no action it's dead in the water you can do all these things but if you don't have the genuine love of God shed abroad in your house it goes unnoticed it becomes completely ineffectual you might as well just ring a bell it's just noise but with love all things come to life because Love Is God and the love of God on the scene the love of God on the scene working is charity and though I have the gifts of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing we've read that for years and I believe it stands more clear this morning in actual reality of what's transpiring we have turned our eye to Major on mysteries on understandings and doctrines and our greatest possession has got put away when it should be the thing that's the most Forefront in our lives the very thing that we want the world to know that we have because not everybody understands tongues not under everybody understands Mysteries not everybody understands SE s not but but everybody will sense the love of God when it's there it's the most powerful thing that there is you you know when somebody loves you because it has a characteristic and love becomes worthless if it's not put into action if love doesn't have the verb of Charity it sits alone locked up and what God wants to do is he wants to unlock the love of God in your life amen and you have to turn a lot of cheek to do that you have to take a lot of criticism you have to be able to say there in the midst of all the suffering that's put upon you say father forgive them for they know not what they do it takes more character to love than it does to preach I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing that church those are some tremendous eye openening in another words if I could say it this way this morning if you would allow me don't look on the wrong thing don't ask the wrong question it's not do I understand the Mysteries do I understand the seals am I bestowing my goods upon the poor am I doing all these things do I have all these work you're asking the wrong question the wrong question is is do I possess the love of God do I love you the way God loved me father that they might know that you have loved me and that you love them amen and when you know that if God be for you who can be against you when you know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord when you know if you fall he'll pick you up as we're all prone to do don't use your brother as a stepping stone we've got way too many people want to be spokesmen nowadays I want to be the spokesman for the son of man movement I want to be be the spokesman for the bride coming of Christ I want to be the spokesman for the anti- emotional movement I want to be the spokesman for this and the spokesman for that it'd be a whole lot better if we were just a Spoke instead of a spokesman if we were just part of the wheel and did our part to keep it rolling let's don't get off church this bride this assembly that's here we're a local assembly we're Sovereign in ourselves we don't answer to nobody we answer to ourselves and to the word of God we're not comparing ourselves with anybody we are who we are we trust that you put here you're not obligated here if there's someplace you can be fed better the prophet of God said if a man really loved a woman he said and she knew that that another man would be better for her than him he would gladly see her go wouldn't be is no obligation it's hard to live here in Dallas for it word I would much rather be on an island somewhere or maybe in the low Hills of of low Hill lands of wyom or in Montana with the elk bugling and the deer running in the the anvelope forget the snow there there's a lot of places you say well then why are you here because the love of God is in my heart I didn't even want the love of God I never liked people I didn't like to be around people I didn't like to look at people in fact I don't believe there's going to be any people in heaven cuz people are tough but somebody was kind enough to pick me up out of the pits of hell and take me from the Sheep B and let me go around the world that's a love of God and when God does something like that he that's been forgiven much loves much but that's what you want to be what do we want to be this morning what does Christian Life Tabernacle want to be do we want to hate every church that don't believe the way we believe do we want to put put down every Minister that don't say it the way we say it shame on us they're my brothers they're doing what God wants them to do may they be successful May every sheep that God puts in their flock may they be fed may they be healthy may they bear wool might the world know that that we have God has sent his son Jesus Christ and that we have love one for another and the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost shame on them who are bringing such a disgrace to this message with their bitterness and they're arguing very rarely have you ever heard me stand up here and give you a list and a Litany of the things that I've seen God do you don't think I've seen Miracles you don't think I've seen Devils cast out you don't think I've seen spirits and clouds and black clouds and all those things but who does that give the glory to what's that about this is the only thing thing that's going to get you there is when this makes the love of God come alive in your heart and you love God more than you do the things of the world all these things we will do if God's host permits every single one of you has the power to lay hands on the sick and have them recover you just need the love to motivate you to do it I'm not angry I I I always feel bad when I get done preaching because I have to but I'm not saying it in Anger let's just read the verb of Love Is Charity so Paul's saying this is what love does if you have love this is what the verb this is what ch charity does charity has these characteristics charity is the characteristic of love and action so he says this charity suffereth long charity gives somebody a time to correct themselves charity gives time for someone to find their way charity isn't right on top of them in construction you know we we kind of have a way that we do things if you have somebody pick up a pair of Channel loocks you're waiting right there for them to put those Chanel loocks on backwards and you're going to say they're upside down turning them around there's no longsuffering if they got the wrong bit in their drill moment boy you wrong bit that's a number three not a number two no's no longsuffering you're not going to wait for him to say oh number two I got to get a number three oh no you're going to let him know you got them that's construction that's the attribute of construction everybody trying to show everybody that they know something so you can gain confidence in one another but that's not charity that's right charity gives time give him time to turn them over he'll find out right next time he knows that the bottom goes on the bottom and the top goes on the top you always push towards your the bottom of your Chanel loock did anybody need a Chanel loock lesson this morning does anybody know what channel loocks are but you should know what charity is you should know that it's longsuffering that it bears and allows somebody to make adjustments in their life to make a wrong turn and to find their way back and is kind it's kind and there it doesn't say hurtful things it says good things it finds the good and not the mistake it's not hey man you're you're really doing bad no you're kind hey you did good on that that was good I see you're doing better it's kind it it it's the attribute of it so Paul's saying if I do all these things and I'm not longsuffering if I do all these things and I'm not kind he says as he says here he says charity envieth not it's not envy of what somebody else has you know why CU you possess the greatest thing if I had my coin my million dooll coin you think I'm going to be envious because you have a 1978 I got the granddaddy of them all it don't matter if you've got everything I've got it I've got the pearl of great price I've got the treasure in the field I've got it man if I had that Co Co I would be in the Kingdom of coin collectors I would be the prince I wouldn't even need to have any other coin I've got it I got the granddaddy do you have a coin collection yeah really how many coins you got one one yeah 19 such and suchen oh Hallelujah it settles it it's not envious it's not envious of what other people have it's not envious of their Fame it's not envious of their influence it's not envious of their body shape it's not envious of the color of their hair it's not envious of their wardrobe where's all this junk coming from we we heard it today the devil devil don't care what you know he just don't want you to love he said he said charity vanth not itself and there words it doesn't boast about itself I've done this and I did that and and uh it doesn't run itself down either how can you run yourself down and be speaking good of the love that God has placed in the way he loves you you know maybe I'm maybe I'm no good but there's one thing I know he loves me and that's more powerful in all my failures it's not puffed up it doesn't B itself it doesn't run itself down it doesn't lift itself up it just lets that love move charity is the moving of the love of God in your life it's the verb that's why when you read this you can't say Love Is Love Is Love Is cuz Paul's not saying love is he's saying if you possess love you are you are you are you are you are these things you are doing these things this is you in action this is the way you live this is the way you think this is the way you treat people you say oh brother mcgar that's not a great mystery when I'm preaching you this morning is greater than the full understanding of the seventh seal and I know what it's like to believe the seventh seal is opened when nobody else did that don't get you nothing but I know one thing that gets you everything and that's the love of God let's continue and just talk about it it's not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly love is very conscious of its actions of the words that it speaks the things that it says very careful I've made statements in my past that today when I think about it I get embarrassed all all over again jokes that I've told that I didn't realize to some people were very hurtful oh it might got a chuckle from a few Knuckleheads but they never should have come out of the mouth of a Believer seeketh not her own it's not you first right it's you last you ever see those people that boy they want to make sure they get that last piece of cake on the plate but they're just going to grab that last piece of cake you know boy you can start seeing them across the room here they come they're on their way who's going to get it I've seen lesie all of a sudden people she says oh don't worry there's more everybody's happy does you don't you're not worried about you I'm going to move quickly here and then finish up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not e easily provoked thinketh no evil now you can judge whether you have possessed something by the characteristics of it you don't think there's fake coins out there there's a way you can judge whether it's fake or not there's experts that know whether it's fake or not there's nothing worse than buying a fake there's nothing worse than fake religion look at these things they're the characteristics and the description of your possession these are the title deed to love the these are the boundaries the descriptions of the property I know I have love because I these things are working in me I'm not working them it's the love that's in me is working them I I I I'm just the opposite of this without the love of God I'm puffed up I think about myself I take care of my own self I'm totally opposite without the love of God you must have the love of God without perfect love you will not be there it's the ticket it's above all things it it think of though it rejoiceth not in iniquity if someone's teaching something wrong you don't rejoice was in that you don't blow it out of the water you don't jump all over it what's all that about you love that person you know what you do you give them the benefit of the doubt you say oh they might have went this way for a while but they're my brother they'll be back they're just going there to swing to pick up a few people so that they can bring them back around God's leading their life he's LED their lives for years you don't have to worry about it it's all okay [Music] I just believe he's doing exactly what God wants him to do you don't have to speak evil of it you don't have to give your two cents judgment take care of yourself make sure love is in yourself is that the alarm that says I'm preaching too long it's mine went off the other day so I know what it's like it says it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things these are all these are all things that all of a sudden this is what you become this is what you're doing cuz without this everything else that you have has no quality and no character and power apart from character is satanic charity never faileth and then we could go on where there's prophecies and tongues they fail and but we're talking about The Possession of love and I want to say this this morning in closing that part of what love of God is and God's love for you is recognizing what God has done for you now we're all believers here and we've listened to many tapes together and we understand that God has done things and he's had a way of doing things and we understand the Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ through the church ages and Beyond and we know that we've been taught that the seed Jesus told the church the seeds got to go into the ground cuz if the seed doesn't go in to the ground it will not rise again so he knew that what he planted at the day of Pentecost that original church that he endued with power from on high would go into the Dark Age and that it would be so perverted by men that Catholicism had ruled the world historically and every believer that manifest a spiritual gift they were stoned and burned at the stake and beheaded as witches and susers that the church had gained so much power that it begin to Snuff out anything that seemed to have any spiritual life and so it became so dark that they had a Vicor of Christ they had a pope that ruled over the church they had a succession and the scripture talks about us frogs and and and one coming up and we know all that in the Book of Revelations but we know according to the plan of God that there would come a time that that seed would Break Forth that it would come to life again and that the life would come out of the ground which was the darkness of the Catholic church and we begin to come forward and grow in life now so when that se broke forth it came forth in the first doctrine that was the strongest Doctrine against the mother Harlot was justification because the mother Harlot was making millions and millions of dollars by selling penants we know that in the book don't we about the seal and the penny and a weight of oil and and all that thing within the the framework of the seals book those of you who are reading your seals book and praying and listening to messages and so that seed began to come to life and the first Doctrine they said is Justified our all our sins were forgiven by one offering there's no more offering for sin he paid the price I don't have to and it was a devastating Doctrine to the great Harlot and a people came out from that and the reason they came out the reason that there they uh there was a people there to come out is because God planted a seed to manifest justification there was going to be a people that were called to be on earth at that time to manifest the message of justification they didn't know why they received it they didn't know why they heard it how come they heard justification how come they saw it how come it meant something to them and didn't mean anything to anybody else because it was the seed that was in them they were planted there for the purpose God predestinated them and put them there for the purpose of catching the revelation of justification and coming out from that Harlot and manifesting my sins were forgiven by the blood of the Lamb that's what they were they weren't going to go move on to sanctification they weren't put there to move on to sanctification they were put there for one purpose only and that was to manifest justification and they did it they manifested justification and they're still on Earth today manifesting justification and they're having children that manifest justification because once a seed is there it it it continues to to uh produce seed and that seed only can come forth after its kind so justification wasn't done away with justification still has children of justification there's still people being justified there's still people preaching justification are they my brothers yes do I love them yes do they have a purpose yes are they doing what God called them to do yes it's what they are they can't be something different I can't say why don't you see sanctification what's wrong with you they don't have anything in them to believe sanctification all they can do is be what they are am I going to be bitter am I going to rag on them am I going to point out their failure no I'm going to rejoice and we know then came sanctification as that plant began to go back to what it was before it went into the ground and sanctification come and there was a people that God planted there to be there to manifest sanctification that's what they were there for that's all they could do that's all they heard when they preached the gospel they saw sanctification they saw justification they saw sanctification the Justified seed didn't see sanctification but the Sanctified seed sought sanctification and that's what they believed and sanctification is still here sanctification is still producing sanctification seed there's still people that see the revelation of sanctification that's their religious experience you say well why don't they go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not in them to go on that's not what they were planted to do they're doing exactly what they were planed to do am I to say to the Potter why hast Thou made me thus or why have you made them thus that was him he wasn't going to do look justification still has to be there because sanctification is part of it the whole picture makes Christ Through the Ages you can't go chop this out chop this out chop this out and all of a say I hear I've got the seed no it's all part of the whole picture it's a whole part of the resurrection of the whole thing coming back to harvest life and then came [Music] restoration the baptism of the Holy Ghost the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of gifts and there was people there that receive that that's what they are that's what they believe there's God in that there's life in that there's life in justification there's life in San s ification that course as the life moved on but you know it's just like it says in the scripture if you would just read that one scripture uh in Matthew 32 uh 13:52 it's a great little scripture for those that that that love Bible study and Jesus said this in Matthew 1352 he says then he said unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed into the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasures things new and old it's all part of the treasure and then there was there's people that that's what they were planted here to do that's what they are they're they're here to to perform that and show that that's real and and if and and that God moved and the the gifts are restored it's all part of it and then there was a people that were planted to have an invisible Union with the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride to be United with the word of God a people that were planted to be that Capstone to have that love to possess that on that statue of the perfect man to come up through all those ages and kindly come to the place that that's what they have they possess that love of God that's what they were planted for they weren't planted to manifest the gifts they weren't planted to manifest sanctification they weren't planted to manifest justification though they're all my brothers they're all part of the plan they're all fulfilling their role it's just that's not what I was planted for that's not what's in me to be I can only be what I've been planted to be and the desire of the seed that is in me is the love of God that's the fruit I want to have I want that c Capone I want to know what it means to have that love in my heart that all those verbs of Charity is working in me I'm not puffed up I'm not vth not myself I'm not envious I thinketh no evil I speaketh no evil I revile not that that can become a reality to me amen that I don't I can't it doesn't matter I'm not going to fuss with you over doctor I'm not going to fuss with you you love God that's what you believe praise God you're my brother Jesus Christ died for you Jesus says if thou believe on the Son of God that man Lou says I don't even know who he is I was blind before I saw Jesus say well I'm the one oh was that reunion Hallelujah the Thanksgiving can you imagine the love that flowed between those two him just loving Jesus thank you Jesus and Jesus just loving him just so embraced him and what that he had done for him may I say it again so embraced so full of the love for what Jesus had done done for him that it just radiated in him thank you I was blind I never saw my mama's face I never saw my daddy I never saw the temple I had heard but now I see I believe that's what I'm planted for I believe with all my heart that the message that God put in my heart to preach to the people that God's given me to preach to is that that love comes by hearing the word of God and the hearing of the word of God comes through the voice of the seventh angel messenger in this day and that's where I want my emphasis if if you desire justification there's lots of places to go and live in justification if you desire sanctification there's lots of places to go to live in sanctification it's good you'd be blessed there they're good works they're good churches they do a lot of good works for the community they're fine people there's fine Pentecostal churches all over the land good people holy people most of them living a lot holier than a lot of message people live fervent to God deep in prayer that that's the way they worship God in speaking on tongues and interpretation of tongues and and it's wonderful there's nothing wrong with it in fact I I I I want you to know as soon as we get this next door open we'll have a place for any of you that feel you have gifts and you want to get together before service and pray and and bring a a message in tongues or an interpretation of tongues feel free to do it or if you have a prophecy and God gives you a prophecy I have prophecies that have written on my desk that I have right on my desk that that were brought to me and I performed that prophecy just the way it was brought to me because it was brought to me in the name of the Lord that the the the person that brought it never was a participation in it they never took part in the prophecy they brought the prophecy but they had no no part of the prophecy but yet it's here today if you have a prophecy gift of Prophecy we're here we'll be happy to read your Prophecy Before the church we'll be happy to read the interpretation of tongues before the church we're not taking any of it away but the one thing I do want is I want us to love the way he loved and I want us to love one another the way he loved us and I don't want us to gossip I don't want us to run down other churches I don't want us to run down other Ministries I don't want to be a fool and compare myself to others I want to live the word of God with the love of God in in my heart and that's what I'm going to preach and that's what I'm going to stand for because that's what I was made for and where others go it's not for me to judge what others do it's not for me to determine or to criticize they're my brothers and I'm a fan of anybody that makes a stand for this message they're way above the critics the people that don't identify with it is anybody perfect is any church perfect no neither is this one it's the most perfect church I know of it's the best people I know of it's the people that I love more but doesn't mean other people can't feel that way so the question is where's our emphasis this morning what's our goal I say the Capstone I say the love of God I say that we get our possession and it becomes our dearest most grateful possession we have and if I have this I have everything if I have love I have it all and I pray as they said John the Divine the old John Divine not our John divine said little children love one another little children love one another God bless you let's [Applause] stand do you love them this morning are musicians coming there's a great scripture I think every believer should run across their mind every day if you have not it's because you ask not do do you asking yourself this morning feel that you could have more love in your life less bitterness less criticism less [Music] fear you know doubt is the fruit of fear faith is the fruit of [Music] love and that's what you got to say to yourself this morning have I set it on the greatest thing of [Music] all that I could have God himself in me [Music] the Same Love wherein he loved the world maybe you could take it a step further this morning and say I believe that's what God planted me here for he didn't predestinate me to manifest other things from other ages or other times he's got people he's planted here to do that and they're doing it and they're doing a good job but he's put me here that I could be so one in an invisible Union with him that his love would be manifested in me that's what I've been planted for that's what I've been called to do I've been called to be the manifestation of that great Capstone in my [Music] life and it would be a desire in your heart it would be a desire that just cried out within you oh God I want that love I want to possess it I want to have it it's the greatest gift that you they give a Believer your son even prayed that that they might know how that you loved him that you loved us the same way Lord I pray that with all my heart this morning that you would allow that love to come into my life to cleanse me of all unrighteousness it's the victory over every habit it's the victory over every [Music] devil it's the power above all powers and I just ask that each of us this morning would examine our heart and say do I have that love and I hope you can say yes [Music] and then you would just say more Lord I would just want more of it I want it to reach deeper than farther than it's ever gone before I want it to fulfill every aspect of my life every circumstance everything Lord I want to be what you are I want to have that great love you feel that way as we sing this song would you just lift your heart to him and say Lord just let that come into my life I know when it does it's going to point out all my wrongs all my failures but that's okay Lord I'll do whatever it takes to have it [Music] I'll do whatever it takes father to possess it the kingdom of God is like a man that found a pearl of great price and sold all that he had that he might obtain it the kingdom of God is like a treasure found in the field the man went sold all that he had that he might purchase that land and take possession of that that field and Lord I'm willing to sell everything I have to take possession of the believer's greatest possession is your love shed abro in Me by your spirit the love of God greater fall [Music] then tongue [Music] or the highest and [Music] the Lord oh I was one of these the guilty P bow down [Music] with God gave his son [Music] to his air child he re and [Music] oh love of God [Music] how how [Music] me it for there [Music] more the I'd like just go to that last verse [Music] and on Earth and [Music] oh is your life right in the love of God to right the love of God [Music] [Applause] [Music] nor down [Music] the [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah it sh for more [Music] [Music] the amen before we dismissed if anybody needs prayer maybe you're sick in body maybe you have a challenge or a need and you would like prayer this morning I believe the love of God the love of the Saints can make a difference so we're always here to pray for you and and uh to help you along life's journey but one day we're going to leave this place anybody looking forward to that just think about it this old body is just going to fall off amen I need you you to keep me in prayer I I believe it's this Tuesday they're going to do surgery on my eye and um I've got some blood floating in my eye and they're going to uh go in there and I'm going to make this as morbid as I can make it they're going to stick a needle in my eye and they're going to suck all the fluid and all the blood out of my eye and then they're going to stick another needle in my eye and and that's a camera so they can see what they're doing and they're going to stick a third needle in my eye and they're going to put a laser in there and they're going to laser all the leaking blood pain and then they're going to fill my eye up with some other kind of fluid from someplace else until my eye can generate new fluid and I just want to let you know I'm just looking forward to that so much no I'm not but I know with the prayers of the saints that I'll get through it just fine and you know if my eye ends up single then maybe my whole body can be my light so I just asked you to pray for me and uh I just asked the doctor I said am you you make sure I'm out you know I want to visit the other side in the way of a vision so I don't I don't really want to be awake for that he said well you'll be out for 5 minutes I said well it better take three you know what I mean but you know it just they feel that's what they should do and I'm certainly not against doctors I feel maybe this is the way that God will help me I I've got fairly good Vision you know uh now that with this blood and this eye I'm 2025 I used to be 2020 I have one bad eye that I'm 20 3540 in but that's not the eyesight that I want to have I want to have the eyesight to see Jesus Christ Living in one another that's what I want to see and I want you to know this morning that if you need him he's here for you if you're not ready to meet him if you know that through some course of life that you would have to go before him and stand on your record and what you're doing would you be able to enter into the kingdom if not he's here this morning to wipe that record clean he's here to come and forgive you of your trespasses and he's willing to come into your life and lead you and guide you will you make mistakes will you fall yes but he'll be there to pick you up and dust you off and set you straight and give you the hope of everlasting life I would not want want to go through this world without the hope of everlasting life I wouldn't want to go through this life wondering whether or not I had a ticket I want to make sure the ticket's in my hand I want to make sure it's in my heart and I when I want to make sure when he calls me to that great meeting in the air that I know I'm going to be there because of my Works no because because of what he did because of his love for me and just don't
