Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you God that your grace has afforded us another day on earth, Lord. That oh God, we can make preparations to meet you, Lord.

Lord, we want to come here, Lord, to feast at your table, Lord, to receive food in due season, Father. And Lord, we want to be like, oh God, that woman, Lord, she had to get to Jesus, Lord. Though they had a great feast and Simon wanted to make fun, Lord, that's not why we're here, Lord. We want to do you a service, Lord. We want to take this stench off of you, Lord, that the world put the smud and tried to call this message, which is Christ, some filth. But oh God, we're here to testify and say, Lord, it's the life. It's the only life. It's the only hope. There's this is the only love, oh God. This is the only real peace, Lord, is what we found in you through this message, Lord, through your eternal promise.

We don't want to be the same person, Lord. When that woman did you that service, she was a different person, Lord. She came to the right place, Father. And that's what we believe this morning, Lord.

Praise the Lord. Amen. How many are happy to be in his presence this morning? Amen. Uh today is a special day and a very special one indeed. Amen. Amen. It's Sister Leslie's birthday. Amen. Amen. We certainly appreciate her. You know, she works behind the scenes very hard and and and you know, she never forgets anybody's birthday. Even if she does, she'll come right away and and let you know. And you know, I could say every one of our lives in this church has been touched by Sister Leslie and all that she does. and she's always behind the scenes and working things out to make sure everything goes okay. You know, I was thinking about that say they say behind every great man, there's a great woman. &gt;&gt; And man, she's really a type. And and I want to just say this. I know, you know, usually in settings like this, I know she's probably trying to disappear right now, but she's a very real type of what the bride is. Amen. The bride of Christ. That's what we're called to be. We certainly appreciate her. God bless you and happy birthday. Amen. Amen. Don't forget our meetings that are coming up. I know uh we just want to confirm the dates. It's November 14, 15, and 16. Um I know we usually have it on the second weekend and so there was a little bit of confusion. So it's the second full weekend, which is the 14th, 15th, and 16th of November. and we want to be praying about it and just do all that we can so that the Lord will come and and certainly visit us. Amen. Amen. I I I believe that it's uh every day we come to church is a special day. And and I'll say this, we we we we as believers of this message with the prophecies that we've been given, we we we have to come to a place where we don't take this for granted. &gt;&gt; We know these buildings are going to become warehouses. So we have to cherish every moment we gather together and know that it could be the last one. Who knows? So we want to put all of our effort not just for the meeting, even for the service this morning and say, "Lord, I have come and and I'm here so that your word can become a reality in my life." Amen. That's our heart's desire, man. I know we have many that went to the Louisiana meetings and some are traveling. We certainly want to remember them this morning. Um, sister Lori uh uh put in a request for brother Daniel's surgery. We just want to continue to lift her up in prayer. Brother Daniel, in prayer that the surgery will go well, that he may come out uh uh healed and well, that he may uh his strength may be restored and all of that. And if you have a need upon your heart, just lift your hand up to him. But Tim has some announcements to come and make this morning. So, we'll just have him uh uh come and give the announcements and pray for the request this morning. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Good morning. Good to see you from this side again. Um I reiterate uh happy birthday, Sister Lesley. Um yeah, I was thinking about that on my drive to and from work. I see a billboard and it says 45 years in ministry pastors and it gives the man's name and it gives the wife's name. They advertise that oh it's dual pastorship. We don't advertise that. But I can attest sometimes you see good in a man that's because his wife reminds him to be good. And I don't mean that just jokingly, but they're our helpmate. You know, I've got several Bibles and I was looking back. You see the green sticky and I know I'm up here to make an announcement, but just can't help myself. And uh one of my notes has on it, and I may have already said it, I don't know. So, what was Eve's maiden name? You ever thought about that? You know, every woman has to undergo a name change and it's difficult to get used to writing your name a certain way. You may not even like it, but that's part of it. Ease maiden name. Anybody have a gander at that? Think they know? I'd say it was Adam &gt;&gt; because she was part of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She is him. &gt;&gt; And I think each one of us bear a name and we are him. &gt;&gt; That's what we strive to be. I was thinking if I had a word of the day today, it would be vulnerability. I was thinking I was sharing with brother Andrew after he preached that message a couple weeks ago on Wednesday night about witnessing. A lot of times we don't witness because we're too vulnerable. We put our self out there. Think, "Oh, can I answer this question? Do I want this person to know what I stand for?" &gt;&gt; Sure, we want them to know. &gt;&gt; But Paul taught us says, "For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but he whom God hath commanded." &gt;&gt; And I think for each of us, we have a place in the body. It's not because we've wedged oursel in or we've taken control and gotten in. It's because he's placed us there. Let's own up to that, realize that, embrace that, and advertise that and get somebody else to fill in that little niche so far that may be still out there that has to be redeemed. Amen. and the vulnerability side of it. David in the psalm I read a couple weeks ago said, "Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for unto thee, Lord, do I lift up my soul." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The Lord knows our hearts. He knows our soul. But there's something that part of us as human beings. Brother Brandham called it that access in. We're free moral agents. We make that decision either to allow this in or that in. And there's something vulnerable about vulnerable about it. We lift up our souls to the Lord. It's an act, a conscious act to say, Lord, I want you to take control. And Jeremiah in Lamentations says, "Let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto the God of heaven." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's hard to imagine me taking my heart and lifting it up to the Lord. But when we yield ourselves and lift our hands, he has access, full and complete access. Let's give him that this morning. uh the advert or the the uh the announcement I want to make are concerning Sunday school and that is they're going to be on the 18th between 2 and 5. Everyone with young children is invited. If you're too young for Sunday school, you're still invited to come between 2 and 5. Uh there'll be lots of games, activities, and such that's going on. Uh we do ask that if you don't mind bringing the drink that your child likes, bring some drinks for yours and maybe someone else. We'll have some basics there, water and tea and such, but if you have anything special you want to just bring that and uh and there'll be plenty to eat and desserts all around. And also, you may have noticed there's a big uh whatever you want to call it, sister call it amazing. There's a maze over here in the back that we've constructed. Considerable amount of effort and time involved. And there's stakes in the ground. We just want you to be careful and leave that children, parents alike, leave that by itself. Let's not even get close to it. And uh I was told to threaten you, but uh like, hey, you wouldn't be able to participate on Saturday if we see you in the maze, but uh please respect anything as you know, Wednesday night service. We'll probably have some more things up stage back there. So, we're uh looking forward to a good day and we want to make sure you aware that please stay away for now. Um I think that's about it. I've got it covered. All right. So, let's just if we would let's stand yield ourselves. We are we're free moral agents and we want to give our our conscious effort to enter in and allow the Lord to do what he has to do this morning. Let's bow our heads. A gracious and kind heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, once again for the assembly of this body together. Lord, we pray that we can come in one mind, one accord, Lord, for we're in your presence. We're in your spirit, Lord. Lord, you can cast down all reasoning, all fears, anything that would hinder your movement. Lord, we ask Lord, you just take away now, Lord, that we may put our faith into the things that have been mentioned here, Lord, upcoming surgeries and oh, even lost loved ones. We think of the little burned child, Lord. Many things that we have need of that we just place on your throne, Lord. Lord, truly we lift up our spirits, our souls, our even our health and our strength, Lord, we ask you just to renew us, Lord, for having been in your presence today, Lord. And when your word comes forth, Lord, that's what we're here for is to gain benefit, honor, and glory unto you, Lord, that we can accept your word and apply it to our lives and make an eternal difference. We pray, Lord, that all this would have its effect, Lord. Lord, as we continue to sing these songs, Lord, just prepare us that ground, Lord. Just till us up, make us fertile so when the word comes forth, Lord, it can fall and just water the seed that's on the inside. Grant it, oh Lord. Lord, just use the tithes and offerings we collect for your honor and your glory. As we look to you to provide for everything we have need of, and we ask and believe these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And may I quickly add uh that's my brother that's going to be going in for surgery. He had a some sort of procedure of myogram. They put die in your system injected in your spine and look and I believe the Lord is already on the scene answered prayer. He was he's so uh damaged or messed up from years. Uh he had previous surgeries, but he's had a lot of collapsed disc and and things. They were going to have to go from the inside obviously take all of his internals out, access it, flip him back over, and then go from the back also. But the procedure showed that they can do everything from the back. So, we're thankful for that. And I think the Lord is already answering prayers. So, we we do coveret your prayers in that regard. Lord bless you, [Music] man. You may be seated. Oh, what gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer. There is no more from heaven now to give him. He is my joy, my righteousness and free. Oh, and my steadfast love, my deepest, boundless peace. Oh, and to this I hope. My hope is only Jesus. Oh, my life is bound to. Oh, I strange in the mind. I can see all is mine yet through Christ in me. Oh, and I cannot forsake. Oh, and for by my side he will stay. Oh my go [Music] for in my knees. His power is the way to this I [Music] will defend me through the heers valley [Music] and I shall overcome [Music] by the cross lead me. Oh, and no f I. Oh, I know I am forgiving. For the future sure the price he has been paid for Jesus and suffer on God. Oh and any of the great. Oh, and to this I s have been defeated. Jesus now and ever. [Applause] All the chains are released [Music] by me. Oh, and with every breath. Oh, I long to follow Jesus. For he has said, oh, and I he me. Oh, and I know he will be. Oh, until I stand with before. &gt;&gt; Oh, and to thee I [Music] hope Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, and all the glory to him. When the praise is still my shall not just sing that last one again to this I oh and to this I my hope is only Jesus all the glory and True. When the race is complete, still I live shall be yet through Christ in me. There is a soul singing times of need. that gives me hope. Oh, and that brings me peace in every trial. Oh, and to every test. Oh, and my Savior stand mighty. And when the road you walk, leave you tight and hold. All your strength is gone and your heart feels strong to remember God is greater than your stories. [Music] Oh th [Music] my hand. Oh as I should falter and make me stand. Oh out on the water. Oh, when the road you take you tight and hold and all your strength is gone. Oh, and your heart feels so [Music] take her [Music] sing. Oh, and when the waters cry. Oh, and he calls my name. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my f. And he makes me stand out on the water. [Music] If you tight and warm, all your strength is and your heart feels strong. Remember, God is gater. [Music] Take the battle. Amen. Father, we're glad the battle's yours. &gt;&gt; Father, we're glad that you love us, that you loved us so much you sent your only begotten son. &gt;&gt; And Father, that he's the way, the truth, and the life. And no man comes unto you, Father, but by him. And father, may that revelation grow deeper in our heart and may we understand what the challenge for each of us is in the hour that we live in. Father, our our young people and the live in a day that many of us have never seen. Father, what's presented to them and what's they're up against? Father, when I was young, there was three television stations, ABC, NBC, and CBS, and that was it all. But now, Father, there's so much. We need you to be more strong and powerful in our lives than ever before. Help us meet the challenge of the hour. We ask these things this morning. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. We have several out over in the meetings in Louisiana and we certainly trust that they have a wonderful time. And and uh I uh I also um Leslie told me this morning she says you can't announce my birthday without telling everybody it's Magna's birthday and Claudia's birthday also. So we definitely want to uh recognize uh them and and their birthday. And uh I like what brother Tim said, you know, sometimes you just got to have somebody that keeps you straight. And uh so she works full time. Uh believe me, and uh so I of course I appreciate her, but uh we'll go. I'm not going to sing a special if you thinking that uh we're going somewhere this morning. Uh they look at me. Are you going to sing? No. No, I'm not gonna sing. I I'm not a very good singer, but um uh uh we love the Lord. So, uh brother uh Tim, they built a maze out there and they worked all day long making working on that maze out there. So, we want we don't want all the young kids to run up there and tear it down before it's uh built. So, uh you just do your best. I was the one that told them to threaten them. I said, "If they get in that maze, they're not going to go there next week." And he looked at me like, "You, no, Brother McGary, that's an idol threat." But so we won't threaten you. We just ask you to be good and stay true. Now, if you have grandchildren, uh you can certainly come out to our thing next week. Um if you're an old person, you can come out. We just wanted to draw the distinction that it's not a young people's event like teenagers and stuff like that. It's for the Sunday school and all the kids and family um members younger. So, uh we're going to uh just kind of go forward this morning and in fellowship around the word of God. And um so as you stand, so I don't mean to have you stand instead, but if you uh stand, we're going to read a few scriptures and um um this morning and fellowship around God's word. And I I'd like to read this statement. I thought it was um uh an outstanding um Let me see if I brought it out with me. I think I did. Um, but I thought this was quite an approach. It said, "I want to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten enlighten to you the promises of God for this age. Not something that somebody else was in some other day, but something when them things are all right. We refer to those things. But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I've got written here that would enlighten you to know what to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now. And so I thought that's kind of where my heart is this morning to bring us some enlightenment to where that we are now and what we're fighting now. And um that statement was from Satan's Eden. And there's also something else I thought was nice and is and I think if we can get this little part of this to us, it says, "So God knew that we would be here, but when he put us in the flesh so we could be contacted, so God knew you would be here." Right here. Yes. &gt;&gt; In this age, in this time, and he put you here so that he could contact you. And I think that's the part that we kind of leave out a lot. God is longing to contact us. So, if we have our Bibles, let's turn to Matthew. Um, and we're and this is the 10th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. And I and to read uh uh verse 32 and 33 it says wherefore no 3 uh 2 says whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven. Now this is a a very tremendous verse. We won't labor on it long. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth. I come not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foe shall be they of his own household. For he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless your word to us this morning. You may be seated. We'd also like to turn over to uh two scriptures found one in the beginning of Galatians and this is uh Galatians uh 1 through uh 4. It says, "I, Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead, and all the brethren which are with me unto the church of Galatia. Grace be to you and peace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. who he gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world. And then also we'd like to read over in the fourth uh chapter of the book of second Corinthians. And it says here it says, "Therefore, seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy and faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. The God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not. Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ whom is the image of God should shine unto them. Amen. We hear two references here uh this morning. And one is the God of this present evil world. And also we we hear the reference uh here of the God, the God of this world and this present evil. So if we just looked at those scriptures, we're living in an evil age that we might be delivered from this evil age. And then the scripture tells us that there's a God of this evil age. And we read that the we wanted to preach the gospel uh for the battle that we're in. And it when this gets established in our hearts that we're in a battle that life is a a battle. It's a constant warfare. And uh Paul wrote it in the scriptures this way. He says, "Satan's like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour." Now, we don't want to look at that. You know, we it there's a part of us that doesn't want to face reality. And so, Satan has given us a lot of reality escape outlets. Uh uh ways to escape reality. Uh you know, the sports world is a big uh reality uh escape world. you know, everybody will be rooting for their team and and there's all kinds of people out at the game and they're screaming and hollering and tailgate partying and they carry on. I mean, and you somebody's going to win and lose, you know, and then all week long they're going to want to fire the coach and get rid of the owner and and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And it starts all over again next week. And then they lose and it's next year and you know and and they they crown a champion and oh he's the champion of the world and and they they won this thing and that thing and this Super Bowl and and all that and it's it's uh it's just it's it's an escape &gt;&gt; from the reality &gt;&gt; if you can fill yourself with so much stuff in your mind that you don't want to look at the reality that we're living in. And because it it because it's what Jesus said. He said, "I didn't come, you know, to bring peace, but I've came to bring a sword. There's going to be a variance. There's going to be a difference. uh I'm going to separate fathers from mothers and and daughters. And he's not talking about maybe so much individual families, but as he's looking out, he's looking out and he's seeing he says that there's there's a going to be a great cultural difference and and people want to be successful. Uh, you know, uh, people will take their, uh, child and they'll get him a tutor and they'll go hire him a baseball coach and they'll they'll put them in some sort of high league or they'll get him a computer. Everything that they can do to get their child ahead in the world, &gt;&gt; they'll they'll preach education uh, trying to get them more educated. uh more into science more more so that they can uh maybe obtain a better way of life and and and wealth and and and in one sense they're teaching them to build their treasures up here on earth, you know, have a better life on earth, have money, have a a you know, have a retirement program, buy a house, drive a a car, you know, and this great push for for for prosperity and and not to be, you know, and uh here comes one that didn't even have a place to lay his head. You know, he's not talking about success in this world. He's talking about the fact of the matter that there's a life after this world that that this world is not our home. This is not our kingdom. In fact, it it's not even our Eden. &gt;&gt; It's Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; But this is what he he developed civilization that he he told Eve, he deceived Eve. He told her, "If you eat of this fruit, you know, you'll increase. You'll have knowledge and wisdom and you'll increase and and you'll you'll be like God's." And and men's like gods. They they create things. They uh they don't create I I shouldn't have used that word. There's only one creator. But they'll take elements of mathematics and and these uh all these uh scientific things to try to make life better and and and and delve into space and and and shoot rockets to the moon and and aren't you all glad that somebody walked on the moon? You know, I I I didn't I I didn't get one thing out of them walking on the moon, you know, but it's the accomplishment of man. We put a man on the moon. What is that to give you? Expectations of what else they can do. But this it's it's deceitful &gt;&gt; and and this you know and every answer that for every age is already written in the Bible for the believer in that age. every answer for every age is already written in the Bible for the believers of that age. And you know, I was struck to find out, you know, I always thought that I don't have my phone with me. I don't preach with a tablet. I'm I'm not like these guys that could actually I don't trust them. Okay? You know what I mean? But but how many adults play video games? You know, I've been living in the dark ages. I thought that was something like the junior high kids did. You know what I mean? And and there's a whole industry of people that write programs so adults can sit around and and and they'll live in there. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Oh, I've got, you know, I killed 20,000 soldiers in conquest of of the planet of apes or something like that. I mean, you you can't hardly even get it across to people how deceptive this age is. We are living in the most deceptive age of every time there ever was. &gt;&gt; It it it it's almost there's there's so much that's going on, so much that's hidden, so so many spirits at work because so much battle in in the mind of believers. The the whole purpose o of the enemy in the very beginning was to exalt himself above God's angels and his stars and to put himself on the throne of God that he could be worshiped as God. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be the God of this age. And Paul comes back and he says, "Through Jesus Christ, who by his grace has delivered us from the God of this evil age." And and so you say, "Well, why are you you up here uh preaching this morning?" You know, yeah, I'm not motivated by the popularity and I'm not motivated by by the finances, but what I am motivated by is the truth. because there's there there there's nothing as he wrote here that is to be enlightened and you know my testimony that I I I grew up in the 60s so I I was in that rebellious age you know where where you you were against society you were against the war you were against the government and you wanted to be peace peace and and love and beads and and uh you know he psychedelics and and and smoking pot and and oh that was the life you know leather sandals and let your hair grow long. you know, and go down to the beach and and and you know, the less you could do, the happier you were, you know, just veg out, listen to music, you know, and and then you and oh, and you know what it was? It m remember it was a lie. &gt;&gt; It was It's not the truth. But by the enlightenment of divine revelation that God gave Isab and I I I I stopped a moment and uh I just I I I I took a moment and I I I stopped and Uh, and just if if I could say it that way and just looked around really what was going on. There was people taking too much drugs. There was people getting addicted to heroin. There was people getting addicted to cocaine. All those peace and loving people that I thought surrounded with me were stealing my albums. They were stealing my money. They were stealing my food. I went away for a week, came back to my own house, and there was a great big bunch of people in there cuz one of my friends invited his friends who, you know, it became a place they could run to, flop out, hide, you know. And I I walked in my own house and the guy come up to me. He says, "Hey, dude. I I don't think the guy would would want you to be here. I said, "Wait a minute, man." You know, and what was God doing &gt;&gt; opening my eyes? You know what's what's really this isn't really peace, love, and joy. I was getting depressed. I was getting suicidal. uh go you know what I mean all this there was no peace there was no joy there was no longsuffering you know nobody wanted to care for anybody it was every man for themselves &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and the reality of that there the when I had to face the reality of it I came to a place where I didn't want to go on anymore because I didn't know where to go. I didn't know there was another life. I didn't know that I found that my present reality was death. Because the wages of sin is death. The result of unbelief is death. If our gospel be hid, it is hid from them that are lost. And it was striking to find out that I was lost. Boy, I thought I was in control. I thought I had the world by its horns. I I thought I knew what the answer was. You know what I mean? Tune in, drop out. That was a wow, I've found life. But when your eyes are opened that that that is not the path that it's the it's a road to destruction and your eyes are open and you see that you had to face that and I I was to a place I had to face the fact that I didn't know where I was who I was. I started hanging around with people that were a whole lot more evil than I realized people could be. And I thought, who was so cool? I realized how naive and lost and vulnerable that I was and that I wasn't in control at all. I was being carried down the stream of life by spirits. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there was a host of spirits that were released from the pits of hell that were getting on people. And he was putting his spirits on people for his kingdom. The God of this evil age was getting people to do his bidding, his work while he was building his kingdom and exalting himself through science, education, politics, civilization, and all the stuff that he produced from the tree of knowledge that man was eating off of as fast as they could get. getting knowledge, getting uh the ways to make more money, ways to have greater businesses. They're feasting on on all this stuff he keeps providing for them, not realizing that he's just feeding you a little bit along the way to get you go to down the the the the trail like Hansel and Gretle. &gt;&gt; No, that's not in the Bible. Don't go looking up Hansel and Gretle in the Bible. It's a story about a witch &gt;&gt; who put out breadcrumbs to lead people into captivity. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan's done. &gt;&gt; He's put out breadcrumbs. What he did to Eve, put out a breadcrumb. You said, "Oh, if you eat this, this is the result." No. The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. The the deception. Well, I you know, I was lost. But I tell you one thing, a friend of mine who was no no more interested in God or anything, he he looked at me and he he said it jokingly and mockingly. Oh, why don't you read the Bible? Duh. Well, I was desperate, so I went and read Romans chapter 1. And here he's describing the world, truth breakers, incontinents, liars. Not wishing to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind. In other words, having rejected the truth. God gave them over to imaginations, burning in their own lust, doing that which is unseemingly, leaving the natural use of the woman, man with man, woman with woman, doing those things which are unseemingly. actually describing the condition of people that reject the truth. &gt;&gt; That's what happens. He's the god of this evil age. He's the he he it spirits o of deceit. So I I Satan just putting tons of financial pressure on the believer. But you know something, if you're a believer, that's what it comes down to. because he said, "If you're a you don't confess me before men, I'll not confess you before my father." Now, it's hard in this day when you confess somebody you're saying, "I believe what he's saying to be the truth." My confession is his confession. He said that a righteous man should not break bread. &gt;&gt; Now that's something when you start confessing that he said look at the little sparrows which are the scriptures right before those. He doesn't sow. He doesn't heal. Yet his father in heaven takes care of him. How much greater are you than them? Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look at the liies of the field. They neither toil nor or nor or sow, &gt;&gt; but yet they're they're afraid. Their their glory is even greater than that of the the kingdom of Solomon." &gt;&gt; What's he trying to get to us? He's trying to break the deception that is sitting in our minds that Satan has been sewing out there trying to keep us from putting the mind of Christ in our mind. &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to keep from the church. He's trying to keep the mind of God's word from the church by offering deceptions. Now, there's nothing worse than deception. I I I was talking with brother Tim. I said, "You sure there's a way out of here?" &gt;&gt; Can you imagine him building a maze with no way out? Once you get in, you're trapped &gt;&gt; because he put one wrong turn up or one barrier and you got in and there's no way out. That's the devil. That's what he's done. He's got people to a place where there's no way out. And then he convinces them that their problems are so great and so bad and so deep that there's no way out. But yet we know there's a way out &gt;&gt; because the scripture tells us the truth is what sets you free. The truth is what sets you free. And so we are in the most deceptful, evil age there's ever been. &gt;&gt; In fact, we are living in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; God created his Eden 2,000 years ago. No death, no sickness, no graves. No mental problems, &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; It was perfect. &gt;&gt; He would come down in the cool of the evening and walk with them. &gt;&gt; But the deceiver came, begile Eve into putting a different thought in her mind. other than the word of God, a different way of thinking. Now, let me tell you something. And I'm not against ignorance and I'm not against school, but don't you let them put thinking in your mind that leaves God out of the picture. &gt;&gt; Because all they're trying to put you is make you a society servant &gt;&gt; to serve them so they can get richer, they can have more money, they can have more power. And who is their God? Who is their leader? Who who is the prince of this world? It is the devil. &gt;&gt; And people don't even think there's a devil anymore. &gt;&gt; They they you have no idea when you wake up that somebody while you were sleeping was plotting all night h how to do something to hurt you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Well, either you're going to believe this or you're not. It comes down to the word of God. To them that believe, it's life. To them that don't believe, it's death. But c how long does man have to go? How much fruit of evil do they have to reap until they realize, "Hey, this isn't working." You think education's done anything for our country? Yeah. We are so smart in the United States. We have finally come to the fact that we don't know what a man is or what a woman is. &gt;&gt; That's brilliance. That's nuts. Yeah. Somebody's running for office. They're going to have free housing, free food, free transportation. Well, who doesn't want to have free everything? &gt;&gt; The only thing that's free was paid for. &gt;&gt; There's nothing free. &gt;&gt; But deception, &gt;&gt; lies are free. Truth changes things. The acceptance of truth causes separation. The acceptance of truth when you face the truth of the matter. You got to separate yourself from the lie. It's just it's just what it is because truth set you free from the deception. That's why father was going to be against son and mother against daughter because they accepted different truths. They're looking through different eyelasses. Could you imagine in Israel when a daughter come in and her father is the rabbi steeped in the law in every traditions she's brought up just like just to be so obedient and to do everything and to wash the pans and everything. And one day she comes in, she says, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah." &gt;&gt; You think that was fun? I'm not going to go down there to that temple. I'm going to go over and listen to Peter speak. That was heresy. That was blasphemy. They were expelled. They were kicked out. I'll tell you, if you ever get a chance, get Sister Abby to tell you her testimony. I'll tell a little bit for you. I don't know if you're here. Sister Abby, are you here? Oh, good. She's not here. Gives me a little freedom, doesn't it? She didn't want to cut her hair. She's a teenager. She heard the gospel. God put it on her heart not to cut her hair. She comes from an Indian culture where obedience to your father and so she wouldn't cut her hair and all her her father's friends and the church and everybody called her rebellions. But she found a truth. You know what she had? She had a revelation. Her eyes were opened up that a woman shouldn't cut her hair and she believed it. And she was beaten. Not spanked. She was beaten. taken out and beaten with, I believe, a stick or some rod of some sort. And I remember when she told me, she said, "You know, the most thing I couldn't believe." She said, "All the time my father was beating me, alls I could feel in my heart was love for him." That's what the word of God does. when your eyes are opened and you see what is at stake. So we're here we are in the most decept there ever was. I know so many people think this president's so great. This president is a devil like every other president in this world is. He is not leading us closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In fact, the truth of the matter is they're all turning to Christianity. They're all saying, "But it's not the real word of God. It's not real Christianity. It's not really the faith. &gt;&gt; It's It's not It It isn't. Again, I just sit there and they and here they are. Their their hair is all bobbed off and they got all kinds of stuff on, you know, whatever it is. And and you know, the scripture says a woman shouldn't cut her hair. She should be silent in its objection to her husband. And you know, they're right out there and they just breathe the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Oh, we're the ones. We've got Jesus. Vote Republican. Jesus is a Republican. &gt;&gt; Well, don't you get that in your head? There is no truth in politics. &gt;&gt; It is a deception. &gt;&gt; It causes people to hate one another. &gt;&gt; The fruit of its hate. &gt;&gt; They'll use race car, they'll use economics, they'll use everything, anything. But we are not of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not a religion. &gt;&gt; We are a people. &gt;&gt; We are the offspring of our father in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who put our names on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. We we're we're not believing something that's going to get us there. We've had a revelation that we're not of this kingdom. &gt;&gt; We're not in this evil age. And we're not subject to the powers and the spirits and the demons of this evil age. We are called out. We're elected. We're chosen. We're different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That might be easier for me. Like I said, when I grew up, we had three television channels. Well, you'd go crazy. ABC, NBC, and CBS. If you ever go down and visit Johnson Ranch outside of Austin, what I forget what president of the number he was. He had three televisions because that's where every bit of information came from. Now you poor young people, you've got so much deception, so much confusion &gt;&gt; coming your way, so much fear put on you. And all they in every bit of it, all it's trying to do is all what modernism does is it makes old fashion. Just trying to turn us into old antiques. You're just an antique, you know, some sort of old school. That ain't the way the gospel is preached anymore. Now it's modern. You know what I mean? That's just, you know, to sing down at the cross. Who sings down at the cross anymore? You know, give me holy water. You ought to hear some of this rock and roll Christian stuff that's out there. It It's demonic, &gt;&gt; you know. Oh, but the words are so good and the beat is so fine. Who do you think runs music? &gt;&gt; It's a deception. &gt;&gt; You understand? You understand what you young people have got to do? You've got one time in your life. I like the way the prophet of God put it. He put it like this. He said, he's talking about deception. He says, "Last week in Matthew 24, it was almost the most deceiving age of all ages." All the ages of deceit from the Garden of Eden all the way down. There's never been an age as deceitful as this age. You understand? the whole age, &gt;&gt; everything is lying to you. &gt;&gt; It's trying to make you servants of their fashion, servants of their products, buyers of their things. You know, they're always trying to get there's something out there that's going to make your heart work better. It's going to make your hair grow. It's going to make the wrinkles get out of your face. You know what I mean? Lie, lie, lie. &gt;&gt; They don't work. &gt;&gt; It's vanity. &gt;&gt; Put something on you that stretches your skin. You know, it dries you up and you up, &gt;&gt; right? But when you wash it off, you've stretched that skin &gt;&gt; and now it starts to flop all of it. &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture says, the answer says the latter state is worse than the first state. &gt;&gt; They'll give you pills to give you calm you down and comfort. And if you're you're bipolar, &gt;&gt; well, if you ever get born again &gt;&gt; and you take the word of God as your absolute, &gt;&gt; then you you don't worry about the lie. &gt;&gt; But you want to know what bipolar is? It's a spirit over here and spirits over here. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this one's talking to you and you don't know whether it's truth or not. And this one's talking to you. Your conscience is talking to you. The psychiatrist says, "Well, what you need to do is get rid of your conscience. &gt;&gt; Take this, take that. You'll get rid of your conscience. You won't have that spirit bothering you no more that tells you you need to change. that the world's lying to you, that it's a big deception. &gt;&gt; Here, lay on the couch and I'll and and tell me what did your daddy do to you. It's not daddy. It's not mommy. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to mess you up. It's what he does. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what he does. How come 50% of marriages in the United States fail? Because a girl thinks this is Prince Charming. He's the one, you know, when he's got a forkid tongue. And guess what? When you start to get together, it's it's not what you thought it was. &gt;&gt; It's not This isn't the way it was in my romance novel. &gt;&gt; No, it's a lie. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that can really make a marriage work in this day is that's two people that love this word. And when they have when they have conflict, they go to prayer, &gt;&gt; they they they take the Christian side. &gt;&gt; Husbands, be not angry with your wives, for they are the weaker vessels. Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave his life for him. &gt;&gt; You know what about Okay, I'm sorry. If you want to go that, fine. No problem. Go ahead, dear. You know, if they're a Christian, they'll come to the realization. Their eyes will be open. They'll understand. &gt;&gt; If their spirit's not right, you've got the Holy Spirit working on your behalf. Say, "Father, we we're we're on some ground here. I need your help." &gt;&gt; He's the best marriage counselor in the world. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit A &gt;&gt; lot of people come in my office, we sit down, what are you going to talk about? Right? You know what it always gets back to &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; It always gets back to one of the two parties is not being a Christian. &gt;&gt; Well, I think the wall ought to be yellow. Well, I don't like yellow. Wait a minute. If your wife wants a yellow wall, paint it yellow. &gt;&gt; She's there all the time. Forget it. You can live with that. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel like I'm in control. Let him be in control. &gt;&gt; Let him do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; I I'll be honest with you. You can't me I don't even think me and Leslie have had two fights in our life. You say, "Why not?" Because she won't fight. If if the temperature starts to rise off, she goes, "I go in to see." And there she is on her in her chair reading her Bible. I think I'm not going to deal with this. You know, I mean, she done bypass me. &gt;&gt; She went to the top. &gt;&gt; And I know any minute now, I'm going to get my orders. &gt;&gt; My eyes are going to be opened. And I'm going to realize what a dunce I was and and how out of place I was and and how that I needed to be in prayer and I need to say I'm sorry. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; There's no need for it. &gt;&gt; You know why it is people fall for the deception? &gt;&gt; The women want more life. They want more this. They want more of that. It's a lie. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. So until our eyes recognize the day that we're living in and its message and that we're living in a deceitful age will have problems and young people, you're trying to navigate this world and all these voices. It's not till you realize these voices are lying to you. They're lying to you. You know, to think that everybody's got to be skinny is a lie. I'll guarantee you when we get to heaven, there's not going to be a person up there under 300 lb. Wouldn't that blow this world to pieces? All jolly and round and happy. Just walking through the garden, eating the fruit, you know, just whoa, beautiful. How are you, brother? Fine. [Applause] It's a lie. It's a lie. I'm on every live longer drug and program there is. And when I come to my appointed time, when God's decided and knew in advance he's going to take me, I'm going to hold up all these bottles and I'm saying, "I took all this stuff, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't take me. I took super beats. I took collagen. I took this and that. But you want to know something? If God wants to take you, there's not enough hospitals and doctors and pills to keep you here. But if God wants you here, there's not enough sicknesses or devils or or things to take you. &gt;&gt; We've got to start facing the deception. &gt;&gt; And recognize the deception. As I was reading, he says, he says, "Hey, evil, it's impossible deceive." He said, "False prophets will rise up, show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elect." See, now just a cold, formal, starchy church and so forth, a man-made theology that wouldn't the elect wouldn't pay no attention to that. But it's up there almost like the real thing. Science, education, almost up there like the real thing. Just leave one word is all you have to do. Promised of the age. Just leave off one word that was due. You know what one of the promises of this age is? Is the revelation of the son of predition. The eyeopening of the believer in revelations 3:14. I shall give you eyes that thou mayest see. &gt;&gt; That is a promise of this age that you will see the deception. You can't navigate through darkness and lies and and false advertisement and what your websites are. There's a website now I was reading about that you can send your picture and they'll grade you whether you're a 10 or a seven or a five or a six. That's nuts. And then they'll say, "What are you?" Well, I'm I'm only a five. In whose eyes? &gt;&gt; In whose eyes? I might be an ugly as a mud fence in this world, but the Bible tells me I'm glorious in his sight. My beauty is in my nature. &gt;&gt; Why have a beautiful body that's going to be destroyed by worms? The worms that's in you. It's not what God's getting. That's not what last. I'm going to get my new 300 pound body when I get over there. But until you face the deception, &gt;&gt; until you start realizing that all this social media, all this music, all this boyfriend, girlfriend junk that goes on, all that worrying about a mate and all worrying about your future is nothing but the stress &gt;&gt; and the spirits of this world trying to destroy your soul. and that Jesus Christ is the answer. And when you accept the truth of his age, for this age, that God sent you something to guide you through this deception, when you can accept that with all your heart and lean to it, you will find out that it will provide a path of light to you, a peace to you, a joy to you, a comfort to you. And you find out that he's got a mate for you. He's got a place for you. He's got a will for you. &gt;&gt; But until you withstand Satan, &gt;&gt; he won't flee. &gt;&gt; But once you call him out, &gt;&gt; once you say you're not going to lie to me, &gt;&gt; and you know what he is, &gt;&gt; and he's exposed, He don't come into your house &gt;&gt; no more. &gt;&gt; But as I was reading, he says, he said, not some man-made theology that wouldn't the elect wouldn't never pay no attention to that, but it's there's almost something real thing. Just leave out one word you have to do. Promise to this age. It's a very great time, Christians everywhere. Take heed to the hour we're living. Mark down and read and listen close. Mark it down. &gt;&gt; What's happening to young people? &gt;&gt; You know how many young people deaths there are now? &gt;&gt; What? the other day a homecoming, right? 14 people in a young man that was in one of our young people's services. A loving dad trying to get him at Christian fellowship. His heart trying to turn towards the Lord, trying to make a move from God, trying to get out of the world of deception. Shot dead. They're shooting themselves to death out there. &gt;&gt; You call that life? You call that the world? They're bullying one another, shaming one another, making people feel little and distraught. They're taking drugs by the thing. Look at the Look at them. They're drunk driving deaths. Teenagers crashing on the road. get getting drunk. Look at the fruits. &gt;&gt; Look at Look at the deception. It isn't a great glorious life. &gt;&gt; Teenage suicides are higher than they've ever been. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're buying into the deception. Don't buy into the deception. You look in the mirror and think, just think, God made me. &gt;&gt; God made me. &gt;&gt; I like that little thing that they used to wear. The kids used to wear it. I thought it was kind of good. He said, "God don't make junk." Now, I don't know what Max Factor wants to do. I mean, one day you're if you got big lips and next day you did skinny lips and you got big eyebrows and then skinny eyebrows and long lashes then short lashes. What are they doing? They're just stealing your money. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said dish soap was the biggest fraud around. you know, just took two squirts. And they show the little remember that that commercial that little soap goes down there and works its way over to your dishes and all of a sudden all the dirt falls off your dishes and everything and oh my. He says, "Honey, I'm going to wash the dishes." He gets a pan full of water and he goes squirt squirt and walks in there and sits down. She says, "I thought you were going to wash the dishes." They're being washed. You know lie. Just a lie. And you know he goes back and that stuff didn't do nothing. Guess what he had to do. had to wash dishes. &gt;&gt; You know how you wash dishes? You wash dishes. &gt;&gt; You know what we do? We add a dishwasher. We wash the dishes before we put them in the dishwasher. Leslie, some a a lady comes helps Leslie clean the house every couple weeks. What do you think she does before she comes? She cleans the house. I said, "What are you doing?" "Well, I'm my housekeeper's coming tomorrow." "Well, let her do it. Let her clean it." I spilled crumbs on the floor. I say, "She'll be here next week. That's her job. What I'm trying to point to is our minds are way out of whack. &gt;&gt; There's too much stuff in our minds, too much thinking, too much garbage. We need to come back to God's word. &gt;&gt; Back to being a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to close now. I never did get to what I was preaching. So most deceptive age, why did he put you here in the most deceptive age? Why is he going to call out a people for his name's sake in the most deceptive age there ever was? Now, this is what I hope I can get to to especially teenagers and you in your early 20s and that are going through all these things. Why me? Why now? Why do I got to put up with all this? Why is my mind so full of so many things? Why is it so hard for me? And there's a reason. And when you can see the deception and then see the reason, when you can understand, wait here, I was put here. I I I don't know why he put me coming to him in in the late 60s, but that's the time he chose to open my eyes and to have me make a choice. He I don't know why he put you here now, but he did it. You're here. You got one choice. Believe the lie. Don't not Don't not accept the truth because of your parents. That's what he said. Well, I don't like my dad's religion. I don't like the way he yells at me. I don't like the way he enforces it. You know, I I remember when I lived in Flag and the message was first starting. Well, the the people just came to the message. Now they're taking their pants off their daughters and and you know, they're in high school and the dad's all of a sudden, you can't wear pants. And so they put on a skirt, but it's got to be a long skirt. So what do you think they're doing? They're walking down the street, going to the gas station, pinning up their skirts, going to school. School's out. They drop their skirt down and they come home and daddy's happy. Oh, he got them to abide abide by the law. They don't go out, you know, they don't they don't act like they got a boyfriend or nothing, but man, school's out. They're jumping in the car with the guy and they're going down there and they're coming back and they get back to school and they get on the bus and they come back and daddy's happy. Looks like they're doing everything just according to the rules. &gt;&gt; You know, daddy forgets there's a devil. &gt;&gt; Mama forgets there a devil. As long as they making life easier for me, &gt;&gt; that ain't how it works. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not until &gt;&gt; that young girl comes to the place, the only reason they want me to dress in tight clothes is so they can lust after me. &gt;&gt; The only reason they want me to wear high heels is so my body moves in a way that they can lust after me. They can look at me. They can see my form and commit adultery with it. When you realize that's the truth, &gt;&gt; when you realize that guy that's trying to talk to you and kiss you and take you out on a date, he's got one thing on his mind, &gt;&gt; and that's to steal your innocence from you. &gt;&gt; He's an animal. If he's not born again &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is not controlling his appetite, he's after you for one reason. &gt;&gt; And that's the gospel &gt;&gt; and that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And I don't care how you butter it up. They can sit right in this church. If they're not born again, they're still after your body. and that's all. &gt;&gt; All they do is just keep feeding you and leading you. You know what the Bible calls it? Seduction. &gt;&gt; You got to face that. &gt;&gt; We can't pretend like it don't exist. You just can't pretend. &gt;&gt; You got to get back to reality. Revelation is reality. &gt;&gt; They try to make revelation intellectual faith, but revelation is Isaav. And I give you Isaav that thou mayest see. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation of God's word is saf. &gt;&gt; It lets you realize this depression devil has no right in my life. &gt;&gt; This this negativity has no right in my life. &gt;&gt; He that is in me is greater than he who is in the world. I am not going to let this thing rule my life. I am not going to have my happiness taken. I am going to be content in whatever state I am. God's my maker. He controls my life. He's the fountain of my blessing. I don't need Satan in my life. &gt;&gt; And all the time he's appearing as an angel of light. &gt;&gt; I'll guide you right to hell, &gt;&gt; to misery, &gt;&gt; to depression, &gt;&gt; to divorce. That's where he goes. We let the law of the message start ruling our lives instead of the spirit &gt;&gt; of God's word. &gt;&gt; He came to to us to guide us in spirit and truth. Now, why God had a reason for letting it get as bad as it is? And it's ugly, brother Jerome. Do you ever think it could get this ugly? Do you ever think people could hate one another the way they hate one another today? I mean, can you imagine how bad it is? People don't like one another because of the color of their skin. &gt;&gt; That's pathetic. &gt;&gt; People have complexes. &gt;&gt; God didn't make me Hispanic, but if he make me a Hispanic, I'd be one proud Hispanic ombre. much. Gracias. Hallelujah. Glory. Adios. &gt;&gt; I'd be so Mexican you couldn't believe it. I'd drive a Chevy. &gt;&gt; Right. If God made me in India, man, I'd cook the hottest stuff known to mankind. I'd put it on fire. &gt;&gt; And we'd eat rice. Oo, we'd eat lots of rice. And if I was a a born a black American, I'd speak Ebonics. What up? &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave anybody out. &gt;&gt; I just do the jig cuz I'm Irish. Our glory is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Our glory is that he gave us the word of God. Our glory is that we believe the same truth, the same that we're elected, we're chosen, we're called out, we're part of something greater. &gt;&gt; Not all this stuff, this deception. He's calling not a church group, but a people for his name. That's why we're a people. We're not a religion. We're fitted and joined together with the same seed of our father in us. Our natural seed came from the father that produced this flesh. &gt;&gt; But I have another seed. that came from my real father. That seed is we've all have that same seed. I love going someplace and and what the brothers are saying. This is my brother and this is my brother. Your natural brother. Yeah. This is my real brother &gt;&gt; from my real father &gt;&gt; from the beginning. This is real. &gt;&gt; What we have, this kinship &gt;&gt; is real. &gt;&gt; Because we had a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; It's not fake. &gt;&gt; But so that's why he's calling a people. He said a people for his name that receive his name. Now listen. Engaged in his name, &gt;&gt; going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of him by predestination. Just as a man that chooses the right wife in life was ordained to be part of his body, so is the bride of Christ will be and now is from old ordained by God to be a part of the body. See, oh, the scriptures are so rich, full of honey. You see, when you see the deception, you say, "Wait a minute. I'm not part of this world. &gt;&gt; I'm called to be take his name. &gt;&gt; I'm in spouse to Jesus Christ. This is my husband. &gt;&gt; That's who's got my life. I'm going to take on his name. &gt;&gt; Some of you might know Leslie's maiden name. probably a lot of you don't. She she didn't remain Lesie Fay Pepe. Now, we always argue whether that's Polish or Hungarian, but she said, "We found out it's Hungarian." She gave up that name. She took my name. We give up our identity &gt;&gt; to the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We give up. I'm not taking him, Satan, as my husband and my world and my provider and my head and my leader. &gt;&gt; We just didn't divorce Satan. We died to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But until you see his deception and accept Jesus for your his name's sake, you're under the headship of the deception. The deception is what's running your life. &gt;&gt; And it's till you stop back and say, "I'm not going to be deceived no more. Oh, sin is pleasurable for a season. Everybody was cool in high school. All my buddies, we did everything together. We did things we shouldn't do together. We raced cars down the street together. We drank together. We did everything together. Five years after I got out of high school, I didn't know where one of them was. because that wasn't life. See, just like as a man chooses the right wife in life was ordained to be part of body, so is the bride of Christ will be and now ordained to be a part of the body. You see how scriptures are so full of honey. He he says then he goes on to say he says now we find out in this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve &gt;&gt; that she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as Adam's bride was tried by the word. And Adam's bride believed every bit of the word. All all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Today, by failing on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face. And now the people that's called for his name, of course, his bride, she has come in contact again with the same thing. Not by just denominational truth or something else, by by every word. &gt;&gt; You were put here to come in contact with the same deception. &gt;&gt; Satan gave it to her in seed form. Now you're facing it in fruit form. &gt;&gt; There's his Eden. There's his world. There his deception. Get rich, you'll be happy. &gt;&gt; No. Get Christ, &gt;&gt; you'll be happy. &gt;&gt; Marry him &gt;&gt; and he'll provide for you. &gt;&gt; Put your life into his hands. Since when did we start measuring the church by prosperity? &gt;&gt; He came to the poor in this world rich in faith. &gt;&gt; I believe every word of God. I believe what Jesus said. I believe what Jesus promised young people, teenagers, young women, men that want to get married, you can believe them. You were put here in the greatest testing hour ever. &gt;&gt; You have to face the lie of this age. Just like the church, just like Eve had to face the lie. We have to face the God of this evil age and tell him what he is. He's the liar. He's the father of lies. And there's no truth in them. And this is the truth. Nothing but the truth. And this will lead you into all righteousness. And it'll lead you into eternal life. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't make it on my own." He said, "I'll help you. I'll come again and I'll be with you even in you. You say, "Lord, I'm fighting a lot of things. I know it's wrong. Ask and you shall receive. Father, give me your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Give me the power to overcome. Give me eyes that I might see, that I can be truly born again." You made mistakes in the past. He's just and faithful to forgive. His truth has not changed. &gt;&gt; It's still there. It's been there since the beginning. Nothing's changed. But the deception around us is getting bigger and darker and more evil. And it's trying to make the word of God of none effect, but it's still true. And you can stand on every promise of God's word. And God promised if you take that promise, in no wise will he turn you out. &gt;&gt; Satan says he will. I say he won't. &gt;&gt; You want deliverance? God said he'll deliver you. &gt;&gt; Satan says he won't. Who do you believe? Why halt you between two opinions? As for me and my house, we'll serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't go down that road. &gt;&gt; There's There's nothing in it. There's nothing in the world for us but heartache, death. But what does Christ have for us? Another kingdom, another body, and life eternal. God bless you. Let's stand this morning. Musicians come and when you read the Bible and you come to the Lady of Age and Jesus counseledled them. It's amazing. You would think he would counsel you to go have an experience, you know, or go get endued with power from on high. You know what he counseledled them to do? buyth meth that thou mayest see that I that I may see. You got a habit. It ain't your habit. It's a spirit &gt;&gt; that Satan's trying to put on you. It's all it is. You got bitterness in your heart. You don't have bitterness. You didn't grow up with bitterness. Satan put that bitterness in your heart. You got fear. You didn't come up with that fear. Satan put that fear in your heart. And why can't you finally just look at that thing and say, "I ain't going to be afraid no more. I'm not I'm not going down that road. I'm not going to doubt my marriage. I'm not going to doubt where I am in life. I'm going to convin con commit my position where I am right now into his hands. I'm going to look back and over all my decisions and all my failures because I'm sure my failures are bigger than all my successes. But I'm just going to sit right where I am right now and I'm going to say, "Lord, I don't want to go and be deceived anymore. I don't want the lies that are going on in the battle of my mind to determine my destination and my eternal life. But Lord, I'd like to receive your mind into my life. And I ask you to forgive me of my failures that the love of God might be shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit. And father, I pray with all my heart that my personal prayers that you give me eyes is that I can see the deceptions that you'll go before me, Father, and reveal every trick of Satan. And when it's all said and done, Lord, I I want to commit my life into your hands. Father, I know there's a lot of years between me and many of the young people. They've grown up in technology and texting and emailing and they have a whole different world of communicating. But Father, the one thing that hasn't changed is you making contact with man. &gt;&gt; That contact has been the same since you met Paul on the road to Damascus. You meant me on a rooftop. Many people in here will tell you another time that you meant them. But Father, you initiated every single one of those meetings. It was your time, your place, and your will. Father, if I could give the baptism of the Holy Spirit, I'd walk down this aisle and lay my hands on him and impart that. But Father, it's not until you touch their heart and they want to walk away from the deception and they want your spirit. Father, if they make that step, I could lay my hands on them, baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you'd give them ISA, Father, and the whole world would become different. Everything would change. They'd feel a freedom like they've never felt before. Lord, I rebuke the depression and lies that Satan tells. And I ask that your gospel, Father, go forth in the power of the resurrection, setting minds and hearts free that they might know that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Heavenly Father, I took this path not knowing that I would go this way. But father, you know the way for you are the way. You know the truth for you are the truth and you are the life. Give us that life. We ask it in Jesus' name. Father, if there's any sick amongst us, I believe if they'd just raise your their hand to you right now and say, "Father, I'm sick. Tim's brother needs your touch. I've been hearing about a baby that needs your touch. Father, I need your touch. And I ask, Father, that this gospel truth will now be interpretated in us by those promises being manifested in the flesh. I ask these things this morning that you vindicate this word to be true. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. What is this song? Let's sing it. Open our eyes, Lord. But I turn the service over. Open our God bless you this morning.
