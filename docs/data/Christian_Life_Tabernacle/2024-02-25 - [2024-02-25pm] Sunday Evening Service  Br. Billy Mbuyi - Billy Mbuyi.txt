Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
February 25, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

commit everything we h into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen good to be GA once again in the house of God Amen I don't know very much how I ended up up here but you know service was going so good this morning and towards the end I started get nervous because I knew if Brother David preached that long something was going to happen so amen let's turn our Bibles in Hebrews 11 we'll try not to be long tonight we'll just uh say a few words in Hebrews 11 uh chapter 1 it says now Faith verse one sorry now Faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen by it the elders obtain a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things that do appear amen you may have your seats also uh let's just turn your Bibles to Luke uh uh chapter 4 and verse 4 I believe that's what we read this morning just read that one verse it says and when Jesus and and Jesus answered him and say it is written that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God I I just want to say uh perhaps so much just the recap and and and of what we heard this morning um I I I was as I was listening to the word this morning it's just so amazing how time and time again the Lord is trying to bring us in remembrance of the infallibility of his word that that to give us something that we know we can anchor in something we know that if we hold on to it will take us to the destination it's something that would never fail us Heaven and Earth will pass away as the scripture says but my word shall never pass away so it's something we can rest assure and know that if God spoke it if we can find it in the Bible if we heard it from our messenger if we heard it we can stake our life on it and know that it would produce the results that God promis will come to pass we don't have to add to it we don't have to take away from it we just have to take it the same way he spoke it if he says there will be a bride in the end time it doesn't matter what the condition looks like it doesn't matter if everybody fails away if God said there will be a bride in the end time God will produce a bride it's the same word that's spoke the world into existence it's the same word that is today there's no difference and so God is continuing to show us through what we heard this morning so we can rest assured that no matter what your condition is wherever you find yourself whether you are lacking whether do you call yourself weak with whatever situation you find yourself in the word of God can bring Restoration in your life and I want to say tonight whatever you have need of if you need healing take the word of God if you need Deliverance take the word of God if you need the Holy Ghost take the word of God why because if the word spoke it the word will produce it God spoke it and remember as we heard it this morning God is not in the business of speaking and let somebody else translate it for you give you the meaning of what he spoke no God is in the business that he speaks and he comes behind his word to tell you to show you or to bring you in the manifestation of what he spoke about so it's not two different person the same God so when he starts something we know he's going to finish it so when we take and I want to say this when we take the word of God we are taking the way of Victory when you take the word of God you stand on something that has been tested time and time again something that's stood the test of time something regardless of whatever the world is going on and whatever the condition of the world is in you when take the word of God you are taking a sure Victory you are taking something that it's not even going to be depend dependent on you it's going to depending on the author of the word that you are standing on to take you to the finish line and and that's why the devil hates it it will come and and as our pastor was speaking you go read that message Harvest time he will come and try to offer you all kinds of things things and it will come and on one side it will tell you it's not yours it doesn't belong to you you shouldn't claim it and and you know it's for other people and all of that and on the other side it'll tell you you are too good oh you've made it you don't need to press on anymore you've got it and he gives you a position and he gives you all of those things but what we understand is as children of God we stand up on what he says and we continue to praise for the manifestation because he will bring forth the result of what he promise amen so I as we read brother will say this in the invisible Union and I thought it was just so perfectly correct with what was being said this morning uh paragraph uh 24 and this is in the prayer it says now let us pray he says Dear God we have just read the word what we believe to be the sacred word of God and that's what we are believing that not one J or one title shall no wise pass from till until all is fulfilled and we believe that our Lord told us in revelation 22 chapter 22nd chapter that whatsoever it said whatsoever shall take one word or take away one word of it the same his part will be taken from the book of life and we see that by uh by and we see that by this representation of the word as s misre misrepresented it to Eve it caused her to doubt one word it threw the whole human race into a fallen chaos just one word and so and that's why as Christians we have to be careful the devil is not trying to cause you to disbelieve the whole world of God he he's just trying to insert doubt somewhere he's just trying to bring you into a condition where you uh something seems too great for you you something seems too impossible for you he's just trying to cause you to back off just a little bit but the word of God said it's every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so if God spoke it we believe it so now he continues on he says then we see in the middle of the book he says came our lord Jesus and savior and he gave us a he gave us this quot quotation concerning it they said men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the solemn warning uh in the last book of Revelation of Jesus Christ was it says whosoever shall add or take away one word his part will be taken uh taken from The Book of Life Now I want to say this that's why it's so important that we hold on to the whole word of God right not just the part of it we we hold on to the whole word of God it continues on it says oh oh God knowing and seeing how fragile it says we are knowing that we are walking on the uh uh uh uh B trads and the set of life and the moral life not knowing uh what time we are going to be uh summoned to answer on high let us oh Lord lay aside everything in our hearts and everything in our mind and look straight to your word tonight is says for you to come and interpret it with leaving oracles granted so God is The Interpreter with living oracles he he when he speaks it he brings the life of it to come to pass it's not just the words of man where you can come and take it as a human understanding but when he speaks it he wants the living Oracle to come to pass it says may your spirit fall upon us and and anoint the word in our hearts that we might go from here this evening better people than what the than we are now it says that we might have a close Insight on Jesus Christ Grant it Lord that we might understand that today we are living in the preparation of God for his people in this hour this great crucial dark time that we are living now God anoint us not it says not only speakers but here is it says and together make our hearts to tremble at your word that that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom Grant it to us it says Grant this to us father we ask in the name in in Jesus name amen so yet we are people uh that hear the word of God and it has no effect on them they don't have the fear to to to come and to say to know oh this is the word of God I want to hang on with everything that's within me it is the word of God I want I want every part of it to play a role in my life and let me say this the word is the only thing that has the power of transformation amen so when you receive it that's why I said it's regardless of the condition that you are in when you receive it when he speaks about an overcomer he it's calling for an overcomer and he has the power to make you an overcomer so the receiver only the only requirement to the receiver is to have the faith to receive the word and it's up to the word to bring you into that Overcomer that it's calling for if the word is calling for Holiness it's not for you to go and try to produce Holiness in your own self no but it's for you to receive the word and say Lord you're calling for Holiness and I don't have it and I need it and it's up to the word itself to come into your life and begin to change your heart's desire begin to take away the things of the world and produce the Holiness that it's calling for the man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that shall proceed it out of the mouth of God I I was thinking about this and and I didn't get time to write it down you you when you go and you look at the Old Testament the scripture will tell you that everything that was made it was made by the word of God even the beginning was the word and the Word was with God as John will say and the Word was with God and everything was cre created by it and if you go and you even look you will see with the children of Israel God will tell them to go in and to plant the seed and they will produce forth fruits for them to eat and they will go and they will plant and and because of the law of the word of God it will produce for of fruit for them to eat but then there will come a time where God will tell them you didn't have to plant anything and I will eat you I will give you to eat the things that you haven't even planted yet so the word of God is no longer just govern our spiritual part even the very natural fruit that we eat is a product of the word of God because if God calls for a drought there's no food that's going to come out of the ground even the natural body will starve so everything started by the word of God everything it's the very word of God that even created the water that we drink it's the very word that produced the fruits that we eat the vegetables that we eat it's a very word that calls for it so man even it is natural he still dependent on the word of God but yet man is oblivious of all those things they think they have the strength and because they can play some grain in the ground but they they forget that they rely on the process that God has established there for them to receive the fruit you you take a sick person and you will go and you'll get operated on they will cut you open and they will do all those things and man the doctor will come and it will try to remove the cells that are not good and it will do that but the healing part of the body is still dependent on God oh my we I tell you we live so much by the word that we not even pay attention to it everything about us is the word of God we see because of the word of God we breathe because of the word of God everything even the very this man that's going to die he's still dependent on the things that God has produced he says Matthew 4 and4 it says and he answered and he said it's written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God butam takes that and he says the word is supposed to be in our mouths the word is supposed to be in our mouths in our mouths too he says now we know that the church is his body and then he says it is here taking his place if you can find it he says what will we be it says what we what we what will be in our mouth what will be in the mouth of the church he says the word what is it if the church is here to take the place of Christ and to take the place of Jesus the church is supposed to be speaking the word because Christ only spoke the word he knew nothing in fact the scripture says that he didn't write any books because he was the very manifestation of what the prophet wrote about that's why he didn't write any book so he was when he came on the scene all he was there to do is to know what is it that was written of me what is it that the prophet prophesy of me what is it it that I'm supposed to be in this time he was supposed the prophet said that it was supposed to be the Lamb of God he came in a manifestation of the Lamb the pro the word said that he would offer his life and and pay for the sins of the world and he did that and the same Prophet came and says now when he comes the words that he's speaking he spoke about his bride that will come in the end time so we too we don't care to write or to to write other books or whatever we are the manifestation of what the prophet talked about what is it it says this bride will be another will produce another book of act but this bride he says will not be the same as the eve before the difference is the eve before was a byproduct it was made so Satan can come in and deceive the whole creation but this eve the eve at the end time comes from Jesus Christ himself so as Jesus is the word this Eve is the word so she's here producing the same act the same action that Jesus Christ himself produced she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone no difference at all why because it's the word coming into manifestation the same Eve was created if I can say this for the purpose of falling but the eve at the end time brother says she cannot fail why because she's the word itself just as the bridegroom was he will say the scripture was speak in Peter 4 and11 it says if any man speak let him speak of the Oracle of God the word of God I and I want to just stop here for a moment and say we fell short because instead of speaking the word we speak our conditions and the things that are going on oh man I'm sick and I'm tired I can't get a job and you know we it's easy to complain we give in too much of what's not right and oh this is wrong and that's wrong and this is now if you go and you look at Jesus he never spoke any negative in fact the prophet will tell us he says don't ever have a negative thought he will say he was always positive in fact you would even take the profit of this hour things will be going sideways let me ask you this how do you take a gun you almost blow your eyesight away and find something positive out of that how do you lose your entire family your family your your your daughter you lose your wife and and yet you find something positive out of that how do you take negative things and and all kinds of things that you are subject to and all of that and find something the only thing that can do that is the word let me say that why because it was the word they there's no way anything could come out of him so whatever will the devil will throw at him he will find a way to turn it into positive whatever will come his way he will find a way to glorify God through it I was reading of Fanny Cosby Crosby and how I believe she was about six six days or six months I if I can't recall she was fine with the blindness that she couldn't see at that young age but I want let me just if I could find it just read what she said about her condition what she thought about her condition at I at at that age she was six weeks old and so she goes it says at 8 cros wrote her first palman which describe a condition she later stated it it seems intended by the Blessed Providence of God that I should be blind all my life and I thank him for the for the dispens the dispensation it says it says if perfect healthy sights were off were offered to me tomorrow I would not accept it I just want you to think about that for a moment he said she said if perfect sight was offered to me I would not take it I would not accept it it might not it says I might have not sung hymns to praise him to praise to praise to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me it says she also once said when I get to heaven the first face that I shall ever glance by sight will be the one of my savior hallu oh I tell you I looked at it I said oh God help me you know we complain for a finger that hurt you know we complain we don't come to church because we woke up a little tired and because our back hurts and because of that but look at a person who was blind completely all their lives and they are saying this blindness is for me to glorify God this is whatever is happening with me is for me to glorify God why they came to an understanding that if that says God giveth and God takes away blessed be the name of the Jehovah they didn't care whatever situation was going what was on the mind is I'm here for the representation of the word of God and regardless of what's placed before me I shall do it that I will do it regardless but we find ourselves sometimes full of complaints and full of things that reasons why we cannot take the word full of reasons why we go this way and we go that way but yet the word is presented right before us but when I'm I like this and he talks about in the th seed shall possess the Gat of the enemy he said and all colored men down paragraph 45 if you can find it he said and all colored men down the South it says carry the Bible and they said why do you carry the Bible MOS it says you can't read he says I believe it it says well how do you know it's right it says well it's it's I believe I believe it from quiver to quiver it says uh it says also it's got It's got a Holy Bible written on it I like that it says it's got Holy Bible written in it and I believe it and he says I guess you believe all that's in there he says yes sir he says I guess you believe whatever God will tell you to do you will do it he says I'll do it he said so if he'll tell you to jump up through the wall through that wall that stone wall you are going to get to get through it then he said if he will tell me to jump I'll jump he'll make a hole when I get there that's a Believer right there if he tells me to jump and there's no hole on the other side I'll jump anyway because if he tells me to jump he's able to make a hole when I get there that's the word of God that's how it's given to us it's not given for us to make our own interpretation I don't know what's going to happen happen all I know is if I believe his word what he said will happen it will happen if he says when I jump I'm going to be holy if he says when I jump I'm going to receive what I need I will jump when I get to the other side it's no longer my doing it's going to be he's doing and often time God tells us to jump oh we start to think well what if I jump and it doesn't happen What do we do next right we're not supposed to do that with the word it it's God has given it to us for overcoming power it's given us let me say this the word is what's been given to us to give us access to what it means to be God it's the only thing that's given so we can get access to the divine nature of God so we no longer act or translate things like morals that we are moved from Mortals into Immortal Immortal being so when we act according to to the word we are acting as gods and we will we will receive the results of God and he says so that's right so that's the thing you do you have to do if and it says it it it is take God and believe it jump anywhere brother bam says if you it says if you know if you listen to this if you know you can explain it understand it then you wouldn't have faith you would it wouldn't be Faith No More your faith is what you believe that he has done for you your faith is what you believe that he has done for you and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of of Things Not Seen It says don't don't don't see it he says you don't figure it out there's no way you can figure out God you just go and believe him keep walking on he said keep walking he said so that's how I stand on the pulpit for uh on the pulpit for these Visions he says he tells me to go do a certain things that seem humanly impossible and you all know that it's humanly impossible but he said to do just go on and it says he's the one that takes care of it and he will do it yes how great thou are is the one who's going to bring it to pass our part of it is to believe the word and to walk in it our part of it is to take the word and this part of God that allows us so that he says the works that I do shall ye do also so how you going to do it is part by partaking of his word that the works that I do that he did we can also do why because the word has the power to transform Us in the message believer thou this it says now you don't go to hell because you are a sinner paragraph 13 it says because you are a sinner you go to hell because you re you refuse to accept the way the way away from hell there's a bypass that's Christ there's a bypass for your sickness it says quick death and premature grave it says that's through Christ but now you you sinner in the beginning and Christ died for your sins therefore he he saved you when he died for you he saved you he healed you when he died he took your place but now all you have to do is accept it by faith faith and you will receive it and he says what I mean he says now there's nothing more to be done because his healing his your healing is already paid for he can have it right you can have it right this afternoon he says you can have it right now this very minute when you believe it when it says when your faith meets God's requirement amen when your faith meets God's requirement to believe that Christ died for your sickness when he died for your sin he died for your sin sins and Calvary and accept it upon on that base at that moment you are healed in the sight of God then you go on testifying of it believing it he says you testify of the things that you do not see of the things that you do not see see so when we come here we hear the word of God don't be afraid to go out there and said I'm already raptured I'm already well I'm already gotten it what I need I've already gotten Deliverance I've already gotten why because you're not testifying your yourself you're testifying of what you heard God say and if you testify of what he said he's responsible to come to bring it to pass the trouble we run into is we want to see it with our sight before we can testify of it right we want to touch it feel it before we say no he wants us to testify it because we have received it from his word he says believeth Thou death paragraph 67 he says faith is an individual sense Bas B is it says is an individual senses beside uh besides any there the six sense the outside man that God put in in human flesh here he says give him five senses to contact the Earth and an inside man the spirit has two senses and a unbeliever and faith and when your faith says that you are going to be healed as same as your sight it says as same as your sights that man has a red tie and a brown suit it's it's over for faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen he says taste fill smell and hear it says there you are you believe it you can't accept it now until you do believe it it says you've got to believe it before it will act you got to believe it before you would act you see what I mean friends people stand on the platform and say well why don't why don't you say why don't you why don't you why don't something happen he says it can't happen until you first believe it and confess it right he says take a woman come to the altar here or a man he says let them be ever a vile or or they could scream and cry and walk down the alleen The Altar and say God forgive me it says forgive me forgive me say it in and say it in and out and day in and day out it says they say they keep pacing Lord I've repented I've done I've done everything I could and they keep pacing until the hour he said when their hearts now listen to this when when in their hearts they believe it they believe it and then confess it when they confess it it goes to work right on it goes to work on it he cannot intercede for you until first you confess it and it's that it's that it's already done by faith it says he's the high priest of your confession amen he says H it says I feel pretty good I'm getting late I got it says I got to let it go home so yeah years and the prophet is trying to show us the the that it's when the word when you can find it in the word when you can find it and believe it within your heart and confess it with everything that's in you it says when you do that then you allow for God to come on the scene and manifest his word into your life God is here and let me say this we have to to remember H H that we are here God didn't Place us here because the enti message brother bam says one of the things he supposed to do it says is to bring us right back to the Faith of Our Fathers to the Faith of Our Pentecostal fathers and then it says the others was to restore the mystery truth but when you talk about the Faith of Our Fathers what were they they were a people that had received the promise they received a promise and they acted based on what the promise was they went into the upper room because the word told them to go in the upper room and they waited there until they were endured with a promise that was given to them to tell them to wait in the upper room they receive the Holy Ghost by obedience to the word that was given to them and let me say this and the word at the end time is not different from that because if we stay in obedience to what he promised he will do God will bring forth the manifestations of sons in the end times but why it has to be in obedience to the word that God promis will come to pass he will say and un likee this and I'll just read part of it so I can for the second of time he says now remember we are not in the picnic we are in the battlefield many people just think that they can come when they become a Christian that they that that all they have to that's all they have to do it says that that settles it forever and they are Christians and everything is going to go easy he says don't never get that into your head that's not the goal the goal is not well I'm a Christian then if therefore everything is supposed to go easy no you I'm a Christian now I have the right to claim everything that God has promised about me now I have the right in fact I have the weapon that I can use to go in battle with right I'm a Christian it means I am now being empowered I have been given the Holy Spirit I have been given the word of God for me to go to battle with and the battle is what is that I don't want to be one to live by by what the devil is offering out there he's got a kingdom and he's got people in his kingdom he wants the Christian he wants us to live by the things which he has provided he doesn't want us to live by every word of God so when we become a Christian our heart's desire is I am here to live by the word of God and I don't want to live by the provisions of Satan I'm here to live by every word that was spoken so he said don't he says don't ever get that into your head for I become a Christian to fight to fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle line we says we are Christian Soldiers and we got to be trained and brought up and know the all the techniques of the enemy and to know how to Forfeit how to fortify it says out to fortify to fight to to fight a fight and then he says we can only do so as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take some other nations what other Nation tells us when we go to war some other the ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit Will direct us Oh I thought that was so in line with what we heard this morning the holy spirit is here to constantly reveal his word before us so we can take what the holy spirit is is leading us into the holy spirit that wrote the word is here to interpret the word so what the Holy Spirit Will Will direct us and what it says and what idea he would give us because he is the Commander in and chief of the army of the Christians so I want to say this it's here we are here so we can fight for the promises that were made of us for so that the word that was written of us we can eat of that word and become that word so we can receive of that word and become the manifestation of that word that was written of us he will say the prophet will say oh my notice a great storm begin to take place doubt be begin to come in frustration begin to come in it says that's what happened see hybrids hybrids back again you know what a genuine original plant you don't have to spray it no sir bugs won't even get to it it says and it's that hot house plant that you would have to spray that's what's the matter we have to spray and to baby and pet around the so-called Christian I we we just talked a little bit about fny Crosby and we we don't want to be the type of Christian that has to be baby all the time because the end time word was supposed to bring us back into the original mind of what God intended for a Christian to be and I and we can look at throughout history and see in every age what characteristics those Christian put on display if you read Hebrews 11 it will tell you about how some were son as Su how they were destitute and they were given all kinds of things they were killed and there were all kinds of cruel things done to them but they stood the test of faith why because they had something in them that was greater than what was presented to them in fact the scripture says that that they they were glad to die because they knew they would receive a better Resurrection they were happy to give the lives they were happy to lay down their lives because they knew that what was to come was greater than what they had done oh but then it comes to the end time it's no different than this time Satan is trying to put us to sleep and he's trying to cause us to live by the provisions that he has and all kinds of things that he has out there but the word of God is yet to say don't be sprayed over let's be Christian Soldiers let's be those that are dedicated to the word of God let's be those that are looking for the manifestation of the things that God promised let's be those that are continually press on it doesn't matter what condition we are in what matter is the One Promise is here to bring us to the destination but yet the enemy is here to spray and to cause to fall asleep and to be in a place where if things don't come easy then it's a problem if things are not given up fast enough then it's a problem but God is here to make us Christian soldiers like just like those that's gone before us he's here to train us so we know how to fight like our Pastor said this morning something happened you don't you don't fall apart and continue to scream out no you stand and you begin to pray to take your possession and know I'm a Son of God I'm God's extended hand and if Jesus was here what would he do he would pray to the father so the situation can change I know that Jesus is is here but he's in the of the Holy Spirit living in me so the same thing that he did I have the right to do so therefore I'll praise for the situation to change why because it's the manifestation of the same word that was in Jesus is in you producing the same thing oh he will say he will say what is a hybrid it's a hot it's a hot it's a hot bed he said plant if it isn't if if it is an original plant you have to keep spraying it all the time and I want to say this I don't want to be that way I don't want to be sprayed over every time he says to keep the bugs off of it the bugs will eat it but if it's original print you don't have to spray it a good healthy plant the bug won't crawl on it it says the that's what the matter that's what the matter we have to keep babying people in the church glory to God sister he said glory to God sister said you are hybrid you are brought you are brought in in by some other way he says you take the hybrid corn and and and plant it back and then it says what do you got nothing it won't even make nothing it says the church is is pretty today it's it's true bigger buildings than you ever had the greatest congreg the uh greatest congregations you ever uh uh uh preached to it says the better intellectual ministers ministers that you ever you ever have it says you used to have men out of the cornfield somewhere that God called out um called out there the broom Sage patch he says but now you've seen your children to you've sent your children to school and you've made you've made grandchildren out of them and come back with all the PHD and lldd even one of the greatest Pentecostal churches today before they seen they send a man to the mission field they had to stand before a psychiatrist to see if he's mentally in elected enough it says think of it the church condition but Jude is saying all that we must remember to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered right Jude will tell us that we have to fight you have to contend for a faith an original Faith a faith that's not dependent on the things around you a faith that depends on who gave you the word a faith that's dependent on where did you get what you were standing on a faith that's dependent on knowing that whatever God did yesterday he will do it today and you will do it tomorrow a faith to know that it doesn't matter if I'm in trouble if things are okay or not okay what matters is I have received the word of God and nothing will change a faith that stands in the midst of trouble a faith that will stand regardless of what I'm looking at and that faith can only come by the word of God God he will say it's by it the elders obtain a good report oh my that if we were to receive anything good it would come by faith but when I'm going say that faith is the key faith is the very key key that gives us access to the promises of God faith is the key that opens the Mysteries and the the things that God has for us without faith we cannot please God it's like if you didn't have confidence in someone you couldn't come and ask them what you had need of and even if they told you they were going to give you you wouldn't go rejoicing knowing they gave you right you would be wondering is it really going to do it is it really going to give me is he really going to say what he do what he promised he will do but when you have faith in someone you know that they will stand for what they promise they will do you know that when they give you their word regardless of what happened they will stand by the word they have given you so therefore when we come to God the scripture will say that we must believe that the things which he promise he will come to pass if the musician could come but say and when the inspiration of the holy spirit this is in the message who is God when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession it says if you say you are drunken and you want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one if you say you are a sinner and you want to sin you will be it says you'll be right on it if you say you are a Christian and you believe and you believe it all along God will bring it your testimony will bring your will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it God will make your body obey your confession for he is the the high priest of your confession sitting on the right hand of the father now it says with his own blood and making intercession for any for any con confessions upon anything that he died for what is he saying if we if we ever want to receive anything from God we have to have faith in what he promised he will make of us and if we have faith in what he promised he will make us and and let me say this I didn't read it he says one place he says oh that if we will come it says to believe is the very substance to believe is the very substance uh if I can find it I believe it's in the Fist of the trumpet he speaks it says to believe is the very substance of what we're going to receive so when we come I got it here it says and Jesus says paragraph 100 it says and Jesus says As He was in the days of lot so he will be in the coming of the son uh of the son in the end in the end of the world the son of man he says not the Son of God uh with the it says when the son of man will be revealing it says had he he said hadn't had it Through the Ages see that perfect continuing continuing continuity of the scripture here we are living it he says the mystery even of the baptism of uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ away from the West idea it says these are things and how the Holy Ghost has moved that in the that that in the that in and show is show it perfectly and that the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the token and everything and placed it and how he placed every reformers and everything just exactly see right before our eyes it say our own eyes and then it says and it's not in the corner it's no it's World known Jesus the son of God Jesus the son of God revealing himself by the scripture making the scripture that he has been that has been predestinated to this day like it was in that day and all the others live it says and to believe it is the substance of the is the evidence of the Holy Spirit to to how did you get here it's the Holy Spirit moving you what will say he's brooding over you he's brooding constantly over you bringing you from where you were in sin bringing you what in a manifestation of the promise of the word in the end time why he bringing you why because he has something that he's trying to do with the church at the end time to believe the very word that he promised will bring about the substance of what he promised will come to pass but we cannot receive it if we keep doubting it or if we keep saying well I believe it but I don't know if I can really obtain it I I I know it's true but how do I get access to it he's here to give you access to it the person of his word is is here making his word known unto us let's all stand it says in the message show us the father the prophet said the thing to do is to know that you are coming to fulfill a promise that God Made You paragraph 71 not your own promise the promise that God Made You it says there's going to be thousand of people praying for you and when you come by the line it said by this line and when we pray lay hands on you and just as soon as the hands are laid upon you it says you just like to R to rise them to ra like raising them up out of the out of the water of being baptized you have done something that God gives you a promise what will happen he that believeth in his baptism shall be saved it says you go right out of this building testifying that you are saved what if you go out of the building saying well I don't know it says then you are not saved but God will make your body obey your confession is the high priest of all confession before you can be healed you have to confess it first before you can be saved you have to confess that you could be saved you are saved before you can obtain anything before we can go into rapture we have to believe that we are Rapture Ready why because the word is here to take you and to make you fit what God wants you to be the word is here to mold us and to bring us into it he says you have to believe that you are healed then when you believe you are healed God will make your body obey your confession so now when we come here we come by here it says let it be settled God this is your word it says this is your commandment I believe I'm Healed walk it off it says walk off the platform saying you believe that God is giving you what you have need of it's not by strength it's not by might it's not by what we can do but it's by the promise if we can only believe the infallibility of his word if we can stand of it on it every time it will produce the same result every time let's just bow our heads our gracious father we so thankful Lord and Lord Jesus to know that your word is infallible father to know that men can fail and men will fail you said that let every man's word be a lie but my word be true father you said that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away father you said that the man shall not leave by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God lord we are are here to stand upon that word Lord as we heard this morning and that we may have faith in knowing that if Jesus overcame by the word Lord your Prophet will say that you didn't give us a different weapon you give us the same weapon that Jesus overcame by may we hold on to your word oh God and let it take us through our ups and downs and lead us through the path and everywhere we go Lord because we know that surely when we stand on it it
