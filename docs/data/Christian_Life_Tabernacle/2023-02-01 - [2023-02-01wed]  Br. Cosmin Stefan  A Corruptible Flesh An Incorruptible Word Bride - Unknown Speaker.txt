is your word and your word will always remain because you are the same yesterday today and forever and you don't change Lord and so Lord tonight this simple thought Lord it doesn't have to move mountains but it's a simple thought Lord I pray that as we're just fellowshipping upon your word that you would come down in every home and that way you just would Quicken this word to them Lord not my words because it was a message that was sent for a people Lord and Lord we're sitting here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Lord with the opportunity of taking this word and feeding upon it Lord becoming a new creature Lord and so Lord I pray tonight as we're just gathered around your throne Lord that you would take all the atmosphere under your control Lord that you would just find comfort in what was said Lord and that you would just encourage us tonight Lord we just blessed for the safety of the people as they're traveling even going back and forth if they have to work or groceries or whatever it may be that you protect them Lord Lord we pleasure your blood upon their lives as the protection Lord that you would just keep them Lord and that you would just be with us daily bless this service bless your people bless the hearers bless me lordly I ask Lord from the bottom of my heart let you just be with me that you just let me move aside Lord concentrate on just speaking your truth Lord I want you to just be present tonight Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you before we sit we're just going to read a scripture for the few that are here we appreciate the support amen so we just want to open our scripture tonight Genesis chapter 6 verses 5 through 9 we'll just read that tonight Genesis chapter 6. verses 5 through 9. and it says and God saw the wickedness of man it was great in the Earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repented me that I have made them God bless you which is ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you can have your seeds before I get started I just want to take this opportunity to just wish my father happy birthday I know that this is um today is his birthday and so I I didn't give him a present so this would be my present I figured that if I can give him a gift I can I can try to give him the word of God and so I just pray that it's a blessing for him and so if he's the only one that may be benefiting from this praise God I can I could benefit from it too amen um we also want to just think with the David for the opportunity it's just um it's been a privilege for me to just grow under his ministry and just to be able to call myself home um in a place like this and where God has blessed me with the word and the ministry of of Brother Davis so we just want to thank Brother David for that so we read Genesis chapter six and God saw the wickedness of man and it was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth and he grieved him at his heart I just want to draw a small illustration because I I I was really moved when I read this when these when I read this few verses but just to draw a small picture in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so God in the beginning said let there be and there was and everything that was existing based upon that word that was said was obeying God's word and so in the beginning when he created the Garden of Eden something that he actually called perfect something that we can identify with he said let there be and there was Let There Be and there was and so there was an obeying to something that was part of God there was something that was in Union with what God was speaking because there was a recipient on the other side following that didn't matter if he was an animal didn't that it didn't matter if it was whatever whatever the creeping thing that was the fowls of the air the the the creeping things that were crawling including man they were all obeying God's word because he is his word and so in the beginning we realize that we fall into this lust of of our flesh because there was something that happened and what happened was is that there was a disobeying to God's word because he first told Eve he said or actually to Adam he said out of all of this you can eat out of but out of that tree don't eat and so sure enough when the devil came and tried to maybe influence or maybe deceive Eve he disbelieved the word and tried to make Eve believe now he said he said surely so we understand that in the beginning because now God had created something that was perfect and it came to a point where Eve disobeyed God's word it brought this flesh now into a nature of sin it brought this nature into a place where now it was disconnected with this atmosphere of Eternity right because his word is eternal and so because this word is eternal that means that if I did if if if Eve disobeyed God's word now they pulled away from this from this atmosphere that was created for them to rejoice in so brother Branham says this and God who is rich in Mercy he says uh if if I can put maybe just a small thought of what the Lord has placed on my heart you know I I'm you know I I'm not a preacher or anything I'm just you know I I'm not bringing anything new the prophet the prophets talked about all these things but you know it's just the way that I can express of what God placed on my heart and so I hope that you you would be able to follow along but you know the word is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change and so if he did it back if he did it one way back then it's only to show us that he is the same and that he word is always present and so God brother bam says in the God who is rich in Mercy in 1965. he's that boy he he that's born of God does not commit sin the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin no more desire to sin the sin questions is over you become a part of God in Christ Christ died to redeem you now just think of all this all of a sudden it says now just think of all that we would have been if he hadn't been for God but God in his rich and mercy it says he has redeemed us tonight where we've been tonight is because of his God because of God's Rich mercy upon us it says once the world was so sinful that man had caused corruption to come upon the Earth and it says it even grieved God that he had ever made man the whole head was putrefied sore the whole body and God even grieved that he ever made a man so he said I will destroy man whom have I created he will destroy him because he is nothing but just a bunch of corruption and so as we just continue reading this quote the inspiration of what the Lord put on my heart is a corruptable flesh but an Incorruptible word bride a corruptable flesh because it it actually grieved God at that point that he had created man he says I will destroy man who I've created he will destroy him because he is nothing but a bunch of corruption and the whole human race would have been wiped out at that time but God rich and mercy will not let the innocent perish with the guilty and he went away and provided a way for the ones that wanted to come in that wanted to do what was right he made a way of Mercy for those who desired Mercy and he prepared an ark in other words this is how I love the how the prophet just puts it in Simplicity now he just explained everything that Noah just did in the days of Noah listen to this in other words he put some wings on some Eagles Hallelujah he says that they could fly above the judgment and now drown down with the chickens but he made a way of an escaped in the days of Noah this caused him to do that to provide because he was rich in Mercy and so for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten word because that's himself that's how he comes and so I want myself to maybe come into just be sincere with myself you know we're not here to um I I I want to be sincere with myself and ask myself the question do I recognize the time that I'm living in do I recognize that time that I'm living in let's take the scripture in Luke 17 as we would just continue with the thought I wanted to go over to Luke 17. and just look at the scriptures as we're just moving forward verses 20 to 30. because this is a promise that was given for our day and we know that the prophet goes and explains the ministry of the son of man he shows us in the scripture and so if you want to just turn with me Luke 17 verses 20 to 30. and it says and when he had demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation so the kingdom of God does not come with observation with the visible something that our eyes can try to understand something that we can try to put our own human identity on something that God has created he says verse 21 neither shall they say Lo here and load there making us aware that there's going to be a time where people are going to be telling us look here and look here compare myself with this man compare myself with this man compare myself with something or catching my attraction from something it says neither shall they say Lo here or Lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you okay verse 22 and he said unto his disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say unto you here he goes again see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning now this is I love this verse for as the lightning the lightneth out of one part under Heaven shine it unto the other part under heaven so shall the son of man be in his day I'm sure we can all reflect how fast the lightning strike can height can light and just be gone we see the sign and we know that he has passed and we recognized it but he could be so fast verse 25. but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man so now he's given the identity of what happened in the days of Noah it says they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage you see the lustful way of the way this world is as it was in the days of Noah the same was happening in the days of Noah they were drinking they were marrying wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also shall it be oh likewise also as it was in the days of law they did eat they did drink they bought they sold they planted they built it everything that's been described in verse 28 it's something that the that man's abilities is trying to accomplish it's something that man's man's desire that are not in the word try to do eat drink bot sold planted they build it but the day that law went into out of Sodom it rained fire and brisnom from heaven and destroyed them all even though shall I be in the day when the son of man is revealed in other words if I can I don't want to substitute the word in other words if I can just express it this way so shall I be in the day when the word is revealed because the word is present the word is the I am and the I am always deals with his with his with his elect for that time present tense we can't go back and look into something that's in history because history only proves to the believer that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that because he was spoken once and it came to pass now we can believe the same thing for our generation and know that it's going to come to pass without a doubt because we have to understand that will I find faith when I come the restoration wasn't of the gifts the restoration was of the faith back to the original fathers and so now God put a word in our generation a word that it may be a lot of people may call Fanatic a word that maybe a lot of people might identify and try to put it with the man a word maybe that we can I would even say that a word that even sometimes we take for granted a word that becomes normal a word sometimes that we just say we don't know the message we say we believe the message we say that we go to a message Church but then the life of the word is not manifested and it becomes just Doctrine brother Branham says the world is falling apart in 1963 says and when God makes a promise and you see it and he tells it and it happens and tells it and it happens and tells it and it happens and it tells it and then it never fails for it's God for the day it says oh feasting on these Heavenly Promises of his promised word for this age knowing with an absolute Assurance of faith that there is a coming of a new heavens and of an earth amen a new heavens and an Earth for this heaven and this Earth will pass away but this new Heaven and Earth Paul said over here in the book of Hebrews the 20th chapter says for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved how do we get into it not by a religious system but a kingdom of God is within you the kingdom it says the king and his word is the same and it's within you vindicating the hour that we're now living in the promise that God made for this age here we are living with the King sitting in Heavenly places watching him doing these things and now we can he says and now it says how can we turn from the word to some system what does it do it denies the word you have to reject truth before you can have an error this is exactly right do you believe that you have to reject truth like the people of Noah did Noah preached a message 120 years I believe that Noah bumped shoulders with the world for 120 years as he was preaching this gospel I believe he was with in the midst of them he was actually testifying of a boat being built something that a lot of people would thought was fanatic how in the world are we going to get rain we're not even the scientists for our day or describing what is rain something that we don't understand how can we have a transformation of our bodies how can we be taken away and be changed and and have this life of this Dimension that we're Longing To Be how can this happen within our life right just wondering and so now Noah never gave up Noah kept preaching the message Noah kept building his ark right brother Branham says this as I'm just continuing I'm trying to draw you know the Lord's just good amen then our it says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed it says then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible the kingdom it says we're not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bring into pass every promise in this day as it was in the days when the word and God was won and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body and it says that is redeemed it says that is the redeemed to bring the message in this last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection and go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the threefold mystery of God his body and so we can go back to the days of lot we can go back to the days of Noah we can even go back to the days of Moses we can use a lot of scripture for for God to show us in his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever but we cannot try to use this word as just something we understand in this human mind because he's greater than that Saints he's greater than that he's Spirit his life he came down himself because a lot of times back in the old in the in in the in the in the in the days of Jesus you know the Pharisees they knew the law they knew the letter they might even know the letter better than me and you and it was so religious it was so it was so by law that the actual life of the word was that was being missed in their life and here's life trying to come show what it is to fulfill God's word shown away shown an example showing the way the word should be Jesus Jesus said himself 1963 God's Gift always finds their places it says Jesus said himself as it was in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved eight Souls out of a generation likened unto this as it was in the days of Noah what was it see great cultured people great workers great Builders great everything they had maybe a civilization just like it great things that were identifying great it says great things that they had and as it was in the days of Noah so will it be coming in the coming of the son of man see God had Noah to identify his promised word and it was very fitting the ark was fitting to the word of God that he spoke that he will destroy man but he saved what he could and so we realized that the Fulfillment of escaping Noah was Noah following God's word and saying that I'm gonna build an ark and it was the actual thing that saved everyone that believed what Noah had preached in the boat you can identify with Noah you can try to say you know Noah you can try to say that oh I I heard new I heard Noah come through my through my town all the time I already know exactly I could repeat exactly what Noah says because it says the same exact thing he says it over and over he says it over and over I know exactly but it's just you know what I just I'm too busy I'm too busy with trying to mirror something that maybe takes away my attention maybe takes away my attention from something that brings me life maybe I'm too rubbing elbows with the world maybe there's something that happens within my life now where I feel like well you know what I haven't read the message for two months maybe I should just keep on going you know maybe I just I like this thing that I'm in right now maybe I feel comfortable what day are we living in Saints the word is open the seals have been opened we have the opportunity to be able to dine with our master and reflect his life by the revelation of this word amen now Noah had to deal with the reproach of his message you know he he was having a deal with the reproach because you know he was saying these people every day and he was preaching a gospel to an unbelieving people he was preaching a gospel to an unbelieving people even though everybody around him noticed that there was an ark being built they were actually watching what Noah was doing and Noah kept preaching the same word because he knew that what God gave him was nothing but thus saith the Lord and he never departed from it because he gave him specific instructions and he said I want this to be this length I want this to be this way I want this to be this way I want everything in order and I want you to get every two of each kind of an animal it was Specific Instructions now if Noah would have gotten away from the word then the ark wouldn't have been able to float as we're moving on but says but now wait in closing we say this to reject God's simple message to reject it God's simple way is to be destroyed eternally now that's how much he says how how we talk how simple it is and people think well they can laugh at it they can run over it they can treat it any way they want to but it's Eternal separation from God it says those who died in the days of Noah did not listen to his message those who died in the days of Noah did not listen to his message and they perished and Jesus went and preached to them in the change of darkness in the death before he rose up he went to hell and he preached to the spirits that was in prison that repented not in the long suffering of the days of Noah while a simple message of God by a simple man was being preached and he said Noah preached that I would be here and here I am the word Here I Am the word and uh and so we understand as the prophet's teaching us here the only ones that were able to actually receive salvation and become a a a a a living soul I can say become quickened was the ones that actually got to listen and and believe what message Noah was saying and it was that that pulled them into this dimension because the ark now was another dimension the ark was now something that they were knowing that they're about to go into and they were believing that God is going to fulfill his promise let's turn to First Peter chapter 3 as we're just reading here the scripture that the prophet was referring to First Peter chapter 3 verses 18-22 First Peter chapter 3 verses 18 to 22. for it is better if the will of God be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing for Christ also had once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when Once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein ate wherein few that is eight Souls were saved by water it says verse 21. the like figure unto even the baptism does also now save us not putting away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ but the answer of a good conscience towards God who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and Powers being made subject unto him i i i and as I was we were reading that verse it just struck me because you know when we do something for the love of the word when we do something because there's a life inside of us that just doesn't do things for man I'm not just going to do things for man to see me that I pick up a bucket move it from here to here I'm not going to do things because you know but there's there's something inside of us there's a burden there's something in my in our hearts that would be able to do things because we know this actually brings a satisfaction by the word being able to be fulfilled in our life to live a life with charity for the word which is God himself will bring a resurrection to others around you because that's what he did as he was living life in the flesh as he was letting go of the things of the world as he understood even Jesus himself he was tempted in the word unless himself and even Jesus himself used the word itself to be able to defend him brother Branham says he could have used his powers he could have used all that he had but the father had now shown him yet to do that so he used the word as the safety First Peter Chapter 4 verses I'm sorry here's uh uh a quote brother bam says in thy house now when Christ died he committed his Spirit to God before he left the cross he said into the hands I command my spirit and the Bible said that his soul went to hell and preached that's his conscience and that he was to the spirits that was in prison and his body went into the grave now now see this is what the prophet is saying right here now see he was behind a barricade of scriptures he couldn't rise for three days and his Spirit went down he says he went back up in here in the presence of God and after three days that barricade was taken down because the scripture was fulfilled and this and his Spirit went to the soul and the soul went to the body he rose up he said before he died I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again now the brother Brandon brings it in in into our day now it says now think of it every one of you in here as far as I know tonight Christians look the thing that is in you now the spirit that's in you now it's the same spirit that raised you up you have power to lay your life down you have you're doing it right now for Christ it says then you have power to take it up again you have power to lay down and you have power to take it up for it's the very spirit of God that is in you that raises you up it was the very spirit of God that was in Christ that raised him up so you have power to lay down and you have power to take it up First Peter chapter four you know we have power to lay down our life in humility being humble being able to reflect the image of who Christ was because we've seen an image that came into our generation we sent an image that came and lived in our time and showed the actual fulfillment of what the promise was to take he was the first fruit that came among us as mature fruits and he showed the way he showed exactly what the life would be he showed exactly what this message would be able to produce and now we have it as a image which is the image of the word and so now as God is coming within our hearts by the revelation of his word it lets go of the world and actually receives more of his word and his word is his promise and his word is life and his Lo his word is love and his word is peace these are promises that we actually have access to and we can inherit as part of our inheritance even now even in this eating that Satan has created say it has created an Eden for this generation to be able to try to deceive the very elected if he would possible to try to distract you to try to get you in a position where now you're starting to disbelieve God's word because there's so many lines out there there's so many ways that the devil can present things there are so many opportunities that you can actually try to partake of and now if you don't be careful and know the revelation of what you stand you can be moved but the kingdom of God is Not movable because that's what Paul said we read it earlier Peter I'm sorry it says that the kingdom is not movable beloved Chapter 4 verses 12-16 beloved thinking now strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing that has happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy The Life of Christ if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rested upon you yes Lord I'll take it the spirit of the glory of God rested upon you and on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer as a thief or as an evil doer through or as a busy body in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf knowing that where you stand on it's not being revealed by a man but it's been revealed by the word himself coming down through a pillar of fire knowing that this word would be about to grab you out of this Eaton knowing that you're house your pest house this prison house would try to keep you away from the very thing that actually God came to do in his to redeem his Spirit bride the one that was predestinated the word that was actually inside of the Bride and so brother Branham talks uh in the souls that are in prison he actually uses the story and he's trying to make us understand that the actual World we're living in has become hell because he had a vision when he was 14 years old I believe and I'm sure everybody remembers the story he gets shot he goes to the hospital and as he's out there on the hospital bed he's seeing himself bleeding I believe you know I believe there was a lot of blood he was on the hospital bed and he was on the he was he was there was something inside of him that thought he was this is it this this was going to be his last opportunity and so he goes into a a vision I believe or a dream and he sees this and he says I heard a noise sounded like some kind of a haunted affair and when it was I looked coming and it was a woman and they had green stuff just just could just see their face and they had green stuff under their eyes and their eyes looked like run back like woman today paint their eyes run stuff like that it says and their eyes were and their face and they're going ooh ooh ooh it says oh my and that got him that had that got him to to say Lord take me out of this place and I'll serve you the rest of my heart the rest of my life and so brother Branham brings it later down in the same service and it says 40 years later the Lord reveals to him the actual dream or Vision that our Prophet was in and he says he wasn't just the penny everybody knows the story and he catches himself where he sees this woman coming off the escalator and he's just sitting there and he all of a sudden he just he starts just shaking and and there's something inside of him that just says Lord could this be is this is this is this where what happened and he catches himself in a position where he's like am I in hell what is this it brings them back to division when he was 14 years old and he doesn't tell sister me to anything and he just says honey let's go while you're ready and he says I got so scared I thought Lord surely I haven't died and you let me come to this place after all and there they were making just around like that and a vision like you can barely hear with your ears you know just the the Mumble and going on and the people and the woman coming up the escalator walking around there oh it was that Grim stuff looking looking funny stuff around their eyes it says it was mournful and he said and while I was under that I thought of this what day are we living in what day are we living in how we've gotten comfortable do we not know that this world provides only nakedness they're blind they're poor they're wretched and sometimes we want our image to be what the world has because we lack what our eyes can see and now we try to produce the same thing but maybe with the little bit of it's okay it's okay if I do this and then before you know it the little bit turns into a little more and before you know it a little bit turns into a little more more and before you know it you just disobeyed God's word and now you have to find your way back you have to get back to the word you have to get back to what came in our generation you have to came back with why the pillar of fire came in this generation and what was it to do it was to restore a fate to a people where they would be able to have their word on their lips and have nothing but to say it the Lord because what they would speak would be nothing but the word not what this human flesh could try to accomplish or say then after now it says brother Braham says this now after Jesus had clearly came identified himself God identified him and he prophesied and after the days of his prophecy though scripturally identified the people rejected him that's right he preached then after they rejected him here the ones that he had a possibility of being saved remember when he was preaching there was a possibility of anybody being saved we don't know who they are they're predestinated but he continually preached but in the days of his preaching but he says after the days of his preaching his ministry continued on because the last group he preached to was to the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven I I have clearly read that from the Bible here this it says from second Peter see he went and preached to the souls that were imprisoned which is Hell locked up until the day of judgment because you see the Judgment isn't now there's no burning hell now somebody tell you that guy's in burning hell now that's wrong see a judge of this Earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial and God will never throw a man into a fiery furnace until first he is condemned by God's Own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trial is the white Throne judgment but now he's in a place called a prison house and so as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot where men drank they ate they married they lived life they become comfortable but there was a voice that kept coming there was a voice that kept speaking there was a voice that kept a group of people together to believe that the promise will come to pass and it was by that word that the actual saving of their souls got to where they were on the ark amen brother Branham says this and Jesus said himself as the father sent me so send out you and as the father sent him to preach to the living to those who had hope and then present the met the same message to those who had no hope he seems to be fit it seems it seems to fitting at this time that will have to be done it's just because the spirit of Christ Living in US does not change the nature of him or does it change God's system he must be the same in every generation he must be the same he said as the father sent me so send are you I wanted to read first John chapter 2. just a few verses as we're just winding down amen verses 1. 15 through 17. because the spirit of Christ doesn't change natures the word is the same the word produces the same atmosphere the word for this is the same attributes the word produces the same love the word produces the same Joy it never changes these promises are for every believer verses 15 through 17 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him for that for all that is in the world the lust of this flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world it's what the devil tries to put before us and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever and we know that his will is his word and he because his will is his word the only way as a believer that would be able to to to manifest God's word and this hour is to be able to be quickened by his Revelation daily every day we must be sitting in God's word for him to come and reveal his word in our hearts the Ministries might be must be the same and so much he said I see some of you writing scriptures down it says he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also see the works brother random says the works in quotation marks and it says preaching to the lost if I can say testifying to the Lost witnessing to the Lost preaching to the Lost Healing The Sick and then to the impossible to ever be saved see the work went on just the same so this has been hasn't has it been may I put it like this the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in the church in this last day that's what many of us believe I believe with you I believe this if I didn't believe it I I'll do something else about it because after all this is me he says it's me and here concerned and if the spirit of God be in you you're concerned about the people you're concerned about lost souls there's something inside of you that just wants to reflect the image of God where you would be able to just be so sensitive to the spirit where we can start the start dining into this dimension of a spiritual mind where now we're partaking of these promises of this land and the more that we're actually partaking of this promises that were we're inheriting that the ones that were actually were for us from the beginning now we're starting to show another atmosphere because we're not of this world we're not living in this world to say that we're living in this world we're strangers and when you're a stranger you act strange when you're a stranger you talk strange when you're a stranger people look at you like you're strange and you know what the elect that sees the strange that they can identify with they'll grab a hold of it and now they'll know that there's something that's different because the scripture says no man speak like this man before who is he to bring the word the way he did and to try to tie up all these Loose Ends but it was the voice of the seventh angel that came in this generation by the appearing of a pillar of fire that actually brings a quick and Empower to the seed and would be able to draw the rest around them because one Resurrection brings another resurrection and and and and and it just multiplies brother Branham says this in the maps Masterpiece as I'm just I'm just closing if we can just stand maybe the musicians can come as we're just closing at this time brother bam says this and and a masterpiece it says Lord Jesus thou the fountain inexhaustible Fountain of Life it says flow through us today Lord and cleanse us from all unbelief and all sin that we might stand in thy presence now knowing that there is a need Among Us we know that we are sinners and not worthy of any blessing but then when we think of him who came and took our sins and when his blood's there and it's not us and the presence of God it's him just our Voice through his blood he's blood speaking o God then cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief give us the desires of our heart for we truly have these desires to serve you in these in this Awakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put Upon Us sometimes to perfect us the trials we've been told that he said think enough strange that these they can think of now strange that these trials come they're only working for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place these great deserts of experience where righteous men are being molded into Saints we thank thee for these experiences Lord we would no mean no wise want to anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this will be brought closer to you and when the burdens are so heavy and we can't go no further says then we write it says we raise our hands and scream to our father then hear us Lord make us well for this kingdom of God Lord as we just close maybe if you're just sitting at home and we come to our identity of being an ego in a chicken yard and I've bumped elbows with these chickens long enough maybe it's time to start storing My Wings start dwelling in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I can have mother Eagle come speak to me it's hard enough to just be able to look down and try to look at this flesh and what it tries to do and how it tries to pull you away from the word and how it tries to drag you to the right and to the left and it says look here and look here and pay attention here Lord sometimes so much confusion but Lord you send a word that would never fail Lord you send away that you would never let us depart from knowing that whatever this flesh would try to do if it's not according to thy will if it's not according to Thy Word I don't want it Lord we were tired of just being able to just feel comfortable in this world going places and not even testifying or maybe bring in the word of the Lord in an atmosphere we're atmosphere creators and the only way you can create an atmosphere is by his word and as you're bringing this word with this nature around a seed that maybe could pull back and understand that they have hope oh what a rejoice Lord as you know we're not here I'm not here to hide anything Lord I'm as sincere as I can be Lord we just thank you for this goodness we thank you for your word Lord I was once lost [Music] the life that was lived that showed the way of this message Lord got me interested and as you're just listening to this voice Lord it just molds you into this image Lord Lord it was a seed that brought forth another seed and so Lord you know my desire tonight is to get closer to you Lord to get closer to your word to be able to dwell in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Lord we're just so thankful for what you have done for us so far your grace and your mercy your blessings Lord your your word Lord if it wasn't for your word where will we have been Lord and if it wasn't for you to come Lord and bring a prophet in our generation to show the way the truth and the life Lord we're such a privileged people to know what this message produces Lord I just pray Lord that if there is a desire out there I know that a lot of us are home and maybe we're just not in a church service but God can come to you even right there Lord I pray that if there is a heart that's seeking for you it's worth a thousand worlds ten thousand worlds a million worlds Lord Quicken your words from Lord to know that there's nothing but the word and it's the word himself that comes personal to you individually and will bring forth life we thank you Father for your goodness we just commit the rest of the service and the rest of the evening and our homes and where we are into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen let's just sing the song as we brought by the mighty to come give me the key of C please [Music] we are standing [Music] Holy Ground [Music] rule all around [Music] her Jesus now we

read you know he mentioned how everything in the beginning had to obey God's word there was an intelligence by law the prophet of God said eve by misbelieving one word caused everything to fall and the prophet said do you think you'll get by with misbelieving with one word he said how are we ever going to get back how we ever going to get back God sent a message to reveal every spoken word of God we're living in that hour I like the quote I wrote it down brother Branham said he put some wings on his Eagles how did he do it there's an old saying whenever you hear a bell ring it puts Wings on an angel I tell you this message came to But Wings on the Bride of Jesus Christ your predestinated seed but God has a provided way just just as the message came for Noah and built an art God sent a prophet to give you wings to fly above this this world aren't you thankful for that I wanted to sing that song key of D there is power in the name of Jesus my may the Lord just bless brother Cosman I
