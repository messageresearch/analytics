He will show you things you never seen before. He'll take the impossible and make it possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the kind of God we serve. Amen. We have some testimonies here. Um uh just an announcement. Brother, uh Jean Timomo writes, "Dear saints, by the grace of God, we came back safely from Cameroon and thank you so much for your prayers." Amen. We thank God for traveling mercies. Amen. Amen. Brother Enoch writes, uh, I'd like, uh, he says, I'd like the saints of the living God to join me in thanking God for granting me a teaching job here in the community college here in Texas. Amen. His wonderful name be praised always. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. What do you have need of this morning? Amen. You can certainly lift up your hands in faith and know that is God this morning that he will meet the needs of the believers. whatever it is. Amen. He's here to do it according to his word. Amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings, if you could come, Brother Tim Sal, if you could just come and take the stage before the church. Amen. [Music] What a blessing it is to be gathered together. You know this uh this Bible I hold here. Brother Brandham explained it much better than I can. There's two wings like an eagle. There's an Old Testament and a New Testament. And I don't understand completely how a man can come in the flesh, humble himself, the creator of heaven and earth, come down in a kangaroo court and be completely guiltless. Pilate tried to wash his hand and say, "I find no fault in him." Yet he died. &gt;&gt; But his own word says, "Where a testament is, there must also a necessity be a death of the testator." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz a testament is a force after men are dead. Otherwise, it's no strength at all while a man liveth. We also have a testament. Let me tell you, out of necessity, this man must die. &gt;&gt; All right? So whatever we have need of, we can say, "Lord, I lay myself at your altar this morning. Cleanse me, purify me that I may live out your testament in my life." Let's bow our heads. Gracious and kind heavenly father, we approach you once again, Lord, in true humility of spirit, Lord, and knowing that our lives are are worthless without you, Lord. You've cleaned us up. You've set aside us for your service. You sanctified us, Lord. You filled us with your spirit and now we come as your word says we can come boldly to the throne of grace. Lord we do this by faith believing in the blood of of one Lord not bulls and goats that we have to continually come but once forever Lord you've entered into that holy place and now we call upon your name Lord at the mercy seat the right hand of the father. Lord you you know it all. You see it all. you know, our our heartfelt cries to you, Lord, when we don't even know how to voice it, Lord. The uncction and crying out, the groaning of our spirits, Lord. We pray that you just be a high priest and intervene on our behalf today, Lord. Lord, the things that are upon our hearts, those things that are spoken and unspoken, uplifted hands, each one, Lord, we just commit it all to you for your honor and glory. Lord, as the word comes forth, may we claim it, believe it, accept it, apply it to our lives, Lord, and see the bountiful fruits of it as we go onward in this life. Lord, just use the tithes and offerings for your honor and glory as well. Just be with those that are out. We think of our pastor, Sister Lesly. Lord, just bless them and keep them, Lord. All those that may be traveling, but Lord, we thank you for those that have assembled here together. May we be a blessing to one another and may we be blessed by having been in your presence today. We ask this in the name of the lovely Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Got any rivers [Music] you think are crossable. [Music] Not any mountains you can't turn through. God specializes in things impossible. [Music] And he will do what no gather. power can do. [Music] Oh, I ain't got any words you think of. I cross the wall. Oh, and not in any mountains you can't [Music] do. God specializes in things impossible. [Music] And he will do what no other can do. Hallelujah. [Music] Let's sing that thing, that song. I speak the name of Jesus over you. Amen. [Music] Oh, I speak the name of Jesus. soul to you. Oh, in your hurting, in your sorrow, I ask my God to move. I speak the name for all that I can do. Oh, there's I'll seek heaven. Pray this is you. I pray that you're healing. Circumstances won't change. I pray that the fear inside of me in Jesus name. I pray that your breakthrough will happen today. I pray over your life in Jesus name. In Jesus name. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh I speak the name of Jesus all through you. Oh, and in your heart, in your sorrow, I ask my God to move. I speak the name cuz all that I can do. Oh, in desperation I seek help. I pray this for you. I pray that be healing. Circumstances will change. I pray that the fear inside of you in Jesus name. I pray that you pray. Hallelujah. Oh, I can control over in Jesus name. In Jesus name. [Music] Hallelujah. God will not forget your prayer. Prayer makes you stronger. Oh, and I have never seen around forsaken or begging right and left to suffer. [Music] Oh, and have patience. Just wait and see what God can do.

Heat. Worship. [Music] Worship. Worship the Lord. Worship the Lord. Worship the Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, we've come to worship you this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, we've come to hear your word. Father, we've come to acknowledge you in all your ways, Father. And to exalt and lift you high above, Father, we confess with our hearts that you are Lord of Lord and King of Kings. Father that all things were made by you and for you and without you nothing consists. Father you are certainly the all and all. We ask you to receive our hearts this morning. Father forgive us of our trespasses. Father our weaknesses the battles we go through. Lord oh God be merciful and mighty on our behalf. We ask it in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. I I was sitting in my office and and brother Tim came to pray and and uh I had this uh quote right on my desk. I was reading and it says so perfect. The word of God is so perfect. Even the Old and New Testament is two halves of one whole. That's right. Old testament is half of it. The New Testament is half of it. Put it together and you got the whole revelation of Jesus Christ. There is the prophet speaking and here he is in person. See two halves and one whole. Now we don't want to take too much. He says, "Now remember the Old Testament is not complete without the new and the new could not be complete without the old. That's the reason I say two halves and one whole." So I just thought that had he come up and he said that it it was right there and right next to that before we read our scripture uh I thought this was something you know uh different people have different ideas of the rapture and that's what we're living for right we're living for the rapture. So the the messenger said this. He said, "You see these little pockets going through the air? They call saucers and so forth. People, well, well, we better leave that alone." Here, all these people come up missing. You say, "Don't hear from them. They're standing there and they're not there." That's the way the rapture is going to be. One of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and and hide heron or born left. It'll be transformed in the moment of time. Dropping right out of space and taking home that. See? See all this is going on now. And the pentagons wondering about these lights and mysterious lights and everything that they're seeing in the sky. You seen that they had one here in the paper in Jeffersonville this week and so forth, a mystic light. So, oh, they don't know what it is, but listen, little children, it's going to pick you up one of these days. See, don't worry. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I thought, you know, I that kind of gave a new definition to the uh meaning of I'll fly away. You know what I mean? He said, "One of them saucers one day is just going to drop down and pick you up." &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's looking for the pickup? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Every You know, I hope it's true. They say there's more pickups in Texas than any other state. Well, I hope there's more. I hope there's more. Amen. Hallelujah. You might as well say it the way you like it, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord richly bless you. Before we read our scriptures, I'd like to make a couple announcement. There's construction going on in the back of the church. We're making a little pavilion to put the Gaga and Spike ball and the little games for the kids back there and also use it for other venues. And so there's open ditches, there's a lot of dirt. So, uh, mothers, if you don't mind your kids falling in a ditch and and, uh, uh, playing in the mud, then don't watch them. Okay? But if you don't want them to break a leg or get poked or get full of mud, then watch them. Daddy's help. Watch the kids. Everybody watch one another. So, let's be careful about the back. Okay. We have construction and then uh service tonight. See me. I I'm going to take this evening service. I leave Tuesday for three weeks to go to Africa. So, we want you to have us keep in prayer. we leave Tuesday, but this evening after service uh the Steppen family is um uh they're moving to Prescott, Arizona. They're opening a nursing home uh with their daughter and their son-in-law. And so tonight, we're going to have a little farewell, not goodbye, because we Christians don't say goodbye. So, we're just going to say farewell as they start on this journey of life. and they have a heart for the old people and and uh uh so you know I hope if I get to that place that I could have a Christian like that looking after me and I'm I'm pretty good shape because I got a lot of nurses in here. Uh so uh I I might take two or three to take care of me. But we're we're grateful for them and the service that they had here. and and you never know our our uh you know I tried to get my brother to preach as much as I could and and I wasn't too successful on that. So maybe God can use him to speak to the uh those those people there in Prescott. So we're going to have some ice cream and if anybody else wants to bring another dessert, you can. And we'll have coffee and ice cream after a short service this evening. So, we need a few brothers to help set up tables. And so, we'll say our our tell uh uh aa vista. We'll say see you later, but till next time, right? And then if they don't like the nursing home business, they can always come home and nurse me. So, we appreciate that. So, remember the construction and remember the service this evening. So, let's turn in our Bibles over to Hebrews and we're going to play a little about 14 minutes this morning because there's something I really like you to hear. And uh and we're going to read the first few verses of the book of Hebrews, the first chapter and the first uh couple verses uh of um Hebrews. And so Hebrews 1:1, God who at sundried times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets. So the prophets prophesied, right? And now we just heard our prophet say, "What they prophesied now had come to pass." So now what was spoken of had appeared. So now what appeared is what's speaking. So he says hath in these last days spoken to us by his son. Who hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. When he hath by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. Amen. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. You may be seated this morning. Before we uh just speak just uh uh play that little portion of uh the message we'd like to play for you. Um we we we see in that scripture a a a beautiful uh uh revelation is the best way that I can express it of how God's word works. And you know we are the generation that is watching what was prophesied fulfilled. Brother Brennan was in the day of the prophecy for he was a prophet. Uh he was a seer. So he would speak as if it existed at the very moment because in his realm it did. &gt;&gt; It it was a reality. That was something that a prophet had the great ability to do was was to uh could be there if I could. I don't know another way to express it. But he would see it even to the place where he would have a vision and he would know there would have to be a had. And the prophet of God said in order to do that it had to exist someplace in time. And so the the prophet was able to uh travel because it it was real. It was prophesied. It was spoken and he was able to travel to there and to see it what was to be. Now we're limited to that because God didn't give us that gift to do that. And also he could go back and see what was. And so with that ability to go back and see what was and to see just like Jesus with the woman at the well, he could go back and to see what her problem was. She he knew what her problem was. He knew what what was causing her to act the way she acted. You know, we get too much encompassed sometimes with the result instead of the cause. And if we could ever get to the root of the problem, then all the things we're battling. So you can battle the symptoms all you want. And our messenger used to say, what you've got is a bad case of symptoms. You know what I mean? You can't treat the symptoms, you know, and that comforts, but if you could ever get to the cause, there could be healing. Well, so we found out that he spoke to us by fulfilling the prophecies that were spoken. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? So Christ is revealed in his own word. He's speaking to us today because we are here today. We are not trying to live in the time that our messenger was here bringing this message that we have. He was in actually he was in the day of rejection. We are in the day of acceptance. We were called to accept what has been rejected. And that's why we bear the reproach that we bear because people have already passed judgment on it. They've already said it was false. They already said he wasn't a prophet. They already rejected what he taught and his revelations. But you are the people of acceptance. And because that you've accepted it, you have eyes that you can see and you're seeing what that he prophesied coming to pass. So you're living in the day and you are the people of the fulfillment of the prophecy. He said there would be a bride. He said there would be a bright age. He said there would be a people called out. He said that there would be a people separated. In fact, his word called for total separation from unbelief. So, it's not like that's something we ought to do. No, God didn't say there ought to be a sun or there ought to be light or or there ought to be this or there ought to be that. No, he said there let there be light. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was light. And he said, "Let there be this." And and that came to pass. And so he said, "Let there be separation." So he was going to separate the sheep from the goats. So there was a time of separation. There was a time of calling out. There was a time when the people would see the word of God coming to pass and they would separate themselves to the word of God because they see him standing in his word. They see the fulfillment of the word. And so when you can start to uh uh uh place yourself in the position that you are, we are not ought to bees. &gt;&gt; You understand? We have a desire in our heart to be what God said that we were to be. And if we live below that, then we have a right to seek from him the grace, mercy, and power to transform us. &gt;&gt; Cuz God has transforming power. Every one of us here today, no matter what condition you're in, no matter where you've been, if that seed is in you, God does not impute uh a sin to you because the seed of God remains in you and he has cleansed us from all sin and unrighteousness. Yes. &gt;&gt; So it it we we got to come to the place where we're not standing on the outside as observers. &gt;&gt; But now we become participators of the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; So I want to participate in the fulfillment of the prophecy &gt;&gt; that's given to you to do that. That's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; I think that did that go over your head. That's your inheritance &gt;&gt; to be participants in the the the prophecy in the participation. We are now joint hes. &gt;&gt; We are now sitting in heavenly places. So we are we are the people that he chose and elected and placed in this building this morning other places across the world. People that have heard the cry and now have applied the Isab and are seeing what's spoken coming to pass. So we are in the day of the fulfillment. We are the people of fulfillment. We have the eyes to see what was spoken. &gt;&gt; How many knows the Jews didn't see him because they were blinded? &gt;&gt; If they would have known who he was, they would have never crucified him. &gt;&gt; They would have went right on into the millennium. They would have had the King of Kings sitting on their throne. They would have ruled the world. It would have been wonderful. But for us poor little sinful worthless Gentiles, he blinded the eyes of those that he loved, chose a redemption path for them, and came and purged us of our sins. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Praise God. God's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. And so, he speaks here. He says, "Now my text this morning is Christ revealed in his word, his own word." So he's not revealed in my word. He's revealed in his own word. Don't drop that part out of there because there's some things we'll talk to you in a little bit. But I cannot draw a picture of the Lord and try to get you to believe it. He won't reveal himself in my identity. I remember I met a a sister once. Well, I'll just tell you who it is cuz they're good friends of mine. It was uh Sandy Peterson. I I don't think Ron listens, but he'll probably hear this one. So, Sandy, you know, we love you, me and Lesie. But I met Sandy Peter the first time, and she looked at me, she said, "Are you David McGary?" I said, "Yes." Are you sure you are David McGary? Well, you know, Sandy, she she's uh uh she uh I say, "Well, she made me wonder whether I was my who I thought I was." And I said, "Yeah, I'm David McGary." She said, "Well, that's strange. I thought you were six foot tall with one eye and a scar on your face and was an ogre." Well, obviously, you know, she might have been right. I don't know. But uh but you know, so you can't be a a what somebody else's picture is. &gt;&gt; And and let me say this, you can't be the Christian that other people want you to be. &gt;&gt; You can't let them draw your life for you. You can't you can't let them beat you down and say if you were a Christian you would do this and if you were a Christian and you were a Christian. That's how the Nickelodeon spirit captured the church and robbed the church from their freedom is everybody kept trying to be what everybody else wants them to be. God made you to be what he created you to be &gt;&gt; and he put that seed in you and that seed has the ability to transform to exactly what it was planted to transform to be. Now you've got to trust that &gt;&gt; because if not fear will start to rule. And there's so many principles. But let's go and continue to read here. He says, he says, now where I come to this conclusion to talk on this, knowing that what we say, we must just say it because we're gathered together to just a haphazardly speak on anything. So we didn't come here today because we gathered together just to haphazardly speak. You understand? If that all I would have to do is say four or five buzzwords, you know what I mean? And and just say what we already believe and play some really good music and we would jump and have a little hoot nanny and then we would leave &gt;&gt; and we would have had a nice time. So, I noticed that here's Ben and and Clever singing and and they know there's two girls watching them. You know what I mean? And so, they might as well put them together in one thing. So, and and there they are. you know, and I I just heard those hearts pitterpattering all the way across the country to my office, you know. So, uh you know, I got in trouble because I announced that I was going to uh uh Harrari and I didn't think about people streaming. And all of a sudden, poor sister Vongai got a phone call. Why didn't you tell me he was coming? Well, I told her not to. And she got in trouble cuz I let it out of the I guess let the cat out of the bag. I think they call it, don't you? But so we just don't say it. But listen to what what our pre messenger saying to us. He says he says just to say something, but it's something that will help stabilize &gt;&gt; the people. So that's what we if this was his purpose this morning. I I want to take the message that he made that statement and bring a thought this morning to help stabilize us. &gt;&gt; All right. So that's what we're after. For we are going to pass through dangerous, treacherous waters. We're already sailing through them. And sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me that seems that it's so much of it. It's such a scare. And so we want to be stabilized because remember Satan will try to shake you down. When Jesus paid for Peter, he Satan Satan desired to shake you and sift you like the sand. And you've got to be ready for when he comes and attacks you and shakes you and tries to break down your confidence, break down your mind, break down your spirit, make you feel unworthy, make you feel that it's not worth pressing forward, make you have a feeling that you're hopeless, that you're worthless, and you're not a part. Remember, there's one thing about Satan. He is a liar. &gt;&gt; There is no truth in him. &gt;&gt; He can't tell the truth. Don't believe the lie. Believe what he said. That settles it. So we we want to we want to be stabilized. And and so we realize that we are in the day of the pale horse rider. If we were to look through the church ages, we were to look at what was revealed in the book of Revelations, how that Satan was going to go forth and attack us, right? How he came down, how he started the deception, how he went out on a white horse, you know, just acting gallantly. And then he just kind of started putting his little lies. So what he did, he he came out like like a like a saint. And then he added this little creed and he sprinkled this little doctrine in there and he started working the people to start to conquer him. And then he went out as a a red horse. Right. Right. Then red. And and then that red horse enforced what he was doing. And anybody could that stood up or had a revelation, he slayed them. And then he began to charge a penny and a wheat and he began to he began to sac to institute a method of redemption other than acceptance. And people started to try to work their salvation up. And the minute you tried to gain salvation and you tried to work for salvation, it's just like me right now. If you saw me start looking for my glasses, have you seen my glasses? I've got them all the time. &gt;&gt; It's It was in me. I had it. But now I've been deceived. I've been mocked. I've been enforced. And now I no longer look. And so that was conquered. Then then he went out as a black horse and he brought everybody under his darkness. He had he had the interpretation of the Bible. He had created what system the church was in. Everybody that came out of Christianity or had any claim to Christianity was a member of one of his daughters and it's all we knew. And I'm not I'm not going to go on because I'd love to right now because this I just love these, you know, I'd go into all the four uh beasts that combed all those, but that would be a whole uh sermon morning in itself. But then finally came the pale horse and that was a mixture of all those things together. The author of confusion &gt;&gt; to to make it so milky and to make it so with so many aspects and and uh scenarios, you know, I talk to people and and they've got, well, what if what if this happens and what if that you'll never get nothing done. &gt;&gt; I hate it when guys just sit down and take an hour and a half to discuss 15 different ways to do something. Do something and if it's wrong, we'll fix it. Of course, I'm the one paying, so I want it done in a hurry, you know. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is now. He He doesn't want us to stabilize. He doesn't want us to have something that we can be anchored to that that we're not going to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine. We're going to be anchored solid in the word of God. We're going to know who we are, where we stand, and what's going on around us. And we're going to be looking for the soon coming and catching away of the bride. And we're going to enter into that earthly and that beautiful union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride in that great union that we are supposed to now have in our hearts. So if we're not careful, we'll spend all of our lives trying to get the scenarios and the confusion and all those things put together and they're not even part of our picture. &gt;&gt; Those pe they're not that's not the puzzle we're trying to put together. There's only one picture we have and that's God's word. So we we want to be we want to be stabilized. And we preached the last Sunday a little bit to about leaning not to our own understanding. And that theme carries over into this this morning, how you can't rely on what you figure out. &gt;&gt; And we'll touch on that in a little bit. And and so we we we use the terminology of a life coach or a mentor, right? Or as we would say, an example. So we found out that the word of God is our guide. We've never been down this path before. No matter what, you can't use things that are are are are of yester years in the hour that we're living in. And we kn know know that that denominational message doctrines and creeds cannot meet the challenge of the hour. They can't meet and battle what we're facing &gt;&gt; because we're facing a a a pale horse devil that appears as an angel of light and would deceive the very elect if possible. &gt;&gt; And we're all mixed together. Now, I don't know who is and who isn't. And so instead of using this church, we will use the three churches on this block. So one church is unbelievers, the other churches make believers, and we're the believers. And if you want to take it a little more closer to home, that's up to you. So you you understand that he's saying these are perilous times. So there's got we've got to be able to stabilize in these times that we are and to be able to to anchor in the storm, to go through the mental battles, to go through the battles that that our flesh presents us. to be able to get up when our shortcomings come up and we fail and know that there's something within us that's driving us. I remember when I saw the Ten Commandments for the first time and there's one scene in that that moved me. It's Moses. He's he's pushing into the storm and the wind's blowing and he's got his ride. He's he's going forward and he said he didn't know whether to curse or bless. That's which was driving him. Now I believe this morning that all of you have something in you despite your battles that's driving you. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't believe that you would have came &gt;&gt; this morning. It might be a still small voice. It might be a little flicker in darkness, but there's something in you that's beginning to cry out that wants to come to life. And just like there there's something in you that you want to be better, you want to be closer to God, you want to know the truth. And I think that's the best thing that a man can do is somewhere in his life is sit there and look around and look at his circumstance. Look at his friends. Look what he's involved with. Look what he's messed with. And ask himself, is there any truth &gt;&gt; in all this? &gt;&gt; Because we know that it's the truth that sets us free. &gt;&gt; And I know what the truth is. I am the way, the truth, the life, and no man cometh to the father but by me. The Lord said, So we want truth &gt;&gt; and and and and the truth is what he said &gt;&gt; because the spoken word is the original truth. He we just read the scriptures. He's the one by his word the power that brings all things to pass. So we we recognize where we're standing. So I wanted to play third just 13 minutes this morning and he's going to talk a little bit in here and and write and and you can go home. That's the beautiful thing about this is I'm only playing 13, but you can go back and and read it and listen to it and find even more within it than I'm bringing out. My theme this morning is let's go. What secrets is he speaking? is our coach, our life coach, our leader, our mentor, our leadership want wanting us to to take this morning to stabilize us. Now, you got to stabilize the ship. So, but he's going to talk and it's a it's a a subject that he's going to give for a way to relate what a a real heartfelt love is. and he's gonna talk in this, but I'll let him tell the story, but I want I, you know, uh, he lays it in in just a a way, but he's talking about a a man that's going to marry a girl and he realizes that that girl would be happier with somebody else. yet she would marry him if he wanted. Now, they're not married. Okay? And I notice he picked that right up, so he had to address it. But what kind of love does he have in his heart that he would be willing to let go of the thing that he loved in order to make that girl he loved happy? So he had to have the motive and objective and the purpose. And he wants to take that and relate that to what is it in our heart that we love most. And that's where we'll pick up after we listen. So it's just 13 minutes. But in this, I want you to grab a hold of the fact that if you you're in God, you always were there, that you're a part of him. Now, if you're a part of something, that opens an avenue to you to ask and to receive. Because there is a connection and it goes back beyond where you are in this life. It's an eternal connection you have with God. And that eternal connection has to be what stabilizes us. So, if you would bear with me, uh, I I hope not in my folly, but I I know I'm going to play 13 minutes. I know that some will criticize me for not playing the whole thing. Some will, you know, uh, but I I'll tell you, it's like he said, he said, I read this because my words will fail, but his words won't fail. So no matter what I preach, I know these 13 minutes won't fail. &gt;&gt; So you can take from it whatever you personally get from it. And I can only share with you my revelation. &gt;&gt; I know that you say, "Well, what are you preaching for?" Because there's something inside of me that burns. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God didn't build the church on my He build the church on you the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you. And that's what the Holy Spirit is. It's the personal revelation. It's going to talk about the spirit and what it really is. And I I hope this 13 minutes is a blessing. Then we'll just speak on a few little subjects to help stabilize us. And I hope you love and trust the word of the Lord. And I hope we leave here today a better Christian, more determined, knowing that our sins are under the blood and that some glad morning when this battle's over, the flying saucers going to pick me up. And that that'll be a a glorious day cuz that what we're living for. Amen. Enjoy these uh few minutes. Listen close. But he's going to describe where you come from. God bless you. And last Sunday when we was going into those cycles uh about how that the five senses on the outer rim, that's the inlet. Five senses to the body. There's only one way you can get into the body. That's by those five senses. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. There's no other way to contact the vi the body. On the inside of that man is a man called spirit. And he has five senses. Think, thought, and uh thought and love and conscience and so forth. All right. Now, you can't think with your body. You think with your mind. And in there is where too many of Christians only stop. And they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field, they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit that the real believers anointed with. But down on the inside of that next rim, the third rim is the soul and that's predestinated by God. There's where the real seed germ lays is in there. And remember, if I take a culka bur and cut it open, draft into it the heart of a of a wheat and put it there, bury it, it would bring forth a wheat out of the cocoa bear. No matter what the outside is, what the emotions today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth. Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God's got. &gt;&gt; But he cannot bring that word word by word. &gt;&gt; That's where he failed in the Garden of Eden. That's where he's always failed. That's where them the tape on false anointed ones are anointed ones. They can be anointed with the spirit, speak in tongues, dance, shout, preach the gospel and still a devil. It's the inside. Now remember Jesus said, "All the father has given me will come to me. No man can come except my father draws him first." Now we taken through the lesson to show that in you were in your great great great grandfather all the way back physically speaking. Then that's what you are in physical being natured. Sometimes a child will be born in a family red-headed. It astonishes a father because there's nobody he knows of his people redhead or the mothers. But if you'll go way back to several generations, you'll find out somebody was redheaded. That seed keeps coming on down and you come the nature of one from way back. like because Hebrews 7th chapter said that Melzdc Abraham paid ti to him when he's returning from the slaughter of the kings and Levi who received tithe paid tithe for he was in the loins of Melzdc at or the loins of Abraham rather when he met Melzdc. Now the same thing is this. If you are a son of God and if I am a son of God or a daughter of God, we were in God at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus became the fullness of the word, then we were in him germ form. When he was crucified, we was crucified in his body. When he rose from the dead, we rose with him. And now since we have recognized it, now we sit together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. See, for he we if we are sons and daughters of God, we are God's children. Then we are attributes of God. Then we were got eternal life. And God is the only eternal life there is. Then we were in him from the beginning. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus became all that word, then we were part of him then. &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. That's in there. There's no devil, no powers, no nothing can ever move it. That's a tie post of the soul. You can be anointed out. You're in this spirit and desire and do all these other things. But when it comes to this high post to that word, you'll never move from that whole right study and true to that word as it can be outside of that regardless of what you do. You're still lost. That lady you see in church age naked, blind, miserable, don't even know it. It's out anointed, anointed with the real spirit. See that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit. But his soul is his germ. That germ is the word. See, and how I don't care how much you preach, how well you do this, and how much you love, that's one of the inlets, the spirit. You can't love with your body. You love with your spirit. That's one of the inlets. And you can love and even love God. Still not be right. You can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right. Jesus said so that many would come in that day. That word settles it. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us. Notice I'm going to speak on this subject of the Bible of Christ revealed in his own word. Where I draw this conclusion is in my room. Some dear person may be sitting here this morning. I got a picture hanging in my study up there. That's a picture of Hoffman's head of Christ wrote in the biatitudes and right where you would come the place like you need a part of the hair they press a little harder on the pen as you pass that part. There he is sitting in his word looking right out. Christ in the biatitudes someone ever who it was. I thank you for it. And somebody brought that picture in, put up my study there of Elijah going up in a chair in a fire. We appreciate these things. Many times big crowds, I just don't get a chance to speak and say these things, but I see it, brother, sister. I I know it. God knows it. Now, I'm going to speak on this subject of Christ revealed in his own word. How in the biatitudes there stands a picture of Christ standing right out. That's where I thought of this subject. Now Christ and the word is the same. See you say how was the Bible? People says us riding with a man not long ago. He said think of it. We here on this earth the way we are and we only know or can only say that we're saved by some Jewish fable called the Bible. I said, "Sir, I don't know how you say that, but I don't believe it's a Jewish fable." I said, he said, 'Well, you pray. What do you pray to? I asked for so and so and certain things. I didn't get it. I said, you pray wrong. We should never pray to change God's mind. We should pray to change our mind. God's mind don't need any changing. &gt;&gt; It's right. I said, ' Not what you prayed for. Know a young Catholic boy one time was had a prayer book saying prayers for his mother to live and she died and you throw the prayer book in the fire. Well, see, I don't go for the prayer book. But anyhow, see, you take the wrong attitude. You're trying to tell God what to do. Prayer should be Lord, change me to fit your word, not change uh uh not let me change your mind. You changed my mind. See, you changed my mind to your will. And your will is written here in the book. And Lord, don't don't let me go till you got my my mind set just like your mind. And then when my mind is set like your mind, then I'll believe every word you wrote. And you said in there, you make everything work together for good to them that loves you. And I love you, Lord. It's all working together for the good. I've been this week down in the country standing with some very dear friends. I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we was eating. We always sit around have a little like a little study on the Bible to talk about love. There's a certain person said to me, he said, "I believe you're an antichrist." I said, "If that would be pleasing to my Lord, that's what I want to be. I want to be whatever he wants me to be. I love him. And if he should cast me into hell, I still will love him if I go with the same spirit I have now." He looked at me kind of strange. I seen four or five of them there. Young men, young wives, fine women. I noted how that boys love their wives. So I said to them, I said, "Here's a way to test it. If your wife before you were married, now you go back. Say you this married life, you've been dreaming you were married. You really wasn't married, but you dreamed you were. And you woke up and you went and talked to your girlfriend and said, "You know, I dreamed that we were married. We had children. We living happy and and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything. And then this girl would say to you, you know, I love another man better than I love you. I could be happier with the other man. Could you from your heart love her well enough to say, "God's blessings rest upon you, my dear. Go with this other man." Now, now check that each of you man. Are you winning? See? Well, if your love is correct, you do that. Boy, you are interested in her welfare. What you know, you could have her. You can live with her. You, she's your wife. She will be, she'll marry you, but she won't be happy. She'd be happy with and then if you love her, then you want her to be happy. Therefore, whatever the will of God is, let God's will be done. whether I'm happy with it or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do. Therefore, check your your objective and your motive by that you know where you love God or not. What if you'd say uh you serve me but I'm going to cast you away. I love you anyhow. Therefore, if the churches would see that and could believe it in that manner, it wouldn't be one trying to jerk the football away from the other fell when he's running with it. He'd be protecting that one. &gt;&gt; When real true motive and objective would be one trying to say, "Hey, I got this, too. This is me and this." See, God can't use a man. So much impersonation follows it. And that's Satan. And the people can't realize that you're trying to take the ball from somebody's been given. Let God raise up a certain ministry and watch how many goes after it. See, see now genuine love for God. No matter what part I am, Lord, if I can only say a word for it, help protect it. Let me do that. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing it would be about your wife. If you really love her, see, it's not a it's not a a filio love. It's an agapo love, a genuine love. she could live with somebody else happier. You're not married now. Of course, you can't. And by the way, people listen to these tapes. Some so many sins in said, "Well, in the marriage and divorce, you said this and you said that." I've said that so many times. These tapes goes only I'm speaking to my congregation, brother. I'm not responsible for what God gave you to shepherd. I'm responsible for what kind of food I feed these people. This is for this tabernacle only. See, now if the people want to listen to the tapes, that's up to them. But I'm speaking to what God has given to me. It was their sins that was omitted. Someone wrote out and said, "Well, I've done this and I done that." You said our sins. I I didn't say that. I said see it to this. This is only to this people right here. The people here in the tabernacle, my own flock. Now, if people wants the high breed food and stuff out there, you you get the revelation from God and do what God tells you to do. I'll do the same thing. But these messages are to this church. Notice how we come back. We've got to have something another that we have to hold on to. Something has to be a tie, folks. In other words, it's an ultimate. And everyone must have an ultimate or an absolute. I preached on it one time years ago on an absolute. A place that's the last word. Now, if that don't make you want to go home and listen to the rest of it, I don't know. But I I will say this. He He said, "I'm responsible for what kind of food I feed these people. I take that &gt;&gt; pretty serious to heart. I have enough to answer for, but I certainly want you to be able to stand on that day and said, you know, I didn't know brother McGary was a scrown girl, but there's one thing I can say. He fed us the word of God for the hour. And I think that's what's so important. But I noticed that that he he wanted to point out when your motive and objective is right and you loved that girl. So he tried to bring it to something that would that we could feel what type of sacrifice it would be. That you loved her so much that you were willing to give up everything that your heart's desire was. Everything that you wanted, everything that you thought was important to you, everything that you had dreamed about and your love was so great that you would that you would want that person to be happy. And and then he even goes as far to say as I'm going to serve him even if I knew that he was going to send me to hell, I'd serve him anyway. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said if I feel the way that I feel now, in other words, the love that I have for him is not based on results of what I get. &gt;&gt; It's based on what he wants. &gt;&gt; So, we're not Christians to to so of a beneficial package. We ought to love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; That's what ought to be to grow a love. When a when a a man is attracted to a young lady or vice versa and and they love that person, they they they try they try to in such a manner to express that love. They might not just come out and say it, but she might twinkle the eyes, you know, or she might light up like a balloon when he comes around. But it's his love for her that wins her over. Or vice versa. You love because they first loved you. You know, always kid sister Lesie about her asking me to marry her. Well, I I take the fact that she dialed that number wrong that you know that's what started it. So, you know, so you know what can I say? Yeah. It just it just becomes something that he wants us to we're talking about being stabilized. You can't stabilize in doctrine. You can't stabilize in the intellect. You've got to know that he first loved you. And now what's he saying here? He's saying that you were in in your grandfather. You were you were in there in your physical. You showed up with physical characteristics that you can track down your natural gene seed line and those attributes have appeared. &gt;&gt; You you can see that. I get it all the time. Well, you know, Matthew looks like you. David looks like you. This, you know, he looks like you. Aaron, you know, everybody sees a little bit of me in the boys. sorry boys, you know, and they'll say Sharon looks just like her mother, you know, and she's beautiful and and so you you he's trying to stabilize you because the right mental attitude towards any promise of God's word will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Okay? So he's trying to stabilize you. If your natural gene and attributes came down through your natural physical line because that germ seed was in your parents and it produced you what you are man is so disgusting. They want to g genetically engineer and so you can try to inject and get genes in change attributes. You know, they'll they'll one day they'll find the the little nose gene. So they'll wipe out my whole family trademark by just putting in a little nose gene in there. Well, if it ain't got a nose, it ain't a McGary. You know, you pick up that characteristic, right? And I'm talking lighthearted because I I want we're talking today about being stabilized. So, if that gene came through, if I look in the mirror and my mama, she would say to me, she would jump and I say, "What's wrong with She said, "I I just saw Mickey walk by and it was me." She said, "I saw your dad." You know, she would see my her husband in me. And it would catch her sometimes. Just a look, just the the way the eyes was, just a certain characteristic that that came out that was passed down. I didn't have any say in that, &gt;&gt; but it showed up. &gt;&gt; And he said the same thing with you spiritually. that attribute's going to show up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wants you to know that &gt;&gt; if you were in him, you were in him in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Let that part come out. Don't get some substitute of some emotional or some spirit, some somebody that somebody wants to give you an identity. My identity came from my physical gene and my spiritual identity comes from my spiritual father. And that seed, my father's germ, physical seed, had the ability to produce identifying characteristics. &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophet would say there's no big eyes or little. You know that. Praise God that you can be yourself. All these people waste all this time on this Hollywood garbage and they go buy millions and millions of dollars of paint to try to change what they are and they spill all kinds of money rearranging their face and they don't understand the all they're doing is losing who they really are. Since when do we want to be like the world? &gt;&gt; This. Now, that's what he's talking about here. This love that doesn't want you to be anything else but what he wants you to be. Now, that's what you love more than anything else. I love him so much. I love his word. I love what he did for me. I love who he made me. I see him in his word. I see what he said. I see it come to pass. I see him standing there. I know he's real. I see the prophecies of this day. I I heard about Malachi 4:5. I heard about Luke 17:30. I heard about the pillar of fire. I saw all the prophecies. But one day, &gt;&gt; it was standing there. the ministry of Luke 17:30, the son of man, God veiled in flesh. And I saw it &gt;&gt; and I knew it was him &gt;&gt; cuz he was standing in the fulfillment of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine that? You've got the germ spiritual seed, the eternal seed. He called it that was predestinated by God. God put it in there. That's pretty good. Okay. And so he put that part in there that that that germ part. It was predestinated. He said down on the inside the next realm, the third realm is the soul. And that's predestinated by God. There is where the real seed germ lays there &gt;&gt; and you could take a cuckle. &gt;&gt; Cuckleberg, &gt;&gt; but if he put &gt;&gt; a wheat seed in that cucklebar &gt;&gt; and you bury that seed, &gt;&gt; a wheat will grow from that cucklebar. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that germ seed is in you, &gt;&gt; you can dance, you can shout, you can do all those other things. &gt;&gt; That is no evidence &gt;&gt; of one thing. It's all, &gt;&gt; but if you got that germ seed, you love God's word. &gt;&gt; You're attracted to it. You hear it speak. &gt;&gt; He trying to woo you, call you, deal with you. The rain falls on the just and unjust. Thank God for the rain. But there's something deeper in you. It's a desire that I am going to live and follow the word. That's my ultimate. Everything has to have an ultimate. It has to have the last say so. &gt;&gt; It has to have the thing that makes the decision. Yes. &gt;&gt; He says whether it's a car, you know, you finally got to come down to why are you buying a Ford or buying a Chevy or buying a Der something that's the ultimate thing. And if it's money, the deal guy will make that money match what your ultimate is. &gt;&gt; He'll do what he can. If it's the car, then he knows that he can charge you whatever he can get out of you. &gt;&gt; How much can you pay a month? &gt;&gt; You really like this car? I think I can get it down to $540 a month for you. Oh, really? I really want that car. But if you walk in and said, "I don't need this car. In fact, you got one opportunity to give me your best price. I'm walking out. Well, let me go talk to the sales manager. You call me up. Here's my number when you get the best price. I don't got time for that stuff. I don't need a truck. Sales manager called me one time. What can we do, Mr. McGuri, to get you to buy a truck? Give me a price. Give me the right price. I'll buy it right now over the phone. It just depends. What's your ultimate? What is the thing that's driving you to make the decision? Is it a career? Well, what happens if God would call you to preach instead of some other career? Would you take it despite your weaknesses? Despite you think you'll never have peace until you embrace your ministry and start using it. You'll be miserable and no matter what you do because God called you to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; You can run from it all you want. You can come up with every excuse in the world to run from it. Satan's got plenty of excuses. But when it comes to that word, &gt;&gt; if you love him, &gt;&gt; no matter what it's going to cost you to obey that word, you'll take that word. Then you watch him come on the scene. &gt;&gt; He'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; If he sends you, he'll take care of you. I never graduated from high school. Well, I'm not here. I don't talk about myself much. I've got more complexes, more socially inept skills in everything. nothing that qualifies except for this in here. &gt;&gt; I want to tell people about what he did for me. &gt;&gt; I preach to people that don't even speak English. You We're not involved in this. It's him. your life is him. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's what have you connected with? What is your what when he said you look at that girl and you want her to be happy? The only thing that's in you is her welfare. He said, "Oh, I wish the church could get that." So when we Now, I'm going to make a big jump. I'm going to be under the presumption that everybody in here loves this message. No matter what battle you're going through physically, mentally, spiritually, the flesh warning against your spirit down on the inside, that predestinated seed loves God's word. and you've made the decision that I'm going to do what the word says regardless. May I just take my get on my soap box for a moment. That goes for communion and foot washing. &gt;&gt; He said wash feet. Good enough. So, we understand now that we've already decided, I'm going to do take the word. Well, we know we have an adversary, right? We know there's a pale horse. We know that he's going to try to battle our minds because that's where the battle is. and to try to get us to go through all kinds of of sufferings and and mental trials. And now our messenger comes says, "I'm going to give you three secrets, three little things not to do to keep you stabilized." All right. I'm going to just talk about those three things because I'm speaking you to this morning as predestinated eternal seeds of God who love the word. And now our mentor, our coach, our spirit is going to tell us how you approach the word of God and not let you be drawn here or drawn there. He says the first thing is is you can't misinterpret the word of God. Okay? So, you can't make the word of God say something it doesn't. &gt;&gt; In other words, you can't take the scripture and use it to become the interpretation of something that you want to do. &gt;&gt; People will go back and they say, "Well, you know, they done this and they done that. And they use the word they they interpret the word of God by taking the scripture and creating a meaning for it and then their actions work on that meaning. Don't misinterpret the word of God. It says exactly what it says. You can stick with it because if you stick with his word, he will stick with you. &gt;&gt; He will change the world for you. &gt;&gt; He created loaves and fishes. He had them cast their net on the other side. that widow might the gospel was preached around the world cuz she gave what she gave. You don't think that she was in every church service back in those days in every service that brothers would say, "Praise God, it's it's nice to have Sister Mike with us this morning." She was a part of it. her whole world changed. God will change the world for you. &gt;&gt; Know that if God before you, who can be against you? Now you've got that love affair. Lord, it's your word. I'm going to do what your word says. I don't care the consequences. I don't care what the result is. I am staying with your word. I am not going to misinterpret the word for my situation. I'm not going to find a scripture and misinterpret it. So now that I can do something that I want to do and put some religious scriptural covering on it, stay with it. He'll reveal it to you. Accept it just the way it's spoken. Don't ever misinterpret the word. It'll keep you stable. The minute you start moving scripture and and interpreting scripture and everything, your whole ship gets out of whack. It's like taking all the cargo and putting it on the back of the boat or taking everything that you're doing and putting it all in one box. No, you take all the word of God. You don't misinterpret it. It will keep you stable. The word of God will balance your life. You can live a balanced life in an unbalanced world. The scripture will keep you down the straight and narrow. It'll give you the advice that you need. Stay with it. It's your stabilizer. The other thing you do is you don't misplace the word of God. You don't take it from one age to another. &gt;&gt; We've got to live by the word of God of our age. &gt;&gt; We stay. We don't misplace the word. &gt;&gt; We don't take the word out of context. We leave it in its realm. We leave it in its day. We have the scriptural promises for our day. When the when the world saw those scriptural promises, here was the Lord Jesus standing there in their presence revealing himself through his own word revehold in the last days I'll send you Elijah the prophet. As it was in the days of the son of man, so it shall it be. as it was in the days of Noah, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mysteries of God should be revealed. Here he was standing in those scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God veiling himself &gt;&gt; in a prophet who will and Christ was using that prophet &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word and reveal himself. &gt;&gt; You can't misplace. You can't take the scriptures out of the revelation for its day. &gt;&gt; All your Bible when you read it, it can't be misplaced. You can't read your Bible like you're in the days of Noah. You can't read your Bible like you're in the days of of of of Moses or Noah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to read the Bible in the light of where that you are. That you are the people that are here to fulfill God's word. &gt;&gt; You You understand? If you don't, you're misplacing the word. I'm taking this Bible and I'm going trying to go back 2,000 years ago and look at Jesus as being somebody walking on the shores of Galilee. That don't do it. I've been there. I've been where he preached the sermon on the mount. I've stood in all those places with every other kind of Christian dressed any other way that you can't believe. And Christ wasn't in any of it because the only place that they would find Christ and the Lord Jesus is find it in the age. They can't misplace the scripture. &gt;&gt; So don't you try to misplace it. Don't let people try to use the scripture on you when they're taking it in another age. Oh, he died for everybody's sins. That's true. But he also came back and indicted this generation for not seeing him standing in his word. &gt;&gt; So when you see the word fulfilled, you see what was prophesied. You saw the prophecy, right? We heard the prophecy. Now we see the fulfillment. We know he's standing right in our midst revealing himself in his word. &gt;&gt; So we don't misplace it. You can't take it out of the age you're living in. Most of us want to live in the age of justification. I like justification. That's my favorite one. That's the one that forgives all my sins. I don't even have to be sanctified. Then I just keep it under the blood. But I'm misplacing it. I've got to go into sanctification. I got to move. Now all the scriptures apply to sanctification. Then then you then all the scriptures all the same scriptures that applied to justification then applied to sanctification. Then all the scriptures applied to sanctification in the resurrection. And now we're not even in that age. If a prophet came and preached the same message, the same idea, the same thought, no wonder he could take this and said, "This became a brand new book to me." Because now the scriptures were properly placed under the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; You are living in the day of the open word. &gt;&gt; You are not living in justification. You are not living in sanctification. You are not living in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; You've risen way beyond that. So you can't take your life and try to misplace it. Too many people and they've spent a lot of time in the last few years trying to get this message back in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And it was one of the things that he warned us. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every place that there's tongues, there's confusion." &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, there's nothing but a bunch. And everybody keeps saying, "Well, we believe in the movement of the spirit." Let the love of God be shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Watch the power of the capstone. &gt;&gt; Watch the power of the capstone. &gt;&gt; Watch the power of divine love. Watch the power of the right motive and objective. Watch the power when you when you take the prophet's reward and you believe every word that's spoken. Watch the power you have. It's more powerful than any shiver or shake. &gt;&gt; It's thus saith the Lord. You can stand still and watch God move mountains for you. &gt;&gt; The word of truth. Satan's always trying to get us to take it to some other age, some other spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, they love the message until he says one of these flying saucers is going to come down and pick you up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to admit that's rich. &gt;&gt; You guarantee that's every bit as strong unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood. I'm willing to bear the reproach of the age, &gt;&gt; the voice of the age, the voice of the time. I don't need to try to bring this message back into what other people think Christianity is. &gt;&gt; Just the way he revealed it, just what he said. He revealed himself by fulfilling his word. God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. And the last thing to be stabilized. So I'm I'm talking about being stabilized this morning. So in other words, you're not going to be stable if you keep wanting this message to match up with some other age, some other spirit, some other way of worship. &gt;&gt; You'll be unstable. Can I say it this way? You got to be allin. &gt;&gt; This is the age you can't be lukewarm. &gt;&gt; You can't be mixing. You can't sit back and follow this message and hope it should just have a little more move of the spirit. It should have a little more of this and a little more of that and and if oh, if I could get it, I'm going to filter it so it's got just the flavor that I want, then I'll embrace it. No Lord, don't let me change your mind. You change my mind. You don't change to match up for what I want. Change me so I can be what you want. Now, if we could do these things, he's telling us our life coach, our mentor, the one who went through the reproach and the battle of this message firsthand. He's already fought this fight. He's been argued with, sat down, tried to be disproved, ran through the mill. ministers came through him, ministers meetings. He was offered all kinds of positions and jobs and everything. But what did he do? He stayed true to the one that called him. &gt;&gt; He didn't try to mix it up. He stayed true. He said, "Don't try to give an interpret. Don't try to make bring another spirit from another age. catch the spirit of our age. It's the eternal revealed word, the revelation of Jesus Christ. And the last thing he says, don't dislocate the word. May I say it this way? Because he said, if you miss if you dislocate the word of God, you'll put the body together wrong. You can't take a scripture, this scripture and this scripture, and put them together to make them say something. You can't just take this quote and this quote and take this quote from here and this quote and and dislocate them and join them together. You've got to leave them in its context. &gt;&gt; We have we have taken brother Bram's message and we've grabbed a quote from here and a quote from there and we've put this disjointed all these words and built these quotes and came up with whole kinds of things that aren't even in there. things he never said, things he never did, attitudes he never had. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you one thing about Brother Bam. He's the most humble, gracious, meekst, kindest man that this generation has ever known. &gt;&gt; He could know every rotten thing you do. He'd have hugged your neck, called you brother, he would have grabbed you by the hand without even you knowing it and casting devils out of you. &gt;&gt; He wasn't an exposer. &gt;&gt; He was a hider. &gt;&gt; Perfect love hid a multitude of sin. I remember when I heard the story. Brother Brandham was standing behind the curtain with his Bible ready to go out and address the convention. And the brother got up and said, "Brother Brandon won't be with us because he's been called out on a sick call." And I'm glad it wasn't David McGary behind that curtain because I had to come blasting out behind that curtain go, "You liar, not him." &gt;&gt; They said, "Brother Brandham, go." Oh no, brother. I'd never make that brother a liar. I'd never expose a fault. I would never do anything that would make him feel, you know, hurt his influence in any way. Well, I thought, come on, we're running after all kinds of things and here's the capstone being displayed to us right in before our face. &gt;&gt; We There's Christ standing in his word. revealing and we are dislocating the word of God, taking it all over the place. If we would just stay in context, &gt;&gt; stay in the spirit of the age, stay in what our hope is, resurrection, being conformed to his image. If the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in us, it'll quicken our mortal body. And then we start living for the right thing. We're not tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, with everything that goes this way and goes that way. We're stable. God will interpret his word. Whatever he wants, I want. I want what he wants for this age. I want to be what he wants me to be. I'm not trying to be what everybody else thinks a Christian is. Because I'll guarantee you when he braided that belt and that whip and that cord and walked through that temple, they didn't think that was no young Messiah. And I'd hate to fall into the hands of an angry prophet. But we don't have to sweat. Let's let the attributes that our spiritual father put in us start to come to the surface and let us be who we really are, the children of God with the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. And these simple little things of not wanting a different time, not trying to put stuff together, but just living and waiting upon the Lord and having the attitude, not my will, but thy will be done. That'll birth Christ every time. God bless you this morning. Pray for me for our trip. We'll see you this evening. God bless you, brother Billy. Thank you. Amen. Thank the Lord for his word. Man, we we've taken the letter and left the spirit behind. Oh, if God could just fill us with his spirit this morning that we can have the same attitude that the prophet did and the same spirit that he did that he may dwell in us. Let's all stand. Amen. Let's sing. Thank you for the cross. A flat. Amen. Oh, thank you for the cross, Lord. Oh, thank you for the price you pay. Bear in all my sin and shame.
