[38:53] it's a great subject that we gonna spend
[38:56] you you may need to spend a lot of time
[39:00] [Music]
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] and we know when we talk about worship
[39:18] worship is is a reverence
[39:21] uh that we give to god who are in
[39:24] divinity or to a deity
[39:28] [Music]
[39:52] because god is the object of worship you
[39:54] have a person
[39:56] there was no one to worship him he don't
[39:58] in a test to ricky existed remember then
[40:01] he was the one who existed by himself
[40:05] but because he had attributes
[40:22] and we know how god created man in the
[40:25] garden of eden
[40:27] in the book of genesis
[40:30] that god placed in every man
[40:34] a desire to worship don't come
[40:46] and but every man uses that desire as
[40:48] they please
[40:50] yonaki adult jew they are those that
[40:52] worship god you knock your doll every
[40:54] day to cinema there's those that worship
[40:56] movie stars
[40:59] there's those that worship the cars
[41:02] there's those that worship their homes
[41:06] shacky person every human being
[41:12] has everything
[41:13] has something that they worship
[41:17] is
[42:14] who gives us the breath of life
[42:19] it's that god who gives us everything
[42:21] that we have
[42:24] i i recall a story that i was told
[42:27] calvin kevin put
[42:30] there was a subject that was about uh 65
[42:33] 75 years old
[42:36] there was a a subject or a subject of a
[42:39] king i believe who went to the hospital
[42:42] on your middle
[42:46] they put him on oxygen for about 15
[42:48] minutes
[42:50] and at the end they gave him a bill
[42:55] when he looked at the bill
[43:00] [Music]
[43:02] the doctor thought that he was crying
[43:04] because he couldn't pay the bill
[43:09] they told him that if you can't pay
[43:11] we'll find a solution
[43:14] he said i'm not crying because of the
[43:16] bill
[43:18] i'm pr i'm i'm crying because
[43:24] god he allowed me to breathe
[43:28] freely for 75 years
[43:30] [Music]
[43:31] but for 15 minutes
[43:34] you give me a bill
[43:44] [Music]
[43:49] he deserves everything that we have
[43:53] he deserved the best place in our lives
[43:58] and we know when we want to talk about
[44:00] worship
[44:01] yeah
[44:03] there's many things in worship
[44:16] because if we don't know who to worship
[44:19] kel can swap not his sincerity
[44:21] regardless of our sincerity celtics were
[44:23] not too born full regardless of our good
[44:26] desire
[44:28] we are idolaters
[44:33] we have to be sure of who we are
[44:35] worshiping the key will keep setting us
[44:38] down okay and who who takes that place
[44:41] in our hearts
[44:47] when we don't
[44:48] know
[44:50] we are on the side
[44:54] look at jesus when he was with his
[44:55] disciples
[44:57] he asked them a question
[45:00] who's who do men say that i am
[45:17] all those people that were saying those
[45:19] things
[45:20] they were religious people
[45:23] they were going to churches
[45:26] they were going in the synagogues
[45:30] but they didn't know who they were
[45:32] worshiping
[45:36] because they didn't know who christ was
[45:38] jesus
[45:39] but it's jesus
[45:43] he looked at his disciples
[45:48] it's not what the other is thinking
[45:52] but you
[45:53] me
[45:55] and me
[46:03] peter said you are the christ
[46:06] the son of the living god
[46:09] and jesus said
[46:11] blessed
[46:15] blessed are you because it's not flesh
[46:17] and blood that revealed that to you
[46:20] but it's my father who's in heaven
[46:23] and you are peter
[46:25] and upon the stone upon this stone
[46:29] i will build my church
[46:32] what was peter
[46:36] it was the revelation of who jesus was
[46:55] for us to be in the worship that jesus
[46:57] said even the gates of hell will not
[46:59] prevail against
[47:04] we have to have the true revelation of
[47:06] who of jesus was
[47:22] a true revelation
[47:40] we have to know exactly who jesus christ
[47:43] is for us
[47:45] the father individual in an individual
[47:48] way
[47:49] quelle
[47:53] what is your personal relation with
[47:56] jesus
[48:01] in
[48:01] the believer's position in christ
[48:04] he did
[48:12] it's a composed word they don't only
[48:14] means to be
[48:15] set aside
[48:17] he was talking about sanctification
[48:22] it it it doesn't mean clean but it
[48:25] doesn't only mean clean but it means
[48:27] sets aside for service
[48:33] service it's to be cleaned and set aside
[48:35] for service
[48:40] the altar sanctified the vase and it
[48:43] sets it aside for service
[48:46] you
[48:48] to the saints which are in at that are
[48:51] at ephesus in the faithful in jesus
[48:53] christ
[48:56] see who's addressing it
[49:00] let me read it quietly now listen
[49:04] to jesus
[49:06] did you paul an apostle of jesus christ
[49:08] by the will of god
[49:13] to the saints which are in ephesus and
[49:15] to the faithful in jesus christ of fidel
[49:18] and jesus christ to the faithful in
[49:21] christ jesus
[49:26] exterior these letters addressed to
[49:29] those not to the those outside in the
[49:32] world
[49:35] it's not a sermon
[49:40] paul wasn't preaching to those
[49:42] the unsafe
[49:47] he was preaching it to the saved
[49:52] called out
[49:56] they're separated
[50:01] they're set aside and faithful in the
[50:03] call
[50:05] now
[50:11] that's who's addressing it for in jesus
[50:15] position
[50:18] the believer's position is in christ
[50:31] and
[50:32] christ will only meet the believer the
[50:34] believer can only worship christ as he
[50:37] is positioned positionally placed in
[50:41] christ
[50:43] who says he says
[50:45] i don't believe you get it listen
[50:48] let me go another route go gandhi look
[50:52] at
[51:08] no man has the right to worship the lord
[51:10] outside of the body of the lord jesus
[51:13] christ
[51:14] did you know that
[51:17] personally
[51:19] no one has the right to worship
[51:23] if it's not in christ
[51:28] that's why we have to cry out with all
[51:30] our hearts
[51:32] so we can be first in christ
[51:49] to him the true worship
[51:51] accepted
[51:53] that he will accept our worship
[51:56] on christ in christ
[52:04] god only accepts the worship of those
[52:06] that are in christ
[52:11] that's why preachers
[52:15] if there is a burning desire
[52:20] that people may be in christ
[52:23] because outside of christ
[52:27] we cannot worship
[52:44] god wants us to worship him
[52:48] god created us to worship him
[52:54] but to worship him we have to be in
[52:55] christ
[52:57] outside of christ we are rejoicing
[53:01] but we are not worshiping
[53:05] the true worship
[53:09] is under the blood of jesus christ
[53:19] that's why when jesus was standing
[53:21] before the samaritan samaritan
[53:25] the woman of samaria you didn't love
[53:27] yeah it says the hour comes
[53:31] and the hour is here
[53:34] we're the true worshipers
[53:39] will worship the father in spirit and in
[53:42] truth
[53:46] what is the truth
[53:53] jesus said sanctify them by that word
[53:57] thy word is truth
[54:02] and for an acceptable worship
[54:07] we have to be sure that we are in the
[54:09] world
[54:14] today there are many denominations
[54:19] and every denomination claims to have
[54:21] the truth buster
[54:33] [Music]
[54:36] if we have ten different answers sword
[54:38] legislation
[54:39] or all of the tens are false strategy
[54:42] enough
[54:43] or there's nine that are not true
[54:47] and there's only one that's true
[54:50] regardless
[54:57] some may say well you know every night i
[55:00] see brother billy in bedford so that
[55:01] means he lives in bedford
[55:07] i see him in fort worth in the morning
[55:09] that means he lives in fort worth
[55:12] they can give arguments
[55:15] but that's not where billy lives
[55:21] is only the one who will say that he
[55:23] lives in norfolk hills
[55:25] that will be telling the truth
[55:29] it's the same thing with the word of god
[55:34] the true worship is under the blood
[55:39] like cain and abel
[55:41] they went to worship
[55:46] cain built this altar
[55:49] he put beautiful things
[55:52] he could he could have brought an
[55:53] argument could you ego that god is great
[55:57] that he deserves whatever i have the the
[56:00] most beautiful
[56:02] he
[56:03] he deserves the beautiful
[56:07] but that was not the provided way
[56:11] but abel who had the revelation
[56:14] he took
[56:27] and today god does not accept a worship
[56:31] outside of the blood of jesus christ
[56:34] and when we speak about the blood of
[56:35] jesus christ
[56:40] we know it's not a chemical makeup
[56:46] says that the blood of jesus christ
[56:48] today
[56:50] is the message of the hour
[56:53] you don't have very taboo
[56:55] in the true worship
[56:59] in truth
[57:03] it's only by the word of the hour
[57:09] and when you get into christ
[57:12] christ will give you his spirit
[57:15] it's a promise
[57:17] it says repent
[57:23] that every one of you be baptized in the
[57:25] name of the lord jesus christ
[57:28] for the forgiveness of your sins
[57:31] and you shall receive lord don't you
[57:33] sentence the gift of the holy ghost it
[57:35] is said
[57:37] it says that promise is for your
[57:39] [Music]
[58:06] in having the holy ghost in us
[58:11] that's what god wants before we can
[58:13] worship
[58:15] so we can be good uh acceptable
[58:18] worshippers
[58:38] the stature that was made was of daniel
[58:41] daniel
[58:43] daniel who was the prophet
[58:46] and they knew who daniel was he's the
[58:48] medal
[58:49] [Music]
[59:12] and he brings sometimes the church to
[59:15] worship almost like his pastor
[59:21] and if they give the impression that
[59:23] what the pastor says is more important
[59:25] than what the word says
[59:28] it's more important than what the
[59:30] messenger said
[59:34] but like the three hebrew children
[59:37] by revelation
[59:41] they knew whom the worship belonged to
[59:48] to god himself men who divorced on
[59:50] christmas we have to be in christ to
[59:52] have us
[59:54] to have this true worship
[59:58] he could lose
[1:00:23] when she received the revelation of who
[1:00:26] jesus was
[1:00:28] she worshipped
[1:00:31] what was her worship
[1:00:34] she went back into the city
[1:00:37] she went to testify
[1:00:39] that was worshipped
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:54] now
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:00] i just want to get
[1:01:01] i just want to get a little bit further
[1:01:04] if you will excuse me
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:35] together mean you worship an idol
[1:01:42] you just have to be idol
[1:01:46] doing nothing
[1:01:50] go to church
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] a real born-again man or woman
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:18] they're about to do something
[1:02:20] they are bound to do something you know
[1:02:22] positive they can't hold their peace
[1:02:24] equity listen
[1:02:28] neither be idolaters
[1:02:37] as there were some of them as it's
[1:02:40] written the people sat down to eat and
[1:02:42] drink and they rose up to play
[1:02:48] and
[1:02:49] worship is also to testify of the
[1:02:51] goodness of god
[1:02:56] to testify of this goodness everywhere
[1:02:58] we go
[1:03:00] wherever we
[1:03:20] may god drive that home in this
[1:03:22] tabernacle this morning
[1:03:29] i pray the holy ghost will sink this so
[1:03:32] deep into your heart
[1:03:39] we ought to give the most earnest heat
[1:03:41] to the things which we
[1:03:55] when we see the great jehovah come down
[1:03:57] and do the things that he does
[1:04:05] and see him compared scripture by
[1:04:07] scripture
[1:04:09] that they will that they are the
[1:04:25] and just so un i'm concerned we ought to
[1:04:28] be busy every minute
[1:04:36] we
[1:04:37] trying to get to people to christ we
[1:04:39] ought to be lively stoned
[1:04:44] we should never be swaffled like we are
[1:04:48] lose
[1:04:52] enough
[1:05:02] we will go up to church and we'll see
[1:05:05] the lord jesus do something or bless us
[1:05:08] in such a way
[1:05:14] and then we'll go back home and say
[1:05:16] very nice meeting
[1:05:30] now the preaching of the word
[1:05:33] we enjoy it nisba
[1:05:42] but that's not the main thing
[1:05:46] we know that's the main thing
[1:05:54] we should not worship the lord just
[1:05:56] after
[1:05:57] after we get through the preaching
[1:06:01] as we usually do just
[1:06:04] just worship him
[1:06:07] it's wonderful that's wonderful
[1:06:12] but we should worship him every hour of
[1:06:15] our lives
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:39] if you see
[1:06:40] some of you ladies see a woman in the
[1:06:43] wrong
[1:06:44] i do really
[1:06:47] worship the lord by taking her by by by
[1:06:50] her by taking her and saying
[1:06:54] and saying
[1:06:55] sister
[1:06:57] there's a better way than this
[1:07:07] when you hear a man saying the name of
[1:07:08] the lord in vain
[1:07:11] get a chance ali
[1:07:14] to one side and slip over
[1:07:17] and take him by the hand
[1:07:19] and say
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:24] he said you there is a better way than
[1:07:26] this
[1:07:34] and tell him in a meek gentle way
[1:07:40] all those things is a worship
[1:07:43] economy
[1:07:45] and when we see someone sick they call
[1:07:47] the doctor
[1:07:48] and the doctor says on the purify the
[1:07:51] place no more can be done oh no
[1:07:54] i don't really
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:19] we can worship the lord in testifying
[1:08:33] and he's also able to do it even tonight
[1:08:51] there was an island
[1:08:57] and when sailors were coming across the
[1:08:59] sidelines
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:07] there were a group of women that would
[1:09:10] sing songs that were
[1:09:11] very tantalizing
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:18] that the sailors were attracted to go to
[1:09:21] this island
[1:09:25] and they were in this island people men
[1:09:28] that would stay waiting to ambush
[1:09:31] it
[1:09:33] so when the sailors will come they would
[1:09:35] be ambushed and killed
[1:09:40] but there was a great rover who was
[1:09:42] supposed to cross across that island
[1:09:46] and he asked the sailors that were with
[1:09:48] him
[1:09:50] that they may tie him to a pole
[1:09:55] and to put him to put something in his
[1:09:56] mouth
[1:10:00] and he plucked the ears of the sailors
[1:10:04] and as he was crossing
[1:10:07] him his ears were not plugged
[1:10:12] the song was so attracting
[1:10:18] now he was trying to to tell his sailors
[1:10:21] go on get uh uh go to this place
[1:10:25] but he couldn't speak well
[1:10:27] and the sellers couldn't hear him
[1:10:30] they went to the destination
[1:10:34] and when they got to the destination
[1:10:37] as they were uh going around town
[1:10:41] musicians
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:54] it was so wonderful that he loved it
[1:10:59] and when they were on the way back
[1:11:02] the sailors asked him a question
[1:11:05] do you want us to tie you again
[1:11:08] he says no you don't need to do that
[1:11:19] so when we get into christ did not tell
[1:11:21] him all the places you showed there's so
[1:11:23] many precious things tell a petty to
[1:11:25] show the summoners but the little things
[1:11:27] of this world
[1:11:29] can never attract us anymore
[1:11:33] we don't need to plug our ears anymore
[1:11:36] someone to tie our hands
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:12:02] worship can do a lot of things
[1:12:05] donald said this damn in the old
[1:12:06] testament
[1:12:09] the bible tells us about the story of
[1:12:11] saul don't you live
[1:12:13] it says in the book of uh once uh first
[1:12:16] samuel 16.
[1:12:19] it
[1:12:21] that when is was tormented by evil
[1:12:23] spirit
[1:12:26] they will call this a young child david
[1:12:29] give it
[1:12:30] and he will come and he will play the
[1:12:31] heart
[1:12:33] he will come and play
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:46] worship will cast out the devils
[1:12:59] a true worship
[1:13:15] for the worship of of christian
[1:13:18] musicians
[1:13:20] justly
[1:13:21] instead of it uh casting out devils
[1:13:25] don't see the demon the worship is
[1:13:27] actually causing devils to dance
[1:13:32] people will organize big concerts and
[1:13:34] legends people are dancing
[1:13:37] they are happy
[1:13:40] at the end there's not one soul one to
[1:13:41] christ
[1:13:44] no devil
[1:13:57] and today
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:06] and years ago we used to find people in
[1:14:08] deep sincerity and worship
[1:14:15] and today it's become a big glamour of
[1:14:18] hollywood
[1:14:20] sort of music
[1:14:22] just some kind of trained music it is
[1:14:28] and woman
[1:14:30] up on the platform
[1:14:32] with their clothes tight enough exposed
[1:14:36] the skin of the skin of the tight enough
[1:14:39] the skin of the outside it don't sound
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] and almost making it out an outright
[1:14:56] ridiculous shame
[1:15:00] and professing christianity
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:08] i wonder if our offering hasn't become
[1:15:12] kind of a stench
[1:15:14] in his nose again
[1:15:17] worship
[1:15:18] if you pass back in the concert
[1:15:20] organization
[1:15:21] i don't believe those concert worshipers
[1:15:24] that people organize that they worship
[1:15:26] god
[1:15:27] people are rejoicing
[1:15:30] they rejoice their flesh
[1:15:32] immediately
[1:15:34] even the the acclimation that they are
[1:15:36] looking for
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] but god is looking for sincere worship
[1:15:52] you know
[1:15:56] it's a holy worship
[1:16:02] don't believe the word in the book of
[1:16:04] kings
[1:16:06] we have another story
[1:16:14] there was a king of israel
[1:16:17] the king of judah and the king of dawn
[1:16:30] and then after a while they realized
[1:16:31] they didn't have water
[1:16:36] when they were trying to find
[1:16:38] solution
[1:16:45] the king of judah asked is there no
[1:16:47] prophet here
[1:16:49] god is not very prophetic
[1:16:51] when they went to the prophet elisha
[1:16:56] elisha was mad
[1:16:58] israel against the god of israel
[1:17:01] who was the the ki uh the the son of
[1:17:04] akam
[1:17:06] he was mad
[1:17:11] but he said because of uh jehoshaphat
[1:17:27] someone who can play the arp
[1:17:32] and when they brought someone who knew
[1:17:34] how to play an arp let's pray
[1:17:36] the spirit of the lord
[1:17:38] the the the the anointing
[1:17:41] came down on him
[1:17:52] worship makes the presence of god
[1:17:54] tangible
[1:18:09] god coming down and speaking to each one
[1:18:12] personally with what concerns you
[1:18:17] when we worship sincerely
[1:18:23] when we before we come to church we pray
[1:18:25] we want god to speak to us
[1:18:29] foreign the preacher doesn't know what's
[1:18:31] going on with you
[1:18:33] he preaches to jokes
[1:18:37] or the preacher on the side is that just
[1:18:38] praying for god to give him an
[1:18:40] inspiration
[1:18:43] something that could help the people
[1:18:45] julie donald's feelings god gives him
[1:18:47] the inspiration
[1:18:51] but that inspiration could be the answer
[1:18:53] to your problems
[1:18:55] that we are doing because you worship
[1:18:59] because you have contact with him
[1:19:03] it's like we heard the last time
[1:19:07] when cornelius was praying on one side
[1:19:12] god went to peter on the other side
[1:19:20] eunuch was over here with his bible on
[1:19:23] the side
[1:19:25] god went to philip
[1:19:29] as we worship
[1:19:33] we are in contact with god god lose our
[1:19:36] problems when we have a problem
[1:19:39] god gives us the solution
[1:19:42] god tells us something
[1:19:44] god speaks to us
[1:19:47] but this worship
[1:19:51] can only be in christ
[1:19:56] as he said to the woman from samaria
[1:20:01] in spirit and in truth
[1:20:06] this the truth we have
[1:20:09] god has been gracious to us in this end
[1:20:12] time
[1:20:16] he gave us the complete revelation of
[1:20:18] the word
[1:20:22] but most times we spend a lot of time
[1:20:24] doing other things
[1:20:27] then looking into the scriptures
[1:20:36] this truth that's bringing us to the
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:40] worship
[1:20:43] it's true the bible says
[1:20:54] the scripture says that let all of them
[1:20:57] that breathe
[1:21:12] and god wants to be worshipped through
[1:21:15] you look in the musician as the musician
[1:21:17] come
[1:21:18] there's only situation
[1:21:21] in the statue of the perfect man will
[1:21:23] read
[1:21:24] but one of them says
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:40] uh phillips spoke of the solomon's
[1:21:44] temple building
[1:21:50] and the most high
[1:21:51] don't dwell in the temple made with
[1:21:53] hands
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:17] god dwells in the stature of a man
[1:22:22] reflecting himself into this that being
[1:22:27] perfect perfect worship
[1:22:30] god in us
[1:22:33] being established
[1:22:35] manifesto god
[1:22:46] oh how we could stay on that till you
[1:22:49] would almost suffocate in
[1:23:02] today christ has no body on earth except
[1:23:05] your body
[1:23:09] christ has no mouth on earth if it's if
[1:23:12] it's not your mouth
[1:23:16] god has no feet if it's not your feet
[1:23:23] if jesus wants to do something on earth
[1:23:26] today
[1:23:28] he's obligated to use you
[1:23:31] it's the fella and that's what worship
[1:23:33] is
[1:23:35] and then we become worshipers
[1:23:38] the the the witnesses
[1:23:42] because it says in a little while
[1:23:45] the world will not see me
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:24:00] and
[1:24:13] otherwise you like the world
[1:24:30] for the for
[1:24:31] worship
[1:24:34] so we can be worshippers
[1:24:36] wherever we are
[1:24:39] wherever we go
[1:24:41] we have to worship god
[1:24:44] we can worship him in songs
[1:24:47] not just to listen
[1:24:49] but to worship him yourself
[1:24:52] we can worship him in prayer
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:56] we can worship him in testimonies
[1:25:00] we can worship him in living a holy life
[1:25:06] we can worship him in becoming true
[1:25:08] witnesses
[1:25:11] we can become a billboard for god
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] god wants our worship

[1:32:02] again
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:15] you know what a beautiful
[1:32:17] reminder
[1:32:18] that really our worship starts when we
[1:32:20] wake up
[1:32:24] church world kind of
[1:32:26] has brought us to the place where we
[1:32:28] think we go to church to worship
[1:32:33] we go to church to be corrected
[1:32:36] to receive the word
[1:32:38] but we worship in the morning
[1:32:42] when the sun rises that's when we
[1:32:44] worship
[1:32:45] our life is a worship what a
[1:32:48] what a true thing that we really need to
[1:32:51] remember
[1:32:52] and really let it set on our heart that
[1:32:57] that
[1:32:58] when we least think of it
[1:33:01] is when we're really worshiping
[1:33:03] when our real thoughts and our real
[1:33:05] attitudes and our real emotions
[1:33:09] are pouring out there from the daily
[1:33:11] living
[1:33:12] that's our true worship
[1:33:14] amen as our brother admonished us let's
[1:33:17] be true worshipers
[1:33:18] something that reflects the
[1:33:20] true message of the hour in our life
[1:33:23] that really stands forth
[1:33:25] as a true worship i appreciate that word
[1:33:28] and
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:31] you know many times we we hear the word
[1:33:34] of god
[1:33:35] speak of things and
[1:33:38] we just
[1:33:39] think it's he's talking about everybody
[1:33:41] else
[1:33:42] but you know really i think more often
[1:33:44] he's talking to each of us individually
[1:33:47] and receiving that word is what's truth
[1:33:51] so may god
[1:33:52] really let that set in our heart deep
[1:33:55] and i really appreciated the quotes
[1:33:57] that were read so
[1:34:01] that's what means a lot to us is
[1:34:04] you know
[1:34:07] worship starts when the music stops
[1:34:12] worship starts when the door is locked
[1:34:14] on the church house
[1:34:16] worship starts when it comes from your
[1:34:18] heart
[1:34:19] in your life
[1:34:21] and
[1:34:22] even the lord said that the father would
[1:34:25] have us love one another
[1:34:27] even above loving him that's true
[1:34:29] worship
[1:34:31] how can you say that you love god and
[1:34:33] hate your brother
[1:34:35] it's impossible
[1:34:37] so let's just continue to strive
[1:34:41] and i know when the drums are beaten and
[1:34:44] the people are shouting it kind of makes
[1:34:46] you feel little
[1:34:47] but god's not looking at that
[1:34:50] he's looking at this still small voice
[1:34:53] in your heart
[1:34:54] that wants to put him first
[1:34:57] so lord richly bless you amen
[1:35:00] amen once again we
[1:35:02] want to thank you for your
[1:35:04] patience our
[1:35:07] our parking lots
[1:35:09] tore up but if you notice it's getting a
[1:35:12] little flatter every day
[1:35:15] and one day now we need you know we
[1:35:18] we prayed for dirt and god gave us dirt
[1:35:22] and i think you know some of it's my
[1:35:24] fault that
[1:35:26] i should have recognized that if he give
[1:35:28] us something he he knew what to give us
[1:35:31] and i thought oh we better get more dirt
[1:35:33] well
[1:35:34] all that dirt out there is my dirt it's
[1:35:37] not god's dirt it's his dirt but
[1:35:40] he didn't put it there i did and so now
[1:35:43] i've asked him to help me
[1:35:45] get rid of it
[1:35:48] so
[1:35:48] you know i don't have no place to go
[1:35:51] so lord forgive me
[1:35:53] for my
[1:35:54] failures and once again
[1:35:58] you know satan got me in trouble but
[1:36:00] jesus got me out
[1:36:02] you know we have a letter on our church
[1:36:05] door about the weeds and the sidewalk
[1:36:08] so brother andrew faithfully goes out
[1:36:11] there and gets all the weeds out for us
[1:36:13] and you drive down the streets and
[1:36:15] there's weeds on every sidewalk in
[1:36:18] town
[1:36:19] but you know what
[1:36:22] it's in his hands amen
[1:36:25] amen if god be for you
[1:36:28] who can be against you let's go let our
[1:36:30] light shine amen let's bow our heads our
[1:36:33] gracious father
[1:36:36] lord many times we
[1:36:38] find ourselves in spots that
[1:36:44] when we miss you that
[1:36:48] and we don't
[1:36:51] keep you in mind
[1:36:54] and we don't place you first
[1:36:59] and we don't consider
[1:37:01] that your hand is in things
[1:37:04] we find our hands
[1:37:06] in place of yours
[1:37:09] and we find our outcome
[1:37:12] instead of your outcome
[1:37:15] but lord we thank you
[1:37:18] that you've never stopped being mindful
[1:37:20] of us
[1:37:22] you never stop doing things perfectly
[1:37:26] and lord
[1:37:27] we worship you for that
[1:37:30] and lord we find many times that we have
[1:37:34] to face our own
[1:37:37] decisions and our own
[1:37:40] mistakes
[1:37:42] but lord that doesn't
[1:37:44] take anything from you because you do
[1:37:47] all things perfect
[1:37:49] so many times we have to come to you
[1:37:51] lord and ask for your help again
[1:37:56] because we missed
[1:37:58] your tender
[1:38:00] kindness but lord i'm thankful that
[1:38:04] you're a god that doesn't hold us
[1:38:06] against it
[1:38:08] lord you just work your way
[1:38:10] through our will and
[1:38:13] you'll work
[1:38:15] through your permissive will to bring it
[1:38:17] back to your perfect will
[1:38:20] and lord i want to thank you for it and
[1:38:22] i want to thank you for all that you do
[1:38:26] and lord we know that you can do
[1:38:28] wonderful things
[1:38:30] and we continue to ask you to do
[1:38:32] wonderful things
[1:38:34] father turn our failures into great
[1:38:36] rewards
[1:38:38] father if not for us for others
[1:38:41] lord that you can do a great thing i
[1:38:44] just ask for your mercy and continue
[1:38:46] guidance
[1:38:47] father may we all be aware
[1:38:50] that our lights our candles
[1:38:53] set upon a hill
[1:38:55] and people are watching our actions far
[1:38:57] above our words
[1:38:59] and that's what our brother is telling
[1:39:01] us it's not our words that make worship
[1:39:04] it's our action that makes worship
[1:39:07] and father we ask that our actions
