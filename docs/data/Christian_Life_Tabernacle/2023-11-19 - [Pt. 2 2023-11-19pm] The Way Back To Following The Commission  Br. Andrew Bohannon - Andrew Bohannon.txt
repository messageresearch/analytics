Description:
The Way Back To Following The Commission
Br. Andrew Bohannon 
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 19, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
until I come to be a Christian myself you know so growing up I was just like when she said that she trusted the Lord I just left it there and you know the good thing is is um the Lord used that to to teach me something about what he planted that's what we all want we want God to teach us about something that he planted on us inside I love how brother brother Tom when he preached he said he's you know he's here the Miracles and the different things in your life it wasn't because you mentally powered yourself into it there was a force on the inside by the way of a predestinated seed where the spirit of God overshadowed that seed and brought it to life I love that because if any predestinated seed serves its purpose it's promised the resurrection that's what we're looking for the great Rapture the resurrection I want to serve it with all I got every ambition every hurt every trial every Victory amen so I just uh I thank the Lord that he brought me through that because it taught me a little bit about yielding and and um going past the conception of where we limit God sometimes we handcuff God and I thought about Moses you know and and maybe I'll share some of the you know a quote out of that uh perfect strength by Perfect weakness but you know that's how we all come to that place where if in our fulfilling the commission and going into all the world we have to take our eyes off ourselves and we have to look to the one who spoke to us and made the promise you know we can't go and fulfill it if we've never had that personal contact and so I say that that we all have to have that backside of the desert experience amen because if we don't if we don't have anything to share you know like as far as an experience it's just Doctrine which is fine but we're believing for a real genuine experience with God and so as you know just to see how God would speak a little something and then just to do what he said and then see how One Soul after the other after the other after the other because God had given me insight to his Divine will that she was not going to come out of that hospital alive I began to speak to each one of my cousins and different ones and before there was any signs of really death upon her she was just having shortness of breath they gave her some oxygen and she was fine so I I really looked out of sorts when I'm coming at her with that that angle and so um you know as time passed like a day or two things started to change but thankfully I I was able to talk to I have five older cousins on my mom's sister my Aunt Sandy and so I was able to talk with them and I said you know pre-venture you know you don't have another opportunity to share your heart with Grandmother if something was to turn and drastically change is there something you need to make right you you know is there something that if if this was your last moment to say thank you or or to settle something or or whatever like if you knew tomorrow that one of your dear loved ones would cross over the Border cross over the chasm and God spoke to you and said it's in your hands you can speak life into that situation it's in your hands we have that we have that now God is he's saying like we we're not guaranteed tomorrow and so we got to have the love of God for somebody else despite what it feels like looks like what they might think but you have the words of life you you know we're the last voice to the last age under our messenger this voice that we've heard when we come subject and it's our life now it's our very essence of life so when they inquire of us why do you not go to the ball games and drink like you used to why don't you you know associate at the drunken revelries why don't you still you were a fighter why don't you still when they talk bad about you why don't you just knock them out you know why don't you do this and why don't you do that well I've had a change I've invited the Creator God he saved me from myself amen my the way back to following the commission you I think that we have to keep our eyes focused on that purpose amen praise the Lord you know I just think about the scripture I'll read it in First Kings you can turn with me there you know we're like Brother David quoted the scripture don't you know that you're the Temple of the Living God you know it was it was God's desire to have himself a a body without made without hands and you know we have to go like brother Dave was saying we're going backwards in the church ages you know we're coming through the justification the sanctification and now we're possessing all the the enemy stole amen but in in First Kings chapter 2 I love the words of how David was speaking you know because we know that you know David desired to build a house for the Ark of God and he was told right he was told David do all that's in your heart for God is with you you know it's a comfort to know that God is with us amen but there's a will of God to be performed and obeyed and so in First Kings chapter 2 and we'll start with verse one he said now the days of David Drew nigh and that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the Earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in in his ways and to keep his statutes and his Commandments and his judgments and his testimonies and is written as it is written in the laws of Mo in the law of Moses that thou mayest prosper in all thou doest and whatever whether soever thou turnest thyself and the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying If thy children take heed to their we to their way to walk before for me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee he said a man on the throne of Israel amen and we know there's a man here that can turn on the light you know if you're struggling if you're Desiring God wants to take the Throne of our heart he wants to bring the light of Shalom to us amen God is here to bring peace in the midst of our trials in our storms STS in our difficults in the good times in the in between he wants to say I got a word for you to follow after me if we could do like David told Solomon and just keep the charge of the Lord thy God see it wasn't just David's God David was saying keep the charge of the Lord thy God there's no grandchildren in the economy of God God has sons and daughters so if your mother and your father have a testimony what about you if your grandparents have it but you need it it's for you let's take our eyes off ourselves and let's take it and put it back on the one who made the promise amen that's where we're going to get the victory we want to look to what he what he did when he died on the cross why did he die what was the purpose you know to God if we had two of the literal drops of his blood what good would it do us right I mean it it might do somebody some good but to God the purchase was even more valuable oh think about it your salvation your Redemption is more valuable to him because what it did is it set us on a path back to God back to Oneness with God Amen is't that wonderful you know I think that's part of the struggle so much for me and I believe for believers is like Moses you know when you're in the journey you know he said you know who am I you ever feel yourself saying something like that you know who am I you know and it's not who am I it's what God has given us when he may contact with us that's the testimony is what God has done for us he showed us that he died he laid his life down no man taketh my life I give it as a ransom and he's worthy to give all you know this is out of um perfect strength by Perfect weakness I'll just jump in right here and just this will probably be the close but he says this in 160 he says but there's one thing Moses had that I admire he had the sense enough to know that he was licked we haven't that's all we make a new denomination we get somebody else with a healing gift or something the Pentecost you see we just don't know enough to realize that we're licked the Pentecostal Church the Assemblies of God the United the rest of them seems like they haven't got the ability to know that they're licked hallelujah oh I wish I could get I wish I could make that stick they are licked the church organization is licked just the same as the United States is licked trembling fearing the bombs hanging Yonder for them they know that they're dancing away and dating their life to Hell dated their life to hell and they were trees of young men to the army they seen what happened on the other one they're licked the church is licked they know it Moses realized it then he knew enough then and God took him back in the back in the wilderness to learn some human weaknesses he took him back to learn what it was all about so well did he learn oh my did you ever get a lesson God must have had a time with him back there you know Moses had a temper God gave him a wife by the name of Zapora she had one too could you imagine everything wasn't so pleasing back there on the back side of the desert for a while they both were their tempers got out of control at the same time I I suppose his intellectual conceptions of how psychology ought to control a person didn't do good because when they were on the road down to Egypt he sees Zapora still had a temper she cut the foreskin of her son and threw it before Moses and said you're a bloody husband to me mine and God was so angry with him he looked at him he he he looked for him in the end and he could have found him and slay him I guess there's a little thing God had to teach him back there see that he was human all of his wisdom of Egypt and all the powers of intellect intellectual God could not use one of them you come and say now Lord I've been schooled 40 years now I'm an elect intellectual student I can quote the Bible with my eyes closed God can't use a bit of that see no oh I belong to the biggest church in the country I'm the this Lord oh I'm Pentecostal glory to God I've got I've received the Holy Ghost the other night Hallelujah you're going to make me do so and so oh my God can't use a bit of that whenever you get licked and realize you're lick and then you come back come on back and humble yourself get weak find out you're human and then nobody's and none of your intellectuals can do it human weaknesses will never be used of God God by human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself oh I love that amen you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way amen man what's the purpose Lord I got to get to that place where all my weaknesses I'm just committing them to God I know you can't use those get yourself out of the way Moses he learned he learned human weaknesses real good he learned it was so well till when God called him he had seven weaknesses he can argue against the call God's call did you ever study it in the first part of Exodus the seven weaknesses I got them written down here I want you to listen to them the first weakness he had was a lack of message now after we share these with you none of us have this excuse because there's a Moses in each side one of us we have human we're human I can't fulfill what God commissioned me to do but we can't make excuses you know I know that we've been invited to this feast and it's n it's natural for us to make excuses not to come and let him lead us to the Fountain let us lead us to be transformed the second weakness he has was the lack of authority the third weakness was the lack of eloquence I can't talk there's a Moses in each side of one of us the fourth one is adaption the fifth one was success the sixth one was Acceptance Now now you compare yours to his and see if you come out up with that see if you can get a weak as he was Lord I I ain't no good I can't speak I slew an Egyptian I can't go back and everything they won't receive me I've got no message I've got I can't speak I'm slow to speech see how he was he was nothing brother he was cured am yeah God could use him then after he was cured yeah yes and he had used him after he got him cured and we find that the my PhD lldd and dou LD or whatever you might it might be all my degrees is nothing God can't use them amen you know I just think that that's so special because you know when you think about in each one of us you know the devil always with reasonings tries to get us to accept some kind of reason not to fulfill the purpose that God has for each one of us and it's just our time to take inventory and to say have I invited any excuse not to do what he said you know we have by the promise to overcome that amen because he placed the Overcomer in you he says I've already overcome all the world and I'm in you if you'll just look it's the kingdom of God is within us so when we pray we pray to the god the Overcomer that is in us we're not going to make excuses of this old pest house you know My Five Senses my inward senses but if we'll believe for the impossibility because with man it's impossible but there's a man on the inside that can turn on the light could shine the light in this Dark Age if we're willing we can enter in pass the excuses tonight and let God live amen you believe that you believe it with all your heart amen why don't we stand you know as we go forward in this Great Commission let's keep our eyes on the one who gave the promise he said I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world Amen and God he's placed something in that seed he placed that craving that thirst and if we'll just let him lead their spiritual food in the storehouse not only for us as a body but as as individuals I believe that God wants to take that thirst that desire that appetite that is inside the seed and if we'll let him lead he'll fulfill it and it'll be the satisfying portion amen why don't we bow our hearts together if you feel that you just want to release something to the Lord tonight and you want to raise your hand and say this has been an excuse and I just want to lift my hand and give it to you today Lord and say um brother Andrew what good is lifting my hands about this thing that is in my way well why don't you try it and see taste to see if the Lord will respond to your sincerity Heavenly Father Lord here where we are as a body as a church Lord we've been called out of the world Lord to display the true and living God lord lord there's been traps set up for us and try to give us reasons and excuses to not carry out and keep the charge that you've commissioned us as individuals but we're laying them down we're lifting them up to you Lord saying take them Lord take our excuses take our weaknesses father we want to bring glory and honor to Your Great Name so as we commit the people to you and these needs Desiring that the transforming power the Divine exchange Lord we can take and lay our ashes our filthy rags upon your altar surely you're the only one that can cleanse it and make it new so we pray your blessings upon the people Lord have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen let's sing this song Oh [Music] yes the world and Shar and show mey in [Music] is make me a reflection of your is that what what you want the day star to shine sh Down Let Your Love

in the night do you see the world is dying let's sing that next verse but I see the world is dying wounded by the master of the broken in the darkness haunted by the years of past de but I see you stand standing near me Lord shining with compassion in your life this the Shine Let Your Love Shine through me in the night one more [Music] time leave me Lord Our Father any way you open [Music] the oh Lord I want to be your [Music] [Applause] [Music] witness amen amen amen I know that's your heart's desire you wanted to make an opportunity for anybody who wanted to give their heart to the Lord or if you want prayer we're going to take this opportunity before we close this service and we invite brother Billy to come maybe sing another song and I just wanted to give that opportunity it's such a late hour and such a desperate time and God is making his children so one with his word I I wanted to read this and this is out of the Samaritan Church age but Samaritan means bitter and they derive the word mura mura was used to embalm the dead thus the two-fold significance found in the name of this age it was bitter and filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the church was drifted far apart with an increased bitterness towards the True Vine and the part of the false death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was creeping a paralysis and an imp impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost and no True Believer is any stronger or spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the Pew word of God amen that's praise the Lord Brother Billy if you [Music] coming aren't you thankful for his word amen is it's not looking for what is human what we can produce what we can come up with and how well we can conduct ourselves by ourselves he's only looking to what his word can produce in us it's not looking for human strength or human weakness in fact it's by the weakness he takes and he makes his strength perfect he wants us to take his word to take his way his provided way and use it and let that provided way take hold of our human mind our human uh uh abilities and all the human weakness and take that and produce something that only God can do our Pastor said if it's intellect you'll find somebody with more intellect than what you have if it's by explanation you'll find someone who can explain better than you can but if it's by something that God did in your heart no one can ever take that away from you you can stand there and say I I was sick and God healed me I used to desire the things of the world but he took that away from me he caused me to be a son and that's how God works but often time we are drawn to intellect and learning things we don't know and all and that's wonderful as long as we let the spirit of God come upon us and change us so the word of God could be manifested through us us that he himself can come because the promise of the father is I will come in you and I will dwell in you the works that I did ye shall do also oh my how we need that promise tonight father come and dwell in us that every work that we could do everything that we can that can come out of our mouth Let It Be by you and not by Our Own Strength amen KC amen amen I will loveer up my life in spirit and true all P out de your love

just reminded of what the pastor was saying this morning Lord how we're not just supposed to be hearers of the word but doers of the word we supposed to have that Faith like they had back in the beginning Lord in the beginning of your church whenever they didn't have a Bible or books or tapes although we have it now and we have we have a word that's coming our day that we're supposed to speak but it's the faith it's the experience that they had that they that they could go up to somebody like the man that was laying at the gate beautiful and give what they had to to him Lord without giving him some sort of a a book maybe like your like the pastor was saying maybe as an excuse just just giving him something to appease a religious Duty instead they gave him power to get up and walk yes so that he could go and receive the same experience that they got that's right and Lord we [Music] just we're just so thankful Lord for that word that came forth this morning Lord let us live it Lord give us the power to make it live Lord that's my prayer Lord I just ask that you would send us home Lord and keep us safe Lord on the road and just bring us back to the house of God lord ready to
