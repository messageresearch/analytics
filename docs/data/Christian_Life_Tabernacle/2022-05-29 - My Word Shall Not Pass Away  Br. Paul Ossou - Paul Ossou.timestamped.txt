[41:52] he says in and
[41:55] and thou shall speak and say before the
[41:57] lord thy god
[41:59] a syrian ready to perish was my father
[42:04] and he went down into egypt and
[42:06] sojourned there
[42:08] with a few
[42:10] and became there a nation great
[42:13] mighty and populous
[42:15] and and the egypt egyptians evil
[42:20] in threaded us
[42:22] and afflicted us and laid upon us laid
[42:25] upon our has
[42:27] hard bondage
[42:29] and when we cried unto the lord god of
[42:31] our fathers
[42:32] the lord heard our voice
[42:35] and looked
[42:36] on our affliction and our labor
[42:39] and our oppression
[42:40] and the lord brought us out of egypt
[42:43] with a mighty hand
[42:44] and with an outstretched harm
[42:47] with a great
[42:48] terribleness
[42:50] and with signs and with wonders
[42:52] and he had brought us into this place
[42:55] and had given us this land even the land
[42:58] that flows with milk and honey
[43:05] let's open in matthew
[43:08] verse 20 chapter 24

[44:23] [Music]
[44:26] i don't plan
[44:27] my preaching in advance
[44:32] you please
[44:36] most times i i i it's when i pray when i
[44:39] study when i i try to find the mind of
[44:42] the lord
[44:46] this morning after the wonderful service
[44:48] we heard this morning
[44:53] at the end brother billy came to me and
[44:56] said if you we're going to go say hi to
[44:58] brother david
[45:02] and when he got there he looked at him
[45:04] and said he's gonna he's gonna preach

[45:11] when i went home
[45:12] i prayed the lord
[45:16] and when i opened my bible i came across
[45:19] the scripture in deuteronomy
[45:24] and the lord placed all my heart some
[45:26] things say something small
[45:29] that i would like to share with you
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] um i had gotten it from matthew chapter
[45:37] 24.
[45:41] and i want to i title it my words
[45:45] will shall not pass away
[45:50] and i believe it was a great blessing
[45:52] for us this morning
[45:57] the sermon that was preached this
[45:59] morning it was a really great blessing
[46:05] where we understand that everything is
[46:07] uncertain
[46:10] everything that's in the world is
[46:12] uncertain
[46:15] there's only one thing that's certain
[46:18] it's a word of god
[46:22] and there's only one place where we
[46:23] could be sure
[46:42] the bible is telling us about the
[46:44] children of abraham
[46:45] father
[46:47] these children of abraham in the flesh
[46:53] where once they arrived in the promised
[46:55] land
[46:57] under the first certain shoes god asked
[47:00] them to do certain things
[47:03] and in deuteronomy 26
[47:07] god was talking to them about the first
[47:09] fruits
[47:11] but in bringing that first fruit
[47:16] god asked them to pronounce those words
[47:20] that we read
[47:24] that was supposed to
[47:26] bring them to remembrance of who they
[47:28] were
[47:30] who was abraham
[47:32] uh uh he was a pagan a syrian he was a
[47:36] syrian king
[47:50] god
[48:34] yes we were like these incapable people
[48:39] who had
[48:40] failed in the things of the world
[48:43] by god by his grace
[48:46] god
[48:55] and he called us like he called abraham
[48:59] and he made and he gave a promise to
[49:01] abraham
[49:04] he said words to abraham
[49:09] when abraham didn't have a child
[49:14] in posterity god promised him that it
[49:17] will have her posterity
[49:22] and god told him about his children
[49:24] being in bondage
[49:30] and god even determined how long they
[49:32] were going to be in bondage
[49:36] when abraham didn't ever
[49:37] have a child
[49:39] god pronounced those words
[50:01] the children of israel they found
[50:03] themselves in in slavery in egypt
[50:09] when the time determined by god came to
[50:12] pass jesus
[50:15] god came and he brought him out by these
[50:18] mighty hands on his true design on the
[50:20] shelf with using a a man of flesh
[50:38] to fulfill that promise
[50:43] and god brought the children of israel
[50:46] out of egypt
[50:49] to bring them into the promised land
[50:53] [Music]
[50:54] a land that was flowing with milk and
[50:56] honey
[50:59] but god wanted the children of israel
[51:04] for them to see the goodness of god in
[51:07] that
[51:09] that's why when we read here
[51:13] it's god who's asking them to speak this
[51:16] word
[51:17] what abraham said
[51:20] what we
[51:21] [Applause]
[51:30] every time we think about what god has
[51:32] done for us
[51:36] when we think about what god has
[51:38] pronounced for each and every one of us
[51:42] and how that god brought it to pass
[51:45] certainty we are going to continue to be
[51:48] certain
[51:51] but if we forget the things that god had
[51:53] done
[51:55] we will not never be certain of that god
[51:59] says
[52:01] in question and answer on genesis
[52:06] it says now look
[52:08] don
[52:11] look back in the old testament
[52:15] when you see the plague falling
[52:19] they were in egypt
[52:26] and god was bringing his people out of
[52:28] the promise
[52:35] and israel never received one plague she
[52:38] used to come to play just as the plagues
[52:41] avocado
[52:43] before it went is
[53:13] no storm was there no lightning was
[53:15] there
[53:17] no killings
[53:20] no killing of cattle was there
[53:26] and everything they had was preserved in
[53:29] goshen
[53:30] is that right
[53:36] it's the type of the church that's going
[53:39] just before the tribulation
[53:57] the same way that god fulfill his word
[53:59] with the children of israel
[54:03] we too are in exodus
[54:08] but in this exodus
[54:11] complete the shows he knows that
[54:13] promised us
[54:14] god has fulfilled the things that he
[54:16] promised in this time
[54:21] god has already sent us our moses
[54:26] god has already revealed to us all his
[54:28] word
[54:33] when the world is shaking about all the
[54:35] things that's happening around the world
[54:40] when the world is being hit by all the
[54:42] things the plagues and everything that's
[54:44] happening
[54:47] we know that god promised
[54:50] for his people
[54:52] for you and i ila
[54:54] he already spoke those words
[55:00] that those plagues are not about us
[55:05] that when god will hit the earth
[55:09] israel that israel israel's spiritual
[55:13] spiritual israel
[55:15] is going to be put to the side
[55:18] that god
[55:20] [Music]
[55:25] before the tribulation can come up on
[55:27] this earth let's just say
[55:30] people are
[55:32] caught up in the things that's happening
[55:33] around the world
[55:37] there's those that are saying oh that's
[55:38] the beginning of tribulation
[55:42] that that tribulation will not start
[55:44] talking
[55:47] as long as you and i are here on earth
[55:49] but the job for me because god promised
[55:53] that before the tribulation is fully
[55:55] here on earth
[55:57] that he will take his bride away
[56:01] but what god wants second loser
[56:05] is that we be certain
[56:08] that we are part of this bride
[56:14] all that the devil is doing
[56:19] is to bring us to a place where we
[56:21] become uncertain
[56:24] they want you to ask your questions
[56:28] should i am i really a son of god
[56:32] do all the things that's happening is
[56:34] that really am i really a son of god
[56:36] i pledge allegiance if god called you in
[56:38] this message
[56:41] the scripture says that no one comes to
[56:43] me
[56:46] unless my father has called him first
[56:48] calculus
[56:50] regardless of your failures
[56:53] regardless of your your failures
[57:01] [Applause]
[57:09] to bring you to perfection confess
[57:12] that you may confess those things
[57:17] not to believe the things that the devil
[57:19] is telling you
[57:22] not to tell you what the world not to
[57:24] believe what the world is presenting to
[57:26] you
[57:28] it's uncertain
[57:31] one thing is certain
[57:33] it's the word of god
[57:37] i heard about it
[57:51] he said i want to stay in
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:06] will never pass
[58:10] the devil is nothing but a
[58:12] scarecrow
[58:14] he's a bluffer
[58:20] he wants you to to be caught up in some
[58:23] type of fear
[58:26] do you believe that you can't move
[58:28] forward
[58:31] he wants you to see with a natural eye
[58:33] evolution
[58:47] we are going to stay or remain in what
[58:50] that which is intellectual
[58:53] but god wants us to be certain of him
[58:58] but to know that everything that he said
[59:02] he's able to bring it to pass yeah
[59:05] look at the children of israel
[59:09] they came out of egypt with a mighty
[59:11] hand
[59:14] god showed them great miracles
[59:17] [Applause]
[59:26] how that god came and he annihilated the
[59:29] egyptians and
[59:31] of something and when they came out
[59:33] jealous
[59:36] god told them that he was taking them in
[59:38] a promised land
[59:42] he told them he was bringing them to a
[59:43] land that flows with milk and honey
[59:47] they get into the wilderness
[59:51] regardless of everything that they have
[59:53] seen as a miracle
[59:55] regardless of all the power that was
[59:57] displayed before
[1:00:14] the same god when the egyptians came
[1:00:16] closer in certain temples
[1:00:20] he came and he stood between the
[1:00:22] children of israel and the egyptians
[1:00:27] on the side of egyptian was completely
[1:00:29] dark
[1:00:31] on their side there was light
[1:00:34] but when they get into the wilderness
[1:00:38] when they came before the temptations
[1:00:56] we know how that god took us out of the
[1:00:58] world into this message
[1:01:02] but some things when some temptation
[1:01:04] comes about
[1:01:06] the same god who makes the devil can
[1:01:08] make you believe because
[1:01:11] that that god becomes incapable we are
[1:01:13] insulting
[1:01:15] but there's one thing that god cannot do
[1:01:19] and that's to fail it don't match you
[1:01:21] and that same god
[1:01:24] who brought us into this message
[1:01:29] he's the same god who's able to take us
[1:01:31] to the promised land
[1:01:33] regardless of what comes in our way
[1:01:36] calculated
[1:01:38] regardless of how hard the trials are
[1:01:40] yeah
[1:01:42] look at the children of israel
[1:01:44] when they come into the world and ask
[1:01:46] joseph what explore recipes uh joshua
[1:01:50] sends them to go and explore the land
[1:01:53] they went and explored the land
[1:01:56] they saw it
[1:01:59] that it was a land that was flowing with
[1:02:01] milk and honey
[1:02:04] we are all convinced because of message
[1:02:07] that this message is the truth
[1:02:11] we are all convinced because the message
[1:02:13] that jeremiah that is this message it's
[1:02:17] god himself who preaches some
[1:02:32] the same as the children of israel had
[1:02:34] to prove that that land was flowing with
[1:02:37] milk and honey
[1:02:39] but it was in that land
[1:02:43] just like the same way in our everyday
[1:02:45] lives
[1:03:00] it was two groups of people
[1:03:04] it was 10 of them on one side
[1:03:08] they saw the milk and the honey
[1:03:14] but their eyes were focused on the sons
[1:03:17] of anak may have a desert but there were
[1:03:19] two others
[1:03:22] they saw the milk and the honey love
[1:03:27] and their eyes were only fixed on the
[1:03:29] milk and the honey
[1:03:31] why but they caught this okay
[1:03:34] because when they left egypt
[1:03:37] they told them that this land
[1:03:40] it was a land that was flowing with milk
[1:03:43] and honey
[1:03:45] everything that they didn't tell him in
[1:03:47] the world
[1:03:49] it wasn't the problem
[1:03:52] that may be the sons of animals
[1:03:54] they may be whatever there is
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:09] because his word will never pass away
[1:04:14] when these things begin to discourage
[1:04:16] the people
[1:04:18] joshua and caleb
[1:04:20] they said shut up
[1:04:23] you know that god told us
[1:04:27] that in that land
[1:04:29] that there was milk and honey that was
[1:04:31] flowing
[1:04:33] did you see the milk and the honey that
[1:04:35] was flowing
[1:04:36] yesterday
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:23] it says now there are many that pretend
[1:05:26] to be in there
[1:05:30] there are there are many that are
[1:05:32] wearing themselves out they are ruining
[1:05:35] themselves
[1:05:38] trying to live right and trying to press
[1:05:41] him
[1:05:43] i i don't know about that merciful
[1:05:48] but if there are in there
[1:05:55] it's just as easy to live a christian
[1:05:58] life as it is to live any life
[1:06:01] basketball
[1:06:03] because you are in christ
[1:06:09] and nothing else but so nothing else but
[1:06:13] so full of the holy ghost leading you
[1:06:24] and why sure you you you'll make
[1:06:26] mistakes and fall if you feel
[1:06:29] the fault
[1:06:30] you
[1:06:57] you will believe that that same god is
[1:06:59] still faithful
[1:07:01] for me god everything that he promised
[1:07:05] down in the promised land he's talking
[1:07:06] about
[1:07:07] everything that he promised more it's
[1:07:10] the rapture
[1:07:12] that i may fall short of living i'm
[1:07:14] gonna stand up
[1:07:16] i'm not gonna remain down
[1:07:21] because i have a promise
[1:07:26] but you can't stay down
[1:07:29] please gonna papa ferdinand
[1:07:32] and sycamore because no more
[1:07:35] than you can make a sticker corn of of
[1:07:39] sycamore tree vulnerable
[1:07:54] one of the greatest curses on the church
[1:07:56] today
[1:07:58] is fear
[1:08:03] everybody is scared to death
[1:08:06] it's what's going to happen
[1:08:24] the only question we have gelatin as god
[1:08:27] said it see we if it's yes
[1:08:30] then that's good enough for us
[1:08:32] then we go forward with him
[1:08:35] because we are certain
[1:08:37] that if he said it
[1:08:39] he's gonna hold his word
[1:08:42] he will keep his promise
[1:08:45] he will he will go with us until the end
[1:08:50] and everything is that everything that's
[1:08:52] outside of what he said
[1:08:55] has no place in our lives
[1:09:00] because his word will never pass away
[1:09:13] but god wants us to be like joshua and
[1:09:15] caleb
[1:09:18] and no doubt in your life there's
[1:09:20] mountains
[1:09:22] there's the sons of annex
[1:09:26] god said if you say to this mountain
[1:09:31] and brother is commenting on that and
[1:09:33] saying
[1:09:36] it says in reality it's not you that is
[1:09:39] saying
[1:09:41] but when you are in christ
[1:09:45] it's god who's saying it for you do so
[1:09:47] what you are fair all that you have to
[1:09:49] do
[1:09:51] is to believe the consumer demand
[1:09:54] that when god asks me to pronounce this
[1:09:58] he himself will take care of the rest
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:14] that's
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:41] he was still on the wheelchair because
[1:10:44] but he was continuing to testify
[1:10:47] that by his stripes
[1:10:52] i went into the prayer line
[1:10:54] the bible told me
[1:11:10] they came
[1:11:23] because everybody knows you're still on
[1:11:25] the wheelchair because
[1:11:28] again but when you says everywhere that
[1:11:30] god heals you
[1:11:32] it's it's bringing a bad name
[1:11:34] he looked at him
[1:11:39] it says if you were in the same
[1:11:41] condition that i am right now
[1:11:46] you will not try to take away the only
[1:11:48] hope i have the toothless
[1:11:51] that by all means it's by his stripes
[1:11:55] said again that i was here
[1:11:58] and when he said it
[1:12:00] he stood up on the wheelchair
[1:12:02] he began to walk
[1:12:04] why
[1:12:06] because he believes
[1:12:08] that your heaven and earth pass away but
[1:12:11] the word of god
[1:12:13] will never pass away
[1:12:15] regardless of the situation you're going
[1:12:18] through
[1:12:20] regardless of your failure
[1:12:23] you take a part of the world
[1:12:25] your fault
[1:12:26] that is telling you that you are strong
[1:12:28] you get your feedback that is telling
[1:12:30] you that you are a son and the son of
[1:12:31] god
[1:12:33] that he tells you that you're a son of
[1:12:34] god that you hold on to that
[1:12:40] and god himself
[1:12:42] will bring the past the rest
[1:12:45] because he's capable
[1:12:48] he is faithful
[1:12:53] everything what god has asked of us
[1:12:57] is to be certain of him
[1:13:01] to believe
[1:13:30] there's nothing impossible to god
[1:13:33] we can also say
[1:13:36] that nothing is impossible to them not
[1:13:38] believe
[1:13:42] because we believe the word
[1:13:50] uh
[1:13:51] the sons of god manifested
[1:13:54] um paragraph 21. it is
[1:13:57] it says now now
[1:13:59] shows can fall about the first thing
[1:14:01] that paul started thinking
[1:14:04] we started out to tell to tell the
[1:14:06] people
[1:14:12] it says remember
[1:14:16] this is to the church
[1:14:19] not the outsiders
[1:14:23] it's a mystery and it's a riddle to him
[1:14:25] the enigmatic
[1:14:27] it says
[1:14:28] it never never able to understand it
[1:14:35] it goes on top of his head
[1:14:38] he does not know more about
[1:14:44] but to the church
[1:14:47] for you and i
[1:14:49] me
[1:14:50] but for the church
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:25] but god's word shall never pass away
[1:15:29] but the man that's outside of canaan
[1:15:34] knows nothing of it he let him call her
[1:15:50] i don't say that the man that's in it
[1:15:52] even in in egypt
[1:15:55] he's not a good man
[1:16:01] until he has come over into the
[1:16:03] possessions ella
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:54] and we are led by the spirit let's
[1:16:56] physically feed your son country palace
[1:16:59] sons and daughters of god are led by
[1:17:12] god promised them a natural land
[1:17:17] where they were flowing milk and honey
[1:17:21] and god fulfilled that do nothing in our
[1:17:24] exodus
[1:17:28] god promised a spiritual language
[1:17:32] and that that land has nothing but the
[1:17:35] word of god
[1:17:38] and that land is nothing but the message
[1:17:42] and what
[1:17:47] that israel was never blessed when they
[1:17:50] were outside of the promised land
[1:17:55] the biggest blessing that we can receive
[1:18:00] is when we remain in the world
[1:18:04] is when we abide in the message
[1:18:08] is when we we abide in our promised land
[1:18:12] because there we are sure
[1:18:15] that heaven and earth will pass away
[1:18:19] but the word of god will never pass away
[1:18:22] from myself my brother my sister
[1:18:25] regardless of your situation
[1:18:28] regardless of the difficulties that you
[1:18:30] are in your work
[1:18:34] let's believe that the word the god who
[1:18:36] bless you in this message
[1:18:40] he's able to take you all the way
[1:18:41] through the rapture
[1:18:44] he's the only one who's capable okay
[1:18:47] no man is capable
[1:18:49] of
[1:18:50] we saw it
[1:18:52] when we said who's worthy who's worthy
[1:18:54] person
[1:18:56] no one was found worthy
[1:18:59] but it's god himself
[1:19:01] by his grace
[1:19:03] by his goodness
[1:19:05] by his love
[1:19:21] to give us access to the promised land
[1:19:25] when we go back into that exodus
[1:19:28] for me god promised
[1:19:31] that he gave them that land
[1:19:34] but when
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:16] they had
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:38] the promise is only given to the
[1:20:40] overcomers
[1:20:42] to be an overcomer for combat you have
[1:20:45] to fight it's just secondly something
[1:20:48] and god knows that we are in the fight
[1:20:52] the the the advantage that we have
[1:20:55] to come back that it's in this war
[1:21:10] whatever what kind of weapon it was to
[1:21:12] give us a second
[1:21:14] end that weapon the most powerful one
[1:21:17] is the word of god
[1:21:20] with the word of god
[1:21:24] we can we can overcome under every
[1:21:26] circumstances
[1:21:29] that's why this word
[1:21:31] will never pass away
[1:21:35] we can take a lot of testimonies in the
[1:21:37] word
[1:21:38] we can take job
[1:21:45] in whom god himself gave testimony
[1:21:49] he looked at satan and said
[1:21:51] have you considered my servant joe oh
[1:21:55] it says every time i read that
[1:21:57] you should be so confused i i feel
[1:22:00] heaviness
[1:22:02] i asked myself a question
[1:22:07] can god ask satan
[1:22:09] on my behalf and the same question
[1:22:13] if you looked at my servant
[1:22:16] there's no there's no man on earth like
[1:22:18] him
[1:22:20] but this man who was uh who was perfect
[1:22:25] this man who believed god
[1:22:29] god placed him in trials
[1:22:32] a trial a different a difficult trial
[1:22:35] it was in a horrible trial
[1:22:41] any uh a trial that none of us would
[1:22:43] want to have
[1:22:45] what would it what did job do
[1:22:48] he said god gave us
[1:22:50] and god takes away
[1:22:52] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:23:00] job remain firm with the word of god
[1:23:06] satan went back to god
[1:23:08] he says
[1:23:13] he he's continuing to believe
[1:23:17] because you give him a good health
[1:23:29] but then i i i set up a limit for you
[1:23:46] he allows satan to come up to death
[1:23:50] be sure
[1:23:53] that god is giving him a limit
[1:23:57] you cannot cross the slimmer
[1:24:00] i am not authorizing you to go past this
[1:24:03] point
[1:24:08] and god wants to see us
[1:24:11] resist like job
[1:24:14] and when job stood firm
[1:24:17] god gave him a vision
[1:24:19] he says i know come on
[1:24:21] my redeemer liver
[1:24:25] that even if the worm eat off of this
[1:24:27] flesh
[1:24:28] but i'll see god face to face
[1:24:31] it says but not the eyes of the others
[1:24:34] but my own eyes will see god
[1:24:39] the the three hebrew children
[1:24:57] they had their own habits
[1:24:59] but
[1:25:00] but damn
[1:25:02] they were believers
[1:25:09] they knew that the heaven and earth will
[1:25:11] pass away
[1:25:12] but the word of god will never pass away
[1:25:18] when the world under which they were
[1:25:20] living
[1:25:25] brought them to try to worship something
[1:25:27] that was not in the word
[1:25:30] festival what did what does the devil do
[1:25:32] oftentimes
[1:25:33] he's very smart
[1:25:37] he will try to bring you it will bring
[1:25:39] you to do something that's not
[1:25:41] scriptural
[1:25:42] it's him that's doing it
[1:25:44] and when he finished doing it
[1:25:47] he comes back he's the male 1 he comes
[1:25:49] and stands in front of you
[1:25:51] you see what you did
[1:26:02] just stop praying
[1:26:04] tell him
[1:26:06] it's not me that did it jesus i am a son
[1:26:09] of god
[1:26:10] god i can once again
[1:26:13] i can come back oh in the kitchen
[1:26:15] scriptures coming to me
[1:26:20] zechariah
[1:26:26] i believe it's zechariah the third
[1:26:28] chapter
[1:26:30] uh excuse me i'm trying to find it
[1:26:49] verse 1
[1:26:55] let's start from verse 1. it says an
[1:26:57] issue and he showed uh he showed me
[1:27:01] joshua the high priest standing before
[1:27:03] the angels of the lord and satan
[1:27:05] standing at his right hand to resist him
[1:27:10] and the lord said unto satan the lord
[1:27:13] rebuked thee o satan even the lord that
[1:27:17] had chosen jerusalem rebuked thee
[1:27:20] it is not the
[1:27:21] is not this a brand plugged out of the
[1:27:24] fire
[1:27:25] now joshua was clothed with a
[1:27:29] filthy garment and stood before the
[1:27:31] angels
[1:27:32] and he answered and speak unto those who
[1:27:35] stood before him saying
[1:27:39] saying
[1:27:40] take away the filth the filthy garment
[1:27:43] from him and unto him he said behold i
[1:27:46] have caused thine iniquity to pass from
[1:27:49] thee and i have closed thee with a
[1:27:51] change of raymond reinman and i said let
[1:27:55] them set up set a fair
[1:27:58] minister upon his head
[1:28:00] so they set a fair minstrel upon his
[1:28:02] head and clothed him with the garments
[1:28:05] and the angel of the lord stood by
[1:28:08] and the angel of the lord protested unto
[1:28:11] joshua saying
[1:28:13] that saith the lord of hosts if thou
[1:28:16] will walk in my way if thou will keep
[1:28:19] all my all keep my chain my charge and
[1:28:22] now
[1:28:23] shall also judge my house and and shall
[1:28:27] also keep my courts i will give thee
[1:28:30] places to walk among those that stand by
[1:28:36] we can stop right here
[1:28:39] we see there
[1:28:40] is joshua was standing there with filthy
[1:28:44] garments
[1:28:48] we were saying as in the type that
[1:28:49] joshua was in sin
[1:28:54] and satan presents himself before god
[1:28:56] for accusations so he can accuse joshua
[1:29:00] but what did god say
[1:29:03] it says oh i i reprimand your satan
[1:29:07] i'm gonna reprimand you or
[1:29:12] and god came and he took away the
[1:29:14] filthiness of joshua
[1:29:17] so he can make joshua his servants
[1:29:22] then the enemy will try to accuse you
[1:29:26] why you take the word because joseph say
[1:29:29] i am a son of god jesus
[1:29:32] i am a daughter of god
[1:29:34] god says
[1:29:45] it means he's able to bring us to
[1:29:47] perfection
[1:29:49] how is he going to do it
[1:30:15] they asked them to
[1:30:17] worship a strange god
[1:30:21] and it's certain that when if they had
[1:30:24] done it
