[20:32] we pray
[20:33] amen amen
[20:34] [Music]
[20:37] amen we're good to be gathered in the
[20:39] house of god this morning
[20:40] i want to welcome everyone and all our
[20:42] visitors are certainly happy to have you
[20:44] invited by the mic for our songwriting
[20:46] this morning god bless you
[21:00] amen
[21:03] i want to still get used to that walk
[21:07] you know i believe that the word of god
[21:10] is so perfect
[21:12] you know every single word has been
[21:15] ordered of the lord to be placed in just
[21:18] the
[21:19] the right place you know if we think
[21:20] about how in the beginning
[21:22] by the adjustment of just one word if
[21:25] man
[21:26] fell then so by the careful
[21:28] consideration of each word is the new
[21:31] man
[21:32] constructed into the kingdom of the lord
[21:35] so it's so important we talked about
[21:36] last week how just we should not be
[21:38] careful not to just casually read the
[21:40] scriptures like a
[21:41] like a history book because when you do
[21:43] that you can you can often breeze over
[21:45] the intent of what the lord has in mind
[21:48] you know an example of that scripture of
[21:50] a scripture like that where
[21:52] you know this could be the case if i
[21:53] would read the scripture for lo
[21:56] the wicked bend their bow they make
[21:58] ready their arrow upon the string
[22:01] that they may privily shoot at the
[22:02] upright in heart
[22:04] you know when you read that buried in
[22:06] that is a word which i think
[22:08] probably most of us just breeze right
[22:10] over we don't even really
[22:12] hardly even give it any consideration if
[22:15] i were to read it like this
[22:17] for lo the wicked bend their bow they
[22:19] make ready their arrow upon the string
[22:21] that they may shoot at the upright in
[22:23] heart
[22:25] it sounds like it's the same thing
[22:28] we might even say amen to that right
[22:32] seems just as truthful the first time i
[22:34] read it
[22:36] it agrees with our revelation i mean
[22:37] certainly we recognize that the wicked
[22:39] are increasingly being arrayed against
[22:41] those that are upright in heart
[22:43] we know we have a prophecy of that that
[22:46] one day all the very
[22:47] world will be turned against those that
[22:50] are the believers
[22:50] and what they stand for but you see one
[22:54] word has been removed
[22:57] every specific word has been placed in
[23:00] the scripture for a purpose
[23:02] no matter how unnecessary or small
[23:05] and in skipping over we can miss the
[23:07] intent
[23:09] the thought that god has for the verse
[23:13] didn't seem like anything was different
[23:15] the scripture that i'm talking about is
[23:17] psalm 11 verse 2
[23:20] and that word is privily
[23:25] you know the thing about priviley is it
[23:27] seems like it's an unnecessary word
[23:30] and for most of us it's not even a word
[23:31] that we probably use
[23:33] in our day-to-day language right i bet
[23:37] some of us don't even really know what
[23:38] it means
[23:40] you know that word priviley means
[23:43] secretly
[23:45] something that's done hidden in darkness
[23:50] and that inclusion of that one word
[23:53] makes the difference between recognizing
[23:57] that the attack of the enemy is one
[23:58] that's a secret attack
[24:01] one that can be done in darkness but
[24:02] just removing that one word
[24:05] one can miss the potential attack of the
[24:08] enemy
[24:09] against those that are upright in heart
[24:12] the moving of just one word
[24:14] that's what happened to eve right was
[24:17] that
[24:17] so careful you know it says in ephesians
[24:20] 6
[24:21] 12 it says we wrestle not against flesh
[24:23] and blood
[24:25] we wrestle against principalities
[24:26] against powers against the rulers of the
[24:29] darkness that hidden things
[24:33] the the hidden in darkness the things
[24:35] that are you know
[24:36] secret attacks we know that he's the
[24:38] ruler of that kingdom
[24:41] in ephesians 5 8 we were once of that
[24:44] kingdom
[24:46] it says that for ye were sometimes
[24:48] darkness but now are ye
[24:50] light in the world walk as children of
[24:53] the light
[24:54] and verse 13 there says something really
[24:55] interesting it says but all things that
[24:57] are reproved are made
[24:59] manifest by the light for whatsoever
[25:03] doth make manifest
[25:04] is light you see that's the weapon
[25:07] against darkness
[25:08] that's the weapon against secret attacks
[25:11] that's the weapon against things that
[25:12] are hidden in darkness shine a little
[25:13] bit of light on it
[25:15] and those things can't sneak up on you
[25:17] or come at you in the darkness
[25:19] as david said in psalm 119 105
[25:23] thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[25:27] and a light unto my path every
[25:30] word is that light that protects us
[25:34] against the secret
[25:35] attack of the enemy you know just as we
[25:39] heard brother branham say in our tape
[25:40] wednesday night anytime a question is
[25:43] raised we have but one response
[25:46] thus saith the lord right
[25:50] so as we read psalm 11 today let's
[25:53] remember the importance
[25:55] of surrounding ourselves with the word
[25:57] with that
[25:58] light and being careful to attend to
[26:00] each word
[26:01] that we might stand against the secret
[26:05] attack of the enemy let's read that
[26:07] together psalm 11
[26:09] in the lord but i my trust how say ye to
[26:12] my soul
[26:13] flee as a bird to your mouth for lo
[26:17] the wicked bend their boat they make
[26:19] ready their arrow upon the string
[26:21] that they may privily shoot at the
[26:24] upright in heart
[26:25] if the foundations be destroyed what can
[26:28] the righteous do
[26:30] the lord is in his holy temple the
[26:32] lord's throne is in heaven
[26:34] his eyes behold his eyelids try the
[26:37] children of men
[26:39] the lord trieth the righteous but the
[26:41] wicked and him that loveth violence
[26:43] his soul hateth upon the wicked he shall
[26:46] reign snares
[26:48] fire and brimstone and in horrible
[26:50] tempest
[26:51] this shall be the portion of their cup
[26:54] for the righteous lord
[26:55] loveth righteousness his countenance
[26:58] doth behold the upright
[27:08] [Music]
[27:15] one ring from the fountain when i heard
[27:19] my savior
[27:20] calling me and he said come to me
[27:25] relaxing and of your sin repenting
[27:30] and i will lead you out where you

[57:35] like to welcome and greet you this
[57:38] morning and then
[57:39] the many other family that's listening
[57:44] by way of the streaming we certainly
[57:49] welcome you i sent a note to a brother
[57:53] said i haven't seen you in a very very
[57:55] very long time he says well we're doing
[57:57] good
[57:58] um you know he's a front-line worker i
[58:02] guess that's what we call them now as
[58:04] front-line workers
[58:05] but we're all front-line workers in here
[58:08] but we're working for the kingdom
[58:10] but we should all be on the front line
[58:12] so we certainly
[58:15] like to greet all of them and and
[58:19] trust that this morning's personal
[58:22] uh there's been quite a bit of
[58:26] changes that goes on and you
[58:29] you try to sort your way through those
[58:32] and
[58:33] and try to serve what uh the best way
[58:36] that we can
[58:38] but i certainly uh
[58:41] trust that uh um
[58:45] you know you're all making it and you're
[58:47] all hanging in there
[58:48] strong so this morning we want to
[58:53] take a few moments and
[58:57] listen to a little portion
[59:00] of the message called spiritual amnesia
[59:05] now the way that
[59:08] this came on my heart and just struck me
[59:12] was we basically in
[59:15] this world that we're living in
[59:20] you guys can go and you can
[59:23] i know you're anticipating me singing
[59:27] but i'm i'm sorry thank you very much
[59:32] you realize that uh
[59:35] there everybody's telling us and
[59:39] all the news and everything around the
[59:41] world is this
[59:44] virus that escaped
[59:47] and and began to affect
[59:51] people and it began to affect elderly
[59:54] people
[59:55] first they were the most prone to
[59:58] succumb
[59:59] to this and then they had
[1:00:02] uh people that
[1:00:05] they they called were asymptomatic
[1:00:09] and that was people that had the disease
[1:00:13] but they didn't have any symptoms
[1:00:17] and they became spreaders
[1:00:21] and so they didn't know they had it but
[1:00:23] they could spread it
[1:00:25] and other people um
[1:00:28] uh they would get it and
[1:00:32] and they would just be sick for just a
[1:00:36] little while
[1:00:37] and so we had all these different uh
[1:00:40] scenarios
[1:00:41] all these different situations
[1:00:45] that made it very elusive in other words
[1:00:49] it was hard to pin
[1:00:50] down and then we had
[1:00:55] all kinds of different treatments you
[1:00:58] know this works
[1:00:59] that works this doesn't work this works
[1:01:01] and
[1:01:02] and everything and so i thought you know
[1:01:05] here is
[1:01:05] uh a natural sickness
[1:01:09] that absolutely
[1:01:12] changed the economy
[1:01:15] of the world and changed things
[1:01:18] something that was in the flesh
[1:01:21] well when i listened to this tape it
[1:01:24] i i just didn't randomly uh cross it
[1:01:28] uh it really came upon my heart
[1:01:32] and the tape of spiritual amnesia
[1:01:36] and uh you know and i i
[1:01:39] i thought about a little bit and i went
[1:01:41] on
[1:01:42] and then it kept pressing on me again
[1:01:45] spiritual amnesia and i thought
[1:01:50] yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna have to get
[1:01:53] around
[1:01:53] to that eventually and
[1:01:57] listen to it and about the third day
[1:01:59] late
[1:02:00] you know about the third time and came
[1:02:03] up a few days later
[1:02:05] and it just spoke back in my heart
[1:02:06] spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia
[1:02:10] and so i asked a question
[1:02:16] well first of all go listen to it
[1:02:19] and then when i begin to listen to this
[1:02:21] tape
[1:02:22] i really begin to understand
[1:02:27] what was being said
[1:02:32] and i i want us to listen to this go
[1:02:35] into listening to this this morning
[1:02:39] understanding that spiritual amnesia
[1:02:43] is a disease
[1:02:47] that has struck the church
[1:02:51] it was a disease that has struck the
[1:02:54] church
[1:02:55] and brother rem in this tape
[1:02:59] he talks about spiritual amnesia what it
[1:03:02] is
[1:03:03] what happened what the cause of it is
[1:03:06] we won't listen to the whole tape we'll
[1:03:09] listen to 20 minutes of it
[1:03:12] but the 20 minutes that i want to
[1:03:15] play for you is to establish
[1:03:19] to you that this
[1:03:22] is a disease a spiritual
[1:03:26] disease that strikes the church
[1:03:30] and we all have to be extremely
[1:03:34] careful that we don't catch it
[1:03:38] and and a physical
[1:03:41] disease they come and go but you don't
[1:03:44] want to be caught
[1:03:46] with something that could cause you to
[1:03:48] have a spiritual
[1:03:50] uh death or spiritual thing
[1:03:54] so i i just don't want it to be like
[1:03:58] just a sermon but i'd like to kind of
[1:04:01] make the emphasis this morning
[1:04:04] that we understand that
[1:04:08] this is a real thing spiritual amnesia
[1:04:13] is a real thing
[1:04:15] and you can have spiritual
[1:04:18] amnesia and be a carrier of it
[1:04:21] and infect other people with it not even
[1:04:25] knowing
[1:04:26] that you have it and so it is something
[1:04:30] that
[1:04:30] we should be aware of as
[1:04:33] believers we should be uh have an
[1:04:36] understanding and an
[1:04:37] awareness that this spiritual amnesia
[1:04:41] is something that can affect us and
[1:04:45] and and i'm i encourage you to go listen
[1:04:48] to this sermon
[1:04:50] and there's there's signs of that you
[1:04:53] have it there's symptoms of it
[1:04:56] there's things that it causes things
[1:04:58] that it does
[1:04:59] there's way to look at your life and say
[1:05:02] i've got amnesia
[1:05:04] you know there's things that i that are
[1:05:07] going
[1:05:08] on that and so because he identifies the
[1:05:11] church
[1:05:11] and the disease that they have of
[1:05:14] spiritual amnesia
[1:05:16] we just want to take a little look at it
[1:05:18] this morning
[1:05:19] and just talk about it just a little bit
[1:05:22] this morning
[1:05:23] but i want the reason i want to play
[1:05:26] this first
[1:05:26] 20 minutes is i i want us to
[1:05:30] understand that the prophet messenger to
[1:05:34] this
[1:05:34] age identify this as being a disease
[1:05:40] that the church has okay
[1:05:43] not just a catchy subject and not
[1:05:46] just a catchy phrase you know not just a
[1:05:50] description
[1:05:51] of describing something but he presents
[1:05:55] this as
[1:05:56] an actual disease
[1:05:59] that's affecting the church and
[1:06:02] and i i think as as a pastor if there's
[1:06:05] a disease going out there
[1:06:08] you know what i mean then you would want
[1:06:10] to
[1:06:11] uh warn the flock hey
[1:06:15] this is the the disease and there's a
[1:06:18] disease out there and you've got to know
[1:06:20] the symptoms of it
[1:06:22] because if you know the symptoms of it
[1:06:24] then you can do something about
[1:06:26] it you can treat it you know and you can
[1:06:30] do the things that are necessary
[1:06:33] to do and so we want to really establish
[1:06:36] that
[1:06:37] that this is something that
[1:06:41] is out there it's something that is
[1:06:44] working
[1:06:44] on the church it is something that's
[1:06:47] infecting the church
[1:06:49] and you've got to know the symptoms of
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:53] how would you like to have spiritual
[1:06:54] amnesia and not know
[1:06:56] it and then your life is spreading it
[1:07:00] right and so let's just take this a
[1:07:03] heart
[1:07:03] that we can stand together and we'll
[1:07:06] uh and we'll uh
[1:07:10] listen and we'll read the scriptures the
[1:07:12] same scriptures that are used
[1:07:14] in this message it's amos the third
[1:07:18] chapter
[1:07:19] the book of amos the third chapter and
[1:07:22] we'll read and uh and then
[1:07:26] when he says and then he'll say a prayer
[1:07:30] and at the end of his prayer he'll say
[1:07:32] amen and then
[1:07:34] we can be seated at that time
[1:07:37] so let us just pray and ask the lord to
[1:07:41] bless this to us
[1:07:42] so so listen to it this evening
[1:07:48] for the understanding in your heart that
[1:07:53] this is something that's
[1:07:54] real it's not a myth it's not a
[1:07:57] description
[1:07:58] it's absolutely a real disease heavenly

[1:08:03] us

[1:08:34] first verse

[1:08:54] bitty girl just a little 16 something

[1:12:27] will begin next week
[1:12:28] in tampa florida now i want to speak on
[1:12:32] spiritual
[1:12:33] i need amnesia now
[1:12:36] this little fellow that we're talking
[1:12:37] about amos just for a moment to get our
[1:12:40] background before we get to the text
[1:12:42] this was during the time of the great
[1:12:44] prosperity
[1:12:46] in samaria israel had prospered they had
[1:12:49] really
[1:12:50] uh went after the world and it prospered
[1:12:53] not always prosperity is a sign of
[1:12:56] spiritual blessings
[1:12:58] but sometimes on the contrary people
[1:13:01] think maybe you have to
[1:13:02] own a lot of worldly goods and shows
[1:13:05] that god's a blessing and that's not
[1:13:07] true
[1:13:08] sometimes it's the other way but we find
[1:13:11] him
[1:13:11] we don't know much about this little
[1:13:13] fella he we have no history where he
[1:13:16] come from we know to you according to
[1:13:17] the scripture here he's a herdsman
[1:13:19] but god had raised him up i can imagine
[1:13:23] seeing on one hot day in samaria there
[1:13:25] that one of the great
[1:13:27] tourist cities of the world that there's
[1:13:29] something on the order of
[1:13:30] would say miami or or hollywood los
[1:13:33] angeles some of them places like that
[1:13:35] some great
[1:13:36] place for tours and we uh
[1:13:39] and this imagines him he'd never been in
[1:13:41] such a city
[1:13:43] but he had the word of the lord he was
[1:13:45] coming to this great uh
[1:13:47] city where sin was heaped on every side
[1:13:51] the ministers that all got away from the
[1:13:52] word of god and they hadn't had a
[1:13:54] prophet in long years and so
[1:13:56] this little fellow as he topped the hill
[1:13:58] just uh kind of
[1:14:00] north of samaria i can imagine seeing
[1:14:03] the hot sun
[1:14:04] shining down his grave whiskers over his
[1:14:06] face his little eyes narrow and his
[1:14:08] little
[1:14:09] bald head shine as he looked down upon
[1:14:11] that city his
[1:14:12] eyes narrowed he wasn't looking at what
[1:14:14] tourists usually see
[1:14:16] to go to a city to see all of his
[1:14:17] enchantments of beauty
[1:14:19] he looked and seen what a sight that
[1:14:21] that city had become
[1:14:23] a city that once was a city of god and
[1:14:25] had gotten such a
[1:14:26] morally decay is that no wonder
[1:14:29] this little unknown fellow was amos the
[1:14:33] prophet
[1:14:34] and now we don't know very much about
[1:14:35] him we don't know where he come from
[1:14:38] prophets usually come on the scene
[1:14:39] unknown leave the same way we don't know
[1:14:42] where they come from where they go no
[1:14:43] about their backgrounds god just raises
[1:14:46] them up
[1:14:48] he wasn't much to look at but he had
[1:14:50] thus
[1:14:51] saith the lord that's the main thing
[1:14:55] of course he come to samaria to begin
[1:14:57] his campaign
[1:14:59] i'm sure he had no cooperation from
[1:15:01] nobody
[1:15:02] he had no fellowship card from any uh
[1:15:06] denomination he had no credentials to
[1:15:08] show what
[1:15:08] group he come from and but he had one
[1:15:12] thing
[1:15:12] he had the word of the lord for that
[1:15:15] city
[1:15:16] and i wonder if we could transport
[1:15:19] amos today down to our time i wonder
[1:15:23] if he'd be welcome in our city today i
[1:15:26] wonder if we would receive him or would
[1:15:27] we do just like
[1:15:28] they did we find our cities in the same
[1:15:31] decay
[1:15:33] and we find that sin is just great among
[1:15:36] the people
[1:15:37] as it was then and i wonder if this
[1:15:39] little unknown man
[1:15:41] how is he going to start this campaign
[1:15:43] how where is he going to begin at
[1:15:45] what church is he going to or who's
[1:15:47] going to cooperate with him
[1:15:48] he had nothing to show where he come
[1:15:50] from he had nothing at all but
[1:15:52] thus saith the lord for the city
[1:15:56] he found them so decayed and so morally
[1:15:59] corrupted
[1:16:00] it was a great time the women in that
[1:16:02] city had become
[1:16:04] almost like they are in the united
[1:16:06] states they had become
[1:16:07] corrupt everything that god had expected
[1:16:10] out of them they went right the other
[1:16:11] way
[1:16:12] and and we'd find that it was a great
[1:16:15] place where
[1:16:16] they had dancings on the street the
[1:16:18] women immorally stripping their clothes
[1:16:20] and so forth like
[1:16:21] striptease of course that was a public
[1:16:23] amusement now days now it's everyday
[1:16:25] just let the weather get hot and you
[1:16:26] don't have to go to any
[1:16:28] show you're all on the street anywhere
[1:16:29] anyhow shame on you women to do a thing
[1:16:32] like that
[1:16:33] you ashamed yourself and um and then
[1:16:36] i said that to a woman here not long ago
[1:16:38] and she said why
[1:16:40] she said the uh brother branham said
[1:16:42] that that's uh
[1:16:43] uh that's just like the rest of women i
[1:16:45] said but we are not supposed to act like
[1:16:47] the rest of the people
[1:16:48] we are different we are uh a different
[1:16:51] character reminds me of a
[1:16:54] woman said well brother branham another
[1:16:56] said i i don't wear those sharks that i
[1:16:58] wear
[1:16:59] slacks i said that's worse god said it's
[1:17:02] an abominationally sight for a woman to
[1:17:04] put on a garment pertains to a man
[1:17:06] it's exactly right one said well they
[1:17:09] don't make any other clothes they still
[1:17:11] make sewing machines and have goods
[1:17:13] there's no excuse
[1:17:14] it's just what's in the heart that's
[1:17:15] what shows out it
[1:17:17] it identifies itself and now we find
[1:17:21] in this city it become morally decayed
[1:17:23] the preacher's afraid to say anything
[1:17:25] about it
[1:17:26] and uh but they had a little fellow
[1:17:28] coming up over the hill was coming to
[1:17:30] tell him
[1:17:30] thus saith the lord clean this thing up
[1:17:34] or you're going to
[1:17:35] go into captivity and he lived to see
[1:17:38] the days
[1:17:39] of his prophecy fulfilled he prophesied
[1:17:41] the days of jeroboam ii which was just a
[1:17:43] outcast
[1:17:44] anyhow he he favored the other nations
[1:17:47] and
[1:17:47] and lisala amos prophesied and told him
[1:17:50] he said the very
[1:17:51] god that you claim to serve he'll
[1:17:53] destroy you
[1:17:55] and he did and if his voice would be
[1:17:57] here tonight in the
[1:17:58] in birmingham it would claim the same
[1:18:01] thing to the churches
[1:18:03] uh very god that you claim to serve will
[1:18:06] destroy you someday
[1:18:07] i'm not speaking to this audience here
[1:18:09] these tapes go around the world
[1:18:11] now remember that is true then he found
[1:18:14] out
[1:18:15] when he come into the city that he all
[1:18:17] this stuff i wonder how he must have
[1:18:19] felt to look and see that
[1:18:21] decay of the people of god to whom he
[1:18:24] was sent
[1:18:25] uh i wonder if we would receive him now
[1:18:28] if he'd come in would we
[1:18:29] would we cooperate with him would we
[1:18:32] give him our
[1:18:33] our best would we give him our attention
[1:18:35] would we repent if he told us
[1:18:37] that we should go back to the word of
[1:18:38] the lord and do the way the lord said
[1:18:40] i wonder what our sisters would do about
[1:18:42] their bobbed hair when they let their
[1:18:43] hair grow out again
[1:18:44] if aim is gone he'd preach it now i'm
[1:18:46] telling you that because that's the word
[1:18:48] of the lord
[1:18:49] i wonder if our if our boards have put
[1:18:51] out
[1:18:52] deacons as married three or four times
[1:18:54] and and so forth like that
[1:18:56] trying to be deacons i wonder if all
[1:18:57] these things i wonder what he would do
[1:18:59] to man that would let his wife
[1:19:01] wear sharks and get out in the street
[1:19:02] out there and mow the yard out in the
[1:19:04] yard when
[1:19:05] man is passing by i wonder what he'd say
[1:19:07] to man like that
[1:19:08] amen he'd certainly blast it with all
[1:19:10] that was in him
[1:19:12] or he had thus saith the lord and he
[1:19:14] couldn't do
[1:19:15] nothing else but that he found them in
[1:19:17] that day with the bad case
[1:19:20] of a disease spiritual uneasy and that's
[1:19:24] just exactly what we got today
[1:19:26] now how did he know what was going to
[1:19:30] happen
[1:19:30] how would amos know first he was a
[1:19:33] prophet
[1:19:34] and the next thing he knowed by the
[1:19:36] disease
[1:19:37] what the diagnosis was and he know what
[1:19:39] the results was
[1:19:41] if a doctor looks upon a malignancy and
[1:19:43] sees that that
[1:19:44] malignant untucker hold he knows there's
[1:19:46] nothing but death
[1:19:47] left that's all unless god does
[1:19:49] something about it
[1:19:50] well when you look at a city and you
[1:19:52] look at a people you look at a church
[1:19:55] and look at a people it's so far away
[1:19:57] from god
[1:19:58] there isn't nothing but to diagnose but
[1:20:01] sin
[1:20:01] the wages of sin is death it's dying
[1:20:05] the diagnosis proves what it is you see
[1:20:07] when people get away from god and won't
[1:20:09] listen to the word
[1:20:10] have no more desire for the word then
[1:20:12] there's one diagnosis to it
[1:20:14] the soul that sinneth that soul shall
[1:20:16] die
[1:20:17] unbelief shall separate you from god
[1:20:20] that's exactly right
[1:20:21] but he knew what the disease what the
[1:20:23] results was when he seen the disease
[1:20:25] of of sin in the city now
[1:20:29] this enemies are we told it is a
[1:20:33] a cause you to be to a place where you
[1:20:36] can't
[1:20:36] not identify yourself
[1:20:41] now it's an unusual thing it don't
[1:20:44] happen too often
[1:20:46] but the causes is from shock
[1:20:49] it's somebody that don't even know who
[1:20:51] they are they find it from war
[1:20:53] sometimes the soldiers get it sometimes
[1:20:56] people get
[1:20:56] another thing causes it is weary where
[1:20:59] he will cause it where he has no virtue
[1:21:01] to it at all
[1:21:03] no it's it's skip wary accept faith
[1:21:06] someone said well my wife you're going
[1:21:08] to be shot in the morning wouldn't you
[1:21:09] worry i said no
[1:21:11] don't think so why i said worry couldn't
[1:21:13] do enough but make me worse
[1:21:14] well what good is going to do to have
[1:21:15] faith i said it might deliver me yes sir
[1:21:18] see so where he has no virtue to it at
[1:21:20] all but faith has
[1:21:21] all virtue believe now
[1:21:24] weary sometimes calls it and another
[1:21:26] thing that causes among the people
[1:21:28] is getting between two opinions that'll
[1:21:31] cause
[1:21:32] amnesia and it uh gets you to a place
[1:21:35] where you you
[1:21:36] actually what you've done you've lost
[1:21:38] your reasons you've lost your mind
[1:21:40] you can't make you don't know who you
[1:21:41] are you can't identify yourself you can
[1:21:44] walk around
[1:21:44] eat everything but you still you can't
[1:21:47] identify yourself
[1:21:48] you've got your scholarly education you
[1:21:50] can same education you had but you don't
[1:21:52] know where it comes from you don't know
[1:21:54] who you are where you belong that's
[1:21:56] amnesia
[1:21:57] so we're told we are identified
[1:22:01] uh with our families in this human life
[1:22:05] by marriage and with our wives we marry
[1:22:09] and our families identified by the union
[1:22:11] of our
[1:22:12] our our marriage and then
[1:22:15] what to think what if this horrible
[1:22:18] thing would happen to you
[1:22:20] and you wouldn't be able to remember
[1:22:23] who you marry who's your wife which is
[1:22:26] your children
[1:22:28] who is your father and mother who is
[1:22:30] your neighbor
[1:22:31] that would be a horrible thing then
[1:22:35] we are identified again can identify
[1:22:38] ourselves in the human race by having
[1:22:40] intelligence and being different from
[1:22:42] the animal life
[1:22:43] the animal cannot think he just goes
[1:22:46] with sounds
[1:22:47] he has no soul and but we're animal life
[1:22:50] what makes us different we're a mammal
[1:22:52] but what that mammal is warm blooded
[1:22:54] animal
[1:22:55] and we are in the feature of animal
[1:22:58] but what makes us different we are
[1:23:00] identified by having a
[1:23:02] soul a conscience that tells us what's
[1:23:04] right and wrong
[1:23:06] now there is a place when you get this
[1:23:08] amnesia you might get like
[1:23:09] nebuchadnezzar was who exalted himself
[1:23:12] one time
[1:23:13] and god let him think he was an
[1:23:16] animal and he lived out in the
[1:23:18] wilderness and and
[1:23:20] eat grass like an ox and and his uh
[1:23:23] his hairs grew down his body like eagle
[1:23:26] feathers
[1:23:26] and he become the heart of a beast in
[1:23:30] him
[1:23:30] see that was amnesia
[1:23:33] because he had forgotten that he was a
[1:23:36] king he had forgotten
[1:23:37] that he was a human being and he thought
[1:23:41] he was an animal so he acted
[1:23:44] like a man amen because he forgot he was
[1:23:48] a human being that's so easy today
[1:23:51] and we forget sometimes what the
[1:23:54] christian church is
[1:23:56] we act like the world that shows that we
[1:24:00] got spiritual amnesia because
[1:24:03] you don't act like the christian you act
[1:24:06] like the world you receive the heart of
[1:24:08] the world
[1:24:10] and it causes this here we uh
[1:24:13] we find that israel had exposed
[1:24:17] uh got exposed to the world and it fell
[1:24:20] into this
[1:24:21] rut and this prophet was sent to dig him
[1:24:24] out of it if he could and to tell him
[1:24:27] god by his grace chose israel from
[1:24:31] all the rest of the families on the
[1:24:33] earth grace had did that
[1:24:35] he had given them the choice lands
[1:24:38] he gave them houses that they never had
[1:24:41] to build
[1:24:42] god did that chose them he gave them
[1:24:45] farms that they never bought he
[1:24:48] he gave them he gave them food that they
[1:24:52] never planted
[1:24:53] he gave them wells that they never dug
[1:24:56] you gave them victories
[1:24:57] that they never won he gave them grace
[1:25:00] that they never merited
[1:25:02] god did that by his grace for
[1:25:05] this people israel his chosen his
[1:25:09] beloved
[1:25:11] and he said in the bible he found her in
[1:25:13] the field as a little girl
[1:25:14] sitting in her own blood and he washed
[1:25:16] her and cleaned her up
[1:25:18] and what he done but after god showed
[1:25:20] all these
[1:25:21] mercies to her and she got rich she got
[1:25:25] amnesia and these and she forgot
[1:25:28] all about where these things come from
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:31] i think that's a picture of usa 1964.
[1:25:38] it's suffering with the same disease
[1:25:41] we're great powerful churches
[1:25:43] we're a great powerful people we're
[1:25:45] millions in number
[1:25:47] and we'll forget where these things come
[1:25:49] from
[1:25:51] they had a bad case of it after god had
[1:25:54] been good to him and brought him up
[1:25:56] from all the heathen lands and made him
[1:25:58] a separated people
[1:26:00] separated them to himself he said he
[1:26:02] took a vine out of another country and
[1:26:04] planned it over in another country
[1:26:06] and how he fixed it around to make it
[1:26:09] grow fruit
[1:26:10] and be fruitful but the vine
[1:26:13] forgot where its blessings come from
[1:26:16] so has god's people in these last days
[1:26:20] has forgotten what the testimony
[1:26:24] of being a christian means amen
[1:26:28] it's again this amnesia has become upon
[1:26:31] the people
[1:26:32] they can't identify themselves they um
[1:26:35] they forgot all about it they had forgot
[1:26:38] his holiness
[1:26:39] they had forgot his law the women were
[1:26:42] living like the rest of the women
[1:26:44] god's church and his people has always
[1:26:46] been a
[1:26:47] separated people uh called out people of
[1:26:50] peculiar people
[1:26:51] a holy nation a royal priesthood
[1:26:54] offering spiritual sacrifices to god the
[1:26:56] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:26:58] his name
[1:26:59] god called his church and separated from
[1:27:02] the world
[1:27:02] for that very purpose and he given a law
[1:27:06] and he it must be holy he said i am holy
[1:27:10] and you must be holy and without
[1:27:12] holiness no man shall see the lord
[1:27:16] god said that himself and he called this
[1:27:19] people to be this type of people
[1:27:21] but they had forgotten about it they had
[1:27:24] forgotten his laws
[1:27:26] and they'd forgotten their morals the
[1:27:28] women out in the street
[1:27:29] israelite women out there each one
[1:27:32] expecting to
[1:27:33] to be conceived by the holy spirit to
[1:27:36] bring forth a messiah
[1:27:37] and then acting like that their
[1:27:40] character was
[1:27:41] terrible i want to stop here a minute to
[1:27:43] say
[1:27:44] it's the same thing among our peoples
[1:27:46] today who call themselves christians
[1:27:48] their character if you would only
[1:27:50] realize
[1:27:55] i hope they i hope that you go
[1:28:00] back and at home and and finish
[1:28:03] the rest of this and uh
[1:28:09] and really study it but we
[1:28:13] wanted just to point out today that
[1:28:16] the prophet of god identified this as a
[1:28:19] disease
[1:28:20] as a spiritual disease
[1:28:23] and uh he said it's the symptoms of it
[1:28:28] he says is that you you lost
[1:28:31] your identity you forgot
[1:28:34] your identity and you know and
[1:28:38] uh uh that's a terrible
[1:28:42] thing when we can't identify ourselves
[1:28:45] he said if you're identified in your
[1:28:47] family
[1:28:48] that's how you that you received your
[1:28:50] identity
[1:28:51] you were born into a family and you were
[1:28:54] raised in a family and
[1:28:56] and so you you you have your last name
[1:28:59] that's how you identify yourselves i'm
[1:29:02] such and such i'm a part of this family
[1:29:04] even in the old testament in the
[1:29:06] scriptures they would say such and such
[1:29:09] the son of such and such such and such
[1:29:11] begot
[1:29:12] such and such so when you you
[1:29:16] lose your identity you lose your
[1:29:20] family association you don't know where
[1:29:23] you come from
[1:29:24] but you know our identity is that we're
[1:29:27] children of god
[1:29:29] we've been born of god we've been bought
[1:29:32] of the lord we've been
[1:29:34] chosen and elected and
[1:29:37] purposed and purchased so it can you
[1:29:41] imagine if you forget
[1:29:43] that identity you forget that
[1:29:46] identification
[1:29:47] of who you are so it causes you
[1:29:50] to act different and that's what
[1:29:54] he was trying to point out is that
[1:29:56] israel
[1:29:57] was an elected chosen people
[1:30:02] they were called for a purpose they were
[1:30:05] elected
[1:30:06] to show forth something and to represent
[1:30:10] something that's what their uh identity
[1:30:13] was
[1:30:14] that's how they identified themselves
[1:30:16] they identified themselves
[1:30:18] in in circumcision you could tell who a
[1:30:21] jew was by circumcision
[1:30:23] you could tell by their family name who
[1:30:25] their associates their their lineage
[1:30:28] and all those things so they had a real
[1:30:31] distinct
[1:30:32] uh real distinct
[1:30:36] identification that they could tie
[1:30:39] themselves to
[1:30:42] and and so when when they
[1:30:45] had that purpose in their life and they
[1:30:48] had that
[1:30:49] calling in their life and they had this
[1:30:52] separation in their life
[1:30:53] when they forgot that
[1:30:58] when when they they no longer remembered
[1:31:01] that
[1:31:02] then they became just like the rest of
[1:31:04] the world and he said that's when amos
[1:31:06] came in
[1:31:07] he walked into a city that used to be a
[1:31:10] city of god
[1:31:11] a people of god that lived for god their
[1:31:14] choices
[1:31:15] was according to the law of god their
[1:31:18] choices was according to the
[1:31:20] things that belonged to god but they no
[1:31:22] longer
[1:31:23] identified themselves with those things
[1:31:26] they lost that identity
[1:31:30] now that's a sign
[1:31:34] that you have a disease
[1:31:38] a disease that you can't remember
[1:31:44] because that's what amnesia is it's the
[1:31:46] lack of memory
[1:31:49] it's it's it that you forgot
[1:31:53] and so when you can see that you don't
[1:31:55] identify yourself
[1:31:58] that's like this morning you you were
[1:32:01] you're here this morning because
[1:32:04] we've identified ourselves
[1:32:08] with a message that has been sent
[1:32:12] from the father we identify that
[1:32:16] we identify with the fact that that
[1:32:19] message
[1:32:20] is the word of god it was
[1:32:24] promised in the scriptures
[1:32:27] in this last day that god would raise up
[1:32:31] a prophet according to the ministry
[1:32:34] of malachi 4 5. it would be
[1:32:38] a ministry that had the spirit of elijah
[1:32:42] we we recognize that we see in the
[1:32:45] scriptures that it
[1:32:46] was to be used five times these are the
[1:32:49] things that we identify
[1:32:51] ourselves with
[1:33:04] we believe that that there was a
[1:33:08] that this ministry was going to be
[1:33:11] the messenger to lady osea
[1:33:15] the church age that there would be a
[1:33:17] church age
[1:33:18] in the last days that would be blind
[1:33:22] miserable wretched and
[1:33:26] have need of nothing
[1:33:29] a people that had amnesia
[1:33:33] they forgot who made them they forgot
[1:33:35] where they're going they forgot there's
[1:33:37] going to be a judgment
[1:33:39] they forgot this world is going to come
[1:33:41] to an end
[1:33:42] they no longer identify themselves
[1:33:46] with those those characteristics
[1:33:54] and so when that begins to happen that's
[1:33:57] when they begin to
[1:33:59] to get this amnesia and that's what
[1:34:02] we're not like the world
[1:34:05] we're different
[1:34:09] and if you forget that what happens is
[1:34:13] you forget your identity you forget that
[1:34:17] the we we they forget their morals
[1:34:22] we forget we don't wear high heels we
[1:34:25] don't wear tight clothes
[1:34:26] we don't wear low-cut blouses we don't
[1:34:30] wear those sleeveless things
[1:34:32] we don't have long hair we don't tell
[1:34:35] dirty jokes
[1:34:37] we don't do all these things
[1:34:41] you know we don't we don't go to the
[1:34:44] picture show we don't go to the dance
[1:34:46] hall
[1:34:47] we don't drink alcohol
[1:34:50] we don't we don't do those things
[1:34:54] see because that's our identity
[1:34:57] and those if we're going to identify
[1:34:59] with the messenger of the hour
[1:35:01] then we have to identify
[1:35:05] with what that he taught
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:09] so if now if we forget it
[1:35:14] and we get amnesia and we don't remember
[1:35:17] what he stood for
[1:35:19] we don't remember we have a moral code
[1:35:22] we don't remember
[1:35:23] that we're a separated people and our
[1:35:26] memory comes
[1:35:27] away and we we're no longer we we don't
[1:35:31] remember
[1:35:32] that we forgot that then
[1:35:35] that that's evidence that you forgot it
[1:35:39] begins to show up
[1:35:42] the symptoms of the disease
[1:35:47] begins to show up
[1:35:50] you got evidence that
[1:35:53] you've got it and that's
[1:35:57] what the messenger looked out at the
[1:35:59] world
[1:36:00] and the scripture says they no longer
[1:36:02] wish to retain god
[1:36:04] in their thinking they they
[1:36:07] they totally forgot and if you have
[1:36:11] amnesia and you don't know who that you
[1:36:14] are
[1:36:16] and you don't have anything that
[1:36:18] identifies you
[1:36:20] this morning we should be identified
[1:36:23] by the word of god
[1:36:27] and and so that works both ways the word
[1:36:29] of god should
[1:36:30] identify you so
[1:36:34] someone should be able to look at the
[1:36:35] word of god
[1:36:37] look at your life do a comparison
[1:36:41] and say this life matches up to the word
[1:36:44] of god
[1:36:45] amen if not if we forget that
[1:36:52] we forget that that my identity
[1:36:56] what what what what what i am
[1:36:59] is i'm associated with the word of god
[1:37:02] i'm identified by the word of god
[1:37:05] and i identify myself by the word of god
[1:37:09] so if i should ask you what do you think
[1:37:12] about this
[1:37:16] if you've got amnesia no telling
[1:37:19] what you will say that's right
[1:37:22] but if you're identified with the word
[1:37:25] then you
[1:37:26] if that's your answer you have a word
[1:37:29] answer if you don't have a word answer
[1:37:33] you stay still
[1:37:36] and you wait upon the lord until you
[1:37:40] have a word answer
[1:37:45] it's god it's got because if you get
[1:37:48] this amnesia
[1:37:50] now remember amnesia means you forgot
[1:37:56] you can't remember you forgot
[1:38:00] so with amnesia you forget where you're
[1:38:03] going
[1:38:05] you don't know where you're going did
[1:38:08] you hear him describe it
[1:38:10] you can have a great a great education
[1:38:14] you can have these great things you can
[1:38:16] know all the things but you don't know
[1:38:18] who you are
[1:38:19] you don't know where you're going
[1:38:23] well we cannot forget
[1:38:27] see amnesia sets in
[1:38:31] and and we forget that
[1:38:34] we believe there's a rapture coming
[1:38:40] we can't forget that
[1:38:43] we can't let that slip away we can't
[1:38:47] we can't not let that be on our mind and
[1:38:50] our
[1:38:50] identity it's part of it but
[1:38:53] you've got to see that that amnesia
[1:38:57] is a disease that that
[1:39:00] spreads and is being spread
[1:39:07] it's kind of like unseen
[1:39:10] the whole world is designed
[1:39:14] to make you forget
[1:39:17] about god the scripture says their
[1:39:22] conscience
[1:39:23] being snared with a hot iron no longer
[1:39:27] wish to retain god in their knowledge or
[1:39:30] their thinking
[1:39:33] i like this scripture it's found in
[1:39:36] jeremiah
[1:39:37] and it's the in the 23rd
[1:39:40] chapter of jeremiah and
[1:39:52] and
[1:39:54] and we'll start with the 24 25th verse
[1:39:58] if
[1:39:58] anyone wanted to turn there in jeremiah
[1:40:01] 23
[1:40:03] 25 he says i have heard
[1:40:06] what the prophets say
[1:40:10] they prophesy lies in my name
[1:40:13] saying i have dreamed i have dreamed
[1:40:18] now you know that a prophet is a
[1:40:21] new testament preacher
[1:40:24] so he's saying that i i have heard
[1:40:28] their sermons i have heard
[1:40:31] what they preach
[1:40:35] and he says i it and
[1:40:38] and he said
[1:40:42] and i have dreamed
[1:40:45] i have dreamed and and so
[1:40:48] he he's mentioning as we go there you
[1:40:51] know
[1:40:52] you have a dream that you dream
[1:40:57] right in other words i i dreamed you
[1:41:00] know that
[1:41:01] uh i was on a sinking ship
[1:41:05] and uh i had just caught the world's
[1:41:09] record marlin
[1:41:10] and the ship was going down and
[1:41:14] i was in a dilemma
[1:41:19] well that's a dream dream but you have
[1:41:22] dreams that people have that they dream
[1:41:26] in other words it's their vision you
[1:41:29] know this i have a dream of
[1:41:31] of of having schools in every
[1:41:34] country and south america
[1:41:39] or i have a dream of of doing this and i
[1:41:42] have a
[1:41:43] dream of accomplishing this and i have a
[1:41:46] dream
[1:41:47] of that and and and and
[1:41:50] so the the word of god saying is i've
[1:41:53] i have heard them their prophecies
[1:41:57] their preachings i have a dream of this
[1:41:59] i have a dream of that
[1:42:03] you know get a bible in
[1:42:06] everybody's hands send bibles to russia
[1:42:10] america sat on this hoax of sending
[1:42:14] bibles to russia
[1:42:15] sent millions and millions of dollars to
[1:42:18] send bibles to russia and you can buy a
[1:42:20] bible in russia
[1:42:25] but it like was a dream i remember a man
[1:42:28] had a dream that he was
[1:42:30] and he collected money for this dream
[1:42:33] he was getting everybody to send in
[1:42:35] money and he was going to put bibles and
[1:42:37] balloons
[1:42:39] and float them over uh
[1:42:42] cuba oh that's for real
[1:42:47] he sold that to the people
[1:42:51] okay and i say that because that's
[1:42:54] the spiritual amnesia listen to what
[1:42:57] listen to
[1:42:58] as we read the scriptures he said i i
[1:43:00] have
[1:43:01] i he said lying
[1:43:04] in my name saying i have dreamed
[1:43:07] i have dreamed
[1:43:11] and if you listen he says
[1:43:14] how long shall this be
[1:43:18] in the heart of the prophets
[1:43:22] that prophesy lies yea
[1:43:26] they are prophesying of the deceit
[1:43:30] of their own heart
[1:43:33] you see so it's not you know you i want
[1:43:36] you to say the nurse they have a
[1:43:38] different vision they've got a different
[1:43:42] vision
[1:43:44] and and they they deceive the people
[1:43:47] with their heart
[1:43:49] so you have to understand the listen all
[1:43:52] these different visions
[1:43:54] all these different ideas all these
[1:43:56] different things that
[1:43:58] people uh want are are coming up with
[1:44:01] you got to be careful what you lend your
[1:44:04] ear to
[1:44:07] what you let influential what gets you
[1:44:10] pulled off
[1:44:11] what what sucking you is because there's
[1:44:13] a reason
[1:44:16] that they do that there's a purpose
[1:44:19] behind it
[1:44:20] and listen what he says here he says
[1:44:23] it prophesies the seed in their heart
[1:44:26] which think
[1:44:26] to cause my people to forget
[1:44:30] my name by their dreams
[1:44:34] which they tell every man to his
[1:44:37] neighbor
[1:44:38] as their fathers have forgotten my name
[1:44:42] for baal
[1:44:45] what's the purpose of it
[1:44:48] they're sowers of amnesia
[1:44:53] they want you to forget
[1:44:56] that they're they're trying to to to
[1:44:59] get us to forget what our identity is
[1:45:03] forget what we stand for forget what
[1:45:06] we've associated with
[1:45:10] because they got another vision they got
[1:45:13] another dream
[1:45:14] they've got another idea what do they
[1:45:17] want to do they want us to forget
[1:45:19] the word of the lord they want you to
[1:45:23] forget your identity
[1:45:26] they want us to forget that we're
[1:45:27] identified with this message of this
[1:45:30] hour
[1:45:33] and so we we can we can see that
[1:45:36] part of of what amnesia is
[1:45:40] is when you forget what you're
[1:45:42] identified with you forget who you
[1:45:45] are you forget the purpose
[1:45:48] that you've been raised up another good
[1:45:51] scripture if if we look at it is like
[1:45:54] deuteronomy
[1:45:55] 8 and 2.
[1:46:10] so the spreader of amnesia
[1:46:14] the reason they're spreading amnesia is
[1:46:16] to
[1:46:18] get you to forget
[1:46:22] oh that's what the world does it gets
[1:46:25] you to forget
[1:46:28] it's it's substitute after substitute
[1:46:31] and now this morning i want us to just
[1:46:34] really let this soak in
[1:46:36] this is a real disease
[1:46:40] that's what he said there's a spiritual
[1:46:44] disease
[1:46:44] called amnesia it's a disease that
[1:46:48] causes you to forget
[1:46:55] forget that you were bought with a price
[1:46:58] forget that you were sealed with the
[1:47:01] seal
[1:47:02] of redemption to forget and if he can
[1:47:06] get you to forget
[1:47:08] then you become ineffective
[1:47:12] listen to this beautiful scripture in
[1:47:15] judah
[1:47:17] deuteronomy 8 and 2.
[1:47:20] he says and thou shalt remember
[1:47:24] all the ways which the lord thy god
[1:47:28] led thee these 40 years in the
[1:47:32] wilderness
[1:47:34] to humble thee and to
[1:47:37] prove thee to know
[1:47:40] what was in thy heart
[1:47:44] whether thou wouldest keep his
[1:47:47] commandments
[1:47:48] or not
[1:47:54] that's he says thou shalt remember
[1:47:58] yes sir thou shalt remember
[1:48:01] so the opposite of memory is amnesia
[1:48:06] so you have some you have a spirit a
[1:48:08] disease
[1:48:09] that's out there a disease
[1:48:14] it's it's it's a worse disease
[1:48:18] than c19
[1:48:22] it's a worse disease than than
[1:48:25] than than you can imagine it's worse
[1:48:28] than leprosy
[1:48:29] because jesus said fear not him who can
[1:48:32] destroy the body
[1:48:34] but that can delivereth the soul into
[1:48:37] hell
[1:48:39] now this disease of amnesia it's an
[1:48:42] identified
[1:48:44] disease in the church
[1:48:47] by a messenger sent from god
[1:48:51] vindicated of god fulfilling malachi 4
[1:48:54] 5 fulfilling luke 17 30.
[1:48:58] amen
[1:49:00] fulfilling revelations
[1:49:04] 3 and 14.
[1:49:07] a real disease
[1:49:10] and i want you i want you to get it
[1:49:14] this is not a sermon
[1:49:18] you understand this is the lord
[1:49:21] telling the church there's a disease
[1:49:25] moving in our midst spiritually
[1:49:35] the whole world is full of lies
[1:49:40] and dreams
[1:49:47] visions and ideas
[1:49:50] ways to become rich ways to do this ways
[1:49:53] to do that
[1:49:58] and what is the purpose of it
[1:50:01] they're spreading amnesia
[1:50:07] we've got to be we got to know
[1:50:10] that that the the fruits of the world
[1:50:15] and the things of the world are there
[1:50:18] to cause the christian to forget
[1:50:22] to entice them into forgetting
[1:50:27] their identity entice them into
[1:50:30] forgetting their association
[1:50:33] especially by putting us into
[1:50:35] circumstance
[1:50:36] is where it's a little bit embarrassing
[1:50:41] for you to identify ourselves we were
[1:50:45] looking one time
[1:50:46] to have a place to hold a little men's
[1:50:49] retreat
[1:50:51] and we had a place lined up and then
[1:50:54] when the person
[1:50:55] found out and they went and studied out
[1:50:57] a little bit and then they called us
[1:50:59] back and says you're not welcome here
[1:51:04] we said why not he says because you of
[1:51:07] what you believe
[1:51:13] i mean we're not welcome here because we
[1:51:15] won't take the mark of the beast
[1:51:19] i mean really we're not welcome here
[1:51:23] because we believe in the one and only
[1:51:25] true god
[1:51:26] and his son jesus christ who shed his
[1:51:29] blood for us
[1:51:30] we're not welcome here yeah
[1:51:34] all them that live righteous in in
[1:51:37] christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:51:40] all them that live godly all them that
[1:51:43] remember
[1:51:44] their identity they remember what
[1:51:47] they're standing for
[1:51:49] they're not going to forget they're not
[1:51:52] going to forget you don't think shadrach
[1:51:55] meshach and abednego might have had
[1:51:58] second thoughts
[1:52:02] no they remembered
[1:52:07] i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no
[1:52:10] other gods before me
[1:52:12] o king live forever
[1:52:17] i don't know if our lord will deliver me
[1:52:19] or not
[1:52:20] but this i remember i will not
[1:52:24] bow down to any other god
[1:52:27] than the lord god almighty
[1:52:31] amen sometimes you have to go into the
[1:52:34] fire
[1:52:36] but he said forget not how that i led
[1:52:40] you
[1:52:40] and the ways that i led you
[1:52:45] that's what amnesia is we forget how we
[1:52:49] were saved
[1:52:50] we forget the price that was paid for us
[1:52:53] we forget the power
[1:52:56] that was imputed to us
[1:53:00] instead of god being our first choice he
[1:53:02] becomes our last choice
[1:53:05] so we we've got
[1:53:09] as we begin to see that that that this
[1:53:12] great amnesia
[1:53:13] is is something that that it it's a
[1:53:17] disease
[1:53:18] this morning we could read in peter
[1:53:22] ii peter
[1:53:32] and you know first peter's the statue of
[1:53:35] a perfect man
[1:53:36] and listen what he says he says
[1:53:40] in the seventh verse he says add to
[1:53:42] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[1:53:44] brotherly kindness
[1:53:45] charity for if these things be
[1:53:49] in you
[1:53:52] and abound they make you
[1:53:56] that ye shall neither
[1:53:59] be barren nor unfruitful
[1:54:03] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[1:54:06] christ
[1:54:08] but he that lacketh these things
[1:54:13] is blind and
[1:54:16] cannot see afar off
[1:54:20] and hath forgotten that he was
[1:54:23] purged from his old sins
[1:54:29] you see he he has
[1:54:33] forgotten he was purged
[1:54:37] from his own sin i just want to read now
[1:54:41] just a few statements and maybe you
[1:54:44] could find them and put them
[1:54:46] on the board and we're going to read out
[1:54:48] from paragraph
[1:54:49] 70 in the same message
[1:54:53] and as we listen to these things verb
[1:54:57] is going to start saying this shows
[1:54:59] you've got amnesia
[1:55:00] this shows you've got amnesia when you
[1:55:04] can't identify yourself
[1:55:08] you understand you've got amnesia
[1:55:12] when you can't identify yourself with
[1:55:14] hebrews 13
[1:55:16] 8. you can't place yourself in that
[1:55:20] promise
[1:55:22] you're not sure that's for you
[1:55:25] you're you're suffering
[1:55:28] some things came on you something some
[1:55:32] spirit some situation some
[1:55:35] uh some sort of uh
[1:55:40] i don't know what to call it trap
[1:55:45] has got you to a place where you don't
[1:55:47] recall that
[1:55:49] and that's what amnesia is you can't
[1:55:51] recall anything
[1:55:55] no identity no don't know where you're
[1:55:58] going
[1:56:00] and remember the story in this book
[1:56:02] where that the soldier got off the train
[1:56:05] and saw the tower
[1:56:06] saw the town and he recalled
[1:56:10] something and he finally worked his way
[1:56:12] to his father's house
[1:56:15] he says
[1:56:19] when the world and the church
[1:56:23] joins itself together then
[1:56:26] they don't want nothing spiritual
[1:56:30] they don't want the saith the lord
[1:56:33] they want what they want they want the
[1:56:37] world
[1:56:39] and to say they're a christian
[1:56:42] and live like the world and
[1:56:45] live with the world and live
[1:56:48] like the world and still maintain
[1:56:52] their confession of being a christian
[1:56:56] you know the thing of it is it's
[1:56:59] spiritual amnesia
[1:57:03] so spiritual amnesia's got the symptoms
[1:57:10] the symptoms identify the disease
[1:57:13] remember he just said that so if you've
[1:57:15] got these symptoms then you understand
[1:57:19] that this amnesia is
[1:57:22] starting to affect you
[1:57:28] you understand it's a disease a disease
[1:57:32] is
[1:57:32] something from the outside that comes in
[1:57:36] and affects you
[1:57:40] what was a cancer it's a radical cell
[1:57:45] it's an outside life
[1:57:48] living in your body
[1:57:52] feeding on your cells
[1:57:56] in order that it can grow
[1:58:01] it doesn't it it doesn't have a right to
[1:58:04] your body
[1:58:08] but there's so much fear about it
[1:58:12] and there's so much money being made by
[1:58:14] it
[1:58:16] that the world wants you to forget
[1:58:19] that there's a god that drives that life
[1:58:23] out
[1:58:25] so they create an amnesia on the people
[1:58:29] that god's a healer that's the first
[1:58:32] thing a doctor ought to say
[1:58:34] he ought to walk in your room and say
[1:58:36] jesus christ can make you well
[1:58:42] i'll do everything i can to help them
[1:58:45] i'll do everything that i know but don't
[1:58:48] put your faith in me
[1:58:49] don't put your faith in medicine put
[1:58:52] your faith in him
[1:58:58] last thing on the list
[1:59:02] we've got amnesia
[1:59:07] do you understand medicine
[1:59:10] and i believe in doctors don't you
[1:59:12] misunderstand that
[1:59:14] but that's become one of the places that
[1:59:17] the world and christianity has come
[1:59:19] together
[1:59:20] by pushing divine healing out of the
[1:59:22] gospel
[1:59:28] think of it
[1:59:32] you know this we're not we're not
[1:59:35] accusing anybody what we're trying to do
[1:59:37] this morning
[1:59:38] is make all of us aware
[1:59:42] that there's a spiritual disease out
[1:59:44] there
[1:59:46] that's being spread
[1:59:52] the scripture says no like i coded
[1:59:54] earlier no longer wishing to retain
[1:59:57] god in their knowledge god's giving them
[2:00:00] over to
[2:00:01] what a reprobate mind
[2:00:05] so we've got to sit here this morning
[2:00:08] and be a hundred percent aware
[2:00:10] that there's a disease that i've got to
[2:00:14] watch out for
[2:00:17] it's trying to affect me and infect me
[2:00:22] spiritually i've got to know the
[2:00:25] symptoms
[2:00:28] so i can stand and take the word
[2:00:32] and treat it
[2:00:37] he said
[2:00:42] he says you know the thing of it is it's
[2:00:44] spiritual amnesia
[2:00:46] that's exactly what it is they don't
[2:00:49] know
[2:00:49] who they are they've forgotten
[2:00:52] what they are supposed to do
[2:00:58] a christian is supposed to act a certain
[2:00:59] way
[2:01:03] if one would come today like that
[2:01:06] it would be rejected just the same
[2:01:10] they had a bad case of it so
[2:01:13] have and so have they
[2:01:17] today they could not
[2:01:20] identify themselves with the
[2:01:22] supernatural
[2:01:24] things anymore because
[2:01:27] they didn't want it
[2:01:30] the word the gospel they didn't
[2:01:33] want it sin disease had affected them
[2:01:37] and they loved that so one of the signs
[2:01:41] of spiritual amnesia
[2:01:43] is now it's not you believe
[2:01:46] this is that you can't
[2:01:50] identify yourself personally
[2:01:54] with the supernatural
[2:01:59] another i believe that
[2:02:03] everybody else that god's a healer but i
[2:02:05] don't believe he's
[2:02:07] my healer
[2:02:11] i believe god does miracles but he
[2:02:13] doesn't do miracles
[2:02:15] for me see it's not you
[2:02:21] it's the amnesia that
[2:02:24] the world put on you that
[2:02:27] dreamers put on you and and
[2:02:30] and ministries and things put on the
[2:02:33] people
[2:02:34] so they don't identify themselves the
[2:02:37] supernaturals for me
[2:02:39] i have a supernatural help i look at
[2:02:41] them to heaven for whence cometh my help
[2:02:47] it's a sign the disease is for
[2:02:50] a real disease think of it like the
[2:02:52] black plague
[2:02:55] think of it as something that's being
[2:02:58] spread
[2:03:00] because it gets spread in conversation
[2:03:04] it gets spread in action it gets spread
[2:03:08] by
[2:03:08] atmosphere you should identify
[2:03:11] be able to identify when there's an
[2:03:13] amnesia
[2:03:14] atmosphere when you're talking to a
[2:03:17] person and you can look at them and say
[2:03:19] man they forgot
[2:03:21] that they've been bought with a price
[2:03:23] they forgot that god's their healer
[2:03:31] my
[2:03:39] sin is pleasant
[2:03:43] to the unconverted heart it looks good
[2:03:47] to the unconverted mind but it's the way
[2:03:51] of death
[2:03:52] there's nothing left but unconverted
[2:03:56] mind but it's the way of death there's
[2:03:58] nothing left
[2:04:00] but death the wages of sin is death
[2:04:04] and you must reap them wages
[2:04:07] you've sowed to the winds now reap the
[2:04:10] whirlwind
[2:04:12] the spiritual sign and the preaching
[2:04:15] of an ordained messenger from god
[2:04:18] never stirred them anymore
[2:04:26] well i hope that ain't happening with us
[2:04:33] if you have quit listening to tapes you
[2:04:37] are
[2:04:37] suffering with amnesia
[2:04:46] the spiritual sign and the preaching of
[2:04:49] an ordained messenger from god
[2:04:53] never stirs them anymore
[2:04:56] the woman could laugh right in their
[2:04:58] face
[2:04:59] and say i don't have to hear such stuff
[2:05:02] as that if that hasn't repeated again
[2:05:07] what is it spiritual
[2:05:10] amnesia exactly
[2:05:13] what it is they have forgotten
[2:05:18] that god and his word is the same
[2:05:22] and he can not
[2:05:25] change it can you imagine
[2:05:31] when if if we're going to play a tape
[2:05:35] i'll tell you if i was going to say i'm
[2:05:37] going to play a tape
[2:05:39] tuesday night
[2:05:43] you should say man i want to go hear the
[2:05:46] messenger
[2:05:49] you should rather want to hear the
[2:05:51] messenger
[2:05:53] than me
[2:05:57] then you say well why aren't you playing
[2:05:58] tapes because the word of god
[2:06:01] said to preach the gospel
[2:06:04] and those that just say that have forgot
[2:06:09] they've got spiritual amnesia and they
[2:06:12] forgot what the prophet
[2:06:14] taught they have a dream
[2:06:25] paragraph 78.
[2:06:30] you must identify you must be
[2:06:35] identified now understand that
[2:06:39] you must be identified
[2:06:42] so god has a way to identify you
[2:06:49] what's the first way god identifies you
[2:06:54] by the token
[2:06:58] you've placed the shed blood on your
[2:07:01] life
[2:07:04] you look through the blood and he looks
[2:07:07] back through the blood and when the
[2:07:10] bread
[2:07:11] hits red it's white
[2:07:14] so you must be identified don't think
[2:07:18] that's the spirit of lady osea
[2:07:21] they're neither hot nor cold they're
[2:07:25] unidentifiable he said i would that
[2:07:28] you'd either be hot
[2:07:29] or cold because if you're hot or cold
[2:07:32] you're identified
[2:07:34] if you're cold he can do something
[2:07:39] if you're hot he can use you
[2:07:42] but if you're lukewarm you're
[2:07:45] unidentifiable
[2:07:47] you've got amnesia
[2:07:52] you've just got it it's not
[2:07:56] bad to have it what's bad is when you
[2:08:00] recognize you've got it and don't do
[2:08:02] anything
[2:08:03] about it
[2:08:10] you must be identified somewhere
[2:08:13] you must show your life
[2:08:16] shows tonight where you
[2:08:19] are identified
[2:08:24] you are identified either in christ
[2:08:27] or not of christ
[2:08:31] you are not halfway
[2:08:34] there is no such thing as a drunk
[2:08:37] sober man there is no black
[2:08:41] white bird you're either saved
[2:08:44] or you are not saved you are a saint
[2:08:48] or a sinner one or the other
[2:08:52] and your spiritual attitude towards
[2:08:56] god's
[2:08:57] word identifies you exactly
[2:09:01] where you're standing
[2:09:04] god's word vindicated
[2:09:08] proved that the baptism of the holy
[2:09:10] ghost
[2:09:11] is just the same as it ever was
[2:09:15] on the day of pentecost or any other
[2:09:19] time
[2:09:20] and jesus christ is the same yesterday
[2:09:24] today and forever and your
[2:09:27] attitude towards that identifies
[2:09:31] whether you have spiritual amnesia
[2:09:35] or not
[2:09:41] think of it
[2:09:44] what's your attitude towards the baptism
[2:09:47] of the holy ghost
[2:09:49] is it just the same as it was on the day
[2:09:52] of pentecost
[2:09:54] it does the same thing it anoints the
[2:09:57] same way
[2:10:01] it's just as real as it was then
[2:10:05] so he says now look at your attitude
[2:10:11] if you're not hungering and thirsting
[2:10:13] for the things of god
[2:10:15] if you don't want that baptism in your
[2:10:18] life
[2:10:18] and you don't want that covering your
[2:10:21] life what's happened is
[2:10:23] is you've contacted
[2:10:26] spiritual amnesia you've
[2:10:29] started talking to somebody you started
[2:10:32] fellowshipping
[2:10:34] with things and you've got the amnesia
[2:10:40] especially you young people you young
[2:10:42] teenagers
[2:10:43] 13 14 15 16 17 years old
[2:10:48] that that you've got to watch
[2:10:51] because even girls in the church can all
[2:10:53] get together
[2:10:54] and they can all act start acting silly
[2:10:57] and they can all start
[2:10:58] forgetting about god and they can all
[2:11:00] start gossiping and
[2:11:02] doing little boy games and talk
[2:11:08] it's amnesia
[2:11:13] and then you know what you identify
[2:11:15] yourself with you identify yourself with
[2:11:18] rebellion
[2:11:22] you know when they're going to rebel
[2:11:23] against their mothers and
[2:11:25] they're not going to do and they all
[2:11:27] support one another you be
[2:11:28] mad at your mother i'll be mad at my
[2:11:30] mother
[2:11:33] and then we'll get together and talk
[2:11:34] about how
[2:11:36] lame does everybody still remember that
[2:11:38] word
[2:11:40] okay you know how
[2:11:44] out of touch mom is
[2:11:47] you know and they don't understand and
[2:11:50] they don't know
[2:11:51] no most of your parents don't want you
[2:11:54] to do the things that they did
[2:11:59] they know they know the price
[2:12:02] that's paid i've sat down with young
[2:12:05] girls and told them
[2:12:07] you go this way this is what's going to
[2:12:10] happen to you
[2:12:13] and beg them don't go with that crowd
[2:12:18] don't go with that boy don't start
[2:12:21] talking on the phone
[2:12:22] every night to a boy don't start
[2:12:25] seeing him don't start sneaking out of
[2:12:27] the house to go see him
[2:12:29] don't start doing this don't start
[2:12:31] passing those you're
[2:12:32] too young to build a relationship
[2:12:36] and get something going especially if
[2:12:38] that boy is older than you
[2:12:40] because he only has one thing on his
[2:12:43] mind
[2:12:43] it's not your soul it's your flesh
[2:12:47] and when he's done with it he's done
[2:12:49] with you
[2:12:53] that's the word of the lord
[2:12:56] [Applause]
[2:12:58] all you will end up with is spiritual
[2:13:01] amnesia don't let
[2:13:04] somebody talk you in to forgetting your
[2:13:08] god
[2:13:12] don't do it don't let anybody
[2:13:16] talk you in
[2:13:19] i didn't have anybody i was raised a
[2:13:22] catholic
[2:13:24] all i knew i could do whatever i want
[2:13:26] and jump into that box
[2:13:28] and it would be all over you know the
[2:13:30] one thing they never told me
[2:13:33] that you reap what you sow
[2:13:37] the sin was forgiven maybe
[2:13:42] in my case they were forgiven before the
[2:13:44] foundation of the world praise god
[2:13:48] but he said if you sin you sow the seed
[2:13:51] of sin
[2:13:52] you will reap a whirlwind and the first
[2:13:56] thing
[2:13:57] before you can sin is you've got to
[2:14:01] leave the word
[2:14:05] and they're trying to get you to forget
[2:14:07] with words of flattery
[2:14:11] believe me when a guy tells you you're
[2:14:12] the prettiest thing i've ever seen
[2:14:16] you better step back because his noses
[2:14:18] are growing
[2:14:26] because prophet god said you don't marry
[2:14:29] for beauty
[2:14:30] you marry for character amen amen
[2:14:34] amen
[2:14:37] that's you mary or character
[2:14:43] if a guy tells you oh you're so
[2:14:44] beautiful and you're this and you're all
[2:14:46] that
[2:14:47] and he never addresses your character
[2:14:52] that's a bum
[2:14:56] because he he don't have no character
[2:15:01] a real guy said you know i really
[2:15:03] appreciate the way you obey your mother
[2:15:08] really appreciate the way that you heard
[2:15:09] your mother and if he's got character
[2:15:11] he's got respect
[2:15:13] and he won't start knocking on your door
[2:15:15] until you've reached an
[2:15:17] acceptable age of your parents
[2:15:20] i got myself out of that one
[2:15:24] amen you know
[2:15:27] i don't know 18 i don't that's that's
[2:15:30] not for me to decide
[2:15:33] you know a a a daddy never feels his
[2:15:39] daughter's always too young
[2:15:46] but i'll tell you what a father does he
[2:15:48] knows a man of character
[2:15:51] and if you've got a real born again
[2:15:53] father
[2:15:54] you you just keep in mind if he tells
[2:15:58] you to watch
[2:16:06] yeah he says you are a
[2:16:09] saint or sinner or the other and your
[2:16:12] spiritual
[2:16:13] attitude towards god's words identifies
[2:16:16] exactly
[2:16:17] where you're standing right and it
[2:16:19] proves
[2:16:20] uh it's the same as the day of pentecost
[2:16:24] and then he let's just read that
[2:16:25] paragraph 79 god's word it did
[2:16:27] is proves that the baptism of the holy
[2:16:29] ghost
[2:16:31] the same as it ever was in the day of
[2:16:33] pentecost
[2:16:34] or any other time jesus christ was the
[2:16:36] same yesterday today and forever
[2:16:39] your attitude towards that
[2:16:43] identifies whether you have spiritual
[2:16:45] amnesia or not
[2:16:46] is your attitude towards is jesus christ
[2:16:50] the same today
[2:16:54] that's right no matter what whatever you
[2:16:57] you're a deacon
[2:16:59] or whether you're a preacher it doesn't
[2:17:02] mate yeah
[2:17:03] they get it too so we find out
[2:17:07] it's contagious and hits the whole thing
[2:17:15] doesn't matter who you are you can get
[2:17:17] it too
[2:17:19] it's contagious
[2:17:22] how many understand there's a real
[2:17:24] disease out there
[2:17:26] amen a real disease called spiritual
[2:17:29] amnesia
[2:17:31] let's go to paragraph 102.
[2:17:38] you guys able to find it now i find
[2:17:42] myself
[2:17:42] in this last days
[2:17:46] with the many of the believing
[2:17:48] christians
[2:17:49] identified in his ministry he's the same
[2:17:53] yesterday today and forever
[2:17:56] i find myself in this day identified
[2:18:00] in his ministry do you find yourself
[2:18:03] that way
[2:18:04] believing it walking with it
[2:18:07] notice the works that he did
[2:18:10] he said the believer would do the same
[2:18:13] thing
[2:18:14] the works that i do shall you also
[2:18:19] then can you be identified with him
[2:18:24] then when the reproach comes on the word
[2:18:28] can you stand the reproach
[2:18:32] like he did see identified
[2:18:35] him as i was identified with him
[2:18:39] i was with him on the day of pentecost
[2:18:43] i was with the disciples up there
[2:18:47] identified with them in the baptism of
[2:18:51] the holy ghost
[2:18:52] i wonder if the church hasn't got
[2:18:56] amnesia so much
[2:19:00] how that they don't some of them
[2:19:03] don't even believe there's such a thing
[2:19:07] as the holy ghost
[2:19:14] now take that
[2:19:17] don't don't just i believe in the holy
[2:19:20] ghost
[2:19:21] no are you mindful the holy ghost is
[2:19:24] there
[2:19:27] did you hear what bill graham said and
[2:19:28] when we played that tape he says
[2:19:30] is that thus saith the lord can you go
[2:19:33] there and say it's thus saith the lord
[2:19:35] can you do this and say it's thus saith
[2:19:37] the lord
[2:19:42] i mean are you conscious you feel his
[2:19:46] presence
[2:19:47] you know the anointing though what i'm
[2:19:50] trying to say is the whole world
[2:19:52] is constantly trying to get you to
[2:19:55] forget him
[2:19:56] to forget about him forget about it's
[2:19:59] the holy spirit that will lead you and
[2:20:01] guide you into all truth and
[2:20:03] righteousness
[2:20:04] i will not leave you comfortless i'll be
[2:20:07] there for you
[2:20:08] i will lead you forget not how that i
[2:20:11] led you in the wilderness
[2:20:16] though this amnesia is real
[2:20:23] see where the church has got a very bad
[2:20:27] case of amnesia
[2:20:29] see they've forgotten that was
[2:20:32] jesus christ back there
[2:20:36] they have forgotten that jesus was
[2:20:40] they have forgotten
[2:20:44] they thought he was a lawmaker
[2:20:47] or a prophet or a good man
[2:20:50] they forgot that he was god they forgot
[2:20:54] that he's the same
[2:20:55] yesterday and forever and the church has
[2:20:59] got a bad
[2:21:00] case of spiritual amnesia they have
[2:21:03] forgot
[2:21:04] all these things they don't understand
[2:21:07] it
[2:21:08] no more
[2:21:12] ask yourself
[2:21:15] are you forgetting to understand the
[2:21:17] message
[2:21:19] are you forgetting why god sent a
[2:21:21] messenger
[2:21:23] is it important to you
[2:21:27] that you have a storehouse that you have
[2:21:30] an
[2:21:30] absolute you see this
[2:21:33] spirit this disease this sickness
[2:21:37] is trying to get us to what forget
[2:21:44] it's what amnesia is it's the failure
[2:21:47] to remember

[2:21:53] your blessings
[2:21:55] can you imagine if you forget your
[2:21:58] blessings

[2:22:02] had a list
[2:22:04] and you counted it again and you came up

[2:22:27] that you've been purged from your sins
[2:22:29] it's a real disease
[2:22:31] church it's a real disease
[2:22:38] this is a thing from the spiritual
[2:22:41] disease control center
[2:22:47] there's an outbreak
[2:22:51] a spiritual pandemic of amnesia
[2:23:01] he said
[2:23:05] they forgot that he's the same yesterday
[2:23:08] there and the church has got a bad case
[2:23:10] of spiritual amnesia
[2:23:12] they have forgotten all these things
[2:23:15] they don't
[2:23:15] understand it no more
[2:23:19] then let's read go to paragraph 106.
[2:23:24] don't get spiritual amnesia
[2:23:31] because you you will you'll identify
[2:23:34] yourself
[2:23:35] with something else stay right
[2:23:38] with the word we was with
[2:23:43] the church when it was commissioned
[2:23:46] by jesus christ in acts the 16
[2:23:50] 16th chapter go into all the world
[2:23:54] and preach the gospel to every creature
[2:23:57] i want to be identified there all
[2:24:01] the world to every creature
[2:24:04] these signs shall follow them that
[2:24:06] believe
[2:24:08] can be identified in that
[2:24:12] well we are well now
[2:24:16] you are identified with that or
[2:24:19] you have got spiritual amnesia
[2:24:25] and there is do you personally identify
[2:24:28] yourself with that
[2:24:30] i'm commissioned to go into all the
[2:24:31] world and tell
[2:24:33] if you don't identify yourself with that
[2:24:37] somebody has passed amnesia on you
[2:24:43] and you've got to fight it off you've
[2:24:46] got to start applying thus
[2:24:48] eye salve that thou mayest see
[2:24:56] well are you identified with that or
[2:24:58] have you got some
[2:25:00] spiritual amnesia some just a little
[2:25:03] some spiritual amnesia that you find
[2:25:06] out you don't believe those signs
[2:25:10] follow the believer see if you don't
[2:25:13] believe it
[2:25:14] then you have spiritual amnesia see
[2:25:17] you've got
[2:25:18] you forgot that god promised that
[2:25:21] he said these signs shall follow them
[2:25:23] that believe
[2:25:25] don't forget it
[2:25:29] you can't forget it
[2:25:33] and be a christian you
[2:25:36] must be identified with it
[2:25:40] you must be identified with saint john
[2:25:43] 14th
[2:25:44] chapter the 12th verse he that believeth
[2:25:47] on me
[2:25:48] the works that i do shall he do also
[2:25:52] don't forget it if you do
[2:25:56] then you've got spiritual amnesia
[2:26:01] you forgot who you are
[2:26:04] you've forgotten what your
[2:26:07] testimony means
[2:26:12] that's a good question
[2:26:17] what your testimony means
[2:26:20] we're closing oh it's a little long but
[2:26:22] it's just
[2:26:23] i really want to lay this down
[2:26:33] how about he said if you abide in me and
[2:26:36] my words abide in you
[2:26:38] then ask what you will and it will be
[2:26:40] done for you
[2:26:42] are you identified there to believe
[2:26:46] that is the truth mark 11
[2:26:49] when he said if you say to this mountain
[2:26:52] be moved
[2:26:53] and don't doubt in your heart but
[2:26:56] believe
[2:26:57] that you have said
[2:27:00] will come to pass you can have what
[2:27:03] you've said can you identify there
[2:27:08] to believe that that is the truth
[2:27:11] if it hasn't then you're getting
[2:27:15] spiritual amnesia and you forgot
[2:27:21] you lose your christian balance
[2:27:24] you can't tell where you belong i'm a
[2:27:28] methodist i'm a baptist
[2:27:29] that's what i know about i'm pentecostal
[2:27:33] and this that and the other watch out
[2:27:37] that may mean that the disease sign
[2:27:41] is showing on you and you've got
[2:27:44] some spiritual amnesia
[2:27:49] 215 115 you say i don't believe
[2:27:53] that god's promise to do these things
[2:27:57] in the last day then you've listened to
[2:28:00] a creed
[2:28:01] or some doctrine instead of the bible
[2:28:04] you have spiritual amnesia
[2:28:07] you don't know where you where you do
[2:28:10] belong then
[2:28:12] you're confused you're confusing
[2:28:15] a christian and denying the word
[2:28:19] brings you right back to spiritual
[2:28:21] amnesia again
[2:28:22] see don't you know
[2:28:26] where you stand you've got spiritual
[2:28:29] amnesia
[2:28:31] you can't identify yourself with the
[2:28:33] scriptures
[2:28:37] 23rd paragraph
[2:28:40] but what happens just can't identify
[2:28:43] ourselves no more with the word why
[2:28:47] she don't know whether she's a lodge
[2:28:52] or whether she's a church she don't know
[2:28:55] what to be called
[2:28:56] a lodge and she
[2:29:00] can't be called a church
[2:29:03] because to be called a church you would
[2:29:05] identify yourself with christ
[2:29:08] that gives spiritual
[2:29:11] amnesia so
[2:29:16] we've got a bulletin
[2:29:20] from above saying there's a disease
[2:29:25] that's trying to sweep through our lives
[2:29:30] and get us to cause us to forget
[2:29:34] the power of the resurrection
[2:29:37] to try to get us to forget that we are
[2:29:39] truly
[2:29:40] the sons and daughters of god
[2:29:44] that we've been purchased with a price
[2:29:46] our name's been put on a
[2:29:48] lamb's book of life and one day soon
[2:29:51] he's coming
[2:29:53] to take us back to where we belong
[2:29:57] don't get this amnesia church
[2:30:00] go back and look at what your testimony
[2:30:03] means
[2:30:04] go back and remember what he's done for
[2:30:07] you
[2:30:08] go back and count your blessing
[2:30:11] don't go day after day
[2:30:15] after day never thinking about him
[2:30:20] never meditating never
[2:30:23] praying if you go day after day without
[2:30:27] reading your bible
[2:30:29] without praying caught up in your work
