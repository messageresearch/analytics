because we know where we come from lord and we know where you've taken us from lord and our gathering is a gathering of thanksgiving lord of people that have recognized that without you we would have been lost without you lord we don't know where we'd have been oh god where would we have been unless you came by our way oh god and lord therefore tonight we want to put all our effort everything that we are to serve the living god and to show him our appreciation for everything that he done for us lead us and guide us oh god and forgive our shortcomings lord often time we even go and we let the trials in the trouble of this world cloud judgment oh god and but father we are reminded that we have been chosen and you have elected us and you've chosen us in you lord that we may manifest even your glory in this end time we ask right now you speak to us oh god and take the word of life lord just impart it to every heart that we may say that surely it was good to be in the house of god we don't have anything of our own but you've given us your word and your word is life to us oh god we ask you to speak to us bless our pastor as we commit ourselves tonight we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen hey man i trust you're happy to be in the house of god tonight hey man i know midweek services probably one of the toughest ones because you know people get out of work and and up and down and trying to make it to church and amen certainly believe that the lord will give you a special blessing tonight and amen let's open our bibles in uh revelation chapter 19. let's read from verse six a very familiar scripture reading and uh 1996 and it says and i and i heard as it were as it were the voice of great multitude and as the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for for the lord god omnipotent reigns reigneth he says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was was granted was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen and clean and white and for for fine linen is the righteousness of the saint now i want to point out that this this was granted to her it's not she didn't come up with it herself it was granted to her that should be arraigned and dressed that way also let's turn in matthew chapter 25 let's read from verse one it says sorry i'm going a little too fast matthew chapter the 25th chapter and the first verse it says then shall then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins it says which took their lamp and went forth to meet the bridegroom it says and five of them were wise and five were foolish it says to where they that were foolish took the lamp and took no oil with him but the wise took the all in the vessels and and and with their lamps it says while the the bridegroom terries they slumbered and sleep and slapped and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then those then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps it says and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil for our lamp is gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves they too they too try to get ready but buy for yourself and when it says and while they went to buy the bride room came it says and they they that were ready went with them to the marriage to the marriage and the door was shut it says after what came the other virgin saying lord lord open for us but the answer and said verily i say unto you i know you're not i mean let's just buy our heads our gracious father we so thankful for all that you do for us lord and we ask right now your father did you bless the few words that we would like to say and speak to our hearts as we're gathering your presence in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen man you may have your seats tonight i know we've been fellowshipping from the rising the message the rising of the sun and there's probably just a little thought that i would like to get out of that in and and and just bring out tonight now i want to start out by pointing out as we read revelation 19 and and specifically verse 7 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb's come and his wife had made herself ready now we we we know even as we read the scripture um the that what random speaks about the age that we live in it says this is the most glorious age there ever was um i believe he said that another place that if i was asked to live in any other age this is the age that i would choose we understand this is the age of great mysteries of great promises that were made since the beginning promises that we even i would even say that we're given the adam that was never fulfilled but in the end time god will bring him the game to pass we could look at it and realize it it seems to be even as we would look we know that in in luke chapter 17 the scripture will tell us about the condition that would reign that would be outside that would be happening as far as the world is concerned but yet within the the bride even as we read the scripture says let us be glad and rejoice we are not called to be the ones that are uh sad with the world with what's happening or confused with what's happening outside when we we see wars or rumors of wars or people standing against one another or the the inflation and all those things we are not called to panic with the world the scripture clearly said let us be glad and rejoice and and i want to point out it's not because we don't see what's happening it's not because we oblivious of to what's happening but the source of our happiness comes from the scripture and the promised word is because we come to the realization that this world will pass away we come to the realization that this is happening according to the promise according to the fulfillment of the prophecy that was made for the end time there is nothing new under this town and we can look at the world and see it is pretty what was predicted as even as we look in the scriptures we see those things come to pass we see them come to pass it's a source of joy for a believer why because it's god speaking to you and proving to you that his promise is true they said the world was going to get in the condition that in if i am a believer and i look at it i say praise god this was promise if i look at it and there's wars and i look at it i say praise god this was promised it was going to come to pass when i see all of this chaos and everything i would rejoice in that to know that god made a prophecy and it's coming to pass exactly as he promised he would and and but he says in this time the bride he says let us be let us be glad and rejoice so it's a time of rejoicing because we know that we are walking in the promises of god we are walking and we are seeing the things that were promised to come to pass come to pass and if it's happening outside we also have to be confident that god within the bride within the people that has gathered at the end time he's also doing according to his promise i like what our pastor said last sunday he said uh we are we have not missed anything because someone can look at the world and see and say oh my i wonder what what's going to happen next what's going to happen next you were not called to look and keep your eyes on what's happening outside you were called to keep your eyes on the word and the promise that was made to you and know that god is fulfilling it how is he fulfilling it he's opened my eyes to see what's happening because remember unless you can see it it's to them the word is revealed to them that can see it to them to them the understanding that is given those that lack understanding they walk like fools they don't know what they're doing and they're just walking and go going with the flow they will try this today they'll try that tomorrow but those that have been given understanding when they see the things that are happening in the world happen they are standing there and watching and waiting for the promise that was made to them to come and pass in their lives therefore let us be rejoicing and be glad we're not called to be sad and say well i don't know you know if i lose my job today or if this happened today what am i going to do and all those things and and and i will say this within the flesh the devil will attack us it will go through your mind and say oh what if this happened or you know we we had here you know covet and everything and and and people running to and fro not knowing what to do but we realized that god has given the bride a promise he's given this people at the end time a promise and within his promise god will protect them he didn't call them to protect themselves he didn't say you know or even say this because this becomes a key element in who we are or what our identification is at the end time if you find yourself concerned and worried and and always wondering what's going to happen what's going to happen you are not standing on the correct promise something is missing your faith has not reasoned up to what god has called you yet you're missing something you need to go back to him if you are looking at what's happening or you're looking at your condition and wondering how am i going to get out of this and what's happening oh you you're speaking like that you don't know what i'm going through i don't know what you're going to you don't know what i'm going through but one thing i know is we have a promise that has been given to us that we got to walk by and i even want to say this the things that you're going through is to take you from where you are and bring you into a certain condition it's not by accident it's not by accident the things that happens to us on the daily basis it's not by accident it's god shaping his people bringing them into this condition it says the bride had met her separated she has been given the word and only the word will get her in the condition that she needs to be and if we look outside of the world then outside of the word of god then we don't know what we're looking for so so i at the the identification of the bride at the end time is one who's looking at the promise that has been given to her who's recognizing the hour that she's living in by looking at the condition of the world but she's not caught up into the hour she's caught up within the promise that was given to her you know the barbarian tells us that well part of overcoming is to recognize the devil in every single one of his trait and when you look at the wealthy record the word to recognize recognize it doesn't mean you necessarily need to engage it's just to look and know what's behind it it's just to look and see what's motivating it is to look and see the trick and see see what the source of it is is to be able to look and see who's behind this why is this happening and everything and it doesn't mean we necessarily need to engage but the other part is to recognize our position to know what we've been called for and what is the promise of our time even as we say as far as the bride is concerned what am i standing on and what are my characteristics that i need to have at this time because only when you know what you're supposed to be then you would be able to look and expect a word to make you what that which is you what that which you're waiting for because remember you cannot be anything that you have not seen or that you don't expect or you don't know what you're looking for that the wave chief was given so we have an expectation of what we are moving towards the waveship was me to to to take out the trash to kick out all the other expectations to remove the the the fiction to remove all the other clouds and all the other things and keep your focus to give you a clear vision this is what you are walking into and this is what my expectation of you is this is what i'm taking you from where you were and i'm bringing you into that and and so that that part of what we need in this end time is the recognition or the understanding of what is my identification needs to be as far as the bride is concerned and the identification is not what we say to be the identification but what was promising the word and what god is doing in this end time and what he expects the bride to be so so i would say that tonight we have seen the fulfillment of prophecy we have seen the end time resurrection and we have seen all those things happen and those things become our identification but says in the message the unconditional covenant and i'll probably skip some for the second time it says so pentecostal people um let me skip some he says uh jesus is jesus is a is the covenant and he tore him apart at calvary received his body up and i'm speaking uh uh right now i'm reading here so we could see what what what time we're living in or what we've been called up to it says receive that receive his body up and send the holy ghost back and when the resurrection come the same spirit that was in christ in jesus christ is the only thing that will raise this body up to meet to meet to go meet that one there i said what he's saying the holy spirit the same jesus that was in the same spirit that was in christ is the only thing that will raise this body up to go meet the one there it says that makes the that makes them a husband and wife what do i mean it says the bride is the covenant people unconditional he says god called you out of the world gave you the holy ghost the seed of abraham you are tonight with a blessed promise amen it says it says oh my it says my if you then if you are abraham's seed you have this promise in you not with you but in you it says you believe god regardless of what takes place the holy ghost makes you believe it anyhow oh my brother my sister the privilege we have is we have not made ourselves what we are tonight we have not given ourselves a claim of something that we are not but the word has brought us into the condition that we are in if we believe it's because god made us believers if we are gathered here tonight it's because god gathers us here tonight because if you take god out of it he becomes a man-made a situation and and the beauty of it is because we it's so easy i tell you this to look and see that it's god in motion who's doing everything that we are seeing around us how can we gather people from four corners of the world and put him in the same room how can he put something within each and every one of you that you will hear this word tonight and say amen to it how can you put it such beautiful in such a way that our hearts are angering for the same thing it's god's who's behind it and and it says the holy spirit makes you believe it it's not nobody coming and i said something or oh the i like the way you said it that's why i believe it has nothing to do with man man will bring you explanation and explanation will get you lost but god is bringing you his spirit he's bringing you revelation is quickening something within your heart when you hear the word and something identified to what you hear and you say i believe it oh i was thinking about it this afternoon i said we read about the boy who was looking in the mirror i tell you the chief wave offering has been for the bride someone who's looking into the mirror we looked at it and we saw him and says i desire that and the word came back and it says this is just the first one you are also coming into the same thing this word was not built so we can look and i want to stress this out because it's important because oftentimes we look and say um and i believe even our pastor touched it last sunday we look at the world the word of god in the standpoint of the human realm oh i desire to be within that oh i desire to be that i hear it this morning i hear tonight and there's something within you that's hungry and that's wonderful but there's also another side of it because i want us to to see both sides of it then it's it will help us when we reconcile both sides i want to say this the the bride's manifestation at the end time is part of god's promise of what he wanted to do not what you wanted not what you desired not what you cried for i'm talking about what god what the whole mystery of the bible was all about since the beginning of the world and i will read it here god had an eternal purpose but of adam called it one eternal purpose and the eternal purpose was not even jesus christ the eternal purpose christ came so he can help that the eternal purpose may come to pass and the eternal purpose that he would have a bride of his own choosing that he he will come and dwell within his people [Music] he said he created the old earth so he can have a bride i i i think this escapes our mind i know and i believe we get caught up within the things of life and everything and and it seems like we forget to see the bigger picture the bigger picture was that god wanted to be one with his creation god wanted to make his creation and he himself dwelt within his creation and christ the coming of christ was so that he can make a way after satan came and caused the fall within the garden was that god will come and make a way so he can bring his original plan to come to pass and therefore when we look at christ when he comes and he gave his life it was so that you and i can stand here tonight and say that i am here as the representation or the manifestation of what god desire to be in the end time it's not us saying oh i want to be like god i want to be like god no it's god sitting say i want to be a man i want to walk into a body i want to do this as a man i want to defeat the devil in the mountain in my inner my bride's body i want to complete this i want what he did in the garden i want to create another bride that will come in this time and this one will never fail and yet we are sitting and say oh god oh god i desire oh if we can reconcile the two it would help us understand and the only reason i'm desiring this is because you have desired this for me you have one you have called me to be this so he says he says now oh and and i i i guess i didn't give a title um so i i i just want to say this for a few moments i want to uh uh just say we we we we read and this is from the rising of the sun i'll just paraphrase it well we we know that he he talked about he he talked about the benefactors of his resurrection he talked about how the the we are benefactors of his resurrection in other words when he came and he died there was people that benefited from that resurrection and we are sitting here as benefactors as those that have benefited from his resurrection and i believe he says once at the resurrection because he ascends quickening power to quicken us from death unto life he's come and he's done that and now he's talking about what what that resurrection was and now don't also forget that he also said and i'm paraphrasing this that the rising of the sun we can look at it either from the natural the spiritual aspect and realize the the rising of the sun was the promise that was made that there would be life on earth the rising of the sun is directly connected to life if the sun doesn't rise there's not going to be life on earth the if the sun refuses to shine there's not going to be life on earth everything is gone and and but that's why christ was typing the natural sun to say that because he rose we shall rise also because he rose we were benefactors of that resurrection that we may receive something that we may receive the same life that raised him up that he could be the same life could be in us now he says this now in paragraph 94 of the rising of the sun it says and and as christ was the first one to rise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept it says in the bright coming of christ in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there it says there will have to be a sheave wave again in the last day now don't lose track of this so there's a one rising of the sun that happened at pentecostal that we saw happen and we saw him come with the guarantee that there shall be life on earth with a guarantee that he's restoring back life but then he's promising another rising of the sun in the evening time it says there shall be one in the last day oh my he says waving of the sheave it says what was what was this what was the sheave the first one that came to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheaf he says hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and it says and the first time that they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of the dark denominationalism will be a message now yes where i'm going will be a message that will that that the full maturity of the word has turned as has turned back again into a full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there now i want to and i just want to for a moment establish what is what what what this rising of the sun that is now the first rising of the sun when he came what was at pentecost we could say we could look the church was in its in its infancy so they came out of the upper room and they were restored with gifts and and all kinds of things and they went and they heal the sick and and everything and and they need all of that but i want you to see when he's talking about the rising of the sun in the evening time it's attaching it to the maturity and the full power to be restored so and and and he brings us back to what we know to be the redemption that redemption has to part we know that the first part of redemption was the paying of the price to show that what was required was paid and he came and he paid the price and therefore we could see life restore back into the church of the living god we can see that at pentecost but the rising of the sun in the evening time is the second part that comes for him to claim and return his full power in what belonged to him that he had already paid the price for and in this rising of the sun there is a call a call for a full power and maturity and is coming into a place where the church has now become his very manifestation back again into the people why because now when the when the rising of the sun is happening at the evening time it's not calling us for us to just uh uh uh jump up in spirit and speak in tongue no it's calling for a mature pride one that can come in into his image one that can be born of his bone and power of his power one who's who's got the same characteristic that jesus christ has and one who's been brought into a maturity and she has been given the power to speak the word and as a matter of fact the prophet said that the very word of god is given to her and it's within her oh let's not miss that because by looking at it oftentimes we look and we say oh god just wants me to have the holy ghost that's not enough that's not he just don't want you to get the new birth and stay right there no there's a maturity to be manifested in the end time and that's why i'm talking about i said it's very important we know what the identification in the end time is what are we being called to and what is it that god is trying to manifest at the end time and let me repeat it again this is not us trying to become like god this is god the promise that he made the god who was the god above us who made the whole creation the god whose fullness dwelled in jesus christ there was a promise that that same fullness will come and dwelt in the body not the body of jesus christ by the bride's body and do the same work that he did amen we're not called to be a beggar oh god and if you can only help me with the sickness and he's calling you for more than that oh god if you could just help me pass this trial he's calling you for more than that he himself is promising the end time that your body will be his body he himself he he and and i know people get offended when you say this he didn't finish his work at calvary because the work that was done at calvary was the paying of the price but there was a resurrection work that had to be done in the end time where he himself will come and dwell within his people that's why i read this i said let us be glad and rejoice my brother my sister the world is in the condition that it is because it was prophesied to be that way and the only hope that could be out there can only come from you when the scripture says when people will ask what is your hope what is it when everybody is panicking when everybody is looking and they're constantly talking about what they're going through oh you don't know what's happening there's inflation and there's no raise how am i going to pay this bill the gas price just went up and this just went up there has to be a people on earth that has the hope of the resurrection that can look at those people and say you don't have to put your hope in those things you don't have to worry about the gas price you don't have to worry about the inflation you don't have to worry about the walls why because there's another hope somewhere it's not built of the elements of this world that hope is that after this world is past that i have another body waiting for me that's our inheritance that's part of our mission if i could say that's part of what we've been called to we've been called to be the representative of the body of christ on earth to do the works the same works and i've said this and i'll say it we our minds and i think that's all right god is going to help us through it our minds us always struggle with the understanding of god within our flesh we can speak about god in creation and look at the waterfalls look at mountains look at the great creation stand up and look at the majestic sky and look at it and recognize i see god like the fisherman we can look at christ and see how he lay down his life and to see how he rose the dead and he healed the second and he done things and we look at it we say that was god but yet that same manifestation has been promised to you and you look at it you say it cannot be that's why i want to say this it's not you coming into it it's god pulling you into it it's god it's not your desire to be it it's god's desire to bring it to pass i hope you don't get stumbled by this but if adam says like that that he says that god is jesus he says he did more in my ministry that he did in his own ministry he did more in this ministry than he did in his own ministry why is trying to open up your eyes to show you it's not a diluted god it's not another version of god it's the same god same in power same in everything same in attributes same in all kinds of ways why because it's not about you it's about his plan of redemption and what he wanted to do in the end time he says now i want you to listen and it says it says but now speaking about christ and as i read this i want you to think about what i'm saying it's about the promise of his manifestation throughout the ages he says but now he is standing in the middle of his church of the church he says as he stand there revealing he is revealing who he is in the last age he called himself the author of the creation of god this is not it says this is another creation he has to be he says he has to do with his church this is a special designation of himself special not of you of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride do we believe we were created and i'm saying this because i i believe we in such a time even as our pastor is bringing why are we going through these things why are we looking at it line by line and verse by verse and chapter by chapter why are we looking because it gives us an expectation of what we are supposed to walk into it gives us the expectation of what we ought to be doing or what we ought to be manifesting for the time he didn't call us so we could just say there's a bride praise god there's a bride no he called us because there's one place he he calls us out and he says let us be like joshua and caleb in other words he's setting the promise before you and he's wanting for you and i to be like joshua and caleb and say this is my portion for the age that i'm living in therefore i am going to claim what belongs to me this was i i and i i want to say this it doesn't matter if you understand it or not it's not about understanding god gives the understanding when he wants to god gives the revelation when he wants to but all i care about is what it is say for my age and i will keep reading it until it brings forth the revelation for me to understand what he said and he's so marvelous because he keeps revealing it every time every time we read it we see something that we've never seen before why is he doing it it's walking you step by step into the change of your body it's god's doing it's not our doing it's god's promise it's not our promise it's him doing these things so he says the heavenly bride groom created his own bride as the spirit of god he says he came down and created a virgin mary the cell from which his body was made he says i want to repeat that he created the very cell the the very cell in the womb of mary for the body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human over supply by mary that would have been sinful making sinful mankind producing a body it says that would have not produced the last adam oh why because the last adam was a quickening power he was not a he was not a living spirit like the first one the first one was a living spirit but this one was to dare to bring forth back to life to bring adam back to life the first adam came in the fall but the second adam was the very life that would come within his lungs he says the last adam of him was said lo a body has not prepared it has now father prepared for me it said not me not he said god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was he he says he was the son of god he was the new creation man and god made and joined he was the first of a new of this new creek new race he says he is the head of a new race the head of a new race so if he is the head of a new race how is this other race coming from how is it coming it would come the same way as the head came what what was that it was by god's word not had nothing to do with women with mary having nothing to do with you the same way didn't have anything to do with mary the same way it has nothing to do with you it was god by the by the promise that he made a new body and stop preparing me he brought that body so that the spirit of jesus can come and dwell and the same way with the bride he spoke in his word and his word is producing the very body that the spirit will come and dwell he says this new creation is not the old made over or it could not be called a new creation this is this is this is exactly what it says it is new creation now i want to skip for a little bit so i can go and it says this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose this was his purpose this purpose took form to relaxing that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and seen and see him see himself still in the midst of his church the oil in the candle sticker was him it's always been his life it's his life in christ it's his life in the messengers that's why the prophet tells us if we can't see jesus christ in every scripture go read it back again why because it's always a hymn if we if we put ourselves out there then we run as we run ourselves in trouble but if we can put him there then we understand it's him in us doing the work he says in the last day in the midst of his church as the author of this new creation his sovereign power brought this to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation you are elected to be part of the new creation otherwise you wouldn't have been. and i say this let's not stumble over simplicity you know and i i it's very important when when it comes to the word of god it's very important we always take it down back to the basics of what he's trying to tell us when we get it complicated that's when we don't know is it him is it me is it me and him or is it me him and us and everything oh i tell you you'll go crazy trying to figure out the relationship he's our father he is we are his sons we are his bride we are his servant we are all those things but why is he calling us the bride and the entire because now he's elevating us from not just a servant not just a son he's bringing out even to be co-equal with him so we can reign with him why he's bringing us into a level of power that we never had before and in doing so it's bringing us into his own character that we made this place on character i want to say this that's why it's so important every time we project we project him he didn't call us to project our own mind he called us to project him when we project him we are successful when we project our own mind we we we mess it up why because it's always him it's always him and he said that this church in the end time will produce another book of acts now it's not the book of acts just so we can have the works but it's the book of acts to have his nature his character and his word to be equal exactly like he is so when we speak it's him speaking and not us so he says now listen as it says i i wrote it down here on top as a title the most important thing he says i believe in paradox yes sir i believe i believe in them with all my heart it says it was a paradox when all those smart man that was in the world and god put the key of the kingdom in the hand of one that was considered an ignorant and unlearned think about that he says that's right one of the smartest men in the world in that day was caiaphasis the high priest another was the emperor the king and the great men on the earth like king like presidents and so forth and this great man it says and and what's the most important thing in the world it says is god's church god made the earth he made it for a purpose to take a church out of it a bride and that's the most important job in the world oh my you know yeah we are and we take pride i'm a farmer i'm an engineer you know i'm a uh uh uh a scientist and i'm this and you know what are you i'm this you know we take pride in it and yet he's saying the most important thing is that you are his church you are his building or if we can put that before everything else that we do if for the when we look at ourselves the very when we look at the consideration we have for our own self if we can put that consideration above all else to begin with i miss bride to begin with i miss church to begin with i've been called for his manifestation if we can only understand what god is wanting out of us if we can understand what identification is giving us not the identification we are giving ourselves but the identification that he is giving us he says now if god said if god said multiply to his bride and he says to adam he says to adam and replenish the earth and multiply and replenish the earth and and and that was god's commission and she would have done it it says and he would and he would have but mixing themselves together what happened he says when adam got ready to come to her she was already a mother he says see what i mean he says now the same thing happened to christ's church christ bride now we are going back farther than done that in a minute it says now notice is this right it says notice in this bride what did she what did she what did she do then his first child came forth it was a bastard child and he was full of death and caused death ev he says everyone since then is dead everything since then is death and now you see he had sex that's why he's dying it wasn't it says if it wasn't sex it says when god give commission which cannot perish think about it now they failed to bring forth the commission but god had already spoken his word and his word could not go down and perish he says god's word is eternal he cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the earth that was god's eternal purpose to carry that out you cannot it cannot die because it's it's his word you have to live it says if that child had been brought forth right it had been brought forth no death but she couldn't wait he says that's what the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup and screaming and jumping and speaking in tongues on something instead of waiting on the real word of god to bring manifest to to to the will of the real word of god to be made manifest through the bride oh i thought about that i said he he wants us to wait on the word he doesn't want us to run forth and say oh i got it and it's happening all this is happening over here oh that's there he's saying that i have given you my word and my word cannot go to the ground i have given you my promise and it will come to pass so instead of us growing and jumping and doing all of that is saying you come back and you stay with the word you stay with what i said i will come to bring it in the season that i desire to bring it oh i i began to think about the disciples on the day of pentecost oh i'll tell you they didn't go one around and everything they went and stayed with what was given to them they began to recite the promise that he gave them they began to speak one another about the promise you know he said we should gather here you know he told us he will send his spirit you know he said when he after the third day he will raise again we know he said this it was true you know he told that about that and that came to pass you know we have the scriptures we've seen him every time they touched him every time they did something we are able to track it right back into the word of god it was the fulfillment of all the prophecy that was written about him oh by the time they put all of that together the promise come to pass within them it wasn't them jumping around and just shout no they were focused on what was given to them what is the word what is the promise of my time what is said that i'm going to be what is it that he talks and about this bride oh i tell you the identification of the bride is no different than that it's when we focus and we know what he has said he will bring forth the revelation of it because remember it's from quickening to quickening to quickening to quickening it's not once and done he is walking with you every step of the way just like the disciples on the road to emmaus remember he said that was a prophecy that would come and they were walking and and for some reason he says what are you guys what is it that you're talking about what are you sad about he said you don't know we just received a man we thought it was him who was going to deliver and and restore the kingdom of israel and yet they took him and they killed him and everything you don't know about this event he said what things they threw out the hearts and the misunderstanding about all of that and everything and it says all full and slow of heart to understand the things that were spoken what is that scripture says he began to expound upon them one verse by person they would ask questions and will answer that's what he's doing he's answering all your questions he's revealing himself more and more i say this we know this message we we we have more revelation today than we had a year ago we have more revelation than we did a week ago why because it's him expounding on the things that he promised showing verse by verse showing line by line showing what is he doing it's opening the way he's leading you it's leading you what is he leading you to to himself to himself the bride of christ is not touched by any man the bride of christ is not to be touched by any man if she receives her food her understanding her revelation from him from the word the promised word that is given if the musician could comment looks like i did what i always do he says let us he he reads this it says and i know you know the quote very well where it speaks about the harmony that existed between the father and the son so he speaks about the harmony that existed between the father and son and then he says that same harmony has to exist between christ and his bride the same and now listen to this this is where i said the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has that said the lord it says now then it is dramatized so the holy spirit waters it and grows it that's the word listen to what he says in the next paragraph he says it says they don't they only do his will amen i believe that one it says no one can persuade them differently they have thy say of the lord and they keep still then they will do the works of god for it is himself in them it is himself in them how was he in christ it's by promise in fact i believe the prophet said someplace that jesus was a predestinated creature of time he comes and he speaks the word the vessel comes and he comes and dwells in the vessel no different from the bride he speak the word we come and he comes and he dwells in the bride in paragraph 142 for one one 4 22 he says now let us stand like joshua and caleb now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background it says now let us stand like caleb and joshua as we stand as we see the promised land coming in sight it's near the time to be given joshua in hebrew means savior to promise the end time leader to take the church over caleb represented the true believer who stayed with joshua god's god started israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so the last day church let's not go for anything different it was the promise that god gave it was the promise that they heard through the mouth of joshua that brought them past they came and they crossed not just across the red sea with moses but the cross they came and crossed jordan with joshua so they can get into the promised land and i say let us be glad and rejoice why because we have been given the word to make ourselves ready he spoke about those versions i didn't get there but you look at it what happened they came and they heard the same word they listened to the same word and everything but while the word was going forth there was a group that was actually making themselves ready but the other group was not they didn't seek for the oil while there was time for them to get the oil they slumber and sleep and then when they woke up when they cry came it was no more time to go and look for the oil so we could say oh god as this promises are coming and i can see one and i can see one and you can give me let me get the all that i need oh god fill me up with all that i need to have let me walk in this promise i don't desire anything i don't desire the world i desire the word of god i desire to see the manifestation what was spoken about this age what was spoken of the bride the resurrection in the end time i want to see it within my body why because i know you promised that's what you want to do let's all stand tonight it's not us trying to be like him it's him coming down wanting to use your flesh for the promise that he made for the manifestation of the end time oh if we can only walk another no i have i have been given a promise and that's what i'm walking in let's just bow heads our gracious father we so thankful lord for everything you do for us father your word is so precious to us and and i can truly say with all my heart lord every time we hear it across this pulpit sundays and wednesdays and sundays and wednesdays lord we so enjoy it lord uh we are just a heartbeat uh something within our heart just beating to wait for that next manifestation in expectation of what is it that you want to do what is your next move how do you want to lead us how do you what do you want to do for us we pray father that we may always remain under that expectation as you bring your word to come to pass why because it's the way you've made for us to make it oh god you didn't give us you said you to your army you gave them the best weapon that you had and you didn't give them one thing and then come and change it the next day you gave them one weapon the same weapon that you gave in the beginning it's the same weapon you're giving today and that's your word and you say that your word will be able to overcome the enemy any place anytime under any circumstances lord we take it within our hearts and we pray let the spirit of god come and quicken it within us lord and make every word lord quicken it quicken every part of it so we may come into the image of who you are father lead us and guide us lord we're so thankful for all that you do for us lord we ask that you be with us as we commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and ask amen amen let's just sing that that's why the cause man come and want what you want for me [Music] best [Music] for me [Music] for me let's sing that again tonight [Music] for me [Music] that you know what's best [Applause] what you want for me [Music] lord i come to you let my heart be changed [Music] lord [Music] in me will be stripped away [Music] by the power of your love hold me [Music] surrounds me [Music] you [Music] to face the knowledge of [Music] lord you knew my mind [Music] in [Music] and my every day [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord draw me to your side [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] amen that was wonderful word tonight and something to look forward to if he proved that every step of the way until today will stops them from proving it now it's it's a prophecy amen [Music] that certainly was beautiful wasn't it amen it's not us trying to be like god it's god trying to get in us and aren't you glad he predestinated it because he'll supply the grace the mercy the correction the judgment to bring it to pass you know i just thought uh brother stephen that was amazing it matched just exactly with what we sat in fellowship with we're at the men's breakfast and i really encourage you brothers if you can get out to that men's breakfast don't miss it but we all were there and we just finally matthew just finally set out he said you know when you really look at it it's a setup we're trapped into god's will because there's one thing god can't do and that's lie so if in his mind he said you're going to be part of my bride you ma it's hard to kick against the prick but he don't fail amen i was inspired by that i just thought that was just fantastic preaching there's so many statements that he made i'm gonna ask him for his notes because i just i just love that this evening hey amen i i trust there's uh quite a few people watching online i don't know i know it's hard for people now because gas is expensive and you you come a long way and and it costs 70 80 dollars now to fill your tank but i like what brother orlando said he said i ain't going to waste my gas money i'm going to come to church and get something from god amen so we just keep that attitude i think god will richly bless us and let us grow in the lord so once again as we bow our heads if you have a request that you'd like to lift your hand to the lord you say lord i i heard the message tonight and lord i put too much emphasis on my faults i've spent too much time looking at my failures lord and the only way to overcome is by your word and lord so i'm going to put my eyes on what you said about me what you promised that you wanted to do in this last day through me and i'm going to look at that lord and that's going to be my strength to overcome is your word and what that you've spoken and what that you've said is going to transpire father i'd ask that you would change my mental approach that you would change my my mental attitude father with the right mental attitude it brings every promise to god the path and lord i ask you that you would help me only let your word affect my atmosphere lord i have my hand lifted up father i also have loved ones that are in need and father there's those that are in financial trouble lord and they're lifting their hands father because there's no need that we have that you don't already know but father we're turning it to you and casting our cares upon you father so when you answer our prayers we can have fellowship and testimony with you so father look upon every heart that's here this evening with their hand raised with their requests laid at your feet father as we stand here before your throne giving you praise and lord we ask that you grant these lord and we'll testify of your goodness we'll tell the world of your mercy lord will speak of the power by which you delivered us father the grace and love which you answered our requests will give you the glory you deserve in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen let's sing this song as a dismissal redeemed how i love to proclaim it amen giveth redeemed how i love to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of the lamb [Music] see his child and forever i am [Music] forever [Music] the land which my rapture can't tell i know that the light of his presence with me does [Music] [Music] i think of my blessed reading i think of him all day [Music] long his love is [Music] [Music] i know the king in his life [Music] of the land [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] wow [Music] don't forget [Music] oh
