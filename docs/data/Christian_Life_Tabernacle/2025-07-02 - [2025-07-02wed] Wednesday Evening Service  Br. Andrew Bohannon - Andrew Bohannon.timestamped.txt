[12:05] Lord, may your spirit just give us a

[30:35] Praise the Lord. What a promise that'll
[30:38] raise us up in the power of his love.
[30:40] Amen. How many are happy to be in the
[30:42] house of the Lord tonight? God has
[30:44] something special for us tonight. Amen.
[30:47] The scripture says, "Wherever two or
[30:49] three are gathered in my name, I'll be
[30:51] in the midst." So, we're not looking at
[30:53] each other, but we're looking to the
[30:55] promised giver. Amen. If you have a
[30:57] special need and you just want to make
[30:59] it known, let's pray together. Heavenly
[31:01] Father,
[31:03] Lord, we just want to tell you, Lord,
[31:05] how much your love has made a difference
[31:07] in our lives, Lord, Lord, if it wasn't
[31:10] for your love and your goodness, Lord,
[31:12] to oh God, die that death on Calvary,
[31:16] Lord, we would be lost and undone. But
[31:18] oh father, Lord, that great love and
[31:21] that mercy that was shed forth for us,
[31:24] Lord. It gives us a place today in your
[31:26] economy, Father. And we're here, your
[31:29] children want to worship you, Lord. Want
[31:31] to say thank you, Lord, for that great
[31:34] price that you paid, oh God. Lord, and
[31:37] to know that it was your desire, oh God,
[31:39] not to just be in this building with us
[31:42] to encourage us, but oh God, to live in
[31:45] us, Lord, by the resurrection power, oh
[31:48] God, to to have life and that more
[31:51] abundantly, Lord, to know to know that
[31:54] we know that we know. Not only are you
[31:56] the lifegiver, but you're the
[31:58] resurrection, Father. What a privileged
[32:01] people we are, Lord, to oh God, be able
[32:04] to worship you, oh God, in in spirit and
[32:08] in truth, Lord. Oh God, we can't praise
[32:11] you and we can't thank you enough, Lord.
[32:13] But oh God, our our words would fail us,
[32:16] but Lord, hear our hearts, Lord. how we
[32:19] desire, oh God, to give our all and to
[32:21] be all that you called us to be. Father,
[32:24] as we commit, oh God, this little time
[32:26] of fellowship, Lord, we desire that you
[32:29] would speak to every heart, Lord. Lord,
[32:32] I'm recognizing oh God and this moment
[32:35] my inability Lord but Father when you
[32:40] came Lord and the resurrection come upon
[32:43] us Lord you give us ability you give us
[32:45] ability Lord and for that we call upon
[32:49] you and we pray that you'd be the
[32:51] speaker and the hearer and Lord when we
[32:53] leave here Lord can we say like those
[32:56] that were going from Emmas
[32:58] did not our hearts burn as he spoke to
[33:01] us along along the way as we commit your
[33:03] people, ourselves into your faithful
[33:06] hands. And Lord, we just thank you for
[33:08] this time in Jesus Christ. Amen.
[33:12] Amen.
[33:16] Well, praise the Lord. If you have your
[33:18] Bibles and we'll just go straight to the
[33:20] word of God. We're so happy to be home.
[33:22] We certainly appreciate everybody's
[33:24] prayers and things that uh while we were
[33:26] away, the Lord was so gracious to us and
[33:29] but we're so happy to be home and to be
[33:31] with you, be here for a short season and
[33:34] then we'll be back running. But um if
[33:37] you want to turn with me, we're going to
[33:38] go to Galatians chapter 2 and verse 15.
[33:43] Galatians chapter 2
[33:46] and verse 15.
[33:48] We'll also read
[33:51] um in Matthew chapter 5, but in
[33:55] Galatians chapter 2,
[33:59] Paul's speaking here. He says,
[34:02] "We who are Jews by nature and not
[34:05] sinners of the Gentiles know that a man
[34:09] is not justified by the works of the
[34:11] law, but by faith
[34:14] of Jesus Christ. Even we that believe in
[34:17] Jesus Christ, that we might be justified
[34:20] by the faith of Christ, and not by the
[34:22] works of the law, but by the works of
[34:25] the law, shall no flesh be justified.
[34:28] But if while we seek to be justified by
[34:31] Christ, we ourselves are found sinners,
[34:33] is therefore Christ the minister of sin?
[34:36] God forbid. For if I build again the
[34:39] things which I destroy, I make myself a
[34:41] transgressor.
[34:43] For I through the law am dead to the law
[34:47] that I might live unto God. I am
[34:50] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[34:52] live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[34:57] And the life which I now live.
[35:01] There was a life that we once lived. But
[35:04] he's saying there's a difference now.
[35:07] The life that I now live. Amen.
[35:12] The life that I live in the flesh, I
[35:14] live by the faith of the son of God who
[35:17] loved me and gave himself for me. I do
[35:20] not frustrate the grace of God. For if
[35:23] the righteousness came by the law, then
[35:25] Christ died in vain.
[35:28] Also, Matthew chapter 5.
[35:32] Well, I was just thinking about it. Um,
[35:35] as we're coming up to Independence Day
[35:37] and you know, we rejoice
[35:42] that our great nation, you know, there
[35:44] was blood spilled that we can be free,
[35:47] that we can worship God according to the
[35:49] dictates of our own conscience. And, you
[35:52] know, I think about the the love of
[35:55] Christ. When Christ died, he gave us
[35:59] that same freedom from sin. He gave us
[36:02] freedom from sin. Right. That's right.
[36:04] Oh my. To think of it like our human
[36:07] nature, our sin nature. We were in
[36:09] bondage to it. But somebody paid the
[36:12] price. And it was his great love to
[36:15] manifest that because you were sons and
[36:17] daughters of God. Praise God for that
[36:20] great release. Thank God for freedom and
[36:24] salvation.
[36:26] Oh my.
[36:28] Matthew chapter 5 and verse 11
[36:32] says this, "Blessed are ye when men
[36:35] shall revile you and persecute you, and
[36:38] shall say all manner of evil against you
[36:40] falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be
[36:44] exceedingly glad, for great is your
[36:47] reward in heaven, for such for so
[36:50] persecuted the prophets which were
[36:52] before you. Ye are the salt of the
[36:55] earth." But if the salt had lost its
[36:57] savior, wherewith shall it be salted? It
[37:01] is henceforth good for nothing, but is
[37:03] cast out, it is to be cast out, and to
[37:06] be trotten under the foot of men.
[37:09] Ye, oh the light of the world. A city
[37:12] that is set on the hill cannot be hid.
[37:15] Neither do men light a candle and put it
[37:18] under a bushel, but on a candlestick
[37:22] that it may light un that it may give
[37:25] light unto all that are in the house.
[37:28] Let your light so shine before men that
[37:31] they may see your good works and glorify
[37:34] your father which is in heaven. You may
[37:37] have your seats. We trust the Lord will
[37:40] add a blessing to the reading of his
[37:42] word. You know, it's uh tremendous how
[37:46] the word of God instructs us
[37:51] and it's a personal instruction.
[37:53] Let your light so shine before men. You
[37:57] know, we have a job to do. We're to let
[38:01] our light shine. You know, and I think
[38:04] about it, you know, all too often, you
[38:07] know, we get to our jobs and we get to
[38:10] our school and we just go on in the
[38:12] regular routine of life and yet we
[38:15] forget who we are. We forget that we got
[38:18] a job to do, right? when Christ came and
[38:22] paid the price for us to set us free
[38:24] from the bondage of humanity, our sin
[38:27] nature, to to take the blessings of God
[38:30] and consume it upon our own thinking,
[38:33] our own lust, and things like that. But
[38:35] that's not the thing. You know, God
[38:37] wanted to to for you to have a part in
[38:41] redemption. Think about it. When God
[38:44] comes to you as an individual, it's the
[38:46] grace of God to you. Amen. It awakens
[38:49] something in you that you have a hunger
[38:51] for God. You have a thirst for God, that
[38:54] God would do the same works that he did
[38:57] when you when you hear about what he did
[38:59] in Christ, then all of a sudden there's
[39:02] something that believes that God can do
[39:04] the same because he's the same. Do you
[39:07] believe that?
[39:09] That's that's the cry of the believer's
[39:12] heart is resurrect in me this same life.
[39:16] Right? That's what he came to do. He
[39:19] came to bring that love. He came to cap
[39:22] us off with divine love. I mean, we see
[39:26] it today. The people are growing cold on
[39:30] love. There is no kind, brotherly
[39:33] kindness in this world anymore.
[39:37] But I tell you this, this night today,
[39:41] you are God's billboards.
[39:43] There's a thirsty world out there. and
[39:46] they're looking around, where can I find
[39:48] a resource? Where can I find hope? Where
[39:52] can I find joy? Where can I find peace?
[39:55] Where can I find good health?
[39:59] You know, here we are. We we sometimes
[40:03] we forget why we're here. Where did we
[40:06] come from? And where are we going?
[40:09] You see, I believe that God has put it
[40:11] within our hearts for a certain kind of
[40:14] maturity. We must come into shakina
[40:18] glory, the presence of the light of this
[40:20] hour and mature.
[40:23] There's a cry in our heart to grow in
[40:25] grace and knowledge, not to be whooping
[40:28] ourselves and and and being rude with
[40:31] ourselves for our faults and failures.
[40:33] We have a blood. Amen. The scripture
[40:36] speaks in in Hebrews chapter 4. He says,
[40:41] let's just read it. There's so much food
[40:44] in there. I just I don't want to short
[40:47] change it because it's so powerful. If
[40:50] you can take the word of God and you can
[40:52] see it's you.
[40:54] It's your job. It's it's who you are.
[40:57] It's your identification.
[41:00] You could step into the vision tonight.
[41:04] Oh my. Just to think that all that
[41:06] Jehovah, all that God was, he poured
[41:10] into Christ. And all that Christ is,
[41:13] he's poured into you. He's poured into
[41:15] you. You are the living epistle read of
[41:19] all men. Think of it.
[41:25] My Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews. Hebrews.
[41:29] Hebrews chapter 4.
[41:35] Well, I just praise the Lord for his
[41:37] goodness. If he can awaken something
[41:40] within me, I need God. I need God to
[41:44] awaken me to this reality.
[41:48] It's I in you and you in me. Oh, this is
[41:51] the joy of our God. He wants it. It was
[41:55] his heart purpose. That's what our
[41:58] prophet taught us. All of when we look
[42:00] around in the world, all the suffering
[42:02] of the believers of old, they went
[42:04] through it, but it was it was their
[42:06] hour. But this is our hour to be to
[42:09] think of it that we're partakers of
[42:11] divine nature by promises. A and the
[42:15] whole plan of this whole thing is that
[42:17] he would have a bride of his own
[42:19] choosing. That's you,
[42:24] the bride of Christ. We want to rise and
[42:27] shine. We want to let our light so
[42:29] shine.
[42:31] My
[42:40] Hebrews chapter 4, it says this in 14.
[42:44] Seeing then that we have a great high
[42:47] priest that is passed into the heavens,
[42:52] Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast
[42:56] our profession. You know, it's so
[42:58] amazing to think that a profession is
[43:01] like somebody's occupation.
[43:04] You know, don't let go of your
[43:06] testimony. If God has saved you, tell
[43:09] somebody.
[43:10] Embody that reality day by day. When you
[43:14] make a mistake, don't look at your
[43:16] mistake. Look at the one who saved you.
[43:20] Don't you want to hold fast to your
[43:22] profession. You're a professional
[43:25] Christian
[43:26] because it's by the blood of God.
[43:30] It's by the grace of God.
[43:33] That's a reality.
[43:36] Amen. All the secrets of God are being
[43:39] made known.
[43:41] My one day that great secret, that great
[43:45] reality that God is in you as a young
[43:48] person. God is in you as an older
[43:50] person. God is in you in a young sister
[43:53] or in a mother. One of these days you're
[43:55] going to say like Moses, he began to
[43:58] say, "I'm Moses."
[44:02] My
[44:04] see yourself in the scriptures. See
[44:06] yourself in the promises for this hour.
[44:18] For we have not a high priest which
[44:21] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[44:23] our infirmities, but was in all points
[44:26] tempted like we are, yet without sin.
[44:31] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[44:33] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[44:37] and find grace to help in the time of
[44:41] need. Well, I tell you, if there's ever
[44:44] a time to find some grace, it's now.
[44:49] This hour, we need more grace.
[44:53] We need grace because that's what we're
[44:55] saved by. We're saved by grace. And we
[44:58] don't want to let go of our profession.
[45:00] I was saved by grace. I'm no good, but
[45:03] by his grace. We want to constantly lift
[45:07] up the spirit of grace in our lives.
[45:10] Amen. Amen. I am what I am by the grace
[45:13] of God.
[45:15] It's not by good works, but by grace,
[45:20] Jesus Christ, he'd give me a gift of
[45:23] faith of who I am, what I'm called for.
[45:27] Amen. Right. That God has sent a
[45:30] message. He sent light in the evening
[45:33] time. Amen. He promised you and me the
[45:37] path to glory you shall surely find.
[45:41] Yes, sir. In Psalm 16, he says, "The
[45:44] path of life, you shall find the path of
[45:47] life." There is no doubt about that.
[45:51] And that path of life is full of joy in
[45:55] his presence. I want to hold fast to my
[45:58] profession. God wants you to be full of
[46:01] joy.
[46:04] As a spiritfilled believer, there is a
[46:08] joy bell ringing even in death.
[46:12] thinking about a brother's testimony. He
[46:15] was telling, I think it was Paul Rder,
[46:17] and they came in to sing some songs for
[46:19] him when he was sitting in there. And he
[46:21] began to say, "Who's dying, me or you?
[46:24] Pull the shades back. Go get my brother.
[46:26] Get him over here. Let's sing some
[46:28] snappy gospel songs." You know, there
[46:30] ain't no trial. There ain't no darkness
[46:34] that'll keep me from shining the light
[46:36] of God.
[46:37] This is the hour to have joy unspeakable
[46:40] and full of glory. Let the joy bells
[46:43] ring. People are so depressed. There's
[46:45] pills for everything.
[46:48] There's energy drinks for this or or
[46:51] drugs for that. People need pep pills.
[46:54] They run to this and that. But you're
[46:55] God's billboard. You're different.
[46:59] You have a home in glory. When this
[47:02] thing is all over, you'll have a life
[47:05] that is never ending.
[47:09] Because you've trusted in one that made
[47:12] that promise. It was by grace.
[47:16] Oh my. To think that he's asked us, he
[47:19] said, "Come boldly to the throne of
[47:21] grace." If we had to go to a throne
[47:24] where there was a bunch of money and it
[47:27] was an endless supply, you would want to
[47:29] go and say, "Hey, you told me I can come
[47:32] and draw dividends from this bank." But
[47:35] I tell you today, the scripture says,
[47:37] "Come boldly to the throne of grace that
[47:40] you might receive grace to help." Oh my,
[47:45] we are a needy people. God's built it to
[47:48] where he would supply our need. So when
[47:52] you come into the needs, just know that
[47:54] God's on the other side to provide grace
[47:57] to help.
[48:00] Ain't that wonderful? So when you come
[48:03] against it, we don't have to fear what's
[48:06] around the next corner because we have a
[48:09] God that is he's on his throne
[48:13] and that throne is in your heart. When
[48:15] you receive forgiveness, that spirit of
[48:18] grace starts renewing you. It starts
[48:20] washing you. It tells you you're not all
[48:23] those actions that you've been doing.
[48:26] That's not who you are. You're smoking.
[48:28] You're drinking. You're lying. You're
[48:30] stealing. The God of grace is here to
[48:33] take you from your condition. My grace
[48:35] is here to rescue you. My grace is here
[48:38] to lift up and change this vile
[48:41] situation that you got trapped in. You
[48:44] didn't do it. The devil tricked you into
[48:46] it.
[48:48] That wasn't who you are. I've come to
[48:50] tell you who you are. It's time to rise
[48:52] and shine for the glory of God. It's not
[48:55] time to back up. It's time to go to the
[48:58] throne of grace boldly that we might
[49:01] find help. Oh my. To think if you can
[49:05] find help when you're in trouble. You're
[49:07] you're aband you're all of a sudden on
[49:10] the side of the road and you had a long
[49:12] trip and all of a sudden you ran out of
[49:14] gas. Oh my, I'm out of gas. Lord, I
[49:19] prayed before I left and why am I out of
[49:22] gas? Oh my God, you've abandoned me. Oh,
[49:28] wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got a
[49:30] promise.
[49:32] The promise says that I can go boldly.
[49:35] Don't I want to don't don't don't let
[49:38] loose of my profession.
[49:40] It was it was grace that started this
[49:42] thing.
[49:44] It's grace that'll finish it. If I make
[49:46] it there, it was by his grace. He that
[49:50] started it by his grace will finish it
[49:52] by his grace.
[49:56] I'm out of gas, Lord. I I'm out of gas.
[49:59] I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. But
[50:02] your scripture says to come boldly, and
[50:06] I'm coming because you got something for
[50:08] me here.
[50:11] I'm not going to try to figure this
[50:12] thing out.
[50:15] I'm going to trust in your grace. How
[50:17] many can testify that you've been up
[50:20] against it and you say, "I don't know
[50:21] how I'm going to go over this. There's
[50:24] no way under it." But the grace of God
[50:26] has provided a way through it. Amen. God
[50:30] has constantly proved to his believers
[50:33] that he will never leave you and he'll
[50:35] never forsake you. Mankind can forsake
[50:38] you. Your best friend can turn his back
[50:41] on you, but Jesus Christ will never fail
[50:44] you. It's we fail oursel. We fail to
[50:48] have the right motive. We fail to have
[50:50] the wrong the right understanding.
[50:53] But if we just hold on, hold on to the
[50:56] promise, God will bring his grace.
[51:01] That's the power of the believer today.
[51:04] And we want our atmosphere to be shining
[51:08] this light to a world that's full of
[51:10] critics. It's full of judgments. It's
[51:13] full of harassments.
[51:16] They're all bound up. The world is
[51:19] falling apart. They're in confusion.
[51:23] But oh my, to be the people that are
[51:26] God's billboards, there's some of our
[51:28] brothers that are out there in darkness.
[51:32] And God is trusting that there's
[51:34] billboards out there
[51:37] that just the way you conduct your life,
[51:40] the way that you drive your car. Uh
[51:43] Lord, help me.
[51:46] How fast am I driving?
[51:49] I mean, I know a lot of people who drive
[51:51] with me are terrorized. So, Lord, give
[51:54] me grace.
[51:57] I ride with some people that I'm
[51:58] terrorized with, too.
[52:00] But we're to be different. That's right.
[52:03] You know, a lot of times advertisements,
[52:07] you know, they advertise a lot of
[52:09] something.
[52:10] You know, and the prophet of God when he
[52:12] was ministering, let your light so
[52:14] shine, he was like a lot of people's
[52:15] advertisements, you know, they have this
[52:18] big beautiful picture of this nice steak
[52:20] and it's you can see it's sizzling
[52:23] like and just just everything seems so
[52:27] appealing and and it appeals to those
[52:30] who are hungry. So, you know what they
[52:31] do? They drop in. Man, they got great
[52:34] biscuits, but that steak was terrible.
[52:38] What?
[52:40] A lot of advertisement.
[52:42] A lot of people say things, but they
[52:45] really don't mean it. Let that not be
[52:48] for us.
[52:51] Let it be that our conversation is
[52:55] constantly seasoned with grace.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:01] You know, God is he's entrusting you and
[53:04] me to be the light of the world. He He
[53:09] already said you are. You are the light
[53:12] of the world. And you become the light
[53:16] as you receive it. Ain't that wonderful?
[53:26] Matthew 10:7 it says, "Go ye and as you
[53:30] go, preach, saying, the kingdom of God
[53:32] is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the
[53:35] leper, raise the dead, cast out devils.
[53:38] Freely you have received, freely give."
[53:43] Well, if there is part of the
[53:46] ingredients that our pastor was telling
[53:48] us about, these are ingredients. We know
[53:51] that this is what is in us potentially
[53:54] sir, but we want to realize it. What has
[53:58] God freely given us?
[54:01] One one thing I'll say is we have to
[54:03] hearken back to our own testimony.
[54:05] Sometimes we forget, you know, 20 when I
[54:09] was I just turned 50 this year. And so
[54:11] when I think back when I was 22 and God
[54:14] was really dealing with my heart, you
[54:16] know, you you you forget sometimes what
[54:19] a stinker you were and how nasty and
[54:23] rude you were. But then sometimes you
[54:26] get going down this line so long you
[54:28] forget that people are been bondage.
[54:31] You've been liberated and walking a
[54:34] different walk in the spirit of liberty.
[54:37] But we don't want to use our liberty as
[54:38] a cloak. Amen. We We don't want to be
[54:42] hiding the grace of God the way God
[54:46] dealt with us. It was freely given to
[54:49] us. The grace and mercies of God. If I
[54:53] deserved hell, which I did, but then his
[54:57] mercy comes and forgives me and pardons
[55:00] me. Oh my, I think about the the parable
[55:04] of the man. He had a debt and he could
[55:07] not pay it. And all of a sudden, he's
[55:09] coming before the the the one he owed
[55:12] the debt
[55:14] and he says
[55:16] he's like, "Look, man. You're going to
[55:18] have to pay with I'm going to sell your
[55:20] children, your wife, your all your
[55:22] possessions cuz you need to pay this
[55:23] debt. Oh, be merciful to me. Give me
[55:27] time. I'll straighten it up. Give me
[55:30] time. I'm I'm pleading the cause. Please
[55:33] be merciful to me. He says, "Okay, you
[55:36] know what? I'll just straight take your
[55:38] debt away.
[55:42] Your debt is free. You're free.
[55:46] Now, what are you going to do? And he
[55:48] just goes on and he forgot.
[55:51] He forgot. Or maybe he willingly forgot
[55:55] because there was somebody who owed him
[55:56] like 50 cents or something crazy. You're
[55:59] like, "Hey, you better pay this."
[56:04] And he was choking him out like, you
[56:06] know, and then when the judge found out,
[56:10] he said, "This man, he's acting that
[56:13] way.
[56:14] Okay, bring him here. Oh my, you know
[56:19] the story. I don't want to have these
[56:21] kind of attitudes. I don't want my
[56:23] atmosphere to have any ounce of me in it
[56:28] and what I think. I want it to be the
[56:30] grace of God.
[56:32] This this hour is the headstone crying
[56:36] grace. Grace.
[56:39] Isn't it amazing? Grace.
[56:42] I I still My heart still pulsates and
[56:45] loves that wonderful grace that saved
[56:49] me. Amen. Do you?
[56:56] Well, I was just here to stir up your
[56:58] mind
[57:00] and uh we're just so thankful to be
[57:03] back. And
[57:05] maybe we'll just have a few more words
[57:07] and try to find a place to close.
[57:17] You know the prophet was teaching about
[57:21] advertisement.
[57:22] He said the first thing that any
[57:25] advertisement
[57:27] a person must see it.
[57:29] You know you must see the advertisement
[57:31] board
[57:34] and then the next thing he must want it.
[57:39] I wonder if what we've got on display as
[57:42] God's advertisement boards.
[57:46] I wonder if people want it. What we got
[57:49] now? I'll say this much.
[57:52] The scripture says they hate you. So the
[57:54] world, we're not looking for them to
[57:56] want it because they hate you. They hate
[57:59] me. They hate the word of God. They hate
[58:00] God. They hate everything that
[58:02] represents God and truth. But that's not
[58:05] what I'm interested in.
[58:07] I'm interested because the spirit of
[58:10] grace is in my heart. It's about the
[58:12] father's business to seek and to save
[58:15] that which is lost. To those that are
[58:17] redeemable, that's who we want to shine
[58:19] the light to. You know, we don't want to
[58:22] have our mindset and our affections
[58:24] thinking that everybody's going to be
[58:27] saved because they're not. Right? But we
[58:30] want to have a laser focus. We want to
[58:33] be so focused that you know what we're
[58:36] going to suffer persecutions from people
[58:39] they say you think you're a holy holier
[58:42] than thou you think you're somebody
[58:44] special hey you know what I I am I am by
[58:47] the grace of God you know the the enemy
[58:50] is constantly trying to pull you into an
[58:53] argument a tussle get you on your human
[58:58] I'm going to show him I'm gonna show her
[59:00] I can really do is I can't do anything
[59:03] except the grace of God empower me. I
[59:07] want to be that dependent on the grace
[59:09] of God. Like don't let this humanity
[59:12] start raising up and thinking it's
[59:13] somebody without the grace of God.
[59:18] Uh it I just here to remind us it's the
[59:22] grace of God to us.
[59:25] It's the love of Christ.
[59:28] But they're going to have to want it.
[59:34] If they don't see it and don't want it,
[59:37] that's different, right? But you know,
[59:41] the scripture also says that if our
[59:43] gospel be hid, it's hid to those that
[59:46] are lost,
[59:48] right? So you have a job.
[59:51] This is the hour to display the token.
[59:55] This is the hour. The way that we
[59:58] conduct our business, our jobs, our
[1:00:00] school, the way we act and react, the
[1:00:04] way that we talk to our neighbor, the
[1:00:06] way that when we get cut off in traffic,
[1:00:08] the way that that was the last thing on
[1:00:10] the shelf and you and the other person
[1:00:12] are grabbing it at the same time. You
[1:00:15] know, one of the things that I believe
[1:00:17] that is lacking is kindness in humanity.
[1:00:22] You know, kindness can go a a great deal
[1:00:26] to winning somebody.
[1:00:28] I remember I did a job for a man and he
[1:00:30] was completely blind. And he wasn't
[1:00:33] blind all his life. It just his
[1:00:35] occupation later in life caused him to
[1:00:37] be blind. And I was visiting with his
[1:00:39] his family. We were in his his his
[1:00:41] living room discussing uh construction
[1:00:44] details of a project we agreed to. and
[1:00:48] he the woman that he was with, I don't
[1:00:51] know if they're married or whatever, and
[1:00:53] I've told this story before and so I'm
[1:00:55] not going to try to go down too many of
[1:00:58] the roads, but I'll say this, she had
[1:01:02] very short hair and it was blue. And I
[1:01:05] just I was looking at him, he was he was
[1:01:07] blinded through military service, you
[1:01:09] know, he was into ammunitions or some
[1:01:12] kind of something and it his his vision
[1:01:14] was lost. But yeah, I got to testifying
[1:01:17] about how the power of God I was under
[1:01:20] this bondage and and this guy Mike Jo is
[1:01:23] his name. He was there and he would walk
[1:01:25] around where his back was really bad and
[1:01:27] and I was telling him the testimony of
[1:01:30] how God supernaturally healed my body.
[1:01:33] And she was sitting there and I could
[1:01:35] see her just kind of rolling her eyes
[1:01:36] and just like, "When is this going to
[1:01:38] end? When is this gonna end?" But as I
[1:01:42] testified and I didn't I wasn't entering
[1:01:46] in and entertaining her scoffing because
[1:01:49] I recognized that has nothing to do with
[1:01:52] me. My job is to shine the light to tell
[1:01:56] about the power of God in my life and
[1:01:58] the grace of God what it's done. And
[1:02:01] here after it was all said and done she
[1:02:04] was rattling on something and he started
[1:02:06] saying something and and I was like
[1:02:08] what? cuz he kind of can't hear out of
[1:02:10] one ear also. But I believe that's
[1:02:13] right. But so he he he said
[1:02:17] he said uh blindness recognize kindness,
[1:02:22] you know, and that that changed my
[1:02:24] world. You know, God can use somebody
[1:02:27] else if you'll sit there long enough.
[1:02:29] God spoke through a donkey to a backslid
[1:02:32] or to a to a a hierling prophet because
[1:02:36] he was going contrary. He had his eyes
[1:02:38] on something else. But what I'm saying
[1:02:40] is is God can use anything and anybody
[1:02:42] to speak to you to to give you a a world
[1:02:46] transforming view. That's what
[1:02:48] revelation does. And do you realize that
[1:02:50] we're in an age where there's the the
[1:02:53] gospel is blinding the eyes of the
[1:02:55] unbeliever. But God, even because he's
[1:02:58] rich in mercy, he's still he's still
[1:03:01] interested in people being well and
[1:03:04] experiencing benefits and blessings.
[1:03:07] Amen. Why would I ever want to cut that
[1:03:10] off from somebody by telling them
[1:03:12] something in a critic critical way,
[1:03:16] right? I want to let my conversation be
[1:03:19] seasoned with grace. You know, that's
[1:03:22] what we're called to. You know, we're
[1:03:24] going to give an account for every idle
[1:03:26] word. Oh, it should not create a a
[1:03:30] scare, but a reverence, a holy
[1:03:33] reverence. God, you're using my mouth
[1:03:36] every day.
[1:03:38] You the words that I say, they have
[1:03:41] power of life and death. That's what the
[1:03:45] resurrection has come to do is to give
[1:03:47] you boldness in speech.
[1:03:50] Give you courage to face the enemy, the
[1:03:53] adversary.
[1:03:55] The greatest enemy I got is me. the way
[1:03:57] I think my idea the way I think things
[1:04:00] should go what the temperature in the
[1:04:03] church should be where I should sit
[1:04:06] where I should park where I should go
[1:04:08] and shouldn't go but oh God may the
[1:04:12] grace of God lead me in the path of
[1:04:15] righteousness for his name's sake that's
[1:04:19] his promise to you that's his promise to
[1:04:21] me
[1:04:26] Ephesians Eeesians 4, he said, "Let no
[1:04:31] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:04:33] your mouth, but that which is good for
[1:04:36] the using use of edifying."
[1:04:39] That it may minister grace unto the
[1:04:42] hearer.
[1:04:44] Think of it. You have been empowered to
[1:04:47] give grace to the hearer.
[1:04:50] Oh, I I want to magnify my office. Like
[1:04:54] Paul said, I'm a son of God.
[1:04:58] The the God of glory has come to declare
[1:05:02] the glory of God in your life.
[1:05:07] My and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:05:09] God, whereby you are sealed into the day
[1:05:11] of redemption. Let all bitterness,
[1:05:14] wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking
[1:05:18] be put away from you with all malice.
[1:05:20] And be ye kind one to another,
[1:05:27] tenderhearted,
[1:05:30] forgiving one another,
[1:05:32] even as God for Christ's sake has
[1:05:35] forgiven you.
[1:05:37] My what a what a calling. What a
[1:05:41] commission. Go into all the world. Share
[1:05:44] this kindness. Share this grace. you
[1:05:47] know, when when they were nashing
[1:05:52] and stoning Stephen, you know, he he
[1:05:56] wasn't he wasn't a pastor or anything. M
[1:05:59] matter of fact, I don't know if he even
[1:06:01] did any signs and wonders. He was just
[1:06:03] God's billboard. And he was sitting
[1:06:06] there.
[1:06:07] He was telling them about their fathers
[1:06:10] and how they rejected the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:12] and they were just waiting to stone him.
[1:06:16] You know, there's people waiting to
[1:06:18] stone you. And within that crowd might
[1:06:21] be a Saul.
[1:06:24] They got their rocks ready and they got
[1:06:27] they got you on their crosshairs.
[1:06:30] And all of a sudden, because now
[1:06:34] the power of God is going to be
[1:06:36] displayed on a billboard.
[1:06:38] And he he he was being stoned and the
[1:06:41] glory of God shone on his face and he
[1:06:44] said, "Father,
[1:06:46] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:06:49] do." Wasn't that the Savior revived and
[1:06:53] alive?
[1:06:55] There's no question. When you live a
[1:06:57] life that's a billboard to God, you are
[1:07:01] declaring that the grace has came and
[1:07:03] saved you. Do you believe that? I
[1:07:07] believe it.
[1:07:09] Kindness is a deep feeling of generosity
[1:07:13] and consideration and compassion towards
[1:07:15] others and it's often without expecting
[1:07:20] it in return.
[1:07:22] My
[1:07:24] we always, you know, I think about this
[1:07:28] and we just come up against something
[1:07:30] recently, but we were in in work in
[1:07:33] Louisiana and you know, we we forget
[1:07:37] like, hey,
[1:07:39] you know, we're here to do a job and
[1:07:42] we're here to help. And when the
[1:07:44] difficult comes, when the struggle comes
[1:07:47] and all of a sudden, man, that's not our
[1:07:50] job. this and this and this that wasn't
[1:07:52] part of the plan. Like I didn't agree to
[1:07:54] this. It wasn't here. Like we had the
[1:07:57] expectation set and here comes the test.
[1:08:01] The wrench is in the plan. But you said
[1:08:05] you were going to help and they're
[1:08:06] taking account of your word and so is
[1:08:09] God. That's why he allows the trial to
[1:08:12] come. How are you going to react to an
[1:08:14] action? Amen. The de the devil's doing
[1:08:18] his thing, but God's allowing it because
[1:08:21] he's proving to you that the grace of
[1:08:24] God is awakening and coming alive. He's
[1:08:27] giving us opportunity, opportunity,
[1:08:30] opportunity. The scripture speaks about
[1:08:34] about umh
[1:08:40] I'm coming to it. I'm coming to it. I
[1:08:42] want to share that with you. I can bring
[1:08:45] it out.
[1:08:48] But it speaks about um with all men um
[1:08:55] yeah I'm coming to it.
[1:08:59] But it's speaking about even of the
[1:09:01] household of faith. You know, a lot of
[1:09:03] times, you know, we we're we're kind to
[1:09:07] one another sometimes, you know, but
[1:09:09] then when it comes to the outside, you
[1:09:12] know, ah, they're a bunch of heathens,
[1:09:13] bunch of unbelievers, you know, ah, I
[1:09:16] can be rude, it doesn't matter, right?
[1:09:19] They're like, right here, they're going
[1:09:21] to be cannon fodder. But no, that's not
[1:09:24] the expression of the divinity of God.
[1:09:29] While you're on earth,
[1:09:31] you are s you can suffer to be
[1:09:33] defrauded. It's the will of God that you
[1:09:35] take it patiently, right? So when they
[1:09:39] say all manner of evil against you,
[1:09:42] think it not strange,
[1:09:44] right? But my ju just just to think that
[1:09:47] there's growing pains of his grace. When
[1:09:50] we do wrong, when we find ourselves
[1:09:53] being sassifrass and and harsh with
[1:09:56] people and rude, it's the grace of God.
[1:09:59] There's growing pains of his grace. We
[1:10:01] can recognize conviction comes. Ah,
[1:10:05] Lord, you're calling me higher. You
[1:10:08] know, it's time to eat the cake.
[1:10:12] Ain't that right? You know, we've heard
[1:10:15] the wonderful realities of God, but now
[1:10:17] it's to time to receive the spirit of
[1:10:19] grace and get into action. I'm not
[1:10:22] afraid what man will do to me. If I make
[1:10:24] a mistake, I got the grace of God. I got
[1:10:26] the promise of God. You're faithful and
[1:10:28] just to forgive us and cleanse us of all
[1:10:31] unrighteousness.
[1:10:32] Amen. You can feel a little bit lighter
[1:10:35] knowing that there's a throne of grace.
[1:10:40] You you stop looking at yourself and you
[1:10:42] start looking at the throne of grace.
[1:10:45] Ah you know when I see myself in all my
[1:10:49] I got a long way to go but I know a
[1:10:52] resource. I know a source of life that's
[1:10:57] drawing me. It's drawing me. Amen. And
[1:11:01] when you tap into that grace then you
[1:11:04] enthrone it. And now it's the spirit of
[1:11:07] grace that's governing you. It's causing
[1:11:11] you to act and move and breathe and have
[1:11:15] your being. Don't you love that?
[1:11:19] The spirit of grace has come over us.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:29] My
[1:11:34] kindness is selfless,
[1:11:37] compassionate,
[1:11:40] merciful.
[1:11:43] You know, kindness will cause you to
[1:11:45] love your neighbor
[1:11:47] and show it to everyone.
[1:11:53] This is the scripture Galatians 5 and
[1:11:56] 13 says, "For brethren,
[1:12:01] ye have been called to liberty.
[1:12:04] Only use not your liberty for an
[1:12:06] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[1:12:11] one another.
[1:12:13] For all the law is fulfilled in one
[1:12:15] word, even in this, thou shalt love thy
[1:12:19] neighbor as thyself."
[1:12:22] And also in Galatians chapter 6 and 10
[1:12:25] it says,
[1:12:27] "As we therefore have opportunity, let
[1:12:30] us do good unto all men, especially to
[1:12:33] them that are of the household of
[1:12:35] faith."
[1:12:37] You know, and David said even he said in
[1:12:40] one place
[1:12:42] he said, "Thy loving kindness is better
[1:12:46] than life." And to think sometimes we
[1:12:49] hold on to this life as if it was better
[1:12:53] than his loving kindness. But I want to
[1:12:56] I want to enter into that revelation. I
[1:12:58] I want to receive that revelation that
[1:13:01] God's loving kindness is better than
[1:13:03] life. Amen.
[1:13:09] My, you know, we'll we'll uh just be a
[1:13:14] few more minutes, but you know, I I
[1:13:17] think that uh maybe if we can work on
[1:13:23] our our cry for revelation that God
[1:13:26] gives us the right approach, right?
[1:13:29] Because while we're here, we're we're
[1:13:32] here to do a job and to carry this grace
[1:13:35] to all the world. And and we're looking
[1:13:38] for those that are redeemable, right?
[1:13:41] And we can't it's not like you can just
[1:13:43] look on their hand or see, you know,
[1:13:45] it's just not like that. But if they
[1:13:47] don't receive you,
[1:13:51] they receive me is what he said. That's
[1:13:53] right. If if they receive your grace, if
[1:13:57] they receive your kindness, well, I
[1:13:59] believe that God's got a reward. Yes.
[1:14:02] Amen. But I just want to display that
[1:14:04] grace. Amen.
[1:14:10] My got way too much here.
[1:14:23] You know, this is out of enticing
[1:14:25] spirits. I was listening to this today
[1:14:27] and it says this in paragraph 108. He
[1:14:29] says, "I've said I don't condemn the
[1:14:33] drunkard for going out and getting
[1:14:35] drunk." He's all moody. He don't know.
[1:14:38] He gets up in the morning and he's got
[1:14:39] the blues, a hangover, goes out and gets
[1:14:42] him two or three bottles of beer and
[1:14:44] goes out and gets him some whiskey and
[1:14:46] all that kind of stuff. a little
[1:14:48] cigarette sucker back, sits back and
[1:14:50] smokes and blows through his nose like a
[1:14:53] freight train. That's all. I don't blame
[1:14:55] him. That's all the joy he knows.
[1:14:59] That's all he knows about. He's a pig by
[1:15:02] nature.
[1:15:08] Now, shame on you who profess to be
[1:15:11] Christians and rely on such things for
[1:15:13] joy when the Holy Ghost Gospel is
[1:15:17] nothing but a great big powerhouse of
[1:15:21] joy. The Holy Ghost Gospel is a perfect
[1:15:24] in intoxication for every man that's got
[1:15:27] the blues.
[1:15:29] You'll take a drink of the gospel of
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost and you are drunk until you leave
[1:15:36] this world. Amen.
[1:15:40] Joy unspeakable, full of glory. It's a
[1:15:43] constant stimulation.
[1:15:45] It's a constant intoxication.
[1:15:48] Drunk day and night.
[1:15:52] I love that.
[1:15:54] Now speaking of approach, he says, 'Now
[1:15:57] don't condemn the sinner. Have mercy on
[1:16:00] him.
[1:16:01] Let him go ahead and smoke his pipe and
[1:16:04] let him drink his liquor. Let him have
[1:16:06] his card party. That's his pleasure.
[1:16:08] Don't blame him. Come home and every
[1:16:11] night he's tired and wore out. He wants
[1:16:14] some pleasure.
[1:16:15] The thing you for you to do is live such
[1:16:19] a godly life that you can prove to him
[1:16:22] that the gospel hold 10,000 times more
[1:16:25] than that for him. That's the thing to
[1:16:29] do. That's the job to do is you got so
[1:16:32] much joy. You're full with such an
[1:16:34] intoxication. Hey, I want to tell you
[1:16:36] man, you know what? At the end of this
[1:16:38] life, there's a life eternal. Come on.
[1:16:42] You know there there's someone who paid
[1:16:44] a price and there's a door ministered in
[1:16:46] this day that you can go in behind the
[1:16:49] veil and you can partake in the mana
[1:16:51] from heaven. All of the scriptures typed
[1:16:54] it out but we're living in the day.
[1:16:57] What you're
[1:16:59] say come again. Say again.
[1:17:03] I I want some of this. Give me a drink
[1:17:06] of this. I I I've hungered for this all
[1:17:10] my life. Oh my. That's what we want to
[1:17:13] be about. We don't want to worry about,
[1:17:16] oh, you're a fanatic. Okay, you know
[1:17:18] what? It's time to move on. You take
[1:17:19] your shoes off, you dust. If they don't
[1:17:21] receive your grace, your peace, it's
[1:17:23] time to move on. Don't criticize. We got
[1:17:26] We got higher heights to go. We're
[1:17:28] climbing into the love of God. Ain't
[1:17:32] that wonderful?
[1:17:35] My
[1:17:37] as brother Bailey prepares to come.
[1:17:39] We're going to be about two minutes.
[1:17:41] Says this and we want to sing the lily
[1:17:43] of the valley. I just love that song so
[1:17:45] much. But he says this in the path of
[1:17:48] life. He says, "I believe that we have
[1:17:50] the thing that the world must have." But
[1:17:52] we've got to approach it in a way. What
[1:17:56] if I was a carpenter? I just take a man
[1:17:58] at the end here, brother Borders over
[1:18:00] there. He's a carpenter, I believe.
[1:18:02] Well, if I was driving like a hammer
[1:18:04] like this and driving nails and I'd hold
[1:18:07] an automatic nailer of some sort and I
[1:18:10] pour a tag of uh nails in it and hold it
[1:18:13] up like this and and and drive the
[1:18:16] boards like like a whole lot better than
[1:18:19] he could with his hammer. He says, "Now,
[1:18:22] if you're walking up to him and says,
[1:18:23] "Oh, boy. You ain't got nothing in it.
[1:18:26] You know nothing about it. Why? You're
[1:18:28] mashing your fingers and you you haven't
[1:18:31] got a product to begin with. You've
[1:18:34] offended him.
[1:18:37] See, you'll never sell the hammer.
[1:18:40] That's right. See, it's my approach
[1:18:44] what I have. It's my approach with what
[1:18:48] I have, my product. I know it's better
[1:18:52] than what they got. But I've got to
[1:18:55] remember, I've got to approach him in
[1:18:57] the right way.
[1:19:00] If you walk up to him and says, "How do
[1:19:02] you do, sir? My name is Brandon.
[1:19:06] Mine's borders." Say, "I see you're a
[1:19:08] carpenter." "Yes, sir, I am.
[1:19:12] I really believe that you're a real
[1:19:14] carpenter, too." Look at that kindness.
[1:19:19] See, I'll watch him. The way he's
[1:19:21] handling his hammer. Oh yes. Oh, Betsy,
[1:19:24] she's been here a long time. She's been
[1:19:27] with me a long time. Oh, I mean, see,
[1:19:30] this is part of the approach is you're
[1:19:32] entering into fellowship. You know, a
[1:19:34] lot of times our approach is, you know,
[1:19:36] you shouldn't be doing that. You
[1:19:38] shouldn't do that. But that's not the
[1:19:40] approach. The approach is believe on the
[1:19:42] Lord Jesus Christ. It's not condemning
[1:19:45] them for what they're doing. It's
[1:19:46] condemning them or it's it's lifting
[1:19:48] them up with the grace of God. believe
[1:19:50] on the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what
[1:19:53] brought me into grace. I believed in the
[1:19:56] Lord Jesus Christ. He saved me. If
[1:19:59] anything that nothing good that I did,
[1:20:02] it was his grace.
[1:20:05] Oh, Bessie's been with me a long time.
[1:20:07] Oh, yeah. That's a good one. Sure. Good,
[1:20:09] too. You really can handle it. Yeah. Go
[1:20:13] on and talk with him a while. And and if
[1:20:16] if uh did you ever hear they got a new
[1:20:19] such and such hammer? No, I don't
[1:20:21] believe I don't believe I did. He says,
[1:20:24] "Well, this here it is. You put the
[1:20:27] nails in it here and let's just let's
[1:20:30] just tack up those boards down here.
[1:20:32] Look at the look at the time it does.
[1:20:35] And what a product I got." Show it to
[1:20:38] him like that. Say, "Take it. Try it for
[1:20:42] a few days and see what you think." and
[1:20:44] I'll be back. And if the the right kind
[1:20:47] of product, it sells itself. You know
[1:20:50] what I mean? You know what I mean? See,
[1:20:52] we got the right thing. We got to
[1:20:55] approach the people with it, right? See,
[1:20:58] that's the thing. It's a real genuine
[1:21:01] thing is the Holy Spirit. And I believe
[1:21:04] it with all my heart. Amen. Just want to
[1:21:08] encourage you. You you have the spirit
[1:21:11] of the living God by the grace of God.

[1:33:14] Hallelujah. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[1:33:16] Let the word speak to your heart. And
[1:33:19] this the scripture says it's the soft
[1:33:22] answer that brings somebody. That's why
[1:33:23] the prophet will say, "I rather have the
[1:33:25] right spirit than the right doctrine."
[1:33:27] And so many things that you realize it's
[1:33:30] the spirit of God that brings that. It's
[1:33:32] when love is projected that's what saves
[1:33:35] somebody. It's not by the intellect and
[1:33:38] by the rules and by the law. It's the
[1:33:40] love of God that brings conviction. And
[1:33:43] I will bring one to understand that's
[1:33:46] our heart's desire. But agree if you
[1:33:48] could just come and dismiss us tonight.
[1:33:50] Amen.
[1:33:56] [Music]
