[14:21] comes to do the psalm reading we just
[14:23] want to continue to remember the
[14:25] building of the church in prayer and I'm
[14:29] just excited about the progress
[14:32] it's wonderful when you see a vision
[14:34] coming to fruition and we just
[14:36] appreciate all the brothers that have
[14:38] been pitching in and all those that have
[14:39] been in prayer why don't you just greet
[14:41] one another and welcome them to the
[14:43] house of the Lord
[14:44] and once you've done that you may have
[14:46] your seats as we
[14:48] have our Psalm reading
[15:02] good morning
[15:08] You Know It uh
[15:10] at some point in life you uh
[15:13] all of us find ourselves dealing with
[15:16] paperwork
[15:17] whether we love it or hate it
[15:20] it's kind of a fact of life whether
[15:22] you're buying a new house or you're
[15:24] signing up for a loan or you're doing a
[15:26] business contract or whatever the case
[15:27] may be
[15:30] but one of the things that you'll hear
[15:31] people say
[15:33] is to make sure you read the fine print
[15:37] pay attention to the fine print
[15:40] buried with on all that paperwork
[15:43] there's somewhere there's usually some
[15:46] important details some important
[15:48] sentences that are
[15:50] you know written in very small letters
[15:54] that if you miss them and if you don't
[15:55] read them you can be surprised or Miss
[15:58] a very important piece of information
[16:00] about that important document
[16:05] is you read the Psalms you'll notice
[16:07] under many of the chapters
[16:10] there's fine print
[16:12] those little statements in fine print
[16:15] and you know sometimes they'll be in
[16:17] providing instructions about what the
[16:19] psalm is to be used for what kind of
[16:21] music gets to be played with and
[16:24] sometimes it'll tell you the
[16:25] circumstances under which that Psalm was
[16:27] written
[16:30] and as we turn to Psalm 60 this morning
[16:34] you'll see there's a lot in the fine
[16:36] print at the beginning of the song
[16:40] it tells us that David wrote this Psalm
[16:42] while he was
[16:44] doing battle with the Enemy
[16:47] well when he speaks of joab returning
[16:50] from the valley of salt
[16:53] after defeating the
[16:56] you know you can read about these events
[16:58] in second Samuel chapter 8.
[17:03] describes a long string of Victories
[17:05] that David and the Israelites had
[17:07] against their enemies
[17:09] and it says in second Samuel 8 13 it
[17:11] says this and David got him a name
[17:14] when he returned from smiting the
[17:16] syrians in the valley of salt
[17:18] being 18 000 men
[17:22] it wasn't just a victory it was one that
[17:25] gave David a reputation
[17:28] a great Victory one for being a mighty
[17:31] conqueror for accomplishing great things
[17:35] you know if you read second Samuel 8
[17:37] it's all about One Victory after the
[17:39] next
[17:42] and it was
[17:43] during those events that David writes
[17:45] this song
[17:48] but what's strange is when you read this
[17:50] psalm
[17:51] it doesn't sound like somebody who's
[17:53] experiencing victory
[17:56] in fact it doesn't match up at all with
[17:59] the tone of someone that you would
[18:01] expect after experiencing many victories
[18:06] says in verse 1 it says o God thou has
[18:09] cast us off
[18:10] thou has scattered us thou has been
[18:13] displeased
[18:14] o turn thyself to us again
[18:17] you read that you go wait what
[18:21] somebody who's just been experiencing
[18:23] all these victories and this is the
[18:25] psalm that he's pending
[18:27] he goes on to say that was made the
[18:29] Earth to tremble
[18:31] that was broken it
[18:33] heal the breaches thereof
[18:35] for its shaketh
[18:37] this does not sound like someone who's
[18:39] experiencing victory
[18:41] thouest showed thy people hard things
[18:45] that was made us to drink the wine of
[18:47] astonishment
[18:50] you know that sounds like somebody who's
[18:52] in great trial
[18:54] like someone who is
[18:57] Fallen searching for Redemption and
[18:59] deliverance
[19:03] so what is this Psalm doing being
[19:06] written during a time of great victory
[19:11] you know like any important document the
[19:12] details are in the fine print
[19:16] the fine print describes a battle
[19:19] with Nations called arum nayarayam and
[19:22] aramroba
[19:24] these are basically syrians
[19:27] in fact if you read the account in
[19:30] second Samuel 8
[19:32] it refers to them as syrians
[19:37] and describes the start of the campaign
[19:39] in second Samuel 8 and verse 3 as David
[19:43] recovering his border at the river
[19:45] Euphrates
[19:48] he's doing battle with an enemy that
[19:50] continues to occupy the land that have
[19:52] been promised to them
[19:54] way up in the north of the country
[20:00] I had to write these down to keep myself
[20:02] honest
[20:04] but then he goes on to describe a battle
[20:06] at the valley of salt
[20:09] not with the seriums syrians but with
[20:12] Edom
[20:14] an entirely different enemy
[20:18] and the Valley of the salt is way down
[20:21] in the south of the country
[20:24] 200 miles away
[20:26] from where the river Euphrates battle
[20:28] was going on
[20:30] so while David is out there fighting
[20:33] these battles out in the North country
[20:34] and having all these great victories
[20:38] suddenly there's a pivot to a battle way
[20:40] down south
[20:42] 200 miles away
[20:44] with another enemy
[20:47] two battles
[20:48] on two different sides of the country
[20:53] you know he's out here fighting to
[20:55] restore the land way up in the north
[20:57] that have been promised to him and while
[20:58] he's distracted with the fighting busy
[21:01] fighting the enemy here comes another
[21:03] one 200 miles away
[21:05] on the other side of the Kingdom
[21:10] you know this is the situation where
[21:12] David begins to call on the Lord
[21:15] in psalm 60.
[21:18] he's just received word that another
[21:20] enemy has come up and he and his army
[21:22] are 200 miles away
[21:26] says oh God thou has cast us off
[21:29] thou Hast scattered us
[21:32] thou has been
[21:34] displeased
[21:36] while we've been off fighting the battle
[21:37] in one area
[21:40] the enemy has come in somewhere else
[21:42] to try to scatter us
[21:45] o turn thyself to us again
[21:50] suddenly in a time of Victory he's
[21:52] crying out to the Lord for deliverance
[21:55] and I wonder if that sounds familiar to
[21:59] anyone here
[22:00] where while you're doing battle with one
[22:04] thing
[22:05] something else comes along from Left
[22:07] Field
[22:09] I think the world has this phrase for
[22:11] that it's called when it rains it pours
[22:13] just one thing right after the other and
[22:16] the whole thing just try to scatter
[22:19] the people of God
[22:22] and as we read in Psalm 60 you know
[22:25] David is calling out to the Lord for
[22:27] deliverance and he says an interesting
[22:28] statement in verse 4.
[22:31] says this thou has given a banner
[22:35] to them that fear thee
[22:39] that it may be displayed because of the
[22:43] truth
[22:44] and I read that and I went amen
[22:48] that's speaking of a people to whom he
[22:50] has given a banner
[22:52] to be displayed to be lifted up
[22:56] as I was reading that the scripture came
[22:59] to my mind Isaiah 59 verse 19.
[23:02] says so shall they fear the name of the
[23:05] Lord from the West and his glory from
[23:07] the rising of the Sun
[23:09] when the enemy shall come in like a
[23:11] flood
[23:12] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[23:15] standard a banner against him
[23:20] just like David when the enemy comes in
[23:24] on both sides and starts to overwhelm
[23:28] the Lord has given a banner
[23:30] a standard that he wants to see lifted
[23:32] up
[23:35] you know if you keep a reading in Isaiah
[23:38] 59
[23:39] verse 20 21 it says then the Redeemer
[23:43] shall come to Zion and unto them that
[23:46] turn from transgression in Jacob saith
[23:49] the Lord
[23:50] as for me
[23:52] this is my Covenant with them saith the
[23:55] Lord
[23:57] my spirit that is upon thee
[24:00] and my words which I have put in thy
[24:03] mouth
[24:03] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[24:07] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[24:10] the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the
[24:13] Lord from henceforth and forever
[24:16] that's a promise I'm going to put my
[24:19] word in their mouth and it'll never
[24:20] leave their mouth
[24:23] you know as we finish reading
[24:25] in psalm 60.
[24:28] you know what is a standard what is a
[24:29] banner well it's his words
[24:33] on your lips
[24:37] the Lord has given his word to be put on
[24:40] display when the enemy comes in like a
[24:42] flood
[24:45] you know David begins to do that here in
[24:47] Psalm 60 as we'll read starting in verse
[24:50] 6 and going all the way to verse 9.
[24:54] he begins to recount every one of the
[24:56] Cities
[24:57] every one of the kingdoms every one of
[25:00] the enemies that the Lord had already
[25:02] given them
[25:04] that had already given the children of
[25:05] Israel to be defeated
[25:08] you go in there and you read city after
[25:10] city after City he can go back to Joshua
[25:13] and see what the Lord said and I'm
[25:15] giving you this city and I'm giving you
[25:16] this city and I'm giving you this city
[25:18] here David is now taking the word that
[25:20] the Lord had said and beginning to put
[25:22] it on his lips you said that this
[25:25] belonged to me you said that this
[25:27] belongs to me you said that this
[25:30] belonged to me
[25:31] he's now lifting up that banner and
[25:33] taking his words and putting it on his
[25:35] lips when the enemy comes in like a
[25:36] flood
[25:38] but you know as he begins to go through
[25:40] that now
[25:41] the last one he names is Edom
[25:45] the
[25:47] and it's interesting the story ends
[25:50] with a victory
[25:52] that should be impossible in the eyes of
[25:55] man
[25:56] so impossible in fact that to this day
[25:59] modern historians struggle to find all
[26:02] the right places on the map where this
[26:03] occurred
[26:04] because somehow an army that was 200
[26:08] miles away showed up on the scene with
[26:10] only eighteen thousand men and defeated
[26:12] an army of the in the valley of
[26:14] Saul
[26:15] somehow
[26:16] they could they commit they created an
[26:19] impossible victory
[26:22] you know an impossible distance was
[26:24] crossed
[26:25] in an impossible battle was won
[26:27] because somebody lifted up a standard
[26:30] of the words on their lips
[26:33] you know as a result it says in second
[26:36] Samuel 8 13 David got him a name
[26:41] when he returned from fighting the
[26:43] syrians 200 miles away
[26:46] in the valley of salt being 18 000 men
[26:50] this caught someone's attention it's got
[26:52] everyone's attention
[26:55] why because the enemy came in like a
[26:57] flood and he lifted up a standard
[26:58] against him an impossible battle was won
[27:02] so we go ahead and stand this morning
[27:05] you know there's a banner
[27:07] there's a word that he wants to see us
[27:10] lift up
[27:13] you know when the enemy will continue to
[27:15] come in from all directions but he wants
[27:18] to see what his people are going to do
[27:20] with the word that he promised them that
[27:22] he gave them there's a banner to be
[27:24] lifted up a standard to be lifted up in
[27:28] the when the enemy comes in like a flood
[27:32] it's important to read the fine print
[27:35] let's go ahead and read Psalm 60
[27:37] together
[27:39] oh God thou has cast us off thou has
[27:43] scattered us thou has been displeased o
[27:45] turn thyself to us again thouest made
[27:48] the Earth to tremble thou has broken it
[27:51] heal the branch speech thereof for it
[27:53] shaken thou as show thy people hard
[27:55] things thou has made us to drink the
[27:58] wine of astonishment thou is given a
[28:00] banner to them that feare thee that it
[28:02] may be displayed because of the truth
[28:04] Selah that thy beloved may be delivered
[28:07] save with thy right hand and hear me God
[28:10] hath spoken in his Holiness I Will
[28:13] Rejoice I will divide shechem and meet

[28:36] lead me into Edom will not thou God

[1:01:22] um anyway let's turn in our Bibles to
[1:01:24] Genesis
[1:01:27] this morning and
[1:01:32] this is the 22nd chapter of
[1:01:35] Genesis we all know the story well
[1:01:39] um
[1:01:41] uh it's
[1:01:43] one that we all take great hope in
[1:01:46] God unveiling his word in his mind and
[1:01:52] his nature to Abraham but let's just
[1:01:54] start in the 12th verse
[1:02:00] the 11th is the bets of Earth it says
[1:02:04] and the angel of the Lord called out
[1:02:07] this is Genesis the 22nd chapter the
[1:02:11] 11th verse
[1:02:14] and the angel of the Lord called out of
[1:02:17] heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[1:02:20] and he said here am I can we say that
[1:02:25] this morning here am I amen and he said
[1:02:29] lay not thy hands upon the lad neither
[1:02:32] do thou
[1:02:34] anything unto him for now I know that
[1:02:39] thou fearest God
[1:02:41] seeing thou hath not
[1:02:44] withheld thy son thine only son from me
[1:02:48] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:02:51] looked and be and behold behind him a
[1:02:56] ram caught in the thicket by his horns
[1:03:00] and Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:03:03] offered him
[1:03:05] up for a burnt offering instead of his
[1:03:09] son and Abraham called the name of the
[1:03:13] paste Jehovah Jireh as it is said to
[1:03:17] this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[1:03:22] shall be seen
[1:03:24] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:03:26] Abraham Out of Heaven a second time and
[1:03:30] said by myself I have sworn saith the
[1:03:35] Lord
[1:03:36] for because thou hath done this thing
[1:03:40] and hath not withheld thy son thine only
[1:03:44] son
[1:03:45] in that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:03:50] and in multiplying I will multiply
[1:03:55] thy seed
[1:03:57] as the stars of the heaven
[1:04:00] and as the Sands of upon the seashore
[1:04:03] and thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[1:04:07] his enemies
[1:04:09] amen father we love you we ask you to
[1:04:12] bless your word test in your precious
[1:04:14] name we pray amen God bless you
[1:04:22] aren't you
[1:04:24] uh
[1:04:26] glad that Paul came along and
[1:04:29] explain that not all Israel's Israel it
[1:04:33] wasn't just the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:04:35] it was the royal see Abraham and how
[1:04:40] many believe that you're part of that
[1:04:41] seed this morning amen you are the Seed
[1:04:45] of Abraham by faith because do you
[1:04:48] believe the promise that God sent in
[1:04:52] this day every day God's in every age
[1:04:56] God has given something for the believer
[1:05:00] to believe something that separates them
[1:05:04] out from what seemingly is going on we
[1:05:11] know that God called Abraham and Abraham
[1:05:14] was going to have a people and there was
[1:05:16] a people that was going to come from
[1:05:18] Abraham and God's always a separator
[1:05:21] that's what God does he longs to
[1:05:24] identify You by separating you from
[1:05:29] those that aren't his and
[1:05:32] I'm not the judge of that he's the judge
[1:05:36] of that but but yet he has that in his
[1:05:39] great heart and his great mind and we've
[1:05:43] been studying a little bit here it
[1:05:45] recently out of the book of
[1:05:47] Nehemiah and
[1:05:49] and last Sunday we talked about
[1:05:53] um
[1:05:53] we talked about the walls and today we
[1:05:57] talked about the necessity of having
[1:06:00] walls in our lives and today we want to
[1:06:03] Fellowship a little around uh Gates and
[1:06:08] uh just do a kind of more of
[1:06:11] Evangelistic but and part of what we're
[1:06:14] doing
[1:06:16] we we want to encourage you to read your
[1:06:21] Bibles
[1:06:22] and to let the Bible inspire you
[1:06:26] you know as you read the scripture we're
[1:06:28] taught that we need to put ourselves in
[1:06:31] every uh every verse in every line you
[1:06:35] know make it personal to you put your
[1:06:39] name in there and and as you read the
[1:06:43] scriptures and you uh uh you study the
[1:06:48] word of God okay you know draw from the
[1:06:52] things that you need of can you you know
[1:06:55] make uh make the types and the and and
[1:06:59] the stories and fit your situation fit
[1:07:04] what you're going through make the word
[1:07:07] come alive to you
[1:07:09] nothing's changed man still tempted the
[1:07:12] same Satan's still using his same old
[1:07:15] tricks we're still fighting the same old
[1:07:18] battle you know all Satan's done is
[1:07:21] changed his disguise
[1:07:23] that's all he's done yeah you know he
[1:07:25] keeps trying to he he keeps trying to
[1:07:28] work himself to where he's appearing as
[1:07:31] an angel of Light you know what I mean
[1:07:33] and his goal we know what his goal is
[1:07:36] nothing he wants to be worshiped
[1:07:39] he wants to be the worshiper of the
[1:07:42] creator of his Eden
[1:07:45] he wants man to look at his scientific
[1:07:48] creation he wants man to look at his
[1:07:51] educated creation his civilization and
[1:07:55] and and just say oh this is glorious now
[1:07:59] this is wonderful I I love this thank
[1:08:03] you but how come it there's a group of
[1:08:06] people that can't stand it
[1:08:09] Hallelujah
[1:08:11] amen I don't want what he's got I have a
[1:08:15] promise
[1:08:16] amen I'm looking for a city aren't you
[1:08:18] there's a there's a place that's greater
[1:08:21] than this place that's more a wonderful
[1:08:25] but just to
[1:08:27] uh get a feeling this morning to where
[1:08:30] that we're going and and talking about
[1:08:34] this world this Eden that we're in I
[1:08:38] wanted to play this morning to you just
[1:08:40] 15 little minutes
[1:08:42] out of the message called letting off
[1:08:44] the pressure
[1:08:46] and it just kind to express the
[1:08:50] atmosphere that we're living in and
[1:08:54] what's uh around us and when I read this
[1:08:57] it's hard to believe that our Messengers
[1:09:01] talking about 1962.
[1:09:04] but I I think when you're gifted a way
[1:09:08] that a prophets gifted you're really not
[1:09:11] subject to the date and the time you're
[1:09:14] in he he I if I could say it this way he
[1:09:17] was caught up in the age
[1:09:21] so you know uh and the spirit of the
[1:09:24] Lord knows the beginning from the end
[1:09:28] so he can address anything at any time
[1:09:32] and for any day because he knows the
[1:09:35] beginning from the end
[1:09:37] he's omnipotent so he knows the outcome
[1:09:40] he knows what would be so he could
[1:09:43] address things years and years before
[1:09:46] that they've ever come to pass he can
[1:09:49] describe it he can address it and and
[1:09:52] how many it could have listened I love
[1:09:55] to listen uh but to when our messenger
[1:09:59] would tell a story
[1:10:02] I always remember the one that meant so
[1:10:05] much to me as he talked about when the
[1:10:07] Lord had come from being tempted 40 days
[1:10:11] and 40 nights and and I've been there to
[1:10:15] Israel where they point up to this
[1:10:17] finger type mountain and they say this
[1:10:20] is that where he was tempted and and up
[1:10:23] there in the wilderness and
[1:10:26] and then you could see the journey and
[1:10:28] and uh the scripture says that brother
[1:10:31] Brahm is talking he says and I can see
[1:10:34] Jesus coming down and being tempted and
[1:10:36] he drops down through there and he picks
[1:10:39] up his friend uh uh Lazarus you know and
[1:10:44] I I just I just the way that he
[1:10:46] described it you just get the feeling
[1:10:48] that he's there
[1:10:50] and uh when I listened to this tape it's
[1:10:54] almost like I think well he he was here
[1:10:58] before we got here
[1:11:01] amen how many knows a prophet can do
[1:11:05] that he can go out and he can see and he
[1:11:09] can prophesy he can look out ahead and
[1:11:12] he can see what he is I take great hope
[1:11:15] in that because many times I can only
[1:11:18] see my distress in my trouble and my
[1:11:22] problem I can only see the battle that
[1:11:25] I'm in but there's one that already
[1:11:27] knows the beginning of the end and just
[1:11:30] like our story Abraham here God provided
[1:11:33] a sacrifice he's provided an answer you
[1:11:37] might think that you're in in a
[1:11:39] situation that you can see no resolve to
[1:11:43] no end to but God can create an end that
[1:11:48] that's what's beautiful he can provide a
[1:11:50] sacrifice he can provide an answer he
[1:11:53] can provide a solution that's the kind
[1:11:56] of God that we want to serve that's the
[1:11:59] kind of God that we want to talk about
[1:12:00] that's the kind of God that we want to
[1:12:03] think about don't look at the what's
[1:12:05] being presented that's not our reality
[1:12:08] our reality is the promise of God's word
[1:12:12] so as we pick up this little 15 minutes
[1:12:16] of this message the prophet of God's
[1:12:18] just got done telling the story how he
[1:12:21] went to the hospital to visit somebody
[1:12:24] and as he was looking for directions the
[1:12:27] nurse you know said something to him you
[1:12:31] could go read it yourself you know like
[1:12:32] oh how do I don't know where every room
[1:12:35] is around here and he talked to a doctor
[1:12:37] and he says yeah up this way and out
[1:12:39] that way
[1:12:40] and and he said I just seen what it was
[1:12:44] if people are just they're letting off
[1:12:47] the pressure well let's just listen to a
[1:12:50] couple minutes of this before we start
[1:12:52] this morning and and
[1:12:54] uh
[1:12:56] and just kind of
[1:12:59] listen to it and understand
[1:13:02] what is going on
[1:13:05] around us how many knows it's crazy out
[1:13:09] there
[1:13:10] I mean I I don't care who you talk to I
[1:13:13] talk to people that only believe in God
[1:13:15] and and they they say it's crazy and
[1:13:20] um and I said well you know I I said uh
[1:13:23] you know God promised there'd be some
[1:13:25] oddballs here
[1:13:27] all right you know there's a few nuts
[1:13:31] holding this whole place together
[1:13:33] praise God but let's just listen as
[1:13:36] brother Brown picks the thing up and
[1:13:39] and he's just listened to all these
[1:13:41] people talk and he's just gonna talk
[1:13:43] just a few minutes I think he'll just
[1:13:46] just kind of understand because he puts
[1:13:50] you in this situation also so let's just
[1:13:53] listen for a few moments and we'll have
[1:13:55] a little time of Fellowship Lord bless
[1:13:58] you
[1:14:04] it's just becoming a a neurotic age
[1:14:08] everybody's all built up haven't got no
[1:14:11] time and that builds up to a place
[1:14:14] that uh
[1:14:16] it breaks up things it causes people to
[1:14:19] have hard feelings when they snap them
[1:14:22] off and and say things you don't mean to
[1:14:25] say
[1:14:26] everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty
[1:14:29] you're all guilty we we do things under
[1:14:32] pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise
[1:14:35] so these uh these an excess pressure
[1:14:38] build up today
[1:14:40] I believe before I go any further I
[1:14:43] might say this I believe it's the enemy
[1:14:45] coming down and pressing
[1:14:50] I believe it's the devil
[1:14:52] and we know the coming of the Lord is at
[1:14:55] hand
[1:14:56] and the Bible said in the last days that
[1:14:59] the devil would go about like a roaring
[1:15:01] lion
[1:15:03] and if he could get you under pressure
[1:15:07] hurrying running over something
[1:15:10] you will make decisions that you
[1:15:12] wouldn't make if you've sat down and
[1:15:15] think it over
[1:15:18] there about three years ago I was on a
[1:15:21] hunting trip
[1:15:22] and I had an Indian guide and I I have
[1:15:24] to hunt real fast that stuff that's just
[1:15:26] me you see one of them pressure Builders
[1:15:28] so I I was hunting with the Indian and I
[1:15:32] jumped off the horse and there's some
[1:15:33] elk up on the mountain and I start
[1:15:35] around the bin the old Indians about 10
[1:15:37] years older than me she's as a puffin
[1:15:40] coming behind me I said come on Chief
[1:15:42] come on
[1:15:42] too fast
[1:15:44] too fast I don't know well I said come
[1:15:47] on and start you said too fast I slowed
[1:15:49] down next gear too fast
[1:15:52] I go down to a walk
[1:15:56] oh my I said Chief the elk is up there
[1:16:01] he said him stay there you were born
[1:16:05] there
[1:16:09] I said I guess that's right
[1:16:13] you stay there you were born there
[1:16:16] he said
[1:16:17] preacher hunt too fast
[1:16:21] secure all the game away
[1:16:23] to do like Indian
[1:16:25] walk them once look him nine times
[1:16:30] well I wonder what kind of a gear I'd
[1:16:32] have to get him to get on there or I was
[1:16:35] going to run up the mountain he said
[1:16:36] walk him once
[1:16:38] then look him nine times look all around
[1:16:41] over everything nine times before you
[1:16:43] make another step oh my but you see he's
[1:16:46] no hurry
[1:16:47] I've thought of that
[1:16:50] Ma
[1:16:51] precious old mother that's in glory
[1:16:54] tonight
[1:16:55] someone said why don't you wear a white
[1:16:59] flower today
[1:17:01] meeting your mother's day and I said my
[1:17:03] mother's Not Dead
[1:17:06] okay
[1:17:07] my mother's a living
[1:17:11] and then I'd wear a red one and then
[1:17:13] people say I thought your mother died
[1:17:16] so to keep from confused them and
[1:17:18] building up more sea mice left at all
[1:17:21] she's not dead she's asleep
[1:17:24] she's with Christ
[1:17:26] and then um
[1:17:29] the nervous neurotic age that we're
[1:17:32] living in and
[1:17:34] you don't want all of this the doctors
[1:17:37] don't have the answer
[1:17:39] because they're plagued with it too
[1:17:42] they don't have the answer they don't
[1:17:45] know what to do
[1:17:46] you say oh doctor I I I'm just about to
[1:17:50] blow my head I don't know what to do
[1:17:52] well he said I am too
[1:17:55] well there is nothing you can do he'll
[1:17:58] give you a tranquilizer when that wears
[1:18:00] off you're more nervous it was in the
[1:18:02] first place
[1:18:03] like a drunk man taking extra drink to
[1:18:06] get over his drunkness
[1:18:08] so you you can't do it there's no answer
[1:18:11] they don't have it but God has the
[1:18:14] answer
[1:18:16] right that's what we want to take talk
[1:18:17] about
[1:18:19] you have the answer God's got the answer
[1:18:23] he is the answer
[1:18:25] Christ is the answer to every problem we
[1:18:29] got
[1:18:29] now we're going to talk about him now
[1:18:33] in the Old Testament
[1:18:35] there was a time when a man could build
[1:18:38] up pressure way back there
[1:18:41] and that was when he done something
[1:18:43] wrong
[1:18:45] if he shed innocent blood
[1:18:48] well then he was on the Run
[1:18:51] because as soon as that man that he
[1:18:55] killed the wrong he did
[1:18:57] that man he did the wrong to some of his
[1:19:00] people would hunt him until he found him
[1:19:03] and there he kill him
[1:19:05] he's a tooth for a tooth and an eye for
[1:19:07] an eye
[1:19:09] and you see a man had no place to stop
[1:19:13] if he done something accidentally and of
[1:19:17] course the people wouldn't believe it
[1:19:18] but he had to take off
[1:19:20] because just as soon as as he did this
[1:19:24] then the the relatives of this man are
[1:19:28] woman whoever it was they started
[1:19:29] haunting him and when they found him it
[1:19:32] was tooth for tooth and eye for eye
[1:19:34] that's where they lived
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:38] so he couldn't stop nowhere
[1:19:40] he was a fugitive
[1:19:42] he didn't know what to do
[1:19:45] and he was on the Run
[1:19:47] a very hype of today I think that's
[1:19:50] what's causing so much pressure we're on
[1:19:52] the Run
[1:19:53] put some as the world
[1:19:56] knowing they're wrong knowing the coming
[1:19:58] of the Lord is at hand and the pressures
[1:20:00] building up and they're on the Run
[1:20:02] Roadhouse gaming Dan luxury sin immoral
[1:20:08] Decay anything to give them
[1:20:11] listen to television dirty jokes
[1:20:14] anything give this they're on the Run
[1:20:16] there's something fixed to happen they
[1:20:17] know it and they're drinking themselves
[1:20:19] to death
[1:20:20] with pleasures and everything else on
[1:20:23] the Run
[1:20:24] they know there's something fixing to
[1:20:26] happen
[1:20:28] the world speaks of it
[1:20:30] we know that something sticks to happen
[1:20:33] this world made me blowed up before
[1:20:36] daylight
[1:20:37] every Nations under kitchen
[1:20:40] why
[1:20:41] one time I was in Africa and I was
[1:20:44] watching
[1:20:45] a sheep feeding
[1:20:47] as a lamb or middle grown sheep and the
[1:20:52] little fellow was eaten very peaceful
[1:20:53] and all at once he got restless
[1:20:56] and you take a bite you look around you
[1:20:59] take a bite when he was peaceful I was
[1:21:01] watching him he look is this calm
[1:21:03] although it isn't that peaceful out
[1:21:05] there
[1:21:06] look at that little fella
[1:21:08] a Shepherd that had been washing had
[1:21:11] gone to the crowd
[1:21:13] back they eat colored and uh watch this
[1:21:17] little fella naturally got nervous I
[1:21:19] thought what's the matter with that
[1:21:20] little guy
[1:21:21] of course do binoculars and he got so
[1:21:25] nervous he looked this way in that way
[1:21:27] he started blatant he didn't know what
[1:21:28] to do I thought what made the little
[1:21:31] fella get so excited all at once
[1:21:34] now he was in a little pasture field
[1:21:37] but way over behind there I noticed
[1:21:40] something raised up and let out again
[1:21:43] about a half a mile from him
[1:21:47] he had good in the weeds
[1:21:49] a line slipping up
[1:21:52] and that little fella
[1:21:54] something in him
[1:21:57] was building to a place that he know
[1:21:59] there was danger somewhere
[1:22:01] he couldn't see it
[1:22:03] but the line has smelled the Sheep and
[1:22:06] he had to get quick now to get him
[1:22:08] before the shepherd got him got him out
[1:22:10] of the way so then
[1:22:12] watching him tension and built and in
[1:22:16] the distance this line was slipping up
[1:22:17] real easy
[1:22:19] yet the Sheep couldn't see the line but
[1:22:22] there's just something inside of him
[1:22:25] I told him that danger was at hand
[1:22:29] that's the way it is today that there's
[1:22:32] something inside of people that lets
[1:22:34] them know something is fixing to happen
[1:22:38] we know it
[1:22:40] the Christian knows it
[1:22:42] the world knows it the drunkard knows
[1:22:45] that the Gambler knows that the
[1:22:47] businessman the governments
[1:22:50] the U.N
[1:22:52] all of them know that something sticks
[1:22:54] to happen
[1:22:55] it's built attention
[1:22:57] women mothers just one cigarette after
[1:23:00] another
[1:23:03] I watch him come to the school they
[1:23:05] drive through Arlene there they'll have
[1:23:07] to watch my kids and my dog
[1:23:10] on a 20 mile Zone 70 miles an hour women
[1:23:13] taking their children to school
[1:23:15] cigarette in her hand hanging out one
[1:23:17] door fussing with her kids and down
[1:23:19] there and squeak the brakes in or the
[1:23:21] wheels are laying tires on the street
[1:23:23] and here they come back again I seen the
[1:23:26] wind blow four or five little kids fall
[1:23:27] off the road the other day of some
[1:23:29] neurotic mother
[1:23:30] where's she going
[1:23:33] what's the matter
[1:23:34] certain television program on maybe
[1:23:36] comes on she wanted to see
[1:23:38] but that's it tension
[1:23:41] there's something causing that they used
[1:23:43] to didn't do that
[1:23:45] something's approaching
[1:23:48] death and destruction is on its Road
[1:23:50] here
[1:23:51] it isn't very far away
[1:23:54] something is approaching
[1:23:56] now
[1:23:57] in the Old Testament
[1:23:59] God's seeing as some of this trouble was
[1:24:02] accidentally done
[1:24:04] so if you're innocent
[1:24:07] and not guilty God makes a way for you
[1:24:12] now if a man killed a man just
[1:24:15] deliberately premeditated
[1:24:17] he was lost
[1:24:19] he could not come to this place but if
[1:24:22] he did it accidentally he didn't mean to
[1:24:24] do it
[1:24:25] then there was a City of Refuge one was
[1:24:28] at Ramos Gilead and four places are they
[1:24:31] Joshua places Cities of Refuge now
[1:24:36] now the people could come to the City of
[1:24:39] Refuge if accidentally he'd done
[1:24:42] something wrong he didn't mean to he
[1:24:44] would come to the City of Refuge and go
[1:24:46] to the gate the gatekeeper would ask him
[1:24:49] why coming what was his idea of coming
[1:24:52] then his case was pleaded
[1:24:56] and when his case was pleaded at the
[1:24:58] gate and the man be found innocent and
[1:25:01] he did it not willfully then the man was
[1:25:03] taken into the city as a place of Refuge
[1:25:07] then the enemy could not get him
[1:25:09] and if he lied and done wrong and come
[1:25:13] into the City of Refuge though he was
[1:25:15] holding to the other Harms
[1:25:19] his enemy had the privilege and right to
[1:25:22] drag him from that order and kill him
[1:25:24] yes sir because he was guilty
[1:25:28] premeditated
[1:25:29] and he had to be punished
[1:25:32] now
[1:25:33] there was something went with that of
[1:25:36] course that man would be nervous
[1:25:38] mom maybe a dozen man behind you
[1:25:41] somewhere every Rock
[1:25:43] ever Hill ever bush
[1:25:45] the enemy somebody was standing ready
[1:25:48] for him he was nervous
[1:25:51] and then when he once got into the city
[1:25:53] he could let off the pressure
[1:25:56] he was safe
[1:25:58] he's all right because there's a
[1:26:00] provided Place made for him God's
[1:26:02] provided way for that innocent man not
[1:26:05] to be slaying but it could be accepted
[1:26:09] from this land because he did it
[1:26:12] accidentally now
[1:26:15] if you didn't mean to do it now if he
[1:26:18] meant to do it well he he had to stand
[1:26:21] the circumstances
[1:26:22] but um uh there's no chance for him as
[1:26:26] he did it willfully and there's two
[1:26:29] classes of people today may I say this
[1:26:32] there's man and women in the world today
[1:26:34] brother ruddle that really don't want to
[1:26:37] do these things they're doing
[1:26:40] there's men and women in the world today
[1:26:42] that don't want to sin
[1:26:44] I feel sorry for them
[1:26:47] they don't want to do anything wrong
[1:26:50] but they do it they're drove to it now
[1:26:54] there's a place for that person that
[1:26:56] wants to do right
[1:26:59] there's a place to let off that pressure
[1:27:02] it's true but there's some that doesn't
[1:27:05] care
[1:27:11] makes you want to go home and listen to
[1:27:14] that don't it
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:17] so we just want to just have a little
[1:27:20] bit of Fellowship this morning I I think
[1:27:23] that uh
[1:27:26] I could certainly relate
[1:27:28] I think it certainly describes I think
[1:27:31] it gives us an understanding there's
[1:27:33] something fixing to happen there's
[1:27:35] something pressuring he says I believe
[1:27:37] it's the devil
[1:27:39] pressuring us pressure so how many
[1:27:43] understands that there's great pressure
[1:27:45] out there that Satan's like a roaring
[1:27:48] lion going about seeking whom he may
[1:27:51] devour and
[1:27:54] and he said along with this pressure
[1:27:59] comes
[1:28:02] a
[1:28:04] hurriedness or a
[1:28:08] a a a a need to do something
[1:28:11] and he said it causes us many times to
[1:28:15] make decisions without thinking it out
[1:28:20] and so in using the book of Nehemiah
[1:28:24] this morning because we're studying a
[1:28:28] little bit about that uh part of the
[1:28:32] scripture and and uh so I kind of would
[1:28:37] would ask kind of a a question if I
[1:28:41] would uh about Gates if I kind of had a
[1:28:46] title for this this morning I would I
[1:28:50] would call it maybe who's keeping my
[1:28:52] gate
[1:28:54] and so just to uh talk a little bit
[1:28:57] about the gates and about nehemiah's
[1:29:00] wall brother Mike do we have the ability
[1:29:02] to put that up
[1:29:04] uh there on the wall I don't know if if
[1:29:08] can can you see that maybe not uh uh but
[1:29:13] there's 12 gates I believe on this wall
[1:29:16] this is one of the many images and it
[1:29:20] says in the first verse of the third
[1:29:22] chapter it's seven and Aaliyah's just a
[1:29:28] high priest rose up with his Brethren
[1:29:30] the priest and they built the Sheep gate
[1:29:33] and Sanctified it and set up the doors
[1:29:36] to it even to the Tower of Maya they
[1:29:40] Sanctified it unto the Tower of Hannah
[1:29:44] now and if you uh look over here up on
[1:29:50] on the top up here at right up here is
[1:29:55] the Sheep gate
[1:29:57] and the Tower of Maya that's the Tower
[1:30:00] of the hundreds and go back the other
[1:30:03] way right so this is the Sheep gate the
[1:30:06] Tower of the hunter that's the Tower of
[1:30:08] hannel
[1:30:09] I don't know if I'm saying it right but
[1:30:11] this is where they started building
[1:30:13] and then if you follow reading down
[1:30:16] through Nehemiah Nehemiah 3 3 Nehemiah 3
[1:30:21] 6 it starts listing the people and the
[1:30:24] tribes that got together and they
[1:30:26] started building that wall around the
[1:30:29] city and you can go through here because
[1:30:32] this is just one of the many uh uh
[1:30:35] things that were under images and so if
[1:30:39] you kind of look at this uh
[1:30:42] in a sense if I could say that
[1:30:46] it's kind of almost like how that were
[1:30:49] built if you could look at us like we're
[1:30:52] each a city
[1:30:54] you understand we're a city we're a life
[1:30:58] we're uh we're a city and they started
[1:31:01] building around that wall and again you
[1:31:04] can read it it was like almost two and a
[1:31:07] half miles of wall they built it in 52
[1:31:11] days
[1:31:13] uh it's a it's a tremendous story but
[1:31:17] you see first inside it was the temple
[1:31:21] and and that that was the place of
[1:31:24] worship that they built and then they
[1:31:26] went and built the the rest of the wall
[1:31:28] and they some like the fountain gate
[1:31:31] that this map they call it the Watergate
[1:31:34] there's a horse gate
[1:31:36] every single one of those had a purpose
[1:31:38] and and a meaning and and we won't go
[1:31:41] through all that this morning but
[1:31:44] I I want to talk a little bit this
[1:31:47] morning uh uh anyway so it's very
[1:31:51] interesting isn't it that all the gates
[1:31:54] and how can if you read down
[1:31:56] certain groups of men they'd get
[1:31:59] together and they would build the gate
[1:32:01] from this place to this place and from
[1:32:03] this place to this place and
[1:32:06] and we could discuss all those things
[1:32:08] but I want to talk we talked about walls
[1:32:13] and we talked why walls are so important
[1:32:17] is because they give us distinction
[1:32:21] they they give a line a distinction it
[1:32:25] it and that's what we're finding today
[1:32:28] in the world that there's no distinction
[1:32:30] that they want to erase any thing that
[1:32:35] gives any Clarity to anything
[1:32:38] you know separation isn't bad and being
[1:32:42] different isn't bad
[1:32:45] God made us different he made each one
[1:32:48] of us different he chose the the color
[1:32:51] that you are this morning God chose that
[1:32:54] that was by his making the nationality
[1:32:58] that you come from the background that
[1:33:01] you come from whatever you that all that
[1:33:04] was of God and he has a great purpose
[1:33:07] and he takes Delight in every single one
[1:33:11] of them there's no big eyes or there's
[1:33:14] no little use okay he he loves you the
[1:33:18] way you are as precious in His sight and
[1:33:22] every blessing is equally given to any
[1:33:26] man that chooses to have them
[1:33:28] our Prophet just said I thought that was
[1:33:31] a tremendous statement he said there's
[1:33:33] people that don't want to be the way
[1:33:36] they are they don't want to be what
[1:33:39] they're doing they want to be different
[1:33:41] he says there's a way for those people
[1:33:43] he said but there's other people they
[1:33:46] just don't care
[1:33:48] and this morning I don't want us to fall
[1:33:52] into the categories I don't care people
[1:33:55] are getting to where I don't care I I do
[1:33:58] whatever comes my way whatever pressure
[1:34:01] I get under whatever circumstances build
[1:34:05] up I'm going to let that circumstance
[1:34:08] drive me and push me and and whatever
[1:34:12] the result of it is I'm going to live
[1:34:15] with I don't want to live like that
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:21] I don't want everything around me
[1:34:24] determining what I am or what I'm going
[1:34:28] to be I don't walk I don't want to be
[1:34:30] influenced from the outside I thought of
[1:34:33] that City it had the temple in it I want
[1:34:36] to be influenced by the temple that's in
[1:34:39] my heart
[1:34:43] but we understand we just heard it
[1:34:45] ourselves there's a pressure
[1:34:48] from the outside driving us to make
[1:34:52] decisions
[1:34:55] and and if and those that pressure
[1:35:01] has got to come through a gate
[1:35:07] you understand what we're we're one to
[1:35:10] Fellowship around because Gates control
[1:35:13] the atmosphere
[1:35:17] even in this natural City they had Gates
[1:35:21] that the horses came through
[1:35:24] welcome because you don't want to walk
[1:35:26] behind a bunch of horses
[1:35:30] I mean I don't think I have to go into
[1:35:32] much explanation on that I hope I don't
[1:35:36] and if your kids ask you you answer it
[1:35:39] but and they they had certain gates for
[1:35:42] these certain things because that's the
[1:35:45] way they would control the atmosphere
[1:35:47] you understand control the condition
[1:35:50] control the crowd they could stand at
[1:35:53] the gate in our little story we heard he
[1:35:56] had to come to the GateKeeper
[1:36:00] and it had to plead his case
[1:36:04] to the gatekeeper and and that's our
[1:36:07] questions who's keeping my gate
[1:36:12] you know who's keeping what arrives at
[1:36:15] the gate and our gate and uh
[1:36:20] wants to enter in because you've got to
[1:36:23] remember the gate is the control
[1:36:27] it controlled the atmosphere it
[1:36:30] controlled who comes in and who goes out
[1:36:35] you know that man that went to that City
[1:36:37] he had to have Refuge as long as he
[1:36:40] stayed there
[1:36:42] you understand but he would have to make
[1:36:45] a decision
[1:36:47] to go out that gate
[1:36:51] I believe there's a story in the Bible
[1:36:53] where some sheep got away and the guy
[1:36:56] went out of the gate and the minute that
[1:36:59] he left that protection
[1:37:01] right there's judgment okay so we're
[1:37:05] we're talking about we establish walls
[1:37:07] but now we've got to establish Gates
[1:37:13] we got to understand there's Gates
[1:37:15] there's gateways and we know that that
[1:37:18] that uh because a game controls
[1:37:24] you have to understand it can it it's a
[1:37:27] control point we could give many
[1:37:30] electrical types in the electrical field
[1:37:33] Plumbing well they call it a gate valve
[1:37:40] it's a gate you know we have other uh
[1:37:46] type of things in in the electrical it's
[1:37:48] like a breaker is like a gate you can
[1:37:51] turn it on or shut it off so we got to
[1:37:56] understand that if the gate is
[1:37:57] controlling the atmosphere
[1:38:00] then we've got to make a decision of
[1:38:03] what kind of atmosphere do you want to
[1:38:07] live in
[1:38:10] I don't want to live in an atmosphere of
[1:38:13] fear
[1:38:14] I don't want to live in an atmosphere of
[1:38:16] constant pressure
[1:38:19] I want to live in an atmosphere of faith
[1:38:23] hope
[1:38:28] I don't want to be controlled
[1:38:31] by what's happening around me
[1:38:36] I want to have something that allows me
[1:38:40] to con have control and over
[1:38:46] and understand that that I I just can't
[1:38:50] let every gate
[1:38:52] everything come into my life at once in
[1:38:57] we know that there's there's gateways to
[1:39:00] the census don't we or the flesh
[1:39:04] understand those things there you know
[1:39:06] we see touch smell taste
[1:39:09] we got to control you you understand
[1:39:12] that you you the Gateway you just can't
[1:39:16] eat all that you want to eat and be
[1:39:18] everything that you want to be
[1:39:22] you can't Swatch everything you can't
[1:39:25] hear everything you can there's got to
[1:39:28] come a time where something takes
[1:39:30] control over that gate
[1:39:34] you got to take control over what you
[1:39:37] what are you going to hear and what are
[1:39:40] you gonna listen to and what effect is
[1:39:42] it going to have on you you've got to
[1:39:44] understand that that that even your
[1:39:46] hearing is a gate that you've got to
[1:39:50] control you've got to have something
[1:39:52] that's controlling that gate
[1:39:57] that goes for gossip
[1:40:02] you know what you hear
[1:40:04] you don't gotta that you don't got to
[1:40:08] let in
[1:40:09] everything you hear
[1:40:13] you can start saying wait a minute
[1:40:16] I'm possessing this gate
[1:40:20] this is a gate that the enemy is using
[1:40:23] to get to me
[1:40:26] I'm not going to let him come through
[1:40:28] this gate of of hearing and listening
[1:40:33] oh you know it it's you know gossip is
[1:40:37] an amazing thing
[1:40:40] you know that soap operas were
[1:40:44] real popular
[1:40:45] in our country I don't know if they
[1:40:47] still are I remember
[1:40:51] they used to have you know the World
[1:40:54] Turns and my children and
[1:40:58] Hospital day and yeah some of you look
[1:41:02] like you've seen some of that stuff I
[1:41:04] never could handle it
[1:41:06] but you know they're all built on Gossip
[1:41:10] and what they are they they feed that
[1:41:12] they feed that Curiosity what's next
[1:41:17] what's he gonna say
[1:41:19] oh I got to see it bro prophet of God
[1:41:21] said they had to drive home as fast as
[1:41:23] they could
[1:41:24] because they got to watch some TV
[1:41:26] program some soap opera
[1:41:31] you understand that gate got opened
[1:41:36] and once that guy got open something was
[1:41:40] able to enter into that gate
[1:41:43] and affect the atmosphere that that
[1:41:47] person was living in to where they made
[1:41:50] a decision to drive five kids off the
[1:41:53] road
[1:41:57] oh
[1:41:58] Gates
[1:42:00] hearing is one of them
[1:42:03] eating's another one
[1:42:07] you know you just
[1:42:09] boy that's a hard one to get a hold of
[1:42:15] I know it's one I've got to get a hold
[1:42:17] of
[1:42:19] you know you just get to where you just
[1:42:20] want to taste it you know what I mean
[1:42:23] look I used to have a whole great big
[1:42:26] bowl of chocolates on my back thing
[1:42:28] there's hardly any left in there I just
[1:42:30] figure Ben's been in there eating my
[1:42:32] chocolate
[1:42:36] I don't want to think man I ate all that
[1:42:38] chocolate
[1:42:41] man I've got a big gate
[1:42:45] the Gate of eight
[1:42:48] no I'm trying to draw a parallel in your
[1:42:53] thinking because I want you to
[1:42:55] understand there's Gates into your life
[1:42:59] there's Gates that are there and the
[1:43:03] enemy has got to enter through one of
[1:43:07] these Gates
[1:43:09] so you can build the walls
[1:43:15] but he'll try the gates
[1:43:17] he'll come through the gates you know so
[1:43:20] we know that there's Gates through the
[1:43:22] sentence hearing
[1:43:24] you know and and tasting and feeling and
[1:43:27] and all those things they're gateways
[1:43:31] and you know even in the natural if you
[1:43:35] can start controlling those natural
[1:43:37] gains
[1:43:39] you can control the atmosphere and the
[1:43:43] health of your body
[1:43:47] that's that's true
[1:43:50] you can do it
[1:43:53] and I'm not I'm not here to preach this
[1:43:55] morning if
[1:43:56] Health you know my name's not Jacqueline
[1:43:59] or or somebody like that uh
[1:44:03] uh or maybe for some of you modern
[1:44:06] people Richard Simmons is that would
[1:44:09] that be a a modern guy you know what I
[1:44:12] mean uh but I I think that we are the
[1:44:16] temple of God
[1:44:18] I mean there ought to be some respect
[1:44:21] you know what I mean and there ought to
[1:44:23] be some discipline and there ought to be
[1:44:25] some moderation
[1:44:27] man I'm preaching to myself on that I
[1:44:30] know but uh but those are still Gates
[1:44:33] that have to be controlled amen
[1:44:36] and there's gate there's gates to the
[1:44:40] uh to the mind
[1:44:44] conscience memory all these things are
[1:44:48] gateways that are there that we've we've
[1:44:53] got to
[1:44:54] no understand if we could sit here today
[1:44:58] typing ourselves or using ourselves as
[1:45:02] an example of Jerusalem and we're trying
[1:45:06] to build ourselves in through the statue
[1:45:09] of a perfect man we understand what it
[1:45:13] is that God what why is he building this
[1:45:16] city why is he building this body why is
[1:45:21] he fitting it and joined together even
[1:45:23] the building of this city it took every
[1:45:27] group doing their part in order for it
[1:45:31] to come together
[1:45:34] and each of us as individuals has a part
[1:45:37] to play in the building of this body
[1:45:45] but if if we don't control the gates we
[1:45:48] can go on later and we can find out
[1:45:51] there's all these plans that these
[1:45:53] people were making of how to come in and
[1:45:55] disrupt it and to destroy it and to tear
[1:45:58] it down
[1:46:02] but we can't
[1:46:04] we can't keep thinking everybody else is
[1:46:08] going to do the job
[1:46:13] there's a responsibility that we all
[1:46:15] have and you say well what did that
[1:46:18] responsive come from who delegated that
[1:46:22] responsibility he did
[1:46:25] by election
[1:46:28] when he elected you
[1:46:32] right he elected you to be a part of his
[1:46:36] body fitted and joined together
[1:46:39] every member supplying the need to the
[1:46:42] other
[1:46:45] so you don't want to become a gate
[1:46:50] that allows things into the body
[1:46:57] so we've got to have something
[1:47:00] that's watching our gate
[1:47:04] we've got to watch our gates
[1:47:10] we could go through all the different
[1:47:12] things of the
[1:47:16] of the
[1:47:18] all those different senses of emotions
[1:47:21] and all those things and and how their
[1:47:24] Avenues into you but we don't want to
[1:47:27] that's not our Point our point is still
[1:47:29] for us to come to a realization that
[1:47:32] you've got gates in your life
[1:47:35] and you have got to watch what's coming
[1:47:39] through them
[1:47:43] okay and you've got we've got to I've
[1:47:46] got to we all have to uh my vocabulary I
[1:47:50] wish there was a better word but but
[1:47:52] we've got to understand that there's a
[1:47:55] pressure
[1:47:57] that's pushing
[1:47:59] that once in
[1:48:02] he wants in he's pressing he that the
[1:48:05] pressure that's on he's pressing to get
[1:48:07] in he's pressing to make you conform
[1:48:09] he's pressing you not to stand out they
[1:48:13] don't want any voices that's contrary
[1:48:16] they'll want everybody to conform
[1:48:18] everybody to think the same way
[1:48:20] everybody not to stand up nobody to do
[1:48:24] nothing then they've got complete
[1:48:25] control
[1:48:30] let's see
[1:48:31] we've got a controller
[1:48:34] it's the Holy Spirit
[1:48:37] it's the word of God
[1:48:39] the spirit of God that came back
[1:48:42] and when there's a gate that's pushed
[1:48:44] open we have the right by the promise of
[1:48:47] God by the gift of his son to sit there
[1:48:51] and possess that gate
[1:48:56] we have a right to by the title deed
[1:49:00] to go back and claim everything and push
[1:49:04] it right back to our ownership
[1:49:10] but you notice
[1:49:14] that all those principles are falling
[1:49:16] apart in the world today
[1:49:21] they're waking up too late
[1:49:26] they passing a law in a state
[1:49:29] here recently
[1:49:31] that if somebody's squatting on your
[1:49:34] property
[1:49:36] or in your house
[1:49:39] and you remove them or get them off your
[1:49:42] property they have a right to sue you
[1:49:50] I don't know for what maybe you didn't
[1:49:52] fold their tent upright because maybe
[1:49:54] you maybe you uh hurt their pillow or or
[1:49:59] whatever
[1:50:03] they don't they want to possess the
[1:50:06] gates
[1:50:11] this
[1:50:13] roaring line
[1:50:16] even in your own personal life in your
[1:50:19] own City
[1:50:20] where the lamb is the light
[1:50:24] here he's working on so many Avenues
[1:50:28] so many directions so many different uh
[1:50:33] approaches to try to press in and press
[1:50:37] you to make a decision that normally you
[1:50:41] wouldn't make
[1:50:47] the pressure's out there
[1:50:50] people run off and join this or they run
[1:50:52] off and join that they the pressure gets
[1:50:55] so bad they don't know what to do they
[1:50:57] because if they think well maybe if I go
[1:51:00] here or go there
[1:51:04] it'll be better
[1:51:07] you know the devil's end everywhere
[1:51:13] had a good friend that owned a ranch
[1:51:17] I mean just
[1:51:19] I mean just beautiful place
[1:51:22] fabulous you take her all the time every
[1:51:24] place I better thought I'd just like to
[1:51:26] go back and live on that ranch again
[1:51:28] there's no problems on the ranch the
[1:51:31] ranch is beautiful there's nothing out
[1:51:33] there and yet tragedy can strike there
[1:51:38] just an incident of a second
[1:51:42] a gun accidentally went off
[1:51:46] person to be crippled
[1:51:50] heart attack strike out there just like
[1:51:52] the strike anywhere
[1:51:55] he's everywhere the enemy is everywhere
[1:52:00] the prophet God said the whole pressure
[1:52:02] today I believe it's the devil
[1:52:06] pressing in at and you've got to
[1:52:09] understand he's trying to press into our
[1:52:12] lives he and he's trying to find what
[1:52:16] gate
[1:52:19] can he come in
[1:52:22] it's like a thief
[1:52:24] in the night
[1:52:26] he'll try this door he'll try this
[1:52:29] window he'll go around he'll keep trying
[1:52:31] every little place that he can get in
[1:52:34] he'll chase a place out
[1:52:38] and watch
[1:52:40] when do you leave when do you don't
[1:52:42] leave what do you do what do you do that
[1:52:45] there's all kinds of things they have
[1:52:46] because they they they're they're always
[1:52:49] looking for that gate of Entry
[1:52:55] so if you're not keeping the gate
[1:53:00] who's watching your gate
[1:53:05] I I wouldn't be opposed to a spiritual
[1:53:07] ring bell in our lives
[1:53:10] where the Holy Spirit notified us every
[1:53:13] time something was there
[1:53:17] I couldn't believe it the other day
[1:53:19] because I saw a clip of I guess they
[1:53:23] call them package thieves
[1:53:26] people just walk right up and take your
[1:53:29] package off of the
[1:53:31] and I thought well what what did their
[1:53:34] the it was a of this ring thing and I
[1:53:38] thought well what did that do for him
[1:53:39] they got a video of their package
[1:53:41] getting stolen
[1:53:45] they didn't get their package back
[1:53:47] because you can steal a package if it's
[1:53:50] under eight hundred dollars
[1:53:54] the gate has been knocked down
[1:53:59] it's destroyed
[1:54:01] the gates of our country have been
[1:54:04] destroyed
[1:54:07] now you've got to build your gates in
[1:54:11] your life you have got to have your
[1:54:14] walls built you have got to take control
[1:54:16] of your Gates you can't let everybody in
[1:54:24] it's just a must because if you don't
[1:54:27] keep clap mind battle we'll get to the
[1:54:30] place did you you heard it right this
[1:54:31] morning he said I just feel like blowing
[1:54:34] my head
[1:54:38] and the doctor said so do I
[1:54:41] and you go what am I here for so we both
[1:54:44] can go together
[1:54:48] they're losing it
[1:54:53] but if you pretend that you don't have
[1:54:56] Gates
[1:54:58] and you pretend that there's no devil
[1:55:01] and you pretend there's no pressure and
[1:55:04] you pretend there's no enemy and you
[1:55:07] just get to the place you just take
[1:55:08] things the way the they are and you're
[1:55:12] letting everything control you
[1:55:22] and that's that's the way people live
[1:55:26] whatever happens
[1:55:28] we'll deal with it later
[1:55:31] we'll deal with it later
[1:55:37] it's just I'm not going to deal with it
[1:55:40] now
[1:55:41] I'll deal with it later I'll worry about
[1:55:44] the gate later I'll worry about what
[1:55:46] this is uh later or what what they're
[1:55:49] trying to say or what they're trying to
[1:55:52] do I'll just worry about it later I
[1:55:54] won't deal with it now I've got too much
[1:55:57] going on it's just too heavy uh you know
[1:56:01] and oh just you know just forget it
[1:56:11] there's an amazing thing going on
[1:56:14] in this country
[1:56:16] right now
[1:56:19] is
[1:56:21] we open the gate
[1:56:24] to our young people
[1:56:27] through something called social media
[1:56:31] and the internet
[1:56:34] we got our kids phones
[1:56:37] because everybody had a phone
[1:56:41] we pretended that we needed them to
[1:56:44] watch our kids and to know where our
[1:56:46] kids at and
[1:56:47] to communicate in everything but they're
[1:56:51] smart enough to change that up and send
[1:56:54] an app and they can set it up to where
[1:56:56] you think that they're at somebody's
[1:56:59] house and they're someplace else
[1:57:04] they opened this door
[1:57:08] this gate
[1:57:10] and now
[1:57:13] they didn't deal with it back then
[1:57:16] oh they never sat down and prayed about
[1:57:18] it
[1:57:19] they never sought it through
[1:57:22] they never wondered what it would do
[1:57:25] how would it affect this and how it
[1:57:28] would affect that
[1:57:30] and yet all this propaganda
[1:57:34] all this ideas all these thinkings all
[1:57:39] this way
[1:57:40] of
[1:57:42] attitudes and all this great thing that
[1:57:45] they've been they kept coming through
[1:57:47] these Gates and coming through these
[1:57:49] Gates and coming through these Gates
[1:57:52] until now just recently they said that 1
[1:57:58] in four teenage girls
[1:58:01] between the ages of 12 and 18 have
[1:58:05] contemplated suicide
[1:58:07] seriously
[1:58:13] the very thought of it
[1:58:18] people then used to think like that
[1:58:22] because there was hope
[1:58:27] but there's so much negativity about our
[1:58:30] errors not going to be breathable and
[1:58:32] our water's not going to be drinkable
[1:58:34] and oh some people are trying to get to
[1:58:37] the moon I like I like what the prophet
[1:58:39] said I want to go past the moon so fast
[1:58:41] that you can't even see it
[1:58:47] it's such a pressure
[1:58:50] on them
[1:58:53] so much things that they see and so many
[1:58:56] things that they're watching they start
[1:58:58] comparing themselves
[1:59:01] you cannot compare yourself to something
[1:59:05] that's not real
[1:59:13] you can't
[1:59:15] it's affecting them
[1:59:19] 30 of high school students
[1:59:24] I'm trying to tell you the gate's been
[1:59:27] opened
[1:59:31] and the enemy came in like a flood
[1:59:38] 30 percent one in three students in high
[1:59:43] school
[1:59:45] is trying to identify themselves
[1:59:48] as either gay or lesbian
[1:59:55] one in three
[1:59:59] they don't do that naturally no
[2:00:03] that thought has been sowed into them
[2:00:09] they don't want no distinction they
[2:00:12] don't want no distinction between men
[2:00:13] and women
[2:00:15] they want everybody to be a robot
[2:00:17] everybody to be equal everybody to be a
[2:00:20] clone no personal identity no sexual
[2:00:24] identity it could no personality
[2:00:30] they've opened the gate
[2:00:33] suicides
[2:00:36] are up almost 200 percent
[2:00:41] amongst teenagers
[2:00:47] why would a young person
[2:00:51] want to take their life
[2:00:55] the prophet said I feel sorry for
[2:01:00] because they opened the gate
[2:01:02] they open the gate to artificial
[2:01:05] intelligence
[2:01:09] and guess what they're trying to do now
[2:01:12] they're trying to close the gate
[2:01:18] we don't want any internet anymore for
[2:01:21] any children under 12.
[2:01:26] can you imagine
[2:01:28] they get them all addicted
[2:01:33] because everybody's being lazy
[2:01:39] they're they're all addicted to it they
[2:01:42] all got it they communicate with one
[2:01:44] another they can be whoever they want to
[2:01:46] be
[2:01:47] you can imagine who you're talking to
[2:01:50] you can imagine what they think about
[2:01:52] whatever it is
[2:01:54] and now they're saying oh we've got to
[2:01:56] stop this
[2:02:00] we got to make laws
[2:02:03] that keeps us from coming into our
[2:02:06] children
[2:02:08] it's affecting them it's affecting them
[2:02:10] in school it's affecting their lives
[2:02:12] it's affecting their decision making
[2:02:15] they're making decisions that they
[2:02:17] normally wouldn't make
[2:02:20] yeah
[2:02:22] now they're trying to stop the madness
[2:02:26] because they opened the gate
[2:02:30] they've opened the gate
[2:02:39] and they're realizing they've got a
[2:02:41] monster
[2:02:43] in the house
[2:02:45] they've got a monster in the city
[2:02:51] I know we've had people that's worked
[2:02:54] and and in in the social uh with the
[2:02:59] child protection agencies and things
[2:03:02] like that they understand the amount of
[2:03:04] drug addiction the amount of alcohol
[2:03:06] addiction amount of the things that are
[2:03:09] in their life why is that because they
[2:03:12] open the gate and all this time he's
[2:03:16] been standing at the gate knocking
[2:03:19] wanting to come in but they wouldn't
[2:03:22] open the gate they allowed everything
[2:03:25] else to come through that gate but the
[2:03:27] word of God and now we're in a fix
[2:03:34] and I don't want to be Doomsday
[2:03:37] because there's no Doom for the believer
[2:03:41] because he's got to kick it out of here
[2:03:43] Hallelujah you know what I mean he's got
[2:03:46] the he's got he's got his token in his
[2:03:49] hand he has a token applied the price
[2:03:52] has been paid I'm leaving I'm on the
[2:03:55] next train out of here praise God you
[2:03:58] know what I mean it's it's it's settled
[2:04:01] for me
[2:04:06] they're doing everything
[2:04:09] they can
[2:04:12] and they don't know what to do
[2:04:15] because they're not taking the answer
[2:04:19] Christ is the answer for every problem
[2:04:23] they're trying to find a social way to
[2:04:26] fix a social problem
[2:04:30] a kingdom cannot be divided against
[2:04:33] itself they're trying to use the devil
[2:04:36] to fix the devil
[2:04:43] it's like a crooked car mechanic
[2:04:47] you bring your car in to fix something
[2:04:49] he fixes it and breaks something else
[2:04:54] and he shakes your hand he says next
[2:04:56] time you have a problem come see me
[2:05:02] you know about a week later something
[2:05:03] else is wrong oh that's no let me look
[2:05:07] at that oh he knows exactly what it is
[2:05:09] he has it fixed in 10 minutes
[2:05:13] and a special deal
[2:05:15] just for you
[2:05:18] that's what Satan's always saying just
[2:05:21] for you
[2:05:22] you can handle it it doesn't apply to
[2:05:25] you that's everybody else
[2:05:30] is not
[2:05:34] he's at our gate
[2:05:39] and we've got to take control
[2:05:43] of the gates
[2:05:45] we've got to possess the gates
[2:05:49] we can't allow things just to go on uh
[2:05:59] and accept things as they've come
[2:06:06] and think it out and say what do I want
[2:06:09] to be
[2:06:11] what kind of Christian do I want to be
[2:06:14] what kind of believer
[2:06:17] do I want to be
[2:06:19] what kind of relationship
[2:06:22] do I want to have with the Lord
[2:06:27] you know a lot of couples grow apart and
[2:06:30] a lot of things get into into bad spots
[2:06:33] because Gates got opened
[2:06:36] and things came in
[2:06:39] and the things that came in were never
[2:06:41] for you in the first place
[2:06:43] they weren't there to help you they were
[2:06:46] there to destroy you
[2:06:50] and he said if a man watched his health
[2:06:52] and the good Watchman of his house if he
[2:06:54] knew the thief was going to come that he
[2:06:56] would be there
[2:07:00] but Satan now comes as an angel of Light
[2:07:05] and he he wants he wants to put us under
[2:07:08] so much pressure
[2:07:10] that we don't have time to pray about
[2:07:13] decisions
[2:07:14] we don't have time to even consider if I
[2:07:17] Open this gate
[2:07:20] that's what they did they built those
[2:07:22] Gates because they want they wanted to
[2:07:26] know what came into that City
[2:07:30] they wanted to know where it was going
[2:07:32] what it was there for what it was doing
[2:07:36] and what the effect of it would be
[2:07:43] because if not Jerusalem had been
[2:07:45] destroyed
[2:07:48] it's like a trojan horse
[2:07:51] you remember the story of the Trojan
[2:07:53] Horse right they built this great big
[2:07:55] horse and they filled it full of
[2:07:56] soldiers
[2:07:58] and they rolled it up to the city and
[2:08:00] they thought oh this is like a god
[2:08:02] offering
[2:08:04] so they rolled it on in
[2:08:09] and at night the soldiers got out and
[2:08:11] slayed everybody
[2:08:14] because Satan appears as an angel of
[2:08:16] Light
[2:08:18] and he comes up to your gate
[2:08:21] and he always goes to the weakest gate
[2:08:28] and we let things in
[2:08:33] and it might come in like a little
[2:08:35] leaven
[2:08:37] but eventually it starts leavening in
[2:08:40] the whole lump
[2:08:42] you start you start living with it
[2:08:45] and now it's you've got to do
[2:08:48] you gotta arrange your lifestyle
[2:08:51] around it
[2:08:57] because because it just got in there
[2:09:01] but it keeps wanting to take up more
[2:09:03] space and more space and more space
[2:09:07] your job can consume your whole life if
[2:09:10] you let it it can take up every space
[2:09:13] you've got every hour you've got if you
[2:09:16] can if you don't get there and
[2:09:18] eventually say I have got to close this
[2:09:21] gate
[2:09:22] I have got to close it I cannot let this
[2:09:26] gate remain because it keeps getting
[2:09:28] bigger and wider and more people coming
[2:09:32] through it and now it's becoming Avenue
[2:09:35] it started out as a straw now it's a
[2:09:38] pipeline
[2:09:39] and not only that he's bringing
[2:09:41] everything with it all kinds of other
[2:09:44] thoughts all kinds of other attitudes
[2:09:46] all kinds of other feelings and pretty
[2:09:49] soon you don't even know what's going on
[2:09:55] because we don't deal with it
[2:09:59] at the door
[2:10:04] we've got to have control over our gates
[2:10:10] you say well how am I going to get
[2:10:11] control over this gate Christ is the
[2:10:14] answer the word is the answer you've got
[2:10:16] to go possess that gate
[2:10:19] you've got to go right there and you've
[2:10:21] got to just possess that gate you know
[2:10:23] Goliath
[2:10:26] he wanted to use that gate of being a
[2:10:29] great warrior
[2:10:30] great big guy you know what I mean
[2:10:34] that's what he wanted to use to possess
[2:10:37] Israel
[2:10:38] he wanted to use the Gate of his
[2:10:40] strength the Gate of his might the Gate
[2:10:43] of his experience
[2:10:46] that was going to be his entrance
[2:10:49] to take over Israel
[2:10:53] think of it
[2:10:56] and he baits them
[2:11:00] come on who will come out and and fight
[2:11:03] me
[2:11:04] let's save lives
[2:11:10] that's not what Henry Van Winkle did he
[2:11:13] said Give me liberty or give me death he
[2:11:15] pulled all the Spears in them
[2:11:18] oh they said oh let's let's let's save
[2:11:21] lives you send your best I'll send our
[2:11:23] best
[2:11:27] Israel forgot their best was God's man
[2:11:34] that was the gate
[2:11:36] that Satan was trying to use
[2:11:41] to overtake Israel and here comes Little
[2:11:44] David
[2:11:45] up there
[2:11:47] he says who's this uncircumcised
[2:11:49] philistine
[2:11:52] he said I'm not buying this gate
[2:11:55] I'm not buying this boast
[2:11:58] who is he
[2:12:00] to defile the armies of the Living God
[2:12:04] when are we going to stand up and say
[2:12:06] who is this that's defiling the Bride of
[2:12:09] Jesus Christ
[2:12:11] and not let it into my life I'm not
[2:12:14] letting it on to my computer I'm not
[2:12:16] letting it on my radio I'm not going to
[2:12:19] talk about it I'm not going to associate
[2:12:21] with it who is this devil
[2:12:24] they're trying to come through this gate
[2:12:27] to get to the people I love
[2:12:30] amen
[2:12:32] Josh not you
[2:12:34] it's affecting
[2:12:37] it affects all of us
[2:12:43] pray for me
[2:12:46] I need it
[2:12:49] who is this guy
[2:12:52] what did he use he used Grace
[2:12:56] he is the Word of Promise
[2:13:00] and he went out there and he possessed
[2:13:03] that gate
[2:13:05] that gate looked big
[2:13:09] that gate looked powerful
[2:13:13] all the armies of this rules afraid of
[2:13:16] that gate but one little man with the
[2:13:19] word of God closed that gate
[2:13:24] Goliath I'm here to close the gate
[2:13:30] oh he's always got an answer boy if you
[2:13:32] close this gate
[2:13:34] I'm going to put you on that tree and
[2:13:37] the birds are going to eat your eyes out
[2:13:41] well I'm going to cut your head off
[2:13:47] don't you believe you can cut that head
[2:13:49] off
[2:13:50] don't you believe you can kick them back
[2:13:52] out that gate
[2:13:57] all of them
[2:13:59] you're not going to leave none of it
[2:14:01] behind

[2:14:09] here I've got a title deed to my life

[2:14:35] win
[2:14:41] thank you
[2:14:43] you can't come in this gate
[2:14:45] no more
[2:14:48] who's watching the gates
[2:14:52] Lord Jesus give me your spirit
[2:14:57] give me I save
[2:15:00] that I may see
[2:15:03] give me ice have then I can find the
[2:15:05] gates that he's coming through give me I
[2:15:08] said I can find where he's getting in
[2:15:10] you ever had mice
[2:15:13] I hope you've never
[2:15:15] I haven't been that fortunate
[2:15:19] but you start looking for the holes
[2:15:25] where is he coming in at
[2:15:27] where's he coming in at how's he getting
[2:15:29] in here
[2:15:33] you get this great big old rat I ain't
[2:15:35] got one this baby you get a great big
[2:15:37] old rat as big as this thing here they
[2:15:39] get that big
[2:15:40] I get as big as a cat
[2:15:45] and you find out he's coming through a
[2:15:47] little hole like that
[2:15:49] you say you're gonna be kidding me how
[2:15:52] do you get into that thing
[2:15:55] he presses his way through
[2:16:02] oh nobody wants to think about the devil
[2:16:06] you know who's got to think about the
[2:16:08] devil more than ever as you young ladies
[2:16:13] all the garbage they're trying to feed
[2:16:16] you
[2:16:21] you know almost you because they'll lie
[2:16:23] to you and think you've got to be
[2:16:24] anorexic to be pretty
[2:16:29] don't marry a guy
[2:16:32] just because he thinks you're pretty
[2:16:38] and a guy ought to know better than to
[2:16:40] marry a girl because she's quote unquote
[2:16:43] what the world calls pretty
[2:16:46] Beauty to a Christian's character
[2:16:49] you see that Godly character you see
[2:16:51] that sister that they'll tell you that's
[2:16:54] what that's what a Son of God wants
[2:16:55] somebody that can be a good children you
[2:16:58] don't want all this nonsense out there
[2:17:00] all this trash that they're feeding
[2:17:03] everybody
[2:17:06] all right well what's happened
[2:17:09] we've opened that gate
[2:17:13] now the world might not be able to close
[2:17:16] their gate but the bride's going to
[2:17:18] close their gate they're going to close
[2:17:21] his Gates by opening
[2:17:24] our gate
[2:17:26] to the one who's standing there
[2:17:29] and knocking
[2:17:38] you gotta be able to look over your city
[2:17:43] Nehemiah got up and he drove out in
[2:17:47] secret
[2:17:49] if I could say it this way because I'm
[2:17:52] talking about when I'm reading the Bible
[2:17:56] and part of this whole thing that we're
[2:17:59] going through is to encourage you to
[2:18:01] read your Bible
[2:18:02] to see things in the scripture to use
[2:18:06] the stories
[2:18:07] and place them in your life
[2:18:10] to me Nehemiah getting up in the dark of
[2:18:12] the night and getting on his thing he
[2:18:15] was in his prayer closet
[2:18:18] amen he was in his secret place
[2:18:21] he was there looking at it and surveying
[2:18:25] the outcome
[2:18:26] he was looking what it was going to take
[2:18:30] and every time you ought to see us they
[2:18:33] have some beautiful pictures of what the
[2:18:35] old Rubble looked like and every time he
[2:18:39] saw it he'd go
[2:18:40] but I believe there was something in him
[2:18:42] that said my God is more than able my
[2:18:45] God is more than able My Father Abraham
[2:18:48] had a promise that he possessed the
[2:18:51] gates of his enemies
[2:18:53] like Moses amen
[2:18:55] amen Moses comes down to the Red Sea
[2:19:00] and here's the Egyptians behind them
[2:19:04] right the Red Sea was a gate
[2:19:08] it was a closed gate
[2:19:13] if if something didn't happen to that
[2:19:16] gate
[2:19:19] then everybody started saying oh no the
[2:19:21] Red Seas in front of us and the rivers
[2:19:24] behind us
[2:19:26] we're doomed let's just go back
[2:19:34] let's just go back let's don't press
[2:19:36] forward you understand Satan is trying
[2:19:39] to make it look like it's impossible for
[2:19:42] you to press forward and to become a
[2:19:45] real Christian
[2:19:47] it's impossible for you to pray for the
[2:19:49] sick it's impossible for you to lead
[2:19:52] somebody to Christ it's impossible for
[2:19:54] you to to to comfort somebody and to be
[2:19:58] a real Christian
[2:20:02] they're even crying out against
[2:20:03] Christianity they're blaming
[2:20:05] Christianity
[2:20:07] for the social conditions of the world
[2:20:12] you talk about a tricky devil
[2:20:15] it's all Jesus's fault
[2:20:21] if he would just give this whole Kingdom
[2:20:24] to me
[2:20:29] then we could get this thing in order
[2:20:31] where everybody be happy
[2:20:34] yeah they'll get you in a room and stick
[2:20:36] Artificial Intelligence on your head and
[2:20:39] you can be there like a vegetable
[2:20:43] oh they've got it
[2:20:45] what do they call those things that they
[2:20:47] put on their head
[2:20:49] and you'll see somebody there going
[2:20:56] they don't even know where they are
[2:20:59] they're in a hard official world
[2:21:06] artificial world gets artificial results
[2:21:14] when they turn the button off
[2:21:16] all their peace is gone all their Joy is
[2:21:19] gone all their comfort is gone all their
[2:21:22] patience is gone all their goodness is
[2:21:25] gone
[2:21:27] other brotherly kindness is gone
[2:21:31] they don't have nothing
[2:21:36] I don't want to be like that
[2:21:39] I don't want to be like that
[2:21:43] I want to be a Christian
[2:21:45] I want the love of God shed abroad in My
[2:21:49] Heart by the Holy Spirit I want the Holy
[2:21:53] Spirit to become my gate watcher
[2:21:59] I need the Holy Spirit to watch my Gates
[2:22:03] I need him to give me notification
[2:22:10] what the Holy Spirit does
[2:22:14] it convicts us a sin
[2:22:17] it leads us and guides us into all truth
[2:22:20] and righteousness that's what the holy
[2:22:22] spirit is it's a gate Watcher what good
[2:22:25] does it do you if you shout and dance
[2:22:27] and I believe in that's wonderful but if
[2:22:29] you don't got somebody watching the gate
[2:22:35] some gates we just need to lock
[2:22:38] possess
[2:22:41] blocked up
[2:22:42] and finish I'm done with you
[2:22:49] you're not coming through this thing
[2:22:51] anymore
[2:22:55] and then you can maybe move on to the
[2:22:57] next gate but some of us got so many
[2:23:00] gates open we don't know where to start
[2:23:02] I tell you where to start start on your
[2:23:05] knees in your closet saying Lord my
[2:23:08] life's a wreck
[2:23:10] amen
[2:23:14] I need you to come help close these
[2:23:17] Gates
[2:23:18] I need you to open up other Gates
[2:23:23] because you've got to have a gate for
[2:23:24] him to come into
[2:23:28] Gates have coming in too
[2:23:31] you got to have a way
[2:23:33] that his Spirit comes in and deals with
[2:23:36] you
[2:23:37] you got to have a gate
[2:23:39] to your spirit
[2:23:41] in your heart
[2:23:46] believe me
[2:23:48] if you crack it that much
[2:23:52] he'll find a way in
[2:23:54] light will come in the smallest
[2:23:59] pinhole
[2:24:02] and it'll illuminate more space than you
[2:24:05] can ever imagine
[2:24:09] you've got to have ways to open gates to
[2:24:11] your spirit
[2:24:14] you've got to sit down and read your
[2:24:15] Bible
[2:24:17] and open that gate
[2:24:22] addictions
[2:24:23] are terrible things
[2:24:26] they become they it's a gate that gets
[2:24:29] you the way you think the way you act
[2:24:32] the way you look at things it's a it's a
[2:24:35] driving Factor
[2:24:38] and the only way to break those is to be
[2:24:40] able to look at it In a Different Light
[2:24:44] and Jesus said I am the light of the
[2:24:47] world
[2:24:48] I am the way I am the truth I am the
[2:24:52] life
[2:24:53] no man could come unto the father but by
[2:24:56] me he says I am the door to the
[2:24:58] Sheepfold I'm the gate
[2:25:04] and you're going to have places that you
[2:25:06] open up
[2:25:08] things that you do in your life
[2:25:11] whether it's a good work lay for
[2:25:14] yourself a pattern of good work go help
[2:25:16] somebody go Comfort somebody
[2:25:19] pray about giving somebody an offering
[2:25:22] there's got to be gates in your life
[2:25:26] where he can come in and live through
[2:25:28] you and work through you and do things
[2:25:30] through you
[2:25:35] a lot of us had no open gates to him
[2:25:39] we've got no works
[2:25:41] we're not testifying
[2:25:44] my our noses are in textbooks
[2:25:49] when you're all done what do you know
[2:25:51] you know what you get when you're all
[2:25:52] done you get to walk across the stage
[2:25:55] you get a piece of paper in your hand
[2:25:57] and you get some guy that says hey thank
[2:26:00] you for your sixty thousand dollars
[2:26:03] and then you got to go out and find a
[2:26:05] job
[2:26:13] you'd be educated if the guy don't like
[2:26:15] you tough
[2:26:18] I'll just testify about David Davey
[2:26:21] barely got out of high school
[2:26:24] don't mean that bad Davey you're not
[2:26:26] here to defend yourself
[2:26:28] but I know you're a lot like me
[2:26:31] at least he got farther than I did
[2:26:35] he showed up to a job fair
[2:26:40] no qualifications no educations no
[2:26:44] certifications whatsoever
[2:26:48] nothing
[2:26:50] nothing
[2:26:51] he he couldn't go there and
[2:26:54] put his Hope on his certification
[2:26:57] well I've got uh
[2:27:00] CP3
[2:27:03] you know
[2:27:06] somebody caught that
[2:27:09] you know
[2:27:11] or or or something like that no he just
[2:27:14] went in there and talked to the guy he
[2:27:17] said what are you doing here I thought
[2:27:18] I'd come look around she was the job
[2:27:20] the guy liked them
[2:27:24] Davey's very personable
[2:27:27] you know he's got a real gift to
[2:27:29] minister to people and uh I remember
[2:27:32] Doug Hughes when David and Matthew and
[2:27:34] Aaron they all got converted WQ is a
[2:27:37] great friend of mine
[2:27:39] he meant you know his story his eyes and
[2:27:41] everything he said he said them boys are
[2:27:43] out at school passing out books he said
[2:27:45] I wouldn't doubt if all three of them
[2:27:46] are preachers
[2:27:48] anyway David Goes Up talks to the guy
[2:27:50] says Ah but you know David just
[2:27:54] everything's cool
[2:27:56] you know no problem
[2:27:59] and the guy likes him you know and then
[2:28:01] no pressure
[2:28:03] he says this place is interesting you
[2:28:05] know
[2:28:06] a lot of Geeks here
[2:28:08] and the guy says well he said so you
[2:28:10] want a job he said yeah
[2:28:16] yeah pretty good I'll take a job he said
[2:28:18] if you can pass the training
[2:28:21] I'll give you a job
[2:28:24] he passes the training he gets a job
[2:28:27] he starts out selling computer parts he
[2:28:29] moves over to another company and moves
[2:28:31] to another company and now I don't I
[2:28:34] don't know I don't know if I can explain
[2:28:36] what he does he's an account manager
[2:28:38] writing contracts or or something like
[2:28:41] that
[2:28:44] God Will Make A Way
[2:28:47] God will open the gate
[2:28:50] God provided
[2:28:53] a sacrifice God is Jehovah Jireh
[2:28:59] we got to open the gates for him
[2:29:02] and we've got to close the gates
[2:29:05] it's gate closing time it's gate opening
[2:29:08] time if you are going to have a city
[2:29:12] a personality A Life That's thriving
[2:29:17] you've got to have control of your Gates
[2:29:21] you've got to have control of your Gates
[2:29:24] you can't let people making that
[2:29:27] determine Nation for you
[2:29:30] and I don't care what consequences
[2:29:34] the enemy
[2:29:36] lies to you about
[2:29:39] Jesus Christ said I will not leave you I
[2:29:42] will not forsake you I'll lead you and
[2:29:45] guide you into all truth and
[2:29:47] righteousness and the righteous shall
[2:29:50] not beg bread
[2:29:54] end a story
[2:29:57] Satan can't walk through that gate but
[2:30:01] you can
[2:30:03] there's Gates that are open for you
[2:30:06] to walk through
[2:30:08] this Bible
[2:30:10] is a list of thousands of promised Gates
[2:30:15] that you can walk through
[2:30:17] you can walk through the gate of healing
[2:30:19] you can walk through the gate of
[2:30:21] Deliverance you can walk through the
[2:30:22] gate a council you can walk through the
[2:30:25] gate of restoration
[2:30:30] but let me tell you there's a rule in
[2:30:33] hunting
[2:30:34] and there's a rule in Land Management
[2:30:37] when you go through a gate you close it
[2:30:44] and we need to close some gates
[2:30:47] and open some others
[2:30:51] and I think in this great story of
[2:30:53] Nehemiah
[2:30:55] a man went out and he looked and he saw
[2:30:57] a immense task
[2:31:01] he said but we can build these walls
[2:31:04] and he said we can build these Gates
[2:31:07] and we can take control
[2:31:10] of Jerusalem
[2:31:12] what comes in and what goes out
[2:31:15] because they had a temple
[2:31:18] they wanted to protect him
[2:31:21] and a place of worship
[2:31:23] that they wanted to worship God
[2:31:27] and in ladyocia
[2:31:30] their spots and wrinkles
[2:31:33] in the feast
[2:31:35] and they contaminate
[2:31:38] the offering to God
[2:31:41] and if we can start shutting off the
[2:31:43] contamination
[2:31:45] if you young men you young people take
[2:31:48] control of your life cut the garbage out
[2:31:51] old people get rid of the old habits get
[2:31:54] rid of the old gossips get rid of those
[2:31:56] things close out all the negative
[2:31:58] thoughts and all the stuff forget what
[2:32:01] happened yesterday let's press for a
[2:32:03] higher calling let's shut the gates and
[2:32:06] open the gates for the spirit of God and
[2:32:09] for Revelation to come into our lives
[2:32:11] and Enlighten us
[2:32:14] and be a lamp under our feet so we know
[2:32:17] what direction we're going to what kind
[2:32:20] of atmosphere we want to control because
[2:32:22] remember the gates is what controls the
[2:32:24] atmosphere and in the right atmosphere
[2:32:27] Anything Can Happen the right mental
[2:32:30] attitude to any promise of God will
[2:32:33] bring it to pass
[2:32:39] I don't wouldn't say that we're lacking
[2:32:41] anything
[2:32:42] I'm just trying to say the holy spirit
[2:32:44] is trying to lead us into a greater
[2:32:47] Victorious life than we've ever had
[2:32:50] one where we can Minister the love of
[2:32:53] God can be shed abroad in our hearts by
[2:32:56] the Holy Spirit and we can affect the
[2:32:59] lost and dying people isn't that what
[2:33:02] your heart's desire is God bless you

[2:34:27] it's affecting my peace it's affecting
[2:34:30] my patience
[2:34:32] it's like the prophet said I just get to
[2:34:34] the place I just pop off and I do things
[2:34:37] and I say things that I normally
[2:34:39] wouldn't say
[2:34:43] Lord I've had the problem a long long
[2:34:45] time
[2:34:48] but I read a scripture that says a
[2:34:50] thousand years is but a day with you
[2:34:56] and father when I was a sinner you
[2:34:58] already died for me
[2:35:03] Lord I know you're true but I've never
[2:35:06] invited you into my life to help me
[2:35:08] close this gate
[2:35:12] Lord now I want to close it this morning
[2:35:18] maybe you'd lift your hand this morning

[2:35:24] my emotions are a wreck I'm
[2:35:29] I am in an impossible place
[2:35:35] and I heard a messenger
[2:35:40] say that all things are possible
[2:35:45] and he took it from the scripture and he
[2:35:48] proved
[2:35:50] that that was true
[2:35:55] Lord I need Restoration in my life
[2:36:01] I need your spirit in my life Lord I'm
[2:36:04] lifting my hand tonight just to let you
[2:36:06] know Lord I I want you to see that I'm
