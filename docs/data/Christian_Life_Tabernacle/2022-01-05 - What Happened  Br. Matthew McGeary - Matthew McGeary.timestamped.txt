[30:27] christ's name
[30:28] amen hallelujah
[30:31] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[30:32] let's just turn in our bibles to
[30:36] second peter chapter one
[30:41] i trust everybody's having a
[30:43] a good new year
[30:46] you know you get a little bit older and
[30:48] you find the only thing that changes is
[30:50] a number
[30:53] you know the bills keep coming and
[30:56] and you got to keep going to work and
[30:59] and
[31:01] but one thing we know as believers we're
[31:04] one step closer
[31:06] we're one day closer to the catching
[31:08] away to the translation of our body so
[31:11] we're certainly
[31:13] that's what we're living for amen
[31:16] spreading out a second peter
[31:18] chapter one
[31:20] we'll read verse
[31:21] 10
[31:22] through 19 it says wherefore the rather
[31:25] brethren
[31:26] give diligence to make your calling and
[31:29] election sure
[31:31] for if ye do these things ye shall never
[31:34] fall
[31:35] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[31:38] unto you abundantly
[31:39] and to the everlasting kingdom of our
[31:41] lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i
[31:44] will not be negligent to put you always
[31:47] in remembrance of these things
[31:49] though ye know them
[31:51] and be established in the present truth
[31:54] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[31:57] this tabernacle to stir you up by
[31:59] putting you in remembrance and that's uh
[32:03] maybe where i'm going to be drawing some
[32:05] inspiration
[32:06] for a text this evening and as we
[32:08] continue reading it says knowing that
[32:10] shortly i must put off
[32:14] this tab my tabernacle even as our lord
[32:16] jesus christ has showed me moreover i
[32:19] will endeavor that ye may be able to
[32:21] after my deceased to have these things
[32:23] always in remembrance
[32:25] for we have not followed cunning devised
[32:27] fables when we known unto you the power
[32:30] and the coming of our lord jesus christ
[32:32] but we
[32:34] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[32:37] for he received from god the father
[32:40] honor and glory when there came such a
[32:43] voice to him from the excellence glory
[32:45] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[32:47] pleased
[32:48] and this voice which came from heaven we
[32:51] heard and we
[32:52] we were with him in the holy mount we
[32:55] have also a more sure word of prophecy
[32:58] where unto ye do well that you take heed
[33:01] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[33:03] place until the day dawn and the daystar
[33:05] arise in your hearts amen we just asked
[33:08] a blessing upon the word you may be
[33:10] seated
[33:13] i mean just starting into
[33:16] just something that was maybe a little
[33:18] bit on my heart as we
[33:20] had the new year uh
[33:22] coming in and we we just read this
[33:24] scripture here where in verse 13 it says
[33:26] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[33:28] this tabernacle to stir you up by
[33:31] putting you into remembrance and it
[33:33] might seem like an odd text to
[33:36] uh title the sermon this way but we'll
[33:38] just see how the lord would lead but i
[33:40] want to maybe speak on a thought what
[33:42] happened
[33:44] maybe as a question what happened
[33:46] because here paul he's saying i want to
[33:48] put you into remembrance so something
[33:50] has taken place uh something has been
[33:52] said and so paul is saying look i know
[33:55] that you know these things
[33:57] i know that you're established in the
[33:58] truth but he said as long as i'm in this
[34:00] tabernacle i see that it's me that i'm
[34:02] going to remind you of these things i'm
[34:04] going to stir you up i'm going to put
[34:06] you into remembrance and so maybe as we
[34:09] just move along this evening that's
[34:11] something that's on our heart we just
[34:12] want to put you in the remembrance of
[34:14] what god has done we want to put you in
[34:16] a remembrance of what he said we want to
[34:18] put you in remembrance of what has taken
[34:20] place in your life and i say as long as
[34:22] i'm in this tabernacle i want to do my
[34:24] job to remind you of what god has done
[34:26] to remind you what he's done in your
[34:27] life and to remind you what he said
[34:29] because if the prophet paul could stand
[34:31] there say look i think it's needful that
[34:33] i do this as long as i'm in this
[34:35] tabernacle i'm going to remind you even
[34:37] though you're established in them even
[34:39] that you're established in the truth and
[34:40] you know these things i think it's me
[34:42] that i remind you and many times you
[34:44] might feel that a minister might stand
[34:46] behind the pulpit and he says the same
[34:48] thing over and over and over well in one
[34:50] way maybe he could only preach what's
[34:52] been revealed to him but if it's the
[34:53] word of god then i can say as long as
[34:56] we're reminding you of the word and what
[34:58] god has done and what he's said then you
[35:00] can take faith in that word and let it
[35:02] have an effect in your life amen
[35:05] so just in this this thought of what
[35:07] happened you know uh you go into the new
[35:10] year and and and you might see that uh
[35:13] the news channels and things will say
[35:15] well what what happened in the year 2021
[35:19] and maybe uh certain political agendas
[35:21] they'll say well well this happened and
[35:23] this this government did this and and
[35:25] this this democrat said that and they
[35:27] they go they go back and maybe they give
[35:29] like a highlight of of what took place
[35:32] in the year 2021
[35:34] and then maybe from from that standpoint
[35:37] you know they they might see an area
[35:38] where they could have done better or
[35:40] they wonder why they well what happened
[35:42] why did that happen and and then they
[35:43] say well how are we going to change
[35:45] those things
[35:46] you know what are we going to do in this
[35:48] coming new year and 2022 year that that
[35:51] that we don't get the same results that
[35:52] we can actually make some decisions and
[35:55] and put things in order that that this
[35:57] doesn't happen again
[35:59] because many times that's the question
[36:01] you know that's on the heart or or in a
[36:03] personal life or in business or in the
[36:05] government when something happens
[36:07] everybody wants to know what happened
[36:10] you know how did we get to this place
[36:12] what what was the demise how did we get
[36:14] here
[36:16] you know and i was just as i thought
[36:17] upon this thought i remember uh uh years
[36:20] back when i wasn't serving god i'm
[36:23] you know i i guess i can just y'all know
[36:25] i've god called me from a life of sin
[36:27] and
[36:28] and i i had ended up being uh and you
[36:31] know as having to spend the the weekend
[36:34] uh behind some of those uh steel made
[36:36] bars they they put in some places and i
[36:39] remember i'd got out and i was just
[36:40] wandering i i just you know i you just
[36:43] having to go forward and figure out to
[36:45] get to a phone or make a phone call and
[36:47] and as i was walking down the street i
[36:48] saw another gentleman there he's kind of
[36:50] maybe in the same boat just kind of
[36:52] drifting along down the road and and and
[36:54] i kind of just walked up there by him
[36:57] and said hello to him and we got to
[36:58] talking and you know he come to find out
[37:01] the man was homeless and and then you
[37:03] you know you're like what's your story
[37:04] what happened to you
[37:06] and then you you start to find out that
[37:08] that some of these things you know many
[37:10] times we might see somebody's condition
[37:12] or you see where they're at and and
[37:14] you're completely void of understanding
[37:16] we're so quick to cast judgment and so
[37:18] quick to assume and and here this man
[37:21] was homeless and he he said well you
[37:22] know i had i had a good job and i had a
[37:24] good home and
[37:26] and you know i had a good car i was i
[37:27] was paying my bills uh but i got a
[37:30] traffic ticket and i and something led
[37:33] to another to where they actually repo'd
[37:34] my car and i i couldn't go to my i
[37:37] couldn't go i lost my job and i couldn't
[37:39] get my car back and i lost my home and
[37:41] and just it was like a whirlwind before
[37:43] you know it i was out on the streets
[37:45] and so you find out when you talk to
[37:47] this this man in his condition maybe you
[37:50] would look at him and you would assume
[37:52] well well here's a guy homeless he
[37:54] doesn't want to get out and work he
[37:55] maybe he's never had anything but you
[37:57] you find out that sometimes when you
[37:59] find out what happened it gives a
[38:00] completely different perspective
[38:03] i'm reminded of when the prophet of god
[38:04] would tell the story of how there was
[38:06] this drunk on the side of the road and
[38:09] he had went over to help him there and
[38:11] and he was trying to stand up the man
[38:12] and he kept on uh falling over and he he
[38:15] finally got him to a place where he
[38:16] could be stabilized and he said you know
[38:18] look i was i was the president up there
[38:20] of that bank
[38:22] and the prophet would go okay well you
[38:24] know what what happened what what
[38:26] happened you say well you know i had a
[38:27] good job i had a wife and i had a family
[38:30] and and everything was going good but
[38:32] but i i got home one evening and and
[38:35] there was a as he called it a dear john
[38:37] letter and his wife had decided to leave
[38:40] him and and you know instead of him in
[38:42] that calamity and then that hardship the
[38:44] only thing he could think to do was to
[38:46] go down to the bar and go down to the
[38:48] saloon and start drinking away his
[38:50] sorrows and before you know it this man
[38:52] of prestige who who had a position in a
[38:55] bank and he was the president there and
[38:57] he he had a nice home and a nice family
[38:59] but just in an instance it seemed uh
[39:01] from one uh from one something that
[39:04] happened and all sudden from another
[39:05] decision before he even knew it now he's
[39:07] just a drunk on the side of the road
[39:12] what happened
[39:14] oh you know my family fell apart and i i
[39:17] took up drinking and and you know that's
[39:19] why i'm at where i am that at now you
[39:22] know when you ask the question what
[39:24] happened to begs an answer
[39:27] how many of you have asked your kids
[39:28] what happened
[39:31] you know there's this commotion and
[39:33] there's this fight and there's the
[39:34] screaming or something anybody ever
[39:36] dealt with that
[39:37] my my house the only one
[39:40] you know the kids are they're fussing
[39:41] and they're fighting and and and all of
[39:43] a sudden it sounds like somebody died
[39:45] you're like what happened
[39:48] and and you you want to know
[39:50] look i i need information here i please
[39:53] tell me what happened so i can start to
[39:55] get the facts and i can start to
[39:56] understand and we can work through what
[39:59] is going on here because i need to know
[40:01] what's happened
[40:04] you know as
[40:06] we think of that question
[40:10] you know maybe i'd ask you what happened
[40:11] in your life in 2021
[40:17] what did you go through what did you do
[40:22] what did you deal with
[40:25] maybe you had heartache maybe you had uh
[40:28] milestones maybe you had some
[40:29] accomplishments that you're
[40:31] uh you're proud of
[40:33] maybe you feel like all you did is work
[40:35] and get older
[40:38] maybe you just feel the cares of life
[40:40] just continuing to to press on and
[40:43] and you're doing the best that you know
[40:45] how you're taking care of the family
[40:47] maybe you're taking care of the home and
[40:49] and my you just you just feel like
[40:51] you're you're to the grind and and you
[40:53] look back and you're like well i just
[40:54] maybe i i was i was trying to raise the
[40:57] family i was trying to do my best with
[40:59] the kids i was trying to take care of
[41:00] the home well brother matthew what do
[41:02] you mean what happened i look back
[41:04] at 2021 and and maybe there's no nothing
[41:06] a significant no highlight that that
[41:09] sticks out to you but i want to maybe
[41:10] make a parallel here because i would say
[41:13] that that that the way that you feel i i
[41:16] believe that sarah must have felt the
[41:18] same way
[41:20] here sarah was given a divine promise
[41:23] that she's the one that's supposed to be
[41:25] bringing forth the promised son but oh
[41:26] how many times in her life would it seem
[41:28] discouraging
[41:30] maybe abraham would be asking sarah
[41:32] sarah is if you feel a change is
[41:33] anything happening what's going on it's
[41:34] like well no no i don't it doesn't seem
[41:37] like anything's happening right now
[41:41] you know it didn't seem like
[41:44] anything great was happening in sarah's
[41:47] life
[41:49] all she could say is look i'm i'm just
[41:50] getting older
[41:52] i'm getting weaker i i have no ability
[41:55] within myself to bring forth this
[41:56] promised son that that you're wanting
[41:58] and we've certainly tried to bring it
[42:00] past in our own ways and we made a mess
[42:01] of things
[42:04] even so much so and that melchizedek
[42:06] would come there and stand in the tent
[42:07] door you know that there was something
[42:09] in her at that time where she would even
[42:11] laugh in her heart because she's like
[42:13] how me an old lady how could i even even
[42:15] have pleasure with my lord but i want to
[42:17] say no matter
[42:18] how hopeless it looks
[42:21] no matter how impossible it seems
[42:25] now just make you know put your
[42:26] spiritual thinking cap on because we're
[42:28] not just called to come here and have a
[42:31] good job and get a good education and
[42:33] try to get some nice things and and get
[42:36] a family and have some kids and die
[42:37] that's not why you're here
[42:40] that is not the purpose that god has
[42:42] intended for you in your life but god
[42:44] has something specific a specific
[42:47] thought that he had in his mind before
[42:49] the world was formed and he had thought
[42:51] you know when the world is falling apart
[42:54] when when satan's eden gets such to a
[42:57] condition where it's this bad and it's
[42:59] in the most evil age that it's ever been
[43:01] i'm going to have a group of people on
[43:04] the face of the earth that despite all
[43:07] of the wickedness and despite all the
[43:09] lewdness and everything that's in the
[43:11] land i'm going to have a people that are
[43:13] going to take sides with my word they're
[43:15] going to believe me no matter what comes
[43:18] their way
[43:21] to think that god has allowed 50 60
[43:24] years to go and the prophet's gone off
[43:25] the scene
[43:28] i don't think there's anybody here that
[43:29] could raise their hand and say i was in
[43:31] brother branham's meeting
[43:34] i don't think there's anybody here that
[43:36] that could say well you know i was there
[43:38] and brother branham discern the thoughts
[43:40] and intents of my heart and you have a a
[43:42] first-hand uh testimony in that regards
[43:45] of of of standing there uh face to face
[43:48] with the prophet
[43:51] you would think my uh why why didn't the
[43:54] culmination happen then but but god god
[43:56] has everything right in order
[43:59] everything is happening uh just
[44:02] on time
[44:04] i mean you think about when god decided
[44:06] to take the prophet home and the way he
[44:08] did it
[44:10] you imagine how people were walking
[44:11] around saying what happened
[44:14] i this doesn't make any sense to me i
[44:17] don't understand there you can imagine
[44:19] uh uh uh uh how great the weight and how
[44:23] how that great loss of o of the prophet
[44:27] who you know could uh that god would
[44:29] come and and take on that form and that
[44:31] flesh and he would speak thus saith the
[44:33] lord through those lips and and i i
[44:35] can't imagine what a comfort that would
[44:36] have been
[44:38] i mean look how many of you have a mom
[44:40] or a dad and
[44:41] and just and just having a mom or dad or
[44:43] brothers and sisters you just take
[44:45] comfort in that
[44:46] you know you might take it for granted
[44:48] you might not realize what you have
[44:50] until it's taken away from you
[44:53] you might have a family member or a
[44:54] loved one and and i tell you y'all hold
[44:57] them close to you
[44:59] love them cherish them because you don't
[45:00] know how long god will let them dwell
[45:02] with you on this side and and then when
[45:04] they're taken away from you all of a
[45:06] sudden there's there's an emptiness in
[45:08] your heart and you wonder what happened
[45:10] god why did that have to happen why did
[45:12] it have to go that way lord what does
[45:14] this all mean
[45:16] and you feel like you're left there to
[45:17] pick up the pieces oh i can't imagine
[45:21] you know many times i i think of people
[45:23] you know i don't mean to go this way but
[45:25] i just say it like i said a lot of
[45:26] people uh give brother joseph a hard
[45:28] time but you don't know what brother
[45:29] joseph had to go through a man a growing
[45:33] up who his dad was the prophet to the
[45:35] age
[45:37] and words were spoken over his life
[45:39] where it seemed such a great
[45:40] responsibility and him growing up all
[45:43] the time and all the testimonies oh me
[45:44] and your daddy me and your daddy me and
[45:46] your daddy your dad said this your dad
[45:48] said that and here this guy here poor
[45:50] joseph would sit there like you know i
[45:51] really never got to know my dad
[45:53] i never got to say and and to think he
[45:55] could stand there and make more my dad
[45:58] well i had the greatest dad that ever
[46:00] lived he would he would have that right
[46:02] to speak like that and to think of the
[46:04] pressure and and everything that had had
[46:06] worn on him and you can imagine
[46:08] what that man would go through with with
[46:10] everybody pulling on him and coming to
[46:12] him and him just wondering oh i just
[46:14] imagine there's been countless hours and
[46:17] countless days of of just trying and
[46:19] wondering lord why did you have to take
[46:21] my daddy
[46:24] see we don't put ourselves
[46:26] next to somebody like the prophet would
[46:28] he'd put his arms around somebody maybe
[46:31] line up his shoe there and and start to
[46:33] bear one another's burden
[46:35] but we just want to cast judgment on
[46:37] everybody
[46:38] who does he think he is you know he
[46:40] should be better than that and my we
[46:42] should really look up to him and if man
[46:44] if if that's what if that was his
[46:45] position i would never do that with
[46:47] shame on us
[46:50] i want to ask you what's happened to you
[46:51] in your life
[46:53] that would allow you to be in the seat
[46:55] of the scornful
[46:57] that would allow you to have so much
[46:58] pride and be so puffed up that you would
[47:00] be in a place where you could just cast
[47:02] judgment on everybody and think you got
[47:03] it all figured out
[47:07] but no we
[47:08] we we want to
[47:11] maybe narrow down our thought and start
[47:13] looking at what god has done in our life
[47:17] and maybe it looked impossible to sarah
[47:20] on how this word
[47:22] was going to be manifested
[47:24] so i'm bringing that right down home to
[47:26] you now
[47:28] oh we hear it over and over and the
[47:30] prophecies and the things that have been
[47:32] spoken we got a great responsibility
[47:34] church
[47:36] we've been called uh to the greatest
[47:38] responsibility that the age has ever
[47:40] known
[47:41] and that's to manifest the word the lord
[47:43] jesus christ and flesh to lay down the
[47:45] weight that so easily besets you to run
[47:48] this race with patience
[47:50] but we're doing it in an age that has
[47:52] such a demand and a pull on our flesh i
[47:54] wonder how we're doing with it
[48:00] and i could just think of sarah
[48:03] you know she could say you know i
[48:05] received a promise
[48:06] from melchizedek
[48:08] you know he appeared and he prophesied
[48:10] over my life and and he said according
[48:14] to the time of life that i i'm going
[48:17] to have a son
[48:19] well what's happened what what's
[48:21] happened sarah have you felt any change
[48:24] has there been anything that had
[48:25] happened
[48:28] but i could say that as sarah could you
[48:30] imagine
[48:32] after the promise has come to pass
[48:36] and now sarah has given birth to the
[48:38] promised son
[48:40] and then maybe those neighbors or some
[48:42] of the family are coming around and
[48:43] saying sarah
[48:45] what happened
[48:47] what happened to you i i i how can these
[48:49] things be and she could stand there and
[48:51] say well you know we were out there on
[48:53] the plains of memory there and i was
[48:55] standing i was actually inside the tent
[48:57] and here came melchizedek come walking
[48:59] by and he stood there and started
[49:01] talking to abraham and he said abraham
[49:04] where is your wife and he sat there and
[49:06] he prophesied over my life and he said
[49:09] according to the time of life sarah not
[49:12] another woman not another church but
[49:14] this bride the bride that's sitting here
[49:17] tonight this bride is going to bring
[49:19] forth the promised son
[49:21] oh she could stand there and say oh oh
[49:24] melchizedek came he spoke the word the
[49:27] saint of the lord and said i shall bring
[49:28] forth the promised son
[49:30] really sarah well that's that's
[49:32] wonderful what happened
[49:34] what happened then
[49:36] oh maybe she could say you know i asked
[49:38] the next day i woke up and nothing was
[49:40] any different
[49:44] you know i i kind of was wondering what
[49:46] happened
[49:48] and i started to think about how i was
[49:49] in there in a tent and when he had
[49:51] spoken and how i laughed it in my heart
[49:53] and and then even discern the thought
[49:55] and tits of my heart you know and and
[49:56] later
[49:58] i got to thinking about that and i
[50:00] really started asking myself who that
[50:01] really was
[50:03] because i really didn't know who that
[50:04] was at first
[50:06] but i realized that was god
[50:09] abraham called him lord that was
[50:12] melchizedek
[50:14] and as the story would go now i woke up
[50:15] the next day
[50:18] i didn't seem like there was any great
[50:20] change but you see sarah was living
[50:23] under a divine promise
[50:25] there had been a prophecy that had been
[50:27] spoken over sarah's life and regardless
[50:30] of how she was feeling regardless of how
[50:33] she looked that promise was going to
[50:35] come to pass and i i feel like sarah
[50:37] this evening where i can say oh i've
[50:39] received the promised word melchizedek
[50:42] has come in our generation and he has
[50:44] spoken a word he has given a thus saith
[50:47] the lord he has spoken a word over a
[50:49] bride that she will bring forth the
[50:51] promised son the lord jesus christ in
[50:53] flesh again and there is a people who
[50:56] are walking according to that promise
[50:59] and you're asking what happened oh what
[51:01] happened little
[51:03] by little
[51:04] day by day the scripture says and sarah
[51:07] receives strength to conceive
[51:12] that's what's happening to you
[51:15] as you meditate on the word day and
[51:17] night as you continue to pour yourself
[51:20] into the word as you continue to think
[51:22] about the words of the prophet you read
[51:25] your bible and you pray and you're
[51:27] looking towards this great promised word
[51:29] that you're wanting to be manifested in
[51:30] your life little by little
[51:34] like sarah you're being changed
[51:40] you're coming into that image
[51:42] and that perfection of the what the word
[51:44] calls you to be
[51:46] in this day
[51:48] you're living under promise
[51:52] you know verse 4 in the same chapter
[51:53] would say whereby are given unto us
[51:55] exceedingly
[51:56] great and precious promises
[51:59] that by these you might be partakers of
[52:01] divine nature
[52:03] escaped the corruption that is in the
[52:05] world through lust
[52:11] i know we're familiar with it
[52:13] we should be thankful for
[52:16] now we've been given great precious
[52:17] promises
[52:19] and it's by this promised word that
[52:21] we're partakers of divine nature
[52:24] and it's by this message that we escape
[52:26] the corruption that is in the world
[52:28] through lust
[52:30] because outside of this message you
[52:31] would be blind
[52:33] you wouldn't have the eye salve to see
[52:36] it's this message that the faith cometh
[52:39] by hearing the word
[52:41] not a word of 2000 years ago not a word
[52:44] from another age but the word for your
[52:46] age when it's revealed to you it brings
[52:48] i save that you might see in the wicked
[52:51] day that you're living in that you might
[52:53] know that there's more with us than
[52:55] there are against us
[52:56] and i just want to bring your attention
[52:58] back here to verse 10
[53:00] it says make your calling an election
[53:02] sure
[53:04] you know you might ask yourself what
[53:05] does that really mean
[53:07] brother matthew i've heard that so many
[53:09] times what does make your calling
[53:10] election sure
[53:12] really mean
[53:14] you know the prophet of god said we
[53:17] don't want to be just wondering if we're
[53:18] called
[53:20] he said you must be called or you'll be
[53:23] defeated
[53:25] you must be called
[53:27] or you will be defeated now that comes
[53:29] out of questions and answers where the
[53:31] prophet is dealing with a man who's uh
[53:33] wrestling with the call of god in his
[53:35] life to be a preacher
[53:38] but i feel it's it's very applicable
[53:41] because he would go on to say that
[53:43] that's
[53:44] what the trick of the enemy will do
[53:46] is he'll try to make you think you're
[53:48] not called when you're called
[53:50] has he tried that trick on you
[53:54] i mean that that dumb devil
[53:56] he still tries that trick on me
[54:01] just thinking maybe one day you'll buy
[54:03] it
[54:04] look you never accept from that because
[54:06] we go through life we go through trials
[54:08] we go through tribulations and he starts
[54:10] to make you question the call of god in
[54:11] your life
[54:13] and you know maybe just in reference in
[54:15] this scripture you know and there's
[54:17] certainly um
[54:19] there could be the broad call to
[54:20] christianity and then you know for those
[54:22] maybe if you're being called into the
[54:24] ministry or something like that then
[54:26] that's a specific call and and
[54:29] and truly we we we don't want to just be
[54:31] wondering if we're called because if we
[54:33] don't know we're called like the prophet
[54:34] said you'll be defeated and there's been
[54:36] a many a man who have started out
[54:39] been a little many of men who have
[54:40] thought they were called and they went
[54:42] out there into the battlefield and they
[54:43] fell out they were defeated
[54:45] but i want to deal more with this sense
[54:47] as as paul when he'd be writing to the
[54:49] romans he would say you know i paul i
[54:52] called
[54:53] an apostle of god and he said i'm
[54:56] writing to you romans who who are called
[54:58] the saints of god and that's what we're
[55:00] dealing with here because you you have
[55:02] been called
[55:03] to be the children of god you've been
[55:06] called to be the bride of christ and and
[55:08] we know these things we're familiar with
[55:10] them of how uh uh paul would speak there
[55:12] in ephesians and say you know you you're
[55:15] you're chosen you're predestinated uh
[55:17] you're elected we know that you're with
[55:19] him and you were in his thinking before
[55:21] the foundation of the world
[55:24] but you you might know those things but
[55:26] that that call
[55:28] and that election we got to make sure of
[55:30] that
[55:32] and if i could say it like this
[55:37] we want to be able to come to a place
[55:38] where all the doubts removed
[55:42] to remove the doubt
[55:44] there's no more question
[55:47] because if you keep wandering over that
[55:49] and you don't drive a stake down you're
[55:51] going to be defeated
[55:53] you'll come right back to that same
[55:54] place again in your life and you'll
[55:56] wonder why am i battling this again
[55:59] because you're going to keep wondering
[56:01] and questioning am i even called to be
[56:03] the bride of jesus christ
[56:05] have i even worked out my salvation with
[56:08] fear and trembling i want to tell you
[56:09] there's a place that you can come to
[56:11] tonight
[56:14] there's a place that you can come to
[56:16] where you can drive that anchor down
[56:18] where you're no more guessing you're no
[56:20] more wondering but god comes to you
[56:22] personally and reveals himself to you
[56:24] and takes away all the doubt that you
[56:27] know that you know that you know that
[56:29] you are called
[56:31] that you are elected
[56:33] of god
[56:36] oh when it's a revelation i just want to
[56:38] say that something changes
[56:41] something happens
[56:43] you know it
[56:45] it's not just a way of thinking
[56:49] you know as we we approach the new year
[56:51] and
[56:52] and
[56:54] people turn over turn a leaf or they
[56:56] turn the calendar and they
[56:58] they they they're gonna make their their
[57:00] their lives better they're they're gonna
[57:02] go on some type of of diet and drink
[57:05] crazy amounts of water all day long to
[57:07] flush out their system you know all
[57:09] these things they might do
[57:13] but when it's a revelation
[57:16] something changes
[57:19] it can't be questioned anymore
[57:22] and you know brother branham would
[57:24] uh speak about how
[57:28] he went into the emergency room one time
[57:30] and
[57:31] and i it seemed to be a one that would
[57:33] be for those who would have been insane
[57:35] and he he starts to tell the story of
[57:38] how
[57:39] he came there to i believe he speaks
[57:41] this and from that time and he he comes
[57:43] into the emergency room and he starts to
[57:45] describe
[57:46] uh the condition of the people as he
[57:48] looks around and there's people in
[57:50] straight jackets and and just big full
[57:52] beards and spittle hanging in their
[57:54] beards and and all he said these people
[57:56] just possessed with great demon powers
[57:59] and he said he looked there and he saw a
[58:01] young woman about 25 years old and she
[58:04] was a beautiful young woman and he
[58:05] looked at her and he said well i i just
[58:08] uh
[58:08] i don't even now i just wonder where i
[58:11] should start to start praying for these
[58:12] people
[58:13] and she looked at him and said well why
[58:15] don't you start with me
[58:17] and brother branham looked at her to you
[58:19] you're not a patient are you
[58:22] and she said yes

[58:30] problem

[58:34] well you're insane what happened
[58:39] and she starts to tell the story
[58:41] you know i was i was a good good girl i
[58:44] was i was raised in a christian home and
[58:46] but you know i started to go with this
[58:48] boy and i started to go with this boy we
[58:50] started to smoke cigarettes and and one
[58:52] night he spiked my coke
[58:54] and he put alcohol in my soda
[58:56] and from that time
[58:59] all of a sudden i found myself i was
[59:01] chasing after the things of the world
[59:04] and i ended up uh being a prostitute and
[59:07] all of a sudden i found myself
[59:11] in a place i never thought i could be
[59:15] said oh i tried to clean up my life i
[59:17] tried to turn a page
[59:19] you know i'd do better i i would do
[59:20] better and i went to the good shepherd's
[59:22] home a catholic organization and i went
[59:24] there for three years
[59:26] and i i i you know i was doing better
[59:28] you know i felt good about myself i i
[59:31] was putting the right steps in front of
[59:33] the other and i was ready to go back out
[59:35] there in the world because i had turned
[59:37] a page i had a new chapter in my life
[59:39] and i was ready to go out there and face
[59:41] the world
[59:42] but she said you know i went back out
[59:44] there and as soon as i got right back
[59:46] out there with a crowd i was right back
[59:48] out there doing the same thing again
[59:51] she said i i tried another few years and
[59:54] i went back to doing the same things and
[59:56] then i ended up in the in the being
[59:58] incarcerated for two years
[1:00:01] and she was like i was sure then
[1:00:04] when i was incarcerated
[1:00:07] that i i had found the things that i
[1:00:09] needed to change my life
[1:00:11] i had gotten the right approach and the
[1:00:13] right thinking you know and i i really
[1:00:15] turned the page now
[1:00:17] i was ready to go back out there into
[1:00:18] the world and i i i was ready to live a
[1:00:21] life for jesus i so i got out of being
[1:00:23] incarcerated i went and became a part of
[1:00:25] the church and and i became a partner
[1:00:27] and had uh talks with a chaplain but she
[1:00:30] said you know
[1:00:31] there's just something
[1:00:34] it got a hold of me and it took me right
[1:00:36] back to that place again
[1:00:39] now you might not be able to identify to
[1:00:41] it on that scale
[1:00:43] but you know the devil has demon powers
[1:00:45] that will hold you in a condition
[1:00:47] that'll keep you from going on with god
[1:00:49] and he'll hold you right there until you
[1:00:51] come to a place of deliverance
[1:00:57] and the prophet of god would look at her
[1:00:59] and he'd say you know sister
[1:01:01] i believe that's a demon power
[1:01:04] that's having that effect on you and
[1:01:06] your life
[1:01:08] and she would say oh i know it is
[1:01:12] and he would ask her
[1:01:14] do you want to be delivered from that
[1:01:16] she's more than anything
[1:01:18] do you want to do you want to be a good
[1:01:19] wife and have a good family and live a
[1:01:21] christian life more than anything i want
[1:01:23] that he said well then why don't i pray
[1:01:25] with you
[1:01:26] and they got down and they started to
[1:01:28] pray there
[1:01:31] and they got on their knees and it was
[1:01:32] just after a little while
[1:01:35] she got up and she was crying
[1:01:38] she had tears coming down her face and
[1:01:40] said brother random
[1:01:44] i'm gonna go start a new life
[1:01:47] i'm gonna go live for god
[1:01:50] the prophet looked at her and said
[1:01:51] you've done that already
[1:01:55] that's the problem you've done that over
[1:01:58] and over and over you've gotten up
[1:02:01] and you've turned a page
[1:02:03] and you've tried to go on
[1:02:07] and live a christian life
[1:02:10] he said that's not going to do you any
[1:02:12] good
[1:02:14] the prophet would say this he'd say
[1:02:18] sister dear you're just simply turning a
[1:02:21] page
[1:02:22] it won't do you any good i said you've
[1:02:24] done that so many times
[1:02:26] just stay here until god speaks back to
[1:02:30] you
[1:02:31] we've got we got down there together and
[1:02:34] prayed
[1:02:35] and i left praying and went on
[1:02:37] pray with the other people
[1:02:39] and after a while she rose up from there
[1:02:42] and looked around in the room
[1:02:45] those big eyes looking at me and she
[1:02:48] said
[1:02:49] something happened to me
[1:02:52] i said now you've got it
[1:02:55] now you've got it you don't have to turn
[1:02:58] new pages now
[1:02:59] it's happened
[1:03:01] you've got it and from that time she was
[1:03:04] a changed person she's married got a
[1:03:07] lovely home and and two children now she
[1:03:10] can point her fingers to a time that
[1:03:13] something happened to her that was
[1:03:15] immortal
[1:03:17] things happen and life changed but there
[1:03:20] is something
[1:03:21] hallelujah
[1:03:23] that can
[1:03:24] happen to a person
[1:03:26] that won't change
[1:03:27] you cannot be the same after this
[1:03:29] happens
[1:03:30] that's when a man meets god
[1:03:33] he's changed
[1:03:35] something happens to him
[1:03:38] oh hallelujah

[1:05:15] i want to remind you of his promises
[1:05:18] i want to remind you of what god has
[1:05:20] done
[1:05:22] oh it wasn't just too long ago
[1:05:24] that you were flipped upside down
[1:05:27] in a car drunk and on a dead-end street
[1:05:30] to hell but what happened it wasn't too
[1:05:33] long ago you were just bar hopping
[1:05:36] barsing the bar scene but something
[1:05:38] happened it wasn't too long ago that you
[1:05:40] were bound by denominational way of
[1:05:43] thinking but something happened it
[1:05:45] wasn't too long ago that you were
[1:05:47] writing a message church pew and you
[1:05:49] thought you all right but something
[1:05:51] happened
[1:05:53] oh glory to god
[1:05:55] i want to stir you up tonight i want to
[1:05:57] get you so stirred up that all those
[1:06:00] things that god has done and the things
[1:06:02] that god has said to you will be solely
[1:06:04] caught up into your remembrance that
[1:06:06] something will start to rise up within
[1:06:08] you
[1:06:10] that you'll be stirred
[1:06:14] that'll become fresh again
[1:06:20] look let's not be like the first church
[1:06:24] i have somewhat with you
[1:06:28] i know i know your trial i know your
[1:06:30] your persecutions i know what you've
[1:06:31] gone through but i have somewhat against
[1:06:33] you
[1:06:35] what what do we do you lost your first
[1:06:37] love
[1:06:39] something something that's taken place
[1:06:41] where all of a sudden that same love
[1:06:43] that you have
[1:06:45] it's now it's now waning and the candle
[1:06:48] is going out something that happened
[1:06:52] prophet would say what happens is the
[1:06:53] world starts to creep in
[1:06:56] formalism starts to creep in
[1:06:59] he would say that you left that love
[1:07:02] that you once had
[1:07:03] for them good
[1:07:05] old-fashioned holy ghost meetings
[1:07:08] and begin to backslide
[1:07:10] you know why people don't like good
[1:07:12] old-fashioned holy ghost meetings
[1:07:15] it calls you out
[1:07:19] it exposes you
[1:07:21] i ain't trying to say we gotta have a
[1:07:23] big hoop law but if we we can have a
[1:07:24] holy ghost
[1:07:26] field meeting right now
[1:07:29] that's what should be taking place
[1:07:32] but what's your expectation
[1:07:34] what did you come for
[1:07:36] did you come forward to be pepped up and
[1:07:37] propped up and petted and and sent back
[1:07:40] out to the workforce and say you're
[1:07:41] doing a good job just hang on till you
[1:07:43] die
[1:07:45] you're coming to be a part of something
[1:07:47] you're coming to worship your lord jesus
[1:07:50] christ who saved you who redeemed you
[1:07:52] who calls you look i'm trying to remind
[1:07:54] you something's happened
[1:07:56] there's not a church here in bedford
[1:07:58] texas for no reason
[1:08:00] but something's happened
[1:08:02] god has come he's made himself unknown
[1:08:05] to a people
[1:08:07] a people that wants to love him a people
[1:08:09] that wants to serve him a people that
[1:08:11] wants to rejoice in what he's done and a
[1:08:13] people that want to hear from god
[1:08:19] maybe something has happened
[1:08:22] and caused you to question the message
[1:08:26] it's possible
[1:08:29] maybe something's happened it's caused
[1:08:31] you to question the ministry and you're
[1:08:32] sitting right now
[1:08:34] in this pew
[1:08:36] and you're wondering how much longer
[1:08:39] you'll be able to go
[1:08:42] because things
[1:08:45] really haven't happened the way you
[1:08:47] might have thought they would have
[1:08:48] unfolded
[1:08:50] and you're a little discouraged and
[1:08:54] you're wondering what happened
[1:08:56] why are we in this place
[1:08:58] where we're at
[1:09:01] maybe something has happened that's
[1:09:02] caused trust issues in your life
[1:09:06] and you just find out there's something
[1:09:08] in you
[1:09:10] that when it comes to taking god at his
[1:09:12] word or
[1:09:13] or
[1:09:14] or recognizing
[1:09:17] the leadership in the church there's
[1:09:19] just
[1:09:20] there's there's just something there
[1:09:23] that's causing you to to draw back
[1:09:27] and you're finding that
[1:09:29] the leadership of god seems far away
[1:09:30] from you
[1:09:32] and you're kind of confused and you're
[1:09:33] wondering how did i ever get here
[1:09:36] because the devil's been able to
[1:09:39] take away you having trust in the
[1:09:41] leadership of the lord
[1:09:43] trust in the body
[1:09:45] trust in his word
[1:09:48] maybe something's happened
[1:09:51] you know this is a cruel world we live
[1:09:52] in
[1:09:55] and hard things happen to us
[1:09:58] our family situations and things we go
[1:10:00] through
[1:10:01] can be very traumatizing
[1:10:03] and have psychological effects on you
[1:10:05] and
[1:10:06] it can cause you not to trust people and
[1:10:08] it can cause you to to have a certain a
[1:10:11] response or reaction or or maybe you're
[1:10:14] just one of those where you just you
[1:10:15] don't you know you're never going to
[1:10:16] open up your heart again because you
[1:10:18] don't ever want to be hurt again don't
[1:10:19] cut don't come don't come knocking on
[1:10:21] that door lord
[1:10:23] i'm not ready to open that up
[1:10:26] no one's allowed in there lord i don't
[1:10:27] want to open up every room of my heart
[1:10:29] ah you can come only so far
[1:10:33] but your lord is wanting to come and
[1:10:36] come into that room of hurt
[1:10:38] and put his arms around you let you know
[1:10:40] that it's okay
[1:10:42] and that he loves you and it's not your
[1:10:44] fault and he forgives you
[1:10:46] and it's okay and you'll be all right if
[1:10:48] you'll just trust me
[1:10:50] you'll just follow this message with all
[1:10:52] of your heart and don't worry about what
[1:10:54] the world says or what your family says
[1:10:56] but if you'll just give your whole heart
[1:10:57] to me
[1:10:59] just trust me
[1:11:02] you can just
[1:11:03] die out
[1:11:05] to all that hurt
[1:11:07] those things that have happened in the
[1:11:08] past maybe you're wondering what
[1:11:10] happened to me why am i in this
[1:11:12] condition
[1:11:16] you know the devil will make you feel
[1:11:18] condemned
[1:11:21] it'll make you feel unworthy
[1:11:25] make you feel
[1:11:26] incapable and unable and
[1:11:31] it's not for you and
[1:11:34] you're never going to be doing any
[1:11:35] different
[1:11:36] and why try
[1:11:38] why why even try to overcome anymore
[1:11:41] every time you try
[1:11:44] every time you try to make a change you
[1:11:45] just end up
[1:11:47] falling right back on your face
[1:11:50] why even get back up again why don't you
[1:11:52] just stay down there
[1:11:55] because every time you've gotten back up
[1:11:56] it's not you that's getting up
[1:12:00] there's something inside of you that
[1:12:02] will not quit
[1:12:05] you can try to quit you can try to throw
[1:12:08] in the towel you can try to give up but
[1:12:10] there is something inside of the
[1:12:12] believer that no matter what you think
[1:12:15] you want to do there is an anchor that
[1:12:17] is holding you and as far as you run out
[1:12:20] there into sin and as far as you run out
[1:12:22] there into the world there's an anchor
[1:12:24] that is attached to your heart and he's
[1:12:27] going to keep pulling and he's going to
[1:12:28] keep pulling and it's going to keep
[1:12:30] pulling oh has anybody ever been out
[1:12:32] there on a big fish and you start to
[1:12:34] reel it in and it's getting closer to
[1:12:36] the boat and there it goes running again
[1:12:38] and it runs a little bit and it gets
[1:12:39] tired and then it keeps reeling it back
[1:12:41] in it gets close to the boat and then it
[1:12:43] runs all i want to tell you the lord
[1:12:45] jesus god has set a hook in you that
[1:12:47] hook could never come out he was set
[1:12:49] there before the world was ever formed
[1:12:52] he had thoughts of joy thoughts of peace
[1:12:54] thoughts of love about you and when you
[1:12:56] came into manifestation in this age
[1:12:58] there was a predestinated hook in your
[1:13:01] heart that the world would never satisfy
[1:13:03] you you can keep running you can run
[1:13:05] this way and you can run that way but
[1:13:07] he's going to keep reeling you in he's
[1:13:10] going to keep bringing you in oh church
[1:13:12] i say you're right at the boat now why
[1:13:14] don't you just let the arms of his love
[1:13:16] and that gospel net just pull you on
[1:13:18] board with him
[1:13:22] you'll find it
[1:13:24] it's hard to run
[1:13:27] it gets worrisome it gets tired
[1:13:31] but the devil will try to make you feel
[1:13:33] so unworthy and condemned
[1:13:40] get you thinking in such a way that
[1:13:43] he doesn't love me
[1:13:44] this message isn't for me
[1:13:48] you know i
[1:13:50] want to just reference this story the
[1:13:53] prophet tells
[1:13:55] he was preaching some meetings in ohio
[1:13:57] and
[1:14:00] he starts to tell the story he says you
[1:14:03] know i
[1:14:04] i was there at a dunkard restaurant does
[1:14:06] anybody know what a dunkard restaurant
[1:14:07] is

[1:14:42] atmosphere he said but you know on
[1:14:44] sunday they close up
[1:14:46] and they go to church so i found myself
[1:14:49] i had to go down to just like any any
[1:14:50] old american cafe
[1:14:52] and he said i i came to that cafe and i
[1:14:55] stepped into there he says as i stepped
[1:14:57] in there i
[1:14:59] oh what a contrast
[1:15:01] he sees this man with his arm around
[1:15:04] another woman probably not his wife and
[1:15:06] they're playing the slot machine
[1:15:08] and here's a police officer uh standing
[1:15:11] there and and he starts to survey the
[1:15:13] scene and think my
[1:15:15] you know gambling's not even legal
[1:15:17] in ohio and
[1:15:19] and here
[1:15:20] here this man is is playing the slot
[1:15:22] machine and this officer here is and
[1:15:25] they're breaking the law and he started
[1:15:27] to look around and there in the back
[1:15:28] corner there was
[1:15:31] there was if i can get a little more
[1:15:33] sound on this y'all said y'all would
[1:15:34] blow me out but i feel like i've been
[1:15:35] working up here
[1:15:40] he said
[1:15:41] you know i look back there in in the
[1:15:43] corner and there's these teenage boys
[1:15:45] who
[1:15:46] uh were on the jukebox and and they were
[1:15:48] playing their music
[1:15:51] and you know i i i looked over there and
[1:15:54] here here was this
[1:15:56] this
[1:15:57] waiter standing there and
[1:15:59] oh she was an older lady and she was
[1:16:01] wearing those vulgar clothes and and her
[1:16:04] and she was her flabbler was hanging out
[1:16:06] and she was standing there with with
[1:16:08] purple toenails and and purple
[1:16:10] fingernails and her and her hair was cut
[1:16:12] real short and it was dyed blue
[1:16:15] he says and i looked over there at the
[1:16:17] table and and there was these two men
[1:16:19] that were were sitting there and he had
[1:16:21] like an army overcoat and a scarf on and
[1:16:23] a big old beard and it was the middle of
[1:16:25] the summer
[1:16:26] and they were drunk and and carrying on
[1:16:29] he's oh just what a new place it was
[1:16:33] and those two men got up and they
[1:16:34] started to go to the restroom and the
[1:16:36] prophet
[1:16:37] stood and looked around there and he
[1:16:38] said oh god
[1:16:40] why don't you just burn the whole place
[1:16:43] why don't you just sink the whole thing
[1:16:46] and he kind of just stepped off to the
[1:16:47] side there and he said he felt the
[1:16:49] presence of the lord come
[1:16:52] and of all of a sudden he felt the
[1:16:53] presence of the lord he saw something to
[1:16:55] come start whirling there
[1:16:57] and all of a sudden he was caught there
[1:16:59] in a vision and he saw the world there
[1:17:01] was just turning around and there was
[1:17:02] this scarlet streak
[1:17:04] that was going around the world
[1:17:07] and as he he saw that
[1:17:09] the world spinning this this scarlet
[1:17:12] streak like blood going around the world
[1:17:13] he said all of a sudden
[1:17:15] i saw myself there as a little boy there
[1:17:18] playing and i saw myself as a boy
[1:17:20] growing up there
[1:17:21] and every time i would sin
[1:17:24] my sins would start to go up
[1:17:26] towards heaven and oh if my sins ever
[1:17:28] meet that every sinner oh he's a
[1:17:30] righteous god if your sins ever make it
[1:17:32] there you're doomed for judgment you've
[1:17:34] got to die if your sin ever hits there
[1:17:36] but he said as my sin started to go up
[1:17:38] there
[1:17:39] there was this bumper there and all of a
[1:17:41] sudden i noticed there was jesus
[1:17:43] standing there ah there was spit in his
[1:17:46] beard and he had a crown of thorns on
[1:17:48] and he was bleeding he was standing
[1:17:49] there and every time my sin would go out
[1:17:51] there he would reach out and you'd grab
[1:17:53] it
[1:17:56] i got a little bit closer to here
[1:17:57] because i could tell he was saying
[1:17:59] something and he would say
[1:18:00] father
[1:18:01] forgive him for he knows not what he
[1:18:03] does
[1:18:05] and there was a recording angel there
[1:18:08] off to his side he was writing a book
[1:18:10] and every sin and everything that you've
[1:18:12] ever done was being recorded in that
[1:18:15] book
[1:18:17] every thought every bad deed everything
[1:18:20] was being written in there
[1:18:22] and it was at that moment that prophet
[1:18:25] he looked there
[1:18:27] and he started to cry out to god and so
[1:18:28] god forgive me
[1:18:30] forgive me for my sins lord forgive me
[1:18:33] for what i've done
[1:18:37] lord i
[1:18:38] i'm unworthy to be your servant lord oh
[1:18:41] please forgive me forgive me for what
[1:18:44] i've done all my sins lord
[1:18:46] and then all of a sudden
[1:18:48] he said he saw him reaching to his side
[1:18:51] there
[1:18:53] and he got blood and he took that book
[1:18:55] and he wrote pardon on it and he threw
[1:18:58] it into the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:19:00] and said you're forgiven
[1:19:06] and he looked at him and
[1:19:08] this vision would unfold god would speak
[1:19:10] to him and say
[1:19:13] i've forgiven you
[1:19:15] but you want to condemn that woman
[1:19:16] that's sitting there
[1:19:20] the prophet said he learned a hard
[1:19:21] lesson that way
[1:19:25] he learned a hard lesson that
[1:19:28] i've forgiven you
[1:19:30] but you want to condemn that woman
[1:19:33] i started to put myself
[1:19:36] there
[1:19:37] i started to think about that
[1:19:40] all of our sins every one of them going
[1:19:44] but there's a bumper of blood
[1:19:47] i want to maybe remind you a little bit
[1:19:49] and stir you up look you know where
[1:19:51] you've come from
[1:19:53] you know what god's done for you
[1:19:56] you know what he's done in your life you
[1:19:58] know how he's forgiven you
[1:20:01] you know he's
[1:20:02] said pardoned he's took that whole book
[1:20:05] of remembrance
[1:20:06] of all your sins and all your failures
[1:20:08] and with his own blood
[1:20:10] he's written pardon on and he's through
[1:20:12] it in a god's sea of forgetfulness
[1:20:16] and how easily we forget
[1:20:19] how easily we become judgmental
[1:20:22] how easily
[1:20:23] we find ourselves
[1:20:28] losing our first love
[1:20:31] allowing the things of the world to
[1:20:33] creep in
[1:20:35] allowing us to become formal
[1:20:38] i just want to say god help me
[1:20:41] god help me to love you more
[1:20:44] lord create in me a clean heart
[1:20:46] renew a right spirit within me o god
[1:20:50] cast me not away from my presence lord
[1:20:54] maybe that's what's on my heart i want
[1:20:56] to stir you up a little bit
[1:20:58] and you could you could start to
[1:21:00] remember your first love
[1:21:02] and what it was like to be set free
[1:21:05] what it was like
[1:21:06] to be delivered
[1:21:09] what it was like to have that burden of
[1:21:11] sin lifted
[1:21:12] oh my does anybody know what it's like
[1:21:16] did anybody think back to that time
[1:21:20] where there was a mountain of sin on
[1:21:22] your shoulders
[1:21:24] you didn't even realize the weight you
[1:21:27] didn't even realize how hopeless you
[1:21:29] were because you'd never experienced
[1:21:31] anything different you just knew
[1:21:33] something wasn't right
[1:21:36] but then something happened
[1:21:39] something changed
[1:21:42] and you became different
[1:21:45] you come to know the lord and the power
[1:21:46] of his resurrection and he forgave you
[1:21:49] all all of your sins
[1:21:51] does anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:21:54] i just want you to meditate on that for
[1:21:56] a little bit
[1:21:57] maybe a little simple
[1:21:59] sermon but as we're bringing in the new
[1:22:01] year
[1:22:02] i want to put you in a remembrance
[1:22:05] i want you to start thinking about what
[1:22:06] god has done for you
[1:22:12] we don't even know what all he's done
[1:22:14] for us
[1:22:15] just those things he's revealed to us
[1:22:20] maybe there's somebody here that needs
[1:22:21] something to happen
[1:22:24] maybe in your heart you're sitting here
[1:22:26] and you're saying brother matthew
[1:22:28] i hear what you're saying
[1:22:31] but i need something to happen in my
[1:22:33] life
[1:22:35] there's somebody here that says you know
[1:22:36] what i need something to happen in my
[1:22:37] life
[1:22:38] i need a change
[1:22:41] i need a difference i need a difference
[1:22:43] maker i need something to happen to me
[1:22:48] maybe you need deliverance
[1:22:53] i want to ask you
[1:22:55] where's that joy you used to have
[1:23:01] where's that fire for god
[1:23:07] where's that love
[1:23:10] that zealousness
[1:23:11] to serve him
[1:23:15] we go through life and
[1:23:18] we have great challenges and
[1:23:19] responsibilities come
[1:23:23] you know when we
[1:23:25] we kind of become
[1:23:27] we start to tolerate things
[1:23:30] you know your worst enemy is yourself
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:35] your worst enemy is yourself
[1:23:37] and i kind of was uh thinking
[1:23:40] maybe along those lines on a thought
[1:23:42] that god might have in my heart for the
[1:23:44] young people this weekend but
[1:23:46] you know you're your own worst enemy
[1:23:50] and i find that what
[1:23:53] the deception is is
[1:23:56] we start to not discern
[1:24:00] who the enemy is anymore
[1:24:02] and we start to tolerate habits and
[1:24:05] actions in our own life
[1:24:08] because it's just kind of you
[1:24:10] but then you have the other you who's
[1:24:12] predestinated ordained who can't miss it
[1:24:15] and and if you're not careful you just
[1:24:17] allow these two separate beings if you
[1:24:20] will look
[1:24:21] you know this is a pest house
[1:24:25] look in the mirror
[1:24:27] and say you are my worst enemy
[1:24:30] maybe that'll help you out every morning
[1:24:33] maybe you ought to just walk into the
[1:24:35] bathroom with a big ol smile and go you
[1:24:37] know what guy
[1:24:38] you are my worst enemy
[1:24:42] and i hate you
[1:24:47] well would that be all right
[1:24:49] because if we're not careful
[1:24:52] what happens i was thinking about this
[1:24:54] you know this is a it's a home right
[1:24:57] it's a home and maybe you live in a
[1:24:59] house and and maybe there there's
[1:25:01] something in your house that needs to be
[1:25:03] fixed
[1:25:06] and you know you need to fix it
[1:25:09] maybe something in your car you need to
[1:25:11] fix or something that you needed to
[1:25:12] change
[1:25:13] and you needed to change it have you
[1:25:15] ever put a reminder up
[1:25:17] and you leave the reminder there so long
[1:25:19] it's not a reminder anymore
[1:25:23] because it becomes common
[1:25:26] you know you're living in a house and
[1:25:28] you know the ac needs to be fixed or you
[1:25:30] need to change the filters or something
[1:25:32] but what you do is you you start to
[1:25:34] tolerate the condition
[1:25:38] and many times you'll find people living
[1:25:40] in a condition
[1:25:42] they'll become oblivious to it
[1:25:45] until somebody comes over
[1:25:48] that's not living in that condition
[1:25:51] and they come over there be like hey
[1:25:54] dude do you not realize the smell's in
[1:25:56] here
[1:25:58] yeah right
[1:25:59] yeah there's
[1:26:01] there's there must be something dead in
[1:26:03] here
[1:26:04] come to find out your plumbing's leaking
[1:26:06] or something and there's something you
[1:26:09] you maybe have noticed at first but you
[1:26:10] start to tolerate it i wonder church if
[1:26:14] you eat that oh my god set you free he
[1:26:17] set you soaring and you're sworn in the
[1:26:20] heavenlies and you're so free and so
[1:26:22] delivered but but but as life continued
[1:26:25] to happen
[1:26:27] and satan's eden keeps pressing upon you
[1:26:30] and the kids start coming and oh you
[1:26:33] make exceptions for this and you make
[1:26:35] exceptions for that and before you know
[1:26:37] it your prayer life's gone reading the
[1:26:39] bible's gone and you're tolerating this
[1:26:41] music and that movies and this and that
[1:26:44] and before you know it
[1:26:51] you know how i i i i give myself advice
[1:26:53] a lot
[1:26:58] i ask myself well what happens if that
[1:27:00] was another young brother that came and
[1:27:01] asked you that oh i know the answer
[1:27:04] but we don't have the answer for ourself
[1:27:07] come on
[1:27:09] think of in your own life the things
[1:27:11] that you tolerate
[1:27:13] and ask yourself if another young
[1:27:15] brother or young sister came to you and
[1:27:16] said brother so and so i'm doing these
[1:27:19] things and those things what do you
[1:27:20] think about it
[1:27:23] what advice would you would you give
[1:27:24] them
[1:27:29] maybe we've become some hypocrites
[1:27:32] let me preach at myself a little bit
[1:27:35] because we think we can handle it
[1:27:39] but but i'm not even trying to go that
[1:27:41] direction
[1:27:42] i'm not trying to
[1:27:44] to to make this a rules and regulations
[1:27:46] because what i'm what i'm wanting to do
[1:27:50] i want to stir your heart up that you'll
[1:27:52] be in love with him
[1:27:56] but you'll just go back to that place
[1:28:00] where he set you free
[1:28:04] and think about how hopeless you were
[1:28:07] and how lost you were
[1:28:09] and i was thinking as they were
[1:28:11] we were bringing in the new year and we
[1:28:12] were hearing testimonies of
[1:28:14] what god's done
[1:28:17] i thought that's right
[1:28:19] that's good
[1:28:21] i think each one of us need to give our
[1:28:23] testimony
[1:28:26] i think we need to get out there in the
[1:28:27] highways and byways and start telling
[1:28:29] somebody what god done for us
[1:28:33] if you need a scripture to give the same
[1:28:35] testimony over again to your family i
[1:28:38] got one for you
[1:28:40] just say i know i know you've heard it
[1:28:42] before
[1:28:43] but paul said as long as i'm in this
[1:28:45] tabernacle
[1:28:47] i find it needful to put you in
[1:28:49] remembrance of these things i just want
[1:28:50] to tell you again
[1:28:52] you remember that time
[1:28:54] when i was 21 years old and i got in
[1:28:56] that big old mess and i didn't know what
[1:28:58] to do and i cried out to god i said god
[1:29:01] whatever this is it's bigger than me and
[1:29:03] i need your help and jesus christ came
[1:29:06] on the scene and something happened i
[1:29:09] was changed and i've never been the same
[1:29:11] since
[1:29:13] oh we start to re revisit that
[1:29:17] we start to put ourselves in remembrance
[1:29:19] of that and if you start staying true to
[1:29:21] that you'll find all these things that
[1:29:23] you started to tolerate
[1:29:26] why don't we just get back in love with
[1:29:28] him again
[1:29:30] why don't we purpose in our heart for
[1:29:33] 2022
[1:29:35] that we'll fall in love with him again
[1:29:38] oh there's a song that says i keep
[1:29:40] falling in love with him
[1:29:42] over and over and over and over again
[1:29:47] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:29:49] for those
[1:29:50] of you
[1:29:52] that are married
[1:29:55] well no doubt we love one another
[1:29:59] but you know we don't say the same same
[1:30:01] things like we used to we don't spend
[1:30:03] the same time like we used to
[1:30:10] i think it would be good to do that
[1:30:13] we need to take time with our spouses
[1:30:15] and tell them how much we love them and
[1:30:16] take time with them because there was a
[1:30:18] time in the world where you would move
[1:30:20] mountains
[1:30:22] just to spend the day with them
[1:30:25] and now
[1:30:26] you move mountains just to go play golf
[1:30:30] you move mountains just to go hunting
[1:30:32] you move mountains just so brother
[1:30:34] matthew you're about to get some people
[1:30:35] in trouble
[1:30:38] you know something that i always try to
[1:30:40] do
[1:30:42] is if i see something in my natural life
[1:30:45] i look into my spiritual
[1:30:49] this might sound really silly but if
[1:30:51] your room's a mess
[1:30:55] you might want to start looking at your
[1:30:57] spiritual life
[1:31:00] if you find out there's things in the
[1:31:01] natural that aren't just don't look
[1:31:03] right
[1:31:05] you you might realize that
[1:31:07] you're not in tune with the holy spirit
[1:31:10] that might sound super simple i tell you
[1:31:12] give it a try
[1:31:16] it's little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:31:18] and
[1:31:19] things we start to tolerate
[1:31:21] and here the still small voice of the
[1:31:23] lord is is is speaking to you
[1:31:26] wanting to to reel you in and pull you
[1:31:28] closer to his bosom but we just start to
[1:31:30] tolerate the things of the world
[1:31:33] but you know when the children of israel
[1:31:34] came into the promised land
[1:31:38] it was time for a house cleaning
[1:31:41] i say in 2022 let's let's clean the
[1:31:43] house and fall in love again
[1:31:46] could all of y'all agree with me with me
[1:31:49] in 2022 let's just stand to our feet
[1:31:55] can everybody agree with your heart so
[1:31:56] you know what 20 22 i want a clean house
[1:31:59] and fall in love with god
[1:32:02] because i know if i can just start to to
[1:32:04] fall in love with him again
[1:32:06] if i can just be stirred up into
[1:32:07] remembrance of what god has done for me
[1:32:10] i know all these little things that i've
[1:32:12] started to tolerate
[1:32:13] will start to fall away
[1:32:15] and you'll find yourself finding time to
[1:32:17] read your bible you'll find your time
[1:32:20] starting to pray you'll find time for
[1:32:22] your family you'll find time for your
[1:32:23] wife why because it's god in you that's
[1:32:26] willing to do it
[1:32:28] because that's the spirit of christ
[1:32:31] the spirit of christ isn't selfish
[1:32:35] it's a spirit of love
[1:32:37] maybe they just start playing something
[1:32:39] i want to read this quote
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:56] i like how paul said we are eyewitnesses
[1:32:58] of his majesty
[1:33:01] you know this this isn't a story this
[1:33:02] isn't a fable
[1:33:04] this isn't
[1:33:07] something fake but
[1:33:09] but something has happened something is
[1:33:12] you you want to have that type of
[1:33:14] experience where you're changed
[1:33:16] and you say brother matthew how will i
[1:33:18] know
[1:33:20] well i can only say it's like this like
[1:33:24] faith is the sixth sense
[1:33:28] i don't have to see the piano to know
[1:33:29] it's there
[1:33:31] i can hear it
[1:33:33] i don't have to see the pulpit to know
[1:33:35] it's there i can feel it
[1:33:38] and when faith anchors in the word of
[1:33:39] god and it's revealed to you
[1:33:42] you don't have to see it
[1:33:44] you don't have to touch it
[1:33:46] you don't have to feel it
[1:33:48] but it's a revelation something's
[1:33:49] changed something's become a part of you
[1:33:52] something has happened
[1:33:54] that you can get up
[1:33:56] like that poor 25 year old girl that was
[1:33:58] in an insane institution who had tried
[1:34:01] over and over again and she had gone on
[1:34:03] her knees and and prayed she even got on
[1:34:05] her knees there with the prophet and
[1:34:07] with good intentions she stood back up
[1:34:09] said okay brother random i'm gonna go
[1:34:11] now
[1:34:12] so that's not it
[1:34:14] get on your knees until he speaks back
[1:34:17] until something happens until you're
[1:34:19] changed
[1:34:22] the prophet would say this
[1:34:24] you can accept it by faith
[1:34:27] you have to accept christ by faith
[1:34:31] that's exactly right
[1:34:33] and you have
[1:34:35] and you accept the holy spirit by faith
[1:34:40] but then let the holy spirit come and
[1:34:41] give the circumcision
[1:34:44] as a witness
[1:34:45] that he's accepted
[1:34:47] your faith you see
[1:34:50] then see abraham believed god
[1:34:53] and it was imputed to him for
[1:34:54] righteousness
[1:34:59] but god give him the sign of
[1:35:00] circumcision
[1:35:02] as a confirmation
[1:35:04] he had accepted his faith
[1:35:07] so that's the same thing we must do
[1:35:10] we must wait on the holy spirit till
[1:35:13] it's done something
[1:35:15] not necessarily because we spoke in
[1:35:16] tongues not because we've danced or we
[1:35:19] got emotional or we shouted
[1:35:21] until we're changed
[1:35:24] until something actually happened
[1:35:28] i don't care what form it comes in
[1:35:31] just so it happened
[1:35:32] that's the main thing see i want to
[1:35:35] remind you
[1:35:36] something
[1:35:39] has actually
[1:35:40] happened it's my words that's what i
[1:35:43] want to do i want to remind you
[1:35:46] that something has actually happened
[1:35:50] just think about
[1:35:51] what he's done for you a little bit
[1:35:53] it's the close of the service just take
[1:35:56] a moment to worship the lord
[1:36:01] they would take this time to really
[1:36:03] meditate
[1:36:05] maybe you just think back
[1:36:07] you remember the bondage you were in
[1:36:10] you remember how hopeless
[1:36:12] it seemed
[1:36:14] maybe your family situation
[1:36:17] maybe god had called you to the message
[1:36:19] and you didn't know how in the world
[1:36:20] your family could ever see it and you he
[1:36:22] didn't know what was going to happen
[1:36:26] oh but something happened
[1:36:30] as i
[1:36:32] was thinking on this thought i started
[1:36:33] to think about john there in revelations
[1:36:35] chapter 5 and there he is weeping
[1:36:39] he's crying
[1:36:41] and somebody maybe would have said to
[1:36:43] john john what happened what's wrong he
[1:36:44] said
[1:36:46] no one's worthy
[1:36:48] no one's worthy to take the book there's
[1:36:50] the book of redemption sitting in his
[1:36:52] hands on the throne and
[1:36:54] and the angels called forth who is
[1:36:56] worthy come take the book and
[1:36:58] we've looked into heaven we've looked
[1:37:00] under the earth we looked all over
[1:37:03] and there's been no one worthy found to
[1:37:04] take the book
[1:37:07] but all of a sudden there in verse 13
[1:37:10] god is praising god
[1:37:13] he's saying blessing
[1:37:15] and honor to him that liveth forever and
[1:37:19] then what happened john what changed
[1:37:21] what happened oh the lion
[1:37:23] of the tribe of judah has prevailed to
[1:37:26] take the book and loose the seven seals
[1:37:28] thereof
[1:37:31] you want to ask why we're gathered
[1:37:32] together tonight
[1:37:34] that's why
[1:37:37] we ain't a religion
[1:37:38] we ain't a denomination
[1:37:41] we've heard the shout
[1:37:45] we've heard the trump
[1:37:48] the bread of life coming
[1:37:50] that's what's changing you
[1:37:52] so now that we can believe this message

[1:37:59] i know that i'm being raptured right now

[1:44:48] jackson could just come closer
[1:45:03] today i had a
[1:45:04] laura in the family come visit me at
[1:45:06] work
[1:45:07] and i always like to show that side
[1:45:09] show my family kind of lets the
[1:45:11] guy see another side and
[1:45:13] you know then the questions come when
[1:45:15] they left me and a
[1:45:16] young man standing there and
[1:45:19] everybody had gone home and
[1:45:21] he says i i kind of noticed your wife
[1:45:24] and your daughter
[1:45:25] they had a skirt on is that for
[1:45:27] religious purposes
[1:45:29] so it always opens a door for a
[1:45:31] testimony even as matthew sharon it kind
[1:45:33] of led into the testimony and then you
[1:45:35] start to reflect back some of the things
[1:45:38] and a lot of times the testimony will
[1:45:40] start with you know at one point i had
[1:45:42] three dwis
[1:45:43] you know and you start to look back and
[1:45:45] share and what god's done for you you
[1:45:48] know every time i say that it comes out
[1:45:49] and i'm thinking
[1:45:50] man lord you've really done a lot you've
[1:45:52] really delivered me from a lot that's a
[1:45:54] that's just the start of it and then it
[1:45:56] goes more into it and um you know it's
[1:45:59] always a time for me to reflect back and
[1:46:01] it was it was right around this week
[1:46:03] that i gave my heart to the lord many
[1:46:05] years ago so every time someone preaches
[1:46:07] on a testimony you start to see what
[1:46:09] god's done and you know a lot of times
[1:46:12] we don't fully know all of our
[1:46:13] testimonies and it's nice to share and
[1:46:16] let people know where you come from and
[1:46:17] those around you so i love how you said
[1:46:19] bring to remembrance because it never
[1:46:21] gets old sharing your testimony
[1:46:23] appreciate that matthew let's pray
[1:46:26] heavenly father lord we come to you
[1:46:27] tonight
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:29] lord and even as brother matthew
[1:46:31] preached on lord there's always a
[1:46:32] remembrance
[1:46:34] lord we can look back in our own lives
[1:46:36] and we can see those around us
[1:46:38] lord but we also want to remember the
[1:46:39] cross
[1:46:41] lord and it was spoken tonight as your
[1:46:42] blood was shared lord there's a bumper
[1:46:44] there for us
[1:46:45] lord we never want to take that for
[1:46:46] granted
[1:46:48] lord as we fall more in love with you
[1:46:49] and
[1:46:50] we have a deeper revelation of your love
[1:46:52] for us
[1:46:53] lord that's when it becomes that we
[1:46:54] don't want to hurt you that's when it
[1:46:56] becomes though we don't want to let
[1:46:58] things of the past or small sins or
[1:47:00] different thoughts lord raise up within
[1:47:02] us
[1:47:03] lord we know that you've done something
[1:47:05] special
[1:47:06] lord and it wasn't just by accident
[1:47:09] lord you allowed this whole thing to
[1:47:10] play out you had these thoughts before
[1:47:12] the foundation of the world you wanted
[1:47:14] fellowship lord you wanted someone that
[1:47:16] you could love and that would love you
[1:47:18] back
[1:47:18] lord and you set a time and even allowed
[1:47:21] ages to unfold lord that we could get to
[1:47:23] the end and you could say this is what
[1:47:25] the this is the special price that i
[1:47:27] pray paid for people lord and we're
[1:47:29] manifesting that lord and we ask that
[1:47:31] you would just forgive us where we're
[1:47:32] short
[1:47:33] forgive us order when we stumble in
[1:47:35] front of one another
[1:47:36] though we don't we just want to make
[1:47:37] this a routine or a lifestyle lord but
[1:47:39] we want it to be something that's real
[1:47:41] something that can speak out
[1:47:43] lord and we want to use these
[1:47:44] opportunities at work in school and at
[1:47:46] the store that when the opportunity does
[1:47:48] come up we're able to present our
[1:47:50] testimony and what you've done
[1:47:52] lord and we may we may be even in a spot
[1:47:55] that we're not able to share much
[1:47:56] scripture but we can tell lord what
[1:47:58] you've done for us and that allows it to
[1:48:01] unfold and when somebody sees something
[1:48:02] genuine that means more to them than
[1:48:04] head knowledge lord and we thank you for
[1:48:06] the things that we heard tonight lord we
[1:48:08] always want to be in remembrance of what
[1:48:10] you've done for us lord and where we're
[1:48:12] going may we never forget that we thank
[1:48:15] you for the words that are spoken but i
[1:48:17] pray you'd be with brother matthew lord

[1:48:20] travels this weekend lord and to the
[1:48:22] young people that are there lord so many

[1:48:26] special service or time that was set
[1:48:28] aside pray lord you do something special
[1:48:31] or there's teenagers lord that need to
[1:48:33] know you better and and maybe have set
[1:48:35] on a pew lord and there's an opportunity
[1:48:37] that when that when that seed is struck
