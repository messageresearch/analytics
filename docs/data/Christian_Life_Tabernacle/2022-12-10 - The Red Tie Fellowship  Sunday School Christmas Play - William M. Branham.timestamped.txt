[11:13] good evening
[11:14] welcome
[11:17] we're all in for a surprise well I'm in
[11:19] for a surprise because I don't know
[11:20] what's happening
[11:22] which I've learned that that's a good
[11:25] thing when you're a pastor
[11:27] so we're excited tonight uh a lot of
[11:30] people put a lot of work into it a lot
[11:33] of the Sunday School teachers and the
[11:35] helpers and the kids and the parents and
[11:38] everything we won't take time to name
[11:40] them all this evening but I just think
[11:44] it's wonderful that everybody's
[11:45] participating and that it's such a
[11:48] wonderful blessing so at this time let's
[11:51] just stand together and have a word of
[11:54] prayer and just ask the Lord to bless us
[11:57] and then we'll just turn it over to the
[11:59] kids and let them have this evening to
[12:02] bless us our gracious father you are so
[12:05] wonderful
[12:06] father you have children
[12:08] Lord from all ages and you're the father
[12:11] of us all
[12:12] and we've come at this time of year Lord
[12:15] knowing that you were born with all the
[12:17] Lambs but it's a time that the world
[12:22] at least recognizes that you were born
[12:25] and we're here to celebrate your birth
[12:28] every day is a Christian a Christmas for
[12:30] a believer every day their hearts are
[12:33] full of joy that you give to all as the
[12:37] Angels said
[12:39] joy to all men and peace on Earth and
[12:42] Good Will father because you were born
[12:45] we ask you to bless this evening now and
[12:48] be with us in the Lord Jesus name we
[12:50] pray amen
[13:20] thank you
[13:32] excuse me I need to get in I'm sorry

[14:08] what's wrong with the way I'm dressed
[14:10] the Red Thai Fellowship you need a red
[14:12] tie to come in
[14:26] foreign
[14:40] that's ridiculous it's zero nobody gets
[14:44] in the red tide Fellowship without a red
[14:45] tie
[14:46] I don't have time for this I'll miss my
[14:48] meeting
[15:02] here here this ought to help you look
[15:05] the other way while I slip in you can't
[15:07] buy your way in ma'am I work for the
[15:09] richest man in town bribes mean nothing
[15:11] to me

[15:16] were Bailey blots have you forgotten who
[15:18] you are no I mean you don't know who
[15:20] you're dealing with I'm friends with the
[15:22] mayor and all the city councilmen know

[16:25] in there better than some even it's not
[16:27] 50 left
[16:28] others in and keep others out
[16:31] on the contrary arrow is the only fair
[16:33] way to let anyone in it makes everybody
[16:35] Fair since they get in by virtue of
[16:37] wearing the red tie
[16:43] me I'm much stronger than you

[18:33] because of my effort to keep the rules
[18:34] count for anything
[18:36] ma'am that rag is filthy and smelly all
[18:39] it does is your inability to abide by
[18:41] the rule your own efforts count for

[19:14] want to speak to him very well
[19:24] are you the owner my father's the owner
[19:26] I'm the manager to get you must first go
[19:29] through me
[19:31] Bailey this is Mr King the manager of
[19:34] the red tie Fellowship Mr King this is
[19:36] Miss Bailey blotz she has a complaint
[19:38] she'd like to speak with you about
[19:39] pleasure to meet some spots how can I
[19:42] help you thank you for coming out to me
[19:43] since I couldn't come where you were I'm
[19:45] happy to do it
[19:47] and that's the problem I can't seem to
[19:50] get past d-law here under any
[19:51] circumstances
[19:53] the art can be event too many at times
[19:55] but that's his job he must enforce the
[19:57] rules to the letter and keep out those
[19:59] who don't meet the requirements but I
[20:01] can't meet the requirements and I need
[20:03] to get in you you're the manager will
[20:05] you please tell him to let me in well
[20:07] Bailey I can't let someone in who don't
[20:09] meet the standards that being fair to
[20:11] those already in he did
[20:13] but you run the place you write the
[20:15] rules yes and I must stick by them
[20:18] nobody gets in the red tie Fellowship
[20:20] without a red tie how can I get one can
[20:23] you loan me one no we don't loan them
[20:25] can I pound from you you couldn't
[20:27] possibly pay what it's worth this is
[20:29] insane how does one get into your
[20:31] fellowship
[20:32] if I can't if you can't loan me one and
[20:35] I can't buy one from you or anyone else
[20:37] then what do I do you must simply ask
[20:41] ask that's all
[20:45] that's it wait a minute can't be that
[20:49] easy not not after all that these red
[20:52] ties are too costly just to be free true
[20:56] they are not free a high price just paid
[20:58] for them but I am paying it and giving
[21:00] it to those that ask as a gift
[21:12] it's too easy there must be a catch I
[21:15] don't believe it well you must believe
[21:17] it if well you must believe it if you're
[21:20] to ask and receive it otherwise you'll
[21:22] never ask if getting a tie is so easy
[21:24] why d-law here just offer me one he
[21:27] could have gotten me in right away
[21:30] Gila has no ties to give all he can do
[21:32] is tell you that you need one I'm the
[21:34] only one that can give you what you need
[21:36] to get into my fellowship to ask and you
[21:39] will receive
[21:40] don't you want to check my background
[21:42] see if I'm worthy or something your
[21:45] background doesn't matter what you mean
[21:46] it's forgotten how can you build a
[21:48] brighter future is my plan once in my
[21:51] fellowship will affect you that will
[21:53] affect the dealings with others
[21:55] sounds too good to pass up but almost
[21:57] too good to be true
[21:59] [Music]
[22:08] alright I give up may I have one of your
[22:11] red ties please I'd like to be in
[22:12] fellowship with you of course Billy but
[22:14] once in you're not just part of the
[22:15] fellowship you're part of the family
[22:18] foreign
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] this is the beginning of a wonderful
[22:24] relationship
[22:28] thanks so much now everyone will know
[22:30] I'm a part of the Great Fellowship I'll
[22:33] wear it with pride not Pride baby
[22:35] where's Joy then everyone will ask where
[22:38] you got it from and then you can
[22:39] introduce them to me they can get a red
[22:42] tie of Their Own
[22:43] that sounds great I'll do it coming in
[22:46] baby your friends are waiting
[22:50] welcome Miss Blatt enjoy
[22:53] [Music]
[23:04] that have gotten trouble they had to
[23:07] follow the cloud of Fire
[23:10] the pillar of fire that's left they
[23:13] followed that and that the church
[23:15] tonight will only follow the pillar of
[23:18] fire the Holy Spirit you'll make pain
[23:23] God has a way of providing ways
[23:26] there's two ways a man can go
[23:29] and that's his way or God's way
[23:33] and that's the right way or the wrong
[23:35] way
[23:36] and your way is always the wrong way and
[23:39] God's way is the right way and you can't
[23:42] be in your own way in God's way at the
[23:44] same time so you got to get out of your
[23:46] own way so God can have his way for you
[23:48] that's right
[23:50] God makes a provided way
