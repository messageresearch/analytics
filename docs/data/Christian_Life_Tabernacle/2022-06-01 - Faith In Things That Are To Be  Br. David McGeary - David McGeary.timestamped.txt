[37:41] this evening and
[37:43] time a great fellowship
[37:45] we ask you to be with us
[37:48] help us touch our heart encourage us and
[37:51] lift this up
[37:52] in jesus precious and wonderful name we
[37:56] pray
[37:57] amen
[37:58] amen god bless you you may be seated
[38:01] tonight and then
[38:05] i was
[38:06] looking to see where cosmonaut andrew is
[38:10] sitting is andrew with us tonight andrew
[38:12] are you here
[38:14] here he is
[38:15] i want you to come up and testify about
[38:18] going to pray for
[38:21] the sister in the hospital i just
[38:25] as he's coming
[38:26] you know
[38:29] brother andrew and brother cosman a few
[38:32] weeks ago went to pray for somebody and
[38:35] and the lord really undertook so i felt
[38:37] led on my heart i said you know why
[38:39] don't you and
[38:42] brother cosby go pray for
[38:44] sister marara
[38:46] and can you hear me sister mararan
[38:49] and uh
[38:50] so um
[38:53] and then so they went and did that and
[38:55] they i got a little text back
[38:58] uh talking how the lord worked so i just
[39:01] want him to testify of it you know some
[39:03] people have gifts you know
[39:05] and and you never know they just someone
[39:08] you might not
[39:09] think anything but yet god hears their
[39:11] prayers so
[39:12] we're just grateful for that and it's
[39:14] one of the gifts so i wanted him to
[39:16] testify before we talked a little bit
[39:18] about the word
[39:19] god bless you brother andrew tell us
[39:20] about it
[39:23] it's good to be in church tonight god
[39:24] bless you all isn't god good amen
[39:28] i
[39:29] i would always love to
[39:31] tell of his wonderful faithfulness to
[39:33] his word
[39:35] i've seen god move and
[39:38] it's just always so wonderful how that
[39:41] in situations where there's a need
[39:45] there's always
[39:46] like the scripture says deep
[39:48] calleth to the deep
[39:50] and so if we have needs there's got to
[39:53] be something to respond
[39:55] and so as we're knitted together
[39:59] as the bodies join together
[40:02] there's always a ministering whether
[40:04] you're a housewife or just a a young man
[40:07] going to school doing work it's just so
[40:10] wonderful to see the handiwork of god
[40:13] bringing us together and as we
[40:15] everyone has a part to play and so
[40:18] sometimes needs will arise
[40:20] and even in stressful situations those
[40:23] are the times where
[40:25] sometimes you don't even feel like you
[40:27] have time you don't feel like you have
[40:29] energy
[40:31] but that's when god wants to take over
[40:33] and so i just want to say that's the way
[40:35] it was when
[40:37] you know this need arised and
[40:41] i'm so grateful you know it's something
[40:44] you know there's a scripture that says
[40:46] if you delight yourself in the lord
[40:49] he'll give you the desire of your heart
[40:52] and something that i've noticed
[40:55] over the years
[40:57] i really desire to know
[41:00] a brother that's been coming here for a
[41:02] number of years
[41:03] and
[41:06] we've heard requests come through email
[41:08] and different things about his wife
[41:11] um in a great battle and
[41:15] you know sometimes it's it's in times of
[41:18] great trials
[41:19] that you really can connect with
[41:21] somebody that you can really start
[41:23] burying their burden you know that's the
[41:25] law of christ right and so
[41:28] i was able to hear of the request and
[41:31] immediately brother cosman and i
[41:33] you know we took this to prayer and and
[41:36] we were just seeking the mind of the
[41:37] lord and we've seen the hand of god
[41:40] because
[41:41] god's wanting to declare the
[41:43] supernatural to us by promise and aren't
[41:46] you thankful like what the way the
[41:48] lord's leading our pastor into the word
[41:50] of god
[41:51] to take the spiritual food because it's
[41:53] almost like as we're giving opportunity
[41:56] to take god at his word it's shaking out
[41:59] all of the uncertainty
[42:01] you know it's giving us that direct beam
[42:03] of light that we can just follow after
[42:06] and so
[42:07] as we've uh
[42:09] you know felt tasked to go into all the
[42:11] world we've seen god's faithfulness and
[42:14] so we we embrace the moment we embrace
[42:16] the opportunity we don't fear
[42:20] you know even like what we heard you
[42:22] know our lives were pre-planned by god
[42:24] so there's a place of rest for us you
[42:26] know and so we can take god at his word
[42:28] and i'll just say i'm not really
[42:31] thinking to to really testify before you
[42:34] all but i just know that you know god's
[42:37] faithful
[42:38] so so if god's made a promise real to
[42:41] you then you can take that sword that
[42:44] you've been
[42:45] equipped with and and it's from faith to
[42:48] faith so
[42:49] i just
[42:51] i was i was testifying about how that
[42:54] even in this time
[42:55] i was able to
[42:57] really get to know my brother john
[43:00] more and more and to be able to
[43:02] meet his wife and to really
[43:05] be able to bear his burden to to fit my
[43:08] feet in his shoes for a moment
[43:11] and then just watch how the lord would
[43:13] actually grab
[43:14] grab the experiences that he's brought
[43:17] us through and now it can be from faith
[43:20] to faith and the very love of christ
[43:23] that you've received now goes to work on
[43:26] behalf of somebody else and we've just
[43:28] seen the the very presence of god move
[43:31] into the room but the cosman and i just
[43:33] fellowshipping really just desiring to
[43:36] see what god has
[43:38] isn't it wonderful we don't have to
[43:39] figure anything out we just be led of
[43:42] the lord isn't that a promise of god's
[43:44] word he said sons and daughters are led
[43:46] by the spirit of god and what about an
[43:49] hour like now where everything's just
[43:52] people are starting to cool off and just
[43:54] relax but sometimes there's got to be a
[43:56] shaking to to thrust us into action and
[43:59] so i believe that's one of the things
[44:01] that's happening right now through these
[44:03] great needs in the great trials that
[44:06] that others are going through you know i
[44:07] can go through and see different ones
[44:09] but
[44:10] we were just led by the lord by the love
[44:13] in our heart to go and to fellowship
[44:15] with our brother precious brother
[44:17] they've been enduring this for
[44:19] five years and
[44:22] it's just a tremendous thing to see
[44:25] that the the countenance you know
[44:28] because that's what god does when he
[44:30] comes and shines the light it just
[44:32] changes the countenance and it really
[44:34] can invigorate so so the things that you
[44:37] go through and how god's brought you
[44:39] victory those victories are great when
[44:42] when you experience him but it's to
[44:44] actually bring you to a place where you
[44:46] can point others and actually walk with
[44:49] them to victory and so we just saw as we
[44:53] uh
[44:54] fellowship with them a bit and uh
[44:56] we we shared from our heart the word of
[44:58] god brother cosman poured his heart out
[45:01] we'd been praying and fasting and just
[45:04] seeking the will of the lord and
[45:06] i believe the lord showed up and
[45:09] our sister gladys
[45:12] she
[45:14] you know
[45:15] the scripture
[45:16] that was on my heart you know it's james
[45:19] it's a promise he says if there's any
[45:21] sick we just we just read this scripture
[45:24] and in obedience to the word of god
[45:27] we
[45:28] we became doers in that moment and as we
[45:31] prayed and
[45:32] you know we placed our hands upon her
[45:35] we got to fellowshipping after it
[45:37] because the presence came so thick
[45:40] and
[45:40] and she just testified to me that she's
[45:43] healed
[45:44] and so you know it's to the glory of god
[45:47] that we move and we breathe god has
[45:50] given us something so great and so real
[45:53] to be able to take god at his word to be
[45:56] changed to be put in service for him and
[45:58] to declare that jesus christ is the same
[46:01] yesterday today and forever i mean what
[46:03] a calling what a hope that we have and
[46:05] to be able to go in and and see our
[46:09] brother encourage
[46:12] i'm telling you it's just
[46:15] it's it gives you such peace and
[46:17] and you know you might feel you might
[46:19] feel a little bit you know the the
[46:21] pressing of your own battle and your own
[46:23] thing but oh my when you can see god use
[46:27] a situation it's a great encouragement
[46:29] so i just say god's faithful take him at
[46:32] his word and he is moving so
[46:35] praise god god bless you
[46:42] my cousin why don't you come up and kind
[46:44] of share with us the events that took
[46:46] place and
[46:48] and
[46:49] what when what went on and what happened
[46:51] from here
[46:52] thank you
[47:01] praise god
[47:08] so um
[47:11] brother david had um pulled me over on
[47:14] sunday evening and
[47:16] you know you can say how a pastor would
[47:18] just have a burden for somebody and
[47:21] you know we try to sometimes just put
[47:24] ourselves in our brother's shoes and
[47:27] just try to um
[47:32] try to maybe somewhat put ourselves in
[47:35] the condition where you're like what is
[47:37] he feeling like what can i do
[47:39] and so brother david is like hey i would
[47:41] just like for you to
[47:43] see if you can get one touch for brother
[47:44] john and just go with brother andrew and
[47:47] and just go out there and pray for
[47:49] it's just a gladys so
[47:51] brother john and and i uh texted a few
[47:54] times there was a few little
[47:56] um
[47:57] schedule maybe conflicts that he was
[48:00] working and then i was trying to get off
[48:02] of work and so
[48:03] lord willing we just decided to
[48:06] go tuesday night and so
[48:08] you know i was i was really just
[48:10] sensitive in prayer i was fasting for a
[48:12] few days and i just wanted the lord to
[48:14] move
[48:15] and i knew that
[48:17] you know because
[48:18] god put a burden on our heart
[48:21] that he would have to deliver it
[48:24] because otherwise there would be no
[48:25] burden
[48:26] and so
[48:28] you know as i'm talking to my sweet
[48:30] brother john he's such a wonderful
[48:31] brother if you guys haven't talked to
[48:32] him i i would say you
[48:34] you you talk to him after service
[48:36] because he's he's just a
[48:38] he's a wonderful brother and so
[48:40] we uh scheduled to go there around seven
[48:43] o'clock on tuesday
[48:45] and um you know right before we ended up
[48:47] going to the hospital the lord just put
[48:49] a scripture on my heart
[48:50] and it was in romans chapter 12
[48:54] and it really spoke to me because
[48:57] we have to prove god's word
[49:01] and it's not me that's the that's doing
[49:04] it but it's god that's doing it through
[49:05] us and so if we become an available
[49:07] vessel
[49:09] now god could prove himself individually
[49:12] not for my will
[49:13] but for his will
[49:15] and we know he has a perfect will
[49:17] so chapter 12 of romans it says be i
[49:20] beseech you therefore brethren
[49:22] by the mercies of god that you present
[49:24] your bodies a living sacrifice
[49:27] holy
[49:28] acceptable unto god which is your
[49:30] reasonable service
[49:32] and be not confirmed conformed to this
[49:35] world
[49:36] but ye transformed by the renewing of
[49:40] your mind that ye may prove
[49:43] what is that good
[49:45] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[49:50] and so we we go with the scripture in
[49:52] our heart and brother andrew and i were
[49:53] just kind of fellowshipping on our way
[49:55] to the hospital and
[49:57] you know a lot of supernatural things
[49:59] that happened as we were going towards
[50:01] the room and
[50:03] we didn't even pay attention to it
[50:05] and you know one of those were
[50:07] we started fellowshipping and this might
[50:09] seem really small but i i you know it's
[50:11] amazing um so we
[50:13] we we get into the elevator and brother
[50:15] john is just expressing his heart and
[50:17] we're talking and nobody presses a
[50:19] button to where to go
[50:21] i'm serious and all of a sudden we wake
[50:24] up at the 13th floor the right floor
[50:26] that we were supposed to be at
[50:28] i mean you know and so brother john's
[50:30] pressing the button you're like are we
[50:31] here like yeah yeah this is the floor oh
[50:33] okay well none of us spread you know so
[50:35] that's supernatural that's the leading
[50:37] of the lord you know we might think
[50:38] that's something small but that's just
[50:40] increasing your faith
[50:43] and so i look at andrew and i said well
[50:45] god's moving
[50:47] so
[50:48] we walk in towards the room we couldn't
[50:50] find the room but john eventually asked
[50:52] the nurse and we find a room
[50:54] and we walk in the room and you know
[50:58] sister gladys was in there and she was
[51:00] just you know on the bed and just
[51:03] trying to get comfortable and so we
[51:06] introduced ourselves and you know you
[51:07] can tell the sweetness of her heart just
[51:09] you know the struggles and the suffering
[51:11] and maybe the pain that she's been going
[51:13] through and
[51:14] you know we were just trying to
[51:15] get to know one another and just kind of
[51:17] open up the word of god well i'll tell
[51:19] you the devil was fighting
[51:22] and he was fighting very hard
[51:24] because
[51:26] i i i don't know if it was maybe 10 15
[51:29] minutes or maybe even 20 minutes but i i
[51:31] mean as soon as we walked in the room
[51:33] and we were starting to talk about the
[51:34] lord you're talking about distraction of
[51:36] the distraction you know a nurse came in
[51:39] and and wanted to do something
[51:42] and you know it was it for me it was
[51:44] just kind of
[51:46] in a place where it wasn't needed but
[51:48] they came in and asked three questions
[51:50] now those questions were just like are
[51:51] you okay do you need anything
[51:54] are you you know just like simple
[51:55] questions and as she's walking out
[51:57] another person comes in and so now we're
[51:59] you know and then ten minutes later or
[52:01] five minutes later as we're trying to
[52:03] talk um another person comes in it's
[52:05] like well we brought your dinner and so
[52:07] it's just all of these distractions and
[52:09] you can feel
[52:10] that you know
[52:12] we were trying to get into the presence
[52:14] of god as the word was just kind of
[52:16] speaking to us even to myself
[52:19] and so
[52:20] you know after a while
[52:23] the lord just settled the room and
[52:26] you know i believe that god spoke in the
[52:28] hospital room that night
[52:31] and i was telling brother andrew as we
[52:32] were coming back and i was even telling
[52:34] brother john i said you know
[52:37] um
[52:38] i believe that god's word is healing
[52:42] power
[52:43] and it's not
[52:45] my prayer
[52:46] it may be us just getting as an anointed
[52:49] vessel maybe to be before
[52:51] a service or maybe
[52:53] before an individual but if god's word
[52:56] goes forth
[52:57] that provides deliverance that provides
[53:00] the healing and that provides the
[53:02] eternal life that gives the life to the
[53:04] individual and it's that that does it
[53:07] and so that's very important as a
[53:09] believer that we always have god's word
[53:12] on our lips and so if in sincerity we
[53:15] speak that with all of our heart and we
[53:18] know that what we speak is god's word
[53:21] then there's nothing to fear brother
[53:23] david said on sunday if you speak the
[53:25] truth
[53:26] you don't have to remember it
[53:28] it's eternal
[53:30] because it'll always recognize itself
[53:32] and the individual and where it needs to
[53:33] go to
[53:34] and so
[53:35] as as
[53:37] we were fellowship and i believe for a
[53:38] good hour an hour and a half um
[53:41] in there we you know brother andrew uh
[53:44] anoints her with all we read the
[53:45] scripture and you know we started
[53:47] praying well
[53:48] um
[53:49] you know as we were just united and
[53:51] holding hands together you know the lord
[53:53] really just moved on the scene and you
[53:55] can feel
[53:57] the presence of god in that room
[54:00] and
[54:01] you know it was it was such a it was
[54:03] such an atmosphere that we wouldn't we
[54:04] didn't want to let go of our hands of
[54:06] one another and just the love and the
[54:08] peace that was in that room and you know
[54:10] sister gladys was just holding on to our
[54:12] hands me and andrew's hands real hard
[54:14] and
[54:15] and so um
[54:17] you know at the end as we get done
[54:19] praying sister gladys is just you know
[54:22] saying a prayer of faith
[54:24] at the end
[54:25] and she's just thanking the lord for
[54:27] what he's done for her
[54:28] you know she testified with her own lips
[54:31] that she was touched
[54:34] and
[54:35] right after we get them praying um you
[54:38] know i started fellowshipping with
[54:39] brother john as we were walking out of
[54:41] the room and and she looked over at
[54:43] brother andrew and she said
[54:45] you know as you guys were praying and
[54:47] and we were under the atmosphere i felt
[54:49] something inside of me and the pain that
[54:52] i had in my stomach disappeared i no
[54:55] longer feel it
[54:57] and so you know for us it was just a
[54:59] testimony and we continued to believe
[55:02] and so
[55:03] just continued to pray for her continue
[55:05] to just keep her in prayer
[55:07] continue to keep brother john in prayer
[55:09] i know he's been going through a lot and
[55:11] just a you know a lot of things that
[55:13] happens with
[55:14] situations like that when you when you
[55:16] battle a devil like that for four or
[55:18] five years it you know it's
[55:21] i can't put myself in that position
[55:23] because i haven't been through that but
[55:25] you know it's it's good for us to be
[55:27] united
[55:28] it's good for us to be one body it's
[55:30] good for us to be able to just put
[55:32] ourselves you know brother branham stood
[55:33] in the gap
[55:35] for a lot of people
[55:37] and that was the first fruit of maturity
[55:39] that came in our day
[55:41] and if we're reflecting that same light
[55:44] we can stand in the gap for somebody
[55:46] if god could use us as individuals and
[55:50] we claim that we have god's word on our
[55:52] lips when a brother or sister has a need
[55:54] we can use what god gave us which is the
[55:57] word of god and stand in the gap for a
[56:00] brother or sister and i believe that
[56:02] with all my heart and so
[56:04] um you know just like brother andrew
[56:06] said god's moving
[56:09] and
[56:10] if god's moving
[56:14] make yourself an available vessel
[56:17] amen god bless you
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:25] i don't know
[56:27] brother john are you here tonight by any
[56:29] chance no
[56:31] i didn't know sometimes he makes it out
[56:32] on wednesday
[56:34] where are you ready
[56:36] brother john you hide from me
[56:38] i want you to say something
[56:40] never let us know that the people will
[56:43] know what gladys has been going through
[56:45] and how god's been blessing you amen
[56:49] thank you
[57:00] yeah i'm sure i never started before
[57:02] many people before
[57:03] but
[57:04] i feel encouraged to say something
[57:07] just a little thing like
[57:09] before we even started praying or
[57:12] praising god in that room
[57:14] the presence of the lord was there
[57:16] when i spoke or the brother over the
[57:19] phone
[57:20] i could feel some push
[57:22] that means
[57:24] it was wonderful i've never had that
[57:26] experience before
[57:28] i was kind of
[57:29] like losing hope
[57:31] exhausting embarrassed but after those
[57:34] prayers
[57:35] and after meeting with the brothers i
[57:37] just felt encouraged
[57:39] and right now i'm very encouraged god
[57:41] bless you
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:50] so
[57:51] brother john now sister gladys has been
[57:54] battling what
[57:59] yeah but it's what cancer
[58:08] okay
[58:10] so she's been battling cancer and
[58:13] and uh
[58:14] and so um
[58:16] we just know that when the believers put
[58:18] their shoulder to the wheel it don't
[58:20] matter what it is yeah i don't care what
[58:24] what label you put on what the enemy's
[58:27] doing
[58:28] you know he tries to come in a lot of
[58:30] different names
[58:32] but his own name
[58:33] and that which is satan and so we just
[58:37] think that's wonderful so i mean let's
[58:39] stand to just read a few scriptures
[58:41] tonight
[58:42] just have a
[58:43] um
[58:45] just a little short
[58:49] time in the lord so let's just start in
[58:52] the
[58:53] right in the beginning of our bible
[58:56] because this is where
[58:58] everything starts right here
[59:04] or this is the record of where it began
[59:06] to start we know it started in him
[59:10] but this is what he says in genesis 1 1
[59:12] he says in the beginning god created the
[59:15] heavens and the earth
[59:19] and
[59:20] and
[59:22] and the earth was without form and void
[59:26] and darkness was upon the face of the
[59:29] earth
[59:30] and the spirit of god moved
[59:34] upon the face of the waters
[59:37] and god said let there
[59:39] be light
[59:41] and there
[59:42] was
[59:43] light
[59:44] and let's just
[59:47] go over to
[59:48] um
[59:52] the gospel of saint john
[59:54] and we'll read
[59:56] in the gospel of saint john
[1:00:03] and one in five
[1:00:06] so we're just
[1:00:09] and it says here it was a worried one
[1:00:11] through five
[1:00:13] of the gospel of saint john in the
[1:00:15] beginning was the word
[1:00:18] and the word was with god
[1:00:20] and the word was god
[1:00:23] and the same was in the beginning
[1:00:26] with god so the word was in the
[1:00:29] beginning with god all things were made
[1:00:32] by him
[1:00:34] and without him was not anything made
[1:00:37] that
[1:00:38] was made
[1:00:40] and in him was life
[1:00:42] and the life was the light of men
[1:00:45] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:00:48] the darkness comprehendeth it
[1:00:51] not
[1:00:52] and then we'd also like to continue
[1:00:56] internal over the saint
[1:01:04] the 14th chapter of the gospel of saint
[1:01:07] john
[1:01:08] and
[1:01:18] and it says here in the gospel of saint
[1:01:21] john the 14th chapter
[1:01:23] it says let not your hearts be troubled
[1:01:28] believe ye and god
[1:01:30] believe also
[1:01:32] in me
[1:01:37] in my father's house
[1:01:39] are many mansions
[1:01:41] if it were not so i would not have told
[1:01:45] you
[1:01:46] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:01:50] and if i go to prayer prepare a place
[1:01:53] for you
[1:01:54] i will come again
[1:01:56] and
[1:01:57] receive you
[1:01:58] unto myself
[1:02:00] that where i am
[1:02:02] there ye may
[1:02:04] be
[1:02:05] also
[1:02:07] amen and whither i go you know
[1:02:10] and the way
[1:02:12] you know
[1:02:13] and thomas said unto him lord
[1:02:17] we
[1:02:18] know not whether thou goest
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:22] and how
[1:02:23] can we know the way
[1:02:26] jesus said i am
[1:02:28] the way
[1:02:29] the truth the life
[1:02:31] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:02:35] and then we'll read our last scripture
[1:02:38] found in the book of revelations
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:50] and in revelations the first chapter
[1:02:56] we'd like to read
[1:02:59] there
[1:03:03] and we'd like to read the one through
[1:03:05] the seventh verse
[1:03:07] in the book of revelations and the
[1:03:09] revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:03:12] gave unto him
[1:03:14] to show unto his servant things which
[1:03:16] much shortly must come to pass
[1:03:19] and he sent
[1:03:21] and signified it by his angel unto his
[1:03:24] servant john
[1:03:26] who bore record of the word of god
[1:03:30] and of the testimony of jesus christ
[1:03:34] and of all things that he saw
[1:03:37] blessed is he that readeth
[1:03:40] and
[1:03:41] and they that hear
[1:03:43] the words of this prophecy
[1:03:45] and who keep those things
[1:03:48] which are written
[1:03:50] wherein
[1:03:51] for the time is at hand
[1:03:54] and john
[1:03:56] in the seven church ages
[1:03:58] which were in eight john to the seven
[1:04:01] church ages which are in asia
[1:04:03] grace be unto you
[1:04:05] and peace
[1:04:07] from him
[1:04:08] which is
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:10] which was
[1:04:12] and which is to come
[1:04:14] and from the seven spirits
[1:04:17] which were before him
[1:04:20] and his throne
[1:04:22] and from john and from jesus christ who
[1:04:26] is the
[1:04:27] faithful witness
[1:04:29] and is the first
[1:04:32] to begotten and who it was the first
[1:04:35] begotten
[1:04:36] from the dead
[1:04:37] and was the prince of the kings of the
[1:04:40] earth
[1:04:41] unto him that loveth us
[1:04:44] and washed us of our sins
[1:04:47] and from
[1:04:48] our own
[1:04:50] blood
[1:04:51] by
[1:04:52] our sins by his own blood
[1:04:54] and
[1:04:55] and he was made as king
[1:04:58] and priest
[1:05:00] in the kingdom of the father
[1:05:02] unto the glory and dominion
[1:05:05] of his son
[1:05:06] behold he that cometh in the cloud
[1:05:09] and every eye shall see
[1:05:12] and every
[1:05:14] uh shall
[1:05:16] and they which also pierced him
[1:05:19] and all the kings of the earth
[1:05:22] and the shall well
[1:05:25] because of him
[1:05:27] even saith the amen
[1:05:29] i am
[1:05:31] the alpha in omega
[1:05:33] the beginning and the end saith the lord
[1:05:37] which is
[1:05:39] and which is
[1:05:41] and which was
[1:05:42] and which
[1:05:45] it is
[1:05:46] to come
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:48] almighty heavenly father we ask you to
[1:05:51] bless your word
[1:05:52] in your precious name we pray
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:57] god bless you may be seated
[1:06:02] and we just
[1:06:04] wanted to read those scriptures because
[1:06:06] i think it's so
[1:06:08] beautiful
[1:06:10] when
[1:06:11] we're able to
[1:06:14] place our faith
[1:06:17] in the great
[1:06:19] plan of god
[1:06:21] and you know and
[1:06:28] when we
[1:06:31] as christians can
[1:06:33] move pl past
[1:06:35] you know
[1:06:36] you you've got that
[1:06:38] you've got
[1:06:39] uh
[1:06:41] saved and
[1:06:43] we're not just saved because if i i
[1:06:47] kind of just want to approach this for a
[1:06:49] couple of moments
[1:06:51] it says you've got to
[1:06:54] you have to get saved
[1:06:56] or
[1:06:58] or you're gonna go to hell
[1:07:01] you know that's kind of the attitude so
[1:07:03] many times that people
[1:07:06] uh place towards salvation is if you're
[1:07:08] not saved you're going to go to the bad
[1:07:12] place
[1:07:13] and you know that and i i believe our
[1:07:15] salvation is it has lifted us way past
[1:07:19] those things
[1:07:20] amen is that we're it where is in and
[1:07:24] we're not christians and
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:28] and if we don't get saved if you don't
[1:07:31] get saved you're going to go to the bad
[1:07:34] place so our life isn't a life
[1:07:38] to avoid
[1:07:40] something
[1:07:41] that
[1:07:43] is
[1:07:45] negatively
[1:07:46] approaching us or from the standpoint
[1:07:50] like hell is what everybody's going to
[1:07:53] get that
[1:07:54] don't believe
[1:07:57] well
[1:07:58] if we could
[1:08:00] kind of step into it
[1:08:02] in a greater light we're not saved to
[1:08:05] avoid
[1:08:08] hell
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:12] that's not what our approach is and
[1:08:16] where our approach
[1:08:18] is
[1:08:19] and uh
[1:08:21] so
[1:08:22] as we
[1:08:24] as we look at this if we could say
[1:08:27] you know
[1:08:28] christianity
[1:08:30] isn't based on avoiding hell
[1:08:35] and that's what a lot of people's
[1:08:37] approach is
[1:08:39] and that's their viewpoint on but i
[1:08:41] believe christianity is higher because
[1:08:45] christianity isn't avoiding hell it's
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:49] it's the revelation
[1:08:51] of of your purpose
[1:08:54] in god
[1:08:56] and so
[1:08:57] that's what
[1:09:01] our
[1:09:03] faith is
[1:09:05] wants to be and and
[1:09:07] what we want to
[1:09:10] rest in is an understanding and new
[1:09:13] approach
[1:09:15] that we're not living
[1:09:19] to avoid hell
[1:09:21] but for us as christians we begin to
[1:09:24] understand
[1:09:26] that it's the revelation of
[1:09:29] the of our purpose
[1:09:33] in him
[1:09:34] and the understanding that we had a
[1:09:37] purpose in him
[1:09:40] before
[1:09:41] eat the foundations of the world
[1:09:45] and if we have eternal life so
[1:09:48] our our our our faith
[1:09:52] isn't uh if i could say this
[1:09:56] a faith
[1:09:58] of
[1:09:59] uh
[1:10:01] that looking for what
[1:10:04] for what
[1:10:06] uh our faith isn't of faith like i've
[1:10:08] said it's not a faith or a faith in the
[1:10:12] teaching or faith in jesus that we're
[1:10:15] not going to go to hell
[1:10:17] that that's not our faith faith
[1:10:19] christianity isn't the faith if we
[1:10:22] believe and do these things we won't go
[1:10:25] to hell
[1:10:26] in other words but if we we can look
[1:10:29] for
[1:10:32] when we have faith
[1:10:34] we look
[1:10:35] for
[1:10:36] something that's beyond that because
[1:10:39] faith looks for
[1:10:41] what
[1:10:43] what his will will be
[1:10:46] or faith looks for what
[1:10:48] if i cannot if i could say this
[1:10:50] what
[1:10:52] will
[1:10:54] be
[1:10:56] okay not not a will
[1:10:59] in the fact that
[1:11:01] we're we're sitting what's his will or
[1:11:04] what his will but his will
[1:11:07] raises us up to the place that faith
[1:11:11] looks is looking
[1:11:13] for what will be
[1:11:16] or what is the hid hidden
[1:11:20] and revealed
[1:11:22] so if there's a
[1:11:24] hidden will
[1:11:27] for our life as we get there so
[1:11:30] if if faith looks for
[1:11:33] a hidden will
[1:11:35] but
[1:11:36] or
[1:11:37] what his will be or what is hid
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:44] revealed
[1:11:46] so
[1:11:46] there's something that god
[1:11:50] has planned
[1:11:52] for our life he's got a plan for our
[1:11:56] life and faith seeks that and and it
[1:12:00] looks at it and and and what is
[1:12:04] hid
[1:12:05] and and his head from the wise and
[1:12:08] prudent
[1:12:09] but it's delivered unto us
[1:12:12] and so as we become christians it's not
[1:12:16] that oh i'm trying to avoid the bad
[1:12:19] place and oh or i've got to live right
[1:12:23] or i'm going to go to hell
[1:12:25] and and uh i i'm so worried about doing
[1:12:29] wrong but with our faith raises up we
[1:12:33] our faith begins to seek
[1:12:36] for the will that god has
[1:12:40] for our life
[1:12:42] that he has a will
[1:12:45] for our life he has a purpose for our
[1:12:48] life he has something that
[1:12:53] that is
[1:12:57] spoken there's a will that spoken for us
[1:13:02] and we're trying to find
[1:13:05] that will and i'd like to uh
[1:13:08] uh
[1:13:09] kind of if i could just let's just jump
[1:13:12] over to the book of revelations again
[1:13:17] i think we did
[1:13:18] revelations the first chapter
[1:13:22] and um
[1:13:24] the book of reverend the first chapter
[1:13:26] and it says in the
[1:13:28] and in the rebel
[1:13:30] he says the revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:35] which god gave unto him
[1:13:39] to
[1:13:41] that god
[1:13:42] gave unto him
[1:13:44] to show to a servant
[1:13:48] the show does
[1:13:52] he gave to show
[1:13:54] unto his servant the things which might
[1:13:56] shortly come to pass
[1:13:59] and he sent and signify it by his angel
[1:14:03] which is his servant to his servant john
[1:14:08] and bear record of the word of the
[1:14:11] kingdom
[1:14:12] and the testimony of jesus christ which
[1:14:16] all things he saw
[1:14:18] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:14:22] heareth the words of the prophecy
[1:14:25] and keepeth these things which are
[1:14:28] written
[1:14:29] from the
[1:14:30] from the first added
[1:14:34] wherein is written for the time is at
[1:14:36] hand
[1:14:38] and john
[1:14:39] to the servant of the churches which are
[1:14:42] in ages grace be unto you
[1:14:45] and peace from him
[1:14:48] and from which
[1:14:49] was in which is to come and from the
[1:14:52] seventh spirits
[1:14:54] which are before
[1:14:56] his throne
[1:14:58] and he from the spirit of of jesus which
[1:15:02] is
[1:15:05] which
[1:15:06] which were
[1:15:08] from
[1:15:09] jesus christ who is the faithful true
[1:15:12] witness
[1:15:13] the first and the and the first begotten
[1:15:16] of the dead the prince of the kingdom of
[1:15:19] his
[1:15:20] of of this earth
[1:15:22] which is which that loveth
[1:15:25] and with watched us from our sins i got
[1:15:29] a lot of things and i'm not law like you
[1:15:31] might think i am
[1:15:33] i'm i'm
[1:15:34] trying to
[1:15:35] find this uh what was revealed
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:39] in him
[1:15:40] that love us and washed us from our sins
[1:15:44] by his blood and who hath made us kings
[1:15:48] and priests with
[1:15:50] him in the in the father
[1:15:53] and the glory of the dominion and the
[1:15:55] power forever
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:59] and so
[1:16:00] we know that he's the beginning
[1:16:03] and the end
[1:16:05] so we're going to talk a little bit
[1:16:07] about what our faith is anchored in
[1:16:11] so we know
[1:16:12] what
[1:16:14] was
[1:16:16] and what was in the beginning
[1:16:18] and what the beginning was
[1:16:20] god said that in the beginning
[1:16:24] was the word
[1:16:26] and the word was with god
[1:16:29] and he created
[1:16:30] all things and all things
[1:16:33] were created by him
[1:16:36] so
[1:16:37] if we could catch just the way
[1:16:40] that it's on our heart
[1:16:43] there's things that are to be
[1:16:46] so uh our faith is a looking
[1:16:51] for the things
[1:16:53] that are
[1:16:55] to be
[1:16:56] right so our faith looks for what will
[1:17:00] be
[1:17:02] or what is hid
[1:17:04] and
[1:17:05] what is going to be
[1:17:09] revealed
[1:17:10] so if i we just just said on that that
[1:17:13] just for a moment
[1:17:15] so our faith is looking
[1:17:18] for the things that
[1:17:21] are to be
[1:17:22] so
[1:17:24] faith is the revelation of things hope
[1:17:27] for
[1:17:28] not yet things but what the things
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:34] will be
[1:17:35] so things to be
[1:17:37] so now so if we could
[1:17:41] look past the idea that my faith
[1:17:45] is i believe in
[1:17:48] the
[1:17:49] what was revealed or i believe in
[1:17:52] revelation
[1:17:53] and i believe like like like a doctrinal
[1:17:57] revelation
[1:17:58] i believe the things that were hidden i
[1:18:01] believe but faith moves past that
[1:18:05] because faith is looking for
[1:18:09] what the will of god for my life
[1:18:13] is
[1:18:14] so good not of faith just in the word
[1:18:18] so that's faith i believe in god's word
[1:18:21] i believe that he's got something for my
[1:18:23] life and we we begin to look what what
[1:18:27] is going to transpire
[1:18:31] and what is revealed what has been
[1:18:34] spoken that is going to transpire and
[1:18:37] what will those things be
[1:18:40] in my life shortly
[1:18:43] and so i'd like again
[1:18:45] if we just take a moment to look at this
[1:18:48] great thing in the
[1:18:51] as we understand what are the things
[1:18:55] that are to be
[1:18:57] what things that are
[1:19:00] to be and that's when i want to set my
[1:19:03] life in
[1:19:04] and my faith in
[1:19:06] and so he he speaks of these things
[1:19:10] and
[1:19:12] and uh
[1:19:16] and if we could look here
[1:19:18] in the uh
[1:19:20] the message things that are
[1:19:23] to be
[1:19:24] and if we could just go quickly
[1:19:28] to
[1:19:30] paragraph 22
[1:19:32] uh
[1:19:36] and it says god was was in christ
[1:19:40] and was reconciled
[1:19:42] the world to himself
[1:19:44] and it was easy for those jews who had
[1:19:47] been taught
[1:19:48] through generations to believe
[1:19:51] that there was a great supernatural god
[1:19:55] and to think that god had come down
[1:19:58] and was manifesting himself
[1:20:01] through the person
[1:20:03] of his son jesus christ in the tavern
[1:20:07] that god tabernick
[1:20:09] tabernacled
[1:20:11] in
[1:20:12] the body of flesh
[1:20:14] and was
[1:20:16] was a little too much for them
[1:20:19] to understand
[1:20:22] and so here's somebody that's in the
[1:20:25] beginning and he said when you see my
[1:20:28] life ending
[1:20:30] my life is ending
[1:20:32] from the
[1:20:33] it's ending for a purpose
[1:20:36] that i'm going away
[1:20:38] to prepare a place
[1:20:41] for you
[1:20:43] that
[1:20:44] place
[1:20:45] place for you
[1:20:47] that where i am
[1:20:49] where you may be also
[1:20:52] jesus therefore is
[1:20:54] telling his disciples his life is not
[1:20:58] going it's not
[1:21:01] that
[1:21:02] his sabbath his life is not ending
[1:21:06] in
[1:21:07] death
[1:21:08] so it it it it goes
[1:21:11] beyond that
[1:21:12] so if his life wasn't ending in the
[1:21:15] death that his life had a purpose
[1:21:19] and now we could go over here and
[1:21:21] and he makes this a statement
[1:21:24] in paragraph
[1:21:26] 31.
[1:21:28] and this he says something beautiful
[1:21:31] thing
[1:21:32] and he says
[1:21:36] he says therefore we knew
[1:21:39] this is uh
[1:21:40] just the at the end of paragraph 28
[1:21:44] he said
[1:21:45] therefore we
[1:21:48] we knew that jesus
[1:21:51] was gone to prepare
[1:21:53] a place
[1:21:54] and receive his people
[1:21:57] and those people who
[1:21:59] are in hope
[1:22:02] it's the thing that that those people
[1:22:05] tonight
[1:22:06] it isn't my friend that god
[1:22:09] made a way
[1:22:13] and a condition
[1:22:14] that you can
[1:22:16] that you can be included
[1:22:18] if you want to
[1:22:21] you are a free moral agent
[1:22:24] and you've got you
[1:22:26] act the way you wish to
[1:22:28] but if you notice
[1:22:31] now
[1:22:33] in this world
[1:22:36] is to come there is a world to come
[1:22:42] and like like your birth
[1:22:46] here
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] i say you
[1:22:49] it was prepared god knew you would be
[1:22:53] here
[1:22:54] now when you
[1:22:57] when you even
[1:23:01] when you
[1:23:02] even things that your parents done
[1:23:05] people think that it isn't it's fitted
[1:23:08] from generation but it is
[1:23:11] now i want this reason i'm reading this
[1:23:14] because i want to say something
[1:23:15] that
[1:23:17] settles a little question that hangs
[1:23:20] over in the book of
[1:23:22] hebrews
[1:23:23] i believe in the seventh chapter
[1:23:26] speaking
[1:23:27] paul writing i believe it was
[1:23:30] was speaking on this great event that
[1:23:33] was to take place with abraham
[1:23:36] and he paid thai state to melchizedek
[1:23:39] when he was returning from the slaughter
[1:23:42] of the king
[1:23:44] and
[1:23:45] and now he said
[1:23:47] levi was in the loins of abraham
[1:23:50] and and meant abraham coming from the
[1:23:54] slaughter of the kings and he recognized
[1:23:56] levi paid ties when he was in the loins
[1:24:01] abraham this was his great grand
[1:24:04] father
[1:24:06] and he visits sins
[1:24:09] of people upon their children
[1:24:12] from generation to generation that won't
[1:24:15] keep his word
[1:24:17] now
[1:24:18] a lot of people
[1:24:20] get
[1:24:21] hung there because
[1:24:23] they are wondering does what my parents
[1:24:27] do
[1:24:28] is the evil that my parents done
[1:24:32] visited on to me
[1:24:36] and we look at that so many times as
[1:24:39] something that's personal
[1:24:45] and we sit back and say
[1:24:47] that
[1:24:48] is is it uh are the sins
[1:24:51] the sins of the
[1:24:53] this
[1:24:54] and he visits the sins
[1:24:56] of the people upon their children from
[1:25:01] generation to generation
[1:25:03] that
[1:25:04] won't
[1:25:05] uh keep his word
[1:25:07] but you got to remember in in romans 5
[1:25:11] and 8 and i just want to hold look at
[1:25:15] that
[1:25:16] just so you can
[1:25:17] like there's a rest there
[1:25:20] um
[1:25:21] and it says in romans 5 and 8
[1:25:24] but god
[1:25:26] can
[1:25:27] commendeth his love towards us
[1:25:30] in that while we were yet sinners christ
[1:25:35] died for us amen
[1:25:37] so we we we he's talking about
[1:25:42] the reason this is visited upon their
[1:25:44] children because they didn't love god
[1:25:47] and the things that they do their
[1:25:50] children are brought up in those things
[1:25:53] and it appears that there's a judgment
[1:25:57] put upon him but this is what he says he
[1:26:00] says no it's not
[1:26:02] visited in that way
[1:26:05] because god so condemned this
[1:26:08] commanded his love
[1:26:10] towards us
[1:26:12] that while we were yet sinners
[1:26:16] he died for us
[1:26:18] and so when we go look at that
[1:26:20] a little further he makes this statement
[1:26:24] you were all pre
[1:26:26] you were all pre-planned by god
[1:26:30] nothing happens by chance
[1:26:33] with god
[1:26:35] he knows all about it it's all
[1:26:37] pre-planned
[1:26:39] pre-planned many generations back
[1:26:43] for that you could be here tonight did
[1:26:47] you know that
[1:26:49] just think that
[1:26:52] you at one time
[1:26:54] uh
[1:26:55] and i'll repeat it again
[1:26:58] you at one time were in your
[1:27:01] father in a gene in your father and he
[1:27:04] didn't know you at that time
[1:27:08] neither did he know
[1:27:10] did you
[1:27:12] neither did you know him
[1:27:14] at that time
[1:27:16] but see you were in
[1:27:21] the bedding ground and and in the womb
[1:27:24] of mother the holy wedlock and then you
[1:27:27] became a person expressed in the image
[1:27:32] like your father
[1:27:34] was here
[1:27:36] like your father
[1:27:37] and then you and there was
[1:27:41] fellowship
[1:27:42] and so
[1:27:43] if if that's pre-planned i
[1:27:46] i want to
[1:27:48] just say
[1:27:50] something else before as we go on
[1:27:53] and this is in paragraph
[1:27:55] uh back in page 14 right at the end of
[1:27:58] paragraph
[1:27:59] 49
[1:28:00] he says
[1:28:03] he says but the father
[1:28:05] knew
[1:28:06] that you would be here
[1:28:09] and prepared everything for you before
[1:28:12] you got here amen
[1:28:15] and first
[1:28:18] in your first
[1:28:20] your first coming here
[1:28:23] he had all everything ready for you when
[1:28:27] you got here isn't it marvelous
[1:28:30] think what he's done
[1:28:33] and he says now
[1:28:35] so
[1:28:37] when we begin to
[1:28:38] set our
[1:28:40] our faith there and we begin to realize
[1:28:44] that
[1:28:45] everything was uh
[1:28:48] pre-planned for us and that he prepared
[1:28:52] everything for us
[1:28:54] so if our life has been pre-planned
[1:28:58] and we've been predestinated
[1:29:02] and and so therefore there's got to be
[1:29:05] something that
[1:29:07] has been laid out for us
[1:29:10] that's be pre-planned for us there's a
[1:29:13] life that's prepared forth and so our
[1:29:17] faith isn't a faith that's
[1:29:20] built on survival
[1:29:22] and our faith is in a faith that's that
[1:29:26] built on trying to avoid hell our faith
[1:29:30] is
[1:29:31] looking for in others our faith is built
[1:29:34] that there's a revelation that our
[1:29:38] life has something that was pre-planned
[1:29:42] by god that i'm trying to find
[1:29:45] that's what i'm looking for
[1:29:48] that's what i'm trusting in
[1:29:51] that's what my my faith is
[1:29:54] because
[1:29:56] uh
[1:29:58] you know
[1:29:59] there's
[1:30:00] things
[1:30:01] that are
[1:30:03] to be
[1:30:05] i i'm
[1:30:06] i'm talking about so if i can i
[1:30:10] understand where i am in the lord i
[1:30:13] understand who that i am in the lord
[1:30:16] and then i understand that my life is
[1:30:19] pre-planned
[1:30:20] by the lord then why wouldn't my faith
[1:30:24] look
[1:30:26] for
[1:30:28] the will
[1:30:29] and the calling
[1:30:33] that i have
[1:30:36] okay so
[1:30:37] if i can start looking for that
[1:30:41] and and start sitting back and
[1:30:43] understanding
[1:30:45] my life
[1:30:47] is not and my faith
[1:30:50] isn't
[1:30:51] the faith
[1:30:53] of just oh i've got
[1:30:55] to keep his word
[1:30:58] like a commandment sure but how about if
[1:31:01] it comes to the place
[1:31:03] my life has to keep his word
[1:31:07] because i'm
[1:31:09] predestinated to
[1:31:11] keep his word i have a life that's going
[1:31:15] to keep his word
[1:31:17] he's using me and he's called me still
[1:31:21] because he's going to use me to prove
[1:31:24] his word
[1:31:25] and so it's not a negative standpoint
[1:31:28] like i'm missing something but it
[1:31:30] becomes a revelation in my heart to seek
[1:31:34] something
[1:31:37] i'm going to seek
[1:31:41] what his will
[1:31:42] was or i'm going to find it
[1:31:46] or even better than an empty search
[1:31:51] i have been
[1:31:53] called
[1:31:55] to find
[1:31:58] the will of the lord
[1:32:01] and i like this
[1:32:04] and you know and i thought this brought
[1:32:07] it out beautiful
[1:32:11] he said i
[1:32:13] i said
[1:32:14] any
[1:32:15] and this is in
[1:32:17] around paragraph 74 of
[1:32:21] things that are to be
[1:32:25] he said
[1:32:29] i said any minister
[1:32:32] that the word of god will
[1:32:34] will ruin
[1:32:35] ought to be ruined
[1:32:37] that's right certainly and he said well
[1:32:41] you're you're going to ruin it
[1:32:44] and he said
[1:32:46] and i said
[1:32:47] who is going to tell them you know in
[1:32:51] other words what people are telling
[1:32:53] people brother brahma you're going to
[1:32:54] ruin your ministry
[1:32:57] you know what i mean if you preach these
[1:32:59] things and these things you're going to
[1:33:01] ruin this ministry well he didn't really
[1:33:04] that man didn't understand that
[1:33:07] were the ministry of brotherhood
[1:33:10] he said
[1:33:12] he says i said well who's going to
[1:33:15] to tell
[1:33:17] to tell
[1:33:18] it then
[1:33:20] see somebody has got to say it
[1:33:24] somebody has got to stand
[1:33:27] for
[1:33:29] for that what's truth
[1:33:31] no matter what it who it hurts
[1:33:36] and friend as a christian
[1:33:38] as people i've
[1:33:40] to believe we're going to heaven and the
[1:33:44] holy spirit itself is a type
[1:33:47] to us in the word of god
[1:33:50] and he said i know
[1:33:52] what you
[1:33:53] he said i know what you ought to do
[1:33:57] he said people believe you to be a
[1:33:59] prophet
[1:34:00] said you ought to teach these women
[1:34:05] how to get gifts and prophesy and things
[1:34:09] like that and the great higher things
[1:34:13] instead of little things
[1:34:16] and i said how am i going to teach them
[1:34:19] algebra
[1:34:20] when they won't even learn their abcs
[1:34:24] when they won't even do the common
[1:34:28] things see
[1:34:30] the natural things how are you going to
[1:34:33] teach them high things
[1:34:36] you know
[1:34:38] and
[1:34:39] when you won't even start
[1:34:42] from
[1:34:44] from what we get
[1:34:46] on the if we won't even start from
[1:34:51] you want to get to the top of the ladder
[1:34:54] before you hit the first
[1:34:57] first wrong you know he said it
[1:35:01] that's the reason you fall
[1:35:04] he says
[1:35:06] beginning at the bottom
[1:35:08] and climbing up as god leads you up
[1:35:13] see you you see
[1:35:15] cope your life
[1:35:18] and ever
[1:35:19] and
[1:35:20] and follow every
[1:35:22] word bit of god's word
[1:35:25] god has ordained you to do it
[1:35:29] and so
[1:35:30] you know
[1:35:37] you know
[1:35:38] how can i say this to you but people
[1:35:41] think well i've got to reach these
[1:35:43] places in my life i've got to get to
[1:35:46] these different places like there's a
[1:35:48] part of christianity
[1:35:50] that
[1:35:52] you're going to earn
[1:35:54] or achieve
[1:35:57] a higher level of christianity if i fast
[1:36:00] more i do this more or if i you know
[1:36:04] it but if we would just
[1:36:07] understand
[1:36:10] that god's got a plan for our life
[1:36:13] he's he's already pre-planned our life
[1:36:17] he knows exactly how to get us there and
[1:36:20] he's going to lead us to it
[1:36:23] but if we could just understand that
[1:36:31] it's all settled
[1:36:33] it's pre-planned
[1:36:34] and i'm going to look for
[1:36:37] and he's going to lead me
[1:36:42] to what it is
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:46] he has
[1:36:47] from the beginning
[1:36:51] had in his mind
[1:36:54] for my life
[1:36:56] and and that's why this message is so
[1:37:02] far above religion
[1:37:06] it's the revelation
[1:37:10] of what god had in mind
[1:37:14] for you
[1:37:18] it becomes so personal
[1:37:20] it isn't a study of doctrines and
[1:37:24] principles and mysteries and
[1:37:28] and this but it is the revelation of the
[1:37:31] word but it's not the revelation of the
[1:37:34] word of something that's outside of you
[1:37:38] that's being shown to you
[1:37:40] it's a revelation of the understanding
[1:37:44] that you were in the thoughts of god he
[1:37:47] had a pre-planned life for you it's a
[1:37:51] redemption
[1:37:54] or
[1:37:55] right a redemption
[1:37:58] it's a coming back to her
[1:38:00] uh beginning to understand
[1:38:03] what you were
[1:38:05] in him
[1:38:07] in the beginning
[1:38:08] and so it doesn't become
[1:38:12] any more
[1:38:13] of finding out of doctrines and
[1:38:16] revelations and doctrines going to make
[1:38:20] me climb this ladder
[1:38:23] and have more faith
[1:38:25] no
[1:38:26] it's you were there already in him
[1:38:31] but he's now revealing
[1:38:36] things to us
[1:38:38] not the revelation until we know who we
[1:38:42] are but not the revelations going
[1:38:46] to give us
[1:38:47] some sort of
[1:38:52] how can i say it secret or some sort of
[1:38:55] method of working things
[1:39:00] but it's absolutely
[1:39:02] starting to build our faith
[1:39:05] that there is a pre-planned
[1:39:09] life
[1:39:11] for me
[1:39:14] i'm i'm it that's what i'm looking for
[1:39:17] i'm looking for what that i always
[1:39:21] was in him
[1:39:25] not a clone
[1:39:28] you know this thing that if we can all
[1:39:31] come to it
[1:39:32] nobody can come
[1:39:35] to what you are
[1:39:37] but you
[1:39:39] nobody can take your place nobody can
[1:39:43] it's not a revelation that i have that
[1:39:46] you have to get also
[1:39:49] it isn't a
[1:39:50] a teachings of brother branham that
[1:39:54] we can
[1:39:56] be real revelated to
[1:39:59] and then we can understand things that
[1:40:03] we never un
[1:40:05] understood before it's the revelation of
[1:40:08] jesus christ but i was in him
[1:40:14] from the beginning
[1:40:17] so
[1:40:18] i'm not looking for the uh to find out
[1:40:22] all about him that i can
[1:40:26] everything he was and and all that made
[1:40:29] him work and who he was in the beginning
[1:40:34] i'm trying to find out who i was in the
[1:40:37] beginning
[1:40:39] that's the plan i'm looking for i'm
[1:40:42] looking for the plan that he had for
[1:40:46] my life
[1:40:49] that i can manifest and be what he
[1:40:52] wanted me to be and it's here
[1:40:58] and it is in this word
[1:41:02] so it changes my faith
[1:41:06] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[1:41:09] for not yet seen
[1:41:12] it's a revelation
[1:41:14] and now i begin to understand that i'm
[1:41:18] not looking
[1:41:20] for power
[1:41:23] or deliverance
[1:41:27] if
[1:41:28] sickness
[1:41:30] is keeping me
[1:41:33] from seeing who i am
[1:41:37] then i don't want it
[1:41:39] then i want it defeated
[1:41:42] not only off of me
[1:41:43] but off of anybody else
[1:41:48] but when i can come to this
[1:41:49] understanding
[1:41:51] that
[1:41:52] that
[1:41:53] he's alpha and omega that he's the
[1:41:56] beginning
[1:41:59] and
[1:42:00] the end
[1:42:02] and and
[1:42:03] so i'm not
[1:42:05] looking for uh to try
[1:42:07] to obtain
[1:42:09] power
[1:42:14] healing power
[1:42:16] deliverance power
[1:42:18] the power to
[1:42:19] cast out devils i'm i'm that's not
[1:42:23] what it is
[1:42:26] that i'm trying to obtain
[1:42:31] i want to obtain what it is that he
[1:42:35] wants me to be
[1:42:38] what was it lord
[1:42:42] that you
[1:42:44] had with me
[1:42:47] in the beginning
[1:42:50] what fellowship
[1:42:53] did i have with you as he said
[1:42:57] well i was yet in
[1:43:01] the
[1:43:02] the father
[1:43:06] like he said you were a son you were in
[1:43:08] your father you didn't know him he
[1:43:11] didn't know you but you were there and
[1:43:14] then you could come and you could have
[1:43:17] fellowship with him as a father and son
[1:43:21] well that if it's that personal
[1:43:25] then it's not found in religion
[1:43:32] you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:43:34] it's not it's not found in a formula
[1:43:41] so if it was
[1:43:43] in the beginning
[1:43:46] and it it and then he says there are
[1:43:48] things to be
[1:43:50] the reason that they're going to be
[1:43:52] there is because he already spoke them
[1:43:55] right or he already
[1:43:57] made them and it can't fail and it was
[1:44:01] already
[1:44:02] pre-planned for the things that are
[1:44:05] going to be
[1:44:06] are the things that are pre-planned
[1:44:11] so if he had my life already
[1:44:15] pre-planned i don't want to look for
[1:44:18] something that doesn't pertain to me and
[1:44:22] it wasn't the plan that he had for my
[1:44:25] life
[1:44:31] so the things that
[1:44:34] are to be
[1:44:37] for me
[1:44:39] are the things
[1:44:41] that he
[1:44:43] planned
[1:44:44] for me
[1:44:48] and
[1:44:49] what effort could i try to put into
[1:44:54] trying to change
[1:44:57] the plan that god
[1:44:59] had for your life
[1:45:01] because i thought it was a pre-cloned
[1:45:05] plan
[1:45:07] in letter form
[1:45:11] and i could teach it
[1:45:15] the only thing we can teach
[1:45:18] is the word
[1:45:22] but you're going to receive the word
[1:45:25] according to the
[1:45:27] plan
[1:45:30] that's in you
[1:45:34] you understand what i'm saying if it's
[1:45:36] pre-planned
[1:45:43] you know like let's just say take cosmon
[1:45:46] and andrew
[1:45:47] what happens if i spend all my effort to
[1:45:51] try to get them to be
[1:45:53] great orators
[1:45:56] and have all knowledge
[1:45:59] and wisdom
[1:46:00] according to the scriptures and tried to
[1:46:04] put them in my school of revelation
[1:46:10] when what god's planned form was
[1:46:13] was to pray for the sick
[1:46:18] to have burden on their heart
[1:46:21] and to seek the face of the lord what
[1:46:24] god would have
[1:46:26] for
[1:46:27] them that were in need
[1:46:31] because that was his plan for their life
[1:46:36] and i was trying to unfold mysteries and
[1:46:39] and i was trying to create to have great
[1:46:41] teachings and and show them all the
[1:46:44] great depth light
[1:46:47] that's in god's word it would be of none
[1:46:50] effect
[1:46:53] they might be smart
[1:46:56] they might be revelated
[1:47:00] but they would be revelated in
[1:47:04] everything but what they should seek
[1:47:11] so we ask it
[1:47:13] a lot of times this way i we seek
[1:47:16] the will
[1:47:17] what's the will of god i'm going to seek
[1:47:20] the will of god but we don't look at it
[1:47:25] as it's beyond a will
[1:47:29] it's a plan
[1:47:36] and when i find
[1:47:39] the plan
[1:47:41] of god for my life
[1:47:45] i'm endued with power
[1:47:48] from on high
[1:47:51] when i find the word of god for my life
[1:47:55] i'm endued
[1:47:57] with power
[1:47:58] from on high
[1:48:00] because then i'm doing
[1:48:04] the will
[1:48:06] of my father
[1:48:08] and so eat god's made each of us
[1:48:14] as individuals
[1:48:17] he doesn't have big eyes
[1:48:20] or little ears
[1:48:23] and
[1:48:24] so
[1:48:25] when we begin to understand lord my i
[1:48:28] was in you in the beginning
[1:48:32] spoke your word
[1:48:34] you came and redeemed me
[1:48:36] my name is written on the lamb's book of
[1:48:38] life
[1:48:40] i'm i if i have eternal life i always
[1:48:43] had eternal life because i was a part of
[1:48:47] you
[1:48:49] what happens in my life
[1:48:51] if i could change
[1:48:55] what i'm seeking for
[1:49:00] and
[1:49:01] absolutely say
[1:49:03] seek
[1:49:05] and look for
[1:49:06] father what did you made me
[1:49:09] what talents
[1:49:11] or
[1:49:12] that not that we have talents or
[1:49:14] abilities but what was your plan for
[1:49:19] my life
[1:49:22] because
[1:49:24] all
[1:49:25] that
[1:49:26] he foreknew
[1:49:29] he justified
[1:49:31] and sanctified
[1:49:34] and
[1:49:34] glorified
[1:49:37] all that
[1:49:42] in him
[1:49:43] and he expressed
[1:49:46] begin to have
[1:49:48] particular
[1:49:50] attributes
[1:49:54] that identified
[1:49:56] what their will
[1:49:59] and
[1:50:01] their calling is
[1:50:03] so my heart's desire is
[1:50:06] that we don't look
[1:50:10] for
[1:50:13] the best word i have in my mind for it
[1:50:17] is clone to christianity
[1:50:21] but we seek after
[1:50:26] something that is unique
[1:50:29] for each of us
[1:50:32] but yet described
[1:50:36] in the word of god
[1:50:38] because as it's
[1:50:41] it's almost like
[1:50:43] one word
[1:50:46] but yet that one word
[1:50:49] produces many
[1:50:53] brethren
[1:50:56] in many different ways
[1:50:58] and many
[1:51:00] different attributes
[1:51:02] and many
[1:51:03] different forms and then we won't try to
[1:51:07] beat the people
[1:51:10] into one
[1:51:12] mind
[1:51:13] set
[1:51:15] or one
[1:51:17] work
[1:51:19] and then there's a freedom as the body
[1:51:22] grows
[1:51:24] one ladder at a time and is fitted
[1:51:28] and joined together
[1:51:31] so you say brother mcgeary
[1:51:34] isn't there just something
[1:51:37] one thing i can believe in
[1:51:42] believe in him
[1:51:44] believe in his word
[1:51:48] but his word is not
[1:51:53] creed
[1:51:54] dogma
[1:51:56] or letter
[1:51:58] his word
[1:52:00] is spirit
[1:52:02] and life
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:10] think of it
[1:52:13] and this spirit and
[1:52:16] life
[1:52:18] was
[1:52:18] the light
[1:52:20] of
[1:52:22] men
[1:52:25] and if and all i i
[1:52:28] i don't know how just to express it and
[1:52:32] i've been just feeling but whatever
[1:52:36] it was he was
[1:52:39] and he
[1:52:41] spoke it
[1:52:42] and said let there be
[1:52:46] everything that god spoke
[1:52:50] will be
[1:52:52] so the things that are to be
[1:52:56] are the things that god spoke
[1:52:59] and if i was with him in the beginning
[1:53:03] then he spoke me
[1:53:08] i'm in the word
[1:53:12] the word doesn't stand without me
[1:53:16] i'm a part of it
