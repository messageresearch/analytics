Description:
How Can I Overcome
Br. David McGeary
October 9, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

of my heart our heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening as we have this time of Fellowship Lord knowing that we certainly are in perilous times so many voices so many unur certainties but there's been one constant that's never changed and that's the great North Star it's your word father that has endured Through the Ages has guided man through every phase of civilization from horse and buggy to car to plane to Rocket no matter where science goes no matter where education goes no matter where civilization goes your word is the one thing that guides your elect to their Eternal destination we ask that that word would bless us this evening we ask these things in Jesus precious name we pray amen if you have your Bibles let's just open it up to the uh scripture that we've been studying from and uh and in the Book of Revelations the 3D chapter and in the 20 first verse Revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches father bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated nice to be in the house of the Lord this evening we've been uh listening and we'll finish up uh this evening with uh the message uh how can I overcome and we know that overcome uh to overcome something means there has to be an obstacle or there has to be uh uh some obstacle trying to keep you from achieving your goal so you it's something that's going to rise up that you have to deal with that you have to get past that you have to overcome it because it's trying to overcome you so it's a automatic battle set right before you and you didn't Institute that so it's not something that you brought upon yourself it's something that has been placed in your path it's an obstacle if you're driving down the road and there's a tree Laying across the road and you want to go down further down that road well you'll have to overcome that obstacle to go any farther because the purpose of that obstacle is to stop you from proceeding on your journey to where you're going and this is uh what is uh granted here so we see in the framework of of what is uh written here he says him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my father's Throne so we know what that what the goal is because we know what it is we have to overcome so he says if you overcome this is your reward and that's what we're going to listen to tonight is the rewards of the ages so we realize that what we're overcoming is uh well the enemy is the obstacle that we have to overcome remember he comes up with all kinds of different tricks he comes up with different things to get you off course different things to slow you down different things to make it difficulty but it's not the thing itself that's the is our enemy or what we have to overcome we have to overcome the person that's putting it there so if you're walking down down the road and and all of a sudden this obstacle comes up in your way you're not really dealing with the obstacle you're dealing with the person that put it there and if you know you have power over him then you know you have power over his works and so you just move that obstacle and that's why the prophet of God said this he said to overcome means to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks so it doesn't matter what trick he puts up there it doesn't matter what thing he poses before you you've got to recognize it as being something that's trying to keep you from obtaining your goal so one of the things he tries to do is to get take our vision from us from what it is that we're living for what it what it is we're trying to obtain pain where it is that we're trying to go so we're just not we're just not uh trying to live a daily life and and take it one day at a time so to speak and and and no we're on a journey we're trying to get somewhere we're trying to prepare for something so we we we don't want and so that's what tton does he's he's he's always traveling to uh he's always doing what he can to keep us us from uh uh getting farther and then so I like what the the messenger he he makes this statement I was going to I had it marked here see if I can I can find it uh but he he makes the statement he says it's not it's not it's the Overcomer is he who finishes it's not a lot who starts but it's but it's if if you finish and that's the that's the important thing is to finish he said he says not not he that starts he that finishes many start the race but there's only one finishes it there'll be many churches start many groups of people but there'll be one group finished and that's the Overcomer so the to over to come means to finish you know and so it's not just just one obstacle it's every obstacle it's every battle that's what it is because you've got your goal set you know it is where you're going you know what it is that you're living for you know what it is that you you're trying to obtain and you're trying to achieve and you know the condition you've got to be in to to be ready because the bride's made herself ready so when you begin to you get uh you get the the picture of it is you you he wants to get you out of focus he wants you know another we we quit we we we quit looking all the way down the road now remember he talked about the boy on the bicycle he says what's your secret he says I keep my eye on the prize I keep my eye on the road and the end of the road the end of the board the end of the path and that that keeps me from going this way or that way now that sounds so simple but we just went through he he began to talk about the three tricks and the different things that Satan's doing so you've got to understand that you got an enemy that's going about like a roaring line always trying to get you to fail to keep in your memory that there's a heaven to gain we we we were purchased not just to live a good life here but we were purchased to go back to what we were in the beginning so it's not to finished so then and we I just want to bring up this little point in he said he said no we he he mentioned to us that we're born defeated so we couldn't do it on our own right he paid the price for us he he got he he he gave his life and he says and he talking about your birth he says and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated and you're born in a def defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds defeated denomination you've got to come to a victory some way he says just like the Lily and you remember this from last night uh last time we played it he talked about the Lily being in the bottom it's got to come to the victory some way and I like what he says here now I think that's overcoming that's that once in sin once did things that was wrong but don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then why look back into the pond again you can't look back you know what I mean he said God by his predestination see has brought this seed of life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on top of it all it has overcome it doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you in your sin and adultery and everything you lived in you didn't Express nothing just think of that you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed there and it's got a chance to press itself into the light and now you in the presence of Jesus with the sun light s so n light it brought you out what you brought you out you really was in the beginning see what I mean you saw the light and you bloomed out so in other words he talking using the little as example it had to press its way through the mud it had to press its way through the water it had to press its way through the weeds it had to it had to keep pressing it has to keep overcoming but one day it blossoms and so that's what we got to understand don't look back look forward know that there's something that we've that we're obtaining notice that there's going to be obstacles in our way and the Overcomer doesn't get defeated he doesn't stop believing that there's a reward he doesn't stop believing that he's been paid for if Satan can get you to look at your own worth you're done if you can get to look and think that you got some ability to make it you're done but you've got to know one thing he that is in me is greater than he that is the world what he put in me is greater I'm not overcoming by myself I'm Overcoming By The Grace that he put in me and if I keep pressing that battle see we we we take that and we turn it into a Doctrine and then it just becomes a Creed and it's just something we believe no it's not something we believe every day I'm in a battle I got to press the Mark I got to leave those things which are behind got to press for a high calling I got to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks every time he tries to get me off course I've got to make sure I'm off course and I got to keep pressing it and now so we're going to pick up right there and now he's going to talk about the reward of the Overcomer so we know why we're overcoming why do I want to overcome this why do I want to get the victory over this now salvation is free you're not rewarded with eternal life you always had eternal life eternal Life's a gift of God this any man should boast but if you do certain things if you read the scriptures certain thing things Merit results they Merit benefits C you know if you do certain things you you you know it produces a result sin has a wage Works has a wage and so you you you've got with them that that it's this this pressing for this reward that we know we can't overcome ourselves but we know there's something in us he that is in US is greater so there's something in me the Lily didn't know what it was when it was in the bottom of the muck but it just kept striving because there's something in it and that's what we we want to realize that that's that part of us that's an overcomer so God placed in us it's to to the Overcomer to the Overcomer to the Overcomer so it's not you don't get out of the battle you face the battle every day and one day our Victory will be tremendous so we're going to pick up uh right there where almost where we left off the other uh the other night on uh uh I think we we're going to start at paragraph uh I think uh somewhere around 138 or 36 or something like that uh if you have your books and uh and we're going to pick up right right in there I think we stopped at paragraph 142 I believe the other day so we're just going to back up a paragraph and uh yeah and then he we're going to going to pick up where he starts the third great assault of Satan so Satan's the who we got to overcome and I believe that the Lord will help us overcome every time so God bless you as we listen to the last 30 minutes of this uh message how can I overcome and this is a good book to keep around and delve into and study every now and then and don't forget you're in the battle you're in a battle I Christian they want to preach Christianity nowadays is boy once you get in it's all joy and happiness yeah it is joy and happiness but we still got that guy and one day we're GNA put him in the Lake of Fire where he belongs you looking forward to that day I am God bless you as we listen to our messenger old true servant ever tries to show himself off of with God's power if he does he loses right then third great Assa Satan offered to Forfeit this Kingdom to him he did Satan said see these Kings of the world these are mine I'll do with them whatever I want to I'll forfeit them to you but you remember he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have touch the the kingdom but he must follow the he must come back he was tempted to do it now death a hard thing he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if you did his subject for to die Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me sat he's getting done he come and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we this morning willing to do take that same route that he taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to God for all the world and things to serve for him now he failed to do it willingly to to Forfeit it Satan was to him but he didn't do it though Jesus was tempted he overcome for us he he endured all Temptations for me and for you see he could have took it right then but what did he take the other rout for so that we could come be with him and if he paid such a price as that then how little would we be not to take it am when you remember there's nothing here anyhow right if you live a 100 years why you go to come to mental in your mind gone all crippled up and roll and shaky that's where you're going that's right and that's the end of it you come now overcome the pain how do you do it by the word amen what the word says you do walk humble live before Jesus he endured all things for you and I he is our example how to overcome our evil generation as he overcome his evil gener a remember when he come to the Earth there just as much unbelief or more than there is at anytime it didn't bother him a bit when they called him a devil instead of God when they called him everything that could be done it didn't bother him a bit he had one objective mind the father keep the word the word is God he had one mind we're sometimes tempted to go back many of you tempted to go back to the denomination go back and take up because all the world say what denomination you belong to what church you affiliated with we're tempted to do that all of us are our sisters are tempted to go back go back and join up with the some of the rest of the churches where some of the assemblies or Churches of God or some of them still be Pentecostal and let your hair was cut off and dress us about any way you want to you're tempted to do that go back and be PO with this wicked generation that we're living with when this is the major sin of our days that's right the major sin among our people worldliness as the Bible said the lady lady OA age was she's worldly Rich have need of nothing don't noce she's naked miserable Ratched blind that's that's the sin of our day when you hear the word of God call out against it then you take the other out you're unpop with the world you're tempted to go back I know you keep saying to me I know you're saying all the time I know you get tired of me harping on these things I get tired seeing you do it too this sin I'm trying to tell you about say why you H going far stop doing it then trying to save your life that's right by the word I get tired also they just straighten up this is a sin shouldn't be done e if we are to overcome these things we're expected to be tempted by them the world if you love the world the things of the world love of God's Not in you said Jesus am now we close and say there's a reward for the Overcomer let me read something here to you turn in your Bibles let's go back to Revelations the third the second chapter watch here now all these things have been talking about to over come now just look at yourself and see examine yourself in the spiritual Looking Glass see if you've overcome now the first message to the to the angel of Ephesus I want you to listen to what he said and Revelations the 2 chapter the 7eventh verse this is to that church age when he told him all what they' done left their first love seventh verse he that has an ear let him hear what the SP spirit sayith to the churches to him the person not the church the him that overcometh overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God see the Overcomers in Ephesus now the next was saman now the Overcomers in that we listen to this now the 11th verse say he he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen the the overcometh the puros we'll find out what the Overcomer had uh left for him in this we'll read the 17th verse to the peros church he that has an ear that that's individual not the whole group the individual that's bride coming out the see of the church let him that has an ear you're What Spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh I will give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receives it that's the Overcomer lord of the church agent now the next is batara let's find out what the Overcomer had in that day let's take the 26th verse and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give the power over the Nations there's right and shall rule them with a rod of iron and is a vessel of Potter shall they be broken into Shivers even as I received of my father see with him in his throne Christ is a rule of nation with the rod of iron and here is the church that overcome sitting in there with him to break the nations with a rod of arm now let's take them to the Sardis Church now the fifth verse of the third chapter he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and the Holy Angels that's to the Overcomer and sardus now let's take now the 12th verse now this is to the Church of U Philadelphia in the 12th verse him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him my name name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God and I will write upon him my new name watch what the Overcomers promised see now now lady oia that's the last Church ages could be some Overcomers in that watch out they remember each Church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other one is offered what watch up here now here's after they've done received all these Powers these new names and everything written that he promised and eat the hidden man and all down through watch's this last Church AG Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to set with me in my Throne amen even as I so overcome and am set down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches there's a reward for Overcomers Press On Lily if it's in you lay aside the mud and everything else and press towards the to yes sir to sit with me on my Throne you know one time the mother of James and John we won't have time to read it the mother of James and John came and asked for this place you know that remember that Lord let my son set on one side and my other son set on the other as a mother's desire for her son but watch but that place Jesus said was predestinated this position was not in existence at that time wow notice it will be granted to them who it is meant for why the one that set at the right hand and the other closest to him was yet an overcomer see he was still he said I I don't Grant this I can't Grant this but it will be given after the trial comes amen see I can't give this but after the trial comes they'll set on the right hand and on the left there's a predestinated seed waiting out for that it will be given to the ones that's promised to it'll be given there but the test hasn't come yet that it hasn't overcome yet see the person that was to take this place on one side and another to take it on the other side next to him in the kingdom it wasn't yet given see that been overcome the test hadn't faed yet it will fall in the future if we suffer for Christ and his word we will reign with him for he is the word remember if we suffer for him and his word we'll reign with him in his word notice ye are example overcome and then ascended up after he conquered death hell sickness grave everything he conquered then he ascended up and L captivity captivity give gifts unto man that was the Old Testament with the Old Testament saints that had overcome they look for such a person and they died before it got there but when this person come it didn't prevent them which were asleep that's right can't do anyway live die what does it mean Hallelujah won't prevent see they looked for that even job back there he looked for it he said I know my redeemer liveth not the last days he'll stand upon the Earth that was a just man a perfect man he offered sacrifice he done everything that God told him to do he did it with reverence and respect he was a prophet and then Satan come around and temp him just like he comes to tempt you what did he do he kept standing there his wife even come out and said won't you curse God die to death you look so miserable sit there he said thou speakest like a foolish woman now never said she's foolish but you talk like one see said thou speakest like a foolish woman said the lord gave and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord he overcome he overcome what the neighbors had to say he overcome what all the church members belad and all them had to say he overcome the bishop what he had to say he overcome the Cardinal what he had to say he overcome the denomination what they had to say and he stayed with the justification of the word amen yet it cost him everything he had even his children scraped the balls with a piece of crop setting on this yet he overcome and when that great hour of Temptation had finally succeeded then the clouds roll back he's looked at every reasonable thing he said there's a hope in a tree if it do it lives again and a SE falls in the ground it rots away it lives again but a man layeth down he giveth up the ghost He wasteth away and his children come his sons to honor him to mourn over him he perceive it not he don't raise them or oh there he is what's the matter I'm a SE dud I'm something
