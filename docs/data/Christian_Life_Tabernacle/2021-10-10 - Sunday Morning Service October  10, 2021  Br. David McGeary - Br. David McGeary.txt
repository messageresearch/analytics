[Music] [Music] most precious heavenly father [Music] lord we just want to come this morning and thank you lord father for you inviting us here lord father and we know by divine revelation lord if you brought us here this morning you have something for us father so lord let us cast aside all of our thoughts all of our worries lord anything that would hinder us from receiving what you have for us this morning lord father we ask that you'll cleanse us all now of any and all unclean spirits father anything is trying to linger upon us from being out there lord father truly for the house of god lord this is where the bride comes father to be judged lord so father any of our faults or mistakes that we may not see lord let them be seen this morning father so that we may bring them to you lord

any backsliders among us lord god bring them back into the fold father may you just have your way in a mighty way lord move upon your people lord as our brother comes out this morning lord may you just help him to step aside so you may step in into him lord bring forth what you have for us father we give you all the praise the glory and the admiration lord and we're so looking forward to what you have for us we give this time to you now in the precious and only name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you this morning i want to welcome everyone in the hearts of god i mean i know we have many of our people back in louisiana at the meeting so certainly we want to pray for them and we're thankful to be here in his presence man it's good to have brother matthew and brother cosman back god bless you man as you invite brother mike for our song reading this morning amen all the others are out at the meeting you know if you've been paying attention to the news at all there's kind of been a tragic story playing out about a couple that went on a vacation and only one of them came back and of course many days later they found her body and he has of course disappeared and it struck me as i was reading the news reports about how there's this great manhunt underway they're pouring thousands of dollars and men and women and resources and equipment and you know they're they're using every resource at the disposal weeks and days and nights all looking for one man and you think about all the effort being put into seeking this one you know what i was thinking about that i was thinking about that word to seek something you know webster defines it this way it's to search for something or to try to find something the thing about seeking is first of all you have to know what you're looking for you can't just go seeking for something and not really have anything in mind other than you know maybe a few misguided young people that are out looking for themselves and i promise they won't like what they find when they find it you have to have something in mind you have to have something that you're focusing on when you're searching but the other thing about seeking is it takes work it takes effort it takes investment and it takes desire you know i'm sure we've all had that those of us that have children who've had that experience where we send them to the refrigerator to find something and they open the door and they stare blankly at the inside for a minute or two and like it's not there that's not seeking moving things aside and digging because you know it's there and you're going to find it right but there's effort involved in that you know some people spend their entire lives their entire careers their last dollar seeking something whether it's a scientific achievement whether it's a pinnacle of their career a position a title whatever the case may be an object could be that dream car that dream home but they spend their entire lives seeking that thing you know jesus told several parables about this about this seeking in luke 15 he spoke of the shepherd who has lost a sheep and leaves the 99 behind and goes off into the mountains spending who knows how long to find that one it took effort it took work it took focus it took desire then of course there's the story of the woman that lost the coin in her house turned over everything in her home sweeping the floors clean took hours of work to find that which he was looking for seeking and when we read psalm 70 this morning if you want to turn to that you know david describes two searches going on there's two things that are being sought two seeking campaigns two manhunts if you will and the first is in verse two it says let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire might hurt you know as we mentioned several weeks ago there's no time in the psalms where david is asking for deliverance from someone that's coming after his body or coming after his health or coming after his comfort or his safety it's always about coming after his soul but it's interesting the word that's used here is seeking his soul you know it occurred to me that there was someone that had his soul as their specific target and if we look at that example of seeking turning over every stone using every tool at their disposal working tirelessly day and night to try to get his soul and that's a sobering thought you know that's still the case today there is one who is using every tool in the book surrounding us with everything in his arsenal day and night without rest seeking after our soul you know it says in first peter 5 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary as a roaring lion walketh about seeking who may maybe may devour you know all everything around us in this troubled world all those distractions all those voices those influences part of that arsenal of someone coming to seek after our soul but you know then in verse 4 there's another search underway another seeking that's being described it says this let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee you know once again just as in the other example seeking takes a couple of things you need to know what you're looking for you need to have a specific target and it takes work it takes effort it takes commitment it takes focus it says in deuteronomy 4 29 but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all your heart and all your soul so that's interesting it says in jeremiah 29 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart this is no casual look in the word to satisfy your curiosity or to you know solidify your belief system or to you know just to fulfill your religious obligation this is a full-time commitment this is absolute 100 percent commitment in the search or you won't find it right two searches going on both requiring 100 percent commitment it says in matthew 13 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hidden a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it total commitment total investment you know and it struck me psalm 70 has a little note at the front it says it's a psalm of remembrance you know and i thought that that was really a sobering reminder to remember that there are two great searches going on and both require 100 commitment of your soul the first is one who is using every tool in his arsenal to try to find and devour your soul and the reminder to be sober to be vigilant can't be half-hearted about this in this laodicea age of partial commitment the stakes are full commitment but the other is a search for him pouring our full heart and our soul and our commitment to seek his face jesus said in john 6 44 no man can come to me except the father who sent me draw him do you realize how precious it is to even desire to see when you rub your shoulders with all the people in the world how many of them aren't even giving it a second thought yeah maybe they believe in god maybe they talk about religious things but there's no desire there no hunger to go seeking and here's a cry to seek him with all of our heart i thought it was a good reminder as we read that this morning it says in isaiah 55 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near i thought as we read this this morning it's just a small small chapter to remember the great offer we have to put our whole heart and soul into seeking his face let's read that together psalm 70 just five verses says make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire might hurt let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha aha let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying amen [Music] god bless you i have your seats [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] pulled oh [Music] oh [Applause] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] just think about it [Applause] oh [Applause] is [Music] me oh oh is [Music] oh is [Applause] [Applause] okay [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] oh jesus [Applause] amen amen aren't you glad it's faithful to his promise amen amen we have some requests to bring before the church whether jorel writes please pray for the family of lara espinosa they've just lost a loved one and they asked that god and we ask that god bless them with the love and the strength they meant to get through this time certainly i remember them this morning but as royal writes again please pray for my grandson ezekiel jr he's not getting oxygen and he needs a and he needs it amen and he's coughing please pray that our great physician touches his body and heal him amen god bless you thank you sister leslie wright sister angela lilly requests prayer for a medical need in her body so you want to lift her up in prayer this morning but darion writes priests pray that god will undertake an unspoken request certainly pray that god will answer that amen brother john writes christina father is in the hospital on the ventilator and his kids kidneys are shut down please pray for uh for him saints also for christina's mom she's at home not feeling so good amen amen amen the only thing i could say is we have a great physician this morning amen i know the devil will throw all kinds of things amen amen but we are so thankful that we have a place we can come and we have a living god who can come this morning and answer to the needs of his children if you haven't hit up on your heart just lift your hand up to him this morning hey man but patrick if you could just come and take these things before the brothers that are taking the offering see if you can come this morning [Music] let's pray lord jesus we thank you lord to come this morning lord we come to worship you to praise your name lord lord we have heard all the requests that was out here wrote lord some i can't not remember but we believe in you we

are you are you here way back there all right would you help me with your new last name all right well you know i'm irish if it don't start with mick it's hard for me to pronounce but anyway congratulations to you they're they're planning their wedding in around uh august the 4th 2022 so if the lord tarries that'll be a wonderful day god bless you let's open our bibles this morning and just going to have a little uh short service this morning so let's turn in our scriptures over to matthew i mean to mark excuse me that 11th chapter of mark and we're going to read 12 13 and 14 and then drop down and pick up 20. and uh the the portion of scripture that we've are skipping is when jesus goes into the temple and he routes the unbelievers out who don't have the right motive and objective but it's here in the 11th chapter it says and on the morrow they went and come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of the hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and then on the 20th first and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter called to remembrance and saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed it is withered away and jesus answering said unto them have faith in god for verily i send you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou moved and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt it in his heart he shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your trespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses may the lord add his blessings to his word you may be seated you know many uh different scholars in studying the story of the fig tree and we know that the fig tree represented israel and and putting forth its bloom and and so many scholars feel that when he cursed the fig tree it was a representation that the israel the fruit of that that law and the things were coming to an end but i like to drop down to the conclusion of the matter when he said have faith in god and we just wanted a fellowship just for a little a bit this morning about faith you know we're we're living in a time now and every believer knows that the world is changing rapidly and that the the world has chosen not to put its trust in god they're laying their trust in science uh we've heard over and over and over again uh we're trusting the science we're believing in the science the science the science the science now could you just imagine if we had somebody that said let's all of our nation go to prayer let's ask god to come down and spare us from this mistake that we made and god was never brought into the picture in fact we closed churches and we limited the number of people that could come and we see that our within our country in different places of the world there's great political turmoil now of there's a great divide in our country between capitalism and socialism and and and i i'm not here to preach either of those because i believe god has a kingdom and that's what our hearts desire is it's to be in the kingdom of god so we know that man is ruling and governing themselves and they have a right to do that i don't think it's the wisest thing to do is to rule without god i think that it's very important and i think it's beneficial that we have the creator of all things involved in our life we know the story of the man that was working in the garage and he was there working on the carburetor of an automobile and that he was just struggling so much to get that to run and he was struggling and a gentleman stepped up to him and and asked him he said uh may i help you and the guy looked over and his hands were covered with grease you know the mechanic and he'd been doing this for years and he looked at the fell and the fella was there in a slacks and a nice shirt and everything he thought okay you know give it a shot you know what i mean many a times i've suggested you know to somebody that's doing something you know you'd say well why don't you try this and the first thing they do is you do it you know what i mean they hand you the tool you want to tell me how to do it you think you can do it better you do it here's the wrench here's the tools you know and uh you know and but this man was very very gentlemanly and he just said may i help you and so he got in there and he just did a few little things and the car was accomplished and the man stood back and he said who are you he said well i'm the chief engineer for ford motor company and i designed this carburetor and so why would you not have a god in your life that designed life he designed life you know he even designed our days did you know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord he he he wants to be in the affairs of man and govern the affairs of man it's when man turns away his leadership that my man finds himself in trouble so we realize we're kind of in an age now in where things are changing rapidly uh technology is changing rapidly they were talking uh here on the other day i was listening on the radio and they said that bill gates used to be the richest man in the world because of he developed this technology i think was it microsoft or whatever that he does in the phones and and all these things but he was surpassed by another gentleman named bozo jeff bozo and and he uh he i guess he's a developer and i said it correct he might not pronounce it that way but that's exactly what it is and and he uh and he's developed this uh uh thing now that everybody can shop at home you know and uh my porch is loaded with stuff all the time you know and and uh so that and now he was the richest man in the world but now they have a new richest man in the world and uh i believe his name is ed at something musk and and uh he's now the richest man in the world but i take uh i disagree with them i'm the richest man in the world because he testified the other day that he wants to die on mars but i don't ever want to die i thought what a goal in life to die on mars what are you living for to die on mars to be the first man buried on mars i want to go past mars don't you i mean that i don't want to die on mars i want to wave mars goodbye i i i don't want to die why and i don't have to die because i can live forever the smartest people in the world are those who have eternal life that's the smartest people in the world they have eternal life amen and again and so you know like i say why live uh why live to die when you can live to live you know i think his goal of leaving this world is is a great goal i want to leave this world i don't want to learn how to stay here i want to learn how to leave here and i want the rapture to become a reality to me i i i want the eternal life to become a reality to me you just to know that there is life after this death to have it come so much into my heart and be such a reality to me that that i i when this flesh takes his last breath that i totally understand beyond a shadow of a doubt i will still be conscious and aware of my existence it's just the people on the outside can't see where i am but i've stepped into what is invisible to us in in the carnal realm but there actually there's life there there's eternal life and and we have the promise that when this body here is is decayed and gone that we have one waiting for us that that one that puts on incorruption and and so i just don't want to read it from a uh a biblical if i could say that intellectual standpoint i i don't want to just have it there as a a hope so you know what i mean or as something that i feel that someday i'll find out if it's true or not i'd like to have it answered now and the hour that we're in and what it is that we're facing we're being faced more and more and more with the need in our lives to understand that there is life after this life because this life is becoming very discouraging to us i mean just think if you could be the richest person in the world one day and in just no time flat you're not right you know uh then any earthly accomplishment ends with death so i i like i'm saying so i think it really behooves us but so what we what i'm trying to point to is that in the hour that we're living now it's going to take faith faith is the most important thing to the believer now faith will allow us to navigate no matter how dark it becomes and we know that in hebrews is a scripture that we're all very familiar with hebrews 11 and 1 it says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so if faith can give us an evidence and it's a substance something that's real and my hope is the kingdom of god that's what my hope is our our hope should be the kingdom of god no matter what blessings god has given us by the fruits of our education which is fine by the pathways that we've chosen in life to do what we do for a living we know that all those things are just things that are abiding time it's what we do in tell there's no great eyes and no big eyes in little you a a person that uh uh as uh what we call a sanitary engineer for example you know because someone that go drives down up and down the streets and and picks up the art garbage and and okay and hauls it to the dump forest that's a very important part of life that that because that's not a lower uh uh a job especially if that person's got the joy of the lord in their heart and they're singing praises to god and they know that this is what they're doing until again you may have we have all kinds of different talents here some in computers some in construction uh some in medical all all different uh uh types of jobs and things that we do and none of them have any greater reward than any other if you're just abiding time if you're just waiting for that great hope because uh the you know god didn't come to the rich in this world he came to the poor of this world rich in faith and so that's where our treasure wants to be it's harder the scripture says for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god than it is for a camel to go through the eye of the needle and you know the eye of the needle was the small gate that sat by the great double gates that when they closed the city up at night then they could guard a very narrow passage that could go through and so he said it's harder for a rich man because we have a tendency to put our trusts in our accomplishments we put our trust in the things that we have we look at our bank account and we feel secure because we have so much money there but a man of faith that believes god has more money in his account than pictures of dead presidents because with faith he can do all things you know i mean he has all things in fact the scripture says i've never seen the righteous big bread okay and the richest of the world always have a tendency to move us to the place where we begin to trust in our accomplishments we trust in our education we trust in the things that that uh that we can feel feel and that we can touch and then we weigh their value you know i uh i don't have i would say someone asked me would i like a paper copy yeah i like paper copies i don't know why because i i didn't grow up where you just put something in a cloud somewhere in hopes it comes back to me that's like flying a kite you know i hope it comes back you know and and and i don't have confidence in that but we we want to we don't want to have confidence in things that are forever changing do you understand what i'm trying to say from my perspective something becomes totally obsolete you know i have a computer at home i don't know what's wrong with the thing it wants to update every other day just leave me alone you know what i mean i don't need no updates you know i i don't i you know i uh you know leslie always has to ask tell me every day have you checked your messages have you checked your text have you checked your email you know i i said no nobody's called me you know i haven't heard from anybody everything's fine no you've got to check these things that's what people do and and so we we why would we put our trust in something that's going to change so rapidly because what happens is you your whole life is trying to keep up now can you imagine living your whole life trying to keep up trying to keep up with the joneses trying to keep up with a guy that wants to die on mars i don't want to keep up with that i want to keep up with the one that's got the information that's going to give me eternal life that's who i want to keep up with i want to keep up with the updates that are coming from the word of god because that's where i want to put my trust that's where i want to put my my faith that where i i want to come to the place that this is what i live for this is what i believe in this is what's going to take me i i now have an awareness about me and a consciousness about me and a reality about me that this world is going to perish don't let it deceive you don't let it fake you out if i can say this the reason they keep going and keep changing and keep doing everything is because they haven't found it yet but when you've come to and meant him it makes a difference so this is why what we're talking about today is that what we need more than ever is faith faith is the tool that accomplishes everything for the believer for with god nothing is impossible i believe that's luke 1 uh 37 for with god all things are possible faith is it is with the for in second corinthians 5 and 7 says for we walk by faith not by sight and matthew 21 22 all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing you shall have believing so faith becomes the tool if i could say that by which we are going to have to live by in order to pursue the reality that we want to live in you don't want to live in the world you don't want to be following everything that's going on the world like i said you want to bring peace to your heart turn off fox news turn off nsnbc turn off cen my goodness they changed their story over and over and over again i i sat in a little uh i sat in the restaurant the other day with leslie and and that that little shooting that took place in arlington come up and all i saw on the news over and over again and the one hour was this they kept showing the picture of the swat team running up to the school it was so sensationalized and they created such panic you know wasn't the reality of it the boy didn't mean to kill anybody they shouldn't have had a gun he shot some people and he went home got an attorney and turned himself into the police oh they didn't report that for hours and hours and hours later just shooting shooting shooting shooting shooting okay the world's falling apart what are you going to do about it you better find some place to put your trust because if the watchman watches the city if god doesn't watch the city the watchmen watches in vain so there's got to be something that we as believers can live by in a world that we can't trust anymore a lot of people trusted their jobs and one day they shut their jobs down okay now that we we visited with a lady at the restaurant she said i've worked here so many years she said so far so good but if they make me get a vaccine i'm not going to be here anymore that's how she feels she's afraid of it and she has a right to me the only reason i took the vaccine because i had a promise that if i take up a deadly thing it shouldn't harm me i i felt i was in a position that i didn't i couldn't set a precedent for you and say don't get it it's that's not my place but my place is to put our trust in the word of god so faith now becomes very extremely important to those who want to live in the kingdom of god because you can only live in god's kingdom by faith faith is what makes his kingdom work you can't try to live here pretending you're living in the kingdom of god and don't believe it don't believe it can't take care of you don't believe it can't provide for you whatever you pray for and you act that you can have if you can't believe that it can't take care of you that if you seek it first all things will be added to you you can't live and serve two masters it comes to a time and the time is approaching us and being forced on us very rapidly that we're going to have to choose who's going to lead us who am i going to believe that's the great they would someone please tell me who they is i'll tell you who that is they is lucifer in the 200 000 demon demons that were poured out on the earth to to test the bride that's who they is you see one of these great movie stars they're anointed with one of those demons that we're let loose that are influencing our young people you see all this these things going out there all this sin and people and murders and all this stuff those that's those demons that are manifesting themselves in flesh the 200 000 demon demons that were poured out on the world we better start losing confidence because every word of man is a lie and every word of god is true so there there comes a time that we've got to step out of the in between we've got to step out of trying to filter what's going on in the world our personal desires our personal goals in life and the goal of the kingdom of god i preached i thought what brother mike said fit so well in the morning service seek ye first the kingdom of god don't try to join it together and mix it you know what what do you get when you mix hot water and cold water so he said don't be lukewarm don't mix it don't be afraid to put yourselves in the hands of the living god amen don't be afraid of that now our question is he told us here so if we read on further it says in hebrews 6 it says without faith it's impossible to please him you can't please god without faith okay if you're trying to live in a kingdom and not please the king things won't go very well for you it just makes sense right you can't be there raising insurrection against the king and and speaking blasphemes to the king the king will simply put you out of his kingdom whether he puts you out of the kingdom by putting you in his dungeon or whether he carries you out to some other borders and let's go but we've you we have all got to realize now that the world has left us they're no longer wishing to retain god in their knowledge they give no consideration to god no consideration education and science and civilization is what their god is they no longer have place for god in their society this is the first time in history that more people in the united states do not go to church than those that do and streaming don't count as going to church and the scripture tells us to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together but let's settle that this morning there is a real kingdom behold the kingdom of god is at hand there is a real kingdom and in that kingdom there is a governing law that runs that kingdom it is what controls the society of that kingdom and that rule of law in the kingdom of god is faith that's how you live in the kingdom of god you live in the kingdom of god by faith by faith if you believe and you put the king first everything will be taken care of if you believe all things that you ask for you shall have them by faith in this kingdom if you come upon some obstacle or some mountain or some valley that you can speak to that mountain and if you believe in your heart it'll be moved in other words faith is what puts you living in a kingdom that actually has a civilization of faith things happen in the kingdom of god that don't happen in the world and it is a place you can live because he gives you the spirit to live there you got carnal life that right and because you were born in whichever country you were born in and and that allowed you to come to this country because your flesh lives in this country you live in this country by the flesh but and so we have the spirit the spirit of america the you know the spirit of the way things are done here and you know if you go to england they drive on the wrong side of the road no they say we drive on the wrong side of the road but there's a spirit that god gives us that allows us to live in his kingdom and that is his spirit that's what the holy spirit is the holy spirit is the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ jesus had the personality of god what dwelt in jesus was the spirit of god it was a spirit that was holy why was it holy why do we call it the holy spirit because the spirit he had was without sin it was without unbelief which of you can convict me of sin or unbelief so he was the first fruits of that kingdom that's why they said behold the kingdom of god behold the lamb of god he says in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would not tell you if my kingdom were of this world my soldiers would come fight for me so he's invited us to enter into his kingdom which is operated and lived in by faith hook it's extremely important that we come to a greater revelation and understanding of the need for faith and the understanding of that we need to use it more in our lives it's not just for catastrophe it's for everything so faith uh we we need faith to fight because this kingdom of the world is trying to overcome our kingdom oh yeah in fact satan offered his kingdoms to the king of kings and he said no get behind me because i have a kingdom that won't perish heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away so we want to live by something that is not going to pass away and you can't live by the word of god without faith in it so what what are we trusting because faith has to have a place to rest i'd like to read a few statements to you as we just fellowship along but i thought this was a an outstanding statement to see if i can find it here maybe i i forgot to mark it but uh in other words let me see just give me one second if i can just i thought i marked it but uh well i guess i i didn't but i'll just tell it to you he says god has to prove to you he's god in order for you to believe him now so let's understand god's not asking you to believe in something right i was fellowshipping with uh my barber and i was trying to explain to her i said you can't ask for something unless it's in existence we're talking about deep calling to a deep and and she's confused about the church world she she doesn't like what she sees in the churches she's continually telling me my preacher says this but that's not what the bible says that preacher says this but that's not what the bible says i thought my goodness i'm going to get my hair cut every other day okay yeah you know what i mean i may p she just uh you know and and and i know that that what she's seeking for is truth and the truth lies in the word of god he said i am the way the truth the life no man comes unto the father but by me until you've got to enter into this world of faith and god doesn't leave you empty without something to believe in so he's got to prove to you first that he's god so faith resting place it's got to rest in something and it's got to rest in something that god has made real to you else it's intellectual he said verily verily i say unto you that whatsoever ye shall say unto this mountain be removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he saith is coming to pass he shall have whatsoever he's sayeth what a promise he's introducing his kingdom if you live by faith things that that you wouldn't even believe was possible could happen faith in god it's staggering thing to many people faith in god is a staggering thing to many people in other words am i going to take my existence and my self-care and the provisions of my life am i going to take my life which we uh we have survival instincts we have self-preservation instincts we have all these things another am i going to take my life and put it into the care of god oh that's what they ask ananias and sapphira go sell all you have bring it here enter into this new life and they held back they didn't believe now their sin wasn't holding back their sin was lying about it that they thought they could deceive god and enter in you know your life will prove whether you're living by faith or not because but it's a staggering thing to many people and yet we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to confess that we don't have faith in god what a what a thing just say i do not totally completely put my life into the hands of god oh you're going to let somebody else rule your life why we we don't want to do that that's right okay we're reading the world don't want us we're outcasts the shuck is pulled away from us we're a seed waiting for harvest we have nothing left to do our existence is not going to be because we please man our existence is because we put god's word first and god keeps us he provides for us he takes care of us the boss wants to fire you and he can't something's standing in your way and the lord comes on the scene amen you know what he did for israel he sent hornets out the army all gets in a ray to fight israel and all of a sudden hornets sting them israel just marches right on through amen so if it presses down to us that we've come to it a hour that we might think you're going to advance but you're not going to advance in the world because the very seed within you will cause confusion in your mind if you try to advance you'll live with a continual turmoil and battle it comes to a time that we've got to finally come to the place where we say i'm going to believe god have faith in god have faith put your faith in him so let's talk just a few things about faith so we know faith final resting place is the word of god so god has to prove his word to be true in order for you to have faith in it jesus didn't come with word only he came with power and demonstration he turned the water into wine he he healed the blind man he touched the leopard he preached the kingdom of god with gladness as the people saw him he proved to them beyond a shadow of a doubt by vindicated word that what that he was saying was truth another he proved it to them that it was the truth in order for them to have faith in it can you understand he's never asked you to have any form of blind faith he's only asked us to believe in what was true that's why in this generation you'll hear many times the prophet of god say dance in the spirit shout prophesy do all these things and don't believe the word now the word in our day malachi 4 5 was manifested and scripturally brought to pass in a messenger to the church and his name was william branham that was just his name it could have been any other name in in in the world that's just the name of the name of the minister the fleshly name of the body of the man in whom god brought the word to pass look malachi 4 5 was something that was brought to pass luke 17 30 the ministry of the son of man which was the lord jesus taking on the form again of a prophet the vessel wasn't the lord jesus the spirit that was in the vessel was the lord jesus jesus said i will appear again in the ministry of a prophet and i'll reimpersonate again i will do the things that i did when i was on earth i will re redo those same ministries those same works those same miracles for the gentile church amen so here was a man that looked like a man just like me very similar in height stature thinner than i am a lot of the just a man but there was something that dwelt in that man because he was a prepared vessel by god that the spirit of god that the lord jesus christ in spirit form that's what the holy spirit is it isn't a third person of the trinity it's the same god back dwelling in us in spirit form if the spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in your mortal body it'll also quicken your mortal body and he did the same wonders he did the same signs he did the same works he raised the dead the blind received their sight the lame walk wasn't brother branham that did that he was the vessel that the lord jesus christ used to do that there's only one healer in that healer's god that was the promised word of god made manifest that it was true so he never asked you to believe this message based on anything intellectual in fact jesus didn't ask them to believe him intellectually he said if you can't believe what i teach believe believe me for the works that were done because they testify of who that i am so you understand god's not asking you to put your faith in a theology he's not asking you to put your faith in an intellectual conception he's only asking us to put our faith in something that he absolutely identified and proved to us to be true luke 17 30. we've seen it made manifest revelations 10 7 the mighty angel set his foot on the land in the sea john prophesied of it we we see the the representation of that in the sky and the opening of the seals so when he talks about when he talks about the word that's why he he chastised the church you believe all these things but you don't believe the word when it come to pass and so now he's asking us to believe the word of god to put our confidence in it to put our trust in it to believe what it says because through that we'll have life to live in this world until our time of departure comes and it's the faith in the word that keeps the world out of our life if not everything can slip in i'm not kidding you you know you know sports slips in television slips in movies slip in things just slip in it's not that it's not that uh that everything is evil right it's what happens is that we're trying to satisfy something with something else it's like hunting i like to hunt i'm not very good at it i think i'm a better fisherman and i'm a hunter and i'm not a good fisherman but you you don't go out there just to kill no sir you know you're there because you you you're outdoors you you love the things you love nature it's time you can talk with god and get along with god the hunting itself won't satisfy you the fishing itself won't satisfy you but it's fellowship with god that satisfies you you might have something else you like to do it's fine but you know if you keep him in every part of your life you have peace if you live by faith and walk by faith then you find out there's a satisfaction and a confidence in your life that that holds you and then you can recognize when something is trying to pull you away from your kingdom because that's what sin is sin is unbelief it's satan inviting you out of the kingdom of god with another greater promise oh i'll give you a better job wait a minute do i need a better job thank you satan you're going to give me a better job with more stress more headaches more pain i get to work 65 hours a week instead of 40 hours a week but you can buy a better car that cost me more to repair cost me more for insurance you know there's a reason he said god come to the poor in this world rich in faith we don't want to be attracted away from the kingdom of god we want our faith to grow because that we have the faith to live in the kingdom of god to live by the promises that he gave us in this kingdom of god that we can live by the promised word it's by these great and precious promises that we become partakers of divine nature so he gives us the promise and now he says if you believe in my promises you'll be a partaker of my kingdom you will enter into a peace and a rest that that surpasses understanding joy unspeakable full of glory and you will to be living a life in the spirit of god that's so comforting and so full of joy and you don't care what goes on to the world because you know you have a place prepared for you you're on a pathway to glory you have eternal life and it doesn't matter you don't have to show say nothing well let's talk about just faith in just a few moments we're closing it says and usually people who have faith are people who have experience experience brings faith i think that's the reason the bible teaches us and jesus says in saint john the third chapter except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of god therefore people ought to be saved before first they come to god and have an experience of salvation before they appreciate for their healing it must it'll work wonders if you can only believe so it's important to have an experience that you can build your faith on now we're not void of experience ephesians uh uh two and eight that's a good scripture let's just put that there on the board ephesians two and eight it says for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself it is the gift of god your first experience that god is wanting to build your faith with is the conviction of the spirit of god on your life you're living your world you're you're doing whatever you're doing and all of a sudden for some reason a conviction begins to work in your life you're convicted of sin because the spirit of god convicts men of sin you know you're not living right you know you're not heaven bound you know you're not that what you're doing is wrong all of a sudden there's a great dissatisfaction in your life and your heart with the things that are going on in your life and all of a sudden can you now out of the middle of nowhere having a consciousness with god that's the beginning of faith that's god giving you faith that's him making himself real to you convicting you of sin because he wants to transform you and have you become born again he wants to take you from the life that you're living into the kingdom that he has prepared for you taking you from the world to the kingdom of god that is by grace that is by invite god did that patrick and i were fellowshipping last evening and he came by him and uh as you know his little daughter was born uh premature and and the doctor told her she couldn't go out in public for three months and you know covet and all the things with so they came to show me the little darling and she's she's up ten pounds now you know in four months from two and a half pounds you know so god's being wonderful but patrick was suicidal and he was at work one day and he told the the fellow sitting next to him i might not be here tomorrow i'm going to kill myself now the guy he was talking to used to come to this assembly but he had dropped out his church and was backslid look he looks at patrick before you do that go talk to these people so he came over were you speaking english back then patrick a little bit english pretty good english okay and patrick came over to the house god was dealing with him that wasn't anybody that was the grace of god [Music] and we prayed with him and we told him about the lord and we talked to him that that that re that wouldn't solve the problem and and because there'd be a greater problem on the other side of death and er and he took he took it and he he said to me he said i i can't live the way i'm living i can't sleep i haven't slept in days and days and weeks and i got all these addictions and he just couldn't sleep and so i just told myself patrick look it we prayed and i said when you it was what did did you bring him over billy and after and i said billy will give you something to listen to and something to read so billy looks in there and he's and he's sitting in his car and billy had some books there and he told patrick just take one of these books and read it well patrick grabbed demonology of god you see god is going to give you something to build your faith he duck he's not talking to you about intellectually taking a scripture and believing it like an encyclopedia he's not asking you to believe he's asking you to believe in him because he is the word he is what he promises [Music] but because it's by those promises you're partakers of divine nature so he's not asking you to have faith in a mind game or the faith in the word of god every person that's in here whether you're living right for god or not or whether you're in the valley of decision god somewhere sometime in your life knocked on your heart because the scripture says you have not chosen me i have chosen you and that's what he wants you to build your faith on is what he's done for you i'm glad god convicts me of sin amen the scripture tells us do not don't be discouraged when you're chastised because he loves those who chastise us that's the grace and beauty of god and so patrick grabbed it and billy gave him some tapes and all of a sudden one day i i see him coming across the parking lot and i wonder how he's doing he looks so much better and he comes up to me says pastor i can't sleep i thought i prayed for you that you sleep he says no he says it's those tapes i just listen to them and i can't turn them off i just love to hear the word of god it's such a blessing amen praise god now he's got something where his faith rests it wasn't a paper promise you understand it was an experience of god knocking on his heart you know how when you got your healing was in that day at home when you listened to that word and that word touched you and you came to this church and you walked up in front of this congregation and she says i can't fight it anymore what i'm hearing is truth you know you know we think we muster up healing healing is a part of it when you accepted it you accepted your healing that's the place he wants you to put your faith in it's in the experience he doesn't get you where okay if you believe work it up very good no he gives you the experience the people that have had faith and have accomplished something were people who had an experience he says it behooves us to have an experience before faith can ever accomplish very much think of it sometimes we abandon the birth that we had and that's the foundation of our faith you can read these scriptures every day and it will never build your faith but if you know that you pass from death on the life and you know he called you he know you know he saved you you know that he's the the one that you're eternally secure with now it's on that basis of faith that you ask it's not a proof whether you're a believer or not your name was on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he gave you an experience what happened to david when i was tending my father's sheep out there when i walked down through the green pastures and by the still waters i learned of a god who made the heavens and earth what happened to david he had an experience he meant god i learned of god who made the heavens and earth and i was responsible for my papa's few sheep and a bear run in and grabbed one and i slew him and a lion ran in and grabbed a kid and took off and i knocked him down with my slingshot and when he raised up i grabbed him by the beard and slew him he said the god that delivered the bear and the lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised philistine into my hands the god that saved me from the sin the god that came into my life and took me from madness to joy from no hope to eternal life that's the god that i believe is with me he said that god this uncircumcised certainly he knew what he was talking about he had faith in god he had an experience to see what god would do therefore he knew that experience would carry him to victory can you imagine any greater thing god could do for you than give you eternal life that's why you can say i got financial trouble the god who saved me the god who changed my nature the god who introduced himself to me and called me for sin that's the person that's the god that's going to deliver me out of this crisis but if you if you don't have that you're trying to read a paper promise and kind of come up with something to make it work it works because of what he did for you it works because of the experience he gave you it works because of the blood that bought you it's part of that what you have need of is part of the salvation he gave you when he laid the foundation for your life that's where it's at it's because of that that's why you can ask i never asked to be saved no i'm saying that for me i never asked to be saved he came down in my life drove me to my knees by putting me in a situation i could not escape without him and he squeezed me so hard that i finally cried out god help me god help me i don't know what i am but i'm not this many of you are raised in the truth and you know what it's like to run from that truth and you know what that truth comes when it comes haunting you and finally brings you to the place in that secret place of your heart where you go i know this is true that's where it begins if we can't be sure of that how are we going to be sure of all the things that we need brother chris you know how it was sitting at that desk that day he's working away making that money selling that stuff just doing great out of the middle of nowhere sitting at his desk a spirit drops down could i use the word undone and he comes totally undone breaks down balling out over a desk crying out because now he needs god now chris wasn't sitting there going wait a minute god's gonna drop down give me salation hallelujah he was going to go to the gym and bench that 375 pounds or 550 or whatever he bench passed and he's going to do this and he was going to do that and in a twinkling of an eye in a moment the spirit of god dropped down and changed them just like that that's what you believe from the prophet god said before it behooves us to have a born-again experience because faith has got to have a place that rests and it rests on the word of god it's the father's perfect will that all men be saved it says the lord appeared to nathan and said go tell my servant david i know he was just a little ruddy thing i know he was wearing sheep coat but i took him away from that cheap coat and made him ruler over my people and gave him a name like great men of the earth how god seen that sincerity of faith to believe him upon an experience that he was the living god how little it was for abraham after he had endured endured as seeing him whom was invisible how after he meant god and had an experience of talking face to face with god that he could call those things which were not as though they were for he had an experience he had talked to god face to face that's what we need is a personal experience with the living god why try to go do things when the answers in the personal experience don't struggle on your own if you need to overcome go get personal yes sir that's right if you need an answer go get personal when he called you you didn't call him or choose him he chose you my sheep know my voice all that the father hath given me will come if i start a work in you i will finish it to the end see we we we're trying to muster up a faith we're trying to come up with something that's intellectual and every promise came with him is those promises he is that word they they don't sit they don't sit separate from him it's his person that heals you don't heal yourself by your faith that's what they crawled out called out to him o physician heal thyself he said i'm not going to heal me i'm going to heal the whole world they're in him so when he knocked on your door he just wasn't knocking with salvation he was knocking with every attribute that he was your healing your deliverance you're being taken care of your food your clothing everything it was all in him and why did paul says why did you begin in faith and then are so easily moved to theology how that after moses having 40 years of religious training by his mother having 40 years of military might in his hands of how to whoop a nation how to conquer and it taken god 40 years to take it out of him but once out there in the wilderness alone one day he came face to face with god and in a burning bush and he was better equipped in five minutes after he had talked with god then 80 years of schooling had done anything to him if you've had an experience with god everything you need came with that experience because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it was samson with a jawbone of a mule that killed a thousand philistines because he had an experience that he was born again he had an experience that he was a nazarite the god of heaven was with him faith is the last thing that we're going to possess it is the gift of god lest any man should boast it was god's gift to you like we read in ephesians by grace we are saved it was the gift of god and everything that he was he gave to you and you can't if there's anything that is important for us to do it's to go back and visit the day of our salvation the day the tears ran down our cheeks the day he lifted that ton of bricks and embrace him again on the grounds that he embraced you because he's never forgot that first hug he's never forgot the day that he put you in the palm of his hand and promised you nothing will pluck you out i will not leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even in you till the end you can meet that god how do you know you know if he's tugging at your heart i i've been a christian 50 some years and i know when the spirit of god comes down and convicts me of sin i can feel it from my toes to my head i can sit there and vibrate in that presence knowing that he knows knowing i haven't done anything that he doesn't see that i'm totally exposed in his presence and you know what he does he invites me to repent he invites me to cry abba father he invites me to make it right he didn't come to torch me he come to invite me back into his kingdom come back to where there's peace come back to where there's power come back to faith come back to believing in what i did for you in the first place because when i started that work i'm going to finish it and nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand i hope you'll listen to me this morning and many times i didn't and the next time the visitation was a little rougher and then it followed with something else and finally he brings me back like the prodigal son he finally brings us to ourselves so we're gonna have to have faith faith is another sense it's just like hearing and seeing it's something you know you've experienced it's something that's a substance it's something that's real and i just wanted to just share it this morning to encourage you to bring to life the faith that brought you to life in the beginning the same faith that you believed the day you saved is the same faith you use for every promise in the book what did you do to be saved nothing but what he did for you that day entitles you to every promise in the book god bless you this morning let's stand let our faith grow as our musicians softly play so [Music] [Music] it's just our heads and ask yourself am i living this morning in the kingdom of god by faith am i trusting my total existence in his hands do i know that there's an eternal reward that awaits me or do i find myself out on the middle ground i find myself not sold out to either and there's spoken of a scripture of faith that can move mountains a faith that i could pray and receive what i asked for a faith that pleases god a faith that believes that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him and i trust the holy spirit this very person of jesus christ himself is coming by and knocking on your heart and inviting you to trust him if you have a need in your life i could pray for you and we could join our faith together and god honors that or you yourself could place it into his hands you could take the eyes of your heart and look straight on this person and say lord i need deliverance from a critical spirit lord i need deliverance in my body lord i need a mended heart lord i know you're here because i feel you touching me [Music] you say well i don't feel anything if you'd like to invite him say lord i'm sitting here and i don't feel a thing would you come near to me and make your presence known lord i don't want a journey in this life not knowing where i'm going would you make my salvation a reality to me will we make the reward of eternal life become so real to me that's all i live for lord i'm not going to make the rest of this journey with satan gaining the power he's gaining without having faith in you and your word lord like the little man that lay there in desperation he said oh god help my unbelief lord help our unbelief this morning let us rise with the wings of the eagle lord lord we've got two choices we can walk by sight or we can walk by faith we can believe what you said or he can believe the paper the radio show the government whose kingdoms we know are of the devil because he offered them and there's one thing we know about that devil he's a liar and the father of all lies and there's no truth in them wouldn't you desire this morning to come to the truth the true word of god if you have request would you just slip your hand up not to me to him my hands raised my head is bowed and would you pray lord jesus i am too long to be closer to you i long to have more faith in your kingdom lord i want to live by the laws of faith and i want to live by the laws of promise i want to live in your kingdom where joy is unspeakable [Music] father where your peace or pathos

accept the offering of my lifted hand and to hear my cry and to come and touch my life and transform me father [Music] from a life of fear to a life of faith from a life of hate to a life of love that
