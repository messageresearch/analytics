[30:21] in prayer heavenly father we're not
[30:23] worthy to stand in your presence
[30:26] we're not worthy to handle your word
[30:34] father our only
[30:36] place that
[30:37] we can meet you is
[30:39] under the shed blood
[30:42] which
[30:43] forgives us and cleanses us from all
[30:45] unrighteousness and
[30:48] father takes our failures and throws him
[30:51] into the sea of forgetfulness to be
[30:53] remembered no more
[30:56] lifts us up
[30:58] out of the
[30:59] mirey clay and
[31:01] lord that's where our faith and our
[31:04] trust is tonight and
[31:06] just want to have a time of fellowship
[31:08] with you
[31:09] we ask you to bless each of those that
[31:11] have come out this evening father may
[31:13] you be their portion
[31:15] in jesus name we pray
[31:17] amen
[31:18] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[31:20] let's just turn to one quick scripture
[31:23] and
[31:24] and we'll read it and then we're going
[31:26] to play
[31:27] a small portion tonight
[31:29] of a sermon and just fellowship
[31:32] around god's word
[31:36] i had a wonderful trip with my mother
[31:39] and
[31:40] i'm just grateful to have her and
[31:43] you know i began to think so many of my
[31:46] friends
[31:48] they don't have their parents
[31:50] anymore
[31:51] and very rarely do i ever meet anybody
[31:54] that i went to high school with or
[31:56] i went to school with that has their
[31:59] parents still with them but i'm
[32:00] fortunate still to have my mother so i
[32:03] wanted to thank the lord for that
[32:05] hebrews the 11th chapter
[32:08] verse 1.
[32:09] i bet you everybody in here has that
[32:11] memorized
[32:14] you just don't know where it is
[32:16] but
[32:17] let's just read it this evening
[32:20] now
[32:21] faith is the substance
[32:24] of things hoped for
[32:25] the evidence of things not
[32:29] seen
[32:31] for by it the elders obtained a good
[32:34] report
[32:36] through faith we understand that the
[32:39] worlds were framed
[32:41] by the word of god
[32:43] so that things which are seen
[32:46] were not made of things which do appear
[32:51] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[32:53] excellent sacrifice than cain
[32:56] by which he obtained witness
[32:59] that he was righteous
[33:01] god testifying of his gift
[33:05] and by it
[33:06] he being dead yet speaketh
[33:10] by faith enoch was translated that he
[33:13] should not see death
[33:15] and was not found
[33:17] because god had translated him
[33:21] for before his translation he had this
[33:24] testimony that he pleased god
[33:27] but without faith it is impossible to
[33:31] please him
[33:32] for he that cometh to god
[33:35] must believe that he is and that he is a
[33:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[33:43] him heavenly father we ask you to bless
[33:45] your word in jesus precious name we pray
[33:49] amen
[33:50] you may be seated
[33:57] i'd like just to
[34:01] share my heart with you
[34:03] just a little bit and
[34:06] the uh
[34:10] struggles that
[34:13] that i
[34:15] suffer in my mind
[34:17] as a pastor in the battles that
[34:21] that we all go through we know the
[34:23] battles in the mind and
[34:25] and so you find out that
[34:29] we just read the scriptures by faith
[34:32] the elders obtained a good report
[34:36] and
[34:37] if i could substitute the word faith
[34:40] i'd like to put the word absolute
[34:43] by having an absolute
[34:46] at
[34:48] faith is based on
[34:50] having an absolute
[34:52] and and i like how paul sums it up
[34:56] he said
[34:57] uh faith must believe that god is
[35:01] in other words that god's my absolute
[35:04] that god is and he's a rewarder of them
[35:07] that diligently seek him
[35:10] so we
[35:11] know
[35:12] that
[35:12] if we seek his face
[35:14] that we shall find it
[35:16] that
[35:17] by faith by having an absolute that's
[35:21] what pleases god
[35:23] and you know one of the great uh
[35:26] struggles that
[35:29] i we face a lot of times as a pastor is
[35:33] you know
[35:34] as a shepherd you and a pastor it's like
[35:37] a title
[35:38] that you
[35:39] that people place upon you
[35:41] that you know you don't deserve you
[35:43] haven't done anything
[35:46] to achieve it or you haven't you don't
[35:49] have any qualifications
[35:52] to carry it because gifts and callings
[35:55] are without repentance
[35:57] it just seems that god
[36:00] places you in a situation
[36:04] and one of the things we all know that a
[36:07] shepherd does
[36:09] is that he
[36:11] and i'm talking about a natural shepherd
[36:13] and which we know is a type of
[36:16] of uh
[36:18] as a spiritual shepherd is that you're
[36:21] always trying to keep things from coming
[36:25] in
[36:26] and you're always trying to keep things
[36:29] out
[36:30] so you're always trying to get ideas not
[36:33] coming in you're always trying to keep
[36:36] spirits from going gossiping to uh
[36:40] to going on you know and
[36:43] and and you you try to you know
[36:46] have everybody
[36:48] love everything and it seems like you
[36:50] you know you're you're you're taking
[36:52] care of the things that are
[36:55] all the things that are going on
[36:58] you know you don't want the wolves to
[36:59] come and take any sheep away so you're
[37:02] always looking for wolves and
[37:04] and that you know you don't want the
[37:06] sheep to be biting each other
[37:08] you know what i mean forming clicks and
[37:11] and you know i know we got all kinds of
[37:13] little girly clicks going on and certain
[37:16] girlies hang out with certain girlies
[37:19] and certain girlies aren't old enough
[37:21] and certain languages do this and all
[37:23] that you know wait until the holy spirit
[37:26] comes you know what i mean and the love
[37:29] of god is shed abroad in your heart you
[37:31] know and i you know i had a fella come
[37:34] in and after we walked into my office
[37:36] and he stood at the door and he looked
[37:38] at me and he said well i don't know if i
[37:40] can i should come into here
[37:44] i said wait a minute buddy come on in
[37:46] here you know what i mean because we
[37:48] don't got nothing like that we don't
[37:50] have any big eyes we don't have any
[37:53] little use we we don't have those things
[37:56] we're all under the shed blood
[37:59] and so
[38:01] in in always dealing with those things
[38:04] but there there comes a time
[38:08] when you realize that the the flock
[38:11] can't stay
[38:13] in the same field
[38:16] you understand they've got to move on
[38:20] to greener pastures
[38:22] they've got to to move on
[38:25] and i don't say new grass
[38:28] i say the grass that god has prepared
[38:31] for them to go to
[38:34] and we know that that lies within the
[38:38] framework of the word of god
[38:41] so i liked how
[38:44] brother billy put it sunday
[38:47] he said there's not any new revelation
[38:51] there's just revelations we haven't come
[38:53] to yet
[38:55] you you understand there's there's
[38:57] things that
[38:58] there's people that have an experience
[39:01] you know i uh
[39:03] you know for someone to
[39:06] uh i like it when sometimes when i see a
[39:08] young
[39:09] uh young
[39:11] couples or
[39:12] and and uh they're going through the
[39:15] struggle of raising children and i sit
[39:17] back and i think well you know that they
[39:20] have this struggle because those
[39:22] children are going to grow into
[39:23] teenagers
[39:26] you know
[39:27] and after you raise a few teenagers
[39:30] satan never bothers you again you think
[39:33] you can handle anything
[39:34] you know what i mean because you've been
[39:36] through that you've had the experience
[39:39] you know it i mean and then you then
[39:41] other things come
[39:43] up forth in life and and you realize
[39:47] that if the lord carried that uh
[39:50] you know your
[39:52] that the end of what you've accomplished
[39:54] i remember the prophet of god saying
[39:56] that when he said i'm 55 years old and i
[40:00] haven't done anything
[40:02] for the lord
[40:04] now
[40:05] that statement devastates me
[40:09] you know what i mean
[40:11] and you know i'll never be able to match
[40:14] that i don't try to match that
[40:16] but
[40:17] uh
[40:18] you know just the fact that having
[40:20] something on our heart be at that time
[40:22] in life you start asking yourself what
[40:25] have i done
[40:27] what's my future what am i going to
[40:29] leave behind
[40:31] you know what am i leaving for
[40:34] you know what what footsteps steps do i
[40:37] have
[40:38] in
[40:39] in the sands of time and so
[40:42] in in the uh
[40:45] a struggle
[40:47] of realizing that
[40:50] you've always tried to stay balanced
[40:53] you realize we we need to go up higher
[40:57] we all want to go up higher i think it's
[40:59] the call of everybody's heart to be
[41:02] closer to god to have a greater
[41:04] fellowship with the lord to to
[41:08] you know
[41:10] not to put to rest our salvation that
[41:14] we've been purchased with a price to
[41:16] accept the fact that our names are
[41:18] written on the lamb's book of life to
[41:21] accept the fact that the footsteps of
[41:23] the righteous are ordered by the lord
[41:26] and so we want to move forward
[41:30] and we want to achieve something
[41:33] and we want to have the faith
[41:36] to achieve it
[41:38] and
[41:39] and
[41:40] and
[41:41] it brought me to this message is
[41:45] that we'll listen to
[41:46] for 19 minutes
[41:48] but it's called an absolute
[41:51] and and and you'll hear in this message
[41:54] that you can't achieve anything until
[41:58] you have an absolute
[42:01] um
[42:02] and you know uh
[42:05] and
[42:06] so
[42:07] you
[42:08] you can't move forward
[42:11] until
[42:13] there's something that's absolute that's
[42:16] moving us forward
[42:19] and when you have something that's
[42:21] absolute i think the dictionary calls it
[42:24] perfect within itself
[42:27] so something that is absolute brother
[42:29] brown will say that when we listen but
[42:32] he says it's perfect within itself
[42:36] and and
[42:37] you know and i thought what a beautiful
[42:40] description of the message it's perfect
[42:43] within itself it doesn't need anything
[42:47] from the outside to improve it
[42:50] in fact nothing can add to it
[42:54] i believe brother graham said i'm not
[42:56] delinquent enough to try to say
[43:00] that i can advise god whether he's done
[43:04] something right or not
[43:07] but in order to go forward
[43:10] you've got to have
[43:12] an absolute that's right so you've got
[43:15] to accept something as an absolute right
[43:19] in other words
[43:20] you you don't
[43:22] it's it's not
[43:25] absolute if you feel
[43:28] that there's something you can add to it
[43:30] it's not absolute if you feel that it's
[43:34] left something out
[43:36] it's not absolute if you think it hasn't
[43:40] covered a certain area
[43:42] and i say that because a lot what's
[43:45] going on today is satan's brought
[43:47] bringing all kinds of things in and
[43:50] people make this statement to me well
[43:53] brother branham didn't cover that
[43:58] and
[43:59] then you're telling me that it's not
[44:02] perfect within itself
[44:07] do you understand
[44:08] the thing is is that
[44:10] that is a door
[44:13] that opens up
[44:15] so somebody that has an absolute is not
[44:19] open for any new ideas because the
[44:22] definition of an absolute within itself
[44:26] is it's
[44:27] perfect
[44:28] it's perfect in itself it didn't like
[44:31] doesn't lack anything it didn't leave
[44:34] anything out that
[44:37] it's it can't be questioned
[44:39] it's settled
[44:41] it's complete
[44:43] and and therefore okay when someone says
[44:46] well he didn't mention this he didn't
[44:48] cover this
[44:49] you're you're if it's an absolute
[44:52] then you know somewhere within there it
[44:56] is covered
[44:59] but i need the revelation
[45:02] i need god to speak to me from the
[45:05] absolute
[45:06] and that he might cover
[45:09] the question that i have
[45:12] and so the first thing is is that uh
[45:17] or someone who has an absolute
[45:20] knows that that's going to determine the
[45:22] outcome
[45:23] the absolute is going to determine the
[45:26] outcome
[45:27] there's no other factors no other
[45:30] circumstances no other situations
[45:33] no no nothing from the outside that's
[45:37] going to come in and change the course
[45:39] of the events because the absolute is
[45:41] perfect within itself and we know what
[45:44] our absolute is it's the word of god
[45:48] this message is not something that comes
[45:51] from outside of the word of god it is
[45:54] the word promised for our hour
[45:57] made flesh
[45:59] that's what makes it the absolute it is
[46:03] what god said
[46:05] manifested in the flesh and by the grace
[46:08] of god he's given us eyes have to see it
[46:13] [Music]
[46:15] until
[46:16] it becomes
[46:19] this
[46:20] the settlement
[46:23] of all things right
[46:25] and he'll go on we're not going to
[46:27] listen to that portion of it but he said
[46:29] that's why in games they have to have a
[46:32] an umpire
[46:34] because every has anybody ever played
[46:37] pickup ball
[46:39] that's a game where you do it you call
[46:41] your own fouls
[46:42] well any time a guy misses a shot
[46:45] somebody fouled them
[46:48] you know what i mean and
[46:50] and uh
[46:51] it it it it's terrible
[46:55] so they have to create man in order to
[46:58] move
[47:00] the game along
[47:03] if you understand we're talking about
[47:04] going forward so in order to move along
[47:07] to keep the game going
[47:10] you know what i mean they have to get
[47:12] somebody to arbitrate the disputes and
[47:15] settle them and that person's decision
[47:19] has to be finally
[47:24] you understand
[47:26] yeah and the world doesn't even want an
[47:28] absolute anymore
[47:32] they want a video
[47:34] replay or let's look at it again and
[47:38] and everything well god don't have to
[47:41] look at something again
[47:45] because being perfect in itself
[47:49] he's the one that made it happen in the
[47:52] first place
[47:56] okay so we're talking about we want to
[47:58] go forward so i'm sitting here with you
[48:02] very
[48:04] proud of everybody proud of the way you
[48:07] worship proud of the way everybody
[48:09] handles things proud of the way you love
[48:11] one another uh proud of the way you
[48:14] treat one another knowing that you're
[48:16] solid in the word and
[48:18] you we and
[48:20] we're not letting wolves come in
[48:23] we all have failures but we repent of
[48:25] those we get up we make things right but
[48:29] we still want to go forward
[48:33] so in order to do that
[48:36] we've got to establish
[48:38] an absolute
[48:40] something by which we are going to move
[48:43] forward
[48:46] do you understand so i believe it's
[48:48] coming to a point
[48:50] it it doesn't do
[48:53] any good
[48:54] to
[48:55] i saw a cartoon one time
[48:58] and you know it was sketch
[49:01] i think it was in a some bible bookstore
[49:04] and it showed moses and joshua way out
[49:08] here
[49:08] and and they they said oh let's stop
[49:13] and let the people catch up so they sat
[49:17] down to have a picnic you know
[49:19] and drink and they were sitting there
[49:21] and you look back and the people
[49:23] had all sat down
[49:27] okay
[49:28] well we've moved past that
[49:33] you understand we're not following a
[49:36] ministry
[49:37] anymore
[49:38] another
[49:40] i i'm not
[49:41] i'm not taking the leadership
[49:44] position
[49:47] and saying now this is what i'm going to
[49:49] preach and this is where we're going to
[49:51] go
[49:51] because if that's the case
[49:55] then
[49:56] there's
[49:57] a mediator there's something in between
[50:00] god and the people and god hated that
[50:04] but you understand if it's an absolute
[50:08] then it could it should speak to all of
[50:11] us together
[50:15] you understand it shouldn't be something
[50:17] that
[50:18] that has to be broke down
[50:20] you don't understand now the word of god
[50:22] is broke down to each of us as we go
[50:25] because he does have a five-fold
[50:26] ministry but i'm in as a desire and
[50:30] of the body
[50:32] to move into the ground that god has
[50:35] prepared for us each of us has to have
[50:40] an
[50:41] an absolute that's right
[50:42] or it may even more be more specific not
[50:45] a absolute
[50:47] the absolute
[50:49] each of us has got to have the same
[50:51] absolute so when it speaks
[50:54] we all agree on it
[50:57] when it's revealed it's all the same
[51:00] revelation
[51:03] you apply that to your lives separately
[51:06] as you need it in your life and as the
[51:08] word of god is applied to you
[51:10] individually but as the body it speaks
[51:14] it is the word of god it is our absolute
[51:18] amen
[51:19] and so
[51:20] the that that's what determines the
[51:22] outcome
[51:24] so if we were to go forward what's going
[51:26] to determine our outcome what the
[51:28] absolute said right
[51:31] that that's what our outcome
[51:33] and there's no distractions
[51:38] you know
[51:39] uh
[51:40] and and that's the thing if when you've
[51:42] got an absolute you're you're not
[51:44] you're not
[51:46] distracting what's this
[51:48] people doing or what's this people doing
[51:51] how are they going about how are they
[51:53] worshiping how are they doing how are
[51:55] they that doesn't matter that's right
[51:59] you understand the the that's not
[52:03] we don't look out
[52:06] because if it is an absolute to you
[52:10] then it has
[52:13] you don't look any further than that
[52:15] could i say that that it it's it's
[52:18] captured you
[52:23] i i it's it's it's captured me
[52:28] i i've seen a lot of movements
[52:32] in the years that i've been in the
[52:34] message coming up
[52:36] different people who
[52:38] who
[52:40] caught certain ideas
[52:42] and and preach different things and i'm
[52:45] not going to go through all the labels
[52:48] that they put on them
[52:50] but the bottom line is is the reason
[52:53] they were all different is they all
[52:55] didn't have the same absolute
[53:00] the unity of the bride
[53:03] is based in
[53:06] the absoluteness
[53:08] of the absolute
[53:12] you are so they're they're not
[53:14] they're not looking for another place of
[53:16] interpretation
[53:18] so if they don't understand something
[53:21] they have their source
[53:23] so if you don't understand something
[53:25] within the message
[53:27] where do you think the understanding
[53:29] lies
[53:31] within the message
[53:35] that's where you'll find the answer
[53:38] to the problem
[53:42] it's like any of you brother i think we
[53:43] got several electricians in here you
[53:46] know
[53:47] you know
[53:48] so
[53:49] let's just take uh
[53:51] i don't know if daniel's here but
[53:53] daniel's electrician and troy's
[53:55] electrician jay's electrician okay if
[53:57] you've got an electrical problem in a
[53:59] building you don't go next door
[54:04] they say well what are you doing here
[54:06] well they got a short next door
[54:11] the problems within the system
[54:15] so the answer is within the system
[54:19] you can't look to any outside
[54:21] source for
[54:23] the solving of the problem
[54:27] so when someone when
[54:28] once you're sure it's the absolute
[54:32] then you know the problem isn't here it
[54:35] may be within you
[54:37] but it's complete and perfect in itself
[54:40] so if there's a lack of understanding in
[54:43] there you've got you'll find the answer
[54:46] to
[54:47] your lack of understanding within the
[54:50] absolute itself message answers message
[54:54] questions
[54:59] that's what that's what answers it
[55:01] that's what takes care of it
[55:04] so once you have an absolute there's no
[55:06] distraction you're closed
[55:10] to any new ideas
[55:16] well billy really
[55:19] brother branham left this part out
[55:22] i want to let me show you here now
[55:25] you see here over here he said this and
[55:28] and really
[55:30] you know
[55:31] jesus
[55:32] was a a a man and
[55:35] and uh but he and uh over here but the
[55:38] there is the there is
[55:40] the uh there's not two people there's
[55:43] only two in the godhead jesus and god
[55:46] are one but there is another person
[55:48] called the holy spirit
[55:52] now just think about that for a while
[55:59] wait a minute
[56:01] even to conceive that
[56:04] is the sign there's no absolute
[56:07] an absolute closes your mind
[56:14] there's
[56:15] not an open mind
[56:18] eve
[56:19] opened her mind
[56:24] you understand the fact that
[56:27] he said the day that ye eat thereof the
[56:30] day you died
[56:32] that wasn't absolute enough for her
[56:40] okay
[56:43] if if that was if that would have been
[56:45] absolute enough
[56:48] she would have known that that statement
[56:50] was perfect within itself
[56:52] it didn't have to have understanding
[56:58] because
[56:59] understanding
[57:01] doesn't come from an outside source
[57:06] understanding has to come from the
[57:09] absolute itself if it's perfect
[57:15] is there
[57:16] i don't know how i wish i could make
[57:18] that
[57:19] so clear
[57:20] you might have questions
[57:24] somebody might raise questions
[57:28] but they're not i i don't let anybody
[57:31] raise a question with me
[57:34] if they're raising the question because
[57:36] they have the answer
[57:38] to the question
[57:40] that's a deceiver
[57:43] that's a liar
[57:45] [Music]
[57:46] someone why don't you just tell me the
[57:49] answer first i don't need to be baited
[57:54] you know what i mean i don't be needed
[57:56] to be persuaded
[57:59] into it it's like sitting down with a
[58:02] salesperson and you ask them how much it
[58:05] cost
[58:07] and their answer is well how much do you
[58:09] make
[58:13] well i'm broke will you give it to me
[58:18] do you understand
[58:21] you're not baited
[58:23] you understand so when you have an
[58:26] absolute
[58:27] it
[58:28] the absolute speaks plainly
[58:35] it
[58:37] when you have an absolute
[58:39] it speaks plainly to you now you say why
[58:43] is this important
[58:45] because
[58:48] you can't go together
[58:51] and go on together
[58:54] and rise together
[58:56] if we don't all have the same absolute
[59:01] we don't have the same thing that's
[59:03] covering us
[59:04] if we're not if we're close to different
[59:08] ideas
[59:09] you know i don't like to compete
[59:13] with counseling
[59:16] i don't like to counsel somebody and
[59:17] then have somebody else come along and
[59:19] counsel them you know and have a church
[59:21] full of 50 different counselors that's
[59:23] fine
[59:27] everybody's entitled to their opinion
[59:30] it's like a nose
[59:33] everybody has one
[59:37] you know what i mean
[59:38] and we all value our opinions
[59:41] above one another
[59:44] and by that point sometimes we think of
[59:47] ourselves
[59:48] better
[59:49] than one another
[59:51] but when you have an absolute
[59:54] everybody
[59:56] is
[59:57] the
[59:58] same
[1:00:00] we've all been purchased by the same
[1:00:03] blood
[1:00:04] it didn't take any more blood for me or
[1:00:08] any less blood for you
[1:00:11] so in understanding an absolute
[1:00:14] you understand that
[1:00:16] they where was their faith
[1:00:20] resting in
[1:00:22] every single one of them had an absolute
[1:00:26] something that was absolute
[1:00:29] perfect within itself to them
[1:00:34] and as brother brahm reads the scripture
[1:00:37] about paul meatman that
[1:00:40] commission
[1:00:42] when paul meant that fire pillar fire
[1:00:45] that became the absolute to him
[1:00:49] everything he was going to encounter was
[1:00:52] based upon
[1:00:54] what
[1:00:55] back
[1:00:56] angel of the lord
[1:00:58] spoke to him
[1:01:00] that settled it when he was in prison he
[1:01:02] knew he would have to suffer suffer when
[1:01:05] he had to go before rome he knew he had
[1:01:07] to go between before king's impotent day
[1:01:11] because that became as absolute
[1:01:14] nothing deterred him from his path
[1:01:16] nothing deterred him nothing deterred
[1:01:18] abraham
[1:01:20] from looking for that child because he
[1:01:23] had accepted the promise and the word of
[1:01:26] god as his absolute right abraham
[1:01:30] it was imputed to abraham righteousness
[1:01:33] was imputed to abraham because he
[1:01:36] believed that god was able to perform
[1:01:39] that which he promised therefore his
[1:01:42] whole life was based on the fact that
[1:01:45] god's word was perfect
[1:01:48] within itself
[1:01:52] now when he succumbed to
[1:01:55] sarah
[1:01:57] trying to come up with a different
[1:01:59] program
[1:02:00] that never did work
[1:02:02] and they got a bunch of wild men that
[1:02:05] have been trying to put them out of an
[1:02:06] existence ever since
[1:02:10] so we can save ourselves lots of trouble
[1:02:14] by
[1:02:15] assuring in our heart
[1:02:17] and i say this to our young people
[1:02:20] you know like i said you you went you
[1:02:22] had a great experience
[1:02:24] in the lord in the and you've heard
[1:02:26] about the holy spirit you heard about a
[1:02:28] delivering power
[1:02:30] and you felt anointed and you felt free
[1:02:33] from your sins and and you felt a great
[1:02:36] release and and a great worship and
[1:02:39] everything but in order to move forward
[1:02:44] you can't achieve anything and you can't
[1:02:46] move forward until you have an absolute
[1:02:51] something that you know is perfect
[1:02:53] within itself
[1:02:55] now brother brown preaches this message
[1:02:57] in absolute
[1:02:59] right before he preaches the evening
[1:03:02] service serves as this is this the end
[1:03:05] time sirs
[1:03:09] because he's going to start talking
[1:03:11] about angels coming to him he's going to
[1:03:13] start talking about the seals being open
[1:03:16] and his ministry is making the turn from
[1:03:19] december preaching an absolute he goes
[1:03:22] out and he preaches the absolute four
[1:03:24] more different places to telling
[1:03:27] everything some if if you don't have an
[1:03:30] absolute you're going to miss the
[1:03:32] opening of the seals you're going to
[1:03:34] miss the coming of the lord you're going
[1:03:36] to miss what god's doing
[1:03:40] well
[1:03:41] we have got to
[1:03:43] really and our young people that had a
[1:03:46] wonderful experience at camp worshiping
[1:03:48] everything
[1:03:49] after that it's maturing time
[1:03:54] where you've got to choose in your life
[1:03:57] what is going to be your absolute and
[1:03:59] what you're going to shut
[1:04:02] everything else
[1:04:04] out of your mind
[1:04:06] except for the ultimate
[1:04:09] the absolute
[1:04:10] so presenting this this is good
[1:04:14] brother ron peterson a friend of mine is
[1:04:17] going to be coming and
[1:04:19] and preaching for us this sunday
[1:04:21] but so i wanted just to lay this as a
[1:04:24] foundation so we all search our heart
[1:04:29] and ask yourself
[1:04:32] do i really have an absolute
[1:04:37] you know
[1:04:38] i think in the world don't they call it
[1:04:40] like a go-to
[1:04:41] or they have a terminology this is my
[1:04:43] go-to meal or my go-to thing when i'm in
[1:04:47] doubt this is what i go to
[1:04:49] well this is above
[1:04:51] everything that's a go-to it's perfect
[1:04:54] with itself so let's listen to this
[1:04:57] 19 minutes
[1:04:59] of the absolute
[1:05:01] and uh
[1:05:03] and then we'll close very quickly
[1:05:07] at the end so we're going to start at
[1:05:09] the reading of the scriptures
[1:05:11] if you'd like to stand for this reading
[1:05:13] of the scriptures you can go ahead and
[1:05:15] if you'll turn in your bibles i believe
[1:05:17] it's to acts 23
[1:05:20] um uh
[1:05:25] the acts uh i i believe it's acts 26 the
[1:05:28] 15th verse
[1:05:33] that's what brother brown has in the
[1:05:35] book here so
[1:05:36] i think that's correct so if the
[1:05:38] brothers if you could go ahead
[1:05:40] and
[1:05:42] start this
[1:05:43] now just listening close to the next 19
[1:05:46] minutes
[1:05:52] and what we're preaching about is what
[1:05:54] an absolute does for you thank you
[1:06:04] now tonight don't forget
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] the time what time is it
[1:06:11] and now
[1:06:14] this morning i wish to turn
[1:06:16] you to have your bibles or market
[1:06:19] if you care to
[1:06:21] in the scriptures
[1:06:23] or we want to speak from uh
[1:06:26] for a few moments
[1:06:28] found in the book of acts
[1:06:31] we might read two or three places
[1:06:34] uh acts 26 15 first
[1:06:38] acts the 25th chapter
[1:06:41] and the 15th verse to begin then we want
[1:06:44] to read acts 23 11
[1:06:48] and you might add with this if you wish
[1:06:50] to i probably won't have time to read it
[1:06:52] of philippians 1 20.
[1:06:55] it's all about the same course the same
[1:06:58] words
[1:07:00] now
[1:07:02] in the
[1:07:03] book of acts
[1:07:06] 26
[1:07:07] 15 we reads like this
[1:07:11] and i said who art thou lord
[1:07:15] and he said i'm jesus whom thou
[1:07:18] persecute
[1:07:20] arise
[1:07:21] and stand up on thy feet for i have
[1:07:24] appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:07:28] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:07:30] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:07:33] and uh those things
[1:07:35] in the which i will appear unto thee
[1:07:40] deliver thee from the people and from
[1:07:43] the gentiles
[1:07:45] whom now i send thee
[1:07:48] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:07:51] darkness to light and from the power of
[1:07:53] satan unto god
[1:07:55] that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:07:57] sins and inheritance among them which
[1:08:00] are sanctified by faith
[1:08:03] that is in me
[1:08:07] whereupon ogrippa i was not disobedient
[1:08:10] to the heavenly vision
[1:08:13] but showed first unto them at damascus
[1:08:16] and at jerusalem and throughout all the
[1:08:18] coast of judea
[1:08:20] and them
[1:08:21] then to the gentiles
[1:08:23] that they should repent and turn to god
[1:08:26] and do
[1:08:28] works meet
[1:08:29] for
[1:08:31] repentance
[1:08:33] and acts
[1:08:35] 23
[1:08:38] and the 11th verse
[1:08:41] again
[1:08:43] and
[1:08:44] the night following the lord stood by
[1:08:47] him and said
[1:08:49] be of a good cheer paul
[1:08:52] for thou has testified of me in
[1:08:54] jerusalem
[1:08:56] so must thou bear witness also at rome
[1:09:01] may god add his
[1:09:04] holy blessings to the reading of this
[1:09:08] uh most gracious holy word that we have
[1:09:11] before us
[1:09:14] now
[1:09:16] i was hearing a man speak or talk not
[1:09:19] long ago and he used the word absolute
[1:09:24] and i thought that's a very fine word i
[1:09:27] hear you so many times absolutely
[1:09:31] that's i looked up in the dictionary
[1:09:35] webster's
[1:09:36] according to webster's
[1:09:39] it's perfect in itself
[1:09:41] unlimited in its power
[1:09:44] primarily an ultimate
[1:09:47] and an ultimate is the amen
[1:09:51] that's all amen
[1:09:54] uh absolute
[1:09:57] it is
[1:09:58] it's
[1:09:59] the unlimited in power the word absolute
[1:10:05] it's it's perfect
[1:10:07] in itself that's all of it
[1:10:09] that settles it
[1:10:12] i thought that's a glorious thing
[1:10:15] that's a wonderful word
[1:10:17] and now a word
[1:10:20] is a thought expressed
[1:10:23] first it must be a thought
[1:10:25] and then it becomes a word because you
[1:10:28] do not speak your words without thought
[1:10:32] when we speak in tongues we have no
[1:10:34] thought
[1:10:35] it's god taking the thoughts it's god's
[1:10:37] thought using our lips
[1:10:39] we don't think or know what you're
[1:10:41] saying when you're speaking in tongues
[1:10:43] if it's inspired speaking
[1:10:45] when you interpret you do not know what
[1:10:47] you're saying you just say it so
[1:10:50] that's god
[1:10:52] and prophesying you're not using your
[1:10:55] own thoughts it's god because you say
[1:10:57] things that you ordinarily wouldn't
[1:10:59] think about seeing
[1:11:02] but the word
[1:11:04] absolute is an ultimate
[1:11:06] and
[1:11:07] therefore i think that everybody should
[1:11:10] have an ultimate and every great
[1:11:13] achievement that's ever been achieved
[1:11:16] there has been an absolute behind it
[1:11:19] man
[1:11:20] no matter what it was
[1:11:23] it's had an absolute behind
[1:11:26] and every person in order to achieve
[1:11:29] something has to first have the absolute
[1:11:33] and that's the
[1:11:34] final line back to this that back to the
[1:11:38] other to you come to that
[1:11:40] absolute
[1:11:42] or the
[1:11:43] uh amen
[1:11:45] or
[1:11:46] the ultimate of what you're
[1:11:49] you got something you have to tie to in
[1:11:51] other words
[1:11:53] it's the final
[1:11:55] tying post
[1:11:57] the ever achievement
[1:11:59] it's somewhere it might wind through
[1:12:01] many different things till it gets to
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:04] high post but there is the amen to all
[1:12:07] of it
[1:12:08] there must be such a thing
[1:12:11] you cannot go on through life without
[1:12:14] having one
[1:12:16] you when you got married
[1:12:18] there had to wind back through your mind
[1:12:20] something do you hit that thai post
[1:12:24] and it should have been love
[1:12:27] for your wife or your husband
[1:12:30] well maybe she isn't as pretty as
[1:12:33] john's wife or she was she not the
[1:12:36] the this that but there's something
[1:12:38] about her that you it strikes you you
[1:12:42] you say she might not be as pretty as
[1:12:44] the other or he might not be as handsome
[1:12:46] as the other but there has to be a
[1:12:49] absolute there that that person's
[1:12:51] different
[1:12:52] and that's where you hold on to
[1:12:56] if that isn't there you better not get
[1:12:58] married
[1:13:00] that thai post
[1:13:03] that absolute
[1:13:06] we can think of many who had absolutes
[1:13:10] in the bible
[1:13:12] oh how we could take down to the stream
[1:13:16] of that bible and just be here two weeks
[1:13:19] from now
[1:13:21] and never even touch the surface
[1:13:24] if we think of the absolutes in the
[1:13:26] bible
[1:13:28] for instance let me just call one or two
[1:13:30] just brief them
[1:13:33] look at job
[1:13:36] now he had an absolute
[1:13:39] everything went wrong for that man a
[1:13:42] just man
[1:13:44] now we would be darrison to say that he
[1:13:46] wasn't just because god said he was
[1:13:49] there was no one on earth like job
[1:13:53] he was perfect in the sight of god and
[1:13:56] he knew it because he had an ultimate
[1:13:59] he had an absolute
[1:14:02] when everything seemed to be contrary
[1:14:06] sickness broke out
[1:14:08] his friends might have said now
[1:14:12] there you are job that proves that you
[1:14:16] are sinning
[1:14:17] you're wrong
[1:14:20] and then the bishops come down
[1:14:22] uh they call them job's comforters and
[1:14:26] instead of comforting them they seen
[1:14:28] nothing but sin in his life because god
[1:14:31] had dealt with him
[1:14:33] the way he had
[1:14:36] and his children was killed his his
[1:14:39] property was burned his is everything
[1:14:42] went wrong and even his own life in
[1:14:45] jeopardy
[1:14:47] sitting on a as she broke out from the
[1:14:49] crown of his head to the soles of his
[1:14:52] feet with boils
[1:14:54] and even his
[1:14:57] lovely
[1:14:58] sweet companion
[1:15:00] the mother of those children said you
[1:15:02] should curse god and die of the dead
[1:15:06] but in the face of all that job had an
[1:15:11] absolute amen
[1:15:15] oh in time of sickness if we could only
[1:15:17] tie ourselves to that absolutely
[1:15:23] job know that he had done jehovah's
[1:15:26] bidding and he had faith in what he done
[1:15:29] because jehovah required it
[1:15:31] we can just do that
[1:15:34] jehovah required a burnt offering for
[1:15:37] his sins and job not only for himself
[1:15:40] but for his children had made a burnt
[1:15:42] offering and that's all god required
[1:15:47] oh you might say
[1:15:49] i wish that's all he required today it's
[1:15:51] less than that
[1:15:55] just faith in his word
[1:15:59] and you if you make his word your
[1:16:01] absolute chicken
[1:16:02] any divine promise in the bible you can
[1:16:05] tie your soul to it
[1:16:09] all right no matter how much the weave
[1:16:10] is whipped you're around you're still
[1:16:12] tired
[1:16:14] you're absolute
[1:16:17] and he held on to it and when this
[1:16:20] comforter said you've sinned he knowed
[1:16:22] he had not
[1:16:24] he was just because he'd done jehovah's
[1:16:26] bidding
[1:16:27] and when he's uh every the man come in
[1:16:30] said your children's dead another come
[1:16:32] in said your camels are all burned up
[1:16:34] and there come fire down from heaven
[1:16:37] look what an argument is
[1:16:39] discomforters had
[1:16:42] you see the fire came from heaven
[1:16:46] now job that proves it proves nothing
[1:16:52] now you wouldn't have struck your
[1:16:53] children job you're a just man
[1:16:55] but job said i know
[1:16:58] that i've done what's right
[1:17:00] he still held on he had something that
[1:17:02] he could drive down amen
[1:17:05] that's it
[1:17:06] he had accepted it it had done exactly
[1:17:09] what god told him to do and he was
[1:17:12] absolutely sure
[1:17:16] all right
[1:17:18] then when he come to the spot one that
[1:17:20] absolute help then finally
[1:17:23] he began to feel the string tighten up
[1:17:27] they've been running loose bouncing
[1:17:28] around
[1:17:29] but it began to tighten up in the spirit
[1:17:31] come on him and he stood up being a
[1:17:33] prophet and he said i know my redeemer
[1:17:36] liveth amen
[1:17:38] see he tightened up to his absolute he
[1:17:41] come in contact he know that he had done
[1:17:43] what was right and someday he had to
[1:17:45] pull to it amen
[1:17:47] i know my redeemer liveth and at the
[1:17:50] last days he stands up on this earth
[1:17:52] though after skin worms destroys this
[1:17:54] body yet in my flesh shall i see god
[1:17:56] he knew that that is absolute anchor
[1:18:01] abraham
[1:18:03] an absolute
[1:18:05] coming down from
[1:18:07] babylon from the tower
[1:18:09] and uh out into the shine
[1:18:12] out in there where he was uh
[1:18:14] souljourning with his father perhaps as
[1:18:16] a farmer
[1:18:18] but one day
[1:18:19] way back in the
[1:18:21] jungles somewhere maybe picking berries
[1:18:25] are are going to kill a beast for his
[1:18:28] meat
[1:18:29] and somewhere back in there
[1:18:32] god spoke to him when he was 75 years
[1:18:34] old
[1:18:36] and he was he and his wife sarah her
[1:18:39] being 65 was childish childish they
[1:18:42] didn't have any children
[1:18:44] then
[1:18:45] god told him you're going to have a
[1:18:48] child by sarah
[1:18:51] but in order to do this you've got to
[1:18:53] separate yourself
[1:18:55] god's promises are always on condition
[1:19:00] you must absolutely no matter how
[1:19:02] fundamental you are with the promise
[1:19:04] it's under conditions
[1:19:07] always
[1:19:08] how we could stop here and wave through
[1:19:11] that scripture back and forth for hours
[1:19:14] think that the condition is what means
[1:19:16] something you can be just as fundamental
[1:19:18] as you want to but it's under conditions
[1:19:20] by the promise
[1:19:22] predestination and so forth
[1:19:25] notice
[1:19:26] now abraham
[1:19:29] he believed god and it was imputed unto
[1:19:32] him for righteousness
[1:19:33] now what a
[1:19:35] a horrible thing it would be to meet a a
[1:19:38] civilized world a man 75 years old with
[1:19:41] a woman 65 and lived together since they
[1:19:43] were young couples because she was his
[1:19:45] half sister
[1:19:46] and now
[1:19:48] going to have a baby bar but he had an
[1:19:51] absolute
[1:19:53] there was nothing go to movie
[1:19:55] and when the first month it didn't
[1:19:57] happen his absolute health
[1:20:00] because he knowed he had talked to god
[1:20:03] the second month second year tenure and
[1:20:05] at 25 years later when he was a hundred
[1:20:09] and sarah was 90 his absolute still help
[1:20:15] the bible said when his obituary was
[1:20:18] written he said abraham staggered not at
[1:20:20] the promise of god through unbelief
[1:20:23] but was strong giving praise to god why
[1:20:27] did you ever think why he was absolute
[1:20:30] positive
[1:20:33] and the only thing he had to do is
[1:20:35] separate himself from his people
[1:20:37] god never did bless him until he did it
[1:20:40] he took his daddy
[1:20:42] daddy died
[1:20:44] he took lot and when after lot separated
[1:20:47] from abraham then god come to him
[1:20:50] but now walk through the land amen
[1:20:53] obedience
[1:20:54] promise under conditions
[1:20:57] always goes with god
[1:20:59] and his word
[1:21:01] now
[1:21:02] look at let's take moses
[1:21:05] moses the the runaway
[1:21:08] servant prophet
[1:21:09] and god had raised him up and educated
[1:21:12] him and pharaoh's palace and and moses
[1:21:15] went out with his theological training
[1:21:17] and was the first man he sleuth
[1:21:20] then the first little defect come along
[1:21:23] then moses was scared to death why
[1:21:25] he had no absolute
[1:21:28] he only had his his mother's testimony
[1:21:31] of his birth he was a strange child
[1:21:34] he had his mother's word about it he had
[1:21:37] the scrolls that
[1:21:39] god had perhaps in paper somewhere they
[1:21:42] had written packed along with him that
[1:21:44] god was going to visit his children he
[1:21:46] know that that was a time
[1:21:48] like we do now
[1:21:50] we know something's fixed to happen
[1:21:53] now
[1:21:54] moses knowed that was the time
[1:21:57] and he knew that he was chosen for it
[1:21:59] but he didn't have an absolute
[1:22:01] see
[1:22:02] and one day on the back side of the
[1:22:05] desert
[1:22:06] when he lost the vision
[1:22:09] god appeared to him in a burning bush
[1:22:12] and said moses
[1:22:14] i have seen the afflictions of my people
[1:22:18] i've heard their groans and crying of
[1:22:20] those taskmasters punish them and i have
[1:22:23] remembered my promise
[1:22:26] i've come down to deliver them now go
[1:22:29] down to egypt
[1:22:30] oh my
[1:22:33] said
[1:22:34] moses complained he said i don't speak
[1:22:37] very well my my
[1:22:39] deliverance is not very well they won't
[1:22:41] believe me
[1:22:42] he said what's in your hand he said a
[1:22:44] stick he said throw it down and turn to
[1:22:45] a serpent said pick it up with a tail
[1:22:47] and turn back again to a stick
[1:22:50] he's giving him the assurance of
[1:22:52] vindication
[1:22:54] when god gives an absolute he gives a
[1:22:56] vindication to that absolute always
[1:23:01] then moses when he was down there and he
[1:23:03] threw down his stick before the
[1:23:05] magicians and pharaoh and the magicians
[1:23:08] come and threw down their stick too
[1:23:11] moses never run and said oh well i was
[1:23:13] wrong i was just a cheap magician trick
[1:23:16] and maybe i was wrong but he knows amen
[1:23:20] amen he was positive
[1:23:23] that he met god
[1:23:25] and he stood still
[1:23:28] let's see he had done exactly what god
[1:23:31] told him to do so a job done exactly
[1:23:33] what god told him to do
[1:23:35] moses had followed his commandments then
[1:23:37] stand still and watch the glory of god
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:42] moses is tied to his absolute his
[1:23:45] commission
[1:23:46] and he stood still
[1:23:48] and when he did
[1:23:50] his serpents swallowed up the rest of
[1:23:51] the serpents
[1:23:53] see
[1:23:54] he was tied to that absolute
[1:23:57] god said when you deliver them children
[1:23:59] you'll worship me again on this mountain
[1:24:02] now the enemy
[1:24:04] in every way that he can will try to get
[1:24:07] you away from that absolute
[1:24:11] right as they started out of egypt
[1:24:14] they got cornered right in the neck of
[1:24:17] the of the red sea
[1:24:19] mountains on either side
[1:24:21] come up through a valley and there's a
[1:24:23] red sea no way to escape over the hills
[1:24:25] no way to escape this way and pharaoh's
[1:24:28] army coming this way
[1:24:31] what a place to stand see how the devil
[1:24:33] gets you in a place where you don't know
[1:24:36] what to do
[1:24:37] but remember if you're tied to that
[1:24:39] absolute
[1:24:40] that's got it
[1:24:42] moses know that god promised him that
[1:24:45] you'll worship on this mountain when you
[1:24:46] bring him out
[1:24:47] and i've come down by your hand to
[1:24:49] deliver him and play some more in that
[1:24:50] other land he stayed right with it and
[1:24:53] god sent an east wind and blowed out the
[1:24:55] waters out of the bottom of the sin they
[1:24:57] walked across on dry land an absolute
[1:25:01] how we could go through the scriptures
[1:25:03] daniel his absolute shadrach meshach and
[1:25:06] abednego they're absolute david his
[1:25:09] absolute oh absolute
[1:25:16] was that inspiring
[1:25:19] amen amen well
[1:25:21] you can go back and
[1:25:23] at home and
[1:25:25] keep
[1:25:27] working it up let me grab my bible
[1:25:35] so
[1:25:36] i i just thought there's a couple things
[1:25:39] in there that we just want to just say
[1:25:40] real quick
[1:25:42] you notice he said nobody can achieve
[1:25:44] anything until they have an absolute
[1:25:48] you can't go through life without
[1:25:52] having one right right
[1:25:55] amen every absolute if it's from god is
[1:25:58] totally vindicated
[1:26:00] you know what i mean i everybody that's
[1:26:03] ever intellectually came up
[1:26:07] and challenged me on the message had
[1:26:10] zero works
[1:26:14] they never prayed for the sick
[1:26:17] they never had a miracle
[1:26:19] they never had anything
[1:26:22] but everybody that i've ever met that
[1:26:25] had had signs and workings of god in
[1:26:28] their lives never spoke against it
[1:26:33] they may not agree it but they wouldn't
[1:26:36] speak against it
[1:26:38] because every absolute has vindication
[1:26:41] and my my answer to most people is okay
[1:26:44] you explain this to me
[1:26:46] you explain it this way this man
[1:26:49] explained it this way he raised the dead
[1:26:51] blind eyes were healed he discerned the
[1:26:54] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:26:56] he even has the scripture that says if
[1:26:59] you can't believe me for my words
[1:27:01] believe me for my work say why in the
[1:27:03] world would i take what you have to say
[1:27:07] with zero vindication when i've got a
[1:27:11] mountain of things to stand on
[1:27:18] it doesn't make any sense
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:22] okay and then did you notice this other
[1:27:24] statement that he made here he says
[1:27:27] someday you'll have to pull to it
[1:27:33] now
[1:27:35] that's
[1:27:36] to me
[1:27:38] when a prophet
[1:27:40] says something in that
[1:27:43] realm
[1:27:44] that's a reality of life
[1:27:47] so everybody someplace in their life is
[1:27:50] going to pull to what their true
[1:27:53] absolute is
[1:27:56] when they get desperate they're going to
[1:27:58] pull to their same absolute
[1:28:01] my next door neighbor got involved in
[1:28:03] the shootout
[1:28:05] right next door we heard the guns going
[1:28:07] off i called the police i said there's
[1:28:08] gunshots in the neighborhood
[1:28:10] i loaded my gun
[1:28:13] and the kid started hey
[1:28:16] you might think it's funny
[1:28:19] but don't go shooting a gun around my
[1:28:20] house because i'm going to have my gun
[1:28:22] loaded
[1:28:23] i'm going to protect my family
[1:28:26] i was told someone threatened sarah or
[1:28:29] uh rebecca one time and brother sat out
[1:28:31] in front of a room with a shotgun
[1:28:36] you know so much for
[1:28:39] the woke
[1:28:43] i'm just serious though
[1:28:45] do you understand what i'm saying these
[1:28:47] people they come up with things and they
[1:28:49] don't they don't rest they're going to
[1:28:51] pull to it so this guy got shot
[1:28:55] and he ran to my house
[1:28:57] and banged on my door
[1:29:00] okay so he's laying in my living room
[1:29:02] bleeding we're trying to do what we can
[1:29:03] to help him he was shot several times
[1:29:06] and the police officer come and he said
[1:29:11] he said i said any any i said i'm i'm
[1:29:14] not close to him his name is val i'm not
[1:29:16] close to him at all we don't really do
[1:29:18] anything he said they'll run to the
[1:29:20] closest thing that they know is god
[1:29:23] every time
[1:29:25] that word came straight out of the
[1:29:27] policeman's mouth
[1:29:32] when man gets there how many of them her
[1:29:35] start calling out i've heard the worst
[1:29:37] sinners
[1:29:38] curse god everything get stuck under a
[1:29:41] machine or something and it's god help
[1:29:43] me
[1:29:44] god help me
[1:29:46] because you're going to pull to your
[1:29:48] absolute right
[1:29:50] cook you understand i want to have
[1:29:52] something to pull to did you see what
[1:29:54] paul said he pulled to his absolute
[1:29:57] right
[1:29:57] what did moses do he pulled to his
[1:30:00] absolute would everyone in all these
[1:30:02] situations what did shadrach
[1:30:05] bed nego do they pulled to their
[1:30:07] absolute they had an absolute and they
[1:30:10] pulled to it
[1:30:11] so he said you have to have an absolute
[1:30:14] you've got to pull toot it and what's
[1:30:16] another thing an absolute won't do it
[1:30:18] won't mix with anything remember they
[1:30:20] had to come out from everything else
[1:30:23] totally that's the condition
[1:30:26] the condition of an absolute is it can't
[1:30:28] be mixed it can't be mixed with worldly
[1:30:32] worship it can't be mixed with the way
[1:30:34] other people do things it can't be mixed
[1:30:37] in other words you can't put a filter on
[1:30:39] it so it makes the taste that you want
[1:30:42] if it's an absolute you take it just the
[1:30:46] way it is
[1:30:49] it's got condition
[1:30:50] and the condition is you take it the way
[1:30:53] you said it
[1:30:55] never ask you if you understood it he
[1:30:58] asked if you what
[1:30:59] believed it
[1:31:01] so what is he asking you is what i say
[1:31:06] you're absent
[1:31:13] well look what job had to go through
[1:31:15] didn't he say
[1:31:17] if
[1:31:17] it's easier than that today
[1:31:20] job had to sacrifice a lamb he said it's
[1:31:23] easier than that today all you have to
[1:31:25] do today is accept it
[1:31:30] accepting it isn't saying i believe i'm
[1:31:33] accepting it isn't on the words the the
[1:31:36] acceptance of it is you pulling to it as
[1:31:39] your absolute and hanging on to it as
[1:31:43] being your life source
[1:31:47] this is where i put all my trust this is
[1:31:50] where i put all my confidence this is
[1:31:52] what i totally rest in god said so
[1:31:56] well we're going to throw you into the
[1:31:58] fire o king
[1:32:01] be blessed forever
[1:32:08] i believe that god can deliver us from
[1:32:10] the fire
[1:32:11] but if he don't
[1:32:13] my absolute is i don't bow down to idols
[1:32:20] the absolute didn't meet him at the
[1:32:22] the door
[1:32:24] the absolute didn't meet job
[1:32:28] at the doctor's office
[1:32:31] he went through it all
[1:32:35] but they never let go of their absolutes
[1:32:38] because they had one he said moses in
[1:32:41] the beginning
[1:32:42] heard all about him
[1:32:46] he believed every promise that was
[1:32:48] spoken about him my name's in the lamb's
[1:32:51] book of life i am the bride
[1:32:54] i'm the elected one i'm the chosen
[1:32:57] people
[1:32:58] god sent a messenger
[1:33:01] and he didn't have an absolute
[1:33:08] but when he met him
[1:33:13] i would have liked to been there
[1:33:16] god discerned the thoughts and intents
[1:33:17] of his heart took him all the way back
[1:33:19] to his childhood explained everything to
[1:33:22] him just like he had that was moses's
[1:33:25] road to damascus
[1:33:27] and when he came out he knew one thing
[1:33:31] that's right right you're going to throw
[1:33:32] this dick down it's going to turn
[1:33:34] into a servant you pick it back up put
[1:33:37] your hand in pull it back out he
[1:33:40] he knew
[1:33:42] he had talked to god didn't matter what
[1:33:44] come up against he had an absolute he
[1:33:47] had something he stood on
[1:33:49] it was the word of god you know when
[1:33:51] when we really come to our heart and
[1:33:54] understand that this message is the
[1:33:57] vindicated word of
[1:34:00] god
[1:34:02] it's what it prophet is he's a divine
[1:34:05] interpreter of the word of god you don't
[1:34:07] have to be ashamed of your absolute
[1:34:10] because he'll prove it to you every time
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:17] if you don't have it
[1:34:19] find it
[1:34:24] find it
[1:34:25] find yours
[1:34:29] but we we begin to see how an absolute
[1:34:34] works and you've got to pull to us so
[1:34:36] you know i just want to close with this
[1:34:39] sometimes because
[1:34:42] there's something so if
[1:34:44] if
[1:34:45] faith has to have
[1:34:47] a resting place right so faith is the
[1:34:50] evidence so i have i have
[1:34:53] a something that's a substance or
[1:34:57] something that's real
[1:35:00] okay
[1:35:01] i have something that's real
[1:35:04] that is my absolute
[1:35:06] so i'm not looking at the circumstances
[1:35:09] i'm looking at what's real now look at
[1:35:12] healing i just want to say this in
[1:35:14] closing
[1:35:16] at
[1:35:17] in short because many people
[1:35:20] think healing's in the result
[1:35:24] healing's in the absolute
[1:35:31] deliverance
[1:35:33] the child
[1:35:35] that abraham had was in the absolute
[1:35:39] it wasn't in sarah
[1:35:41] it wasn't in abraham god proved that to
[1:35:44] him
[1:35:46] and what was abraham's testimony he
[1:35:49] staggered not at the promise of god he
[1:35:52] believed he didn't know how
[1:35:55] that god was able to perform that which
[1:35:58] he promised that was an absolute to him
[1:36:01] so what is the absolute
[1:36:04] for every person that's seeking divine
[1:36:08] healing give me the scripture
[1:36:12] anybody
[1:36:17] by his stripes
[1:36:19] i am healed
[1:36:22] right
[1:36:23] so that's the evidence
[1:36:26] now i'm hoping to get well
[1:36:31] i haven't seen my healing
[1:36:34] hallelujah
[1:36:37] right
[1:36:38] so what am i resting in
[1:36:42] the evidence
[1:36:46] the absolute is the evidence
[1:36:50] in other words let me ask you
[1:36:52] did jesus get scourged
[1:36:57] amen
[1:36:59] is that a historical fact
[1:37:02] amen he was whooped
[1:37:08] he was laid stripes on him
[1:37:10] why did god put that
[1:37:13] in the whole crucifixion process
[1:37:21] is that true
[1:37:24] is it a fact
[1:37:26] is it an evidence
[1:37:27] could i present that in court
[1:37:33] now my absolute isn't in what i'm hoping
[1:37:35] for the scripture says i'm hoping for it
[1:37:38] it's not a shame for me to hope for my
[1:37:41] healing
[1:37:44] okay it's not a shame that i haven't
[1:37:47] seen it yet
[1:37:52] my healing doesn't lie in myself
[1:37:54] physician make yourself whole
[1:37:58] i can heal myself
[1:38:01] i can do things to help it i can set a
[1:38:03] bone i can take the medicine that all
[1:38:06] might work i might use that
[1:38:09] but my healing is in
[1:38:12] the fact
[1:38:14] the evidence
[1:38:17] so i'm not looking at symptoms
[1:38:20] i'm not looking at how i feel i'm not
[1:38:23] looking the fact i'm hoping for it and i
[1:38:25] haven't seen it i'm claiming and
[1:38:28] testifying that he died and he rose from
[1:38:32] the dead and by his stripes i'm healed i
[1:38:37] know that is a
[1:38:42] fact i'm not testifying to the results
[1:38:47] i'm testifying to the evidence
[1:38:50] not hearsay
[1:38:53] not oh if you had faith
[1:38:58] i don't come
[1:39:00] right right i don't have faith
[1:39:03] but i got evidence of my healing because
[1:39:06] he was scourged
[1:39:09] that is a fact
[1:39:11] that happened
[1:39:12] god allowed that to happen
[1:39:15] god put him through that for my healing
[1:39:20] when i he never said win
[1:39:24] why he never said why what are you
[1:39:26] confessing to i'm not confessing to the
[1:39:29] results
[1:39:35] i don't have any results to confess to
[1:39:39] my results are not my evidence
[1:39:44] my hope
[1:39:45] is neither forming or against me yes i'm
[1:39:48] hoping to get well
[1:39:50] well what are you testifying to i'm
[1:39:53] testifying
[1:39:54] that he was scourged yes
[1:39:58] i'm testifying that that's true
[1:40:02] that's what my testament is
[1:40:05] abraham's testament was god told me
[1:40:10] moses his testimony was i meant the
[1:40:13] thing god told me
[1:40:14] shadrach and meshach god said so
[1:40:19] they weren't looking at results they
[1:40:21] weren't even looking for deliverance
[1:40:26] but they're absolute
[1:40:28] they drew to their absolute
[1:40:32] they were pulled to their absolute they
[1:40:34] didn't mix it with anything
[1:40:46] it's a fact
[1:40:48] it's in evidence and evidence is a fact
[1:40:52] it's something that's true
[1:40:55] and i can truly say that jesus
[1:41:02] right
[1:41:05] was scourged
[1:41:08] and beaten
[1:41:10] for my healing
[1:41:12] that's a fact
[1:41:14] hear what the doctors say i don't hurt
[1:41:17] the family history is
[1:41:19] i don't care how i'm feeling i don't
[1:41:21] care what i see
[1:41:23] i'm not testifying to those things
[1:41:25] as true as they may be prophet of god
[1:41:28] say don't say you're i'm not sick
[1:41:30] you are sick
[1:41:34] i am hoping for healing i am sick
[1:41:37] well where's your healing what's your
[1:41:39] evidence where's your
[1:41:40] healing lie i can't perform it
[1:41:44] i pull to my absolute
[1:41:48] i don't mix it
[1:41:51] i don't say buy a stripe with the
[1:41:53] doctor's help i don't say buy his
[1:41:55] stripes if i take this drink by his
[1:41:58] stripe if i eat this secret seaweed
[1:42:01] out of the ocean
[1:42:04] by his stripes if i
[1:42:06] you know i exercise five times a day and
[1:42:09] i drew this and i changed my diet and i
[1:42:12] do that all that's good
[1:42:14] prophet of god said you do everything
[1:42:17] you can do
[1:42:20] but i don't have evidence in any of
[1:42:22] those things there's one place i have
[1:42:24] evidence and that is the fact the true
[1:42:28] fact that by his stripes i was healed
[1:42:32] and that actually happened that is
[1:42:35] admissible
[1:42:37] evidence
[1:42:39] in
[1:42:41] thank you court i rest my case
[1:42:45] yes sir
[1:42:47] well i don't see it well so what if you
[1:42:49] saw the absolute
[1:42:50] you'd see what i see

[1:42:57] don't worry
[1:42:58] sis
[1:42:59] it's okay
[1:43:01] because by his stripes
[1:43:03] we're healed

[1:43:07] young enough to have faith you have
[1:43:09] faith for them

[1:43:18] they told sister rachel she'd never
[1:43:20] drive again
[1:43:21] she would never drive
[1:43:26] we didn't believe it did we say
[1:43:30] i don't accept that
[1:43:35] so i went

[1:43:37] called up somebody in the phone book
[1:43:41] to give her driver's license
[1:43:44] the person showed up gave her drivers
[1:43:47] lessons she got her license
[1:43:50] i tried to find the person
[1:43:53] to pay him
[1:43:58] i went and looked for the number i had
[1:44:01] and it it wasn't disconnected
[1:44:05] there is no driving school that i called
[1:44:08] never existed no instructor by that name
[1:44:11] no phone number in the book or anywhere
[1:44:14] that i called
[1:44:17] somebody
[1:44:19] from somewhere
[1:44:21] showed up
[1:44:24] and gave her driver's license for free
[1:44:28] and she got her driver's license because
[1:44:31] by his stripes were healed
[1:44:34] that's a fact
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] evidence
[1:44:46] they told
[1:44:47] brother
[1:44:48] daniel employee
[1:44:51] in the hospital
[1:44:54] who do you want to live
[1:44:57] your wife or your child

[1:45:04] great choice huh
[1:45:06] how'd you like to be there
[1:45:10] he went down to the chapel
[1:45:13] he opened his bible and read the
[1:45:16] scripture
[1:45:19] about god giving
[1:45:21] a merry heart
[1:45:23] and joy unspeakable
[1:45:26] and full of glory
[1:45:29] and he said lord if i have to make this
[1:45:32] decision
[1:45:34] i will be sad
[1:45:37] every
[1:45:38] day
[1:45:39] of my life
[1:45:42] and that's contrary
[1:45:45] to your word
[1:45:47] he went down to the doctor he said let
[1:45:50] her have the baby
[1:45:53] go through with it
[1:45:57] because by his stripes
[1:46:01] i'm healed

[1:46:31] that they pulled to

[1:46:56] going to live
[1:47:00] and his wife sat down by his bed sister
[1:47:03] veronique and they talked
[1:47:05] and he
[1:47:06] said i don't she said i don't believe
[1:47:09] what that doctor said
[1:47:12] and he said i don't
[1:47:14] i don't believe
[1:47:15] i don't like that doctor anyway
[1:47:20] no you never seen it maybe some of you
[1:47:22] were here but he came down the aisle
[1:47:25] like this
[1:47:31] yeah
[1:47:32] the same strong handsome
[1:47:34] man that you see out there couldn't walk
[1:47:39] with no evidence
[1:47:42] that he was going to live
[1:47:46] except for he said lord i got children
[1:47:49] to raise
[1:47:52] by his stripes
[1:47:55] amen he was healed
[1:48:03] then they have a child john
[1:48:08] i'm sorry
[1:48:09] little john if you're here i don't know
[1:48:11] where you're here or not
[1:48:13] but
[1:48:15] that kid was born a wreck
[1:48:19] they say he'd be mentally
[1:48:24] he would never grow
[1:48:25] up
[1:48:28] they wanted to totally break every bone
[1:48:33] in his face
[1:48:35] and re-put it together
[1:48:38] and i sat at a table
[1:48:41] with doctors
[1:48:42] she couldn't even speak english
[1:48:46] they had a french
[1:48:48] interpreter
[1:48:50] and these were the finest pediatricians
[1:48:54] in all of texas hadn't assembled
[1:48:56] a board of 12
[1:48:59] surgeons and plastic surgeons and
[1:49:02] pediatricians
[1:49:04] craniologists head this was a case
[1:49:09] and i sat there
[1:49:11] and she looked at me
[1:49:12] and she said brother david
[1:49:14] will you tell them
[1:49:17] that i want to give dr jesus a chance
[1:49:22] first
[1:49:24] because by
[1:49:25] his stripes
[1:49:28] my son is healed

[1:49:35] see john the piano you see john in the
[1:49:37] bass see john on the guitar you see john

[1:49:44] to me
[1:49:45] buyers
[1:49:53] we could go on
[1:49:55] and on and on don't tell me that he's
[1:49:59] not the same yesterday today and forever
[1:50:01] don't tell me i haven't seen the hand of
[1:50:04] god
[1:50:05] amen
[1:50:08] it's all over
[1:50:10] there is a book of acts
[1:50:12] being written behind this bride
[1:50:15] and the only way
[1:50:18] that we won't go off to the left or to
[1:50:20] the right or to everything is when we
[1:50:23] have an absolute
[1:50:25] we draw to that absolute we don't mix
[1:50:28] anything with that absolute
[1:50:34] and
[1:50:36] the absolute
[1:50:39] has got
[1:50:40] complete control
[1:50:47] the prophet of god said the absolute is
[1:50:49] tied to every gift
[1:50:56] every gift
[1:50:58] everything
[1:50:59] every achievement
[1:51:01] is tied
[1:51:02] to an absolute
[1:51:04] amen so i i kept you
[1:51:07] i preached my sunday sermon which i just
[1:51:10] goes perfectly in line
[1:51:12] with what the brothers preach but i want
[1:51:15] to tell you our absolute lives
[1:51:18] and we don't have to go for any other
[1:51:20] outside source for faith
[1:51:24] we don't have to go to any outside
[1:51:26] anointing
[1:51:27] or any outside worship
[1:51:30] or any outside thing
[1:51:33] don't tell me the message ain't martin
[1:51:35] enough don't tell me the songs aren't
[1:51:37] good enough that were song don't tell me
[1:51:39] the gospel didn't cover everything right
[1:51:42] uh-huh i'll tell you an absolute is
[1:51:45] perfect
[1:51:46] within itself it's the ultimate
[1:51:49] it's the final voice
[1:51:51] it's the amen
[1:51:53] amen amen
[1:51:55] now you can be
[1:51:57] anything else you want
[1:52:00] if you want to mix it
[1:52:03] but if you want to be
[1:52:05] what this message
[1:52:07] prophesied to produce
[1:52:10] you've got to stay with it a hundred
[1:52:12] percent
[1:52:13] because it's the only thing
[1:52:17] that is going to produce the bride that
[1:52:21] jesus is going to marry
[1:52:24] he
[1:52:25] absolutely
[1:52:26] spoke
[1:52:27] his wife
[1:52:29] into existence
[1:52:31] by the absolute word because he
[1:52:36] knew
[1:52:37] what the outcome would be
[1:52:40] if she held down to this absolute he
[1:52:43] knew what she would be
[1:52:50] he's going to get what he spoke
[1:52:55] that's my absolute
[1:52:58] is it yours
[1:53:01] so if we're going to go forward we're
[1:53:02] going to go forward as believers in this
[1:53:04] message
[1:53:06] if we're going to go forward we're going
[1:53:07] to accept that the prophet of god is the
[1:53:10] absolute divine interpreter of god's
[1:53:14] word
[1:53:15] and have the message
[1:53:17] that's going to produce a bride
[1:53:20] that's the absolute
[1:53:23] we're not we're not going to mix
[1:53:31] am i okay saying we
[1:53:36] i'm not going to try to reign everybody
[1:53:39] in
[1:53:46] you know i mean i can't always keep the
[1:53:48] wolves out i can't always
[1:53:50] keep things that are coming in i can't
[1:53:53] always keep spirits and new ideas out
[1:54:01] because they're going to come in to
[1:54:03] anybody that doesn't have an absolute
[1:54:07] but when you're anchored in the absolute
[1:54:09] if we get a people that's anchored in
[1:54:11] the absolute
[1:54:14] there's no place for them to enter
[1:54:17] we possess
[1:54:19] the gates of our enemy
[1:54:21] by the absolute
[1:54:23] word of god
[1:54:24] god bless you
