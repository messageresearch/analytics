come in our midst this morning and speak the word Lord that we may live oh God with desire for you to come and make yourself known unto us Lord we don't just want to take it as an in elect oh God but we want to be those people that have come in contact with the Living God be lifted up this morning we commit the service to you and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen man it's good to be in the house of God man why don't we just turn our Bibles uh for scripture reading uh let's turn in Genesis uh Genesis chapter 17 first sorry I I got a little confused here let's turn to Genesis 15 first and then we'll read 17 we'll just read a couple of uh scriptures in uh 15 uh verse one it says it says and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy sheep shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will that give me seeing that I go childless and the steward of my house is this eler of Damascus let's Also let's turn now in 17 we'll start from verse one it says and and Abram was 90 years old old and nine and the Lord appear unto Abraham said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make that my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many Nation if I made thee and I have made thee exceeding and I said I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of Thee I will establish my Covenant between me and thee thy seed after thee in their generation for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherewith thou are a stranger and all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generation this is my Covenant which I which ye shall keep between me and you and th seed after thee every man shall among you shall be circumcised and he shall circumcise the Flesh of of your foreskin and it shall be a token to the Covenant between me and you let's just bow our heads gracious father we so thankful of your word this morning we come to you Lord and we pray that you just take this words and multiply it to us father your Prophet will often times say that the man can take the Bible and read and try to put two and two together but it takes you to actually bring out the revelation of it so therefore we ask you do that to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may have your seats this morning man it's good to be gathered in the house of God I know we have uh many that are out many that that went to uh the meetings in Louisiana and others traveling amen but I'm glad we are here amen so whatever number we have here this morning we keep marching forward amen I want to speak for a moment this morning on elshadai the strength Giver elshadai the strength Giver as we read in the Bible in the Genesis 17 and even 15 the scripture will speak and God is expressing to Abraham what God is going to do uh to offer as a part of his Covenant now we understand from the Bible reading and the scripture reading that when God uh made a covenant weam will talk about how the first Covenant that God made with Adam it was a conditional Covenant that you you will obey this you will do this you shall not touch up the tree you will do this and we understand that through that Covenant that man fall he fail because he was unable to obey God's word or to keep his part of the bargain of what God told him to do so we understand the fall came through that so therefore but the prophet will tell us that when God came and he made a covenant with Abraham uh the scripture will call it an unconditional Covenant it was not a covenant that was based B on what Abraham was going to do but it was based upon everything that God was offering to Abraham and all Abraham had to do was to believe the promise was to believe that this all was already given to him that the the the Covenant wasn't unconditional it wasn't based on uh Abraham goodness that God will do it it wasn't based on Abraham's ability that everything was based on what God was offering to him and so as we read we could see here God is is expressing to Abraham what he's going to offer him as part of his Covenant God is listing the blessings that follow the Covenant that he has made with Abraham it says in other words he's giving him what the benefit of the covenants are he will tell him that if you going he says that if you are part of this Covenant in this Covenant I will make you exceedingly fruitful he said I will make you a father of Nations and it says Kings will come after thee so and Abraham we understand by the scripture that Abraham is a type of a Believer so when a Believer when we come and we believe the word of God God is making a covenant with us and he's letting us know that if we believe the promise that God promised that he will provide for you that will provide protection that he will lead you and whatever you have need of is there to give to you the promise is not made so that you can come and and generate some works for God to look and say that these are the works that are acceptable but the Covenant is given to get you out of the condition that you are in so you can come into the Covenant or in the condition that God wants you to be let me say this this morning God is not looking for us to be perfect to come to him he wants us to come the way we are God is calling upon us the way we are it doesn't matter what your challenge is this morning the Covenant that God made is if you come in the condition that you are in I will do the cleaning I will do the calling I'll do the providing I'll do everything you just have to believe my word you just have to believe my Covenant and through the Covenant I will bring you in the condition that I want you to be so even as we read God told Abraham he says be thou perfect but we understand that God wasn't requiring for Abraham to go and produce his the perfect by himself or find a way for him to actually become perfect but it was through the provision of the Covenant that if Abraham was to partake of the Covenant that he was going to be changed from what he was into the Perfection that God was looking for so the promise and again after Abraham being a type of a Believer I want to say this the promise that God makes every part of the scripture because remember this promise was not just made to Abraham and himself God said he was made to Abraham and the seed after him so when we come as children of Abraham the promise was made to the believer not the unbeliever not the one who's going to come doubting not the one who's going to come to criticize not to the one who's going to come and say well God requires this how am I going to get there no the promise is made to the one that's going to come up and show and say that God I'm I'm here because I believe your word and I'm I'm here because you said I should be here and I'm here because you open my eyes so I can see what you are talking about I'm here because you have made a way for me to hear your word in the end time I'm here because of the promise that you have made and I believe that through the promise that you have made you God has the ability to change me in what I need to be in the end time so the promise is for those who are waiting for his coming the promise is to those that are believing and waiting for the manifestation the promise is not made for the critics you know many times people have the approach where they will come and they will read and they will try to to find and and said well what does this mean or or why are they doing things a certain way why is this done a certain way now the promise is not made for those that questions the promise is not made for those uh will try to understand Ed intellectually the promise is made to the Believers the promise is for those who come and say that God spoken his word I don't care how much I don't understand what he said but I will believe it anyhow how was Abraham going to have a child Abraham didn't know how all that God knew that or that Abraham knew was God spoke it and I believe it all that Abraham knew is that God said that I was going to have a child how he's going to transform from what I am into having a baby I have no idea in fact the time that I thought I had much time to have the child the time is passed by I don't know the more time goes by the more my body is dying the more impossible the mission it seems like I will have a baby but one thing I know is God told me I'm going to have a child and I'm going to stand here until that comes to pass so if you come it's made for those will believe and but if you come it it's made for those that would come and they will come with an expectation that will come and I want to say this even this morning when we come to the house of God we don't just come because it's a Sunday or it's another Sunday I have to go to the house of God or it's another Wednesday I have to go and all of this things but there has to be in the believer's heart and in the believer's life and expectation for the promise to come to pass and butam says if he doesn't come today he'll come tomorrow if he doesn't come tomorrow he'll come the next day and it's just not for is coming but it's for every promise I'm standing on the promise of God if he doesn't heal me today he'll heal me tomorrow if it's not today it's the next day why I'm living in constant expectation that the promise will happen at any moment that's the believer's attitude that's the approach that God is looking for God is is not wanting us to just come and sit down and say well he'll do it whenever he wants to he'll do it whenever it's time that he wants to do it no God is wanting us to come with an expectation this morning that I I'm in the house of God I'm expecting good things to happen I come to the house of God God can answer to my needs this morning whatever my need is this morning I'm on the expectation that God will speak to me we we then I continually go day in and day out and be completely tired and and that's don't know and almost barely making it no God wants us to constantly be under the expectation of his promise in our life whatever the need is every day when we walk up it's another opportunity for the supernatural to be made known unto us when we come out and and when we walk around everywhere we go it's we have to be under the expectation that there Supernatural will break in any moment so and so the scripture will say as we read and when Abraham was 99 years old it says 90 90 years old and nine and the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him I am the almighty God I love this walk before me and be thou perfect now brother Ram takes that word the almighty God it says the translation for that word is l sh L sh the L meaning the allmighty god l meaning the all sufficient God l meaning is the all powerful God in other word it's not one who's lacking anything it's not one who needs help in fulfilling anything he The God Who created heaven and earth now I I love this because if you go out throughout the scripture you go back from Genesis you find out the one thing that God is doing the the the God is constantly revealing himself to his children by changing forth his name and with every name is bringing forth a characteristic of himself that was never known before through his children he will come and he will say by my name Jehovah was I not known by this and it says I am God and in beginning God and and then he became the Lord God and and then but we talk about God and he says God is Elohim l l Elohim the one who existed by himself the one before there was an Earth was before there was an Adam before there was a void and before there was anything he was by himself and he was the god who created everything let me say this my brother my sister if God makes a promise he's able to fulfill it he's not a God who needs our help and he's not a God who need our begging and and us coming we have to judge him sufficient for the promise we have to judge him The God Who exists by himself and his L Elohim and one who's not lacking in anything and I thought about how will even say he's the the the absolute he he will pull up just forgive me if I could just pull this out he talks in the message AB Abol I thought this was just linking so perfectly paragraph 10 uh I believe it's 10 uh uh 102 one or 10 sorry in the message absolute it says I was hearing a man speaking not not long ago and he used the word absolute and I thought it's very fine word and then it says I hear many time used absolutely that's right it says now I look it up in the dictionary in the Webster according to Webster it's perfect in itself it's it's Unlimited in its power it's primarily an ultimate an ultimate is an amen that's all an absolute it's an unlimited in power in its power it says the word absolute is perfect in itself that's all it is that settles it and then I thought he said that's a glorious thing that's a wonderful thing so when God speaks it's an absolute when God speaks it's a final word when God speaks there's nothing else that could be added now in fact bam will go back and say that that that you know we understand even when Dr best was debating about the uh Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ of the new and he will quote the scripture and say isn't the seven compound names of Jehovah in the Old Testament and all translated in the name of Jesus Christ why because he was wanting to bring to the people the understanding that this is the god in the Old Testament who presented himself as the Mighty God the one who existed by himself the all-sufficient God he's the god who's not liking in anything he says to the Believers now it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are taking God in his unlimited power you are taking God in the form that he wants to reveal himself you are taking God in his fullness you are taking because remember the scripture says in Christ was the fullness of God manifested and and let me say this what what God wants us when we come to his word when the word of God is presented to us he he wants us to consider in whom we are receiving the word from who are you believing in this morning you are believing in a god who's Unlimited in his power you are believing in God who's all sufficient you are believing in God who created the heavens and the Earth and that's why you will look at Abraham and it says is there anything impossible to God but yet we are we are presented with challenges we we we come in and and and every day seems like the battles get harder and and and and stronger and everything and and and and often time we we fail to understand the ability that lies within the promise of God or the promise the one who gave the promise God wants us to consider him who gave the promise he wants you but will say one place that Abraham didn't even care what the promise was he didn't care what God Said was going to be why because he considered he who said the promise hear me out he didn't care how complicated how hard how impossible how extremely difficult what is it that he was asking if he was asking for a new world if it was asking for God to create something that never existed if he was asking for something that's never happened before what he cared about was who told me this whose words am I believing whose words am I standing on who's giving me this promise and he knew that if it's God that's giving me the word then I believe it he wants you to consider his abilities he wants you to consider his reputation he wants you to consider his works but one will say in the message the unconditional Covenant that God made with his people he says and now watch now first thing you know I see when is 90 and N paragraph 52 God appeared to him to conf appeared to him to kind of confirm the things 17th chapter of Genesis he appeared to him in the name elshad which eladi in the Hebrew word means the breasted the breast or the breasted one like the mother with her baby it says you take a little baby it says said now Abraham I am eladi the almighty God now you are old your strength are all gone Sarah's wom is dead she's 0 she's 90 little Grandma it says like like now great great great grandma it says 90 years old it says she's awful old and the people are laughing at you and making fun of you but I am the breasted one oh my brother my sister let me say this whenever you are waiting for the promise of God and we'll see throughout the Bible people are going to make fun of you people are going to laugh at you oh look at him and he's been waiting and nothing is happening and look at him how long are you going to keep waiting and look at you there's nothing going on people laugh at no when they went and they look at the ark they started laughing and and and they continue to preach the word continue to laugh it's going to rain it's 120 years old how long is he going to wait and he continue he never that never stopped him why because his Revelation didn't come from man he didn't do what came from man his Revelation came directly from God that's why I say this morning what we need is not an electure what we need is a true Revelation from God and they continue to make let me say this people like going to make fun of you oh where is the promise when is that baby going to come you're getting old and you passing the age it looks like it's never going to happen my brother my sister I want to say this morning you keep waiting on God God will vindicate you it says I am the breasted one like a mother now God is wanting us he's taking now the type of a believer in the word of God he's taking you as comparing the relationship between a mother and the child and I thought it's so wonderful because it doesn't matter how old you get to your mom you're still a baby to your mom you still get treated like a baby you get asked question God wants us he wants when he's looking at us he's treating us like we were baby now he's saying like like a mother with a sickly he says a Fred baby now when the little baby is all weakened and run down his strength is gone the mother pulled it right to her Bome and he says and you know the child nurses his strength from the mother the mother's strength becomes the child's strength as he draws from her my brother my sister don't get tired when is Rapture going to come it's going to come when God wants it to come when am I going to get my healing it's going to come when God wants it to come when am I going to get a child it's going to come when God wants it to come but in the meantime God wants you to nurse of the promise because within that promise not only is going to produce a child but it will give you the strength that you need while you're waiting for the child let let me ask you how did you get here this morning what brought you here this morning is the strength of the promise that you are nourishing on is the strength of the Rapture promise if God is going to Rapture you God has to put you in Rapture condition and if God is going to put you in Rapture condition he has to work on you daily to put you in a Rapture condition so when the time has come you are taken out of here it's not a waking up in the morning one day and then say Oh Rapture is here no it's a and daily walking and nourishing from the strength of the promise and God constantly putting his strength in you why because what as you nourish as you pull off the strength of the promise as you feed on the promise you are gaining the strength from the promise 52 he said and so he said now Abraham you are old you are past the age and Sarah is past the age age but I have the bless I have to bless her through you so you just lean upon my bosom just keep nursing amen hallelujah I'll give you your strength draw it of me he he he's not sending you somewhere to go get your strength he's not saying while you waiting for the promise I need you to master up all the strength that you can and then at the end say Well done yes a promise no while you are waiting for the promise I want you to nurse I want you to get to draw your strength out of me Oh my he says now watch the breasted one not one but two he was wounded for our transgression with the stripes we are healed just turn your head yet that turn your head if you need healing amen and the breast of God that's what I mean it says in so many words Abraham I am the breast of God now I will have to I says I will have to do I'll have I'll give you eternal life by nursing from from here now I'm going to do some Divine Healing in your body if you will nurse from here but one of them will say he's the same paragraph 54 he's the same El sh ey tonight and I think this is where uh we we we instead of and I want to say this instead of using your mind use your heart because often time we try to put all the numbers and everything up if it matches and why am I saying that if you don't understand it you don't have to just believe if you don't understand it how is it the same I don't understand it just believe why because whatam said that the Jehovah all the all the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new that all that God was every bit every attribute remember what was he in the Old Testament he was the Fulfillment of all the promises that all the prophet have talked about that's why brother I'm could say that if you go back and you read your Bible you read the whole testimony says if you don't see Jesus Christ go read it again why because he was everything that the prophet talked about in fact brother will go that's why Jesus Christ never wrote any book why because he was the Fulfillment of everything that was written he didn't need to write one it was already written about him and all he did is he came back and he fulfill everything that was written on him and if Jesus did so he should you why because the bride is part of the bridegroom if Jesus fulfilled everything that was written of him the bride in the end time will fulfill everything that's written of her you say why you tell me how Jesus fulfilled his I'll tell you how you fulfill yours how did he fulfill it it was the word of God by the spirit of God because remember everything that was written of him the scripture says that no propety no prophecy of of is of anyit interpretation that the word can never be broken God by his power made it to come to pass and if he made it for him he's going to do it for you it says it's the same as shal tonight he changes not and and it says and his Covenant with his people is the same privilege to draw from the same resources that Father Abraham had drawn he says cause God SW he says he swore by the same Covenant that he give up that is that he give us uh that give us the promise hallelujah oh my there you are that's where my hope is built upon nothing less but Jesus blood and his righteousness it says well all around my soul gives way is my hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I Stand All Out the grounds are sinking tent there you are elhadi the bosom the breast of God if you need salvation for your weak Soul draw from this side if you need healing for your body draw from this side my for my Covenant was with Christ my son and in there was was wounded for your transgression and he was by his stripes you will heal I am the almighty just lean upon just lean up here and go to draw from them promises oh my brother my sister that's why the B the prophet will tell us it's important for us to read our Bibles and pray why because when we are reading we are drawing strength for the day for the challenge that's in front of us by reading our Bible and praying we are drawing the strength of the Living God of the god who's never fail of the god who's Unlimited in power of the god who's all sufficient we are drawing his strength into our bodies th this is not a natural Affair this is not often time how we do it where we we we draw a promise and or we we we go into the word of God and and and we try to figure out something or or a scripture that we never seen before or or something that we can debate with no that's the wrong approach the approach is I have a need in my body the approach is I need healing in my body I need Deliverance in my body I have a problem that I need a solution I'm going to grow from elsh I'm going to go strength from the scripture and his strength will become my strength his overcoming will become my overcoming in the message the approach to God but one of will uses and it's the same he's speaking about the same thing but he's bringing it from a different angle it says paragraph 50 approach to God he says now the Hebrew word L Almighty means elsh which means the almighty God l means god and Shad means breast Shi in the plural I am the allmighty the strong one the alls sufficient one you see it we didn't come this is not a gathering to a man this is not a gathering for us to just read some scriptures and go home this is the understanding that we are in the presence of the almighty God this is an understanding to the believer that when I become a Christian I don't longer belong to myself I believe I belong to an almighty God I belong to someone who's more powerful it's his responsibility to feed me it's his responsibility to take care of me when I when I become when I believe his word I'm taking him at his word I'm transferring my responsibility over to him him I'm taking in him his word and he's the one who's going to protect me it says now Abraham watch what what was what was the name he says watch watch the name that he that he appeared I am Al Shadi in other word I am the breasted one it says the god the it says really really the word Shad comes from the in the Bible it means uh it means woman the woman that says the place the nursing place of a baby in other words it says in other words Abraham I am the strong one listen to this I am the lifegiver I am the lifegiver not only a lifegiver like the baby fright I am the satisfier oh my brother my sister often time we try to draw satisfaction from the things of the world let me say this alcohol doesn't provide satisfaction drugs will not provide satisfaction the things of the world will not provide satisfaction it will only provide a temporary satisfaction if you want to drown away your problem you drink once you you get sober your problems will be waiting for you but if you come and you nurse from this house I once you come sober your problems are gone I am the satisfier I am the one who actually quenches The Thirst whatever you have need of I can actually give you satisfaction do we understand that well well I tell you life can bring you all kinds of trouble life is full of trouble every day but where can you find satisfaction God is saying I'm the only one who can provide satisfaction today it's this problem tomorrow it's another problem if we live long enough it's just stumbling from trouble to trouble but oh there's only one that can satisfy you know you you you can go the scripture says that sin will take you farther than you want to go but it never says that uh sin will actually satisfy you what is it what what is it doing it's only taking you away for something that actually brings through satisfaction I never heard a man say oh I got drunk and I was really satisfied oh I was dragged up and I was really satisfied oh I did this and the moment that is done you come right back to where you started but this is satisfaction for eternity that's why let me say this my brother my S when God Saves you it's the permanent satisfaction you never want the things of the world anymore when God comes and he does a work in your life he saved you from the things of the world and every time you come closer to it your heart don't want anything to do with it now we have all kinds of stuff we have you know all kinds of social media anything you like there is out there but does it provide satisfaction zero if it does how come the people that are producing content they're killing themselves if they were really satisfied how come their satisfaction lead to death the scripture says the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life and let me say this that's the only satisfaction there is in the world the satisfier oh I love this I want satisfaction this morning you know David will say though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death behold thou are with me it says it doesn't matter it says I believe it's in Psalm 119 it says though I made my bed in hell behold thou are there though I run to the uttermost part of the O the Earth behold th are there there's no place I can hide from thee it says my members were made before you you know everything about me when I was curiously wed I knew all about me it says such knowledge is too wonderful I cannot attain it with my mind but that's the only thing that's satisfy when you have the understanding that God knows me more than I even know myself I can never run from him they said oh that's why the scripture will say that it's not necessarily the situation that you are going through is to know that God is with me it doesn't matter what I go through but what I'm looking for is God are you really with me because if you are with me then I'm satisfied my satisfaction doesn't come because of how the circumstance turned because if that's the case then every day I'm in a different mood every day when the circumstance goes a different way then I'm not satisfied anymore but my satisfaction whether be good whether it be bad whether it goes according to my thinking or not my thinking one thing I know is God is with me blessed be the name of the Lord you know I like this I think it was Brother David who said it you know people are are trying to present a Christianity that's void of testing that's void of it it seems like a happy all the time just flying around oh God is good and all the time and on all of those things no it's one who can understand that regardless of what I'm going through regardless of my circumstance regardless of how terrible the things are how hard the battle is I'm still going to serve him because his goodness is far exceeding everything that I can see God is not building up some hot horse plant and and some things that need to be purer God is looking for some original Believers those that can stand there but what I'm says the original has the repellent built in it you don't have to spray it but stand there and say devil depart away from me they can stand there they can endure challenges they can do difficulties they can go through trials they can be tempted over let me say this job was tempted job was tempted and I have a here and I probably even won't read it but says job didn't approach it and said oh I hope so one day I'll see God and in my Temptation it says no he looked at his condition he looked but what I'm said that God gave him a vision and he saw the Lord Jesus Christ and he looked at everything that he was going through and he says I know my redeemer liveth and if my redeemer liveth I shall live also as long as he lives I cannot die it doesn't matter what what the the flesh what this flesh goes through but one thing I know is if God is real I will stay here no the end time is for those that are rooted and grounded those that will stand the test of time to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever sorry I got off my sub I am the satisfier he says in paragraph 51 of the approach to God the little baby if it's fretting sick still got the tummy AEG oh I love this and as long as it's laying in his mother's arm nursing it satisfies him it says oh my you get it he may be sick and his little head is swimming all around and everything else but if he's laying in on his mom's breast on his mother's breast nursing it pacifies him no matter how sick you are what takes place how long the Lord is answering how long it says as long as you are laying in on his breast pulling from the word it satisfies the Believers the now the connection is not you through somebody else and then through God the connection is not the Believers to the pastors and then to God or the Believers to some no this is a personal relationship to understand that God is my mother God is my strength God is the one that I'm drawing for I have a reput I have a relationship with him the life that's in me comes from him I'm here because he placed that life inside of me and that life cannot survive by itself I cannot feed the things of the world and accept that life to no as long as I'm laying in his bosom I'm laying there and drawing strength from his word that is satisfying it says that's my Approach he said that's the way I'm asking you to approach me I am your satisfier do you believe it he said he said you are a hundred years old but you are just a baby to me I love that you are 100 years old but you're just a baby to me well he said look at my flesh how it is wrinkled up and my hair is gray and my shoulders are Stoopid but I am the lifegiver amen that's it Abraham do you see it Abraham believed God he believed God and then ca he says he approached through the symbol through his name he says so we and approach through his name Jesus what does Jesus mean to us savior amen elsh ey to Abraham satisfier strong one salvation salvation Giver strength Giver the same thing elhadi was to Abraham Jesus is to the believer oh my that doesn't just carry you away what Jehovah was to Abraham Jesus Christ is to the believer tonight this morning to just say you are my satisfier now I know I don't want to I could just go I don't want to take too long I want to say this the trouble is our approach is mostly most of the time intellectual and I I just hope I could say this to help us the the the trouble we run into is we try to come by intellect we try to approach with the human faith our faith is tied to how are the circumstance going if the circumstances is tending towards the good my faith is increasing if my circumstance starts to go towards the bed my faith is going down that's not how God wants us to approach the the trouble is our faith is too much dependent on what we see the the the the our faith we are we we have a hop so we have an approach where it seems like we are not really sure we have this attitude this passive attitude is God really going to do it if he does it that's good if he doesn't do it that's okay too no God is Not not looking for that God wants us to believe no matter what but whatam says this in the message the handmade of the Lord is upon me upon him the hand of the Lord is upon Him paragraph 11 it says the salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope Soul it's a no soul the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ the salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope hope so it's a no so you know when you are it says you know when you are when when you are Christ he says the Holy Spirit Bear record with you your spirit that you are a son and a daughter of God the old things are passed away All Things become new and I hope we get it tonight not a borderline Minister not a borderline Christian it it it says if it's a if it's a crowd that's going this way you go with it and if it's that way you go with it stay in the road stand in the Liberty where Christ had made you free be not again entangled in the Yoke of your bondage or halfway God said it make it stick said I would it says I would it says how would you I would you would not uh be hot or cold or for look warm I will spew you out of my mouth so God doesn't want a person that's just a professor without being a possessor oh of all the of the blessings of God God grant to the they it says hurries to uh Louisville Kentucky and All America when Christians that professes to be Christian will just it says will be just what they profess to be God granted so in other word when we come we have to come with a determination we have to come with expectation we have to come knowing that if God said it because he's the almighty God he's going to bring it to pass if God said it because is the god who never failed he's going to bring it to pass so our approach to God is I have been born again I have been redeemed from sin I've been saved from the things of the world I'm here because God told me to be here and God is here to fulfill his promise God don't want us to be church members you know if we're not careful the only identification we have is what church we go to you said no no well but when I remember he was about to pray for that lady and the other one says close the curtain it says well AR you a Christian it says I'm a Methodist it seems like we have the same behavior today aren't you a Believer well I'll go to Christian Life Tabernacle I go to uh what so so in church we become identified to some preachers some church that becomes your identification that's not your identification it doesn't matter where you go the question is do you have a relationship with him do you know him has he done a work in your life and if he has then then seek to establish a personal relationship then your identification is not a church relationship but it's him you and him relationship and here's another one I'm a message believer what do that even mean what is that even mean you don't come for communion you don't come on Wednesday you don't come Sunday night you're a message believer I just said it what is our identification God is not interested in us carrying up some name he wants us to bear his life he wants his life to be your life he wants what's in him to become yours but what I'm saying this it's like it's like a piece of the laundry the Chinese Laundry man remember he talks about that he says what God does he says he takes the two pieces of it's a same piece of paper God takes it and then he cuts it in two it says now one God has it the other is in your heart so when you hear the message of the hour when he come through the message of the hour when others are rejecting it when others are calling it a name when others are just producing it and looking at it intellectually but into your heart is the two pieces coming together what God is looking for and the prophet said what God is trying to do is to take the life that was in Christ who was dead and crucified Calvary he says he took his body up on high and he takes his spirit and he send it to the believer the same life that was in Christ when that life was in Christ the scripture says it was his custom to go to church when that life that was in Christ was in Christ the scripture says that he only did what pleased the father when our life was manifested in Christ the scripture says that he gave himself for the need of others when that life was manifested in Christ he said that I have it says I only do what the father showed me now when when that same life is in you what is that life manifesting God God is not interested in us being church members now remember but but but I'm going to say this we we heard it in the message how can I overcome he says to overcome is to keep life in you he didn't say to overcome is to keep all the doctrines and know every scripture and know how to translate it and know just exactly what it means the overcoming is to keep life whose life it is the Life of Christ in you in fact it said there are those that are in in the church it talks about the log in the water and the purpose of the water is to give life to the log but the log is is rotten right being in the water why because it didn't keep the life in it let me say this the things of the world are not made to keep the life in you everything that's out there is made to challenge and try to take every bit of the Life of Christ Christ out of you this happen and this will go on and and and somebody tell me if there's ever been anybody who's gotten money and gotten enough and say I got enough money and I'm satisfied I mean if Elon musque is not satisfied who can be it's the nature of the world who who can build enough of the worldly things and say I have built enough now I can go serve god what the devil wants you to do we we we rather we we listen to it the other time he wants you to focus on the things that are concerning him so in the meantime as you are doing your life that is supposed to grow in Christ is dwindling it's getting weak it's getting frat it's getting low oh my brother my sister this morning God saying that if your life is gotten low just come to the breasted one this morning just come to mcdc this morning just come to alaria this morning drink from the breasted one nurse from him and he will restore your strength he's not condemning you for going after the things of the world he's reminding you this morning that what you need to put your focus on is to put your focus on the life that he's placed inside of you I'll just skip some for the sake of time it's the promise that God has given you that will keep you but want say he said that God Abraham being fully persuaded that he was able persuaded of who of God that he was able to keep that which he had promised and Bam says this if God has made a promise God will keep that promise that is just as simple as could be don't don't complicate it don't don't don't go and change the circumstance and see if the answer is going to change it doesn't if God made a promise God will keep the promise if God made a promise that he will save you it doesn't matter how deep in sin you are he will save you if God made a promise he will heal you it doesn't matter how sick you are if the doctors are saying that death is the next step it doesn't matter because if God made a promise he will heal you God will heal you being fully persu he says God will he being fully persuaded that that what God had uh he promised he was able to perform it God keeps his promise and Abraham was fully persuaded no matter how ridiculous it looks to the conal mind or any or anyone else he says it looked all right to Abraham because Abraham never looked so much at what the promise was how ridiculous it was he looked at who gave the promise it depended on what it depends on what you are looking at so if you are looking at how difficult the promise is that's a problem but if you are looking at who made you the promise then he's able to bring it to pass then I ask you this morning who are you believing in this morning whose promise Are you standing on this morning the god of the Bible is the Alpha and the Omega is the beginning and the end the promise that he has given you was in existence before there was an Adam a molecule or anything else think about it but one them says before there was a sickness there had to be a Healer otherwise it would run in contradiction with God being all sufficient or An Almighty in other word before your problem came into an existence God already made a reservation for a solution to that problem before you can run into the situation that you are in this morning there was provision in God for you in fact let me say this when he thought about you he thought about the overcoming power that you needed for every circumstance that will come along your way so when he made the promise when he made when he made you he made also the promise of overcoming with you so he didn't make you and say well now Billy's got all the challenges that he's going through how are we going to save him from it no remember the scripture says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world why was the lamb slang before the foundation of the world it was to take care of all the challenges it was to cover up for all the things that's going to happen and then when he makes the promise is for him to know that when I make the promise the promise will come to pass exactly as I made it if the musician will come what say God doesn't learn anything when he makes a promise he doesn't do something and then come back and fixes it and say the first way I did it is not really right I need to go back and change it it says when he's done something when he speaks a word that remain remains for eternity when he does something he does it it says if God can learn then he's really not God then he really not all sufficient but when God speaks something it's the same for eternity and it says God hasn't learned it is not CAU by surprise he's the same everything that he spoke from the beginning is the same every time so those who trust in him the scripture will say will never be ashamed if you stand upon the promise of God it doesn't matter how ridiculous it looks it doesn't matter how dark it gets it doesn't matter how terrible the situation looks like if you stand upon the the word of God God will make his promise to come true what he's asking from us this morning is do you believe my word word Are you standing upon my promise Are you standing upon what I have given are you feeding are you Nursing From The Promise because if you are then you cannot fail as much as God cannot fail but what I'm say that when God calls a Believer he gives you something to believe with that's right when God calls a preacher he gives you something to preach with it's not even your own faith it's the faith of God but says I believe it's in uh uh uh uh perfect Faith the to the believer it's the faith of God that moves in them it's the faith of God that brought you to church this morning it's the faith of God that makes you an overcomer it's the faith of God that causes you to come here it's the faith of God when you run into trouble that Faith begin begin to go to battle that Faith begin to move that Faith begin to feed upon the word of God that Faith begin to move around it's the faith of God that does the work all he's asked you to believe all he ask you to do is to believe his word oh I came across this and I'm pretty sure some of you have heard it it's called Uh footstep up footsteps upon the sand of time and and it's speaks and it speaks about a man and who wrote this I believe it's a poem and he and he wrote and he says it says this it says one night a man had a dream and and he dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord across a colorful Sky flashing scene from his life for each scene he noticed two sets of footprint one belonging to him and the other belonging to God to the Lord it says when the last scene of his life flashed before him he looked back at the footprint and noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprint Footprints he also noticed that it happens at the very lowest and saddest time in his life this really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it and he says Lord you said that once I decided to believe you that you will walk with me all the way but I noticed that during my most Troublesome time in my life there's only one set of footprint maybe that's how you feel toight you said you know I I go sometimes and I I I pray it seems like heaven is shut up I ask it seems like it never really had happens and and and I knock it seems like opportunities are just fleeing away and I I seek it seems like I can't find and it seems like I'm stuck I I just don't know what to do it seems like I'm all alone and God is not even hearing my prayer it said I see one foot Sprint I don't understand why when I needed you the most you abandon me and he said the Lord said unto him my pray Precious Precious Child I love you and I will never leave you it says during your times of trials and tribulation when you see only one set of footprint it was then that I was caring you the only reason you didn't see the other footprint is because you were in my arm the only reason you didn't see the other of footprint you were nursing from me for my strength the only time you see that one set of footprint is because you didn't have the strength to carry on you couldn't put your foot in front of the other you didn't know what I was doing what you were doing and it is in that time that I picked you up I carried you over why because I made a promise to you I'll never leave you I'll be with you till the end my brother my sister that's the same promise is made to you tonight let me say this there's only one man who has the right to say that God has forsaken me and that was Jesus Christ why because heaven forsake Him Earth forsake Him why God forsake Him so you don't have to be forsaken you don't have the right to use that scripture and say God you forsaken me why because he forsook Christ so you don't have to be forsaken the one fruit print you see it's him taking you in his arm and walking you over and and understanding your need and saying you don't understand what I'm doing you don't understand where that opportunity was shut up you don't understand what that opportunity was shut up why because it was going to lead you astray it was going to take you in the path that you didn't know it was when you were lacking strength I am El Shadi ey whatever you're going through this morning you say I waited on the Lord it seems like it's not happening I'm fainting I'm falling away I don't know what to do I'm just falling I'm just rolling in the mud and everything no you're not rolling it's him picking you up it's him let him pick you up this morning let him hold you let him hold you hold to the promise Until the End God bless you let's all stand it's El Shadi ey this morning [Applause] but one them said I'll just read it again and this is another message it speaks about it says now this isn't the message El Shad actually preaching 59416 paragraph 39 it says now after Abraham now after Abraham when he was 9 and9 years old the Lord came to him chapter 17 the next chapter and God appeared to him and said when he appeared to him him to this time he appeared to him in the name the almighty God the Hebrew therefore is El Shadi which means l means god the strong one from Genesis 3 the strong one El Shi God the lifegiver Shi means breast like a woman elshad means breasted pral God appearing to Abraham in the name of strong breasted one it says what a thing to appear to an old man a 100 years old and his body as good as dead after he has made him a promise that he was going to have a baby by his wife Sarah her 19 think of it now what a promise he said Abraham you are old your strength is gone and for the last 25 years you've truly trusted me but now I want to tell you what my name is my name is the breasted one the strong one I'm the breasted God now watch a breasted God not breasted but both spiritual and body wounded for our transgression and with the stripes we are healed breasted one he says paragraph 41 you take a little baby when he's weak and run it down and D running dying through it says dying the mother to take the little baby in his arm lay her at her breast the little fellow Fring and crying but as soon as he began to nurse on the moms what is he doing pulling the mother's strength into his own body it quits crying starts laughing it's satisfied I want to say this don't be satisfied in anything except the word of God [Music] there's nothing that will provide a satisfaction like the
