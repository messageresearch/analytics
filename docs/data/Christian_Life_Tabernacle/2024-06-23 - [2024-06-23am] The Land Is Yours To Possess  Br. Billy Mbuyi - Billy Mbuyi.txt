Description:
The Land Is Yours To Possess | Br. Billy Mbuyi
June 23, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

just lead us Lord this morning in Jesus Christ's name we ask it [Music] amen morning brothers and sisters I just wanted to give a short little testimony um God's just hand of protection on my life and um um my job affords me the ability to drive around sometimes and go places that I haven't always seen But I take the opportunity for the long drives to be able to listen to messages and uh I was last Tuesday heading to Vernon from Fort Worth and U yeah just looking for a message to listen to and uh something came on my heart and I know brother Bram says that the devil hates uh anything that has to do with the book of Genesis or Revelations I was listening to uh something on Revelations and I was a little distracted in my driving but essentially I was on the 287 North um past buoy and it's a very open stretch of road and uh so you know I maybe had my head down I was in the Middle Lane fting with the speaker maybe looking at the text and kind of focusing on my driving and um there was very clear traffic like I said and there was a there was a truck in the in the U in the slow lane and I was in the middle of him and I looked up and next thing I know this big rig just Veer right in front of me and uh I had my head down I looked up and the Lord just helped me just jerk that wheel and if I'd have been in my uh exteria probably would have flipped and rolled because it's top heavy but work rigs little r for it it bit the tire and it just wobbled but the Lord just kind of was there and had his hand of protection and uh luckily I I SW big you know how the back trunks are they they have a rail that's almost head level on a small vehicle and so it could have been very bad but uh the Lord just brought my head up very fast and I just reacted and pulled the wheel and and uh yeah it was just the Lord's hand of protection and then uh the rest of the day the devil harassed me it was very apparent and I just kept a positive attitude and thank God and uh I ended up not have I got to the facility and many of you might know I do MO Mobile X-Ray and um the the the machine wouldn't even work which is 4 and a/2 years I haven't been able to troubleshoot a machine I mean it just every single thing he kept harassing me even pulling the patient up and so I apologized and told my dispatch and drove home and got to listen to three messages that day didn't have one patient and uh just thank the Lord uh the whole way home and um had a wonderful rest of the of the day and I just wanted to just let you guys know that uh he's the same today yesterday today forever and I get a little nervous I could talk to people individually but getting up amongst the the lady gets me a little nervous so but I just felt the Lord wanted me to to share with you guys that and his hand of protection and and we've had a lot of uh wonderful testimonies in the church lately of of just God moving on the scene and being present right now not yesterday not tomorrow but but right now and his his hand of protection and the angels that are encamped about us and and I I just felt the presence of the Lord just really in the vehicle the rest of the day it was pretty Supernatural so I just wanted to thank you and share that [Applause] testimony sister Melinda and sister Lori and joy have a special so we'll just ask him to come sing right this moment e [Music] Val behind me it's easy to trust you when my world is not [Music] unwinding but this is the darkest midnight that my soul has ever seen so I Will Stand My Ground lift my hands to you and sing before the prayer is answered before the battle's

you with a heart full of gratitude to God for blessing me with his this new job and the opportunity to grow and succeed I also want to thank each one of you for your unwavering support and encouragement thank you what a wonderful God we serve very mindful of our Desir Lord whether it's worth no matter how small we think it is he cares about him we'll ask brother Andrew to come up here and pray for the tithes and offerings and I don't have any requests up here but if you have one on your heart make it known to the Lord by the uplifting of your hands and trust that this isn't just for an ordinance sake but he sees the hand it's the effort you make to defy gravity that causes the Lord to come on the scene and he has a short testimony to give good morning we're needy people aren't we you know thank the Lord that he's so mindful of us that he promised that he would meet us here and I'm just here to give a short testimony and um some of you know my testimony um back in 2006 after uh traveling um from Trinidad and Tobago I contracted menitis and it was um something that the Lord worked out so that I can get to the end of the road for my own will and things like that just to make a short testimony out of it um trying not to get too emotional about it but you know whenever you come to that crossroads in life where you're so broken I believe that's the place that God wants every single one of us so that so that no long long will it be you but it'll be the Lord and so um in February 2006 um like I said it's a long testimony but I'll just get to the point I just um after all of the the doctors and everything they didn't give very much hope and so I just prayed a simple prayer Lord if you let me live I'll continue to serve you all the rest of my days no more arguing and so a couple of weeks or excuse me a couple months later um it was around Easter time and the company that I was working for contract some help for me on the other side and they um had three helpers that were going to help me and so I'm I'm I'm at the job and this is in Wisconsin and so I meet the people to help me and we start doing the job and I was only going to be there two days and um the first day I kind of had my schedule all booked up I was going to meet a friend there but but while I was there and uh I got to meeting uh um talking with one of the helpers that was helping me uh we got to fellowshipping a little bit about the Lord and you know I had plans that Friday night to go somewhere else and uh you know the Lord just moved on my heart in a simple way and said why don't you ask him if he knows of a place where I can get some fish you know cuz I believe you know Wisconsin and some up in Northeast whatever they have great fish and so I I ended up asking him I said do you know there's a place where I can get some good fish and he's like you know you know down over there by this way and that way and I'm just like oh you know I guess I wasn't used to Google and everything by that time that was a long time ago but you know the the thing is is he said well you know I was like I don't know where that's at and so the Lord just kind of put it on my heart well ask him if he would take you and so I asked him and he's like like well you know what let me call my wife I I have already plans and so let me call and see and I'll I'll let you know and so he come back and he canceled his plans with his wife and then I called my friend I canceled my plans and so we ended up uh going out to dinner and he showed me this uh you know this place but I'm just here to testify to you that it was in an unexpected time and an unexpected place that God chose to use this individual to share the message with me to give me the church age book to give me the greatest battle ever fought Eagle stir his nest and the stature of a perfect man he played the tape in the car while we were driving it felt like the presence of the Lord dropped in the car and it was very unexpected but you know I believe he was just faithful you know to do what God put on his heart and this is a simple gospel I love how our pastor says this is not a hard cell you know you just share the message you just give give what you've been you've received and I just say it like this and you know from that time he was the one that kept following up with me every couple of weeks he would follow up and give me a call and say hey have you been reading the books or have you have you gone to a message church I'm like Message Church you know there's a lot of things we don't understand but he ended up contact uh brother Dennis McGary and and and so he's the one that introduced or got me the number for Brother David and so I'm happy to report that God is so merciful you know I'm this was almost 18 years ago and I maybe spent three hours with him face to face and this was a long time ago but God in his Sovereign Grace you know the footsteps of a righteous are ordered of the Lord and God just saw fit I ended up turning 49 on Friday and so on Saturday he calls me up and he says hey we're headed that way want to come visit you and so I'm happy to report to you that God is so mindful of us and he cares so much and he's actually here this morning and so brother Julius God bless you he's here with his friend um and they're they're still passing out tracks they're still testifying of the goodness of God and I'm just here to say Thank you Lord I I'm I'm here to say that if God speaks to you just be obedient to what he says amen how many have a need this morning upon your heart and you want God to speak to you and you you want to respond to what God says I I believe he's faithful if you'll just do in Simplicity let's pray together Our Kind Heavenly Father Lord what a God you are Lord what a peacegiver you are Lord how you know God even when we're in the midst of the storms and the voices are raging loud Lord still you come and you speak peace on our raging storms father how we love you Lord how we thank you for your goodness Lord that you would look down and see feeble man Lord and we were in bondage but you didn't want to leave us in that condition so you by Love You

to something and he looks back now after his birthday and to see that the same God he was introduced to he's still holding on to I think for each and every single one of us it's our heart's desire

all that we can ask and Lord we desire to see you shining through us and Lord I don't believe that there's a soul here represented this morning whose request and desire is not to see you shine and we know that we have a lot of lacking and we fell short in a lot of things and but Lord when we think about the things that you have done for us and when we think about where you taken us from and when you think about we think about the price that was paid and Lord the reasonable service we can give back to you Lord is to let your life shine through US Lord and we sincerely ask this morning Lord Jesus may you just help us father through our weaknesses that you may be made strong and Lord you promise that it's not going to be by Almighty by our power but it's going to be by the Holy Spirit quickening Your Word of Life to us and taking us every step of the way Lord we this morning Lord we don't want to focus on our weaknesses Lord though we have many of them and Lord we realize that if we focus on them the only thing we can do is magnify those weaknesses but oh if we can focus on the word of God if we can focus on the promise that you have made us Lord that promise will drop in this morning in the people and you will give us the strength oh God and that will certainly will go out of here stronger than the way we came to know that the Mighty God is living in his people to know that your promise for the end time is true that's our desire this morning Father we ask that you remember our pastor and those that are traveling and we want to commit them into your hands and we ask this morning that you give us a portion of your word that we can Fellowship upon this morning Father when we go out of here that we may say truly it was good to be in the house of God that's the sincere desire of our hearts this morning we commit the service and everything to you and ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen it's good to be in the house of God this morning amen we want to welcome all our visitors and everyone and all of those that are here for the first time God bless you and all the regular God bless you this morning amen I want to like I said want to also remember our pastor continue to pray for him that uh uh I I we we had the opportunity of getting some clips from the wedding and it was wonderful there was a lot of people there and I know some may be traveling back so we certainly pray that the Lord be with with them amen amen amen I certainly just want to appreciate brother B for taking care of the song service this morning amen God bless you he did such a wonderful job God bless you amen I was I was talking in the back and I said that probably remember my first couple of days and probably forgot to take the offering or you know kep people standing or things like that but we're certainly thankful that the Lord is faithful amen let's open our Bibles this morning uh Fellowship around the scriptures and and just uh a a a very uh small thought that we can all uh just come together and fellowship upon and trust that the Lord will be a a blessing for us uh Deuteronomy chapter 1 uh let's start from verse vers uh five amen man brother Paul will be ministering for us this afternoon so uh certainly uh excited about that more excited for the evening service than I am the morning so it said that on this side it says on this side of uh on this side Jordan it says um in the land of Moab uh began Moses to declare the law saying the Lord Our God spake unto us in Horeb and I believe we understand that's the place where God called and gather the children of Israel to give them the the law to give them the Commandment it says ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain it says turn you and take your uh take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh there unto in the plain and in the hills and in the valley and in in the South and by the seaside to the land of Canaanites unto Lebanon unto the Great River the river Euphrates behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them to their seed after them very clear instruction right no ambig ambiguity just go out I want you to now you have gone around the mountain now the direction you're supposed to be going is towards the promise not regressing not going in any other place you you have been given an order and that is to continue to possess the land to go in the direction where you you take what God has promised for you let's also turn in numbers 33 uh verse 51 it says Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye are pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitant of the land from before you and destroy all the pictures destroy all the modern image and quit plug down their high places ye shall dispossess the inheritance of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it very clear he didn't say go dwell with them together with them and go share a space and go do this no dispossess them everything and ye shall divide the land by lot for inheritance among your families and to and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every men's inheritance shall be in the place where is the lot Fallen where is lot Fallen according to the tribe and the and your fathers ye shall inherit it says but if you if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricked in your your eyes and tone in your side and shall Vex you in the land wherein ye dwell moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them let's bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful for your word this morning we just ask that you speak to us Lord and Reveal Your word to us Lord that we may just have Fellowship on it we're committed to you in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you may have your seats this morning I want to speak this morning just for a few minutes uh we're going to be fa I want to call this thought here the land is yours to possess the land is yours to possess uh I want to start off by saying that as you would uh read and and look throughout the message um we we live in the in a very call it a terrible age as as far as the world is concerned if you look at what's happening out there and you look at the the the the land that we are living in the world per se the world is in a a very desperate situation and whatam will even say it's a it's a terrible time for the world but it's a glorious time for the Believers so the world as far as the world is concerned uh we could certainly say uh this is the best that they will ever had whatever is happening out there however bad it is it's the best that they could ever had because all that happens afterwards it's going to get worse and worse and we've been told that and said they they yet they are they give people a a false sense of security but yet within it there's uh there's an oncoming destruction that's behind it and we can say today with the is in technology and all of that every time you turn around there's something new and there's something coming up and there's another uh move of Technology that's going to boost the economy and all of those things and the prophet will say that yeah we are we have more science we have more education but yet at the same time we have more diseases than we've ever had before we have more depression than we ever had before we have more sin like than than we've ever had before we have more de Vision than we ever had before and more confusion that that ever was before so the world if we look at it in the lens of the scripture the world is in the spirit of of the end time but when I'm says the spirit of the end time is the world is in the spirit of destruction they're going to destroy themselves they said God is not going to destroy man man will destroy man why because that's what was promised as far as the world is concerned what happen uh the because when you reject the word of God that was promised to you when you reject the only provided way of God the only thing that you left with is judgment and it's not because God didn't care because the scripture will tell us that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but it's because people have rejected the only provided way that God has given the only way that's supposed to get them out of sin the only thing that can make a change in their life they rejected it so when they've rejected it the only thing that's left with them is Judgment so God is not willing that men should perish he's not intending for God me to perish but he knows at the same time that when he sends his word to the unbeliever they will not receive it so that's why will even say that when Jesus died he didn't die for the whole world per se say because he knew that the those that were not part of the beginning or those of the children of God will reject it but only those that were predestinated to receive it will receive it but the world in general even though God provided a way they will reject it but in the same time now he telling us to the believer this is the Glorious age now I I I just want you to think that for a moment think about that there's not going to be another age after this think about this age being the age of the finishing of all the work God has been working in since the beginning of the age think about this being the end time where after us there's not going to be anything butam calls it in different ways just for summary so I can move on this morning this is the day of his we live in the day of the coming of the Lord the Glorious Day we live in the time where God has promised to make himself one with his people there's not another time where butam will say that all that God was orted into Christ all that Christ was orted into his people into his bride or the church the time where the fullness of God will be manifested in his people not another time only in this time that's why brother bam says all of the prophets and all the sages of old they wanted to live in the time that you are living in so we shouldn't take it lightly we have to take it for what God has promised it to be we have to be excited for what's before us we don't have to live in depression we have to live in happiness and knowing that the world is falling apart that's what was promised for them but for us we are promised the entire promise of God the entire book of Promise of God is Promised for this age and Pam said again this is the age of the super church not in any other time the church is called the super church this is the age that God is building a super Church a church like never before this is the time where God is building an invisable army is a time where we are returning to the true purpose of God's creation the true purpose of God's creation what God wanted to do in the beginning what what God showed in a span of time through the life of Adam what we saw Adam do what we saw Adam go through the fellowship that he had with God and all of those things we can see today and say that God has been working by sending forth the prophets and he came and he showed through the prophet that God wanted to work and restore man and he came by his own son Jesus Christ and to manifest and to spill his blood and to redeem the people but in the end time the whole purpose run its course and comes to the finish line now God is here manifesting the purpose of what has been working since the beginning of creation to have a people that the same Harmony that existed between Christ and the uh Christ and God that God will take that same Harmony and have it with him and his people the same Fellowship that Adam had with God God is coming this age to restore that to that same Fellowship so it's the time where we can look in the Bible and see that we This is the End Time am and and and and the reason why we say this thing is is so we can understand the the importance or the gravity of the time that we are living this is not time to play games this is not time to to be lukewarm you will be left behind you will miss it if you play games this is the time where God has taken everything that he was he poured into his church it's the time where we are supposed to be locked in we are supposed to be living in we are supposed to be so locked in in the promise so that the reality of God will be manifested it's not time to look to the left or look to the right it's not time to get distracted it's the time to know that I have been given a word a word to change me a word to prepare me for the body change that's around the corner now remember we are promised that this will happen at any time the prophet will say in the uh the message my life uh the the life story uh preaching 51722 paragraph 11 it says and I believe that I'm talking to a people who are are looking for the Lord to come and because remember he appears to only those that are looking for his appearing not to everybody those that are are are are distracted they won't see his appearing those that are caught into things that don't provide life those that Miss to understand the purpose for the end time they will not see is appearing so he's he's looking for those he's he says you I says we are looking for the coming of the Lord and he says and I believe we are right in the shadow of his coming right now oh what a glorious time to know that the same Blissful day it says that some Blissful day he will break through the the Eastern Horizon and it says and come down and receive his church it says I'm so happy today by his grace that I'm that that is numbered me with you all it says and I believe that we are going there I believe by his grace that he will let me uh go with you it says and then we are going to have plenty of time to talk won't it be just it says just forever I'm saying this this morning what we should be looking for is what's next around the corner oh I tell you just around the corner all the trials and all the things that we go through think about all that the devil is attacking you for all of that will be worthwhile because you'll be on the other side it's not it's not going to take long don't be despair this morning don't think how long how long just continue to press on continue to stay the course

talk about his goodness and all the provision and all that he is done let me say this don't give up this morning don't give in don't look at your life and say war is me I keep running into trouble you keep as much trouble as you are in know that the Lord is with you this morning know that the Lord is preparing you for what's coming around the corner and I think sometimes we forget that those things are put on us because God is trying to build us in as a character that's fit for us to live on the other side oh I was just to jump on the oh let me say this it's God building a character that's fit to rule let me say this how is the J how is the Saints going to judge the world if you stood there and you didn't have the character to judge with all that's happening is God preparing you he's getting you in shape he putting you in position because remember the prophet said the only thing we're going to take over the other side is our character we're not going to take our riches we're not going to take our money we're not going to take take everything we build around here the only thing we're going to take is our character and because he knows that he let those things come upon you one of this glorious morning you'll wake up and then all of the sudden how you going to know you're going to know because you are part of the numbers it says Rapture is a revelation to the believer how is it a revelation the same Revelation that came and save you out of sin the same Revelation by which God is healing you the same way when that time comes let me say this you are not going to miss it why

wonderful it says I look across the table and happen to see sitting across there but it willing it says looking at the different ones it says well there was a there was there was at a uh a conesville meeting and I know he says I kindly believe that we just have to cry just a little bit he says it says just cry out a little bit don't you think so it says when I reach across the table and see it all down all through all down through there the old battle scar veteran bow down it says bow across the table holding one another hands whipping for Joy what it be wonderful I can hear I can hear announcements of silver a blast of trumpet come out the king in his Beauty and in his majesty robe around him walking down alongside with all his own hands and wipe the tears of all oh my brother my sister he will wipe away your tears you don't have to wipe your tears by yourself anymore why he's preparing a place for you there's a place for you at the table and don't miss it and I want to say this morning I don't care what difficulties you're going through I don't care how hard your life is what I ask of you this morning is you need to make Rapture your priority you need to make the Kingdom of Heaven your priority but what I'm say is you put God first and God will show himself take all that you need in this world but give me Jesus let me sit at that table oh when I read this this morning I just begin to play the scene in my own mind just sitting there there he comes and he just comes and he began to walk around and wipe the tears of each one at the table and let me say this the tble is reserved for you this morning message is an invitation for you to come to it not let the cares of Life take away from one of the Glorious the the Glorious thing that can ever happen it says the king in his beauty is Majesty robe around him walk down along the table he says well take take his own hands not your hands his own hands and wipe the tears out of our eyes and say don't cry now it's all over oh I can't wait to hear that it says amen that's the day I'm living for that's why I pra and beg and plead for the lost souls and do all that I know to do to get them to the Lord Jesus then I want to sit down at his feet and wear his crown like these people and where he where and at his feet and and and hear him like these people but when I'm will say about that man I believe he calls him Mo and different names he said and then he said when he gets to heaven and said there's your robe and the crown and says don't talk to me about no robes or crown let me just look at him for a thousand years the one who gave his life the one whom we all serve this morning what we what we are looking for is for that to become the main motive of Our Lives we we don't want anything to take that place we don't want anything to take and to come over that we want everything that we do the only for us to be that glorious morning that glorious day when we sit around the table so the objective of a Believer is when I sit am asking am I my my my my my objectives and my goal the things that I'm doing am I actually living for that day am I actually making decisions that will lead me to that place am I actually in my heart having the fire inside of it to continue to lead me to guide me so I can live for that glorious day because we have to remember the prophet said this I don't know how this all fit but I'll just say what he said he say that the decisions you make today determines your Eternal destination some will claim well I'm predestinated but he the same who say that you are predestinated say that the the the decisions we make today determines your Eternal destination so what we need as a Believer is not a free will or a a free range chicken that just does what he wants to do no what we want is those that are governed by the love of God Guided by the word of God they only do what pleases the father their heart's desire is to see God move into them their heart's desire is to fulfill the word of God butam says in the message say testimony testimony of of uh raising raising the dead boy the dead boy he says and then it says so they claim they got an underground air bunker Air Bomb air air bomb shelter and everything and planes and that can srl around out missiles and the bombs and everything in every nation and every city in the United States it says uh they have and and send out missiles that will bomb Every Nation every city in the United States in five minutes with atomic bombs and send them right from from that place there so brother we are living in a terrible age we are living in a time when men are to get right with God seek God CUA the hours coming when destruction is just as sure to strike as I'm standing here in the Pulpit the tomorrow is not guarantee destruction is guarantee destruction is coming this world cannot continue in the trajectory that that's in we are bound together he says how can we escape this friends if you neglect God and and treat God the way we are he says how can we how can we do it he says when folks are going down through the cities and cities official drinking whiskey and celebrating Christmas and things like that he says how can we um uh expect God to do anything different than destroy the place isn't that right the whole nation is polluted anywhere the whole world is polluted that's right the only thing the only only one thing left that that's the coming of Jesus Christ the son of God the only hope in the world that we have flee to him tonight let me say this a bunker will not protect you for what's coming the the the the economy will not protect you from what's coming your job is not going to protect you from what's coming the only Escape is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the only bunker that will not be destroyed Jesus Christ is the only way of Escape that God provided so if you are a sinner friend this morning I invite you this morning to come to Jesus for protection anything else will not protect you and why will Jesus protect you because Jesus is the word of God the the scripture says that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away anything that men build will pass away heaven will pass away Earth will pass away but the only saing Grace or the only protection that we have as a Believer is the word of God and I want to say this the end time message is our Promised Land if you if you right if I could just stay with me for Just A Moment Like I said I'm trying trying not to be too long we we could look in the scripture what R we talk about the first Exodus that God came and he brought the children of Israel out of one natural land to another in the second Exodus he came and he brought them from one spiritual condition where were're in uh denomination as per say where the were uh uh the scribes and all of them he brought them says he brought them to the baptism of the Holy Spirit In other words from one spiritual condition to another spiritual condition now in the Third Exodus he's coming he's taking us some where we are and bringing us into the Rapture now I want to say this the the Third Exodus is the closing of the circle I want you to think about that the Third thir Exodus is not is now the finishing of the whole work the Third Exodus is now moving from mortality into immortality the Third Exodus the people of the first Exodus they were move from natural land to a natural land they die the second Exodus they were brought from one condition to another and years came to pass those that came after they denominated but in the Third Exodus God is coming in he's taking some way we are he's bringing us right back into what God it is it is mine from the beginning and it's a finishing of the circle for God to come back and say I have completed my work for God to come back and bring men right back into what he desired for him to be so I want to say this this morning so when we have received the Third Exodus or this promised land that we are in we as Believers wants to possess what God has given us we want to possess the Third Exodus we want to possess The Exodus at the end time we want to be partakers we want whatever is been revealed to us as children of God we want whatever the promises for our age as Believers of the message we want to possess it when says in the invisible Union it says may I say this what is oh I love this paragraph 192 it says may I say what this is uh he says may I say what has got to do what is this got to do with Thanksgiving he says what what are you talking about P it says here it is quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving it says what a message that that for the occasion it says to me yes indeed it says now listen to this it says the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for the new found way of life Stay With Me amen he's talking about when those the founding fathers of uh uh uh of America when they came over they were thankful for the new found way of life being separated from the old English denomination and Cates it says they they could marry in the new in the new anointed word of the Rage that's right the new anointed word of the rage for that day it says now in 194 it says now so I said so can we be thankful as Pilgrim like Abraham separated ourselves from the new from the from the things of the world it says all all of the associates Associates and Abraham was a pilgrim God separated us from all the dead denomination it says I'm speaking Across the Nation now all dead Creeds and to what separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day so the the end time word is a new land for us is a new opportunity is a land that man has never been before is a returning to the Garden of Eden is a returning into God's original plan all the others they came and they denominated they came and they denominated but the end time at the opening of the seals God came and brought to the Believers a new land and I want to say let's explore the new land let's not just talk about it let explore it what is this new land's got to do what is it that it's in the new land I I hear that in the new land there's Rapture for us I want to grab some of that I hear that in the new land we have been given power like Adam had to speak the word and it will come to pass I want some of that I I hear that in the new land I can come and I'll be healed I want some of that healing I hear that in the new land if my brother's crop is drying out I can speak the word and rain will come down I want some of that we are partakers of divine nature we are not just to speak about it but we are to partake of it the trouble with the children of Israel is God gave them the land they stood there and they refused to conquer it come on you read in the Bible yeah it is I given you all the land but you read further it says that but the tribe of this they failed to conquer that but this tribe failed to conquer that why the land was given to them so I say let's conquer the land that God has given us the prophet says it says paragraph 196 195 I believe it says Pentecostal dried up like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it says it says Pentecost are dried up dried up and died like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it says it's more it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together it says good people in there yet it's got to be it's got to come to be to be com out it says what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message you notice that the Seven Seals he says which all the mysteries of the seven Church Ages was was sealed what was sealed with a seven seal the reformers didn't have time to do it to do it in their time they didn't they didn't live long enough but this blessing this blessed revelation of the s h it's open to us in the last day from a prophet from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona what is this attraction on the mountain now let me ask you Believers of this message what is it about this message that's different from Pentecost from Baptist from presbyterian from others we should know that right because it's not the same thing that's right this message in the seventh age in the God sent a prophet with a message and it was a message to call out a people from denomination but that was the first part but the second part was the revealing of the son of man himself who was supposed to come to make himself known God came in Revelation 10: 7 he came and he dropped down and he opens up the seals and he came and he gave it to his Prophet so he can speak to you now he came this whole denomination was constantly speaking to you from the man's standpoint because all they had was with the the intellect of man all they hadam says there were reformers and the had didn't have access to what a prophet was and he says but but to the seventh one it had to be a prophet he had to be a prophet and when God called The Prophet on the scene the prophet came he brought to us what in God's back part of the Mind from the beginning God's original plan for your life God original plan for what you were to be from the beginning when he created you his desire for you what he created you to be and I want to say this morning that should be something that we hold on to every day [Applause] you go the things happen you go through trouble don't forget don't lose yourself in your trouble thinking oh oh it's me and all of that remember you are a son of God remember I am made to reflect God I'm made to be God on Earth I'm made to be God in the circumstance and I invoke upon my God's ability to resolve it because remember the the message that the prophet brought out outside of all the other reformers he's now pointing you to what was in the beginning by predestination amen he looked at you and was fellowshipping with the brother and I said he said but you know don't isn't somebody saved when they come to the altar I said I said well it's true but it's not what does that mean now if you look at it from the main standpoint that person is saved but if you look at it from God's standpoint that person is only coming to the realization of what they were if you look at your life from the man standpoint you just struggl is you know you're just trying to do this and trying to do that and trying to do this but oh my if you can look from God's 10o he's got you exactly where he wanted you to be his ear telling you you are a son possess your land if sickness come into your body possess your land if trouble come into your land possess your land I have given you the power to do it why Christ speak the word oh let me tell you after the seals all the sermons title change and he began God calling upon you there's a man here who can turn on the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday the invisible Union why is is he doing that he's calling you to what you were supposed to be in the beginning he doesn't want you to operate just as a man he wants you to operate as the god that's been placed [Applause] here in the testimony of the rais after raising the dead boy he continues on paragraph 14 it says now he said there's Palestine I swore to Abraham 400 years and something years ago that I was going to give it to him and now I say it's yours I give it to you amen and then so he says to you to his seed says I give it to you thank Lord now how clear can that be and if it is true then why do we have so much hard time oh Lord if you will only give it so how many times does he have to say he's given it to you is it scriptural is it according to the word he's giving it to you is it the will of God is it the word of God he's giving it to you and the scripture says God is not a man that he should lie or a son of men that he should repent God is not one that would give it to you and come and take it away he's not going to give you and say well I've given you but you are not worthy of it I'm taking it away or as the expression will go God is not an Indian giver he will give and require something back I have given you the land and so he says I like this it says and now look here is where I want you here is uh here's where I want you to see he says Now isn't it strange now he said it's yours but it's just full of haites jebusites Canaanites and all kinds of enemies in there they are walled up heavy now it's yours go take it it's yours now I give it to you but you go get it huh it's mine with all the trouble that's in it yeah yes it's yours when God gives you something God doesn't care right he's not moved but what's in there on when when the word says you are healed it's regardless of what diseases is in your body now I like I said or if I could just if if you could just take the the the mind that I want to bring this morning morning is let's not look at things from the man man's standpoint let's move to the God's standpoint of viewing things when God has given it to you there's trouble in it there's all kinds of enemies in it but his word says I have given it to you why because if God gives it to you God will make a way for you to possess it if God gives it to you his word that says that I give it to you has the provision for you to overcome every enemy in it you don't have to go and figure out and say well God has given it to me so let's figure out a way for us to go get it no you just go and say this is mine I'm taking it I don't care how strong the enemy is let me ask you this how how is it possible that Abraham with ply words with his servants can go and overcome Kings but the scripture says they were untrained servants it will take ply shares and it will take just instruments around it will go against an army and overcome them you tell me how they did it I'll tell you by what promise they did it God told Abraham look northward look Eastward look Southward look everything he says everything that your eyes can see I have given it to you and it's by it was by that promise that they overcame so it didn't matter if they show up empty-handed God was on their side and let me tell you it doesn't matter it's not how strong the enemy is it's who's on your side who's on your side when when when you run into trouble don't forget who's on your side when the enemy comes in like a flight don't forget who's standing across from you don't forget who's standing by you the prophet said you want to challenge what I'm saying you come stand by here and nobody showed up why because it didn't matter what they were up to it didn't matter how educated they were he knew who was standing by him and he knew that as long as God is standing by me he doesn't matter what the opposition is oh my looks like we'll have to continue another time he says now now that's the people today if you would only see when I tell you about Divine Healing you would say well brother brandham look I was prayed for last night I can't move my hand anymore now this applies to every promise it's the same formula I can't move my hand anymore it says that don't have one thing to do with it so there's the dimension of what's happening and then there's the dimension of the problem he saying that the reason why that is a problem for you because you're walking in the dimensions of human I'm bringing you up a level so you can see the dimension where things actually let me say this the word is what brought the world into existence the word is what changes the world the word is what brings things into existence the word that's why he says use the word and nothing else why because he says the children of Abraham they are those that called things that are not as though they were in other word they take it out out from existence it doesn't exist and they bring it into existence and the thing take things that are into existence that the devil has brought and they bring it out of existence is that what he said they call those things which were not as though there were and things that are as though they were not what a formula I wish I could use it every day I wish when things just blow up in my face I go oh I just erase that it doesn't exist I wish when I just create trouble for myself I just look I said oh I just wiped out of way you have been given the power to do that don't forget it you are a son of God that's the power that reside in you did the prophet say that the man fully surrendered in the hands of God is omnip omnipotent he said that is all [Applause] powerful them Israelites why sure God just didn't get up there and take his brush I love this I'm having a good time so so I hope you are with me this morning this is the only time I feel really good and Swip them all out he said now come in and go in here you are sit down never did God do that am he could have killed all of them and said you just go and drag the dread dead body and take it he said no but listen why you show me it says you show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my Works God wants to see your faith manifested he wants you to walk by faith if even I can even go further said the prophet often time he will come and says God I'm waiting for a vision I'm waiting for a vision one time said it's the same he looked at it and said it's the same God if God showed me a vision and he will go and I'll go and I'll do it because when I have a vision I don't need faith God showed me I just go and I follow if this thing has to be here I just wait there I don't move things I just wait until they move through the place and I'm going to go do it I know God showed me the vision I don't have to have any faith it's going to happen but then it says but then if God showed me by faith if he told me by faith to go do it he said he asked the question he says but it's still going to be the same hands that's going to be on the sa so whether it be Vision or no vision it's the same hands that's going to do it in fact the same prophets come back and they said that the word is above the vision right right it the word is about the it says we have a more excellent voice it says the word when the word comes the word is the supreme authority where am I it says you've got to go do it and you've got to fight for every inch of the ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you've got to fight for every inch of ground tow to Mark with Satan it says isn't that right friends this is not a picnic this is a Battleground see you never come here to eat cookies and so forth you are in a battle I realize I've been trying to stay away from preaching about the battle but everything I preach about war all the time and you know shows you how much I like to fight he says one place and he says if all you can move is your toe just move that toe it says tomorrow you'll go from a toe to a foot the next day you believe you're going to move your leg come on and the next day you believe you're going to move everything and I'm just paraphrasing because I'm trying to save time now he said if you prayed for a mountain and you look like it didn't move and all that happened was one grain of sand that went out of it this message is wonderful you probably couldn't even see with a naked eye just know that it's already happen I'm speaking about the power of the spoken word oh brothers and sisters if we could rely on the word more than we rely on our own abilities if we could rely on God's word more than we could rely on our own mind your mind is not going to do it your strength is not going to do it that's why the scripture says let this mind that was in Christ be also in you that he taught it not robbery to be equal with God and he came and all he desired was the will of the father to happen let me say this it doesn't matter whether it's death or life as long as it's the will of God that's what we desire he says in the message testimony of the Dead rais Bo he says he said says paragraph 15 it says could you imagine the United States Army train a man and send him around and eat cookies and so forth and give him the uniform and his gun and train him and go out to fight and defend the nation and then it says that's what we've got to do we've got to defend our god-given right I want you to hear that god-given right how do you know God your god-given right by the opening of the seals you are being told what your God given right is you hold on to that so God given right this right was given to you by God he says what God said it's ours let's stand right Toe to Toe with Satan I wanted to call this message standing Toe totoe with Satan it says the whole word is constructed and I want to say this the stand to to to Satan take the word and I'm sorry and what's the next one can you just and then say say uh say they are ours we believe them he says you just write you just might as well we believe them you just might as well move back because you haven't got nothing nothing at all it says you haven't got it Satan hasn't got one legal right of anything anything he's got anything he's got is defeated the only thing he is is a scarecrow that's all he cannot bother you a man that's born of the spirit of God he's is nothing at all that he can harm him there's nothing at all that he can that he can at all can harm him so a man that's born of the spirit of God is a man who understand that I have been given my god-given right I'm standing here by the word of God I'm speaking you by the word of God I'm walking by the word of God I'm doing everything I'm doing that's why the scripture says everything you do you do in the name of Jesus Christ why because that's your god-given right knowing that if you stand and you do it in the name of Jesus Christ Satan has no permission and will say another place if he shows up just cut at him if he comes in your way just cut it open and move forward if he showed up he says boo say boo devil to him if he showed up cut him open and go forward why because it's your god-given right now he says this and and and and and he continues on paragraph 16 it say and wait it says and now Satan can push things over on you are you with me now Satan can push things over on you just keep shoving it out it says shove it out sh shoving you out he says if if I went to my house to tomorrow night and I look up there and they moved in they move into my house a big bunch of people that they were drunken and prostitute and carrying on he says well I'll put them out he says well how are you going to do it he says they say I'm a human this house is made for human I'm can I can live here too I say this belongs to me hear me out this belongs to me this is my legal possession I've got the abstract deed here at the courthouse that shows this belong to me you cannot stay here any longer I'll serve notice on them they have to move if you if they didn't the law there's a law downtown that will make them move is that right so what we want to do this morning as Believers is to know what is our god-given right right and know that within us God has given the abstract deed so that we can go and tell the devil this is not yours this is not yours he says that well anything that Satan puts on you in a way of sickness whatever it is he says every Born Again person has the abstract warrant has a warrant from God the holy spirit is here to put any devil out not you the holy spirit is here because remember bam says the holy spirit is the enforcer of the word when you believe the word when you believe that God Is A Healer the holy spirit's job is to enforce healing in your body the holy spirit is to make the word a reality to the believer so don't ever think the holy spirit is some other when you believe the word of God for anything there has to be some Spirit somewhere there has to be someone there has to be the word one who spoke the word who can come and take that word and make it a reality to you so he saying the holy spirit will come he will put the devil out he will put the devil out he will serve notice onto him in the name of Jesus CU he has no legal rights I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases is our right he says he was wounded for our transgression he was stri he was stried for our iniquity uh uh by he was uh with the stripes we are healed it says but you got to go over and take it now let me just go a little deeper here for a second and we'll try to close soon an abstract Deed by definition it says in essence an abstract the abstract is the title is an abstract of a title is a chronological document that summarizes everything that has happened with the title of a property is that confusing so I hope we you stay with me and I know we know these things so an abstract has the complete history of what the property how many owners they had what the lean is on it everything that has to do about that property so when the opening of the seals came God came down and he gave us the abstract what is the abstract the abstract he now telling you where you came from how you got in the condition that you are in and who you really belong to am so our right as what ram calls it our god-given right is our understanding that we have received from this message that what we have what we are how the devil came and caused men to fall Jesus came and he paid the price but yet there are so many in captivity today what God wants his children to know is you were created for the purpose of worshiping God for the purpose of serving God and he has done everything it doesn't matter what happened to you through the course he paid a price so at the end you can serve him again and that's why say Satan hate Revelation because Revelation is what that that's what opens up to you we are sitting here knowing that Satan has no power whatsoever he's a bluff the prophet calls him butam speaks in God's provided way he says notice now you say I bought a piece of ground isn't that it says isn't it your it's it isn't yours yet until you've got an abstract but if you got an abstract it shows that everything that ever against that piece of property of was tricking off it says then when you've got when when you've become a Christian and accepted Christ as your savior then it says when God sends down the abstract it shows that no matter what your father did what your mother did what anybody else did your mother your Daddy might have been a drunker a prostitute whatever it is every sin is strick off it's stricken off it says You' got the extra title there's nothing that can put it off off of it he says and look everything that's on that ground Belongs to You amen he says and when you are you are in Christ Jesus the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God Belong To You belong in the church amen it's an abstract uh title deed it says you it's yours it belongs to you it's it quickens your mortal body oh my I think of it so let me say this this morning yeah we all gather you know how many are thankful for God giving us a new building but yet we are Sunday night and Wednesday it's pretty much what 50% what is really the purpose of our creation what is it that really we are striving for and looking for in this life and I'm not coming from the condemnation standpoint because it's not going to do you any good and I can give testimonies and I probably don't have time to do that but I believe that if you desire a job that can allow you to be here Sunday nights and Wednesdays God can make it happen because he done it for me in my younger days I took a job that was I couldn't be here on Wednesdays but God made a way for I can switch in a different position where I could be here the devil came and offered me more money to return to the old position I turned him down in turning him down God created another position for me that's the position I've held for almost 20 years now it's not by my strength and we can go down the road here people have testimony how many have a testimony like that just raise your hand people that come here on Wednesday and Sunday night it's not because they can make they are stronger than the other the rest of us it's because if you show God your true heart desire but whatam says people stay home on Wednesday to watch I love suszie and all of that but God the Church of God is open yes but says if the church is open he will be there can I read the CR he says that if you are if you are truly born again you would esteem his word more than the meat now I'm I'm really coming down to possessing the land why don't we possess that land and say that the devil has got me so wed up you know I I'll tell you this anybody who's this every time I make extra money the devil finds a way to pull it off every time I'm like oh man if that deal works out I'm going to get me some money and all of the sudden I bills showed up that I didn't even know existed where did this come from how did my insurance double you see so it's trying to train us and I believe this with all my heart so we can understand that we don't live by our own physical effort it's by the word that we live I believe if something showed up where I couldn't afford it God will make a way for me to afford it the word is here for our protection yes a Christian has to have a healthy relationship with the word of God when we hear it is our promised land is what God has given us to give us the power to overcome with it's what's been given us for us to move into another position it's what's been given us for us to be ready for that other land that we just talked about but yet we hear the word who say oh I'm going no you don't have to make up anything I'm not asking anybody ready to go quit the job I'm asking you to go to God and say that I desire this how do I get it and let God reveal that to you amen this church was not buil for lack of challenges Co came by and all kinds of things and we pray seems like it was not possible not possible challenges and everything but God inspired our pastor and we came and we plowed through and everything and he did all that he could and then we have this building but how are we showing our Thanksgiving for it how are we showing our appreciation for what God has done for us how how is it that we're showing the urgency of the time that we are living in see so the word is not given for us to look at it and just read it and say press God we're going to get the promised land he's given for when you hear things like this you go okay what is the promise I was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of God a Believer thinks is is the word of God more than Meats it's good for brothers together it's it's it says as David will say that it's beautiful for the bers to gather together and he says speaks about those things God you said in your word that it's wonderful for a Believer I don't want to be being somewhere else whether it be my job or anything else to take me away from the house of God why because by being here I'm showing on whose side I am let me say this the church support is not just money your presence is a support what you put in your prayer is a support supporting one another encouraging one another it's part of the support and let me say this this morning what we need to possess our Promised Land we need to take the revealed word of God and any room in our lives that's lacking that presence of God we need to say God I'm going to go and possess this you have given me the word I want to go and possess this and if you la money to put gas on everything I think God can provide that too if he send the disciple to get get him fish and get him out and take the money and pay the taxes I think he could do that he's done few Miracles he's known for being the god of the impossible but what says God keeps his word you know we read this message I was I I just I don't want to be too long if the musician could come we it talks about you know I I read like sometimes the voice of God reports and everything thing it said that believers trying to go to church and they get over someplace there's a flooded River they take the message book and some of you know this they lay it down and they pray and the river come down and they cross over to go to church that's your God that's the God of this message but whatam says we need to lift him out after the history we need to lift him up out out of the history let's not just keep him the god of the Bible who reside inside of the Bible the god of the Bible wants to be your God this morning he wants to live your life this morning he wants to walk with you this morning he wants to fight your battle this morning he wants to help you possess the land in fact baram says one place the reason why he didn't let them overcome the whole land in one time he says because of the Beast we're going to rise up on the land the reason he did is he wanted them to overcome one piece at the time one foot at the time he wanted to have fellowship with them he wants to have Fellowship in your overcoming he want to show you that he can overcome by a song he can overcome by a shout he can overcome by a word he can overcome by all means he can overcome by taking a lamp and and and and striking it and go causing confusion if you go read all the children of of Israel overcame he overcame by various different ways but all by his word let not this be a condemnation this morning but let it be something you resolve in your heart and say this morning God I'm a Son of God I I need to be in service for you you didn't create me so I can just make an extra dollar these hands were made to be raised for God my voice was given to me to speak the blessings of God my fruit were made for me to walk in the direction that God wants me to be my whole body was made for me to worship God so I can't take it just put a service for other things I want to use it for God I want every inch of my life to be used for God and if that's my purpose if that's what my desire is I believe that that same God will raise up out of History because when you when you believe his word you're calling him to come by your side and say watch now I'm going to prove my word to be true why he proves his word by [Applause] I don't know about you I I look at my life and and most of the time I'm ashamed I have so much overcoming to do so much possession to do I look and I go oh we haveed such a glorious message this message was just not preached to us and as a knowledge message so we can know it but this message was preached with power and demonstration of the spirit the very things that's promised in it God came and manifested it in the life of the messenger that's we have seen a surrendered son what he can do we have seen what the power of God in The Believer can bring to pass we have seen it so God was not going to be just to just tell us what's going to happen and and not show was an example he showed an example even in the very life of the prophet and and we call him the sheave wave offering so we as Believers we can look and say that oh I just don't hear the word itself but I actually have an example in front of me that I can become this is actually how I can become and I want us to come this morning and say look love is mine is my possession the holy spirit is my possession a good job to so I can come to church is my possession whatever it is sickness getting out of my body healing is my possession whatever I need is my possession he's given me that so I can be in position to serve him but whatam says it's in the line of duty anything that came when when Moses came to the Red Sea they were walking towards the Red Sea the Red Sea was on the way but whatam says that God looked at the Red Sea with Angry Eyes Hallelujah why because he was on the path to the promised land and let me say this to you anything that stands in your way that same God is here to look at it with Angry Eyes so it'll open up but the question is is it in our hearts to give all that we have all that we are to see that promise come to pass because if it's not then we're not going to ask it if it's not then we're going to be just happy with the piece of land that we have and say oh you know I decided that but you know I'm just fine with this and I desire to serve God but you know I'm just fine with here you know no it's your land your children is Your Land The Lost Ones is your land [Music] the land is not just given so you can have what you want and then say well praise God no the Holy Spirit was given so you can be in service for God where if he had a need he can come and say son I need you over there and you can say yes Father I'm at service for you that's the position we desire this morning and we can only get it by the word of God because he promise promised it to us let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful Lord [Music] and we desire to see your promised word a reality into our lives and father we pray this morning that if we have any lacking father let your spirit move upon us and Quicken the word word into our hearts and Lord that we may establish our life in a way that it will be at your service at all times father whether we are at our jobs or wherever we are Lord that we may have the heartbeat inside of us that always wants to serve you oh God lord the scripture speaks about how the cares of Life often time will come and it will try to obscure and try to cover over but Lord God we know know that your promise is a reality to us this morning we come this morning and say that let our roots go into the ground and let it be established and let's let us water it oh God so we may bring the increase father forgive us where we have fallen short I say this morning Lord give us the strength oh God give us the power give us what we have need of so we may go and overcome the land we commit all that we are to you Lord and and our heart's desire is to see the manifestation of your promise into our midst so
