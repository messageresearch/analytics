[23:15] you know the end from the beginning and
[23:17] that you're mindful lord and as we heard

[23:27] before there was even time or space and
[23:30] you were the lamb that was slain before
[23:31] the foundation of the world lord

[24:03] lord we don't know all the ways that you
[24:05] would lead us to the promised land lord

[24:08] we're asking that you would have mercy
[24:09] upon the lord that you would raise him
[24:11] out of that bed
[24:13] that he could find himself in the house
[24:15] of god giving you all the praise and
[24:16] glory and honor
[24:18] for your healing touch where we continue

[36:26] amen i don't plan on wearing mine very
[36:28] long i want to take it and lay it at his
[36:30] feet
[36:31] amen well i you almost like coming to
[36:35] church i tell you what
[36:38] oh my come out in weather like this and
[36:42] have church
[36:43] amen must be a hunger down on the inside
[36:45] and
[36:46] so i believe we can have church tonight
[36:49] and
[36:50] we'll look back at this one day as a
[36:52] fond memory and say i'm all my you
[36:53] remember that time brother nathan came
[36:55] and preached during a blizzard in texas
[36:58] but amen i pray god makes it more
[37:02] memorable but because of more than just
[37:05] that tonight but
[37:06] amen genesis chapter 3 thank you
[37:09] musicians and god bless you richly
[37:11] genesis chapter 3 we'll turn tonight and
[37:14] want to say again
[37:15] it's certainly an honor to be here with
[37:18] you
[37:18] um even if it's about 30 degrees
[37:22] colder than it normally is in texas this
[37:24] time of year it was good to be here i
[37:26] think
[37:26] don't worry we're going to take the cold
[37:28] weather and leave and it's going to be
[37:29] about 67 by this time next week it looks
[37:32] like so
[37:35] but uh certainly been an honor and a
[37:37] privilege to be here
[37:38] certainly appreciate the fellowship of
[37:40] the ones that we've got to fellowship
[37:41] with and
[37:42] appreciate brother david giving us the
[37:44] invitation and opportunity to come and
[37:46] and minister for you
[37:48] and uh appreciate the the spirit
[37:51] that god has placed in him as a pastor a
[37:54] shepherd over the flock here and
[37:57] to see the wonderful things that god has
[37:59] done here over the years and how he's
[38:01] used him
[38:02] and i believe god calls a man uh to an
[38:06] an area for the need for that area and i
[38:08] believe we certainly see that reflected
[38:10] in brother david's life
[38:11] and and the impact that he's had here
[38:13] and
[38:14] and um and am i it's just it's good to
[38:16] be amongst believers
[38:18] something about it you know uh you get
[38:20] around believers and
[38:22] it's it's different than just other
[38:24] people you come in contact with not
[38:26] because
[38:27] um that you know they're they're people
[38:29] just like we are they have feelings and
[38:32] and emotions and and cheerfulness and
[38:35] sadness and all the
[38:36] emotions that we go through but
[38:38] something about when you get around a
[38:39] believer
[38:40] maybe you've only known them for a few
[38:42] minutes or a few days or whatever it be
[38:44] but there's something that goes back
[38:45] a further history back into eternity
[38:48] with them
[38:48] and we have something in common that we
[38:50] rally around and that's not a
[38:52] personality or just a doctrine or a
[38:54] theology or
[38:56] an idea but it's the word of god and so
[38:59] something interesting about the word of
[39:01] god is it's eternal
[39:03] as i think i mentioned briefly this
[39:05] morning and and a man can begin to
[39:07] read something that moses wrote maybe 4
[39:10] 000 years ago or that paul wrote 2000
[39:13] years ago
[39:14] and yet you can even if you're just
[39:17] reading it at home
[39:18] yourself certain times when you're
[39:20] reading a scripture maybe you've read
[39:22] that scripture three dozen times
[39:23] before and it was a good scripture and
[39:26] you could say
[39:27] man and and enjoyed it but you're going
[39:29] through something
[39:30] and all of a sudden you open up your
[39:32] bible and begin to read it or you turn
[39:33] on a tape and begin to listen to it
[39:35] maybe you listen to that tape half a
[39:37] dozen times before but whatever you're
[39:39] going through right at that moment
[39:40] something stands out to you in that
[39:42] scripture or from that tape that
[39:44] has such a meaning to you more than it
[39:46] did before
[39:47] that applied to write what you were
[39:49] going through and that's because god's
[39:51] word is eternal
[39:52] david could write psalms way back and
[39:54] you know
[39:55] on the back side of the desert there
[39:57] with a salt tree which was an
[39:59] old testament guitar is really what it
[40:00] was and and he could write a psalm back
[40:03] there
[40:04] and you know we we think songs you know
[40:06] 100 years ago 150 years ago 200 years
[40:09] ago
[40:09] maybe seems a little outdated to some
[40:11] people but he wrote that
[40:13] thousands of years ago and we pick it up
[40:16] and they sang this morning psalm 34 and
[40:18] you can feel the presence of god come in
[40:21] and just make it just i believe as real
[40:23] and as purple
[40:25] as when david sat there and this it's
[40:28] not them it's me i don't know it's
[40:29] something in my
[40:30] in my chemistry of my body doesn't like
[40:32] these texts and microphones but
[40:34] [Laughter]
[40:36] but they um uh you know just as real as
[40:39] it was when david wrote it so
[40:41] that's that's something more than a man
[40:43] can do it's something that takes a god
[40:45] quality to make something eternal like
[40:47] that but i don't want to keep you
[40:49] standing too long you somebody said oh
[40:50] you already have brother nathan but
[40:52] genesis chapter 3 and verse 9 and
[40:55] the lord god called unto adam and said
[40:58] unto him where art thou
[41:01] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[41:04] garden
[41:05] and i was afraid because i was naked
[41:08] and i hid myself you notice adam
[41:12] says these words as far as i know the
[41:15] first time
[41:16] ever spoken by a human being i was
[41:19] afraid
[41:21] there had never been any fear before the
[41:23] fall
[41:25] no fear no shame no anxiety no
[41:28] depression no sickness
[41:30] there had never been any of these things
[41:31] before the fall but now adam
[41:33] begins to i wonder how he even knew in
[41:35] his vocabulary the word to describe what
[41:37] he was feeling
[41:38] because he had never felt it before i
[41:40] was afraid
[41:42] and i will look at this thought tonight
[41:43] with the help of the lord overcoming
[41:45] fear overcoming fear let's bow our heads
[41:48] together dear jesus
[41:49] lord we approach your throne again
[41:51] tonight lord we know it's
[41:53] cold and windy on the outside and snow
[41:56] covering the roads but lord we thank you
[41:57] that
[41:58] not only because of the heaters and the
[42:00] electricity and the thermostats that
[42:03] it's warm on the inside but we believe
[42:05] that the holy ghost and fire will come
[42:07] and
[42:07] and just ignite this service into
[42:09] something that would be pleasing to you
[42:12] and lord we welcome your holy spirit to
[42:14] move in any way that you would want it
[42:16] to
[42:16] lord we we recognize that by faith we
[42:20] we believe and take you it's your word
[42:22] that you're with us
[42:23] whether we feel you or whether we don't
[42:26] feel you we know that you're with us
[42:27] because your word promised that you
[42:29] would be
[42:30] but lord we want to make sure tonight
[42:32] that we make you welcome to move in our
[42:34] midst lord and to do
[42:35] whatever you would see fit for this
[42:37] moment in time and
[42:38] lord i thank you for these that have
[42:41] been able to
[42:42] sojourn the roads and and be able to
[42:44] come here
[42:45] tonight in this weather lord i know it's
[42:47] an extra effort that they put forth on a
[42:49] night like tonight and
[42:51] for those that due to distance and and
[42:54] road conditions couldn't be here that
[42:56] are listening in lord i pray that you'd
[42:57] give them a special blessing as well
[42:59] those that are listening back in indiana
[43:01] and kentucky lord i pray that
[43:03] you'd be with them tonight lord and
[43:06] father we
[43:06] we thank you that even though sometimes
[43:09] it's not possible to physically be in
[43:11] the church that
[43:12] you've provided an opportunity for
[43:14] others to still be able to participate
[43:17] somewhat in the service
[43:18] even when they can't physically be here
[43:20] but lord we we recognize it's not
[43:22] it's not the same and we thank you for
[43:24] those opportunities when we can be
[43:26] here lord we we thank you in times like
[43:29] this and in times of sickness that
[43:30] there's an opportunity
[43:32] to be able to listen in remotely but
[43:34] lord may we never use that in a as a
[43:36] crutch lord when it's not necessary and
[43:38] father i pray that you'd be with each
[43:40] one speak to hearts tonight
[43:42] and father just help me to get myself
[43:44] out of the way so that you can speak
[43:46] something
[43:47] lord i'm not interested in projecting
[43:49] the opinion of nathan bryant or the
[43:51] personality of nathan bryant tonight but
[43:53] lord
[43:54] may you just get me so far out of the
[43:56] way that the people would see
[43:58] jesus christ lord and not see just a man
[44:01] up here lord they didn't come to
[44:03] they wouldn't drive this this in these
[44:05] conditions lord and in this weather
[44:08] just to come out and hear a man or a
[44:09] personality but we come to hear the word
[44:11] tonight father
[44:13] lord i'm not depending on my ability or
[44:15] my intelligence or my memory
[44:18] lord tonight but i'm depending on you
[44:20] because lord if they're gonna receive
[44:22] something that would be worth the
[44:23] efforts that they put into it it'll take
[44:25] you to do it father
[44:26] we commit the service to you in the name
[44:29] of the lord jesus christ
[44:30] and the church said amen god bless you
[44:34] can be seated tonight
[44:49] david said i was glad when they said
[44:52] unto me let us go into the house of the
[44:54] lord
[44:55] oh my i'm thankful you know for places
[44:58] that we can come
[45:00] some countries don't have the privilege
[45:03] that we do
[45:04] to to meet openly like this to where
[45:07] they have to hide out in somebody's
[45:08] basement from communism
[45:10] or they have to maybe not have a
[45:13] physical building
[45:14] maybe it's not politically that they're
[45:16] being oppressed but just
[45:18] uh due to finances or due to
[45:20] circumstances meet out under a tree or
[45:22] something like that
[45:23] and and so we're blessed to have even in
[45:26] these conditions to have a place with a
[45:27] roof over our head
[45:28] and heat blowing through the vents and
[45:31] and um
[45:32] and so we we are we are truly blessed i
[45:34] thank god for opportunities to come
[45:36] together
[45:37] and assemble ourselves to worship the
[45:39] scripture told us that we should do that
[45:41] even the more so as we see the day
[45:43] approaching and
[45:44] uh it's sad that you see some people
[45:46] that the the closer we get
[45:48] the less that they're interested in
[45:50] church and the less that they're
[45:51] interested in the word and
[45:53] we don't have any excuse in this age you
[45:55] know used to if you didn't have your
[45:57] bible with you
[45:58] and uh back in the 1800s and things if
[46:01] you had
[46:01] went somewhere and you walked off and
[46:03] left your bible in your saddlebag or you
[46:05] didn't have
[46:06] all of your concordances and things with
[46:08] you you didn't have the opportunities
[46:09] that we have now but
[46:10] now we're walking right around our cell
[46:12] phone in our pocket we've got
[46:14] every scripture we've got every message
[46:16] at the audio the text of it and
[46:19] yet it seems like it becomes more and
[46:20] more common and less and less of a
[46:22] desire of people to listen to it but
[46:24] i thank god for a desire for the word
[46:26] and for
[46:27] a love for his word i told my church a
[46:30] while back i
[46:31] it hasn't always been easy for me to
[46:33] live the word but it's always been easy
[46:35] something about it
[46:36] brother matthew since a little boy it's
[46:38] always been easy for me to believe the
[46:40] word and so
[46:41] i recognize that is something that you
[46:43] can't manufacture on your own that it
[46:45] takes god to do that
[46:47] but to have a love for the truth in this
[46:49] age
[46:50] when there are so many people that make
[46:52] fun of the truth or walk away from the
[46:54] truth or have no desire
[46:56] at all for truth to have a love for the
[46:58] truth you truly are a blessed people
[47:00] tonight
[47:01] as i said before adam when he comes out
[47:04] of the garden here and
[47:05] and he he feels this emotion of fear and
[47:09] so we recognize that
[47:10] that fear is actually equality that came
[47:14] from
[47:14] satan god did not place this fear on
[47:17] adam now we can look and we begin to
[47:19] recognize that well
[47:20] solomon said that the beginning of
[47:22] wisdom is to fear the lord
[47:24] but that's not the type of fear that
[47:26] adam was feeling when
[47:27] when we look at that word and brother
[47:29] bam talks about it in the sermon of
[47:30] respects
[47:31] he said i fear the lord he said i fear
[47:33] my wife i fear my neighbor
[47:35] it wasn't that he was i know there's
[47:36] some men that are probably afraid of
[47:37] their wife and the way that adam was
[47:39] talking but
[47:39] but brother bannon wasn't talking about
[47:41] being afraid that sister branham was
[47:43] going to beat him over the head with the
[47:44] broom
[47:44] but he said that's a respectful fear
[47:47] that he was
[47:48] he was afraid that he would do something
[47:50] to lead them astray or be a stumbling
[47:52] block so it was
[47:53] a respect and uh being able to respect
[47:56] god and fear him in that way but god
[47:58] does not want his children remember he's
[48:00] the type of the bridegroom
[48:01] and we're the type of the bride and god
[48:04] is it doesn't want you know you
[48:06] sisters if you really love your husband
[48:07] you're not sitting there in fear of him
[48:09] oh
[48:09] uh what if i burn the eggs will he
[48:12] divorce me and
[48:13] what if i do this will he will he smack
[48:15] me with his backhand or
[48:17] what if i do this what no it's it's not
[48:19] that but it's that you love him so much
[48:21] and respect him so much that you don't
[48:23] want to do anything wrong
[48:24] and so that's the relationship that we
[48:26] have with god and the type of fear
[48:28] that we have for god as brother brahm
[48:30] said he loved him so much he wouldn't
[48:32] want to do anything to let him down and
[48:34] so
[48:34] that's a different type of fear than
[48:36] what adam was feeling here
[48:38] when god's voice spoke in the garden and
[48:40] said adam where art thou
[48:42] he had heard god's voice many times and
[48:45] he had a respect for god's voice but now
[48:48] he is actually afraid as he hears the
[48:50] voice coming through the garden
[48:52] because of shame and because of
[48:55] sin and because of anxiety he goes
[48:58] and before where he would have welcomed
[49:01] the presence of god
[49:02] now he hides from it you realize this is
[49:05] why some people don't like to go to
[49:06] church
[49:07] and this is why some people don't
[49:08] believe in preachers it's because the
[49:10] voice of god
[49:11] actually convicts them and so they try
[49:14] to quiet the voice of god in their life
[49:16] and to try to get away from it and this
[49:18] is what adam thought he
[49:19] thought if i can just hide from that
[49:21] voice if i can just hide from that
[49:23] presence
[49:24] until i can get good enough until i can
[49:27] sow some fig leaves together
[49:28] but god showed him real quick that there
[49:30] was nothing man-made that he could do
[49:33] but that god had provided a sacrifice
[49:36] for him
[49:38] adam he feels afraid for the very first
[49:40] time now
[49:41] the way to have fellowship 1955 brother
[49:43] bannon makes this statement he said
[49:44] there's only two faculties
[49:46] that govern a human and one of them is
[49:49] faith which brings results and the other
[49:51] is fear which has
[49:53] no value in it at all i want you to
[49:56] think about that tonight now i'm not
[49:58] going to bring anything new that you
[49:59] haven't ever heard before probably i
[50:01] have no new revelation of my own
[50:03] i'm probably not going to bring anything
[50:05] a quote or a scripture that
[50:06] that brother david hasn't read here
[50:08] before i i don't have anything new
[50:11] but i am going to try to point you back
[50:13] to the word and just remind you of some
[50:15] of these things so
[50:16] don't be shocked if you don't hear
[50:17] anything you know fantastic tonight in
[50:19] the way of
[50:20] it being new and extracurricular and out
[50:22] in left field somewhere but
[50:24] i do hope that we hear things and
[50:25] recognize that they're extraordinary
[50:27] because it's the word so brother bannon
[50:29] says fear
[50:30] has no value in it at all
[50:35] all the worry that we do all the things
[50:38] we live in fear if there is ever an
[50:40] age that lives in fear it's the age that
[50:42] we're living in now
[50:43] people afraid to go out of their house
[50:45] people afraid to
[50:47] go and interact with people why because
[50:49] of because of a sickness and the
[50:50] sickness is real people will get sick
[50:52] and
[50:53] people are dying of it but you know what
[50:54] people were sick and dying before we
[50:56] ever knew anything about coronavirus
[50:58] i find it very interesting they said we
[51:00] had less flu deaths in 2020 than we ever
[51:02] have well
[51:03] isn't that strange because they count
[51:06] everything as coronavirus
[51:08] deaths now you die in an automobile
[51:09] accident you test positive
[51:11] for coronavirus and they'll count it as
[51:12] a coronavirus death and it it amplifies
[51:15] the numbers and it amplifies the anxiety
[51:17] and it amplifies the fear and
[51:19] and everything that the that the news
[51:21] wants to project to us what is it
[51:22] it's a controlled way of of keeping us
[51:25] living in fear that
[51:27] we get to a spot to where we would
[51:28] rather lay down our freedoms
[51:30] uh for a little bit of protection that
[51:32] oh you'll just keep us safe then we'll
[51:34] lay down our freedom as well
[51:36] i'm not interested in living that way i
[51:37] told somebody a long time ago when all
[51:39] this started i said i can honestly say
[51:41] i would rather die of coronavirus than
[51:43] to live in constant fear from it now
[51:45] that doesn't mean
[51:46] that we i believe in washing my hands
[51:49] amen i believe in taking precautions i i
[51:52] you know i believe in
[51:53] in these things but there's a difference
[51:55] in being cautious and being fearful
[51:58] and letting fear actually grip you and
[52:00] consume you i've seen some people
[52:01] that have actually allowed this to
[52:03] consume them in such a way
[52:05] that they're living in fear and you know
[52:07] brother bannon makes a statement he said
[52:09] even if you had
[52:10] cancer and wasn't afraid of it he said
[52:12] you wouldn't be in too bad of a
[52:14] condition
[52:15] amen so i believe that we should live
[52:17] our life that way not to
[52:19] not to live in fear he said if i knew in
[52:21] the morning that i was going to go out
[52:23] and be shot by a firing squad
[52:25] he said it would do me no good to be
[52:27] afraid
[52:28] there's no value in fear absolutely no
[52:31] value in fear i know the devil doesn't
[52:32] like that and he'll try to get you to
[52:34] intellectualize it and reason your way
[52:36] through it all the
[52:38] 973 reasons to be afraid in 2021
[52:41] but there is no value in fear there's
[52:43] nothing positive in it at all it's just
[52:46] a negative
[52:47] and just uh something to bring you down
[52:49] and discourage your depression before
[52:51] you know you'll be
[52:52] hiding out in your basement afraid to
[52:53] come out and and i don't want to live my
[52:56] life that way i'm not interested in
[52:57] living my life that way where the spirit
[52:59] of the lord is the scripture says
[53:01] there's liberty and that word liberty
[53:03] means freedom so i want to be free in
[53:05] the holy spirit that whether wherever he
[53:07] leads me
[53:08] that i'll be able to follow that so fear
[53:10] has no value he said now brother bannon
[53:12] what if what about faith what about that
[53:14] he said faith could deliver me
[53:16] maybe the governor say we're going to
[53:18] kill this man in the morning
[53:19] and have it all set up and have the
[53:21] documentation have the men
[53:23] cleaning their guns and putting the
[53:25] cells in their
[53:26] guns to be able to go out there the next
[53:29] day and fire them but
[53:30] faith could deliver him faith could
[53:32] bring somebody of a higher authority on
[53:34] the scene
[53:35] to say i don't care what the governor
[53:36] says we're going to override this
[53:38] legally
[53:38] or to replace the governor with somebody
[53:40] else you know i've told people for years
[53:42] people get so
[53:43] anxious about their jobs oh brother
[53:45] nathan i don't know pray for me this is
[53:47] happening at my job in this situation
[53:50] and my boss doesn't like me hey i don't
[53:52] care if the ceo of the company doesn't
[53:54] like you
[53:54] if god gave you the job and wants you to
[53:57] keep the job
[53:57] god can change the ceo of the company
[54:01] there was a man by the name of joseph
[54:03] one time and we're a little bit off the
[54:04] notes but hey
[54:05] you know the holy ghost is better than
[54:07] the notes anyhow isn't he brother david
[54:09] there was a man by the name of joseph
[54:11] one time and looked like everything that
[54:13] could go wrong for this man was going
[54:15] wrong
[54:16] he was sold into slavery by his own
[54:18] brothers
[54:20] and he goes and they cast him into a pit
[54:23] and then they bring him out and sell him
[54:24] into slavery
[54:25] and he goes down into egypt and looked
[54:27] like it was terrible
[54:28] but he recognized something you go back
[54:30] and read those chapters in genesis where
[54:32] it deals with joseph there
[54:33] and joseph begins to recognize that even
[54:36] while he's in bondage that god was with
[54:39] him and then
[54:40] you know he begins in the house of
[54:42] pharaoh to be promoted a little bit
[54:44] to a higher and a higher and a higher
[54:46] position and looked like things was
[54:47] getting pretty good for him for a while
[54:49] and then potiphar's wife sets a trap for
[54:51] the man
[54:52] and he gets now he gets thrown into
[54:54] prison and looks like he's worse off
[54:56] than he ever was
[54:57] but he recognized that god was with him
[55:00] and it didn't matter
[55:01] we get so focused on the circumstance
[55:04] and the geographic location
[55:06] and the title behind our job and all
[55:08] these things
[55:09] but what really mattered to joseph he
[55:11] may not have recognized this right away
[55:13] brother david
[55:14] it may have taken years to recognize it
[55:16] but he began to recognize a pattern that
[55:19] if he was at home with his family
[55:20] god was with him if he was in the pit
[55:23] god was with him
[55:24] if he was in slavery god was with him if
[55:27] he was the top man in potiphar's house
[55:29] god was with him if he was in the prison
[55:32] god was with him
[55:33] if he was the right hand of pharaoh god
[55:35] was with him and he recognized you know
[55:37] even though his life if you had looked
[55:39] at a at a pie chart or a graph of
[55:42] of joseph's life there would have been a
[55:43] lot of ups and downs and ups and downs
[55:46] and maybe you would lay your life over
[55:48] top of that and it would follow a
[55:49] similar pound
[55:50] pattern of mountaintops and valleys and
[55:52] flat
[55:53] places and halfway up the mountain and
[55:55] halfway down the mountain
[55:56] but the main thing he recognized there
[55:58] was a consistency
[56:00] that it didn't matter if he was on the
[56:01] mountaintop or the valley
[56:03] god was with him that takes the fear out
[56:07] of it to know that god is with you
[56:09] it takes the fear away when you can
[56:11] recognize no matter my circumstance
[56:13] stop looking at the circumstance no
[56:16] matter what the pressure stop
[56:18] looking at the pressure no matter what
[56:20] the sickness stop looking at the symptom
[56:23] and look to the one that's walking with
[56:25] you through the valley
[56:26] amen he's been with me on my
[56:28] mountaintops he's been with me in my
[56:30] valleys he's been with me through
[56:31] sickness and in health
[56:33] he's been with me through riches and
[56:35] poverty he promised never to leave me
[56:37] nor forsake me
[56:39] as long as he's with me it really
[56:41] doesn't matter my geographic location
[56:44] or the amount of money in my bank you
[56:46] know sometimes that makes it easier
[56:48] sometimes that brings more trials with
[56:50] it it depends on what you're using it
[56:52] for
[56:52] but you know what all of that is just
[56:54] temporary things that come and go
[56:56] and rust and corrupt i've got a i've got
[56:59] a a a
[56:59] jeep that i restored a few years ago and
[57:02] just uh
[57:03] i traded my brother for it with for
[57:04] another old vehicle and
[57:06] and we you know i began a little at a
[57:08] time to fix it up and fix it up and i
[57:09] got to a spot where i was pretty
[57:11] particular about it brother jay
[57:12] and my wife would tell me it's going to
[57:14] burn
[57:16] it's going to burn my jeep is not taking
[57:19] a rapture
[57:22] amen that's we get our focus on those
[57:24] things sometimes
[57:26] but those things are just temporary
[57:28] things that are here today
[57:29] and gone tomorrow but there's one thing
[57:31] that's been consistent in my life
[57:33] he's been with me amen that takes the
[57:36] fear right out of it now fear
[57:38] is a strange thing fear is something
[57:40] that you know
[57:41] if you're not careful fear becomes
[57:43] something that begins to consume you and
[57:45] take over and
[57:46] and there's we call it you know the or
[57:49] the psychologists call it phobias people
[57:51] have different kinds of phobias and
[57:53] there's all kinds of phobias there's a
[57:56] there's the fear of spiders i think they
[57:57] call that arachnophobia and there's a
[57:59] fear of
[58:00] enclosed places and there's the fear of
[58:02] heights and there's all kinds of
[58:03] different fears but i want to look at a
[58:04] few of them tonight
[58:05] it says most phobias involving a
[58:07] specific object this is from wikipedia
[58:10] most phobias involving a specific object
[58:12] or situation are thought to be triggered
[58:15] by a traumatic experience during
[58:17] childhood
[58:18] even if the actual incident is not
[58:20] remembered the emotional
[58:23] scarring remains oh my you
[58:26] got a lot of people with phobias in the
[58:27] message because of emotional scarring
[58:29] some of it was emotional scarring
[58:31] from when they was out in the world some
[58:33] of it was they came into a message
[58:35] church somewhere and got scarred and
[58:37] they've got all kinds of troubles and
[58:38] things and maybe they don't even
[58:39] remember what
[58:40] how it actually started but now they've
[58:42] got photophobias now there's this one
[58:44] phobia called a tichophobia
[58:46] which is the fear of failure and there's
[58:48] a lot of people
[58:49] that they absolutely won't do anything
[58:51] for god because they're afraid they're

[58:55] that he said god
[58:56] i can't do this i i'm slow of speech and
[58:58] i stutter and i do all these things and
[59:00] he began to look at himself and he was
[59:02] afraid of failure
[59:03] but god said look i'm the one that
[59:05] created your mouth i'm bigger
[59:07] than your failures i'm bigger than your
[59:09] personality i'm bigger than your
[59:10] attempts at it you just give it to me
[59:12] then there's a phobia called
[59:14] ecclesiophobia
[59:15] which is the fear of churches well
[59:17] that's going around a lot these days
[59:19] isn't it
[59:23] ecclesiaphobia the fear of churches some
[59:26] people are scared of church
[59:27] my all oh my they they're scared you
[59:30] know what's interesting i bump into some
[59:31] of them at lowe's and the lines are so
[59:34] crowded and people out there at lowe's
[59:36] in the grocery and but you know they
[59:37] don't seem to think that coronavirus
[59:39] goes to lowe's in the grocery but oh
[59:40] we couldn't go to church we might get
[59:42] sick well it's a it's a fear of churches
[59:45] i guess but
[59:46] there's a there's a phobia called
[59:48] nomophobia which means the fear of being
[59:50] out of mobile phone contact
[59:54] i didn't now i'm going to read you one
[59:56] in a minute that i made up but i didn't
[59:58] make that
[59:58] up that's an actual phobia nomophobia
[1:00:01] the fear
[1:00:02] of being out of cell phone contact now
[1:00:04] some people are actually addicted to
[1:00:06] their smartphones and they won't admit
[1:00:07] it just like a guy out there
[1:00:08] with his hands shaking with a cigarette
[1:00:11] he won't admit that he's addicted or
[1:00:13] somebody out there with a bottle oh i'm
[1:00:15] not an addict i'm not an alcoholic i can
[1:00:17] quit any time
[1:00:18] and some of them they got their
[1:00:19] smartphones out and they got they get
[1:00:20] the shakes if they don't have it every
[1:00:22] once in a while and
[1:00:23] some people come into church and after
[1:00:25] about 15 minutes of the song service
[1:00:26] they got to see
[1:00:27] what's the latest score in their
[1:00:28] football game or their baseball game or
[1:00:30] their basketball game and
[1:00:32] what was the latest thing on twitter and
[1:00:34] facebook and instagram and
[1:00:36] they might have missed something if they
[1:00:37] didn't hold onto their cell phone and
[1:00:39] check it every once in a while
[1:00:40] if the preacher goes through too long
[1:00:42] they got to get it back out and check
[1:00:43] again on something that's going on
[1:00:45] oh my don't you realize that's an
[1:00:47] addiction that if you can't get through
[1:00:48] two hours of a church service or maybe
[1:00:50] three hours like we had this morning but
[1:00:52] if you can't get through two hours
[1:00:54] without picking up your cell phone and
[1:00:55] checking out what's going on social
[1:00:57] media
[1:00:57] you might have an addiction
[1:01:00] a phobia of not being able to be without
[1:01:03] mobile phone contact for a little bit oh
[1:01:05] my
[1:01:06] there's necrophobia which is the fear of
[1:01:08] death
[1:01:09] or the dead some people are so scared of
[1:01:12] dying but you know
[1:01:13] we you know we look around it and and we
[1:01:16] see
[1:01:16] we see people dying not only physically
[1:01:19] but spiritually around us
[1:01:20] and and there's a fear of death but you
[1:01:22] know jesus says
[1:01:24] in saint john chapter 15 verse 24 verily
[1:01:26] verily i say unto you he that heareth my
[1:01:28] word
[1:01:29] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:01:31] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:01:34] condemnation
[1:01:35] but is past from death unto life
[1:01:39] brother madam said they're going to say
[1:01:41] to you one day that william branham died
[1:01:43] he said william branham died a long time
[1:01:44] ago
[1:01:45] amen all night they took me down to the
[1:01:48] branham tabernacle when i was about five
[1:01:50] years old and they buried me right there
[1:01:51] in the cold waters they buried me a long
[1:01:53] time ago brother david
[1:01:55] i've been dead for a long time but yet
[1:01:57] there's something about it people get so
[1:01:59] scared of death but brother madam said
[1:02:01] all that death can do he said
[1:02:02] death is just like a wagon that can only
[1:02:06] thing it can do is just pull you into
[1:02:07] the presence of your creator
[1:02:11] oh my and he tells us that satan cannot
[1:02:13] take us until it's hard time to go
[1:02:16] he can huff and he can puff but he
[1:02:18] cannot blow your house down until god
[1:02:20] allows him to i think it's so
[1:02:21] interesting
[1:02:22] that before satan can do anything to me
[1:02:24] he's got to go up and knock on my
[1:02:26] father's door
[1:02:27] not my earthly father back in
[1:02:29] jeffersonville indiana
[1:02:30] but he's got to go up and knock on my
[1:02:32] heavenly father's door and ask him
[1:02:34] permission before he can give me a
[1:02:36] toothache
[1:02:39] and if god allows him and gives him
[1:02:41] permission even though that toothache
[1:02:43] might hurt or even though whatever it is
[1:02:45] that you're going through might seem
[1:02:46] like a terrible thing at the time
[1:02:47] if god allowed it then he has a reason
[1:02:50] and a purpose in it maybe it's to build
[1:02:52] your faith
[1:02:53] for deliverance from and from healing or
[1:02:55] whatever it would be or
[1:02:56] maybe it's to get your attention about
[1:02:58] something or maybe it's to
[1:02:59] get you in a doctor's office at the
[1:03:01] right place at the right time so you can
[1:03:03] witness to the nurse or the surgeon or
[1:03:05] whoever it would be but god
[1:03:06] has a reason in it and so if we can
[1:03:09] trust him there's no reason for me to be
[1:03:11] afraid
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:13] many of you have heard of a general in
[1:03:15] the civil war by the name of stonewall
[1:03:17] jackson and
[1:03:18] they looked at him standing out there
[1:03:19] and he would stand out right in the
[1:03:21] midst of the battle
[1:03:22] and he didn't cower down like a lot of
[1:03:24] the generals and hide out way back
[1:03:26] behind the lines but
[1:03:27] he would stand right out there or sit
[1:03:29] out on his horse right out in the middle
[1:03:30] of battle
[1:03:31] and they would say look at look at
[1:03:33] jackson how he stands like a stone wall
[1:03:36] and the reason he could do that he said
[1:03:37] i've determined that god has
[1:03:39] predetermined my death with the time and
[1:03:42] the place of it
[1:03:42] and he said so when i'm on the
[1:03:44] battlefield he said i feel just as safe
[1:03:46] as when i'm in my own living room
[1:03:48] my what a way to live
[1:03:52] already passed from death unto life
[1:03:55] and whosoever liveth saint john chapter
[1:03:57] 11 26
[1:03:59] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:04:00] shall never die
[1:04:03] oh my there's a fear of being alone
[1:04:06] called monophobia some people are so
[1:04:08] afraid
[1:04:09] oh my you know i couldn't serve the lord
[1:04:12] if i served jesus my husband might leave
[1:04:14] me and
[1:04:15] if i did this you know this one might
[1:04:17] leave me and this friend may go away
[1:04:19] from me and
[1:04:20] and if i say if i take a stand for god
[1:04:22] somebody might unfriend me on facebook
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:24] and they're so afraid of being alone but
[1:04:26] you know i will never be alone because
[1:04:28] jesus promised i'll never leave thee
[1:04:31] nor forsake thee so i'll never be alone
[1:04:33] so i don't have to be afraid of being
[1:04:35] alone
[1:04:35] again deuteronomy chapter 31 verse 6 be
[1:04:38] strong and of a good courage
[1:04:39] fear not nor be afraid for the lord thy
[1:04:41] god he it is that doth go with thee
[1:04:44] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:04:47] that's that's a promise to the believer
[1:04:49] this evening there's a fear of
[1:04:51] nightmares which is
[1:04:53] hypnophobia that's afraid of falling
[1:04:55] asleep because you're going to have a
[1:04:56] bad dream and
[1:04:57] and maybe that's something you know
[1:04:58] we've had different children and things
[1:05:00] come through prayer lines that
[1:05:01] suffering really badly with nightmares
[1:05:03] and things i encourage their parents to
[1:05:04] read the scripture over them
[1:05:06] before they go to bed at night and to
[1:05:08] not get their thoughts on
[1:05:09] fearful things but to get their thoughts
[1:05:11] on things of god and on good things but
[1:05:13] proverbs chapter 3 verse 24
[1:05:15] says when thou liest down thou shalt not
[1:05:18] be afraid
[1:05:19] yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep
[1:05:22] shall be sweet
[1:05:23] be not afraid of sudden fear neither of
[1:05:25] the desolation of the wicked when it
[1:05:27] cometh oh my
[1:05:28] isn't that something be not afraid of
[1:05:31] sudden fear
[1:05:31] you know fdr made a statement at his
[1:05:33] inauguration in 1933
[1:05:35] he said the only thing that we have to
[1:05:37] fear is fear itself well
[1:05:39] i may not have agreed with fdr on his
[1:05:41] politics but i do agree with him on that
[1:05:43] the only thing that you should be afraid
[1:05:45] of is being afraid
[1:05:47] amen the only thing we have to fear is
[1:05:49] fear itself am i
[1:05:50] what do i have to fear god predestinated
[1:05:53] me as we looked at this morning
[1:05:54] i'm going to skip ahead here and read
[1:05:55] you a quote brother bannon makes a
[1:05:57] statement here
[1:05:57] he says in identify identification of
[1:06:00] christ in all ages 1964 he said
[1:06:02] he knowed before the world began we
[1:06:04] would sit here he knowed how many times
[1:06:06] i raised my hands up and down
[1:06:08] he now he knowed the words i would say
[1:06:11] he knowed how many times you would batch
[1:06:13] your eyes what you would think
[1:06:15] before the world ever started what are
[1:06:17] we afraid about
[1:06:19] god is our father he says that's right
[1:06:21] what are we afraid about this evening oh
[1:06:24] to know that god god already knew what
[1:06:26] would take place and he was already
[1:06:28] working things in motion
[1:06:29] to be able to bring you through god
[1:06:31] knows all about it he knows what your
[1:06:33] tomorrow holds
[1:06:34] and and he's not only that but he's
[1:06:36] holding your tomorrow so
[1:06:38] why should i be afraid when my father
[1:06:40] knows all about it
[1:06:41] he knows what my plan is before i do
[1:06:44] he knows what my end is before i do and
[1:06:47] he's allowing certain things to happen
[1:06:49] to get me into a condition
[1:06:50] he still has it all in control tonight
[1:06:54] my fear not little flock saint luke
[1:06:56] chapter 12 verse 32 it says for it's
[1:06:59] your father's
[1:07:00] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:07:01] fear not
[1:07:03] jesus told jarius when they came to get
[1:07:06] him
[1:07:06] and here his little daughter was dying
[1:07:09] and
[1:07:10] the a man comes and runs and tells him
[1:07:11] so don't bother the master anymore
[1:07:13] said your little girl is already dead
[1:07:15] and jesus turns and says one of the
[1:07:17] strangest things that you would think to
[1:07:19] say you know
[1:07:20] when somebody's going through a trial we
[1:07:21] want to think of something encouraging
[1:07:23] and
[1:07:23] and a lot of times that's that's all
[1:07:25] right but really when somebody is going
[1:07:26] through something
[1:07:27] that's really devastating there's
[1:07:29] there's no words that you can say
[1:07:31] sometimes just being there
[1:07:32] is better than any words that you can
[1:07:34] say but unless it's the words of god
[1:07:36] what can you say when somebody's lost a
[1:07:38] loved one that's going to change a lot
[1:07:39] of that is
[1:07:40] is just psychology or things like that
[1:07:42] but jesus turns and he doesn't you know
[1:07:44] he doesn't give him a 10-step
[1:07:46] book on how to overcome grief when
[1:07:48] you've lost a loved one and
[1:07:50] he doesn't give him a bunch of
[1:07:51] psychology but he turns to him and says
[1:07:53] be not afraid only believe
[1:07:58] looked like if there was ever a time
[1:07:59] that jarius had a right to be afraid
[1:08:02] was right then his little daughter
[1:08:04] laying there dead and he's tried every
[1:08:05] effort that he could he's
[1:08:06] he's he's putting money into medicine
[1:08:08] and doctors and he's tried to do all
[1:08:10] that he can and finally
[1:08:12] he's got desperate enough that he
[1:08:13] doesn't care what the pharisees and the
[1:08:15] sadducees say about him he's going to
[1:08:17] get to jesus and he gets there
[1:08:19] and it seemed like he got there too late
[1:08:21] but oh let me tell you
[1:08:22] you never get to jesus too late amen
[1:08:25] somebody said oh brother nathan you
[1:08:26] don't understand i backslid and i ran
[1:08:28] for all these years and i've gone too
[1:08:30] far
[1:08:30] it's too late for me if you still have
[1:08:32] any desire for god in your heart
[1:08:34] then it's not too late to you jarius it
[1:08:37] looked like it was too late for him to
[1:08:39] get to jesus now
[1:08:40] and jesus turns and says be not afraid
[1:08:43] only
[1:08:44] believe elijah one time he goes and
[1:08:48] he had been sent of god to tell ahab
[1:08:51] that it wasn't going to rain for three
[1:08:52] years until he called for it
[1:08:54] and now he goes back out in the
[1:08:56] wilderness and god provides him a brook
[1:08:57] where he's got water and he provides him
[1:08:59] ravens to bring him food
[1:09:00] but one day the little brook dries up
[1:09:02] there and god sends him down to a widow
[1:09:04] woman's house
[1:09:05] and he tells her go and make me a meal
[1:09:06] and bring me some water
[1:09:08] and she says sir you don't understand
[1:09:10] i'm making this final meal for me and my
[1:09:11] son
[1:09:12] and then we're going to go in here and
[1:09:13] just commit ourselves to death
[1:09:15] and he said he said go and bring me a
[1:09:17] cake first
[1:09:18] because thus saith the lord the barrel
[1:09:20] won't drown dry
[1:09:21] neither will the crews go empty and and
[1:09:24] she goes in and maybe she had a right to
[1:09:26] question and
[1:09:27] oh my what about this one about that he
[1:09:29] said fear not
[1:09:32] well if there was ever a time to fear
[1:09:33] you would think that would be the time
[1:09:35] down to the last bit of
[1:09:36] meal in the barrel down to the last
[1:09:38] little bit of oil in the cruce but he
[1:09:40] tells her fear not
[1:09:42] how could she not be afraid in a time
[1:09:43] like that because she had thus saith the
[1:09:45] lord
[1:09:47] you recognize where we stand tonight
[1:09:49] there's all kinds of circumstances
[1:09:50] around us
[1:09:51] that to the outward man and to the
[1:09:53] intellectual mind it looks like we would
[1:09:55] have a right to be afraid but we're
[1:09:56] standing on thus saith the lord
[1:10:00] now this one i made up but there's a
[1:10:01] fear that i found around the message and
[1:10:03] it's called titheophobia
[1:10:04] [Laughter]
[1:10:08] the fear of paying tithes
[1:10:12] now i have a quote for that i don't have
[1:10:13] a psychological analysis to
[1:10:16] show you what that means but i do have a
[1:10:17] quote for it putting on the whole arm of
[1:10:18] god 1962
[1:10:20] he says it comes to paying your tithes
[1:10:21] into your church you're afraid to do it
[1:10:23] a fear
[1:10:25] afraid to do it because you're afraid
[1:10:27] you'll starve to death even though god's
[1:10:29] made the promise that he would take care
[1:10:30] of you
[1:10:31] malachi chapter 3 verse verses i think 8
[1:10:34] 9 and 10 through there
[1:10:35] god comes on the scene he tells malachi
[1:10:37] said tell them that they've robbed me
[1:10:39] and they'll say have you robbed me he
[1:10:41] said you've robbed me in tithes and
[1:10:42] offerings brother david didn't ask me to
[1:10:44] say this it was just
[1:10:45] you know part of the phobia sermon here
[1:10:46] that we're talking about tonight but
[1:10:48] but he said i just ask them and tell
[1:10:50] them to prove me
[1:10:51] and see if i won't open up the
[1:10:53] floodgates and the windows of heaven
[1:10:55] and pour out a blessing that they
[1:10:57] wouldn't be able to contain now
[1:10:59] i'm not here to preach your prosperity
[1:11:01] this evening i don't believe in
[1:11:02] preaching prosperity
[1:11:03] but i do believe in preaching provision
[1:11:05] amen god didn't promise that he would he
[1:11:08] would prosper me with a ferrari and a 10
[1:11:10] million
[1:11:10] bank account he didn't promise me that
[1:11:12] he he'd prosper me with a 50 000 square
[1:11:14] foot house
[1:11:15] but he did promise very specifically
[1:11:17] that he would provide for me
[1:11:19] and he told me in saint matthew chapter
[1:11:21] 6 33
[1:11:22] that if i would just seek first the
[1:11:24] kingdom of god that all these other
[1:11:27] things my clothing
[1:11:28] and the roof over my head and the food
[1:11:30] on my table for my children
[1:11:31] that he would provide those things if i
[1:11:33] would just seek him first
[1:11:35] young people looking for a spouse seek
[1:11:38] god first and that'll be added to you
[1:11:40] amen parents looking for a job seek god
[1:11:43] first and that'll be added to you
[1:11:45] somebody that's sick in body and looking
[1:11:47] for healing brother baby said you don't
[1:11:49] have to even be a christian to be healed
[1:11:51] but
[1:11:51] you have to be a christian to be to stay
[1:11:53] healed
[1:11:54] so there's a difference so we seek god
[1:11:56] first and we prove god
[1:11:57] i've seen him come on the scene time
[1:11:59] after time not only for myself but as a
[1:12:01] pastor i've seen you know
[1:12:03] it's so strange you think the people
[1:12:04] that had the biggest bank accounts that
[1:12:06] they would be the ones to quickly
[1:12:07] say oh my i've got so much money it's
[1:12:09] easy for me to pay tithes but usually
[1:12:10] those are the ones
[1:12:11] that feel like they make too much to pay
[1:12:13] ties and it's the poor little widow
[1:12:15] woman with a couple little orphan kids
[1:12:17] that usually she'll come down and pay
[1:12:19] her tithes faithfully and i've seen it
[1:12:21] time
[1:12:21] after time again where god has blessed
[1:12:23] it i saw a sister
[1:12:24] a few years ago i didn't know her need
[1:12:26] but she came and she paid her tithes and
[1:12:28] she had enough money in the bank account
[1:12:30] to either pay her electric bill
[1:12:32] or to pay tithes and they were going to
[1:12:34] shut off her electric
[1:12:35] and she paid her tithes first anyhow and
[1:12:37] she went home not knowing what the
[1:12:39] outcome would be
[1:12:40] and so that was on a sunday she walks
[1:12:41] out monday morning she opens the mailbox
[1:12:43] and there's a letter from her work well
[1:12:45] that's usually not a good sign
[1:12:46] so she opens that up and opens it up oh
[1:12:48] what are they going to say in this
[1:12:49] letter
[1:12:50] and they said you've done such a good
[1:12:51] job this last year we wanted to send you
[1:12:54] a thousand dollar bonus
[1:12:57] amen why because she proved god and she
[1:12:59] found out that his word you know
[1:13:01] even way down here in 2021 his word is
[1:13:03] still true
[1:13:05] oh my i've seen some people say oh my i
[1:13:08] wouldn't pay tithes i don't know what
[1:13:09] they're going to do with my money i
[1:13:10] don't know what they're how they're
[1:13:11] going to handle it hey
[1:13:12] if i was the biggest hypocrite in all
[1:13:14] the world and using
[1:13:15] my the money of god irresponsibly that
[1:13:18] that you know that god will hold me
[1:13:19] accountable for that or brother david or
[1:13:21] whoever whatever pastor or brother that
[1:13:23] it is he'll hold us accountable for that
[1:13:25] but he'll hold you accountable for
[1:13:26] did you just obey my word or not
[1:13:30] amen i've seen god move on the scene
[1:13:32] over
[1:13:33] and over again and bless people like
[1:13:35] that just by simple obedience to the
[1:13:37] word of god
[1:13:38] my i heard a man my dad tells of a
[1:13:40] pentecostal preacher one time
[1:13:42] that he had his he had his wallet and
[1:13:44] his coat and he was preaching he got hot
[1:13:46] and he took it off and he went to hand
[1:13:47] that wallet to a man sitting there and
[1:13:49] he said wait a minute he said do you pay
[1:13:50] your tithes
[1:13:51] he said because if you'd rob god you'd
[1:13:53] rob anybody
[1:14:00] tie the phobia philippians chapter 4
[1:14:04] verse 6 says be careful
[1:14:06] for nothing now we we read some of these
[1:14:08] words and
[1:14:09] sometimes the english word it it
[1:14:11] confused us
[1:14:12] a little bit now that doesn't mean we
[1:14:14] read that and be careful for nothing we
[1:14:16] think of the word careful it's cautious
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:18] and you know i'm i'm so thankful that
[1:14:20] when brother david read that scripture
[1:14:22] he didn't interpret it that
[1:14:23] he would just you know pull out in this
[1:14:25] blizzard in front of cars and say i
[1:14:27] don't have to be careful for nothing the
[1:14:28] scripture said so so
[1:14:30] i don't believe in stop signs and stop
[1:14:32] lights i'm just going to pull out not be
[1:14:33] careful
[1:14:34] but that word careful that in the
[1:14:36] english language what it's translated
[1:14:37] into
[1:14:38] the actual greek word there is the word
[1:14:40] miramno i believe i'm pronouncing that
[1:14:42] right but i may not be
[1:14:43] to be anxious or to be troubled with
[1:14:47] cares this is what jesus was talking
[1:14:49] about when he when he went and he talked
[1:14:51] to
[1:14:51] to mary there uh and he talked about how
[1:14:55] that
[1:14:56] or martha rather how that she was so
[1:14:58] troubled and worried about the things of
[1:14:59] life
[1:15:00] but but here was mary sitting at his
[1:15:02] feet or i may have got it backwards you
[1:15:03] correct me later if i did brother david
[1:15:05] but
[1:15:05] but he's saying paul's saying here be
[1:15:07] careful for nothing
[1:15:09] don't be anxious don't be troubled with
[1:15:12] anything don't allow
[1:15:13] the devil to keep you awake at night
[1:15:15] worrying about these things
[1:15:17] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:15:20] by prayer and supplication with
[1:15:22] thanksgiving
[1:15:22] let your requests be made known unto god
[1:15:27] the devil wants to keep you up at night
[1:15:29] worried about things that you can't
[1:15:30] control and things that you can't change
[1:15:32] and brother man talks to different
[1:15:34] people in prayer lines he says now he
[1:15:35] said i see you're real nervous and you
[1:15:37] try to cross bridges before you get to
[1:15:39] them
[1:15:39] and worried about things like that and
[1:15:41] it was actually a spirit
[1:15:43] that the enemy was trying to place on
[1:15:44] them of nervous oppression
[1:15:46] to try to get them so worried and upset
[1:15:48] about things and to live in fear
[1:15:50] god does not want you to live that way
[1:15:53] amen it's okay to have a plan it's okay
[1:15:56] to to plan ahead even though sometimes
[1:15:58] god's plan is a million miles
[1:16:00] a long way farther along than anything
[1:16:02] that we could plan it's okay to plan
[1:16:04] ahead
[1:16:05] but don't stay up all night and worried
[1:16:07] and upset and
[1:16:08] getting you know stomach ulcers over
[1:16:10] things that you can't change or do
[1:16:11] anything about
[1:16:12] but like brother david said this morning
[1:16:14] give it to god
[1:16:16] just give it to god and say god i've
[1:16:17] done my part and now i'm just going to
[1:16:19] wait and depend on you to do the part
[1:16:21] that i can't do
[1:16:23] brother brandon makes this statement an
[1:16:25] expectation in 1955
[1:16:27] he says now he's talking to a woman in a
[1:16:29] prayer line now you're suffering
[1:16:31] from a mental oppression which is
[1:16:33] nervousness you
[1:16:34] keep having strange and crazy thoughts
[1:16:37] running through your mind especially
[1:16:39] right late of the evening you get real
[1:16:41] weak many times you have to sit down
[1:16:43] when the sun's a setting you get a
[1:16:44] gloomy spell comes on you
[1:16:46] and the devil's trying to tell you
[1:16:48] you're going to lose your mind those
[1:16:49] things are true lady you were praying
[1:16:51] before you come you prayed said god if
[1:16:54] you'll give me a prayer card and put me
[1:16:55] before the platform i will believe
[1:16:57] you'll heal me that's right
[1:16:58] if that's right raise your hand that's
[1:17:00] right i see where you were kneeling
[1:17:02] there
[1:17:02] oh my i see where you were kneeling
[1:17:05] there
[1:17:06] now she was praying to god in her heart
[1:17:08] and and yet a prophet of god hears her
[1:17:10] in another dimension and sees where she
[1:17:12] was kneeling at i see
[1:17:14] where you were kneeling there he said uh
[1:17:16] let me find where i met you now god has
[1:17:18] a reward
[1:17:19] has rewarded you and your faith has
[1:17:21] healed you it's gone from you
[1:17:22] it was caused from menopause but you're
[1:17:25] going to be well
[1:17:26] so go on your road rejoicing and i bless
[1:17:29] you my sister
[1:17:30] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:17:33] people get such a mental oppression and
[1:17:36] a nervousness and
[1:17:37] anxiety and the devil coming and
[1:17:39] bombarding their mind
[1:17:40] trying to tell them you're going to go
[1:17:42] crazy you're going to lose your mind
[1:17:44] you're oh my you're just nuts and he
[1:17:46] bombards them
[1:17:47] and oppresses them and it's not
[1:17:49] something that that they've just made up
[1:17:51] it may seem something to you you think
[1:17:52] i'll just snap out of it but to them
[1:17:54] it's something that's very real that
[1:17:56] they're going through but it's not
[1:17:57] something that god
[1:17:58] intended for them to have to deal with
[1:18:00] the rest of their life brother banham
[1:18:02] tells us about how that that different
[1:18:04] ones would come to the prayer like
[1:18:06] nervous and upset and sometimes it was
[1:18:07] genetic or
[1:18:08] sometimes it was caused by trauma in
[1:18:11] their childhood or whatever it would be
[1:18:12] but yet god is god's intent is for you
[1:18:15] to live a happy life
[1:18:16] many times in the prayer line brother
[1:18:18] bran would say go and be happy and sing
[1:18:20] psalms and rejoice and
[1:18:22] we think sometimes being a christian
[1:18:24] means you got to walk around with the
[1:18:25] frown and so
[1:18:26] so pious and so zealous and and you know
[1:18:29] the pharisees had that all figured out
[1:18:31] and that's how they looked and
[1:18:32] and here comes jesus happy and rejoicing
[1:18:35] and
[1:18:35] the disciples around him and the
[1:18:37] pharisees wanted them to be sad and
[1:18:39] depressed
[1:18:40] and legalistic like they were and he
[1:18:42] said how can the how can those that are
[1:18:44] with the bridegroom be sad when he's
[1:18:46] right there with them well
[1:18:47] i want to remind you the bridegroom is
[1:18:49] right here with us walking with us
[1:18:51] he's biased he's in us he's working
[1:18:54] through us he said he never leave me nor
[1:18:55] forsake me
[1:18:56] why should i be sad when i've got the
[1:18:58] bridegroom walking right with me along
[1:19:00] life's path
[1:19:01] first john chapter 4 verse 18 there is
[1:19:03] no fear and love
[1:19:04] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:19:08] because fear hath torment he that
[1:19:11] feareth is not made perfect in love
[1:19:12] again ii timothy
[1:19:14] chapter 1 verse 7 for god hath not given
[1:19:17] us the spirit of fear
[1:19:18] but of power and of love and of
[1:19:21] a sound mind amen god gives us wisdom
[1:19:26] once again i believe i believe in safety
[1:19:29] as long as it doesn't drive you crazy as
[1:19:31] long as you don't go nuts with it i
[1:19:33] believe in
[1:19:34] and and you know looking both ways
[1:19:36] before we cross the road that's not what
[1:19:37] i'm talking about but
[1:19:39] i i don't believe in looking 80 times
[1:19:40] before before i cross the road because
[1:19:42] i'm so nervous and upset
[1:19:43] that i'm going to hit by hit by a car
[1:19:45] that i'm living under a spirit of fear
[1:19:47] there's a spirit of torment that satan
[1:19:49] tries to place
[1:19:50] on the people of god and let me tell you
[1:19:52] if he can't run to you to one extreme
[1:19:54] then he'll start working on you to the
[1:19:56] other extreme if he can't make you a
[1:19:58] fanatic
[1:19:58] then he'll try to make you cold and
[1:20:00] formal and if he can't make you be
[1:20:02] so nervous and upset that that you
[1:20:05] you're just so anxious and fearful that
[1:20:06] he'll try to push you the other way to
[1:20:08] where you just don't have a care about
[1:20:09] anything
[1:20:10] but there's a balance in the middle of
[1:20:11] the road on these things and
[1:20:13] god didn't want you to have a spirit of
[1:20:15] fear and to live under the bondage of
[1:20:16] fear
[1:20:17] but he came to bring freedom and joy and
[1:20:20] peace
[1:20:20] oh my you ever get around somebody that
[1:20:22] no matter what they're going through
[1:20:23] just seems like they're always on the
[1:20:25] mountaintop brother branham said there
[1:20:26] were those type of people that it said
[1:20:28] didn't matter
[1:20:28] you know and there was something about
[1:20:30] it that man he talks about and
[1:20:32] when he talks about how the temple was
[1:20:34] and how the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:20:36] was and
[1:20:36] how that the man living in the outer
[1:20:38] courts sometimes it was rain
[1:20:40] sometimes it was snow like it is in in
[1:20:42] texas tonight
[1:20:43] sometimes it was sunny skies sometimes
[1:20:45] it was cloudy skies
[1:20:46] but the man that had once entered into
[1:20:48] the holiest of holies
[1:20:50] there was something about it didn't
[1:20:51] matter if it was raining on the outside
[1:20:53] or snowing on the outside
[1:20:55] didn't matter what was going on the on
[1:20:56] the outside he had drawn the veil behind
[1:20:59] him
[1:21:00] and he was standing there in the holiest
[1:21:02] of holies surrounded
[1:21:03] by the shekinah glory that's why people
[1:21:06] can look at you and
[1:21:06] you walk through life's pathway and they
[1:21:08] look at you and think you're crazy
[1:21:10] because something goes wrong it's your
[1:21:12] work
[1:21:12] and you respond differently than they do
[1:21:14] and somebody gets sick in your family
[1:21:16] and
[1:21:17] you respond differently than the person
[1:21:18] at your job does why because you're
[1:21:20] walking in an atmosphere
[1:21:22] that they don't know anything about and
[1:21:23] you're living in a dimension that the
[1:21:25] world doesn't understand
[1:21:26] because he's with you
[1:21:30] oh my something about it living in this
[1:21:32] bright age some people have tried to
[1:21:33] actually make that
[1:21:34] a different timeline but we're still in
[1:21:36] the laodicean timeline
[1:21:37] but we're living in a dimension that the
[1:21:39] world doesn't know anything out
[1:21:41] about that god has called us into a
[1:21:43] revelation of what he's done in this age
[1:21:45] and we can walk up here above the cares
[1:21:46] of the world
[1:21:49] oh my i know my redeemer liveth 1958 and
[1:21:51] if we were put here for a purpose then
[1:21:53] there's nothing can destroy us until
[1:21:55] god's purpose is fulfilled
[1:21:57] nothing can harm us until that purpose
[1:21:59] that god has put us here for
[1:22:00] has been manifested no matter how much
[1:22:03] trouble we have
[1:22:04] much heart how much heartaches or
[1:22:06] sorrows that we go through
[1:22:08] all of these are reasons and there's a
[1:22:10] reason for it
[1:22:12] there's a reason for it there's a
[1:22:14] purpose in it god doesn't do things
[1:22:15] haphazardly
[1:22:16] but he has a reason for it oh my now
[1:22:20] jesus when he faced the enemy i i love
[1:22:24] the way the lord jesus came to the earth
[1:22:27] and lived his life because
[1:22:28] he didn't have to come that way brother
[1:22:30] branham tells us he could have came
[1:22:31] as an adult he could have came as a
[1:22:33] mighty king he could have come
[1:22:35] different ways but he comes and he
[1:22:37] didn't come and take on him the nature
[1:22:39] of angels
[1:22:40] but he comes and he takes on him the
[1:22:42] nature of the seed of abraham
[1:22:44] and he comes and he's born in a little
[1:22:46] manger
[1:22:47] in bethlehem and he comes to the lowest
[1:22:49] of the low
[1:22:50] and he comes to a spot where if you if
[1:22:52] you go back and research it the
[1:22:54] the wealthier families would bring a
[1:22:55] lamb and sacrifice but the families that
[1:22:58] didn't have enough finances
[1:22:59] to own a lamb they would bring turtle
[1:23:02] doves and sacrifice it and when they
[1:23:03] dedicate jesus
[1:23:05] there and at the temple and brother bam
[1:23:08] describes it many times during the
[1:23:09] sermon expectation
[1:23:10] here mary and joseph they bring turtle
[1:23:13] doves and sacrifice it
[1:23:15] when he's dedicated because they didn't
[1:23:17] have a lamb to sacrifice
[1:23:19] and he comes and he's born in a manger
[1:23:21] he comes to a poor family
[1:23:22] he comes and he's raised up this way and
[1:23:24] he did all these things brother graham
[1:23:26] said can you imagine little jehovah
[1:23:27] crying
[1:23:28] in a manger little jehovah playing as a
[1:23:31] little boy and skin in his knee little
[1:23:33] jehovah as
[1:23:34] a teenager the little girl's laughing at
[1:23:36] him and things like that
[1:23:37] little jehovah he said oh it ought to do
[1:23:39] something to us to recognize
[1:23:40] why did he do it that way it was because
[1:23:42] he loved you enough
[1:23:43] that he wanted to understand what you
[1:23:45] were going through
[1:23:46] he couldn't understand his spirit what
[1:23:49] it meant like to be made fun of but when
[1:23:50] he went into jarius's home and he told
[1:23:52] him the little girl's not dead she's
[1:23:54] just sleeping
[1:23:55] it said they laughed him to scorn and he
[1:23:57] actually knew what it was like to feel
[1:23:59] embarrassment and he knew what it was
[1:24:01] like to stand there at the grave of
[1:24:02] lazarus and weep
[1:24:04] because a friend had died and he could
[1:24:06] go through these human emotions why did
[1:24:08] he do that so that he would be the right
[1:24:09] type of intercessor for you and i
[1:24:11] so that when we went through something
[1:24:13] and sometimes you go through something
[1:24:14] you say
[1:24:15] oh brother nathan i'm going through this
[1:24:16] trial and maybe that's not something
[1:24:18] that i struggle with at all i think
[1:24:19] why why is that a trial why is that
[1:24:22] that's never bothered me
[1:24:23] but to you it's something real and maybe
[1:24:25] i couldn't intercede for you in the
[1:24:26] right way because i think oh oh
[1:24:28] that's not a problem for me at all but
[1:24:30] he knows about it
[1:24:31] he was tempted in all manners and he
[1:24:33] knows what it's like to feel the
[1:24:34] pressures that you go through
[1:24:36] and he did all that and he comes and he
[1:24:38] stands and withstands satan there
[1:24:40] in the desert when he goes and he's
[1:24:42] tempted in the wilderness and satan
[1:24:43] comes at him now
[1:24:44] jesus had the power to just snap his
[1:24:46] fingers and satan could have disappeared
[1:24:49] or he could have ceased to exist or
[1:24:50] whatever i believe he had the power and
[1:24:52] the authority to do that but brother
[1:24:53] branham
[1:24:54] when he tells us about that interaction
[1:24:56] with with god in the
[1:24:57] jesus in the desert there after he gets
[1:24:59] baptized in the river jordan
[1:25:01] and the spirit drives him into the
[1:25:02] wilderness now satan comes and tempts
[1:25:04] him
[1:25:04] for 40 days and 40 nights and he stands
[1:25:07] there and he didn't withstand him with
[1:25:08] gifts or
[1:25:09] he didn't withstand him with
[1:25:10] supernatural power but he kept coming
[1:25:12] back
[1:25:13] it is written it is written
[1:25:16] and now satan would come against him and
[1:25:19] many times satan
[1:25:20] i want you to notice this because satan
[1:25:22] when he quoted the word
[1:25:24] to jesus he he did not come and give him
[1:25:27] some new translation
[1:25:28] he did not come and give him the book of
[1:25:30] the mormon or did not give him the quran
[1:25:32] he was actually
[1:25:33] word by word quoting what moses had said
[1:25:37] but he was taking it out of the context
[1:25:39] that it was given in
[1:25:41] sometimes people will creep right into
[1:25:43] the message and they'll come and they'll
[1:25:45] present a quote to you and say
[1:25:46] but what about this or a scripture and
[1:25:49] what about that but watch the continuity
[1:25:52] because i don't believe that quotes
[1:25:54] contradict quotes or that scriptures
[1:25:55] contradict scriptures
[1:25:57] but people's interpretation of those
[1:25:59] quotes and scriptures will definitely
[1:26:01] contradict one another so when they come
[1:26:04] and they wave it in your face like satan
[1:26:06] did there to
[1:26:06] jesus and said well i'm just quoting the
[1:26:09] prophet
[1:26:10] i'm telling you what he said yes but
[1:26:12] many times they're perverting
[1:26:13] what the continuity of the scripture was
[1:26:16] and satan waved that quote in his face
[1:26:18] and said it is written
[1:26:19] and jesus turned and said but it's also
[1:26:21] written and this scripture that moses
[1:26:24] said can't contradict this other
[1:26:25] scripture over here
[1:26:26] so your interpretation is perverted
[1:26:30] and he withstood satan that way it is
[1:26:32] written brother branham said why did he
[1:26:33] do that
[1:26:34] because he was trying to show that the
[1:26:36] weakest of christian
[1:26:37] could defeat satan any time any place
[1:26:40] under any condition now there's no
[1:26:44] disclaimer at the bottom of that quote
[1:26:45] that says except 2020 and 2021 when
[1:26:48] things get really bad and terrible and
[1:26:50] no the weakest of christian can defeat
[1:26:53] satan anywhere
[1:26:55] any place any time under any condition
[1:26:58] with thus saith the lord
[1:27:02] i want to read you a couple of quotes
[1:27:03] tonight just to build your faith a
[1:27:05] little before we close
[1:27:06] uh you know i i um
[1:27:10] i i've been pastoring there for about 10
[1:27:12] years
[1:27:13] in the new albany area and i i have a
[1:27:16] pulpit that i can preach
[1:27:17] in i don't have to i'm not knocking on
[1:27:19] brother's door saying please let me come
[1:27:21] preach i don't
[1:27:21] have to come preach anywhere god has
[1:27:23] provided me a salary i don't have to beg
[1:27:26] people for tithes or offerings or things
[1:27:28] like that god has provided for me
[1:27:30] i don't come i didn't come here this
[1:27:32] weekend so that i could try to
[1:27:34] add to my uh 401k or so that i could
[1:27:38] try to have another opportunity to
[1:27:39] preach if it hadn't been for the weather
[1:27:41] i would have been preaching back at home
[1:27:43] this weekend so
[1:27:44] i'm not here to for myself but when i
[1:27:47] come to
[1:27:48] church i want to try to encourage
[1:27:49] somebody whether that's the people out
[1:27:51] here or the brother back here or whoever
[1:27:53] it is my goal when i come
[1:27:55] is to try to encourage somebody because
[1:27:57] if not i'm just wasting my time and your
[1:27:59] time and god's time and the pastor's
[1:28:01] time and
[1:28:02] everybody else's so my motive this
[1:28:03] weekend is to try to encourage you
[1:28:05] as the people of god so i want to drop a
[1:28:07] few things in here
[1:28:08] just to remind you of who we are because
[1:28:11] remember
[1:28:11] many times satan will come and he'll
[1:28:13] attack you and you might say oh my
[1:28:15] what what god did through brother
[1:28:17] branham was wonderful and how god uses
[1:28:19] brother david that's wonderful but i'm
[1:28:21] i'm just a nobody well in one way that's
[1:28:23] you're absolutely right so am i
[1:28:25] so is every man that's ever been born
[1:28:27] except jesus we're without jesus we're
[1:28:29] just a nobody
[1:28:31] i hope it doesn't offend you tonight but
[1:28:33] you you take away uh
[1:28:34] you take away god from moses and moses
[1:28:37] was just a
[1:28:38] man that was running from pharaoh that
[1:28:40] was a sheepherder on the back
[1:28:42] side of the desert but you added a god
[1:28:44] quality there with moses when god came
[1:28:46] and gave him a commission
[1:28:47] and all of egypt was no match for moses
[1:28:49] a one-man invasion
[1:28:51] you take david out there and all he was
[1:28:53] was just a shepherd boy but you add god
[1:28:55] to the mix
[1:28:56] and all of a sudden he was a giant
[1:28:58] slayer he was a king
[1:29:00] he was a man that wrote hundreds of
[1:29:01] psalms and he was he was wise
[1:29:03] you take you take a man like like saint
[1:29:07] paul
[1:29:07] without jesus saint paul was a
[1:29:10] persecutor of the church but you come
[1:29:12] and
[1:29:12] add jesus and paul and you had the first
[1:29:14] church age messenger
[1:29:15] you had one of the greatest ministries
[1:29:17] ever in the new testament and all down
[1:29:19] through history
[1:29:20] you take brother branham and you take
[1:29:22] jesus away from him and you just had a
[1:29:24] kentucky hillbilly that was come from
[1:29:26] moonshine and parents
[1:29:27] but you add jesus to the mix and my
[1:29:30] signs and wonders and things that was
[1:29:31] done some of these people that want to
[1:29:32] talk about him brother david
[1:29:34] i say well you you come and show me
[1:29:36] where god has used you to
[1:29:38] to have seven truckloads of wheelchairs
[1:29:40] and crutches and then maybe we'll talk
[1:29:42] but until god has vindicated you like he
[1:29:44] did him i'm not interested in hearing
[1:29:46] your complaint because all you can do
[1:29:48] is sit and complain and write a website
[1:29:50] well there's plenty of people out here
[1:29:51] that can write websites but there's not
[1:29:53] many out here that are vindicated
[1:29:56] and so we look for vindication and we
[1:29:58] look for the word made manifest
[1:30:01] oh my what was it what was the
[1:30:03] attraction on the mountain god
[1:30:04] fulfilling his word remember
[1:30:06] we look for god's word to be fulfilled
[1:30:08] and something has caught the attention
[1:30:11] of the bride in this age that when i
[1:30:12] when i look at brother branham's life to
[1:30:14] me i see malachi 4 and i see revelations
[1:30:17] 10
[1:30:18] 7. i see luke 17 30. i see all these
[1:30:20] scriptures that
[1:30:21] what is it is the word being fulfilled
[1:30:24] amen somebody said well if i you know
[1:30:28] what about this and what about you know
[1:30:29] brother branham didn't pick brother
[1:30:30] branham god picked brother branham
[1:30:32] moses didn't pick moses moses tried to
[1:30:35] run from it but god picked moses so
[1:30:37] it's not so much you look at somebody
[1:30:40] like me
[1:30:40] and and my i'm absolutely nothing
[1:30:43] without jesus but me and jesus
[1:30:45] whatever whatever the problem is you
[1:30:47] just put me on jesus's team
[1:30:48] or let me say it this way put jesus on
[1:30:50] my team we'll take care of it together
[1:30:53] amen just just put me and jesus together
[1:30:56] we've got it covered and i'm not adding
[1:30:58] much to that but
[1:30:59] you put jesus and anybody together and
[1:31:01] they've got it covered
[1:31:02] amen in a prayer line you bring up a
[1:31:04] demon-possessed person cancer whatever
[1:31:06] it is
[1:31:06] i can't do very much but me and jesus
[1:31:09] we've got it covered
[1:31:10] amen i come up against temptation i
[1:31:12] would fall flat on my face every time
[1:31:14] but me and jesus
[1:31:15] we can overcome it something about it
[1:31:19] walking with him makes the difference
[1:31:22] and so many times we get this idea of
[1:31:24] i'm nothing well you are on your own but
[1:31:25] with jesus
[1:31:27] you're more than a conqueror presuming
[1:31:30] 1962 brother baptist makes this
[1:31:32] statement the weakest of saint
[1:31:34] makes the devil tremble now you may not
[1:31:37] have realized when you came to church
[1:31:38] tonight
[1:31:39] that you made devils tremble but i just
[1:31:41] want to remind you tonight what the word
[1:31:43] says
[1:31:43] you say oh i'm just the least of the
[1:31:45] least brother nathan i'm the weakest i
[1:31:47] don't
[1:31:47] i don't have much faith and i don't have
[1:31:48] well some other time we'll talk about a
[1:31:51] positive confession and i believe in
[1:31:52] that too but it doesn't really matter
[1:31:54] what you think of yourself
[1:31:55] it matters what god thinks of you
[1:31:59] the weakest of saint makes the devil
[1:32:01] tremble again jesus christ the same
[1:32:02] yesterday today and forever
[1:32:04] 1955 the devils tremble when the weakest
[1:32:07] of saints
[1:32:08] goes to their knees what a privilege
[1:32:12] or what a power he says rather in a
[1:32:14] privilege has been given to the church
[1:32:16] of the living god when you fall to your
[1:32:18] knees in prayer
[1:32:19] even the devils tremble to the weakest
[1:32:23] of them think of it
[1:32:24] you recognize now why he tries so hard
[1:32:27] to steal your time from prayer
[1:32:31] ma i tell you i've got some things that
[1:32:33] i can go do at home i can try to go out
[1:32:35] to eat with a couple of brothers the
[1:32:36] devil
[1:32:37] usually doesn't try to interrupt that at
[1:32:38] all i can try to go down and
[1:32:40] and go do something for myself go go do
[1:32:43] a hobby or whatever it is the devil
[1:32:45] doesn't try to upset that but you try to
[1:32:47] enter in and spend some time with prayer
[1:32:49] and my all hell will turn loose and try
[1:32:51] to stop you from doing that
[1:32:52] the phone will ring somebody will text
[1:32:54] oh it's urgent brother nathan please
[1:32:56] call please do this
[1:32:57] all this will happen and that will
[1:32:58] happen somebody knock at the door or
[1:33:00] something
[1:33:00] why because the devil is trembling when
[1:33:03] you go to your knees you say oh brother
[1:33:04] nathan you must think that you're
[1:33:05] somebody no
[1:33:06] if i'm the weakest of christians if i go
[1:33:08] to my needs in prayer
[1:33:10] and start having a conversation with the
[1:33:12] king of kings
[1:33:13] and the lord of lords the devils begin
[1:33:15] to tremble because they know
[1:33:16] something is going to take place he's
[1:33:19] talking to the creator again
[1:33:21] oh my maybe it's a little sister well
[1:33:23] i'm just a housewife well brother
[1:33:24] brandon said even the housewife
[1:33:26] has a ministry now her ministry was not
[1:33:28] to come and try to correct her husband
[1:33:30] and tell him what to do and how to how
[1:33:31] to run the house and it was not to come
[1:33:33] and try to
[1:33:33] correct the pastors on facebook and tell
[1:33:35] them what to do but her ministry
[1:33:37] is to be there to as a helpmate to her
[1:33:40] husband brother man said not as a
[1:33:42] doormat
[1:33:42] but as a helpmate and to be there as a
[1:33:45] minister to her little children brother
[1:33:46] baby said there's five gospels matthew
[1:33:49] mark luke john and mother he didn't say
[1:33:52] that about the fathers but he said
[1:33:53] mother
[1:33:54] was the fifth gospel she has a ministry
[1:33:58] anything i'm just i'm just nobody than
[1:34:00] anything but go to your knees one time
[1:34:02] and talk to him and see how the devils
[1:34:05] begin to tremble
[1:34:08] there was a little woman one time she
[1:34:10] was just a little washed woman that had
[1:34:12] a burden on her heart brother brandon
[1:34:14] tells herself that she went down and
[1:34:15] she'd saved her money and she had tried
[1:34:18] to do something for god and she rented a
[1:34:19] livery stable and
[1:34:20] and she'd been washing clothes on an old
[1:34:22] scrub board and saved and saved and
[1:34:24] saved enough money to go and rent a
[1:34:26] livery stable and swept it out and paid
[1:34:28] to have tracks printed up
[1:34:29] and invited a traveling preacher to come
[1:34:31] through a circuit writer preacher and
[1:34:33] have a meeting
[1:34:34] and handing out flyers on the corner and
[1:34:36] and here she was just a little widow
[1:34:38] woman not not very much to
[1:34:39] somebody's thinking of some great
[1:34:41] something or or some great popular
[1:34:43] influence or whatever it be and people
[1:34:45] would just look at them and throw them
[1:34:47] down and walk on
[1:34:48] and a little boy came up that couldn't
[1:34:50] even read and had to have her read the
[1:34:51] track to him to say what it was and
[1:34:53] she told him about the meeting that
[1:34:54] night brother bram said when they got
[1:34:56] there
[1:34:56] it was just the woman and the preacher
[1:34:59] and the little boy that couldn't read
[1:35:01] a lot of people would have said well we
[1:35:02] just you know we don't want to waste our
[1:35:04] time we'll just dismiss service there's
[1:35:06] not
[1:35:06] not a whole lot here but they didn't do
[1:35:08] that they stayed and persevered and the
[1:35:10] man preached
[1:35:10] and the little boy came to the altar
[1:35:12] that night and brother graham said it
[1:35:14] was dwight and moody
[1:35:15] and he led a thousand or a million souls
[1:35:17] to christ
[1:35:20] all for the efforts of one little woman
[1:35:21] now she wasn't the one that led all
[1:35:23] those souls to christ but what if it
[1:35:25] hadn't been for her efforts
[1:35:26] you see we have a part to do as well and
[1:35:29] satan wants to discourage you
[1:35:31] and keep you from doing your part and
[1:35:33] make you think you're nothing
[1:35:34] but god has something for you to do and
[1:35:37] my
[1:35:38] if just going to prayer you know if you
[1:35:40] just think sometimes my
[1:35:42] i wish i could preach a fiery sermon
[1:35:43] that would just might would it would
[1:35:45] shake the devil up and get him mad and i
[1:35:47] wish i could go out and cast out devils
[1:35:49] and do all this
[1:35:50] you want to get devils nervous and upset
[1:35:52] and give them
[1:35:53] some type of a stomach ulcer if they
[1:35:55] have such a thing you just go to prayer
[1:35:56] and you say lord
[1:35:57] i'm just here to talk to you again you
[1:36:00] know it doesn't have to be some great
[1:36:02] rehearse something something that you
[1:36:04] read out of a book or anything like that
[1:36:06] you just talk to him like you would your
[1:36:07] closest friend lord
[1:36:09] i have a need again today and i know you
[1:36:11] care about me and i just wanted to ask
[1:36:13] you to be with this one and be with that
[1:36:14] when the lord you know the things i'm
[1:36:16] struggling with and help
[1:36:17] and devils start having a nervous fit
[1:36:19] and their knees knocking together
[1:36:20] because they know that something's going
[1:36:22] to take place brother branham said it
[1:36:24] this way he said two
[1:36:25] omnipotents have met convinced and then
[1:36:28] concerned 1962 you say brother branham
[1:36:32] i'm the least in the church i'm just a
[1:36:34] little bitty fellow but remember when he
[1:36:36] ascended on high you see
[1:36:38] you are raised with him you're in the
[1:36:40] body
[1:36:41] and you're with christ right now seated
[1:36:43] in heavenly places if you're the skin
[1:36:45] on the bottom of the feet every devil is
[1:36:48] underneath you
[1:36:50] oh my that makes you feel pretty good
[1:36:51] doesn't it oh i don't have to be a big
[1:36:53] part of the body i don't have to be the
[1:36:55] eyes i don't have to be the brain i
[1:36:56] don't have to be the tongue
[1:36:58] i don't have to be this god if i'm just
[1:36:59] the skin on the bottom of the feet
[1:37:01] every devil in hell is underneath me why
[1:37:04] he says our great conqueror has
[1:37:06] conquered every sin everything every
[1:37:08] sickness
[1:37:09] every even death itself that's right
[1:37:11] we're more than conquerors in him
[1:37:13] isaiah said no weapon formed against
[1:37:16] thee shall prosper
[1:37:18] nothing shall prosper that's formed
[1:37:19] against thee let me read you this quote
[1:37:22] in closing if the musicians want to go
[1:37:23] ahead and come we're trying to
[1:37:26] come to a stop here god's covenant god's
[1:37:28] covenant with abraham and his seed 1956
[1:37:31] jesus constantly fear not fear not i am
[1:37:34] he that was dead and alive forevermore
[1:37:36] fear not fear not i'm with thee always
[1:37:38] even to the end of the world fear not
[1:37:40] and the christian keeps sitting back
[1:37:42] oh i just wonder he said oh my turn
[1:37:45] loose
[1:37:45] amen get all the things away from you
[1:37:48] say mr
[1:37:48] satan you are defeated jesus christ
[1:37:52] stripped you of every power you had
[1:37:55] and when he died at calvary and you're
[1:37:57] nothing but a bluff
[1:37:59] and you can't bluff me he says amen i'm
[1:38:02] made out of that stuff that don't bluff
[1:38:07] amen the devil's just a bluff but we're
[1:38:10] made out of stuff that don't bluff i
[1:38:11] read that's that quote a while back at
[1:38:13] church and my song leader wrote a song
[1:38:14] about it but oh my it's good to know
[1:38:17] he's just a bluff jesus christ already
[1:38:21] paid the price already defeated him
[1:38:23] everything that we have need of jesus
[1:38:25] already paid the price for
[1:38:27] what are we afraid of why do we allow
[1:38:29] the enemy to come
[1:38:31] and attack us
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:35] second chronicles chapter 20 verse 15
[1:38:37] says be not afraid
[1:38:39] nor dismayed by reason of this great
[1:38:41] multitude for the battle is not yours
[1:38:43] but god's it's not your battle in the
[1:38:46] first place give it to god and see what
[1:38:48] he can do
[1:38:49] the scripture says in romans chapter 8
[1:38:51] verse 31
[1:38:52] what shall we say then to these things
[1:38:54] if god be for us
[1:38:56] who can be against us nothing formed
[1:38:59] against us will prosper
[1:39:01] i don't care how many viruses they form
[1:39:03] i don't care what
[1:39:04] politics tries to change laws and take
[1:39:06] away religious freedoms or whatever it
[1:39:08] be
[1:39:09] no matter what they come up say oh you
[1:39:10] can't preach against this or preach
[1:39:12] against that it's a hate crime
[1:39:13] nothing formed against this can prosper
[1:39:16] what should i be afraid of i
[1:39:18] my father owns the cattle on a thousand
[1:39:20] hills
[1:39:22] he created the heavens and the earth so
[1:39:24] that he would have a betting ground to
[1:39:26] bring you from the dust of that earth
[1:39:28] so that he could have fellowship with
[1:39:29] you he loved you that much why should we
[1:39:32] be afraid
[1:39:33] i won't fear what man can do for do to
[1:39:35] me but i'm trusting
[1:39:37] in the everlasting unseen hands of jesus
[1:39:39] christ
[1:39:40] amen let's let's pray together tonight
[1:39:42] lord jesus

[1:39:49] strength to your people
[1:39:50] lord i recognize and the age that we
[1:39:53] live in many times
[1:39:56] people get so beaten down and down
[1:39:58] trodden
[1:39:59] and they get in a place where they feel
[1:40:01] like nobody knows what they're going
[1:40:03] through and
[1:40:04] nobody understands and that it's just
[1:40:06] them against everybody else well
[1:40:08] elijah got in that condition one time
[1:40:10] lord and you reminded him that there

[1:40:14] a knee to baal
[1:40:15] there were others that were that were
[1:40:17] victorious and that were
[1:40:19] standing for the truth so father i pray
[1:40:22] that in this age where there's such a
[1:40:24] spirit of isolation
[1:40:26] trying to get the members of the body of
[1:40:29] christ separated from one another if
[1:40:31] he can't get him separated over doctrine
[1:40:33] he'll separate him over
[1:40:34] church order and if he can't separate
[1:40:36] him over church order he'll
[1:40:38] separate him over fear of of of
[1:40:40] sicknesses and germs and things like
[1:40:43] that but i pray father
[1:40:44] that you'd move on the scene and grant
[1:40:47] healing to your body
[1:40:49] this great body of jesus christ

[1:45:55] afraid
[1:45:57] whether god's going to keep his word or

[1:46:09] is just such an important part of
[1:46:14] what it is and you know i we know one
[1:46:17] thing that

[1:47:15] you say lord this is my condition and
[1:47:17] i'm bringing it to you
[1:47:19] i'm casting it into your hands i'm
[1:47:23] placing it in your hands
[1:47:24] because when you have it it'll be
[1:47:27] successful
[1:47:28] amen we just really
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] are thankful for the good words that we
[1:47:35] heard this week
[1:47:36] and and you know i know that

[1:48:26] highway department and the police asked
[1:48:28] us if we could stay off the roads that's
[1:48:30] the time that
