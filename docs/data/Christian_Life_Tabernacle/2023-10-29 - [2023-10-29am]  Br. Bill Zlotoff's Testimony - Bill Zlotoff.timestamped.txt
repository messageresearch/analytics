[11:10] service to you we look forward to your

[11:14] glorify you in all that we do in Jesus
[11:16] name amen amen let's go ahead and be
[11:19] seated this
[11:22] morning I think we all woke up in
[11:24] Seattle this morning so welcome to
[11:27] Seattle
[11:29] you know I was just reading this week in
[11:31] Galatians 3 and you know there were just
[11:34] some verses that you know we all know
[11:37] that sort of stuck out to me and you
[11:40] verse 16 he says now to Abraham in his
[11:43] Seed where the promise is made he saith
[11:47] not Anto seeds as of
[11:50] many but as of
[11:53] one and to thy seed which is Christ you
[11:58] know he goes on to say in verse 26 for
[12:00] ye are all the children of God by faith
[12:04] in Christ Jesus amen for as many of you
[12:08] as have been baptized into Christ have
[12:11] put on Christ and if ye be
[12:15] christs then are ye Abraham's seed amen
[12:19] and HS according to the
[12:22] promise you know there has always ever
[12:26] been one seed to who the promises that's
[12:30] right
[12:32] applied you know as Paul said in Romans
[12:34] it was not a biological
[12:37] seed it's not a specific nationality or
[12:41] culture or race or
[12:46] family and we see it spoken of
[12:48] throughout the
[12:50] scriptures from the earliest days in the
[12:53] garden in Genesis 3:15 where God spoke
[12:57] to that serpent
[13:00] he said I will put enmity between thee
[13:02] and the
[13:03] woman and between thy seed and her
[13:07] seed singular
[13:10] one and it singular one shall bruise thy
[13:17] head and thou shalt bruise his
[13:20] heel you know reading Psalm 89 and we'll
[13:24] be reading that this morning if you want
[13:25] to go ahead and turn there and in verse
[13:27] three it says
[13:29] I have made a covenant with my children
[13:33] amen with my chosen rather I have sworn
[13:36] unto David my
[13:38] servant thy
[13:40] seed
[13:42] singular will I establish
[13:45] forever and build up thy Throne to all
[13:50] generations he spoke this by a prophet
[13:53] to David in 2 Samuel 7 he said and when
[13:56] thy days be fulfilled
[13:59] and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I
[14:02] will set up thy seed after
[14:05] thee which shall proceed out of thy
[14:08] bowels and I will establish his
[14:12] kingdom he shall build an house for my
[14:15] name and I will establish the Throne of
[14:18] his kingdom
[14:21] forever and then one day Solomon his son
[14:23] rose up became king he built a temple
[14:29] and as he was dedicating the house of
[14:30] the Lord he said this in First Kings
[14:35] 8:18 and the Lord said unto David my
[14:38] father whereas it was in thine heart to
[14:41] build an house unto my name thou did
[14:44] well that it was in thine
[14:47] heart you know if you what's interesting
[14:49] is we often refer to David as a man
[14:53] after God's Own
[14:56] Heart and what was on his heart
[14:59] was that a house should be
[15:03] built that God could put his name
[15:07] on and that was what was in God's heart
[15:11] his his desire would that there would be
[15:14] a house established forever that he
[15:17] could put his name on their desires were
[15:21] the
[15:22] same you know and there are many
[15:25] throughout the years that thought this
[15:26] promise was fulfilled that when David's
[15:29] physical seed built a physical
[15:34] house but you know that was just a
[15:36] shadow and a tipe right you know Solomon
[15:40] died David's physical
[15:43] Dynasty and Throne passed away there's
[15:46] no more Thrones in
[15:49] Israel and the temple which he built was
[15:53] destroyed rebuilt by a Godless King
[15:57] destroyed again
[15:59] it's been dust and Ashes for 2,000 years
[16:01] and yet the scriptures spoke of a
[16:06] seed which would establish an
[16:09] everlasting Kingdom and throne and house
[16:14] that he could put his name
[16:16] on you know the same
[16:19] seed that is referred to in
[16:22] Genesis in 2
[16:24] Samuel in
[16:26] Galatians in Romans
[16:30] one
[16:31] seed you as brother brandham showed us
[16:33] in the
[16:34] scripture his threefold
[16:38] purpose to perform the
[16:41] work where he could ultimately dwell
[16:44] with and in his
[16:49] people that reflected his
[16:53] identity you know throughout the years
[16:55] men have tried to mix that seed with
[16:57] different things
[16:59] whether that's been I be cast into the
[17:01] sea so let's just read uh Psalm 89 we're
[17:04] going to start in verse 18 and we're
[17:06] going to read from Verse 18 to verse 13
[17:08] then thou spakest in Vision to thy
[17:11] Vision to thy Holy One and say I have
[17:13] laid help upon one that is mighty I have
[17:16] exalted one chosen out of the people I
[17:19] have found David my servant with whom
[17:22] holy oil have I anointed him with whom
[17:25] mine hand shall be established my arm
[17:27] also strengthen him the enemy shall not
[17:30] exact upon him nor the son of wickedness
[17:33] afflict him and I will beat down his
[17:36] foes before his face and plague them
[17:38] that hate him but my faithfulness and my
[17:41] Mercy shall be with him and in my name
[17:44] shall his horn be exalted I will set his
[17:47] hand also in the sea and his right hand
[17:50] in the rivers he shall cry unto me thou
[17:53] art my father my God and the rock of my
[17:56] salvation also I will make him my first
[17:59] born higher than the kings of the earth
[18:03] my Mercy will I keep for him forever
[18:05] more and my Covenant shall stand fast
[18:08] with him his seed also will I make to
[18:11] endure forever and his throne as the
[18:13] days of Heaven if his children forsake
[18:16] my law and walk not in my judgments if
[18:19] they break my statutes and keep not my
[18:21] Commandments then will I visit their
[18:24] transgression with the rod and their
[18:26] iniquity with stripes nevertheless Le my
[18:28] loving kindness will I not utterly take
[18:31] from him nor suffer my faithfulness to
[18:34] fail my Covenant will I not break nor
[18:37] alter the thing that has gone out of my
[18:39] lips once have I sworn by my Holiness
[18:42] that I will not lie unto David his seed
[18:46] shall endure forever and his throne as
[18:48] the son before me it shall be
[18:51] established forever as the moon and as a
[18:54] faithful witness in heaven

[49:13] will and this is the time where you can
[49:15] ask what you will amen whatever the need
[49:18] might be in our lives Lord each one of
[49:20] us as individual has
[49:23] needs ask what you will our father is
[49:26] there to give us what we have need of he
[49:28] even knows what our needs was before we
[49:30] even
[49:31] asked but as a father he wants to be
[49:35] asked so this
[49:37] morning as we say a few words
[49:41] Lord come come be with us let the Holy
[49:45] Spirit Lord move amongst us up and down
[49:48] these aisles heal the brokenhearted heal
[49:51] the
[49:52] sick help the needy whatever it might be
[49:57] Lord you're the one that we're asking to
[49:59] do
[50:00] this we love you Lord and we appreciate
[50:03] you we appreciate your grace and we ask
[50:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:08] Christ amen amen amen you may be seated
[50:12] for a moment then we'll we read the
[50:15] scripture we'll have you stand
[50:22] and
[50:24] so I want to see where my wife is
[50:28] Marcy when she's there I know I'm
[50:31] okay we've been married 51 years this
[50:35] last October 51
[50:37] years and so she's she's me she's who I
[50:42] am and uh appreciate there's been people
[50:46] in my life I'm
[50:48] sorry tell you get in the presence of
[50:50] the Lord there's nothing like
[50:52] it I gave my heart to the Lord over 50
[50:55] years
[50:57] ago and uh as you get
[51:01] older you know less but there's one
[51:04] thing you do know is that when you get
[51:06] in his presence just try to stay there
[51:09] as long as you can amen try to stay in
[51:12] his presence because it's not always
[51:14] like that you have to go back out into
[51:17] this world and back out in
[51:19] humanity and it's it's hard it's tough
[51:24] even pulling out on the street
[51:25] having it's a tough thing to to look
[51:28] both
[51:29] ways but if you give it all to him he's
[51:32] the one that's watching out after us
[51:35] amen amen you
[51:37] know I was
[51:39] thinking as the church has been going up
[51:41] out here and and
[51:44] uh I've watched it i' I've been a friend
[51:47] of David over 50
[51:49] years and
[51:51] uh and the Bible says without a vision
[51:54] that people perish yes and I think that
[51:57] Brother David all these years has had a
[51:59] vision even when I first met him he had
[52:02] a vision and his vision was he wanted he
[52:05] wanted to get closer to God but he
[52:07] wanted whoever he was talking to to get
[52:09] closer to
[52:10] God and that's his purpose I think
[52:12] that's as a pastor that's what he wants
[52:15] he wants every one of us to have that
[52:17] walk with Jesus to know him better and
[52:20] better and better every day know him
[52:22] just as close as you can get with him he
[52:25] wants you to have that presence with the
[52:27] Lord and as I've watched the church go
[52:29] up and excuse me my nose runs a little
[52:32] bit when I'm when I talk and and I was
[52:35] watched the church and I watched the I
[52:36] was here last year about this time and
[52:39] all it was he was working on the parking
[52:41] lot and the light poles were going up
[52:43] and the church the foundation hadn't
[52:45] even been poured yet
[52:47] and and then I watched at the videos
[52:49] that he's had on you brothers and
[52:51] sisters have had online I've been able
[52:53] to watch the church go up
[52:56] and that's how God does it yes he starts
[53:00] with a solid ground you don't want to be
[53:03] built on a sanding ground you don't want
[53:06] to build on a Shifty ground that's going
[53:07] to move and it's going to come tumbling
[53:10] down the Bible teaches that but you want
[53:11] to be built on a solid ground Jesus is
[53:15] that Solid Ground amen and I've watched
[53:18] the church go up and and as it's come up
[53:22] I saw the you know the floor being
[53:23] poured and then the they so the uh
[53:26] framing being done and then the roof was
[53:28] put on and then the roofers were putting
[53:30] the roof on and and now to look at
[53:34] it came over the other night with
[53:36] Brother David and uh you walk in and
[53:39] just it's just
[53:41] beautiful when things work in
[53:44] harmony that's how our church is we work
[53:46] in harmony the deacons are doing their
[53:49] jobs brother Billy the song leader does
[53:52] his
[53:53] job everyone one of us the trustees do
[53:56] their
[53:58] job every one of us that comes we do a
[54:01] job we have a job to do you know without
[54:06] you there' just be someone standing up
[54:09] talking to the walls but you as people
[54:13] in the body of Christ bring Christ you
[54:17] bring him here and that alone is you're
[54:20] doing your job have you made yourself
[54:22] ready this morning did you prepare
[54:25] prepare your hearts this morning to hear
[54:26] that word did you get the foundation
[54:29] ready before the walls have gone up you
[54:32] know if you haven't made
[54:34] that this morning and you've not done
[54:36] that there's still time to do that time
[54:40] isn't as we know is not over yet it
[54:42] looks like it's getting close but all
[54:44] the things that are going on in this
[54:46] world but it hasn't I don't believe it's
[54:48] happen CU I'm still here cuz I'm going
[54:50] in the Rapture hallelujah amen I'm going
[54:53] to be one of those ones that will see my
[54:56] Lord
[54:57] Savior and I'm going to be walking with
[54:59] him one of these days hand in hand along
[55:01] that Creek like Billy Paul is right now
[55:04] with brother brandham walking hand in
[55:06] hand with Billy with brother brandham
[55:08] along that Creek I'm going to be walking
[55:10] with my savior one of these days you
[55:12] know and that's God's whole purpose as
[55:15] he you know when he before there was
[55:18] even God there was just time space there
[55:22] wasn't even time there was just God was
[55:25] God was just who he
[55:27] was and but he in his being wanted to
[55:32] have
[55:34] Fellowship wanted to have sons and
[55:36] daughters ones that he could fellowship
[55:37] with he wanted to be able to show his
[55:41] attributes his healing power his love
[55:44] his kindness his Joy he wanted to be
[55:47] able to share those with his people so
[55:51] in this greatness of God again before
[55:53] God in this greatness in the spirit a
[55:57] Halo went out this is how brother Ram
[55:59] says it a Halo went out the logos of God
[56:04] the same the same Pillar of Fire that's
[56:06] right there the lcus of God the same
[56:09] Pillar of Fire that led Moses out of
[56:11] Egypt the same Pillar of Fire that led
[56:14] the children of Israel at night is the
[56:17] same logus of fire that leads us today
[56:19] amen there's no difference it's the same
[56:21] thing you look at the logos of God
[56:24] that's
[56:25] that's who we are that logos went out
[56:28] and that logos was Jesus Christ that
[56:31] logos was the word of God and that's
[56:34] what that was it was the word of God
[56:37] Jesus Christ God didn't have hands he
[56:40] didn't have a mouth he didn't have able
[56:43] to express himself through a body so he
[56:46] had to have one that he borne to himself
[56:49] Jesus Christ he born to himself so he
[56:52] could express himself to us isn't that
[56:54] one wonderful brothers and sisters that
[56:57] he thought of all us you know I was able
[57:01] to go on a river trip here in the Grand
[57:05] Canyon a couple years ago we spent 11
[57:08] days on the
[57:09] river and I don't know if any of you
[57:11] ever had the chance to do a river trip
[57:13] or been in the Grand Canyon but it's a
[57:14] magnificent place you can just see God
[57:18] and everything I've I've had the
[57:19] opportunity to go down from one side to
[57:22] then up the other side and I've I've
[57:25] done over the years I've done a lot of
[57:27] running we actually ran the Grand
[57:29] Canyon and with a mountain you know
[57:33] you're you're going you're going up but
[57:36] you don't really see time but in the
[57:38] Grand Canyon you're going almost back in
[57:41] time because you're going down into the
[57:43] Earth crust and you so you get down into
[57:46] into the Grand Canyon and as we were
[57:48] floating down the
[57:50] river we we were in uh dories and there
[57:54] were some AR archeologists with us and
[57:56] there were some astronomers with us and
[57:58] as we would float down the river they
[58:00] would say yeah these rocks here are a
[58:03] billion and a half years old and they
[58:06] would say aren't they beautiful and I
[58:07] say w they're just they're just
[58:10] magnificent and then at night the Stars
[58:12] would come out and it's so dark down
[58:15] that you can just the stars are just
[58:17] like little crystals just bright and
[58:20] shiny and yeah
[58:23] amen and uh I was I would look at those
[58:26] and there was an archaeologist and he
[58:28] says yeah and that consolation is so and
[58:31] so and and that star is so and so aren't
[58:35] they beautiful and I said yeah they're
[58:39] beautiful and one night I was I had
[58:42] gotten up and something inside me says
[58:44] you know you know the
[58:47] maker I know the one that did all this
[58:51] these people never even mentioned about
[58:53] our God that's right but I personally as
[58:55] a Son of God could stand there I know
[58:57] the one that did
[58:59] that and I got up one morning and I got
[59:03] out of the tent it was about 2: in the
[59:04] morning and the moon had come
[59:07] up and the walls were glistening along
[59:10] the sides of the river and the ri you
[59:12] could hear the river the sound of the
[59:14] river and it was just beautiful and I
[59:18] got up and I said Lord thank
[59:20] you thank you that the greatest our Lord
[59:24] who so great so powerful so magnificent
[59:28] lives
[59:30] here and he says son you were with me
[59:34] when I did this amen that's right every
[59:38] one of
[59:39] us every one of us was with him when he
[59:42] created all this glory and
[59:45] magnificence we are in his
[59:48] thinking God knows what he's doing
[59:51] amen so if you would stand with me this
[59:55] morning
[59:56] and Brother David just kind
[59:59] of being Brother David I got a call this
[1:00:05] morning so I don't have a lot but I
[1:00:10] don't rely on this anyway amen we rely
[1:00:12] on the Lord Jesus
[1:00:14] Christ so I would like to read I'm going
[1:00:17] to read a couple scriptures and maybe a
[1:00:19] little something that brother brandom
[1:00:21] said but first of all let's let's turn
[1:00:24] to Timothy Chapter 2 second Timothy
[1:00:28] Timothy excuse me I better put my
[1:00:30] glasses
[1:00:33] on second
[1:00:39] Timothy the first
[1:00:43] chapter I was thinking when brother Mike
[1:00:45] was reading the psalm this morning I
[1:00:47] could have just stayed in there because
[1:00:48] he was preaching what I was going to
[1:00:49] talk about and I'm not a preacher I'm
[1:00:51] just going to give you a testimony this
[1:00:53] morning but he was talking about what I
[1:00:55] was I said I'm just going to stay in
[1:00:56] here and he can just keep on going that
[1:00:58] would have been just really nice so
[1:01:01] second Timothy one starting at the eth
[1:01:11] verse okay be not thou therefore ashamed
[1:01:16] of the testimony of Our
[1:01:19] Lord nor of me his prisoners now this is
[1:01:22] Paul
[1:01:23] speaking
[1:01:25] nor of me his prisoner but be thou
[1:01:29] partakers of the afflictions of The
[1:01:31] Gospel According to the power of God who
[1:01:34] has saved us and called us with a holy
[1:01:39] calling not according to our
[1:01:43] works but according to his own purpose
[1:01:46] and Grace which was given us in Christ
[1:01:50] Jesus before the world
[1:01:53] began
[1:01:55] but is now made manifest by the
[1:01:57] appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who
[1:02:00] hath abolished death and hath brought
[1:02:03] life immortality to light through the
[1:02:07] gospel wherefore where unto I am
[1:02:11] appointed a preacher and an apostle and
[1:02:14] a teacher of the
[1:02:16] Gentiles for the which cause I also
[1:02:19] suffer these things nevertheless I am
[1:02:22] not ashamed for I know know who I have
[1:02:26] believed and am
[1:02:29] persuaded that he is able to
[1:02:32] keep that which I have committed un him
[1:02:36] against that
[1:02:38] day amen there's not through your heart
[1:02:41] that takes us right out of it doesn't it
[1:02:44] we have nothing to do with it it's by
[1:02:46] his grace by his Mercy he keeps us we
[1:02:50] can't do
[1:02:52] anything he's going to take care of it
[1:02:55] all for us amen let's turn over
[1:02:59] to Psalm
[1:03:13] 37 uh 37 and uh verse
[1:03:17] 23 and these are all scriptures I'm sure
[1:03:20] every one of you have heard before but
[1:03:22] it's just it also puts me into
[1:03:25] remembrance and reminds me of what God
[1:03:28] is doing amen so
[1:03:32] 23 the
[1:03:33] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:03:37] Lord and he delighteth in his
[1:03:40] way though he fall he shall not be
[1:03:44] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[1:03:47] him with his hand says the steps of a
[1:03:51] good man are ordered by the Lord amen so
[1:03:54] he's going to keep us and he's also
[1:03:56] ordered our steps so what are we worried
[1:03:59] about that's right we' have no worries
[1:04:01] this morning right he is going to take
[1:04:03] care of
[1:04:04] everything and then the last scripture
[1:04:07] before you can be seated uh John
[1:04:15] 15 this is probably one of my favorite
[1:04:19] scriptures and I think if you Ponder on
[1:04:23] it and you think about about it it puts
[1:04:26] everything completely into perspective
[1:04:28] of where we are our lives the revelation
[1:04:30] of Jesus Christ in this day the mystery
[1:04:32] of God revealed which was Jesus Christ
[1:04:36] mystery it says here in the we'll go uh
[1:04:40] the 15 uh 16 verse
[1:04:43] 16 ye have not chosen me but I have
[1:04:49] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:04:53] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:04:56] your fruit shall remain that whatsoever
[1:04:59] you shall ask of the father in my name
[1:05:02] he may give it to
[1:05:04] you I want to go back to the first there
[1:05:07] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:05:11] you let's just pray Lord Jesus we
[1:05:14] appreciate your word we could Lord we
[1:05:16] could go home now and we could Feast on
[1:05:19] these scriptures all day long Lord but
[1:05:22] Lord we ask that you would come maybe
[1:05:24] say something Lord that would help every
[1:05:27] one of us would help
[1:05:29] me and we appreciate your word this
[1:05:31] morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:05:33] amen you may be
[1:05:40] seated
[1:05:42] so I was
[1:05:45] just you know you you go back and you
[1:05:51] think about your life and maybe when I
[1:05:53] talk talk a little bit about my
[1:05:55] testimony and how I met Brother David
[1:05:57] because that's what I'm going to tell
[1:05:58] you he says be careful don't tell him
[1:06:00] everything and I and I've known him a
[1:06:03] long time uh but he's a precious brother
[1:06:08] and there's I've met a lot of a lot of
[1:06:10] good man a lot of wonderful people
[1:06:13] Christian man in my
[1:06:15] life
[1:06:17] but there's a couple that just stand
[1:06:20] out to me in my life that has been such
[1:06:24] a foundation in my
[1:06:26] life and that one of them is Brother
[1:06:30] David and I want to also say that my
[1:06:35] wife and she's part of my testimony and
[1:06:37] I'll tell you about
[1:06:38] her has been a main stay of my
[1:06:43] life and
[1:06:46] uh I was I I was raised in a Jewish
[1:06:51] Family and so I was never ever taught
[1:06:54] about Jesus Christ didn't know who he
[1:06:58] was didn't have any idea who he was
[1:07:00] because in the Jewish religion or the
[1:07:02] faith they don't teach you about Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ you learn about the Old Testament
[1:07:06] you learn about Moses and David and all
[1:07:08] the Patriarchs and Jacob and all the
[1:07:11] ones in the Old Testament but they don't
[1:07:13] ever talk about Jesus Christ because
[1:07:15] that they don't believe the Messiah has
[1:07:17] come yet and he said well brother Bill
[1:07:20] you were a true devout Jew no I was a
[1:07:22] renegade
[1:07:24] I I I didn't there's something about it
[1:07:26] I would go to Sabbath school they didn't
[1:07:28] have Sunday school but they would have
[1:07:29] Sabbath
[1:07:30] school
[1:07:32] and I would go to Sabbath school and I I
[1:07:35] would try to go sneak out and go hide
[1:07:38] somewhere because it just there was just
[1:07:40] some it just didn't do anything there
[1:07:41] was something that just you know the
[1:07:43] Deep call the deep but there was nothing
[1:07:45] calling there was nothing there that
[1:07:47] would just seemed like they were just
[1:07:48] talking and and the stories are
[1:07:50] wonderful we know that the Old Testament
[1:07:52] is a shadow of the new
[1:07:54] if you can't see Jesus Christ in every
[1:07:58] verse in the Old Testament you're
[1:08:00] missing
[1:08:01] something you should be able to read the
[1:08:03] Old Testament and see a shadow of the
[1:08:06] new amen he's in every verse brothers
[1:08:09] and sisters and I think as we get older
[1:08:10] we see that did I know that when I first
[1:08:13] became a Christian no because I didn't
[1:08:15] even know who Jesus was you know I was
[1:08:18] trying to learn who he was and
[1:08:22] so not being brought up in a Christian
[1:08:25] family I'll tell you what my thought of
[1:08:28] of Jesus was was when I would go over to
[1:08:31] F that Christmas time I would go over to
[1:08:35] friend's house and I would see a
[1:08:37] Christmas tree in the corner with lights
[1:08:39] on it to me that's what Jesus Christ was
[1:08:42] I mean that's how I I just didn't know
[1:08:45] and I would look at that tree I said
[1:08:46] well that must in my I would think well
[1:08:47] that must be Jesus in the corner there
[1:08:49] in that tree I just didn't know I wasn't
[1:08:52] brought up I had no idea who he
[1:08:56] was and so my wife and I I met her when
[1:09:02] she was 13 I don't think we started
[1:09:04] dating till we were 16 she was 16 I was
[1:09:07] a few years older than
[1:09:09] her and uh uh I was working as a
[1:09:14] carpenter for my uncle up on a mountain
[1:09:17] and right below the the mountain there
[1:09:19] there was the school where Marcy went to
[1:09:22] school and uh
[1:09:24] she used to walk up to the school or to
[1:09:27] where I was working about 3:30 her
[1:09:30] school was out and I'd get off at 3:30
[1:09:32] and she would walk up the hill and and I
[1:09:35] had uh I would wait for her and then I
[1:09:37] would take her home and so excuse
[1:09:43] me she uh she came walking up one
[1:09:46] afternoon and and she was
[1:09:50] crying and I said I saidoh why you
[1:09:52] crying she goes oh you wouldn't
[1:09:56] understand and I said and I was I was 19
[1:10:00] years old young people I was young one
[1:10:03] time I was your
[1:10:05] age God's real let me tell you God is
[1:10:10] real you just can't put words on as you
[1:10:13] get older you see him in your life doing
[1:10:16] more and more and
[1:10:17] more miracles in your life and things in
[1:10:20] your life and with your family and your
[1:10:22] kids and it's just he is so
[1:10:24] real anyway she came walking up she was
[1:10:28] crying and I said oh why are you crying
[1:10:30] she goes oh you wouldn't understand and
[1:10:33] I said well did someone hit you or did
[1:10:36] you have a problem at school she goes no
[1:10:38] no no and she was crying I'm saying well
[1:10:41] tell me why you're crying she goes
[1:10:45] well I went to
[1:10:47] a young life meeting at school and some
[1:10:51] of you might familiar with young life
[1:10:54] and it was at her school and I think I
[1:10:57] think she was a junior in high school at
[1:10:59] that time and uh she goes I gave my
[1:11:02] heart to the Lord I said you what gave
[1:11:05] your heart to who you know I thought I
[1:11:07] had her
[1:11:10] heart you know but I guess I wasn't the
[1:11:13] only one you know but she gave her heart
[1:11:16] she's I gave my heart to the Lord and I
[1:11:19] said well what's all that about she goes
[1:11:21] well you wouldn't understand I guess
[1:11:22] well I guess I don't
[1:11:24] so I took her home
[1:11:28] and I was at that time I we were kind of
[1:11:31] like hippies you know it's kind of like
[1:11:33] Brother David when he was before he had
[1:11:35] gotten saved and had long hair and that
[1:11:38] kind of stuff and I'm not glorifying any
[1:11:39] of that brother and sister I'm just
[1:11:40] telling you a testimony this is
[1:11:43] glorifying
[1:11:44] God that's who I want to glorify this
[1:11:46] morning Amen in our testimony each one
[1:11:49] of our testimony we each have a
[1:11:51] testimony on what has God has done in
[1:11:53] our Liv lives none greater than the
[1:11:55] other they're all great because of him
[1:11:58] it's his righteousness that's here I'm
[1:12:01] only saved because of him I'm only saved
[1:12:04] by grace by his Mercy by his kindness
[1:12:07] that's the only reason I'm here
[1:12:09] today if it hadn't been for that I would
[1:12:11] probably be dead now or who knows where
[1:12:13] I'd be in prison somewhere I don't
[1:12:16] know but so time went on and we were of
[1:12:21] course back then we were doing things
[1:12:23] you know and with the with the drugs and
[1:12:25] stuff and I'm not good I'm not
[1:12:26] glorifying that it's not
[1:12:28] good and uh she
[1:12:31] changed and I saw something in her life
[1:12:34] change and I didn't understand it I
[1:12:37] couldn't figure it out i' we'd I'd say
[1:12:39] well let's let's go we went to a lot of
[1:12:41] rock concerts back in San Diego and I
[1:12:44] probably passed I me I probably passed
[1:12:46] path with David when he was The Wizard I
[1:12:49] don't know if you know his
[1:12:51] testimony but uh
[1:12:54] but she just all of a sudden she didn't
[1:12:56] want to do the same things that I wanted
[1:12:58] to do she didn't want to go to the rock
[1:13:00] concerts and she didn't want to go out
[1:13:02] with the guys and the girls and do with
[1:13:04] things that we did you know and she just
[1:13:05] no I'm I'm not doing that and I said
[1:13:09] well what are you GNA do I'm going to a
[1:13:11] Bible study and I went Bible study what
[1:13:14] is a Bible study I can I had no idea she
[1:13:17] goes well she goes when we all get
[1:13:19] together and talk about the Bible and I
[1:13:21] said well okay well I'm going out with
[1:13:22] the guys you go to your Bible study but
[1:13:25] there was she had changed I saw that
[1:13:28] change in
[1:13:29] her and I know that it it started to
[1:13:32] affect me because I I'll be honest with
[1:13:34] you I loved her and after 51 years plus
[1:13:38] you I still love her and I hope she
[1:13:40] loves me she
[1:13:45] does and so I saw her her life
[1:13:50] change and then there was a friend of
[1:13:52] mine
[1:13:53] that uh and I used to Surf I surfed a
[1:13:56] lot I love the ocean used to spend a lot
[1:13:58] of time in the ocean and Surf and just
[1:14:01] loved it and uh there was a friend of
[1:14:03] mine that served us up but then he got
[1:14:08] saved and I'm I'm I'm I'm looking and he
[1:14:11] changed and I'm saying what what in the
[1:14:14] world is going on first my girlfriend
[1:14:16] and then my good friend and I said
[1:14:18] they're all making these changes and I
[1:14:20] don't know anything about it so he moved
[1:14:23] up up to a place in California called
[1:14:26] Ventura California and it's a Beachside
[1:14:29] community and he lived there and and uh
[1:14:33] he was you know and I I kept watching
[1:14:35] Marcy and again she wouldn't didn't want
[1:14:37] to do the things that we used to do and
[1:14:40] then he moved away and so he came down
[1:14:42] one time and he he says uh why don't you
[1:14:46] why don't you come up to Ventura the
[1:14:49] waves are real good I heard if I heard
[1:14:51] the waves were good I'm going because
[1:14:53] that was that's what it was all about
[1:14:55] back then for me anyway and uh he said
[1:14:58] the waves are supposed to be good this
[1:15:00] week and why don't you come up and we'll
[1:15:02] go surfing and I said that that's a plan
[1:15:05] so I did I I drove up to Ventura and I
[1:15:08] think I believe it was on a Friday and
[1:15:10] we surfed and then he says by the way he
[1:15:13] said we're going to go to a Bible
[1:15:15] study a house meeting and I thought well
[1:15:20] okay and I don't know if you ever heard
[1:15:22] of the Jesus people movement some of you
[1:15:25] might have heard that back in California
[1:15:26] I was part of that and uh say what you
[1:15:30] want about some of those things that's
[1:15:32] where God called me amen it doesn't
[1:15:35] sometimes God is we think we have it
[1:15:38] figured
[1:15:39] out we don't have it figured out
[1:15:41] brothers and sisters we just got to let
[1:15:43] God lead us we just have to let God
[1:15:46] direct us it's not what we think you
[1:15:49] know when we think we want to go this
[1:15:50] way all a sudden we're going this way
[1:15:51] why are we going this way because God
[1:15:53] taking us that way amen so okay I said
[1:15:58] okay I I'll go do the Bible study with
[1:16:00] you and uh and and so we went to it was
[1:16:03] a house meeting and there was a pretty
[1:16:06] good sized home but there was a big
[1:16:07] floor and I walked in there was all
[1:16:09] these young people sitting on the floor
[1:16:11] looked like me had you know had long
[1:16:13] hair and they were all singing and
[1:16:15] praising the Lord and I kind of stood
[1:16:17] back kind of back in the doorway and I
[1:16:19] was clean the doorway cuz I didn't I
[1:16:21] honestly didn't understand it I didn't
[1:16:23] know what was what it was all
[1:16:26] about and uh there was a man at the time
[1:16:28] I probably thought he was an old man but
[1:16:30] I'm sure he was only his 30s you know
[1:16:33] and he's talking about the Lord and had
[1:16:34] his Bible and he would he would say a
[1:16:36] few things and they'd all raise their
[1:16:38] hands and say amen and then they would
[1:16:40] sing a song and I'm just standing back
[1:16:42] there watching this and and uh at the
[1:16:46] end of the
[1:16:48] meeting he uh he goes and he knew I was
[1:16:52] standing back there he I'm sure he go
[1:16:53] was right there and he goes uh is there
[1:16:56] anybody that's never met this Jesus
[1:17:00] Christ
[1:17:02] and he was looking right at me so I mean
[1:17:04] he know he knows I'll standing
[1:17:07] there and I thought hm and I brothers
[1:17:11] and sisters this is the truth it felt
[1:17:14] like someone grabbed my collar and took
[1:17:16] me up there just like that I did not
[1:17:19] walk up there on my own God brought me
[1:17:23] up
[1:17:24] there he led me up there cuz there was
[1:17:27] something down in here that seed that he
[1:17:30] had placed all right before time like I
[1:17:32] told you before time he had placed that
[1:17:35] seed down in here and he drew me to
[1:17:39] him you know the Bible says like I said
[1:17:43] ye have not chosen me but
[1:17:47] I our Lord and savior have chosen you
[1:17:51] and that's what he was doing he was
[1:17:53] making that that pull in my heart and I
[1:17:57] walked up there and you know to say
[1:18:00] something before that I thought
[1:18:01] everything was good young people I
[1:18:04] thought everything was nice I had a car
[1:18:07] I had a job was making pretty good money
[1:18:09] I had a girlfriend who was beautiful you
[1:18:12] know I was surfing what I love to do
[1:18:14] things were good what do I I don't need
[1:18:17] anything else I didn't need anything
[1:18:18] else every I was happy as could I
[1:18:20] thought I was happy let's put it that
[1:18:22] way in myself I thought I was
[1:18:25] happy but when I went up there and knelt
[1:18:30] down and gave my heart to the Lord there
[1:18:33] was a happiness that I never ever ever
[1:18:35] felt in my
[1:18:37] life something came down into my heart I
[1:18:40] didn't at the time again I I didn't know
[1:18:43] who Jesus was I had no idea what it was
[1:18:46] all about I had never even read the Old
[1:18:48] Testament I hardly ever read the the old
[1:18:50] excuse me the New Testament I hardly
[1:18:52] ever read the old test Testament you
[1:18:53] know I'd go to Sabbath school and they
[1:18:55] would read the Torah what it's called in
[1:18:57] the Jewish religion the
[1:18:59] Torah I didn't really want anything to
[1:19:01] do with it you know so but I felt a
[1:19:04] happiness in my heart and I remember
[1:19:07] driving back to San Diego from
[1:19:11] Ventura I mean I was I was singing a
[1:19:13] song I was singing some of these songs I
[1:19:15] really didn't even know what I was
[1:19:16] singing about but it was just something
[1:19:18] I was glorifying
[1:19:20] God and I picked up a hitchhiker and I
[1:19:23] remember that whole way about 100 miles
[1:19:24] I was telling this man you know this
[1:19:27] Jesus this happy and he I I didn't know
[1:19:30] what I was talking about I had no idea
[1:19:32] but there was something coming out of me
[1:19:34] hallelujah amen and he uh I think I
[1:19:38] always wondered what happened to that
[1:19:39] man because he got out of the car and he
[1:19:40] goes well well thank
[1:19:44] you so I don't know I would have loved
[1:19:46] to see whatever you never know brother
[1:19:48] who you're going to touch what you're
[1:19:50] going to say to somebody you know we are
[1:19:52] an influence to
[1:19:54] somebody you know as a deacon I've I've
[1:19:57] many times I've walked into our church
[1:19:59] and I've had our brother Don Wilson
[1:20:02] who's been a deacon in that church for
[1:20:03] 50
[1:20:05] years and he's in his 80s now but he
[1:20:07] still stands at his post of
[1:20:10] Duty many a time I've walking in and
[1:20:12] he's shaking my hand he says brother
[1:20:14] Lord bless you and that just alone
[1:20:17] changed my day you don't know what you
[1:20:20] can say to somebody or you can portray
[1:20:24] to somebody but you're an influence to
[1:20:27] somebody you think people aren't
[1:20:29] watching you they're watching you amen
[1:20:31] you know the one I want to say this the
[1:20:33] one sister I live at the one sister I
[1:20:35] believe she sits right over here and she
[1:20:36] plays the
[1:20:37] tambourine and uh last time I was here
[1:20:41] she was touring and she was going around
[1:20:43] the church and I thought man I want to
[1:20:45] get up with her and do that I want to
[1:20:47] have that freedom that I can do that
[1:20:50] sometimes I think we get so starchy and
[1:20:53] so like we we we don't let God move in
[1:20:56] our lives let him move brothers and
[1:20:58] sisters God's wanting to move he's
[1:21:01] wanting to talk to you he's wanting to
[1:21:04] guide you he's wanting to give you the
[1:21:07] desires of your heart let him do that
[1:21:10] let him have his way on your
[1:21:12] life
[1:21:14] so they they asked me the the group that
[1:21:17] I was my friend that was up there he
[1:21:19] asked me he says they asked me to come
[1:21:21] and move the uh Ventura excuse me and be
[1:21:26] a be a part of their Community you know
[1:21:28] live with them and start going to the
[1:21:30] Bible studies and stuff so I said yeah
[1:21:32] that sounds good I mean I I thought yeah
[1:21:35] so I I moved up there to Ventura and I
[1:21:39] stayed with them and we would they would
[1:21:41] I would go to the Bible studies and they
[1:21:43] would and they would go to the uh on
[1:21:45] Sundays they would uh go to their most
[1:21:48] of them were house meetings they didn't
[1:21:49] really have a a church to go to but it
[1:21:51] was house meetings and there was was a
[1:21:52] man that would preach and talk about the
[1:21:54] Lord and and so I had gone back I had
[1:21:58] come down to San Diego to see Marcy and
[1:22:01] she would come up once in a while and we
[1:22:02] were still you know we were still I was
[1:22:05] away but we were still we still loved
[1:22:07] each other how she can say it and so I
[1:22:12] had come down to San Diego and there was
[1:22:15] another friend of mine his name was
[1:22:17] Larry Holland and sister lesie knew
[1:22:20] Larry and Heidi Holland very well
[1:22:24] and he had gotten saved and again I was
[1:22:27] still trying still learning who Jesus
[1:22:30] Christ
[1:22:31] was I still didn't you know I I was just
[1:22:34] trying to the concept of the crucifixion
[1:22:36] and the blood of of God and how we were
[1:22:39] how we're Sinners born shaped in
[1:22:41] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[1:22:43] you know you wonder I didn't do anything
[1:22:46] wrong no but we were born into Humanity
[1:22:48] that's right that's just the way it is
[1:22:51] and that's you know I I didn't I didn't
[1:22:53] do anything wrong but it was it was
[1:22:55] started in the Garden of Eden when that
[1:22:57] m one one lie was said Satan told him
[1:23:01] her got her to believe one lie and
[1:23:03] that's all it takes guard yourself
[1:23:06] brothers and sisters guard yourself from
[1:23:08] that lie stay in this word right here
[1:23:12] stay in this word say what our our
[1:23:14] messenger of the hour has talked about
[1:23:15] because everything he says is this and
[1:23:18] everything that's this is what he has
[1:23:19] said amen there is no difference amen I
[1:23:23] learned how to be a Christian because of
[1:23:26] our messenger amen amen I learned how to
[1:23:30] serve God because of our messenger am he
[1:23:33] was my great teacher that's right not
[1:23:36] not not this man right but the logos of
[1:23:40] God Jesus Christ in the man amen he was
[1:23:45] a man just like us he had to be saved he
[1:23:47] talks about when he went to California
[1:23:49] and he wanted to be a cowboy all right
[1:23:51] and then God got a hold of him he was
[1:23:53] born in sin shaped iniquity come in the
[1:23:55] world speaking lies that's right but he
[1:23:58] had a special
[1:23:59] place God was keeping him for a special
[1:24:02] thing God was going to be that was going
[1:24:04] to be mouth God's mouthpiece right
[1:24:07] there and I learned I've learned and I'm
[1:24:09] still learning every day I read this
[1:24:11] read this this these book or read the
[1:24:14] books and hear the tapes I learned stuff
[1:24:16] every day so I had gone down to San
[1:24:19] Diego and this friend of mine says I
[1:24:22] want you to meet
[1:24:24] somebody I said okay and so he
[1:24:28] introduced me to Brother David and David
[1:24:31] had given his heart to the Lord probably
[1:24:32] a year or two
[1:24:33] before and uh we know David's testimony
[1:24:37] how he was brought up in a Catholic uh
[1:24:39] his parents are very uh Stark Catholic
[1:24:43] people and that's how he was brought up
[1:24:45] he I know his testimony talks about his
[1:24:48] you know being in the church in the
[1:24:49] Catholic church and doing the things
[1:24:50] that he did as an altar boy and
[1:24:52] and those things and uh that that was
[1:24:54] brother David's testimony and so I met
[1:24:57] Brother David and
[1:24:59] uh he would they had a little house over
[1:25:02] it was on Adam Street I believe it was
[1:25:05] and
[1:25:07] uh that changed my
[1:25:10] life I talked sat down and talked to
[1:25:13] David you know gifts and callings are
[1:25:16] without repentance exactly right now
[1:25:18] this is a man that had just a few maybe
[1:25:21] a few a couple years before had given
[1:25:23] his heart to the Lord but there was a
[1:25:25] calling in his life there was a gift in
[1:25:28] this man's life this is your pastor
[1:25:30] talking about now I know David sometimes
[1:25:32] goes well don't I don't need anything no
[1:25:35] there was a gift there and that gift was
[1:25:37] being worked in his life that's right
[1:25:39] and and that was Jesus Christ working in
[1:25:41] his life Hallelujah talking through
[1:25:43] David that's right and I remember I sat
[1:25:46] there in that room in the in in the
[1:25:49] front room at Adam Street and David
[1:25:51] started to talk to me
[1:25:53] and that gift got to working and he got
[1:25:56] to tell me some things that nobody knew
[1:25:59] and I just I remember I went out of
[1:26:03] there he says you know brother Bill he
[1:26:05] says there's more to being a Christian
[1:26:07] than the
[1:26:08] weekends there's more to be a Christian
[1:26:11] than being a Sunday Christian there's
[1:26:13] more to be than being a Wednesday
[1:26:15] Christian it's an every day
[1:26:17] 247 affair with God every day should be
[1:26:21] your Sunday
[1:26:22] every day every day you get up in the
[1:26:24] morning should be the resurrection
[1:26:26] morning I need to thank God for that and
[1:26:30] he told me he says there's more to
[1:26:32] living just you there's more to it and
[1:26:36] he says it's a it's a daily Affair and I
[1:26:39] sat there and listened to this man I
[1:26:41] thought wow and again I'm 19 years old
[1:26:45] and brother David's probably was
[1:26:47] 22 but he's telling me things that I'm
[1:26:50] thinking oh my goodness you know there's
[1:26:52] more to
[1:26:53] it and so then he says you know would
[1:26:56] you like to come and move with move in
[1:26:58] with me move in with us down here in San
[1:27:00] Diego and something just went inide says
[1:27:03] yes I would like that I like it i' like
[1:27:05] to have more of what you got so I went
[1:27:08] back up to up to Ventura California and
[1:27:11] I told those folks I was moving of
[1:27:13] course they didn't like that you know
[1:27:14] there's someone was a proc slighting
[1:27:15] there one of their boys you know and but
[1:27:18] uh God was moving in my
[1:27:20] life and uh again still trying to figure
[1:27:23] out everything and trying to know who
[1:27:25] Jesus was and and I was I was learning
[1:27:28] more and more all the time the more I
[1:27:29] read and the and we hadn't heard the
[1:27:31] message yet hadn't even heard it it was
[1:27:34] just it was just the
[1:27:35] Bible and so we move I moved in with
[1:27:38] David and there was a there was quite a
[1:27:40] few of us I think there was 20 of us and
[1:27:42] we had three different houses and and I
[1:27:44] was in the in the main house and I'll
[1:27:47] tell you something funny is when I
[1:27:49] walked into that house and uh it was a
[1:27:52] two-story house and the and the uh uh
[1:27:56] the sound in there was uh really nice
[1:27:59] and all a sudden I David had incense
[1:28:02] going and uh con
[1:28:05] uh korian chant music and I walked in I
[1:28:09] went
[1:28:12] wow this is
[1:28:15] heaven and it was just it was it was
[1:28:18] pretty good it was pretty funny and then
[1:28:19] of course David you know was doing the
[1:28:22] best he could because this being a he
[1:28:24] was a young man too yeah and he was
[1:28:26] learning more about the Lord and about
[1:28:28] God we all were he wasn't a newbie like
[1:28:31] I was but he was still learning we learn
[1:28:33] every day every day we you know it's
[1:28:36] like my you know as you as you know as
[1:28:38] you're as as dads and as you get older
[1:28:40] you say you always you you know that you
[1:28:42] don't think you knew as much as you
[1:28:43] thought you knew you know when you're
[1:28:45] young you think you know it all and you
[1:28:46] think you have it all but put together
[1:28:48] but I know my dad now I look back at he
[1:28:50] was a pretty smart guy right you know he
[1:28:52] really knew and he was a real influence
[1:28:54] on my life and uh I loved my dad and and
[1:28:59] so I moved in with Brother David and we
[1:29:01] we uh we'd get together and have
[1:29:04] fellowship and then Marcy would uh she
[1:29:06] would course she'd come over and she was
[1:29:08] happy because now I've given my heart to
[1:29:10] the Lord and things had changed and and
[1:29:13] uh and David says you know he says uh
[1:29:19] give everything to the Lord give
[1:29:20] everything to God and God will add to
[1:29:22] you he knows your ways he knows who you
[1:29:25] are so we kind of broke off our our our
[1:29:30] boyfriend girlfriend situation because
[1:29:32] we were trying to to know more about
[1:29:36] Jesus and so we had a brother a man come
[1:29:40] by and I don't know some of the stuff
[1:29:43] with Brother David but this man had come
[1:29:46] by and he started telling us about the
[1:29:48] prophet of
[1:29:50] God and uh
[1:29:52] he say yeah there's this there's this
[1:29:54] man you got he's a preacher and you got
[1:29:56] to listen to him you got to hear what he
[1:29:57] has to say because he's it's marvelous
[1:30:01] so all of a sudden I'm still trying to
[1:30:03] learn who Jesus was now there's a
[1:30:05] prophet involved and I'm just going wow
[1:30:08] what is this what's this all
[1:30:10] about so we went up to we were we got
[1:30:14] together and we went up to a little
[1:30:16] place uh outside of San Diego a little
[1:30:18] ranch type home and and the first tape
[1:30:21] one of the first tapes that we heard was
[1:30:23] choosing of a
[1:30:24] bride which most of you have probably
[1:30:27] heard and here we are living in San
[1:30:29] Diego and we felt the ground
[1:30:32] shaking I mean literally I we thought I
[1:30:36] thought when we walked outside I was
[1:30:37] like we were like walking softly because
[1:30:39] we thought it was going to fall in you
[1:30:42] know and so I mean it was a couple
[1:30:45] months there it was and so all of a
[1:30:48] sudden Brother
[1:30:49] David you know we brother David would
[1:30:52] would would think of some of these
[1:30:54] things but we we he just didn't just do
[1:30:57] it we would talk about it as a
[1:30:59] group and he says we're
[1:31:02] moving we're going to move out of
[1:31:05] California well where we going we says
[1:31:07] well Montana we're thinking about going
[1:31:09] to Montana we all discuss it and the
[1:31:11] reason we picked Montana because it's
[1:31:13] one of the largest states in our in the
[1:31:15] nation but with less people so we just
[1:31:17] figured that was a good place to go so
[1:31:21] he called brother uh borders Roy borders
[1:31:25] who was very close to brother B most
[1:31:26] you've heard his name on the tapes and
[1:31:28] he says brother Roy he says we're we're
[1:31:31] some young people and we've heard the
[1:31:33] message of the
[1:31:34] hour and um we're going to move to
[1:31:38] Montana is there anybody up there in
[1:31:41] Montana that is is believes this message
[1:31:46] and he says well there is a brother up
[1:31:47] there brother Rodney of enoi he said he
[1:31:50] has a ranch up there and he I've been up
[1:31:52] there hunting with him before and good
[1:31:55] good man good brother he loves the the
[1:31:58] Lord he loves this message so if you can
[1:32:02] imagine we we had we had we purchased a
[1:32:06] bus and um my dad used to own a bus
[1:32:10] company in San
[1:32:11] Diego and he had a lot of school buses
[1:32:14] so we were going to buy a bus so I I
[1:32:17] went to my dad of course my my folks
[1:32:19] being Jewish they're kind of going what
[1:32:21] is going on on you know and so we went
[1:32:23] to uh but they he was they were good and
[1:32:28] uh went to my dad says Hey Dad we want
[1:32:29] to buy one of your school buses he says
[1:32:31] well how much you got and I said and so
[1:32:34] we've had $2,000 and this was back in
[1:32:37] 1971 I
[1:32:38] believe and he says well let me show you
[1:32:41] what you can get for
[1:32:43] $22,000 so we walked out to the line of
[1:32:45] buses and I ke I was looking at the
[1:32:47] shiny new ones you
[1:32:49] know I just kept getting du
[1:32:53] du that one he says that's about what
[1:32:55] you're going to get for $2,000 I said
[1:32:59] sold so we bought the bus and my dad
[1:33:03] goes uh my dad goes well let me let me
[1:33:06] just uh change the oil on it and get it
[1:33:08] ready for you to go and we were going to
[1:33:10] take the bus and take the seats out and
[1:33:12] make a uh kind of like a you know place
[1:33:14] where the sisters could have a little
[1:33:16] place and some some of the sisters had
[1:33:18] some their babies and and then we uh we
[1:33:22] had the school bus and we had a VW van
[1:33:26] and we had David's old Chevy truck with
[1:33:28] a camper shell on it um and we had my
[1:33:31] old truck pulling a trailer and there's
[1:33:33] about 20 of US 22 of us so we go to pick
[1:33:37] up the bus and and so I'm thinking okay
[1:33:40] and so I met my dad David I think David
[1:33:42] and Larry and I were down there we went
[1:33:44] down to get the school bus and and I
[1:33:46] knew which best it was remember the
[1:33:48] number you know so I walked over he says
[1:33:49] no no no no no no he says
[1:33:52] you're not taking that one I saidwell
[1:33:54] that's the one we bought he said no
[1:33:55] you're taking that one it was up the
[1:33:58] line it was better but he says well we
[1:34:00] can't afford that he says no he says I
[1:34:02] can't let you young people go out in a
[1:34:04] junk junker like that you know over he
[1:34:07] knows we were driving to Montana I don't
[1:34:09] mean a junker but you know what I'm
[1:34:10] saying not as
[1:34:12] nice and I said dad I he says
[1:34:15] no I just want you kids to be
[1:34:19] safe that was the hand of the Lord
[1:34:22] yes and I thank my dad for that and
[1:34:26] uh so we we got the bus and we fixed it
[1:34:29] all up and uh we sold everything we had
[1:34:33] we had used to take furniture antique
[1:34:35] furniture and strip furniture and we had
[1:34:38] a lot of nice antique furniture in the
[1:34:40] house and we' we'd buy a piece that was
[1:34:42] all painted but David David knew he'd
[1:34:44] take a little knife and scratch it goes
[1:34:46] that's Oak under there he says we're
[1:34:48] going to get that and we're going to
[1:34:49] strip down so we had a lot of nice
[1:34:51] pieces and we sold everything and and
[1:34:54] we're heading to
[1:34:56] Montana and so here we go but something
[1:34:59] had happened if I I believe this is
[1:35:01] something with the bank so a brother
[1:35:04] named Mark and David had to stay back
[1:35:06] and go to the bank on a Monday morning I
[1:35:08] believe I believe what happened but we
[1:35:11] left now can you
[1:35:14] imagine there's 22 and we weren't a
[1:35:17] commune we were Christians we were
[1:35:20] trying to live right you know people say
[1:35:22] well you were a hippie communion no we a
[1:35:24] commun we weren't that at all brothers
[1:35:25] and sisters we were Christians we were
[1:35:27] trying that the sisters would were dress
[1:35:29] nice and we were trying to live right we
[1:35:32] were trying to do the right thing and I
[1:35:36] you know I always look back on some of
[1:35:38] this my
[1:35:40] testimony as and again I told you I like
[1:35:43] I like to run I like to run mountains
[1:35:44] and I've done a lot of long 20 M and 30
[1:35:47] m runs and you know up high 12,000 ft
[1:35:50] and 8,000 ft and 9,000 ft and across
[1:35:53] these
[1:35:54] ridges and I always look at my life and
[1:35:58] I'm sure every one of us can look back
[1:35:59] on our life you know as you're going
[1:36:01] this way you're not looking
[1:36:02] back and you're wondering where is this
[1:36:05] Trail going and I've been on trails that
[1:36:07] wind around and they go up and they go
[1:36:10] down and you just go but when you get to
[1:36:13] a high place and you look back and you
[1:36:15] go
[1:36:17] wow look at that trail and I've done
[1:36:20] that my life brothers and sisters and
[1:36:22] I've seen God in that my my walk with
[1:36:25] God I've seen him on that trail guiding
[1:36:28] me sometimes you just don't know you're
[1:36:30] just wondering where am I going what am
[1:36:32] I doing in this life where am I heading
[1:36:35] let God lead you we must be led by the
[1:36:39] Holy
[1:36:40] Spirit don't let some man lead you or
[1:36:43] some someone influence you that's not
[1:36:46] right young
[1:36:48] people every day you get up you should
[1:36:50] ask Lord where are we going today what
[1:36:53] are we doing today you know and it's
[1:36:55] just I I think as I get
[1:36:57] older I I I look more and more and more
[1:37:00] for God in my day daily walk you know is
[1:37:04] it someone at the store is it someone
[1:37:06] I've had people say things probably I
[1:37:09] don't know if they're Christians or not
[1:37:10] say something something and I hear it
[1:37:11] and it's just something that perks and I
[1:37:13] go oh that's you talking to me Lord pay
[1:37:17] attention be aware of what's around you
[1:37:20] be aware of where you're at be aware
[1:37:23] who's talking to you God will talk to
[1:37:24] you he talks to us he's a mysterious God
[1:37:28] but he's a wonderful God his ways are
[1:37:30] not our ways and we don't know his ways
[1:37:33] we're learning his
[1:37:36] ways but he's
[1:37:39] wonderful so we took off and and uh
[1:37:43] David and this brother Mark they stayed
[1:37:44] back you know I look back at that and we
[1:37:47] were talking about this the other day we
[1:37:49] didn't have basically any game plan you
[1:37:53] know we didn't have an itinerary well
[1:37:54] we're going to go two days and we'll
[1:37:55] meet you at this Campground and then
[1:37:57] we're going to go here we're going to
[1:37:58] meet you we left and you think you got
[1:38:03] you got David and he's leaving on a
[1:38:05] Monday so where we there was no I had no
[1:38:09] idea we just went we're going to Montana
[1:38:12] we knew kind of where we were going in
[1:38:14] Montana but as far as knowing a a game
[1:38:18] plan we really didn't have a game plan
[1:38:20] we were trying to do what the Lord want
[1:38:22] us to do of course David that gift in
[1:38:25] his
[1:38:26] life really made a difference because I
[1:38:28] know that he was listening to
[1:38:31] God so we got to Montana up there and uh
[1:38:36] uh we finally I don't even know how we
[1:38:39] all got together on the way I want to
[1:38:41] tell this real real quick in this on the
[1:38:44] way to Montana I was driving a truck and
[1:38:46] a trailer and it was like a 20 foot uh
[1:38:50] travel trailer and
[1:38:52] and uh I got in an accident and I
[1:38:53] flipped I flipped the truck on the
[1:38:56] freeway and it rolled several times I
[1:38:58] just I remember uh what happened and and
[1:39:02] I hit some soft dirt and I came back up
[1:39:04] on the up on it was in the desert and it
[1:39:06] was like 110 out out and hit some soft
[1:39:09] dirt came back up on the road and
[1:39:11] there's a big truck right here and I
[1:39:13] looked out the window and I turned the
[1:39:14] wheel and I there was myself another
[1:39:17] sister named sister Carla and Sarah
[1:39:20] Sarah gast
[1:39:22] and little girl she was probably five or
[1:39:24] six I think at that time and and I
[1:39:27] remember I brought the truck back up
[1:39:29] with the trailer there trailer I could
[1:39:30] feel a trailer on the back of that truck
[1:39:32] just whipping my truck around like this
[1:39:34] and I thought oh Lord and and I saw this
[1:39:37] truck I mean it looked like I could just
[1:39:38] put my hand out the window and there's a
[1:39:40] big semi truck I could touch it so I
[1:39:42] turned the wheel like this and the and
[1:39:45] all of a sudden it caught the tire and I
[1:39:47] just rolled I remember slow motion just
[1:39:49] and I could hear go everything break
[1:39:51] breaking and you know and we came to a
[1:39:54] stop and I'm like this in the truck and
[1:39:56] I and I was I was just I was scared to
[1:39:58] look I said you guys okay and they said
[1:40:02] yeah we're fine I said oh thank the
[1:40:05] Lord and so I the windshield in the
[1:40:09] truck was an old
[1:40:11] International and it it was kind of a
[1:40:13] flat windshield it was in you know those
[1:40:15] windshields back then when they they
[1:40:16] break and they shatter everywhere and
[1:40:19] there was a rubber around the windshield
[1:40:22] and the that was laying brothers and
[1:40:25] sisters it was laying next to the truck
[1:40:27] and it had him broken and it was laying
[1:40:29] in the rubber next to the truck there's
[1:40:32] no way that that thing didn't wouldn't
[1:40:34] not have shattered and that rolling I'm
[1:40:36] telling we rolled a couple times so we
[1:40:39] got out and it we're just we closed the
[1:40:42] freeway down this truck sitting there
[1:40:44] and the trailers opened up and
[1:40:45] everything spread across the freeway we
[1:40:48] had David's dog named Abram and the dog
[1:40:51] is big uh
[1:40:53] um I forget that kind of dog but a big
[1:40:56] dog and it was running around the
[1:40:57] freeway so we had to get the dog and
[1:40:59] we're standing there people are running
[1:41:01] up like this and so all of a sudden a
[1:41:02] higher patrolman comes and he he runs up
[1:41:06] and he goes where where's the people are
[1:41:09] they okay are they already gone where's
[1:41:10] the people and I said you know I'm again
[1:41:13] I'm 19 20 years old so I'm right here
[1:41:16] and he goes no no no no he says he says
[1:41:18] someone someone had to die in this
[1:41:20] accident' I said no I said there was
[1:41:23] myself and this lady and this girl and
[1:41:26] all she had was a little scratch on her
[1:41:28] shoulder that was it and he said that's
[1:41:32] a
[1:41:32] miracle God was watching after
[1:41:37] us God will take care of his
[1:41:40] seed I believe that if he calls you if
[1:41:45] he chose you he's going to keep you
[1:41:48] that's we that's the scriptures we read
[1:41:49] right he will keep you
[1:41:51] and your footsteps of are ordained of
[1:41:53] God so again what are we
[1:41:56] fearing don't fear praise the Lord thank
[1:41:59] the god that he's directing and guiding
[1:42:02] us
[1:42:03] so again we didn't have cell phones back
[1:42:06] then and we didn't have anything like
[1:42:08] that and so the harman told are you with
[1:42:10] anybody say oh we have a school bus but
[1:42:12] I think they're way up the highway
[1:42:14] somewhere and he says well let me call
[1:42:15] ahead and see if High patrolman can find
[1:42:18] them and they'll send I'll send them
[1:42:21] back for you so they were able to find
[1:42:23] the school bus way up the highway
[1:42:25] somewhere and they sent them back and so
[1:42:28] we we all got we we got gathered up what
[1:42:31] we could and we put it into the into the
[1:42:34] uh into the school bus and I think I
[1:42:37] started driving the VW van we left the
[1:42:39] truck was was mangled up and the the
[1:42:41] trailer was totally gone and we just
[1:42:43] left everything else there but we were
[1:42:45] we were going on God had us go move on
[1:42:48] brother sometimes we have to move on
[1:42:51] sometimes you got to some of those old
[1:42:52] things that are hanging
[1:42:55] on and I've had them you've got to ask
[1:42:58] the Lord please Lord let those things
[1:43:00] drop
[1:43:01] off you know that's those are things
[1:43:03] that sometimes will hinder the being in
[1:43:05] the presence of the
[1:43:07] Lord and so we went on and we met
[1:43:10] somehow we we came
[1:43:12] together and we were up in
[1:43:14] Montana and
[1:43:16] uh uh and we're going to brother
[1:43:20] Rodney's house I know and so but this
[1:43:22] man didn't know we were
[1:43:24] coming I mean that's the thing if you
[1:43:27] think about that I mean there's 22 young
[1:43:31] still kind of we we thought we had cut
[1:43:32] our hair short but it really wasn't
[1:43:34] short but it was from here to here so we
[1:43:37] cut I cut a couple inches off you know I
[1:43:39] thought I had gotten a good haircut and
[1:43:42] so we uh so Brother David and I think it
[1:43:46] was brother
[1:43:47] Larry uh one day they said okay we're
[1:43:50] going to go go over to brother
[1:43:52] Rodney's and or we didn't know we didn't
[1:43:54] know him as brother Rodney was Rodney
[1:43:56] vanoi and so they they show up at their
[1:43:59] show up at their front door and uh knock
[1:44:03] on the door and they're standing there
[1:44:04] and then I've I've talked to sister
[1:44:06] vanoi about this over the year last
[1:44:09] couple years or so and she's kind of
[1:44:11] said yeah I came to the door and this is
[1:44:14] again this is 50 years ago she said she
[1:44:16] came to the door and she kind of peaked
[1:44:17] out this is these are ranchers these are
[1:44:20] people that that all they do is they
[1:44:21] raise cattle they have a ranch so
[1:44:25] they're they don't live in a big city
[1:44:27] you know they're out in the middle of
[1:44:28] the Montana
[1:44:29] mountains and she said she came to the
[1:44:31] door and looked out and she goes well
[1:44:32] there was a couple hippies
[1:44:35] out at the front door and she says well
[1:44:38] can I help you she yeah we're here to
[1:44:40] see uh Rodney of inoi well okay can I
[1:44:44] tell them what it's about and he says
[1:44:47] well Roy borders brother Roy borders
[1:44:49] told us that that he was a man that
[1:44:52] believed this
[1:44:54] message and this is we we were coming
[1:44:58] we're moving to
[1:45:00] Montana and so he comes to the door and
[1:45:03] he looks out and he goes yes can I help
[1:45:05] and Brother David Goes we just come out
[1:45:07] of
[1:45:08] [Laughter]
[1:45:15] Sodom that's Brother David right amen
[1:45:19] thank you brother David
[1:45:22] we just came out of Sodom and he goes
[1:45:24] well brother sodom's just right down
[1:45:27] here so anyway we got to they took us in
[1:45:32] lovely people I don't know if any of you
[1:45:34] ever met them but just absolutely lovely
[1:45:37] people and they cooked for us and and
[1:45:40] gave us work and and different things
[1:45:42] and we worked there and we were living
[1:45:44] in the the campground and so um let me
[1:45:49] just
[1:45:52] so we uh uh I decided Well you know if
[1:45:57] we're going to move here I mean we got
[1:45:59] to go to work I I just I was I was
[1:46:01] raised up that way I said I just can't
[1:46:03] stand around and I don't mean you know
[1:46:05] kind of pull off somebody else but I
[1:46:07] figured well I got to go to work we got
[1:46:09] to go do something so I drove up to a
[1:46:11] little town called C Lake
[1:46:13] Montana and uh I was going to get a job
[1:46:16] I fig okay I'm going get a job that'll
[1:46:17] help the Cause right and so I I I went
[1:46:22] up there and again just the leading of
[1:46:25] God you know I talk about that trail you
[1:46:27] know as you look back you just see God's
[1:46:29] hand in it you see God's hand and moving
[1:46:32] you and uh you
[1:46:34] know have I always stayed on the trail
[1:46:38] no I don't think any of us can say that
[1:46:40] we've always stayed on that trail we've
[1:46:43] tried but uh there's a thing called I
[1:46:46] don't know if you know some of your
[1:46:47] brothers know about
[1:46:48] bushwacking and that's when you you get
[1:46:50] off the trail and you start cutting
[1:46:52] trying to cut your own trail and I've
[1:46:55] tried that brothers and sisters it's not
[1:46:58] good and I've gotten off the trail a few
[1:47:00] times and you can call it backsliding or
[1:47:02] whatever you want to call it I never did
[1:47:04] anything bad but you know you get away
[1:47:05] from God a little bit in the presence of
[1:47:07] the
[1:47:08] Lord and uh and you try to make your own
[1:47:12] way and I've done that but you know what
[1:47:15] I've gotten stuck so many times in
[1:47:17] thorns and stuff and I come out of that
[1:47:18] I got stickers all over me I said why
[1:47:20] and the world that I want to go on try
[1:47:22] to make my own trail and there's a
[1:47:23] perfectly good trail right here you
[1:47:27] know and
[1:47:29] uh done that a few times and I thank the
[1:47:31] Lord that he's always brought me back to
[1:47:33] that trail amen he's always he's kept
[1:47:36] that seed he's going to watch over that
[1:47:39] seed all right he's going to keep that
[1:47:41] seed and he's going to watch over it and
[1:47:43] he's going to nourish it he wants it to
[1:47:45] grow and we want it to
[1:47:47] grow and so I went up there to to Sea
[1:47:51] Lake
[1:47:52] Montana and uh I I went into the little
[1:47:56] store co-ops or a little teen town I
[1:47:58] think there was 500 people in the town
[1:47:59] it's a little Sawmill town and and uh I
[1:48:03] walked in the store and I I said again I
[1:48:06] had uh I think by then I had cut my hair
[1:48:09] uh I had Marcy had given me a haircut
[1:48:11] and I was short and and again we weren't
[1:48:14] boyfriend and girlfriend we had kind of
[1:48:16] separated our our our our our our
[1:48:19] relationship at that time time and we
[1:48:20] were just trying to serve the Lord do
[1:48:22] the right thing and uh I walked into the
[1:48:26] store and I said uh uh do you have any
[1:48:31] work and no we don't we don't have any
[1:48:33] work we're you know it's a small town
[1:48:35] and pretty much everybody does you know
[1:48:38] who lives here has to work in these
[1:48:39] store Little Stores there's only a
[1:48:40] couple stores I think two stores and one
[1:48:42] maybe two gas stations and there's no
[1:48:45] stop lights I mean if you go through
[1:48:46] there and blink you'll miss it and uh so
[1:48:49] I remember walking out on the and
[1:48:51] sitting down on the stool outside the
[1:48:55] co-op and uh I said
[1:48:57] Lord I said uh and I just you know again
[1:49:01] I just trusted the Lord enough I didn't
[1:49:03] know a whole lot I was still again I was
[1:49:05] trying to learn about Jesus and now I'm
[1:49:08] learning about the message of the hour
[1:49:09] and I'm trying to put see how the two
[1:49:12] come together didn't really have a
[1:49:14] revelation of who brother Brandon was at
[1:49:16] that time I just knew there was
[1:49:17] something different about that voice
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] when I heard that voice there was just
[1:49:23] something that that did something down
[1:49:25] in my heart when I heard his voice when
[1:49:26] he said good evening friends it's just I
[1:49:29] don't know you can listen to a lot of
[1:49:31] televangelists and a lot of radio
[1:49:33] programs and you listen to those those
[1:49:36] those those preachers and stuff on TV
[1:49:39] radio wherever you listen to them but
[1:49:41] when you hear his
[1:49:42] voice doesn't it just stir your heart
[1:49:45] doesn't just make you feel okay
[1:49:46] everything's okay when you hear his
[1:49:48] voice you go okay everything's okay now
[1:49:51] and when he starts to talk and and and
[1:49:54] the Lord starts to talk through him and
[1:49:56] that word starts coming out I tell you
[1:49:59] there's nothing nothing in this world
[1:50:01] that can compare to that brothers and
[1:50:02] sisters that's life Everlasting right
[1:50:05] there that means more to me than
[1:50:07] anything when you can read or hear his
[1:50:10] voice and we have still have the
[1:50:11] opportunity to do
[1:50:13] that and so something said to me I was
[1:50:16] sitting there on that
[1:50:18] bench and something said said to me well
[1:50:21] just there's a gas station over just
[1:50:23] walk over to that gas station I mean it
[1:50:25] was like I heard the voice walk over to
[1:50:28] that gas station yes sir again this is a
[1:50:30] town that everybody pretty much what
[1:50:33] they do is you know they all work either
[1:50:35] in the woods because there was a lumber
[1:50:38] a lumber you know they cut Lumber there
[1:50:40] and they have a lumber mill there and
[1:50:41] that's this is what the town was and I
[1:50:44] remember going across the street and
[1:50:45] walking in that Co-Op gas station and
[1:50:47] there's a name a man there named red he
[1:50:49] had bright red hair ha and he was the
[1:50:51] owner of the station I walked in I
[1:50:54] looked at him I said sir I'm looking for
[1:50:55] a job he goes well he said you ever
[1:50:58] changed oil I said yes sir he says you
[1:51:01] ever changed tires I said yes sir he
[1:51:03] says when can you
[1:51:05] start God was looking out after us amen
[1:51:09] God was watching my path and so he gave
[1:51:11] me a job and I was I think the first one
[1:51:14] in the group that had gotten a job and
[1:51:17] and so anyway the the the word of God
[1:51:21] you know I could I could go on there's a
[1:51:23] lot to more to the story but uh um you
[1:51:27] know God is good amen and I'm going to
[1:51:31] read you something here brother brandom
[1:51:33] said I just read this the other
[1:51:36] day you
[1:51:39] know you need to be
[1:51:42] yourself don't try to be someone else
[1:51:46] don't try to be the preacher don't try
[1:51:48] to be Brother David don't try to be
[1:51:49] brother brother Billy you have a place
[1:51:52] in this body it's the whole body fitly
[1:51:55] jointed together right if we ever get to
[1:51:58] that place brothers and sisters where we
[1:52:00] really as individuals know our place no
[1:52:04] telling what God will do the Rapture
[1:52:06] will happen right that's what brother
[1:52:07] brandom said if we only get a couple to
[1:52:10] agree the Rapture would
[1:52:11] happen and that's what's happening now I
[1:52:14] think we're as as things we see you know
[1:52:17] time is coming to an end we've heard the
[1:52:19] seventh Church chur age messenger
[1:52:21] there's not another one to come except

[1:52:26] Messenger to come this was the end time
[1:52:28] Messenger right here am seven Church age
[1:52:31] the lady was seean church age messenger
[1:52:34] we're moving on beyond that now we're
[1:52:37] moving into a Rapture State we're
[1:52:38] getting ourselves ready for the
[1:52:40] Rapture every one of us should be
[1:52:43] looking for that should be Lord what
[1:52:44] would you have me do what would my what
[1:52:47] what is my place you think well maybe
[1:52:49] I'm just a a janitor to be the my my dad

[1:53:02] was if you're a housewife be the best
[1:53:05] housewife you've ever been if you're a
[1:53:07] school person or you go to school or
[1:53:10] whatever be the best person you know
[1:53:12] someone's watching you you're an
[1:53:14] influence on somebody someone's they
[1:53:17] have their eye on you you don't think so
[1:53:19] they do
[1:53:20] they're watching if you especially if
[1:53:21] you profess to be a Christian they're
[1:53:23] really watching you then because they
[1:53:25] want to see you slip if if they're not a
[1:53:27] Christian if they're a non-Christian
[1:53:29] they're looking they want to see you
[1:53:30] slip and they okay ahaha well we all
[1:53:34] make mistakes there's not a one of us in
[1:53:36] here that says that we don't make
[1:53:37] mistakes we make mistakes every day
[1:53:40] maybe say things we shouldn't say
[1:53:42] whatever it is God you know that's what
[1:53:44] the blood's all about amen God forgave
[1:53:47] us that there's that buffer there that
[1:53:49] blood
[1:53:50] in front of the Altar and it's a bumper
[1:53:52] brother Bram call it like a bumper those
[1:53:54] iniquities and those little sins and
[1:53:56] stuff we're not Sinners we've gone
[1:53:58] beyond that we're not Sinners anymore
[1:54:00] that's what the blood did it covered our
[1:54:01] sins we're not Sinners but we make
[1:54:04] mistakes and we go up against that and
[1:54:06] it just bounces off that's what we go up
[1:54:09] against it and it just bounces off
[1:54:11] aren't you happy about that amen amen
[1:54:15] I'm happy about that I make a lot of
[1:54:17] mistakes but brother Bram says here we
[1:54:21] notice we got so many Billy Grahams
[1:54:25] today but you see God never made but one
[1:54:28] Billy Graham that's all he and you're
[1:54:33] just as important as Billy Graham or
[1:54:36] Roberts or any of those famous men
[1:54:39] you're just as important until you get
[1:54:41] out of your place he's telling us stay
[1:54:44] in your place until you get out of your
[1:54:47] place and then you're no good at all
[1:54:50] you're you're you're a hindrance to to
[1:54:53] these men and you're a hindrance to
[1:54:55] yourself and to the kingdom of God stay
[1:54:59] in your position see stay what God made
[1:55:02] you see and then you'll operate right as
[1:55:07] Paul it's not nothing new Paul taught
[1:55:11] the same thing said if the hand shall
[1:55:13] say to the eye because I am not of the
[1:55:16] eye or the ear say to the nose I'll no
[1:55:20] no more be an ear because I'm not the
[1:55:23] nose or something you you can't do that
[1:55:26] see it's all fitly sets together and
[1:55:30] moves as one great
[1:55:32] unit and we mustn't try to impersonate
[1:55:35] anyone just be what you are amen see and
[1:55:41] that's the way God made you you never
[1:55:43] fashion yourself and remember as much as
[1:55:47] we're ministers would like to take Billy
[1:55:49] Graham's
[1:55:50] place we cannot do
[1:55:53] it neither can Billy Graham take our
[1:55:57] place see we each one has something to
[1:56:02] do a common little fell here that may be
[1:56:05] a
[1:56:05] janitor the little woman that may be a
[1:56:08] housewife the greatest Minister on the
[1:56:11] face of the Earth today could not take
[1:56:13] your place
[1:56:15] amen you God had a purpose in making you
[1:56:19] what you are and you just serve God in
[1:56:23] that way what he made you see and I
[1:56:26] think if we would just do that the
[1:56:29] wheels would RAR a little easier yes it
[1:56:33] would if we would do that not get lifted
[1:56:36] up amen and I believe that this morning
[1:56:39] brothers and sisters and I believe that
[1:56:43] we all have
[1:56:46] testimonies and I know it's not good to
[1:56:48] look in a re mirror but sometimes times
[1:56:49] to think about where you came from to
[1:56:52] look back on that trail and say man was
[1:56:55] God in every every
[1:56:57] event and all the years that I've been a
[1:57:00] Christian which now is 50 plus
[1:57:04] years I just I look back and I thank the
[1:57:07] Lord so God bless you this morning I
[1:57:10] hope you enjoyed that and I I truly love
[1:57:13] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:15] [Applause]
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:24] amen praise
[1:57:26] God you know I was speaking as I was
[1:57:29] thinking as but Bill was speaking uh
[1:57:32] just looking
[1:57:34] at the whole testimony of it just came
[1:57:38] to my heart to realize these are people
[1:57:41] that heard the word of God and they were
[1:57:45] moved they sold what they had and
[1:57:50] why because God spoke amen why because
[1:57:53] they heard the voice of
[1:57:55] God and I can even take it to an extent
[1:57:58] the reason why we are here is because
[1:58:00] someone heard the voice of God and it
[1:58:02] was moved and God came and all of this
[1:58:06] transpired we live in a time where
[1:58:09] people are moved by jobs and money and
[1:58:12] they would move for any other reason
[1:58:14] except
[1:58:15] God you know the prophet will say God
[1:58:18] will speak in sign and things they will
[1:58:20] do all kinds of things and people are in
[1:58:22] such a state that all of those things
[1:58:24] don't move them
[1:58:26] anymore oh my if we can go back to that
[1:58:29] place where you hear you believe the
[1:58:32] word because God moved upon you and I
[1:58:34] want to say this God is not done moving
[1:58:37] he moves every day he wants to move so
[1:58:39] he can do something new he wants to move
[1:58:41] so he can continue his work they they
[1:58:44] sold what they had they moved to a new
[1:58:46] place all of that because they heard the
[1:58:48] voice of God
[1:58:49] I want to do the same thing I want God
[1:58:52] to move upon my heart so I could
[1:58:54] whatever I'm doing it be God moving and
[1:58:57] doing what he promised he will do in the
[1:58:58] end time let's all stand amen amen let's
