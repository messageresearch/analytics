[24:24] brother mike to come with the psalm
[24:25] reading we all just remember our pastor
[24:27] and
[24:28] sister leslie is their way uh visiting
[24:30] his mother
[24:31] i i got a little text from my mom uh
[24:34] they she said have a good service we're
[24:36] we're uh on our way down our pastor's
[24:38] going to baptize an old friend of his
[24:40] this morning i was just i just thought
[24:42] that was wonderful
[24:44] so remember them in prayer also we just
[24:46] make a quick announcement
[24:48] there's going to be a youth meeting this
[24:50] friday
[24:51] at 6 pm here at the church so we want to
[24:53] remember that for all the youth
[24:55] this friday
[25:04] morning in uh
[25:08] first samuel 13 there's a story that we
[25:12] all
[25:12] know well about how
[25:16] king saul and the children of israel
[25:19] were facing what the scripture describes
[25:21] as an enemy that was numbered as the
[25:24] number of the sea
[25:25] sands of the sea you know and for a week
[25:28] they sat there facing
[25:29] one another off and the soldiers of the
[25:33] israelites began to get more and more
[25:34] fearful and
[25:36] would start to slowly slip off one this
[25:38] way one another and
[25:40] saul began to watch his army crumble all
[25:42] around him
[25:43] and he decided that rather than waiting
[25:46] to receive a word from the lord
[25:48] he decided he would try to do something
[25:49] religious to see if he could bring the
[25:51] lord into his program
[25:54] you know and it's interesting is the
[25:56] fires of his sacrifice are just
[25:58] beginning to die down
[26:00] that samuel the prophet comes on the
[26:02] scene
[26:04] and he says what have you done right
[26:06] it's in verse 13.
[26:08] he says the lord would have at this
[26:11] moment
[26:12] established the kingdom of israel
[26:13] forever right that would have been what
[26:16] happened but
[26:17] you know so the philistines were doomed
[26:19] they already had their dame mark but
[26:20] because of this
[26:22] he said instead thy kingdom shall not
[26:24] continue
[26:26] you know it's a sad example of what
[26:28] could have been
[26:30] but never was because somebody did not
[26:32] have the right heart
[26:34] for the lord you know it's interesting
[26:37] in first samuel 12
[26:38] just before this encounter samuel had
[26:41] given this instruction
[26:42] to saul and to the children of israel
[26:45] and i thought it was interesting because
[26:46] it ties back toward psalm this morning
[26:48] pretty well
[26:49] it says fear not you have done all this
[26:50] wickedness in selecting a king
[26:53] yet turn not aside from following the
[26:56] lord
[26:57] but serve the lord with all your heart
[27:00] and turn ye not aside for then
[27:04] should you go after vain things which
[27:06] cannot profit nor deliver
[27:08] for they are vain for the lord will not
[27:11] forsake his people for his great
[27:13] namesake
[27:14] because it hath pleased the lord to make
[27:17] you his people
[27:18] and it was just one year after this that
[27:20] that tragedy occurred on the battlefield
[27:22] and what you find is as a result it cost
[27:25] the people a total victory
[27:27] over an overwhelming enemy in a battle
[27:30] that they would never have had to fight
[27:32] if they'd have just had the right
[27:33] response to the
[27:35] lord but samuel finishes up by saying
[27:38] one other thing he said but now thy
[27:40] kingdom shall not continue
[27:42] the lord hath sought him a man
[27:45] after his own heart and the lord hath
[27:48] commanded him to be captain of his own
[27:50] people
[27:52] you know i got to thinking about that a
[27:53] man after his own heart
[27:56] what kind of a testimony is that right
[27:59] to have a heart like his you know of
[28:02] course we know it's david
[28:04] it's r it's it's uh just long not long
[28:07] after this that he anoints david and
[28:09] you know he's he's known as having the
[28:10] man that has a heart
[28:12] just like his but it seems to me if
[28:15] david was an example of one who had a
[28:17] heart i mean was a man after his own
[28:19] heart
[28:20] that we'd want to know what kind of
[28:21] heart that was
[28:23] that wouldn't we desire to have that
[28:25] same thing said of us
[28:27] you know it turns out we have a playbook
[28:29] we have a blueprint where we can get a
[28:31] glimpse into what kind of heart that was
[28:33] and that's the book of psalms psalms is
[28:36] david's daily prayer book his daily
[28:38] prayer journal where you can get an
[28:39] insight into his heart do you know in
[28:42] the book of psalms david mentions his
[28:44] heart
[28:45] 57 times and i would think that every
[28:48] time he says
[28:49] my heart if he's a man after his own
[28:52] heart
[28:52] that we would pay special attention when
[28:54] he says my heart
[28:56] and applies it to something we're going
[28:58] to look at psalm 86 this morning and it
[29:00] turns out this is one of those
[29:02] passages where david mentions his heart
[29:04] twice
[29:05] but one particular verse stuck out to me
[29:07] that
[29:08] you know just kind of spoke to me as i
[29:10] was looking at this it's in verse 11
[29:12] psalm 86 11 and it says this
[29:15] teach me thy way o lord i will walk in
[29:19] thy
[29:19] truth unite my heart
[29:23] to fear thy name you know that's
[29:26] interesting wording there that's
[29:27] one of only twice that the word unite is
[29:30] mentioned there
[29:31] but basically unite what's the opposite
[29:33] of united
[29:34] divided right so it basically means an
[29:38] undivided heart remove every division in
[29:41] my heart give me a
[29:42] single heart for what thing
[29:46] to fear not to be afraid not to be
[29:48] terrified because he says
[29:50] let not your heart be troubled he's not
[29:52] the author of fear but
[29:54] give appropriate honor and respect and
[29:57] reverence
[29:58] unite my heart to have the right respect
[30:01] or the right
[30:02] reverence for thy name
[30:05] what is his name it's his identification
[30:08] it's his identification papers
[30:10] right and he basically is saying lord if
[30:12] you can do one thing with my heart give
[30:14] me a single heart a single desire
[30:16] to have respect unto your identification
[30:18] which is his word
[30:20] the very thing that saul had decided not
[30:22] to wait for
[30:23] is the very thing that inclined him to
[30:25] have the same kind of heart as he did
[30:28] you know if you look at that how many of
[30:31] you would desire to have his heart
[30:33] how many of you would desire to have an
[30:35] undivided heart how many would desire to
[30:37] have a heart
[30:38] that would desire to reverence his word
[30:42] and my prayer for myself and i hope for
[30:44] each of us is today that we can have our
[30:46] heart united
[30:47] to fear his name so let's read psalm 86
[30:51] together
[30:52] we'll start we'll just read it together
[30:54] it's bow down thine ear
[30:56] oh lord hear me for i am poor and needed
[31:00] preserve my soul for i am holy oh thou
[31:03] my god
[31:04] save thy servant that trusteth in thee
[31:07] be merciful unto me o lord
[31:10] for i cry unto thee daily rejoice the
[31:13] soul of thy servant
[31:14] for unto thee o lord do i lift up my
[31:17] soul
[31:18] for thou lord are good and ready to
[31:21] forgive
[31:21] and plenteous in mercy unto all them
[31:24] that call upon thee
[31:26] give your o lord unto my prayer and
[31:29] attend to the voice of my supplications
[31:32] in the day of my trouble i will call
[31:34] upon thee
[31:35] for thou will answer me among the gods
[31:38] there is none like unto thee o lord
[31:41] neither are there any works like unto
[31:43] thy works
[31:44] all nations whom thou has made shall
[31:47] come and worship before thee o lord
[31:49] and shall glorify thy name for thou art
[31:52] great
[31:53] and do us wondrous things thou art god
[31:56] alone
[31:57] teach me thy way o lord i will walk in
[32:00] thy truth
[32:01] unite my heart to fear thy name i will
[32:04] praise thee o lord my god with all my
[32:07] heart
[32:08] and i will glorify thy name forevermore
[32:11] for great is thy mercy toward me and
[32:14] thou
[32:14] has delivered my soul from the lowest
[32:17] hell
[32:18] o god the proud are risen against me and
[32:21] the assemblies of violent men have
[32:23] sought after my soul
[32:24] and have not set thee before them but
[32:27] thou
[32:28] o lord are full of compassion and
[32:31] gracious
[32:32] long-suffering and plenteous in mercy
[32:34] and truth
[32:35] oh turn unto me and have mercy upon me
[32:39] give thy strength unto thy servant and
[32:41] save the son of thine handmaid
[32:44] show me a token for good that they which
[32:47] hate me
[32:47] may see it and be ashamed because thou

[51:10] lord we're so humbled by your presence
[51:12] lord
[51:13] to just great get in front of such a
[51:15] great and mighty god
[51:17] father we feel like isaiah getting in a
[51:20] temple he said that
[51:22] he was saw angels with wings and with
[51:25] two they were covering their face and
[51:27] their feet and
[51:28] the in the other they were flying with
[51:30] it and he says that
[51:31] as he walked as those angels he says as
[51:33] the walk he said that he heard
[51:35] it was just screaming out the holy holy
[51:37] holy such a holy place and
[51:39] and as they would say it it says that
[51:41] the pillar of the temple will move and
[51:44] and you will realize oh such a living
[51:47] god we
[51:48] and and as in our natural state we can't
[51:50] even stand in front of him
[51:52] and he said oh i'm so such a man of
[51:56] unclean and i'm not even
[51:57] able to stand before him but oh god
[52:01] the the says that the there was a
[52:04] call of fire that was taken and put up
[52:06] on his lips
[52:07] and given him the ability to speak why
[52:10] because
[52:11] you made a way for him to speak lord and
[52:13] i believe this morning you made a way
[52:15] that we may stand before you lord
[52:18] your prophet tells us that it's the shed
[52:20] blood that you provided lord that
[52:22] we may come even in contact with you
[52:24] because
[52:25] you are you are three times holy we
[52:27] couldn't stand before you for anything
[52:29] but you made a way that we may come and
[52:31] have fellowship with you this morning
[52:33] lord it's all based on that way that you
[52:36] have made that we approach your throne
[52:37] this morning
[52:38] and we say that speak to us the words of
[52:41] righteousness
[52:42] speak to us the words of holiness that
[52:44] your word may come and changes in the
[52:46] image of what you would like us to be
[52:48] this morning lord we want to receive of
[52:50] your throne this morning
[52:52] we want to receive that which you have
[52:54] in store for us this morning
[52:55] we don't want to hear the words of men
[52:57] we're not interested in men's idea or
[52:59] what men's thinking is
[53:01] we're interested in the word of the
[53:03] living god because that's what the power
[53:05] of transformation comes from
[53:07] speak to us oh god and just anoint our
[53:10] lips and our ears lord as we gather in
[53:12] your presence
[53:13] lord that we may just have such a
[53:15] wonderful time why because
[53:17] lord no man has ever come in your
[53:19] presence and go back the same
[53:20] lord we realize that your presence
[53:22] brings choice and it brings compassion
[53:24] it brings the healing
[53:26] it brings all the things that we have
[53:27] need of lord that's why we desire that
[53:30] you come and visit with us
[53:31] bless our pastor lord and sister leslie
[53:33] be with them lord and
[53:35] strengthen them and father wherever they
[53:37] are lord be with us also this morning
[53:39] for we ask in the name of the lord jesus
[53:41] christ
[53:42] amen amen
[53:45] amen it's always good to be gathered in
[53:47] the house of god
[53:50] let's turn our bibles in the book of
[53:52] jude
[53:53] where we read last time jude chapter 1
[54:02] welcome everyone in the house of god
[54:05] trust that the lord will be your portion
[54:06] this morning
[54:07] and certainly speak to your heart it
[54:10] says
[54:12] jew the servant of jesus christ and
[54:15] brother of of james
[54:17] to them that are sanctified by by
[54:20] by god the father and preserved in jesus
[54:23] christ and
[54:24] called mercy unto mercy unto you and
[54:27] peace
[54:27] and love be multiplied beloved he said
[54:31] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[54:33] you
[54:34] of the common salvation it was needful
[54:36] for me to write unto you
[54:38] and exalt you that you should earnestly
[54:41] content for the faith
[54:42] that was once delivered unto the saints
[54:45] also let's turn to malachi chapter 4.
[54:49] the scripture read last time
[54:52] we're going to read from verse from
[54:54] verse 1 all the way to 6
[54:56] it says behold the day cometh that shall
[54:59] burn as an oven
[55:01] and and all the proud
[55:04] year and older that do wicked shall be
[55:08] stumbled
[55:09] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[55:12] up saith the lord of hosts that it shall
[55:16] leave them
[55:16] neither root nor branch but unto
[55:20] you that fear my name shall the son of
[55:22] righteousness arise
[55:24] with healing in its wings and ye shall
[55:26] go forth and grow up
[55:28] as a calves on the stall i'll realize
[55:31] you know even as we heard wednesday unto
[55:33] you so there's a certain group of people
[55:35] that this was sent to there was a
[55:37] certain message
[55:38] as all of this is happening there's a
[55:40] designated group of people that this
[55:42] this is going to happen to
[55:44] and he says and ye shall thread down the
[55:46] wicked for they shall be as
[55:48] as ashes unto the soul of thy feet in
[55:51] the in that day that sh
[55:52] that i shall do this say with the lord
[55:54] remember ye my law
[55:56] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[55:59] which i commanded unto
[56:00] him in horeb on all israel with the
[56:03] statutes
[56:05] with the statutes and judgment behold
[56:07] i'll send
[56:08] to you elijah elijah the prophet before
[56:10] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[56:12] of the lord
[56:13] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[56:15] children to the
[56:17] the heart of the children to the hearts
[56:20] of the father to the children
[56:21] and the heart of the children to the
[56:23] father lest i come and smite the earth
[56:25] with the curse
[56:26] also let's turn in luke 4
[56:30] luke chapter 4 verse 1.
[56:34] it says and jesus being full of the holy
[56:38] ghost returned
[56:40] from jordan and he was led of the spirit
[56:43] unto the wilderness
[56:45] and being shortly
[56:49] being 40 day tempted of the devil and in
[56:52] those
[56:53] days he did he did eat nothing
[56:56] and and when they were
[56:59] ended afterwards hungered
[57:03] and the devil said unto him if that be
[57:05] the son of god
[57:06] command the stone to be made bread
[57:10] and jesus answered and said saying it is
[57:13] written that men shall not live by bread
[57:15] alone
[57:16] but by every word that comes out of the
[57:18] mouth of god
[57:19] the word that comes by every word of god
[57:22] and the devil taking him upon the high
[57:25] mountain
[57:26] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[57:29] world
[57:29] in that moment in that moment of time
[57:32] and the devil said unto him
[57:33] all this power will be will will i give
[57:37] to thee
[57:38] and the glory of them for the
[57:41] for that is delivered unto me and
[57:43] whomsoever
[57:44] i will give it what a boast they just
[57:47] basically let them know what this world
[57:49] belongs to
[57:50] it says and if thou therefore will
[57:53] worship me
[57:54] all all shall be dying and jesus
[57:57] answered and said unto him
[57:59] get thee behind me satan he said that
[58:02] for it is written that shall never
[58:03] worship
[58:04] yah shall never wash thou shall
[58:07] worship the lord thy god and him only
[58:10] well that
[58:11] will thou serve and he brought him
[58:14] to jerusalem and set him on the pentacle
[58:16] of the temple and he said unto him if
[58:18] thou
[58:18] be the son of god cast out down from
[58:22] hence
[58:23] for it is written that he shall he shall
[58:26] give his angel charges over deed to keep
[58:28] thee
[58:29] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[58:32] up
[58:33] lest doubt that any time thou dashed our
[58:36] food against the stone
[58:38] and jesus answered and said unto him it
[58:40] is
[58:41] it is said thou shalt never attempt to
[58:43] load thy god
[58:45] and when the devil had ended all the
[58:48] temptation
[58:49] he departed from him for a season
[58:52] now remember it was just for a season he
[58:54] was not gone forever was just for a
[58:56] season
[58:57] and i just want to remind you our
[58:58] temptation and everything is just for a
[59:00] season
[59:01] it's going to come where it's going to
[59:02] be an end today man god bless you may
[59:04] have your seats also just keep your
[59:06] bibles open we're gonna read another
[59:08] scripture very from reader scripture it
[59:11] says now
[59:11] faith is the substance hebrews 11 1-3
[59:15] it says faith faith is the substance of
[59:17] things hoped for
[59:18] the evidence of things not seen for by
[59:21] it the elders obtain a good report
[59:24] through faith we understand that the
[59:26] worlds were framed
[59:28] by the word of god so that things which
[59:32] are seen are not made of things that do
[59:34] appear
[59:35] in other words the visible was made by
[59:37] the invisible
[59:39] now i want to continue on the same
[59:41] thought we ministered on last time about
[59:43] contending for the faith of this
[59:45] hour we read this quote i thought i'll
[59:48] just launch off of here
[59:49] so just for the sake of time but ranam
[59:52] says in the message it deceived church
[59:54] by the world it says
[59:56] remember we are not on the picnic but we
[59:58] are in the battlefield
[59:59] many people just think that when you
[1:00:01] become a christian that that's all there
[1:00:03] is to it that's what you need to do
[1:00:06] that that that settles it forever
[1:00:10] as it says as they are christians and
[1:00:13] everything is going to come
[1:00:14] easy don't ever it says don't ever get
[1:00:17] that in your head
[1:00:18] so he's wanting us to change our
[1:00:20] thinking to change our approach
[1:00:22] to understand differently the things
[1:00:24] that we've conceived in our minds
[1:00:26] it says for i become a christian to
[1:00:28] fight to fight the good fight of faith i
[1:00:31] become a christian
[1:00:32] to get in the bottom line we are
[1:00:34] christian soldiers
[1:00:36] it says we we we got we got to be
[1:00:39] trained
[1:00:39] and brought up and know that all they
[1:00:41] know all the techniques of the enemy
[1:00:44] to know how to fortify to know how to
[1:00:47] fight
[1:00:48] the fight and we can only do it as the
[1:00:51] holy spirit will reveal it to us
[1:00:54] we cannot take what what some other
[1:00:57] nation some other nation tells us we
[1:01:00] when we go to war or some of the ideas
[1:01:04] but we've got to take our own ideas we
[1:01:06] gotta
[1:01:07] we've got to take our own ideas the way
[1:01:10] the holy spirit will direct us
[1:01:12] and when and then he says and what ideas
[1:01:16] he would give us
[1:01:18] because he is the commander in chief
[1:01:21] of the army of the christians so
[1:01:24] as we said last time we we want to
[1:01:27] understand that we are in
[1:01:28] the battle the battlefield uh uh we are
[1:01:31] in the battle as a christians
[1:01:33] we we can even say that it's a great
[1:01:36] time of testing of faith
[1:01:38] that every we understand that uh that
[1:01:41] that in this very time as we said it
[1:01:43] last time
[1:01:44] the world in such a chaos in such a time
[1:01:47] of confusion
[1:01:48] that the world is looking for a leader
[1:01:50] is looking for a savior someone to save
[1:01:52] it
[1:01:53] someone who has the solution someone who
[1:01:55] just know what he needs to do
[1:01:57] and and you can hear there's all kinds
[1:01:59] of solutions this ones are pulling this
[1:02:01] way that ones are pulling this way
[1:02:03] and i began to think even about this
[1:02:04] weekend i realized that
[1:02:06] the reason the word is in the chaos that
[1:02:08] it is is because god
[1:02:09] sent the savior god sent someone who had
[1:02:12] the solution to what the world needed to
[1:02:14] do and they rejected it
[1:02:16] and because they rejected it that's why
[1:02:18] they find themselves in the situation
[1:02:20] that they are in
[1:02:21] but random says that there's not a god
[1:02:23] always sends a warning before judgment
[1:02:26] god sent his word he revealed his word
[1:02:28] in this end time
[1:02:29] and this world rejected it god sent his
[1:02:32] son to come and die for the for the sins
[1:02:35] of the world and he gave
[1:02:36] off his own self he gave off his blood
[1:02:39] and the world
[1:02:40] rejected it you know even as a a
[1:02:43] messenger tells us that he came
[1:02:45] and he died upon the cross and he and he
[1:02:48] died for the sin of the whole world
[1:02:50] as far as i'm concerned as far as i'm
[1:02:52] concerned he died for every sin that was
[1:02:54] ever committed by mankind
[1:02:56] he didn't just die and say well i'll
[1:02:58] just cover the sins and not the others
[1:03:00] he covered everything and it was so for
[1:03:03] those that would believe in him
[1:03:06] to them that the scripture tells us to
[1:03:08] them that believe in him to them he gave
[1:03:10] power to become
[1:03:10] sons and daughters so we can sit here we
[1:03:13] realize that the world is there because
[1:03:16] they've rejected him and embraced
[1:03:18] science because they've rejected him
[1:03:20] and embraced the things that they are in
[1:03:22] and because of the rejection
[1:03:24] that's why they find themselves in the
[1:03:26] state that we are
[1:03:27] they are in and we can also say this
[1:03:29] morning we find ourselves in the
[1:03:31] position that we are in
[1:03:33] because we believe that god sent a
[1:03:35] message for us
[1:03:36] because we believe that god sent us a
[1:03:38] savior and we embraced him
[1:03:40] we took his instruction we followed the
[1:03:42] things that he said and
[1:03:44] and we realized that those things that
[1:03:46] we had received took us from the sins
[1:03:48] and from the darkness of the world and
[1:03:50] it took us from all over the places the
[1:03:53] scripture says that
[1:03:54] as he said he sent he sent forth his
[1:03:56] word
[1:03:57] and he was having a great feast it says
[1:04:00] go call my friends and all
[1:04:02] the the the people that he knew and they
[1:04:04] rejected it
[1:04:06] they refused to come to the feasts and
[1:04:08] even each and every one of them gave an
[1:04:10] excuse on why they couldn't make it
[1:04:12] oh i'm busy with this i'm busy with that
[1:04:14] and everything
[1:04:15] but it but the master said he didn't
[1:04:17] want his house to be empty
[1:04:19] that he had planned for a feast and he
[1:04:22] was going to have her feast
[1:04:23] and i want to tell you this there's a
[1:04:25] feast that's coming and nothing can
[1:04:27] change that
[1:04:28] there's a feast of the overcomers
[1:04:31] there's a feast prepared on that day
[1:04:33] and it's up to you and me to check if
[1:04:35] we're gonna be on the list but the feast
[1:04:38] is gonna happen the feast will happen
[1:04:40] because he already planned for it
[1:04:42] so he sent forth his servant he says now
[1:04:44] i want you to go in the byway and the
[1:04:46] highway
[1:04:47] and to call he said but my house will
[1:04:50] not remain empty
[1:04:51] that we will be filled and we find
[1:04:53] ourselves here because his house will
[1:04:55] not remain
[1:04:56] empty that he would call from the byways
[1:04:59] and highways
[1:05:00] he will call those that were
[1:05:01] predestinated to be part of the feast
[1:05:04] now the invitation was sent to all but
[1:05:06] the master knew who will come
[1:05:08] he was not surprised when they rejected
[1:05:10] it he was not shocked well i can't
[1:05:13] believe those people rejected my word
[1:05:15] because when he said and fall he knew
[1:05:17] that only his elected seed
[1:05:19] only those whose name was in the book of
[1:05:22] lamb the lamb book of life
[1:05:23] will receive that word and come and
[1:05:26] therefore that's why we are sitting here
[1:05:27] this morning
[1:05:28] why because we have heard a word we have
[1:05:31] heard a message
[1:05:32] we have heard a call that's why we are
[1:05:34] here this morning
[1:05:37] and so we realized as we said as you
[1:05:39] said
[1:05:40] the devil is here to challenge every
[1:05:42] promise that we are given
[1:05:44] uh but random tells us so we can know
[1:05:47] that we have to twist every promise out
[1:05:49] of his dirty hand
[1:05:50] you cannot claim to be healed and the
[1:05:52] devil just sit and look at you
[1:05:54] he will bring all the symptoms in the
[1:05:56] world he will
[1:05:57] shake you up by all the means he will
[1:06:00] try to get you to a place where
[1:06:02] you can start confessing something
[1:06:04] negative and say
[1:06:05] well i guess i'm not ill well i guess
[1:06:08] this is what's
[1:06:08] it's really not what i thought of and
[1:06:10] you can claim to have the holy spirit
[1:06:12] today
[1:06:13] the devil will shake you to the core to
[1:06:16] the place where you begin to even doubt
[1:06:18] do i even have it
[1:06:19] what does it mean do i even have it and
[1:06:21] all those things oh but i tell you
[1:06:23] praise be to god
[1:06:24] because he's giving a faith and he's
[1:06:27] giving a
[1:06:28] call of people in this end time that
[1:06:30] will contend for
[1:06:31] every promise that he's given them and
[1:06:33] there's not a devil in hell that can
[1:06:35] stop them
[1:06:36] when god has spoken it they will go
[1:06:38] after it
[1:06:40] why because they are contending for what
[1:06:42] they know god has shown them
[1:06:44] they are not containing for what man is
[1:06:46] saying they are contending for the word
[1:06:48] of god
[1:06:49] why because when god fixed it it's gonna
[1:06:51] come to pass
[1:06:52] why because if god's pocket his word has
[1:06:55] the power of creation
[1:06:57] to bring those things that don't exist
[1:07:00] and bring it into existence
[1:07:02] that's why the book of hebrews says that
[1:07:04] faith faith
[1:07:05] he says it's by faith it says it's my
[1:07:08] faith that we believe that
[1:07:10] the things which we have seen right now
[1:07:12] are made of things that don't exist
[1:07:14] in other words god spoke his word and
[1:07:17] the world come to pass
[1:07:19] god spoke his word and the mountain was
[1:07:21] god spoke his word and the son was
[1:07:24] god spoke his word and light was if the
[1:07:27] same god spoke those things into
[1:07:29] existence
[1:07:30] if he spoke a word in this end time it's
[1:07:32] going to come to pass
[1:07:34] why because it's the same god he hasn't
[1:07:37] lost his power
[1:07:38] he hasn't diminished in power he hasn't
[1:07:41] changed
[1:07:42] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:07:43] forever and his word remains true
[1:07:48] that's the foundation of our
[1:07:50] christianity we are not here as wondrous
[1:07:53] wondering
[1:07:54] can god speak to me is it really real
[1:07:57] what's really going to happen and
[1:07:59] why where what is happening in the world
[1:08:01] no his word is certain
[1:08:03] if it's an uncertain sound it didn't
[1:08:06] come from him
[1:08:07] it came from the devil when he speaks to
[1:08:09] you it's clear
[1:08:11] and it's certain and his word is going
[1:08:13] to come to pass
[1:08:16] so he comes this enemy will come and he
[1:08:19] will
[1:08:19] challenge us to the core now we've been
[1:08:23] told that he was given access to the
[1:08:25] flesh
[1:08:26] in order for him to come and so he comes
[1:08:29] and
[1:08:30] and once the faith comes god speaks it
[1:08:32] with his word
[1:08:33] he will try to work by the means of the
[1:08:35] flesh
[1:08:36] to do everything that he can to cause
[1:08:39] you to disbelieve the world
[1:08:40] because he knows that if he can come to
[1:08:43] a place
[1:08:44] where he can cause you to disbelieve
[1:08:46] what god says
[1:08:47] then he will make you powerless then we
[1:08:50] will strip you of all the power
[1:08:52] then you don't have confidence when you
[1:08:54] go before god then you don't know what
[1:08:56] to ask
[1:08:57] then you don't know what to believe then
[1:08:59] you don't know what to believe in
[1:09:00] you stay in the state of confusion and
[1:09:03] that's exactly where he wants you to be
[1:09:04] this morning
[1:09:06] so we are here with the understanding
[1:09:09] that we are contending for something
[1:09:12] we are contending for the word and the
[1:09:14] promise of god
[1:09:16] that he made for us in his word we are
[1:09:19] here because there was a promise that
[1:09:20] was made revealed
[1:09:22] or made known unto us when we are
[1:09:24] contending for it
[1:09:25] how are we contending for it we're
[1:09:27] believing everything that is said
[1:09:30] and you ask me well how do you know it's
[1:09:32] going to work
[1:09:33] and i want to just tell you this morning
[1:09:35] i know that it's going to work
[1:09:37] because that word came and took you out
[1:09:39] of sin
[1:09:40] that word brought you into salvation
[1:09:43] that word gave you the holy spirit
[1:09:45] that word gave you deliverance that word
[1:09:48] brought you
[1:09:49] healing and that same word is gonna take
[1:09:51] you out of here
[1:09:52] that's how i know it's gonna work it's a
[1:09:55] god who speaks to you
[1:09:56] daily and he walks with you he talks
[1:10:00] with you
[1:10:00] he wants to guide you and to lead you
[1:10:03] that's how you know his word is true
[1:10:05] we're not here to teach people about the
[1:10:07] bible so they can have
[1:10:09] some intellectual understanding and and
[1:10:11] walk around quoting the scriptures and
[1:10:13] everything
[1:10:14] no we are here to point you through the
[1:10:16] bible so you can become the scripture
[1:10:19] so you can become the fulfillment of
[1:10:21] what the word of god said in this earth
[1:10:22] so you can recognize that i'm here
[1:10:25] because there was already a word spoken
[1:10:29] if there was no word smoking we might as
[1:10:31] well forget it and go home
[1:10:33] it's the promise of the hour what god
[1:10:36] spoke what he spoke that's what we are
[1:10:39] contending for
[1:10:41] and i was just moved wednesday as our
[1:10:44] brother
[1:10:45] just was speaking about the purpose of
[1:10:47] the message
[1:10:48] how that he brought up these two items i
[1:10:50] just wrote him down
[1:10:51] what is the purpose of the word of the
[1:10:54] end time
[1:10:54] even the messenger of the end time
[1:10:57] what's the real purpose of him coming
[1:11:00] he he we read it and he says the purpose
[1:11:03] of the message
[1:11:04] was to turn our hearts back to the
[1:11:06] apostolic
[1:11:07] apostolic faith of the the the
[1:11:11] back to the apostolic father faith and
[1:11:13] then also to reveal
[1:11:15] the mystery truth that is going to
[1:11:18] those uh divinely revealed mystery truth
[1:11:22] are the ones that will literally but
[1:11:24] venom use that word change the heart
[1:11:27] transform the heart those are the ones
[1:11:30] that will take your heart
[1:11:31] and change it those are the ones that as
[1:11:34] you hear the word the promised word
[1:11:36] as you you see the revealed mystery word
[1:11:39] as you see
[1:11:40] the messenger of malachi 4 come on the
[1:11:42] scene those things that you hear
[1:11:45] those things that have been spoken unto
[1:11:47] you they are the ones that are promised
[1:11:49] to bring you the change that you need
[1:11:53] now jude is saying now unto us that we
[1:11:55] need to diligently
[1:11:57] that i write to you diligently to write
[1:12:00] unto you
[1:12:00] of the common salvation and it was
[1:12:03] needful for me and to say unto you
[1:12:05] and i exhort you that you should
[1:12:07] earnestly content
[1:12:10] in other words by all means with all
[1:12:13] earnest
[1:12:14] earnest and we all power with everything
[1:12:17] within us
[1:12:18] we need to contend for it now why do we
[1:12:20] need to contend for it
[1:12:22] because the devil is fighting it
[1:12:26] why do we need to contend you don't
[1:12:28] contend for something that's not
[1:12:29] contested
[1:12:30] we're contending for it because there's
[1:12:32] an enemy at every corner
[1:12:35] at every verse at every corner of the
[1:12:37] promise
[1:12:38] trying to discredit the word of god he
[1:12:40] will try to add this and try to add
[1:12:42] title to take away here
[1:12:44] he'll try to present it in a way for you
[1:12:47] to to get confused
[1:12:48] he'll try to make the word of god
[1:12:50] complicated he'll do
[1:12:52] all things so he can bring you in a
[1:12:54] state of confusion
[1:12:56] but judy is telling us that i want you
[1:12:58] to focus
[1:12:59] i want you to keep your focus on the
[1:13:02] things that you've been spoken
[1:13:03] i don't want you to pay attention to
[1:13:05] what's happening out there he said that
[1:13:07] man is come
[1:13:08] there's men that will come unaware
[1:13:11] those people that will be coming to the
[1:13:13] church and to create all kinds of
[1:13:15] confusion he says by you you keep your
[1:13:18] eyes on what the promises
[1:13:20] you keep your eyes on the reveal word
[1:13:23] that god has shown you
[1:13:24] the word of promise i was sent to you
[1:13:27] that's what you need to keep your eyes
[1:13:28] on
[1:13:29] we don't need to keep our eyes on what's
[1:13:30] happening out there
[1:13:33] it's total confusion in other words i
[1:13:36] want to
[1:13:36] just say this again it's designed so it
[1:13:40] can draw you in
[1:13:41] so you can go fight for it so you can go
[1:13:44] look for it
[1:13:45] so you can go say something about it so
[1:13:47] you can go and become one of it
[1:13:50] so you can go and in doing that the
[1:13:52] devil is bringing destruction
[1:13:54] it's trying to confuse you it's trying
[1:13:57] to stray you away
[1:13:58] because the moment you step into that
[1:14:00] there's something else that you got to
[1:14:02] go fight for
[1:14:04] it's not the end of it it's the devil
[1:14:07] that's why the bible the messenger tells
[1:14:10] us that we have to recognize the devil
[1:14:12] and every single one of his tricks now i
[1:14:16] want to say this
[1:14:17] if it's 80 of the world we don't go into
[1:14:20] it
[1:14:21] if it's 99 of the world we don't go into
[1:14:24] it
[1:14:24] it has to be a hundred percent the word
[1:14:27] or it's not the word
[1:14:32] they will uh are presented in such a way
[1:14:35] to create compassion and to create a
[1:14:38] an idea something that a man can easily
[1:14:41] justify his
[1:14:42] own senses and say well this is not this
[1:14:45] and this
[1:14:46] and in doing that division just comes
[1:14:48] and he begins to draw you astray
[1:14:50] he says that you earnestly contend for
[1:14:53] the faith and the things
[1:14:54] that has been revealed to you
[1:14:58] so he writes unto us he wants us to
[1:15:00] remember those things
[1:15:02] he says remember that
[1:15:05] that you earnestly contend for the faith
[1:15:08] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:15:10] i began to think about the phrasing that
[1:15:13] was delivered on the day of pentecost
[1:15:15] this was a group of people that jesus
[1:15:18] called in
[1:15:19] and they had left everything for him and
[1:15:21] they followed him
[1:15:22] and here he is before he departs he asks
[1:15:25] them to go and wait in the upper room
[1:15:27] and they go up and wait in the upper
[1:15:29] room and the promise of the father
[1:15:32] comes to pass in the midst something
[1:15:35] that jesus
[1:15:35] told them he says i have to go but i'll
[1:15:38] send you a comforter
[1:15:40] and the comforter came why when they
[1:15:43] found themselves
[1:15:44] obeying what they had told them to do to
[1:15:47] stay in the upper room
[1:15:48] to stay in the message to stay listening
[1:15:51] to the
[1:15:52] tapes to stay following what the trip
[1:15:54] said to say following what the world
[1:15:56] said
[1:15:57] when they were doing what they were
[1:15:58] instructed to do
[1:16:00] then the promise of the father came and
[1:16:02] found them in the upper room
[1:16:04] and there were people that sold
[1:16:06] everything and they were about the
[1:16:08] father's business and nothing else
[1:16:10] they became a people about manifesting
[1:16:13] what they had received
[1:16:16] and that's the standard that jesus said
[1:16:19] and that standard has never changed
[1:16:22] we don't get in the message by education
[1:16:25] we don't get because we can quote
[1:16:27] run him we just know exactly what he
[1:16:29] said what he said it and now
[1:16:30] that's enough for us no we have to seek
[1:16:33] for the holy spirit
[1:16:34] so we can be filled with the holy spirit
[1:16:37] and walk and be about our father's
[1:16:39] business
[1:16:40] and be a people that are led by the
[1:16:42] spirit just like those in the upper room
[1:16:45] that has never changed
[1:16:48] because people think well you know
[1:16:50] because i can just understand and
[1:16:52] i can read the message i can read the
[1:16:54] bible anybody can take the message
[1:16:57] anybody can take anybody with common
[1:17:00] sense
[1:17:01] can put some of these things together it
[1:17:03] can look and say well you know this
[1:17:05] sounds to be true
[1:17:06] and this is this and this is that and
[1:17:08] that's not enough
[1:17:09] what you need is for a comforter to come
[1:17:12] and confirm to you that's what you're
[1:17:14] reading is the word of almighty god
[1:17:17] and make it known unto you where you
[1:17:20] experience it
[1:17:21] is not just something you can quote but
[1:17:23] something that you know within your life
[1:17:25] that god has done for you that's the
[1:17:29] foundation of a christian life
[1:17:30] and that will never change why because
[1:17:33] that's how god calls his son and
[1:17:35] daughter
[1:17:35] the prophet tells us that it's by one
[1:17:37] spirit that we are all baptized
[1:17:39] it's not by writing our name so going to
[1:17:42] a certain church and
[1:17:43] doing this and doing that no it's the
[1:17:46] children of god
[1:17:47] are those that are led by the spirit of
[1:17:49] god
[1:17:52] and then god chooses to reveal his word
[1:17:54] to them
[1:17:55] so we know that the world system is not
[1:17:58] designed
[1:18:01] to make us successful christians it's
[1:18:04] designed
[1:18:05] to make us look crazy
[1:18:09] you know you you look at all the
[1:18:10] commentating and
[1:18:12] everything every time they talk about
[1:18:14] people and churches
[1:18:16] it's just like the people those people
[1:18:18] that have lost their minds
[1:18:19] what are they thinking you know it's
[1:18:21] it's never
[1:18:23] they never you never hear them speak
[1:18:26] about religious people with a kind
[1:18:28] and understanding well you know they
[1:18:30] believe in something and there was no
[1:18:32] everybody else believing something
[1:18:34] except christians
[1:18:35] that's how it's presented oh they're a
[1:18:38] bunch of crazy people what are they
[1:18:39] going to do over
[1:18:40] there you know they need to shut down
[1:18:41] churches they need to do this and they
[1:18:43] need to do that
[1:18:44] it's the tactic of the enemy
[1:18:48] it's the tactic of the enemy they need
[1:18:50] to shut down the fellowship they need to
[1:18:52] shut down they need to do this and
[1:18:54] you know you go everything is stopped
[1:18:57] you know you can't do this you can't go
[1:18:59] here you can't do this you can't do this
[1:19:01] so many things you can do but i'm glad
[1:19:04] this morning that there's something that
[1:19:05] the devil cannot stop
[1:19:07] and that is that we are going in the
[1:19:09] rapture and it's already started
[1:19:12] and nothing can stop it
[1:19:14] [Applause]
[1:19:15] and that is that we are going to be out
[1:19:17] of here and that process has already
[1:19:19] begun
[1:19:20] when did it begin when the messenger
[1:19:22] showed up on the scene
[1:19:24] god activated the process god began his
[1:19:27] process of calling his children back
[1:19:29] home
[1:19:30] and that has already started and nothing
[1:19:32] can stop him
[1:19:39] so the scripture tells us here
[1:19:44] in hebrews 11 it says now
[1:19:47] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:19:50] for
[1:19:51] just want you to stay with me for a
[1:19:52] moment and try not to be too long
[1:19:55] it's the evidence of things not seen for
[1:19:58] by it
[1:20:00] the elders obtain a good report
[1:20:03] it says that it's through faith we
[1:20:05] understand that the world we're framed
[1:20:08] by the word of god in other words
[1:20:10] there's an understanding that we get by
[1:20:12] faith
[1:20:13] that you don't get through knowledge to
[1:20:15] science or to anything else
[1:20:18] there's an understanding that comes not
[1:20:21] an explanation there's an
[1:20:23] understanding that comes by faith where
[1:20:25] god has shown
[1:20:26] something to you you don't have the
[1:20:29] words or the element to explain it
[1:20:31] you cannot use the things around it to
[1:20:34] explain what it is
[1:20:35] but all you know is i heard something
[1:20:38] something happened and that's what i
[1:20:40] believe
[1:20:41] god opened my eyes to see something and
[1:20:43] i'm not moving
[1:20:45] god has done something for me and you
[1:20:47] may not see it but something within my
[1:20:50] heart that testify
[1:20:51] that i've been changed that i've been
[1:20:53] made whole
[1:20:54] that faith brings an understanding
[1:20:58] it takes you from wherever you are it
[1:21:00] blesses you to a place
[1:21:01] where you understand what god is saying
[1:21:04] you may not be able to explain it to man
[1:21:06] but within you you know that something
[1:21:08] has happened
[1:21:10] so it says that the world was afraid
[1:21:13] that the things which
[1:21:14] are seen were not made of those things
[1:21:16] that do appear in other words
[1:21:17] the invisible made the visible the
[1:21:20] invincible
[1:21:21] is making fault visible so through faith
[1:21:24] now it says faith uh by faith we know
[1:21:27] that god created the earth the heaven
[1:21:29] and earth
[1:21:30] we know that the word of god tells us
[1:21:33] that god created the animals the
[1:21:35] kingdoms and
[1:21:36] the the birds and all the things and the
[1:21:38] order and the things that we
[1:21:39] we see and the scripture says it's by
[1:21:42] faith as we read it
[1:21:44] that the elders obtained a good report
[1:21:47] in other words the things which they
[1:21:50] were contending for
[1:21:51] the things which they were desiring to
[1:21:53] see they were able to obtain
[1:21:56] it through faith
[1:21:59] it didn't say by their strength but
[1:22:01] their understanding
[1:22:02] by their knowledge by what they were
[1:22:05] able to achieve
[1:22:06] no by faith in other words able offered
[1:22:09] up a sacrifice
[1:22:11] by receiving a faith or a revelation
[1:22:14] from god
[1:22:15] on what he needed to do now we could sit
[1:22:18] here and debate
[1:22:19] all day about how that he received it
[1:22:22] now but my name tells us that remember
[1:22:25] he said that
[1:22:26] cain he says that if all that god
[1:22:28] desired was that
[1:22:30] was just an offering cain should have
[1:22:33] fulfilled it too
[1:22:35] but somehow abel was able to hear
[1:22:38] directly from god
[1:22:40] by reading the word of god by receiving
[1:22:43] the same instruction
[1:22:44] something spoke to him differently from
[1:22:47] the same word
[1:22:48] from god coming down to him and telling
[1:22:51] him exactly what was needed
[1:22:55] revelation is god speaking directly to
[1:22:58] your heart
[1:22:59] revelation is not by knowledge by
[1:23:02] reading the bible and gathering up the
[1:23:04] what it says and everything we know that
[1:23:07] every church of the colonel uses the
[1:23:09] bible
[1:23:10] every single one of them but not all of
[1:23:12] them has the revelation
[1:23:14] of what god is requiring out of the word
[1:23:16] that is spoken
[1:23:18] that's why we needed the messenger to
[1:23:20] come to us
[1:23:21] and show us what the mystery truths were
[1:23:24] revealed
[1:23:25] to tell us what time we were living in
[1:23:27] what god requires for this time
[1:23:29] and how that god was going to fulfill it
[1:23:31] in other words it was by faith that
[1:23:33] those things would happen
[1:23:35] it was by faith that david took down
[1:23:37] goliath
[1:23:39] it was by faith that daniel when he was
[1:23:42] in the darling stanton
[1:23:44] about to be eaten up and just sitting in
[1:23:46] there
[1:23:47] it was by faith that he walked in there
[1:23:49] knowing that the same god will protect
[1:23:52] him
[1:23:52] in other words in order for you and i to
[1:23:55] obtain the result
[1:23:56] it's not going to come by our
[1:23:58] understanding or our education how we
[1:24:01] elevate ourselves and
[1:24:02] all by the somehow we've gathered up and
[1:24:05] known the secret
[1:24:06] no it's by god revealing it to your
[1:24:10] heart
[1:24:10] that how he's gonna do it and you take
[1:24:13] him as in his word
[1:24:14] and god will come and give you what you
[1:24:16] have need of
[1:24:20] what it tells us the senses were made
[1:24:24] were not meant for us to contact god by
[1:24:26] the five senses
[1:24:28] but you realize that mankind uses the
[1:24:31] five senses for
[1:24:32] everything including god
[1:24:35] if can if they cannot feel to god by the
[1:24:38] five senses
[1:24:39] it means it's not god if they cannot see
[1:24:41] him or touch him or
[1:24:43] understanding within the five senses
[1:24:45] that was not god
[1:24:46] but god made it that we can only contact
[1:24:49] him through faith
[1:24:50] in other words when he spoke he speaks
[1:24:52] his word
[1:24:53] somebody takes his word then god comes
[1:24:56] and makes his word true
[1:25:00] why because his word is attached with
[1:25:03] his face
[1:25:04] his word has the creative power
[1:25:07] his word when he lands somewhere it
[1:25:10] produces
[1:25:11] on its own what god requires
[1:25:15] so the prabhupada preaches a message uh
[1:25:18] faith uh the key to the door and i'll
[1:25:21] just read some statement quickly so i
[1:25:23] can
[1:25:23] continue on for the sake of time now
[1:25:27] we realize in the messages he shows us
[1:25:30] that faith is the key
[1:25:37] faith is the key so he says
[1:25:41] it speaks and i'll just summarize it
[1:25:43] quickly that
[1:25:44] phrase is the key so when you have a key
[1:25:48] there has to be some door or or some
[1:25:51] lock somewhere that needs to be open
[1:25:54] faith is designed to open the door and
[1:25:57] then he tells us that the door
[1:25:59] and and when there's a door there's also
[1:26:03] an assumption
[1:26:04] that there is something of great value
[1:26:06] that's been hidden there's something of
[1:26:08] great value
[1:26:10] something that is not made accessible to
[1:26:12] everybody
[1:26:13] something that is hidden from the wise
[1:26:15] and the prudent
[1:26:16] from those that will search it from
[1:26:18] those that will try to probe it
[1:26:20] from those that will try to understand
[1:26:21] it that door is there to block it
[1:26:24] but the faith is the key that opens the
[1:26:27] door
[1:26:27] and gives you access to those things but
[1:26:30] when it makes a statement it says
[1:26:32] and i'll just paraphrase it it says that
[1:26:34] jesus is the door to
[1:26:36] happiness jesus is the door to
[1:26:38] deliverance
[1:26:39] jesus is the door to uh deliverance
[1:26:42] and jesus is the door to rapture so in
[1:26:45] other words
[1:26:47] jesus is the door jesus is the word
[1:26:50] and faith is the key now i want you now
[1:26:53] to stop putting it together
[1:26:55] and for every key that there is there
[1:26:57] has to be
[1:26:58] only a particular door that that king
[1:27:01] can open
[1:27:03] there's only a particular door that that
[1:27:05] key will open
[1:27:06] in other words you cannot take the key
[1:27:08] of this age
[1:27:09] and go try to open noah's message you
[1:27:12] cannot take the key for this work
[1:27:14] and try to open uh isaiah message there
[1:27:17] was a message for this end time
[1:27:19] and the key has been given to each and
[1:27:22] every one of you
[1:27:23] for you to tap into this resources of
[1:27:26] god
[1:27:26] for you to tap into the economy of god
[1:27:29] and be able to redraw
[1:27:31] the things that are hidden for everybody
[1:27:33] else
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:36] there is a key that's been given to you
[1:27:39] to give you
[1:27:40] access to the revelation of the word of
[1:27:42] god in this hour
[1:27:43] and what it will do to you in other
[1:27:45] words the key
[1:27:46] to the rapture the key to the body
[1:27:49] change
[1:27:49] has been given to you by faith so you
[1:27:52] can go to that door
[1:27:53] the word of god and put in your key and
[1:27:56] open it right up
[1:27:59] what madam says that when he talks about
[1:28:00] the sword coming into his hand he says
[1:28:03] that what we need is a hand of faith
[1:28:06] that will take hold of that word
[1:28:08] and drive it into the enemy's heart and
[1:28:10] i want to say to you this morning
[1:28:12] what we need is a hand of faith that
[1:28:14] will take hold of that key
[1:28:16] and open up all those blessings that god
[1:28:19] has stole for us in this end time
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:24] that's what we have received the
[1:28:28] scripture says the hebrews 10 and 23
[1:28:33] it says let us hold forth
[1:28:37] let us hold fast
[1:28:41] for the profession of our faith without
[1:28:44] weathering
[1:28:47] in other words without compromising in
[1:28:50] james 1 and 6 it says
[1:28:52] for he that waveth is like a wave of sea
[1:28:55] driven
[1:28:56] from the wind and toast about wind and
[1:28:59] toast
[1:29:00] in other words yeah we are we have
[1:29:03] access we have been given the key
[1:29:05] to open the promises of god and i want
[1:29:08] to say this respectfully
[1:29:10] we don't need a new word
[1:29:14] we don't need a new something what we
[1:29:17] need
[1:29:17] is our faith to rise up this key that we
[1:29:21] have
[1:29:22] in order for us to open the word that
[1:29:24] has been revealed to us
[1:29:26] in order for us to get access to the
[1:29:28] rapture in faith
[1:29:29] because our prophet told us that
[1:29:31] rapturing faith
[1:29:32] is contained within those sales those
[1:29:35] opening of the sales revealed to us
[1:29:37] what the plan of redemption was and
[1:29:39] everything that god wanted to do
[1:29:41] so what we need is to get this key and
[1:29:44] go
[1:29:44] open a door and begin to walk in it and
[1:29:48] i want to say this
[1:29:49] to every son and daughter of god the
[1:29:51] faith that god has given you
[1:29:53] it's not so much that you need another
[1:29:55] faith
[1:29:56] that faith just needs to be raised up it
[1:29:59] just needs to be taken up
[1:30:01] to a place where just like you believe
[1:30:04] about your
[1:30:05] your holy spirit that you have received
[1:30:07] the same way you believe in your healing
[1:30:09] that you will believe in this body
[1:30:11] change
[1:30:13] that's the program of god that's what we
[1:30:16] need to hold fast
[1:30:18] now the word of god tells us that man
[1:30:20] was created
[1:30:21] in the image of god now i want to just
[1:30:23] speak now
[1:30:24] on what we are contending for god the
[1:30:27] word of god tells us that man was
[1:30:29] created in the image of god
[1:30:30] i didn't write it down because just for
[1:30:32] the sake of time there was just a lot of
[1:30:34] quotes i didn't want to
[1:30:35] read all of it now it says man was
[1:30:38] created in the image of god
[1:30:39] and i thought about it this morning the
[1:30:41] world tells you
[1:30:43] that you've come from some animals or
[1:30:45] some monkey
[1:30:46] now is it surprising that men will start
[1:30:49] acting like animals like monkeys
[1:30:51] because that's where they told them they
[1:30:53] came from
[1:30:54] whatever you believe is that's what you
[1:30:56] become
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:30:58] is it surprising that people are acting
[1:31:01] like animals
[1:31:02] no because that's what they told them
[1:31:04] that they came from
[1:31:06] but there's a people this morning they
[1:31:08] have been told differently
[1:31:10] they heard from the word and the message
[1:31:12] of the hour
[1:31:13] that i told them that they came from the
[1:31:15] mind of god
[1:31:16] and that they're going back to god
[1:31:18] they're told that in the beginning that
[1:31:20] they were with god
[1:31:22] they were made in the image of god and
[1:31:25] that causes them to act like god
[1:31:30] that causes them to walk like god to
[1:31:32] behave like god
[1:31:34] to take hold of situations to think like
[1:31:37] god
[1:31:37] to walk like god to believe like god
[1:31:40] to do everything like god will do why
[1:31:43] because that's why they came from
[1:31:45] that's what i believe they've been
[1:31:47] coming for
[1:31:49] and the word of god tells us in fact the
[1:31:52] word of god is
[1:31:53] really deceased if god says it was
[1:31:56] created man
[1:31:57] to have dominion man was not created so
[1:32:00] he can become a beggar
[1:32:02] or somebody of low estate and say oh
[1:32:05] someone who
[1:32:06] just as they seem to stumble from
[1:32:08] trouble to trouble
[1:32:10] and all just this never gets everything
[1:32:12] right the
[1:32:13] man was created to be in the image of
[1:32:15] god
[1:32:17] the prophet said that god was the god of
[1:32:19] the universe
[1:32:20] but he created the earth for man so man
[1:32:23] can have dominion
[1:32:25] i'm talking about what kind of faith we
[1:32:26] should be contending for
[1:32:28] so he says that man was created there so
[1:32:31] he can have dominion
[1:32:33] man god took of his mind and he
[1:32:36] transferred it into his son
[1:32:37] because his son was the image of who he
[1:32:40] was so when he will come down in the
[1:32:42] cool of the evening
[1:32:43] and adam has moved this and done this
[1:32:46] and done this
[1:32:47] god will just look and smile why because
[1:32:49] he knew
[1:32:50] that's my son that's my boy
[1:32:54] that's me right there that's me right
[1:32:56] there
[1:32:57] why because it was the mind of god that
[1:32:59] he came from
[1:33:01] and verbatim tells us that if you have
[1:33:04] the holy spirit
[1:33:05] you always had it because you cannot
[1:33:09] come from god
[1:33:10] and become something else
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:15] you are not animals you didn't come from
[1:33:18] monkeys
[1:33:19] you came from the image of god you are
[1:33:22] a god what you need this morning is just
[1:33:26] to raise up in faith
[1:33:28] let the same god who saved you the same
[1:33:31] god who redeemed you
[1:33:32] bring you in such a place where you
[1:33:35] begin to take every spirit under your
[1:33:37] control
[1:33:38] for the glory of the kingdom of god
[1:33:41] that's the kind of phrase we need to
[1:33:43] walk into
[1:33:45] we cannot be just tumbling from trouble
[1:33:47] to trouble
[1:33:50] always never seem to get there it always
[1:33:53] seemed like it's two more steps before
[1:33:55] we get there
[1:33:56] it always seems like we just got to take
[1:33:58] another hop to get there
[1:33:59] it seems like there's always something
[1:34:01] else we got to do just so we can get it
[1:34:03] right
[1:34:04] no if you're away with god in the
[1:34:07] beginning
[1:34:08] you couldn't change now sin came and
[1:34:11] caused the fall
[1:34:12] that man fall but even in this fallen
[1:34:15] state
[1:34:15] there was something within the heart of
[1:34:17] this man that knew
[1:34:19] something about god that would cry out
[1:34:22] even though it would not happen but
[1:34:24] there was something within him that knew
[1:34:26] this is not what i need to be this is
[1:34:29] not what i have to be
[1:34:31] there's something wrong about this
[1:34:33] picture i don't like what i see
[1:34:35] this is not what i was going to be when
[1:34:38] you see your son
[1:34:39] shaken your daughter's sickle your
[1:34:42] son-in-law so
[1:34:43] you see a tragedy come up something
[1:34:46] rises up within the heart
[1:34:48] this is not right it's not supposed to
[1:34:51] be this way
[1:34:52] something is terribly wrong what is that
[1:34:54] it's god
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:57] it's god in your calling for god it's
[1:35:00] god in you calling for the manifestation
[1:35:03] to come on the scene where i can just
[1:35:05] step right into it
[1:35:07] and speak the word
[1:35:12] the purpose the very original concept
[1:35:15] and desire
[1:35:17] that god created men for it was not so
[1:35:20] we can just come on earth and
[1:35:22] get married and have children and buy
[1:35:24] houses and buy cars
[1:35:26] and worry about how low our bank
[1:35:28] accounts are getting
[1:35:29] and our jobs and our everything and when
[1:35:32] we lose our job and do we lose our minds
[1:35:34] that was never the purpose
[1:35:39] we're looking at it from a totally wrong
[1:35:42] angle
[1:35:43] what is said is we will put the air so
[1:35:46] we can have dominion
[1:35:48] and i tell you this word of god when you
[1:35:50] receive the message of the hour
[1:35:52] it takes you a baptizer with the holy
[1:35:55] spirit
[1:35:56] it gives you the same desire that adam
[1:35:59] had in the garden of eden
[1:36:01] where he looked at nature and there's a
[1:36:03] desire within him
[1:36:04] to just take suggestion to just take it
[1:36:07] and bring it under his control
[1:36:12] and so so god created man
[1:36:17] and he says
[1:36:20] god was the god of the whole earth but
[1:36:23] man was given to be dominion
[1:36:25] over the earth he says god
[1:36:29] he created the spirit man first
[1:36:32] and he took of this spirit man he placed
[1:36:35] him into a body of flesh
[1:36:37] why so he can contact the earth that we
[1:36:40] was put in
[1:36:42] the the the scripture says there was no
[1:36:44] man to till the earth
[1:36:46] so i want you every time you think about
[1:36:48] the flesh
[1:36:49] you think about the earth because there
[1:36:52] was a connection between the tilling
[1:36:54] of the earth the fixing of the earth
[1:36:57] with the connection with the flesh that
[1:36:58] was given to him
[1:37:00] but the connection with god was not had
[1:37:03] nothing to do with the flesh
[1:37:04] the connection with god has all to do
[1:37:07] with the spirit that was put within the
[1:37:09] man
[1:37:10] so he says and and so we find out
[1:37:14] that god's original conception
[1:37:17] when he made his man was so he can be in
[1:37:19] his image
[1:37:20] so he can be in his likeness to have
[1:37:22] dominion
[1:37:23] it says and then the prophet tells us
[1:37:26] that we confess that's why we are
[1:37:28] required
[1:37:29] he tells us that we need to have a
[1:37:31] positive confession the world is in the
[1:37:34] state that retail because of the
[1:37:36] confession they made
[1:37:38] they talked about being from animals and
[1:37:40] monkeys and now they're behaving like it
[1:37:43] now listen to this in the message who is
[1:37:46] god probably
[1:37:48] says i'm only on the 6th right john
[1:37:53] it says and when the inspiration of the
[1:37:56] holy spirit is here
[1:37:58] to inspire you remember god
[1:38:01] will make your body come into your
[1:38:04] confession
[1:38:05] i want you to hold that god will make
[1:38:08] your body
[1:38:09] come into your confession it says and if
[1:38:12] you say you are drunken
[1:38:14] and i want to drink don't worry you will
[1:38:17] soon be one
[1:38:19] if you say i'm a sinner and i want to
[1:38:22] sin
[1:38:22] you will be right back into it and if
[1:38:25] you say
[1:38:26] i'm a christian i believe all along
[1:38:29] god will bring your testimony will bring
[1:38:32] you
[1:38:33] right into it why it says because it's
[1:38:36] the high priest of our confession
[1:38:38] now remember all of this is based on the
[1:38:40] fact that
[1:38:41] the world has gone forth this confession
[1:38:44] is not your own confession
[1:38:46] it's based upon the promises of god and
[1:38:49] what he called you to be
[1:38:51] so i don't care how long it takes i
[1:38:54] don't care what it takes
[1:38:56] i don't care how many times he said i
[1:38:59] don't care what sin it
[1:39:00] is all i care about is what are you
[1:39:04] confessing this morning
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:10] it says your testimony will bring you to
[1:39:12] believe if you believe in healing
[1:39:14] and you believe that god has healed you
[1:39:17] confess it
[1:39:18] god will make your body obey your
[1:39:21] confession
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:23] you mean to tell me it's about my
[1:39:25] confession oh
[1:39:27] i'm confessing about the times this
[1:39:29] morning i'm confessing right to this
[1:39:31] morning
[1:39:32] i'm confessing even this morning i'm
[1:39:34] convincing every policy in the focus now
[1:39:38] why it's about my confession and he's
[1:39:41] the high priest
[1:39:42] he takes your confession and he brings
[1:39:44] him before the father
[1:39:46] and he makes stuff confession come true
[1:39:49] why because it's his word
[1:39:51] that you are confessing so he says
[1:39:55] sitting right in the right hand of the
[1:39:57] father
[1:39:58] with his own blood making an accession
[1:40:01] for you
[1:40:02] for any confession anything
[1:40:05] that he died for and he died
[1:40:09] to read your sin and sickness
[1:40:12] as a result of sin he was wounded for
[1:40:15] our transgression
[1:40:16] he was stripped for our healing remember
[1:40:19] that
[1:40:20] have faith don't waver stand
[1:40:23] in other words he's telling you what you
[1:40:26] need to confess and what you need to
[1:40:27] stand for
[1:40:28] he continues on in the message for as
[1:40:30] the father
[1:40:32] the thing that the thing to do
[1:40:35] is to know that you are coming to
[1:40:38] fulfill a promise that god made you
[1:40:41] that's very important we are not here
[1:40:44] to manifest our own ideas i know i'm
[1:40:48] saying it over and over
[1:40:50] but that's the key it's the word of god
[1:40:53] it's always the word of god it's always
[1:40:56] what god said
[1:40:57] it says there's going to be a thousand
[1:41:01] people praying
[1:41:02] praying for you it says and you've got
[1:41:05] to come
[1:41:06] by this line and when we pray lay hands
[1:41:09] on you
[1:41:10] as soon as your hand is laid upon you
[1:41:13] you
[1:41:13] you you just like to rise up out of the
[1:41:17] water and be baptized
[1:41:18] you've done something that god gives you
[1:41:20] the promise
[1:41:21] on what would happen he that believed
[1:41:24] and baptized shall be saved
[1:41:26] you go right out of this building
[1:41:28] testify you were saved
[1:41:30] what if you go out of the building and
[1:41:33] say well
[1:41:34] i don't know then you are not saved
[1:41:37] it says but god will make your body obey
[1:41:40] your confession it says see
[1:41:43] is the high priest of our confession
[1:41:46] before you can be healed
[1:41:47] you have to confess it you have to
[1:41:50] believe
[1:41:50] you are healed and then when you believe
[1:41:53] you are healed
[1:41:54] god makes your body to
[1:41:57] your body obey your confession so now
[1:42:00] when you come here
[1:42:01] just like a settle says this is this is
[1:42:04] your commandment i'll believe i'm healed
[1:42:06] walk off the platform and say
[1:42:09] now i just want to bring this to
[1:42:11] attention i know
[1:42:12] i'm i'm bringing this down but remember
[1:42:15] this is
[1:42:16] the simplicity of the gospel of jesus
[1:42:18] christ
[1:42:19] this this is not just for healing i know
[1:42:22] the prophet is mentioning it for healing
[1:42:24] for deliverance for all those things
[1:42:26] but this applies to every promise of god
[1:42:29] in fact i would not even be able to get
[1:42:31] there but what random says this
[1:42:33] the keystone revelation of the entire
[1:42:36] bible
[1:42:37] under which he was able to even place
[1:42:39] all the messengers
[1:42:41] of the all the new of the other
[1:42:43] messengers of the church hedge book and
[1:42:45] everything
[1:42:46] it says there was one key cornerstone
[1:42:49] and that is that jesus christ is the
[1:42:52] same
[1:42:53] yesterday today and forever
[1:42:56] and he hasn't changed the key confession
[1:42:59] is
[1:42:59] what he did yesterday he will do today
[1:43:02] and he will do tomorrow
[1:43:04] the key is i have seen it in the bible i
[1:43:06] have seen him do this once
[1:43:08] and i'm believing it it's gonna do it
[1:43:10] again the key confession is
[1:43:12] i've seen it and nothing can change it
[1:43:15] amen what about him talks about the
[1:43:18] blind man
[1:43:20] john john ryan it says here it comes and
[1:43:23] he comes and he was prayed for he came
[1:43:25] and said
[1:43:26] i thought i was healed he says well i
[1:43:28] thought you believe
[1:43:30] i wonder if something in john's ryan
[1:43:33] heart
[1:43:34] began to just be lifted up i'm blind
[1:43:37] you mean i can see if i could just
[1:43:39] confess it
[1:43:40] if i could just continue to confess it
[1:43:43] it says well
[1:43:43] if it's up to me then i'll confess it oh
[1:43:46] my goodness
[1:43:47] he went everywhere just confessing press
[1:43:51] hell when he was doing this i'm here in
[1:43:55] fact with him says even in meetings when
[1:43:57] he's preaching
[1:43:58] he'll just stand up right back in the
[1:43:59] middle of the service praise god i'm
[1:44:01] healed
[1:44:02] praise god i'm healed praise god uphill
[1:44:05] somebody may have thought he's getting
[1:44:06] out of head
[1:44:07] he's getting out of place he's doing
[1:44:10] something crazy
[1:44:11] but that didn't matter to him he knew
[1:44:14] what he was looking for
[1:44:16] my brother my sister oftentimes we let
[1:44:18] the eyes of the other person just hold
[1:44:20] us down
[1:44:21] when we have need of god and we need
[1:44:24] things and we don't want people to know
[1:44:26] i need a holy ghost i need this i need
[1:44:28] this
[1:44:29] i encourage you to be like johnny this
[1:44:33] what morning didn't matter what people
[1:44:35] thought about him
[1:44:36] he had heard the word of god the
[1:44:39] messenger told him that it was hell
[1:44:41] and he believed it
[1:44:44] i wonder how many times he was made fun
[1:44:46] of
[1:44:50] i wonder how many times we are made fun
[1:44:53] of for believing in a messenger
[1:44:56] i wonder how many times people look at
[1:44:58] us those people must be crazy
[1:45:02] you don't want to say something man
[1:45:04] those people
[1:45:06] if you haven't been to one of them
[1:45:07] services have you ever seen another
[1:45:10] dress and
[1:45:11] they don't have tv you they don't have
[1:45:12] tvs not in their home
[1:45:15] they apply the talking they don't
[1:45:17] believe in short dresses
[1:45:19] no hearing you know man i haven't seen
[1:45:21] that they don't believe in women
[1:45:23] preachers oh i can't believe that
[1:45:25] they don't believe it those people must
[1:45:27] have lost their minds
[1:45:29] and so another one he goes to a barber
[1:45:34] and now we're sitting and i don't know
[1:45:36] how many times that barbara made fun of
[1:45:38] him
[1:45:39] and yeah it's just one day he just
[1:45:42] thought he would make fun of him like he
[1:45:44] did before
[1:45:45] he said john i heard that you were
[1:45:48] healed and
[1:45:49] you went to the meeting down there of
[1:45:51] the holy roller
[1:45:52] i heard you scream over and over when
[1:45:54] you were selling newspapers
[1:45:56] i heard you say this and say that that
[1:45:58] you were healed
[1:45:59] oh he said now i want you to realize he
[1:46:01] didn't say i was here
[1:46:03] he said i am healed let me tell you this
[1:46:06] when you confess it may take time for
[1:46:09] the holy ghost to come up
[1:46:11] it may take time for the manifestation
[1:46:13] but you don't worry about it he turned
[1:46:15] away
[1:46:16] [Applause]
[1:46:18] and as he was about to make fun of him
[1:46:20] just one more time
[1:46:21] his eyes came open
[1:46:26] who was laughing who was laughing now
[1:46:30] who was laughing there who was laughing
[1:46:32] at that time
[1:46:33] i tell you they may make fun of us all
[1:46:35] day long
[1:46:36] we will have the final life
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:42] nobody in the church oh let's go to that
[1:46:44] one's home
[1:46:45] nobody's in there oh let's look over
[1:46:48] here nobody said
[1:46:49] who will have the last laugh i tell you
[1:46:51] the word of god will come to pass
[1:46:54] you keep confessing the positive you
[1:46:57] keep believing this message
[1:46:59] god will bring his word to come
[1:47:09] we avoid the the
[1:47:12] people making fun we we want to shy away
[1:47:17] we avoid the negative that comes with
[1:47:20] it we avoid i'm just looking for the
[1:47:23] right word
[1:47:24] the the the challenge and the pain and
[1:47:27] and the trials that comes with believing
[1:47:29] something
[1:47:30] everything you believe it comes with a
[1:47:32] challenge
[1:47:33] we just said everything that you believe
[1:47:36] comes with a ridicule
[1:47:37] there's something that the devil wants
[1:47:39] to read the cue there's something about
[1:47:41] us that's just
[1:47:41] off that doesn't look right and
[1:47:44] everything
[1:47:44] and they want to read to kill that and i
[1:47:46] tell you what
[1:47:48] i'm saying the final showdown will be
[1:47:50] the rapture
[1:47:51] the final showdown will be to change
[1:47:53] your body those that believe in this
[1:47:55] word
[1:47:56] they are guaranteed by the word of god
[1:47:58] those that have the token
[1:48:00] will be taken out of here before this
[1:48:02] world goes into a chaos
[1:48:04] those that have believed the word of god
[1:48:06] just like he did
[1:48:07] remember the cornerstone is he's the
[1:48:09] same yesterday
[1:48:11] today and forever now i want to just add
[1:48:13] this and say
[1:48:15] now remember we spoke about peter all
[1:48:19] the time
[1:48:21] how that he he sunk how that he tried
[1:48:24] and he was drowning
[1:48:26] but don't forget peter walked on water
[1:48:29] peter heard the word come forth he
[1:48:32] believed it
[1:48:34] he believed it and jumped upon the water
[1:48:38] that's what the scripture tells us
[1:48:40] immediately when he heard it
[1:48:42] he didn't say well i know you've spoken
[1:48:45] but let me go pray let me just go find
[1:48:48] out if it's the mind of the lord or not
[1:48:50] then i'll come back no the scripture
[1:48:53] says
[1:48:54] jesus says come and he came and he
[1:48:57] walked on water
[1:48:58] and the messenger tells us when he got
[1:49:00] his eyes off of the lord
[1:49:03] when he began to look at the
[1:49:04] circumstance when he began to look at
[1:49:06] everything around him
[1:49:07] that's what caused him to sing my
[1:49:09] brother my sister
[1:49:10] let's keep our eyes on the message of
[1:49:12] the hour let's keep our eyes on the
[1:49:14] reveal word of the yahuwah
[1:49:16] don't look to the left don't look to the
[1:49:18] right don't look at the corona
[1:49:20] don't look at this don't look at
[1:49:21] anything why because the moment let me
[1:49:24] tell you this
[1:49:24] this is very key to our faith of a
[1:49:27] believer
[1:49:28] it's god who brought you here this
[1:49:30] morning we we should never forget it
[1:49:33] don't think i just washed up i put my
[1:49:35] clothes on i ate my food i drove and i
[1:49:38] dropped my car i came here
[1:49:39] that's the natural but don't always look
[1:49:42] at the natural
[1:49:43] faith says that it came from the things
[1:49:44] that were not seen that were brought
[1:49:46] into manifestation
[1:49:48] you hold the word of god you believe the
[1:49:50] word of god
[1:49:51] you believe that you are here because
[1:49:52] god wanted you to hear this this morning
[1:49:55] god wanted you to sit here this morning
[1:49:57] and that god
[1:49:58] will take what he told you and bring him
[1:50:00] to pass
[1:50:04] but i wanna ask has god lost control
[1:50:08] no
[1:50:11] just because we have a little trouble
[1:50:13] does that mean that he lost control of
[1:50:15] what's supposed to happen
[1:50:16] no in fact he let all those things come
[1:50:20] to pass
[1:50:22] so he can bring himself and come to a
[1:50:25] place
[1:50:26] where he can manifest himself we'll
[1:50:28] continue another time
[1:50:31] if the musician could come
[1:50:34] he says he says
[1:50:38] we must never say that don't ever let
[1:50:41] your testimony be negative
[1:50:43] if i can encourage you this morning
[1:50:46] don't ever let your testimony be
[1:50:48] negative
[1:50:48] let it be positive all the time i'm
[1:50:51] saved
[1:50:52] i have god in my heart i believe he i
[1:50:55] believe
[1:50:56] him with all my heart do you believe in
[1:50:58] divine healing
[1:51:00] with all my heart it says let your
[1:51:02] testimony
[1:51:03] always be always your testimony always
[1:51:07] and your thought and everything never
[1:51:10] permit
[1:51:10] negative thought to come into your mind
[1:51:13] if you can help it
[1:51:15] and then it says when it starts
[1:51:18] don't retain it well you say i can't
[1:51:22] i can't i can't stop a bird from flying
[1:51:25] over my plate over his place
[1:51:27] but you could stop it from rusty
[1:51:31] that's that's that's good see you can
[1:51:34] help
[1:51:35] the thought when it comes
[1:51:38] but don't entertain it just pass it on
[1:51:42] no sir jesus christ is my savior
[1:51:45] things it says all things are mine by
[1:51:48] god
[1:51:49] i'm going to keep it we have to have
[1:51:53] that same testimony in closing i just
[1:51:56] want to
[1:51:57] skip and just get to this for a moment
[1:52:01] but one of them talks about the woman
[1:52:03] from memphis
[1:52:04] they said that she had a desire within
[1:52:07] her heart a son was dying
[1:52:10] now but madame says that she she if you
[1:52:14] read it it says in different places
[1:52:16] that she knew how she got the son
[1:52:20] she knew that she couldn't have a son
[1:52:22] and god allowed her to have a son
[1:52:25] and this son that god has given him her
[1:52:28] went into the world and contracted the
[1:52:31] social disease
[1:52:32] and here she was and faith within her
[1:52:35] began to rise
[1:52:37] and that she went in the bible and faith
[1:52:40] within her
[1:52:41] caused her to identify herself with the
[1:52:44] shumanite woman
[1:52:45] now i want you to realize this she was
[1:52:48] able to identify herself with the
[1:52:50] shumanite woman
[1:52:51] because she knew how that woman got the
[1:52:53] son
[1:52:55] she knew that he must have been by god
[1:52:57] but
[1:52:58] there she was no way that she could get
[1:53:00] it by herself it was god that gave her
[1:53:02] and he knew that that son came from god
[1:53:05] and she knew
[1:53:05] that when that son died that he took
[1:53:08] that son
[1:53:08] and he took him to the prophet then he
[1:53:11] went and find the prophet and he took
[1:53:12] the son and laid
[1:53:13] on the bed and she knew the whole story
[1:53:16] so what she did is she raised she let
[1:53:19] her phrase raise up
[1:53:20] now remember we're talking about
[1:53:22] confession and what we're contending for
[1:53:25] so she came to a place where she
[1:53:26] identified who she was
[1:53:28] she identified how she got her son but
[1:53:31] the only thing that was missing was
[1:53:33] elijah
[1:53:34] she understood that the scenery was just
[1:53:37] perfect that everything fit
[1:53:39] but there was just one thing that was
[1:53:40] missing elijah was not there
[1:53:42] and so she began to pray and pray and
[1:53:45] pray
[1:53:46] and god revealed to her that a person
[1:53:49] was gonna come
[1:53:50] and pray for her son she rose up early
[1:53:53] in the morning
[1:53:54] i'm talking about faith this morning
[1:53:56] yeah i tell you
[1:53:57] sometimes what random says i didn't even
[1:54:00] get to it it says
[1:54:01] we ask god and it doesn't happen and we
[1:54:03] walk away well
[1:54:04] you know maybe you'll give me another
[1:54:06] time and maybe this is not my time i'll
[1:54:08] just wait
[1:54:09] no this woman she believed what she saw
[1:54:12] in the bible
[1:54:13] and it was revealed to her that someone
[1:54:16] was going to come that way to pray for
[1:54:17] her son
[1:54:18] she woke up early in the morning she
[1:54:20] stood there on the fence
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:26] i'm talking my friend
[1:54:30] she stood there on the fence i wonder
[1:54:34] how many people walk by and ask
[1:54:36] well if your son is dying why aren't you
[1:54:39] in there taking care of him and
[1:54:41] why are you standing over the fence and
[1:54:43] just standing there
[1:54:44] no she saw something and nothing was
[1:54:48] going to move her
[1:54:49] she stood there and god redirected an
[1:54:53] airplane from wherever it was going
[1:54:56] and got it to land into memphis and
[1:54:59] caused the messenger
[1:55:00] to come out and begin to walk without
[1:55:03] going
[1:55:04] way knowing where he was going
[1:55:07] my brother my sister if god can do that
[1:55:10] so that just for healing are you with me
[1:55:13] this morning
[1:55:14] just for healing so that that son could
[1:55:17] be healed but one day
[1:55:18] die how much more for your soul
[1:55:21] this morning for what you have need off
[1:55:24] for what we call
[1:55:25] upon him for god will bankrupt heaven
[1:55:28] before every single one of his promises
[1:55:30] fall to the crowd
[1:55:32] the messenger came and he began to walk
[1:55:35] it
[1:55:35] and now the scripture did the prophet
[1:55:37] didn't tell us that
[1:55:38] well when he woke up in the morning he
[1:55:40] had a vision of what's going to happen
[1:55:42] no in fact god didn't even tell him
[1:55:45] all god told him was just walk
[1:55:50] all god told him was just walk he just
[1:55:53] kept walking and singing
[1:55:55] one of them and one of them one of them
[1:55:58] he was supposed to go leave the mail he
[1:56:00] was go supposed to
[1:56:01] post the the the the mail so he can go
[1:56:04] back and catch his plan
[1:56:05] and he's aware that his plan is going to
[1:56:07] be late that he's going to miss it
[1:56:09] but god spoke to him what can he do if
[1:56:12] god can
[1:56:12] sow cut up his prophet and bring him to
[1:56:15] come and do those things
[1:56:17] how much more of the word that is
[1:56:18] talking about you in this end time
[1:56:20] i just want you to hear this before we
[1:56:23] close he says
[1:56:25] and if the bride is the word
[1:56:28] then she's got to be of christ part of
[1:56:31] the bridegroom
[1:56:32] she's got to be the word the word not
[1:56:35] for for the word not for his day
[1:56:39] the word for this day he is promised
[1:56:42] that he will do
[1:56:43] that he would do this that he would do
[1:56:46] this day
[1:56:46] and he send the word forth in the mold
[1:56:50] to mold this bride and make her hope you
[1:56:53] see it
[1:56:54] don't get some ideas of your own don't
[1:56:56] let
[1:56:57] somebody else idea take a foundation
[1:57:00] uh of the bible what he says it says god
[1:57:04] has promised in his word how he would
[1:57:06] choose his void
[1:57:08] in this last day how is he going to do
[1:57:10] it
[1:57:11] he promised his promise he promised it
[1:57:13] how he would do it
[1:57:15] how is uh it was by by his original plan
[1:57:18] by choosing christ
[1:57:20] choosing the time choosing the season he
[1:57:23] can't miss it
[1:57:24] he's right because it's part of his word
[1:57:27] he can't choose it by denomination when
[1:57:30] he didn't choose it
[1:57:32] when he didn't choose it when he didn't
[1:57:34] choose christ by denomination
[1:57:36] did he did christ come by denomination
[1:57:39] did he come by any denomination no they
[1:57:42] rejected him
[1:57:44] well that's what denomination then it
[1:57:46] says then
[1:57:47] when he chooses the bride he he came
[1:57:51] he can't come he he
[1:57:54] when he chooses the bride can he come
[1:57:56] any other way
[1:57:58] how did this how did christ come here
[1:58:01] by his word or by the words of the
[1:58:04] prophet
[1:58:05] he says is that right how will the bride
[1:58:08] be how would the bride be he be here
[1:58:12] by the words of the prophet how did he
[1:58:15] identify
[1:58:16] when he came by a man with the spirit of
[1:58:19] elijah upon him
[1:58:20] come out of the wilderness how will he
[1:58:22] identify the bride
[1:58:24] he promised in malachi chapter 4
[1:58:27] the same thing before he destroys the
[1:58:30] earth
[1:58:30] this is this day was not the day of
[1:58:33] sodom
[1:58:34] remember sodom burn right there the word
[1:58:38] the world is burning jesus said it's
[1:58:41] it's to be the time like luke 17 chapter
[1:58:44] and verse 30. it's the day will be the
[1:58:47] sodom and gomorrah
[1:58:48] then the son of man will be revealed and
[1:58:50] then what would happen
[1:58:52] according to malachi 4 he will burn the
[1:58:55] earth again
[1:58:56] and the righteousness in the millennium
[1:58:58] will walk upon the ashes of the wicked
[1:59:00] is that right so we are right at the end
[1:59:03] we are sitting
[1:59:04] at the doorstep now waiting for it to
[1:59:07] come
[1:59:10] everything you spoke there has happened
[1:59:14] what are we contending for the promised
[1:59:17] world
[1:59:18] that is being revealed to us let's all
[1:59:20] stand
[1:59:21] the promised world that has been
[1:59:24] revealed to us
[1:59:25] and i want to just say to us this
[1:59:27] morning
[1:59:29] it's simple it's not supposed to be
[1:59:31] complicated
[1:59:32] let's believe the word of god for
[1:59:34] everything within us
[1:59:36] he will reveal it to us little by little
[1:59:38] word by word
[1:59:40] verse by verse so we can have the
