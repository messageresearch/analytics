[54:47] Ephesians chapter 5 it's good to be back
[54:50] here with you this morning Amen to see
[54:53] some familiar faces some unfamiliar
[54:56] faces
[54:56] but we're all familiar in the word of
[54:58] God Amen one of these glorious days will
[55:01] never depart amen how many's longing for
[55:05] that day amen I just to get out of this
[55:08] uh as I will say this godforsaken world
[55:11] Amen and we're longing for that day but
[55:13] until then let's press on Amen let's
[55:16] press on and it's uh such a privilege
[55:18] and we're thankful for the opportunity I
[55:21] guess we did not come under the
[55:23] radar as or under the wind whatever
[55:26] whatever however Brother David said it
[55:29] uh but we're just glad to be here
[55:32] amen Ephesians chapter 5 verse number 22
[55:36] we trust that this morning we would be
[55:38] able to say something that would
[55:40] encourage you along the
[55:42] way says wives submit yourselves unto
[55:46] your own husbands as unto the
[55:50] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[55:53] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[55:55] church
[55:57] and he is the savior of the
[55:59] body therefore as the church is subject
[56:03] or yielded or obedient unto Christ so
[56:07] let the wives be to their own husbands
[56:09] in
[56:10] everything husbands love your wives even
[56:14] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[56:17] himself for it that he might sanctify
[56:21] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[56:24] by the word you thankful for that
[56:27] word that he might present it to
[56:32] himself a glorious church not having
[56:36] spot or wrinkle which is flaw or any
[56:40] such thing so there's nothing going to
[56:42] be in this but that it should be
[56:45] holy and without blemish amen God bless
[56:49] you you can be seated this
[56:53] morning as we look into this scripture
[56:56] this is kind of a foundational scripture
[56:58] to our thought this morning our thought
[57:01] would be a charge to clear the
[57:04] land a charge to clear the land now I I
[57:09] want to take one word here just real
[57:11] quick in verse 27 that he might present
[57:14] so the word present uh however you would
[57:17] want to say it in the Greek uh parisy or
[57:21] pisty which is to bring into one's
[57:24] fellowship or into iny that he might
[57:28] present it to himself so his desire is
[57:31] to bring into fellowship or an an
[57:35] intimate relationship so he is wanting
[57:37] to bring you not into such as a
[57:40] religion or into a uh just an idea that
[57:43] he might present it to himself a
[57:46] glorious
[57:48] church so if we can build a foundation
[57:52] on this one of my favorite and and I
[57:54] hate to use the word favorite my
[57:55] goodness it's a human human word because
[57:57] there is not such a thing as a favorite
[57:59] but I will just say an exciting quote
[58:02] for me as of right now I just I build
[58:04] upon this so much is in Christ is the
[58:07] mystery of God paragraph 240 says the
[58:10] new birth is Christ is a
[58:14] revelation says God has revealed to you
[58:18] now you have to accept this for yourself
[58:20] this great mystery so thus it's no
[58:23] longer a mystery to you and that's a new
[58:25] birth birth says now what are you going
[58:28] to do now think about this what are you
[58:31] going to do when you get all that group
[58:36] together where the Revelation is
[58:38] perfectly in Harmony and God expressing
[58:43] it through his word Capital word by the
[58:47] same actions the same things that he did
[58:51] making the word manifest now think about
[58:54] it it's not so it's not just saying
[58:56] this group and that group and that group
[58:58] but we're talking about the entirety as
[59:00] a whole what are we going to do okay
[59:03] when this comes together now now think
[59:05] about what's what he's building up to
[59:07] here the same thing that he did making
[59:09] the word manifest and here it is oh if
[59:13] the church now we know what he's
[59:14] speaking of here only knew its
[59:20] position it will one
[59:23] day then the rapture
[59:27] will go when it when what it the church
[59:31] the bride knows what it is now think of
[59:36] the profoundness of this thought yet in
[59:39] its Simplicity you say me you now you
[59:43] have to take this for yourself the
[59:44] church or the
[59:46] bride must know your
[59:50] position you must know your position so
[59:52] in in a sense this is simple you've got
[59:55] to understand and your position so in
[59:57] reality two things should happen two
[1:00:00] things getting into and
[1:00:04] knowing are you still with me so number
[1:00:07] one getting into which is expressing a
[1:00:10] change of
[1:00:12] circumstance so this is an action on a
[1:00:15] person's part so you have something that
[1:00:18] you've got to do all right so getting
[1:00:21] into so this is an action on your part
[1:00:24] number two is knowing so a knowing is
[1:00:27] showing or suggesting that one has
[1:00:31] knowledge or
[1:00:34] awareness that is secret or known to
[1:00:38] only a few
[1:00:40] people having
[1:00:44] intelligence or keenly
[1:00:47] alert now when you think of
[1:00:50] intelligence what type of intelligence
[1:00:52] are you thinking of I don't want you to
[1:00:54] just think of the intellig of the mind I
[1:00:56] want you to think of the
[1:00:58] intelligence of the
[1:01:01] intelligence of the
[1:01:04] army the intelligence that you know of
[1:01:07] the enemy I've got
[1:01:10] Intel so again you're getting into a
[1:01:13] position and you know something about
[1:01:16] something that no one else knows so you
[1:01:20] are getting into a position and you're
[1:01:22] getting into an action so God is calling
[1:01:25] a church search a bride into an action
[1:01:28] and by you getting into action now you
[1:01:31] are getting
[1:01:33] Intel by coming into action now okay
[1:01:37] we're building into something so let's
[1:01:38] build to this now in the
[1:01:41] scripture and your life you have to
[1:01:44] adhere to his word and it is an utmost
[1:01:47] importance right now the primary issue
[1:01:51] contributing to widespread human failure
[1:01:55] appears to a lack of follow
[1:01:57] through we all desire to follow through
[1:02:01] we go to church we hear the word come
[1:02:03] forth you're sitting here this morning
[1:02:04] you perhaps sat here Wednesday night you
[1:02:06] heard the word come forth God spoke to
[1:02:08] your heart and you said I I'm going to
[1:02:10] do it I'm not going to go
[1:02:13] back but it it appears to be that a lack
[1:02:18] of follow-through is the problem which
[1:02:20] stems from various challenges and
[1:02:24] struggles so when we begin to
[1:02:27] struggle we start off good but then when
[1:02:30] we begin to struggle we then start to
[1:02:33] compromise and with compromise comes
[1:02:37] idolatry and then with idolatry then
[1:02:40] comes
[1:02:41] weakness and then that weakness it
[1:02:44] becomes spiritual
[1:02:46] cancer then they become part of the
[1:02:49] family then it becomes our
[1:02:52] friends and it becomes our first go-to
[1:02:55] in times of trouble
[1:02:57] I'm trying to tell you what happens to
[1:03:01] our
[1:03:01] families you see we've been told to
[1:03:05] clear the
[1:03:06] land now let's back up let's go to
[1:03:10] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:03:15] 11 notice some of the parallels with
[1:03:17] today's warnings that we've just started
[1:03:21] with we've got a little bit of lengthy
[1:03:24] reading but in Every
[1:03:27] Family there's always a
[1:03:31] cancer there's always a cancer that
[1:03:33] tries to go through a family and I'm not
[1:03:36] speaking of body cancer I'm speaking of
[1:03:39] spiritual
[1:03:40] cancer and and a lot of times it becomes
[1:03:43] our friends it becomes our fallback and
[1:03:48] God wants us to eliminate it now perhaps
[1:03:51] you have the perfect family and you are
[1:03:54] the model wonderful so we want we want
[1:03:56] you to be the model of that that's great
[1:03:59] and we all H have at one time eliminated
[1:04:01] that generational curse none of us wants
[1:04:04] to think that we are uh you know that
[1:04:07] you know none of us wants to think that
[1:04:09] we're wrong but we also want to get our
[1:04:11] head out of the
[1:04:13] sand we also don't want to uh come down
[1:04:16] to the end of the road and realize that
[1:04:18] we left the cancer
[1:04:21] there do you realize that we're at the
[1:04:23] ending of this Gentile dispensation
[1:04:28] dispensation do you realize that we are
[1:04:31] coming to the end there is no more for
[1:04:35] us there is no more
[1:04:37] time so when it when it's over it's
[1:04:41] over okay I I want to I just want to ask
[1:04:43] make sure we're all on the same page
[1:04:45] here okay Deuteronomy
[1:04:48] 11:8 therefore shall ye keep all the
[1:04:52] commandments so there's no way around
[1:04:54] this right
[1:04:56] well brother Jeremy this is the Old
[1:04:57] Testament we're in the new just follow
[1:04:59] with
[1:05:00] me says which I command you this day I'm
[1:05:04] sorry Deuteronomy
[1:05:06] 11:8 that ye may be strong and go in and
[1:05:11] possess the
[1:05:12] land whether ye go to possess
[1:05:15] it and that ye may prolong your days in
[1:05:19] the land which the Lord swear unto your
[1:05:21] fathers to give unto them and to their
[1:05:24] seed a land that FL FL floweth with milk
[1:05:27] and honey for the land whether thou
[1:05:29] goest into possess it is not as the land
[1:05:33] of Egypt from whence ye came out where
[1:05:37] thou seest thy seed and waterest with
[1:05:39] thy foot as a garden of herbs but the
[1:05:41] land whether you go to possess it is a
[1:05:45] land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh
[1:05:49] water of the rain of Heaven A Land which
[1:05:53] the Lord thy God carth for the eyes of
[1:05:56] the Lord thy God are always upon it from
[1:05:59] the beginning of the year even un the
[1:06:01] end of the year and it shall come to
[1:06:03] pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto
[1:06:06] my Commandments which I command you this
[1:06:09] day to love the Lord your God and to
[1:06:10] serve him with all your heart and with
[1:06:12] all your soul that I will give you the
[1:06:16] rain of your land in his due
[1:06:19] season the first rain sewing and the
[1:06:23] latter harvesting come on the latter
[1:06:25] rain
[1:06:26] that thou mayest Gather in thy corn word
[1:06:29] and the wine Revelation and thine oil
[1:06:33] come on where's there's types in this
[1:06:36] and I will send grass in thy field for
[1:06:39] thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be
[1:06:42] full take heed to yourselves that your
[1:06:46] heart be not
[1:06:48] deceived listen where do we hear this
[1:06:51] what did Jesus warn Us in the new what
[1:06:54] did he tell us don't be deceived be not
[1:06:58] deceived now what do you think about
[1:07:00] this word heart here this word heart is
[1:07:03] your inner thoughts and
[1:07:06] emotions don't let your inner thoughts
[1:07:10] and emotions be
[1:07:12] deceived and you turn aside and serve
[1:07:16] other gods and worship them listen I'm
[1:07:20] giving you this land but don't be
[1:07:22] deceived there's going to be something
[1:07:24] there that's going to tempt you verse 17
[1:07:28] and then the Lord's wrath be kindled
[1:07:31] against you and he shut up the heavens
[1:07:34] and he shut up the heaven that there be
[1:07:36] no rain and that the land yield not her
[1:07:39] fruit lest ye perish uh uh quickly from
[1:07:43] off the good land which the lord giveth
[1:07:45] you therefore shall ye lay up these my
[1:07:50] words in your heart and in your
[1:07:53] soul this is come on this is more than
[1:07:56] just outward
[1:07:58] appearance and bind them for a sign upon
[1:08:01] your hand now it's it's
[1:08:05] outside okay so we're inside and outside
[1:08:09] that they may be as frontlet between
[1:08:12] your eyes and you shall teach them your
[1:08:17] children speaking of them when thou sest
[1:08:20] in thine house and when thou walkest by
[1:08:23] the way when thou liest down and when
[1:08:25] thou Rises up this is showing the
[1:08:27] importance of a Godly
[1:08:30] Family come on we don't want to get so
[1:08:32] caught up as parents in what we would
[1:08:35] say is a Godly work that we leave our
[1:08:38] kids

[1:08:41] hello and thou shalt write them upon the
[1:08:44] doorposts of thine house and upon thy
[1:08:47] Gates that your days be multiplied and
[1:08:51] the days of your children in the land
[1:08:53] which the Lord swear unto your fathers
[1:08:56] to give them as the days of Heaven upon
[1:08:59] the Earth for if you diligently keep all
[1:09:02] these Commandments now I don't want to
[1:09:04] just skip over the word diligently that

[1:09:07] dedication so if you take care and
[1:09:11] dedication to keep all of these
[1:09:13] Commandments which I command you to do

[1:10:21] come on we're trying to build a point
[1:10:22] here this morning there shall no man
[1:10:26] say it with me no man be able to stand
[1:10:30] before you I'm going to say this there's
[1:10:32] no Spirit there's no demon there's no
[1:10:37] sickness there is nothing that can stand
[1:10:40] before
[1:10:41] you do you believe
[1:10:44] it all right you said
[1:10:48] it Hallelujah
[1:10:50] behold oh I set before you this day
[1:10:56] a blessing and a cursing or and a curse
[1:11:02] a
[1:11:03] blessing if ye obey the Commandments of
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:08] Lord your
[1:11:11] God I'm sorry your God which I command
[1:11:14] you this
[1:11:15] day we got to read verse
[1:11:18] 28 and a
[1:11:20] curse if you will not obey the
[1:11:22] Commandments of the Lord your God
[1:11:26] but turn
[1:11:27] aside out of the
[1:11:29] way which I command you this day to go
[1:11:33] after other gods which ye have not
[1:11:41] known now I know that was lengthy but we
[1:11:44] we're Bible readers
[1:11:46] right so In this passage if you were
[1:11:50] following with me you will at least see
[1:11:52] five times the word
[1:11:56] possess five
[1:11:58] times it did not just say
[1:12:00] inhabit it said possess for it was not
[1:12:04] just about moving
[1:12:07] in but it was the word
[1:12:10] possess in the Hebrew this word possess
[1:12:13] means to drive out to seize to cast out
[1:12:18] to consume and to destroy this is not
[1:12:21] about you just grabbing your mom and pop
[1:12:23] and getting a U-Haul truck and going in
[1:12:25] and saying oh I want this house and
[1:12:27] moving in and
[1:12:29] inhabiting no this is about you grabbing
[1:12:32] your family grabbing all the
[1:12:36] weapons I don't this is not really good
[1:12:39] talk in this day and
[1:12:41] age but
[1:12:44] destroying and
[1:12:47] possessing are you still here this is
[1:12:50] seizing this is casting out this is
[1:12:52] consuming and this is destroying
[1:12:55] I believe this is why the lord gave our
[1:12:57] Prophet the idea or the thought
[1:12:59] footsteps footsteps meant
[1:13:03] possession because this is more than
[1:13:06] inhabiting think about this in
[1:13:08] perseverance in 63 he says you
[1:13:11] fight for every inch of the
[1:13:15] way well I thought that if I went to The
[1:13:17] Altar and I confessed my sins that if I
[1:13:19] walked out everything would just be A-
[1:13:21] okay and I would not have any more
[1:13:23] problems again who told you that is it
[1:13:25] definitely didn't come from the
[1:13:27] Bible hello no no you are going to fight
[1:13:31] every inch of the ways God down in Egypt
[1:13:34] give Palestine to the Jews but they
[1:13:37] fought every inch of the way God told
[1:13:39] Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet
[1:13:42] rest that have I given you footsteps
[1:13:45] meant Victory possession and just as far
[1:13:49] as you can climb into the kingdom of God
[1:13:52] if you just want to climb a little piece
[1:13:54] and say well I believe I might not have
[1:13:56] to go to hell but I believe that I'll be
[1:13:58] saved at the end if I join a church you
[1:14:01] ain't got much ground yet but every
[1:14:04] promise in the Bible is yours you see
[1:14:07] but you'll have to fight every devil
[1:14:10] guard away from it with a two-edged
[1:14:13] sword and claim it for yourself be
[1:14:17] persistent walking right into
[1:14:20] it so this is something that's going to
[1:14:23] take persistence
[1:14:25] and
[1:14:27] fighting now think about
[1:14:30] it I know
[1:14:32] you but since I'm up here I already
[1:14:34] forgot your
[1:14:36] name but if you

[1:14:44] stand up here for
[1:14:46] me I like him he's a good guy now I like
[1:14:51] him
[1:14:52] because I believe he stands on the word
[1:14:54] of God and he's human just like I am but
[1:14:58] I'm going to use him this morning
[1:14:59] because I know him and I know he won't
[1:15:00] get mad at
[1:15:01] me if this guy walked into you know
[1:15:04] because I believe he he's got this build
[1:15:07] to be a sports guy but if he if he right
[1:15:11] now put on a sports uniform let's say he
[1:15:13] put on the Cowboys uniform this morning
[1:15:16] every Sunday he put on a Cowboys uniform
[1:15:18] and he walked into the stadium every
[1:15:19] Sunday does that make him a Cowboys
[1:15:21] player no sir why not he put it on the
[1:15:25] uniform and I'm not just talking about a
[1:15:26] fan uniform he puts on the whole Garb he
[1:15:28] walks in there and he goes in he says
[1:15:30] I'm a cowboy I'm a cowboy now some of
[1:15:32] y'all probably don't know what that
[1:15:35] means okay I'm just kidding does that
[1:15:38] make him that sir am I making any sense
[1:15:42] all right thank
[1:15:44] you I'm going to say that again does
[1:15:47] walking in with the full garb make you
[1:15:52] well see showing up to church every
[1:15:54] Sunday morning that preach is the
[1:15:55] prophet's message wearing the uniform
[1:15:57] doesn't make you a message
[1:16:00] believer I'm not here to disappoint you
[1:16:02] but there's got to be some work
[1:16:05] done I'm not here to discourage you

[1:16:10] want to tell you you've got some work
[1:16:12] that you need to do you can't just come
[1:16:13] here this morning or every morning that
[1:16:15] your pastor preaches and say well at
[1:16:17] least I'm here I know that I I I believe
[1:16:19] that God sent a listen believing God
[1:16:21] sent a prophet ain't going to get you
[1:16:23] there there was a lot of people that
[1:16:25] followed Moses that didn't make it there
[1:16:27] was a lot of people that followed Joshua
[1:16:29] that didn't make it hello there was a
[1:16:32] lot of people that followed David listen
[1:16:34] there were people that followed Jesus
[1:16:36] that didn't make
[1:16:38] it Hallelujah some Works got to be
[1:16:42] done but it's not just about how
[1:16:45] eloquent we
[1:16:46] are how how well we can quote the word
[1:16:49] how eloquent we can quote the
[1:16:52] message how our message lingo is
[1:16:55] how much theology or even how excited we
[1:16:58] can
[1:17:00] become notice what he says here in
[1:17:02] Christ is the mystery says God is known
[1:17:04] by
[1:17:05] Simplicity and of revelation of Jesus
[1:17:08] Christ to the most illiterate
[1:17:14] person not your
[1:17:17] theology it's a revelation of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:17:21] church no other rocks accepted no other
[1:17:24] things accepted no other Roman Rock no
[1:17:26] other Protestant Rock no other school no
[1:17:28] other nothing but on exactly the
[1:17:30] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[1:17:33] new
[1:17:34] birth if you have been coming here and
[1:17:36] you're not born again something's wrong
[1:17:38] and it's not the pastor's fault it's not
[1:17:41] the evangelist's fault it's not the
[1:17:42] Deacon's
[1:17:44] fault it's not the worships
[1:17:47] fault hello come on it's nobody's fault
[1:17:50] but your own I don't know if you know
[1:17:51] that there's a song like that nobody's
[1:17:53] fault but your own
[1:17:57] I might not get called back
[1:17:59] again hello no other school no other
[1:18:02] nothing but on exactly the revelation of
[1:18:04] Jesus Christ the new birth he's born he
[1:18:07] borns in there and he injects his own
[1:18:12] life here it is and your life is
[1:18:17] gone and the life of Christ is
[1:18:20] projecting itself through you with the
[1:18:24] preeminence is to the people that they
[1:18:27] see the very life and works and signs
[1:18:31] and wonders that he did is doing the
[1:18:35] same thing through you outside of that
[1:18:37] the rest of it's not even called to at
[1:18:42] all Watch God's Great Revelation
[1:18:45] unfolding see now catch what he says
[1:18:48] here by lack of this Revelation is why
[1:18:52] we have so many different divisions
[1:18:55] among
[1:18:57] us and so much
[1:18:59] mockery listen that's my that that
[1:19:02] that's why my heart is breaking of the
[1:19:05] mockery of the
[1:19:06] message leave this message
[1:19:11] alone let's come back to the Simplicity
[1:19:13] of the
[1:19:15] word so much division Among Us is
[1:19:18] because people let Lord come back I
[1:19:21] don't want to lack
[1:19:22] Revelation oh open up your word to me
[1:19:25] people lack that Revelation see they
[1:19:27] lack it the
[1:19:29] teachers notice so we have to have
[1:19:31] something in our
[1:19:34] life well bless God I've been going to
[1:19:36] church for 25 years and I've got this
[1:19:38] and I got a family listen I I don't see
[1:19:42] God keeps taking me back to something so
[1:19:44] I feel like I got to say this I don't
[1:19:47] let's say I'm a
[1:19:49] parent and I'm raising up a family what
[1:19:52] if God brother Billy uses me to bring my
[1:19:58] son into the message but I don't make
[1:20:05] it I don't want to be satisfied with
[1:20:08] just being a church
[1:20:11] member how many people are going to come
[1:20:13] up to the end of the road and be
[1:20:16] shocked and because they were
[1:20:19] content with just claiming God sent a
[1:20:23] prophet content with
[1:20:25] emotionalism content with
[1:20:28] theology we need to come back to the
[1:20:31] heart of the
[1:20:33] matter so back in this again this in
[1:20:36] Deuteronomy was given by the prophet
[1:20:39] Moses right then let's move to Joshua so
[1:20:42] it was given to Moses now to Joshua
[1:20:46] Joshua chap 1 verse 2 we find it says
[1:20:49] now Moses my servant is dead well I
[1:20:52] guess because he's dead I guess the
[1:20:53] word's over
[1:20:56] M now therefore arise go over this
[1:21:00] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:21:03] land which I do give them even to the
[1:21:05] children of
[1:21:07] Israel every place that the soul of your
[1:21:10] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[1:21:13] unto you the word stays the
[1:21:15] same as I said unto
[1:21:18] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[1:21:21] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[1:21:24] river euphra Ates all the land of the
[1:21:26] Hittites and under the great sea toward
[1:21:28] the going down of the sun shall be your
[1:21:31] Coast here it is there shall not any man
[1:21:37] be able to stand before thee all the
[1:21:39] days of thy life as I was with
[1:21:43] Moses so I will be with thee I will not
[1:21:48] fail thee nor forsake
[1:21:50] thee same word same God same
[1:21:55] promise same
[1:21:57] commandment skip to verse 10 then Joshua
[1:22:01] commanded the officers of the people
[1:22:03] saying pass through the host and command
[1:22:07] the people saying prepare ye victuals or
[1:22:11] Provisions for within three days ye
[1:22:13] shall pass over this Jordan to go
[1:22:18] into
[1:22:19] possess the land which the Lord your God
[1:22:24] G giveth you
[1:22:27] to come on I don't think you're saying
[1:22:31] it not to just in habit the Lord has
[1:22:34] given you to possess it listen I want
[1:22:39] you to catch this this morning God did
[1:22:41] not bring you here to just inhabit a
[1:22:45] Pew he has brought you and given you a
[1:22:49] message to possess a
[1:22:51] message Revelation 10:9 says take it
[1:22:55] Revelation 10:10 says and I took this is
[1:22:59] an act of possessing so in this age
[1:23:03] there are
[1:23:05] possessors there are there will be a
[1:23:08] bride that will possess a message
[1:23:11] they're not satisfied brother Billy with
[1:23:13] coming to church and saying feed me but
[1:23:16] they want to come and they will stand
[1:23:19] upon a word and they will possess the
[1:23:22] word for themselves and they're not
[1:23:24] satisfied with Sunday morning possessing
[1:23:27] they're going to come Monday and Tuesday
[1:23:30] and they're going to possess the message
[1:23:31] for themselves they're hungry for the
[1:23:34] word of God oh Hallelujah there must be
[1:23:38] possessors today because inhabiters will
[1:23:42] not handle the
[1:23:43] pressure inhabiters will not be able to
[1:23:46] stand the
[1:23:47] pressure hallelujah how many believe
[1:23:50] that anything is possible for
[1:23:52] God I'm going to ask you again just in
[1:23:55] case you shut me down how many believe
[1:23:57] that anything is possible for God so
[1:24:01] nothing is impossible for God does that
[1:24:04] does that mean that there's nothing in
[1:24:06] your life that God cannot do for you all
[1:24:10] right well then let's go a little
[1:24:12] further in the in tement brother
[1:24:15] brandham says paragraph 60 God's word is
[1:24:17] eternal how many beli that as
[1:24:20] well if God's word is that perfect
[1:24:26] Hallelujah them who are in Christ is
[1:24:30] just as sure to
[1:24:32] raise as there is a
[1:24:36] resurrection Hallelujah ain't no devil
[1:24:38] in hell going to stop
[1:24:39] that God's just as obligated to his word
[1:24:43] to heal you as he is to save
[1:24:48] you it's his word that promised it it's
[1:24:53] God's word and we have no
[1:24:57] right to take away from
[1:24:59] it but just say it's the
[1:25:03] truth believe it no matter what happens
[1:25:07] believe it anyhow notice what he says
[1:25:10] here that's the way the rest of them had
[1:25:15] to believe it that's the way the rest of
[1:25:18] them I just read it that's all they had
[1:25:20] to do in Deuteronomy in Joshua
[1:25:25] that's all Israel had to do are you
[1:25:26] still with me that's all they had to do
[1:25:29] was believe it if they believed it
[1:25:31] everywhere the soles of their shoes was
[1:25:34] they possessed it there would have been
[1:25:36] no man able to stand before them there
[1:25:39] was nothing greater than them they would
[1:25:41] have been able to drive out every
[1:25:43] inhabit they would have been able to
[1:25:44] push and he said and we're not excluded
[1:25:47] from that God gave Palestine to Israel
[1:25:52] but they had to fight for every inch of
[1:25:53] ground God and the promise is yours but
[1:25:58] you have to fight for every inch you
[1:26:00] claim and the devil will see to
[1:26:05] that certainly he will but every claim
[1:26:09] in this word for our day is ours but
[1:26:13] we've been
[1:26:14] told don't mix
[1:26:17] it don't mix
[1:26:21] it notice what he says in in in a a a
[1:26:24] portion of a quote here and does God
[1:26:26] ever change his mind about his word said
[1:26:29] Israel was in their Journey going to
[1:26:31] Palestine coming from Egypt and the Lord
[1:26:34] was with
[1:26:36] them he said and every enemy that had
[1:26:38] raised up before Israel every enemy that
[1:26:41] had raised up before Israel was moved
[1:26:44] out of their way for God said he would
[1:26:47] send Hornets before them and would drive
[1:26:51] out every
[1:26:52] enemy as long long as they walked in
[1:26:57] obedience to his
[1:27:00] command the job was never too
[1:27:04] big the amalekites the Giants of the day
[1:27:09] meant nothing to
[1:27:13] Israel though they were small in stature
[1:27:17] but they were walking in thus saith the
[1:27:21] Lord listen if you stay in thus sayith
[1:27:24] the Lord nothing will stop
[1:27:28] you Hallelujah I didn't say you weren't
[1:27:31] going to face some troubles and trials
[1:27:33] and this flesh wasn't going to go
[1:27:34] through some hard times but stay and
[1:27:36] thus sayith the Lord and he'll get you
[1:27:38] through it I didn't say you weren't
[1:27:40] going to face some Giants in your life
[1:27:42] but stay and thus sayith the Lord and
[1:27:44] those giants will
[1:27:47] fall Allelujah so no matter what the
[1:27:50] opposition
[1:27:52] was God always
[1:27:55] seen that his words of promise never
[1:27:59] failed
[1:28:00] Israel so keep that in our mind keep
[1:28:03] that there there was nothing too
[1:28:09] hard for God and you even said that
[1:28:13] yourself you still with me now let's
[1:28:16] turn to Judges chapter one Judges
[1:28:19] chapter one are we still good on time I
[1:28:21] don't even know where we're at okay good
[1:28:24] as long as you say that I'm okay if we
[1:28:26] get down to one I'm getting
[1:28:29] nervous you mean 1:00 no one person
[1:28:31] saying
[1:28:33] preach Judges chapter 1 verse 17 now
[1:28:37] we've just said nothing is
[1:28:39] impossible nothing is too hard no giant
[1:28:42] right so here we go and Judah went with
[1:28:46] Simeon his brother and they slew the
[1:28:49] Canaanites that inhabiteth zeph and
[1:28:51] utterly destroyed it Glory
[1:28:54] say Glory with me glory glory and the
[1:28:57] name of the city was called horma also
[1:29:00] Judah took Gaza with the close Coast
[1:29:02] thereof Glory Glory GL say it glory
[1:29:07] glory and Escalon with the coast thereof
[1:29:11] glory and echon with the coast thereof
[1:29:15] glory and the Lord was with Judah glor
[1:29:19] and he drave out the inhabitants of the
[1:29:21] mountain Glory but could not drive out
[1:29:23] the inhabitants of the valley because
[1:29:25] they had Chariots of
[1:29:29] iron
[1:29:32] what Chariots of iron are we reading the
[1:29:36] same
[1:29:38] Bible wait they could drive out
[1:29:42] Giants and major
[1:29:45] things in
[1:29:47] iron is going to stop God
[1:29:55] okay okay let's okay let's let's may
[1:29:57] maybe this is a fluke let's let's go to
[1:30:00] verse
[1:30:01] 27 neither did
[1:30:04] Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of
[1:30:07] bethan and her towns uhoh it starts to
[1:30:13] travel
[1:30:15] through the
[1:30:18] church the
[1:30:22] family nor and her towns nor the
[1:30:25] inhabitants of D and her towns nor the
[1:30:28] inhabitants of elim and her towns nor
[1:30:30] the inhabitants of megadoo and her towns
[1:30:33] but the Canaanites would dwell
[1:30:37] in that
[1:30:39] land and it came to pass that when
[1:30:42] Israel was
[1:30:44] strong so they were strong and they
[1:30:49] could have drove them out
[1:30:55] they put Canaanites to
[1:30:59] Tribute and did not utterly drive them
[1:31:06] out we went from
[1:31:08] glory to Chariots of
[1:31:12] iron we went from
[1:31:14] glory to something in our
[1:31:19] life this is a very sad state for Israel
[1:31:22] it shows the unbelief of Judah and the
[1:31:24] beginning of the demise of
[1:31:27] Israel and those of whom lost
[1:31:31] confidence from the Chariots of
[1:31:34] iron and other battles because they
[1:31:37] thought that they were too great to
[1:31:39] defeat that they left them in the land
[1:31:43] but they thought okay you know
[1:31:46] what let's let let's let's let's make a
[1:31:48] pack with him let's make
[1:31:50] tribute that they forced them into labor
[1:31:54] or maybe this will be an economic
[1:31:56] Advantage for us allow me to bring this
[1:31:59] into a type of this
[1:32:00] message you can
[1:32:03] stay I'm going to
[1:32:05] control
[1:32:08] you are you are you with me I'm going to
[1:32:11] control you and you not
[1:32:14] me
[1:32:16] listen whatever God told you to get out
[1:32:19] of your
[1:32:20] life whatever demon whatever family
[1:32:24] thing that you were told to utterly
[1:32:28] destroy is not your
[1:32:31] buddy and we don't need to make tribute
[1:32:33] with
[1:32:34] it so if you see in history you will see
[1:32:37] little encampments of Canaanites or
[1:32:41] inhabitants that Israel could not budge
[1:32:44] all
[1:32:46] around summon heels and summon valleys
[1:32:49] and they allowed them to stay you ever
[1:32:52] had things in your life that you just
[1:32:53] couldn't Buy
[1:32:56] budge but the main problem with it was
[1:32:59] is they made tribute with him and God
[1:33:01] said don't do it don't make tribul you
[1:33:04] can't control those things that Satan
[1:33:07] will use to drag you down they'll go
[1:33:10] away for some time think about it what
[1:33:14] happened between
[1:33:17] that and
[1:33:19] David the Book of Judges
[1:33:24] what happened all kinds of
[1:33:28] turmoil think about it what happened
[1:33:30] what happened to what happened to Israel
[1:33:32] that shouldn't have happened once it
[1:33:34] gets to you it look I want you to get I
[1:33:36] want you to catch this God said don't do
[1:33:38] it don't make tribute with it don't
[1:33:40] leave it in your life and sometimes we
[1:33:43] go to some natural thing that we can see
[1:33:45] or that we can hold to and a lot of
[1:33:47] times we think that it's a it's a thing
[1:33:55] and it's a
[1:33:57] thing and if we can and and Satan gets
[1:34:00] us to look at the
[1:34:02] thing and I get it I get it sometimes
[1:34:05] things need to be removed visibly so
[1:34:08] don't don't crucify me but I want to say
[1:34:12] this sometimes
[1:34:14] things aren't
[1:34:18] enough sometimes it's
[1:34:21] inside is you can you can clean out your
[1:34:24] house you can take all the couches out
[1:34:27] and you can get it to where you have
[1:34:28] nothing but a mattress and carpet and
[1:34:31] you can take out the
[1:34:32] fridge you can have nothing in there and
[1:34:35] you can still have the stinking
[1:34:38] flesh what good is it going to
[1:34:41] do God said don't do
[1:34:44] it you cannot control those things that
[1:34:47] Satan will use to drive it because once
[1:34:49] it gets a hold of you it won't let you
[1:34:52] go I want to quote portion of Isaiah
[1:34:54] 14:17 it says that made the world as a
[1:34:57] Wilderness and destroyed the city of
[1:34:59] that open not the house or the doors of
[1:35:03] his prisoners it won't open up the doors
[1:35:07] once hell gets a hold of you it won't
[1:35:10] open those
[1:35:12] doors but I want to encourage you that
[1:35:16] no matter how long it
[1:35:19] takes keep
[1:35:22] pressing and clearing
[1:35:24] out all that doesn't belong that's right
[1:35:28] Israel made a mistake they should have
[1:35:31] cleared it out are you still
[1:35:34] here they should have done it and
[1:35:37] because they didn't it caused generation
[1:35:39] after generation come on young people
[1:35:42] you might be suffering because of
[1:35:43] generational
[1:35:47] stupidity listen I'm okay with saying
[1:35:49] that in front of my parents because my
[1:35:51] dad admits it he made mist mistakes and
[1:35:54] you know what I'm okay with my son
[1:35:56] saying that in front of me because I was
[1:35:58] if you don't like that word I apologize
[1:36:00] I'll say foolish in front of you but my
[1:36:02] son I made foolish mistakes and so my
[1:36:05] son had to make some uh had to suffer
[1:36:08] for some of those things but I've told
[1:36:10] him come on don't make the same mistakes
[1:36:12] that I made and I'm going to tell you
[1:36:14] young people don't make the same
[1:36:15] mistakes don't make it harder on the
[1:36:17] Next Generation somebody's got to stop
[1:36:20] that and we can keep saying it and keep
[1:36:22] making the same mistake but you have
[1:36:24] been given a charge to clear the
[1:36:28] land but until you do notice what
[1:36:31] happened
[1:36:32] here they were given all of this
[1:36:35] land and fight after fight after battle
[1:36:39] after
[1:36:41] battle it comes all the way down and I
[1:36:44] want to go to one
[1:36:45] place and there was one place brother
[1:36:48] Billy that just
[1:36:51] seemed it was in
[1:36:54] penetrable no matter how hard Israel
[1:36:58] would fight they could never attain
[1:37:02] it and it would eventually be known as
[1:37:06] Mount Zion or the city of
[1:37:09] David Zion in scripture is the city of
[1:37:13] the great king the place of the
[1:37:15] throne but it was inhabited by the
[1:37:20] jebusites in other words this en enemy
[1:37:23] is squatting in a place that does not
[1:37:26] belong to
[1:37:27] him the name jebusites means to tread
[1:37:30] down underf fooot to pollute to defile
[1:37:34] the holy things of God the jebusites had
[1:37:37] no intention of relinquishing its
[1:37:42] ground now Zion was a stronghold that
[1:37:46] was impenetrable so I want you to
[1:37:47] imagine it was all the way up at the
[1:37:50] top it was impenetrable because of the
[1:37:53] the natural Topography of the
[1:37:56] land it was a fort on top of a mountain
[1:38:01] to scale the sharp walls of the mountain
[1:38:04] you'll have to be Heavenly
[1:38:07] armed as Defender as the Defenders
[1:38:10] inside of the fort would shoot arrows at
[1:38:13] you pour hot oil on you and do what ever
[1:38:17] is at their disposal to stop the
[1:38:20] Invaders from scaling the walls from the
[1:38:24] outside so we're talking from the moment
[1:38:27] now the very beginning there would have
[1:38:30] been nothing to stop
[1:38:34] them but because they didn't listen in
[1:38:36] the beginning they missed
[1:38:42] out what has your
[1:38:45] stronghold what is the very last thing
[1:38:47] that's holding
[1:38:49] you the very last thing that's giving
[1:38:52] you the edge where you can see further
[1:38:54] than you've ever
[1:38:57] seen all
[1:38:59] right poor hot o onion do whatever is at
[1:39:02] their disposal to stop the Invaders
[1:39:04] let's say let's just say that you went
[1:39:07] past the arrows let's say you made it
[1:39:09] past the hot oil let's say you made it
[1:39:12] past all the stones
[1:39:15] brother then on the North side there was
[1:39:17] a thick Iron Gate that would stop you
[1:39:20] entering the fort there was no way
[1:39:22] battle after after battle nobody was
[1:39:26] able to overcome it because of its
[1:39:29] strategic position on a high mountain
[1:39:31] and its thick Iron Gate blocking the
[1:39:33] entrance into the zity city Zion had a
[1:39:36] long history of successful withholding
[1:39:39] Invasion under Joshua Judah uh could not
[1:39:43] drive the jebusites from its stronghold
[1:39:46] Joshua 1563 later on in judges when the
[1:39:49] benjamites settled in Jerusalem they
[1:39:51] also were unable to dislodge the
[1:39:53] jebusites listen it got to a point when
[1:39:56] when all the way even down to
[1:39:59] David the jebusites were so confident in
[1:40:02] their
[1:40:04] Fort that they said their lame and blind
[1:40:08] could fight them off 2 Samuel 5:6 says
[1:40:11] and the King and his men went to
[1:40:13] Jerusalem unto the
[1:40:15] jebusites and the habitant of the land
[1:40:18] which spake unto David saying except
[1:40:20] thou take away the Blind and the lame
[1:40:22] Thou shalt not come hither thinking
[1:40:24] David cannot come in hither basically in
[1:40:27] Translation it says you'll never get in
[1:40:28] here even the Blind and crippled can
[1:40:30] keep you
[1:40:33] out can I bring this down to this it
[1:40:35] says that thing in your life is mocking
[1:40:39] you you can never overcome
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] me I have such a strong hold in your
[1:40:48] life I have your heavenly
[1:40:51] peace I have your heavenly
[1:40:54] place I have that
[1:40:57] position I want you to imagine it was
[1:41:00] all of this time and it wasn't until all
[1:41:02] of the battles all of the situations and
[1:41:05] it wasn't until David finally came along
[1:41:09] because you know it's the city of David
[1:41:12] so you know it was
[1:41:14] him and I know you know the answer how
[1:41:17] he did it but I'm going to read it to
[1:41:18] you anyways it wasn't until David come
[1:41:22] along where where he where it was
[1:41:25] finally conquered notice and I don't I'm
[1:41:27] not going to have the exact number some
[1:41:30] 300 years later from when they could
[1:41:34] have done
[1:41:36] it put up that first pick
[1:41:39] brother so how did he do it and I'm
[1:41:41] going to read this as they as they put
[1:41:43] this up in this this C if you can see
[1:41:46] this as I read it look at the the uh the
[1:41:50] jebusite Water tunnel and that spring
[1:41:54] when David's men now they recognized
[1:41:57] they could not attack it from
[1:42:00] outside when David's men captured
[1:42:02] Jerusalem in 104 BC the city was much
[1:42:06] smaller than it is today and was
[1:42:08] confined to the low North South Ridge
[1:42:11] called oal meaning the hump to the south
[1:42:13] side to the south of what is now the
[1:42:15] Temple Mount David's Heavenly heavily
[1:42:19] armed men took the Defenders by surprise
[1:42:22] as they climbed up through the narrow
[1:42:24] vertical shaft in the sloping tunnel
[1:42:28] that enabled the je jebusites to haul
[1:42:31] water up from the uh Gian
[1:42:34] spring outside the wall into their
[1:42:37] fortified City on the top of the oal
[1:42:40] hill after being occupied by David's
[1:42:43] forces the old jebusite city became
[1:42:45] known as the city of David and the ridge
[1:42:49] on which stood was renamed Mount Zion
[1:42:53] so the only way to conquer it was to go
[1:42:57] from the
[1:42:59] inside and not from the
[1:43:02] out put the other
[1:43:05] picture from the inside this little tiny
[1:43:08] tunnel it
[1:43:10] took what seemed
[1:43:13] insignificant the Conquering came from
[1:43:15] within this is
[1:43:17] unconventional yet God works in
[1:43:21] unconventional ways
[1:43:24] 1 Corinthians 1:27 but God ha chosen the
[1:43:27] foolish
[1:43:28] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:43:31] and God ha chosen the weak things of the
[1:43:33] world to confound the things which are
[1:43:35] Mighty and the base things of the world
[1:43:37] and the things which are despised hath
[1:43:38] God chosen yay and the things which are
[1:43:40] not to bring to not the things are that
[1:43:43] no
[1:43:44] flesh no outside things should glory in
[1:43:48] his
[1:43:49] presence it takes something on the
[1:43:52] inside yes to defeat the
[1:43:55] jebusites in our lives we're always
[1:43:58] trying to work on the outside we're
[1:44:00] always trying to fix the outside we're
[1:44:01] always trying to prove something I'm
[1:44:03] going to do this I'm going to do this
[1:44:04] and we all trying to work on the outside
[1:44:06] notice what he says in power of
[1:44:08] transformation he says lo let the Holy
[1:44:10] Spirit come upon any person that's got
[1:44:12] true that's truly got something down
[1:44:15] there a healing comes from the
[1:44:21] inside let that healing come from the
[1:44:25] spirit that's in
[1:44:27] you if it's a genuine uh spirit
[1:44:30] anointing the genuine speed a seed it
[1:44:33] can do nothing but bear a son or
[1:44:36] daughter of God but the genuine Spirit
[1:44:38] can come up a cockabur seed the rain can
[1:44:41] fall Upon A cockabur and it will it will
[1:44:43] live just the same as it falls upon a
[1:44:46] wheed and make it live but by their
[1:44:48] fruits you shall know them and wear a
[1:44:50] fruit tree of God bearing his word
[1:44:52] listen these cancers are no longer
[1:44:55] allowed in our
[1:44:58] families the only way we we've got to
[1:45:00] quit trying to come at it from the
[1:45:02] outside self-help this and self promote
[1:45:05] this and all types of things you're
[1:45:06] trying to throw all kinds of things at
[1:45:08] this flesh you got to quit you've got to
[1:45:11] allow God it's Jesus on the inside
[1:45:14] working on the
[1:45:16] outside oh what a change in my life
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:27] amen you ain't going to do nothing I'm
[1:45:29] not going to do nothing I can't do

[1:45:38] 300 years of the jebusites and the
[1:45:42] Hittites but I promise you you're going
[1:45:45] to have a David rise
[1:45:47] up that's going to finally catch on and
[1:45:51] it's going to say I've had enough
[1:45:54] brother Billy I've had enough I don't
[1:45:57] care what they did before I'm going to
[1:45:59] go back to what the Lord said to Moses
[1:46:02] and what went on to Joshua and I'm going

[1:46:07] just go to a church that speaks a
[1:46:09] prophet I'm going to live what the
[1:46:11] prophet said not just because he's a
[1:46:13] prophet but because he pointed us to the
[1:46:15] word of God these cancers are no longer
[1:46:18] allowed in our families we have listened
[1:46:20] to the lies of our fathers for too long
