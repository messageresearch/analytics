[43:12] good to be gathered in the house of God
[43:14] want to welcome everyone and amen God
[43:17] bless you let's open our Bibles
[43:20] um in uh Matthew Chapter 13 we're going
[43:25] to
[43:32] 7 let's start from verse the 24th
[43:39] verse it says and
[43:42] another another Parable put it forth
[43:45] unto them saying the kingdom of God the
[43:49] Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man
[43:52] which show which saw good seed in his
[43:55] field
[43:56] but while he slept his enemy came and S
[44:00] tear among the wheat and went his way it
[44:04] says but when the blades was sprung up
[44:07] and brought forth fruits then appeared
[44:10] the tears also so the servant of the
[44:13] household came and said unto him sir did
[44:16] thou not sow good seed in thy field from
[44:20] when then had the tear had had it teared
[44:24] he said is said unto them an enemy has
[44:27] done this the servant said unto him will
[44:31] thou then that we go and gather up
[44:35] gather them up but he said unto they he
[44:37] said and he said nay lest while ye
[44:40] gather up the tear ye root up also the
[44:43] wheat he said and then on verse 30 he
[44:47] said uh let both grow together until the
[44:51] Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I
[44:54] will say to the reap ERS Gather ye
[44:57] together first the tears and bind them
[45:00] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[45:03] wheat into the barn into my barn father
[45:06] we ask you bless your word to us in the
[45:08] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[45:10] may have your
[45:13] seats just for a few moment this
[45:16] scripture I'll say has always been one
[45:19] that means so much and to me and um and
[45:25] if if you really look at it in light of
[45:27] the message of the
[45:29] hour the Harvest Time that brother B
[45:31] preach and all those things it really
[45:34] brother bam says the Harvest didn't
[45:35] happen until the end time so you really
[45:38] see uh how this really all comes
[45:41] together I I want to speak in in my in
[45:45] my thought process I'll try not to be
[45:47] too long I'll try to be I I was thinking
[45:49] about this I said you know bham says
[45:51] that Jesus never wasted his word he was
[45:54] very efficient so I said well I want to
[45:56] be very efficient with my word and see
[45:58] how quick I can finish up so and and and
[46:03] my thought as to say tonight uh is our
[46:07] confidence is in the word and as a
[46:11] subtitle I want to say uh the Master's
[46:14] confidence in his own
[46:17] seed as you read there it's it's very
[46:21] apparent as you read that you are the
[46:24] servants concerned about what's going to
[46:26] happen and the
[46:28] situation knowing that the master saw
[46:30] the good seed and and all of the things
[46:33] and come finding the tears around the
[46:35] seed they were very concerned and uh
[46:39] perhaps they were concerned to what's
[46:40] going to happen to the seed perhaps uh
[46:43] this is going to hamper the seed it's
[46:45] going to uh uh uh uh uh cause the seed
[46:48] to go in a state that's not supposed to
[46:50] be or it's going to uh we can even go as
[46:53] far as to say they're going to think
[46:54] it's going to have some negative effect
[46:56] towards the seed and the master is
[46:58] looking at them and saying that I know I
[47:01] said that we have seen this didn't you
[47:03] just saw the good seed but who did this
[47:05] where did the tear come from the master
[47:07] said well he said yeah I know the enemy
[47:09] had done that but he said well so we
[47:12] should go and and take this time and go
[47:14] take out all the tears and and and so
[47:17] that the seed can grow and it would not
[47:19] have anything hindering it they won't
[47:21] have they won't have any challenges
[47:23] around it they will just grow beautiful
[47:26] with the sunshine on its face and no
[47:28] challenges at all the Master look and
[47:31] said no that let's not do that let's
[47:33] leave it all grow together at the end we
[47:36] will know what's going to happen we're
[47:38] going to go and bound up all the tears
[47:40] and do it so I just began to think about
[47:43] it it just on my heart I began to look
[47:45] at it and just to look at the confidence
[47:48] that the master was projecting up on his
[47:50] own seed our pastor's been playing the
[47:53] the the the spoken word is the Original
[47:55] Seed
[47:56] and there's always yeah God comes in the
[47:59] beginning of creation and he said let
[48:01] every seed bring forth after its kind
[48:04] and he puts that statement right up
[48:06] there and he was not concerned so much
[48:09] about what else was going to happen but
[48:11] he was so much in preservation of his
[48:14] own seed that he knew he was going to
[48:15] send God didn't want his seed to be
[48:18] mixed up with anything he didn't want
[48:20] his seed he didn't want he came and he
[48:23] planted uh H H uh to have weed and then
[48:26] something else came up he didn't want
[48:28] the condition where he would come and he
[48:30] will plant corn and something else will
[48:32] come up so therefore he established a
[48:35] law that regardless of what happened the
[48:38] seed will bring forth half its own
[48:42] kind he established a law right up from
[48:45] the beginning and I love it even as our
[48:47] pastor read it and said God said let
[48:49] there be and there was so it doesn't
[48:52] really matter what happens in between it
[48:55] doesn't doesn't matter the challenges
[48:56] that are presented in between all we
[48:59] know is God said it and it's going to
[49:01] come to pass all we know is the master
[49:03] places the seed it doesn't matter how
[49:06] much rain or droughts or whatever happen
[49:09] the master who planted will take care of
[49:11] his own seed and the end the master will
[49:14] reap his own seed that he planted he's
[49:17] not going to plant corn and reap
[49:18] something else when he plants a seed to
[49:21] be corn at the end he will have corn if
[49:23] he planted a seed in the end time to
[49:26] have sons and daughters of God there's
[49:28] not enough devil on Earth that's going
[49:30] to stop it there's not enough conditions
[49:33] on the planet that's going to stop it if
[49:35] you planted sons and daughters in the
[49:37] end time God will reap the same so the
[49:40] master don't want you to become
[49:42] concerned about what else is around you
[49:45] oh the world is falling apart everything
[49:47] is not working and this is happening and
[49:50] politics is happening here the
[49:51] earthquake is going on over there he he
[49:54] doesn't want you to be be concerned
[49:56] about those things the only thing the
[49:58] master wanted to point out was he knew
[50:01] that what he planted on the field was
[50:03] was the real seed that he came and he
[50:06] planted wheat and when the servant was
[50:08] concerned about what else was in the
[50:09] field the master confidence was not in
[50:12] the tears or the other stuff the master
[50:15] confidence was in the fact that there
[50:16] was seed his seed wheat was in the
[50:19] ground and wheat will come
[50:22] out so he wants us to only focus on the
[50:25] seed he wants you to only focus on he
[50:29] want us to only focus on what he planted
[50:32] what he had to do uh you know one you
[50:34] can say he says a certain seed is the
[50:37] other seed is planted everything is
[50:39] there everything else that will come and
[50:41] it it will present as a challenge but
[50:43] the master knew that whatever I planted
[50:46] at the end of the day will produce
[50:48] exactly what I planted now you and I say
[50:52] this because I was thinking many times
[50:54] you find people people they'll come and
[50:56] and they'll say you ask someone why is
[50:59] it that you don't go to church why is it
[51:01] that you're not committed to the things
[51:02] of God they'll find well you know the
[51:04] reason I don't do that is because I have
[51:06] this fleshly failing or or I smoke or I
[51:09] do this or I do that and they let those
[51:12] things hinder them from coming into the
[51:15] presence of God you know even set it on
[51:19] one place he come find one place and
[51:21] said why don't you become a Christian
[51:22] they said well if I stop doing this then
[51:25] I will become a Christian that's the
[51:27] wrong way to approach it that's the
[51:30] wrong way to approach it and because in
[51:33] that condition there is nothing in there
[51:35] that will fight the condition that you
[51:37] are in the devil cannot overcome devil
[51:41] it's just going to be a swap from
[51:43] another devil to another you you cannot
[51:45] overcome evil with evil the Bible says
[51:49] that it's not going to work what you
[51:51] need is for a seed or the word of God to
[51:53] be planted in your heart what you need
[51:55] is to go to a place and hear the word of
[51:58] God believe the word of God let another
[52:01] seed be planted over there the seed of
[52:03] God when it's planted in your heart the
[52:05] seed of God has the way to overcome the
[52:08] tear that's around
[52:11] you the master is concerned on the wheed
[52:15] his concern is not about the tear it
[52:18] doesn't matter how much tear that is in
[52:20] there the seed has the power to overcome
[52:22] all of
[52:23] that and and thought I I thought about
[52:26] it let me just say this I I feel like
[52:29] often time even with our own lives our
[52:32] focus is what we cannot
[52:35] do oh what's wrong the focus is what's
[52:40] wrong with us instead of what's right
[52:42] with
[52:44] us I I just want you to stay with me for
[52:46] a moment every time you w up you don't
[52:50] look at yourself and say man I got a lot
[52:52] of good things going for me I you know
[52:55] often time it's always well you know I
[52:57] didn't do this I failed to do that I was
[52:59] wrong here I was wrong here I was wrong
[53:02] that that's what oh I'm sick in my body
[53:04] and I don't have the job that I'm
[53:05] looking for and all of that that that's
[53:08] okay but let me say this the master
[53:10] focus is the weats that's in you so what
[53:13] you need to do is once you you you look
[53:15] at all of those things there has to be
[53:17] some kind something within your heart
[53:19] that said yes I'm sick but I got god
[53:21] with
[53:23] me so you cannot just focus on the tears
[53:27] that's around you and fail to realize
[53:30] that there's a wheat that was planted in
[53:32] the same
[53:33] field well you know but we'll talk about
[53:36] this the Indian chief he said he had two
[53:39] dogs and imagine if every time that
[53:42] Indian chief walk out walked up the only
[53:45] thing he did he fed the black dog and
[53:47] and tell him how he was you know talk
[53:49] about the black dog every time the white
[53:51] dog will never gain strength and that's
[53:54] often time what we do we work up and he
[53:57] says oh I can't do this I have shortage
[53:59] of this and I wish I could be a better
[54:02] Christian I wish do what let me say this
[54:04] the fact that you are a Christian is
[54:06] already a positive the fact that you
[54:09] woke up you came to the house of God is
[54:11] already a positive the fact that within
[54:14] your heart there's something that bits
[54:15] for the word of God that's already a
[54:18] positive build upon the positive don't
[54:21] pile upon the
[54:24] negative amen amen and let me say this
[54:28] the Master's answer to your condition is
[54:31] let them grow together let them grow
[54:34] together there's we there let it grow
[54:36] together why because the master knew
[54:38] that all it would take is once to Treck
[54:40] him to his possession the tree will have
[54:43] the power to produce what he had to
[54:46] produce there will won't be anything
[54:48] that will challeng
[54:50] it and so so we find out you can say the
[54:55] the he says that seem the master here
[54:59] he's saying we shouldn't be focusing on
[55:03] what we are
[55:04] lacking oh If I Only Could Have This
[55:08] I'll become a better
[55:10] Christian if I only can be this then I
[55:13] will become a better Christian the
[55:15] question should be I have the Holy
[55:18] Ghost God gave me the Holy Ghost and
[55:21] upon this holy ghost that he gave me the
[55:24] scripture says that the Holy Ghost will
[55:26] produce four fruits and those fruits
[55:28] will abound in my life I need to focus
[55:32] on the Holy Ghost that's been given to
[55:34] me I need to focus on the word that's
[55:37] been given to me I need to water that
[55:39] word I need to take care of that word
[55:42] that word will come and it will take
[55:44] away the last of the world it will take
[55:46] away let me say this you didn't come
[55:48] here because there was just wheat in
[55:50] your life you came here because there
[55:52] was just tear in your life you came here
[55:54] because somewhere in your life in your
[55:57] heart there was a weed that was sown
[56:03] also but whatam speaks in the message it
[56:06] shall be and he says this he says now
[56:09] notice this thing this one thing it says
[56:11] paragraph 19 it says for our faith uh it
[56:16] says for your faith that you might that
[56:19] you might have perfect confidence it
[56:21] says for that you might have perfect
[56:23] confidence when you are told anything
[56:27] you stay right there with that don't it
[56:30] says don't you leave it a
[56:32] bit don't you live it a bit of it no
[56:36] matter how she twist and blow you stay
[56:40] right there God promised it God will do
[56:44] it is that right it says this is the
[56:47] gift it says the word will do the word
[56:50] will do it
[56:53] itself now I I want you to people will
[56:57] come through the prayer line will come
[56:58] with all kinds of diseases will come
[57:00] with all kinds of conditions now the
[57:02] prophet is not piling up on how big the
[57:05] disease is he's not piling up on how
[57:08] terrible the conditions are he's coming
[57:11] here and says that you heard the word
[57:13] he's now focusing them from the negative
[57:15] back to the positive did you hear the
[57:17] word he said yes did you believe the
[57:19] word yes did you believe that Jesus
[57:22] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[57:23] forever you believe that he's the author
[57:26] of this word you believe once he brings
[57:28] them to the positive he knows that the
[57:31] seed word has been planted and if the
[57:33] seed word is planted the seed word will
[57:35] bring forth
[57:37] results it's not the piling up or the
[57:40] tears that changes the
[57:43] circumstance but it's the building on
[57:45] the wheat that's been planted that
[57:47] brings forth the pro the result it says
[57:50] now you are sitting
[57:51] here it says all of you are looking at
[57:54] the at this way it says and listen to
[57:57] the word it said God in heaven knows I
[58:00] do not see a person that I know only
[58:03] there's one thing that does that does
[58:05] know you it says that's God God knows
[58:09] all about you and God can heal you God
[58:15] knows all about the wheat God is not
[58:18] concerned about the tear wanted to bring
[58:21] he's not concerned about how much tear
[58:23] there is that's right
[58:28] in the message the Church of the Church
[58:30] of the Living God he says God is no
[58:34] worth more than his
[58:37] word oh my and and I I said confidence
[58:41] in the word the Master's confidence in
[58:43] his old God is no more worth than his
[58:47] word he says and if his word is no good
[58:52] then he is no good he he says if your
[58:55] word it STS it says if I can't put no
[58:59] confidence in what you say you are no
[59:01] good but you are just as good as your
[59:04] word is and God is just as good as his
[59:08] word
[59:09] is and then it says and I as a Christian
[59:12] believer I believe that this Bible is
[59:15] inspired and it is the WR and it is
[59:18] written by the holy go by the Holy
[59:20] Spirit and it's the unfailing unfailable
[59:23] word of God and God is under obligation
[59:27] to his word to the believer that he will
[59:30] accept his that that that will accept
[59:32] his word he says and any word is the
[59:36] seed and if you accept you accept it in
[59:39] your heart by faith and believe it and
[59:42] confess it God will bring it to
[59:46] pass oh what a marvelous formula and I
[59:50] was just thinking about this and oh I'll
[59:52] probably get to it towards even the hand
[59:54] or say this and and if if I Brother
[59:57] David told me that he was going to give
[1:00:00] me
[1:00:04] $50,000
[1:00:07] $500,000 and and and and I know let me
[1:00:11] just and and I hope you understand this
[1:00:16] $500,000 and I know we know the prophet
[1:00:18] told us we are not the flesh but the
[1:00:22] David is not the flesh that's sitting
[1:00:24] here Brother David is the spirit within
[1:00:26] the flesh that's why the prophet will
[1:00:28] say the Holy Spirit what the word the
[1:00:31] spirit the the Bible tells us that God
[1:00:33] is a spirit so so the spirit the Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost wrote the word so when I hear
[1:00:39] Brother David's word I'm hearing the
[1:00:42] spirit of Brother David speaking to
[1:00:45] me and so if he tells me and I show up
[1:00:48] to cash it Brother David flesh and body
[1:00:52] his spirit will cause his body to go
[1:00:55] into motion to come and to take to so
[1:00:58] that he can obey the words that he told
[1:01:00] me so that he can bring his promise to
[1:01:03] come to pass but first the very thing
[1:01:05] that I know I received from Brother
[1:01:07] David was his word but the spirit spoke
[1:01:11] that word into existence and that spirit
[1:01:13] is responsible to come and take the word
[1:01:16] that I heard and bring it to pass into
[1:01:19] my
[1:01:20] life that's why the prophet will say we
[1:01:24] have to be be careful when we say spirit
[1:01:26] it's not another Spirit just some out
[1:01:28] there the words that's spoken it's got
[1:01:30] the spirit of God within it to bring it
[1:01:34] to pass it's not a spirit coming from
[1:01:36] other places but it's the spirit of the
[1:01:39] very word that you are hearing why
[1:01:42] because if God spoke it there has to be
[1:01:44] a way that's going to bring it to pass
[1:01:46] and how is he bring it to pass the
[1:01:48] spirit that brought the word brings the
[1:01:51] word into
[1:01:53] manifestation amen
[1:01:57] wonderful what what I'm says in the
[1:02:00] message pamus Church age it says I
[1:02:03] wonder if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:02:06] with the word in our midst oh my we we
[1:02:10] heard the the the word seed of God the
[1:02:13] word that was spoken in the beginning
[1:02:16] the word that makes things happen the
[1:02:18] word that changes circumstances the word
[1:02:21] that speaks things into existence the
[1:02:24] word word that calls things that were
[1:02:26] not as all the were things that are
[1:02:28] although if they were not the word he
[1:02:31] said are you sufficiently impressed with
[1:02:33] that word he says in our M it says let
[1:02:37] me give you a thought here it says how
[1:02:39] do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't
[1:02:42] we he says every prayer is in Jesus name
[1:02:45] and there uh it says and isn't that the
[1:02:48] any answer he says yet I say in John 5
[1:02:51] and and 14 he says we are told that but
[1:02:54] this is the confidence that we have in
[1:02:57] him that if we ask anything according to
[1:03:00] his will he he says he Hearth
[1:03:04] us this is the confidence we have in him
[1:03:08] that if we ask him according to his word
[1:03:11] he will hear us not outside of his word
[1:03:14] according to his word if you come to the
[1:03:17] Bible but will say you pick an example
[1:03:21] that's closest to your circumstance and
[1:03:23] you take it and you believe it and you
[1:03:25] take it before God he says if God has
[1:03:28] ever done something one time he's
[1:03:30] obligated to do it again if another
[1:03:33] person shows up in the same circumstance
[1:03:36] it's the word that does
[1:03:39] it the spoken word is the Original
[1:03:45] Seed it says this is the confidence that
[1:03:47] we have in him that if we ask anything
[1:03:50] according to his will he Health us and
[1:03:53] if we know that he Hearth us whatsoever
[1:03:56] we ask we know that we have we have a
[1:04:01] petitions we have the petitions that we
[1:04:03] desire of him he says now we ask what is
[1:04:07] the will of God I love this he says
[1:04:11] there's only one way to know his will
[1:04:14] that is by the word of
[1:04:17] God the only way to know his will is
[1:04:21] even by his own word his word tells you
[1:04:23] to ask his word tells you what his will
[1:04:26] is his word tells you
[1:04:28] everything so he says L it says in
[1:04:30] lamentation 3 and 37 he says who is he
[1:04:34] that saith he says it cometh to pass
[1:04:37] when the Lord commandeth it not he says
[1:04:39] there it is if it isn't in his word you
[1:04:42] can't have it so when you can't you
[1:04:45] can't ask unless it's in the it's in the
[1:04:47] word we can't petition or ask unless
[1:04:50] it's in the name it's in his name it
[1:04:52] says there it is again Jesus the name in
[1:04:56] the word will he says you can't separate
[1:05:00] God and the word they are
[1:05:04] one
[1:05:06] Hall oh let me just say this he told
[1:05:10] Joshua be not be not be afraid be
[1:05:13] confident be confident go forth and and
[1:05:17] then you shall overcome he said the same
[1:05:19] way I was with Moses shall I be with you
[1:05:22] let me say this God told him to be
[1:05:24] confident because God knew what was
[1:05:26] awaiting for them before they didn't
[1:05:29] know what was awaiting for them God knew
[1:05:31] what army will come before them what
[1:05:33] army will challenge them on the way God
[1:05:36] told them he says be confident now let
[1:05:38] me say this God knew that if they went
[1:05:41] just as a man with the words of a man
[1:05:43] they shall
[1:05:45] fail but God the heaven the creator of
[1:05:49] Heaven and Earth he gave them his word
[1:05:51] which is his own seed and he knew knew
[1:05:54] that if they have a seed in them they
[1:05:56] shall never
[1:05:59] fail what we need is the seed of God
[1:06:02] inside of us when we go to do something
[1:06:05] we don't need the words of an
[1:06:07] understanding of a man what you need to
[1:06:09] ask is am I standing on some seed of God
[1:06:13] somewhere am I standing on the promises
[1:06:15] that he said somewhere because if I have
[1:06:18] the word I have the seed of life I have
[1:06:21] the seed of
[1:06:23] overcoming
[1:06:24] amen amen and I said this before
[1:06:28] Israel's uh overcoming strength never
[1:06:32] came based upon how much training they
[1:06:35] had it's not because they went in they
[1:06:37] train against the enemy they had the
[1:06:40] right weapons and they had all kinds of
[1:06:42] say no that's not where the victory came
[1:06:45] the victory came by obedience to the
[1:06:47] words of the Prophet
[1:06:49] amen when they obeyed the word of the
[1:06:52] Prophet they overcame when they failed
[1:06:54] to obey they were defeated so is it with
[1:06:58] us today we have the words of the
[1:07:00] prophet in our time our overcoming
[1:07:03] strength will come from the words of the
[1:07:05] Prophet how quickly we obey
[1:07:09] it if he says Don't Be Afraid why are
[1:07:12] you
[1:07:17] afraid the word the overcoming
[1:07:22] seed
[1:07:24] now we find out
[1:07:28] that butam will tell
[1:07:31] us to overcome we need to recognize the
[1:07:34] devil and every single one of his
[1:07:36] tricks and then after we do that then we
[1:07:39] need to also remember and recognize he
[1:07:43] that is in us that's greater than him
[1:07:44] that is in the world now the problem is
[1:07:48] he always the enemy will try to always
[1:07:50] to get you to forget those
[1:07:52] tactics butam says this in the
[1:07:55] revelation of Jesus Christ it says have
[1:07:58] you ever notice how the devil hates two
[1:08:00] books in the Bible more than any other
[1:08:03] it says through the liberal theologians
[1:08:06] and the SOS sanest and he's always
[1:08:08] attacking the Book of Genesis and the
[1:08:09] Book of Revelation in both of these
[1:08:12] books we find how Satan's origin his
[1:08:15] awful ways and his destruction he says
[1:08:19] that is why he attacked them he hates to
[1:08:21] be exposed and then says in those books
[1:08:24] he is exposed for exactly what he is
[1:08:29] Jesus said about Satan it says he has no
[1:08:31] part with me and I have no part in
[1:08:34] him the devil will like to prove to Pro
[1:08:38] uh uh the the devil will like to prove
[1:08:41] that different but he cannot and he
[1:08:44] doesn't he does all that he can to
[1:08:46] destroy confidence in the
[1:08:51] word confidence in the the
[1:08:54] word confidence in the word what is CH
[1:08:59] the greatest battle that's ever been
[1:09:01] fought for human is that we forget that
[1:09:04] we have a word that's been given to us
[1:09:06] to overcome
[1:09:08] with the greatest challenge mankind has
[1:09:12] ever had is to always forget that in him
[1:09:15] God placed the material and the deposit
[1:09:19] that we need in order for us to
[1:09:22] overcome let let me say this brother the
[1:09:25] the brother says the word will overcome
[1:09:27] the challenge of the hour God cannot
[1:09:29] Place us here so that we can wait for
[1:09:32] some power from some place to help us
[1:09:34] overcome the world if he Place us here
[1:09:38] and he spoke how did we come we came by
[1:09:41] the word of God so if he Place us here
[1:09:44] and gave us the message of the hour it's
[1:09:46] given to us regardless of what
[1:09:49] challenges we meet that we can use that
[1:09:51] word to overcome with
[1:10:03] he
[1:10:04] says let me just keep some for the sake
[1:10:07] of time the scripture speaks in Hebrews
[1:10:10] 10 and 34 it
[1:10:12] says for ye have for ye had compass for
[1:10:16] he had
[1:10:17] compassed of me in my bonds and took my
[1:10:21] joyfully my joyfully to the spoil and
[1:10:25] your good and your goods knowing in
[1:10:28] yourself that ye have in heaven a better
[1:10:31] a better and enduring substance Cast
[1:10:34] Away cast not away your confidence
[1:10:37] therefore cast not away therefore your
[1:10:39] confidence which he had great recompense
[1:10:42] of reward for ye have needs of patience
[1:10:47] that after ye have done the will of God
[1:10:50] ye might receive the promise that that
[1:10:53] challenge with men is we we we always
[1:10:56] seems to think that we need something
[1:10:59] more than the word after the word has
[1:11:01] gone forth after we've prayed with us
[1:11:04] for God and we are in a situation where
[1:11:07] we don't know how to get out of and we
[1:11:09] pray we ask for God we we want something
[1:11:12] else to come and help us no we what we
[1:11:15] need to understand is we have to have
[1:11:17] patience with the word of God and know
[1:11:19] that I I pray God I've asked God and now
[1:11:23] I'm waiting for him to come and take me
[1:11:25] out of my situation I'm not waiting for
[1:11:28] any man I'm waiting for the owner of the
[1:11:30] word to come and make his word a reality
[1:11:32] to
[1:11:38] me oh butam talks about God's confidence
[1:11:42] in job and and this was not because the
[1:11:47] prophet will say this was because of
[1:11:50] job's knowledge of God all job knew was
[1:11:54] he was given a commandment and he stood
[1:11:56] by
[1:11:57] it he was given a word a commandment by
[1:12:01] which he could live and all job did was
[1:12:04] he took that commandment and Obey it and
[1:12:07] he stayed with it day and night and when
[1:12:10] when something will happen he knew that
[1:12:12] Jehovah needed a a a burnt offering and
[1:12:15] he will go the scripture will say that
[1:12:18] when his children gathered together he
[1:12:19] said per Adventure they did or said
[1:12:22] something that's not good will go and
[1:12:24] offer uh offering and you will do
[1:12:27] according to he lived his life based on
[1:12:30] the word that was given to him in his
[1:12:36] time and then the Devil comes and he's
[1:12:38] telling God oh it's perhaps because of
[1:12:41] the the the the things that you have
[1:12:44] done what the devil was not aware of was
[1:12:47] job was had the seed of God in him the
[1:12:51] Commandment the word of God that he had
[1:12:53] re receive was the seed of God that
[1:12:55] dwelt within him that's why the seed of
[1:12:58] the the word will say that who can
[1:13:00] condemn you of sin if the seed of God
[1:13:02] remains in
[1:13:03] you it's the seed that justify you it's
[1:13:07] the seed that saves you it's a seed that
[1:13:10] takes you out of sin why what say you
[1:13:14] cannot fail as long as God in heaven
[1:13:16] cannot
[1:13:22] fail no what we take is well the God in
[1:13:26] us is a has different property than the
[1:13:29] God in heaven he's no longer the same so
[1:13:33] when he's Heaven he has more power but
[1:13:35] the moment he descends in
[1:13:38] you that power
[1:13:43] disappears and somehow you need him in
[1:13:46] the fields in the five senses in order
[1:13:48] for you to know that he's
[1:13:50] there God is in his word amen
[1:13:53] God is in his promise to his children
[1:13:56] when you have his word you have God in
[1:13:58] you when you have his seed in you let me
[1:14:02] say this just as much as you read your
[1:14:04] Bible every morning or every day you
[1:14:07] might as well know that you are taking
[1:14:09] an eating of God inside of
[1:14:14] you the prophet will say now Satan they
[1:14:18] said he had come up before God because
[1:14:20] he could come before God and accused her
[1:14:23] Christians it says this isn't the
[1:14:25] message I have heard but now I see
[1:14:27] preaching
[1:14:29] 55127 paragraph
[1:14:31] 51 and and all the time so he accused
[1:14:35] job of many things and he says job the
[1:14:38] reason that he could serve God because
[1:14:40] because anything was come was coming
[1:14:43] good for him but he said if you if
[1:14:46] you'll just let me have him in my hand
[1:14:49] I'll make him curse you to your face he
[1:14:52] says I I want you to notice that the
[1:14:55] confidence that God had in a Believer he
[1:14:59] says in other words God said to Job it
[1:15:04] says God said to Satan like this he says
[1:15:07] you can't do it he says I'm just a I'm
[1:15:11] just I'm just I'm just man Justified he
[1:15:15] says he is a good man there's not like
[1:15:19] there's not one like him in the whole
[1:15:20] earth he says oh what a man
[1:15:23] that God himself will say to his enemy
[1:15:27] he says my servant is so perfect there's
[1:15:29] not another on Earth on earth like him
[1:15:32] he says oh if we could only be that kind
[1:15:36] of a man that God could bestow that
[1:15:39] confidence upon us that we know it says
[1:15:42] we know will not Twist from his word or
[1:15:46] his being anyway stay exactly he can put
[1:15:50] his trust in
[1:15:52] US
[1:15:54] amen the trust was based upon job
[1:15:57] obedience to the word was based upon God
[1:16:00] knowing that his seed was in job because
[1:16:03] remember job was the seed of God job was
[1:16:07] one who received the word of God because
[1:16:10] the characteristics of the seed of God
[1:16:13] we'll get to it are the ones that
[1:16:15] receive the word of
[1:16:21] God the scripture talks about children
[1:16:23] of disobedient and children of obedience
[1:16:26] that's how they are blown they are are
[1:16:28] brought forth in the further
[1:16:30] manifestation so if in your heart you
[1:16:32] love God you you like to hear his word
[1:16:35] you receive his word in his heart his
[1:16:38] word in your heart will produce forth
[1:16:40] after its own kind his word in your
[1:16:43] heart will bring forth the nature of God
[1:16:45] out of you it will bring it to the
[1:16:47] surface and make it
[1:16:49] manifested whatam will say in the
[1:16:52] message the
[1:16:54] Rapture and you will read this scripture
[1:16:57] um Psalm 27 it says though the whole
[1:16:59] host encamp about me he says my heart
[1:17:02] shall not fear though War should rise
[1:17:05] against me in this will I have
[1:17:07] confidence it says one thing have I
[1:17:09] desire of the Lord that will I seek
[1:17:11] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:17:14] the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:17:17] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:17:19] inquire in his Temple so David's desire
[1:17:23] as he writes this but regardless of what
[1:17:26] was around him regardless of the tears
[1:17:28] and the situation and all the failings
[1:17:31] and all the armies that were encamp
[1:17:32] around him David is sending and saying
[1:17:35] my confidence in the fact that I know my
[1:17:37] heart wants to serve the Lord my
[1:17:40] confidence is in the fact that I know I
[1:17:43] done wrong yes I I took a wife that was
[1:17:45] not mine and I killed people and I did
[1:17:48] all of that but one thing I know within
[1:17:50] my heart is I want to serve God
[1:17:56] amen it wasn't this elaborate things
[1:17:59] like we try to make it he just knew one
[1:18:01] thing I love God I love his word I want
[1:18:06] to serve him with all my heart yes I've
[1:18:08] done wrong but I know there's a seat in
[1:18:10] there all those stairs didn't matter oh
[1:18:13] my brother my sister it's when we move
[1:18:16] our Focus away from all the
[1:18:21] thars and humbly come to the altar said
[1:18:24] father I know there's so much tears I
[1:18:26] couldn't even count them
[1:18:29] all but I know somewhere within my heart
[1:18:32] there's a seed that's beating within my
[1:18:35] heart otherwise I wouldn't be here at
[1:18:37] this altar otherwise I wouldn't desire
[1:18:40] to be here I'm not here because somebody
[1:18:43] brought me here I'm here because within
[1:18:45] my heart I desire to worship you out of
[1:18:48] my heart I I desire to be a true
[1:18:50] Christian out of my heart I desire to
[1:18:53] see the manifestation of the end time
[1:18:55] word under of my heart I desire to see
[1:18:57] you overcome the devil IID like to see
[1:19:00] you come in our church and comeing to
[1:19:03] our young people and comeing to and
[1:19:05] overcome sin and the devil and all
[1:19:07] things and creating as the nature of God
[1:19:11] if I don't know anything that's the
[1:19:12] thing I know that's rightall amen one
[1:19:17] thing if I desire not 10
[1:19:19] one that's right amen
[1:19:28] and let me say this Faith creates
[1:19:33] confidence when you have faith you have
[1:19:36] confidence David knew who he was when he
[1:19:39] stood before Goliad Oh my he had faith
[1:19:43] in what the prophet told him the prophet
[1:19:45] had just baptized anointed him to be a
[1:19:48] king he said You shall be king of Israel
[1:19:51] so David stood there there and he this
[1:19:54] giant tear that was standing in front of
[1:19:56] him terrifying
[1:19:59] everybody everybody running away from
[1:20:01] this giant
[1:20:03] Terr he looked he says
[1:20:07] well I know in the natural this is a big
[1:20:10] tear I can't do anything with that but
[1:20:13] there's one thing I know I just heard
[1:20:16] the words of the Prophet oh let me say
[1:20:18] this I'm not talking about David I'm
[1:20:20] talking about you I just heard the pro
[1:20:23] words of a prophet and that Prophet told
[1:20:25] me that I shall be anointed king that
[1:20:28] Prophet told me that I'm going to be
[1:20:30] translated I'm going to be taken out of
[1:20:33] this body into the new body that Prophet
[1:20:35] told me that the end time Pride will be
[1:20:38] the manifestation of Jesus Christ so he
[1:20:41] came and he looked at the tear in the
[1:20:42] face he says you have messed up with the
[1:20:45] army of God I shall cut your head
[1:20:49] off cut my head off you don't even have
[1:20:53] a
[1:20:57] sword I don't know how that's going to
[1:20:59] happen but I'll cut your head off that's
[1:21:03] right he spoke the word at the end the
[1:21:06] word was
[1:21:07] fulfilled
[1:21:12] that's what is your giant
[1:21:15] ha what are you hiding
[1:21:19] from see our confidence is not in our
[1:21:22] ability to do things our ability to get
[1:21:25] things together just the way we want it
[1:21:28] to have everything just line up then we
[1:21:30] know God is there no our confidence is I
[1:21:33] have heard the word of God and I'm
[1:21:36] standing here just because he said so
[1:21:39] I'm I'm in the Church of God just
[1:21:41] because he wanted me to be here I try to
[1:21:44] run away he caught me and he brought me
[1:21:46] here he because he opened my ears to
[1:21:49] understand the Mysteries he opened my
[1:21:52] heart to accept the Mysteries he done it
[1:21:54] all and if he done that he's able to
[1:21:57] take me to my final
[1:22:02] destination let me move for the second
[1:22:11] time but I want to makees a statement
[1:22:14] and I
[1:22:15] just before I go on let me
[1:22:18] just read it
[1:22:21] and and I felt like this is so much part
[1:22:25] of my
[1:22:28] problem in the unfailing reality of the
[1:22:31] Living God bham
[1:22:35] says Jesus brought God to human
[1:22:39] lives now I want you to understand that
[1:22:42] wordings of it if you could put it up if
[1:22:44] you could find it I didn't write the
[1:22:45] paragraph down Jesus brought God to
[1:22:49] human
[1:22:50] lives God was was made
[1:22:57] human when Jesus was born God became
[1:23:01] human that he might become fellowship
[1:23:04] with
[1:23:05] men and in
[1:23:14] men the the challenge we run into is the
[1:23:19] devil is in the business of making
[1:23:21] people church members
[1:23:25] I go to church I pay my tithing I do all
[1:23:27] of this no different from any other
[1:23:31] denomination Jesus came to pay for my
[1:23:34] sin yes he did but that was not the end
[1:23:36] of
[1:23:38] it you in your original creation as we
[1:23:42] heard it from the spoken word is the
[1:23:44] Original Seed you were made to be a Son
[1:23:47] of God you were made to be a daughter of
[1:23:50] God Amen so the coming of Jesus was so
[1:23:54] he could be the beginner of this new
[1:23:56] race butam tells us and I want to just
[1:23:58] take this for a moment he was 100% man
[1:24:02] and 100% God so he came to show you that
[1:24:06] within this flesh that a man can be in
[1:24:09] this flesh and live such a Christian
[1:24:12] Life that the devil will run away from
[1:24:16] him he came to be the example example of
[1:24:20] what God veiled in the human flesh
[1:24:24] he was the beginning of that race and so
[1:24:27] if you just take Jesus and leave him on
[1:24:29] the cross and your sin paid for let me
[1:24:32] tell you there's a lot more sin that's
[1:24:33] to come that you're going to
[1:24:36] do don't leave him at the
[1:24:38] cross understand that the payment was
[1:24:41] paid so you can have an entrance into
[1:24:43] this Kingdom and come into the
[1:24:46] realization of who you really
[1:24:49] are Jesus came so you can be God
[1:24:55] he came he came and he was looking for
[1:24:58] God's race he didn't die for all people
[1:25:01] he only died for God's
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:07] race let me just read it let I have
[1:25:10] fellowship with man and in man it says
[1:25:14] what achieve one purpose that is to
[1:25:19] bring to man what God
[1:25:23] is he didn't say what God was what God
[1:25:29] is not what the church is but what God
[1:25:34] is Jesus came that he might present God
[1:25:38] to men and men didn't want
[1:25:42] it let me let me just speed up for a
[1:25:45] little bit paragraph 74 he says the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost comes today in like manner to
[1:25:51] present God to man but man wants to go
[1:25:55] to church drown his in his own in his
[1:25:58] thinking he cannot fom it and when it
[1:26:02] says we must learn that God is not know
[1:26:05] by intellect intellectual conception God
[1:26:09] is known by the New Birth the Holy Ghost
[1:26:12] not by by any other way Jesus the Bible
[1:26:15] is plainly caught as no man call Jesus
[1:26:18] the Christ only by the Holy Ghost if you
[1:26:21] never receive the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:26:24] know what God is what God you don't know
[1:26:27] what he is in Christ in the in the
[1:26:31] Christ for that's the only
[1:26:33] way he reveals
[1:26:37] himself paragraph 84 Jesus says if you
[1:26:41] would have known me you would have known
[1:26:44] my my you would have known my day he
[1:26:47] came to unite God and man God and man
[1:26:50] together he came the only one the angel
[1:26:55] could not have done it none of could
[1:26:57] have could none none could have done it
[1:26:59] but him he came to make God and man
[1:27:04] one don't ever forget that purpose when
[1:27:08] you think about Jesus Christ that's your
[1:27:10] entrance to godship that's your entrance
[1:27:13] into the kingdom of God why he came not
[1:27:16] all just to pay the sin but he came so
[1:27:18] you can have the power so you can have
[1:27:21] the ability to just not be a man but
[1:27:24] become
[1:27:26] God
[1:27:28] hallu 100% man but 100%
[1:27:40] God but when I'm will
[1:27:43] say when he came to the tomb of
[1:27:47] Lazarus he stood
[1:27:50] there he thought about about his friends
[1:27:53] his
[1:27:54] friend and the scripture will say that
[1:27:57] when he went down to the Galilee to be
[1:27:59] baptized he went and got his friend and
[1:28:01] they went down there so he probably
[1:28:03] taught about all those moments and all
[1:28:05] of that the the time the good times that
[1:28:08] they had and the fellowship that they
[1:28:10] had as a man he caused them to cry he
[1:28:14] caused them to weep but he said after
[1:28:16] he' done crying he stood there he says
[1:28:20] Lazarus come forth amen my brother my
[1:28:22] sister when things come to you don't
[1:28:25] just fall in despair it will you will
[1:28:27] you cry yes you will cry but after
[1:28:29] you're done crying remember you are a
[1:28:31] son and a daughter of God stand there
[1:28:34] and dash yourself up and say I'm a son
[1:28:36] and a daughter of God I've been placed
[1:28:39] here for the glory of the Living God I'm
[1:28:41] not going to cry in despair but I stand
[1:28:44] here to speak the word to know that God
[1:28:46] is here to change my
[1:28:48] circumstance whatever happens to me is
[1:28:51] for His glory
[1:28:56] the problem is we only see the
[1:28:58] tear the desper is so high that's all we
[1:29:02] see but we fail to see the resurrection
[1:29:05] that also abides in
[1:29:11] us I said I was only going to be 15
[1:29:20] minutes
[1:29:23] butam
[1:29:25] says in unfilling reality of his word
[1:29:29] paragraph 76 it says now the Holy Ghost
[1:29:33] will not misbehave itself in one person
[1:29:37] and behave himself in
[1:29:40] another it will make each person come
[1:29:44] through its character not the character
[1:29:46] of the man the character of the Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost see because it's the holy spirit
[1:29:50] that leads you it says it brings makes
[1:29:53] you subject to its nature you don't
[1:29:55] bring it subject to your nature it it
[1:29:58] says it makes you subject to its nature
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost makes you live and love
[1:30:03] and do it how many feels like that
[1:30:07] tonight and then you ask see if you have
[1:30:09] the Holy
[1:30:12] Ghost you just lifted your hand when I
[1:30:14] asked that and then you turn around and
[1:30:17] you'll say I don't have the Holy
[1:30:19] Ghost see it's the tactic of the enemy
[1:30:24] do you love God the thing is don't look
[1:30:26] at the ter focus on what it's in you
[1:30:30] that that your desire goes after and put
[1:30:34] all your energy on it and pour all that
[1:30:37] you are on it let it grow let it grow
[1:30:41] until it even overcomes yourself to
[1:30:44] where you don't know what to do with
[1:30:50] yourself the only thing I'll say this
[1:30:53] just play the message play those things
[1:30:55] and see how in the Good Moods you
[1:30:58] become you know it doesn't matter what's
[1:31:01] going on at work and everything how
[1:31:03] stressful you just play and let the
[1:31:05] prophet just begin to lay that word down
[1:31:08] and break down those Mysteries all of
[1:31:10] the sudden you get closer you're
[1:31:12] rewinded did I hear that why is it
[1:31:15] that's your fellowship with him that's
[1:31:17] the sewing of the seed in the heart but
[1:31:20] if you run away from it where you going
[1:31:22] to get it
[1:31:25] from it's the only thing that will
[1:31:28] defeat the
[1:31:29] tear your strength will not do it your
[1:31:33] good heart will not do it your your
[1:31:36] emotions are not going to do it the only
[1:31:39] thing that's going to do it is the word
[1:31:40] of God so let me say this let's swow the
[1:31:43] word of God in our heart let it SE if
[1:31:47] something is going wrong you just keep
[1:31:49] sowing the word you just keep sowing the
[1:31:52] word I can't do this right yeah I know
[1:31:54] but I'm here just sewing the word by the
[1:31:56] time I'm done sewing the word whatever I
[1:31:59] was not able to do the word will make me
[1:32:01] do
[1:32:07] it let me try to find a place to stop I
[1:32:10] could
[1:32:20] just so he says what is it in Oneness it
[1:32:25] says what is it in paragraph 189 he says
[1:32:29] what is it you've got to get with the
[1:32:31] word you got to get with the word get
[1:32:34] yourself killed out it says I'm
[1:32:36] persuaded that many of us friends have
[1:32:39] received the Holy Ghost but we just
[1:32:41] receive enough Holy Ghost to keep us to
[1:32:44] make us to get us to a place that we
[1:32:47] don't want to lie we don't want to uh
[1:32:50] steal we don't don't want to do anything
[1:32:53] but God wants to fill us every fiber of
[1:32:57] his
[1:32:59] church so the reason for the struggle is
[1:33:02] not the lack of the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:33:05] the lack of the fullness of
[1:33:10] it because yeah you are you're doing the
[1:33:13] wrong you're not enjoying it you do it
[1:33:16] and your heart goes oh I can't believe I
[1:33:18] did
[1:33:20] I
[1:33:24] what's doing that something is within
[1:33:27] your heart is not agreeing with what
[1:33:28] you're
[1:33:30] doing so what you need to do is focus on
[1:33:33] that thing that's telling you this is
[1:33:35] not
[1:33:36] okay and feed it more so it goes from
[1:33:39] just this is not okay to where you have
[1:33:42] the strength to actually say forget
[1:33:50] it
[1:33:52] because if you are enjoying it then
[1:33:54] what's the use for the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost the Holy Ghost is there to give
[1:33:59] you the power yes that's what the
[1:34:02] scripture says on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:05] they receive power but one of them says
[1:34:08] they had the word but they didn't have
[1:34:10] the power to operate they what they they
[1:34:12] had the power they like the faith to
[1:34:14] operate it so on the day of the Holy
[1:34:16] Ghost God descended his power so they
[1:34:20] can take that word and bring it into
[1:34:22] manifestation so they knew that they had
[1:34:25] received the seed inside of them so when
[1:34:27] they went to that get beautiful what
[1:34:29] they can say Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:34:31] but that which I have received who gave
[1:34:34] it to them the word gave it to them
[1:34:43] yes now let me say
[1:34:45] this but what I'm talks about
[1:34:49] this the the Satan's
[1:34:52] plan he says now according to this verse
[1:34:55] he says when a man experiences the depth
[1:34:59] of God in his life it's actually a
[1:35:01] personal experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:03] indwelling in
[1:35:05] him it says and his mind is illuminated
[1:35:09] by the wisdom of and the knowledge of
[1:35:11] God through the word but the depths of
[1:35:14] Satan will be that he will attempt to
[1:35:17] destroy this listen to this he will
[1:35:21] always attempt to make a substitute for
[1:35:24] this reality of
[1:35:26] God how will he do it he will he will he
[1:35:30] will take away the knowledge of the
[1:35:32] scripture of God destroy the word by
[1:35:35] putting forth his
[1:35:37] own an
[1:35:40] interpretation something that somebody
[1:35:42] else said something that somebody can
[1:35:44] explain to you he says had he had God
[1:35:49] said he will then substitute the
[1:35:52] personal Christ in our spirit he will do
[1:35:57] it as he caused as it as he caused
[1:36:00] Israel to do the same by a human being
[1:36:04] reigning as King instead of God being
[1:36:08] born again experience will will be
[1:36:10] rejected in favor of joining of church
[1:36:13] joining the depths of Satan has been
[1:36:16] entered into into in that age it says
[1:36:21] and the fruits of the depths of Satan
[1:36:23] which are lies murderous hor horrible
[1:36:27] crimes came forth from
[1:36:35] it I think that's why we have to guard
[1:36:38] against the guard the word in our
[1:36:41] hearts and guard against excuse me for
[1:36:44] one
[1:36:50] second
[1:37:00] that's why it's important that when when
[1:37:03] when we we come to church or when we
[1:37:05] read our Bibles we have to be connected
[1:37:07] with this message we have connected be
[1:37:10] connected with this word we can't just
[1:37:13] sit around and and exchange our own
[1:37:15] intellect and our own understanding and
[1:37:17] think we got the word we have to know
[1:37:19] what is it that God promised for us us
[1:37:21] what is it that God promised in this age
[1:37:24] because what Satan will come to do is to
[1:37:26] try to inject things to cause you to be
[1:37:30] disbelieve the very word to disbelieve
[1:37:33] what the original word which you
[1:37:36] are and it will cause you to believe a
[1:37:39] substitute which you are not and by
[1:37:41] believing a substitute you will act
[1:37:44] according to the
[1:37:47] substitute the prophet says this in the
[1:37:49] message The Thirst he says
[1:37:51] so therefore oh he says therefore no
[1:37:55] matter how much a church says that
[1:37:58] anyone else would say if you are born of
[1:38:01] the spirit of God you become part of the
[1:38:06] Bible amen if you are born if you are
[1:38:10] born of the spirit of go God you become
[1:38:13] part of the Bible paragraph 64 it says
[1:38:17] it says you you become part of the you
[1:38:19] become part of the Bible he says God
[1:38:22] told Ezekiel it says Ezekiel the prophet
[1:38:25] he said take the scroll and eat it then
[1:38:29] the prophet and the scroll became part
[1:38:32] of each
[1:38:35] other oh my brother my sister is it
[1:38:38] remind you of anybody John was told to
[1:38:41] eat the scroll him and the scroll they
[1:38:44] become part of each other why because
[1:38:46] when the seed of God is in you it causes
[1:38:49] you to speak the word to add the word to
[1:38:52] think the word to to to do everything
[1:38:55] based on the word it's not longer your
[1:38:57] own thinking it becomes the word
[1:39:00] thinking so they become part of each
[1:39:02] other and that's the Believers when he
[1:39:06] receives the Holy Ghost the holy ghost
[1:39:08] that wrote the word the Holy Ghost it
[1:39:11] says the spirit of God is the word of
[1:39:16] God the spirit of God is the word of God
[1:39:20] my words are spirit in the beginning was
[1:39:22] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:39:24] the Word was made and and the Word was
[1:39:27] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:39:30] dwell Among Us Hebrews 13 and8 it says
[1:39:33] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:39:35] forever and when you are part of the
[1:39:37] word oh he says oh he says then let
[1:39:41] something come up contrary to that word
[1:39:44] butam he says snaps his fingers there's
[1:39:47] a little buzzer set off quickly see
[1:39:51] that's to warn you that death is on its
[1:39:55] Road it's on the
[1:39:58] road you should never do
[1:40:03] that but if the word is not in
[1:40:06] there all it is is a bunch of
[1:40:09] explanation then how's the buzzer go
[1:40:15] off the scripture says we are partakers
[1:40:17] of divine
[1:40:19] nature how do we partake the divine
[1:40:21] nature by this precious
[1:40:24] promises we become partakers of divine
[1:40:27] nature what is it that it does it brings
[1:40:30] us subject to the nature of God we
[1:40:33] become like God we become in the nature
[1:40:37] of God that was in us to begin with not
[1:40:40] that we receive foram says that it's not
[1:40:43] taking a week and become the Cocker bird
[1:40:45] it says it was a if a we was a we to
[1:40:48] begin with it could it could have acted
[1:40:50] as a bird but if you take it and
[1:40:52] you take it through to the original it
[1:40:55] was a weat to begin with but you
[1:40:57] couldn't change a Cocker bird from a
[1:40:58] weed or vice
[1:41:01] versa in the fourth seal it says if the
[1:41:03] musician could come paragraph
[1:41:07] 67 the word it the word itself is
[1:41:12] spirit it's spirit in word
[1:41:17] form and then you see when it's Quicken
[1:41:21] or brought to life the spirit of the
[1:41:25] word goes to work and acts if you could
[1:41:28] put it there the four seal um uh
[1:41:32] paragraph
[1:41:34] 67 because look here a
[1:41:38] thought has to be a thought before it
[1:41:40] can be word that's right and then when
[1:41:43] the thought is presented its word
[1:41:49] amen now this is God's
[1:41:52] thought God is the spirit so his thought
[1:41:56] is the
[1:41:57] word his thought when he speaks his
[1:41:59] thought it becomes the word god thought
[1:42:02] that he had placed in the word so the
[1:42:06] word is the thoughts of God being
[1:42:09] expressed and then when you receive it
[1:42:12] from him it becomes a
[1:42:18] word oh my
[1:42:21] what a place what a
[1:42:26] blessing it says here is the most
[1:42:28] evidence set forth that the perfect
[1:42:31] manifestation of God in his son was by
[1:42:33] his indwelling Spirit manifesting his
[1:42:36] word and
[1:42:38] works it says this is exactly what we
[1:42:41] have been teaching all along when the
[1:42:44] bride will get back to being a word
[1:42:48] bride not just any bride a word word
[1:42:51] bride the word bride one who has
[1:42:54] received the word of
[1:42:57] God she will produce the very works that
[1:43:00] Jesus produced the word is God the
[1:43:04] spirit is God they are all
[1:43:08] one one cannot cannot work apart from
[1:43:12] the other if one truly has the spirit of
[1:43:15] God he will have the word of
[1:43:18] God that is how it is is with the
[1:43:21] prophet they had the indwelling spirit
[1:43:24] of God and the word came to them that is
[1:43:28] how it was with Jesus in him was the
[1:43:31] spirit without measure and the word came
[1:43:34] to him Jesus both he says Jesus both
[1:43:37] began to do and teach my Doctrine is not
[1:43:41] my own but the fathers that sent me acts
[1:43:45] 1 and 1 in John 7 and6 let's all stand
[1:43:52] so if I want to just encourage us
[1:43:54] tonight once again oh I don't want you
[1:43:56] to forget that what is it that's in you
[1:44:01] though this flesh came as part of the
[1:44:04] hybrid it's got a lot of things planted
[1:44:07] in it it's got a lot of things that we
[1:44:09] inherit for our parents a lot of things
[1:44:11] we inherit for bad habits and friends
[1:44:14] that have taught us wrong things and
[1:44:16] things that we have picked up along the
[1:44:18] way and where we were hanging at
[1:44:21] but there's one thing that works for you
[1:44:23] that within that that that flesh God has
[1:44:26] planted his own seed so tonight if I
[1:44:29] could say anything I don't want you to
[1:44:32] take all your focus and continue to
[1:44:34] worry about the things you cannot do
[1:44:37] continue to focus on the what's wrong
[1:44:39] with you oh I can't talk right I can't
[1:44:42] think right I can't do this right let me
[1:44:44] tell you as long as you are in this V
[1:44:46] there's always going to be something
[1:44:48] that you can't do
[1:44:49] right
[1:44:51] but oh there's something that if you put
[1:44:53] all your energy to it if you put all
[1:44:56] your focus to it it will change your
[1:44:58] life forever there's one thing that if
[1:45:00] you will believe it if you'll pour all
[1:45:02] that you have on it if you will let it
[1:45:05] grow if you will let those things which
[1:45:07] you cannot do it will bring it to pass
[1:45:10] one by one it will bring it in
[1:45:12] manifestation why because the word our
[1:45:16] pastor read the other time he said the
[1:45:18] word is the only seed of life
[1:45:22] amen it's the only seed of eternal
[1:45:25] life if you want to receive the eternal
[1:45:28] life receive the word but Ram says but R
[1:45:34] I'm told us he says if you want deity in
[1:45:36] your
[1:45:37] mids it says receive the word of God you
[1:45:41] want change in your life tonight receive
[1:45:44] the word of God there's things that are
[1:45:46] not going okay there's things that you
[1:45:49] want to change there's things that you
[1:45:50] want to see happen there is in your life
[1:45:53] you want the Holy Ghost receive the word
[1:45:56] if you receive the word you will now
[1:45:59] have the seed and therefore you have the
[1:46:01] right for that seed to come into
[1:46:03] manifestation in your life when you have
[1:46:06] received the seed you have the right to
[1:46:08] the
[1:46:08] fruit why because every seed will bring
[1:46:12] forth of its kind but if you don't have
[1:46:14] the seed you can't have the fruits of it
[1:46:16] by receiving the seed you allow for the
[1:46:19] fruits to come in to manifestation our

[1:53:29] upon your
[1:53:30] life oh I was I was just thinking well
[1:53:34] brother Billy was preaching the image
[1:53:36] came to my
[1:53:38] heart how this seed this wheat
[1:53:41] seed when it's tested when it's tried
[1:53:45] you know what it does it it becomes
[1:53:48] flower right because of the trials of
[1:53:51] life and all the things that come upon
[1:53:53] you and then God comes and Waters this
[1:53:56] flower this this wheat that has been
[1:53:58] crushed by
[1:54:01] life the life of Jesus Christ the
[1:54:04] overcoming power and becomes
[1:54:07] bread and now we dwell in the place
[1:54:09] called
[1:54:10] Bethlehem the house of God's bread that
[1:54:13] inner man that that that holies of
[1:54:18] holies
[1:54:20] because there was a wheat that was sent
[1:54:22] that was
[1:54:23] original that he planted it was his own
[1:54:27] he knew them by
[1:54:29] name and he sent his word to be able to
[1:54:32] bring them to a maturity so he can
[1:54:34] gather them all together oh I don't know
[1:54:37] but that's Mercy cuz I was lost one day
[1:54:41] I really
[1:54:42] was and there was Mother Eagle that word
[1:54:45] that was looking for
[1:54:46] me and didn't let me sit in denomination
[1:54:50] ation I was there 20 years but God took
[1:54:54] me out by a word
[1:54:58] yes that's Mercy Saints no man can teach
[1:55:02] that no man could give you that no man
[1:55:05] could bring that to a revelation to you
[1:55:07] it's God himself so if God gave it to
[1:55:11] you why not take it why not receive it
[1:55:15] and when you receive it what it does it
[1:55:17] produces life
[1:55:20] it produces the original Adam that was
[1:55:23] in the
[1:55:25] beginning so now you have access not by
