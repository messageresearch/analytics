[19:58] thank you once again
[20:00] and give you all the praise the glory
[20:01] and the admiration
[20:03] the precious name of the lord jesus
[20:05] christ we pray
[20:07] amen
[20:08] [Music]
[20:11] amen god bless you once again this
[20:13] morning as you invite brother mike for
[20:15] so i'm reading we welcome our visitors
[20:16] this morning god bless you
[20:41] you know jesus said in
[20:44] well he was speaking to the people
[20:46] in what we call the sermon on the mount
[20:50] he made a statement in matthew chapter
[20:53] five and verse five it said this just a
[20:55] short simple statement
[20:57] it says blessed are the meek
[21:00] for they shall inherit the earth
[21:04] you know it's such a simple statement
[21:09] but how significant that is
[21:13] the meek
[21:15] shall inherit the earth
[21:19] the earth
[21:21] not by effort
[21:24] not bought with riches
[21:28] but inherited
[21:31] you know that
[21:33] word inherit
[21:35] means this to come into possession of or
[21:38] to receive
[21:41] especially as a right or a divine
[21:44] portion
[21:47] jesus said that somebody
[21:51] inherits
[21:53] receives as a gift
[21:56] the earth
[21:59] you know i was
[22:01] thinking about how you look out at the
[22:03] world today and how everybody seems to
[22:08] struggle and fight
[22:10] for their little piece of the earth
[22:14] you know they
[22:17] working as hard as they can gathering as
[22:19] many riches as they can obtaining as
[22:21] many possessions as they can
[22:25] you know fighting with one another for
[22:28] control and for ownership and for
[22:30] accomplishment and
[22:32] you know when things don't go their way
[22:34] or when they see another person as an
[22:36] obstacle to what they'd like to get they
[22:38] get all stirred up they get
[22:41] angry they get frustrated they
[22:44] they attack one another
[22:46] they kill themselves
[22:48] trying to obtain
[22:50] what is going to be given away as a gift
[22:55] you know and no matter how hard
[22:58] the world works to obtain their little
[23:01] piece the earth
[23:03] it's already
[23:05] spoken for it's going to be given away
[23:10] you know when you read that the meek
[23:12] shall inherit the earth it causes this
[23:15] at least caused me to think
[23:17] kind of two things first of all
[23:20] it's probably not worth any time at all
[23:24] worrying about
[23:25] what you're gonna get or gather or
[23:28] accomplish or
[23:29] save up
[23:31] just gonna be given away anyway
[23:34] but second of all it makes me wonder
[23:37] who's the meek
[23:40] who are these ones that are going to
[23:42] inherit
[23:44] the earth
[23:46] what does it mean
[23:48] to be meek
[23:52] you know that's not another word that's
[23:53] not used in the scripture very often
[23:56] meek
[23:57] you know i think it's half maybe a dozen
[24:00] times it's mentioned but
[24:02] you know moses is mentioned in in
[24:04] numbers as being the meekest man on the
[24:06] earth
[24:08] but what is the meek what does it mean
[24:10] to be meek who are the meek
[24:13] well as we look at
[24:15] psalm 37 this morning
[24:18] this psalm
[24:21] talks about
[24:22] the me
[24:25] and you know what's interesting is jesus
[24:27] said in mark 8 36 for what shall it
[24:30] profit a man
[24:31] if he shall gain the whole world
[24:34] and lose his own soul
[24:37] and yet he describes there being someone
[24:40] who inherits
[24:41] the earth
[24:43] i'm going to read about that in psalm 37
[24:45] this morning it speaks about those who
[24:48] inherit the earth five times
[24:50] it uses the phrase
[24:52] inherit the earth
[24:54] that's a phrase that's really not used
[24:56] anywhere else other than when jesus said
[24:58] it and then here in psalm 37
[25:02] so in this chapter are the keys to the
[25:05] meek
[25:06] and
[25:07] how
[25:09] to inherit the earth
[25:12] in its very first verse
[25:14] the very first statement the very first
[25:17] characteristic
[25:19] don't fret
[25:23] no matter what's going on around you
[25:25] fret not
[25:26] thyself don't allow yourself to get
[25:29] stirred up by what's going on around you
[25:32] what's happening around you
[25:34] the meek
[25:35] shall inherit the earth
[25:39] you know it's
[25:40] uh what's interesting is three times in
[25:44] this chapter it cautions us to fret not
[25:48] you know among the many things that
[25:50] brother branham taught us when the
[25:52] scriptures repeat themselves
[25:54] we should pay attention
[25:58] in fact it goes on in verse 10 for yet a
[26:00] little while
[26:02] and the wicked shall not be
[26:05] yea thou shalt diligently consider his
[26:08] place
[26:09] and it shall not be
[26:11] fret not thy so
[26:14] here's another key
[26:15] verse 3
[26:17] trust in the lord
[26:19] and do good
[26:21] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[26:23] verily
[26:25] thou shalt be fed
[26:27] trust in the lord in fact it says in
[26:30] verse 25
[26:32] i have been young
[26:34] and now i'm old
[26:36] yet have i not seen the righteous
[26:38] forsaken
[26:40] nor his seed begging bread
[26:42] trust in the lord
[26:44] the meek shall inherit the earth
[26:48] here's another one verse 4
[26:50] delight thyself in the lord
[26:54] and he shall give thee the desires of
[26:57] thine heart
[26:58] well if your desire is him
[27:01] then he'll give you
[27:03] your desire
[27:06] here's another one verse 5 commit thy
[27:09] way
[27:10] unto the lord
[27:12] trust also in him and he
[27:15] shall bring it
[27:16] to pass
[27:19] it says in verse 23 the steps of a good
[27:22] man are ordered by the lord
[27:25] and he
[27:26] delighteth
[27:28] in his way
[27:29] there's that word again
[27:32] verse 24 though he fall
[27:35] he shall not utterly be cast down
[27:38] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[27:42] the meek shall inherit the earth
[27:47] seems like an odd way to inherit all
[27:49] things
[27:51] gets better verse 7
[27:54] rest in the lord
[27:56] and wait patiently for him
[27:59] and then once again a reminder not to
[28:01] fret
[28:03] verse 34 it says wait on the lord
[28:06] and keep his way
[28:08] and he shall exalt thee to inherit the
[28:10] land
[28:12] when the wicked are cut off thou shalt
[28:15] see it
[28:17] here's another one verse eight
[28:20] cease from anger
[28:23] and another reminder
[28:25] not to fret
[28:28] not to fret thyself in any wise in fact
[28:31] it says in verse 8 that doing that he
[28:34] calls that doing evil
[28:39] you know it turns out that the keys to
[28:41] inheriting the earth are not
[28:43] outsmarting out fighting
[28:45] out working out spending out thinking
[28:50] it's resting
[28:51] it's trusting
[28:53] it's committing yourself to him
[28:56] it's not fretting it's not being angry
[28:59] the meek
[29:00] shall inherit the earth
[29:04] you know as we read psalm 37 this
[29:06] morning it's a bit of a longer chapter
[29:08] but i think it's important
[29:10] that as we read this we consider
[29:14] that the meek shall inherit the earth
[29:18] and this is the key to that inheritance
[29:21] trust in him
[29:22] commit your ways to him
[29:25] i've never seen the righteous beg bread
[29:28] he commits the steps of a good man
[29:31] let's read that together psalm 37
[29:34] starting in verse 1 fret not thyself
[29:36] because of evildoers neither be thou
[29:39] envious against the workers of iniquity
[29:41] for they shall soon be cut down like the
[29:44] grass and wither as the green herb
[29:46] trust in the lord and do good so shalt
[29:49] thou dwell in the land and verily thou
[29:52] shalt be fed delight thyself also in the
[29:55] lord and he shall give thee the desires
[29:57] of thine heart commit thy way unto the
[30:00] lord trust also in him and he shall
[30:03] bring it to pass
[30:04] and he shall bring forth thy
[30:06] righteousness as the light and thy
[30:08] judgment as the noonday
[30:10] rest in the lord and wait patiently for
[30:12] him for it not thyself because of him
[30:15] who prospereth in his way because of the
[30:17] man who bringeth wicked devices to pass
[30:20] cease from anger and forsake wrath fret
[30:23] not thyself in any wise to do evil for
[30:26] evil doers shall be cut off but those
[30:29] that wait upon the lord they shall
[30:31] inherit the earth for yet a little while
[30:34] and the wicked shall not be yea thou
[30:36] shalt diligently consider his place and
[30:39] it shall not be but the meek shall
[30:41] inherit the earth and shall delight
[30:43] themselves in the abundance of peace the
[30:46] wicked plotteth against the just and
[30:48] gnasheth upon him with his teeth
[30:50] the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth
[30:53] that his day is coming the wicked have
[30:55] drawn out the sword and have bent their
[30:58] bow to cast down the poor and needy and
[31:00] to slay such as be of an upright
[31:03] conversation their sword shall enter
[31:05] their own heart and their bows shall be
[31:07] broken a little that a righteous man
[31:10] hath is better than the riches of many
[31:12] wicked but the arms of the wicked shall
[31:15] be broken but the lord upholdeth the
[31:17] righteous the lord knoweth the days of
[31:19] the upright and their inheritance shall
[31:22] be forever they shall not be ashamed in
[31:24] the evil time and in the days of famine
[31:27] they shall be satisfied but the wicked
[31:29] shall perish and the enemies of the lord
[31:32] shall be as the fat of lambs they shall
[31:34] consume into smoke shall they consume
[31:37] away the wicked borroweth and payeth not
[31:40] again but the righteous showeth mercy
[31:42] and giveth for such as be blessed of him
[31:45] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[31:47] cursed of him shall be cut off
[31:50] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[31:52] the lord and he delighteth in his way
[31:55] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[31:57] cast down for the lord upholdeth him
[32:00] with his hand i have been young and now
[32:03] em old yet have i not seen the righteous
[32:05] forsaken nor his seed begging bread he
[32:08] is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[32:11] seed is blessed depart from evil and do
[32:14] good and dwell forevermore for the lord
[32:17] loveth judgment and forsaketh not his
[32:19] saints they are preserved forever but
[32:22] the seed of the wicked shall be cut off
[32:24] the righteous shall inherit the land and
[32:26] dwell therein forever
[32:28] the mouth of the righteous speaketh
[32:30] wisdom and his tongue talketh of
[32:32] judgment the law of his god is in his
[32:34] heart none of his steps shall slide the
[32:37] wicked watcheth the righteous and seek
[32:39] it to slay him the lord will not leave
[32:42] him in his hand nor condemn him when he
[32:44] is judged wait on the lord and keep his
[32:47] way and he shall exalt thee to inherit
[32:50] the land when the wicked are cut off
[32:52] thou shalt see it i have seen the wicked
[32:55] in great power and spreading himself
[32:57] like a green bay tree yet he passed away
[33:00] and lo he was not yea i sought him but
[33:03] he could not be found
[33:05] mark the perfect man and behold the
[33:07] upright for the end of that man is peace
[33:10] but the transgressors shall be destroyed
[33:12] together and the end of the wicked shall
[33:15] be cut off but the salvation of the
[33:17] righteous is of the lord he is their
[33:19] strength in the time of trouble and the
[33:22] lord shall help them and deliver them he
[33:24] shall deliver them from the wicked and
[33:26] save them because they trust in him amen

[1:03:38] amen our gracious father
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:43] you did not give man the vocabulary
[1:03:47] to describe your greatness
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:51] lord or the mind
[1:03:54] to
[1:03:55] comprehend you
[1:03:58] for he said the kingdom of god is within
[1:04:00] you that you can neither know the
[1:04:02] beginning or the end of it
[1:04:05] lord your majesty is laid before us
[1:04:09] in all the things we see around us for
[1:04:12] the invisible things of god are clearly
[1:04:15] seen in the invisible things about us
[1:04:18] lord we
[1:04:20] just appreciate you this morning
[1:04:23] we thank you for the wonderful
[1:04:25] testimonies that
[1:04:27] we've heard father our hearts leap with
[1:04:30] joanne
[1:04:31] to see so many more wonderful things
[1:04:34] that are going to come to pass
[1:04:36] we ask you to help us this morning
[1:04:38] forgive us our trespasses father may
[1:04:41] your word stand in its solemn place
[1:04:45] father
[1:04:46] because it's of its own merits
[1:04:48] we ask you to bless us now
[1:04:51] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[1:04:55] amen if you have your bibles this
[1:04:57] morning
[1:05:02] so we're going to
[1:05:05] go into a little something this morning
[1:05:08] and it may take a little while
[1:05:11] so
[1:05:12] you only have one service today
[1:05:15] so i'm
[1:05:16] going to use the technique of my
[1:05:20] friend to the east he just has one
[1:05:22] service but it's long
[1:05:27] but i hope you'll enjoy the word
[1:05:30] brother mike certainly spoke to me this
[1:05:33] morning
[1:05:34] i'm one of those kind of people
[1:05:37] you know i'm a presser
[1:05:39] and i push and i press and you know it
[1:05:41] comes with your nature
[1:05:43] you know he comes with your name you
[1:05:45] know i i'm named david you know i like
[1:05:48] killing giants
[1:05:50] and i i like getting things done
[1:05:53] you know brother graham says that's one
[1:05:55] thing about about a leader nobody likes
[1:05:58] them
[1:05:59] much you know
[1:06:00] so i've heard that they hate it when i
[1:06:03] walk through the door at the city
[1:06:05] but
[1:06:07] you got overcome you know so everybody's
[1:06:09] got something he's got to overcome
[1:06:12] and there's nothing that helps you
[1:06:13] overcome like the word of god
[1:06:15] so we just take the word of god we take
[1:06:18] it to heart
[1:06:19] we ask for his grace and mercy to give
[1:06:22] us the strength
[1:06:24] to be
[1:06:25] uh
[1:06:27] in that rest
[1:06:29] that he has you know but i certainly
[1:06:31] know what it's like to be bought from
[1:06:33] the sheepfold i wasn't exactly brought
[1:06:36] from the sheepfold i was bought from
[1:06:38] the hippie fold
[1:06:40] and so but god's wonderful to us but i i
[1:06:44] want to share something with you this
[1:06:46] morning
[1:06:48] and if i had a title for it
[1:06:51] i'd call it the two voices
[1:06:54] of the third pull
[1:06:57] the two voices
[1:06:59] of the third pole and i hope it's a
[1:07:01] blessing to you this morning
[1:07:04] brother ben makes the statement in
[1:07:06] perfect faith he says i believe we're
[1:07:09] mature enough out of the church to go
[1:07:12] into some deeper things
[1:07:14] so we certainly want to do that so let's
[1:07:16] turn in our bibles
[1:07:18] to hebrews
[1:07:21] the 4th chapter
[1:07:25] and the 12th verse the fourth chapter
[1:07:30] and the 12th verse
[1:07:32] of hebrews
[1:07:37] this morning
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:41] and we just trust that this will unfold
[1:07:43] we're going to listen to like 10 minutes
[1:07:45] of a sermon this morning to set up
[1:07:50] where that
[1:07:51] we're going and why we're going there
[1:07:55] and it says
[1:07:56] for the word of god is quicker
[1:08:00] and powerful
[1:08:02] and sharper
[1:08:04] than any two-edged sword
[1:08:07] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:08:12] of soul and spirit
[1:08:14] now that's
[1:08:16] pretty deep
[1:08:18] so we know that the word of god will
[1:08:21] press deep
[1:08:22] into our hearts
[1:08:24] even to the separating
[1:08:28] of
[1:08:28] the soul in the spirit if i could say
[1:08:31] that
[1:08:32] to the separating of what is god's
[1:08:35] and what is man's so that's what the
[1:08:39] word of god does it separates what is
[1:08:42] god and what is man the word of god will
[1:08:45] separate what is your flesh
[1:08:47] and what is your spirit because these
[1:08:50] two things war against each other and
[1:08:54] you have that battle within you
[1:08:56] and
[1:08:57] and so it says dividing us under the
[1:09:00] soul and the spirit
[1:09:02] and the joint in the marrow as in a
[1:09:06] discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:09:10] of the heart
[1:09:13] neither is there any creature
[1:09:16] that is not
[1:09:18] manifest in his sight
[1:09:22] but all things are naked and open un
[1:09:26] to the eyes of him
[1:09:29] with whom we have
[1:09:31] to do
[1:09:33] amen so nothing's here
[1:09:35] he knows us right this today
[1:09:38] and yet he still loved us
[1:09:41] and he still went to cavalry for us and
[1:09:44] he still forgave us let us bow our heads
[1:09:46] as we
[1:09:48] pray our father we asked this morning
[1:09:50] that you would help us
[1:09:52] bring this thought that you put on our
[1:09:54] heart
[1:09:56] may the people be very uplifted by it
[1:10:00] father may they
[1:10:02] realize
[1:10:04] where we are and what's transpiring
[1:10:08] and have a vision of the hour they live
[1:10:11] in
[1:10:13] recognize the day and their message
[1:10:15] father
[1:10:16] give us i savv this morning that we
[1:10:20] might see i ask you to forgive me
[1:10:22] of all my shortcomings father my
[1:10:24] weaknesses
[1:10:26] father but your word stands above any
[1:10:28] man any personality
[1:10:31] father it's true
[1:10:34] like the song says your god no matter
[1:10:37] where i am
[1:10:39] you're still the great
[1:10:41] creator
[1:10:43] we ask you to touch the people's hearts
[1:10:45] today in jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:10:49] god bless you may be seated
[1:10:59] this
[1:11:01] came upon my heart
[1:11:05] last week as
[1:11:07] we
[1:11:09] preached
[1:11:10] a
[1:11:11] sermon last sunday
[1:11:14] many of you are here and we were talking
[1:11:17] about the battle
[1:11:18] that's going on for our mind
[1:11:21] and we realize there's a great battle
[1:11:24] for our thinking going on that's where
[1:11:26] the battle is
[1:11:27] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:11:30] was in our mind
[1:11:32] and
[1:11:33] we
[1:11:35] as we
[1:11:36] read that and as we
[1:11:38] preached on that we came to the
[1:11:41] conclusion
[1:11:43] by reading the statements that our
[1:11:45] messenger made
[1:11:47] that the word of god is not made to be
[1:11:51] reasoned with
[1:11:53] it's only made to believe
[1:11:57] and that's like you can if i was to take
[1:12:00] you out into the lot next door
[1:12:03] and get a piece of rebarb
[1:12:05] you know rebarb is a thin
[1:12:09] metal
[1:12:10] steel bar that's used to
[1:12:13] reinforce concrete
[1:12:16] and say eat this
[1:12:19] well you would respond to me it's not
[1:12:22] made to be eaten
[1:12:25] it's not what it's made for well the
[1:12:27] word of god is not made to be figured
[1:12:30] out
[1:12:31] it's not made to
[1:12:34] be reasoned with it's not made to be
[1:12:37] logical
[1:12:40] that's the kind of god we serve we he
[1:12:43] does he does he's an
[1:12:45] unexpected god doing things in
[1:12:47] unexpected ways his ways are what beyond
[1:12:51] finding out
[1:12:53] god has no reasoning but his own reason
[1:12:57] and he's not obligated to share that
[1:13:00] with us
[1:13:01] but what he has done for us is he's
[1:13:04] placed something within us to believe
[1:13:09] and that's how the word of god is it's
[1:13:12] accepted
[1:13:13] it's believed it's just like forgiveness
[1:13:16] of sins he's forgiven your sins
[1:13:20] but it will never do you any good till
[1:13:23] you accept that forgiveness and act
[1:13:26] accordingly
[1:13:28] one day you've got to lay down the
[1:13:30] regret
[1:13:31] you've got to lay down the memories
[1:13:33] you've got to lay down the past
[1:13:36] draw a line in the sand with the blood
[1:13:39] of the lord jesus christ and not walk
[1:13:42] back past it
[1:13:44] you know what i mean and he did that for
[1:13:47] you while you were yet a sinner he died
[1:13:50] for you
[1:13:51] so the gospel is not what saves you the
[1:13:54] gospel brings you the news of that
[1:13:58] salvation so it's good news
[1:14:01] and if you can believe it and accept it
[1:14:06] and
[1:14:06] tape it as your
[1:14:09] possession
[1:14:10] then you work according to what that you
[1:14:14] have
[1:14:15] peter worked according to what he had
[1:14:18] silver and gold have i none but i have
[1:14:21] got something i was in a room
[1:14:25] a parent the other day and the pillars
[1:14:28] of fire came in licks of fire and his
[1:14:31] holy spirit came down his presence the
[1:14:34] same one i walked with
[1:14:37] and i talked with and i knew the one
[1:14:40] that called me out upon the water
[1:14:43] to walk upon the water and bid me to
[1:14:45] come i knew his spirit i knew his nature
[1:14:49] and i we were in this room praying and
[1:14:52] all of a sudden rushing mighty wind came
[1:14:54] and that same
[1:14:56] person that same nature that same spirit
[1:15:01] came and it dwelt in me
[1:15:03] and you know that promise is for you and
[1:15:06] for your children and as many as our are
[1:15:10] far off and as many are called the
[1:15:13] indwelling presence of the lord jesus
[1:15:17] christ the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:15:20] the evidence of it is jesus christ made
[1:15:24] known personally
[1:15:26] to you
[1:15:27] or in you
[1:15:29] and so he he was there and he began to
[1:15:33] to to speak
[1:15:35] of these
[1:15:36] great things that god did so he had it
[1:15:40] it's a possession so the word of god is
[1:15:43] always
[1:15:45] preached
[1:15:47] but it but it's always to the ears of
[1:15:50] the hearer let them who hear these
[1:15:54] things
[1:15:55] to him who hath ears to hear
[1:15:59] and that is a blessing
[1:16:03] that you should always thank god for
[1:16:06] that you have ears to hear
[1:16:09] that's why god put certain of you in
[1:16:12] certain homes
[1:16:13] because that would be the way that you
[1:16:15] would hear
[1:16:17] others come other ways
[1:16:19] amen i would love to have been
[1:16:22] raised up
[1:16:23] in a message home
[1:16:25] i was raised up in a catholic home
[1:16:30] you know and there was things that were
[1:16:33] but it led me
[1:16:35] to go astray but i'm so thankful that
[1:16:38] the good shepherd
[1:16:40] he doesn't forsake his own
[1:16:43] and so i always want to encourage you
[1:16:46] about your children they're part of your
[1:16:48] inheritance they're part of your reward
[1:16:53] if you live for god god will reward you
[1:16:56] with your children
[1:17:00] and and i i i will hold true to that
[1:17:04] with all my heart i'll stand with any
[1:17:07] parent any
[1:17:08] uh person that's holding on for a loved
[1:17:11] one
[1:17:12] never
[1:17:13] ever
[1:17:14] let that slip
[1:17:16] from you
[1:17:18] so we as we begin to
[1:17:21] preach
[1:17:22] last week
[1:17:24] i begin to mention
[1:17:28] to you about the sermons
[1:17:31] that were being preached dear in
[1:17:35] 61 and 62 and the 60s and that time
[1:17:40] frame
[1:17:41] in there the prophet of god talks about
[1:17:43] there was a period
[1:17:45] between his
[1:17:46] uh ministry so we know brother bram's
[1:17:49] ministry was based
[1:17:51] in three parts right or three polls he
[1:17:54] tried to explain it he he had a vision
[1:17:59] and
[1:18:00] many of you
[1:18:02] you know that the lord dealt with the
[1:18:04] prophet by vision he would catch him up
[1:18:07] he would show him things and then he
[1:18:09] would reveal to him things he would
[1:18:12] correct him by visions and speak to him
[1:18:14] by vision and a prophet god speaks to
[1:18:18] audibly
[1:18:19] lip to ear
[1:18:21] and everything that god
[1:18:24] does
[1:18:26] is based in prophecy
[1:18:30] okay everything that god does is based
[1:18:34] in prophecy
[1:18:36] because god can do nothing unless he
[1:18:39] first reveals it to his servants the
[1:18:42] prophet
[1:18:43] you you think that you might think when
[1:18:46] you go back and read the book of genesis
[1:18:50] but that was written by a
[1:18:52] prophet in sun-dried times and by
[1:18:56] diverse manners the spirit of god moved
[1:18:59] upon the prophets and they wrote
[1:19:01] scripture so everything that we do is
[1:19:04] based in prophecy because the spoken
[1:19:08] word is the original seed
[1:19:12] so the before it was recorded it was
[1:19:16] spoken
[1:19:18] so command's interpretation
[1:19:21] many times get mixed up
[1:19:24] that's why god doesn't rely on
[1:19:27] interpretation of man he relies on
[1:19:30] revelation
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] i remember aaron shared with me
[1:19:36] something and it really
[1:19:37] struck me in his heart
[1:19:39] there was a great court proceeding
[1:19:42] going on and in the court there were two
[1:19:45] attorneys
[1:19:47] one attorney is a well-known
[1:19:51] professor and the other attorney
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] the one attorney looked to the judge
[1:19:58] and he said your honor
[1:20:01] i believe when the man that wrote this
[1:20:05] piece of legislation and this law
[1:20:09] i believe this is what he meant
[1:20:13] and the other attorney stood up and said
[1:20:15] your honor i'll tell you exactly what i
[1:20:18] meant when i wrote that
[1:20:26] you know what i mean so i don't want
[1:20:28] somebody telling me what he meant i want
[1:20:30] him to tell me what he meant
[1:20:34] and that's what he built the church on
[1:20:37] is revelation
[1:20:39] and so everything is based within
[1:20:42] prophecy
[1:20:46] okay so
[1:20:48] this morning we are living
[1:20:52] what was spoken of us
[1:20:54] to live
[1:20:58] you understand that
[1:21:02] you we think that
[1:21:04] we are
[1:21:05] uh
[1:21:06] we think that we have so much of our own
[1:21:09] way but the word of god says the
[1:21:11] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:21:14] by the lord so let me put this in
[1:21:16] another context for you the footsteps of
[1:21:19] the righteous are prophesied
[1:21:21] by the lord
[1:21:24] that's how
[1:21:25] god orders things is by prophecy
[1:21:29] this is what it'll be this is what it'll
[1:21:31] be this is what it'll be
[1:21:34] because
[1:21:35] everybody's taught
[1:21:38] from the earthly standpoint and the
[1:21:41] religious standpoint is that people
[1:21:44] preach a bunch of rules and a bunch of
[1:21:46] guidelines and it's like you follow it
[1:21:49] like a road map and you keep these
[1:21:51] creeds and dogmas and and you have these
[1:21:54] experiences and you get to heaven no he
[1:21:57] knows where point one started he knows
[1:22:00] where it's again he's alpha and omega
[1:22:02] the beginning to end and he's bringing
[1:22:05] things to pass we are foreordained unto
[1:22:09] good works that we should walk in them
[1:22:11] for the purpose of his will
[1:22:15] and so understanding that these things
[1:22:17] are brought forth
[1:22:19] in prophecy
[1:22:22] we understand that brother brown's
[1:22:24] ministry
[1:22:26] he had a vision explained it in three
[1:22:28] polls
[1:22:29] the first poll
[1:22:31] was the taking of the hand
[1:22:35] he would take his left hand and take it
[1:22:38] to
[1:22:39] a person's
[1:22:41] right hand
[1:22:42] and he would feel the vibrations and
[1:22:45] through these vibrations he would know i
[1:22:48] don't know how he know
[1:22:50] but i knew he was ordained to know
[1:22:54] it was a gift
[1:22:56] in fact he would take his watch off
[1:22:59] because
[1:23:00] of the things that would take and i
[1:23:03] think i'm correct with the left to the
[1:23:05] right but if i'm not just
[1:23:08] forgive me
[1:23:09] but
[1:23:11] so
[1:23:13] the
[1:23:15] this pull
[1:23:18] was um
[1:23:21] it went on for a while the praying for
[1:23:23] the sick and
[1:23:24] and laying on hands and then he said
[1:23:26] there was a period of time in where he
[1:23:29] rested and he went off the field through
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:32] water
[1:23:33] and then there was a second poll
[1:23:36] or a second part of his ministry
[1:23:40] and i want to talk about that just for a
[1:23:42] second this morning
[1:23:44] and again this is like
[1:23:47] a sunday school and i hope that
[1:23:50] i can stay calm and precise and
[1:23:54] and
[1:23:55] and
[1:23:56] practice a little
[1:23:58] meekness but you know i'm pretty
[1:24:00] excitable so if i get excited just hold
[1:24:03] on for me would you
[1:24:05] because
[1:24:06] people think i'm against running around
[1:24:08] but i'm not i just think you need the
[1:24:10] right purpose to run around
[1:24:13] okay
[1:24:15] he said
[1:24:17] he said this
[1:24:19] he said
[1:24:20] the second
[1:24:22] was
[1:24:23] rebuking the organizations
[1:24:26] and prophesying
[1:24:29] what they had done
[1:24:32] what they were
[1:24:34] and what was coming
[1:24:39] what is
[1:24:41] what was
[1:24:42] what will come
[1:24:45] and what was what is and will come
[1:24:48] that's what he done is that right
[1:24:52] so that's the second pull
[1:24:54] well when i began to look last week and
[1:24:57] i began to say let's look at some of the
[1:24:59] sermons that he was preaching
[1:25:02] during the second pulse that caught my
[1:25:04] attention
[1:25:05] you know what he was doing
[1:25:07] and sure enough i came back and found it
[1:25:11] in the souls that were imprisoned now
[1:25:13] exactly him explaining what went on in
[1:25:17] his third poll how many that knows the
[1:25:20] two ministries ran exactly parallel
[1:25:24] that's because that's what that's what
[1:25:27] he he said
[1:25:29] he would do he said i wonder if his
[1:25:31] ministry
[1:25:33] climbs out the same way in the last days
[1:25:37] as it was
[1:25:39] as the father sent me so i send you the
[1:25:43] works that i do shall you do also so the
[1:25:46] prophet cut that his ministry went the
[1:25:49] same way
[1:25:51] okay the second part of his ministry was
[1:25:54] rebuking denominations that's why he
[1:25:56] said go back and read the titles
[1:25:58] forsaking all presuming
[1:26:01] you know warning then the judgment he's
[1:26:04] all these
[1:26:05] sermons that he was
[1:26:08] a preaching was this second poll rebuke
[1:26:13] it was the discerning
[1:26:17] of the heart
[1:26:18] remember that's what a second poll was
[1:26:22] was discerning of the heart but don't
[1:26:25] just leave that
[1:26:28] in the carnal realm
[1:26:32] because we think second poll oh you're
[1:26:34] mrs jones
[1:26:37] you know you're mrs smith
[1:26:40] or turning his back you're from here
[1:26:43] that you're from there and and
[1:26:45] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:26:48] the heart no what the second pull was
[1:26:52] was the sharp
[1:26:54] two-edged sword
[1:26:58] okay
[1:26:59] and it was discerning
[1:27:02] act as we
[1:27:05] as we
[1:27:06] uh
[1:27:09] as we read in hebrews here
[1:27:12] it was discerning
[1:27:14] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:27:19] and separating
[1:27:22] the soul and the spirit
[1:27:26] well what happened in you
[1:27:30] as your soul you you you found out oh
[1:27:33] i'm just a sinful man i've got all these
[1:27:36] lust in my life and everything but then
[1:27:38] a word came along and let you realize
[1:27:41] that there was another part of you
[1:27:44] that was the seed of god
[1:27:48] it it be what what was the intent of
[1:27:51] your heart
[1:27:52] so when you heard the word of god you
[1:27:55] you were brought to repentance because
[1:27:58] you said lord i never i didn't want to
[1:28:00] be this way i'm sorry for what i've done
[1:28:03] that's not my heart
[1:28:10] not really what i am
[1:28:16] you know
[1:28:17] you were brought under conviction what
[1:28:20] was that
[1:28:21] you were under the discernment
[1:28:24] of the sword of the word of god
[1:28:30] that that's what that's what it was he
[1:28:34] he told people what their sins were what
[1:28:36] was right what was wrong
[1:28:38] that that that second book but it was
[1:28:40] also doing something it was separating
[1:28:45] sheep from goat
[1:28:47] the second pool
[1:28:50] was
[1:28:51] was discerning
[1:28:53] those that were separating those out
[1:28:57] to hear
[1:28:59] the word of god
[1:29:02] so what was going to follow was the
[1:29:05] third pool
[1:29:10] now
[1:29:12] i don't understand all
[1:29:14] the third poll
[1:29:18] and i am not trying to explain
[1:29:21] all of the third poll
[1:29:23] but i
[1:29:24] believe that we are in
[1:29:28] that third poll
[1:29:31] may i read this statement to you
[1:29:35] but you can't kill the ministry
[1:29:39] it lives on you can put the messenger
[1:29:42] to sleep
[1:29:44] but you can't put the message
[1:29:48] right
[1:29:50] he lived on and noticed when the third
[1:29:54] pole of his ministry comes
[1:29:56] and he talks about the first was healing
[1:29:58] so you can't you the messenger can go to
[1:30:01] sleep i love how he uses that word to
[1:30:03] sleep
[1:30:06] but the message
[1:30:07] will live on
[1:30:11] so after there came there came a time
[1:30:14] where brother brahm had the ministry of
[1:30:15] the third poll and there's a period of
[1:30:18] time where he goes through questioning
[1:30:20] is this the third pole could this be the
[1:30:22] third pole
[1:30:24] is this the third pole but then he comes
[1:30:26] to an experience
[1:30:30] okay where it becomes more vivid to him
[1:30:36] what it is
[1:30:39] so he's been preaching
[1:30:42] against denominations
[1:30:44] where they come from
[1:30:47] the great harlot
[1:30:50] reasoning creeds dogmas
[1:30:53] he preaches
[1:30:56] where they came from
[1:30:58] what they are
[1:31:00] and what they will be
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:05] world council of churches organization
[1:31:09] further away from the word of god what
[1:31:11] was it prophecy
[1:31:14] he was prophesying so at the same time
[1:31:19] that he's prophesying he's telling
[1:31:22] what's going to come
[1:31:26] so now we're going to pick this up and
[1:31:31] and
[1:31:32] i wanted to play more of it but
[1:31:35] if you go back and read the first
[1:31:38] seventy
[1:31:40] six paragraphs
[1:31:42] of souls that are in prison
[1:31:45] we're going to pick up a paragraph 77
[1:31:49] just to explain the vision
[1:31:52] but
[1:31:52] brother brown talks about the time
[1:31:56] when he was 14 years old that his good
[1:32:00] buddy friend jim pool
[1:32:02] shotgun went off
[1:32:04] and shot him in the legs
[1:32:08] and he explains the compassion
[1:32:11] of the sisters that stood by his bedside
[1:32:14] and how that the ku klux klan and and
[1:32:18] different people people helped him out
[1:32:20] with this hospital bill and the doctor
[1:32:23] and
[1:32:24] and how he went through all that
[1:32:26] suffering and then later on
[1:32:28] they couldn't get all the shotgun wad
[1:32:31] and the clothing out of his leg it's so
[1:32:34] compassionate
[1:32:38] you know
[1:32:40] and i i think sometimes that
[1:32:43] i have it hard and and then i
[1:32:47] i think of people
[1:32:50] like my brother who lost two children
[1:32:55] and other people that have suffered
[1:32:58] you know and i i thought
[1:33:00] you know
[1:33:02] i really don't have much
[1:33:04] to say
[1:33:06] in the line of suffering i think my
[1:33:08] greatest suffering is suffering with
[1:33:10] myself
[1:33:12] and with my nature
[1:33:15] and that i pray every day
[1:33:18] that the love of god would be shed
[1:33:20] abroad in my heart
[1:33:22] by the holy spirit
[1:33:26] and that's one thing i believe is that i
[1:33:28] have a pure heart
[1:33:34] but he
[1:33:37] talks about
[1:33:40] how he descends
[1:33:43] and what a time it was
[1:33:46] so brother ram is going to go back now
[1:33:49] and tell us
[1:33:52] of the vision he had
[1:33:54] when he was 14 years old
[1:33:57] and descended
[1:33:59] into hell it's only 10 minutes but
[1:34:02] there's nobody that can tell it
[1:34:05] like the person
[1:34:07] to whom it happened
[1:34:08] god bless you may you enjoy these next
[1:34:11] few moments
[1:34:21] and um
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] now in this i tell you what happened in
[1:34:27] the vision that i had i'll go back
[1:34:29] because i brought that the two visions
[1:34:31] in to show you about one of them i used
[1:34:33] to be out west
[1:34:35] i've always longed for that
[1:34:38] and now the purpose of the message this
[1:34:39] morning is to post the church and
[1:34:42] everything that he'll let me post the
[1:34:44] church to as far as i know
[1:34:46] until the uh as i go along and this
[1:34:49] struck me so i wanted to post the church
[1:34:52] now this is to this tabernacle only see
[1:34:55] here
[1:34:56] now and
[1:34:57] in this vision the first one here's what
[1:35:00] taking place
[1:35:02] after the vision struck me and i was so
[1:35:04] weak and i lost all that blood and once
[1:35:07] i thought i was sinking into a endless
[1:35:11] eternity
[1:35:13] many of you heard me tell this before
[1:35:15] and and sinking into an endless eternity
[1:35:19] first i was going through like clouds
[1:35:21] and then through darkness and
[1:35:23] sinking on down down down
[1:35:25] and the first thing you know i got into
[1:35:28] the regions of the lost
[1:35:32] and
[1:35:34] in there i i screamed
[1:35:37] and i looked and there just everything
[1:35:39] there was no foundation to it i can
[1:35:42] never stop falling
[1:35:44] for eternity look like i was going to
[1:35:46] fall there's no stopping nowhere
[1:35:49] and then
[1:35:51] what a difference it was from the vision
[1:35:53] i had you're not long ago of being in
[1:35:54] glory with the people
[1:35:57] the contrast
[1:35:58] but
[1:35:59] in this as i was falling i finally
[1:36:02] i screamed for my daddy of course being
[1:36:05] just a kid that's what i would do i
[1:36:07] screamed for my daddy
[1:36:08] and my daddy wasn't there
[1:36:11] i screamed for my mother
[1:36:13] somebody catch me
[1:36:16] there was no mother there
[1:36:19] i was just going
[1:36:21] i screamed then to
[1:36:23] there was no god there
[1:36:25] there was nothing there
[1:36:27] and after a while i heard the most
[1:36:30] mournful
[1:36:32] sound that i ever heard
[1:36:35] and it was an office feeling there's no
[1:36:38] way even a literal burning fire would be
[1:36:41] a pleasure to decide of what this was
[1:36:44] now those visions has never been wrong
[1:36:48] and it was just one of the most horrible
[1:36:50] feelings i ever had and what did i heard
[1:36:52] a noise sound like some kind of a a
[1:36:55] haunted affair
[1:36:57] and when it was i looked coming and it
[1:37:00] was women
[1:37:02] and they had
[1:37:03] green stuff yes you just see their face
[1:37:06] and they had green stuff under their
[1:37:08] eyes and their eyes looked like run back
[1:37:11] like uh the women today paint their eyes
[1:37:14] run back like that and just their eyes
[1:37:17] and face they were going oh
[1:37:21] oh my i just screamed out oh god have
[1:37:24] mercy upon me have mercy o god where are
[1:37:27] you if you'll only let me go back and
[1:37:29] live i promise you to be a good boy
[1:37:32] now that's the only thing i could say
[1:37:34] now god knows and at the day of judgment
[1:37:37] he'll judge me for that statement
[1:37:39] that's what i said lord god let me go
[1:37:42] back and i'll promise you i'll be a good
[1:37:44] boy
[1:37:46] and when i got shot
[1:37:47] i had told lies i had done pretty
[1:37:50] everything there was to be done only one
[1:37:52] thing that i said i might as well just
[1:37:54] clean it out while i'm right here now
[1:37:56] and when i looked down and seen i was
[1:37:57] half loading two almost i said god have
[1:38:00] mercy on me you know i never did commit
[1:38:02] adultery that's the only thing that i
[1:38:04] could say to god i never accepted his
[1:38:06] pardon and all these things i just said
[1:38:08] could say i never did commit adultery
[1:38:10] and then they've taken me out there and
[1:38:12] then in that i cried god be merciful to
[1:38:14] me i'll be a good boy if you'll only let
[1:38:17] me go back for i knew there was a god
[1:38:20] somewhere
[1:38:22] and so help me
[1:38:24] those weary creatures all around i'd
[1:38:27] just been a new arrival
[1:38:29] most hideous
[1:38:31] horrible
[1:38:32] ungodly feeling in that
[1:38:35] look like great big eyes the big
[1:38:37] eyelashes out like that and run back
[1:38:39] like a cat like back like this and green
[1:38:41] stuff and like it cankered or something
[1:38:43] and they were they're going
[1:38:47] oh what a feeling now when i then in a
[1:38:50] moment's time i'd come back to natural
[1:38:53] life again
[1:38:55] that thing has bothered me i thought oh
[1:38:59] let it be that i'll never go to a place
[1:39:01] like that no other human being will ever
[1:39:04] have to go to a place like that
[1:39:06] seven months later i had the vision of
[1:39:08] standing in the west and seeing that
[1:39:10] gold cross coming down upon
[1:39:13] and
[1:39:15] i i knew that there was a regence of the
[1:39:18] damned somewhere
[1:39:20] now
[1:39:22] i never noticed it too much
[1:39:24] until about four weeks ago
[1:39:28] the wife never thought of it in this
[1:39:30] terms about four weeks ago the wife and
[1:39:33] i went down to tucson to do some
[1:39:36] shopping
[1:39:37] and while we were setting the wife we
[1:39:40] went downstairs and and there was a
[1:39:43] bunch of like boys had their hair
[1:39:46] red did you know like the women does and
[1:39:48] and bangs combed down here in front and
[1:39:50] these real high trousers on i guess a
[1:39:52] beet next or what you call them and they
[1:39:54] were in there and everybody's looking at
[1:39:56] them their heads is that big like the
[1:39:57] women it wears easier a water head hair
[1:39:59] cut you know and they were down there
[1:40:01] and a young woman come by and she said
[1:40:03] what do you think about that i said then
[1:40:05] you ought to be ashamed of yourself if
[1:40:07] you can think of that i said he had just
[1:40:08] as much right to do it as you do neither
[1:40:10] one of you have a right so i went
[1:40:12] upstairs and i sat down and when i did
[1:40:15] there's an escalator it was a jc penny
[1:40:17] store and that escalator bringing the
[1:40:19] people up
[1:40:20] well i really turned sick at my stomach
[1:40:23] uh seeing those women come up there
[1:40:26] young old and indifferent
[1:40:29] wrinkled young and everyway with little
[1:40:32] bitty shorts on
[1:40:35] their
[1:40:38] filthy body
[1:40:39] and those
[1:40:41] sexy dressed women were those great big
[1:40:44] heads
[1:40:45] like that
[1:40:46] and here they come
[1:40:48] and one coming around that escalator is
[1:40:50] coming right up like that where i was
[1:40:51] sitting back in a chair
[1:40:53] sitting there in my head down
[1:40:55] and i turned and looked
[1:40:56] and one of them coming up the steps was
[1:40:59] saying
[1:41:00] spanish speaking to another woman she
[1:41:02] was a white woman speaking to the
[1:41:03] spanish woman and when i looked
[1:41:07] all over once i was changed
[1:41:10] there i'd seen that before
[1:41:13] her eyes you know how the women are
[1:41:15] doing now paint their eyes just recently
[1:41:16] like cat you know put it up like this
[1:41:18] and wearing cat glasses and everything
[1:41:20] you know with eyes up like this and that
[1:41:23] green stuff under their eyes
[1:41:25] there
[1:41:26] was that thing
[1:41:29] i seen when i was a child
[1:41:31] there was a woman just exactly
[1:41:34] and i just got numb all over and began
[1:41:36] to look around and there was those
[1:41:37] people mumbling you know going on about
[1:41:39] the prices and things in the building
[1:41:41] and i just looked like it i just changed
[1:41:44] for a moment
[1:41:46] and i look i thought that's what i saw
[1:41:49] in hell
[1:41:52] there they was that canker i thought
[1:41:55] because they were in hell what made him
[1:41:57] that way a greenish blue
[1:41:59] under their eyes and here was these
[1:42:01] women painted with greenish blue
[1:42:04] just the way that vision said about 40
[1:42:06] years ago
[1:42:08] okay
[1:42:10] about 40 years ago it's what it's been
[1:42:12] i'm 54 i was 14. so about 40 years ago i
[1:42:17] and that's the the
[1:42:18] that's the number anyhow of the
[1:42:20] judgments you see now there was
[1:42:23] i've seen that
[1:42:25] and i couldn't even speak to my wife
[1:42:27] when she come
[1:42:28] she's over there trying to get a sarah
[1:42:30] and a kid some kind of a dress or
[1:42:32] something for school and i i couldn't
[1:42:34] even i couldn't even speak to her she
[1:42:37] said bill what's the matter with you
[1:42:39] i said honey i'm i'm almost a dead man
[1:42:43] and she said what's the matter you sick
[1:42:45] i said no
[1:42:47] something's just happened now she don't
[1:42:49] know
[1:42:50] she's waiting for this tape to return
[1:42:52] i've never said it to
[1:42:54] nobody i thought i'd wait as i promised
[1:42:58] bring it to the church first
[1:43:01] bring it to the church that's my promise
[1:43:03] and you'll realize that you're tonight
[1:43:05] reason i'll try to keep my promise in
[1:43:09] i thought then as i noticed them
[1:43:12] hankered looking eyes on them women
[1:43:15] there were the spanish the french and
[1:43:18] indian and white and all together but
[1:43:20] that great big heads
[1:43:23] you know bushed up without combs where
[1:43:25] they comb it back way big
[1:43:28] and then comes out you know you know how
[1:43:30] they do it fix it in the like and then
[1:43:32] them canker looking eyes and the eyes
[1:43:34] with a paint that run back like a cat's
[1:43:36] eye and then talking and there i was
[1:43:40] again
[1:43:42] standing there at j.c penney's store
[1:43:45] back in hell again
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:50] i i got so scared i thought lord
[1:43:53] surely i haven't died and you've let me
[1:43:54] come to this place after all
[1:43:58] and there they were making just around
[1:44:00] like at a in that vision like you could
[1:44:02] just barely hear it with your ears you
[1:44:04] know just the mumbling going off people
[1:44:06] and then women coming up that escalator
[1:44:08] and walking around there and
[1:44:09] there's them green and funny-looking
[1:44:11] eyes mournful
[1:44:14] wife come up and
[1:44:16] i said just let me alone i mean honey i
[1:44:18] said if you don't mind i i want to go
[1:44:20] home
[1:44:21] and she said are you sick i said no
[1:44:24] let's go ahead honey you've got any
[1:44:25] shopping to do she said no i'm finished
[1:44:28] and i said let me take it but
[1:44:30] see
[1:44:31] i walked i said what's the matter i said
[1:44:33] meaty i i
[1:44:35] something happened up there and while i
[1:44:37] was under that
[1:44:39] i thought this
[1:44:42] what day are we living in
[1:44:44] could this be the third pool
[1:44:51] i've got
[1:44:56] so i want to
[1:45:00] take it
[1:45:02] from there
[1:45:05] he had descended in in
[1:45:10] basically in the vision
[1:45:14] he had
[1:45:15] descended into hell
[1:45:17] is that right god gave him two visions
[1:45:19] he's talking about
[1:45:21] one was when he was out west with the
[1:45:23] cross
[1:45:24] coming down you know that's where he got
[1:45:28] saved
[1:45:29] it's also
[1:45:30] where
[1:45:31] he
[1:45:32] descended up in
[1:45:34] to the heaven
[1:45:35] and was caught up i was like paul said i
[1:45:38] was caught up into the heavenlies caught
[1:45:39] up into the third day
[1:45:42] so he descended into hell and when he
[1:45:45] was there he saw
[1:45:47] this vision
[1:45:49] and that's when it came back to him
[1:45:53] and he said i'm in hell again
[1:45:56] he says is this the third poll
[1:45:59] so i want to talk first to you about the
[1:46:03] first voice
[1:46:06] of the pope now
[1:46:08] it's not a different voice
[1:46:11] you know
[1:46:12] maybe
[1:46:13] instead of using the word voice i might
[1:46:16] use the word message
[1:46:18] but the voice went to two different
[1:46:22] classes of people
[1:46:25] so let's just
[1:46:27] take a moment if i i could
[1:46:30] and you could
[1:46:32] turn
[1:46:33] uh
[1:46:34] with me if you wanted to
[1:46:37] to um
[1:46:40] the back of that same book around
[1:46:42] paragraph
[1:46:45] 277
[1:46:46] now remember because we're speaking in
[1:46:49] our day we just quoted that the
[1:46:52] messenger can go to sleep
[1:46:55] but the message continues on
[1:46:59] so the voice of the first pull still
[1:47:03] continues on
[1:47:05] in fact everybody's trying to
[1:47:06] impersonate it
[1:47:10] a lot of people have vibrations in their
[1:47:13] hands they have discernment they they
[1:47:16] they do all those things but the trouble
[1:47:18] with an impersonation is it is an
[1:47:22] impersonation so the the original has
[1:47:25] moved on
[1:47:28] so they're left back in another day
[1:47:31] you you don't think impersonations are
[1:47:33] amazing i always thought it was amazing
[1:47:36] of them building an ark in kentucky
[1:47:39] i used to always think of that when i
[1:47:41] was a kid i'd like to build that ark
[1:47:43] again
[1:47:45] i bet you i could sell tickets
[1:47:48] now i guess you pay 50 bucks to go into
[1:47:50] a boat-shaped barn
[1:47:54] but it's it's a day gone by what a
[1:47:57] rebuke what a what a sign
[1:48:00] because you know
[1:48:02] the prophet of god said you know that
[1:48:04] that god why did abraham marry hagar
[1:48:10] you know
[1:48:10] not just because sarah wanted to god
[1:48:12] said sarah's telling you to do the right
[1:48:14] thing because there had to be an ishmael
[1:48:17] there had to be a contrast there had to
[1:48:20] be something that showed that the air
[1:48:23] is not
[1:48:25] joint air with the bonds woman
[1:48:30] and also jacob i've loved esau i've
[1:48:32] hated so the revival there's always been
[1:48:36] two strains
[1:48:39] there's always been a jesus and a judas
[1:48:41] a canaan and abel a jesus and a judas
[1:48:44] there's there's always been
[1:48:47] to that that strain esau and a jacob
[1:48:51] every revival
[1:48:53] has twins
[1:48:56] there's two vines there's two things
[1:48:59] so the third pole has two sides to it
[1:49:06] it's got
[1:49:07] two
[1:49:08] voices
[1:49:11] a voice to one
[1:49:13] and a voice to the other
[1:49:16] it's one voice
[1:49:19] but people hearing
[1:49:21] two different things
[1:49:26] from the same voice
[1:49:28] now the question is today that you've
[1:49:30] got to you've got to
[1:49:33] ask yourself because we preached that
[1:49:35] last week i didn't even know why i
[1:49:36] preached it last sunday
[1:49:39] and now i was absorbed up into that that
[1:49:42] second pull and the titles of those
[1:49:45] sermons and we kept talking about the
[1:49:47] voice trying to get to your mind the
[1:49:50] voice of reasoning to the this voice
[1:49:53] that goes out because there's a voice of
[1:49:56] the third pole and that voice is to the
[1:50:00] lost
[1:50:02] and that's what he said i'm in hell
[1:50:05] could this be that third pole
[1:50:08] and that's why he said you could kill a
[1:50:10] ministry
[1:50:11] uh but but you uh
[1:50:15] you can't jesus's ministry
[1:50:17] was when he healed the sick he was a
[1:50:20] wonderful young prophet of
[1:50:22] galilee why he makes the blind to see
[1:50:27] and even rapes the dead
[1:50:29] oh we got three cases of it he actually
[1:50:32] raised the dead but one day he turned
[1:50:35] around and said you generation of vipers
[1:50:40] you make the outside of the platter
[1:50:43] clean
[1:50:44] but you appear to be holy but inside of
[1:50:47] you you are nothing but a bunch of
[1:50:49] snakes
[1:50:53] you appear
[1:50:54] to be holy but inside you you're nothing
[1:50:57] but a bunch of snakes oh when that
[1:50:59] prophecy went forth
[1:51:02] condemning that organization then it
[1:51:05] changed
[1:51:06] it turned against him that's right and
[1:51:09] finally rejected him they crucified him
[1:51:17] how many
[1:51:20] does the thought come to your mind of
[1:51:23] the message
[1:51:24] that
[1:51:25] brother brown preached the indictment
[1:51:29] everything is so perfect
[1:51:31] in god's word and he says but you can
[1:51:35] kill the ministry it lives on
[1:51:37] you can put the messenger to sleep but
[1:51:40] you can't put the message
[1:51:42] right he lives on and notice when the
[1:51:45] third pull of his ministry to come
[1:51:48] the first poll was healing the sick this
[1:51:51] paragraph 277
[1:51:53] second poll was the rebuking of
[1:51:55] organizations and prophesying
[1:51:58] hebrews 14 12.
[1:52:00] we just mentioned it
[1:52:04] and what they
[1:52:06] what it was
[1:52:08] what it was where it come from
[1:52:11] uh it says
[1:52:14] he says prophesied what they had done
[1:52:19] what they were
[1:52:21] what was coming
[1:52:23] what is
[1:52:24] what is will come
[1:52:27] and what was what is and will come
[1:52:31] that he done
[1:52:32] that right right so that was the second
[1:52:34] poll
[1:52:35] it was brother branham's second poll two
[1:52:38] because he he said now the third poll
[1:52:42] was when he preached to the lost
[1:52:46] that couldn't
[1:52:48] no more
[1:52:49] couldn't be saved
[1:52:51] no
[1:52:52] more
[1:52:53] they were down there
[1:52:56] where them big painted eyes was
[1:53:01] preaching to the souls in hell
[1:53:04] they did not accept mercy
[1:53:07] but were eternally separated from the
[1:53:10] presence of god but let they had
[1:53:14] but yet they had to recognize it
[1:53:18] what he was because god made him there
[1:53:26] now
[1:53:28] the third poll
[1:53:29] was to
[1:53:30] the lost
[1:53:33] now
[1:53:34] the same time brothers now brother
[1:53:36] braham is now going into his third poll
[1:53:39] we'll get to this in a second so he he
[1:53:41] says is this the start of the third bull
[1:53:44] in other words i'm going to be preaching
[1:53:46] to the lost to people who can't be saved
[1:53:51] so many people
[1:53:53] misunderstood this message
[1:53:57] many you are you are younger
[1:54:00] brother tim might be old enough when he
[1:54:01] was a younger boy so many people begin
[1:54:04] to sing nobody's saved there's nobody
[1:54:07] what about our children our children
[1:54:12] once you understand this
[1:54:16] that question never comes to you again
[1:54:20] because there's another side of the
[1:54:22] third pole
[1:54:25] and we'll go to that side here in a
[1:54:27] moment but once we want to establish
[1:54:30] this
[1:54:31] third pull is to the lost
[1:54:34] so he's preaching to people that are not
[1:54:38] going to be saved
[1:54:40] and part of that is is because they come
[1:54:43] to the place where they blaspheme the
[1:54:46] ministry of the son of man and there's
[1:54:49] no forgiveness for that sin in this life
[1:54:51] or the life to come
[1:54:57] they rejected
[1:55:00] brother abraham not because of the
[1:55:02] healing
[1:55:05] they knew that the prophecy and the
[1:55:07] rebuke about him was true
[1:55:10] but they rejected him when he claimed to
[1:55:12] be the seventh angel and opened the
[1:55:14] seals
[1:55:17] no
[1:55:19] you take too
[1:55:20] much upon yourself
[1:55:23] but let us just read if i i could i
[1:55:26] don't know if it's my eyes that are
[1:55:28] blurry or my glasses
[1:55:31] probably both
[1:55:39] oh i wonder if his ministry combines out
[1:55:42] the same way in the last days
[1:55:44] the loss could never be saved
[1:55:46] they had rejected mercy
[1:55:49] that was his third pull
[1:55:52] now is there any question his first paul
[1:55:55] healing is sick is that right
[1:55:57] the second ministry he was prophesying
[1:56:01] the third ministry is preaching to the
[1:56:03] eternal lost
[1:56:05] three mountains and so forth
[1:56:07] he's talking about
[1:56:09] the peaks and
[1:56:11] things like that because he's inclining
[1:56:13] a bunch of different
[1:56:17] messages here
[1:56:19] together
[1:56:21] he says
[1:56:24] noah's ministry all ministries done the
[1:56:26] same noah preached
[1:56:28] that exactly right he went into the ark
[1:56:31] and when he went into the ark there was
[1:56:34] seven days that nothing happened his
[1:56:36] testimony was preached to the doomed
[1:56:39] sodom and gomorrah jesus referred to
[1:56:42] both of them
[1:56:43] as coming before the coming of the son
[1:56:46] of man shall be like in the days of noah
[1:56:49] it she be like in the days of sodom so
[1:56:52] in the coming of the son of man there's
[1:56:54] a portion of the ministry that's to the
[1:56:58] lost
[1:57:00] he's preaching to him
[1:57:02] but they're not hearing it
[1:57:05] they're preaching to but it's having no
[1:57:08] effect
[1:57:09] that's no wonder he got to that place he
[1:57:11] said i come back here year after year
[1:57:13] after year and you get worse and worse
[1:57:16] oh capernaum
[1:57:18] oh los angeles city of the angels you
[1:57:21] exalt yourself into heaven but you shall
[1:57:23] be brought to the lowest hell
[1:57:30] he could knows the same way solomon
[1:57:32] jurors referred to both of them noah had
[1:57:35] three poles
[1:57:36] and his three pulse was to the lost
[1:57:39] after the door was shut
[1:57:41] god let it sit right there
[1:57:44] where nobody could enter
[1:57:46] or go out
[1:57:48] they were inside
[1:57:50] for
[1:57:51] for
[1:57:52] this seventh mountain
[1:57:55] the highest mountain that where he
[1:57:57] settled the ark mountain is that right
[1:58:00] so i mean i i don't have time to go back
[1:58:03] over the peaks and the poles and the
[1:58:06] peaks and how the seventh peak
[1:58:08] represented his ministry and what had he
[1:58:10] said settled on that seventh peak the
[1:58:12] ark
[1:58:16] the place of safety
[1:58:18] for the believer
[1:58:20] now we're just going to i'm going to
[1:58:22] read a little bit read along with me
[1:58:24] because we i think this we're old enough
[1:58:27] to accept these things
[1:58:33] he says in the days of paraguay and dave
[1:58:36] of uh
[1:58:38] sodom first poll was to righteous lot
[1:58:42] and the bible said the sins of sodom
[1:58:44] have vexed his righteous soul daily
[1:58:46] how them women acted and done you
[1:58:49] remember as it was in the days of noah
[1:58:52] what they were doing eating drinking
[1:58:54] giving in to marriage see
[1:58:56] what was it
[1:58:58] in the days of sodom
[1:59:01] and the first message was lot
[1:59:04] they laughed him to scorn
[1:59:06] then he sent another messengers two of
[1:59:09] them
[1:59:11] and they went down that was the second
[1:59:14] poll
[1:59:15] sodom
[1:59:17] right
[1:59:18] now this is where we want to
[1:59:22] uh make the turn
[1:59:24] right here so if you understand that
[1:59:27] there's a portion in brother branham's
[1:59:29] ministry
[1:59:30] that was to the lost
[1:59:32] it didn't mean everybody was lost
[1:59:36] it just means that now he was preaching
[1:59:40] to people who were never
[1:59:43] going
[1:59:44] to receive it
[1:59:50] so he said it i i could we could pull
[1:59:53] quote after quote after quote they don't
[1:59:55] have anything in them to believe with
[1:59:59] so now the third poll is now going to
[2:00:03] take on its second voice
[2:00:08] and that's the message to the elect
[2:00:13] so the the seals come
[2:00:16] that's the opening of the book
[2:00:19] the second part of his vision the first
[2:00:22] part is he descended into hell
[2:00:25] and jesus descended we didn't read that
[2:00:28] scripture but he descended into hell and
[2:00:30] preached to the lost
[2:00:35] so he descended in hell and preached the
[2:00:37] lust now verb said this is the third
[2:00:39] pole it's here it's on the third pole
[2:00:43] i'm going to go preach to a bunch of
[2:00:45] people
[2:00:48] that never will be saved they never will
[2:00:50] accept it
[2:00:52] they're lost
[2:00:56] but now there's another part
[2:00:59] he points out
[2:01:01] and this is we're going to just go into
[2:01:04] this part of it because it's the part
[2:01:06] that i i want you to grab a hold of this
[2:01:09] church will never amount to anything
[2:01:14] as long as they get this idea that we're
[2:01:18] all christians we are not all christians
[2:01:23] we are direct descendants of the kinsmen
[2:01:28] we have the gene
[2:01:31] seed of god in us we have a gene just
[2:01:35] like brother brandt preaches it over and
[2:01:37] over again but it means more to me this
[2:01:39] morning he said you got your gene like
[2:01:42] your father
[2:01:43] your mother
[2:01:49] same thing with god
[2:01:53] amen that's right
[2:01:56] you are direct
[2:01:58] descendant
[2:02:00] so now he starts his ministry
[2:02:04] to the lost
[2:02:07] but now there's another voice
[2:02:10] that's to the elect
[2:02:14] to a certain group of
[2:02:16] people that's going to be able to
[2:02:19] understand a certain language
[2:02:21] because they're made not to
[2:02:24] reason
[2:02:27] but to believe it
[2:02:29] amen
[2:02:30] now let's read this next paragraph so i
[2:02:33] want to understand we saw this part
[2:02:36] that's still going on
[2:02:40] you're preaching to the lost
[2:02:44] how many people do you share it with
[2:02:46] them it's right so
[2:02:49] bold flesh plain to them
[2:02:54] and you're trying to get it in their
[2:02:56] mind
[2:02:59] but there's somebody else battling for
[2:03:01] that mind
[2:03:03] the minute you leave there's somebody
[2:03:05] else there
[2:03:11] there's somebody that's going to bring
[2:03:12] that temptation
[2:03:14] that's going to walk in with that
[2:03:15] six-pack it's going to walk him with
[2:03:17] that drugs that's going to you know give
[2:03:20] you free movie tickets or whatever you
[2:03:22] know what i mean because there's a war
[2:03:24] going on there's a battle going on
[2:03:27] and then brother ben preaches a sermon
[2:03:29] called the uncertain sound
[2:03:32] what's he doing
[2:03:35] he's separating
[2:03:37] he's separating those that won't accept
[2:03:40] it
[2:03:41] and separating those that will hear it
[2:03:46] because people are dropping like flies
[2:03:48] in the second poll
[2:03:51] he can't even find a place to preach the
[2:03:54] businessmen have got rid of them
[2:03:57] if it wasn't for carl williams he'd
[2:03:59] hardly have anything then in phoenix a
[2:04:01] few of the pentecostal churches still
[2:04:04] wanted to have them because they were so
[2:04:06] dead and so we had so little works and
[2:04:10] so little power of the holy spirit
[2:04:13] moving
[2:04:16] that they wanted him in his midst
[2:04:24] so he's preaching to the lost
[2:04:27] that's what he said i'm back in hell
[2:04:29] again
[2:04:32] isn't my ministry just the same as his
[2:04:35] i'm going to be preaching to the lost
[2:04:40] and everybody said oh my kids aren't
[2:04:42] saved nobody's saved no because they
[2:04:46] didn't hear the second voice
[2:04:50] that's what he said
[2:04:53] he first came to bind up the
[2:04:54] brokenhearted but the second part of his
[2:04:56] meme was to bring judgment
[2:04:58] you notice he said 40 years
[2:05:00] that's the time that's the number of
[2:05:02] judgment so now i'm here to bring
[2:05:04] judgment so now he's here he's opening
[2:05:08] the seals now from the seals there's a
[2:05:10] voice
[2:05:12] the third pole
[2:05:14] the other side of the third pole the
[2:05:16] other voice of the third pole and that's
[2:05:19] to the elect
[2:05:21] now let's read this beautiful paragraph
[2:05:23] before we move on
[2:05:26] but look at the one that went last
[2:05:31] amen
[2:05:33] there's no
[2:05:34] more
[2:05:36] no more and
[2:05:38] more mercy
[2:05:41] it was all over then
[2:05:44] all over at that time
[2:05:47] that third messenger went down there
[2:05:50] the third pole
[2:05:52] what was he what kind of ministry did he
[2:05:55] have
[2:05:56] he sat with the elect
[2:05:59] and told them what was taking place
[2:06:02] behind him that's right
[2:06:06] so the other part of the third poll
[2:06:10] was sitting with the
[2:06:12] elect
[2:06:17] and that's what we want to
[2:06:19] move to now i want you to totally
[2:06:21] understand
[2:06:22] that from that time on the church world
[2:06:25] had rejected him
[2:06:28] he was
[2:06:29] his message was
[2:06:30] not being received
[2:06:33] by the multitudes his days of being the
[2:06:36] good rabbi with the healing was over
[2:06:39] he finally took the whoop out he finally
[2:06:42] called them a snake of the vipers he
[2:06:44] finally started cleaning out their
[2:06:46] churches telling me what was to come in
[2:06:49] that you're going to move away from the
[2:06:50] word of god you're going to move into
[2:06:52] total apostasy you're going to organize
[2:06:55] you're going to take creeds and dogmas
[2:06:57] and you're going to take the mark of the
[2:06:58] beast
[2:07:03] all the third paul
[2:07:05] that ministry's
[2:07:07] still going
[2:07:11] today
[2:07:14] but let's look just for a few moments
[2:07:17] this morning
[2:07:18] just think you can go home and take a
[2:07:20] nap
[2:07:26] let's just read a few
[2:07:29] very few statements
[2:07:33] to
[2:07:35] the
[2:07:38] elect at the end of christ the mystery
[2:07:41] of god revealed
[2:07:45] brother abraham's preaching
[2:07:47] now we're looking back at some of this
[2:07:50] from history
[2:07:52] but we're looking back at the source of
[2:07:55] prophecy
[2:07:58] okay
[2:07:59] so just like jesus said search the
[2:08:02] scriptures
[2:08:03] so we're looking back at the prophecy
[2:08:06] so we can see why our footsteps have
[2:08:10] been ordered to this time and this place
[2:08:14] and this understanding of god's word
[2:08:18] now today you've got you guys have got
[2:08:20] to decide whether you're a part of this
[2:08:21] message or not but let me tell you about
[2:08:24] your careers i think the brother mike
[2:08:27] brought it into this thing it'll all be
[2:08:29] taken away
[2:08:30] it's all going to perish the only thing
[2:08:33] that lasts is what's eternal
[2:08:36] i don't know why god put it there
[2:08:40] but he put eternal life in me in the
[2:08:43] beginning
[2:08:44] your name is put on the lamb's book of
[2:08:47] life nothing can put it on nothing can
[2:08:49] take it off
[2:08:51] now there's a message
[2:08:54] a voice of the third pull
[2:08:58] to the elect
[2:09:03] i'm going to just read i know i'm not a
[2:09:05] good reader but
[2:09:06] i hope this is
[2:09:09] a blessing
[2:09:10] this is in why christ speak
[2:09:14] paragraph
[2:09:16] 32 from the source that i took it
[2:09:20] from but not all the things that are
[2:09:23] published have the same paragraph
[2:09:25] numbers but
[2:09:26] he says
[2:09:29] what a
[2:09:30] lesson what a lesson oh my
[2:09:35] at this stage of the journey
[2:09:38] where we're standing
[2:09:40] look where
[2:09:42] we're at now yes sir
[2:09:45] at the third
[2:09:48] poll
[2:09:50] notice we're right here at the door of
[2:09:53] the coming of the lord
[2:09:56] he was anointed for the job
[2:09:59] and still waited for thus saith the lord
[2:10:03] god must have had enough of it
[2:10:06] he said don't cry anymore speak
[2:10:10] i send you
[2:10:12] now he says we're just at
[2:10:15] the door
[2:10:16] or we've just come to the third pool
[2:10:21] so there's going to be a change right
[2:10:23] he's now he's asked to do something
[2:10:28] he's asked to accept
[2:10:34] what god made him
[2:10:37] he's asked to accept
[2:10:39] the authority
[2:10:41] that god had given them
[2:10:43] and to move on with it
[2:10:48] it's going to cost them everything
[2:10:54] right
[2:10:56] he said i got to the place i could watch
[2:10:58] people go off
[2:11:00] at the cliff
[2:11:02] and then god dealt with them he
[2:11:04] understands i'm preaching to the lost
[2:11:06] but he also knew there was somebody else
[2:11:08] that he had to give
[2:11:11] the message of the third pull too
[2:11:16] because he's getting it
[2:11:20] and remember
[2:11:22] in everything happens in prophecy
[2:11:25] before you can get it it has to be
[2:11:28] revealed to his servant the prophet
[2:11:31] first
[2:11:34] and then he gives it out in a way
[2:11:39] that can't be understood only believed
[2:11:42] he gives it out in a way in fact his
[2:11:45] mouth was even shaped in a way that he
[2:11:48] could speak the words the way he spoke
[2:11:50] them that only the elect could receive
[2:11:53] it
[2:11:56] that's how special
[2:11:59] you are
[2:12:02] praise the lord
[2:12:05] he who have ear to hear
[2:12:07] let him hear what the spirit
[2:12:10] says
[2:12:11] to the churches so now he's experiencing
[2:12:14] it now he had the vision
[2:12:17] when the seventh seal was opened he
[2:12:19] refers to it
[2:12:21] and now he's coming back he understands
[2:12:24] i'm preaching to the lost
[2:12:28] but he knew there was another group
[2:12:32] he knew that his voice
[2:12:34] now
[2:12:35] was only
[2:12:37] going to those whose names were written
[2:12:41] on the lamb's book of life who
[2:12:44] understood his language because they
[2:12:46] were direct offsprings
[2:12:53] i was at brother lynette stefan's the
[2:12:56] other day and i accused him of trying to
[2:12:58] turn me into a romanian
[2:13:03] because he feeds me so much romanian
[2:13:05] food you know
[2:13:06] i i drive down the road and my truck
[2:13:09] automatically pulls out in front of his
[2:13:11] house because i know when you go through
[2:13:13] those doors you're gonna eat
[2:13:19] well
[2:13:20] you are what you eat right
[2:13:22] so now he's got
[2:13:24] third pool food
[2:13:27] for the elect
[2:13:29] because he's going to turn them in to
[2:13:32] something.
[2:13:37] let's just read on
[2:13:40] he was anointed for the job
[2:13:42] don't christ speak oh
[2:13:45] what this church ought to be this
[2:13:48] morning
[2:13:49] with god's perfect vindication
[2:13:52] with the pillar of fire and the signs
[2:13:55] and wonders and everything just like it
[2:13:59] was in the days of sodom he said it
[2:14:02] would
[2:14:03] return back
[2:14:06] just like it was when the gospel was
[2:14:09] being preached to
[2:14:11] the law
[2:14:13] and we could go down and read i'll just
[2:14:15] skip
[2:14:16] down to the
[2:14:18] paragraph 239
[2:14:20] speak to the people and let's go forward
[2:14:23] amen we've got an objective that's glory
[2:14:27] let's move
[2:14:29] to it
[2:14:30] we're heading to the promised land
[2:14:33] all things are possible to them that
[2:14:36] believe speak to the people
[2:14:39] haven't i proved it
[2:14:42] haven't i even had my picture made among
[2:14:45] you and everything else and done
[2:14:48] everything that could be done to prove
[2:14:51] that i
[2:14:52] am
[2:14:53] with
[2:14:54] you
[2:14:58] how many of us are going forward in life
[2:15:03] knowing
[2:15:04] that god's with us
[2:15:07] and if god be for us
[2:15:09] who can stand against us
[2:15:26] doesn't the magazine just a few weeks
[2:15:28] ago packed the article
[2:15:31] when you said
[2:15:33] they're at the pulpit it would take
[2:15:35] place out here
[2:15:36] and three months beforehand
[2:15:39] and went and taken place and vindicated
[2:15:43] even the science knows about it every
[2:15:46] they've done
[2:15:48] you're still waiting
[2:15:56] we're still waiting
[2:15:59] waiting for what
[2:16:01] waiting for a revival waiting for an
[2:16:04] infilling
[2:16:06] waiting for a move of the spirit
[2:16:10] and we get ministry after ministry
[2:16:13] trying to pump us up
[2:16:16] no
[2:16:17] there's a voice
[2:16:19] of the third pole
[2:16:22] to you
[2:16:26] they rejected it
[2:16:30] but he kept preaching
[2:16:32] he kept going in there
[2:16:34] he kept healing their sick he kept doing
[2:16:37] signs and wonders he preached the
[2:16:39] rapture he preached things that are to
[2:16:41] be he preached so many fabulous messages
[2:16:44] in those churches in those in those
[2:16:48] full gospel businessmen
[2:16:51] at home where in jeffersonville he was
[2:16:54] preaching but he knew one thing the last
[2:16:56] part of his ministry was to the lost
[2:17:01] you say well what about us
[2:17:04] you were part of the opening of the
[2:17:06] seventh seal
[2:17:07] because your name was on that book of
[2:17:09] life
[2:17:10] and when he took that book that's why
[2:17:13] john wept because nobody could open that
[2:17:15] book all of god's elected
[2:17:18] were in that book
[2:17:20] and were revealed at the time of the
[2:17:22] opening of that book in seven seals no
[2:17:25] matter when your baby's born
[2:17:27] congratulations
[2:17:33] because god's what
[2:17:35] eternal and if you had eternal life you
[2:17:39] always had eternal life so what what
[2:17:43] what so the third pole now becomes he's
[2:17:47] preaching to the lost that can't be
[2:17:49] saved now the third poll becomes him
[2:17:52] preaching to a people so that they could
[2:17:56] come to the revelation
[2:17:58] of their eternal
[2:18:02] part
[2:18:05] they can come to the revelation of their
[2:18:09] eternity
[2:18:14] he says
[2:18:16] he speaks of it
[2:18:17] he says speak to the people
[2:18:21] and go forward
[2:18:22] to your objective
[2:18:28] and here's that quote brother tim you
[2:18:29] must not have read this too long ago
[2:18:32] god give me courage
[2:18:34] to take that sword
[2:18:37] of the word
[2:18:39] that you put in my hand
[2:18:42] 33 years ago and hold it and march
[2:18:45] forward
[2:18:46] to
[2:18:47] the third pull
[2:18:49] is my prayer
[2:18:51] so now
[2:18:52] the the third poll
[2:18:54] is
[2:18:57] now the the the third poll is something
[2:19:00] that now is going to take place in
[2:19:04] brother phantom's ministry that he's now
[2:19:07] going to deliver to the elect
[2:19:11] that because they're the only ones that
[2:19:14] are going to be able to take possession
[2:19:17] of this message
[2:19:21] another the third pole message is not a
[2:19:24] history lesson
[2:19:26] it's the revelation
[2:19:28] of an inheritance
[2:19:32] that the elect is elected to possess and
[2:19:36] have
[2:19:40] the same spirit
[2:19:42] that was in christ jesus dwelling in
[2:19:44] your mortal body but it's going to take
[2:19:48] something
[2:19:49] and the third poll is given to create
[2:19:53] that something within us
[2:19:55] may i read a few more statements are you
[2:19:57] okay
[2:20:01] just think of your bed in an hour
[2:20:05] now i'm looking for something to happen
[2:20:08] to start
[2:20:11] that third pull
[2:20:13] in the mark
[2:20:17] and maybe
[2:20:18] next sunday morning healing service
[2:20:21] may it produce that i don't know
[2:20:27] so he's looking for this third pull
[2:20:31] to start
[2:20:32] a different attitude a different
[2:20:34] revelation a different take on the word
[2:20:38] of god why because it had come a whole
[2:20:40] brand new book to
[2:20:42] him this is something that they've all
[2:20:45] rejected you notice i just think it's so
[2:20:48] thin the third pull in the mark
[2:20:54] you know prophets don't say things
[2:20:58] mark of the what
[2:21:00] this third poll is going to take place
[2:21:02] within the mark of the beast
[2:21:06] it's going to take place not in churches
[2:21:09] it's in people
[2:21:12] he goes on this paragraph 29 of humble
[2:21:15] thy cell
[2:21:22] he says no yes he says i think
[2:21:25] for us to do
[2:21:26] would be to tell your people get the
[2:21:29] sick people
[2:21:30] now for healing service
[2:21:33] we got to concentrate on sick people get
[2:21:36] your sick people and get them here early
[2:21:39] next sunday say about 8 30
[2:21:42] and we'll let them give them prayer
[2:21:44] cards and come in the door however they
[2:21:47] do it
[2:21:48] and
[2:21:48] and then we'll have a prayer line and
[2:21:51] pray for the sick
[2:21:53] and just see what the holy spirit will
[2:21:55] do
[2:21:56] i believe you'll do wonders
[2:21:58] if we will just believe him
[2:22:01] but we've got to believe him for that
[2:22:04] now
[2:22:05] with all our hearts
[2:22:07] i think that the great hour has arrived
[2:22:11] that when god
[2:22:12] in so much as we was speaking this
[2:22:15] morning
[2:22:16] and show us so much
[2:22:19] and brought us to a certain
[2:22:21] just up to a spot
[2:22:24] just to push us over the hill
[2:22:28] and that's all we need
[2:22:31] then away it goes
[2:22:34] it's going just like it was the same
[2:22:37] thing with the sermon
[2:22:39] the same thing
[2:22:41] with the prophetic
[2:22:45] so
[2:22:46] he's saying i just preached this
[2:22:48] and it's it's brought up we're up to
[2:22:51] that place now
[2:22:53] so you realize that you may have come
[2:22:55] into this message at different times
[2:22:58] that's because god's
[2:23:02] new you
[2:23:04] and when he gave you the message he
[2:23:07] didn't give you a new message
[2:23:09] he didn't give you a second hand message
[2:23:12] he stored up the food for you
[2:23:16] personally
[2:23:20] and if you're not listening to it
[2:23:24] and you're not reading it
[2:23:26] and you're not studying it and you just
[2:23:29] come here to get a little temporary
[2:23:32] stimulation
[2:23:35] i pity you
[2:23:38] i pity you because you're living below
[2:23:41] your privilege
[2:23:50] to be fortified
[2:23:53] with the saith the lord
[2:23:55] is what the believer lives for
[2:24:01] this is also from
[2:24:07] now we're pulling it together now
[2:24:10] as the elect
[2:24:12] i was thinking here of one
[2:24:15] little illustration
[2:24:18] this is paragraph 74
[2:24:21] of humble thyself
[2:24:23] if our paragraphs line up
[2:24:27] i don't know if they can find that
[2:24:29] or there it is right there beautiful
[2:24:32] i was thinking here of one little
[2:24:34] illustration
[2:24:36] to back up
[2:24:37] what he said
[2:24:39] now we look at this watch
[2:24:43] to find out what time it is
[2:24:49] let this sink in church
[2:24:52] unless every instrument
[2:24:55] in that watch
[2:24:56] is coordinating
[2:24:58] one with the other
[2:25:00] you'll never know
[2:25:03] the correct
[2:25:04] time
[2:25:06] is that right
[2:25:10] and that takes all of us
[2:25:13] all together
[2:25:15] if we want to see the third pull
[2:25:20] really do something for god
[2:25:23] it's coordination with every one of us
[2:25:27] together
[2:25:29] to humble ourselves before god and
[2:25:32] confess our wrongs and pray and believe
[2:25:37] for these
[2:25:39] things
[2:25:46] i'd like to read
[2:25:50] further paragraph 76
[2:25:55] and there's there's many things in
[2:25:58] between but i don't want to
[2:26:00] i do want to keep you as long as i can
[2:26:03] honesty is the first sign
[2:26:08] my honesty gets me in trouble
[2:26:10] you know
[2:26:12] it's hard for me to have someone lie to
[2:26:13] me and me not say you're lying
[2:26:17] i'll say it sweet
[2:26:19] but it still gripes them
[2:26:22] and god can only operate as we let him
[2:26:26] operate
[2:26:27] now okay now get it
[2:26:30] get it
[2:26:31] he's offering us the third poll
[2:26:34] all right
[2:26:35] that's what he's doing
[2:26:37] he's offering us the third poll he
[2:26:39] understands part of it's to the lost
[2:26:43] but now he understands that there's
[2:26:45] another charge of faith coming
[2:26:49] and this bride is going to have to be
[2:26:52] con
[2:26:53] coordinated together
[2:26:55] he preaches a message called uniting
[2:26:57] time and sign
[2:26:59] they're uniting their organizing they're
[2:27:02] taking the mark of the beast but there's
[2:27:04] a bride an elect lady who's going to
[2:27:07] take the word or take the third pull
[2:27:10] message
[2:27:14] there's two voices
[2:27:16] one to the lost
[2:27:18] one to the elect
[2:27:20] same message
[2:27:23] one produces doubt and damnation
[2:27:29] jesus said then that belief shall be
[2:27:31] saved then that don't believe are damned
[2:27:34] all
[2:27:35] ready
[2:27:42] only
[2:27:45] only as we let him operate and there are
[2:27:48] so many wonderful things that
[2:27:51] i say
[2:27:53] you know people want power
[2:27:57] and really they don't know what power is
[2:28:00] they don't really know what what goes
[2:28:03] with it
[2:28:05] the way up
[2:28:07] is down always
[2:28:09] you want power
[2:28:11] see how humble
[2:28:12] you can get
[2:28:14] just get away from all your worldly
[2:28:17] thinking
[2:28:19] and humble yourself before god
[2:28:22] and then you've got more power
[2:28:25] than a man that runs all over the
[2:28:27] building
[2:28:28] and makes a lot of noise see
[2:28:33] because you have been able to conquer
[2:28:37] yourself
[2:28:41] who is your own worst enemy
[2:28:44] conquering yourself
[2:28:46] is always the struggle
[2:28:49] lord help me
[2:28:52] with my unbelief
[2:28:57] and commit yourself to christ
[2:29:00] you'll see
[2:29:02] to humble yourself before him
[2:29:05] that's
[2:29:06] real power
[2:29:09] show me a church that's humble real
[2:29:12] humble
[2:29:13] not arrogant a church that sweet humble
[2:29:16] church i'll show you a church
[2:29:19] that has favor and power of god in it
[2:29:23] that's right
[2:29:24] that's the thing it takes humility
[2:29:27] humbling ourselves
[2:29:29] before god
[2:29:30] letting god just work through us
[2:29:33] you don't have to make a lot of
[2:29:37] noise
[2:29:42] let's move on
[2:29:44] and then of course
[2:29:46] you know
[2:29:49] that
[2:29:52] he he goes on to speak
[2:29:54] here i'd like to read this statement
[2:29:59] may there come forth a revival this is
[2:30:02] the indictment
[2:30:04] paragraph i believe it's
[2:30:06] 3 90
[2:30:09] 1 or 2.
[2:30:10] may they come forth a revival
[2:30:13] of the just
[2:30:15] and a great power come among the church
[2:30:19] just before it's going
[2:30:22] it's hard to pray that
[2:30:25] because you promised it it's not hard to
[2:30:28] pray that
[2:30:29] because you
[2:30:30] promised it
[2:30:35] and lord
[2:30:37] looking lord for that third pull
[2:30:40] that we know
[2:30:42] that will do great things for us in
[2:30:47] our midst
[2:30:49] now that's to the elect
[2:30:52] this is the other
[2:30:54] side of the voice
[2:30:57] the third pulls to the lost he's
[2:30:59] preaching to the people that have no
[2:31:00] chance of being saved the only people
[2:31:03] that have a chance of being saved are
[2:31:05] those who are saved already
[2:31:12] but they don't know it
[2:31:14] they don't accept it they don't accept
[2:31:17] their election they don't accept who
[2:31:19] they are they don't accept their
[2:31:20] forgiveness they let the world tempt
[2:31:23] them in everything they have worldly
[2:31:25] pursuits seek ye first the kingdom of
[2:31:28] god and god will add everything to you
[2:31:40] this is from christ the mystery of god
[2:31:43] reveal
[2:31:44] not knowing of course
[2:31:46] being spiritual
[2:31:48] you watch spiritual things not knowing
[2:31:51] this god knows it
[2:31:53] but if you turn and look at the clock
[2:31:56] it's on the dot two o'clock the end of
[2:32:00] the second pull
[2:32:08] the third pole is
[2:32:11] at hand
[2:32:13] so we're saying this because there's a
[2:32:14] part of the third pole
[2:32:17] that's for the elect
[2:32:20] and that's what we want to get what is
[2:32:22] it we're going to close up here
[2:32:24] in just a second how can i overcome
[2:32:35] he says
[2:32:37] he said now if you know any people
[2:32:40] around anywhere that's sick
[2:32:42] and wants to be prayed for bring them
[2:32:45] here tonight
[2:32:47] if you have to bring them anyway get
[2:32:50] them here
[2:32:51] that's the main thing
[2:32:54] bring them here tonight
[2:32:56] we all meet together
[2:32:58] it's hard to make calls go places after
[2:33:02] place
[2:33:03] then you leave off someone
[2:33:05] there's hard feelings
[2:33:07] but if you can get them all in one place
[2:33:11] then i could pray for them
[2:33:13] now if the people want to be
[2:33:17] prayed for you say
[2:33:20] will
[2:33:21] that
[2:33:23] you say
[2:33:24] will they oh certainly they'll be prayed
[2:33:27] for bring them on in the lord willing
[2:33:31] we will pray for everyone because i feel
[2:33:36] that third pull
[2:33:38] is beginning to move
[2:33:40] you see within me i want to pray
[2:33:45] for
[2:33:47] everybody
[2:33:49] so
[2:33:50] he's going through now he's sensing
[2:33:54] what the third pole is
[2:33:56] it's something that's going to move
[2:33:59] within him
[2:34:01] people we they went through because in
[2:34:03] the early stages of it when he had the
[2:34:05] vision he saw the tent he saw the room
[2:34:08] he saw the pillar of fire
[2:34:10] and he he he still couldn't quite get it
[2:34:15] because it's got to be revealed to him
[2:34:18] it's got to be unfolded to him he begins
[2:34:20] to see the seals and the opening of that
[2:34:23] word and then he begins to attach that
[2:34:25] to the vision of the third pole and then
[2:34:28] he moves past that and he talks about
[2:34:30] something that's taking place something
[2:34:33] that's happening something that's moving
[2:34:36] something that's going to be
[2:34:38] uh
[2:34:40] uh really
[2:34:41] for
[2:34:42] the individual
[2:34:45] and then let us just read these last few
[2:34:49] statements to you
[2:34:51] to
[2:34:52] see if we can grab
[2:34:54] a greater
[2:34:56] understanding
[2:35:00] i think i'll go ahead and go back this
[2:35:02] is perfect faith
[2:35:04] paragraph 64.
[2:35:09] now brother ben is going to tie these
[2:35:11] quotes in
[2:35:13] to the third paul
[2:35:15] at the end of the book so there's a part
[2:35:18] of this voice that's to you
[2:35:22] you can have this faith
[2:35:24] you can have this power you can have the
[2:35:27] ability
[2:35:28] to know who you are
[2:35:32] know that you possess the word
[2:35:35] and know that the word will do exactly
[2:35:38] what it promised to do
[2:35:42] we are partakers of divine nature
[2:35:46] by exceedingly great and precious
[2:35:49] promises
[2:35:51] so when a believer can take the promise
[2:35:56] know he has the authority to have that
[2:35:58] promise
[2:35:59] no that promise is to him a possession
[2:36:04] and he's not sitting there waiting for
[2:36:06] thus saith the lord so to speak because
[2:36:09] he's already got the saith the lord
[2:36:13] because it's the word
[2:36:18] and he can take that word
[2:36:24] because he's got the character to take
[2:36:26] that word
[2:36:28] and he can perform the functions of that
[2:36:32] word that was committed to him as a son
[2:36:36] and daughter of god or her
[2:36:42] oh
[2:36:46] just think of where we are
[2:36:49] we're sitting down
[2:36:52] studying in the message
[2:36:54] and not making it flesh
[2:37:00] we're looking back at everything brother
[2:37:02] madam random seconds that it's
[2:37:04] vindicated because he did it
[2:37:09] he vindicated that he had the possession
[2:37:12] of it
[2:37:14] there are certain parts of his ministry
[2:37:16] that are particular to that ministry
[2:37:19] but faith and believing every promise of
[2:37:22] god's word is for every believer
[2:37:26] and that's what he came to do he came
[2:37:28] back to restore
[2:37:30] the word of god
[2:37:32] amen
[2:37:34] thank you lord
[2:37:36] so
[2:37:37] it's
[2:37:38] the whole purpose
[2:37:40] of the third pull
[2:37:43] the lost weren't going to receive it
[2:37:46] but it was going to be made flesh
[2:37:49] in the elect
[2:37:54] now let's read here if we could
[2:38:06] and let's start at paragraph 63.
[2:38:13] now remember they had the word
[2:38:16] and the word was flesh then
[2:38:19] and the word told them i give you power
[2:38:23] i give you power
[2:38:24] and they had power but they didn't have
[2:38:27] faith to operate the word
[2:38:30] that was
[2:38:33] in them
[2:38:36] now
[2:38:38] we're talking the third poll
[2:38:40] we're talking about the part that's to
[2:38:42] the elect
[2:38:43] if they have the faith
[2:38:46] if they have the power the word
[2:38:49] they have the faith in he says
[2:38:52] they had the power
[2:38:54] but they didn't have faith
[2:38:56] to operate the word that was in them
[2:38:59] notice this
[2:39:01] pentecost
[2:39:03] always is talking about getting the
[2:39:05] power
[2:39:06] getting the power getting the power
[2:39:09] it's a revival of an idea they have in
[2:39:13] their mind
[2:39:15] of an old power that the church had
[2:39:19] that power was not
[2:39:22] given because the pillar of fires has
[2:39:26] they were endued with power from on high
[2:39:29] but what that power was was christ in
[2:39:32] them
[2:39:35] that's what they got in the upper room i
[2:39:38] will not leave you comfortless but i'll
[2:39:40] be with you even in you that's how they
[2:39:43] knew the power was there because they
[2:39:45] knew he was there
[2:39:49] and oh how we could go into the teaching
[2:39:51] of the anointing being the outside and
[2:39:53] the ring falls oh you just start seeing
[2:39:55] everything that brother brahms saying
[2:39:56] you you just go wow
[2:40:01] okay they didn't have effect that was in
[2:40:03] them you see what i mean but jesus had
[2:40:06] it
[2:40:07] he was the word
[2:40:09] and he had faith
[2:40:11] that
[2:40:13] what he said would happen
[2:40:15] oh bring them here how long will i
[2:40:18] suffer with you now jesus had what
[2:40:22] faith
[2:40:28] this haunted the people brother brown
[2:40:30] was preaching to
[2:40:31] because they think he's a pre-existing
[2:40:34] second person
[2:40:36] they don't understand he's a man
[2:40:38] that received a baptism
[2:40:42] and that you could be baptized with the
[2:40:44] same baptism
[2:40:46] hang in there younger people
[2:40:50] this is just an
[2:40:51] old fellow
[2:40:53] he said
[2:40:55] he had faith with his power
[2:40:58] how did he
[2:41:00] he said i can do nothing myself
[2:41:04] why he relied upon what he was
[2:41:08] he relied knowing that he was the word
[2:41:12] and he that had faith in god
[2:41:15] who made him the word
[2:41:18] he was god the word
[2:41:20] and they was in him
[2:41:23] and that gave him faith because he
[2:41:26] understood his position
[2:41:29] he knowed what he was
[2:41:31] because the scripture had said he was
[2:41:34] this
[2:41:35] and there every scripture tied in
[2:41:39] to prove that he was exactly what the
[2:41:42] scripture said he would be
[2:41:45] and he knew
[2:41:47] what he was
[2:41:50] now
[2:41:52] third poll
[2:41:55] therefore he relied upon what god had
[2:41:58] made him
[2:41:59] and if he did that
[2:42:02] then can't we rely upon what god
[2:42:07] made us
[2:42:08] as believers
[2:42:11] now so this is what so now brother
[2:42:13] graham's coming back he gets this
[2:42:15] revelation and why christ speak
[2:42:18] i'm made this way
[2:42:21] i'm not going to doubt anymore
[2:42:23] i'm going to go forward i'm not going to
[2:42:25] let those unbelievers bring me down
[2:42:28] anymore i'm not going to let them talk
[2:42:30] me out of it i'm not going to let them
[2:42:32] criticize my ministry i'm not letting me
[2:42:34] be jealous of my nature
[2:42:37] i'm done letting them affect me
[2:42:43] i'm going to have faith
[2:42:45] in what god made me
[2:42:48] i'm going to go deliver
[2:42:51] the third pool
[2:42:53] to the elect
[2:42:55] because they're lost
[2:42:59] and you can put the messenger to sleep
[2:43:04] they all said oh god took him
[2:43:08] no
[2:43:09] he went to sleep
[2:43:11] because he had delivered
[2:43:14] the third pool
[2:43:17] to the elect
[2:43:22] that was going to transform them
[2:43:30] if he did that then can't we rely upon
[2:43:33] what god made us as believers
[2:43:36] these signs shall fall then that believe
[2:43:39] had faith in what he was
[2:43:42] and if you are a believer you have faith
[2:43:44] in what you are
[2:43:46] you're a believer
[2:43:49] if you've got faith in god the bible
[2:43:51] said over here
[2:43:53] if our hearts condemn us not then we
[2:43:55] have faith
[2:43:56] but if our hearts condemn us
[2:43:59] then we we have faith we have confidence
[2:44:02] towards god if you want to read that
[2:44:05] follow in john 3 21 the scripture is
[2:44:09] written down
[2:44:10] so he's talking about this beautiful
[2:44:14] wonderful
[2:44:16] third poll
[2:44:25] i gotta
[2:44:26] find out where this is at here
[2:44:29] i got a paragraph
[2:44:31] mark down here i don't know if it's
[2:44:32] necessary
[2:44:34] yes
[2:44:35] go to
[2:44:37] paragraph 114 perfect faith
[2:44:41] and so when a man lives by faith
[2:44:44] and walks by faith i mean substance
[2:44:47] faith
[2:44:48] he is isolated from the entire world
[2:44:52] and becomes a new creature in christ
[2:44:55] now we're getting into bride material
[2:44:59] see we're getting in to rapturing
[2:45:03] condition
[2:45:06] so you so the third pole has a substance
[2:45:10] to it
[2:45:13] or if i could say this a revelation
[2:45:17] that's going to empower the church
[2:45:21] to get them in to rapturing condition
[2:45:25] they're not trying to reproduce an age
[2:45:28] gone by
[2:45:29] i read the quotes we're on a journey
[2:45:32] we've got something to accomplish we've
[2:45:35] got a goal in mind we're working towards
[2:45:38] a rapture speak to the people and move
[2:45:41] on so now the third pull if you could
[2:45:44] tie it into another message the third
[2:45:47] exodus it's a message calling the people
[2:45:50] out of the unbelief into the reception
[2:45:54] of the power of the resurrection not
[2:45:57] manifested in a bunch of noise
[2:46:02] but manifested in a perfect faith
[2:46:06] in the heart
[2:46:08] that they are those whose name is
[2:46:11] written on the lamb's book of life
[2:46:18] hard to believe it isn't it brother the
[2:46:20] old mind just
[2:46:23] and why did he choose you i don't know i
[2:46:26] would have never picked you
[2:46:34] but he did
[2:46:37] he didn't have to
[2:46:39] but he did
[2:46:43] wait a minute i look he did
[2:46:47] i did he did
[2:46:54] who can lay anything
[2:46:57] to the charge
[2:46:58] of god's elect
[2:47:00] because the seed of god
[2:47:02] remaineth
[2:47:04] in him
[2:47:05] he's god's
[2:47:07] it's his gene
[2:47:09] he said that your first husband calls
[2:47:11] you to do that
[2:47:13] he's totally divorced he's dead
[2:47:17] in other words i killed him
[2:47:28] i mean substitute he's isolated from the
[2:47:30] entire world because he's a new teacher
[2:47:33] in christ there is now you're getting
[2:47:35] into bride material you're getting in a
[2:47:37] rapturing condition
[2:47:39] that means
[2:47:41] for he says
[2:47:43] that means
[2:47:45] for each one of us
[2:47:48] not just the pastor now
[2:47:50] deacons trustees
[2:47:53] that means
[2:47:54] for the laity
[2:47:56] every individual
[2:47:58] walks in a world with god
[2:48:02] alone
[2:48:06] that's a tough cookie
[2:48:09] to swallow
[2:48:14] because
[2:48:15] we love groups
[2:48:18] we love protection
[2:48:20] we love sitting under popular ministries
[2:48:23] because we feel there's a safety there
[2:48:26] but this third poll empowers you
[2:48:30] as an individual
[2:48:32] you're baptized into a kingdom
[2:48:35] and there's nobody in there
[2:48:37] but you and god see
[2:48:40] he gives the orders and you pack them
[2:48:43] out whatever he says
[2:48:46] there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere
[2:48:50] you're walking right on
[2:48:54] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[2:48:57] the world can talk you out of it
[2:49:00] you go right on just the same
[2:49:03] now you're coming into perfect faith
[2:49:08] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[2:49:12] faith never fails
[2:49:15] he was a mystic to them
[2:49:17] with his perfect faith
[2:49:20] and so is it now
[2:49:22] with those who have perfect faith are
[2:49:25] mistakes to others
[2:49:28] my note there says
[2:49:30] the third poll
[2:49:33] now paragraph 177
[2:49:38] i see just how advanced
[2:49:40] my church is
[2:49:42] on what we believe in
[2:49:44] see just how advanced the people are
[2:49:47] how they're
[2:49:48] they're ready to take
[2:49:50] the sword
[2:49:51] and walk out in front line and say
[2:49:54] i challenge you satan
[2:49:56] i challenge you
[2:49:59] you can't
[2:50:01] make me disbelieve
[2:50:03] anymore
[2:50:05] what are
[2:50:07] what are these things done for
[2:50:10] so the people will believe
[2:50:12] it's the word
[2:50:14] it's where that shows that i am
[2:50:17] preaching to you the truth the word
[2:50:20] the word was made flesh
[2:50:22] made flesh
[2:50:24] in you
[2:50:25] made word
[2:50:27] made live in you
[2:50:29] made life in you
[2:50:31] made life
[2:50:33] in me
[2:50:35] that's the voice
[2:50:39] that's the other voice
[2:50:42] one voice is to the lost the other voice
[2:50:44] is to you
[2:50:46] and he finally draws this in
[2:50:48] conclusion on paragraph 84
[2:50:54] and this is what he says
[2:50:57] this is coming into that
[2:50:59] third poll
[2:51:02] he gives all these explanations
[2:51:05] of perfect faith and he says now this is
[2:51:09] that
[2:51:10] coming in to the third pole
[2:51:12] this is what it is it's that perfect
[2:51:14] faith that's accepting who you are is
[2:51:17] accepting that you're elected it's
[2:51:20] understanding that this voice
[2:51:24] that's rejected by the world
[2:51:28] even those that use the feast with us
[2:51:31] has gone out from us
[2:51:33] and they've become spots and wrinkles on
[2:51:37] our feast
[2:51:41] but you know
[2:51:43] it's to you
[2:51:47] i totally accept
[2:51:49] that this message was for me
[2:51:53] why did he say that the
[2:51:55] other voice of that third poll was to
[2:51:58] the
[2:51:58] unbeliever and they're totally lost
[2:52:02] so you would quit
[2:52:05] listening to them
[2:52:12] don't listen
[2:52:16] you're special
[2:52:19] you're elected
[2:52:22] how beautiful
[2:52:26] shall we neglect such a great salvation
[2:52:31] i'm pleading with you this morning take
[2:52:34] courage saints get on fire understand
[2:52:37] who you are understand how important you
[2:52:40] are
[2:52:41] understand what you possess
[2:52:43] let's don't be defeated
[2:52:47] this is that
[2:52:49] this is coming into the third poll he
[2:52:52] just preaches perfect
[2:52:54] faith he says
[2:52:56] this is coming in to the third pole i'm
[2:53:00] believing it now i want to ask you
[2:53:03] sincerely a question
[2:53:04] you that pass through the prayer line
[2:53:07] can you actually believe and feel now
[2:53:10] that there is something happened in you
[2:53:14] since you've had hands laid on you
[2:53:17] raise your hand
[2:53:19] there it is
[2:53:21] that's
[2:53:22] what
[2:53:23] we've waited for
[2:53:26] this is just the start
[2:53:29] starting to bloom now
[2:53:31] just start this is for a purpose
[2:53:34] i did this for a purpose i'm working out
[2:53:38] something i'm taking this charge of
[2:53:41] faith
[2:53:42] and going right back to the beginning
[2:53:45] and come in see
[2:53:47] a kind
[2:53:49] a
[2:53:50] to kind of raise faith
[2:53:52] in a bracket
[2:53:55] where you've never noticed it that way
[2:53:57] before
[2:53:58] not faith but perfect faith
[2:54:02] built up in here
[2:54:04] and watch a perfect god
[2:54:07] with a perfect heart
[2:54:09] keep a perfect promise
[2:54:12] by his perfect word
[2:54:14] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[2:54:18] discerning the thoughts
[2:54:21] of the
[2:54:23] of the heart what were coming now into
[2:54:26] the perfection
[2:54:28] because the people has to come
[2:54:31] to this
[2:54:32] in order for
[2:54:35] the
[2:54:36] rapture
[2:54:38] that's what's holding it away right now
[2:54:40] is waiting for the church to come into
[2:54:44] perfect rapturing faith i'm looking for
[2:54:46] it it means a lot of shaking down for me
[2:54:51] it means a lot for you but together
[2:54:54] we'll make it by the grace
[2:54:57] of god
[2:55:04] a wonderful understanding
[2:55:08] that
[2:55:12] we're in the third poll
[2:55:16] really what it is
[2:55:18] really what it was
[2:55:20] it was brother branham coming to the
[2:55:22] place where he had to receive a new
[2:55:25] faith
[2:55:26] a perfect faith a perfect understanding
[2:55:29] of his ministry
[2:55:30] then he could go forth and say it's not
[2:55:33] for everybody
[2:55:34] why would he look at a people and say
[2:55:36] they don't have anything in them to
[2:55:37] believe with
[2:55:41] you know why
[2:55:43] he knew he was preaching to the lost
[2:55:46] but he knew you were there
[2:55:51] he knew you would hear
[2:55:53] and he knew if you were one of his
[2:55:57] that there was another voice
[2:56:00] in the third poll
[2:56:02] that was to you
[2:56:06] that was going to empower you
[2:56:08] with not a bunch of noise
[2:56:12] but with a solid
[2:56:14] peace
[2:56:16] in god's word
[2:56:19] that every promise in the book is mine
[2:56:23] every chapter
[2:56:24] every verse every line
[2:56:27] i feel different
[2:56:31] i feel i've got life
[2:56:33] i feel i have the word of god living in
[2:56:36] me
[2:56:37] i'm not
[2:56:38] what i was
[2:56:40] i'm not what i want to be
[2:56:42] but i'm not what i used to be
[2:56:45] and i know that the word of god is
[2:56:47] working in me
[2:56:49] bringing me to perfection because i've
[2:56:51] heard
[2:56:52] the second voice
[2:56:54] or i've heard
[2:56:57] the other voice
[2:56:59] of the third poll
[2:57:01] to the elect
[2:57:04] you have a wonderful afternoon and
[2:57:06] enjoy your day no service tonight
[2:57:10] communion next sunday
[2:57:12] and we'll be back on our
[2:57:14] regular schedule
[2:57:15] pray for the meetings coming up
[2:57:20] we have a few guests coming and
[2:57:23] and uh
[2:57:25] you know so
[2:57:26] we know we can tighten up a little bit
[2:57:28] if we have to
[2:57:30] believe it or not we've taken four pews
[2:57:33] out of
[2:57:35] the sanctuary
[2:57:37] so we'll do something
[2:57:39] but anyway pray god's moving
[2:57:42] he's accomplishing
[2:57:44] very very many things
[2:57:47] and i'm looking forward to hearing more
[2:57:50] testimonies like we heard today
[2:57:53] and that quiet
[2:57:56] way that god works
[2:57:58] remember he said the third poll wouldn't
[2:58:00] be a show
[2:58:05] it's that mystic place
[2:58:07] where he meets the believer in there
[2:58:09] with that word
[2:58:11] and that believer takes that promise
[2:58:14] and they know it's his
[2:58:16] and they live by it and nobody
[2:58:19] can talk them
[2:58:21] out of it
[2:58:22] don't be ashamed
[2:58:25] of a lost world
[2:58:29] he preached to him they know his message
[2:58:34] they twist his message
[2:58:36] they say it means this they say it means
[2:58:38] that they say he was taken for this
[2:58:41] reason he was taken for that reason
[2:58:43] but isn't it amazing he says they can
[2:58:45] put me to sleep
[2:58:47] but my message is going to live on
[2:58:50] my third pull
[2:58:52] is going to be manifested it'll be
[2:58:54] manifested in the lost
[2:58:57] and it will be manifested in the elected
[2:59:00] settle it
[2:59:02] in
[2:59:03] your heart
[2:59:06] your election
[2:59:09] settle it
[2:59:13] quit fighting that fight
[2:59:15] it's already been one for you if you've
[2:59:18] heard the elect voice of the second poll
[2:59:23] it's because you're elected
[2:59:27] if you disbelieve it it's because
[2:59:30] you're an unbeliever
[2:59:33] the voice
[2:59:35] to the lost
[2:59:37] the voice
[2:59:39] to the elect
[2:59:41] choose this day which voice you will
[2:59:43] serve
[2:59:44] as for me and my house
[2:59:47] will serve the voice
[2:59:49] of the elect god bless you
[3:00:03] qff

[3:09:42] let's pray
[3:09:44] heavenly father lord as we
[3:09:46] sung the song lord we know it's off of a
[3:09:49] story that brother branham would talk
[3:09:50] about lord how the eagle flew over the
[3:09:52] chicken yard
[3:09:54] lord when we think about each of us that
[3:09:55] we're in of the world
[3:09:57] or maybe
[3:09:58] dibbling dabbling out in things lord and
[3:10:00] you felt the need to send the message
[3:10:02] forth
[3:10:03] lord there's even been one some of us
[3:10:05] lord that have had a testimony that the
[3:10:07] person that witnesses to us maybe was
[3:10:09] just a carrier maybe not even serving
[3:10:11] the lord maybe not even having a full
[3:10:13] revelation of what this message was lord
[3:10:16] but you saw fit to bring it by our way
[3:10:19] lord i thank you for
[3:10:20] dealing with brother david the way you
[3:10:22] dealt with him today lord we know
[3:10:24] there's always two voices pulling on us
[3:10:26] lord and
