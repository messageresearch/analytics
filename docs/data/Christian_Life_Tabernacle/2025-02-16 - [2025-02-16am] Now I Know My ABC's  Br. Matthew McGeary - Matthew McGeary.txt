of the Gospel we ask you to bless our service today in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning uh this morning we're going to have a h a reproach just forgive my eye I I've got the stitches in my right eye and um I I I never know when they're going to stab me you know so if you see me go like that that I'm not under the spirit I'm I'm under the uh uh the Stitch so uh but uh open your Bibles with me we're going to have a couple reports today and um and uh uh uh and we're we're going to try to do um these reports and we have a purpose in them thank you musicians B so much and this is all about uh what's been on our heart as our path forward and uh so the the reason for these reports this morning is to make us uh uh all of us more aware of the working of the church and to help each of us to be more a part of the body's operation and the sacrifice that is being made on your behalf so um just so that you might understand uh it takes about we have about 60 staff members just here on Church alone musicians ministers Sunday school teachers Sunday school helpers cleaning so it takes a lot of people uh working and a lot of uh donated uh time and effort so that's why we want to have uh uh these uh meetings and uh and uh so uh before we read this report maybe I could get who's a good scripture reader Dylan he's a good scripture reader would you come up here for me please kind of like uh Moses and Aaron you think I fit half of that I know you take care of Aron real day yeah I don't know about that that's a but anyway if you I'd like just to to uh uh you to read the ninth chapter of 2 corini uh to us and this is all about Paul taking up offering so uh we want to start right there if you would my brother please it says for as touching the ministering to the Saints it is Superfluous for me to write to you for I know the forwardness of your mind for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia that AA was ready a year ago and your Zeal hath provoked very many yet have I sent the Brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as I said ye may be ready lest happily if they of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the Brethren that they would be that they would go before unto you and make up before hand your Bounty whereof ye had noticed before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness but this I say he which Seth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which Seth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful giver and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever now he that ministereth seed to the Sewer both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through us the Thanksgiving to God for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the Saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God whilst by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift thank you really God bless you may be seated uh before I get into my our report this morning and uh uh I I want uh to uh just read this to you uh this is um um we've we have some guidelines for the fellowship hall and uh we'd like you to read these to you uh so the purpose of the fellowship hall is to support churchwide activities and functions of Christian Life Tabernacle as scheduled and announced by the pastor and deacons the church functions will always be priority use of the fellowship hall for example Sunday school foot washing overflow youth meetings ex said when not otherwise in use for one of these purposes the fellowship hall is generally available for use after and around service times providing a common space for the people in the church to visit with one another Comfort crying babies and practice music specials the fellowship Paul is still considered a part of church property and of a Christian Life Tabernacle and should be treated with the same level of respect especially when in use for church services the fellowship hall should not be treated uh should be treated with the same respect and level of reverence as the sanctuary the fellowship has not a daycare for facility playground or gymnasium parents should ensure their children are accompanied by an adult and treating the fellowship hall with respect at all times the fellowship hall is not to be used for hosting private events dinners or parties and is reserved only for use of approved churchwide activities and function so let me say it this way uh we'll host baby showers in the fellowship hall uh wedding showers in the fellowship hall but no private birthdays or anniversary parties or anything like that um it uh and so families may bring food into the fellowship hall after church service to eat while visiting with each other but the kitchen fac facilities within the fellowship hall may not be used to cook meals meals must be prepared or purchased outside the fellowship hall the kitchen is reserved only for supported approved churchwide activities listed above and is never to be used for General cooking or meal preparation for personal or private use each person is responsible for cleaning their own messes and removing their own trash any tables or Chairs set up or rearranged must be returned to their original position when finished please do not expect your brothers and sisters to clean up after you the refrigerator may be used for keeping food cool temporarily but must be removed the same day over night food storage is not allowed and if there are any questions above please contact uh contact me and we'll certainly discuss it so we want you to know that's available for you if you want to eat there after service also if you uh feel you need to feed your child uh during Service uh that's where you do it so no more eating in the nursery here no eating in the church so we're trying to uh keep all the crumbs out of here and so the Cockroaches can stay over there and they won't be in in here so uh is is that fair everybody think that's good amen so you're welcome to use it after service and uh just clean up after yourselves amen so uh to uh go back to um our our report uh this morning uh and the goal of what our report is in uh trying to help each of us understand the operations of the church our church uh has bylaws um as a guideline for our operation ation and we are a nonprofit entity uh governed by the pastor a deacon board and a trustee board so uh we don't we are an entity we're a nonprofit entity which means that your offerings and your tithings are tax deductible and uh so uh is and so we uh and so our Deacon board and we'll have a deacon report here I'm giving the trustee report the Deacon board uh consists of myself as the managing partner brother Chris Harris is the chairperson John mway Gary Bennett Manuel Roso and Darien brother Daren they are the uh uh deacons uh uh brother John tamamo had to step down due to uh different things though he helps us from time to time the trustee board uh consists of myself as the managing partner brother Mike Parks Jr as the chairperson to Wanda as the secretary Brother Richard Greenley as the treasurer Matt Thomas act advisor and Jonathan lesby as advisor those are the uh operating officers and brother Tim Siler is our Sunday school and superintendent and he'll give us a report here in uh a moment now our church has two sources of income so there's two sources of income to our church tithing and offering and the tithing and the offering uh can be rendered in different ways it can be uh uh rendered online at the church website through vanco which is an online payment so if you want to make an automatic draft or you want to make a a payment you can go online there's a section there uh for offering and tithing and then you can uh do follow the steps and you can make uh I guess that's referred to as online payments uh we're not going to come to you and collect uh this is not a collection agency as Paul said you give out of what's purposed in your heart so uh there's no obligation here for diving and offering that obligation only has to lie within yourself according to your own conviction so we we hold this facility open uh for whosoever Will and everyone's welcome and uh so uh the other way you by mail you can mail uh your offering and also we pass the offering basket and and they're divided by um envelopes uh we have tying envelopes uh uh offering envelopes building fund envelopes you can put your offering in and uh these will be uh distributed to the right account so we have two accounts in the church we have our offering account and our tithing account and uh if uh do we have that uh uh division here and uh okay so uh um and and this is this is so each uh you know so you're you're not in the dark you know what I mean we want you to know what's going on we want to be transparent uh we're not ashamed and so by our bylaws and and by our the our church operation we have divided these accounts in two parts and the offering account is managed by the trustee board they manage the offering account the tithing account is managed by the pastor so each of these accounts are separate and they're managed by two different sources the P manages the tithing account and the trustees manage the operation account and here are the categories that the trustees are responsible for and so all the expenses that fall in these categories the trustees take care of out of the offering account so you have to imagine we have to have I don't know I think our congregation has grown now to somewhere around 500 members so we've got to have some sort of system of managing things you know so we don't want it to be a secret this is just straightforward as it can be so here's the responsibilities of the offering account it's building repairs Church administrative expens es and those are items like uh uh uh Bank fees uh check fees uh things that might come under uh administrative things Church insurance and we'll come to that in just a moment Church insurance is paid out of the church operating offering fund uh Church maintenance so any that needs to be maintained broken toilet valves uh broken tile everything with maintenance all comes out of the offering account uh the church mortgage is paid for out of the offering account church security and uh uh we have a pretty extensive security system our brother Chris May tap on that uh the electrical bill the library expenses miscellaneous purchases natural gas Sunday School telephone internet and water almost anything to do with the physical operation of the church comes out of the offering fund that's the responsibility of the trustees to manage this money so you have a facility that doesn't get run down that operates right that you does everybody enjoy air conditioning thank the trustees do you enjoy heat so all these things that you enjoy uh are provided by your offering managed by the trustee board uh and I I I know this is a financial report and I I don't have any skilled way to make it unboringed that uh you your heart will be blessed and and then the the other income that we receive is through the tithing account and these are all the responsibilities of the tithing account all annual and youth meetings so any meeting meetings that we have any fellowships that we have dinners that we have any activity that we have all those are funded from the tithing account it's separate from the building uh operation benevolence is all uh taken care of from the tithing account and benevolence goes from uh meeting people's financial needs to uh helping uh in many many areas so we take care of of those financial needs Church camps and transportation funeral expenses um our annual meetings uh uh you know we have uh offerings to ministers hotel rooms uh all the all these expenses are all taken care of uh monthly men's me meetings outreaches any form of Outreach uh pastoral staff uh any uh spending that we find uh that we would call it discretionary if we choose to buy something or or get something for the church a microphone or or whatever all those are taken care of the pastor salar is taken care of and now the tithing fund the the library is operated by the trustees but the tithing fund supplements the library so in other words we transfer money from the uh tithing account into the offering account to handle any overrides or or and Supply take care of all the library expenses uh we supplement the operating fund if we don't have enough money to cover our expenses then we supplement that we supplement the Sunday uh uh School uh funding so the Sunday School all the expenses of the Sunday School are transferred into the operating account and taken care of from the operating account and then any visiting pastors Ministeries uh church offering all those come out of uh those accounts so that's the way that uh we're set up uh some of you may be accountants or or business people and you may have a better way to do all of this but this is the way it started and and this has been our foundation for 45 years and it's worked pretty well so so far so I think our lifestyle have shown that we haven't uh there's not been a lot of extravagance um going on so uh now I'd just like to uh just take a moment and uh bring to your attention um let me see if I can find that here um there's one other paper that I want want to bring up let me see if I let me just give me a moment here if I can find it um for you I know I know you're hiding from me well uh I I I must have uh it must have gotten away from me but I I wanted us you to know that um um as you know we have just finished building our building project and um uh we've completed it the whole project the remodeling the buying of the property the remodeling of the old Sanctuary the building of this Sanctuary the parking lot The Pavilion the storage shed the Landscaping everything that we've done it cost us about $2,500,000 and that's been going on over the last 5 years and uh we collected uh quite a bit of money in our fund uh and we borrowed money and so what we owe now on the building is this whole complex is we owe $836,000 and our goal is to pay that off in 10 years if the Lord carries uh those of you that remain uh you're free to use it uh and if you can make the payment go ahead um uh I'm sure that after the Rapture people will pray more than they ever prayed you know what I mean so I imagine if the Rapture takes place and you're left that you'll probably be here every day so you know the rules right and you know how to keep it operating but my advice to you is let's leave amen let's leave it for somebody else so uh so um that that's what that's hit is now we just want to take a quick moment and look at our expenses and and uh so they'll put this up this is our monthly expenses and uh and uh and the categories that are involved and we'll focus more on the monthly expense um and um uh so I uh you can see so I you can follow it up but we'll take down the middle and you can look to each side so we have Administration costs they're not much just about $50 a month stamps uh computers whatever small items there are our electricity is one of our largest items and it is $1,500 a month we we we uh cool about uh 15,000 square ft so that's how large our facility is so 15,000 uh square fet and it our electrical bill for lighting air conditioning and all the other sources uh runs about $1,500 a month the library runs us about $50 a month uh uh Church cleaning maintenance and repair uh runs us about uh $2400 a month so we clean the church all, 1500 square ft two times a week and some and then sometimes more often depending on events uh uh operating supplies and purchases run about uh 250 a month I I believe that uh may include some of our paper goods our mortgage is5 ,1 152 a month and a lot of people have homewor is that big you know but anyway that is uh that's what our mortgage is our natural gas runs about $125 a month uh safety and insurance runs about $2,200 a month Sunday school is not uh too much expenses uh right now it averages about 50 but if they were going to have a project or or make something or do something then that project would be covered by the tithing account telephone and internet about a 100 a month water about 900 a month now ground maintenance has been been donated to our church uh for the last few years so we haven't had to pay that that's been donated and uh but if that donation sometimes comes to an end uh then we would add that to our expenses so this kind of just gives you a general idea of where we are uh we read the scripture to you uh so that you could give of your Bounty that you would be prepared and give of a cheerful heart and and understand that it it does take a lot of effort and the deacons and the trustees and the Sunday school they all put quite a bit of time into it uh for your sake so at this time I'd like to ask brother Chris to come up and he's just going to give you a little rundown on uh the obligations of the Deacons um so and you're all a part of this you understand this is you you know it's not us providing a place for you this is you and you can pray us out of here anytime so if you all went home tonight and got down on your knees and ask God to remove me I'm sure that he oblig you and uh and go on but we're here for you so brother Chris you would please God bless you so like Brother David said this won't be with elegant speech I'm trying I'm G to try to unpack this quickly um first thank you for your patience and support through the transition of the two buildings there were a lot of things that we learned on the spot things we didn't know until we know so we've we've adapted we've learned and we're constantly trying to improve on what we're doing as Brother David said current deacons Gary Bennett brother Manuel Roso Darian arenzy John mway and myself and so I'll just quickly go through kind of what we're doing each Deacon is designated to oversee specific areas within the church ensuring all roles and responsibilities and security measures are effectively managed Brother Gary assists Brother David the ministers the song leaders before and during service his duties include preparing microphone equipment coordinating messages with the sound team Team titles dates portions played as well as addressing any other needs that may arise Brother Gary also helped schedule appointments for those wishing to see Brother David after the service so if you do need to see Brother David uh please try to get with Brother Gary first so he can coordinate that with Brother David um during service he covers the right side of the sanctuary our brother manual Roso oversees the front entry leading into the fellowship hall during pre-service he supports the logistics of Sunday school children manages interpretation needs collects announcements and prayer requests and the collection of tithes and offerings brother Manuel covers the front left side of the sanctuary during service our precious brother Darien arenzy our faithful greeter at the main entry supports collecting announcements and prayer requests manages interpretation equipment and welcomes visiting guests and firsttime attendees during the service brother Daran will help cover the rear of the sanctuary brother John MAA helps seat people pre- service and covers the left rear of the sanctuary during the service he oversees the back of the sanctuary the foyer and any other needs that arise brother John also helps keep an eye on all the entryways that lead exiting the building from the front of the church uh and occasionally takes a a sweep out in the parking lot to to look at things uh I assist with seating and covering the right rear of the building during service also help carry the rear of the sanctuary the cry room and the fouryear during service um again I help John we ensure all entryways are secured after Sunday School dismissal once the service has started and monitor these entryways and parking lot via security cameras so as Brother David mentioned we do have multiple cameras throughout the building into the parking lot and we do have also a few Brothers in the congregation that do help us monitor these to keep an eye on us keep an eye on our vehicles and things going on outside um we did start we made an adjustment with prayer requests and announcements we are going to collect these up until 5 minutes prior to service so that way we can get them to um the song leader he can go through them collect those prepare those and um any that are not collected or are turned in after the 5 minutes we'll announce those the next following service um the other thing I had was Brother David mentioned the fellowship hall is now available to feed the children but he went through that and last and not least seating and temperature are always a Hot Topic or cold depending on who you are and where you sit but uh we are currently working on a few improvements to make that a little more efficient so be patient with us we'll get it a little more dialed in um last but not least we never know how many people we're going to get for service so we are anticipating we have a lot of visitors here today we're packed 400 people um so that's why brother John and I try to strategically place people so we can get everybody in here so it's another cry for your help and support please if you can especially on Sunday mornings try to move as as close to the front as possible um because when the when the middle and the rear is full uh we have empty spaces up here we can't fit families so we're sitting families and chairs and along the island in the Overflow when we have empty spaces here so it's just another um you know kindly asking for your support there and um that's all that I have anything else you need uh again we're here to serve we're doing our best we're learning as we go so please be patient if you have any questions or suggestions let us know if they're bad or they criticism brother Darion has made himself available so please take those to brother Darion there's just a lot goes in it so you might just walk in but somebody's watching you so uh but anyway we're we're trying to make everything work smoothly so anyway I think this is probably one of the the most important offices in the church and I I just can't even express how pleased I am how it's all come together and the service that's been done uh for our children our our children are are f future and and uh Sunday school means more to us now probably than ever um there's uh such radical thinking out there and we just desire uh to have the gospel just brought to our children and brother Tim's been in charge of that so we're going to ask brother Tim to come and give you a an idea maybe some of you don't have children but this will let you know what's going on uh with our Sunday school Tim's just done a spectacular job God bless you brother appreciate you thank you brother David brother Chris as well uh a lot of work a lot of upkeep a lot of strain but as Paul said he thought it necessary to exhort the Brethren and the sisters amen because uh it takes not only the effort but the uh the intent behind it and our intent is to raise our children in uh in a manner as the book of Psalm says teach them the way they should go and they won't depart from it and uh we don't know how long the Lord is going to Tar but we had to prepare brother Bram said if I knew it was coming tomorrow and I was planting potatoes I'd plant those potatoes amen so we don't know what the crop is going to yield um but I I'm blessed that uh we have the facility we have now to uh support our classes of uh and they are growing and they're uh they're getting crowded over there so uh but uh as brother Chris said be patient with us and we'll try to work it out um just a little bit of the logistics is that we start Sunday school at 10:00 um obviously we've been instructed and advised to be the church early move forward 9:30 is uh at least adequate but from 9:30 to 9:45 or so we can receive your children the teachers are usually here and preparing uh but at 10:00 the doors will shut and if you hadn't gotten here by then just bring your children on inside the sanctuary uh we have four classes four age groups of classes they range from 4 years old to 12 years old and uh right now the four to sixes we have 29 enrolled in Sunday school um last week I think we had 22 in that little class when everybody comes it's uh quite crowded sister Rachel Bennett is uh teaching that class and helpers all these uh teachers have helpers and I won't name them because I would surely forget some of them but um 29 and 4 to6 23 and the six to S year olds sister Liz a shes and helpers in that classroom we have 24 8 to n year olds and sister Juliet Bond and helpers 10 them and there are 30 in our 10 to 12 and that's sister Amanda Harris and her helpers so that's 106 total registered uh Sunday school attendees now if they all show up at the same time I don't know what we're going to do but uh just to give you a little scope and background we have uh recently benefited from that supplemental funding brother Dave was talking about to the Sunday school and uh we were able to purchase some a Becca curriculum has large pictures and subject matter there's nothing uh you know doctrinal so to speak uh that would stray from anything the message outside of the Bible is very scriptural and that's just a an outline or a a basic uh subject matter that the teachers can pick from but it has very nice visuals for them to uh to reference so the four to six year olds and I'll just give a little rundown of what they've been studying and going through to give you an example why you're children may come home and ask you some questions uh the ABCs of the Bible okay when you talking 4 to 6 you want to start pretty low but Matthew 22:37 it says love the Lord your God with all your heart soul and mind and also how you can show your love towards others so uh they've received that benefit the six to seven year olds are going through the life of Moses from his birth and how he uh assisted the children of Israel and then to Jethro's daughters and God speaking through the burning bush and last week was Moses and Aaron before pharaoh and today is the first plague so uh the 10 to 12 year olds excuse me the the eight and nine year olds are going through the ministry the life and Ministry of Elisha his calling and training and how God gives and withholds and withholds His blessings and the miraculous pot of oil and the great woman of Schuman how can we forget this humanum I woman and today they're going over non's leprosy the 10 to 12 olds are going through the Bible characters and how their trials and Faith relate to the everyday walk how the Israelites and following God's Commandments and Abraham living by faith and David and his perseverance and recently they explored the Tabernacle the process of the sacrifice the holiest of holies and how Jesus Took the place of the sacrifice and opened up the holiest of holies for us to enter into daily so that's just a brief synopsis of what they're going through obviously the uh the uh the struggle is to keep them all focused and and uh I want to say entertained but we entertain them by the right things and you get everybody on one subject one mind one Accord and uh and you teach them early and as I said they won't depart from it they've also collected about $33 in offerings so we're teaching our children to to get on board with that because brother rown taught us it is part of worship then we come and uh we offer sacrifices of thanks giving and uh we owe it all to him anyway amen so blessed be the name of the Lord that's just uh we are preparing there will be a a little song the children are going to sing but we're we're already thinking about the new facility behind us The Pavilion at the end of the year uh we usually have a little picnic and party for them and uh we've had to rent parks and such in the past but now we have a pavilion provided so we'll probably be planning that so toward uh the end of May or miday something like that as the children get out of school we kind of transition into the summer month so uh if you if you know uh helpers teachers you know greet them thank them profusely because uh they're doing a wonderful wonderful job and I wish you could all just kind of be a fly on the wall in some of the classes and realize that they're receiving beneficial longlasting uh scriptural instruction so thank you to teach done a wonderful job Lord bless youall well I trust that maybe you feel more of a part that was our goal uh that uh you're not ignorant uh Brethren I would not have you be ignorant concerning these things that it takes love it takes time it takes effort it takes uh it does take offering and money to operate and where you're sitting somebody provides that for you so you know we hope that we can all uh join in and bear one another's burdens and uh I I know that people might not think that uh this was necessary but Paul devoted a whole chapter of the scripture about collecting Bounty for the needs and so we wanted to do that I felt obligated to do that I felt this would be a good time so I hope it was a blessing to you this morning uh brother Billy will lead us in a song and then brother matth will have a short sermon for us this morning so that we can definitely Fellowship H around the word and that that keeps that is our priority and as you know it's never been our uh Habit to discuss money or beg for money so uh just however God leads you uh Lord richly bless you so this is your church it's your body you own it uh it belongs to you so uh now you know what's going on so God bless you brother Billy man why don't we stand this morning I was AED I remember who I was I was lost I was blind I was running out of time oh s separated the gra was far to From The Far Side of the castle you H me in your side oh and you made a way across the Great Divine Left Behind Heaven's Ro to build it here inside oh and there at the cross you PID the dead I oh broke my chains free my soul for the first time I had oh thank you Jesus for the BL of blood oh and Hallelujah let's just sing it as we PR Matthew this morning oh and thank you Jesus you have my life oh brought me from Darkness to Glorious oh and you took my place laid inside my Tom oh you were for 3 days hallelujah oh and now death has no ST and life has no so I have been transed by the blood of the Lamb oh thank you Jesus for the blood of thank you [Music] Jesus you thank you Jesus my me from the darkness into [Music] glor amen praise the Lord how many are happy to be here enjoy the reports but I trust that with all of that um we we still want to give the word preeminence so I know that we've already been about an hour and 30 minutes if you need to step out and and use the restroom and once again uh there's no obligation uh you're free to come and go as you please uh one thing I do know I I just encouraged uh as our brother prayed to open the service we just want the Lord to have his way and may we just give out of the way and um let God let God minister to Hearts as I pondered back there as time was ticking and you know that people will be tired and uh we've already been here many churches would have been dismissed 45 minutes ago um but yet we don't want to be carnal we we want to be spiritual people and I I was thinking back there I I just thought you know brother brandham said that you know if we read a scripture we'd be blessed and brother Billy one time said that somebody's going to have to to manifest that and I was back there thinking this is the night this is the time this is the hour I can just go read a scripture praise God for the reports um but then the Lord started to deal with my heart and I thought well somebody come here to hear from god let's go before him Lord we just want you to come Lord I in my flesh I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place the the people are have been here for a Time many get here 30 45 minutes early they've already been here over 2 hours Lord I just want you to have your way and I don't want to be limited by it something that would come into my mind Lord but we want to get out of the way that you could just have the preeminence Lord Lord there's a lot of things that we give our time to we'll watch a two three hour movie or go to a ball game for two or three hours we'll go to a theme park and spend all day there sometimes when it comes to the things of God it's hard for us to stick around for a couple hours Lord we want you to have the preeminence may we just wash your feet this morning and give you the attention that you deserve we just commit ourselves to you now in the name of the Lord Jes Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord let's just turn in our Bibles to John chapter [Music] 12 amen praise the lord well it's 11:40 I thought my my my prayer should have been our prayer of dismissal I'm going to try to move uh quickly by the help of God um so if I if I catch a certain Pace um I pray God would just help us uh just to move and be a blessing amen John chapter 1234 John chapter 12 verse 34 it saysthe people answered him we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man now look at the reply that Jesus would give to him it would almost seem uh really a profound answer he says then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth while you have the light believe in the light that you may be Children of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and did not hide himself from them that notice he said that ye may be Children of the light amen you may be seated and if you'll also turn in your Bibles to First John 1:7 1 John 1 and 7 familiar scripture 1 John 1:7 say but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin and brother Brandon would say in God's only provided place of worship and may maybe just before I hit that let me just say this as I would was just listening to uh something that's been on my heart as brother Brandon preached a sermon when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place and he said and God so loved you that when his love was projected Sovereign Grace taken its place and sent a savior to redeem you back to himself and and by the help of God as we move through there uh certainly on a service where we're limited to time I I don't know if we would ever get there but I I just am trying to move to a place that now that that uh Divine love has been projected to us we are now become part of that Divine love and we want to project that Divine love to other people into our situations and into our life that Sovereign Grace would take its place brother brandham says this in God's only provided place of worship he said a man told me long ago said I Don't Preach a Clos line religion I said then you're not preaching the gospel all right so it matters it matters how you dress these things matter he says then you're not preaching the gospel God laid it out there he said what to do you either you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing what uh Little Things a woman uh let her hair grow that's why it's just something she can do and won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us great things how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common things because you see your motive and your objective is wrong it's your love to God lord I don't care what you want me to do I'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said to do it it's his choosing that's the place I have chosen that's where you you worship with your sacrifice now notice the prophet of God says he says how can I teach the great things when you won't do the simple common things I I just by the help of God want to preach this morning to you now I know my ABCs all right you hear what they're talking about in Sunday school they're teaching our kids the ABCs I would hope we've come to a place as a mature bride of Jesus Christ we are in a position where we know our ABCs and I want to say it's not just enough to know the ABCs but we're able to apply them that we can get to a place where we can now be taught the spiritual things look strong meat belongs to those that are spiritual but we're unskillful Paul would talk about us like do you know when you should be teachers you should we should be able to be teachers but yet we got to come back uh to the milk of the word because we're not even able to handle the ABCs now our text says if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from from all sin you know brother Brandon would go through this sermon he would start to talk about how there's only one provided place of worship and he says if there's only one provided place of worship then we better be real careful and make sure we get there if there's only one provided place of worship let's be sure that we find that one place this morning he said oh your worship can be sincere Jesus would say uhhh in vain do they worship me you ought to be careful there's one provided place of worship it says in vain do they worship me teaching for the doctrines of men if we're not careful we put that out somewhere but we need to take heed to ourselves Lord I don't want to worship you in vain just like Cain and Abel they both receiv received the Commandment of worship they both brought an off offering they both brought a sacrifice but God respected Abel's sacrifice and he rejected canes the prophet of God would say it like this in this sermon he would say but Abel by faith which is revelation the word of God revealed made plain showed out and Vindicated oh I want to say when it's revealed like that to you there's no more guesswork how many has ever taken a multiple choice test I used to love those because at least I had a 25% to get it right and you know you color it and you might not color it in so dark because you don't know if the answer but when you're sure man you really put that number two pencil to work I know I'm not erasing this one you go back and look at my test I fill it in like and then I read another another question further down like oh no that means this one back here you know I'm like I think this one's given the answer to that you look at my test this answer was erased and filled back in like you you you look at it but I want to tell you when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals it to you there's no more guesswork you're not wondering well I wonder if it's this I wonder if it's that when the question arises and say I know by Revelation what God desires Abel wasn't sitting there wondering well I see C's but you wonder Abel might have felt a little intimidated he coming up with that little lamb and here's this little dirty stinking lamb and he's walking up there to the gate back to the Garden of Eden and that's being guarded by a cherin with flaming angels and Cain has this big beautiful sacrifice and all a sudden that re start telling that's something that God wants and maybe he walking up there and seeing the flowers and all of the fruits and everything piled up in a big display you kind of feel like that when you go to some anniversaries and some parties and everything and then it comes your turn to throw in you like my goodness I can't I can't match up to that well just do what you can do well we're not trying to measure up with everybody else just be yourself just do what you can get you can do out of the love of your heart I want to say if it's out of the love of your heart it's enough if it's by Revelation I want to say it's enough and I say that Revelation was there in Abel's heart as he was coming up it didn't look like much oh it didn't look like much but it was what was going to please the Lord and when it showed out to you and it's Vindicated I want to tell you there ain't no more guesswork I want to tell you this message is Vindicated this message is Vindicated by a Vindicated prophet traveled around the world seven times Pillar of Fire showing up time and time again I want to say when it's revealed like that to you when it's Vindicated that you know that you know that you know there is no more guesswork I'm not wondering how I'm going to get a body change I'm not wondering how I'm going to go in a Rapture I'm not wondering if I'm going to make it I'm not wondering if my name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life I know because it's been shown to me it's been Vindicated oh oh Hallelujah when it's revealed to you like that come on when it's revealed to you like that when you know what you're talking about reminds me of Elijah came time for a showdown what did Elijah say he said all right you go ahead and call on your Gods you go to your church you go to your religion whatever your theology is whatever it is go ahead and call on your Gods I said but why don't we let the god that answers by fire be God you know everybody said that sounds pretty good to me we'll accept that will you accept that will you let the God be God that answers by fire hey I know what I'm talking about I can look into the story and when I read that story and Elijah say let the god that answers by fire be God I can stand right here and say I know exactly what Elijah's talking about what do you mean you know what Elijah's talking about well I can tell you there was a time when I was in sin and I was so uh under Satan's foot I was born with a first nature whenever I would try to do right he would just rub my face when I couldn't break free I couldn't get delivered but you know one day I said Lord whatever that is it's bigger than me I imagine if Elijah was looking over the banner Street he said hey guys come here did you hear that he's calling on the name of the Lord you know who that is that's the one that answers by Fire come on and that fire came and changed me it was so to me it was Vindicated I ain't guessing and wondering I know that I was born again I know what I used to be and I know when the grace of God came and changed my life I was born again my old nature passed away all things became new I am a new creature in Jesus Christ Vindicated prophet of God would say this in paragraph 227 he says but by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is a family the family of God it is hot up here if we can get some air condition or something he says but by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body and that that body is a family the family of God and that's the house of go follow him now uh we could uh break this down but we're moving quickly he says but by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is a family the family of God and that's the house of God and the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ you know you are Miss Jesus Christ the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into and are safe I want to tell you if you're not in it get into it now while you have the light believe in the light that you may be Children of the light believe it while you have it look Church we're on borrow time you are not guaranteed tomorrow it's later than you think if the prophet was telling us back there in 60 and 61 it's later than you where are we now we are on borrowed time church I say get in get in while you can while you have the light why don't you believe it why don't you come to the message of the hour why don't you put put all your faith and hope and trust in it maybe it hasn't been revealed to you like that you say brother Matthew what you're preaching doesn't have any effect on me I just don't get anything out of it well I don't I don't care what you think I want to tell you this message has power this message has life this message has been V Vindicated this message brings the Deliverance this message brings healing this message brings salvations this message gives you your family this message will make your marriage work this message will bring your kids in this message will do whatever it promises laying in the word it will bring it into a manifestation I say let's get past the veil let's get into spiritual Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where we can see this word coming alive living amongst us well what are you waiting for church you waiting for lightning and strike you waiting for the pillar of fire to to to to write something out on the wall what are you waiting for you waiting for some Calamity you waiting for some something to happen in your life where you finally get desperate it'll happen if that's what it takes I challenge you take God at his word this message is a rock in a weary land it's a Shelter From The Storm it'll pick you up when you're down it'll encourage you when you're discouraged when you feel like nobody loves you it'll love you when you feel like nobody knows uh what you're going through it knows what you're going through I want to tell you this message is the love of God projected to the believer and if you'll just take it and receive it Sovereign Grace will take over your life Sovereign Grace will take over your family Sovereign Grace will take over your work Sovereign Grace will take over everything that you got to go through I say fall in love with it I'm not talking about being religious just sympathizing with it well I know it's right you know I I I know that I know that this is a bottle of water I know it'll quit my thirst but sympathizing with it itn't going to do me any good I got to take it and I got to drink it you know that's pretty good oh my that satisfies my thirst you get thirsty up here I need more of that Bo that that's that's hitting the spot just one sermon no it's spiritual food in due season no matter what you're going through it's untapped resources you ever seen a kid eating ABC soup let me get a show of hands anybody ever seen a kid eating ABC soup I think Campbell makes ABC soup you watch a kid you know as they get a little bit older especially when they start KN what them letters mean or maybe they don't they play with that stuff they take it out say mommy look it says dog it says cat you know they're playing with their food but you know it'll never do that kid any good until he eats it I want to tell you this message will never do you any good I think it's time to quit playing with it quit trying to pull this quote with that quote and try to make the message say something so you can understand it I them time it's too late to be playing church it's too late to be playing games I'll hear what this preacher said and that preacher said now I really understand what the son of man is you will never understand what the son of man is the only thing that you'll ever understand is that faith is a revelation and when it's revealed to you like that there is no guesswork I know where I'm standing I know what I'm talking just give me the book I don't want to play church just give me the message if the preacher is saying what the prophet said I say Amen give me the book let me eat it thou must prophesy again quit playing with your food church I say quit playing Church well shake off the heavy bands this morning we're on limited time we might as well have church eat it thou must prophesy again but how how how can we teach spiritual things when you don't even do the common things other man said how can I teach them algebra when they won't even believe their ABCs first come on we're going somewhere Church these things ought to be common I don't want to go through all of it well you can look around and know the people who ain't got their ABCs down yet remember he said if you ain't preaching a clothline religion you ain't preaching the gospel and if I want to say if you ain't living a clothline religion you ain't living the gospel this word was made to be preached but it was made to be lived this word doesn't do any good to preach it with nobody living it there got to be somewhere somebody say you know what if that's the word of God I'm going to believe it I'm going to live it like I said I don't want to get on all these things but you know you know you're trying to just hug so close to the line you're trying to to just get by so close just to blend in So Close better watch out you just playing with your soup you're just playing with this thing well I can make the message I can make this to that so and so does this or that you know I can get by with it no you can't get by there's only one provided place of worship brother brandom said in this message he says now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything set in order if there's a shorten in that wire that light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you take one of God's word or one of his places in your heart and have selfish objectives that'll ground the power of God right there look your attitude your motives and your objectives can limit the power of God moving in a situation you wonder why maybe things aren't happening in your marriage you wonder why they're not happening in your home you wonder why they ain't happen in the church maybe it's because your objectives and motives ain't right maybe ain't pulling on the word being preached because you're a little selfish maybe you got something in your heart that you're hiding maybe there's something you want to see materialize in the church and it hasn't happened just yet so you're sitting on the preacher you're sitting on the sound you're sitting on the the the song leader you're just sitting on people you ain't going to the youth services you ain't going to this and that because you just don't see that things are adding up the way you wanted I tell you get rid of your selfish motives get love in your heart and start projecting the love of God your attitude and your motives can limit the power of God you say what are you talking about brother Matthew how can you limit the power of God well I tell you a story one time that there was once a woman who had a blood issue but you know who else was standing there jarus was standing there and he watched a miracle take place he watched a woman who had a a blood issue for several years be healed I like that story we could go into it but we don't have the time for it and all of a sudden jarus oh you can imagine his heart was welling up with inside of him he said praise the Lord this is the Messiah and then one of his his servants come up to and said trouble not the master it's too late it's hopeless you done messed up your marriage you done messed up your family you done messed up your job you done messed up in the church you done made the mistake you'll never be restored there ain't no way back for you you're never going to make it you sold away your virtue there's no way a brother will ever love you because you made this mistake now you're battling suicide thoughts you're battling if you ever belong in the place of God all these things oh the devil trying to discourage you but then the son of man said fear not not fear not only believe now Jesus was on the scene he's with jarus fear not only believe he comes back comes into the house he sees her laying there and he says Don't Fear she is not dead but she sleepeth they were all mourning they were all crying I don't know why that comes to me now but there's a lot of things we mourn and cry over think the days of Miracles have passed oh if brother Brandon would just just have been here maybe if brother so- and so was here he could really break down the Seven Seals oh if that brother if this brother if that if that oh you're you're you're mourning you're complaining then somebody says no it ain't what you think it is you're all flustered you're all upset you're all crying you're all worried about this situation because there's no hope and nothing can change it but then the son of man says she is not dead but she sleeps and all of a sudden they started to laugh him to scorn you know what he did he said all right all you unbelievers get out of here that's right brother Bron said he put all the people out that weren't Believers he said Peter James and John come on we got work to do give me some Faith give me some hope give me some love in the situation we we got a a young one that's laying here dead we got young ones sitting in our congregation that are dead but I say come on faith come on Hope come on love we got work to do fear not only believe they ain't dead they're just sleeping they're just the sleeping bride but there's a voice of the son of man that's going to wake them up out of their Slumber what are you talking about preacher I know what I'm talking I was one of them I was dead in sin and trespasses but then I Heard a Voice Like an Eagle screaming son you don't belong down there in that chicken yard come up higher come up higher how do I get there Lord just start flapping your wings just start praising God just start doing something Hallelujah just slap those wings get a little faith get a little hope get a little love let's get all the leav out there's only one provided place of worship to think that you're here oh the grace of God is the blood applied does it testify of the Lamb on the inside of the house cuz that's the provided place when you identify with the lamb you are the house of God he goes further to say you're the family of God you are the house of God and the house of God is the name of God no wonder you can speak to the mountain cuz it ain't you it's speaking it's the lamb speaking it's deity speaking it's the mighty conqueror speaking Hallelujah he said she is not dead but sleepeth get all them unbelievers out come on well maybe you feel that way let's start believing Church your attitude matters I said your attitude matters prophet of God would talk about uh uh uh Martha and Mary he said when he came to them he said look at their attitude he came there he said Lord if you would have been here our brother would not have died he said look at her attitude he said he could have told her he could have said to her Mary could have said why didn't you come when I called you love us we're friends brother brandom said she had a right to do that we grew up together when your parents died you come and live with us we grew up Lazarus your best friends we've been buddies and I called for you you've healed this person you've raised this person for I've been in need my wife's been sick for this many years this has been going on I called for you and didn't come she never approached him like that the prophet of God said she had a right to but he says when you become a lamb you surrender your rights the reason you don't come to church on Sunday night you haven't surrendered your rights the reason you don't give the word of God preeminence you haven't surrendered your rights because you still have a right to do what you want to do but I want to tell you when God got a hold of my life and I got baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost I lost all of my rights because I was purchased by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I ain't got no more rights sure I got to Die daily that first nature tries to pop its head off I got tell him I'm dead to you I want the word deal with your heart now I know my ABCs well do you quit sympathizing with it quit playing with your food prophet of God she had a right why did you come we left everything and you didn't even call when I called brother R said it like this she had that right but she forfeited that right to recognize the word of God manifested right before her you want to see the word of God manifested right before you surrender your rights you want to see the power of God in your life surrender your rights you want to see God move on the things that you've been praying for surrender your rights Lord if you had have been here my brother would not have been de the prophet of God would go on and say you see the reason why is because death and life can't stay in the same channel oh how let me just get in the channel of life let me just get into a holy spirit atmosphere let me just get in the right channel I don't care how bad things look I don't care how everything is going wrong oh Lord let me just step into the channel of Life there when all the Death and All the waves and everything's crashing around I know that I'm safe from all harm the prophet of God would say like this he said you're sealed in there you're beneath the blood you don't go out anymore and then what are you do God's son is God's family sealed in the Holy Spirit the devil couldn't get to you if he had to oh do you know what it's like to be under the blood of the Lamb of God sealed with the Holy Ghost the devil can't even get to you if he had to I feel good I feel like preaching I feel like I ain't bound to time cuz I know what I'm talking about if you get beneath the blood and the life that was in the blood comes back on the BL well you like it why don't you say Amen to it come on Church what's the matter with us this is worth living for this is worth shouting for we're so Bound by Traditions Bound by way ways a man's thinking that's all right it won't hurt you I live for it I'm a fanatic like that if I can get front row seats to a ball game I'm GNA get them I'm a fanatic Prophet said God said just don't jump any higher than you're living I feel pretty good because I want the front row seat if the if the word's going for get me into church look I've had a blowout I had my my spare blowout I couldn't make a church I showed up to church there was 10 minutes of preaching left had to drive an hour and a half to get there but you know what the attitude of faith says this last 10 minutes is for me y'all get ready y'all might be tired you might have been here two hours 3 hours but I showed up and I won my 10 minutes Lord if I get 10 minutes I'll take it if I get five minutes I'll take it if I get an hour I'll take it Lord you did everything for me let me give you Lord all of my heart oh it's worth living for a church if you would have been here your brother's not dead he'll rise again oh Lord I know I know he'll rise in the resurrection paragraph 119 he said I am am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this see there was one more little Cog she hadn't come in line with I got to read it again he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this there was one more little clog that hadn't come in line with yes Lord watch what's about to happen yes Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God Peter who do men say I am some say this some say who do you say the message of the hour is some say he was a good Prophet some say he was Malachi 4:5 some say was but who do you say the message of the hour is I say it is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ that come down and veiled himself in a prophetic son of man Ministry to reveal himself to the bride and reveal the son of predition that you wouldn't sleep any longer that you would hear the voice of the Resurrection I will have a bride come forth come out of the chicken yard come out of lady oia don't be a partaker of her plagues come up higher Church there's been a m entrance ministered to you you ain't got to stay down there anymore Hallelujah I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God now everything was set just right you've been praying you've been believing you've had a promise you've been laying there now everything's just adding up and he says Where have you laid him everybody thought oh he's just going down to pay his respects no nope no he's going to do more than that I didn't come to church just to pay my respects I don't come to church to pay my respects to a tomb some 2,000 years ago I don't come for that to pay my respects no I come because the resurrection I come because the one back there said Lazarus why did he say Lazarus because if he said come forth every grave on the Earth would have opened up and everybody that was ever dead would have come forth but he called Lazarus by name don't you realize when the seventh seal was open it was calling your name it was telling you come out of the denominational tombstones come out of the Grave come out of Lady OA come out of your church ID idolatry oh come to the Fountain of Living Water if that don't excite you I don't know what will hey I know it's late I know you're tired but I love it I live for it this is going to be a short sermon in God's time or real time I don't know where have you laid him come on where's the voice now where is the voice now you are the final voice under your messenger thou must prophesy again why cry speak speak to the mountain brother R said I used to never touch that because I couldn't Wonder but he said when it says you speak to the now it puts you back in the word every time brother Brandon went through the five manifestations of the third pool he would say and he said but it was him saying it so you see where has to come is that Unity that Oneness where it's not just you speaking it's him speaking it's not just him speaking it's you speak y'all become one you is that the Lord or that brother brandom oh then now now you're getting somewhere now you're recognizing the Oneness and that same Oneness that that was manifested in the prophet he wants to manifest in you now we're talking about Oneness now we're talking about Unity now we're talking about deity speaking but how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common things he said if you can't do the common things how are you going to do the spiritual things now Paul would say in Ephesians 1 n having made known the mystery un having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself 1 John 5:14 and this is the confidence that we have sorry interpreters it'll be recorded and this is the confidence that we have in him that but if it's recorded don't listen to me listen to a prophet and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us now the prophet of God said there is only one way to know his will I'll back up Lord forgive me I don't mean to rush the Lord Ephesians 1:9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he had purposed in himself so he's made known to us his mystery oh if anyone if anyone knows the mystery of his will that's I don't know about you but I ain't wondering I know I know what he come to do I know what he wants to do with me I know what he wants to manifest in my life I know what he wants to manifest in my marriage I know what he wants my kids to be I know what he wants this church to be I know what he wants you to be I ain't wondering because his will has been revealed and 1 John 5:14 says and this is the confidence right if your heart don't condemn you you have this confidence we're going to get somewhere we'll we'll try to we'll try to turn an hour into a few minutes he says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us let it sink in let it marinate you know how you make good chicken fajitas good steak fajitas let them marinate let that marinate for a second this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to what your wants your desires according to his will he heareth us and it goes on to say and if he heareth us we know we have the petitions that we asked the prophet of God would say this in the church age book he he would say there's only way to know his will and that is by the word of God he says if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word I want to go a little further and say if it ain't in the word I don't want it all right so I I I just want you to catch that wrap that up because brother randam says this in God's provided way preach this in April 25 he says the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the selfsame persons this is in the word God will be so manifested in his bride his church okay they will be both the same they are one now you see where we're at am you you can have that I said you can have that it says the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the selfsame persons God will be so manifested in you that you will be the same you will be one I see it in the word that means you can ask for it God so manifested in you the Perfection of the son of man Ministry in the bride God being so manifested in you oh let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus he says don't hold to them traditions and those Creeds they were all right for their day but the flower has come has Bloom to a blossom now it's seed time that's right Jesus Promised these things now when we see God make his promise live before us and see that it's in us and his spirit is living in us that is the only way of worship ship H Hallelujah the father seeks such to worship him oh Christianity is plagued with with with idolatry and traditions but there is a people on the Earth that aren't just worshiping him in spirit we are worshiping him in spirit and in truth and the father seeketh such to worship him because he hath made the mystery of his will revealed to you that you can give him the worship he deserves Hallelujah that is the only way of worship only place of worship the only true way you can worship for there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus we're talking about knowing your ABCs tell that devil to take a hike it's finished it's over you never did it in the first place how are you ever going to speak a mountain when you can't get over your own sin how are you ever going to stand in the gap for somebody else when you can't get over your own sin how are you ever going to project the love of God and watch Sovereign Grace come over when you can't even accept the revelation of justification but when you catch the Revelation under justification not under Luther that was a partial light but when the son of man came he said I'll tell you what full justification is it's the fullness of redemption I'm taking you back to the Garden of Eden back to the logos where you never even did it you were you were your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life you never did it in the first place that's the confidence that's the where were you job when the sons of God shouted for that's the confidence when that devil tries to tell you you lost your virtue my virtue is in Jesus Christ I have no virtue the only virtue I got is in the blood of the Lamb Rahab didn't have any virtue but what she had was a token Hallelujah and all she had to do was show the token and her whole civilization crumbled around her and she was saved Hallelujah talk about a worship you think Rahab worshiped you wonder why maram worshiped you wonder why I worship because that Taskmaster that whooped me and beat me and told me you're going to smoke when I tell you to smoke you're going to drink when I tell you to drink you're going to steal when I tell you to steal but one day I called on the name of the Lord and the god that answers by fire consumed the sacrifice because I came in sincerity and in truth and really wanted to be delivered and he changed me I'm talking about a God that answers by fire Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Promised these things now when we see God make his promise live before us and see that it's in us and his Spirit living in us that is the only way of worship only place of worship the only true way to worship for there is no condemnation of them which are in Christ Jesus God made the promise Jesus said the things that I do you'll do also and what he would do in these last days how it come through this age neither light nor day would it be the like of Darkness time but said in the evening time it shall be light he would go on and talk about how just as it's traveled just like the sun the same Sun that Rose in the East sets in the west he said it traveled just like three civilizations over three bodies of water just like the new birth justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he goes on to say that and he's talking about because here he is in Los Angeles he's preaching a a breakfast in Los Angeles God's only provided way of worship he says here we are again in Los Angeles the same Hallelujah the same son that went in the ground the same son that Rose in the East has traveled all the way back West and here it is again in 1964 standing in Los Angeles California telling those ministers there's only one provided place of worship he say look at where we are the the world's heaping up everywhere darkness is all gathered up just as it traveled it's come over here and it's piled up all of its Darkness here in Hollywood he said look at the poison they're they're feeding into our little girls all the kissing and everything he said how how it is but he says this in paragraph 203 he says but the hour oh Lord help us he says but the hour has come that every Kingdom has to give way because there is a kingdom of God that's established in the human heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ it's in the word you can have it that same seed that went into the ground come on has resurrected and is right here in our midst in the fullness of its power look I'm going to preach what a prophet preached and I'm going to believe what a prophet believed I'm going to believe in the power of the Holy Ghost I'm going to believe in the sick being healed I'm going to believe in divine healing I'm going to Believe In Worship I'm going to believe in Victory I'm going to believe in what's been revealed to me through the mouth of Malachi 4:5 so don't get mad at me because I believe in the power of God don't get mad at us because we believe in shouting don't get mad at us because we believe in Victory don't get mad at us because we believe in the third pool don't get mad at us because we know that Elijah uh that brother brandom's Ministry was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 don't get mad at us cuz we've caught the Revelation that the mighty Angel has come down and Revelations 10 1 through 7 has been fulfilled I'm going to preach it and I'm going to believe it and guess what I'm going to get the benefits of it oh hallelujah look look why do you have an insurance policy just to pay the bill is that what that's why we're all mad about our insurance because you pay into it and you hardly ever get anything back but this is one Assurance policy that was already paid for and you can reap the full benefit well you need to fix your house fix your house you need to fix your marriage fix your marriage you need salvation Salvation is here healing is here Deliverance is here come on I can reap the benefits well the prophet of God would say it like this and why Christ speak I'm so glad that a man can be so completely serve god Till the devil don't know what to do with them I'm trying to show you things laying in the word that you can ask for now I know my abc it's in the word the prophet of God said it got to a place where Pharaoh got so sick of Moses speaking the word he got so sick he got so sick of him preaching he got so sick of his word being manifested he finally said Moses take you and the Believers and get out of here now I believe the bride of Christ is going to get such to a place where they're so in harmony with the message and so in harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ where the devil doesn't even know what to do with you he keeps trying to bombard you with this and nothing is working he's going back down to Hell I tried him with temptation I tried him with doubt I tried him with lust I tried him with this I even Afflicted his family I Afflicted his wife I Afflicted his daughters I Afflicted everybody but they're just like job why because inside of job was a revelation he was a seed of God and though the skin worms eat my flesh I will see my God though he slay me yet I'll serve him there's a revelation in you church I'm so glad I can get to that place where I'm so sold out lockstock and Barrel how you going to get there brother Matthew well this is what a prophet said and you must be ging again he said but the true word comes to a true prophet and he tells you the true word you follow that true word and you'll get a true experience of the word because the word has made flesh in you well that's power packed that's power packed you want to know how it's happened believe what the prophet said don't settle for anything less I ain't going to settle for anything less than what happened in the upper room look what Peter had I want it what Paul had I want it what brother Brer had I want it and you can have it because it's laying in the word the same word that was made flesh in the prophet if you keep following it you keep believing it look it was a sheep wave showing you what you're going to be you keep believing it then that word will become flesh in you come on that word will be made flesh in you he he didn't preach perfect Faith so that you would never get it he didn't preach possessing the Gate of the enemy so you would just try he didn't preach how can I overcome so you would try to figure it out but he was telling you what the potential of the seed was that God had placed in you before the foundation of the world that you can have perfect faith that you can possess the Gate of the enemy that you can overcome you can just read sermon titles and get a Revival just start reading the sermon titles and you get a Revival there's a man here that can turn on the light he preached that 12:29 in the morning you know what he preached in the evening Look Away to Jesus why can you look away to Jesus cuz there's a man here who turned on the light and all those denominational crck roaches had to scatter and The Awakening of the Bride came and he said there he is the son of man standing the same yesterday today look and live oh Hallelujah you mean he preached these things because he's wanting that word to be materialized in me oh hallelujah hallelujah he preached it so that you could live it it was the same God who said let there be light was the same God standing here saying if thou can't believe all things are possible why did he preach why Christ speak why did he preach it so you would quit crying uh oh we're talking about knowing our ABCs he preached why Christ speak so you'd quit crying and speak I a lot of us has quit crying but have we started speaking oh Hallelujah well we're going to have to come to a close we'll see how we can get here my is everybody feeling all right wow praise God we'll try to wrap this up in five minutes the prophet of God would say this he would take Daniel 11:32 where it says uh but the people that will know their God shall be strong and do exploits and brother Brandon would tie that with what we read in our text he would say it like this he'd say they that do wise Daniel said in these last days we'll do exploits for their gods see they'll walk in the light as he is in the light see he's tying those two things together because there is a people that know their God they will be strong they will do exploits why this is sea time this is Rapture time we know the mystery of his will we know who we are he's revealed not only who the son of man is but he's revealing to the bride of Christ who you are what your position is what you can do why cist speak to the mountain if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe this is the appointed time it's seed time it's Rapture time this is the season of the body change this is the season of the manifestation of the sons of God you say well what happens if you go by the way of the the grave I'm coming up I said I'm coming up you can't have the Rapture without me and if I go in the grave first guess what you ain't going to hinder me I'm coming up I might be the one that comes and knock on your door and say boo hey why you scaring me the change is on don't bother me how I get there I just want to be there I just want to play my part I like this he says we'll try to end maybe right around here he says that if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word maybe I'll say it like this don't go to Chick-fil-A and order a hamburger sir and don't go to Chick-fil-A on Sunday because they know their ABCs that one hurt you want to know why you don't go to Chick-fil-A and Order hamburger can anybody tell me it's not on the menu but if it's on the menu and you got the purchasing power you can say I'll take a 30 piece nugget with extra Chick-fil-A sauce and a large ice tea half and half and they'll tell you that will be so many dollars and cents and you'll whip out that plastic and gladly know that you got the purchasing power and if it says sorry sir it's been declined you can say I thought I had the purchasing power and it really sounded good and I know it was on the menu but friends I want to tell you if it's on the menu in God's word that price has already been paid you can write the check you don't have to worry about it bouncing you don't have to worry about being declined if you got the confidence to ask him and you know that he's faithful to hear you I say it's on the menu salvation is on the menu Hallelujah sanctification is on the menu the Holy Ghost is on the menu my prodal sons and daughters it's on the menu Lord give them back to me give me my daughter give me my wife's healing give me my wife's hearing it's on the menu because by his stripes I am already healed and I got the purchasing power the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ he's in the building to bring every promise into my manifestation Hallelujah why don't you praise the Lord this morning if the musicians would come hallelujah praise His wonderful name oh there's a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost prophet of God would say this on the wings of a snow white dove he's saying that's the way it is with a real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have even any sin at all imputed to him we're talking about love being projected you talk about Sovereign Grace and if you've experienced it oh when you start projecting that love into your life into other people's life David said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by a make belief but really the blood of the lamb God does not impute to anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it there's a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you want to know how the Lord sees you he's been trying to tell you through 12200 sermons through the mouth of Malachi 4:5 that if you would repent and accept his provided way of worship in the end time and be birthed under the message of Malachi 45 according to the revealed word you are Justified you never did it in the first place therefore you can have the confidence to speak to the mountain I say it's time we accept what the word says you are you are free you are delivered you are sinless you are sinless you never did it in the first place you can't have that perfect Faith look why he is here the Capstone is here my Bible tells me in 1 John 4:18 there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment well what are you scared about church there's a man here that can turn on the light no matter how dark no matter how hopeless no matter how sick he said I did not come to bring you fear he said but I came to bring you love courage and ability he said all of my promises are yours you speak the word and I'll back it up I'm talking about knowing your ABCs well come on John Ryan John Ryan had his ABCs down right he come back to the prayer line cuz he he didn't have his ABC right yeah you you heard a kids say it they'll say they're ABCs AB i j KZ no you don't know it let's start again John John Ryan thought he knew it but he came back through and he said I thought you said I was healed he said I thought you said you believed he said okay I got it he said you go testify okay see some of you believe but you haven't started testifying what are you waiting for are you scared is it not a revelation my scripture tells me Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but he was strong in faith giving Glory unto God knowing that he who made the promise is faithful to perform it that's way the why I act the way I act because I know the one that made the promise the same one that pulled me out of sin is the same one that's going to change my body the same one that saved me and Sanctified me and filled with all the El it's the same one that brings the healing if you walk in the light if you walk in the light we're going somewhere Church you say where are you going where you going Abraham I'm walking why you walking cuz I'm walking out of this condition into the promise of God you say you've been praying for healing I'm looking at you I see you walking what are you doing I'm walking what are you saying I'm saying thank God for my healing and when I'm fully healed I'm going to testify I I'm going to use this healed body to spread the gospel I'm going to take this healed body I'm going to serve the church and serve you got to have a reason to be healed these are ABCs if you walk in the light Prophet said Enoch just walked kept walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground and he just kept walking and he walked on into the glory without even dying let's just pray Lord Jesus it's been a little bit lengthy of a service Lord [Music] but just know your heart for the people as we want to come to a place that we've settled it once and for all we know our ABCs and your love has been projected to us Lord where Sovereign Grace is taken over lord if your Sovereign Grace is taken over in our [Music] lives Lord now we can start projecting that love to others Lord it was it was your Prophet who was going about your will to go pray for the sick when he Disturbed that bull but he was in a place to project love and grace took over lord it was when he bumped into that hornet nest he was just doing the chores at the [Music] house and he projected love and grace took over lord it seems like maybe there's disturbances in the church and in our relationships sometimes we feel like we're dealing with bulls and dealing with hornets and we can be so quick to judge and just cash judgment but Lord I see the humility and the surrender that your Prophet had where he projected love into a a situation in his life and Grace took over it Lord that speaks to me Lord I've benefited from your grace and your love and your blessing Lord I want to be so surrendered till you're so manifested in me that that Oneness is now in me that I can project that love into the situations in my life and that when I encounter somebody that's maybe fussing or having a hard time Lord that I could pray for him your scripture says that if we see somebody who sinned a sin not unto death that we can we can pray for them and they'll they'll receive life Lord and I believe believe that's the love you want us to have for one another if we see somebody that doesn't know their ABCs it's not to judge them but Lord if I could look out in their life and say I know the potential is in there and Lord I want to project my love for them Father that there'll be a Grace for them and Lord as we start to love one another we'll start to see this Sovereign Grace Just oh so flow overflowing our congregation with a love one for another and Sovereign Grace taking over that all these situations Lord it'll just be an expression of your great love in each one of us Lord I commit the people to you may you just bless them Lord they've they've labored and they've been here for a time we thank you for the reports and the things that were necessary of the church I pray that
