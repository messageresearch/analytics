[46:08] personally and

[53:21] with me to the first Peter
[53:27] and the first chapter
[53:31] it's hard to break into this opening uh
[53:34] chapter but we'll start at the seventh
[53:39] verse
[53:56] first Peter first chapter seventh verse
[54:00] that the trial of your faith being much
[54:04] more precious than of gold that perishes
[54:08] though it be tried with fire
[54:12] might be found unto praise and honor and
[54:16] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[54:20] whom having not seen
[54:23] ye love
[54:26] in whom
[54:27] though now you see him not yet believing
[54:31] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[54:36] full of Glory
[54:38] receiving the end of your faith
[54:41] even the salvation of your souls
[54:47] of which salvation the prophets have
[54:51] inquired and searched diligently
[54:55] who prophesied of the grace that should
[54:58] come unto you
[55:01] searching what or what manner of time
[55:05] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[55:08] did signify when it testified beforehand
[55:13] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[55:16] that should follow
[55:20] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[55:22] themselves but unto us
[55:25] they did Minister the things which are
[55:28] now reported unto you by them that have
[55:31] preached the gospel unto you with the
[55:34] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[55:37] things the Angels desired to look into
[55:41] may the Lord bless his word
[55:47] oh you may be seated that's what I think
[55:50] that's what you're waiting to hear
[55:56] you know I I heard a minister make a
[55:59] remark
[56:00] the other day and he said when
[56:03] God spoke to Moses in the burning bush
[56:06] and and God asked Moses who are you Lord
[56:09] and the Lord said
[56:13] I am
[56:15] and he made the comment and he said
[56:17] wherever God is moving at the time
[56:20] that's the I am he's the I am God so
[56:25] where
[56:27] where whatever
[56:30] dispensation or whatever way God is
[56:33] moving where
[56:34] where he's at now makes him the I am
[56:39] and so when when Jesus was on Earth and
[56:42] and uh
[56:44] and he and he told them he said before
[56:48] Abraham was I am
[56:51] so he's the I am God and
[56:55] you know many times I believe in our
[56:57] life we're
[56:59] always looking for tomorrow and we're
[57:03] always feeling like well I'm getting
[57:06] ready I'm preparing myself I'm kind of
[57:09] getting set up that tomorrow I'm going
[57:12] to perform tomorrow I'm going to do this
[57:16] and and we we live in this state that
[57:21] you know this isn't the real thing but
[57:24] tomorrow it's going to be the real thing
[57:26] but what we have now saints of God is
[57:30] today and we are living now in our Glory
[57:34] Days
[57:35] this is it this is the thing and and
[57:39] it's a very beautiful thing I I I
[57:41] thought of a portion if we're just going
[57:44] to try to go back where we were this
[57:46] morning and read a very small portion
[57:48] that I left out but it brought me
[57:52] to this scripture that
[57:58] it was the spirit of Christ in these
[58:02] prophets
[58:03] not another Spirit you know the the what
[58:07] a great and glorious Deliverance it was
[58:12] for God in our day to straighten out
[58:16] this mess of the trinity
[58:20] and I'm you know this this country of
[58:24] Bulgaria when you look on your map in
[58:27] the back I like that because I saw your
[58:29] world map and I thought if you position
[58:31] yourself perfectly in the middle of that
[58:34] mat and if you're about five eight I
[58:37] think I am it'll be perfectly at your
[58:40] eye level and in the center Bulgaria and
[58:42] I thought praise the lord they're going
[58:44] to remember Bulgaria and
[58:47] uh but that country
[58:50] had two men that wrote the Cyrillic
[58:55] alphabet
[58:57] because they didn't want that Roman
[59:00] Latin Doctrine in their country so they
[59:03] made another alphabet so they could
[59:06] teach the people in the Cyrillic to the
[59:10] gospel and they were going to combat
[59:13] that Roman trinitarian idea and and
[59:18] spread the gospel in another language
[59:20] and that's the language that all of
[59:22] Russia and all of Eastern Europe they
[59:25] all have that alphabet and they all have
[59:27] that Slavic language
[59:30] but
[59:32] you see here in verse 11 it says
[59:35] searching what or what manner of time
[59:39] the spirit of Christ
[59:42] that was in those Prophets
[59:46] that was that same spirit that that rock
[59:50] that followed the children of Israel
[59:52] that rock was Christ it's not a third
[59:56] person in a trinity it's not another
[59:59] person but it's that spirit of God that
[1:00:02] Holy Spirit that was in them
[1:00:06] and it was moving in them and they were
[1:00:10] writing of the things that were for us
[1:00:16] and how casual we are sometimes and how
[1:00:19] much we take for granted
[1:00:22] these things that are revealed in our
[1:00:24] day and so this salvation that we are
[1:00:29] receiving the end
[1:00:33] of our salvation
[1:00:36] we're rejoicing because our faith looks
[1:00:40] to the end of the road and we see this
[1:00:44] as a finished work we know
[1:00:47] that were foreordained
[1:00:51] to the adoption of sons we know that God
[1:00:55] brought us here to bring us to the
[1:00:58] fullness of our inheritance and our
[1:01:00] confidence is in him that he's going to
[1:01:03] do this work and so we we walk forward
[1:01:06] in this confidence that he's going to
[1:01:09] perform his word in us because this
[1:01:14] salvation that we're partakers of the
[1:01:17] Holy sages and prophets of old time they
[1:01:22] were searching diligently and the spirit
[1:01:26] of God was moving on them and they're
[1:01:28] saying what is this Lord what is this
[1:01:32] blessing and not even knowing the things
[1:01:36] that they were speaking they were
[1:01:37] speaking the things that we would
[1:01:40] fulfill
[1:01:44] what a glorious thing it is
[1:01:51] knowing that
[1:01:53] he knew that he would have someone
[1:01:57] that would stand the test in the end
[1:02:00] time he's always got somebody that's
[1:02:03] going to represent him on this Earth
[1:02:07] he's already going to have he's always
[1:02:09] going to have somebody
[1:02:12] who's going to represent him and I
[1:02:15] remember when the when uh in Revelations
[1:02:20] chapter 5 when no one was worthy to open
[1:02:24] the book
[1:02:25] and and and there was nobody in heaven
[1:02:28] and nobody in Earth and no one was
[1:02:33] worthy to look in the book and finally
[1:02:35] John
[1:02:36] he looked for the the Elder said don't
[1:02:39] don't fear John don't weep
[1:02:42] and and they said the lion of the tribe
[1:02:45] of Judah he is worthy to open the book
[1:02:49] and when he looked to see the lion he
[1:02:52] saw a lamb and that lamb had seven eyes
[1:02:56] which are seers which we can see that
[1:02:59] all the way from Zachariah all through
[1:03:02] the Old Testament the seven spirits of
[1:03:05] God
[1:03:07] which were seven manifestations of just
[1:03:11] the one great spirit God
[1:03:14] but also when he went and he looked at
[1:03:17] that lamb that lamb had seven horns
[1:03:21] and what did Brother Branham say those
[1:03:23] seven horns were
[1:03:26] his representation his power on Earth
[1:03:32] because he all through each age he had
[1:03:35] somebody to to uh
[1:03:40] uh a horn represents a power or a
[1:03:45] kingdom and he's got his kingdom on
[1:03:48] Earth through each of these ages he's
[1:03:50] got somebody that represents him
[1:03:53] and I and I've told it so many times and
[1:03:56] I it just sticks with me and I've I've
[1:03:59] said it a lot but I I like to talk about
[1:04:02] it but you know when I go some of these
[1:04:05] far-off places
[1:04:07] many of these people had to uh leave
[1:04:09] their homes and go to work and go to
[1:04:11] work overseas and then they they they
[1:04:14] don't want their homes taken over while
[1:04:17] they're gone and this is
[1:04:21] just really hard like in Bulgaria for
[1:04:24] the Gypsy people to look at a beautiful
[1:04:27] home not not occupied for a year or two
[1:04:31] well they would just go and move into it
[1:04:33] and and you know then we'll face it when
[1:04:37] the people come back well the the people
[1:04:40] know that so they have some grandma or
[1:04:43] somebody some relation and they say just
[1:04:46] live in that house
[1:04:48] and represent our claim to the house now
[1:04:51] grandma might not be you know power have
[1:04:54] much power
[1:04:56] but she's got the place and the
[1:04:58] authorities she represents the ownership
[1:05:02] of that house and God's gonna have
[1:05:04] somebody on the earth that represents
[1:05:08] his claim to this earth until he comes
[1:05:11] again
[1:05:14] of course brother Graham said the
[1:05:15] policeman you know he don't have much
[1:05:17] power but he's got Authority
[1:05:22] and so here
[1:05:23] these Prophets
[1:05:26] they're searching diligently for this
[1:05:30] salvation
[1:05:32] that we have
[1:05:34] and we live our life and we conduct
[1:05:37] ourselves receiving the end of that
[1:05:49] now
[1:05:52] speaking of these Prophets
[1:05:56] testifying beforehand the sufferings of
[1:05:58] Christ and the glory that should follow
[1:06:00] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[1:06:03] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[1:06:07] the things
[1:06:09] it's not a kind of a phenomena that here
[1:06:13] they are ministering
[1:06:17] and they're speaking the things hundreds
[1:06:21] of years before by the spirit of Christ
[1:06:24] and they're ministering to us
[1:06:28] my this gospel is Supernatural there's
[1:06:31] more Supernatural going on in our lives
[1:06:34] than I believe that we realize and the
[1:06:37] word of God is having an effect in
[1:06:39] empowering us and and feeding us and
[1:06:43] securing us and comforting us and
[1:06:45] energizing us and inspiring us and and
[1:06:49] we just read our Bible and we say glory
[1:06:52] to God
[1:06:53] and here it is one of the prophets and
[1:06:56] sages who is diligently seeking what is
[1:06:59] this Lord what is the spirit on me he's
[1:07:02] speaking things that he doesn't really
[1:07:04] understand a virgin shall conceive maybe
[1:07:06] he didn't even know what he was saying
[1:07:09] I heard brother Branham uh uh speaking
[1:07:12] about brother Neville and he said he
[1:07:15] said it it was after a service and the
[1:07:17] spirit of the Lord was moving and he
[1:07:18] said this is what Joel prophesied of he
[1:07:21] said this Holy Spirit moving amongst us
[1:07:24] in the service this is it
[1:07:28] and he said that God could take the man
[1:07:31] and have him stand up and he doesn't
[1:07:33] even know what he's going to speak and
[1:07:35] put words in his mouth and God now this
[1:07:39] is Brother Brown I'm talking about it's
[1:07:40] not my commentary but Brother Brad him
[1:07:42] on tape saying God using Brother Neville
[1:07:46] to speak to me
[1:07:48] now I was just amazed at the fact that
[1:07:52] you know God could speak to brother
[1:07:55] Branham live to ear he didn't have to
[1:07:58] use brother Neville but he said he
[1:07:59] brother Neville stood up and didn't even
[1:08:01] know the words that were going to come
[1:08:03] out of his mouth and the spirit of the
[1:08:06] Lord told Brother Brown and said don't
[1:08:08] worry about your itinerary I'll take
[1:08:10] care of that
[1:08:15] and I I'm just going to fellowship with
[1:08:17] you tonight Saints
[1:08:21] I love these
[1:08:22] tapes because I feel like God's talking
[1:08:25] to me and there was just a rebuke in
[1:08:28] there and said you know what's wrong
[1:08:29] with you thinking that brother Neville
[1:08:32] is some kind of Junior shame on you
[1:08:35] you know shame on me what what what kind
[1:08:38] of thought am I uh uh uh thinking when I
[1:08:42] heard brother Branham said that that a
[1:08:44] man could be so yielded to a holy spirit
[1:08:47] that he'd just stand up and not even
[1:08:49] know what's going to speak I thought I
[1:08:51] would like a little bit of that I'd like
[1:08:53] to be so moved on by God that I didn't
[1:08:56] know what was going to come out of these
[1:08:58] lips but I like that black man said he
[1:09:00] said he said well what if what if that
[1:09:03] Bible said you know jump through that
[1:09:04] brick wall and he said I go to jump and
[1:09:07] he said there'd be a hole there when I
[1:09:08] get there I want to live my life like
[1:09:11] that there's going to be a hole there
[1:09:13] when I get there
[1:09:17] no all those little cousins came around
[1:09:19] that gal that believed the word of God
[1:09:22] and she's up at night sowing a little
[1:09:24] gown and all the other cousins you know
[1:09:26] they they they went to the parties and
[1:09:29] everything else but she didn't she
[1:09:30] didn't go to no party she's working in
[1:09:32] the kitchen but when the when the son of
[1:09:35] the owner came and saw her said I see in
[1:09:39] you a character that's the kind of woman
[1:09:41] I want and she just staying up at night
[1:09:44] so and and saving her pennies and she's
[1:09:48] getting her wedding down ready
[1:09:51] and they all laughed at her and said my
[1:09:54] goodness look at that you out here in
[1:09:55] this hot sun and you look ridiculous
[1:10:00] yeah
[1:10:01] you look ridiculous what has gotten into
[1:10:04] you and you're out here in the middle of
[1:10:06] this desert out on this Ranch in a
[1:10:08] wedding gown
[1:10:09] you got to be kidding me
[1:10:12] she said that's all right I got 30
[1:10:15] minutes I'll just out here sweat I'm
[1:10:17] just holding my bouquet I'm just
[1:10:20] sweating and just trying to be as fresh
[1:10:22] as I can for my bridegroom when he comes
[1:10:25] and pretty soon the sound of those wagon
[1:10:28] wheels in the sand going through those
[1:10:30] Wagon Wheels she just jumped out all
[1:10:32] those critics and she went home with her
[1:10:35] bridegroom it's okay it's a personal
[1:10:37] fair this is not a public show and I
[1:10:40] know when God's talking to me and he's
[1:10:43] talking to me out of this word he's
[1:10:45] talking to me through brothers and
[1:10:46] sisters
[1:10:48] man I I I you know sometimes I'm in
[1:10:50] fellowship and I hear a little word and
[1:10:52] I'm you know with brothers and sisters
[1:10:54] and somebody's testifying
[1:10:56] and I'm thinking um
[1:11:00] oh that hurt let's we don't have to tell
[1:11:03] nobody about that but
[1:11:06] but that hurts
[1:11:07] you know I want to do better or
[1:11:09] something you know you just somebody
[1:11:10] testifies a certain way I I went into a
[1:11:13] place and when so many stories up and
[1:11:17] this sister had you know things
[1:11:19] conditions were so bad in that place and
[1:11:22] she said well come in she said well I
[1:11:24] want you to see our new apartment and
[1:11:26] I'm thinking my goodness this building
[1:11:28] is of wreck
[1:11:30] and she's five stories up and she's got
[1:11:33] this family of kids and I'm just
[1:11:35] thinking I'm not even feeling
[1:11:36] comfortable my own self I'm just and
[1:11:39] then she comes in and she says you know
[1:11:41] the Lord just knew I like the morning
[1:11:43] son and she gave us this apartment and
[1:11:46] he said look at the morning sun and it
[1:11:49] wasn't the morning sun that was getting
[1:11:51] me it was what was shining in her
[1:11:53] countenance and she's so thankful and so
[1:11:56] sweet and she looks over the balcony and
[1:11:59] we looked down at that play yard five
[1:12:01] stories down with these Steel toys that
[1:12:04] looked like a death traps to me you know
[1:12:06] this this park and she says I can look
[1:12:10] down and see the kids playing in the in
[1:12:12] the park there said isn't this wonderful
[1:12:15] well I'm going on that yeah it's
[1:12:17] wonderful sister
[1:12:19] but you know
[1:12:21] God
[1:12:24] speaking
[1:12:25] and here it is these
[1:12:28] men are moved of God to speak words
[1:12:34] to us
[1:12:36] that God knew that that would be our
[1:12:40] food
[1:12:42] and it was his provision and he stored
[1:12:45] up for this this food for us and how
[1:12:48] Supernatural this Manna is that it never
[1:12:52] gets old you listen to a tape again and
[1:12:55] you think Lord I never heard that
[1:12:58] and it's and it's moving it's kind of
[1:13:00] like that radium remember those women
[1:13:03] that they were making those watches and
[1:13:05] one of them touched that radium and then
[1:13:07] they dug up the school a little while
[1:13:09] later and that radium's still moving
[1:13:12] still moving still moving and you know I
[1:13:15] what frustrates me
[1:13:17] you know we're not um you didn't have a
[1:13:20] visiting minister to complain up here
[1:13:22] but I do have a complaint brother
[1:13:25] McGarry
[1:13:26] and that's I get a hold of these things
[1:13:28] and I get a little bit of that radium
[1:13:30] and that thing's moving and then I get a
[1:13:33] hold of something else and that starts
[1:13:35] moving and I got all this word of God
[1:13:38] moving and me and the things that the
[1:13:40] prophet said and that's connected to
[1:13:43] that and that's connected to that you
[1:13:45] know all the roads are connected and
[1:13:47] everything's connected and I'm thinking
[1:13:48] what was that you know that little bit
[1:13:51] of radium I hear that rolling in the
[1:13:52] back and I'm thinking Lord remember you
[1:13:55] talked to me what what what was that
[1:13:59] and maybe God just says well child
[1:14:01] that's old you know we're moving on you
[1:14:04] well you know whatever you got from that
[1:14:07] we're moving forward that was
[1:14:09] yesterday's lesson that was yesterday's
[1:14:11] food and you're getting pulled forward
[1:14:13] and you're thinking Lord but that was so
[1:14:15] good I'd love to go back there someday I
[1:14:18] love to go back to that
[1:14:21] my
[1:14:23] that's a problem of abundance
[1:14:26] God's just so good unto whom it was
[1:14:30] revealed that not unto themselves but
[1:14:32] unto us they did Minister the things
[1:14:35] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:14:38] that have preached the gospel with the
[1:14:40] Holy Ghost Sent From Heaven
[1:14:42] which things angels
[1:14:45] desired to look upon
[1:14:48] that's where we're at we're sitting in
[1:14:51] Heavenly places enjoying the things that
[1:14:54] these prophets and scribes and even
[1:14:56] angels desired to look upon and they're
[1:15:00] revealed to you that's why I love that
[1:15:03] song that song uh this is the air I
[1:15:07] believe you know this this is my daily
[1:15:10] bread your very word
[1:15:14] spoken to me
[1:15:21] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[1:15:27] be sober and hope to the end for the
[1:15:30] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[1:15:34] the revelation of Jesus Christ so all of
[1:15:37] these glorious things that we are seeing
[1:15:43] and the way that they break upon us and
[1:15:46] we say oh God that is so beautiful
[1:15:48] that's so wonderful if you could really
[1:15:50] get in the spirit
[1:15:52] and don't ever let anybody tell you some
[1:15:55] kind of Catholic thing like you know
[1:15:57] well that's for priests and that's for
[1:16:00] the spiritual people and that's for the
[1:16:02] preacher that's for somebody besides me
[1:16:05] you know I I don't seem to get it no you
[1:16:08] you you stay in there you just keep
[1:16:10] digging you're going to hit gold you are
[1:16:13] going to hit gold and it's going to be
[1:16:15] sweet and you're going to know the taste
[1:16:18] of the honey of the word of God God
[1:16:21] don't put that thirst in your soul to
[1:16:24] for you to come up empty oh no Jesus
[1:16:28] said when he was on Earth he said
[1:16:30] blessed are you that thirst and hunger
[1:16:33] for righteousness for you shall be
[1:16:36] filled Jesus ain't no liar Jesus's words
[1:16:39] don't fall he is a rewarder of them that
[1:16:43] diligently seek them you don't have to
[1:16:46] get what somebody else got God God's got
[1:16:48] something for you
[1:16:51] hey man
[1:16:52] oh and I get excited because I when I
[1:16:56] see young people just out in the parking
[1:16:58] not visiting with these young people and
[1:17:00] I I miss those days when my kids were
[1:17:02] young like that had all their friends
[1:17:04] over and all of that life but you know
[1:17:08] I and I look back and I think men
[1:17:10] I was 19 come out of Catholicism walked
[1:17:15] right out of it I didn't know what I was
[1:17:18] doing but I walked right out of that
[1:17:21] dark dingy religious death dungeon cold
[1:17:27] dead would have sealed me away in death
[1:17:30] religion and gone to church like that
[1:17:33] the rest of my life maybe become an
[1:17:35] altar boy or a priest or just in some
[1:17:37] dead Church the rest of my life and the
[1:17:40] grace of God at 19 years old did I know
[1:17:45] what I was doing but I started to read
[1:17:48] my Bible
[1:17:52] the prophet of God said if you want to
[1:17:54] be more spiritual do what
[1:17:57] read your Bible and pray
[1:18:07] okay
[1:18:09] so we missed something this morning and
[1:18:11] that's what's wonderful about being able
[1:18:13] to be in the evening service
[1:18:18] is there something really precious in
[1:18:19] here to me that we didn't read
[1:18:26] now it says in Isaiah 22 22
[1:18:30] and the key of the House of David will I
[1:18:34] lay
[1:18:34] upon his shoulders
[1:18:37] so he shall open and None Shall shut and
[1:18:39] he shall shut and None Shall open
[1:18:42] the spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:18:46] reference
[1:18:48] concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[1:18:52] ministry in the church
[1:18:56] what the Key of David signified at the
[1:18:59] time is a mere Shadow which is now
[1:19:02] fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst
[1:19:06] of the lampstands
[1:19:10] it has to do with our Lord after his
[1:19:14] resurrection
[1:19:15] and not his Earthly pilgrimage
[1:19:20] so it's just interesting that a lot of
[1:19:23] times we think of prophecies and we
[1:19:25] think well that was Jesus first coming
[1:19:27] that was when Jesus was on Earth and
[1:19:30] when the you know like in the Book of
[1:19:33] Psalms and they talk about the David
[1:19:35] talks about the crucifixion my God my
[1:19:37] God why hast Thou forsaken me my bones
[1:19:39] stare at me and he you see all of these
[1:19:43] Prophecies of things in Jesus's Earthly
[1:19:47] Journey
[1:19:48] and then there was other prophecies
[1:19:51] about his kingdom and his Reign and his
[1:19:54] power and his and and about the
[1:19:56] Millennium and the second coming of the
[1:19:58] Lord
[1:20:00] and so a lot of times we're looking at
[1:20:02] these prophecies and we're saying is
[1:20:03] that his first coming is that his second
[1:20:05] coming but very interesting that brother
[1:20:07] Branham points out here that this was a
[1:20:10] prophecy in Isaiah 20 22 22 it was a
[1:20:14] prophecy about Jesus's Ministry in the
[1:20:18] church in the church ages because he was
[1:20:21] walking in the midst of those seven
[1:20:23] candlesticks and this was him
[1:20:27] this was him himself walking amongst us
[1:20:31] brother Graham said walking meaning in
[1:20:33] action
[1:20:34] and he's revealing himself and he's
[1:20:37] governing and he's moving amongst us in
[1:20:41] his church and in these Church ages he's
[1:20:43] manifesting his seventh the Sevenfold
[1:20:47] Glory of his person
[1:20:50] and you want to know Jesus well
[1:20:52] sometimes there's a little study in it
[1:20:55] you know sometimes we we sing songs and
[1:20:58] we say oh Jesus I want to know you more
[1:21:00] and and we pray and we read our Bible
[1:21:03] and but if you
[1:21:07] if you press in a little bit then this
[1:21:10] is not
[1:21:11] so academic
[1:21:15] you know if the Lord will help you a
[1:21:17] little it's not so academic it's him
[1:21:20] revealing who he really is
[1:21:24] to you
[1:21:28] now
[1:21:29] how would you like it
[1:21:32] if uh if uh I started I'm up here
[1:21:36] and I started talking about who brother
[1:21:39] Ben is and you know how he feels about
[1:21:42] things and maybe who he likes and who he
[1:21:45] doesn't like and you know I start all
[1:21:48] talking about brother Ben here well
[1:21:50] pretty soon brother Ben's going to say
[1:21:52] wait a minute can can I say who I am why
[1:21:56] why does somebody else have to say what
[1:21:59] kind of guy I am let me just tell you
[1:22:01] what kind of guy I am and this is how
[1:22:03] God in his word he wants to commune to
[1:22:06] you because he wants you to get it right
[1:22:08] and that's why he built his church on
[1:22:11] Revelation he didn't built it on hearsay
[1:22:14] he didn't build it on on theology he
[1:22:17] didn't build it on reasoning and
[1:22:19] rationality and and you know let's
[1:22:22] reason this all out and leave him out of
[1:22:24] the picture no he comes himself and
[1:22:27] reveals to you who I am and he wants to
[1:22:30] tell you
[1:22:31] what he thinks about you
[1:22:36] yeah it's wonderful
[1:22:38] so I just thought that was just really
[1:22:41] beautiful
[1:22:43] how that brother Branham brought to our
[1:22:45] attention that here's a prophecy in the
[1:22:47] Old Testament saying that he's going to
[1:22:50] be
[1:22:51] in the church
[1:22:53] with that Key of David
[1:22:55] on his shoulder
[1:22:57] and those prophets in old
[1:22:59] they were ministering those things to us
[1:23:02] so we could understand our relationship
[1:23:06] to him
[1:23:07] in this day
[1:23:09] because he's going to have a church
[1:23:11] and did he know who was going to be in
[1:23:15] his church
[1:23:16] sure
[1:23:18] did he know
[1:23:20] when you were born what color hair you'd
[1:23:22] have
[1:23:23] you know what color eyes you'd have
[1:23:26] did he know what kind of temperament
[1:23:28] that you'd have
[1:23:30] and what kind of complexes what kind of
[1:23:33] Hang-Ups and what kind of strengths and
[1:23:36] what kind of
[1:23:37] affections
[1:23:42] my I heard that old sister the other
[1:23:44] night
[1:23:47] and she's so excited about hearing some
[1:23:49] of the things the prophet said and it
[1:23:51] just blessed my soul
[1:23:53] and I thought shame on you Dennis don't
[1:23:56] you never talk to an older person and
[1:23:58] think that they can't come to the Lord
[1:24:00] and come into the message of the hour
[1:24:03] because confession is good for the soul
[1:24:05] I've had that where you know I thought
[1:24:07] well you know the person's pretty old
[1:24:09] they're probably just setting their ways
[1:24:11] and you know make no sense in talking to
[1:24:13] him shame on me my okay well I just
[1:24:16] wanted to read a few quotes is this all
[1:24:18] right brother David just just want to
[1:24:19] read a couple quotes about communion
[1:24:22] because
[1:24:23] as I was coming over to church
[1:24:25] I thought about how brother Branham
[1:24:29] talked about communion being a showdown
[1:24:33] and I remember being overseas and you
[1:24:36] know we have these words and then you've
[1:24:39] you know and somebody asked you what
[1:24:40] does Showdown mean
[1:24:44] and so I have to tell them
[1:24:47] you know what I know from like the
[1:24:49] western movies when the two guys come
[1:24:52] out and one said I'm the fastest in the
[1:24:55] west and the other guy said I'm the
[1:24:58] fastest of the West well a lot of
[1:25:00] talking can go on and and you know they
[1:25:03] can argue or you did me wrong and I did
[1:25:05] you wrong but there come a day when they
[1:25:08] one day
[1:25:09] one day all that
[1:25:12] that's over with and now we're standing
[1:25:14] out in the street and this is The
[1:25:17] Showdown
[1:25:20] yeah this is The Showdown we're going to
[1:25:21] figure out who's the fastest in the West
[1:25:25] now if there's another definition of
[1:25:27] Showdown
[1:25:29] then uh
[1:25:31] I don't know it
[1:25:35] brother Bram said and now we're going to
[1:25:38] have communion tonight and that's the
[1:25:41] time that we all enjoy I'm sure
[1:25:44] I think it's the Delight of a
[1:25:46] Christian's heart is to know that he is
[1:25:50] coming to keep a Commandment that Jesus
[1:25:52] left us
[1:25:54] there's two Commandments that Jesus left
[1:25:56] us two material things one of them is
[1:25:59] communion service and the other is water
[1:26:01] baptism
[1:26:03] otherwise there's no touch and handle
[1:26:05] nothing else left in it see just nope
[1:26:08] Penance and dragging on your knees and
[1:26:11] all these other kinds of things it's
[1:26:13] just water baptism and communion
[1:26:16] so we're always happy to come to this
[1:26:19] and I believe the Bible said blessed is
[1:26:22] he that does his Commandments they have
[1:26:26] the right to enter into the tree of life
[1:26:28] for into
[1:26:30] the city or the holy city for without
[1:26:33] our dogs and whoremongers and so forth
[1:26:36] which is to be Cast Away
[1:26:38] and then the communion service is always
[1:26:42] a real strict one because it brings us
[1:26:46] to a showdown see as we'll read in a
[1:26:50] little while in the scriptures
[1:26:54] just wanted to read
[1:26:56] another one with that expression
[1:26:59] showdown in it if you bear with me just
[1:27:02] a minute
[1:27:07] now that doesn't need any explaining
[1:27:09] it's just this if we eat and drink
[1:27:11] unworthily we eat and drink damnation to
[1:27:14] our own self not Discerning the Lord's
[1:27:17] body for this cause many are weakly and
[1:27:20] sick among you and many are dead see
[1:27:23] when we come to take communion
[1:27:26] every Christian should take communion
[1:27:29] it's your duty it's a showdown see Jesus
[1:27:33] said if you don't take it you have no
[1:27:36] part with me see
[1:27:39] but he that eateth and drinketh thee
[1:27:42] unworthily eats and drinks damnation to
[1:27:45] himself that is if you're still out with
[1:27:48] the world and doing things of the world
[1:27:50] and people see you taking communion
[1:27:53] you're doing wrong
[1:27:55] you're only bringing disgrace to you
[1:27:58] and it'll only harm you
[1:28:01] it isn't that it'll harm God it'll harm
[1:28:04] you and so a person should examine
[1:28:08] themselves you see The Showdown to it
[1:28:18] for I truly think
[1:28:20] that it's the duty of every Christian to
[1:28:23] take communion the Bible said if you
[1:28:25] take this knot you have no part with me
[1:28:28] and I believe that it's a showdown time
[1:28:32] for the Christians
[1:28:34] if we do not take it we have no part
[1:28:37] with him and if we take it unworthily
[1:28:40] then we're guilty of the body and death
[1:28:44] of Christ
[1:28:45] so it gets to a place where it keeps the
[1:28:48] Christian prayed up
[1:28:50] when he comes to the communion we should
[1:28:52] come reverently
[1:28:54] solemnly sacredly walking up confessing
[1:28:59] all of our wrongs praying one for the
[1:29:03] other not only that but we should feel
[1:29:06] if there's a brother or sister Among Us
[1:29:09] that we feel is just a little bit out of
[1:29:12] line somewhere
[1:29:13] our hearts ought to be burdened for that
[1:29:17] person on communion night especially to
[1:29:21] see them that they'll be able to walk up
[1:29:24] and take communion not be condemned with
[1:29:27] the world
[1:29:28] because there are brothers and sisters
[1:29:33] God bless you tonight it's been a real
[1:29:35] privilege to be here with you pray the
[1:29:37] Lord's blessings on you and we'll just
[1:29:39] turn the service over now God bless you
[1:29:46] thank you
[1:29:50] as Sharon with Dennis on the way over
[1:29:52] that
[1:29:54] of all the knights
[1:29:57] of church communions
[1:29:59] always the weakest night
[1:30:02] and uh
[1:30:04] don't you I like that quote don't you
[1:30:06] want to get to that place where you can
[1:30:07] win that Showdown
[1:30:10] you know
[1:30:11] where you can come up and have
[1:30:13] fellowship with him
[1:30:15] and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[1:30:18] yes you've done wrong
[1:30:20] yes you failed
[1:30:23] but the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:30:25] cleansed us from all righteousness
[1:30:28] and we've confessed our sins and our
[1:30:30] sins are gone before us
[1:30:32] and that's what he said he says if you
[1:30:34] confess your sins he's faithful and just
[1:30:37] to forgive him
[1:30:39] and
[1:30:40] to accept that forgiveness
[1:30:43] you know our messenger told us that a
[1:30:46] Christian
[1:30:48] can never amount to anything till he
[1:30:50] accepts what Calvary
[1:30:53] has done for him
[1:30:55] and that's what tonight is
[1:30:59] it's
[1:31:01] you know it's not to talk about them but
[1:31:04] it's for you to get to know him
[1:31:07] and how do you get to know somebody
[1:31:09] spend time with them
[1:31:11] you commune with them that's always been
[1:31:15] a thrill in my life when I've got to sit
[1:31:17] down and meet somebody being a pastor
[1:31:20] there's a lot of people come to your
[1:31:22] church you don't get to know very well
[1:31:24] you love to know them you long to know
[1:31:27] him you wanted to come over to your
[1:31:29] house you want to get close to them and
[1:31:31] then you've got an opportunity to spend
[1:31:32] some time with them in such a delightful
[1:31:35] side of their personality comes out or
[1:31:38] you find out something about them and it
[1:31:41] just lifts your heart
[1:31:42] uh on the inside because you've drawn
[1:31:46] closer
[1:31:47] and this is what tonight is
[1:31:50] it's a time for you to draw closer to
[1:31:52] him
[1:31:53] for for you to commune with him and talk
[1:31:55] to him and just to think that he knows
[1:31:59] what you have need of even before you
[1:32:01] ask so it's not always a time of just
[1:32:04] asking asking but it's a time to ask the
[1:32:09] Lord
[1:32:10] oh like Dennis said reveal yourself to
[1:32:14] me that I might know you better you know
[1:32:18] me Lord
[1:32:19] for you you know me before I ever got
[1:32:22] here but I've come to commune with you
[1:32:25] and to to know for you touch me and
[1:32:29] speak to my heart give me Revelation
[1:32:32] gotta open a window that I could look
[1:32:35] out or open my heart that I might
[1:32:38] receive something just like he said that
[1:32:41] blessing of having a burden for those
[1:32:44] that are open my heart today Lord
[1:32:47] so I can receive that kind of care that
[1:32:50] kind of Burden open my heart today that
[1:32:52] I could have eyes have
[1:32:54] that I could see when somebody's in need
[1:32:57] or somebody needs something open my eyes
[1:33:00] make me tender to the church around me
[1:33:04] and the people around me do you believe
[1:33:07] he could do it if you ask him
[1:33:10] amen do you think he can make you
[1:33:11] different
[1:33:13] amen that's what communion does
[1:33:16] can make you different
[1:33:18] amen the prophet of God said there's
[1:33:20] healing in communion
[1:33:22] many of people have come and taken
[1:33:24] communion and been made well
[1:33:27] so let's stand together and the brothers
[1:33:30] could go prepare the
[1:33:33] uh
[1:33:36] uh
[1:33:39] not communion for our service tonight
[1:33:43] and of course we'll turn to our
[1:33:44] scriptures found in the first 11th
[1:33:48] chapter of First Corinthians
[1:33:51] when Paul brought communion uh to the
[1:33:54] church and
[1:33:58] introduced it to them
[1:34:01] I sure there might have been a question
[1:34:02] on Paul's heart
[1:34:04] as the disciple shared with him the
[1:34:08] experience that they had in the upper
[1:34:10] room
[1:34:11] and I'm I'm
[1:34:13] I bet your heart Paul's heart burned
[1:34:15] within them as he heard them tell them
[1:34:18] about the Lord Jesus
[1:34:20] and the experiences and the stories
[1:34:24] uh that they had with him you know
[1:34:27] people say that people get tired of the
[1:34:30] stories of the Prophet I love to hear
[1:34:32] every story
[1:34:34] anything somebody can tell me about him
[1:34:36] just sets my soul on fire and then Paul
[1:34:40] he he no doubt being what he was he
[1:34:44] looked into it and then he received it
[1:34:48] from the Lord
[1:34:49] and then he brought it to this church
[1:34:51] and I believe to every Gentile church I
[1:34:56] don't know why the church world
[1:34:58] has abandoned communion
[1:35:01] be honest with you I don't know why this
[1:35:03] message has abandoned communion
[1:35:05] so much could we do it once a month here
[1:35:08] because the best of my of knowledge
[1:35:10] that's the way brother Branham did it
[1:35:12] I know many places don't have communion
[1:35:15] once a year maybe
[1:35:16] but regardless you have communion
[1:35:20] in your heart
[1:35:22] all the time let us read
[1:35:24] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:35:27] which also I delivered unto you
[1:35:30] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:35:34] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:35:37] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:35:40] and said take eat
[1:35:42] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:35:45] this do in remembrance of me
[1:35:49] and after the same manner also he took
[1:35:52] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:35:54] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:35:57] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:36:01] remembrance of me
[1:36:03] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:36:06] drink this cup
[1:36:08] Ed Show the Lord's death till he come
[1:36:12] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:36:15] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:36:17] unworthily
[1:36:19] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:36:21] blood of the Lord
[1:36:23] but let a man examine himself
[1:36:27] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:36:31] drink of that cup
[1:36:34] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:36:37] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:36:39] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:36:43] body
[1:36:46] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:36:49] among you in many sleep for if we would
[1:36:52] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:36:55] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:36:58] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:37:01] condemned with the world
[1:37:03] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:37:06] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:37:11] for If any man hunger let him eat at
[1:37:13] home that you come not together under
[1:37:16] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:37:20] order when I come
[1:37:23] I like the part of what Dennis brought
[1:37:25] out
[1:37:26] or the prophet of God said you have that
[1:37:29] burden for your brother that he might
[1:37:31] take communion to that that's part of
[1:37:36] that tearing that's part of Discerning
[1:37:38] the Lord body who's sick among us
[1:37:42] who's needy Among Us who's in financial
[1:37:45] trouble Among Us who's going through a
[1:37:48] hard time Among Us don't you want to
[1:37:50] take the whole burden of the body on I
[1:37:53] want to be a part of it everybody a
[1:37:55] member of the bodies sacrificing and
[1:37:58] supplying the need to every other one
[1:38:01] Lord don't let my heart be selfish let
[1:38:04] me come in communion to you this evening
[1:38:06] that I can be more like you father that
[1:38:09] you can open my heart to your attributes
[1:38:12] you can open my spirit that I can be
[1:38:15] tender Lord and more kind and more aware
[1:38:19] of my atmosphere
[1:38:22] and the needs of others Lord I I come to
[1:38:26] this evening to
[1:38:29] tell you I'm sorry for my shortcomings
[1:38:33] but father I do want to follow in your
[1:38:36] footsteps and Lord I'm asking tonight
[1:38:38] that you give us a personal touch that
[1:38:41] that love could shed abroad in our heart
[1:38:45] by your spirit we ask these in Jesus
[1:38:48] name Amen Let Us bless the bread
[1:38:52] and the wine this evening
[1:38:57] you all you all bless it too and pray
[1:39:01] for it too let us all bust the bread
[1:39:03] together you pray in your heart in your
[1:39:05] spirit our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:39:08] this bread represents your body
[1:39:11] Lord not only the one that was
[1:39:14] sacrificed on our behalf and paid the
[1:39:17] price for our sins
[1:39:19] but the whole Universal Body of Christ
[1:39:22] every member fitted and joined together
[1:39:25] every member having a portion of you
[1:39:29] living in them as the great prophets
[1:39:32] were spoke of you as our brother spoke
[1:39:35] this evening that it was you and them
[1:39:38] ministering to us
[1:39:40] father this body represents that tonight
[1:39:43] your spirit in US ministering to others
[1:39:46] father may it burn deep in our heart
[1:39:50] father May Our Testimony be that we walk
[1:39:53] and live as you have walked and lived
[1:39:55] father made this bread father bring that
[1:39:59] strength into our body
[1:40:00] heavenly father in this wine
[1:40:02] representing the life
[1:40:06] father and the stimulation that returns
[1:40:10] back onto the believer
[1:40:12] father as we know that the word says
[1:40:14] that every other sacrifice just stood as
[1:40:18] a substitute and a representation
[1:40:21] but this sacrifice allowed the sacrifice
[1:40:25] to return back upon the believer
[1:40:28] and make a difference in their lives
[1:40:32] Lord may this communion deceive me make
[1:40:35] a difference in each of Our Lives as
[1:40:37] we're stimulated with the life that was
[1:40:40] in the sacrifice that you would come
[1:40:43] into our lives father and our lives have
[1:40:46] become more like yours we ask you to
[1:40:48] breast this bread and this wine to us
[1:40:52] this evening in communion in Jesus
[1:40:55] precious name we pray
[1:40:57] amen
