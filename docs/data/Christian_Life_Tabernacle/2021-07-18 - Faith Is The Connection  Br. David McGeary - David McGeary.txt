the resurrection life that you've sent back upon your believer lord we're thankful that our easter is here to know that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord that you're risen and alive and living in your people lord that's what easter proved is that you did everything that you said you would do lord you said that you tear down this body and in three days i'll raise it up lord and you said that you'd send your comforter back that you wouldn't leave us comfortless lord we're so thankful o god that you sent your holy spirit that we'd have the potentials the resurrected life inside of us lord that's why we've gathered here this evening lord is because it's it's not what we've done but it's all what you have done lord if it was left up to us we'd be out there in the world we'd be lost in sin many of us wouldn't even be alive lord but you are looking out over your seed you are watching over us you are keeping us lord because you had a predestinated plan for our life lord and

jesus lord we're hungering and thirsting for righteousness we want more lord that's why we're here we're not here to fulfill a religious obligation lord but we believe that the creator of heavens and earth is here lord and that there's needs that are represented here lord we have questions we need answers lord we need more revelation we believe lord that by the preaching of the word these things will break and unfold to us lord so may we just purpose in our heart right now to have an expectation for the supernatural may we have an expectation for your word to be manifested that the man of god would be moved out of the way lord and there would just be such a supernatural word go forth that would lift us into higher heights and deeper depths in you lord that we would all be able to say in our hearts wasn't it good to go into the house of the lord we just love you lord we commit the believers to you those that couldn't make it from the musicians lord all the way to those in the back

[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen aren't you glad for that song of praise they put in your heart amen brother david has a special if it could come at this time can i get the love of god god bless you soon yeah i just want to sing this song uh you know a lot of times we sit in the pew and we ask god god do this for me god do that for me and you know the song i want to sing really goes with the sermon we've been listening to just to see the love of god out he just reached down and you know he overlooked a lot of things about all of us and then he just shows us and you know this song just came in a moment where i'm just expecting a miracle again so i just want to sing the song to remind him i love him even if he doesn't do it i still love him the same so if you can sing with me can i get the love of god the love of god [Music] is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell he goes beyond the higher stars and reaches to the guilty pair bow down with care [Music] onside [Music] and pardon from his sins o love of god our rich and pure i'm measureless and it's strong oh it's shot forever [Music] refuse to pray on rocks and hills [Music] all merger-less and it's strong reading grace [Music] of god [Music] and strong it's shot forever [Music] of parchment made [Music] and every man is [Music] [Music] [Music] those stretched from sky to scare the love of god o love of god [Music] and strong it's sad forever [Music] the love of god [Music] yes it's strong [Music] just amen aren't you glad for the love of god amen we'll never comprehend fully what that means amen when we were in sins and didn't want anything to do with him and then we stumble and fall and thought that was either and wanted to go back that love was still there just amen are we thankful for it amen we don't have any written requests up here i want to continue to remember sister karen and sister heidi and then the needs represented in the body and if you have any upon your heart just leave your hand up to him amen brother randy if you could just come and take this before the lord and sing as a special amen i believe in equal opportunities i think when we come to church we have to come with a song and you know i know when i look in the audience some people just just talking i don't believe you should just come and sit and think oh you know i'm exempt nobody examined amen i believe we're in the presence of god and we can worship him amen amen let's power heads gracious heavenly father lord jesus we just counted an honor and a privilege lord to know that lord is beyond our comprehension father and i believe your prophet even told us that lord we would spend all eternity with you unfolding yourself to us the the depth and the riches of your love father that these mortal minds could never comprehend father but there's a there's a pull in our hearts oh god a seed that you planted there before the foundation of the world that could recognize lord and to know that we could come before you sinless and spotless lord because we've been cleansed by the blood of your son the lord jesus christ and lord as we bring the needs before the church lord we know that they're already answered even now but father we just plead the blood lord for the ones that need healing lord ones that need salvation father ones that need deliverance lord lord we're a needy people oh god but you're a god that meets each one of us right where we're at father lord it's such a paradox lord that a a message could go forth lord from the pulpit and could be to one person one thing and yet to another one something totally different father but it's because your word is eternal father and meets us right where we have our needs lord we just pray that you would go forth in power and demonstration of your spirit lord that you do it once again father to me your people right where they are lord may you just bless the tithes and offerings lord god as we've given just a little bit of ourselves lord our time lord our natural things that you've given to us lord that we can give back it's just our it's our duty to do that father and we do it with a cheerful heart father you said you love a cheerful giver lord and we want to give not only our tithes and offerings lord but even our time and our praises and our worship with cheerful hearts oh god to lord with sing with revelation to sing with understanding lord not just because it's a form but lord god knowing even if we couldn't explain it with mortal lips lord of revelation in our heart that would reach out to you oh god to hear that eagles cry that eagle scream lord and know that we're represented there lord just ask that you'd be with us in the remainder of the service now in the name of jesus christ we pray amen is it all right if i just grab this one i guess amen god bless you i i certainly know that every time i come in if i catch brother billy's eye and and even brother matthew and different ones i lord uh just has it on my heart usually i'm already flipping through the mental songbook when i step through the doors sometimes so if i were to sing a song by his grace i trust it's a blessing to you i guess i'll just start and we'll just try to hit the key by the grace of god so some days track some days fly some days i think of the day i die some days thrill me some days straight and one day jesus will call my name one day jesus will call my name as days go by i hope i don't stay the same i want to get so close to him that it's no big change on that day when jesus calls my name some days i grasp another's i curse that number of days i've put myself first but it's not what i do the cross made that plane and one day jesus he's gonna call my name oh one day jesus will call my name as days go by i hope i don't stay the same i'm gonna get so close to him that it's no big change on that day when jesus calls my name and some days fly some days fly and some days i think of the day that i die some days thrill me and some days they drain but i know one day jesus will call my name one day jesus will call my name as days go by lord i

evangelistic night of fellowship just trust the lord will bless us and believe that all things are good let us show our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless us tonight we're believers father and we believe that all things are possible that everything has its time and its place and you have a reason for doing all things when we're in a season of sorrow lord there's a great purpose behind it and we know that all things work together for our good to them that are called according to your purpose lord and we trust in that and lord that gives us the strength to endure gives us the strength to overcome it gives us peace that surpass understanding and joy that's unspeakable father just grant us this time of fellowship tonight we pray in jesus precious name we pray amen amen you have your bibles let's turn to romans 8 and and we'd like to read this scripture verse there in the uh of starting with the uh fifth verse and just read a few verses there it says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritual minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god amen amen let's turn over and read one other scripture here found in hebrews and let's starting with the 11th chapter in the first verse and we just want to talk a little bit about this tonight so he said if you're carnal minded you can't please god now we find out but also in this scripture what pleases god now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear now that's a great scripture right there so we're going to hold that in our thought there that through faith we understand this by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gift and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him father we just ask you to bless your word to us tonight in your precious name we pray amen amen we just want to maybe see that we just want to talk a little bit about this great faith but you know i i wanted just to bring to our remembrance something that that was so beautiful this morning and i don't know if you're capable of uh back pulling up that paragraph 177 from easter seal and i just got looking at this it caught my attention uh a while back and and as brother branham was preaching and and uh saying the things that he said i i just felt the burden on his heart and i just felt the emotion that he had and the things that he was saying and how how much he was just almost like hurting for the people you know because he knew that this great event was uh going to be upon them very shortly and it it it seemed like they were missing it the importance of really what it was but can you find that paragraph 177 and i i just just the i get enamored and i just marvel even at the sentence structure of how that brother branham says thing but and we want to talk about this faith but so listen to this he says now let me show you he says i don't care if you're dead or whether or where you're at that quickening power never leaves years and years after his death his meat had rotten away and the skim worms had eaten it up but they were packing a dead man one day and throw him in on that bones and there was so much quickening power there until the man come back to life again now i'm gonna add a twist to that that is just my own personal thing for fellowship so that he says that it brought him back to life again hallelujah raised him up from the dead because that quickening power that was upon that saint of god never left him stayed right on those bones oh remember we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone if we are his bride so that quickening power not only was it predestinated to us but it will never leave us death won't bother that quickening power at all though the spin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god glory to god what uh now listen to this next statement i don't know what i say what a hope for an old man like me knowing i see my end time right out yonder soon as 56 years old i just think that the statement's astounding to me i don't know what i'm saying but he was so confident in that quickening power and we know he died at 56 years old we know that he said that this was that this could be my very last easter and it was he said i know of that i have great trials and troubles out ahead of me but i just thought that how beautiful it is that that quickening power is still upon the word of god today amen that that's what makes it so beautiful and so i went back over and uh over to the paragraphs on 34 2 27 the prophet of god makes this wonderful statement he said i i stood there and looked over that time i stood there and looked over that time so he's in a time somewhere and he's looking over it and i seen tens of thousands times thousands coming young men and women running throwing their arms around me screaming and i looked right back and seen myself lying on the bed oh lord let me look past the curtain of time what is it what is it it's the quickening power that will catch us away that great quickening power the quickening power come in this last day that's the power that's going to catch us away is the quickening power that comes in this last day and he goes on he says i saw he says okay in this last days that's what i'm in arizona for right now there's many people sitting right here stood right here at phoenix and heard me tell you from this very platform thus saith the lord how many remembers it now go something is fixing to happen i saw seven angels come didn't life magazine pack it as the fog of it floated across here 27 miles high and 30 miles across is not fred sofman and these others gene mormons sitting back there stood right there when them seven angels appeared right here on the hill it shook the hills for miles around like that there stood seven angels and throwed a sword in your hand saying go home and open these seven seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent see in all these things that's been fussed about it's thus saith the lord what is it the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power now i want to just just talk about the simplicity of faith and if what faith means to us and so in the next paragraph he makes this statement you see see it depends on what attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not so just think about that there's a there's there's a part of it that we play that whether it's going to do any good or not so he says this the the beyond the curtain of time the seven angels coming this great uh deliverance of marriage and divorce serpent seed all these things that have come to pass he says it's the quickening power that's coming to the church to make her ready but it depends on what attitude you take towards it whether it's going to do you any good so if you're going to get something out of it you you know and and i'm i'm kind of going through that because you know some people are trying to get me to work out a little bit you know and uh they want me to get like a personal trainer you know and i know i don't have the right attitude towards that personal trainer you know what i mean until i i would i i he wouldn't do me any good you you know what i'm saying and and so you you begin to look at oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it help us to have faith in it okay you know i mean so it was sent to do something the opening of the seals the revealing of serpenty the preaching of marriage and divorce all the sermon titles we could bring them off it was sent to do something you understand it wasn't it wasn't sent to be a theological exercise in correcting false doctrine but it was it was sent to do something more than that it was sent to get me ready as he said earlier in the message it's sent to bring us into rapturing conditions so when you begin to approach something different then your approach basically is expressed in your expectations what am i expecting this message to do it's not here that i can sit back and look on it and examine it and say this is true this is true the godhead's true the teachings are true and that's true nothing against that because it is true scripturally it's true but but do do we approach it in such a manner that we have an expectation of what that it's going to do to me so it's going to do something to david mcderry it's going to perform a work on me it's going to there's going to be a transformation that takes place now do do i look at it that way do i approach it that way because he says it depends on your approach to it whether or not it's going to do you any good well what's the good that it's supposed to do that's what i know what's the good of it it does do me one bit of good to say the baptist doesn't have the godhead right or the pope's the antichrist which is all true it's amenable word but that's not what we're after we're not after a mental word something that we can all amen something that we can all get on board with something that we can form a fellowship around that that we can say well we're it we're in we're the bride where we can put accolades on ourselves and make claims you want to know something we're the bride but none of us know who is in that group but him there's going to be a lot of people there that surprise you what are you doing here i already sent you to hell years ago you know what i mean you don't approach anybody on what they believe you approach people because the love of god is shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit you love people regardless what you receive you receive by revelation so why should you judge something for something that they don't have so if it's not trying to form a universal comfort zone i like hanging around with these people because they speak the way i speak they talk the way i talk you know they're in the same groove i'm in and i take comfort in that no it comes back to a place of faith another faith says there's an evidence in this message okay and i want that evidence to become substance in me and this message sent that it was sent to get me ready so now i'm asking myself is this message this opening of the seals all that came in the prophet of god's message all that he was speaking about he said it's the quickening power coming to the church to make it ready that's what the opening of the seals was he said those seven angels what is it it's the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power now i wonder what what am i believing for so am i believing the carnal connection or am i believing the spiritual connection because this message is true carnally i don't care what anybody wants to argue whether what it is or what it's not but that picture was taken it can be disputed let them dispute it it won't do them any good and and so he we agree with that so see it depends on the attitude you take whether it'll do you do you any good or not though you have to believe that you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good and that he goes talking about this and i thought this statement is where i'm kind of going he said do you know he said why why could jesus say the paragraph 2 38 why could jesus say that i want to ask you why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen i wish i could make that stick you remember how he said it he was almost in pleading this morning he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him had to be fulfilled he knew that he was the one david spoke of now this scripture struck me this quotation do you know that you're the ones the bible speaks of amen do you know your position is in christ not what your position in christ but your position is in the anointing the anointed one if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like every day living to you why sure it's yours you're you're an eagle and that's your food and and so you know i think with our messenger facing what obviously lied before him his faith believed that what was promised was going to come it to pass in him and so we know that what faith is that faith is the connection between the supernatural and the natural it's the connection and you know any of us that's ever worked on more motors or worked on machinery or worked on anything we know that there's two substances to it and one's called the line and that's the power and the others the load and that's what's receiving the power to do what it's made to do so you have your you have your power that comes in and you have some means of disconnect that that keeps the the power and the load or running or the machine running or the vacuum cleaner running or the uh blender or the instapot guys talking in skill saws and all those different things but you understand that there's a power and that's the supernatural you know they've never really ever been able to come up with a definitive definition of electricity they know what they do to get it but to totally understand uh uh what it is exactly men's has never been able to come up with a definitive they know it's ions and protons and neutrons and all that stuff going on but it's it it's almost something that you can't see you know you can see the results of electricity brother tim have you ever felt the results of electricity yeah i know what it's like to be on the end of 277. you know you know i've had my hand vibrate until it's bruised you know but you can't see it it's there but you can't see it you can test it to know that it's there well so if we looked at electricity like like the great uh uh uh supernatural there's something that is a disconnect yes that that you're a that you're the power sits right here and and here's the here's the cause the purpose so you've got an engine or something that runs here and and you've got this power here well there's something right here that connects this power to this piece of machinery to make it run and do what it was designed to do and we're created to do something and there's a power there that can make us perform what that we're uh called to perform but but the the connection of those two is faith that that's the connection that's the disconnect so it can tell that something and anybody that's worked around these things knows that if if you uh put that disconnect on with a full load that you're gonna you're gonna get a uh sparks you're gonna get something that stands out you know and and you know it too maybe some of you that have had your vacuum cleaner on or something and you go to stick your plug in and it's on you see those little sparks that that that happen there you know a lot of times i've seen people and they see those little sparks they pull out they jump it's almost the fear that keeps them from making the connection you understand so in other words they they don't want that connection they don't want to throw that disconnect on and pull that power but that's what faith is faith is that is the disconnect it's the connection between the supernatural to the natural how does the supernatural get into our natural lives by faith by faith that's what that's what it happens it's by faith that it does those things and i thought that as he said even in here and he was talking about by faith he said here by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as of yet okay so he didn't see it so there's a supernatural that's up here and it's it's going to be rain because it's never been seen before it's it's it's going so therefore rain is going to be something that's supernatural and there's got to be something that that that connects that supernatural to the natural so there had to be something that connected the word that it was going to reign with noah and what that connection is is what connected that to noah was his faith that he had faith he heard it he believed it and and so it said by faith not seeing moved with fear prepared an ark i wrote my note who noah's faith was that connection that there was rain coming so much that he built the first cruise ship that's what he did by faith he was he was so up moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by faith you you look at abraham you know abraham by faith abraham believed the supernatural right and so by by faith abraham believed that god promised something that god was able to perform that which was to come if abraham would have turned it down right if he wouldn't have pulled the disconnect if i could say or or through the switch on to let that power come down and work in his life to transform him so here comes melchizedek melchizedek appears before abraham and and tells abraham that he's going to have a son and and sarah laughs and he discerns that and they're sitting in front of abraham abraham's looking at and we saw this great mystery in who is this malteser that abe melchizedek was showing abraham what every son of god would become he would become that that supernatural being without death or without days not only was he showing abraham what everyone would become he was showing abraham how that he was going to bring the promise to pass abraham this promise is going to come to pass because i'm going to make you young but because he believed it it allowed the supernatural to come in and perform what that his purpose was that his seed would become like the stars that man would be redeemed in his seed you've got to see we you can you can't you you've got to understand that the thing that connects the supernatural with the natural is faith and without it it's impossible to please god and i i thought when i was reading this little message and it it it struck out to me and i'd like to read the statement to you it was found in the influence of another and so the prophet of god's talking about the woman at the well he he came to the woman at the well and he said look at the woman at the well when she saw something happen brother she had two wings she got away with them right quick she come out there jacob's well to get some of that contaminated water that they was arguing about but when she got a drink out of the fountain of life she went into action right quick now this is what i just stood out in my heart she didn't say sir please tell me where you got your education where did you get this stuff at i've had people ask me that where did you get this at how did you learn it or how did you know that i had five husbands how did you know what was wrong with me how did you know i was a woman of samaria how do you know these things see she never asked for a carnal connection she didn't ask for a carnal explanation of how this was going to happen or how did you know this or how did it do it and i'm saying this for a reason because you know that they're they're they're raised up critics in this message and and and now they've gone beyond just their little things but they're holding anti-message conventions they're going overseas now and all their old missionary contacts and everything and they're they're trying to explain and explain see what they can't find is they can't find a carnal connection but it isn't the carnal because the carnal mind cannot connect with the supernatural faith is the connection that brings the supernatural so if you have faith it can be unexplainable noah believed something that had not been seen yet it wasn't known by the carnality so natural things are understood by natural minds the carnal mind understands natural things it understands things by by by natural things like like sight and smell and hearing and touch and taste it understands things by carnal natural things or it does the intellect or or emotions in intellect and reasoning and all those things those are all carnal connections and when someone doesn't have faith and they can't connect with the supernatural they have no way of bringing the supernatural into the natural because the supernatural only comes through the disconnect of faith so if you don't have faith you're disconnected you'll never find a carnal explanation for something that's spiritual he'll never understand something that has not yet been seen but faith is the connect and faith is a gift of god lest any man should boast it's what it's what connects it and when faith connects it then the supernatural comes into the natural and performs the promise that was believed but so many times we look for a carnal connect wait a minute there's got to be a reason they went so as far as saying well this is telepathy why if telepathy he could do that praise god what could god do you understand so you know a lot of times we battle because that's what satan always wants to present is there's got to be some carnal connection but the carnal the supernatural doesn't connect to the carnal on its own there's only one device that it goes through and in our code jay says there's only one device per every promise and that's faith you can't put more in one device on the circuit we've got one device that enters the supernatural into the natural world and that's faith faith the only thing that when you hear the promise and faith connects to that promise it doesn't ask when it doesn't ask why it doesn't have time it doesn't need a carnal time frame it doesn't need any reasoning it doesn't need a weather report it doesn't need anything alls it knows it's connected to the power can that it's going to happen because that's what faith is it's the connection god planned it that way and that's what every day abraham was asked to believe that he was going to add well faith believed it and so faith has got characteristics and and there there are certain things that that create the atmosphere if i can say this that allows the supernatural to connect with the natural so if i could say that with so when we have a a a disconnect or a starter or whatever these are in machinery those things are rated your switch is on the wall for electricians they're going to carry so much power they have a rating and if the load is greater than the faith it'll burn up you don't understand so you've got to connect and that connected connection has to be rated and so there's characteristics of the rating of faith you understand the power doesn't fail it's the device that fails the power burns up the device and all of a sudden the device is gone or the faith is gone there's no more power coming to the the instrument to have it do what it's performed and created to perform and can these and this is in this message the influence another he says what the church needs tonight first is to be reverent so you're going to talk about this faith it's another it's got to be reverent and there's it's got to understand the austerity and the wonderfulness and the perfection of god even being ma mindful of man what is man that god is even mindful of them can there just got to have a respect to what's happening the worst thing i've ever seen when i was an electrical contractor is having kids that come on the job that don't have respect for electricity i had a guy take a wiggins how many knows what a wiggins is all right a few of you do it's a device that tests how much electricity is there can this guy took this wiggins i you could tell it's brand new you know he had that brand new leather uh pouch there you know what i mean with that little prongs hanging out and you know his belt was all brand new and his two his clients were so you know they couldn't even open them up you know we always did when we hired somebody we asked for their clients that's a pair of pliers so give me your clients and if you couldn't throw them up in the air and have them go click click click click click click click click click click you didn't hire that guy because he hadn't used those things enough to make them loose you know it's just like some guys they don't they they don't look at you what you know they look at your hands you know if you don't have no cuts or no scars or no burns you ain't been you ain't been in the work business very long i mean you just know that the guy told me because i said i've never been cut i said you ain't been working long have you ever pinched yourself with a pair of dikes yeah there's all those things that goes with it so but so you you sit here and and and you you watch this that if it doesn't have these characteristics you understand so he says if you're not in respect if you're not in awe so this guy took this tester and he's walking over to this this cage and there's a panel under there and there's a big sign that he don't understand it says danger high voltage now he's going to take this little tester that's good for i don't know you might get 480 maybe out of a wiggins i wouldn't go to 880. and he was fixing to set that on 7200 7200 volts i barely got to him in time it was so close if i didn't get to him in time he would have killed a smoke and i looked at this guy i says what are you thinking you just don't walk into a steel plant all these cranes and stuff and walk around with your little toy testing things you almost got us both killed well let me tell you we kill a lot of people's faith or we ruin their device their connection to the supernatural because we're not reverent we don't have a reverence for the promise we we throw them out there that god's a healer with without much regard to what it took to make him a healer and give us the proof that his word comes to pass he he took he was by his stripes that we were healed he paid a price for that faith could have a place it rested on to make connection to the supernatural that the supernatural could come down into the natural and perform the promise and when the device fails the connection fails when the faith fails the supernatural has no more path to the natural it doesn't have a pathway it's been interrupted if you ever find something a plug that doesn't have any power you go back there's something that's interrupted that maybe in a j box maybe someplace else some of the wire nuts come off or you've lost a neutral you start going back or you go to a contact maybe a contact that fail you keep tracing that back to the source because if the source is there and the div and the instrument is there then it's got to be a failure in the connection and there's only one connection to the supernatural and it's faith by faith he listed all these people by faith by faith i love the movie that we watch deep call to the deep he stands there can he talk he says you know i'm waiting on something i can do nothing his faith but father you told me you told me i'm standing here in front of all these congressmen the vice president of the united states all these people i'm standing here because you commissioned me you told me to go you told me the angel would be there with me and by faith his faith was a connection to the supernatural that allowed the dynamics to come in and perform the mechanics you're not going to take a carnal substitute even intellect of the history of the message that's right you can't make a carnal connection a carnal connection can't take the load it'll burn up your device you'll find yourself losing your faith you'll find that you only have it for a season or you'll only have it uh for a period of time and that's what happened these guys had a carnal connection through relatives through experiences of other people of everything they had but they never had the they never possessed the connection themselves to the supernatural and therefore they couldn't take the load they had a meltdown melted their faith away so all they can do to defend themselves is say the supernatural ain't true the supernatural ain't true supernatural supernatural's always been there the truth of the matter is you just don't have a device to connect to it that's your problem and all you're trying to do is justify your meltdown no respect do you remember this morning why that he said that uh what was uh jonathan works what it was that healed him because he had respect for the supernatural to understand so this device has got to have ratings for it to be able to take the current and bring it to the promise which is the machine and start the promise up to perform the function for which that promise was created i hope the carnality of my types is something that you can understand vacuum cleaners created a vacuum carpet you got a cord and you got a plug the plug is what connects you don't have the plug you can't connect it but if you connect it the vacuum cleaner will do what it's created to do so there's another characteristic he says the next thing be humble i thought even in the messi this morning he said you know he says he said a christian doesn't vote because whoa far be it from a christian to say i've got this power or i've got that he said far be it from a christian it's it's got to be humble you never perform a miracle to prove anything that's right especially yourself did you hear him this morning to say i would hate to trust in my gifts or my preaching or my visions that's humility he didn't count that to one portion of his salvation he counted his full salvation to the one place that god meets the believer and the believer believes that that shed blood was accepted by the father and he sent the supernatural down to touch the life of the believer we don't we have nothing that we bring nothing we just accept the fact that he's forgiven us our sins we place ourselves humbly into his hands and let us mold us and teach us and correct us and tutor us to bring us to the place that we can receive more power from on high and then he said he says be humble and then the next thing he says is you've got to get yourself into action so there's things that that are are characteristic of faith real faith is rated real faith has specs you know what specs are right specifications things that determine what that it is it's description he says so you got to be you got to be reverent you got to be humble and you got to be willing to act you know you got to be willing to act if if the power hits the machine and it's not willing to act that machine's dead it's toast you go get another one because it's not willing to act it's just it's just not willing to go into action so you can have faith without being willing to go into action you could faith if faith isn't willing to act it it it the the current will burn it down how many people i've seen that have believed something that's walked off the platform in prayer walked out of a uh discussing the word of god and and and they have they gonna go do something about it and they failed to act and after a while the disconnects unlatched it's not connected anymore because it didn't have the characteristics to carry the supernatural to the natural and you'll never be able to take the supernatural and bring it into the natural lives and that's what we need we need a lot of help in this natural world our flesh needs help our mind needs help our families need help because the world's against us they're turning against us we need help and the help that we need is that quickening power that supernatural electricity and is only one way to get that supernatural electricity into our lives to perform what it's going to perform and that's faith brother doug mccues has gone on to be with the lord who's a friend of mine he told me he said david brother branham sat me down and looked me straight in the eye and i know a lot of people saw i wish he'd have sat down and looked me straightened and i don't think i wanted him to look me straight in the eye because i know there's a lot of things in there that i just soon stay where they're at and he said doug he said you can fast to your skin and bones and i don't know if this is on tape but this is what my friend told me and i trust him he said you can fast to your skin and bones he said you can cry till there's not a tear left in your eye you can holler until you don't have any voice he said he listed some other things he says but god will not do anything for you that he didn't say he would do for you and you know what all that other stuff is that's carnal connection it's carnal connection we've got for some reason we've got to have some carnal connection some way that we can connect outside of faith give me a reason to believe other than he said so give me some other reason i don't know about you i've been a christian a few years and i've got enough failures to know certain things work and certain things don't work i wish that i was to the place i didn't keep trying new things but how many times have you made a program for god to follow if this happens if this happens or if this comes to pass or if he does this you know what i mean we just we just think if if these things could come together or i can see how god's going to do it and that's fine for encouragement you know what i mean i like to be encouraged i like some somebody come and tell me he says well maybe that happened so this could happen yeah thank you that that gives me encouragement but no there's no carnal connections with the supernatural there can't be they're contrary one to another god gave one connection one device that can push the lever and bring the supernatural to the natural and that's faith and faith has a place and that's the word of god faith believes what he promised and if you want to take the power of the word and bring it into the natural to see that promise do its natural work faith is the only way that it can travel from the supernatural to the finished end and it'll short out any other path any other wire size any other method it'll fry it you know what happens to a transformer when it gets struck by lightning it melts down it can't hold the current and the only one thing that can hold the supernatural current all the way to its finished end and that's faith because faith was designed and if it's faith designed to faith it has these three attributes reverence humility and the willingness to go into action and that makes the the connection and i think that if anything this message did for me this morning it let me know that i need a lot of supernatural help to to change my attitude change my approaches no and i can't make a carnal connection i can't run out and say okay i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this and i'm going to be nicer and i'm going to be sweeter and i'm going to you know go mow the net neighbor's yard and i'm going to do some works no i've got to do one thing and that's what he said and if i do what he says and believe it and trust it and know that if i believe it it'll do what it said it would do the only connection i've faced and the prophet of god said he says this is our everyday living it's our everyday life and i like what james said in the fifth chapter he said above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yey in your navy nay at least you fall in the condemnation see right there is the description of respect and humility and if faith doesn't have those characteristics it'll fail and it'll fall into condemnation but listen he said if any among you if any among you afflicted let him pray is any mary let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of the faith and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sin they shall be forgiven him there was another quote that we put on the boards during prayer meetings and i encourage you to come to prayer meeting once a month just sacrifice come in and sit in the congregation of the lord and there's a quote they put up there i'm going to add limit the best i can it says if you will assemble yourselves together and call upon the lord he will hear you and i thought the other night that's exactly what we're doing we're actually fulfilling that word this is our everyday life our everyday life is we're right here now praying we've gathered together we're praying for sister heidi everybody in here praying for sister heidi everybody in here praying for sister parent praying for the need praying we're doing exactly what the word said to do but if we don't have the faith to say lord we're doing what you said do therefore i believe since we're doing this that your intended result will be fulfilled the work alone isn't enough the work alone doesn't connect it it's the faith in believing he is going to do what he said i'm doing what he asked me to do he's going to do what he said that's why jesus said every promise that was spoken of me i did it i fulfilled it therefore what is also spoken of me will come to pass that i'll lay my life down i will not suffer thy holy one to seek corruption that's when he went to calvary possessing he had faith in that word wasn't one doubt the past wasn't what brought him to calvary wasn't his past works it wasn't the miracles it wasn't the things that were done that brought him to that place what brought him to that place is there was still a promise that had to be fulfilled and there's still a promise that has to be fulfilled in us a quickening power that's going to bring every word of god to pass in our lives as we need it and the connection to the supernatural is faith let's don't create another program let's don't create a teaching let's don't create a doctrinal belief let's don't create a fellowship let's don't create a pat on the back and comparing ourselves one with another let's don't create anything but faith in god's word hey amen lord bless you musicians come brother billy lead us into some worship and we just trust those we just
