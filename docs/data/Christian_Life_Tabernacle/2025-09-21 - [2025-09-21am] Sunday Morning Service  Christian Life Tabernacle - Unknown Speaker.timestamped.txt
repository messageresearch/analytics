[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our heavenly father,
[37:24] may that fire burn in each of our hearts
[37:27] this morning.
[37:29] Lord, as we fellowship around your word,
[37:34] Father, may each individual
[37:38] take it personally to heart. Father, you
[37:41] know what each one has need of. Father,
[37:45] every victory they need, every fear they
[37:49] face, every lie the enemy speaks to him.
[37:53] Father, may your word meet that
[37:55] challenge this morning. And father, may
[37:59] each heart walk from this place knowing
[38:03] that you love them. We ask that you
[38:06] would help us this morning. In Jesus
[38:08] precious and wonderful name we pray.
[38:12] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you
[38:15] musicians.
[38:17] So nice. If you have your Bibles, let's
[38:20] uh turn in our Bibles to uh
[38:27] uh we're going to read two places.
[38:30] Uh let's start in Matthew 28:18.
[38:41] I think I have a
[38:48] think also
[38:50] um
[38:53] I think also we want to read in Matthew
[38:56] uh 10:8
[39:03] and we'll read here in ma Matthew
[39:07] the 10th chapter and then we'll go to
[39:09] the 28th and then we'll go to Mark uh
[39:14] 16. So let us just read here. It says
[39:20] in the fifth verse of the 10th chapter,
[39:23] it says,
[39:25] "These 12 Jesus sent forth
[39:29] and commanded them, saying, go not un to
[39:34] the way of the Gentile,
[39:37] and unto the cities of Samaria, enter ye
[39:41] not, but rather go to the lost sheep of
[39:44] the house of Israel,
[39:47] As you as you go, preach, saying, "The
[39:51] kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the
[39:54] sick, cleanse the leopard, raise the
[39:58] dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have
[40:03] received, freely give."
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then let's turn over to
[40:11] uh
[40:12] Matthew the 28th chapter.
[40:17] And the 16th verse
[40:29] and we just start with the 18th verse.
[40:33] And Jesus came and spake unto them,
[40:36] saying, "All power is given unto me in
[40:41] heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and
[40:45] teach all nations, baptizing them in the
[40:49] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[40:52] the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe
[40:57] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[41:00] you. And lo, I am with you always, even
[41:06] until the end of the world. Amen.
[41:10] Doesn't that make you feel good?
[41:13] Hallelujah. And then also in Mark
[41:19] starting with the 14th verse of the 16th
[41:23] chapter of the Gospel of St. Mark.
[41:36] Amen. He said, "Afterwards, he appeared
[41:40] unto the 11 as they sat at me and
[41:44] upgraded them with their unbelief and
[41:48] hardness of heart, because they believed
[41:51] not them which had seen him after he was
[41:56] risen." And he said unto them, "Go ye
[42:00] into all the world, and preach the
[42:02] gospel to every creature. He that
[42:06] believeth and is baptized shall be
[42:08] saved, but he that believeth not shall
[42:12] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[42:15] them that believe.
[42:18] In my name shall they cast out devils.
[42:21] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[42:24] shall take up serpents. And if they
[42:26] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[42:29] hurt them. and they shall lay hands on
[42:32] the sick and they shall recover. Our
[42:36] gracious father, we ask you to bless
[42:39] your word to us in Jesus precious name
[42:42] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May
[42:46] be seated this morning.
[42:53] We we want to take our thoughts this
[42:56] morning from a message that our prophet
[43:01] preached called end time evangelism.
[43:05] And you know so as you know in the
[43:09] beginning of the year um my heart was
[43:14] moved in the direction of uh what's our
[43:19] path forward or where do we go from
[43:23] here? you know what direction
[43:26] uh
[43:28] uh should we go not only as individuals
[43:32] but as a body of believers not only as a
[43:36] body of believers but as a family your
[43:40] home your life uh I think that we each
[43:45] of us in our lives should have a goal uh
[43:49] we should have a vision uh without a
[43:53] vision and the people perish. Something
[43:56] that's on your heart, something that you
[43:59] desire to do, a a way that you want to
[44:03] be, something that you want to
[44:05] accomplish. And in your home, you you
[44:08] want your home to be a certain way. You
[44:11] want your life to be a certain way. Uh
[44:15] and you want the church uh to be a
[44:17] certain way. and and so wi without that
[44:23] desire to go forward
[44:26] uh then you you can't just sit still,
[44:31] you know, because we're told that either
[44:33] you're going to leave better or worse.
[44:36] either you're going to uh get something
[44:39] from God and and and
[44:42] uh try to put that in your heart and
[44:45] live it with with all of your life or
[44:49] you're going to uh let that uh fall
[44:53] away. Isn't that right? Amen. So, if I
[44:57] would ask you this morning and I would
[44:59] say uh do you love the Lord? Well, uh,
[45:04] the English people would say yes, and
[45:06] the French people would say we, and the
[45:11] Spanish people would say see.
[45:15] Yes, we see.
[45:24] That's pretty good
[45:27] because that's what it's about. Yes, we
[45:31] see.
[45:33] You understand? We We see. We have a
[45:37] vision. We get it. We're We're catching
[45:41] hold of it. We understand
[45:44] what it is that we where we want to go,
[45:48] the path that we we want to go forward,
[45:51] the direction that we want to go in. So
[45:55] our our hearts now can be a flame. It's
[46:00] hard to be on fire for something you
[46:02] don't believe in. You know, it's hard to
[46:05] put your effort into something that
[46:07] you're not sure of.
[46:10] You know, and that's why Satan, one of
[46:12] the greatest things he likes to do is
[46:15] author confusion because confusion
[46:18] paralyzes you.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; You're not sure of the outcome. You're
[46:22] not sure of the result. Many people
[46:25] don't pray for the sick because they're
[46:27] not sure of the outcome.
[46:32] You you understand there are they're
[46:34] they're afraid that they won't get what
[46:37] they asked for that that that fear
[46:40] paralyzes them from doing it. But I like
[46:43] the way our messenger approached it. God
[46:46] said, "Lay your hands on the sick." So
[46:48] if I lay my hands on 500 people and they
[46:52] all die, I'm going to lay my hands on
[46:54] somebody else because that's what he
[46:58] said.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; And and and whatever his will is, that's
[47:03] what our heart's desire is. So, we're
[47:07] we're talking about when we talk about
[47:11] end time evangelism and we begin to uh
[47:16] uh talk about these, I I want to uh talk
[47:19] a little bit because we we begin to talk
[47:22] about um
[47:25] what direction that we want to go in as
[47:29] a body. Now, I hope that you feel you're
[47:32] a part of the body of believers. not
[47:36] just the local body but the body of
[47:38] Christ, the mystical body of Christ
[47:41] where he's the head of our body. So if
[47:46] he's the head of body and we're the body
[47:50] members in particular, each one of us
[47:53] having gifts and talents and and hearts
[47:57] desires and personalities,
[48:00] God made it that way. He he put it that
[48:03] way. And then by his spirit he fits and
[48:08] joins us together. Each need supplying
[48:12] to the other. So the body becomes
[48:16] something that that
[48:19] it does does a work without
[48:22] and it does a work within.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; You you you want you understand that you
[48:30] you feed your body, right? And you're
[48:33] there's a work going on within your
[48:35] body. It's taking the food you eat and
[48:37] it's turning it into glucose and it's
[48:40] putting it into your body and it's
[48:42] building cells and and you work and you
[48:46] build muscles and and uh and so that you
[48:50] have actually have an internal working
[48:53] of your body. You're drinking. You're
[48:55] eating, you're breathing, you're staying
[48:58] alive, and then your body
[49:00] does outside work. So, it's got inside
[49:04] work and outside work. And both of those
[49:08] works have to work together.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? Is
[49:16] that that you you've got to you've got
[49:21] to get u the inside working. If you if
[49:25] your inside's not working, we call that
[49:27] being sick, right? And when you're sick,
[49:30] it's hard to work when you're sick. So,
[49:34] if the inside's not working, the outside
[49:36] doesn't work too good. So, I think you
[49:39] understand what I'm saying. Now, I'm
[49:41] saying this pertaining to the body of
[49:44] believers. And we're just going to go a
[49:46] little down a little path this morning,
[49:49] if you'll go there with me. Now, this is
[49:51] what the prophet of God said.
[49:54] He says we we have no denomination.
[49:59] So we don't belong to any denomination.
[50:05] We don't have state prespators. We don't
[50:07] have overseers. We don't have a pope.
[50:11] You you understand? We we we're a
[50:14] sovereign body. Just like you're a
[50:17] sovereign individual, we're a sovereign
[50:20] body. So we're not connected to any
[50:24] group that we have to believe a certain
[50:27] way or we have certain qualifications.
[50:30] Now many of you may not realize this but
[50:34] you know
[50:35] how I'll just throw this in there. I
[50:37] just feel to but you know how
[50:40] denominations
[50:41] work like within the assemblies of God.
[50:45] If we were to join the assemblies of God
[50:47] we would be a franchise.
[50:52] And we would pay the assembly of God to
[50:56] use their name, Assembly of God.
[51:00] And then we would we would pay a
[51:03] franchise fee
[51:05] for being a part of that group. Now, I
[51:10] know that seems strange to you, but it's
[51:13] it's spiritual McDonald's.
[51:19] They all got the same menu,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; right? They all got the same name.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you can own that McDonald's, but
[51:29] you pay for that franchise. You're a
[51:33] part of that. Now, we're not part of
[51:37] anything that we franchise to.
[51:40] First of all, we got to realize we're a
[51:42] local assembly. We're a local body. So
[51:47] the way we operate is the way we choose
[51:51] to operate. I didn't say the way I
[51:54] choose to operate, the way we choose to
[51:58] operate. And this is how our messenger
[52:02] explains it. He says, he says, "We're no
[52:05] denomination. We're just gathered. We
[52:09] just gather."
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And really, that's what we do.
[52:15] We just gather.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; We just gather. The people that believe
[52:20] in God greater
[52:23] gather together to worship the Lord
[52:27] together
[52:29] to offer our prayers to God to make our
[52:34] confessions to him. And each Sunday and
[52:38] each day we go through a purgatory
[52:43] that is po
[52:46] pouring puring our souls by his holy
[52:51] spirit from our sins trying to live as
[52:56] godly as we know in this present age
[53:01] looking for his appearing at any time.
[53:05] for we are looking for that at any time.
[53:10] Now, I want you to hold that thought
[53:13] there uh just a moment a as he begins to
[53:18] explain what what we are. We're looking
[53:21] for that appearing. So, we have gathered
[53:25] here together. This isn't a career
[53:28] seminar,
[53:31] you know what I mean? We're not teaching
[53:33] ways to make more money, right? But
[53:36] we're we're we're here to prepare for
[53:41] his soon coming.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; His soon coming and and so that that
[53:49] plays an important part of that. So, I'm
[53:54] just going to read the little statements
[53:56] and and make comments on them and
[54:01] and and so and he says this. He says the
[54:05] same thing today.
[54:07] When you see his work,
[54:11] we see
[54:13] we see
[54:17] we
[54:21] right.
[54:23] We see. Yes. We see
[54:30] when we see his work,
[54:34] right?
[54:36] when you see his work. Now, we have
[54:40] already seen and witnessed the appearing
[54:43] of the Lord. Now, remember, appearing
[54:46] and coming are two different words. The
[54:49] appearing and then to come.
[54:52] Now is the appearing. He's already
[54:55] appeared in these last days, right here
[54:57] with us in the last few years. Now, it's
[55:02] a sign of his coming.
[55:05] He's appearing in his church in the form
[55:09] of the Holy Spirit, showing that that
[55:13] it's him because people cannot do these
[55:18] things that you see the you see the Holy
[55:23] Spirit doing. So, that's the appearing
[55:26] of the Lord. Now remember I it spoke in
[55:29] both places appearing and coming. So we
[55:33] know the Lord's appeared in our day or
[55:36] as we would say he's came in our day. Is
[55:40] that right? As Gentiles we see that the
[55:43] Gentiles never had the signs and
[55:45] wonders. They never had the things that
[55:48] that the Jews saw.
[55:51] But now the Gentiles
[55:55] saw that demonstrated
[55:57] also. So now God can judge them both
[56:01] equally because they both equally have
[56:03] seen. So we know the Lord Jesus appeared
[56:07] or we would say he came in this day.
[56:10] Jesus came. He took a prophetic ministry
[56:14] &gt;&gt; and he veiled himself in that body. So
[56:20] we saw William Brham the man, but yet it
[56:25] was the Lord Jesus who was in that man
[56:28] doing the work,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, we see.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We see that.
[56:43] You understand? It's been revealed to
[56:46] us.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; We know that. Now, it it's hard to go
[56:50] forward sometimes if you don't see
[56:53] things.
[56:56] You know, it's like your your your your
[56:59] children, they may not see that. So,
[57:01] they come to church for you
[57:05] &gt;&gt; because they don't want the
[57:07] consequences,
[57:10] &gt;&gt; right? So, we make you go to church. My
[57:15] children, we made them go to church.
[57:18] And sometimes they would sit on the back
[57:21] row staring at the ceiling. You know
[57:23] what I mean? But we made them go to
[57:25] church because we had a promise that if
[57:28] we raised them up in the way that they
[57:32] were to go that that they would come to
[57:36] the knowledge of the truth. And then by
[57:39] grace and by the mercy of the Lord, they
[57:42] each came to the place where they saw it
[57:45] for themselves.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; They saw it. I see it. I see it. I
[57:53] recognize it. I I understand it. It's
[57:56] been open to me. And And so that that's
[58:00] so we see those things. And and so he
[58:04] said
[58:05] so he upgraded them for the hardness of
[58:08] their heart because they didn't believe
[58:09] those things
[58:11] believed those who had seen it. I
[58:15] believe to do the same thing today that
[58:19] they didn't believe the testimony of
[58:21] those people and he upgraded them for it
[58:25] and then he commissioned them to go into
[58:28] the world and preach the gospel to every
[58:30] creature and he would be with them
[58:35] to the consummation of the end of the
[58:38] world and these signs shall follow. So
[58:42] he commissioned
[58:45] those that saw,
[58:50] those that believed. He gave them a
[58:54] commission. The scripture refers to it
[58:57] in some places as a reasonable service.
[59:01] This is if you see it and then you
[59:05] you're obligated to tell somebody
[59:09] because it was freely given to you. So
[59:13] freely give
[59:16] &gt;&gt; and and you know so
[59:20] we know that God's done something.
[59:23] We know that God's
[59:25] moving. We know that he's alive. We know
[59:29] that he's resurrected. We know that he's
[59:33] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:37] But we don't want to be paralyzed.
[59:41] You understand? We we just don't want to
[59:44] to know it as a form of intellect.
[59:50] But he that's why he took it from
[59:54] just being the trans um
[59:58] the transferring of knowledge
[1:00:02] into something of a a greater work.
[1:00:06] So it just wasn't the transfer of
[1:00:08] knowledge that I've come. He says, "No,
[1:00:12] I'm going to give you something
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:17] makes the word of God alive and real,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; that shows and proves that we're not
[1:00:27] looking back at history 2,000 years ago.
[1:00:31] We're not saying that Jesus Christ rose
[1:00:34] from the dead. We're saying he's here."
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:41] He's here and he's the same.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. He's here to do the same signs and
[1:00:53] wonders. If we believe that, then those
[1:00:57] signs will follow them that believe.
[1:01:04] So if if I get a devil on me.
[1:01:11] Well, none of you have ever had a devil
[1:01:13] on you. Oh, I'm sitting in the heavenly
[1:01:16] places this morning in Christ Jesus. No.
[1:01:20] The devil's like a roaring lion, right?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He's like a a a a a
[1:01:27] tiger or a lion. You know how they set
[1:01:30] their claws in you and they just hold on
[1:01:33] to you and and I I've I've watched the
[1:01:37] films and and and nature of of the lion
[1:01:42] grabbing a hold or the or the hyena and
[1:01:46] and they just hold on and hold on until
[1:01:49] you just don't have any strength and
[1:01:53] they try to bring you down. Well, I've
[1:01:56] had the devil bite on me.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I've had him sink those old teeth into
[1:02:02] me. Just try to drag me down and get me
[1:02:05] so weary that you just don't want to go
[1:02:08] forward.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; But
[1:02:13] we can cast those devils off.
[1:02:16] Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; We can shake those spirits off of
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; If we believe
[1:02:26] and we have faith,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; we can cast those spirits out.
[1:02:32] We get sick sometimes. I want to thank
[1:02:35] the brothers. My ankle. I was just
[1:02:37] getting to where I could hardly walk and
[1:02:40] and the brothers prayed for me and the
[1:02:42] Lord, he he really touched me, you know.
[1:02:45] The next day I I was I was so much
[1:02:48] better. It was You knew it was the Lord.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; We we we we see.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Yes. We see we see
[1:03:01] that that's a reality to us.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we we we we
[1:03:11] come together
[1:03:14] on the the power of the resurrection.
[1:03:18] Now, this is go I'm just going through
[1:03:20] this because if you just bear with me
[1:03:23] this morning, he says, he says, "Today
[1:03:27] we try to take the written word,
[1:03:30] we have in letter form, creed form, and
[1:03:34] so forth to all the world."
[1:03:38] Okay? So, he says that's what we do. We
[1:03:41] have the Bible, right? So we try to take
[1:03:45] the Bible and say this is the word of
[1:03:47] God. We know that God sent a prophet in
[1:03:52] Malachi 4:5. So we we we we try to take
[1:03:57] the scripture and say according to the
[1:04:01] scripture, God was to send a prophet in
[1:04:05] Malachi 4:5. We know according to the
[1:04:08] scripture, God was to open the seals.
[1:04:13] Right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Right. In Revelations 10 that we are
[1:04:17] going to have an understanding of what
[1:04:19] the seals were, what the horse riders,
[1:04:22] that's something that he promised.
[1:04:25] Okay. Now, you can you you can't take
[1:04:27] that
[1:04:29] to people
[1:04:31] without you having a life
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; that identifies that you've seen it.
[1:04:40] That's right.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; How can you say I believe that the
[1:04:44] prophet, great prophet was sent before
[1:04:46] the great and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:04:49] before his coming
[1:04:52] and then we don't live like he's coming.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? So there there
[1:05:02] there's there not only is it working
[1:05:05] within but it's it's working without.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; So there's there there becomes now we're
[1:05:12] talking about evangelism.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the commission.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. How does it work?
[1:05:22] What what method did God set in place
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; for the church to carry out his
[1:05:32] commission
[1:05:35] because we're all ordered.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; As our messenger said, if you're
[1:05:40] convinced, you're concerned.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; So there there's a way to approach it.
[1:05:46] There's an understanding we have. And I
[1:05:49] hope as I read these things to you, they
[1:05:52] unfold a little bit to you and you can
[1:05:55] place yourself in the body.
[1:06:00] You've got to realize, you've got to
[1:06:02] place yourself in the body because in
[1:06:07] order to evangelize,
[1:06:11] not only are you bringing the word
[1:06:14] out to the world, but the word has to be
[1:06:19] working in the body. Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, if we don't care one for
[1:06:28] another,
[1:06:31] if we're not praying for our own sick,
[1:06:36] right? If we're not visiting the widow
[1:06:39] and the fatherless,
[1:06:41] if we're not doing the works
[1:06:45] within the body, if the body's not
[1:06:48] working
[1:06:50] together
[1:06:51] and it's not fitted and joined together,
[1:06:56] then the outsider can't see the
[1:07:00] manifestation
[1:07:02] of the word of God.
[1:07:06] You understand? Because he didn't say,
[1:07:08] "I'm going to read it, but I'm just
[1:07:10] explaining what I'm going to read." He
[1:07:12] didn't say, "Go give it out in letter
[1:07:15] form."
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Go out and teach it."
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Preach it."
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Because God's word is preached by
[1:07:29] manifestation.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Let's just read it. these uh this is I'm
[1:07:36] just reading out of end time evangelism.
[1:07:39] He said
[1:07:40] he says but Jesus said go and preach the
[1:07:43] gospel. He never said teach the word. He
[1:07:48] said preach the gospel and the gospel
[1:07:51] came not in word only.
[1:07:56] So it comes in word
[1:08:00] okay but not in word only.
[1:08:10] So right
[1:08:13] so so preach the gospel came not in word
[1:08:16] only but through the manifestation
[1:08:19] of the word.
[1:08:22] For the only way that it could be done
[1:08:26] was to make his promise come to pass.
[1:08:33] Now, we're talking about end time
[1:08:35] evangelism.
[1:08:37] It doesn't do any good for us to preach
[1:08:40] the promise
[1:08:42] if the promises aren't coming to pass.
[1:08:48] But that's why he lets us know. Correct?
[1:08:52] Because it's by these great and
[1:08:56] exceedingly
[1:08:57] precious promises that we're partakers
[1:09:01] of the spirit and nature of God.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; God is with us. We know that God is with
[1:09:11] us when he's bringing his word
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; to pass.
[1:09:18] We know that we're a body of believers
[1:09:23] when we have care one for another, love
[1:09:26] one for another, we're doing the body
[1:09:29] work,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; taking care of one another,
[1:09:35] doing the works of the Lord within our
[1:09:38] own framework with our own body. We're
[1:09:42] all participating
[1:09:44] and applying the promises of God one to
[1:09:48] another. Then you go evangelize
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; and someone walks into your midst and
[1:09:56] they see that God's here.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Why is he here? Because the promises of
[1:10:03] God's word are coming to pass.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; The gospel is just not being preached.
[1:10:12] But there's a people
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; that are living what they're talking
[1:10:18] about.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; So the body
[1:10:28] so that it it's from without.
[1:10:32] So we're commissioned
[1:10:34] to go into all the world. Is that right?
[1:10:38] Yes.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Well, they had that problem in the first
[1:10:41] church.
[1:10:43] They all went out
[1:10:46] preaching and then they got there and
[1:10:49] the people began to complain
[1:10:52] because the widows weren't being fed,
[1:10:54] the fatherless, there was all kinds of
[1:10:57] problems and everything. And and and
[1:11:00] then the the the disciples said, "Well,
[1:11:05] we can't stop what we're doing.
[1:11:10] to to attend to these things.
[1:11:14] So he said you pick some men amongst you
[1:11:19] and you start attending to these
[1:11:23] situations.
[1:11:26] That was how the church birthed.
[1:11:29] Well, that's what we do.
[1:11:34] You know, I can preach the gospel, but
[1:11:36] you've got to take care of the body.
[1:11:41] You've got to look out after one
[1:11:44] another.
[1:11:47] I mean, you know, we have new people. We
[1:11:49] have people that are fresh in the
[1:11:51] message. We got different places. We
[1:11:54] attend one to another because some some
[1:11:56] of you elderly sisters, the scripture
[1:11:58] says you teach the younger women how to
[1:12:02] dress, how to conduct themselves, how to
[1:12:05] honor their husbands. If you see a
[1:12:08] sister that that it's got high heels,
[1:12:12] you know, I I don't have time to run out
[1:12:14] in the parking lot. I have with some.
[1:12:19] I have walked up and say, "Sister, may I
[1:12:21] talk to you?
[1:12:23] a little bit. You know, your heels are
[1:12:26] we we don't wear high heels or or maybe
[1:12:29] a dress is too tight or too short or
[1:12:32] maybe some brother's got, you know, long
[1:12:36] hair or whatever is is going on. Those
[1:12:39] are all ABC thing,
[1:12:42] but they're things we take care of
[1:12:44] amongst ourselves.
[1:12:48] You know, if you know somebody's got odd
[1:12:50] against somebody and e And so the body
[1:12:53] begins to to work within its own
[1:12:58] framework. In other words, it I believe
[1:13:01] the scripture I you know that first of
[1:13:05] all charity begins at the household of
[1:13:07] faith.
[1:13:11] So it come so it starts with me
[1:13:16] and then what's going on with me extends
[1:13:20] outward.
[1:13:22] And so, but it's it's the manifestation.
[1:13:26] In other words, if we just sit here
[1:13:28] because we believe that God sent a
[1:13:31] prophet, that's the letter.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Where's the manifestation
[1:13:38] of our faith?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Where's the proof that I believe what he
[1:13:47] said?
[1:13:50] Well, that has got to be brought forth
[1:13:54] because God manifests his word. That's
[1:13:58] what he does. He says, "For the only way
[1:14:01] it could be done was to make his
[1:14:03] promises come to pass."
[1:14:08] He says, "And the only way you can do
[1:14:11] that
[1:14:14] is not by a track.
[1:14:19] But by the Holy Spirit working through
[1:14:25] you,
[1:14:26] your life becomes his life. He is
[1:14:32] in you.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now this is how
[1:14:36] the beginning
[1:14:39] of evangelism.
[1:14:42] This was the beginning. He said, "You
[1:14:45] must be born again.
[1:14:49] You must be born again. There's got to
[1:14:53] be something that transpires
[1:14:57] within you as an individual that you
[1:15:01] possess.
[1:15:04] You can't belong."
[1:15:06] That's the strength of denominationalism
[1:15:10] is they they create a sense amongst the
[1:15:14] people that if you belong and you come
[1:15:18] here, you're good.
[1:15:23] And they come by the thousands
[1:15:26] and they feel that their strength and
[1:15:30] their comfort is in their numbers
[1:15:34] or in their agreeing one with another.
[1:15:39] And and it it's we're not here because
[1:15:43] we agree one with another. We're here
[1:15:47] because we want to worship,
[1:15:50] serve the Lord,
[1:15:53] purge ourselves,
[1:15:56] and prepare for his
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; coming.
[1:16:01] That's
[1:16:03] what we're here for. And we're here to
[1:16:07] minister
[1:16:09] one to another
[1:16:11] within the framework of our body.
[1:16:17] That when one of us is sick,
[1:16:21] we all are sick with him.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; When one of us grieavves, we all grieve
[1:16:28] with him. When one of us rejoices, we
[1:16:31] all rejoice with him.
[1:16:34] We're in it because they'll know that we
[1:16:37] are his disciples by our love one for
[1:16:41] another, our care one for another, our
[1:16:44] our mental acuity
[1:16:48] to the fact that we see and we recognize
[1:16:53] and understand that we're part of one
[1:16:57] another and part of a body.
[1:17:01] The scripture plainly states is that if
[1:17:04] you say you're not part of the body,
[1:17:06] then you're not part of the body.
[1:17:11] Now that's within your own selves
[1:17:15] that you that you that you see
[1:17:22] that you that you actually feel within
[1:17:27] the framework of your heart that I have
[1:17:30] a love and an understanding that I'm I
[1:17:34] want to take care of my brother.
[1:17:38] They're a part of me.
[1:17:41] I want them to make it.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I want to help them make it.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; I want to share their burdens, bear
[1:17:50] their burdens, bear their sufferings,
[1:17:53] pray with them. I when I I come to the
[1:17:57] household of faith, I'm not just
[1:17:59] fulfilling an obligation. I'm here to be
[1:18:03] of service
[1:18:05] to to those I'm sitting with.
[1:18:11] What can I do for you this morning? How
[1:18:15] can I help you, sister? Are you going
[1:18:17] through anything? What's your burdens?
[1:18:19] What's your trouble? You care one for
[1:18:22] another.
[1:18:24] you when
[1:18:27] somebody that doesn't have that in their
[1:18:30] life
[1:18:32] and you go out into the world because
[1:18:35] we're talking about evangelism
[1:18:38] and you introduce somebody to this
[1:18:40] message,
[1:18:42] you tell them what God's done in this
[1:18:44] last day and we'll get to this in a
[1:18:46] moment. And then they could come into
[1:18:50] the confines
[1:18:52] of a body
[1:18:54] and find out there's a people there that
[1:18:57] believe this.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; They believe in the coming of the Lord.
[1:19:03] They believe in that in laying hands on
[1:19:07] the sick. They believe on being born
[1:19:09] again. They they believe those things.
[1:19:11] They're living those things. They're
[1:19:13] practicing those things. the it it's
[1:19:17] it's when their eyes are open to that
[1:19:21] then they know that God is with you
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; and he's alive in your midst.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; But what happens if someone you you you
[1:19:34] preach the great story and they come in
[1:19:37] and and you're backbiting.
[1:19:42] There's people hungry.
[1:19:47] Nobody has a burden for
[1:19:50] anybody.
[1:19:52] You hear somebody's out of work and you
[1:19:55] don't pray that they get a job or you
[1:19:57] don't offer any help or the in other
[1:20:02] word
[1:20:03] it it doesn't do any good if it just
[1:20:07] remains in theory.
[1:20:12] Okay. And in teaching, the teaching's
[1:20:15] true,
[1:20:17] but it didn't come.
[1:20:20] I am the way,
[1:20:24] the truth,
[1:20:26] and the life.
[1:20:30] So, we know that this is the way.
[1:20:38] We know the message for the hour is the
[1:20:40] way.
[1:20:42] We know it's the truth. But now we've
[1:20:45] got to connect the life
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; not only in our individual life but in
[1:20:53] our body church life.
[1:20:58] And there it's easy to come to church
[1:21:00] because you believe in the message.
[1:21:05] Brother Random said, "Come to church on
[1:21:07] Sunday. This is a message church. I'm
[1:21:11] coming to this church. I'm going to sit
[1:21:13] here. I'm going to take care of my
[1:21:16] Sunday duty."
[1:21:19] That's a creed.
[1:21:23] And I'm going to leave
[1:21:26] and I'll be back next Sunday morning to
[1:21:30] fulfill.
[1:21:32] Well, I hate to say it,
[1:21:36] but that's you're a part of a a a dogma.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You're a part of a creed. You're
[1:21:45] fulfilling an ordinance.
[1:21:47] You're fulfilling a moral code.
[1:21:52] I don't believe that's what the
[1:21:54] messenger was desiring from the church.
[1:22:00] He wants every individual in here to be
[1:22:04] empowered
[1:22:05] with the power of the resurrection.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Silver and gold have I none. But that
[1:22:12] which I have, I give. Freely I've been
[1:22:16] given. Freely I receive. Freely I give.
[1:22:21] I don't come here to fulfill the
[1:22:23] obligation. I come here because I'm
[1:22:26] looking for the coming of the Lord.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And I want to serve God's people.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; The love of God is shed abroad in my
[1:22:36] heart by the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I love and I care. I've entered into the
[1:22:46] capstone of the believer.
[1:22:50] Now this is this is a life
[1:22:54] that you can possess.
[1:22:58] Let's go further if if you would bear
[1:23:02] with me.
[1:23:04] He says, "So it's not passing out a
[1:23:06] track. It it's the Holy Spirit working
[1:23:11] through you. Your life becomes his life.
[1:23:15] He is in you." Now, that was the
[1:23:19] foundation
[1:23:22] for
[1:23:23] evangelism
[1:23:26] because the scripture said, "You must be
[1:23:29] born again."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And the guy says, "Well, how can I
[1:23:35] reenter into my mother's womb?" And
[1:23:37] Jesus says, "Look at the spirit. Look at
[1:23:39] the wind."
[1:23:42] In other words, you were born with the
[1:23:44] nature.
[1:23:47] You were born in sin,
[1:23:50] shaped into the iniquity, came into the
[1:23:54] world speaking lies.
[1:23:56] Blame your mom and dad
[1:24:00] for that.
[1:24:05] And they can blame their mom and dad and
[1:24:07] they can blame their mom and dad and
[1:24:08] they can blame and it'll go all the way
[1:24:10] back to the Garden of Eden.
[1:24:16] We left God.
[1:24:20] Mankind left God.
[1:24:25] And once they left God, they no longer
[1:24:28] had his nature and his spirit because
[1:24:33] that we came into the world through an
[1:24:36] act of sin.
[1:24:38] Now God
[1:24:40] through marriage
[1:24:44] gave a place where that act was
[1:24:47] sanctified
[1:24:48] and it was holy and it could bring forth
[1:24:53] children and men could live
[1:24:57] fulfilling the desire of his flesh, the
[1:25:00] need for companionship
[1:25:03] and he could go forward in life.
[1:25:09] Man makes lots of mistakes,
[1:25:12] but God provides grace and mercy and
[1:25:16] forgiveness.
[1:25:18] And when a man goes one way, all he can
[1:25:22] do is come back,
[1:25:27] repent of his sins,
[1:25:30] and start a fresh. Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; It's all you can do
[1:25:36] is start a fresh
[1:25:38] believing that if you confess your sins,
[1:25:41] he's faithful and just to forgive them
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; and to throw them into the sea of God's
[1:25:46] forgetfulness to be remembered no more.
[1:25:49] Don't you remember them? You go on. Even
[1:25:53] in marriage and divorce, he said, "You
[1:25:54] go on the way that you are. Go forward.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Do the best you can.
[1:26:02] It's all you can do.
[1:26:06] But let's understand where it comes from
[1:26:11] and what the church is based on and
[1:26:16] what's it mean
[1:26:19] when we say born again.
[1:26:34] He said the heathens when they worshiped
[1:26:37] the idol, they prostrate themselves
[1:26:40] before the idol and believe that that
[1:26:45] idol talks back to them.
[1:26:49] that God, their God turned, comes into
[1:26:54] this idol
[1:26:56] and spoke back through them.
[1:27:00] Now, that's what they believe.
[1:27:02] That's what a heathen believes.
[1:27:05] They put the idol there. Now, they
[1:27:08] believe that God comes into the idol and
[1:27:12] speaks to them through the idol. Pretty
[1:27:15] close.
[1:27:21] You know,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; at least they believe God's speaking to
[1:27:24] them.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just stay if we could.
[1:27:34] Now, that's just contrary turned around
[1:27:38] what God is.
[1:27:42] Listen, God doesn't deal with idols.
[1:27:46] You are his instrument.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; You prostrate yourself
[1:27:59] before God
[1:28:02] and he comes in you and speaks out to
[1:28:08] the people. That's the difference. He's
[1:28:12] the living God
[1:28:15] for a living person, not a dead God to a
[1:28:20] dead idol. He's a living God to a living
[1:28:25] being. You become his witness.
[1:28:31] What he said is what he said here. We're
[1:28:37] talking about the beginning
[1:28:40] of evangelism
[1:28:44] is you become his instrument.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; You lay yourself
[1:28:53] prostrate before God.
[1:28:58] Now, we can't circumvent
[1:29:03] what God
[1:29:06] program is.
[1:29:08] He said, "Repent."
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:29:17] Repent.
[1:29:20] That that was that began. Men and
[1:29:23] brethren, what must we do?
[1:29:26] Repent
[1:29:28] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:32] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:29:36] gift of the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:29:44] I I I'll just leave what I want to say
[1:29:47] maybe for another time.
[1:29:50] He said
[1:29:53] that. Notice many people say that was
[1:29:58] just for the apostles.
[1:30:04] He said, "Go into all the world and
[1:30:06] preach this gospel to every creature."
[1:30:09] Conjunction. These signs shall follow
[1:30:12] them that believe. It's not a moral
[1:30:15] code.
[1:30:19] It's an experience
[1:30:22] that you've had
[1:30:24] that you're sharing with somebody else.
[1:30:38] until you've repented,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; till you know what it's like
[1:30:46] to say that you're sorry,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; to recognize.
[1:30:52] You can't ask somebody else to recognize
[1:30:55] their sins,
[1:30:58] recognize their faults,
[1:31:01] recognize their shortcomings if you've
[1:31:04] never recognized your own.
[1:31:10] If you don't, if you can't identify,
[1:31:14] I know what it's like to be a sinner.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I know what you're going through. I know
[1:31:20] what it feels like to be lost.
[1:31:26] I know the pressure
[1:31:29] that you're under.
[1:31:32] I know that Satan talks to your mind.
[1:31:39] But I've got something.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; It's not something I know about.
[1:31:48] It's something that I went through the
[1:31:51] process and I got the results.
[1:31:58] I followed the recipe
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and I got the cake
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; and it was everything that he said it
[1:32:05] would be.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm offering to you.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Life,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; joy,
[1:32:18] peace.
[1:32:20] These things are real.
[1:32:23] These are things that a a believer
[1:32:28] he a believer has because he's
[1:32:34] he he's he's moved upon
[1:32:38] by it and that and that's what
[1:32:41] that that's what the the believers built
[1:32:45] on. Now listen to this.
[1:32:49] Very close.
[1:32:53] The Christian knows it's the coming of
[1:32:56] the Lord.
[1:32:59] There's an atmosphere.
[1:33:03] It depends on what you're looking at.
[1:33:06] For the Lord has strictly told us just
[1:33:10] what was going to happen at the time.
[1:33:14] And we don't know the minute or the
[1:33:16] hour, but we know we are nearing it
[1:33:20] somehow. Now
[1:33:25] we're we're looking for the coming of
[1:33:28] the Lord.
[1:33:31] That is the joy of the believer.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; May I read a little more?
[1:33:48] So, we know the world's under pressure.
[1:33:51] How many knows it's under pressure?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's
[1:33:58] I mean, you got to turn turn off the
[1:34:01] news, the radio, all they want to talk
[1:34:03] about is division and demons and this
[1:34:06] group hates this and democracy. They're
[1:34:10] they're not going to save democracy.
[1:34:15] They're not going to save America.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, in case somebody's
[1:34:22] watching me on YouTube or something, but
[1:34:28] I've been cancelled enough that I I
[1:34:30] don't think there's no more places left
[1:34:32] to put a stamp.
[1:34:36] There's no hope.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[1:34:43] There's only one hope
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; and that's the coming of the Lord
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; there's only one peace
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; that's to be found
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; out of this confusion out of this mess
[1:35:01] out of this financial trouble and that's
[1:35:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. He's the way out.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And you
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; as an individual
[1:35:15] have found the way out.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You have found your way to peace.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You have found your way to joy. Even if
[1:35:28] you lose a loved one,
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; you know that there's coming a time
[1:35:33] where you'll be reunited in the Lord.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You're you're not anchored here.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Your life ain't here.
[1:35:55] We're not of this world.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; This isn't the greatest economy ever.
[1:36:08] God is the greatest economy ever.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; The money in the bank ain't going to
[1:36:18] save you. The bank will close.
[1:36:23] There's no rest. That's why the world's
[1:36:26] under so much pressure.
[1:36:30] That's why they get so infuriated
[1:36:34] with the way somebody thinks that they
[1:36:37] lash out, they speak out, they speak
[1:36:39] hatred, they they speak all those
[1:36:42] things. I I'm not going to get into that
[1:36:44] battle.
[1:36:47] I have another place of refuge.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; It's the rock of ages.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It's the cliff of the rock.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. We see.
[1:37:05] We see that
[1:37:08] young people
[1:37:11] the joy of the Lord
[1:37:14] is when you see for yourself that Jesus
[1:37:19] loves you.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; That he knows the battles you go
[1:37:23] through. He knows the mind battles. He
[1:37:25] knows that Satan is working against you.
[1:37:29] And if you could find that place
[1:37:32] where you get alone with him
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and you just talk to him,
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; you will know and feel
[1:37:43] his presence
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; come around you and speak to you and
[1:37:49] say, "I've got you.
[1:37:52] I have you in the palm of my hand
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; and nothing will pluck you out.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Lo, I am with you always,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; even in you till the end.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But it's only when you desire that
[1:38:12] peace.
[1:38:14] It's only when you you can look out and
[1:38:17] you can see this world and you don't see
[1:38:20] a future in it. You know why you don't
[1:38:23] see a future in it? There's no future in
[1:38:25] it.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I'm 75 years old. I guess according to
[1:38:34] if if we live a real modest life, uh we
[1:38:38] can live on our social security and what
[1:38:41] little bit we've got saved up
[1:38:45] and I can live till I die.
[1:38:50] Wow,
[1:38:52] what a life.
[1:38:54] Deary, we can go to Cracker Barrel
[1:38:58] a couple times a week and we can have
[1:39:02] coffee at McDonald's and and maybe you
[1:39:05] could get a burrito and I could get a a
[1:39:08] sausage McMuffin
[1:39:12] and then we could go home
[1:39:15] and you can tinker in the garden and I
[1:39:18] can tinker in the garage and
[1:39:22] and we can sit around till we Hi.
[1:39:27] Hallelujah.
[1:39:30] Uhuh. I'm looking for the coming of the
[1:39:33] Lord.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Grave, where's your victory? Death,
[1:39:41] wears your sting.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; I've ran a race. I've fought a fight.
[1:39:46] I'm going for a crown.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I I I I I've experienced
[1:39:54] him
[1:39:56] coming to to me
[1:39:58] in a very dark valley
[1:40:04] when I was on the edge of
[1:40:07] of of ending my life,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; trapped in drugs, trapped with demons,
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; trapped in in in
[1:40:18] an incredibly
[1:40:20] lost
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; place.
[1:40:24] No vision, no life, no future, no
[1:40:26] nothing. And he came.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And he told me, I'm the life.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I am the way out.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe it.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I am the way out of these things. Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ is the way out.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; It was those people
[1:40:49] that found that way out.
[1:40:52] They had that personal experience.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; That was who he used to evangelize.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the doctrine that evangelized.
[1:41:07] It wasn't the teachings that
[1:41:09] evangelized. It wasn't the church that
[1:41:12] evangelized. It was the experience
[1:41:16] that evangelized.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:22] When you realize
[1:41:24] what you really are
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and you see that he loved you anyway and
[1:41:31] you see it,
[1:41:33] you know it, it becomes a reality to
[1:41:37] you. That's what you share.
[1:41:45] You can't even begin to share
[1:41:49] Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. You might as
[1:41:53] well just share George Washington
[1:41:57] because it's both true history.
[1:42:00] But this is something that's real.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; We see it. Yes, we see.
[1:42:09] We know that's real.
[1:42:12] No matter what trials come, we know it's
[1:42:15] real.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But there's there's there is a way out.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] That's Christ.
[1:42:28] Now, the Christian should not be in that
[1:42:32] condition.
[1:42:33] In other words, worried and stressed
[1:42:35] out,
[1:42:38] wondering about the future.
[1:42:40] He should not be in that condition. We
[1:42:44] should be happy
[1:42:46] waiting for the coming
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; for it's close.
[1:42:54] That's our hope.
[1:42:57] That's our joy.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's our victory.
[1:43:07] I don't need to get my truck paid off.
[1:43:10] my house paid off. I need to make the
[1:43:12] rapture.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I don't need to have a lot of money in
[1:43:17] the bank. I need to know beyond a shadow
[1:43:21] of a doubt that the Jesus I met will
[1:43:25] take care of every single one of my
[1:43:29] needs. I'm not worried.
[1:43:33] I'm happy that he loves me.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I'm happy that I have met him. I know
[1:43:40] he's real. I've experienced his
[1:43:43] forgiveness. I've experienced his touch.
[1:43:47] That's what we're trying to get to each
[1:43:49] individual. It's not it doesn't it it
[1:43:52] comes with emotion.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; But that emotion is built on a
[1:43:59] forgiveness,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; on a meeting,
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; on a revelation.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that I'm in the palm of his
[1:44:06] hand and nothing can pluck me out.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; And if he started a work in me, he'll
[1:44:14] finish it till the end. That's what we
[1:44:16] want. We just don't want you to feel
[1:44:18] something. We want you to know
[1:44:20] something.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And if that knowledge brings you to a
[1:44:26] feeling, hallelujah.
[1:44:34] But we should all know it.
[1:44:39] Listen to what it is.
[1:44:42] To the church.
[1:44:45] We should be happy waiting for his
[1:44:48] coming for its close. We can feel the
[1:44:53] cool breeze
[1:44:55] of Calvary.
[1:44:59] My sins are forgiven.
[1:45:03] That's not laid to my charge.
[1:45:06] I make mistakes,
[1:45:09] but if I confess him, he's faithful and
[1:45:12] just to forgive him.
[1:45:15] I know I'm his.
[1:45:17] I know he died for me.
[1:45:21] I know he won't leave me nor forsake me.
[1:45:24] It's a personal relationship with the
[1:45:28] Lord Jesus.
[1:45:31] It doesn't matter how that is expressed
[1:45:34] in somebody else.
[1:45:39] Some may shout, "Praise God."
[1:45:44] Some may cry,
[1:45:46] praise God.
[1:45:48] Like Paul was sharing with us the other
[1:45:50] day, when they rebuilt the temple
[1:45:54] and they brought the books out and they
[1:45:57] begin to read them to Israel for the
[1:46:00] first time.
[1:46:06] The people that
[1:46:08] were just seeing it
[1:46:11] for the first time, they shouted
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; with praise.
[1:46:19] And the oldtimers
[1:46:23] that had seen its destruction,
[1:46:28] they wept.
[1:46:33] Here you got all the old-timers weeping
[1:46:38] because they seen what God's done.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Here's the people that never seen it
[1:46:43] before, seeing it for the first time.
[1:46:46] and they're shouting.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that those are
[1:46:50] far off, they were they didn't know what
[1:46:53] was going on. They were confused because
[1:46:55] half the people were crying and half the
[1:46:58] people were shouting.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care shout or weep,
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; but see
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; that was the point.
[1:47:15] know
[1:47:17] that he's forgiven you,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; that he'll love you.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; The best,
[1:47:26] what do they best match maker
[1:47:29] in the world is Jesus Christ.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He'll find somebody for you.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; And if he finds somebody for you and you
[1:47:41] don't like them, God will fix it.
[1:47:46] Hallelujah.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; He'll either change you or change them.
[1:47:52] But if God's in it, God's going to do
[1:47:54] it.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry.
[1:48:00] I don't care what's behind you.
[1:48:03] You can't live with your mistakes
[1:48:05] forever. You've got to let them go and
[1:48:10] know that he'll take you from where that
[1:48:14] you are.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what we just said.
[1:48:20] He says,
[1:48:24] "And when we and when we look down and
[1:48:28] see the God of heaven who made the
[1:48:31] promise and the when we see
[1:48:39] When we look down, when we see
[1:48:43] the God of heaven who made the promise
[1:48:46] and the very things that Jesus did in
[1:48:50] his life,
[1:48:52] promised would return in the last days.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And here we
[1:48:59] see it.
[1:49:05] We see it.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? It's not. The church
[1:49:09] is built on revelation.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; It's built on men and women and young
[1:49:16] ladies and young men who see it.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; They see the coming of the Lord. They
[1:49:24] see the destruction of the world. They
[1:49:26] see the gift at Calvary. How do you see?
[1:49:31] You get Isab.
[1:49:34] He lets you see it,
[1:49:38] but you see it. You know it. You've met
[1:49:41] him. He says the promise of his return
[1:49:45] in the last day. What is that?
[1:49:51] You see it?
[1:49:54] You It's paragraph 46 out of end time
[1:49:58] evangel. I don't are things not working
[1:50:00] right. I know mine was all
[1:50:05] but it says what is that?
[1:50:11] When we see his return in the last days,
[1:50:15] we see it in his word. What is that?
[1:50:19] That's the breath
[1:50:22] of the refreshing
[1:50:24] like the rain coming.
[1:50:27] We know redemption is nigh. See,
[1:50:32] something is fixing to take place. And
[1:50:35] the world doesn't see that. They laugh
[1:50:40] at it because they did it in other days.
[1:50:45] But we know that it's coming near.
[1:50:54] And that's the reason I chose the
[1:50:57] subject today
[1:51:00] for the last for a while the tabernacle
[1:51:02] of end time evangel.
[1:51:04] And when we are doing missionary work
[1:51:08] or foreign missions with the word of
[1:51:12] God, we know we're always in the will of
[1:51:15] God because Jesus commissioned his
[1:51:18] children was to go into all the world
[1:51:21] and preach the gospel. Freely it was
[1:51:25] given freely give. Is that correct?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Now so what are we talking about? We're
[1:51:33] talking about end time evangelism. End
[1:51:35] time evangelism begins with the
[1:51:39] individual
[1:51:41] coming to the knowledge and seeing that
[1:51:44] Jesus Christ paid their price for them
[1:51:48] and their sins are forgiven.
[1:51:51] That the nature that caused them to sin
[1:51:57] is no longer laid to their charge.
[1:52:04] Something made you sin.
[1:52:08] Is that right?
[1:52:11] It was a nature
[1:52:14] that you got.
[1:52:16] You were born with it.
[1:52:19] You were born in unbelief.
[1:52:24] You were born in sin. You came into the
[1:52:28] world speaking lies.
[1:52:30] that that that that
[1:52:33] was where you're at.
[1:52:36] And the wages of that
[1:52:39] is death,
[1:52:43] right? But now the Lord comes,
[1:52:48] he dies on Calvary, he pays the price
[1:52:51] for that sin,
[1:52:54] and he gives you the gift of eternal
[1:52:57] life.
[1:52:58] Will you die? Oh, this body will die.
[1:53:03] But we're not worried about the first
[1:53:05] death. We're worried about the second
[1:53:08] death. Eternal separation from God. So,
[1:53:12] we know that he desire it. We see it. He
[1:53:15] reveals that to us. It becomes real to
[1:53:18] us. We understand that he's forgiven us
[1:53:20] of our sins. And we stay there.
[1:53:26] We lay ourselves prostrate and we die to
[1:53:31] that nature.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Until his spirit
[1:53:38] comes in us. Will Satan try to resurrect
[1:53:41] that nature? Yes. That's a battle.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; We're in that battle. Do we stumble
[1:53:50] sometimes? Yes. But we know we can
[1:53:53] repent and he's faithful and just to
[1:53:56] forgive us and we return back. So we
[1:53:59] know that what it is we see his spirit
[1:54:03] working.
[1:54:08] And so he says he says now he says you
[1:54:12] must be born again. Let me read this
[1:54:15] again. In order to be born again, it's
[1:54:19] letting yourself go
[1:54:22] and die.
[1:54:24] And the spirit of Christ comes in you.
[1:54:29] Then you're no more yours.
[1:54:33] It's Christ in you. See, the Holy
[1:54:36] Spirit, Paul said, "I die daily yet I
[1:54:41] live. Not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[1:54:47] See Christ. I tell you, I'm a Christian
[1:54:52] and the spirit of Christ is in me or in
[1:54:56] you, then we do the works of Christ.
[1:55:01] Jesus said in John, he that believeth on
[1:55:04] me, the works that I do shall he do
[1:55:08] also. Then he said here, "These signs
[1:55:12] shall follow them that believe."
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; So where does it start?
[1:55:23] It starts with the spirit of God
[1:55:26] convicting you of sin.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; You can't get around that.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit does. He
[1:55:36] convicts you of sin.
[1:55:39] You're living your life. You're happy.
[1:55:41] You're good. I was happy. I had long
[1:55:43] hair. I was hanging out with all kinds
[1:55:46] of real famous rock musicians, you know?
[1:55:49] I had a big old blunt, you know what I
[1:55:52] mean? And man,
[1:55:54] I was happy.
[1:55:58] I was what we used to call righteous
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; and cool.
[1:56:05] And then something interrupted my life.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; I didn't want it to interrupt my life.
[1:56:17] I mean,
[1:56:21] it started interrupting my life. It
[1:56:24] started convicting me.
[1:56:28] And the more it convicted me, the more I
[1:56:31] tried to smoke it away
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; or drink it away
[1:56:36] or play enough music to make it go away.
[1:56:44] You know, if he start bugging you, what
[1:56:46] do you do? You run to the cooler, you
[1:56:48] get a six-pack, and if that six-pack
[1:56:51] won't do it, you buy a 12-pack. If the
[1:56:53] 12-pack won't do it, you get a 24p pack.
[1:56:56] If a bottle of wine won't do it, you get
[1:56:58] a gallon of wine.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; You're trying to find anything. Make
[1:57:03] this conviction go away.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what that conviction's
[1:57:09] doing? It's trying to kill you.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; It's trying to make you
[1:57:19] to the place you don't want to be what
[1:57:23] you are.
[1:57:24] I don't want to be this way no more. I
[1:57:27] don't want to feel this way no more.
[1:57:29] This is ugly.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; What is it? is the conviction
[1:57:38] trying to bring you to the place
[1:57:43] that you lay prostrate
[1:57:47] before the Lord
[1:57:50] and you let yourself go
[1:57:53] and he comes in.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother McGary, I want the
[1:58:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit." There is no
[1:58:03] baptism of the Holy Spirit without
[1:58:06] death.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; We can preach till the presence of the
[1:58:15] Lord fills this room.
[1:58:19] You can sit there and watch person and
[1:58:22] miracle and miracle
[1:58:26] transpire.
[1:58:29] You can feel his presence till it
[1:58:31] tingles up and down and the hair raises
[1:58:35] on your neck.
[1:58:38] And you might cry out in your heart, I
[1:58:41] want that. I want that in me.
[1:58:45] And I as a minister might sit there and
[1:58:48] say, I want you to feel that. I want you
[1:58:51] to experience that.
[1:58:55] But there's no atmosphere
[1:58:58] that I can produce
[1:59:02] that will bypass death.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; That is thus saith the Lord.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; You can't get away from it.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; You'll never get it till you want it.
[1:59:25] And you'll never want it till the Holy
[1:59:27] Spirit makes your life miserable without
[1:59:30] it.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And it's in his hands.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It's the law.
[1:59:45] It's the gospel.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to be happy. I want you to
[1:59:52] shout,
[1:59:56] but I don't want the shout from come
[1:59:58] from the outside.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I want the shout to come from the
[2:00:02] inside.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to know what I'm shouting
[2:00:06] about. I don't want the music to create
[2:00:09] the shout.
[2:00:16] I want God
[2:00:19] to create it.
[2:00:22] and you sit in your room, you sit in
[2:00:25] your car, you sit alone in those lonely
[2:00:29] places and your mind works. That's when
[2:00:33] you talk to him.
[2:00:35] That's when you say, "Lord, what what am
[2:00:37] I going to do? What what do I do for a
[2:00:40] living? What's my life going to be like?
[2:00:43] Where am I going?" You have all these
[2:00:45] great questions.
[2:00:47] And if you just turn for a moment
[2:00:51] and talk to him,
[2:00:54] you feel his presence because the Bible
[2:00:57] said he won't turn you away in no wise.
[2:01:01] If you're sick
[2:01:04] and you just sit back, you say, "Lord,
[2:01:06] I'm sick."
[2:01:09] Why do you want to get get healed? To
[2:01:12] prove God's a healer. God don't need to
[2:01:15] prove he's a healer by making you well.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; You got to have a reason. I want to be
[2:01:21] well so I can be a better wife. I want
[2:01:23] to be well so I can testify. I want to
[2:01:26] be well so I can do a work for you.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be well just to be
[2:01:34] well.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; We need to be sick so we can get well.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; I hope that wasn't misunderstood.
[2:01:45] But that's what it is. That's what the
[2:01:48] church was built on.
[2:01:50] It was built on individuals
[2:01:55] experiencing the presence of the Lord,
[2:02:00] him in them,
[2:02:03] and the love of God in their heart
[2:02:06] going out and saying,
[2:02:10] "What He's done for me, he can do for
[2:02:14] you.
[2:02:22] It's important.
[2:02:25] And I preached a sermon.
[2:02:27] I said, "You've got to have confidence
[2:02:32] and faith in your death."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I got that before the cart,
[2:02:42] but you want to get farther in the Lord.
[2:02:45] You want to get a refilling of the
[2:02:48] spirit. You want to have a revival in
[2:02:51] your heart,
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; die to something,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; sacrifice something,
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; give up something.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; But there's no circumventing death for
[2:03:06] the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:03:11] Being born again means you let go,
[2:03:16] you die,
[2:03:18] and he
[2:03:20] comes
[2:03:22] into you and replaces your old nature
[2:03:28] with his nature.
[2:03:30] Hallelujah.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; If the spirit of Don
[2:03:35] of John Dillinger was in you who was a
[2:03:38] gangster, you would have guns.
[2:03:43] If a spirit of something else, a painter
[2:03:45] was in you, you would paint. If the
[2:03:49] spirit of Christ was in you, you do the
[2:03:51] works of Christ.
[2:03:55] Look at your works.
[2:03:58] Look at yourself in the mirror. Look at
[2:04:01] what you say. Look at what you do. Look
[2:04:03] at where you go.
[2:04:08] And if you see the world and you want to
[2:04:11] be different,
[2:04:14] ask him,
[2:04:17] "Lord, I want to overcome. I want to be
[2:04:20] different. I'm sorry
[2:04:24] that my nature causes me to act like
[2:04:28] this. I want a different nature. I want
[2:04:32] the joy of the Lord in my heart. I want
[2:04:35] love in my heart.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; You know, the world today has got
[2:04:39] everybody looking at their fleshly body.
[2:04:42] People aren't happy because they're big.
[2:04:44] Other people aren't happy because
[2:04:46] they're skinny. I'm not happy because I
[2:04:48] got a big nose and I'm fat and I'm bald
[2:04:51] and I, you know,
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; give it up.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; What happens if we all get to heaven and
[2:05:01] we're all gigantic?
[2:05:10] Wouldn't that be just a whole
[2:05:12] heartbreak?
[2:05:17] Don't starve yourself spiritually
[2:05:20] over your flesh.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; God don't look at that. God looks at
[2:05:26] your heart.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And that's what it means to be born
[2:05:31] again. That's what it means to have the
[2:05:34] Holy Spirit.
[2:05:36] I've died and he has come into me and
[2:05:40] he's living in me
[2:05:43] and I'm going to treat everybody around
[2:05:46] me
[2:05:48] the way
[2:05:50] he taught me to treat him.
[2:05:53] I'm going to live the life day by day.
[2:05:59] Now, evangelism is beginning
[2:06:03] because the world is seeing your light
[2:06:07] shining.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; I've kept you a long time this morning,
[2:06:10] but I just have to get this off my
[2:06:13] heart.
[2:06:14] They see your light shining. They know
[2:06:18] there's something in you that they don't
[2:06:22] have
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; and you know where they can get it.
[2:06:29] because they're going to find it the
[2:06:32] same place you found it.
[2:06:37] And when they're willing to die
[2:06:43] and they're willing to change
[2:06:46] and they're willing to want to be
[2:06:48] different
[2:06:51] and you're willing to pray with them
[2:06:54] and you're not ashamed of this gospel
[2:06:58] and you'll kneel down with them wherever
[2:07:00] they are.
[2:07:04] You can lead them
[2:07:06] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:09] and the Lord Jesus Christ will come into
[2:07:11] their heart
[2:07:14] and they'll be born again.
[2:07:19] And then as they grow in the Lord,
[2:07:24] the leadership of the Lord will grow in
[2:07:26] their lives. The spirit moving on them
[2:07:29] will grow in their lives. Their lives
[2:07:32] will worship. they'll be what God wants
[2:07:36] them to be. The beginning of evangelism
[2:07:39] starts here.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; The fruits of evangelism
[2:07:48] is here.
[2:07:51] So we have to be
[2:07:53] living as a body,
[2:07:56] ministering one to another, visiting our
[2:08:00] sick,
[2:08:01] taking the burdens, getting involved,
[2:08:05] letting the love of God shed abroad in
[2:08:08] our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
[2:08:11] And then we take our experience
[2:08:14] and we let our light so shine amongst
[2:08:17] men that our good works might glorify
[2:08:20] the father in heaven.
[2:08:26] You can't look back at your life and
[2:08:28] say, "I'm going to fix this and I'm
[2:08:31] going to fix that."
[2:08:33] All you have to do is stop and say,
[2:08:35] "Lord, whatever caused me to do those
[2:08:38] things, I'm asking you to take it out of
[2:08:41] my life.
[2:08:44] I'm willing to lay it down. I'm willing
[2:08:46] to die.
[2:08:50] And as he grows, your light will shine."
[2:08:54] And I'd like to close with this.
[2:08:57] Listen to this closely.
[2:09:01] This is paragraph 85 out of end time
[2:09:04] evangelism. And today the scientific
[2:09:07] theory
[2:09:09] of the modern so-called religious group
[2:09:12] has tried to prove that this blessed
[2:09:16] thing
[2:09:18] we have called the Holy Spirit is only
[2:09:22] emotion.
[2:09:26] That's what they say. It's just emotion.
[2:09:31] But listen close now.
[2:09:36] See, it just don't stand up according to
[2:09:38] their science theories.
[2:09:41] Well, I would like to ask them this.
[2:09:44] What makes them change?
[2:09:51] This blessed thing we call the Holy
[2:09:54] Spirit
[2:09:56] is not measured by the emotion. It's
[2:09:59] measured by the
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; change.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Now listen what he says really close. He
[2:10:06] says
[2:10:08] he says, "Well, I would ask them this.
[2:10:11] What makes them change? What makes the
[2:10:14] drunkard stop drinking? What makes the
[2:10:18] prostitute cease her evil life? What
[2:10:21] makes the cancer and the disease depart
[2:10:25] from the people
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; and the deaf and dumb and blind and dead
[2:10:31] to raise? Explain that. Is that emotion?
[2:10:36] It has emotion with it. Certainly.
[2:10:42] Certainly
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; if someone gets delivered, I'm happy.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; I praise God.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That excites me.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; But the question wasn't the emotion.
[2:11:02] It was the change.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. What made me change
[2:11:09] from a long-haired
[2:11:11] drug addict
[2:11:14] to giving my life to Christ and going
[2:11:18] preaching on the street?
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; You explain that to me
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; because I can't explain it.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; I can't explain how he found me. I can't
[2:11:31] explain why he found me. I can't explain
[2:11:34] what he wanted to do with me when he
[2:11:36] started with me way back then. You think
[2:11:38] I ever saw a building? No, I didn't want
[2:11:41] I don't want nothing to do with it.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; I hated people.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; I'd get up at 4:00 in the afternoon,
[2:11:55] stay up all night,
[2:11:58] and go to bed at 4:00 in the morning.
[2:12:03] Well, it have nothing to do with the
[2:12:05] sun.
[2:12:07] But one day, the sen
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; decided
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; it was his turn
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; to have me
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; and he plucked me
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; out of the greasy, slimy hands of the
[2:12:25] enemy. You say, "How did he do it?" He
[2:12:27] made me so miserable
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; that I cried out. And when I cried, he
[2:12:33] answered.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; You know you'll have it when you know
[2:12:39] you've changed.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; If you want to change
[2:12:45] and you're willing to die,
[2:12:48] lay yourself down and let his spirit
[2:12:51] come in you. You will experience
[2:12:54] what it's like
[2:12:57] to be born again and have a new nature.
[2:13:01] And then the works of the Lord as you
[2:13:03] mature will follow you. As you're
[2:13:06] faithful and little, you'll become
[2:13:09] faithful in much.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Anything that's alive has emotions
[2:13:15] and anything that doesn't have emotions
[2:13:18] is dead. Excuse the expression, but I
[2:13:22] think we ought to bury some of our
[2:13:25] emotionalist religion then because it's
[2:13:28] dead. It has no emotion to it. Any
[2:13:32] religion that has not emotion should be
[2:13:36] buried
[2:13:38] because it's emotional.
[2:13:41] Jesus when he entered the city he the
[2:13:45] children all of them all of his friends
[2:13:49] cried hosana
[2:13:52] him that cometh in the name of the Lord
[2:13:55] and those religious of that day couldn't
[2:13:58] stand it was too emotional he said if
[2:14:02] they hold their peace the rocks will
[2:14:05] immediately cry out something must cry
[2:14:08] out because there's life in there. You
[2:14:11] understand? If the life is in there, the
[2:14:14] emotions follow. The emotion doesn't
[2:14:17] bring the life. Death brings the life.
[2:14:21] Resurrection brings the emotion.
[2:14:24] Hallelujah.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; And then we could go into uh but we'll
[2:14:37] leave it there.
[2:14:40] So what is evangelism?
[2:14:43] It's people
[2:14:46] who've experienced a change
[2:14:51] and they let the world know
[2:14:55] that Christ,
[2:14:57] our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; can give you the change. And the change
[2:15:04] brings joymen,
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; peace, longsuffering,
[2:15:09] strength. It does something for you.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; It sets your heart on fire. You say,
[2:15:15] "Why does Satan keep
[2:15:18] after me?" Because he's an unbeliever,
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; but you're a believer.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; And your faith overcomes
[2:15:31] the world.
[2:15:33] The musicians we come.
[2:15:45] So I hope just to sum it up this morning
[2:15:49] to evangelize
[2:15:51] we have to have an experience.
[2:15:56] To bring the fruits of evangelism
[2:16:00] we have to have a storehouse.
[2:16:02] that's functioning
[2:16:05] as Christians.
[2:16:08] When we can get those things working
[2:16:10] together,
[2:16:12] a body
[2:16:15] ministering one to another, and our
[2:16:17] light shining
[2:16:19] in the world, proving that Jesus Christ
[2:16:22] is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:16:25] forever. We will see signs and wonders
[2:16:29] like we've never seen before.
[2:16:33] We don't want to get ahead of God,
[2:16:36] but I believe this time
[2:16:39] and the season.
[2:16:44] Everything in the church was based on
[2:16:49] the commission.
[2:16:52] It wasn't based on the upper room.
[2:16:57] It was based on what took place.
[2:17:02] They were commissioned. Is that correct?
[2:17:05] They went and got the power
[2:17:08] to carry out the commission. And the
[2:17:11] church is based on commission. Signs and
[2:17:14] wonders. The movement of the spirit is
[2:17:17] based on the church fulfilling the
[2:17:21] commission.
[2:17:23] Not calling the blessing, but fulfilling
[2:17:26] the commission. And the blessing comes
[2:17:29] when the commission is fulfilled. I hope
[2:17:33] I'm understood.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I hope I've never caused any trouble or
[2:17:39] confusion about emotion or about
[2:17:41] blessing.
[2:17:43] But when things are done in order,
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; yes sir,
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; God moves in a mighty way.
[2:17:50] Let's we stand together.
[2:18:01] Maybe I just ask this question to you
[2:18:05] this morning.
[2:18:07] In your own heart, honestly,
[2:18:10] do you feel you could live closer to
[2:18:12] God?
[2:18:14] You don't have to raise your hand. You
[2:18:16] don't have to
[2:18:20] do anything, but just be honest with
[2:18:23] your heart.
[2:18:28] Is the coming of the Lord
[2:18:32] a breath of fresh air to you?
[2:18:36] Is it your hope?
[2:18:39] Is it your comfort?
[2:18:41] For Paul said, if the if we have not the
[2:18:44] hope of this coming,
[2:18:47] then we of all people are most
[2:18:49] miserable.
[2:18:54] But it's the breath of fresh air. He's
[2:18:56] coming for me.
[2:18:59] I'm living for him.
[2:19:05] and I'm going to live like him and be
[2:19:07] like him.
[2:19:10] And if there's parts of your life today,
[2:19:13] like there are in mine that are not like
[2:19:16] him,
[2:19:18] I raise my hand today
[2:19:21] and I say, "Lord Jesus, you promised the
[2:19:24] Holy Spirit
[2:19:27] would lead
[2:19:29] and guide me
[2:19:31] into all truth and righteousness."
[2:19:37] I raised my hand this morning asking
[2:19:39] that that spirit would come to my life.
[2:19:44] It would guide me and it would work with
[2:19:47] me.
[2:19:51] Lord, I preached for an hour or more
[2:19:55] this morning and I know the people are
[2:19:59] weary and
[2:20:01] but Lord, I ask that you just touch
[2:20:03] their heart way deep down inside.
[2:20:08] And Father, and our young people
[2:20:12] that they can say, "Yes, we see.
[2:20:17] I see Malachi 4:5.
[2:20:20] I see this prophet messenger
[2:20:24] that my parents and brother McGary and
[2:20:27] the people talk about. I see it for
[2:20:29] myself.
[2:20:31] [Music]
[2:20:32] Lord, I I know you're real, Jesus,
[2:20:37] cuz I've talked to you and
[2:20:41] you came by and visited me.
[2:20:44] I know it's real. I know you're real in
[2:20:47] my life.
[2:20:50] And father, if there's any that have
[2:20:52] doubt
[2:20:54] of your love for them,
[2:20:57] I pray that you would just come by and
[2:21:00] whisper to their heart
[2:21:02] and give them eyes that they could see
[2:21:06] that they might know you.
[2:21:09] Father, and those that have been walking
[2:21:11] this journey for a long time, may we
[2:21:14] become more Christlike.
[2:21:18] May we display the virtues and the joy
[2:21:22] and the love.
[2:21:25] May we have good works that would
[2:21:27] glorify our father in heaven.
[2:21:31] Lord, I ask you to forgive me of all my
[2:21:34] shortcomings.
[2:21:41] Lord, we want the joy and
[2:21:45] we don't want a dead religion.
[2:21:48] We want to have the emotion that's
[2:21:50] caused by your presence. I just ask that
[2:21:55] you grant it to every heart and hand
[2:21:57] that's raised. Every person in here that
[2:22:00] wants more of you, Lord, that loves you
[2:22:03] and loves your word. Father, those that
[2:22:06] have not experienced you and your
[2:22:09] presence. Father, I pray you make
[2:22:12] yourself known
[2:22:15] that you would deal with their heart
[2:22:19] in such a special and wonderful way. Oh,
[2:22:23] the fresh breeze of Calvary. Amen.
[2:22:27] On a hill
[2:22:30] far away,

[2:33:03] I I stand here today as a miracle
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; and and I believe that with all my
[2:33:09] heart.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; God's grace is sufficient.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we so thank
[2:33:18] you Lord for the life you give us, Lord.
[2:33:21] the blood you shed for us, Lord. So many
